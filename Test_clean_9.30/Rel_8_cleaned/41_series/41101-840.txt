Foreword 1 Scope 2 References 3 Abbreviations 4 General 5 Specifications and Reports Annex A informative Change history Foreword This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP. The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the contents of the present document it will be re-released by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as follows Version x.y.z where x the first digit 1 presented to TSG for information 2 presented to TSG for approval 3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control. y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance i.e. technical enhancements corrections updates etc. z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document. 1 Scope The present document identifies the 3GPP system specifications for Release 8. The specifications and reports of 3GPP Release 8 have a major version number 8 i.e. 8.x.y. The listed Specifications are required to build a system based on GERAN radio technology. 2 References The following documents contain provisions which through reference in this text constitute provisions of the present document. References are either specific identified by date of publication edition number version number etc. or nonspecific. For a specific reference subsequent revisions do not apply. For a non-specific reference the latest version applies. In the case of a reference to a 3GPP document including a GSM document a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document in the same Release as the present document . 1 3GPP TR 21.905 Vocabulary for 3GPP Specifications. 2 3GPP TR 21.900 Technical Specification Group working methods. 3 Abbreviations For the purposes of the present document the terms and definitions given in 3GPP TR 21.905 apply. 4 General The numbering scheme for specifications is described in 3GPP TR 21.900 2. 5 Specifications and Reports NOTE 1 The for publication column of the table below indicates whether or not the documents are intended for adoption by the partner Standards Development Organizations as their own publications.
