Annex A informative Core IMS Specifications transferred from ETSI TISPAN to 3GPP The information in the present annex originally appeared on the 3GPP web site at httpwww.3gpp.orgFixed-network-core-IMS-mapping and is reproduced here for the sake of comprehensibility of the relationship between NGN Releases 1 and 2 and the corresponding 3GPP TSs. The table below shows the ETSI publications relating to core functions of the IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS used by the Next Generation Network standardized within ETSI Technical Committee Telecommunications and Internet converged Services and Protocols for Advanced Networking TISPAN. Because of different working methods between TISPAN and 3GPP NGN Release 1 R1 and Release 2 R2 publications are transferred under separate 3GPP TS numbers. EXAMPLE 3GPP TS 23.404 NGN Release 1 in 3GPP Release 7 becomes 3GPP TS 23.504 NGN Release 2 in 3GPP Release 8. Where further development is envisaged within the Rel-8 timeframe a further number 2x.6xx has been allocated. EXAMPLE 3GPP TS 24.504 NGN Release 2 in 3GPP Release 8 becomes 3GPP TS 24.604 beyond NGN Release 2 in 3GPP Release 8 and beyond. TS 24.504 will not be continued in 3GPP Release 9 ff. In general TISPAN documents were transferred in an already-frozen state and only essential maintenance is envisaged on the 3GPP 2x.4xx and 2x.5xx TSs.

First instance transferred to 3GPP is 2x.4aa where aa is the same as the last two digits of the TISPAN parent publication. Where no R2 exists R1 document is transferred to Rel-7 and is immediately approved and frozen. Version 7.0.0 is then immediately upgraded to Rel-8 v8.0.0 unchanged. All transferred specs with one exception see note 5 are immediately frozen after transfer at both Rel-7 and Rel-8. A few do not exist at Rel-7. Note 2 Version in Italics TISPAN not yet available for txfer ie being processed towards ETSI publication at a higher version. Note 3 May be unnecessary to transfer this spec since already superseded by 29.162. Nevertheless CT3 decided to transfer to be on the safe side. Note 4 deleted Note 5 Not yet frozen at R2. therefore too early to create post R2 3GPP version further development to take place within 24.503. Note 6 3GPP version numbers take over where TISPAN left off. Thus they do not necessarily abide by the rules of 21.900. The version number in each 3GPP Release is stepped up one editorial place from the TISPAN version number used as the basis. Note 7 For TISPAN endorsements continuing development will take place within the orignal endorsed spec so no new 2x.6xx spec is needed. Note 8 TS 181 002 not frozen at R2 so work continues in 22.173 Rel-8. Note 9 The versions shown are for the first instance of the 3GPP spec concerned. Obviously these will be raised to v7.0.0 8.0.0 as soon as they are approved. There is no intention to maintain this page to show the most current version. Note 10 Some elements of original TISPAN document to be transferred others to remain.
