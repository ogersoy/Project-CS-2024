# 3 Definitions of terms, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Terms
For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in TR 21.905 [1] and
the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence
over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
_**Field of view:** the angle of visible field expressed in degrees measured
from the focal point._
**PDU Set** : A PDU Set is composed of one or more PDUs carrying the payload
of one unit of information generated at the application level (e.g. a frame or
video slice for XRM Services, as used in TR 26.926 [6]). In some
implementations all PDUs in a PDU Set are needed by the application layer to
use the corresponding unit of information. In other implementations, the
application layer can still recover parts or all of the information unit, when
some PDUs are missing.
**Multi-modal Data** : Multi-modal Data is defined to describe the input data
from different kinds of devices/sensors or the output data to different kinds
of destinations (e.g. one or more UEs) required for the same task or
application. Multi-modal Data consists of more than one Single-modal Data, and
there is strong dependency among each Single-modal Data. Single-modal Data can
be seen as one type of data.
**Data Burst:** Data produced by the application in a short period of time,
comprising PDUs from one or more PDU Sets.

# 4 Introduction to Extended Reality
## 4.1 Extended Reality Types
_Extended Reality_ (**XR**) refers to all real-and-virtual combined
environments and human-machine interactions generated by computer technology
and wearables. XR is an umbrella term for different types of realities (see TR
26.918 [5] and TR 26.928 [7]):
\- Virtual reality (**VR**) is a rendered version of a delivered visual and
audio scene. The rendering is designed to mimic the visual and audio sensory
stimuli of the real world as naturally as possible to an observer or user as
they move within the limits defined by the application. Virtual reality
usually, but not necessarily, requires a user to wear a head mounted display
(HMD), to completely replace the user\'s field of view with a simulated visual
component, and to wear headphones, to provide the user with the accompanying
audio. Some form of head and motion tracking of the user in VR is usually also
necessary to allow the simulated visual and audio components to be updated in
order to ensure that, from the user\'s perspective, items and sound sources
remain consistent with the user\'s movements.
\- Augmented reality (**AR**) is when a user is provided with additional
information or artificially generated items or content overlaid upon their
current environment. Such additional information or content will usually be
visual and/or audible and their observation of their current environment may
be direct, with no intermediate sensing, processing and rendering, or
indirect, where their perception of their environment is relayed via sensors
and may be enhanced or processed.
\- Mixed reality (**MR**) is an advanced form of AR where some virtual
elements are inserted into the physical scene with the intent to provide the
illusion that these elements are part of the real scene.
_Other terms used in the context of XR are Immersion as the sense of being
surrounded by the virtual environment as well as Presence providing the
feeling of being physically and spatially located in the virtual environment.
The sense of presence provides significant minimum performance requirements
for different technologies such as tracking, latency, persistency, resolution
and optics._
_This document uses the acronym XR throughout to refer to equipment,
applications and functions used for VR, AR and MR. Examples include, but are
not limited to HMDs for VR, optical see-through glasses and camera see-through
HMDs for AR and MR and mobile devices with positional tracking and camera.
They all offer some degree of spatial tracking and the spatial tracking
results in an interaction to view some form of virtual content._
## 4.2 Human Perception and Tracking
For providing XR experiences that make the user feel _immersed_ and _present_
, several relevant quality of experience factors have been collected (see TR
26.926 [7]). Presence is the feeling of being physically and spatially located
in an environment. Presence is divided into 2 types: Cognitive Presence and
Perceptive Presence. Cognitive Presence is the presence of one\'s mind. It can
be achieved by watching a compelling film or reading an engaging book.
Cognitive Presence is important for an immersive experience of any kind.
Perceptive Presence is the presence of one\'s senses. To accomplish perceptive
presence, one\'s senses, sights, sound, touch and smell, have to be tricked.
To create perceptive presence, the XR Device has to fool the user\'s senses,
most notably the audio-visual system. XR Devices achieve this through
positional tracking based on the movement. The goal of the system is to
maintain your sense of presence and avoid breaking it. Perceptive Presence is
the objective to be achieved by XR applications.
The Human field of view (**FoV**) is defined as the area of vision at a given
moment (with a fixed head). It is the angle of visible field expressed in
degrees measured from the focal point. The monocular FoV is the angle of the
visible field of one eye whereas the binocular FoV is the combination of the
two eyes fields (see TR 26.918 [5]). The binocular horizontal FoV is around
200-220°, while the vertical one around 135°. The central vision, which is
about 60°, is also called the comfort zone where sensibility to details is the
most important. Although less sensitive to definition, the peripheral vision
is more receptive to movements.
In XR, actions and interactions involve movements and gestures. Thereby, the
_Degrees of Freedom (__DoF_ _)_ describe the number of independent parameters
used to define movement in the 3D space (see TR 26.928 [7]):
\- 3DoF: three rotational and un-limited movements around the X, Y and Z axes
(respectively pitch, yaw and roll). A typical use case is a user sitting in a
chair looking at 3D 360 VR content on an HMD.
Figure 4.2-1: 3DoF
\- 6DoF: 3DoF with full translational movements along X, Y and Z axes. Beyond
the 3DoF experience, it adds (i) moving up and down (elevating/heaving); (ii)
moving left and right (strafing/swaying); and (iii) moving forward and
backward (walking/surging). A typical use case is a user freely walking
through 3D 360 VR content (physically or via dedicated user input means)
displayed on an HMD.
Figure 4.2-2: 6DoF
An **XR View** describes a single view into an XR scene for a given time. Each
view corresponds to a display or portion of a display used by an XR device to
present the portion of the scene to the user.
An **XR Viewport** describes a viewport, or a rectangular region, of a
graphics surface. The XR viewport corresponds to the projection of the XR View
onto a target display. An XR viewport is predominantly defined by the width
and height of the rectangular dimensions of the viewport.
An **XR Pose** describes a _position_ and _orientation_ in space relative to
an XR Space. An essential element of XR is the spatial tracking of the viewer
pose.
## 4.3 Capture, Encoding and Delivery
### 4.3.1 Video
XR content may be represented in different formats, e.g. panoramas or spheres
depending on the capabilities of the capture systems. Since modern video
coding standards are not designed to handle spherical content. Projection is
used for conversion of a spherical (or 360°) video into a two-dimensional
rectangular video before the encoding stage. After projection, the obtained
two-dimensional rectangular image can be partitioned into regions (e.g. front,
right, left, back, top, bottom) that can be rearranged to generate \"packed\"
frames to increase coding efficiency or viewport dependent stream arrangement.
There are mainly three approaches that can be considered for 360 video
delivery (see TR 26.918 [5]):
\- Single stream approach: the single stream approach consists in providing
the full 360 video and showing the interesting part only. Solutions that lie
within this group have the drawback that either they may not be scalable or
they may impose a big challenge in terms of required network resources (high
bitrate of high resolution video) and required processing at the client side
(decode a very high resolution video).
\- Multi-stream approach: the multi-stream approach consists of encoding
several streams, each of them emphasizing a given viewport and making them
available for the receiver, so that the receiver decides which stream is
delivered at each time instance.
\- Tiled stream approach: the tiled stream approach consists in emphasizing
the current user viewport through transmitting non-viewport samples with
decreased resolution. The tiles can be provided as one common bitstream (using
motion-constrained HEVC tiles) or as separate video streams.
In modern video codecs (see S4-220505 [13]):
\- Complex prediction structures are used that take into account application
constraints, encoding complexity, latency and dynamic decisions in the
encoding. This may result in irregularities, for example based on sequence
properties. In particular for low-latency delivery with error resiliency,
different flavours of encoding operations are in use, and the concept of I, P
and B pictures is not generally applicable.
\- All PDUs in a PDU Set are needed by the application layer to use the
corresponding unit of information in some implementations; while in some
others, receivers may use the data up to the first lost fragmentation unit to
recover at least parts of the video data and apply error concealment
afterward.
\- Furthermore, in motion-compensated predicted video decoding, some frames
refer to other frames based on the video encoding configuration but also based
on dynamic operational decisions. As a consequence, a PDU Set may \"depend\"
on previously received PDU Sets. However, such dependencies do not necessarily
result in discarding dependent information units.
### 4.3.2 Audio
For Audio, we can distinguish channel-based and object-based representations
(see TR 26.918 [5]):
\- Channel-based representation using multiple microphones to capture sounds
from different directions and post-processing techniques are well known in the
industry, as they have been the standard for decades.
\- Object-based representations represent a complex auditory scene as a
collection of single audio elements, each comprising an audio waveform and a
set of associated parameters or metadata. The metadata embody the artistic
intent by specifying the transformation of each of the audio elements to
playback by the final reproduction system. Sound objects generally use
monophonic audio tracks that have been recorded or synthesized through a
process of sound design. These sound elements can be further manipulated, so
as to be positioned in a horizontal plane around the listener, or in full
three-dimensional space using positional metadata.
## 4.4 XR Engines and Rendering
XR engines provide a middleware that abstracts hardware and software
functionalities for developers of XR applications (see TR 26.928 [7]). Typical
components include a rendering engine for graphics, an audio engine for sound,
and a physics engine for emulating the laws of physics. In the remainder of
this Technical Report, the term _XR engine_ is used to provide any type of
typical XR functionalities as mentioned above.
The processing of an XR engine is not exclusively carried out in the device
GPU. In power and resource constrained devices, it can be assisted or split
across the network through edge computing (see TR 22.842 [2]): the UE sends
the sensor data in uplink direction to the cloud side in a real time manner
and when the cloud side receives the sensor data, it performs rendering
computing and produces the multimedia data and then sends back to the user
devices for display. This is where NR can play an essential role.
## 4.5 Characteristics and Requirements
### 4.5.1 General
**In general, the RTP layer can handle out-of-sequence reception of RTP
packets, and some codecs even require it for good operations (instead of
having to cope with increased delays to satisfy in-sequence delivery). Thus, a
mode of operation where the lower-layers on the receiver side do not always
enforce in-sequence delivery to upper layers is preferred (see S4aR230035
[17]).**
**Other than that, i** t is difficult to identify characteristics common for
different XR applications since they heavily depend on the application
choices, such as the application itself, the codec in use, the data formats
and the encoding operation (see S4-220505 [13]). In particular, low-latency XR
and cloud gaming video services such as Split-Rendering or Cloud Gaming
typically would not use the traditional coding structure with a fixed Group
of-Picture (GOP). In addition, the field of low-latency video delivery is
undergoing heavy innovation and new coding methods may be established
frequently. Thus, the traffic characteristics and requirements derived from
the work done in SA4 (TR 26.926 [6] and TR 26.928 [7]) and listed below, can
only be used as a baseline when specific examples for XR traffic
characteristics are needed -- bearing in mind that they are not universally
applicable for all XR applications.
### 4.5.2 Video
The **frame rate** for XR video varies from 15 frames per second up to 90 or
even 120 frames per second, with a typical minimum of 60 for VR (see TR 26.918
[5] and TR 26.926 [6]).
According to TR 26.918 [5], the **latency** of action of the angular or
rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex is known to be of the order of 10 ms or in
a range from 7-15 milliseconds and it seems reasonable that this should
represent a performance goal for XR systems. This results in a motion-to-
photon latency of less than 20 milliseconds, with 10ms being given as a goal.
Regarding the **bit rates** , between 10 and 200Mbps can be expected for XR
depending on frame rate, resolution and codec efficiency (see TR 26.926 [6]
and TR 26.928 [7]).
### 4.5.3 Audio
According to TR 26.918 [5], due to the relatively slower speed of sound
compared to that of light, it is natural that users are more accustomed to,
and therefore tolerant of, sound being relatively delayed with respect to the
video component than sound being relatively in advance of the video component.
Recent studies have led to recommendations of an accuracy of between 15 ms
(audio delayed) and 5 ms (audio advanced) for the **synchronization** , with
recommended absolute limits of 60 ms (audio delayed) and 40 ms (audio
advanced) for broadcast video.
### 4.5.4 Pose Information
To maintain a reliable registration of the virtual world with the real world,
as well as to ensure accurate tracking of the XR Viewer pose, XR applications
require highly accurate, low-latency tracking of the device at about 1kHz
sampling frequency. The size of a XR Viewer Pose associated to time, typically
results in packets of size in the range of 30-100 bytes, such that the
generated data is around several hundred kbit/s if delivered over the network
with latency requirements in the range of 10-20ms (see TR 26.928 [7]).
Repeatedly providing the XR Viewer Pose for the same display time may not
necessarily return the same result (the prediction gets increasingly accurate
as the information is closer to the time when a prediction is made) and there
is a trade-off between providing several XR Viewer Pose for a display time and
using the same XR Viewer Pose for several consecutive display times. However,
it can be assumed that sending one XR Viewer Pose aligned with the frame rate
of the rendered video may be sufficient, for example at 60fps (see S4-221626
[16]).
NOTE: In case the pose is used for pre-rendering in the network (edge/cloud),
an accurate and most recent pose information is preferable.
Pose information has to be delivered with ultra-high reliability, therefore,
similar performance as URLLC is expected i.e. packet loss rate should be lower
than 10E-3 for uplink sensor data -- see S4-221626 [16].
# 5 XR Enhancements for NR
## 5.1 XR Awareness
### 5.1.1 General
In both uplink and downlink, XR-Awareness contributes to optimizations of gNB
radio resource scheduling and relies at least on the notions of PDU Set and
Data Burst (see TR 23.700-60 [9]): a PDU Set is composed of one or more PDUs
carrying the payload of one unit of information generated at the application
level (e.g. a frame or video slice), while a Data Burst is a set of data PDUs
generated and sent by the application in a short period of time.
NOTE 1: A Data Burst can be composed of multiple PDUs belonging to one or
multiple PDU Sets. During a Data Burst, periods of data transmission
inactivity should not be assumed. Although the duration of Data Bursts may
vary, it can be assumed that it stays within the same order of magnitude.
Also, the arrival time of the first packet of a data burst cannot be provided
by 5GC.
The following information may be provided by the CN to RAN (see TR 23.700-60
[9]):
\- Semi-static information per QoS flow:
\- Periodicity for UL and DL traffic of the QoS Flow provided via TSCAI/TSCAC;
\- DL Traffic jitter information (e.g. jitter range) associated with each
periodicity of the QoS flow provided via TSCAI/TSCAC.
\- PDU Set QoS parameters of the QoS flow (i.e. applicable to all PDU sets of
the QoS flow) provided by the SMF via NGAP:
\- PDU Set Error Rate (PSER): defines an upper bound for a rate of non-
congestion related PDU Set losses between RAN and the UE (see TR 23.700-60
[9]).
NOTE 2: In this release, a PDU set is considered as successfully delivered
only when all PDUs of a PDU Set are delivered successfully, and if the PSER is
available, the usage of PSER supersedes the usage of PER.
\- PDU Set Delay Budget (PSDB): time between reception of the first PDU (at
the UPF in DL, at the UE in UL) and the successful delivery of the last
arrived PDU of a PDU Set (at the UE in DL, at the UPF in UL). PSDB is an
optional parameter and when provided, the PSDB supersedes the PDB (see TR
23.700-60 [9]).
\- PDU Set Integrated Handling Indication (PSIHI): indicates whether all PDUs
of the PDU Set are needed for the usage of PDU Set by application layer.
\- PDU Set Information and Identification (dynamic information for DL provided
by user plane in GTP-U header):
\- PDU Set Sequence Number;
\- PDU Set Size in bytes (FFS);
\- PDU SN within a PDU Set;
\- Indication of End PDU of the PDU Set;
\- PDU Set Importance (PSI): identifies the relative importance of a PDU Set
compared to other PDU Sets within a QoS Flow. RAN may use it for PDU Set level
packet discarding in presence of congestion;
\- End of Data Burst indication in the header of the last PDU of the Data
Burst (optional).
For the uplink XR traffic, the UE needs to be able to identify PDU Set and
Data Bursts dynamically, including PSI, but in-band marking over Uu of PDUs is
not needed. Additional potential improvements to enhance the scheduling of
uplink resources are given in clause 5.3.2.
When the PSIHI is set for a QoS flow, as soon as one PDU of a PDU set is known
to be lost, the remaining PDUs of that PDU Set can be considered as no longer
needed by the application and may be subject to discard operation (see clause
5.3.2).
NOTE 3: It cannot always be assumed that the remaining PDUs are not useful and
can safely be discarded.
NOTE 4: In case of Forward Error Correction (FEC), active discarding of PDUs
when assuming that a large enough number of packets have already been
transmitted for FEC to recover without the remaining PDUs is not recommended
as it might trigger an increase of FEC packets (see S4aV220921 [14]).
### 5.1.2 Layer 2 Structure
Depending on how the mapping of PDU Sets onto QoS flows is done in the NAS and
how QoS flows are mapped onto DRBs in the AS, we can distinguish the following
alternatives (as depicted on Figure 5.1.2-1 below):
\- 111: one-to-one mapping between types of PDU Sets and QoS flows in the NAS
and one-to-one mapping between QoS flows and DRBs in the AS. From a Layer 2
structure viewpoint, this alternative is already possible and requires as many
DRBs as types of PDU Sets. Providing different QoS for the types of PDU Sets
sent in different DRBs is already possible.
\- NN1: one-to-one mapping between types of PDU Sets and QoS flows in the NAS
and possible multiplexing of QoS flows in one DRB in the AS. From a Layer 2
structure viewpoint, this alternative is already possible but gives each QoS
flows multiplexed in a DRB the same QoS. Providing different QoS for the types
of PDU Sets (i.e. QoS flows) multiplexed in a single DRB is currently not
possible.
\- N11: possible multiplexing of types of PDU Sets in one QoS flow in the NAS
and one-to-one mapping between QoS flows and DRBs in the AS. From a Layer 2
structure viewpoint, this alternative is already possible but gives each QoS
flow/DRB one QoS. Providing different QoS for the types of PDU Sets
multiplexed in a single QoS flow/DRB is currently not possible.
\- N1N: possible multiplexing of types of PDU Sets in one QoS flow in the NAS
and demultiplexing of types of PDU Sets from one QoS flow on multiple DRBs in
the AS. From a Layer 2 structure viewpoint, demultiplexing of types of PDU
Sets from one QoS flow onto multiple DRBs is currently not possible.
NOTE: The multiplexing of several types of PDU sets on the same QoS flow is
allowed by the CN.
Figure 5.1.2-1: Mapping Alternatives
When comparing these alternatives, it was agreed that a QoS flow cannot be
mapped onto multiple DRBs in the uplink, thereby excluding alternative N1N.
For the other alternatives, providing different QoS by splitting PDU sets of
one DRB to different RLC bearers will not be possible i.e. that splitting a
DRB onto multiple RLC entities will remain limited to existing cases (e.g.
duplication).
In addition, the notion of PDU Set does not impact the granularity of:
\- SDAP SDU handling: SDAP still maps every incoming SDU to a single PDU for a
single PDCP entity;
\- Retransmissions: HARQ still relies on MAC PDUs and ARQ on RLC PDUs.
In terms of logical channel prioritisation in uplink, changes due to PDU
prioritisation will not be introduced, e.g. delay criteria was considered but
agreed not to be pursued further unless fundamental issues are identified.
## 5.2 Power Saving Techniques
### 5.2.1 Physical Layer Enhancements
The evaluation results for proposed and studied power saving enhancement
schemes are available in Annex B.2.
### 5.2.2 Layer 2 Enhancements
Most XR frame rates (15, 30, 45, 60, 72, 90 and 120fps) correspond to
periodicities which are not an integer (66.66, 33.33, 22.22, 16.66, 13.88,
11.11 and 8.33ms respectively). The corresponding support by DRX will be dealt
with in a semi-static manner at least (e.g. via RRC signalling).
In addition, RRC pre-configuration and switching of configurations of DRX can
be considered for enhancements of XR power saving.
## 5.3 Capacity Improvements Techniques
### 5.3.1 Physical Layer Enhancements
The following enhancements for configured grant-based transmission are
recommended:
\- Multiple CG PUSCH transmission occasions in a period of a single CG PUSCH
configuration;
\- Dynamic indication of unused CG PUSCH occasion(s) based on UCI (e.g., CG-
UCI or a new UCI) by the UE.
The corresponding capacity performance evaluation results are available in
Annex B.1.6.
The evaluation results for other proposed and studied capacity enhancement
schemes are available in Annex B.1.
### 5.3.2 Layer 2 Enhancements
In order to enhance the scheduling of uplink resources for XR, the following
improvements are envisioned:
\- One or more additional BS table(s) to reduce the quantisation errors in BSR
reporting (e.g. for high bit rates);
\- Delay knowledge of buffered data, consisting of e.g. remaining time, and
distinguishing how much data is buffered for which delay. It is to be
determined whether the delay information is reported as part of BSR or as a
new MAC CE. Also, how the delay information can be up to date considering e.g.
scheduling and transmission delays needs to be investigated further.
\- Additional BSR triggering conditions to allow timely availability of buffer
status information can be investigated further.
\- Delivery of some assistance information (e.g. periodicity) reusing TSCAI as
a baseline. Whether additional mechanism is required can be further considered
with an assumption that all information may not be always available at UE
application.
\- Signalling of UL traffic arrival information from the UE to the gNB e.g. to
cope with jitter in case of tethering (FFS).
For PDCP discard operation in uplink, the timer-based discard operation (when
configured) should apply to all SDUs/PDUs belonging to the same PDU Set.
Furthermore, for a PDU Set in a QoS flow for which the PSIHI is set, when one
PDU of that PDU set is known to either be lost or associated to a discarded
SDU (see clause 5.1.1), all remaining PDUs of that PDU Set could be discarded
at the transmitter to free up radio resources.
In case of congestion, the PSI may be used for PDU set discarding (see clause
5.1.1) and in uplink, a PDU set discard mechanism taking the PSI into account
will be introduced.
In uplink, the usage of Configured Grant brings potential benefits for XR
services with the enhancements recommended in clause 5.3.1, while in downlink,
enhancements to Semi-Persistent scheduling are not foreseen to bring any
benefits.
NOTE: The layer 2 components of the mechanisms recommended in clause 5.3.1
will be specified.
# 6 Conclusions
In conclusion of the study, the following enhancements for XR services are
recommended:
\- For XR Awareness:
\- Provisioning by CN of semi-static information per QoS flow (e.g. PDU set
QoS parameters), dynamic information per PDU set (PDU Set information and
Identification) and End of Data Burst indication (as per TR 23.700-60 [9]);
\- Identifying by UE of PDU Sets, Data bursts and PSI;
\- Provisioning by UE of XR traffic assistance information e.g. periodicity,
UL traffic arrival information (FFS).
\- For Power Saving:
\- DRX support of XR frame rates corresponding to non-integer periodicities
(through at least semi-static mechanisms e.g. RRC signalling).
\- For Capacity Enhancements:
\- Multiple CG PUSCH transmission occasions in a period of a single CG PUSCH
configuration;
\- Dynamic indication of unused CG PUSCH occasion(s) based on UCI by the UE;
\- BSR enhancements including at least new BS Table(s);
\- Delay reporting of buffered data in uplink;
\- Discard operation of PDU Sets.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Evaluation Methodology
Rel-17 evaluation methodology for XR power saving and capacity enhancements
(see TR 38.838 [8]) is used as the baseline evaluation methodology for UE
power saving and capacity evaluation of Rel-18 XR.
System capacity is identified as KPI for capacity study, which is defined as
the maximum number of users per cell with at least Y % of UEs being satisfied.
A UE is declared as a satisfied UE if all considered streams meet their own
packet error rate (PER) and PDB requirements, i.e., more than X% of packets
are successfully transmitted within a given air interface PDB. From Rel-17 XR
evaluation methodology, baseline parameters are Y= 90% and X = 99%.
For power saving evaluation, power saving gain and capacity gain are
calculated with respect to the AlwaysOn baseline unless otherwise noted.
Jitter in DL is assumed on unless otherwise noted.
In addition to the values for jitter in DL in Table 5.1-2 in TR 38.838 [8],
the following statistical parameters can also be optionally evaluated in
Rel-18 XR SI.
NOTE: This optional assumption is not applicable to the evaluation of 90 FPS
and above.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Evaluation Studies
# B.1 Capacity performance evaluation results
## B.1.1 Multi-PDSCH scheduling by a single DCI
This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results for dynamic
scheduling when multi-PDSCH is scheduled by a single DCI. Due to large XR
video frame as per 38.838, resources in a single slot may be not enough to
convey all the data of a frame, resulting in resource allocation spanning more
than one slot. Thereby, in this clause, multi-PDSCH scheduling by a single DCI
is evaluated to transmit XR video frame over multiple slots.
The performance of single-PDSCH scheduling, where X symbol(s) are always
reserved for PDCCH transmission in each slot (scheme 1.1 in Tables
B.1.1-1,2,3) has been compared against various schemes for multi-PDSCH
scheduling. Particularly, the following schemes, where multi-PDSCH is
scheduled by a single DCI, have been evaluated:
\- Scheme 1.2: Multi-PDSCH scheduling, where unoccupied CORESET in a slot can
be re-used for PDSCH transmission.
\- Scheme 1.3: Multi-PDSCH scheduling, where X symbol(s) are always reserved
for PDCCH transmission in each slot.
\- Scheme 1.4: Multi-PDSCH scheduling with FDRA enhancement - more than one
FDRA indication is contained in the scheduling DCI, each of which is applied
to one or more scheduled PDSCH.
\- Scheme 1.5: Multi-PDSCH scheduling enhancement with early HARQ-ACK feedback
- multiple PUCCHs may be considered where HARQ-ACK for the earlier PDSCH(s)
can be reported earlier than the later PDSCH(s) scheduled by the same DCI, to
reduce latency of HARQ-ACK feedback.
\- Scheme 1.6: Multi-PDSCH scheduling where single PDCCH schedules up to 4
PDSCHs and full flexibility in terms of resource (RB allocation) as well as
MCS for each of the 4 PDSCHs.
\- Scheme 1.7: Multi-PDSCH scheduling, where X symbols per slot are used for
PDCCH if there is at least one UE that needs to be scheduled with first TB out
of multiple TBs and 0 symbols per slot are used for PDCCH if no UE with the
first TB out of multiple TBs needs to be scheduled.
The performance results of the above schemes are reported in Table B.1.1-1,
Table B.1.1-2, Table B.1.1-3 in terms of the ratio of satisfied users.

Based on the evaluation results in Table B.1.1-1 and Table B.1.1-3, the

compared to single PDSCH scheduling can be made:

## B.1.2 Cooperative MIMO via DL interference probing based on SRS enhancement
This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results for
cooperative MIMO in TDD with downlink interference probing via SRS and
precoding via bi-directional training (BiT). In TDD system, channel UL-DL
reciprocity is utilized to obtain DL channel state information for improved
performance of single-cell (non-cooperative) MU-MIMO. However, inter-cell
interference is still the bottleneck that limits further capacity improvement.
The performance of MU-MIMO with zero forcing precoding (scheme 2.1 in Tables
B.1.2-1,2) has been compared against Cooperative MIMO with DL interference
probing (scheme 2.2 in Tables B.1.2-1,2).
Scheme 2.2: Cooperative MIMO with DL interference probing via SRS and
precoding via bi-directional training (BiT), is the scheme where SRS
triggering and transmission are enhanced to directly reflect DL interference
spatial information (utilizing UL-DL reciprocity). Each gNB performs its own
(MU) scheduling and instructs the scheduled UEs to sound on the scheduled
PRBs. Then by TDD reciprocity, a gNB seeing strong UL interference from a
certain spatial direction on the SRS resources (for example, via estimating
the UL spatial covariance matrix of interference signals) implies that in DL
transmission the gNB will cause strong interference to UE(s) in that
direction. The gNB can then adjust the precoding for DL interference avoidance
during the PDSCH transmissions. Each gNB measures the corresponding UL SRS
resources and adjusts its DL precoding accordingly to achieve multi-cell DL
interference coordination/avoidance in a distributed way, and hence the so-
called \'Bi-directional Training\' (BiT).
The performance results are reported in B.1.2-1 and B.1.2-2 in terms of the
ratio of satisfied users.

## B.1.3 Enhanced CQI for CBG-based transmissions
This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of enhanced
CQI (eCQI) for code block group (CBG)-based transmissions. The use of CBG-
based transmissions allows avoiding a re-transmission of the full transport
block in case the receiver fails to correctly decode the full TB. A large size
of one video frame as per TR 38.838, results in a large TB(s) size to convey a
video frame.
The performance of the current legacy link adaptation with TB-based
transmission legacy CQI reporting (scheme 3.1 in Table B.1.3-1) has been
compared against CBG-based transmission with eCQI (scheme 3.2 in Table
B.1.3-1). The legacy CQI corresponds to the highest supported MCS while not
exceeding a 10% BLER target for the TBs.
Scheme 3.2: eCQI is the scheme where UE estimates the highest supported MCS
(expressed via a CQI index), assuming that downlink transmissions occupy a set
of downlink physical resource blocks termed the CSI reference resource with M
code block groups, while the error probability of at most N failed code block
groups does not exceed P. Parameters M, N, and P may be configured by the
network, or fixed to values that are attractive for XR services. The
configuration of the UE to use eCQI may be conducted with RRC signaling (note
that configuration of current CQI schemes for a UE to use is also via RRC).
The reporting of the eCQI can be in the form of an eCQI index (from current
CQI tables [TS38.214 - Tables in 5.2.2.1] or enhanced CQI tables) that will
guide the gNB to choose the supported modulation scheme, effective code rate,
and overall efficiency that for its PDSCH transmissions. For the CBG-based
transmission with eCQI, results are shown for parameter settings M=8 assuming
either N=2 or N=4 and P= 50%.
The performance results are reported in Table B.1.3-1 in terms of the ratio of
satisfied users.

## B.1.5 Soft HARQ-ACK enhancements
This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of soft HARQ-
ACK enhancements. HARQ allows to recover transport blocks that are not
successfully decoded by means of retransmissions. It can be leveraged to use
MCS close to what the radio channel can support while maintaining high
reliability. The gNB chooses the MCS for a transmission based on its knowledge
of the channel conditions, but it cannot always precisely predict how they
evolve.
The performance of Baseline HARQ-ACK (scheme 5.1 in Tables B.1.5-1,2,3) has
been compared against different schemes with soft HARQ-ACK. Particularly, the
following schemes, with soft HARQ-ACK, have been evaluated:
\- Scheme 5.2: Soft HARQ-ACK indicating delta MCS: UE provides enhanced HARQ-
ACK feedback beyond the single bit ACK/NACK status in the form of a Delta MCS
based on PDSCH decoding. The soft HARQ-ACK feedback uses SINR measurements
done on each TB and link curves obtained from link level simulations. Then the
information the UE feeds back to the gNB is an estimation of how far the
experienced SINR is from the SINR that would allow a reliable decoding of the
TB.
\- Scheme 5.3: Soft HARQ-ACK indicating number of redundant transmissions:
2-bit soft-HARQ feedback is reported by the UE and used by the gNB scheduler.
The 2-bit soft-HARQ feedback represents 4 states: ACK, and NACK with n=1, 2,
or 3, where \"n\" indicates how many redundant transmissions are requested by
the UE.
The performance results are reported in Table B.1.5-1, Table B.1.5-2, Table
B.1.5-3 in terms of the ratio of satisfied users.

## B.1.6 Configured grant scheduling
This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results for
configured grant scheduling. A UE can transmit UL data using CG resources
after configuration (of a CG Config Type 1) or activation (of a CG Config Type
2), without the need of receiving UL grant from the gNB.
The performance of dynamic grant (DG) scheduling has been compared against
configured grant (CG) scheduling. Particularly, the following schemes have
been evaluated:
\- Scheme 6.1.1: DG scheduling with SR followed by UL grant with BSR and data.
It is assumed that an SR is triggered upon arrival of a new XR packet in the
UE buffer. An UL resource is then granted to the UE to transmit BSR and a
number of UL data. A periodicity of SR and a size of initial UL grant may vary
and are indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.1.2: DG scheduling with SR followed by UL grant with BSR only. A
periodicity of SR may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table
B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.2: Pre-scheduling dynamic grant: The scheduling is based on
dynamic grants where it is assumed that the network is provided with XR
traffic periodicity. An initial grant to the UE when its traffic is expected
is transmitted (implementation-based learning) without using SR. A size of
initial UL grant may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table
B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.3: Dynamic scheduling with genie BSR (DG with genie BSR): The
scheduling is based on dynamic grants where it is assumed BSR is available
with zero delay at the scheduler when a new XR packet arrives in the UE
buffer, to be used for indicating UL grants to the UE. Hence, in this case, no
SR or BSR delay is assumed.
\- Scheme 6.4: Single CG configuration, where single PUSCH occasion per CG
period is pre-configured with certain periodicity without relying on SR. In
this scheme no scheduling delay is assumed. CG periodicity may vary and is
indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.5.1: Multiple CG configurations, where multiple PUSCH occasions
per CG period are pre-configured with certain periodicity without relying on
SR. In this scheme no scheduling delay is assumed. CG periodicity may vary and
is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.5.2: Multiple CG configurations, where multiple PUSCH occasions
per CG period are pre-configured with certain periodicity without relying on
SR. In this scheme scheduling delay for scheduling more packets with DG is
assumed as 2.5 ms. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in
Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.6.1: Hybrid CG+DG scheduling -- the scheduling is based on a
combined use of configured and dynamic grants. SR resources are not used.
Instead, CG resources are configured with a certain size in UL slot in order
to transmit BSR and data when a new XR packet arrives. Whenever a new XR
packet arrives in the UE buffer, the UE uses the nearest possible CG PUSCH
occasion for BSR transmission and possibly some amount of data. The network
can thus use the BSR to provide dynamic grants for the following data
transmission. CG periodicity and size of CG grant may vary and are indicated
separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.6.2: Hybrid CG+DG scheduling -- the scheduling is based on a
combined use of configured and dynamic grants. SR resources are not used.
Instead, CG resources are configured with a certain size in order to transmit
BSR only when a new XR packet arrives. It is assumed that one PUSCH occasion
per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity to align PUSCH
occasions with XR packets. Whenever a new XR packet arrives in the UE buffer,
the UE uses the nearest possible CG PUSCH occasion for BSR transmission. The
network can thus use the BSR to provide dynamic grants for the corresponding
data scheduling. CG periodicity and size of CG grant may vary and are
indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.6.3: Hybrid CG+DG scheduling -- the scheduling is based on a
combined use of configured and dynamic grants. SR resources are not used.
Instead, CG resources are configured with a certain size in UL slot in order
to transmit BSR and data when a new XR packet arrives. Whenever a new XR
packet arrives in the UE\'s buffer, the UE uses the nearest possible CG PUSCH
occasion for BSR transmission and possibly some amount of data. The network
can thus use the BSR to provide dynamic grants for the following data
transmission. _The PDCCH monitoring window for the dynamic grant is pre-
configured and associated with the CG_ PUSCH _occasion in each CG period._ The
enhanced BSR that the BSR report will be triggered at the first used CG PUSCH
occasion in each CG period to indicate to the gNB the remaining packet size is
assumed. _If the BSR is reported by the UE with the status \"not empty\", the
UE would monitor PDCCH in the subsequent slots for dynamic grant after XR
packet transmission with the CG resource, in which the dynamic grant is used
to schedule the_ _remaining data of XR packet. If the BSR is reported by the
UE with the status \"empty\", the UE would not monitor PDCCH in the subsequent
slots of the PDCCH monitoring window for XR packet transmission. Furthermore,
if the XR packets are completely transmitted during the monitoring window, the
UE can be indicated to go to sleep. If the XR packets arrive during the
monitoring window, the UE can be indicated to skip the PDCCH monitoring until
the packets arrive._ CG periodicity and size of CG grant may vary and are
indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.7: Enhanced CG with flexible resource allocation, where at least
one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity
without relying on SR. In this scheme, it is assumed the UE can indicate to
gNB unused CG PUSCH resources via CG-UCI. CG periodicity may vary and is
indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.8: Enhanced CG with dynamic adaptation of CG parameters and
indication of unused/used CG PUSCH occasion(s). In this scheme, the UE adjusts
CG parameters dynamically: MCS, number of PRBs, number of layers within the CG
resource. The UE indicates these scheduling parameters to the gNB via UCI
transmitted separately in the same CG resource, and whether the subsequent CG
PUSCH occasions will be used/unused until next XR packet arrival. It is
assumed that at least one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with
certain periodicity without relying on SR. CG periodicity may vary and is
indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.9: Enhanced CG with indication of unused/used CG PUSCH
occasion(s), where the UE only indicates if the subsequent CG PUSCH occasions
will be used/unused until next XR packet arrival. It is assumed that at least
one PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity
without relying on SR. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated separately in
Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.10: Enhanced CG with MAC CE based dynamic resource adjustment
indication. In this scheme, CG resource is used to carry MAC CE based dynamic
resource adjustment indication and video data, and resource adjustment
indication delay based on MAC CE is 2.5ms. It is assumed that at least one
PUSCH occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity to
align PUSCH occasions with XR packets without relying on SR. CG periodicity
may vary and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table
B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.11: Enhanced CG with UCI based dynamic resource adjustment
indication. In this scheme, CG resource is used to carry UCI based dynamic
resource adjustment indication and video data, and resource adjustment
indication delay based on UCI is 0.5ms. It is assumed that at least one PUSCH
occasion per CG period is pre-configured with certain periodicity to align
PUSCH occasions with XR packets without relying on SR. CG periodicity may vary
and is indicated separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.
\- Scheme 6.12: Enhanced CG with UCI based dynamic resource adjustment
indication. In this scheme, CG resource is used to carry UCI based dynamic
resource adjustment indication only, and the dynamic resource adjustment
indication is used to inform the gNB data volume of an XR packet or required
resources to transmit the XR packet. Resource adjustment indication delay
based on UCI is 0.5ms. It is assumed that one PUSCH occasion per CG period is
pre-configured with certain periodicity to align PUSCH occasions with XR
packets without relying on SR. CG periodicity may vary and is indicated
separately in Table B.1.6-1, Table B.1.6-2, Table B.1.6-3.

## B.1.7 Scheduling restrictions due to RRM measurements
This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results with and
without intra- and inter frequency RRM measurement restrictions. Scheduling
restrictions apply for the UEs during time-intervals where it is performing
intra-frequency RRM measurements at FR2, or gap assisted inter-frequency RRM
measurements. Such scheduling restrictions does not allow to transmit
PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS or receive PDCCH/PDSCH/CSI-RS. When XR frame arrival collides
with RRM measurements, the XR frame will be delayed for the duration of SMTC
window or measurement gap (MG).
The performance with SMTC/MG scheduling restrictions (scheme 7.2 and 7.4 in
Table B.1.7-1 and Table B.1.7-2) has been compared against no SMTC/MG
scheduling restrictions as well as with adaptation of MG period. Particularly,
the following schemes have been evaluated:
\- Scheme 7.1: Without SMTC scheduling restrictions. In this scheme, no
scheduling restrictions for FR2 intra-frequency measurements were assumed.
This can be realized via gNB-2-UE signalling to configure the UE with time-
mask where it shall always prioritize PDCCH/PDSCH decoding and/or PUSCH
transmission in line with XR traffic, even if colliding with SMTC windows.
Alternatively, the UE-to-gNB signalling to make the gNB scheduler aware of
when _s-MeasureConfig_ induced scheduling restrictions apply could be applied.
\- Scheme 7.2: With SMTC scheduling restrictions. In this scheme, scheduling
restrictions every 20 ms time period for an SMTC window of 5 ms for FR2 intra-
frequency measurements were assumed. In case the SMTC windows with scheduling
restrictions collide with time periods where the gNB would need to schedule
the XR transmission, XR frame transmission will be delayed.
\- Scheme 7.3: No scheduling restrictions during measurement gap. In this
scheme, no scheduling restrictions during measurement gap for inter-frequency
measurements were assumed.
\- Scheme 7.4: With scheduling restrictions during measurement gap. In this
scheme, scheduling restrictions for the duration of measurement gap length of
6 ms are applied. Measurement gaps (MG) are configured to allow UE to do
inter-frequency neighbour cell measurement and the corresponding RF tuning for
RRM purposes (e.g. mobility, load balancing, CA set-up). In case the MG with
scheduling restrictions collide with time periods where the gNB would need to
schedule the XR transmission, XR frame transmission will be delayed.
\- Scheme 7.5.1: Adaptation of MG period. The MG period is adapted to be 2
times when PCell RSRP is 2dB better than the best neighbour cell and 4 times
when PCell RSRP is 4dB better than the best neighbour cell. The UE speed is
30km/h.
\- Scheme 7.5.2 Adaptation of MG period. The MG period is adapted to be 4
times when PCell RSRP is 2dB better than the best neighbour cell and 8 times
when PCell RSRP is 4dB better than the best neighbour cell. The UE speed is
30km/h.

## B.1.8 Buffer status report
This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of
enhancements related to buffer status report (BSR).
The performance of legacy BSR (scheme 8.1 in Table B.1.8-1 and Table B.1.8-2)
has been compared against enhanced BSR schemes. Particularly, the following
schemes have been evaluated:
\- Scheme 8.1: Legacy dynamic scheduling with legacy BSR.
\- Scheme 8.2: BSR with precise buffer size, where new buffer status (BS)
table(s) with finer granularity is designed.
\- Scheme 8.3: XR-specific triggering mechanism of BSR report. In this scheme,
the pre-scheduling dynamic grant based on the XR awareness is considered and
XR specific PDCCH monitoring is aligned with the periodicity of XR packet
generation. The BSR is also enhanced to have XR-specific triggering mechanism
of BSR report to minimize the scheduling delay. The XR-specific BSR report
triggering mechanism is that the BSR report will be triggered at the 1^st^
PUSCH of each XR packet at each cycle to inform gNB the remaining packet size
to be transmitted after the 1^st^ PUSCH transmission of the XR traffic. When
gNB receive the BSR, gNB would schedule UE the UL PUSCH transmission until the
completion of XR packet delivery in this cycle.

## B.1.9 UL delay-aware scheduling
This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of
enhancements related to UL delay aware scheduling.
The performance proportional fair scheduling (scheme 9.1 in Table B.1.9-1) has
been compared against delay-aware scheduling. Particularly, the following
schemes have been evaluated:
\- Scheme 9.1: Proportional fair (PF) scheduling, where gNB uses PF
scheduling, i.e., the scheduling priority of each user is calculated as the
ratio of the instantaneous data rate over the historical data rate. The gNB
does not consider delay during scheduling.
\- Scheme 9.2: Delay-aware scheduling, where gNB is not aware of the exact UL
data arrival time and can only apply SR or BSR reception time for delay-aware
scheduling.
\- Scheme 9.3: Delay-aware scheduling, where gNB is aware of the exact data
arrival time and uses the exact data arrival time for delay-aware scheduling.

Based on the evaluation results in Table B.1.9-1 the following observations
can be made:
\- For FR1, DU, UL, with 100MHz bandwidth for AR single-stream traffic model,
10Mbps, 15ms PDB, 60 FPS, with MU-MIMO and 64TxRU, it is observed from Source
[Huawei] that the capacity is increased from 3 UEs per cell with proportional
fair scheduling to 3.2 UEs per cell with delay-aware scheduling, where gNB is
not aware of the exact data arrival time (capacity gain is 7%).
\- For FR1, DU, UL, with 100MHz bandwidth for AR single-stream traffic model,

scheduling, where gNB is not aware of the exact data arrival time to 3.8 UEs
per cell with delay-aware scheduling, where gNB is aware of the exact data
arrival time (capacity gain is 19%).
## B.1.10 XR-specific _playoutDelayForMediaStartup_ for gNB scheduling
awareness
This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of
enhancements related to gNB awareness about playoutDelayForMediaStartup and
appLayerBufferLevel, where the former is the waiting time that the user
experiences for media start-up and the latter is buffer level, which indicates
the playout duration for which media data of all active media components is
available starting from the current playout time, where.
The performance dynamic grant scheduling (scheme 10.1 in Table B.1.10-1) has
been compared against the scheme with playoutDelayForMediaStartup and
appLayerBufferLevel awareness. Particularly, the following schemes have been
evaluated:
\- Scheme 10.1: Dynamic grant scheduling.
\- Scheme 10.2: XR-specific _playoutDelayForMediaStartup scheme. In this
scheme,_ the **_playoutDelayForMediaStartup and appLayerBufferLevel_** is
shared by the UE with the gNB. The scheme assumes, the feedback of XR-specific
**_playoutDelayForMediaStartup and appLayerBufferLevel from UE_** would give
the gNB scheduler additional delay budget in scheduling the XR data
transmission to achieve additional link adaptation gain. For example, when the
**_reported appLayerBufferLevel is 3 frames, gNB scheduler extends PDB for
scheduling the XR packet on PDSCH for additional 50 ms._** gNB prioritizes the
UE scheduling based on the extended delay budged from the reported playout
delay size and buffer level, in which a group UEs in the same priority queue
are with the same length of playout delay.

# B.2 Power saving performance evaluation results
## B.2.1 Enhanced CDRX for semi-static periodicity alignment
This clause captures evaluation results for enhanced CDRX based on semi-static
periodicity alignment between CDRX and XR traffic. The following evaluations
were provided by companies:

CDRX On Duration and a number of DRX cycles after which the shifts should be
added.
\- Huawei evaluated configuring multiple start offsets for multiple On
Durations within each CDRX cycle to align with multiple XR data arrivals.
\- vivo evaluated multiple DRX configurations with different drx-StartOffset
values.
\- vivo evaluated one DRX cycle can contain multiple DRX On Durations based on
single DRX configuration.
\- Ericsson, vivo, OPPO, CATT, Intel, ZTE and Nokia evaluated the CDRX cycle
pattern with multiple cycle values (e.g., {16ms, 17ms, 17ms} for 60fps XR
video).
\- ZTE, MediaTek and Qualcomm evaluated uniform non-integer number CDRX cycles
with quantization operations in DRX formulas.
\- ZTE evaluated multiple CDRX configurations with staggered offsets to align

## B.2.7 Additional DRX active time
This clause captures evaluation results for additional DRX active time.
\- ZTE evaluated the extension for additional active time if UE does not
receive UE specific data scheduled by a PDCCH CRC scrambled by the XR-specific
RNTI within current active time.
\- OPPO evaluated additional On Duration triggered by dynamic signaling such
as a DCI to receive data that arrives after the On Duration expires.
\- Nokia evaluated the Extension of Active Time (EAT) to extend DRX active
time if XR frame does not arrive before the On Duration timer expires.
\- vivo compared the additional DRX active time and R17 PDCCH monitoring
adaptation scheme.

Based on the evaluation results in Table B.2.9-2, the following observations
can be made:
\- For FR1, DL only evaluation, InH, high load, multi-carrier, VR 30Mbps
traffic at 60fps with 10ms PDB, it is observed from CATT that:
\- Dynamic grant enhancement with XR-specific pre-scheduling scheme for XR
traffic carrier and IM traffic carrier provides:
\- mean power saving gain of 23.3% for the XR traffic carrier
\- mean power saving gain of 87.2% for the IM traffic carrier
\- mean capacity gain of -0.45% for the XR traffic carrier
\- enhanced C-DRX (16/17/17, 8, 4) as performance reference provides:
\- mean power saving gain of 19.0% for the XR traffic carrier
\- mean power saving gain of 27.4% for the IM traffic carrier
\- mean capacity gain of -100% for the XR traffic carrier
When XR and IM traffic transmitted in different carriers, the semi-static
C-DRX enhancement scheme with (16/17/17, 8, 4) degrade 59.8% PSG of carrier
with IM traffic compared with that of dynamic grant enhancement with XR-
specific pre-scheduling scheme.
## B.2.10 SPS+DG with UE power saving scheme
This clause captures evaluation results for the UE power saving scheme of SPS
enhancement with dynamic grant (DG):
\- CATT evaluated the periodic SPS occasion which provides wake-up timing for
XR UE during DRX OFF and subsequent dynamic grant window for the transmission
of XR packets. When XR packet arrives after the SPS occasion, gNB could
indicate UE to perform PDCCH skipping until XR packet arrival and to transform
to sleep state after XR packet transmission finishes.

## B.2.13 Non-scheduling DCI based PDCCH skipping and continuous PDCCH
skipping
This clause captures evaluation results for non-scheduling DCI based PDCCH
skipping and UE continuous PDCCH skipping:
\- CATT evaluated non-scheduling DCI based PDCCH skipping indication to reduce
unnecessary PDCCH monitoring when no XR data is scheduled for transmission. On
top of this, gNB configures a short PDCCH skipping duration and UE
continuously skips the PMOs until the DCI is successfully decoded at the time
of packet arrival.

Agreements from RAN2#119-e meeting:
\- RAN2 does not intend to ask RAN1 to change their simulation assumptions.
\- RAN2 should take SA2/SA4 work into account.
\- RAN2 assumes that PDU Set based parameters and PDU Set related information
may be used for better support of XR services. RAN2 can consider both UL and
DL directions.
\- RAN2 will study PDU Set based parameters and PDU Set related information
handling in Network and UE.
\- RAN2 to adopt the current SA2 definition of PDU Set as an application media
unit as working assumption, subjected to further guidance from SA2 and SA4.
\- XR awareness discussion in RAN2 should consider PDU set characteristics and
how to use the information available on those (for UL and/or DL). Can also
consider how to handle data bursts.
\- RAN2 can study e.g. periodicity, arrival time, jitter and frame-size
variations for XR awareness to enable power savings and capacity enhancements.
Can study also how often such parameters change (i.e. how dynamic they are).
\- RAN2 can consider how PDU sets can be mapped to DRBs (FFS if SA2 discussion
on PDU set mapping to QoS (sub-)flows impacts this).
\- RAN2 to focus on the following issues for power saving, as well necessary
parameters XR-awareness to support such enhancements, i.e.:
\- DRX enhancements to address the issues of DRX cycle mismatch and jitter;
\- Identify necessary parameters from CN for XR-awareness for power saving.
\- Enhancements to Rel-17 PDCCH adaptation can be discussed based on RAN1
feedback, if they have any RAN2 impact.
\- RAN2-specific aspects can be studied based on contributions (e.g. multiple
XR traffic flows with different periodicities, SFN wrap-around, RAN2-specific
CDRX aspects, ...).
\- As starting point, RAN2 can further discuss the solutions in TR 38.838 that
can impact on L2 operation (e.g., BSR, LCP, assistance information for
scheduling, packet discarding, prioritization) for XR-specific capacity
improvement. RAN2-specific solutions are not precluded (even if RAN1 hasn\'t
discussed them before).
\- Enhancement to SPS/CG should be justified for XR scheduling and should be
evaluated against dynamic grant (DG) scheduling which should be considered as
baseline. Should justify why enhancements are needed.
\- RAN2 considers SPS enhancements may not be needed in Rel-18 XR since PDCCH
capacity is not assumed to be a problem for XR. FFS if SPS has some power
consumption benefits.
# C.2 RAN2#119bis-e
Agreements from RAN2#119bis-e meeting:
\- From RAN2 viewpoint, the following information would be useful for PDU set
handling in UL and DL:
\- Semi-static information (from CN to RAN): At least PSER and PSDB;
\- Dynamic information: At least identifying which PDU belongs to which data
burst/PDU set is also needed, including means to determine at least PDU set
boundaries.
\- Capture the models 1a/b, 2a/b (from R2-2209777) in TR and indicate what is
possible in current specifications and how. FFS how LCH options work in each
case.
\- SDAP maps each data packet in a PDU set to a single PDCP SDU, as in legacy
(i.e. each PDU is only mapped to a single SDU).
\- HARQ and RLC re-/transmissions for XR traffic are done as in legacy (i.e.
they are not based on XR PDU sets).
\- For UE transmitter, the PDCP discard should be performed per PDU set basis.
\- For UE transmitter, the PDCP discard is managed per SDU for PDU set, the
PDCP entity discards all PDCP SDUs associated with the PDU set.
\- At least RRC pre-configuration and switching of configurations of DRX could
be considered for enhancements of XR power saving. Other solutions are not
precluded and can be further discussed.
\- Introduce new BS table(s) to reduce the quantisation errors (e.g. for high
bit rates). FFS how new BSR tables are created and how they impact BSR formats
(can be discussed in WI phase).
\- Delay information consists of at least \"remaining time\".
\- RAN2 considers a delay information is useful for XR. FFS if dynamic
reporting from UE to network (e.g. via BSR) is needed, or whether PSDB is
sufficient. If we have delay information, it needs to distinguish how much
data is buffered for which delay value. Stage-3 details (e.g. what\'s
contained, how the triggering is done) can be discussed in the WI phase.
\- If we have delay information reporting, RAN2 aims to define how the UE
determines the \"remaining time\" in the delay information.
\- Current CG configurations can be reused for UL XR traffic. FFS if
enhancements are needed (RAN1 is already discussing something). RAN2 can
discuss this in the next meeting.
\- RAN2 can discuss potential enhancement to provide some assistant
information on UL XR traffic for CG configurations at the gNB. FFS whether
TSCAI can already provide all necessary information.
\- RAN2 discuss whether additional traffic or QoS related information on
downlink traffic beyond what has been agreed by SA2 needs to be provided to
RAN for UE power savings.
\- RAN2 study what traffic and QoS related information on uplink traffic (e.g.
counterpart of what has been agreed by SA2) should be provided to RAN for UE
power savings and how the information may be provided to RAN.
\- Capture in TR that traffic parameters and Jitter are semi-static info.
\- Can capture also SA2 agreements related to how they impact RAN2.
# C.3 RAN2#120
Agreements from RAN2#120 meeting:
\- N1N excluded.
\- Splitting DRB into multiple LCH (DC like) FFS.
\- Should try to understand why we would need to treat PDU sets differently
over the radio and why different PDU sets are muxed over same flows. Also need
to understand need for reordering. LS to SA2/SA4 sent in R2-2213351.
\- Agree that UE identifies PDU Sets / Bursts.
\- In-band marking not needed. Further information considered if BSR is not
enough.
\- Handling of discard FFS.
\- Regarding making LCP delay aware:
\- If delay-aware LCP is introduced, need the ability to turn it off;
\- SRBs not impacted.
\- Not considered further unless fundamental issues are identified.
\- RAN2 to support timer-based discarding of UL transmit side of PDCP PDU/SDUs
of a PDU set. FFS how this is modelled in PDCP specification, can be discussed
in WI phase.
\- RAN2 aims to allow XR frame rates that correspond to non-integer
periodicities in at least semi-static manner (e.g. RRC). Details can be left
to WI phase.
\- RAN2 thinks we need one or more additional BSR table(s) for XR. FFS whether
these are static (=specified) or dynamic (e.g. generated, differs according to
some RRC parameter), can be discussed in WI phase.
\- RAN2 will introduce data volume information associated with delay
information (e.g. remaining time) in a MAC CE. FFS if this is extension of BSR
or new format. FFS how to do that (e.g. what exactly is reported) and how to
ensure this information is up-to-date e.g. considering UL scheduling delay.
\- RAN2 needs to discuss additional BSR triggering conditions to allow timely
availability of buffer status information at gNB. This can be discussed in WI
phase.
\- RAN2 sees some benefit from CG to XR services. RAN2 will address
enhancements triggered by RAN1 work.
\- RAN2 agrees some assistance information can be beneficial (e.g.
periodicity, packet size). RAN2 assumes baseline could be TSCAI (pending SA2
conclusions), can discuss during WI phase whether something additional is
needed on top of that. If any assistance information is needed, its definition
should be standardized.
\- RAN2 thinks all information may not be always available at UE application.
# C.4 RAN2#121
Agreements from RAN2#121 meeting:
\- RAN2 thinks that how PSER is enforced is up to network implementation.
\- Introduce UL PDU Set Importance. How UE derives this will be handled in UE
implementation.
\- Can indicate that in RAN2 considers PDU set concept applicable to both UL
and DL in LS to SA2.
\- RAN2 thinks UL jitter may be present for XR (e.g. for tethering use cases).
It is unclear how network would use UL jitter information (depends on what
would be signalled and would anyway be up to network implementation).
\- RAN2 intends to support tethering use case for XR. This may require
signalling of some UL traffic arrival information from UE to network.
\- Since we already agreed to not support delay-aware LCP, RAN2 aims not to
introduce changes to LCP due to PDU prioritization.
\- RAN2 thinks PSI can be useful for PDU set-based discard. RAN2 aims to
introduce a mechanism to allow UE to handle discarding of packets with
different PSI in case of congestion. FFS for other cases.
\- Support of RLC bearer splitting should be limited to existing cases (e.g.
PDCP duplication), no new XR-specific functionality.
