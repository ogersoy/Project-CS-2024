# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship with other core specifications
The present document is a single-RAT specification for a SAN, covering RF
characteristics and minimum performance requirements. Conducted and radiated
core requirements are defined for the SAN architectures and SAN types defined
in clause 4.3.
The applicability of each requirement is described in clause 4.6.
## 4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling the
test requirements specified in the conformance specification TS 38.181 [3].
The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 38.181 [3] define test
tolerances. These test tolerances are individually calculated for each test.
The test tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements in this
specification to create test requirements. For some requirements, including
regulatory requirements, the test tolerance is set to zero.
The measurement results returned by the test system are compared - without any
modification - against the test requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation ITUâ€‘R M.1545 [4].
## 4.3 Requirement reference points
### 4.3.1 SAN type 1-H
For _SAN type 1-H_ , the requirements are defined for two points of reference,
signified by radiated requirements and conducted requirements.
{width="5.2in" height="2.169139326334208in"}
Figure 4.3.1-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for _SAN type 1-H_
Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the radiated
interface is referred to as the _Radiated Interface Boundary_ (RIB). Radiated
requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial)
characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each
requirement.
Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of _TAB
connectors_ at the _transceiver array boundary_ , which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.
The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver functionality
receiving and transmitting modulated signal to ensure radio links with users.
The satellite payload is composed by a transceiver unit array and a composite
antenna array. The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific
number of transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units.
The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the RF
power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array, and/or
distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to the
transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.
How a conducted requirement is applied to the _transceiver array boundary_ is
detailed in the respective requirement clause.
### 4.3.2 SAN type 1-O
For _SAN type 1-O_ , the radiated characteristics are defined over the air
(OTA), where the _operating band_ specific radiated interface is referred to
as the _Radiated Interface Boundary_ (RIB). Radiated requirements are also
referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which the
OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement.

## 5.3 Satellite Access Node channel bandwidth
### 5.3.1 General
The _SAN channel bandwidth_ supports a single RF carrier in the uplink or
downlink at the SAN. Different _UE channel bandwidths_ may be supported within
the same spectrum for transmitting to and receiving from UEs connected to the
SAN. The placement of the _UE channel bandwidth_ is flexible but can only be
completely within the _SAN channel bandwidth_. The SAN shall be able to
transmit to and/or receive from one or more UE bandwidth parts that are
smaller than or equal to the number of carrier resource blocks on the RF
carrier, in any part of the carrier resource blocks.
The relationship between the channel bandwidth, the guard band and the
_transmission bandwidth configuration_ is shown in figure 5.3.1-1.
.

### 5.3.4 RB alignment
For each _SAN channel bandwidth_ and each numerology, _SAN transmission
bandwidth configuration_ must fulfil the minimum guard band requirement
specified in clause 5.3.3.
For each numerology, its common resource blocks are specified in clause
4.4.4.3 in TS 38.211 [5], and the starting point of its _transmission
bandwidth configuration_ on the common resource block grid for a given channel
bandwidth is indicated by an offset to "Reference point A" in the unit of the
numerology.
For each numerology, all _UE transmission bandwidth configurations_ indicated
to UEs served by the SAN by higher layer parameter _carrierBandwidth_ defined
in TS 38.331 [6] shall fall within the _SAN transmission bandwidth
configuration_.

## 5.4 Channel arrangement
### 5.4.1 Channel spacing
#### 5.4.1.1 Channel spacing for adjacent carriers
The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the size
of the frequency block available and the _SAN channel bandwidths_. The nominal
channel spacing between two adjacent SAN carriers is defined as following:
\- For SAN FR1 _operating bands_ with 100 kHz channel raster,
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the _SAN channel bandwidths_ of
the two respective SAN carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted depending
on the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular deployment
scenario.
### 5.4.2 Channel raster
#### 5.4.2.1 NR-ARFCN and channel raster
The global frequency raster defines a set of _RF reference frequencies_
F~REF~. The _RF reference frequency_ is used in signalling to identify the
position of RF channels, SS blocks and other elements. The global frequency
raster is defined for all frequencies from 0 to 100 GHz. The granularity of
the global frequency raster is Î”F~Global~.
_RF reference frequencies_ are designated by an NR Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) in the range [0...3279165] on the global frequency
raster. The relation between the NR-ARFCN and the _RF reference frequency_
F~REF~ in MHz is given by the following equation, where F~REF-Offs~ and N~Ref-
Offs~ are given in table 5.4.2.1-1 and N~REF~ is the NR-ARFCN.
F~REF~ = F~REF-Offs~ + Î”F~Global~ (N~REF~ -- N~REF-Offs~)

0 -- 3000 5 0 0 0 -- 599999
The _channel raster_ defines a subset of _RF reference frequencies_ that can
be used to identify the RF channel position in the uplink and downlink. The
_RF reference frequency_ for an RF channel maps to a resource element on the
carrier. For each _operating band_ , a subset of frequencies from the global
frequency raster are applicable for that band and forms a channel raster with
a granularity Î”F~Raster~, which may be equal to or larger than Î”F~Global~.
The mapping between the _channel raster_ and corresponding resource element is
given in clause 5.4.2.2. The applicable entries for each _operating band_ are
defined in clause 5.4.2.3.
#### 5.4.2.2 Channel raster to resource element mapping
The mapping between the _RF reference frequency_ on the channel raster and the
corresponding resource element is given in table 5.4.2.2-1 and can be used to
identify the RF channel position. The mapping depends on the total number of
RBs that are allocated in the channel and applies to both UL and DL. The
mapping must apply to at least one numerology supported by the SAN.
Table 5.4.2.2-1: Channel Raster to Resource Element Mapping
                                   $$N_{\text{RB}}\text{mod}2 = 0$$   $$N_{\text{RB}}\text{mod}2 = 1$$

Resource element index 0 6 Physical resource block number
k, and N~RB~ are as defined in TS 38.211 [5].
#### 5.4.2.3 Channel raster entries for each _operating band_
The RF channel positions on the channel raster in each SAN _operating band_
are given through the applicable NR-ARFCN in table 5.4.2.3-1 for FR1, using
the channel raster to resource element mapping in clause 5.4.2.2.
For SAN _operating bands_ with 100 kHz channel raster, Î”F~Raster~ = 20 Ã—
Î”F~Global~. In this case, every 20^th^ NR-ARFCN within the _operating band_
are applicable for the channel raster within the _operating band_ and the step
size for the channel raster in table 5.4.2.3-1 is given as \.

### 5.4.3 Synchronization raster
#### 5.4.3.1 Synchronization raster and numbering
The synchronization raster indicates the frequency positions of the
synchronization block that can be used by the UE for system acquisition when
explicit signalling of the synchronization block position is not present.
A global synchronization raster is defined for all frequencies. The frequency
position of the SS block is defined as SS~REF~ with corresponding number GSCN.
The parameters defining the SS~REF~ and GSCN for all the frequency ranges are
in table 5.4.3.1-1.

## 6.5 Transmitted signal quality
### 6.5.1 Frequency error
#### 6.5.1.1 General
Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual SAN
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be used
for RF frequency and data clock generation.
For _SAN type 1-H_ this requirement shall be applied at each _TAB connector_
supporting transmission in the _operating band._
#### 6.5.1.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-H_
The modulated carrier frequency of each carrier configured by the SAN shall be

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured carrier
signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be expressed as Error
Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the
difference between the ideal symbols and the measured symbols after the
equalization. This difference is called the error vector. Details about how

## 6.6 Unwanted emissions
### 6.6.1 General
Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious emissions
according to ITU definitions [2]. In ITU terminology, out of band emissions
are unwanted emissions immediately outside the _SAN channel bandwidth_
resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but
excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are
caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but
exclude out of band emissions.
The out-of-band emissions requirement for the SAN transmitter is specified
both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and out-of-band
emissions (OOBE). There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.
Table 6.6.1-1: void
For _SAN type 1-H_ the unwanted emission requirements are applied to sum of
power over all _TAB connectors_ for all the configurations supported by the
SAN, except for occupied bandwidth in subclause 6.6.2.
### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth
#### 6.6.2.1 General
The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below the
lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted are each
equal to a specified percentage Î²/2 of the total mean transmitted power. See
also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 [8].
The value of Î²/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.
The minimum requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also be
regional requirements to declare the occupied bandwidth according to the
definition in the present clause.
For SAN _type 1-H_ this requirement shall be applied at each _TAB connector_
supporting transmission in the _operating band._
#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-H_
The occupied bandwidth for each carrier shall be less than the _SAN channel
bandwidth_.
### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio
#### 6.6.3.1 General
Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean
power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power
centred on an adjacent channel frequency.
The requirements shall apply outside the _SAN RF Bandwidth_ or _Radio
Bandwidth_ whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier or
multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's
specification.
#### 6.6.3.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-H_
The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal (BW~Config~)
centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter centred on the adjacent
channel frequency according to the tables below.
The ACLR shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.6.3.2-1/2.

interfering signal apply relative to the lower _SAN RF Bandwidth_ edge or
_sub-block_ edge inside a _sub-block gap_ , and the positive offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the upper _SAN RF Bandwidth_ edge or
_sub-block_ edge inside a _sub-block gap_.

# 10 Radiated receiver characteristics
## 10.1 General
Radiated receiver characteristics are specified at RIB for _SAN type 1-H or_
_SAN type 1-O_ , with full complement of transceivers for the configuration in
normal operating condition.
Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for the radiated
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 10:
\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.
\- The requirements shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) ON.
\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver characteristics
do not assume HARQ retransmissions.
\- When SAN is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the throughput
requirements are applicable for each received carrier.
\- For ACS and blocking characteristics, the negative offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the lower _SAN RF Bandwidth_ edge, and
the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the upper
_SAN RF Bandwidth_ edge.
\- Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.
NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the SAN in FDD operation is configured
to transmit and receive at the same time.
For FR1 requirements which are to be met over the _OTA REFSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Î”~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10*log~10~(BeW~Î¸,REFSENS*~BeW~Ï†,REFSENS~) dB for the
reference direction
and
Î”~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10*log~10~(BeW~Î¸,REFSENS*~BeW~Ï†,REFSENS~) dB for all
other directions
For requirements which are to be met over the _minSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Î”~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)
## 10.2 OTA sensitivity
#### 10.2.1 General
The OTA sensitivity requirement is a _directional requirement_ based upon the
declaration of one or more _OTA sensitivity direction declarations_ (OSDD),
related to a _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type 1-O_ receiver.
The _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type 1-O_ may optionally be capable of
redirecting/changing the _receiver target_ by means of adjusting SAN settings
resulting in multiple _sensitivity RoAoA_. The _sensitivity RoAoA_ resulting
from the current SAN settings is the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
If the SAN is capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the OSDD
then the OSDD shall include:
\- _SAN channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level applicable to any
active _sensitivity RoAoA_ inside the _receiver target redirection range_ in
the OSDD.
\- A declared _receiver target redirection range_ , describing all the angles
of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative settings in
the SAN.
\- Five declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TS 38.181 [3].
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 1: Some of the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ may coincide depending on the
redirection capability.
NOTE 2: In addition to the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ , several _sensitivity
RoAoA_ may be implicitly defined by the _receiver target redirection range_
without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.
If the SAN is not capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the
OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _SAN channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to the _sensitivity RoAoA_ in the OSDD.
\- One declared active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 3: For SAN without target redirection capability, the declared (fixed)
_sensitivity RoAoA_ is always the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 10.2.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_
For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the active
_sensitivity RoAoA_ of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as described in
clause 7.2 shall be met when the level of the arriving signal is equal to the
minimum EIS level in the respective declared set of EIS level and _SAN channel
bandwidth_.
## 10.3 OTA reference sensitivity level
### 10.3.1 General {#general-54 .list-paragraph}
The OTA REFSENS requirement is a _directional requirement_ and is intended to
ensure the minimum OTA reference sensitivity level for a declared _OTA REFSENS
RoAoA_. The OTA reference sensitivity power level EIS~REFSENS~ is the minimum
mean power received at the RIB at which a reference performance requirement
shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel.
The OTA REFSENS requirement shall apply to each supported polarization, under
the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 10.3.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_ {#minimum-requirement-for-
san-type-1-o-10 .list-paragraph}
The throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in the corresponding table and annex A.1 when
the OTA test signal is at the corresponding EIS~REFSENS~ level and arrives

### 10.5.1 OTA adjacent channel selectivity
#### 10.5.1.1 General
OTA Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver\'s ability
to receive an OTA wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the

### 10.5.2 OTA in-band blocking
The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.
## 10.6 OTA out-of-band blocking
### 10.6.1 General
The OTA out-of-band blocking characteristics are a measure of the receiver
unit ability to receive a wanted signal at the _RIB_ at its assigned channel
in the presence of an unwanted interferer.
### 10.6.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_
#### 10.6.2.1 General minimum requirement {#general-minimum-requirement .list-
paragraph}
The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
the received signal and the interfering signal are from the same direction and
are within the _minSENS RoAoA_.
The wanted signal applies to each supported polarization, under the assumption
of _polarization match._ The interferer shall be _polarization matched_ in-
band and the polarization maintained for out-of-band frequencies.
For OTA wanted and OTA interfering signals provided at the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.2.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:
\- The throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel. The reference measurement channel for the OTA wanted
signal is identified in clause 10.3.2 for each _SAN channel bandwidth_ and
further specified in annex A.1.
For _SAN type 1-O_ the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 30 MHz
to F~UL,low~ - Î”f~OOB~ and from F~UL,high~ + Î”f~OOB~ up to 12750 MHz,
including the downlink frequency range of the SAN _operating band_. The
Î”f~OOB~ for _SAN type 1-O_ is defined in table 10.6.2.1-2.

> \- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays
>
> \- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
> clause 7.7.2 in TR 38.901 [12].
\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is done
simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the delay
resolution.
\- Step 5: If multiple Rayleigh taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge
them by calculating their linear power sum.
\- Step 6: If there is a LOS path in the model, the power for all paths could
be slightly adjusted to keep the RMS delay spread is close to target delay
spread and mean power is 0dB.
\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB -8.8 dB)
\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap merge,
adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the power of the
last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.
\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest Rayleigh tap to 0 dB when there is no LOS
path in the model.
Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification steps
may differ from the values in tables G.2.1.1-2 and G.2.1.1-3 for the
corresponding model.
Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the linear
domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the linear domain.
### D.2.1.1 Delay profiles for FR1
The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low, medium
and high delay spread environment. The resulting model parameters are
specified in table D.2.1.1-1 and the tapped delay line models are specified in
tables D.2.1.1-2 \~ D.2.1.1-4.

## D.2.3 MIMO channel correlation matrices
The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex D.2.3 apply for the
antenna configuration using uniform linear arrays at both SAN and UE and for
the antenna configuration using cross polarized antennas.
### D.2.3.1 MIMO correlation matrices using Uniform Linear Array
The MIMO channel correlation matrices defined in annex D.2.3.1 apply for the
antenna configuration using uniform linear array (ULA) at both SAN and UE.

parameters, _Î±_ and _Î²_ in table D.2.3.1.1-3 defines the spatial correlation
between the antennas at the SAN and UE respectively.

correlation matrix can still be expressed as the Kronecker product of
$R_{\text{UE}}$ and $R_{\text{SAN}}\ $according to ${R_{\text{spat}} = \
R_{\text{UE}} \otimes R}_{\text{SAN}}$.

and low correlation but performance requirements exist only for low
correlation.
D.3 Moving propagation conditions
Figure D.3-1 illustrates the moving propagation conditions for the test of the
UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the reference
timing and the first tap is according Equation (D.3-1). The timing difference
between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Î”Ï„ - (_T~A~_ âˆ’31)Ã—16Ã—64 _T~c~_
for 15kHz SCS, Î”Ï„ - (_T~A~_ âˆ’31)Ã—16Ã—32 _T~c~_ for 30kHz SCS and Î”Ï„ - (_T~A~_
