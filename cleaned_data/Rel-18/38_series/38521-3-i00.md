transmission and reception; Part 1: Range 1 Standalone\" (the present
document).
\- TS 38.521-2 [9]: \"NR; User Equipment (UE) conformance specification; Radio
transmission and reception; Part 2: Range 2 Standalone\".
\- TS 38.521-3: \"NR; User Equipment (UE) conformance specification; Radio
transmission and reception; Part 3: Range 1 and Range 2 Interworking operation
with other radios\".
\- TS 38.521-4 [22]: \"NR; User Equipment (UE) conformance specification;

# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the measurement procedures for the conformance
test of the user equipment (UE) that contain RF characteristics for carrier
aggregation between Range 1 and Range 2 and additional requirements for EN-DC,
NE-DC and NGEN-DC.
The requirements are listed in different clauses only if the corresponding
parameters deviate. More generally, tests are only applicable to those mobiles
that are intended to support the appropriate functionality. To indicate the
circumstances in which tests apply, this is noted in the \"_definition and
applicability_ \" part of the test.
For example only Release 15 and later UE declared to support 5G-NR shall be
tested for this functionality. In the event that for some tests different
conditions apply for different releases, this is indicated within the text of
the test itself.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
TS 38.101-3 [4] is interwork specification for NR UE, covering RF
characteristics and minimum performance requirements. Conformance to TS
38.101-3 [4] is demonstrated by fulfilling the test requirements specified in
the present document.
The Minimum Requirements given in TS 38.101-3 [4] make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty (MU). The present document defines test tolerances
(TT). These test tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The
test tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements in TS 38.101-3 [4]
to create test requirements. For some requirements, including regulatory
requirements, the test tolerance is set to zero.
The measurement results returned by the test system are compared - without any
modification - against the test requirements as defined by various levels of
\"Shared Risk\" principle as described below.
a) Core specification value is not relaxed by any relaxation value (TT=0). For
each single measurement, the probability of a borderline good UE being judged
as FAIL equals the probability of a borderline bad UE being judged as PASS.
> \- Test tolerances equal to 0 (TT=0) are considered in this specification.
b) Core specification value is relaxed by a relaxation value (TT>0). For each
single measurement, the probability of a borderline bad UE being judged as
PASS is greater than the probability of a borderline good UE being judged as
FAIL.
> \- Test tolerances lower than measurement uncertainty and greater than 0 (0
> \
> \- Test tolerances high up to measurement uncertainty (TT = MU) are
> considered in this specification which is also known as \"Never fail a good
> DUT\" principle.
c) Core specification value is tightened by a stringent value (TT\ \- Test tolerances lower than 0 (TT\ specification.
The \"Never fail a good DUT\" and the \"Shared Risk\" principles are defined
in Recommendation ITU‑R M.1545 [21].
## 4.2 Applicability of minimum requirements
a) In TS 38.101-3 [4] the Minimum Requirements are specified as general
requirements and additional requirements. Where the Requirement is specified
as a general requirement, the requirement is mandated to be met in all
scenarios
b) For specific scenarios for which an additional requirement is specified, in
addition to meeting the general requirement, the UE is mandated to meet the
additional requirements.
c) The spurious emissions power requirements are for the long-term average of
the power. For the purpose of reducing measurement uncertainty, it is
acceptable to average the measured power over a period of time sufficient to
reduce the uncertainty due to the statistical nature of the signal.
d) Terminal that supports EN-DC or NE-DC configuration shall meet E-UTRA
requirements as specified in TS 36.101 [5] and NR requirements as in TS
38.101-1 [2] and TS 38.101-2 [3] unless otherwise specified in TS 38.101-3
[4].
e) All the requirements for intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous EN-DC or
NE-DC apply under the assumption of the same uplink-downlink and special
subframe configurations in the E-UTRA and slot format indicated by UL-DL-
configurationCommon and UL-DL-configurationDedicated in the NR for the EN-DC
or NE-DC, a time offset between the two RATs configurations may be required.
f) For EN-DC or NE-DC combinations with CA configurations for E-UTRA and/or
NR, all the requirements for E-UTRA and/or NR all the requirements for E-UTRA
and/or NR intra-band contiguous and non-contiguous CA apply under the
assumption of the same slot format indicated by UL-DL-configurationCommon and
UL-DL-configurationDedicated in the PSCell and SCells for NR and the same
uplink-downlink and special subframe configurations in PCell and SCells for
E-UTRA.
A terminal which supports an EN-DC or NE-DC configuration shall support:
\- If any subsets of the EN-DC or NE-DC configuration do not specify its own
bandwidth combination sets in 5.3B, then the terminal shall support the same
E-UTRA bandwidth combination sets it signals the support for in E-UTRA CA
configuration part of E-UTRA -- NR DC and shall support the same NR bandwidth
combination sets it signals the support for in NR CA configuration part of
E-UTRA -- NR DC.
\- Else if one of the subsets of the EN-DC or NE-DC configuration specify its
own bandwidth combination sets in 5.3B, then the terminal shall support a
product set of channel bandwidth for each band specified by E-UTRA bandwidth
combination sets, NR bandwidth combination sets, and EN-DC or NE-DC bandwidth
combination sets it signals the support.
A terminal which supports an inter-band EN-DC or NE-DC configuration with a
certain UL configuration shall support the all lower order DL configurations
of the lower order EN-DC or NE-DC combinations, which have this certain UL
configuration and the fallbacks of this UL configuration.
A terminal which supports NE-DC configurations shall meet the minimum
requirements for corresponding EN-DC configuration, unless otherwise
specified.
For CA or DC configurations, which include FR2 intra-band CA combinations with
multiple FR2 subblocks, where at least one of the subblocks is contiguous CA
combination.
\- if the field _partialFR2-FallbackRX-Req_ is not present, the UE shall meet
all applicable UE RF requirements for the highest order CA configuration and
all associated fallback CA configurations;
\- if the field _partialFR2-FallbackRX-Req_ is present, for each FR2 intra-
band CA configuration with multiple sub-blocks that the UE indicates support
for explicitly in UE capability signalling: the in-gap UE RF requirements in
clauses 7.5A, 7.5B, 7.6A, 7.6B apply as the equivalent requirements for the
associated fallback FR2 intra-band CA configurations with the same number of
sub-blocks, where at least one of the sub-blocks consists of a contiguous CA
configuration. The UE shall meet all applicable UE RF requirements for
fallback CA configurations with a lesser number of sub-blocks;
\- regardless of the field _partialFR2-FallbackRX-Req_ , the UE shall meet all
DL out-of-gap requirements for all lower order fallback CA configurations.
Terminal that supports inter-band NR-DC between FR1 and FR2 configuration
shall meet the requirements for corresponding CA configuration (suffix A),
unless otherwise specified.

## 4.4 Test points analysis
The information on test point analysis and test point selection including
number of test points for each test case is shown in TR 38.905 [7] clause 4.3.
## 4.5 Applicability and test coverage rules
## 4.5.0 General
(1) The applicability and test coverage rules for Non-Standalone (NSA) only
capable devices shall include the following:
a) For each NR band in a device; test all the EN-DC or NE-DC exception test
requirements as per test procedures in this specification.
b) Test all the EN-DC or NE-DC FR2 non-exception test requirements in this
specification with test procedures which refer appropriately back to TS
38.521-2 [9] for each NR band. Test only one EN-DC or NE-DC combination per
FR2 band for each EN-DC or NE-DC configuration as defined in clause 5.5B of TS
38.101-3 [4] using LTE anchor agnostic approach.
c) Test all the EN-DC or NE-DC FR1 non-exception test requirements in this
specification with test procedures which refer appropriately back to TS
38.521-1 [8] for each NR band. Test only one EN-DC or NE-DC combination per
FR1 band for each EN-DC or NE-DC configuration as defined in clause 5.5B of
38.101-3 [4] using LTE anchor agnostic approach.
(2) The applicability and test coverage rules for Standalone (SA) and NSA
capable devices shall include the following:
a) For each NR band in a device, test all the EN-DC or NE-DC exception test
requirements as per test procedures in this specification.
b) Test all the Standalone FR2 test requirements as per test procedures in TS
38.521-2 [9] for each NR band. This also fulfils coverage for all non-
exception EN-DC or NE-DC FR2 test requirements for that NR band and need not
be retested. If Standalone FR2 cannot be tested (due to test case not being
complete), then test in EN-DC or NE-DC mode following (1) b) above.
c) Test all the Standalone FR1 test requirements as per test procedures in TS
38.521-1 [8] for each NR band. This also fulfils coverage for all non-
exception EN-DC or NE-DC FR1 test requirements for that NR band and need not
be retested. If Standalone FR1 cannot be tested (due to test case not being
complete or if the UE does not support the band in SA mode), then test in EN-
DC or NE-DC mode following (1)c) above.
### 4.5.1 Test coverage across 5G NR connectivity options
The test cases in this specification cover both NR/5GC (including FR1+FR2 CA
or FR1+FR2 NR-DC) as well as EN-DC, NE-DC and NGEN-DC testing. Below shall be
the understanding with respect to coverage across 5G NR connectivity options:
1) Unless otherwise stated within the test case, it shall be understood that
test requirements are agnostic of the EN-DC, NE-DC and NGEN-DC connectivity
options configured within the test. The test coverage across the EN-DC, NE-DC
and NGEN-DC connectivity options shall be considered fulfilled by executing
the test case in one of these connectivity options. In the case of non-
exception requirements, test coverage of NE-DC is fulfilled by execution of
NR/5GC connectivity option test cases.
2) EN-DC is the default connectivity option used for EN-DC, NE-DC and NGEN-DC
test cases.
3) If a UE does not support EN-DC, any other supported connectivity option of
NE-DC or NGEN-DC can be configured to execute the test. The leverage rule
detailed in (1) would apply.

Table 4.5.1-2: Void
## 4.6 E-UTRA configuration for EN-DC FR1 tests applying the E-UTRA anchor-
agnostic approach
This clause applies to EN-DC test cases where E-UTRA anchor needs to be
configured as per the anchor-agnostic approach outlined in clauses 6.1 and 7.1
of TS 38.101-3 [4].The LTE anchor-agnostic approach is defined as measurements
on the NR carrier under conditions where the LTE anchor resources do not
interfere with NR operation. The configuration defined in this clause ensures
establishment of such conditions.
For baseline configuration, the E-UTRA carrier will be configured for each
test case in clauses 6 and 7 as defined in the equivalent standalone E-UTRA
test in TS 36.521-1 [10]. However, the below exceptions defined in Table
4.6-1, 4.6-2, 4.6-3, 4.6-4 and 4.6-5 are applied to ensure that the E-UTRA
anchor resources do not interfere with NR operation.
For EN-DC within FR1 band combinations with multiple E-UTRA component
carriers, it is sufficient to configure any one E-UTRA carrier from the
carrier group whenever it is determined that anchor agnostic approach can be
applied. Unless otherwise stated, the number of component carriers (CCs)
listed in the test case titles of Clause 6 and clause 7 shall refer to the
number of component carriers configured within the test case.

## 4.7 E-UTRA configuration for EN-DC FR2 tests applying the E-UTRA anchor-
agnostic approach
This clause applies to EN-DC test cases where E-UTRA anchor needs to be
configured as per the anchor-agnostic approach outlined in clauses 6.1 and 7.1
of TS 38.101-3 [4].The LTE anchor-agnostic approach is defined as measurements
on the NR carrier under conditions where the LTE anchor resources do not
interfere with NR operation. The configuration defined in this clause ensures
establishment of such conditions.
For baseline configuration, the E-UTRA carrier will be configured for each
test case in clauses 6 and 7 as defined in the equivalent standalone E-UTRA
test in TS 36.521-1 [10]. However, the below exceptions defined in Table 4.7-1
to 4.7-7 are applied to ensure that the E-UTRA anchor resources do not
interfere with NR operation.
Since the E-UTRA link is always a functional link when testing EN-DC including
FR2 band combinations, it is sufficient to configure any one E-UTRA carrier
from the carrier group, irrespective of the number of E-UTRA carriers in the
EN-DC combination under test. Unless otherwise stated, the number of component
carriers (CCs) listed in the test case titles of Clause 6 and clause 7 shall
refer to the number of component carriers configured within the test case.

# 5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
## 5.1 General
The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the operating
bands and channel bandwidths defined in the present release of specifications.
NOTE: Other operating bands and channel bandwidths may be considered in future
releases.
Requirements throughout the RF specifications are in many cases defined
separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency ranges in which
NR can operate according to this version of the specifications are identified
as described in Table 5.1-1.
Table 5.1-1: Definition of frequency ranges
Frequency range designation Corresponding frequency range
* * *
FR1 410 MHz -- 7125 MHz FR2 24250 MHz -- 52600 MHz
The present specification covers band combinations including
\- at least one FR1 operating band and one FR2 operating band for carrier
aggregation and dual connectivity operations;
\- at least one E-UTRA operating band for dual connectivity operations.
## 5.2 Operating bands
NR is designed to operate in FR1 operating bands defined in TS 38.101-1 [2]
and FR2 operating bands defined in TS 38.101-2 [3]. E-UTRA is designed to
operate in operating bands defined in TS 36.101 [4].
## 5.2A Operating bands for CA
### 5.2A.1 Inter-band CA between FR1 and FR2
NR carrier aggregation is designed to operate in the operating bands defined
in Table 5.2A.1‑1. The band combinations include at least one FR1 operating
band and one FR2 operating band.
If the mandatory simultaneous Rx/Tx capability applies for a lower order band
combination, when the applicable lower order band combination is a band pair
in a higher order band combination, the mandatory simultaneous Rx/Tx
capability also applies for the band pair in the higher order band
combination.
Table 5.2A.1-1: Band combinations for inter-band NR CA between FR1 and FR2
Editor's note: No band combinations for inter-band NR CA between FR1 and FR2
specified due to the testability issues that combined testing of NR FR1 in
conducted mode and NR FR2 in radiated mode.
## 5.2B Operating bands for DC
### 5.2B.1 General
The operating bands are specified in clause 5.5B for operation with EN-DC,
NGEN-DC, NE-DC or NR-DC configured.
### 5.2B.2 to 5.2B.7 Void
## 5.2E Operating bands for V2X
### 5.2E.1 Intra-band V2X bands
NR V2X operation is designed to operate with E-UTRA sidelink in TDM mode on
the operating bands combinations listed in Table 5.2E.1-1.

## 5.3 UE Channel bandwidth
## 5.3A UE Channel bandwidth for CA
### 5.3A.1 Inter-band CA between FR1 and FR2
For inter-band NR CA between FR1 and FR2, a carrier aggregation configuration
is a combination of operating bands, each supporting a carrier aggregation
bandwidth class as specified in clause 5.3A.5 of TS 38.101-1 [2] and clause
5.3A.4 of TS 38.101-2 [3] independently.
## 5.3B UE Channel bandwidth for EN-DC
### 5.3B.0 General
For intra-band contiguous EN-DC, the aggregated channel bandwidth is sum of
the individual NR and E-UTRA channel bandwidths assuming nominal EN-DC channel
with 0 kHz offset spacing as specified in clause 5.4.
ENBW = BW~NR_Channel~ + BW~E-UTRA_Channel~
In the case where the NR sub-block and/or the E-UTRA sub-block itself is
composed of intra-band contiguous CA carriers, the EN-DC aggregated channel
bandwidth is the sum of the aggregated channel bandwidths of the NR and E-UTRA
sub-blocks assuming nominal EN-DC channel spacing between the NR sub-block and
E-UTRA sub-block.
ENBW = BW~NR_Channel_CA~ + BW~E-UTRA_Channel_CA~
For NR inter-band dual connectivity specified in 5.5B.7, the corresponding NR
CA configurations in 5.5A.1, i.e., dual uplink inter-band carrier aggregation
between FR1 and FR2 with uplink assigned to two NR bands, are applicable to
Dual Connectivity.
NOTE: Requirements for the dual connectivity configurations are defined in the
clause corresponding NR uplink CA between FR1 and FR2 configurations, unless
otherwise specified.
Intra-band contiguous EN-DC configurations are defined using intra-band
contiguous EN-DC bandwidth class notation DC_(n)Xyz where the first EN-DC
bandwidth class letter indicates the number of contiguous E-UTRA carriers and
the second EN-DC bandwidth class letter indicates the number of contiguous NR
carriers for the EN-DC combination of E-UTRA Band X and NR Band nX. Applicable
contiguous intraband EN-DC bandwidth classes are listed in Table 5.3B.0-1

### 5.3B.1 Intra-band EN-DC in FR1
#### 5.3B.1.1 General
The requirements for intra-band EN-DC in this specification are defined for
EN-DC configurations with associated bandwidth combination sets.
For each EN-DC configuration, requirements are specified for all bandwidth
combinations contained in a _bandwidth combination set_ , which is indicated
per supported band combination in the UE radio access capability. A UE can
indicate support of several bandwidth combination sets per band combination.
#### 5.3B.1.2 BCS for Intra-band contiguous EN-DC
For intra-band contiguous EN-DC, an EN-DC configuration is consisting of an
E-UTRA band and a corresponding NR band having the same frequency range which
supports an intra-band contiguous EN-DC bandwidth class.
Bandwidth combination sets for intra-band contiguous EN-DC are specified in
Table 5.3B.1.2-1. The EN-DC configurations and bandwidth combination sets in
Table 5.3B.1.2-1 also apply to higher order EN-DC combinations that include
inter-band and intra-band EN-DC on the downlink and inter-band EN-DC on the
uplink. If no BCS is reported in the UE capabilities for an intra-band
combination the default is that the UE supports BCS0.

#### 5.3B.1.3 BCS for Intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC
For intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC, an EN-DC configuration is consisting of
an E-UTRA band and a corresponding NR band having the same frequency range
which supports E-UTRA and NR carriers, where E-UTRA configuration is indicated
by using E-UTRA CA bandwidth class as defined in TS 36.101 [5] and NR
configuration is indicated by using NR CA bandwidth class as defined in TS
38.101-1 [2].
Requirements for intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC are defined for the EN-DC
configurations and bandwidth combination sets specified in Table 5.3B.1.3-1.
The EN-DC configurations and bandwidth combination sets in Table 5.3B.1.3-1
also apply to higher order EN-DC combinations that include inter-band and
intra-band EN-DC on the downlink and inter-band EN-DC on the uplink. If no BCS
is reported in the UE capabilities for an intra-band combination the default
is that the UE supports BCS0.

### 5.3E.3 Inter-band V2X in FR1
For inter-band E-UTRA NR V2X UE, the each channel bandwidth for inter-band V2X
operations in FR1 is specified in TS 36.101 [4] and TS 38.101-1 [2],
respectively.
## 5.4 Void
## 5.4A Channel arrangement for CA
The channel arrangement for CA operations in FR1 and FR2 as specified in TS
38.101-1 [2] and TS 38.101-2 [3], respectively.
## 5.4B Channel arrangement for DC
### 5.4B.0 General
The channel arrangement for intra-band EN-DC operations in FR1 is specified in
TS 36.101 [5] and TS 38.101-1 [2], respectively.
### 5.4B.1 Channel spacing for intra-band EN-DC carriers
The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the size
of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The nominal
channel spacing between E-UTRA carrier and an adjacent NR carrier for intra-
band contiguous EN-DC is defined as following:
\- For NR operating bands with 100 kHz channel raster,
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~E-UTRA_Channel~ + BW~NR_Channel~)/2
\- For NR operating bands with 15 kHz channel raster,
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~E-UTRA_Channel~ + BW~NR_Channel~)/2+{-5kHz,
0kHz, 5kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 15 kHz
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~E-UTRA_Channel~ + BW~NR_Channel~)/2+{-10kHz,
0kHz, 10kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 30 kHz
where BW~E-UTRA_Channel~ and BW~NR_Channel~ are the channel bandwidths of the
E-UTRA and NR carriers, ∆F~Raster~ is the band dependent channel raster
granularity defined in TS38.101-1[2]. The channel spacing can be adjusted
depending on the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular
deployment scenario.
For intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC the channel spacing between E-UTRA and NR
carriers shall be larger than the nominal channel spacing defined in this
clause.
## 5.5 Configuration
## 5.5A Configuration for CA
### 5.5A.1 Inter-band CA configurations between FR1 and FR2
Table 5.5A.1-1: Inter-band CA configurations and bandwidth combinations sets
between FR1 and FR2 (two bands)
Editor's note: No Inter-band CA configurations between FR1 and FR2 (two bands)
specified due to the testability issues that combined testing of NR FR1 in
conducted mode and NR FR2 in radiated mode.
## 5.5B Configuration for DC
### 5.5B.1 General
The operating bands and bandwidth classes are specified for operation with EN-
DC, NGEN-DC, NE-DC or NR-DC configured. The EN-DC, NE-DC or NGEN-DC band
combinations include at least one E-UTRA operating band.
For EN-DC or NE-DC configurations indicated by column \"Single Uplink
allowed\" (e.g., problematic band combinations as defined in TS 38.306 [16])
in tables in this clause the UE may indicate capability of not supporting
simultaneous dual and triple uplink operation due to possible intermodulation
interference to its own primary downlink channel bandwidth of PCell or PSCell
if the intermodulation order is 2 or if the intermodulation order is 3 for the
combinations when both operating bands are between 450 MHz -- 960 MHz or
between 1427 MHz -- 2690 MHz.
In the case for EN-DC or NE-DC configurations listed in tables in this clause
for which the intermodulation products caused by the dual and triple uplink
operation fall into the receive band but do not interfere with its own primary
downlink channel bandwidth of PCell or PSCell as defined in Annex I the UE is
mandated to operate in dual and triple uplink mode. Single Uplink is also
allowed for certain band combinations where intermodulation or reverse
intermodulation products could create difficulty for meeting emission
requirements.
For EN-DC combinations of order 3 or higher, \"Single Uplink allowed\" UL
configurations captured in Table 5.5B.2-1, Table 5.5B.3-1, and Table 5.5B.4-1
apply.
Non‑contiguous resource allocation and almost contiguous allocation are not
applicable for E‑UTRA or NR carrier part of intra‑band EN‑DC configuration.
If multiple UL DC configurations are listed for multiple DL DC configurations,
valid uplink configurations are such that uplink does not have more carriers
than downlink.
Non‑contiguous resource allocation and almost contiguous allocation are not
applicable for E‑UTRA or NR carrier part of intra‑band EN‑DC configuration.
If the mandatory simultaneous Rx/Tx capability applies for a lower order DC
configuration, when the applicable lower order DC configuration is a band pair
in a higher order DC configuration, the mandatory simultaneous Rx/Tx
capability also applies for the band pair in the higher order DC
configuration.
### 5.5B.2 Intra-band contiguous EN-DC
Supported channel bandwidths for E-UTRA operating bands are defined in TS
36.521-1 [10] and for NR operating bands in TS 38.521-1 [8].

# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Editor\'s note: Test configurations/environments that require new spherical
scan shall be included in test procedure clause and identifying such scenarios
is currently FFS and owned by RAN5.
Unless otherwise stated the transmitter, characteristics are specified at the
antenna connector(s) of the UE for the bands operating on frequency range 1
and over the air of the UE for the bands operating on frequency range 2. The
requirements for frequency range 1 and frequency range 2 can be verified
separately. For the carrier in frequency range 1, requirements can be verified
with NR FR2 link disabled. For the carrier in frequency range 2, requirements
can be verified in OTA mode with E-UTRA connecting to the network by OTA
without calibration.
For NR FR2 Tx test cases the identified beam peak direction can be stored and
reused for a device under test in various configurations/environments for the
full duration of device testing as long as beam peak direction is the same.
Unless otherwise stated, requirements for NR transmitter written in TS
38.521-1 [8] and TS 38.521-2 [9] apply and are assumed anchor agnostic.
Requirements are verified under conditions where anchor resources do not
interfere NR operation. For Rel-15, unless otherwise stated, if UE indicates
IE maxNumberSRS-Ports-PerResource = n2 in NR standalone operation mode, the
said UE shall meet the NR requirements for either power class 2 or power class
3 in EN-DC within FR1 if UE indicates IE maxNumberSRS-Ports-PerResource = n1
for EN-DC on this NR band. For Rel-16 and forward, if UE indicates IE
_powerClassNRPart-r16_ as defined in TS 38.331 [18] in EN-DC, UE shall meet NR
requirements according to this power class.
Unless otherwise stated, Channel Bandwidth shall be prioritized in the
selecting of test points. Subcarrier spacing shall be selected after Test
Channel Bandwidth is selected.
For conformance testing involving FR2 test cases in this specification, the UE
under test shall be pre-configured with UL Tx diversity schemes disabled to
account for single polarization System Simulator (SS) in the test environment.
The UE under test may transmit with dual polarization.
Uplink RB allocations for NR FR1 carrier given in TS 38.521-1 [8] Table 6.1-1
are used throughout this clause, unless otherwise stated by the test case.
Uplink RB allocations for NR FR2 carrier given in TS 38.521-2 [9] Table 6.1-1
are used throughout this clause, unless otherwise stated by the test case.
Uplink RB allocations for E-UTRA carrier and E-UTRA intra-band contiguous CA
(2CC) given in Table 6.1-1 and Table 6.1-2 respectively are used throughout
this clause, unless otherwise stated by the test case.

Connectivity EN-DC, DC bearer _MCG_ and _SCG_ , Connected without release _On_
according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.5. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2B.1.1.4.3.
7\. When E-UTRA and NR bands are TDD, ensure the same uplink-downlink
configuration by giving SCG a delay of 3 E-UTRA subframes, or by giving MCG a
delay of 2 subframes.
##### 6.2B.1.1.4.2 Test procedure {#b.1.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}
1\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
table 6.2B.1.1.4.1-1on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send, the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
2\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands to the UE for NR
and E-UTRA carrier until the UE transmits at its P~UMAX~ level; allow at least
200 ms from the first TPC command for the UE to reach P~UMAX~ level.
3\. For a UE supporting dynamic power sharing, measure the mean power over all
component carriers. For a UE not supporting dynamic power sharing, measure the
power of each component carrier individually. Ffor the tested EN-DC
configuration, the requirements described in clause 6.2B.2.1.5 shall be met.
The period of the measurement shall be at least the continuous duration of one
active sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with transient periods are not under
test.
4\. For UEs supporting Power Class 2, repeat steps 1\~3 on the applicable
bands with message exception defined in Table 6.2B.1.1.4.3-5.

1\. Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 38.508-1 [6]
clause A.3.1.1 for SS and clause A.3.2.1 for UE.
2\. The parameter settings for the E-UTRA cell are set up according to TS
36.508 [11] clause 4.4.3, and the parameter settings for the cell are set up
according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.4.3.
3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex
C.0 and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex C.0 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively, and
uplink signals according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex H and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex
G for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are set according to Table
6.2B.1.3.3-1.
5\. Propagation conditions are set according to TS 36.521-1 [10] and TS
38.521-1 [8] Annex B.0 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters
Connectivity EN-DC, DC bearer _MCG_ and _SCG_ , Connected without release _On_
according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.5. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2B.1.3.4.3.
7\. For the case of testing overlapping E-UTRA and NR UL transmission scenario
when both bands are TDD, ensure E-UTRA UL transmission overlaps with NR UL
transmission in time by giving SCG a delay of 3 E-UTRA subframes, or by giving
MCG a delay of 2 subframes.
##### 6.2B.1.3.4.2 Test procedure {#b.1.3.4.2-test-procedure .H6}
1\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
table 6.2B.1.3.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC. For an E-UTRA FDD and NR TDD EN-DC band combination, if UE
supports PC2, the percentage of EUTRA uplink symbols transmitted in each radio
frame shall be less than 40%.
2\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands to the UE for NR
and E-UTRA carrier until the UE transmits at its P~UMAX~ level; allow at least
200 ms from the first TPC command for the UE to reach P~UMAX~ level.
3\. For test ID 1\~6 measure the sum of mean transmitted power over all EN-DC
component carriers in the EN-DC, which shall meet the requirements described
in table 6.2B.1.3.5-1 and the period of the measurement shall be at least the
continuous duration of one active sub-frame. For FDD band in inter-band CA
with both TDD band and FDD band, only slots overlapping with only UL symbols
in TDD are under test.
For test ID 7\~15 measure the mean transmitted power over E-UTRA carrier or NR
carrier, which shall meet the requirements described in table 6.2.2.5-1 in TS
36.521-1 [10] or table 6.2.1.5-1 in TS 38.521-1 [8] respectively. The period
of the measurement shall be at least the continuous duration of one active
sub-frame.
4\. For UEs supporting Power Class 2, repeat steps 1\~3 on the applicable
bands with message exception defined in Table 6.2B.1.3.4.3-5.

When the UE is configured for intra-band contiguous EN-DC, the UE determines
the total allowed maximum output power reduction as specified in this clause.
For UE supporting dynamic power sharing the following:
\- for the MCG, MPR _~c~_ in accordance with TS 36.101 [5]
\- for the SCG,
MPR\'_~c~_ = MPR~NR~ = MAX( MPR~single,NR~, MPR~ENDC~)
\- for the total configured transmission power,
MPR~tot~ = P~PowerClass,EN-DC~ -- min(P~PowerClass,EN-DC~
,10*log~10~(10\^((P~PowerClass,E-UTRA~ - MPR~E-UTRA~)/10) +
10\^((P~PowerClass,NR~ - MPR~NR~)/10))
where
MPR~E-UTRA~ = MAX(MPR~single,E-UTRA~, MPR~ENDC~ )
with
\- MPR~single,\ E-UTRA~is the MPR defined for the E-UTRA transmission in TS
36.101 [5]
\- MPR~single,NR~ is the MPR defined for the NR transmission in TS 38.101-1
[2]
For UEs not supporting dynamic power sharing the following
\- for the MCG,
MPR _~c~_ = MAX(MPR~single,E-UTRA~, MPR~ENDC~ )
\- for the SCG,
MPR\'_~c~_ = MAX( MPR~single,NR~, MPR~ENDC~ )
where
\- MPR~single,NR~ is the MPR defined for the NR transmission in TS 38.101-1
[2]
\- MPR~single,E-UTRA~ is the MPR defined for the E-UTRA transmission in TS
36.101 [5]

##### 6.2B.2.1.3.2 MPR for power class 3 and power class 2 {#b.2.1.3.2-mpr-
for-power-class-3-and-power-class-2 .H6}
MPR in this subclause is applicable for power class 3 and power class 2 UEs
indicating IE _dualPA-Architecture_ supported with ENDC power class being the
same as the E-UTRA and NR power class, otherwise the UE can use as much MPR as
needed to fulfil emissions requirements when scheduled with dual uplink
transmission. For UEs scheduled with single uplink transmission, MPR in
subclause 6.2.4 of TS 36.101 [5] and 6.2.2 of TS 38.101-1 [2] apply. For a UE
supporting dynamic power sharing for DC_(n)71AA for which dual simultaneous
uplink transmissions are mandatory and A-MPR defined in subclause 6.2B.3.1.1
is applied as MPR. The allowed maximum output power reduction for IM3 related
emissions applied to transmission on the MCG and the SCG is defined as
follows:
MPR~ENDC~ = M~A~
Where M~A~ is defined as follows
M~A~ = 15; 0 ≤ B \ MPR~ENDC~ = M~A~
Where M~A~ is defined as follows
M~A~ = 18 ; 0 ≤ B \ For UEs not supporting dynamic power sharing,
>
> For E-UTRA
>
> B= (L~CRB_alloc,\ E-UTRA~ * 12* SCS~E-UTRA~ + 12 * SCS~NR~)/1,000.000
Where SCS~NR~ = 15 kHz is assumed in calculation of B.
> For NR
B = (12 * SCS~E-UTRA~ + L~CRB_alloc,NR~ * 12 * SCS~NR~)/1,000.000
Where SCS~E-UTRA~ = 15 kHz is assumed in calculation of B.
and M~A~ is reduced by 1 dB for B \ use Table 6.2B.2.2.4.1-1.

1\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
table 6.2B.3.2.4.1-1 on both EN-DC component carriers. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
2\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands to the UE for NR
and E-UTRA carrier until the UE transmits at its P~UMAX~ level; allow at least
200 ms starting from the first TPC command in this step for the UE to reach
P~UMAX~ level.
3\. Measure the mean power over all component carriers for the EN-DC
configuration, which shall meet the requirements described in table
6.2B.3.2.5-1. The period of the measurement shall be at least the continuous
duration of one sub-frame (1ms).

PDCCH DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the NR UL RMC according to Table
6.2E.2.2.2.4.1-1 on NR CC. The UE starts to perform the E-UTRA V2X sidelink
communication according to SL-V2X-Preconfiguration. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits
on the NR UL and E-UTRA V2X sidelink RMC.
2\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands to the UE until the
UE transmits at its P~UMAX~ level; allow at least 200 ms from the first TPC
command starting in this step for the UE to reach P~UMAX~ level.
3\. Measure the mean power over all component carriers in the inter-band con-
current V2X configuration. The period of the measurement shall be at least the
continuous duration of one active sub-frame (1ms). For TDD slots with
transient periods are not under test.
NOTE 1: When switching to DFT-s-OFDM waveform, as specified in the test
configuration table 6.2E.2.2.2.4.1-1, send an NR RRCReconfiguration message

### 6.3B.3_1 E-UTRA and NR switching time mask for switching between two
uplink carriers
#### 6.3B.3_1.1 E-UTRA and NR switching time mask for switching between two
uplink carriers for inter-band EN-DC
Editor\'s note: This clause is incomplete. The following aspects are either
missing or not yet determined:
\- The test clause number needs further discussion.
##### 6.3B.3_1.1.1 Test purpose {#b.3_1.1.1-test-purpose .H6}
To verify that the E-UTRA and NR switching time mask for switching between two
uplink carriers for inter-band EN-DC meets the requirements given in 6.3B.4.1
in TS 38.101-3 [4].
The E-UTRA and NR switching time mask for switching between two uplink
carriers for inter-band EN-DC defines the transient period(s) and the
switching period allowed between two uplink carriers for an uplink band pair
of an inter-band EN-DC configuration when the capability
_uplinkTxSwitchingPeriod_ is present.
##### 6.3B.3_1.1.2 Test applicability {#b.3_1.1.2-test-applicability .H6}
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 16 and forward,
supporting 2UL inter-band EN-DC and dynamic UL Tx switching.
##### 6.3B.3_1.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#b.3_1.1.3-minimum-
conformance-requirements .H6}
In addition to the requirements in 6.3B.0 and the maximum output power
requirement specified in Table 6.2B.1.3-1 with inter-band EN-DC (two bands),
the switching time mask specified in this sub-clause is applicable for an
uplink band pair of an inter-band EN-DC configuration without SUL band when
the capability **_uplinkTxSwitchingPeriod_** is present, and is only
applicable for uplink switching mechanisms specified in sub-clause 6.1.6 of TS
38.214 [14], where E-UTRA UL carrier 1 is capable of one transmit antenna
connector and NR UL carrier 2 is capable of two transmit antenna connectors,
and the two uplink carriers are in different bands with different carrier
frequencies. The UE shall support the switch between single layer transmission
with one antenna port and two-layer transmission with two antenna ports on the
two uplink carriers following the scheduling commands and rank adaptation,
i.e., both single layer and two-layer transmission with 2 antenna ports, and
single layer transmission with 1 antenna port shall be supported on NR UL
carrier 2.
The switching periods described in Figure 6.3B.4.1-1 are only located in NR
carrier, and the length of uplink switching period _X_ is less than the value
indicated by UE capability **_uplinkTxSwitchingPeriod_**.

Figure 6.3B.4.1-1: Time mask for switching between E-UTRA UL carrier and NR UL
carrier, where the switching period is located in NR carrier
The requirements apply for the case of co-located and synchronized network
deployment with the max receiving timing difference of 3us between the two
carriers.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-3 [4] clause
6.3B.4.1 for the NR and the E-UTRA carrier.
Exception requirements for both NR and E-UTRA are defined for this test and
therefore LTE anchor agnostic approach is not applied.
##### 6.3B.3_1.1.4 Test description {#b.3_1.1.4-test-description .H6}
##### 6.3B.3_1.1.4.1 Initial condition {#b.3_1.1.4.1-initial-condition .H6}
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested
in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the correct
measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test
frequencies and channel bandwidths based on EN-DC operating bands specified in
clause 5.3B.1.2, channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacings for the NR cell
specified in TS 38.521-1 [8] clause 5.3 and channel bandwidth for the E-UTRA
cell are specified in TS 36.521-1 [10] clause 5.4.2. All of these
configurations shall be tested with applicable test parameters for each EN-DC
configuration specified in clause 5.3B.1.2, and are shown in table

1\. Configure Carrier 2 according to Annex C.0, C.1, C.2 for all downlink
physical channels.
2\. The SS shall configure Carrier 2 as per TS 38.508-1 [5] clause 5.5.1.
Message contents are defined in clause 6.3A.3.1_1.4.3 in TS 38.521-1 [8] for
the NR Carrier 2.
3\. For Carrier 1, SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ
process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.3B.3_1.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA subframe n-1, where E-UTRA subframe n is an
uplink slot for Carrier 2 and n-1 ≥ 20 when SCS=15 kHz (n-1 ≥ 40 when SCS=30
kHz, n-1 ≥ 80 when SCS=60 kHz). Since the UE has no payload and no loopback
data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
4 Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands to the UE for NR and
E-UTRA carrier until the UE transmits at its P~UMAX~ level; allow at least
200ms starting from the first TPC command in this step for the UE to reach
P~UMAX~ level.
5\. The SS sends uplink scheduling information via DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI
to schedule the UL RMC according to Table 6.3B.3_1.1.4.1-1 on Carrier 2 on
slot n (n ≥1) and slot m, with both slot n and slot m being uplink slots for
Carrier 2 and m ≥ n+20 when SCS=15kHz (m ≥ n+40 when SCS=30 kHz, m ≥ n+80 when
SCS=60 kHz). Since the UE has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE
sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC. The PDCCH DCI format 0_1 is
specified with the condition 2TX_UL_MIMO in TS 38.508-1 [5] subclause
4.3.6.1.1.2.
6\. Measure the output power of UE PUSCH transmission for Carrier 1 during the
E-UTRA subframe n-1, for Carrier 1 excluding a transient period of 20 µs in
the end of the E-UTRA subframe n-1.
7\. Measure the sum of output power of UE PUSCH transmission on Carrier 2 over
all antenna connectors during slot n and slot m excluding a switching period X
and a transient period of 10 µs in the beginning of slot n and in the end of
slot m. The length of uplink switching period X is indicated by UE capability
_uplinkTxSwitchingPeriod._
8\. For Carrier 1, SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ
process via PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.3B.3_1.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA subframe m+1. Since the UE has no payload and
no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
9\. Measure the output power of UE PUSCH transmission for Carrier 1 during
slot m+1 excluding a transient period of 20 µs in the beginning of slot m+1.
##### 6.3B.3_1.1.5 Test requirements {#b.3_1.1.5-test-requirements .H6}

### 6.4B.2 Transmit Modulation Quality for DC
#### 6.4B.2.1 Transmit Modulation Quality for intra-band contiguous EN-DC
##### 6.4B.2.1.1 Error Vector Magnitude for intra-band contiguous EN-DC
##### 6.4B.2.1.1.1 Test purpose {#b.2.1.1.1-test-purpose .H6}
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called the
error vector. Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is corrected by
the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the carrier leakage
shall be removed from the measured waveform before calculating the EVM.
The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement specified in
clause 6.4B.2.1.4.3. For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, the EVM result is defined after
the front-end FFT and IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error
vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %. For CP-OFDM
waveforms, the EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT as the square
root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power
expressed as a %.
The basic EVM measurement interval in the time domain is one preamble sequence
for the PRACH and the duration of PUCCH/PUSCH channel, or one hop, if
frequency hopping is enabled for PUCCH and PUSCH in the time domain. The EVM

frequency or centre frequency of aggregated transmission bandwidth
configuration. It is an interference of approximately constant amplitude and
independent of the amplitude of the wanted signal. Carrier leakage interferes
with the centre sub carriers of the UE under test (if allocated), especially,
when their amplitude is small. The measurement interval is defined over one
slot in the time domain.
The purpose of this test is to exercise the UE transmitter to verify its
modulation quality in terms of carrier leakage.

##### 6.4B.2.1.3 In-band Emissions for intra-band contiguous EN-DC
##### 6.4B.2.1.3.1 Test purpose {#b.2.1.3.1-test-purpose .H6}
The in-band emissions are a measure of the interference falling into the non-
allocated resources blocks.
The in-band emission is defined as the average emission across 12 sub-carriers
and as a function of the RB offset from the edge of the allocated UL
transmission bandwidth. The in-band emission is measured as the ratio of the
UE output power in a non--allocated RB to the UE output power in an allocated
RB.
The basic in-band emissions measurement interval is defined over one slot in
the time domain, however, the minimum requirement applies when the in-band
emission measurement is averaged over 10 sub-frames. When the PUSCH or PUCCH
transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing with SRS, the in-band
emissions measurement interval is reduced by one or more symbols, accordingly.
The purpose of this test is to exercise the UE transmitter to verify its
modulation quality in terms of in-band emissions.
##### 6.4B.2.1.3.2 Test applicability {#b.2.1.3.2-test-applicability .H6}

##### 6.4B.2.1.3.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#b.2.1.3.3-minimum-
conformance-requirements .H6}
For the MCG the in-band emission requirements in Table 6.5.2A.3.1-1 and Table
6.5.2A.3.1-2 in TS 36.101 [5] apply within the aggregated transmission
bandwidth configuration of the EN-DC bandwidth with the carriers of both CGs
active and one single contiguous PRB allocation of bandwidth within the MCG at
the edge of the said aggregated transmission bandwidth configuration.
For the SCG the in-band emission requirements in Table 6.5.2A.3.1-1 and Table
6.5.2A.3.1-2 in TS 36.101 [5] apply within the aggregated transmission
bandwidth configuration of the EN-DC bandwidth with the carriers of both CGs
active and one single contiguous PRB allocation of bandwidth within the SCG at
the edge of the aggregated transmission bandwidth configuration.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-3 [4] clause

DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
table 6.5B.1.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
2\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands to the UE for NR
and E-UTRA carrier until the UE transmits at its P~UMAX~ level; allow at least
200 ms from the first TPC command for the UE to reach P~UMAX~ level.
3\. Measure the power spectrum distribution over all EN-DC component carriers
in the EN-DC within two times or more range over the requirement for Occupied
Bandwidth specification for intra-band contiguous EN-DC centring on the
current carrier frequency in the EN-DC configuration. The characteristics of
the filter shall be approximately Gaussian (typical spectrum analyser filter).
Other methods to measure the power spectrum distribution are allowed. The
measuring duration is at least 1ms over consecutive active uplink slots.
4\. Calculate the total power within the range of all frequencies measured in
step 3 and save this value as \"Total power\".
5\. Sum up the power upward from the lower boundary of the measured frequency
range in step 3 and seek the limit frequency point by which this sum becomes
0.5% of \"Total power\" and save this point as \"Lower Frequency\".
6\. Sum up the power downward from the upper boundary of the measured
frequency range in step 3 and seek the limit frequency point by which this sum
becomes 0.5% of \"Total power\" and save this point as \"Upper Frequency\".
7\. Calculate the difference \"Upper Frequency\" -- \"Lower Frequency\" =
\"Occupied Bandwidth\" between the two limit frequencies obtained in step 5
and step 6.

DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 6.5B.2.1.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has
no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits
on the UL RMC.
2\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands to the UE for NR
and E-UTRA carrier until the UE transmits at its P~UMAX~ level; allow at least
200 ms from the first TPC command for the UE to reach P~UMAX~ level.
3\. For a UE supporting dynamic power sharing, measure the mean power over all
component carriers. For a UE not supporting dynamic power sharing, measure the
power of each component carrier individually. The measure transmitted power
shall meet the requirements in clause 6.2B.2.1.5. The period of measurement
shall be at least the continuous duration of 1ms over consecutive active
uplink slots For TDD, only slots consisting of only UL symbols are under test.
4\. Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of
bandwidths according to Table 6.5B.2.1.1.5-1 and using a rms detector. The

DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
table 6.2B.3.1.4.1-1 on both EN-DC component carriers. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
2\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands to the UE for NR
and E-UTRA carrier until the UE transmits at its P~UMAX~ level; allow at least
200 ms from the first TPC command starting from the first TPC command in this
step for the UE to reach P~UMAX~ level.
3\. Measure the mean power over all component carriers for the EN-DC
configuration, which shall meet the requirements described in table
6.5B.2.1.2.5.1-1 through to 6.5B.2.1.2.5.2-1. The period of the measurement
shall be at least the continuous duration of one active sub-frame (1ms).
4\. Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of
bandwidths according to table 6.5B.2.1.2.5-1 through to 6.5B.2.1.2.5.2-1 and
using a rms detector. The centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in
contiguous steps according to the same table. The measured power shall be
recorded for each step. The measurement period shall capture the active time
slots.

in TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex C.2 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
1\. Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in [6] TS 38.508-1
A.3.1.2.1 for SS diagram and A.3.2.1 for UE diagram.
2\. The parameter settings for the E-UTRA cell are set up according to TS
36.508 [11] clause 4.4.3, and the parameter settings for the NR cell are set
up according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.4.3.
3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex
C.0 and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex C.0 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively, and

DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
test configuration tables defined in section 6.2B.2.1.4.1 on both EN-DC
component carriers. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data to send
the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands to the UE for NR
and E-UTRA carrier until the UE transmits at its P~UMAX~ level; allow at least
200ms for the UE to reach P~UMAX~ level.
3\. Measure the mean power of the UE in the channel bandwidth of the radio
access mode according to the test configuration, which shall meet the
requirements in clause 6.2B.2.1.5 as appropriate. The period of the
measurement shall be at least the continuous duration of 1ms over consecutive
active uplink slots. For TDD, only slots consisting of only UL symbols are
under test.
4\. Measure the filtered mean power of the transmitted signal centred on the
aggregated sub-block ENBW with a measurement filter of bandwidth according to
test configuration tables defined in section 6.2B.2.1.4.1 and using a rms
detector. The period of the measurement shall be at least the continuous
duration of 1ms over consecutive active uplink slots For TDD, only slots
consisting of only UL symbols are under test.
5\. Measure the filtered mean power of the first adjacent channel on both
lower and upper side of the assigned NR + E-UTRA channel, respectively with a
frequency offset and measurement filter of bandwidth according to test
configuration tables defined in section 6.2B.2.1.4.1 and using a rms detector.
6\. Calculate the ratios of the power between the values measured in step 3
over step 4 for lower and upper side respectively.

### 6.5B.3 Spurious emissions for EN-DC
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter
effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions, intermodulation
products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
The spurious emission limits are specified in terms of general requirements in
line with SM.329 [3] and _NR_ operating band requirement to address UE co-
existence.
To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution
bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be
integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent
noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 38.508-1
[6] clause 4.4.3.
3\. E-UTRA downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1
and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0 of TS 36.521-1
[10].
4\. NR downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and

##### 6.5B.3.2.2.4.2 Test Procedure {#b.3.2.2.4.2-test-procedure .H6}
1\. E-UTRA SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table
6.5B.3.2.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2\. NR SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table
6.5B.3.2.2.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands to the UE for both
NR and E-UTRA carriers until the UE transmits at its P~UMAX~ level; allow at
least 200 ms starting from the first TPC command in this step for the UE to
reach P~UMAX~ level.
4\. Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of
bandwidths according to Table 6.5B.3.2.2.3-1. The centre frequency of the
filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps according to the same table. The
measured power shall be verified for each step. The measurement period shall
capture the active time slots. During measurement the spectrum analyser shall
be set to \'Detector\' = RMS.

##### 6.5B.3.2.2.5 Test Requirement {#b.3.2.2.5-test-requirement .H6}
Test requirements for Spurious Emissions UE Co-existence for intra-band non-
contiguous EN-DC are the same as the minimum requirements described in clause
6.5B.3.2.2.3 and are not repeated in this clause.
The requirements for the UE are release specific and can be found in Tables
6.5B.3.2.2.3-1 to 6.5B.3.2.2.3-1a. If the UE support a band, which is not
defined in the table corresponding UE's release, the requirements for this
band are taken from the table of earliest release where requirements for this
band are defined.
#### 6.5B.3.3 Spurious Emissions for Inter-band EN-DC within FR1
##### 6.5B.3.3.1 General spurious emissions for Inter-band EN-DC within FR1
##### 6.5B.3.3.1.1 Test purpose {#b.3.3.1.1-test-purpose .H6}
To verify that UE transmitter does not cause unacceptable interference to
other channels or other systems in terms of transmitter spurious emissions.
##### 6.5B.3.3.1.2 Test applicability {#b.3.3.1.2-test-applicability .H6}
This test case applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward supporting
inter-band EN-DC.
##### 6.5B.3.3.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#b.3.3.1.3-minimum-
conformance-requirements .H6}
The general spurious emissions requirements specified in subclause 6.6.3.1 of
TS 36.101 [5], subclause 6.5.3.1 of TS 38.101-1 [2] and TS 38.101-2 [3] apply
for each component carrier. For the case of inter-band EN-DC with a single
carrier per cell group, the general spurious emissions requirements also apply
with both downlink carrier and both uplink carriers active. Limits on
configured maximum output power for the uplink according to subclause 6.2B.4
apply.
NOTE: The general spurious emission requirements with both uplink carriers
active are allowed to be verified for only a single inter-band EN-DC
configuration per NR band. Furthermore, the requirements are allowed to be
verified by measuring spurious emissions at the specific frequencies where
second and third order intermodulation products generated by the two
transmitted carriers can occur.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-3 [4] clause
6.5B.3.3.1. Exception requirements applicable for both NR and LTE, therefore
LTE anchor agnostic approach is not applied.
##### 6.5B.3.3.1.4 Test description {#b.3.3.1.4-test-description .H6}
##### 6.5B.3.3.1.4.1 Initial condition {#b.3.3.1.4.1-initial-condition .H6}
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested
in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the correct
measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test
frequencies, DC configuration specified in Table 5.5B.4.1-1 and test channel
bandwidths specified in TS 36.508 [11] clause 4.3.1 and TS 38.508-1 [6] clause
4.3.1, and sub-carrier spacing based on NR operating bands specified in TS
38.521-1 [8] clause 5.3. All of these configurations shall be tested with
applicable test parameters for each EN-DC configuration, and are shown in
Table 6.5B.3.3.1.4.1-1. The details of the uplink reference measurement
channels (RMCs) are specified in Annexe A, clause A.2.2 for E-UTRA RMC for
TDD, TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex A, clause A.2.2 for E-UTRA RMC for FDD, and TS
38.521-1 [8] Annex A, clause A.2 for NR RMC. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH
before measurement are specified in TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex C.2 and in TS
38.521-1 [8] Annex C.2 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.

1\. Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in TS 38.508-1 [6]
Annex A, Figure A.3.1.1.1 for SS diagram and clause A.3.2.1 for UE diagram.
2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 38.508-1
[6] clause 4.4.3.
3\. E-UTRA downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1
and C.3.0, and uplink signals according to Annex H.1 and H.3.0 of TS 36.521-1
[10].
4\. NR downlink signals are initially set up according to Annex C.0, C.1 and
C.2, and uplink signals according to Annex G.0, G.1, G.2, G.3.0 of TS 38.521-1
[8].
5\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are set for E-UTRA CG and NR CG
respectively.
6\. Propagation conditions are set according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex B and
TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex B for E-UTRA link and NR link respectively.
7\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters
Connectivity EN-DC, DC bearer _MCG_ and _SCG,_ Connected without release _On_
according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.5. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.5B.3.3.1.4.3.
8\. For both E-UTRA and NR UL uplink carriers active when both bands are TDD,
ensure E-UTRA UL transmission overlaps with NR UL transmission in time by
giving SCG a delay of 3 E-UTRA subframes, or by giving MCG a delay of 2
subframes.
##### 6.5B.3.3.1.4.2 Test procedure {#b.3.3.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}
1\. E-UTRA SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table
6.5B.3.3.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
2\. NR SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table
6.5B.3.3.1.4.1-1. Since the UE has no payload data to send, the UE transmits
uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3\. Send continuously uplink power control \"up\" commands to the UE for both
NR and E-UTRA carriers until the UE transmits at its P~UMAX~ level; allow at
least 200 ms starting from the first TPC command in this step for the UE to
reach P~UMAX~ level.
4\. Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement filter of
bandwidths according to Table 6.5B.3.3.1.5-1(for EN-DC configurations listed
in Table 6.5B.3.3.1.5-1) or Table 6.5.3.1.5-1 in TS 38.521-1 [8] (for EN-DC
configurations not listed in Table 6.5B.3.3.1.5-1). The centre frequency of
the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps according to the same table.
The measured power shall be verified for each step. The measurement period
shall capture the active time slots. During measurement the spectrum analyser
shall be set to \'Detector\' = RMS.
5\. For UE operating on EN-DC configuration with Band n41, redo the test for
frequency range 1 GHz ≤ f \ 3\. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | NOTE | | | | | | | | | 13: | | | | | | | | | Void. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | NOTE | | | | | | | | | 14: | | | | | | | | |

Additional step 9 when both bands are TDD:
8\. For both E-UTRA and NR UL uplink carriers active when both bands are TDD,
ensure E-UTRA UL transmission overlaps with NR UL transmission in time by
giving SCG a delay of 3 E-UTRA subframes, or by giving MCG a delay of 2
subframes.

##### 6.5B.3.3.2.5 Test Requirement {#b.3.3.2.5-test-requirement .H6}
Test requirements for Spurious Emissions UE Co-existence when both LTE and NR
carriers are required to be active are release specific and can be found in
Table 6.5B.3.3.2.5-1 If the UE support a band combination from a later
release, the requirements for this band combination are taken from the table
of earliest release where requirements for this band combination are defined.
Test requirements for EN-DC only capable devices when using LTE anchor
agnostic approach can be found in clause 6.5.3.2.5 in TS 38.521-1 [8].
For inter-band EN_DC with the uplink assigned to one LTE band and one NR band,
the test requirements in Table 6.5B.3.3.2.5-1 can be verified by measuring
spurious emissions at the specific frequencies where second and third order
intermodulation products generated by the two transmitted carriers can occur.

# 7 Receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
Editor\'s note: Test configurations/environments that require new spherical
scan shall be included in test procedure clause and identifying such scenarios
is currently FFS and owned by RAN5.
Unless otherwise stated the receiver characteristics are specified at the
antenna connector(s) of the UE for the bands operating on frequency range 1
and over the air of the UE for the bands operating on frequency range 2. The
requirements for frequency range 1 and frequency range 2 can be verified
separately. For the carrier in frequency range 1, requirements can be verified
with NR FR2 link disabled. For the carrier in frequency range 2, requirements
can be verified in OTA mode with E-UTRA connecting to the network by OTA
without calibration.
For NR FR2 Rx test cases the identified beam peak direction can be stored and
reused for a device under test in various configurations/environments for the
full duration of device testing as long as beam peak direction is the same.
The requirements defined in this clause are the extra requirements compared
with the single carrier requirements defined in TS 38.521-1 [8] and TS
38.521-2 [9].
Unless otherwise stated, the UL and DL reference measurement channels are the
same with the configurations specified in TS 38.521-1 [8] and TS 38.521-2 [9].
Unless otherwise stated, requirements for NR receiver written in TS 38.521-1
[8] and TS 38.521-2 [9] apply and are assumed anchor agnostic. Requirements
are verified under conditions where anchor resources do not interfere NR
operation.
For intra-band EN-DC, the output power is configured as follows:
\- One E-UTRA uplink carrier with the output power set to 29dB below
P~CMAX_L,c~ and the NR band whose downlink is being tested has its uplink
carrier output power set to 4dB below P~CMAX_L,f,c~.
\- One NR uplink carrier with the output power set to 29dB below P~CMAX_L,f,c~
and the E-UTRA band whose downlink is being tested has its uplink carrier
output power set to4 dB below P~CMAX_L,c~.
For the additional requirements for intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC of two
sub-blocks, an in-gap test refers to the case when the interfering signal is
located at a negative offset with respect to the assigned lowest channel
frequency of the highest sub-block and located at a positive offset with
respect to the assigned highest channel frequency of the lowest sub-block.
For the additional requirements for intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC of two
sub-blocks, an out-of-gap test refers to the case when the interfering
signal(s) is (are) located at a positive offset with respect to the assigned
channel frequency of the highest carrier frequency or located at a negative
offset with respect to the assigned channel frequency of the lowest carrier
frequency.
For the additional requirements for intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC of two
sub-blocks with channel bandwidth larger than or equal to 5 MHz, the existing
adjacent channel selectivity requirements, in-band blocking requirements (for
each case), and narrow band blocking requirements apply for in-gap tests only
if the corresponding interferer frequency offsets with respect to the two
measured carriers satisfy the following condition in relation to the sub-block
gap size W~gap~ for at least one of the E-UTRA or NR sub-blocks, so that the
interferer frequency position does not change the nature of the core
requirement tested:
Wgap ≥ 2∙\|FInterferer (offset)\| -- BWChannel
For the E-UTRA sub-block, the F~Interferer\ (offset),~ for a sub-block with a
single component carrier is the interferer frequency offset with respect to
carrier as specified in clause 7.5.1, clause 7.6.1 and clause 7.6.3 for the
respective requirement in TS 36.521 [10] and BW~Channel.~ F~Interferer\
(offset)~ for the E-UTRA sub-block with two or more contiguous component
carriers is the interference frequency offset with respect to the carrier
adjacent to the gap is specified in clause 7.5.1A, 7.6.1A and 7.6.3A in TS
36.521 [10].
For the NR sub-block, the F~Interferer\ (offset),~ for a sub-block with a
single component carrier is the interferer frequency offset with respect to
carrier as specified in clause 7.5, clause 7.6.2 and clause 7.6.4 for the
respective requirement in TS 38.521-1 [8] and BW~Channel..~
The interferer frequency offsets for adjacent channel selectivity, each in-
band blocking case and narrow- band blocking shall be tested separately with a
single in-gap interferer at a time.
Unless otherwise stated, Channel Bandwidth shall be prioritized in the
selecting of test points. Subcarrier spacing shall be selected after Test
Channel Bandwidth is selected.
For conformance testing involving FR2 test cases in this specification, the UE
under test shall be pre-configured with UL Tx diversity schemes disabled to
account for single polarization System Simulator (SS) in the test environment.
The UE under test may transmit with dual polarization.

## 7.3A Reference sensitivity for CA without EN-DC
### 7.3A.1 General
For NR CA operation NR single carrier and CA operation of REFSENS requirements
defined in TS 38.101-1 [2] and TS 38.101-2 [3] apply to all downlink bands
part of NR CA configurations listed in Table 5.2A.1-1 unless sensitivity
degradation is allowed as defined in clause 7.3A in TS 38.101-3 [4].
A UE which supports inter-band NR CA configuration is allowed to apply each
sensitivity degradation for FR1 specified in clause 7.3A.2 TS 38.101-1 [2] and
for FR2 specified in clause 7.3A.2 of TS 38.101-2 [3] independently.
### 7.3A.2 Reference sensitivity power level for CA without EN-DC
##### 7.3A.2.1 Test purpose {#a.2.1-test-purpose .H6}
Same test purpose as in clause 7.3.2 in TS 38.521-1 [8] for NR FR1 carrier(s)
and clause 7.3.2 in TS 38.521-2 [9] for NR FR2 carrier(s).
##### 7.3A.2.2 Test applicability {#a.2.2-test-applicability .H6}
The requirements in this test are not testable due to issues with combined
testing of NR FR1 conducted mode with NR FR2 in radiated mode. Therefore, the
conducted and radiated requirements are tested separately.
No test case details are specified. The NR/5GC requirements for receiver
sensitivity power level apply and are tested in TS 38.521-1 [8] clauses 7.3
and 7.3A and TS 38.521-2 [9] clauses 7.3 and 7.3A.
### 7.3A.3 ΔR~IB,c~ for CA without EN-DC
For the UE which supports inter-band NR CA configuration, the minimum
requirement for reference sensitivity in clause 7.3.2 in TS 38.101-1 [2] and
clause 7.3.2, 7.3A.2in TS 38.101-2 [3] shall be increased by the amount given
in ΔR~IB,c~ in Tables below. Unless otherwise stated, ΔR~IB,c~ is set to zero.
In case the UE supports more than one of band combinations for CA, SUL or DC,
and an operating band belongs to more than one band combinations then
\- When the operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the applicable
additional ∆R~IB,c~ shall be the average value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B in TS
38.101-3 [4], truncated to one decimal place that apply for that operating
band among the supported band combinations. In case there is a harmonic
relation between low band UL and high band DL, then the maximum ΔR~IB,c~ among
the different supported band combinations involving such band shall be applied
\- When the operating band frequency range is > 1 GHz, the applicable
additional ΔR~IB,c~ shall be the maximum value for all band combinations
defined in clause 7.3A, 7.3B, 7.3C in this specification and 7.3A, 7.3B in TS
38.101-3 [4] for the applicable operating bands.
#### 7.3A.3.1 ΔR~IB,c~ for Inter-band CA between FR1 and FR2 without EN-DC
Unless otherwise stated, ΔR~IB,c~ for NR FR1 band and FR2 band of inter-band
CA defined in table 5.5A.1-1 is set to zero.
### 7.3A.4 Void
## 7.3B Reference sensitivity level for DC
### 7.3B.1 General
For EN-DC, E-UTRA and NR single carrier, CA, and MIMO operation of REFSENS
requirements defined in TS 38.101-1 [2], TS 38.101-2 [3] and TS 36.101 [5]
apply to all downlink bands of EN-DC configurations listed in clause 5.5B,
unless sensitivity degradation exception is allowed in this clause of this
specification, clause 7.3 in TS 38.101-1 [2], clause 7.3 in TS 38.101-2 [3] or
clause 7.3 in TS 36.101 [5]. Allowed exceptions specified in this clause of
the specification, clause 7.3 in TS 38.101-1 [2], clause 7.3 in TS 38.101-2
[3] or clause 7.3 in TS 36.101 [4] also apply to any higher order EN-DC
configuration combination containing one of the band combinations that
exception is allowed for. Reference sensitivity exceptions are specified by
applying maximum sensitivity degradation (MSD) into applicable REFSENS
requirement. EN-DC REFSENS requirements shall be met for NR uplink
transmissions using QPSK DFT-s-OFDM waveforms as defined in clause 7.3.2 in TS
38.101-1 [2]. Unless otherwise specified UL allocation uses the lowest SCS
allowable for a given channel BW. Limits on configured maximum output power
for the uplink according to subclause 6.2B.4 shall apply.
In case of interband EN-DC the receiver REFSENS requirements in this clause do
not apply for 1.4 and 3 MHz E-UTRA carriers. For the case of inter-band EN-DC
with a single carrier per cell group and multi‑carrier per cell group, in
addition to the E-UTRA and NR single carrier, CA, and MIMO operation of
REFSENS requirements defined in TS 38.101-1 [2], TS 38.101-2 [3], and TS
36.101 [5], the REFSENS requirements specified therein also apply with both
downlink carriers and both uplink carriers active unless sensitivity
exceptions are allowed in this clause of this specification, clause 7.3 in TS
38.101-1 [2] or clause 7.3 in TS 36.101 [5].
For reference sensitivity exception test points where the specified carrier
frequency does not correspond to a valid NR-ARFCN, the closest NR-ARFCN as
specified in TS 38.101-1 [2] clause 5.4.2 applies.
For operations with 4 Rx antenna ports in an E-UTRA band or an NR band, the
MSD in the applicable bands shall be increased by the absolute value of
ΔR~IB,4R~ in Table 7.3.1-1a of TS 36.101[5] for the E-UTRA band or in Table
7.3.2-2 of TS 38.101-1 [2] for the NR band when MSD > 0.
NOTE: For inter-band EN-DC, the reference sensitivity requirement with both
uplink carriers active is allowed to be verified for only a single inter-band
EN-DC configuration per NR band.
### 7.3B.2 Reference sensitivity for EN-DC
#### 7.3B.2.0 Minimum Conformance Requirements of Reference sensitivity for
EN-DC
##### 7.3B.2.0.1 Intra-band contiguous EN-DC
For intra-band contiguous EN-DC configurations, the reference sensitivity
power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power applied to each one of the UE
antenna ports at which the throughput for the carrier(s) of the E-UTRA and NR
CGs shall meet or exceed the requirements for the specified E-UTRA and NR
reference measurement channels. The reference sensitivity requirements apply
with all uplink carriers and all downlink carriers active for EN-DC
configuration and Uplink EN-DC configuration listed in Table 5.5B.2-1 and
Table 5.5B.3-1, as supported by the UE. For EN-DC configurations where uplink
is not available in either the MCG or the SCG or for EN-DC configurations
where the UE only supports single uplink operation, reference sensitivity
requirements apply with single uplink transmission. The downlink carrier(s)
from the cell group with uplink shall be configured closer to the uplink
operating band than any of the downlink carriers from the cell group without
uplink.
Sensitivity degradation is allowed for Intra-band contiguous EN-DC
configurations listed in Table 7.3B.2.0.1-1, the reference sensitivity is
defined only for the specific uplink and downlink test points which are
specified in Table 7.3B.2.0.1-1 and E-UTRA and NR single carrier requirements
do not apply.

antenna ports at which the throughput for the carrier(s) of the E-UTRA and NR
CGs shall meet or exceed the requirements for the specified E-UTRA and NR
reference measurement channels.
For DC_3A_n3A intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC combination, only single
switched UL is supported in rel.15, therefore, no MSD is specified and E-UTRA
and NR single carrier requirements apply.
##### 7.3B.2.0.3 Inter-band EN-DC within FR1

##### 7.3B.2.3_1.1 Reference sensitivity for EN-DC within FR1 (3 CCs)
Editor\'s note: The test requirements section of this test case contains some
EN-DC configurations that have no test points defined meaning these cannot be
tested.
Editor\'s note: For EN-DC configurations with >1NR CC, test points in Table
7.3B.2.3_1.1.4.1-0 only need to be tested if the configuration is a max NR CC
of the UE, where detailed execution rules are FFS.
##### 7.3B.2.3_1.1.1 Test purpose {#b.2.3_1.1.1-test-purpose .H6}
To verify the ability of UE that support EN-DC configurations to receive data
with a given average throughput for a specified reference measurement channel,
under conditions of low signal level, ideal propagation and no added noise
when no CA exceptions are allowed and single carrier requirements apply
whenever possible. A UE unable to meet the throughput requirement under these
conditions will decrease the effective coverage area.
##### 7.3B.2.3_1.1.2 Test applicability {#b.2.3_1.1.2-test-applicability .H6}
This test applies to all types of NR UE release 15 and forward supporting 3CC
EN-DC.
##### 7.3B.2.3_1.1.3 Minimum conformance requirements {#b.2.3_1.1.3-minimum-
conformance-requirements .H6}
The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.3B.2.0
Exception requirements for both NR and E-UTRA are defined for this test and
therefore LTE anchor agnostic approach is not applied. E-UTRA test point
analysis is included and E-UTRA measurements are performed.

.H6}
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested
in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the correct
measurement state.
The initial test configurations for E-UTRA consist of the test frequency based
on E-UTRA operating band and test channel bandwidth as specified in Table
4.6-1, with the exception that the E-UTRA channel bandwidth is the lowest
supported value in Table 5.3B.1.3-1 for the EN-DC non-contiguous configuration
under test.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test
frequencies, test channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacing based on NR
operating bands specified in Table 5.5B.2-1. The 4CC EN-DC configurations
listed in table 7.3B.2.3_1.2.4.1-0 shall not be tested according to TR 38.905
[7] test point analysis. The other 4CC configurations shall be tested with
applicable test parameters for each combination of test channel bandwidth and
sub-carrier spacing, and are shown in Tables 7.3B.2.3.4.2.1-0 to
7.3B.2.3.4.2.1-1 for NR band. The details of the uplink reference measurement
channels (RMCs) are specified in Annex A.2. Configurations of PDSCH and PDCCH

##### 7.3B.2.3_1.2.4.2 Test procedure {#b.2.3_1.2.4.2-test-procedure .H6}
1\. NR SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1_1 for C_RNTI to transmit the
DL RMC according to Table 7.3B.2.3_1.2.4.2.1-1 on the NR CC. The NR SS sends
downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2\. NR SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via
PDCCH DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to Table
7.3B.2.3_1.2.4.2.1-1. Since the UL has no payload and no loopback data to send
the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on the UL RMC.
3\. Set the Downlink signal level to the appropriate REFSENS value defined in
TS 38.521-1 [8], Table 7.3.2.5-1 for NR band. Send continuously uplink power
control \"up\" commands in the uplink scheduling information to NR carrier to
ensure the UE transmits PUMAX level for at least the duration of the
Throughput measurement.
4\. Measure the average throughput of the NR carrier for a duration sufficient
to achieve statistical significance according to Annex H.2 of TS 38.521-1 [8]
for NR band.

ΔR~IB,c~ or ΔR~IBNC~ is set to zero.
In case the UE supports more than one of band combinations for CA, SUL or DC,

4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex A.2 and
TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex A.2 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
5\. Propagation conditions are set according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex B.0 and
TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex B.0 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters
Connectivity EN-DC, DC bearer _MCG_ and _SCG_ , Connected without release _On_
according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.5. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.4B.1.4.3.
7\. When E-UTRA and NR bands are TDD, ensure the same uplink-downlink
configuration by giving SCG a delay of 3 E-UTRA subframes, or by giving MCG a
delay of 2 subframes.
##### 7.4B.1.4.2 Test Procedure {#b.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}
1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A and PDCCH DCI format 1_1 for
C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Tables 7.4B.1.4.1 on the E-UTRA CC
and NR CC. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and PDCCH DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 7.4B.1.4.1-1 on the E-UTRA CC and NR CC. Since the UL has
no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits
on the UL RMC.
3\. SS sets the Downlink signal level for the E-UTRA CC and NR CC to the value
defined in Table 7.4B.1.5-1. For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power
control commands to the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE
output power measured by the test system is within the Uplink power control
window, defined as -MU to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the
target power level in Table 7.4B.1.5-1 for at least the duration of the
Throughput measurement, where:
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
4\. Measure the average throughput for each component carrier for duration
sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex H.2 in TS
38.521-1 [8] for NR band, and Annex G.2 of TS 36.521-1 [10] for EUTRA band.
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close
as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink
power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible
actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.

6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters
Connectivity EN-DC, DC bearer _MCG_ and _SCG_ , Connected without release _On_
according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.5. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.5B.1.4.3.
7\. When E-UTRA and NR bands are TDD, ensure the same uplink-downlink
configuration by giving SCG a delay of 3 E-UTRA subframes, or by giving MCG a

##### 7.5B.1.4.2 Test Procedure {#b.1.4.2-test-procedure-1 .H6}
1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A and PDCCH DCI format 1_1 for
C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table 7.5B.1.4.1-1 on the E-UTRA CC
and NR CC, respectively. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and PDCCH DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC
according to Table 7.5B.1.4.1-1 on the E-UTRA CC and NR CC. Since the UE has
no payload data to send, the UE transmits uplink MAC padding bits on the UL
RMC.
3\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5B.0.1-1
(Case 1). For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands to the
UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured by
the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU to
-(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power level in Table
7.5B.0.1-1 for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement, where:
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW.
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
4\. Set the Interferer signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.5B.0.1-1 (Case 1) and frequency below the aggregated component carriers,
using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D.
5\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex H.2 in TS 38.521-1 [8] for NR
band, and Annex G.2 of TS 36.521-1 [10] for EUTRA band.
6\. Repeat steps from 3 to 5, using an interfering signal above the aggregated
component carriers in Case 1 at step 4.
7\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.5B.0.1-2
(Case 2). For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands to the
UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured by
the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU to
-(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power level in Table
7.5B.0.1-2 for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement, where MU
and Uplink power control window size are defined above.
8\. Set the Interferer signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.5B.0.1-2 (Case 2) and frequency below the aggregated component carriers,
using a modulated interferer bandwidth as defined in Annex D.
9\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex H.2 in TS 38.521-1 [8] for NR
band, and Annex G.2 of TS 36.521-1 [10] for EUTRA band.
10\. Repeat steps from 7 to 9, using an interfering signal above the
aggregated component carriers in Case 2 at step 8.
11\. Repeat for applicable channel bandwidths and operating band combinations
in both Case 1 and Case 2.
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close
as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink
power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible
actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.

1\. Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in [6] TS 38.508-1
Annex A, in Figure A.3.1.4.1 for SS diagram and clause A.3.2 for UE diagram.
2\. The parameter settings for the E-UTRA cell are set up according to TS
36.508 [11] clause 4.4.3, and the parameter settings for the NR cell are set
up according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.4.3.
3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex
C and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex C for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively, and uplink
signals according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex H and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex G for
E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
4\. The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex
A.2, A.3 and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex A.2 , A.3 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG
respectively.
5\. Propagation conditions are set according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex B.0 and
TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex B.0 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters
Connectivity EN-DC, DC bearer _MCG_ and _SCG_ , Connected without release _On_
according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.5. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6B.2.1.4.3.
7\. When E-UTRA and NR bands are TDD, ensure the same uplink-downlink
configuration by giving SCG a delay of 3 E-UTRA subframes, or by giving MCG a
delay of 2 subframes.
##### 7.6B.2.1.4.2 Test procedure {#b.2.1.4.2-test-procedure-2 .H6}
1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A and PDCCH DCI format 1_1 for
C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table 7.6B.2.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC
and NR CC respectively. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.6B.2.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
3\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.6B.2.1.5-1. For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands to
the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured
by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU
to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power level in
Table 7.6B.2.1.5-1 for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement,
where:
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
4\. Set the parameters of the signal generator for an interfering signal below
the aggregated component carriers in Case 1 according to Table 7.6B.2.1.5-1.
5\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex H.2.
6\. Repeat steps from 4 to 5, using an interfering signal above the aggregated
component carriers in Case 1 at step 4.
7\. Repeat steps from 4 to 6, using interfering signals in Case 2 at steps 4
and 6.
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close
as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink
power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible
actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.
##### 7.6B.2.1.4.3 Message contents {#b.2.1.4.3-message-contents-2 .H6}
Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.6 Table 4.6.3-118
with condition TRANSFORM_PRECODER_ENABLED.
##### 7.6B.2.1.5 Test Requirement {#b.2.1.5-test-requirement-2 .H6}
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex A.3 and TS
38.521-1 [8] Annex A.3 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively with parameters
specified in Table 7.6B.2.1.5-1 for the specified wanted signal mean power in

DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.6B.2.3_1.2.4.1.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL
has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding
bits on the UL RMC.

+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].

the aggregated component carriers in Case 1 according to Table 7.6B.2.1.5-1.
5\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex H.2.
6\. Repeat steps from 4 to 5, using an interfering signal above the aggregated
component carriers in Case 1 at step 4.
7\. Repeat steps from 4 to 6, using interfering signals in Case 2 at steps 4
and 6.
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close

1\. Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in [6] TS 38.508-1
Annex A, in Figure A.3.1.4.2 for SS diagram and clause A.3.2 for UE diagram.
2\. The parameter settings for the cell are set up according to TS 38.508-1
[6] clause 4.4.3.
3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex
C and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex C for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively, and uplink
signals according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex H and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex G for
E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
4\. The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex
A.2, A.3 and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex A.2, A.3 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG
respectively.
5\. Propagation conditions are set according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex B.0 and
TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex B.0 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters
Connectivity EN-DC, DC bearer _MCG_ and _SCG_ , Connected without release _On_
according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.5. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6B.3.1.4.3.
7\. When E-UTRA and NR bands are TDD, ensure the same uplink-downlink
configuration by giving SCG a delay of 3 E-UTRA subframes, or by giving MCG a
delay of 2 subframes.
##### 7.6B.3.1.4.2 Test procedure {#b.3.1.4.2-test-procedure-1 .H6}
1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A and PDCCH DCI format 1_1 for
C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table 7.6B.3.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC
and NR CC respectively. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.6B.3.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
3\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.6B.3.1.5-1. For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands to
the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured
by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU
to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power level in
Table 7.6B.3.1.5-1 for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement,
where:
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
4\. Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal
below the aggregated component carriers according to Table 7.6B.3.1.5-1. The
frequency step size is 1MHz.
5\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex H.2 in TS 38.521-1 [8] for NR
band, and Annex G.2 of TS 36.521-1 [10] for EUTRA band.
6\. Record the frequencies for which the throughput doesn\'t meet the
requirements.
7\. Repeat steps from 4 to 6, using an interfering signal above the aggregated
component carriers at step 4.
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close
as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink
power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible
actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.
##### 7.6B.3.1.4.3 Message contents {#b.3.1.4.3-message-contents-1 .H6}
Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.6 Table 4.6.3-118
with condition TRANSFORM_PRECODER_ENABLED.
##### 7.6B.3.1.5 Test Requirement {#b.3.1.5-test-requirement-1 .H6}
Except for the spurious response frequencies recorded in step 6 of test
procedure, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channels as specified in TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex A.3 and
TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex A.3 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively with parameters
specified in Table 7.6B.3.1.5-1 for the specified wanted signal mean power in
the presence of interfering signals.
The number of spurious response frequencies recorded in step 6 of test
procedure shall not exceed exceptions in each assigned frequency channel when
measured using a 1MHz step size. For these exceptions the requirements of
clause 7.7B Spurious Response are applicable.

combination** as specified in Table 5.3B.1.2-1 across bandwidth combination
sets supported by the UE Highest N~RB_agg~ (NOTE 1) NOTE 1: If the UE supports
multiple CC Combinations in the EN-DC Configuration with the same NRB_agg ,
only the combination with the highest NRB_SCG is tested.
The initial test configurations for E-UTRA consist of test frequency based on
E-UTRA operating band and test channel bandwidth as specified in Table 4.6-1
except for the parameters specified in Table 7.6B.3.2.4-1.
For Initial conditions as in clause 7.6.3.4.1 in TS 38.521-1 [8], add step 2.1

replaced by:
6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters
Connectivity EN-DC, DC bearer MCG and SCG, Connected without release _On_
according to TS 38.508 [6] clause 4.5.
Add steps 7 and 8 to Initial conditions in clause 7.6.3.4.1 in TS 38.521-1 [8]

##### 7.6B.3.3.1 Test Purpose {#b.3.3.1-test-purpose-2 .H6}
Out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal
falling more than 15 MHz or 3*CBW below or above the UE receive band, at which
a given average throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the
specified measurement channels.
For the first 15 MHz or 3*CBW below or above the UE receive band the
appropriate in-band blocking or adjacent channel selectivity in clause
7.6B.2.3 and clause 7.5B.3 shall be applied.
The lack of out-of-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when
other NodeB transmitters exist (except in the adjacent channels and spurious
response).

##### 7.6B.3.3.4.2 Test procedure {#b.3.3.4.2-test-procedure .H6}
1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A and PDCCH DCI format 1_1 for
C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table 7.6B.3.3.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC
and NR CC respectively. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.6B.3.3.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
3\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.6B.3.3.5-1, Table 7.6B.3.3.5-3, or Table 7.6B.3.3.5-5 for E-UTRA CC and NR
CC respectively. For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands
to the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power
measured by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined
as -MU to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of (P~CMAX_L,c~ - 4dB)
for E-UTRA CC, and of 29 dB below P~CMAX_L,f,c~ for NR CC for at least the
duration of the Throughput measurement, where:
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
4\. Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal
below the aggregated component carriers according to Table 7.6B.3.3.5-4 or
Table 7.6B.3.3.5-6. The frequency step size is MHz.
> If CW interferer falls in a gap between F~DL_high~ of the E-UTRA or NR band
> and F~DL_low~ of the NR or EUTRA band, where the corresponding OOB ranges 1

> For EN-DC combination listed in Table 7.6B.3.3.5-7, exceptions to the
> requirement specified in Table 7.6B.3.3.5-8 are allowed when the second
> order intermodulation product of the lower frequency band UL carrier and the
> CW interfering signal fully or partially overlaps with the higher frequency
> band DL carrier.
5\. Measure the average throughput of NR CC for a duration sufficient to
achieve statistical significance according to Annex H.2. Record the
frequencies for which the throughput doesn\'t meet the requirements.
6\. Repeat steps from 4 to 5, using an interfering signal above the aggregated
component carriers at step 4.
7\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.6B.3.3.5-1, Table 7.6B.3.3.5-3, or Table 7.6B.3.3.5-5 for E-UTRA CC and NR
CC respectively. For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands
to the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power
measured by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined
as -MU to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of (P~CMAX_L,f,c~ - 4dB)
for NR CC, and of 29 dB below P~CMAX_L,c~ for E-UTRA CC for at least the
duration of the Throughput measurement, where:

[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].

> ranges, then the OOB range shall start from the F~DL_low~ of the lower
> E-UTRA or NR band, and from the F~DL_high~ of the upper NR or E-UTRA band.
9\. Measure the average throughput of E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively for a
duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex
H.2. Record the frequencies for which the throughput doesn\'t meet the
requirements.
10\. Repeat steps from 8 to 9, using an interfering signal above the
aggregated component carriers at step 8.
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close
as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink
power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible
actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.

##### 7.6B.3.3_1.1 Out-of-band blocking for EN-DC within FR1 (3 CCs)
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.1.1 Test Purpose {#b.3.3_1.1.1-test-purpose .H6}
Out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal
falling more than 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band, at which a given
average throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the specified
measurement channels.
For the first 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band the appropriate in-
band blocking or adjacent channel selectivity in clause 7.6B.2.1 and clause
7.5B.1 shall be applied.
The lack of out-of-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when
other NodeB transmitters exist (except in the adjacent channels and spurious
response).
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.1.2 Test Applicability {#b.3.3_1.1.2-test-applicability .H6}
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 15 and forward,
supporting intra-band contiguous EN-DC within FR1 with 3 DL CCs.
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.1.3 Minimum Conformance Requirements {#b.3.3_1.1.3-minimum-
conformance-requirements .H6}
The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.6B.3.0.1.
Exception requirements for both NR and E-UTRA are defined for this test and
therefore LTE anchor agnostic approach is not applied. E-UTRA test point
analysis is included and E-UTRA measurements are performed.
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.1.4 Test Description {#b.3.3_1.1.4-test-description .H6}
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.1.4.1 Initial condition {#b.3.3_1.1.4.1-initial-condition
.H6}
Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE needs to be tested
in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the correct
measurement state.
The initial test configurations consist of environmental conditions, test
frequencies and channel bandwidths based on EN-DC operating bands specified in
clause 5.3B.1.2, channel bandwidths and sub-carrier spacings for the NR cell
specified in TS 38.521-1 [8] clause 5.3 and channel bandwidth for the E-UTRA
cell are specified in TS 36.521-1 [10] clause 5.4.2. All of these

according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.5. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6B.3.3_1.1.4.3.
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.1.4.2 Test procedure {#b.3.3_1.1.4.2-test-procedure .H6}
1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A and PDCCH DCI format 1_1 for
C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table 7.6B.3.3_1.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA
CC and NR CC respectively. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL
RMC.
2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.6B.3.3_1.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has
no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits
on the UL RMC.
3\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.6B.3.3_1.1.5-1. For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands
to the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power
measured by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined
as -MU to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power
level in Table 7.6B.3.3_1.1.5-1 +( [10log(S_L~CRB~/N~RB_alloc~)] for NR CC,
[10log(P_L~CRB~/N~RB_alloc~)] for E-UTRA CC) for at least the duration of the
Throughput measurement, where:
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
4\. Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal
below the aggregated component carriers according to Table 7.6B.3.3_1.1.5-1.
The frequency step size is 1MHz.
5\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex H.2.
6\. Repeat steps from 4 to 5, using an interfering signal above the aggregated
component carriers at step 4.
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close
as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink
power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible
actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.1.4.3 Message contents {#b.3.3_1.1.4.3-message-contents .H6}
Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.6 Table 4.6.3-118
with condition TRANSFORM_PRECODER_ENABLED.
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.1.5 Test Requirement {#b.3.3_1.1.5-test-requirement .H6}
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex A.3 and TS
38.521-1 [8] Annex A.3 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively with parameters
specified in Table 7.6B.3.3_1.1.5-1 for the specified wanted signal mean power
in the presence of interfering signals.

##### 7.6B.3.3_1.2 Out-of-band blocking for EN-DC within FR1 (4 CCs)
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.2.1 Test Purpose {#b.3.3_1.2.1-test-purpose .H6}
Out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal
falling more than 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band, at which a given
average throughput shall meet or exceed the requirement for the specified
measurement channels.
For the first 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band the appropriate in-
band blocking or adjacent channel selectivity in clause 7.6B.2.1 and clause
7.5B.1 shall be applied.
The lack of out-of-band blocking ability will decrease the coverage area when
other NodeB transmitters exist (except in the adjacent channels and spurious
response).
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.2.2 Test Applicability {#b.3.3_1.2.2-test-applicability .H6}
This test case applies to all types of E-UTRA UE release 15 and forward,
supporting intra-band contiguous EN-DC within FR1 with 4 DL CCs.
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.2.3 Minimum Conformance Requirements {#b.3.3_1.2.3-minimum-
conformance-requirements .H6}
The minimum conformance requirements are defined in clause 7.6B.3.0.1.
Exception requirements for both NR and E-UTRA are defined for this test and
therefore LTE anchor agnostic approach is not applied. E-UTRA test point
analysis is included and E-UTRA measurements are performed.
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.2.4 Test Description {#b.3.3_1.2.4-test-description .H6}
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.2.4.1 Initial condition {#b.3.3_1.2.4.1-initial-condition
.H6}

according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.5. Message contents are defined in
clause 7.6B.3.3_1.2.4.3.
##### 7.6B.3.3_1.2.4.2 Test procedure {#b.3.3_1.2.4.2-test-procedure .H6}
1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A and PDCCH DCI format 1_1 for
C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table 7.6B.3.3_1.2.4.1-1 on E-UTRA
CC and NR CC respectively. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL
RMC.
2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.6B.3.3_1.2.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has
no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits
on the UL RMC.
3\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.6B.3.3_1.2.5-1. For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands
to the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power
measured by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined
as -MU to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power
level in Table 7.6B.3.3_1.2.5-1 +( [10log(S_L~CRB~/N~RB_alloc~)] for NR CC,
[10log(P_L~CRB~/N~RB_alloc~)] for E-UTRA CC) for at least the duration of the
Throughput measurement, where:
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
4\. Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal
below the aggregated component carriers according to Table 7.6B.3.3_1.2.5-1.
The frequency step size is 1MHz.
5\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex H.2.
6\. Repeat steps from 4 to 5, using an interfering signal above the aggregated
component carriers at step 4.
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close
as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink
power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible
actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.

1\. Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in [6] TS 38.508-1
Annex A, in Figure A.3.1.4.2 for SS diagram and clause A.3.2 for UE diagram.
2\. The parameter settings for the E-UTRA cell are set up according to TS
36.508 [11] clause 4.4.3, and the parameter settings for the NR cell are set
up according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.4.3.
3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex
C and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex C for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively, and uplink
signals according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex H and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex G for
E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
4\. The UL and DL Reference Measurement channels are TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex
A.2, A.3 and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex A.2 , A.3 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG
respectively.
5\. Propagation conditions are set according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex B.0 and
TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex B.0 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters

##### 7.6B.4.1.4.2 Test procedure {#b.4.1.4.2-test-procedure-1 .H6}
1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A and PDCCH DCI format 1_1 for
C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table 7.6B.4.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC
and NR CC respectively. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.6B.4.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
3\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.6B.4.1.5-1. For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands to
the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured
by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU
to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power level in
Table 7.6B.4.1.5-1 for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement,
where:
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) = 1.7dB, where, the UE power step tolerance is
specified in TS 38.101-1 [2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step
size.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) = 2.0dB, where, the UE power step tolerance
is specified in TS 36.101 [5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power
step size.
4\. Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal
below the aggregated component carriers according to Table 7.6B.4.1.5-1.
5\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex H.2.
6\. Repeat steps from 4 to 5, using an interfering signal above the aggregated
component carriers at step 4.
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close
as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink
power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible
actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.

##### 7.6B.4.3_1.1.4.1.2 Test procedure {#b.4.3_1.1.4.1.2-test-procedure .H6}
1\. SS transmits PDSCH via PDCCH DCI format 1A and PDCCH DCI format 1_1 for
C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table 7.6B.4.3_1.1.4.1.1-1 on
E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on
the DL RMC.
2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.6B.4.3_1.1.4.1.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL
has no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding
bits on the UL RMC.
3\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.6B.4.1.5-1. For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands to
the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured
by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU
to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power level in
Table 7.6B.4.1.5-1 +( [10log(S_L~CRB~/N~RB_alloc~)] for NR CC,
[10log(P_L~CRB~/N~RB_alloc~)] for E-UTRA CC) for at least the duration of the
Throughput measurement, where:
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
4\. Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal
below the aggregated component carriers according to Table 7.6B.4.1.5-1.
5\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex H.2.
6\. Repeat steps from 4 to 5, using an interfering signal above the aggregated
component carriers at step 4.
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close
as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink
power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible
actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.

given degradation due to the presence of an unwanted CW interfering signal at
any other frequency at which a response is obtained i.e. for which the out of

C_RNTI to transmit the DL RMC according to Table 7.6B.3.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC
and NR CC respectively. The SS sends downlink MAC padding bits on the DL RMC.
2\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
Table 7.6B.3.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
3\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table 7.7B.1.5-1.
For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands to the UE using
1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured by the test
system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU to -(MU +
Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power level in Table
7.7B.1.5-1 for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement, where:
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW.
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
4\. Set the parameters of the CW signal generator for an interfering signal
according to Table 7.7B.1.5-1. The spurious frequencies are taken from records
in the final step of test procedures in clause 7.6B.3.1.4.2.
5\. For each spurious frequency, Measure the average throughput for a duration
sufficient to achieve statistical significance according to Annex H.2.
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close
as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink
power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible
actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.

requirements shall be applied per each component carrier. The requirements
specified in subclause 7.7E of TS 38.101-1 [2] shall apply for the NR sidelink
reception in Band n47 and the requirements specified in subclause 7.7.1 of TS
36.101 [5] shall apply for the E-UTRA downlink reception in licensed band
while all downlink carriers are active. The requirements specified in
subclause 7.7.1G of TS 36.101 [5] shall apply for the E-UTRA sidelink
reception and the requirements specified in subclause 7.7 of TS 38.101-1 [2]
shall apply for the NR downlink reception while all downlink carriers are
active.
The normative reference for this requirement is TS 38.101-3 [4] clause 7.7E.
### 7.7E.1 Spurious response for V2X operation
##### 7.7E.1.1 Test purpose {#e.1.1-test-purpose-1 .H6}
Spurious response verifies the receiver\'s ability to receive a wanted signal
on its assigned channel frequency without exceeding a given degradation due to
the presence of an unwanted CW interfering signal at any other frequency at
which a response is obtained i.e. for which the out of band blocking limit as
specified in sub-clause 7.6E.2 is not met.
The lack of the spurious response ability decreases the coverage area when
other unwanted interfering signal exists at any other frequency.
##### 7.7E.1.2 Test applicability {#e.1.2-test-applicability-1 .H6}
No exception requirements applicable to NR V2X operation or E-UTRA V2X
operation. The requirements in this test case can be well covered in clause
7.7 and 7.7G of TS 36.521-1 [10] and clause 7.7 and 7.7E of TS 38.521-1 [8]
and don't need to be tested again.

1\. Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in [6] TS 38.508-1
A.3.1.2.1 for SS diagram and A.3.2 for UE diagram.
2\. The parameter settings for the E-UTRA cell are set up according to TS
36.508 [11] clause 4.4.3, and the parameter settings for the NR cell are set
up according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.4.3.
3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex
C.0 and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex C.0 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively, and
uplink signals according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex H and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex
G for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex A.2 and
TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex A.2 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
5\. Propagation conditions are set according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex B.0 and
TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex B.0 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters

7\. When E-UTRA and NR bands are TDD, ensure the same uplink-downlink
configuration by giving SCG a delay of 3 E-UTRA subframes, or by giving MCG a
delay of 2 subframes.
##### 7.8B.2.1.4.2 Test procedure {#b.2.1.4.2-test-procedure-3 .H6}
1\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
table 7.8B.2.1.4.1-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has no
payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits on
the UL RMC.
2\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.8B.2.1.5-1. For NR CC and E-UTRA CC, send uplink power control commands to
the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured
by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU
to -(MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the target power level in
Table 7.8B.2.1.5-1 for at least the duration of the Throughput measurement,
where:
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW.
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size. and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
3\. Set the Interfering signal levels to the values as defined in Table
7.8B.2.1.5-1 and frequency below the wanted signal
4\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex G.2.
5\. Repeat steps from 2 to 4, using an interfering signal above the wanted
signal at step 3.
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than the target power level, and as close
as possible to the target power level. The relationship between the Uplink
power control window, the target power level and the corresponding possible
actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex F, clause F.4.
##### 7.8B.2.1.4.3 Message contents {#b.2.1.4.3-message-contents-3 .H6}
Message contents are according to TS 38.508-1 [5] clause 4.6 with DFT-s-OFDM
condition in Table 4.6.3-118 PUSCH-Config.
##### 7.8B.2.1.5 Test Requirement {#b.2.1.5-test-requirement-3 .H6}
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annex A.3.2 with parameters specified in

##### 7.8B.2.3_1.1.4.2 Test procedure {#b.2.3_1.1.4.2-test-procedure-1 .H6}
1\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
table 7.8B.2.3_1.1.4.2-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has
no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits
on the UL RMC.
2\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.8B.2.3_1.1.4.2-1. For E-UTRA CC and NR CC where uplink is allocated
according to Table 7.8B.2.3_1.1.4.1-1, send uplink power control commands to
the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured
by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU
to - (MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the 4dB below PCMAX_L with
PCMAX_L as defined in clause 6.2B.4 for at least the duration of the
Throughput measurement.
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW.
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than, or no less than the target power
level, and as close as possible to the target power level. The relationship
between the Uplink power control window, the target power level and the
corresponding possible actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex
F, clause F.4.
3\. Set the Interfering signal levels to the values as defined in Table
7.8B.2.3_1.1.4.2-1 and frequency below the wanted signal.
4\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex G, clause G.2.
5\. Repeat steps from 2 to 4, using an interfering signal above the wanted
signal at step 3.
6\. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for component carriers listed in Table

1\. Connect the SS to the UE antenna connectors as shown in [6] TS 38.508-1
A.3.1.2.1 for SS diagram and A.3.2 for UE diagram.
2\. The parameter settings for the E-UTRA cell are set up according to TS
36.508 [11] clause 4.4.3, and the parameter settings for the NR cell are set
up according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.4.3.
3\. Downlink signals are initially set up according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex
C.0 and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex C.0 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively, and
uplink signals according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex H and TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex
G for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
4\. The UL Reference Measurement channels are TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex A.2 and
TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex A.2 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
5\. Propagation conditions are set according to TS 36.521-1 [10] Annex B.0 and
TS 38.521-1 [8] Annex B.0 for E-UTRA CG and NR CG respectively.
6\. Ensure the UE is in state RRC_CONNECTED with generic procedure parameters
Connectivity EN-DC, DC bearer _MCG_ and _SCG_ , Connected without release _On_
according to TS 38.508-1 [6] clause 4.5. Message contents are defined in
clause 6.2B.1.1.4.3.
7\. For the E-UTRA CC(s) where anchor agnostic apply according to NOTE 4 in
Table 7.3B.2.3_1.2.4.1-1, downlink signal level and uplink signal level are
set according to Table 4.6-1 and propagation conditions are set according to

reports, disable SRS, set _TimeAlignmentTimerDedicated_ IE to infinity and
disable downlink and uplink scheduling, all as per Table 4.6-1 under clause
4.6.
##### 7.8B.2.3_1.2.4.2 Test procedure {#b.2.3_1.2.4.2-test-procedure-1 .H6}
1\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
table 7.8B.2.3_1.2.4.2-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has
no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits
on the UL RMC.
2\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.8B.2.3_1.2.4.2-1. For E-UTRA CC and NR CC where uplink is allocated
according to Table 7.8B.2.3_1.2.4.1-1, send uplink power control commands to
the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured
by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU
to - (MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the 4dB below PCMAX_L with
PCMAX_L as defined in clause 6.2B.4 for at least the duration of the
Throughput measurement.
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW.
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than, or no less than the target power
level, and as close as possible to the target power level. The relationship
between the Uplink power control window, the target power level and the
corresponding possible actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex
F, clause F.4.
3\. Set the Interfering signal levels to the values as defined in Table
7.8B.2.3_1.2.4.2-1 and frequency below the wanted signal.
4\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex G, clause G.2.
5\. Repeat steps from 2 to 4, using an interfering signal above the wanted
signal at step 3.
6\. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for component carriers listed in Table
7.8B.2.3_1.2.4.2-1.

##### 7.8B.2.3_1.3.4.2 Test procedure {#b.2.3_1.3.4.2-test-procedure-1 .H6}
1\. SS sends uplink scheduling information for each UL HARQ process via PDCCH
DCI format 0 and DCI format 0_1 for C_RNTI to schedule the UL RMC according to
table 7.8B.2.3_1.3.4.2-1 on E-UTRA CC and NR CC respectively. Since the UL has
no payload and no loopback data to send the UE sends uplink MAC padding bits
on the UL RMC.
2\. Set the Downlink signal level to the value as defined in Table
7.8B.2.3_1.3.4.2-1. For E-UTRA CC and NR CC where uplink is allocated
according to Table 7.8B.2.3_1.3.4.1-1, send uplink power control commands to
the UE using 1dB power step size to ensure that the UE output power measured
by the test system is within the Uplink power control window, defined as -MU
to - (MU + Uplink power control window size) dB of the 4dB below PCMAX_L with
PCMAX_L as defined in clause 6.2B.4 for at least the duration of the
Throughput measurement.
\- MU is the test system uplink power measurement uncertainty and is specified
in Table F.1.3-1 for the carrier frequency f and the channel bandwidth BW.
\- For NR CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size) +
0.7dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 38.101-1
[2], Table 6.3.4.3-1 and is 0.7dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test system
relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1.
\- For E-UTRA CC, Uplink power control window size = 1dB (UE power step size)
+ 1.0dB (UE power step tolerance) + (Test system relative power measurement
uncertainty), where, the UE power step tolerance is specified in TS 36.101
[5], Table 6.3.5.2.1-1 and is 1.0dB for 1dB power step size, and the Test
system relative power measurement uncertainty is specified in Table F.1.2-1 of
TS 36.521-1 [10].
NOTE: The purpose of the Uplink power control window is to ensure that the
actual UE output power is no greater than, or no less than the target power
level, and as close as possible to the target power level. The relationship
between the Uplink power control window, the target power level and the
corresponding possible actual UE Uplink power window is illustrated in Annex
F, clause F.4.
3\. Set the Interfering signal levels to the values as defined in Table
7.8B.2.3_1.3.4.2-1 and frequency below the wanted signal.
4\. Measure the average throughput for a duration sufficient to achieve
statistical significance according to Annex G, clause G.2.
5\. Repeat steps from 2 to 4, using an interfering signal above the wanted
signal at step 3.
6\. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for component carriers listed in Table
7.8B.2.3_1.3.4.2-1.

###### ## Annex A (normative): Measurement Channels
Please refer to Annex A in TS 38.521-1 [8] and 38.521-2 [9] for appropriate
details as needed for test cases in this test specification. EN-DC exceptions
will be added.
# A.1 General
The throughput values defined in the measurement channels specified in Annex
A, are calculated and are valid per datastream (codeword). For multi-stream
(more than one codeword) transmissions, the throughput referenced in the
minimum requirements is the sum of throughputs of all datastreams (codewords).
The UE category entry in the definition of the reference measurement channel
in Annex A is only informative and reveals the UE categories, which can
support the corresponding measurement channel. Whether the measurement channel
is used for testing a certain UE category or not is specified in the
individual minimum requirements.
# A.2 UL reference measurement channels for E-UTRA TDD Config 2
## A.2.1 General
The measurement channels in the following clauses are defined to derive the
requirements in clause 6 (Transmitter Characteristics) and clause 7 (Receiver
Characteristics). The measurement channels represent example configurations of
physical channels for different data rates.

# A.3 DL reference measurement channels for E-UTRA
## A.3.1 General
The number of available channel bits varies across the sub-frames due to PBCH
and PSS/SSS overhead. The payload size per sub-frame is varied in order to
keep the code rate constant throughout a frame.
Unless otherwise stated, no user data is scheduled on subframes #5 in order to
facilitate the transmission of system information blocks (SIB).
The algorithm for determining the payload size _A_ is as follows; given a
desired coding rate _R_ and radio block allocation _N_ ~RB~
1\. Calculate the number of channel bits _N_ ~ch~ that can be transmitted
during the first transmission of a given sub-frame.
2\. Find _A_ such that the resulting coding rate is as close to _R_ as
possible, that is,
{width="3.654861111111111in" height="0.5in"},
subject to
a) A is a valid TB size according to clause 7.1.7 of TS 36.213 [6] assuming an
allocation of _N_ ~RB~ resource blocks.
b) _C_ is the number of Code Blocks calculated according to clause 5.1.2 of TS
36.212 [5].
3\. If there is more than one _A_ that minimizes the equation above, then the
larger value is chosen per default and the chosen code rate should not exceed
0.93.
4\. For TDD, the measurement channel is based on DL/UL configuration ratio of
3DL+DwPTS (10 OFDM symbol SSF7): 1UL.

### F.4.4.2 NR FR2
Information from the core requirements in TS 38.101-2 [3], TS 38.213 [19] and
the uncertainties in Annex F applicable to the Test case are used to derive
the uplink power window. There are 4 stages:
\- Find the uplink power target value.
\- Determine how closely the uplink power can be set to the target value.
\- Include the effect of test system uncertainty.
\- Position the Uplink power window centred on the target value.
This process is shown in the diagram below, using values for FR2a and P~UMAX~
≥ P > P~int~ and taking an example where the target value is +15dBm:

Please refer to Annex G in TS 38.521-1 [8] and TS 38.521-2 [9] for appropriate
details as needed for test cases in this test specification. EN-DC exceptions
will be added,
###### ## Annex H (normative): Statistical Testing
Editor\'s Note:
\- Further investigate the technical details behind this statistical method to
ensure that this is applicable for FR2 radiated test cases.
## H.1 General
This annex specifies mapping throughput to error ratio, pass fail limits and
pass fail decision rules that are needed for measuring average throughput for
a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance for testing receiver
characteristics.
## H.2 Statistical testing of receiver characteristics
### H.2.1 General
The test of receiver characteristics is twofold.
1\. A signal or a combination of signals is offered to the RX port(s) of the
receiver.
2\. The ability of the receiver to demodulate /decode this signal is verified
by measuring the throughput.
In (2) is the statistical aspect of the test and is treated here.
The minimum requirement for all receiver tests is >95% of the maximum
throughput.
All receiver tests are performed in static propagation conditions. No fading
conditions are applied.
### H.2.2 Mapping throughput to error ratio
a) The measured information bit throughput R is defined as the sum (in
kilobits) of the information bit payloads successfully received during the
test interval, divided by the duration of the test interval (in seconds).
b) In measurement practice the UE indicates successfully received information
bit payload by signalling an ACK to the SS.\ If payload is received, but
damaged and cannot be decoded, the UE signals a NACK.
c) Only the ACK and NACK signals, not the data bits received, are accessible
to the SS.\ The number of bits is known in the SS from knowledge of what
payload was sent.
d) For the reference measurement channel, applied for testing, the number of
bits is different in different slots, however in a radio frame it is fixed
during one test.
e) The time in the measurement interval is composed of successfully received
slots (ACK), unsuccessfully received slots (NACK) and no reception at all
(DTX-slots).
f) DTX-slots may occur regularly according the applicable reference
measurement channel (regDTX).\ In real live networks this is the time when
other UEs are served. In TDD these are the UL and special slots.\ regDTX vary
from test to test but are fixed within the test.
g) Additional DTX-slots occur statistically when the UE is not responding ACK
or NACK where it should. (statDTX)\ This may happen when the UE was not
expecting data or decided that the data were not intended for it.
The pass / fail decision is done by observing the:
\- number of NACKs
\- number of ACKs and
\- number of statDTXs (regDTX is implicitly known to the SS)
The ratio (NACK + statDTX)/(NACK+ statDTX + ACK)is the Error Ratio (ER).
Taking into account the time consumed by the ACK, NACK, and DTX-TTIs (regular
and statistical), ER can be mapped unambiguously to throughput for any single
reference measurement channel test.
### H.2.3 Design of the test
The test is defined by the following design principles (see clause H.x,
Theory....):
1\. The early decision concept is applied.
2\. A second limit is introduced: Bad DUT factor M>1
3\. To decide the test pass:
\- Supplier risk is applied based on the Bad DUT quality
\- To decide the test fail
\- Customer Risk is applied based on the specified DUT quality
The test is defined by the following parameters:
1\. Limit ER = 0.05 (Throughput limit = 95%)
2\. Bad DUT factor M=1.5 (selectivity)
3\. Confidence level CL = 95% (for specified DUT and Bad DUT-quality)

### H.2.5 Pass fail decision rules
The pass fail decision rules apply for a single test, comprising one component
in the test vector. The over all Pass /Fail conditions are defined in clause
H.2.6and H.2A.6
Having observed 0 errors, pass the test at 67+ samples, otherwise continue
Having observed 1 error, pass the test at 95+ otherwise continue
Having observed 2 errors, pass the test at 119+ samples, fail the test at 2-
samples, otherwise continue
Etc. etc.
Having observed 151 errors, pass the test at 2452+ samples, fail the test at
2433- samples, otherwise continue
Having observed 152 errors, pass the test at 2466+ samples, fail the test at
2451- samples.
Where x+ means: x or more, x- means x or less
NOTE 1: an ideal DUT passes after 67 samples. The maximum test time is 2466
samples.
NOTE 2: It is allowed to deviate from the early decision concept by postponing
the decision (pass/fail or continue). Postponing the decision to or beyond the
end of Table H.2.4-1 requires a pass fail decision against the test limit:
