# 4 Background
In RAN#95e, SI "enhancement for 700800900MHz band combinations" was approved.
**The objectives of SI are as follows:**
1 Investigate the feasibility and solutions to enable simultaneous
transmission on two UL bands and simultaneous reception on two or three bands
for the band combination of 700, 800 and 900MHz spectrum for smart phone form
factor
2 The following band combinations will be considered. And the feasibility
study on three band combination will start after the completion of feasibility
study of all the fallback band combinations.
\- CA_n8-n20-n28 with uplink configurations of CA_n8-n20, CA_n8-n28,
CA_n20-n28, and the fallback modes
\- CA_n5-n8 with uplink configuration of CA_n5-n8, and the fallback modes
Note1: Spectrum restrictions should be studied to solve overlap of band n5
downlink and band n8 uplink
Note2: The current filter is used as the baseline. Further study whether or
not to have new solutions.
\- CA_n5-n28 (full range) with uplink configuration of CA_n5-n28.
In RAN 99 a new SI [5] was approved. This SI concerns the consideration of the
APT 600 MHz band (n105) that has been recently has been introduced into 3GPP
specifications [6]. After the completion of APT 600MHz band, operators have
the further demands to combine this 600MHz band with other sub-1GHz bands
together to achieve a good performance for the real deployment. However, some
challenges were identified for a device with a smart phone form factor to
support the combinations of those low bands including 600MHz band. For
example, UE RF architecture need to be further studied due to larger antenna
size for 600MHz band and some RF requirements need to be evaluated, e.g. MSD.
The previous SI on Enhancement for 700/800/900MHz band combinations didn't
include the evaluation and studies for 600MHz band. Additionally band 26 is
also considered.

# 5 Specific Band combinations
## 5.1 CA_n5-n8
### 5.1.0 General
Generally, in this study item, some high level implementations were discussed
and shown as below.
1) Full band n5 and n8 RF filters implementation with option 1 and option2:
\- Option 1: Only support 1UL/2DL CA. Single UL in n5
\- Option 2: Support both 1UL/2DL and 2UL/2DL CA. Non-concurrent n5 DL and n8
UL
Note: Potential impacts on RAN2 are observed
2) Dedicated RF filters implementation with partial frequency range
\- Option 3: Support both 1UL/2DL and 2UL/2DL CA. Dedicated filter to allow
simultaneous n5 DL and n8 UL
### 5.1.1 UE RF architecture assumption
The following UE RF architectures can be assumed in the future meetings'
analysis for CA_n5-n8: 2 antenna, 3 antenna. The antenna number is the total
number of antennas to support Main UL/DL and diversity DL for all bands.
**Due to the frequency range overlap between n5 DL and n8 UL, one possibility
to enable CA_n5-n8 operation with 2-antenna implementation is to allow non-
simultaneous Rx/Tx between n5 DL and n8 UL or single UL in n5 only to avoid n5
REFSENS impact due to n8 UL transmission. With that the filter isolation
between n5 DL and n8 UL would no longer be needed and a triplexer can be used
to provide the semi-full-duplex carrier aggregation to a single antenna in the
main path, as is shown in Figure 5.1.1-1. On the other hand, since the
triplexer center band range is over 5% bandwidth ratio (band range divided by
center frequency) and the frequency gap between center band and n8 DL is only
10 MHz which may pose design challenge on achieving acceptable filter
isolation and insertion loss, the feasibility of a single triplexer for
CA_n5-n8 needs to be studied.**

Figure 5.1.1-1 Possible CA_n5-n8 UE architecture and operation diagram for
semi-full-duplex CA
Another architecture variant with 2-antenna implementation is to move n8 UL to
the diversity path as is shown in Figure 5.1.1-2 which may potentially ease
the triplexer design in the main TRx path owing to the narrower middle band
range and wider frequency separation between n5 DL and n8 DL. The filter
design challenge however would be shifted to the diversity TRx path duplexer
due to the wider band range to cover n5 DL and n8 UL.

Figure 5.1.1-2 Possible CA_n5-n8 UE architecture based on 2-antenna
implementation
For the 3-antenna implementation, the two of the three antenna are used in the
main path to aggregate the n5 and n8 signals over the air, as shown in Figure
5.1.1-3. As n5 and n8 signals do not need to be combined through a
multiplexer, there is no additional insertion loss in both n5 and n8 main
signal paths as compared to single-band implementation.
Having two antenna in the main signal path not only avoids the more
complicated multiplexer implementation and the associated additional insertion
losses, but also allows narrower frequency coverage for each of the two
antenna as compared to single-antenna implementation which can be up to 348
MHz (from n105 to n8) to support all the sub-1GHz bands above 600 MHz as
defined in 3GPP. On the other hand, the additional antenna cannot be added
without occupying more phone space. Therefore, the feasibility on placing more
than two low-band antenna in a smartphone needs to be investigated with the
concern of the expected narrower bandwidth and regressed radiating performance
due to the limitation in form factor.

Figure 5.1.1-3 CA_n5-n8 UE architecture based on the 3-antenna implementation
Despite the 3-antenna implementation can help reduce n8 UL interfering n5 DL
via antenna isolation which however is far from sufficient even under the
restricted frequency ranges for CA operation where n8 UL does not overlap with
n5 DL. Therefore, semi-full-duplex operation with non-simultaneous Rx/Tx
between n5 DL and n8 UL as diagramed in Figure 5.1.1-1 is still required for
the CA combination.
In consideration of the operation frequency ranges restriction for this
specific band combination as is shown below,
\- n5r: UL 824 - 835 MHz; DL 869 - 880 MHz
\- n8r: UL 904 - 915 MHz; DL 949 - 960 MHz
{width="6.696527777777778in" height="1.3444444444444446in"}
Figure 5.1.1-4 CA_n5-n8 restricted spectrum range
Dedicated filter implementation may be considered to potentially enable
2UL/2DL simultaneous operation. Due to the frequency range restriction on the
dedicated filters, additional full-band duplexers for either or both n5 and n8
would be required in order to support the single-band full-band operation.
Figure 5.1.1-5 and Figure 5.1.1-6 show the architecture diagrams with
dedicated quadplexer in main TRx path based on 2-antenna implementation where
the former uses both partial ranges for n5 and n8 in the quadplexer and the
latter uses partial range only for n8 UL in the **quadplexer.**

Figure 5.1.1-7 and Figure 5.1.1-8 show the architecture diagrams with
dedicated duplexers for both n5 and n8 and n8 UL only respectively in main TRx
path based on 3-antenna implementation.
Dedicated filter based on specific frequency range restriction for operation
bands usually is not a common practice in UE implementation as it adds
additional cost and area to the devices.

In the architecture of Figure 5.1.1-9, dedicated triplexers are used. In this
architecture, UL's are transmitted from different antennas, which may help in
optimizing the TRP for each of the UL's resulting in better coverage.

Based on the analysis above, there is no need to specify harmonics and

#### 5.1.2.4 ∆TIB,c and ∆RIB,c values
For CA_n5-n8, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ are given in the tables below
considering both 2-antenna and 3--antenna implementations. If 3-antenna
implementation is assumed, there isn't any additional insertion loss observed
for CA_n5-n8 compared with single carrier operation. If it's assumed to derive
the the delta Tib and Rib requirements for CA_n5-n8 based on 3--antenna
implementation, all the values can be zero. If 2-antenna implementation is
assumed to derive these values, the some delta Tib and Rib values for CA_n5-n8
are provided from interested companies as below.

#### 5.1.2.5 REFSENS evaluation
For option 1 of full band n5 and n8 RF filters implementation, the scheduling
is restricted as DL_n5-n8_UL_n5 and the concurrent operation between DL band
n5 and UL band n8 can't work. There may be some MSD for band n8 DL due to band
n5 UL interference. Some legacy filters exhibit the flyback effect into n8 DL
reducing the rejection of the n5 TX OOB leakage for no MSD
For option 3 of dedicated RF filters implementation with partial frequency
range, the MSD test point and values due to cross band isolation between DL
band n5 and UL band n8 in Table 5 are provided referring to R4-2300759.

### 5.1.3 Specific for 2 bands UL of CA_n5-n8
#### 5.1.3.0 General
Option 2 full band n5 and n8 RF filters implementation can support both
DL_n8_UL_n5-n8 and DL_n5-n8_UL_n5 features.
Option 3 dedicated RF filter(s) implementation with partial frequency range
can support DL_n5-n8_UL_n5-n8 feature.
Thus, the following technical analysis in clause 5.1.3 is based on these kinds
of candidate options and implementations.
#### 5.1.3.1 Maximum output power for inter-band CA
Power class 3 is assumed for UL CA_n5-n8.

#### 5.1.3.3 REFSENS evaluation
Based on the assumption of restricted frequency range for CA_n5-n8, there is
no MSD issue due to intermodulation interference. 2UL Cross-band MSD may be
needed.
### 5.1.4 Feasible RF implementations
Referring to clause 5.1.0 and 5.1.1 UE RF architecture assumption, it can be
observed that two sets of different RF implementations are included currently:
One is full band n5 and n8 RF filters implementation.
Another one is dedicated RF filters implementation with partial frequency
range.
These two implementation may have different RF requirements and scheduling
restriction. In study phase, we list all the implementations on the table and
further trade off each implementation as below.
Table 5.1.4-1: Trade-off between the feasible RF implementations

As all the implementations are not excluded and UE can support them
optionally, a solution is needed to further distinguish these different
implementations. The following options can be further discussed.
\- Option 1: New bands would be required.
\- Option 2: New bands would not be required. An optional
signalling/capability solution can be designed for the BS and UE to
distinguish these different implementations.
\- Option 3: Other are not precluded.
## 5.2 CA_n5-n28
### 5.2.1 UE RF architecture assumption
The n5 filter parameter assumption in the analysis is based on without sharing
path of band n26.
The UE RF architectures with 2 antenna and 3 antenna can be assumed in the
feasibility study for CA_n5-n28.The antenna number is the total number of
antennas to support Main UL/DL and diversity DL for all bands. Figure
5.2.1.0-1 shows the aggregated spectrum allocation for CA_n5-n28 where no
frequency range restriction has been indicated for either of the constituent
bands.

Figure 5.2.1.0-1 CA_n5-n28 aggregated spectrum allocation
#### 5.2.1.1 UE RF architecture with two antennas
For CA_n5-n28 with 2-antenna implementation, there are two potential UE RF
architectures as shown in Figure 5.2.1.1-1.
{width="6.688194444444444in" height="2.5083333333333333in"}
Figure 5.2.1.1-1 Potential UE architecture variants to support CA_n5-n28 with
2 antenna
The topology for 2 antenna architecture a is listed as below.
\- 1) n28UL+n28DL+n5UL+n5DL quadplexer on antenna 1
\- 2) n5DL+n28DL duplexer on antenna 2
The topology for 2 antenna architecture b is listed as below.
\- 1) n5UL+n5DL+n28DL triplexer on antenna 1
\- 2) n28UL+n28DL+n5DL triplexer on antenna 2
**[Considering the maximum simultaneously covered spectrum range and closely
spaced UL and DL bands, the following challenges and issues impacting UE RF
performance for 2-antenna architecture variant (a) can be anticipated:**
\- The main antenna design needs to cover the entire spectrum range of 191 MHz
simultaneously as shown in Figure 5.2.1-1, which is equivalent to a 24%
bandwidth ratio and that would exceed the bandwidth ratio for a typical planar
antenna design in a smartphone. As a result, the radiative performance for the
combination likely would be compromised.
\- The feasibility of a single quadplexer is questionable as n28 alone already
requires a dual duplexer to reduce the band range to duplex gap ratio in order
to achieve the acceptable filter isolation and insertion loss performance.
Dual quadplexer has the implication on UE front-end design complexity, area,
and cost impacts.
\- REFSENS degradation (MSD) on n28 DL caused by frequency proximity between
n5 UL and n28 DL and insufficient cross-band isolation.
**For 2-antenna architecture variant (b), the following challenges and issues
impacting UE RF performance can be anticipated:**
\- Compared to variant (a), though the main path frequency range is reduced
from 191 MHz to 136 MHz, the diversity path frequency range however is
increased from 136 MHz to 191 MHz. From antenna design perspective, the same
challenge with 24% antenna bandwidth ratio as in variant (a) is expected.
\- The feasibility of a single triplexer for diversity path is questionable as
n28 alone already requires a dual duplexer to reduce the band range to duplex
gap ratio in order to achieve the acceptable filter isolation and insertion
loss performance. Dual triplexer in diversity path in conjunction with a
single or dual triplexer in main path has the implication on UE front-end
design complexity, area, and cost impacts.
\- REFSENS degradation (MSD) on n28 DL caused by frequency proximity between
n5 UL and n28 DL and insufficient cross-band isolation.]
#### 5.2.1.2 UE RF architecture with three antennas
For CA_n5-n28 with 3-antenna implementation, the following UE RF architectures
can be considered, as shown in Figure 5.2.1.2-1.
{width="4.967361111111111in" height="2.7215277777777778in"}
Figure 5.2.1.2-1 CA_n5-n28 UE architecture based on the 3-antenna
implementation
The topology for the above 3 antenna architecture is listed as below:
1) n28UL+n28DL duplexer on antenna 1
2) n5UL+n5DL duplexer on antenna 2
3) n5DL+n28DL duplexer on antenna 3
### 5.2.2 Common for 1 band UL and 2 bands UL of CA_n5-n28
#### 5.2.2.0 General
According to the current spec TS 38.101-1, DL CA_n5A-n28A_BCS0 has been
specified. Thus, some of RF requirements can be reused as below.

#### 5.2.2.2 Channel bandwidths per operating band for CA
Referring to table 5.5A.3.1-1e of TS 38.101-1, DL_n5A-n28A_BCS0 has been
specified
#### 5.2.2.3 UE co-existence studies
There is no need to specify harmonics and harmonics mixing exception for
CA_n5-n28 as we didn't specify them in current spec.
#### 5.2.2.4 ∆TIB,c and ∆RIB,c values
For CA_n5-n28 with 2 antenna implementation, the ∆TIB,c and ∆RIB,c values has
been specified in TS 38.101-1.
Referring to contribution R4-2300657, it is suggest to reuse the DC_28_n5
∆TIB,c and ∆RIB,c values with an additional 0.2dB to all to enable the two-
antenna n-plexers in the future and including the support of full band n28,
which are shown below:

Referring to contribution R4-2302253, the most straightforward way would be to
use the same test point for 2UL MSD due to Cross-Band Isolation as has been
used for 1UL Cross-band Isolation for 2 antenna implementation, which is shown
in **Table 5.2.3.3-4:**

Referring to contribution R4-2218129, for 2UL MSD due to Cross-Band Isolation
as has been used for 1UL Cross-band Isolation for 3 antenna implementation is
shown in **Table 5.2.3.3-5. It includes a legacy filter rejection for n5 TX
OOB leakage in n28DL. The antenna isolation helps attenuate the TX leakage to
give a similar MSD result specified in Table 5.2.3.3-3 for a 30MHz DL.**

## 5.3 CA_n8-n20-n28
### 5.3.1 UE RF architecture assumption
#### 5.3.1.0 General
The UE RF architectures with 2 antenna, 3 antenna, 4 antenna can be assumed to
analyze and study for CA_n8-n20-n28.The antenna number is the total number of
antennas to support Main UL/DL and diversity DL for all bands. UE RF
architecture with three antennas for CA_n8-n20-n28 is used as baseline for
evaluation. The UE RF architectures with two or four antennas are not
precluded in the study item.
#### 5.3.1.1 UE RF architecture with three antennas
The assumption 1A for UE RF architecture with three antennas for CA_n8-n20-n28
are shown as below.
1) n28UL/n20+n28DL/n20UL triplexer on antenna 1
2) n8UL/n8DL duplexer on antenna 2
3) n20+n28DL/n8DL duplexer on antenna 3
4) 10dB antenna isolation is used for MSD calculations
The assumption 1B for UE RF architecture with three antennas for CA_n8-n20-n28
are shown as below. Comparing to assumption 1a, n8UL/n8DL duplexer on antenna
2 was replaced by n8UL/n8DL/n20UL/n20DL quadplexer.
1) n28UL/n20+n28DL/n20UL triplexer on antenna 1
2) n8UL/n8DL/n20UL/n20DL quadplexer on antenna 2
3) n20+n28DL/n8DL duplexer on antenna 3
4) 10dB antenna isolation is used for MSD calculations
The assumption 1C for UE RF architecture with three antennas for CA_n8-n20-n28
are shown as Figure 5.3.1.1-1. These are two other variants based on
assumption 1a. They may allow easier implementation of either triplexer or
duplexer in main path owing to that the frequency separations between the sub-
bands are wider than the architecture assumed for DC_8-20_n28. However, the
downside with two variants is that the widest frequency range which needs to
be covered by any of the antenna is still relatively wide at 212 MHz and 257
MHz respectively.

with 3 antenna
#### 5.3.1.2 UE RF architecture with two antennas
The assumption 2A for UE RF architecture with two antennas for CA_n8-n20-n28
are shown as below. Pentaplexer design is considered.
1) n28UL/n20+n28DL/n20UL/n8UL/n8DL pentaplexer on antenna 1
2) n20+n28DL/n8DL duplexer on antenna 2
3) 10dB antenna isolation is used for MSD calculations
The assumption 2B for UE RF architecture with two antennas for CA_n8-n20-n28
are shown as below. Quadplexer design is considered.
1) n28UL/n20+n28DL/n20UL/n8DL quadplexer on antenna 1
2) n20+n28DL/n8UL/n8DL triplexer or n20+n28DL/n20UL/n8UL/n8DL quadplexer on
antenna 2
3) 10dB antenna isolation is used for MSD calculations
There are two potential implementation challenges with 2-antenna
architectures. The first challenge is that the antenna design needs to cover
the entire spectrum range of 257 MHz simultaneously as shown in Figure 5.3.1-1
for either of the variants, which is equivalent to a 31% bandwidth ratio and
that would far exceed the bandwidth ratio for a typical planar antenna design
in a smartphone. As a result, the radiative performance for the combination is
expected to be compromised.
The second challenge is on the feasibility of a pentaplexer design for variant
(a) to aggregate five closely spaced spectrum ranges as shown in Figure
5.3.1-1, not only with sufficient filter isolation between self-band and
cross-band but also with acceptable insertion loss. The variant (b) though
avoids the use of pentaplexer, the design of the intended quadplexer is still
relatively challenging considering the closely spaced spectrum ranges with
nearly 8% bandwidth ratio for the n20/n28 combined DL range.
#### 5.3.1.3 UE RF architecture with four antennas
The assumption 3A and 3B for UE RF architecture with four antennas for
CA_n8-n20-n28 are shown as below.
{width="5.5in" height="2.2625in"}
Figure 5.3.1.3-1 The assumption 3A for UE RF architecture to support
CA_n8-n20-n28 with 4 antenna
Figure 5.3.1.3-2 The assumption 3B for UE RF architecture to support
CA_n8-n20-n28 with 4 antenna
**For the 4-antenna implementation, the three of the four antenna are used in
the main path to aggregate the n8, n20, and n28 signals over the air, as shown
in Figures 5.3.1.3-1 and 5.3.1.3-2. As n8, n20, and n28 signals do not need to
be combined through a multiplexer, there is no additional insertion loss in
n8, n20, and n28 main signal paths as compared to single-band
implementation.**
**Having 3 antenna in the main signal path not only avoids the more
complicated multiplexer implementation and the associated additional insertion
losses, but also allows narrower frequency coverage for each of the 3 antenna
as compared to single-antenna implementation. However, the additional antenna
cannot be added without occupying more phone space.**
### 5.3.2 CA_n8-n20
#### 5.3.2.0 General
According to the current spec TS 38.101-1, DL CA_n8A-n20A_BCS0 has been
specified. Thus, some of RF requirements can be reused as below. Both
DL_n8A-n20A_BCS0 and DL_n8A-n20A_UL_n8A-n20A are fallback CA band combinations
of DL_n8A-n20A-n28A_UL_n8A-n20A.

harmonics, cross band isolation and harmonics mixing exception.

It's noted that the following sentence was clarified in clause 5.5A.0 from TS
38.101-1.
_"For a higher order band combination of which CA_n20-n28 is a subset, the
frequency range in band n28 is restricted for the higher order band
combination to 703-733 MHz for the UL and 758-788 MHz for the DL."_
Thus, this frequency range restriction is also applicable to CA_n8-n20-n28.

#### 5.3.5.3 ∆TIB,c and ∆RIB,c values
For CA_n8-n20-n28, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values for 2-antenna and
3-antenna architectures are captured in this part. However, only one set of
values will be defined in the specification in the follow-up WI allowing all
possible UE RF architectures.
For CA_n8-n20-n28, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are derived from the
existing CA_n8-n28 and CA_n20-n28 based on 3-antennas UE architecture as the
baseline.

Based on the above analysis, there is no need to study MSD due to harmonics
and harmonics mixing for CA_n5-n105.
#### 5.4.3.4 ∆TIB,c and ∆RIB,c values
Two-antenna architecture with dual triplexer can be used as a baseline to
study ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~.By referring to contribution [7], it seems that
two-antenna solutions with quadplexer or triplexer are not very challenging
for CA_n5-n105 as the frequency gap between band n5 UL part and band n105 DL
part is larger than 100MHz. Thus, general values for low band combinations can
be used for Delta Tib and Rib.

By referring to contribution [8], the two antenna implementation should drive
the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values for CA_n5-n105. Based on other LB-LB cases,
and especially DC_5_n71, a Delta T of 0.5dB for both bands can be used. For
Delta Rib, CA_n5-n12 values can be reused.

Based on the above evaluation, the REFSENS degradation can be neglected. Thus,
there is no need to specify MSD due to cross band isolation for CA_n5-n105.
By referring to contribution [8], **the 1UL cross band interference is as
follows for the IMD orders of the allocated UL Resource blocks (RBs) and its
image:**
For the n105 20MHz maximum UL CBW, the IMD interference order to n5 is >9 RBs
For the n5 20MHz maximum UL CBW, the IMD interference order to n105 is >9 RBs
Given this, there is no MSD due to IMDs. Nonetheless, the transmitter noise
floor must be considered.
With the architecture aspects discussed above and the need to support multiple
LBLB cases, conservative values should be considered:
45dB cross band Tx-Rx isolation for the triplexers
40dB Tx rejection in the other DL band
10dB antenna couplingf
4dB post PA losses
Transmitter noise floor of -125dBm/Hz.
Based on these assumptions, the MSD with MRC combining is calculated in Table
5.4.3.5-3.

**1UL cross-band MSD for CA_n5-n105 is proposed in Table 5.4.3.5-4.**
Table 5.4.3.5-4: CA_n5-n105 1UL cross-band MSD

n5 | n105 | 834 | 20 | 15 | 20 (RBstart=0) | 649.5 | 5 | 1.1 | >ACLR2  
By referring to contribution [9], one aspect that needs to be pointed out is
that n105 is a recently standardised band, with very challenging frequency
arrangements from RF filtering point of view. Hence, especially given the band
is new and implementations are just under development, we don't see it
possible to optimize the CA characteristics at the expense of attenuation at
US CH36 and n105 TX/RX isolations. Please note that the numbers are not
derived from dedicated triplexers, but instead from what can be achieved by
matching DPX and RX filters together, without optimizations which may offer
improved performance over time.
The MSD with MRC combining is calculated in Table 5.4.3.5-5 and Table
5.4.3.5-6.

Figure 5.5.2.1-2 CA_n28A-n105A second architecture variant with 2-antenna
implementation
**The first architecture variant, due to the relatively wide frequency range
(a single filter covering both n28 and n 105) in the middle sub-band for the
main signal path triplexer, is considered rather challenging and impracticable
for implementation and will not be further pursued in this study item.**
**For the second architecture variant, both the main antenna and diversity
antenna design need to cover the entire spectrum range of 191 MHz
simultaneously as shown in Figure 5.5.1-1, which is equivalent to a 27%
bandwidth ratio and that would exceed the bandwidth ratio for a typical planar
antenna design in a smartphone. As a result, the radiative performance for the
combination likely would be compromised.**
#### 5.5.2.2 UE RF architectures with three antennas
**For the 3-antenna implementation, the two of the three antennas are used in
the main path to aggregate the n28 and n105 signals over the air, as shown in
Figure 5.5.2.2-1. As n28 and n105 signals do not need to be combined through a
multiplexer, there is no additional insertion loss in both n28 and n105 main
signal paths as compared to the single-band implementation.**

Figure 5.5.2.2-1 CA_n28A-n105A UE RF architecture with 3-antenna
implementation
**Having two antenna in the main signal path not only avoids the more
complicated multiplexer implementation and the associated additional insertion
losses, but also allows narrower frequency coverage for each of the two
antennas as compared to single-antenna implementation. However, the additional
antenna cannot be added without occupying more phone space. Therefore, the
feasibility on placing more than two low-band antennas in a smartphone needs
to be investigated, with narrower bandwidth and regressed radiating
performance expected due to the limitation in form factor.**
#### 5.5.2.3 2UL IMD issue
**2UL IMD3/IM5 may fall into either n105 DL or n28 DL or both DL bands
simultaneously to cause REFSENS degradation (MSD), as conceptually illustrated
in Figure 5.5.2.3-1.**
{width="6.69375in" height="1.6066108923884515in"}
Figure 5.5.2.3-1 Conceptual illustration on 2UL IMD3/IMD5 impact to DL bands
for CA_n28A-n105A
**For both 2-antenna and 3-antenna implementations, depending on the carrier
allocation and Tx filter isolation on the two UL carriers, the MSD caused by
two simultaneous up links (2UL) IMD3 to n105 DL carrier could potentially be
higher than 30 dB; especially when the n28 UL carrier is close to n105 UL band
where the n105 Tx filter does not provide any rejection to n28 UL carrier and
the n105 PA reverse IMD would dominate the MSD. For carrier allocations where
both Tx filters can provide sufficient isolation to the cross-band UL
carriers, the MSD caused by 2UL IMD3 could still be around 20 dB to either or
both of the DL carriers which would be dominated by PA forward IMD.**
**Due to the concern of the 2UL IMD issue, only single UL configuration is
considered in this study item where UL can be in either n28 or n105.**
#### 5.5.2.4 Cross-band interference
**Apart from the 2UL IMD concern, the combination may also be subject to
cross-band UL to DL interference issue due to frequency proximity even under
single UL operation where the REFSENS impact needs to be further analyzed.**
### 5.5.3 Common for 1 band UL and 2 bands UL of CA_ n28-n105
#### 5.5.3.0 General
This band combination is similar to the case of CA_n71-n85 with the two UL
bandwidths having no frequency gap between them. CA_n71-n85 is being specified
for 1UL only as 2 ULs showed significant MSD challenges.

#### 5.5.3.2 Channel bandwidths per operating band for CA
Based on WF [14], it was agreed that only 1UL configuration will be supported,
the 2UL issues will be described in section 5.5.4. Thus, BCS0 for
CA_n28A-n105A can be specified as below.

Based on the above table, there is no harmonic mixing issue for CA_n28-n105.
Since the two bands are very close, cross-band isolation may be an issue as
shown in Figure 5.5.3.3-3 below, the Table 5.5.3.3-4 provides the analysis for
the potential IMD order of the UL configuration and its image for the largest
channel bandwidths.

overlaps with the band n105 DL while the band n105 20MHz CBW UL ACLR3 overlaps
with band n28 DL. Both MSDs need to be evaluated.

#### 5.5.3.5 REFSENS evaluation
For CA_n28-n105, the 2 antennas implementation n28 and n105 MSDs related to
cross band isolation described in Table 5.5.3.3-4 must be evaluated.
Three companies provided their evaluation for both cross band MSDs.
For n28 MSD due to n105 UL, one company suggested that no MSD was needed while
the two other companies' input can be found in Table 5.5.3.5-1a and b
respectively.

### 5.5.4 Specific for 2 bands UL of fallback CA_n28-n105
#### 5.5.4.1 Maximum output power for inter-band CA
Power class 3 was assumed for UL CA_n28-n105, but as discussed in the next
clauses, it was decided that the two UL configuration will not be supported
due to significant IMD3 MSD and potential co-existence issues with DTV
channels.

From the above table, it can be found that both n28 DL and n105 DL are subject
to MSD due to dual-uplink IMD3 and IMD5 of 2UL CA_n28-n105 configuration.
Furthermore, the DTV channels below 608 MHz are also victims of the
CA_n28-n105 IMD3 and higher orders and thus the coexistence between UL
CA_n28-n105 and DTV channels may be compromised.
#### 5.5.4.3 REFSENS evaluation
Based on the above IMD analysis, the IMD3 and IMD5 MSD test points in Table
5.5.4.2-1 were discussed. Some estimations of the IMD3 MSD ranged between 25
dB and 44dB depending on the performance of the filters and antenna coupling
assumptions. Based on this large MSD and the potential coexistence issue with
(US) DTV channels, it was agreed together with the band combination proponent,
that 2UL configuration will not be supported. This agreement is captured in
way forward [14].

## 5.6 CA_n26-n28
### 5.6.1 General
In this configuration the uplink is also CA_n26A-n28A, but there are two fall
back options:
DL_n26A-n28A_UL_n28A_BCS0 (already completed)
UL_n26A-n28A_UL_n26A_BCS0
The implementation of the band n28 of CA_n26_n28 has been discussed, and the
pros and cons of the following two cases can be further traded-off, whether
and/or how to do the down-selection in the future is for further study.
Case 1: lower 30MHz of n28 (UL: 703\~733MHz, DL: 758\~788MHz) is supported.

### 5.6.2 UE RF architecture assumption
The potential UE RF architectures for CA_n26A-n28A case 1 and case 2 can be
considered as shown below. Baseline architecture for UE RF requirements
development will be further discussed. As the performance of band n26 is
similar to band n28, after the development of CA_n5-n28, some architectures
could be used as a reference to CA_n26-n28.
#### 5.6.2.1 UE RF architecture with lower 30MHz of n28 supporting
Architecture of case 1 (lower 30MHz of n28 (UL: 703\~733MHz, DL: 758\~788MHz)
is supported) is listed as below. Entire n28 presents a greater challenge to
filter implementation, so further research on feasibility and applicable
filtering techniques should be considered.

Architecture of case 2 (entire n28 frequency range (UL: 703\~748MHz, DL:
758\~803MHz) is supported) is listed as below.

**Figure 5.6.2.2-3 Architecture 6: Three-antenna solution for CA_n26-n28**
For architecture 4 with 2 antenna, there are some potential implementation
challenges:
\- The main antenna should simultaneously cover the whole band from n28UL to
n26DL with the length of 191MHz, the bandwidth ratio is as high as 23.9%, it
would far exceed the bandwidth ratio for a typical planar antenna design in a
smartphone, therefore the radiative performance for CA_n26A-n28A is expected
to be compromised.
\- The performance requirements of quadplexer such as filter isolation and
insertion loss are strict, posing challenge to the implementation and cost of
the UE front-end, and the feasibility of two quadplexers may need further
study.
For architecture 5 with 2 antenna, there are some advantages and potential
implementation challenges:
\- A two-antenna architecture with three triplexers can be easier to design
with proper delta T and delta R, so architecture 2 seems to be more feasible.
\- The difficulties of triplexer implementation still remain with two gaps of
10MHz, n26 BW of 35MHz and n28DL of 45MHz.
For architecture 6 with 3 antenna, there are some advantages and potential
implementation challenges:
\- For the 3-antenna architecture, there are two antennas on the main signal
path, which eases the difficulty of multiplexer design and implement. The
frequency range for each main antenna is narrower compared with 2-antenna
architecture, and the antenna BW ratios of the two antennas would be close to
the current devices.
\- 3 LB antennas present a greater challenge to the dimension of the mobile
phone than 2-amtenna architecture.

A note may be needed if case 1 is considered for CA_n26-n28, e.g. band n28 is
restricted at lower 30MHz (UL: 703\~733MHz, DL: 758\~788MHz).
In addition, referring to the contribution [10], the following options about
different frequency range restrictions are listed to trade-off the pros and
cons. From a high level perspective, based on the proponent operator's
feedback, one possibility is that RAN4 move forward with option 4 (i.e. both
options 1 and 3 being captured in the specification) which would allow maximum
implementation flexibility.
Option 1 Keep current CA_n26A-n28A with entire n28 frequency range and specify
n26 UL and UL CA support for entire frequency range
Option 2 Modify current CA_n26A-n28A to include only lower 30MHz of n28 and
specify n26 UL and UL CA support for lower 30MHz frequency range
Option 3 Keep current CA_n26A-n28A with entire n28 frequency range and specify
n26 UL and UL CA support for lower 30MHz frequency range
Option 4 Combination of options 1 and 3
#### 5.6.3.2 Channel bandwidths per operating band for CA
Referring to table 5.5A.3.1-1h of TS 38.101-1, DL_n26A-n28A_BCS0 and BCS1 has
been specified
#### 5.6.3.3 Identify the potential MSD issues due to harmonic/harmonic
mixing/cross band isolation
There is no need to specify harmonics and harmonics mixing exception for
CA_n26-n28 as we didn't specify them in current spec.
For cross band isolation issue:
Case 1: The 2^nd^ adjacent channel leakage from band n26 may fall into band DL
frequency range (774\~788) when 20MHz UL CBW is assumed for band n26.
Case 2: the 1^st^ adjacent channel leakage from band n26 may fall into n28 DL
frequency range (796\~803) when 20MHz UL CBW is assumed for band n26.
#### 5.6.3.4 ∆TIB,c and ∆RIB,c values
Option 1 is proposed based on the agreed ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values for
CA_n5-n28 in WF [11] which can be reused for CA_n26-n28.
Option 2 is proposed in the contribution [10].

1) Referring to the contribution [12], the following band n28A MSD
evaluations, assuming 35dB and 45dB Tx filter rejection of band n26.

2) Referring to the contribution [13], the following analysis were provided.
To evaluate the potential 1UL and 2UL for CA_n26-n28 with band n28 full (n28F)
or the lower 30MHz (n28A), it is useful to compare existing cases for
CA_n5-n28F and CA_n18-n28F and CA_n18-n28A. This can be done by observing the
IMD landscape provided in Figure 5.6.3.5-1, and the related wanted UL RB
allocation and its image IMDs overlaps for 5MHz and 30MHz n28DL for n28F or
n28A scenarios that are collected in Table 5.6.3.5-4.
In addition, 1UL cross band MSD for n28F and n28A were proposed in 1UL cross
band MSD for n28F and n28A.

3) Referring to the contribution [10], the technical analysis for two cases
(case 1: n28 Cross-band MSD for lower 30MHz of n28 / case 2: n28 Cross-band
MSD for entire n28) are shown below.
Table 5.6.3.5-6: Cross-band MSD for lower 30MHz of n28

{width="2.6268186789151358in" height="3.291732283464567in"}
It's observed that MSD is about 15-20dB higher if the entire n28 must be
supported, compared to case when only lower 30MHz of n28 is supported.

4) Referring to the contribution [17], the following analysis were provided.
The combo is a L-L band combination with small gap between uplink range of n26
and downlink range of n28. The maximum uplink bandwidth of n26 is up to 20MHz
that its ACP1 would fall into DL range of n28 directly if uplink is allocated
full RB. Below table lists our assumption for MSD characterization. Here we
consider three-antenna implementation since the frequency gap between n26
uplink and n28 downlink is only 11MHz that we don't think a low band diplexer
is feasible with existing technology. Based on previous RAN4 agreement, there
shall not be frequency range constraint on n28 thus MSD shall be characterized
with full frequency range.

5) Referring to the contribution [18], new evaluation based on measurements
were provided compared to [13] which was based on extrapolated from similar
combination:
\- 20MHz band n26 output noise in n28A (first 30MHz of band n28) and n28B
(last 30MHz of band n28) for:
\- 5, 20, 25 and 30MHz band n28 CBW
\- At 23dBm for 1UL and 20dBm for 2UL
\- Band n28 self-desense for 5, 20, 25 and 30MHz band n28 CBW at 23dBm for 1UL
and 20dBm for 2UL.
Based on the chosen architecture, the following RF front-end performance is
assumed:
\- Post PA and pre LNA losses = 4dB
\- Antenna isolation 10dB
\- Band n26 UL filter from n26UL/n26DL/n28DL triplexer performance:
\- n26 UL to n28A DL T/R isolation = 38dB
\- n26UL to n28A DL antenna rejection = 35dB
\- n26 UL to n28A DL T/R isolation = 35dB (11MHz distance)
\- n26UL to n28A DL antenna rejection = 32dB (11MHz distance)
\- These performances are justified by the fact that band n26 is one of the
most critical low band duplexers (35MHz BW with 10MHz duplex gap)
\- Band n28 UL filter from n28AorBUL/n26DL/n28AorBDL triplexer performance
\- n28 UL to n26 DL T/R isolation = 40dB
\- n28 UL to n26 DL antenna rejection = 38dB
These performances are justified for a full band n28 design and the proximity
of band n26.
For CA_n26-n28, the 1UL scenario is using the largest n28 and n26 UL CBW
(respectively 30MHz and 20MHz) closest to the victim band with a 5MHz Rx CBW.
Still, in previous meetings, there was discussion regarding whether the 30MHz
lower band n28 or the full band n28 should be considered, for this we
evaluated n28A and n28B (representative of full band) cases:
\- n28B (upper 30MHz) is victim of IMD3 of band n26 UL wanted RBs and their
image including its peak
\- n28A (lower 30MHz) is victim of IMD5 of band n26 UL wanted RBs and their
image including its peak
\- n26 is victim of n28B IMD9 and n28A IMD11, at these high IMD offsets, the
noise is dominated by the wideband transmitter white noise floor.
We performed measurements for both sub-band n28A and n28B cases and the MSD
after MRC results are summarized in Table 3.

noise.

**Observations:**
\- With only the transmitter noise floor contributing, the band n26 MSD due to
band n28 is small
\- The MSD of band n28B victim of band n26 UL IMD3 is confirmed to be
significantly above 30dB
\- The MSD of band n28A victim of band n26 UL IMD5 is slightly lower than
estimated in [2].
These observations lead to the following 1UL cross band isolation MSD
proposals, which provides MSD for full band and lower 30MHz of band n28 as
spectrum availability varies in different regions.

provided:
During the study phase for the CA_n26-n28 band combination, there was no
agreement on whether to consider only the lower 30MHz section of n28 or the
entire band, as captured in the following WF:
\- Case 1: lower 30MHz of n28 (UL: 703\~733MHz, DL: 758\~788MHz) is supported.
\- Case 2: entire n28 frequency range (UL: 703\~748MHz, DL: 758\~803MHz) is
supported.
As a consequence of this, we will do the MSD analysis and access the ∆TIB,c
and ∆RIB,c for both cases. The corresponding aggregated spectrums are shown in
Figures 2.3-1 and 2.3-2 below:

**CA_n26-n28 MSD Analysis**
As can be seen from the MSD contributor table below, for n28 UL n26 DL, there
is more than 110MHz of spectrum gap. Therefore, the cross-band interference
for that case will be minimum and so the MSD for n26 DL will be small.
However, for the n26 UL n28 DL, there is only 11MHz of separation when the n28
full 45MHz band is considered and 26MMHz when the lower 30MHz of n28 (n28A) is
assumed. Due to that small frequency separation, there is a strong cross-band
interference that will affect the n28 DL. Next, we will examine the n28 DL MSD
for both cases.

For the n28 DL MSD analysis, we will use the following worst-case assumptions
for the RF front-end performance parameters:
\- n26 Tx filter rejection at n28 RX (758MHz-803MHz): 30dB
\- Cross-band TX to RX isolation: 40dB
\- ACLR2 sideband level: 30dBc
\- ACLR3 sideband level: 30dBc
\- Front-end insertion loss: 4.5dB
\- Antenna coupling: 10dB
\- RxBW: 4.5MHz
\- Output Power at antenna: 23dBm
Given the assumptions above, the MSD analysis is summarized in the table
below.

New evaluation based on measurement in [16] is also provided as below:
Since CA_n26-n28 UL configuration is also considered and, similar to the work
performed for CA_n5-n28, the MSD due to the addition of the band n28 UL and
band n26 UL noises must be evaluated. For this, we measured the noise levels
at 20dBm for the band n26UL for 20/25/30MHz CBW of band n28 and again looking
at the lower or upper 30MHz.
This time we had to measure the transmitter noise, evaluate the corresponding
noise leaking to the receiver for each UL accounting for the front-end
performance and assuming 3dB lower noise floor at 20dBm than 23dBm.
This resulted in the interference levels at the receiver in:
\- Table 5.6.4.3-2 for 20dBm band n26 UL in band n28A which correspond to an
IMD5 case (ACLR2)
\- Table 5.6.4.3-3 for 20dBm band n26 UL in band n28B which correspond to an
IMD3 case (ACLR1)
\- Table 5.6.4.3-4 for the 20dBm band n28 UL self desense. It corresponds to
an IMD5 case for 20 and 25MHz CBW and IMD3 case for 30MHz CBW.

From the above, we can derive the MSD post MRC accounting for the addition of
n26 and n28 UL noises, but also considering that the main and diversity
antennas are swapped between the two bands in the proposed architecture. The
calculations are provided for the three band n28 victim bandwidths in Table
5.6.4.3-5 for n28A and Table 5.6.4.3-6 for n28B.

**Observations:**
\- Even in the n28A case, the 2UL noise is above the band n28 REFSENS levels
that already suffers from IMD3 or IMD5 self-desense.
\- In many n28A cases the band n26 UL noise dominates
\- In the n28B case the band n26 noise dominates compared to band n28 self
desense and although significantly lower than the n26 1UL case, it still
results in significant MSD
\- Given that it shows the contribution from both UL the 30MHz CBW for band
n28 is preferred.
With the above, the following 2UL MSD is proposed considering both full band
n28 and upper 30MHz cases as spectrum availability varies in different
regions.

## 5.7 CA_n5-n28-n105
### 5.7.1 UE RF architecture assumption
#### 5.7.1.1 General
The UE RF architectures with 2 antenna, 3 antenna, 4 antenna can be assumed to
analyze and study for CA_n5-n28-n105.The antenna number is the total number of
antennas to support Main UL/DL and diversity DL for all bands. UE RF
architecture with three antennas for CA_n5-n28-n105 is used as baseline for
evaluation. The UE RF architectures with two or four antennas are not
precluded in the study item. In addition, simultaneous 2-band transmission for
UL CA_n28-n105 has been precluded in this combination which can be leveraged
to potentially simplify the RF front-end architecture.
#### 5.7.1.2 UE RF architecture with two antennas
For UE RF architecture with two antennas, three types (a) (b) and (c) are
provided below for CA_n5-n28-n105.

The antenna relative bandwidth ratio for two-antenna RF architecture (a), (b)
and (c) is shown below.

Antenna The covered frequency range Relative bandwidth ratio
* * *
Main TRx antenna 612\~894MHz 37% Diverstiy TRx antenna 612\~894MHz 37%
For two-antenna UE RF architecture, although only two low band antennas are
kept due to the compact size of smartphone, UE has to face the difficulties of
wide bandwidth low-band antenna and complex multiplexer. Specifically,
1) For CA_n5A-n28A-n105A with 2-antenna implementation, the pentaplexer and
hexaplexer with 5 and 6 closely spaced frequency ranges could be relatively
challenging for filter implementation with acceptable insertion loss and
isolation.
2) For CA_n5A-n28A-n105A with 2-antenna implementation, both main and
diversity antennas need to cover the entire spectrum range of 282 MHz
simultaneously, which is equivalent to a 37.5% bandwidth ratio and that would
far exceed the bandwidth ratio for a typical planar antenna design in a
smartphone. As a result, the radiative performance for the combination likely
would be highly compromised.
In addition, the other difficulties can be observed, e.g.
\- Uses the lower the entire band n28
\- Need the two most critical low bands n28 and n105 in terms on BW and duplex
gap
\- No gap between n105 and n28
\- No option for co-banding
\- n5 very close to n28 (even more if implemented with a band 26 filter)
#### 5.7.1.3 UE RF architecture with three antennas
For three-antenna RF architecture, three types (a) (b) and (c) are provided
below for CA_n5-n28-n105.

Figure 5.7.1.3-1 three-antenna RF architecture (a) for CA_n5-n28-n105
For a three-antenna RF architecture in Figure 5.7.1.3-1, the UE has also to
implement a quadplexer (n5UL/n5DL/n105DL/n105UL). In addition, wide bandwidth
antenna is another challenge for this type of UE RF architecture to cover
frequency range from 612MHz to 894MHz. The antenna relative bandwidth ratio
for three-antenna RF architecture (a) is shown Table 5.7.1.3-1.

Figure 5.7.1.3-3 three-antenna RF architecture (c) for CA_n5-n28-n105
For three-antenna RF architecture Fig 5.7.1.3-3, only single UL is supported
for CA_n5-n28-n105. Two Rx filter groups are considered and the antenna
efficiency can be compromised for pure Rx wide bandwidth antenna. This kind of
implementation can be achieved more easily to reuse the existing components as
soon as possible. The antenna relative bandwidth ratio for three-antenna RF
architecture (c) is shown in table 5.7.1.3-3.

The three-antenna RF architecture (e) is shown in Figure 5.7.1.3-5. The
antenna relative bandwidth ratio for three-antenna RF architecture (e) is
shown in 5.7.1.3-5. On concept level, this is basically building on top of
CA_n28-n105, by adding one new antenna (n5 Duplexer) and n5 DRX into n28-n105
DX antenna.

For three-antenna UE RF architecture, one more low-band antenna can help ease
the design of wide bandwidth antenna and avoid to implement the most
complicated multiplexer comparing to two-antenna UE RF architecture. For
CA_n5A-n28A-n105A with 3-antenna implementation under architecture variant
(b), the main TRx front-end design is eased by leveraging the non-concurrent
UL transmission configuration between n28 and n105.
#### 5.7.1.4 UE RF architecture with four antennas
UE RF architecture with four antennas for CA_n5-n28-n105 is shown below.

architecture

active) 13% Diverstiy TRx antenna 612\~894MHz 37%
For four-antenna UE RF architecture, even if UE can avoid implementing wide
bandwidth low-band antenna and complex multiplexer, UE pays the price of space
and antenna performance. Four-antenna RF architecture will not be used to
specify the requirement for this band combination.

### 5.7.4 ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values
For CA_n5-n28-n105, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are derived from the
existing CA_n5-n28 and CA_n28-n105. The following ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values
for CA_n5-n28-n105 can be further considered referring to the contribution
[15].

Referring to the contribution [16], the following ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values
in table 5.7.4-2 were proposed after considering the factors:
\- Co-banding of n5 with n26
\- The critical design of the band n105, n28 and n26 duplexers to be further
multiplexed in a LBLBLB configuration
\- A two-antenna architecture in the future
\- Potential split approach for band n28
\- Existing Delta T and Delta R from 2 band fallbacks

There is no IMD interference which fall into Rx frequencies of third DL band
n28 when CA_n5-n105 is the UL configuration.
3^rd^ order IMD may also fall into Rx frequencies of third DL band n105 when
CA_n5-n28 is the UL configuration.
### 5.7.6 REFSENS evaluation
For MSD due to cross band isolation, cross-band analysis done for 2-band cases
are sufficient, and no new cross-band analysis are needed for 3-band case
For MSD due to IMD interference on 3^rd^ band, the following inputs were
provided.
1) The MSD test configurations were evaluated as below for band n105 MSD due
to IMD3 of Tx band n5 + band n28 referring to contribution [15].

Generally, there are some network deployment methods to avoid the IMD product
hitting the DL carrier directly. For example, if the UL carrier in band n28 is
configured in 703\~718MHz, no matter which UL frequency carrier in band n5 is
configured, the IMD3 products will not hit the DL carrier in band n105
directly.
2) In addition, another contribution [16] proposed to derive the MSD due to
IMD3 from CA_n8-n20-n28 with additional scaling factor. The scaling factor
mainly consider the following reasons:
\- n28 UL distance to n105 is smaller than n20 to n8
\- n28 UL filter is more critical than band n20 and the lower side is more
critical resulting in lower cross-band isolation
\- The lower IMD3 is often higher since the PA has higher gain at lower
frequencies.
It's suggested to increase the MSD level by (6) dBs: 2dB for higher level
lower IMD3 vs upper and 4dB for lower isolation compared with the MSD of
CA_n8-n20-n28 as below.
