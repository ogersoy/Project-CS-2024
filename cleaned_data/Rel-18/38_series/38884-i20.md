# 1 Scope
**The objectives of this study are to enhance the FR2 RF testing methodology
and to quantify the impact of the enhancements on the UE performance, as
related to the polarization basis mismatch between the test equipment and UE
and to add support for testing under extreme temperature conditions.**
**The development of testing methodology enhancements proceeds within the
following scope:**
\- In general
\- Target the testing and calibration aspects of the permitted methods for FR2
UE RF testing and the preliminary assessment of measurement uncertainty
(Clause 5.2 and Annex B of TR38.810)
\- The test methodologies and procedures shall be applicable for different
device types and power classes with DUT size defined in the TR 38.810.
Prioritize the study to **PC3 for aspects related to DUT size,** and limit the
study to free space conditions

\- Objectives related to regulatory test cases shall be prioritized
The detailed objectives are:
1\. Define test methodology for high DL power and low UL power test cases

considering downlink polarization sweep enhancement
\- Limit the study of this objective to the permitted UE RF methods defined in
Clause 5.2 of TR38.810

additional degree of freedom for polarization alignment of the measurement
antenna)
\- The use of circular polarization to perform measurements
\- Coherent combining and demodulation of orthogonally polarized received
signals in the test equipment
\- Uplink polarization sweeping by the test equipment to search for the
optimal polarization angle to receive and demodulate the signal transmitted by
the UE

# 4 General
The enhanced test methods defined in the following clauses are not only
applicable to current release, the general applicability can be categorized as
following:
1\. If a test case or requirement was not-testable in an older Release (e.g.
Rel-15), and a new test method or procedure unblocks it in Rel-17, then the
method can be said to be release-independent and would apply to the older
release.
2\. If we call one of the enhanced test methodologies as a Rel-17 test
equipment feature, then a test equipment setup implementing the earlier
release conformance test specification should be allowed to bring in a Rel-17
feature, provided that it meets all of the applicable Rel-17 requirements for
that feature.
3\. When there is a core requirement change (or modification/relaxation) in,
e.g. Rel-17, to enable testing/unblock testability issues, then the
requirement change should be applicable only from Rel-17 onwards.
4\. When the enhanced test methodology applies to a UE feature supported only
from a specific release, the test method becomes applicable only from that
release onwards.
# 5 UE RF testing methodology enhancements
## 5.1 High DL power and low UL power
### 5.1.1 General
The investigation of high DL power and low UL power enhancements to the FR2
test methodology includes the following aspects: scope of test cases with high
DL power and low UL power issues, enhanced test systems, including the
investigation of non-permitted systems, enhancements to permitted methods,
manufacturer declarations, beam management sensitivity of the DUT in near-
field test system environments, and path loss comparison across system types.
Table 5.1.1-1 below provides a summary of the test cases and testability
issues.
Table 5.1.1-1: Summary of test cases and testability issues
Clause Requirement Testability issue Test Metric
* * *
6.3.1 Minimum output power Low UL power EIRP (Link=TX beam peak direction,
Meas=Link angle). 6.3.2 Transmit OFF power Low UL power TRP (Link=TX beam peak
direction, Meas=TRP grid) 6.5.1 Occupied bandwidth Low UL power OBW (Link=TX
beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle) 6.5.2.3 Adjacent channel leakage ratio
Low UL power TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid). 6.5.3.2
Additional spurious emissions Low UL power TRP (Link=TX beam peak direction,
Meas=TRP grid). 7.4 Maximum input power High DL power EIS (Link=RX beam peak
direction, Meas=Link angle). 7.5 Adjacent channel selectivity (case 1) High DL
power EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link angle) 7.5 Adjacent channel
selectivity (case 2) High DL power EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction, Meas=Link
angle) 7.6.2 In-band blocking High DL power EIS (Link=RX beam peak direction,
Meas=Link angle) 7.9 Receiver spurious emissions Low UL power TRP (Link=TX
beam peak direction, Meas=TRP grid).
The investigation of test methodology enhancements to strive to reduce the
testability issues which were identified includes study of the feasibility of
enhancing test systems which are permitted in TR38.810 [3] as well as test
systems which are not permitted. Non-permitted test systems according to
TR38.810 [3] are not required to verify all requirements in TS38.101-2 [2].
The candidate test systems are limited to near-field (NF) based solutions and
include the following solutions:
\- The Direct near-field (DNF) system assumes that all measurements and call
setups are performed with a measurement probe in the NF of the DUT.
\- The Combined far-field/near-field (CFFNF) system utilizing a transform-
based approach assumes that the UE beamlock function (UBF) activation is
performed towards the FF beam peak direction based on the far-field method and
then test case procedures are performed with measurement probe(s) in the NF of
the DUT.
\- Combined far-field/direct-near-field (CFFDNF) system assumes that the UE
beamlock function (UBF) activation is performed towards the FF beam peak
direction based on the far-field method and then test case procedures are
performed based on the direct near-field method.
\- Combined far-field/delta-near-field (CFFdeltaNF) system utilizing a
relative measurement approach assumes that the UE beamlock function (UBF)
activation is performed towards the FF beam peak direction based on the far-
field method, a reference test case without testability issues is performed
both in FF and NF to obtain the relative correction factor, and the final test
case procedure are performed in the NF and compensated with the relative
correction factor.
The applicability of these NF methodologies is further outlined in Clause
5.1.4.
### 5.1.2 Beam management sensitivity study of NF based solutions
#### 5.1.2.1 Simulation assumptions
For NF based solutions, where beam peak search is necessary to perform all
applicable test case procedures, an evaluation of UE beam management
sensitivity to magnitude/phase variation of the DL signal is needed. Two
assumptions are made about the NF based system:
\- Beam peak search is performed in the NF (i.e. DNF system); OR
\- Beam peak search is first performed in the FF/IFF and test case is executed
in the NF (i.e. CFFNF system).
Using the spherical coverage measurement grid assumptions shown in Table
5.1.2.1-1, evaluations were performed of the UE beam management sensitivity in
terms of simulated radiated performance metrics for each of the assumptions.

### 5.1.3 Manufacturer declarations
If a manufacturer declaration is used to inform or optimize a test system
parameter, and the DUT is positioned in the test system according to
parameters which are informed by this declaration, then the DUT is measured
assuming a "white box" configuration. If no manufacturer declaration is used,
and the DUT is positioned in the test system according to common procedures,
then the DUT is measured assuming a "black box" configuration.
Black box testing requires no knowledge which antenna panel is active at any
given time and the detailed location of the active panel within the DUT. In
this test configuration, the geometric centre of the DUT is aligned with the
centre of the quiet zone as illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-1.

height="2.719899387576553in"}
Figure 5.1.3-1: Illustration of black box approach
White box testing on the other hand requires the manufacturer declaration of
detailed locations of all antenna panels and which antenna panel is active in
any UL/DL test direction In this test configuration, the centre of the
radiating aperture (of the active panel) is aligned with the centre of the
quiet zone as illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-2.

height="2.72in"}
Figure 5.1.3-2: Illustration of white box approach
The black&white-box approach combines the advantages of both the black and
white-box approaches where the antenna phase centre offset(s) are declared,
i.e., white-box approach, but the geometric centre of the DUT is aligned with
the centre of the QZ, i.e., black-box approach.
The following paragraphs provide further information on the need for the
various vendor declarations with the help of sample illustrations. Here, a DUT
with three antenna panels is considered shown schematically in Figure 5.1.3-3
on the left. The right side shows coverage sectors and the corresponding
antenna panels the DUT would select if the DL was presented from within those
sectors. In this example, the red antenna panel would yield the TX beam peak
in the horizontal direction; this direction would be identified following the
TX beam peak search. For simplicity, most of the arguments in the next few
paragraphs are applied to testing in the FF but they can be applied to testing
in the NF as well.
{width="6.0in" height="2.146454505686789in"}
Figure 5.1.3-3: Illustration of Sample DUT with three antenna panels
The beam peak search or spherical coverage test case of the DUT utilizing the
black-box approach, i.e., none of the antenna offsets are known/declared, is
illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-4. Here, the geometric centre of the DUT is
aligned with the centre of the QZ (yellow circle). The (green) beam peak
search grid points sample the EIRP around the DUT.

Figure 5.1.3-4: Illustration of beam peak search of sample DUT utilizing
black-box approach.
Test cases without a 3D scan, e.g., EIRP/EIS test case towards the known TX/RX
beam peak direction, utilizing the black-box approach are illustrated in
Figure 5.1.3-5. Here, the geometric centre of the DUT is aligned with the
centre of the QZ (yellow circle) and the TX beam peak direction is known from
a previous beam peak search measurement, e.g., from an IFF system. Hence, the
single (green) FF grid point is aligned with the FF TX beam peak direction.

Figure 5.1.3-5: Illustration low UL power test case along TX BP direction of
sample DUT utilizing black-box approach.
For the white-box measurement approach, the level of information provided in
vendor declarations largely depends on the purpose of test case coverage. If
the white-box approach is leveraged for all conformance test cases including
the beam peak searches, the total number of panels and the phase centre
offsets of each panel need to be declared. Additionally, vendors would have to
declare which antenna panel is active for each grid point or test sectors so
that the respective antenna panel is aligned with the centre of the QZ during
testing. This approach is further illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-6. To sample
EIRPs on all beam peak search grid points, three different device positions
have to be applied, i.e., for the angular range covering the
\- red grid points (declared by OEM), the red antenna panel (location declared
by OEM) has to be aligned with the centre of QZ (yellow circle)
\- purple grid points (declared by OEM), the purple antenna panel (location
declared by OEM) has to be aligned with the centre of QZ (yellow circle)
\- blue grid points (declared by OEM), the blue antenna panel (location
declared by OEM) has to be aligned with the centre of QZ (yellow circle)

white-box approach.
In summary, the information that would have to be declared by the OEMs if the
white-box approach is utilized for all conformance test cases is tabulated in
Table 5.1.3-1.

Assuming the enhanced test methodology needs to perform beam peak searches and
a white box approach was selected, the DUT should be measured in several
positions inside the test volume, where two options could be considered:
a. DUT is placed manually in the corresponding off-center positions. This will
likely result in significant test time increase and additional MU due to
inaccuracies in the alignment of the DUT.
b. x-y-z positioning systems are needed to fully automate testing based on the
knowledge of which antenna panel is active in any given UL/DL test direction,
as outlined in Figure 5.1.3-6. This will in effect likely result in
significant signal ripple and near field coupling effects which is expected to
degrade the quality of QZ MU which could offset the offset MU a white box
approach eliminates. Such positioning system will furthermore increase test
system complexity from a SW and HW perspective as well as test time.
Test cases without a 3D scan, e.g., EIRP/EIS test case towards the known TX/RX
beam peak direction, utilizing the white-box approach is illustrated in Figure
5.1.3-7. Here, the phase centre of the red panel (yielding beam peak
radiation) of the DUT is aligned with the centre of the QZ (yellow circle) and
the TX beam peak direction is known from a previous beam peak search
measurement; thus the single (green) grid point is aligned with the FF TX beam
peak direction. In this case, only the location of the one antenna panel that
yields the beam peak radiation would have to be declared. A sample declaration
is shown in Table 5.1.3-2.

Two different black&white-box approaches could be further considered, i.e.,
\- Extensive Black&white-box approach: When the NF methodology is used for
spherical coverage test cases and for beam peak searches, all active antenna
locations are declared together with the angular ranges (theta, phi) each
active antenna performs best (when compared to the remaining antenna panels,
i.e., the vendor declaration is as outlined in Table 5.1.3-1. Very much
similar to the white-box approach with the only difference that the geometric
centre of DUT is aligned with the centre of QZ.
\- Black&white box: When the NF methodology is used only for EIS based high DL
power or EIRP/TRP based low UL power test cases, only the antenna location of
the antenna that yields the beam peak needs to be declared, i.e., the vendor
declaration is as outlined in Table 5.1.3-2. The geometric centre of DUT is
aligned with the centre of QZ.
For test cases focused only on the for EIS based high DL power or EIRP/TRP
based low UL power test cases, the key differences are illustrated in Figure
5.1.3-8 for the black-box approach (left), black&white-box approach (centre),
and the white-box approach (right). While the black-box approach requires
local searches to determine the NF test direction, the need for local searches
for the black&white-box approach is FFS. No local search is necessary for the
white-box approach.
For the spherical coverage test cases or the beam peak searches, the extensive
black&white-box approach is further outlined in Figure 5.1.3-9. On the other
hand, the black-box approach is outlined in Figure 5.1.3-4 while the white-box
approach is outlined in Figure 5.1.3-6.

DUT utilizing extensive black&white-box approach
For white box testing, the minimum radius of the NF probe antenna from the
centre of the quiet zone generally must exceed the maximum diameter of the
device, as illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-10, to prevent interference of the near
field scanning probe with the DUT. While this requirement of the NF range
length having to exceed the maximum diameter of the DUT is generally
applicable to TRP where the NF Probe antenna needs to perform a full 3D scan
around the DUT, this could very well be applicable to single-directional
measurements as well, as illustrated in Figure 5.1.3-10 using a PC1 CPE as an
example. Similar restrictions apply when testing using ETC enclosures
surrounding the DUT.

Based on the analysis shown in Table 5.1.3-4, it can be concluded that a
"white box" is not deemed a feasible enhancement of the methodology.
Additionally, since the beam peak searches and the spherical coverage test
cases are not part of the low UL/high DL power test cases and given the
complexity of the vendor declaration of the extensive black&white-box
approach, it can be concluded that the extensive black&white-box approach is
not deemed a feasible enhancement of the methodology.
### 5.1.4 Permitted Methodologies: CFFNF, CFFDNF and CFFdeltaNF
Both methodologies have in common that a FF probe, e.g., reflector & feed
probe from the IFF methodology, is used for the test cases that are not
considered low UL power/high DL power. This FF probe is used for the low
UL/high DL power test cases to steer and lock the beam in the known FF
direction before the NF measurements are performed with a NF probe that
exhibits much lower free-space path losses. An example test setup of such a
hybrid system is shown in Figure 5.1.4-1.
The main differences between the three measurement approaches are outlined in
Table 5.1.4-1.

Figure 5.1.4-1: Hybrid NF/(I)FF test setup suitable for NF measurements
In a NF system, the NF beam peak direction for an offset antenna is not
necessarily the same as the FF beam peak direction; however, the knowledge of
the antenna phase centre offset, i.e., black&white-box approach, can be
leveraged to measure at the NF beam peak direction as illustrated in 5.1.4-2.
The knowledge of the offset together with the probe antenna pattern will allow
the calculation of the optimized DUT orientation to optimize the NF
measurement. The beam peak direction in the NF can either be calculated or
determined via a local search.

Figure 5.1.4-2: Illustration of NF testing utilizing the black&white-box
approach.
To guarantee that the correct beam is measured for when the black&white-box
measurement approach is applied, the CFF(D)NF approach utilizes a FF probe
that allows the UE to select the proper beam in the known beam peak direction.
A beam lock activation via the UBF makes sure that the UE no longer changes
its antenna pattern when the NF measurement probe is used to perform the
measurements with significantly reduced free-space path losses compared to
existing IFF systems.
The CFFDNF approach and test steps for EIRP/EIS/TRP follow those for IFF/DFF
outlined in Annex K [6] with the exception that the minimum range length is
reduced. The minimum number of TRP grid points, required grid point spacing,
and the effect of compensation of the declared/known offset is further
outlined in this this clause.
#### 5.1.4.1 Asymptotic Expansion Approach for CFFNF
The asymptotic expansion approach for CFFNF that is using measurements
\- at three different radii including local searches around the FF beam peak
direction (black-box approach) or
\- at two different radii without local searches as the NF beam peak direction
can be calculated (black&white-box approach)
is primarily meant to estimate the FF EIRP/EIS at the beam peak with NF
EIRP/EIS measurements performed in the radiative NF instead of the reactive
NF. This expansion approach is not suitable to determine the FF pattern given
the required overhead with the measurements at multiple radii.
The asymptotic expansion approach is based on the superposition approach
$$\text{Signal}\left( \theta,\phi \right) \propto \sum_{k = 1}^{N_{y} \cdot

The estimate of the FF EIRP based on NF measurements, p(d), can be expressed
as follows
$$\text{EIRP}\left( d_{f} \right) = p\left( d_{1} \right) +
\,\int_{d_{1}}^{d_{f}}{\frac{\partial p}{\partial d}\ d\mathrm{\Delta}d}$$
with
$$p \propto \left| \text{Signal} \cdot d \right|^{2}$$
where EIRP(_d~f~_) is the estimated EIRP in the far-field and _d~f~_ is the
distance between the phase centre of the antenna array and the far-field beam
peak at range length _r_ (in the FF: _r_ \~ _d~f~_) while _p_(_d_ ~1~) is the
measured power with the probe antenna at a near-field distance _d_ ~1~
(measured from the phase centre of the antenna array to probe antenna), ∂ _p_
/∂ _d_ is the derivative of power _p_ to distance _d_. Because the near-field
distance _d_ ~1~ is unknown for the black box approach, measurements of the
EIRP at multiple measurement distances are needed to determine the parameters
of the ∂ _p_ /∂ _d_ derivative and the first near-field distance _d~1~_.
Following the implementation of the CFFNF simulations and an in-depth analysis
of the derivative of the superposition expression above, the approximation of
normalized power to distance ∂ _p_ /∂ _d_ was determined to be
$$\frac{\partial p}{\partial d} = b_{1}d^{- 3}$$
which yields dependency of normalized power to _d_ of
$$p\left( d \right) = - \frac{b_{1}}{2}d^{- 2} + b_{2}$$
This approximation in turn corresponds to a power (field) dependence in the NF
of 1/_r_ ^4^ (1/_r_ ^2^) which is commonly observed in the radiative NF. CST
simulations were used to further support this formulation. Here, an 8x2
antenna array, placed at (0,0,0), was evaluated. Two measurements at _r_ ~1~
and _r_ ~2~ were used to estimate the asymptotic expansion coefficients _b~i~_
; this allowed to estimate the power/EIRP at various distances which was can
be compared with actual CST simulations at those distances. The
$\frac{\partial p}{\partial d} = b_{1}d^{- 3}\,$behaviour and the normalized
power (compensating the path loss) estimated from two sets of two measurements
at (_r_ ~1~, _r_ ~2~) of (7.5cm, 9.5cm) and (20cm, 22cm) simulated at various
distances (>_r_ ~2~) are shown in Figure 5.1.4.1-1.

a function of transformed distance. The NF evaluations were performed at

=21cm, _r~3~_ =22cm (bottom)
These curves show that the $\frac{\partial p}{\partial d} = b_{1}d^{- 3}\,;\,
p = - \frac{b_{1}}{2}d^{- 2} + b_{2}$ asymptotic expansion formulation yields
good estimates of EIRP/EIS based on measurements in the radiative NF.
#### 5.1.4.2 Test Procedures for CFFDNF, CFFNF and CFFdeltaNF
The appropriate test steps required for NF testing based on the CFFDNF
approach of DUTs with known phase-centre offsets (black&white-box) are
illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.2-1.
{width="4.0in" height="5.025in"}
Figure 5.1.4.2-1: Test Steps for CFFDNF testing of DUTs with known antenna
phase centre offset (black&white-box approach).
For the CFFNF methodology that supports both the black-box and the
black&white-box approach, the initial test steps are the same as steps 1-3 in
Figure 5.1.4.2-1. The test steps for the NF measurement portion of the black-
box approach are further outlined in Figure 5.1.4.2-2 while the NF test steps
for the black&white-box approach are outlined in Figure 5.1.4.2-3. The
diagrams on the right of Figure 5.1.4.2-2 illustrate the different local
searches required for the measurements at each of the three radii. The
measurements at the very first radius _r_ ~1~ require a wide sector of grid
points around the known FF beam peak direction big enough so that the local/NF
beam peak is captured properly. For the initial local search at _r_ ~1~=20cm,
the width of the sector is about ±40^o^ which can be covered using coarse and
fine scans to further reduce the number of points. On the other hand, the
sector of grid points for measurements at radius _r_ ~2~ and _r_ ~3~ can be
significantly smaller as only a small region around the local NF beam peak
found at _r_ ~1~ is needed.

the right of Figure 5.1.4.2-4 illustrate the local search required for the

which can be covered using coarse and fine scans to further reduce the number
of points.

#### 5.1.4.4 Simulation results for CFFDNF
The main intention of this clause is to estimate the measurement uncertainties
of EIRP measurements performed in the NF at various range lengths. Since the
beam peak search and spherical coverage analyses are performed with the FF
probe, beam steering assumptions are not required here. The definitions of
offsets (_x_ ~offset~/_y_ ~offset~/_z_ ~offset~), maximum offsets (≤12.5cm for
PC3 and ≤10cm for PC1), array configurations (PC3: 8x2 and 4x1, PC1: 12x12),
and range lengths are summarized in Table 5.1.4.3-1.
The FF 8x2 and 4x1 array patterns with the 90^o^/90^o^ HPBW assumption are
shown in Figure 5.1.4.4-1.

Figure 5.1.4.4-1: FF antenna pattern with 90^o^/90^o^ HPBW for 8x2 antenna
array configuration (left) and 4x1 antenna array configuration (right).
The pattern simulations assume superpositions of individual, single-element
far-field antenna patterns; this approach requires that the NF of Ny x Nz
antenna array is well in the FF of the single-element antenna. The EIRP
simulations were performed using Matlab and CST.
The simulations assume that the FF beam peak direction of the DUT is known for
the sample DUT considered.
For the statistical analyses using Matlab, a total of 100,000 simulations with
random and uniformly spaced offsets were performed. These offsets were varied
between 0 to 12.5cm (10cm) in _x_ and from -12.5cm (-10cm) to 12.5cm (10cm) in
_y_ and _z_ for PC3 (PC1) while making sure that the maximum radial offset
cannot exceed 12.5cm (10cm). The offsets in _x_ were limited to positive
values since it is assumed that the front antenna of the DUT is always in the
upper hemisphere since the geometric centre of the device is aligned with the
centre of the QZ. A sample set of 100,000 random offsets is visualized in
Figure 5.1.4.4-2. Histograms of the respective offset radii, and offsets in
_x_ , _y_ , and _z_ are shown in Figure 5.1.4.4-3.

12.5cm in a single hemisphere.
Since each of the offsets are known/declared, the offset can be properly
compensated, i.e., the pathloss applied to the EIRP measurements is not
referenced to the centre of QZ but to the phase centre of the active antenna
array. The results in this clause focus only on the EIRP results after the
path loss with respect to the offset antenna array was compensated.
Additionally, for the best/optimized measurement uncertainties, the probe
antenna pattern/gain must be compensated since the array offsets can result in
the NF beam peak to be observed from directions with large deviations from the
peak gain direction of the measurement probe/horn as illustrated in Figure
5.1.4-2. In the simulations, probe pattern/gain compensation can be modelled
in the simplest approximation by assuming an omnidirectional pattern of the
probe. To quantify the effect of not compensating the probe antenna pattern,
this section will present measurement uncertainties for a typical horn
antenna. For these simulations, a symmetric pattern of a horn antenna with
\~50^o^ HPBW pattern is assumed as plotted in Figure 5.1.4.4-4, which was
obtained using the following Matlab commands:
ProbeTheta=-180:1:180;
HPBW=50;
ProbePattern_norm=-12*(ProbeTheta/HPBW);

The NF beam peak direction, illustrated in Figure 5.1.4-2, was calculated
using the known FF beam peak direction, the offset of the antenna array, and
the range length.
A histogram of the 100k EIRP simulations for 4 different NF range lengths
(20cm, 25cm, 30cm, 45cm) and the 20m FF range lengths is shown in Figure
5.1.4.4-5 and the statistical results of these simulations are tabulated in
Table 5.1.4.4-1. These results assume that the antenna array offsets and the
probe pattern/gain were compensated.

Figure 5.1.4.4-6 illustrates which simulations for the 20cm range length
result in the minimum and maximum EIRPs after antenna offset and probe pattern
compensation.

Figure 5.1.4.4-6: Illustration of simulations for the 20cm range length with
8x2 antenna configuration resulting in smallest (left) and largest (right)
EIRPs after antenna offset and probe pattern compensation.
When the antenna array offset is towards the probe antenna, shown in the left
plot of Figure 5.1.4.4-6, the EIRP without the offset compensation is very
high (20.7dBm in this example); however, the offset compensation, i.e.,
applying the pathloss between the probe antenna and the active antenna array,
helps to significantly improve the EIRP measurement uncertainty with respect
to the EIRP measured in the FF.
Once the array offsets and the probe antenna pattern are compensated in the NF
with CFFDNF methodology assuming the black&white-box approach, almost
insignificant measurement uncertainties for PC3 devices can be observed at
45cm. At distances less than 45cm, measurement uncertainties must be taken
into account.
When the probe pattern/gain is not compensated, a much larger variation of the
measured EIRP results is expected due to the large off broadside directions of
the antenna panels from the probe antenna, as illustrated schematically in
Figure 5.1.4-2. This is further quantified in Figure 5.1.4.4-6 and in Table
5.1.4.4-2 for the same simulations. These results assume that the antenna
array offsets are compensated while the probe pattern/gain were not
compensated, i.e., the pattern in Figure 5.1.4.4-4 was applied to the
simulations.

The latter results clearly demonstrate that when performing measurements in
the NF with CFFDNF methodology assuming the black&white-box approach, the
probe antenna pattern must be compensated.
A study to determine whether 1k or even 250 offset simulations are sufficient
for the MU results, a comparison of 100k vs 1k vs 250 offset simulations was
made. The visualization of 100k vs 1k random offsets is illustrated in Figure
5.1.4.4-8. Clearly, the 100k offsets are uniformly distributed in the
hemisphere while the random 250 and 1k offsets are distributed rather
sparsely.

The results summarizing the different simulations are tabulated in Table

configuration, the difference in mean error and standard deviation is almost
insignificant.

Another investigation focused on the MUs at two different frequencies at
opposite ends of FR2, i.e., 28GHz and 49GHz using the same fixed range
lengths. The simulation results are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.4-5 which show
that the MUs at 28GHz are larger than at 49GHz.
As outlined in Table 5.1.4.4-4 below, the range lengths as a function of
wavelength are different between those two frequencies. The MUs are smaller
for 49GHz when compared to 28GHz since the distances in wavelength are larger
for the 40GHz case.

Another investigation focused on whether Matlab which is using an analytical
approximation of the radiation pattern of the antenna arrays in the NF and FF
based on the superposition approach yields similar uncertainties as a full EM
simulation tool, i.e., CST, which is calculating the NF and FF patterns based
on a numerical approach. Figure 5.1.4.4-9 illustrates the differences of the
simulated 8x2 antenna patterns between Matlab (solid lines) and CST (dashed
lines) both for the FF interface distance of 2 _D_ ^2^/λ, i.e., 47cm at 28GHz
with _D_ =5cm, (red lines) and the NF interface distance of
$0.62\sqrt{D^{3}\text{/}\lambda}\text{ }$, i.e., 7cm at 28GHz with _D_ =5cm,
(blue lines) in two principal cuts. Clearly, the agreement between Matlab and
CST simulations of a dipole-based antenna element array placed over a ground
plane is very good in both NF and FF. The CST analyses which used a grid size
of 1^o^ in ∆θ and ∆φ. Those results are summarized in Table 5.1.4.4-6 and
assume that array offsets and the feed probe have been compensated. The
simulations with the limited number of offsets assumed the same offsets were
used in Matlab and CST. Overall, these results show that were good agreement
between 100k and the limited number of offsets can be achieved and that the
Matlab and CST simulations yield excellent agreement.

While it has always been argued that TRP can be tested in the near-field due
to conservation of power, no clear measurement uncertainty analyses have been
presented to quantify the errors. The findings for measurement uncertainties
when testing TRP in the near field using CFFDNF are presented next.
An analysis of the impact on measurement uncertainty by testing TRP in the NF
was performed according to the assumption for TRP offsets in Table 5.1.2.1-1.
In this analysis, near-field effects of the antenna pattern were taken into
account. Figure 5.1.4.4-10 below illustrates the differences in the 8x2
antenna pattern at the 2D^2^/λ distance (a) and at 1/8^th^ of that distance
(b).

Next, TRP simulation results are presented for the CFFDNF methodology for PC1
based on the 12x12 antenna configuration following the assumptions outlined in
Section 5.1.4.3. The Matlab simulation results are summarized in Table
5.1.4.4-10 with and without path loss correction. For these simulations, a
uniform angular grid spacing was applied in θ and φ to the TRP grid. It should
be noted that the antenna array offset must be known/declared when the path
loss correction is applied.

For PC1, TRP test cases with a uniform angular spacing in θ and φ do not
require additional measurement uncertainty due to reduced range length for
\- range lengths exceeding 20cm if the path loss correction is applied for
measurement grids with step size of at most 5^o^ (unique number of grid
points: 2522)
\- for range lengths exceeding 35cm if the path loss correction is not applied
for measurement grids with step size of at most 5^o^ (unique number of grid
points: 2522)
Given the large number of grid points, additional test time reduction
techniques based on non-uniform grids were investigated. The focus of this
investigation is for the antenna array offset applied, i.e., the offset must
be known/declared which can be used to determine the NF beam peak direction.
The idea here is to apply a fine grid around the NF beam peak direction to
capture the main portion of the very directive beam while a coarse grid around
the remaining portion of the sphere is applied. This is further illustrated in
Figure 5.1.4.4-12 with the following non-uniform TRP grid assumptions:
\- The known NF beam is shown with the large grey dot. On top, the NF beam
peak is assumed at (0o,0o) while the NF beam peak on the bottom is assumed at
(45o,45o).
\- The red grid points are within a ±20o cone centred around the NF beam peak
with ∆θ=∆φ=2.5^o^.
\- The cyan grid points are outside a ±20o cone centred around the NF beam
peak with ∆θ=∆φ=10^o^.

(0^o^,0^o^) on top and at (45^o^,45^o^) on bottom. Grid points in cyan (red)
are outside (inside) the conical NF beam peak region.
Simulation with 2000 random offsets up to 10cm were performed together with
random permutations of the beam peak direction (rotation in **θ, φ, and twist
α** as outlined in Clause G.1 of [3]). Table 5.1.4.4-11 shows the simulation
results for the non-uniform measurement grids considered the most suitable for
PC1 devices. The average number of unique grid points based on all simulations
investigated is \~900 which shows a significant test time reduction with the
same TRP MUs as the 5^o^ measurement grid with uniform spacing in **θ and** φ,
Table 5.1.4.4-10. For PC1, TRP test cases with a non-uniform angular spacing
in θ and φ do not require additional measurement uncertainty due to reduced
range length for range lengths exceeding 20cm if the path loss correction is
applied for measurement grids with step size of 2.5^o^ within ±20^o^ of the NF
beam peak and step size of 10^o^ outside ±20^o^ of the NF beam peak.

For PC3, TRP test cases with a non-uniform angular spacing in θ and φ do not
require additional measurement uncertainty due to reduced range length for
range lengths exceeding 20cm if the path loss correction is applied for
measurement grids with step size of 5^o^ within ±30^o^ of the NF beam peak and
step size of 15^o^ outside ±30^o^ of the NF beam peak.
The comparison of the TRP measurement grid parameters and the min. number of
grid points are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.4-13 when the antenna array offset is
known and compensated with angular grid spacings placed uniformly and non-
uniformly in θ and φ. Clearly, the non-uniform TRP measurement grid approach
is especially beneficial in terms of test time reduction. The TRP calculation
is left to the system vendor as there are different approaches to determine
TRP, e.g., interpolation of all results to the fine grid vs partial TRPs
calculated within the cone and outside the cone.

and PC1 including potential test time improvement. The simulations assume the

Additional simulations were performed based on the assumption that the DUT
changes the antenna configuration between high-UL power operation, e.g., 8x2
configuration, and low-UL power operation, e.g., 4x1, 1x2, 1x1. Sample
configurations of the active antenna elements placed near the edge and the
centre are visualized in Figure 5.1.4.4-13 for the 8x2 antenna configuration.

The following high-level procedure for the CFFDNF test methodology as
presented in clause 5.1.4.2 for the black&white-box approach was used:
\- Step 1: form the beam towards FF antenna in the Tx beam peak direction for
the higher array order, i.e. 8x2, then activate UBF.
\- Step 2: set the NF probe antenna towards the NF TX beam peak direction,
determined from the antenna offset, range length, and FF beam peak direction
for the higher array order, i.e., 8x2.
\- Step 3: set UE array to transmit with the lower power mode, i.e., by
reducing the number of active elements.
\- Step 4: Measure NF power of the UE for the lower power mode in the NF beam
peak direction determined in Step 2.
\- Step 5: Calculate the EIRP from the NF power in Step 4 by:
\- Adding the composite loss to the centre of the QZ
\- Compensate the actual measurement distance to the centre of the UE array,
using the 8x2 order
\- Applying the probe antenna NF correction.
The simulation results from two companies are for the steps outlined above and
the PC3 worst-case array assumption of 8x2 and the 0.2m NF range length are
shown in Table 5.1.4.4-14. It can be observed that
\- The MUs for the case when the antenna array does not change its antenna
configuration, i.e., the low-UL and high-UL configuration is 8x2, matches the
MU presented in Table 5.1.4.4-1
\- The MUs for the sub-array configurations, i.e., {4x1, 1x1, 1x2}, are the
same or generally smaller than the MU for the 8x2 case

Separate analyses were performed that take the same antenna array offsets into
account but instead of determining the NF beam peak direction and the applying
the path loss compensation with respect to the phase centre of the 8x2 antenna
array, the NF beam peak direction and offset compensation was based on the
centre of the sub-antenna array configuration {4x1, 1x1, 1x2}. These results
are presented in the third row of the table above. Clearly, the MUs for the
4x1 configuration match the MUs presented in Table 5.1.4.4-7.
Similar simulations were performed for the 12x12 (PC1) baseline/high-UL power
configuration and various {8x2, 4x1, 1x1, 1x2} sub-array configurations for
the low-UL power operation; those simulations are shown in Table 5.1.4.4-15.

Similar observations as for the PC3 analyses can be drawn:
\- The MUs for the case when the antenna array does not change its antenna
configuration, i.e., the low-UL and high-UL configuration is 12x12, matches
the MU presented earlier which is captured in Table 5.1.4.4-3
\- The MUs for the sub-array configurations, i.e., {8x2, 4x1, 1x1, 1x2}, are
smaller than the MU for the 12x12 case (which is serving as the reference for
PC1 MU purposes)
\- The MUs for the case when the actual offset position of the sub-array is
declared match the MUs determined in previous simulations, e.g., the MUs for
the 8x2 antenna and for 0.45cm range length match the MUs for the 8x2 antenna
array shown in Table 5.1.4.4-3.
\- It can therefore be concluded that for CFFDNF (with black&white-box
approach):If the phase centre of the reference antenna array (high UL-power
operation: 8x2 for PC3, 12x12 for PC1) is declared, the previously determined
MUs hold if the antenna changes its configuration for the low-UL power
operation
\- If the phase centre of the sub-antenna array used for low-UL power
operation is declared, the previously determined MUs can be further reduced

In this clause, results for near-field and far-field simulations of _N~y~_ x
_N~z~_ antenna arrays for the CFFNF methodology based on the black&white-box

for the most part, the same as those in Table 5.1.4.3-1.
Initial simulations were performed with an EM simulator, CST. The grid size
used for the CST simulations had step sizes of 1^o^ in ∆θ and ∆φ. Given the
previous observation regarding the need to offset the probe pattern, the
simulations for CFFNF using black&white approach only focused on the feed
probe pattern compensated.
The CFFNF results are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.5-1 for 8x2 (PC3) and in Table
5.1.4.5-2 for 12x12 (PC1) and compared with the CFFDNF results (same as those
in Table 5.1.4.4-8). Clearly, the measurement at the additional radius _r_ ~2~
significantly reduces the measurement uncertainties and allows EIRP/EIS
measurements of PC3 (PC1) devices at 21cm (31cm) range length without
additional (with very small) MU. These simulations assume that _r_ ~2~ is
either _r_ ~2~=_r_ ~1~+1cm or _r_ ~2~=_r_ ~1~+2cm.
Subsequent simulations were performed with Matlab based on the same
assumptions. The PC3 results are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.5-3 with results
from two different companies while the PC1 results are tabulated in Table
5.1.4.5-4.

#### 5.1.4.6 Simulation results for CFFNF (using Black-Box Approach)
In this clause, results for near-field and far-field simulations of _N~y~_ x
_N~z~_ antenna arrays for the CFFNF methodology are presented based on the
black-box approach, i.e., the location active antenna panel for the FF beam
peak direction is unknown while only the FF BP direction is known. The
simulation assumptions are, for the most part, the same as those in Table
5.1.4.3-1.
All simulations are performed with an EM simulator, CST. The grid size used
for the CST simulations had step sizes of 1^o^ in ∆θ and ∆φ. Given the
previous observation regarding the need to offset the probe pattern, the
simulations for CFFNF using black&white approach only focused on the feed
probe pattern compensated.
The angular widths of the cone needed for the local searches as a function of
the range length is tabulated in Table 5.1.4.6-1.

of 12.5cm
Range Length [cm] Single-Sided Cone Angle [deg]

Since the black-box approach utilizes/requires relatively wide area local
searches at _r_ =  _r_ ~1~, e.g., the width of the sector is about ±40^o^ for
_r_ ~1~=20cm, with limited local searches at _r_ ~2~ and _r_ ~3~ as
illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.2-2, the test time for the black-box approach is
inherently longer than the black&white-box approach due to the 3 vs 2 radii
and the need for local searches vs no local search requirements. On the other
hand, this approach does not require the declaration of the active antenna
array location.
Suitable approaches to reduce the test time of these local searches include
coarse and fine search approaches, e.g., Figures M.2.2-3 and M.2.2-4 of [6].
Alternatively, continuous non-demodulated EIRP measurements on sectors with
fixed angular distance could be utilized to speed up the local searches, as
illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.6-1 for BP directions near the poles. For this
accelerated search approach, the positioner is moved continuously while the
measurements are performed in close succession.

Figure 5.1.4.6-1: Stepped (left) vs continuous (right) search approach for
EIRP for a FF BP near the pole.
Even for arbitrary FF BP directions not near the pole, a continuous scan over
the sector, can be performed since the beam is locked with the UBF towards the
FF beam peak direction. An illustration of this approach is in Figure
5.1.4.6-2.
{width="5.0in" height="3.2864851268591426in"}
Figure 5.1.4.6-2: Stepped (left) vs continuous (right) search approach for
EIRP for an arbitrary FF BP direction.
As outlined in earlier, the CFFNF methodology based on the black-box approach
leverages the declared FF beam peak direction and since the antenna array
offset is not known/declared, a localized search for the NF beam peak in the
NF must be performed over a small sector around the FF beam peak direction.
For an approximately ±40^o^ cone needed for PC3 devices (based on the 8x2
antenna array configuration) with a 20cm range length and a constant-step size
measurement grid with ∆φ=∆θ=1^o^, around 14k grid points for the initial NF
local search at _r_ =_r_ ~1~ would be required. Obviously, this is completely
impractical due to the enormous test time requirements. The measurement
uncertainties serving as the reference for investigations to follow, are shown
in Table 5.1.4.6-2.

antenna array offsets and probe pattern were compensated and the search grids

For the CFFNF (black box) simulations shown in Table 5.1.4.6-3, the local
searches were performed using a 1^o^ step size in θ and φ to establish the
reference MUs for the CFFNF methodology.
On top of the initial local search at _r_ =_r_ ~1~, small local searches at
_r_ =_r_ ~2~ and _r_ =_r_ ~3~ are required as outlined in Section 5.1.4.2,
i.e., the total number of grid points could exceed the numbers listed in Table
5.1.4.6-2. To significantly reduce the number of total number of grid points,
coarse and fine searches were investigated more closely, i.e., an initial
coarse search at _r_ =_r_ ~1~ with ∆θ~r1,coarse~ and ∆φ~r1,coarse~ and fine
searches around potential NF beam peak candidates with
∆θ~r123,fine~=∆φ~r123,fine~ are then performed at _r_ =_r_ ~1~, _r_ =_r_ ~2~,
and _r_ =_r_ ~3~. The MUs for the optimized search procedures are shown in
Table 5.1.4.6-4; clearly, the presented optimized search grids significantly
reduce the total number of search grid points while maintaining MUs similar to
the reference MUs, Table 5.1.4.6-2.

Constant step size measurement grids can leverage continuous scans to speed up
the searches while 5^o^ searches yield between 200-500 grid points for a
\~±40^o^ cone at _r_ ~1~=20cm. Leveraging coarse and fine search approaches,
e.g., a coarse search grid of 10^o^ (between 40-110 grid points for a \~±40^o^
cone) over the entire cone with localized fine 5^o^ searches could likely
significantly drop the number of grid points for the NF BP search. The total
number could be further reduced when utilizing constant density search grids
instead of constant-step size grids.
A hybrid CFFNF approach could be used which combines the advantages in terms
of test time of the black&white-box approach without the need of a vendor
declaration, i.e., black box. Instead of having to declare the phase centre
offset, this offset is determined first using the CFFNF methodology based on
black-box approach. Here, the following sample approach could be leveraged:
\- For low UL power test case #1
\- Apply the black-box CFFNF test methodology using FF probe
\- Use the FF probe to steer the antenna beam towards the known BP direction
\- Lock the beam using UBF
\- Switch operation to NF probe
\- Perform local searches around sectors centred around the FF peak at three
different radii in the NF
\- Determine FF EIRP
\- Determine phase centre offset of the active antenna
\- For low UL power test cases ≥#2
\- Apply the black&white-box NF test approach using NF probe
\- Use the FF probe to steer the antenna beam towards the known BP direction
\- Lock the beam using UBF
\- Switch operation to NF probe
\- Perform EIRP measurements at two different radii in the NF BP direction
\- Determine EIRP
#### 5.1.4.7 Simulation results for sensitivity of CFFNF to relative
measurement uncertainties
This clause provides simulation assumptions for how uncertainties of power
measurements in the NF, _p_(_d~i~_), affect the estimates for EIRP/EIS
measurements based on the asymptotic expansion approach. As outlined in Figure
5.1.4-2, _d_ is the distance between the NF measurement probe and the centre
of the antenna array, while _r_ is the range length defined as the distance
between the centre of QZ and the NF measurement probe.
The asymptotic expansion approach expression for the normalized power as a
function of d is assumed as follows
$$p\left( d \right) = - \frac{b_{1}}{2}d^{- 2} + b_{2}$$
and is illustrated for two cases, i.e., d1 & d2 maximized and minimized, in
Figure 5.1.4.7-1. For the simulations in this clause, it is assumed that r2 =
r1 + 2cm.

radii approach with the antenna array located closer to the NF probe on the
left than on the right.
Power measurement uncertainties, _u~i~_ , on the NF measurements _p_(_d_ ~i~)
can have an effect on the resulting estimate of the estimated FF EIRP/EIS due
to the asymptotic expansion transformation. This effect is illustrated
schematically in Figure 5.1.4.7-2.

Figure 5.1.4.7-2: Illustration of the effect of power measurement
uncertainties ui applied to NF measurements p(di) on the estimated FF
EIRP/EIS.
For these simulations, _u~i~_ is assumed to be a Gaussian distribution with
std. deviation of σ varying from 0 to 0.4dB. It should be noted that the test
equipment uncertainties, e.g., Uncertainty of the RF power measurement
equipment (B.2.1.6 of [7]) or gNB emulator uncertainty (B.2.1.17 of [7]), are
not applicable in full here since the measurements at _r_ ~1~ and _r_ ~2~ are
performed with the same equipment in close succession. Instead, the relative
power measurement MU apply here.
In these simulations, it is furthermore assumed that _N_ =30 averages are
taken for each power measurement _[p]{.underline}_(_d~i~_).
For fixed offsets, the effect of _u~i~_ with fixed standard deviations are
shown in Table 5.1.4.7-1for the two extreme cases with _d_ ~CFFNF,min~=7.5cm
and _d_ ~CFFNF,max~=20cm, visualized schematically in Figure 5.1.4.7-1. For
each offset, 100K random Gaussian distributions for _u~i~_ with fixed standard
deviations (ranging from 0 to 0.4dB) were simulated to get obtain the mean
errors with respect to the FF EIRP and the standard deviation.

In order to obtain an overall estimate of the MUs, 1000 random offsets from
Company A (500 random offsets from Company B) were evaluated. For each of the
1000 (500) random offsets, 100K random Gaussian distributions (100) for _u~i~_

#### 5.1.4.8 Simulation results for CFFdeltaNF
In this clause, results for near-field and far-field simulations of _N~y~_ x
_N~z~_ antenna arrays for the CFFdeltaNF methodology are presented based on
the black-box approach, i.e., the location active antenna panel for the FF
beam peak direction is unknown while only the FF BP direction is known. The
simulation assumptions are, for the most part, the same as those in Table
5.1.4.3-1. All simulations are performed with various NF search step sizes in
∆θ and ∆φ.
It has to be noted that the local search cone angles per range length shown in
Table 5.1.4.6-1 are valid for CFFdeltaNF, same as the coarse and fine search
approaches to reduce the test time.
The following analyses focus on NF and FF Matlab simulations based the
following high-level test procedure
\- Step 1: Measure FF EIRP of the DUT in the FF beam peak direction for max UL
power with the FF probe
\- Step 2: Perform a local search around the FF beam peak direction for max UL
power with the NF probe without compensating the probe antenna pattern.
\- Step 3: Measure NF EIRP of the DUT in the NF beam peak direction (determine
in Step 2) for max UL power with the NF probe
\- Step 4: Determine the correlation factor (difference between FF and NF EIRP
measurements in Steps 1 and 3)
\- Step 5: Measure NF EIRP of the DUT in the NF beam peak direction for low UL
power with the NF probe
\- Step 6: Estimate the FF EIRP for the low UL power case with the correlation
factor determined in Step 4 and the NF EIRP measured in Step 5
These simulations assume that for the reference high-UL power operation
measurements, a 4x1 and 8x2 PC3 antenna configuration of MxN is used in Steps
1 and 3. When the operation is switched to the low-UL power operation in Step
5, it is assumed that the DUT can switch to an OxP configuration with O≤M and
P≤N. Additionally, it is assumed that any arbitrary sub-array can be
activated, i.e., towards the edges, the centre, or anywhere in between the
full array configuration. Examples for the 8x2 configuration and various OxP
configurations for the low-UL power operation are illustrated in Figure
5.1.4.4-13. For the low-UL power operation, antenna arrays of O={1, 2, 4, 8} x
P={1,2} for the 8x2 and O={1, 2, 4} x P={1} for the 4x2 configuration were
simulated with [all]{.underline} possible locations within the MxN array.
These simulations assumed 2000 random offsets and that the NF beam peak
direction was determined without the NF probe antenna pattern compensation
with 1^o^, 2.5^o^ and 5^o^ local search step sizes for the local search (see
step 2 above). The simulation results for the PC3 DUT with 8x2 configuration
for the high-UL power operation are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.8-1 and with 4x1
configuration for the high-UL power operation in Table 5.1.4.8-2. The
simulation results for PC1 DUT with 12x12 configuration for the high-UL power
operation are tabulated in Table 5.1.4.8-3.

Modelling PA behaviour in polynomial mode is a common method for RF link
simulation and well accepted by the industry [8][9]. Here, a simplified PA
model is added into Matlab simulations to investigate how the PA behaviour
will impact the beamforming pattern shape for high power vs low power.
The received signal expansion after beamforming based on the superposition
approach outlined in detail in 5.1.4.1
$$\text{Signal}(\theta,\phi) \propto \sum_{k = 1}^{N_{y} \cdot
N_{z}}{x_{k}F_{k}\left( \theta_{k},\phi_{k} \right)}F_{p}\left(
\alpha_{k},\beta_{k} \right)\frac{\lambda}{4\pi
d_{k}}e^{j2\pi\frac{d_{k}}{\lambda}}$$
A PA model in polynomial can be expressed as follows [8][9]:
$$y = \ a_{1}x + \ \sum_{i = 2}^{N}a_{i}x^{i}$$
\- $x$: equivalent complex baseband input signal sample for PA
\- $y$: equivalent complex baseband output signal sample from PA
\- $a_{1}:$ PA gain in linear
\- $a_{i}\left( 2 \leq i \leq N \right):$ Parameter charactering PA non-
linearity property determined by output P1dB and output IP2, IP3, etc.
$\sum_{i = 2}^{3}a_{i}x^{i}$ contribute to the non-linearity components,
without loss of generality: $a_{i} \ll$ $a_{1}$
A simplified PA model $y = \ a_{1}x + \ a_{3}x^{3}$, which only contains one
non-linearity item $a_{3}x^{3}$ is introduced into the received signal
expression, the complex input signal for _k_ ^th^ antenna array element
$x_{k}$ is turned to $a_{1}x_{k} + a_{3}x_{k}^{3}$, then
$$\text{Signal}\left( \theta,\phi \right) \propto \sum_{k = 1}^{N_{y} \cdot
N_{z}}{\left( a_{1}x_{k} + a_{3}x_{k}^{3} \right)F_{k}\left(
\theta_{k},\phi_{k} \right)}F_{p}\left( \alpha_{k},\beta_{k}
\right)\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d_{k}}e^{j2\pi\frac{d_{k}}{\lambda}}$$
$$\propto a_{1}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{y} \cdot N_{z}}{x_{k}F_{k}\left(
\theta_{k},\phi_{k} \right)}F_{p}\left( \alpha_{k},\beta_{k}
\right)\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d_{k}}e^{j2\pi\frac{d_{k}}{\lambda}} + \
a_{3}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{y} \cdot N_{z}}{x_{k}^{3}F_{k}\left( \theta_{k},\phi_{k}
\right)}F_{p}\left( \alpha_{k},\beta_{k} \right)\frac{\lambda}{4\pi
d_{k}}e^{j2\pi\frac{d_{k}}{\lambda}}$$
In this simulation, we set the PA parameters, keep the low-UL power input
signal power unchanged, but change the high-UL power input signal power to two
different levels: the 2^nd^ one is 2 dB higher than the 1^st^ one. The
simulations assume 200 random antenna array centre offsets and beam tilt for
PC3 with 8x2 antenna configuration. The NF simulation test distance is 35cm,
the low-UL power EIRP simulation error is plotted in Figure 5.1.4.8-1.
When the operation is switched from high-UL power to low-UL power, the input
signal power experiences a significant change, which means the PA is operated
in two different regions. If both the high-UL power and low-UL power tests
operate the PA in its perfect linearity region, the beam pattern shape change
between high and low power is small and negligible under same antenna
configuration as illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.8-1 (left plot), but if the high-
UL power case working point is approaching the beginning of the nonlinearity
region, for some beamforming tilt direction the beam pattern shape in the
high-UL power case will have a large difference compared to the low-UL power
case as illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.8-1 (right plot). This will then yield a
relatively large error introduced by using the correlation factor deduced from
the high-UL power case.

Some more work is needed to quantify the effect of non-linear PA behaviour on
the CFFdeltaNF MUs.
The high-level six-step measurement procedure was applied with a phased
antenna array operated at 26 GHz. This phased antenna array has an 8x8
configuration and supports beam steering using external control of the code
books. The FF measurements were performed at 84 cm while the NF measurements
were performed at 20 cm. Three beam steering directions, i.e., -60^o^, 0^o^,
and 60^o^ were considered. Some parameters of the measurement procedures are
summarized in Table 5.1.4.8-4.

box approach

0^o^, 60^o^ Frequency 26 GHz FF Distance 84 cm NF Distance 20 cm Offset 0 cm
Since each individual antenna array element has independent amplitude and
phase control, the high-UL power operation of the antenna array was
implemented by maximizing the amplitude weights while those weights were
reduced by 30 dB for the low-UL power operation.
With beam steering applied in a just a single direction, single principal cut
measurements were performed to determine the NF direction (step 2 of the
6-step procedure introduced in the previous section); the NF probe antenna
pattern was not compensated. The NF and FF EIRP patterns at 26 GHz are plotted
in Figure 5.1.4.8-2 for the high-UL and low-UL power operations. It should be
noted that the path loss (to the centre of QZ) was compensated in these plots
already. Some pattern changes between the FF and NF patterns but also pattern
changes between the high-UL and low-UL operation can be noticed.
The measurement results for the three different beam steering directions are
tabulated in Table 5.1.4.8-5. The estimated FF EIRP for the low-UL case is
compared with the measured EIRP to determine the error in the CFFdeltaNF EIRP
MU. Clearly, the results show that the FF EIRP can be estimated well but the
pattern changes due to low-UL vs high-UL power operation can introduce some
MUs. More detailed analyses are required to study the pattern changes due to
amplifiers and phase shifters operated at different power levels to determine
the corresponding example MU.

While the errors in Table 5.1.4.8-5 are relatively small and could be
interpreted as overall measurement MUs instead of being caused by the change
in antenna pattern, the overall trend of the pattern plots and EIRP errors
seem to support the earlier findings.
Another set of measurements was performed where the antenna configuration was
modified between high-UL (MxN=8x8) and low-UL (OxP) operation similar as
described in the previous section. Here, the OxP configuration was a subset of
the 8x8 configuration with OxP={8x4, 8x2, and 8x1} configurations. For each of
the OxP array configurations, different positions within the 8x8 array were
activated. Sample 8x4 low-UL configurations and starting coordinates are
visualized in Figure 5.1.4.8-3.

The measurement results for the set of measurements at two different NF range
lengths of 20cm and 35cm with changes in the antenna array configuration are
tabulated in Table 5.1.4.8-6. These results yield similar findings as
presented earlier:
\- When the antenna configuration for the low UL power operation is a subset
of the antenna configuration for the high UL power operation, the CFFdeltaNF
methodology needs to take EIRP MU uncertainties into account
\- These uncertainties increase with decreasing range lengths

The next part focuses on simulations based on the CFFdeltaNF methodology using
black-box approach, specifically the correlation factor approach where the
low-UL power operation is no longer triggered. Instead, the low-UL power
measurement is the result of performing measurements at frequencies that yield
low EIRPs when compared to the EIRPs at the reference frequency, e.g., ACLR.
Therefore, the test procedure for this approach is as follows with the first 4
steps identical and slightly adjusted steps 5 and 6 to the approach introduced
earlier:
\- Step 1: Measure FF EIRP of the DUT in the FF beam peak direction for high-
UL power with the FF probe at the reference frequency
\- Step 2: Perform a local search around the FF beam peak direction for high-
UL power with the NF probe without compensating the probe antenna pattern at
the reference frequency.
\- Step 3: Measure NF EIRP of the DUT in the NF beam peak direction
(determined in Step 2) for high-UL power with the NF probe at the reference
frequency
\- Step 4: Determine the correlation factor (difference between FF and NF EIRP
measurements in Steps 1 and 3) and add the pathloss differences at the desired
frequency
\- Step 5: Measure NF EIRP of the DUT in the NF beam peak direction with the
NF probe at the desired frequency other than the reference frequency
\- Step 6: Estimate the FF EIRP for the desired frequency with the correlation
factor determined in Step 4 and the NF EIRP measured in Step 5
The simplified PA model $y = \ a_{1}x + \ a_{3}x^{3}$ described in the
previous section is used in this simulation. The 1^st^ item $a_{1}\sum_{k =
1}^{N_{y} \cdot N_{z}}{x_{k}F_{k}\left( \theta_{k},\phi_{k}
\right)}F_{p}\left( \alpha_{k},\beta_{k} \right)\frac{\lambda}{4\pi
d_{k}}e^{j2\pi\frac{d_{k}}{\lambda}}$ is the major component for in-band
(wanted) signal, while some of the 2^nd^ item $a_{3}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{y} \cdot
N_{z}}{x_{k}^{3}F_{k}\left( \theta_{k},\phi_{k} \right)}F_{p}\left(
\alpha_{k},\beta_{k} \right)\frac{\lambda}{4\pi
d_{k}}e^{j2\pi\frac{d_{k}}{\lambda}}$ will also contribute to the in-band
pattern; the OOB signal's pattern shape will be impacted by the non-linearity
component $a_{3}x_{k}^{3}$ [8][9].
When $x_{k}$ is defined in amplitude and phase expression as $x_{k} = \left|
x_{k} \right|\exp\left( j\varphi_{k} \right)$, we assume the amplitude is
[constant]{.underline} and only adjust the phase for each channel, then the
2^nd^ item can be expressed as $a_{3}\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{y} \cdot
N_{z}}{{\exp\left( j{3\varphi}_{k} \right)F}_{k}\left( \theta_{k},\phi_{k}
\right)}F_{p}\left( \alpha_{k},\beta_{k} \right)\frac{\lambda}{4\pi
d_{k}}e^{j2\pi\frac{d_{k}}{\lambda}}$
If $\varphi_{k}$ is not always zeros for all indices $k$ , $\sum_{k =
1}^{N_{y} \cdot N_{z}}{{\exp\left( j{3\varphi}_{k} \right)F}_{k}\left(
\theta_{k},\phi_{k} \right)}F_{p}\left( \alpha_{k},\beta_{k}
\right)\frac{\lambda}{4\pi d_{k}}e^{j2\pi\frac{d_{k}}{\lambda}}$ will not
generate the same pattern shape as $\sum_{k = 1}^{N_{y} \cdot
N_{z}}{{\exp\left( j\varphi_{k} \right)F}_{k}\left( \theta_{k},\phi_{k}
\right)}F_{p}\left( \alpha_{k},\beta_{k} \right)\frac{\lambda}{4\pi
d_{k}}e^{j2\pi\frac{d_{k}}{\lambda}}$ because of the different phase offset
among multiple channels.
Below Figures 5.1.4.8-4 and 5.1.4.8-5 use the 8x2 antenna array with random
position offset and beam tilt as an example to show the PA's non-linearity
impact on the OOB signal pattern shape.
For Figure 5.1.4.8-4, when the PA has poor linearity, the OOB signal pattern
shape (plot on right) is different from the in-band signal pattern (plot on
left). In this case, when using the relative correlation factor approach and
the local NF peak direction deduced from the in-band signal to estimate OOB
EIRP, the error can be as large as -3.67 dB.
For Figures 5.1.4.8-4, when the PA has very good linearity, the OOB signal
pattern shape (plot on right) is almost same as the in-band signal pattern
(plot on left). In this case, the error is insignificant.
These analyses show the out-of-band signal's pattern shape will be impacted by
the PA behaviour; the relative correlation factor deduced from the in-band
signal to estimate out of band signal's FF power will introduce extra errors.
Clearly, the corresponding EIRP MUs are dependent on the PA and needs further
study.

The next investigation focuses on measurements and the 6-step procedure
discussed earlier. The measurements presented in Table 5.1.4.8-7 use the same
8x8 antenna array introduced earlier. Here, a 200 MHz wide signal is applied
to the RF ports of the phased antenna array and the power in the reference
channel around 26 GHz as well as the adjacent channels (Low, High) were
measured in both the NF at {20cm, 35cm} range lengths and FF at 84cm range
length in the respective in-band beam peak directions.

These results show that the relative correlation factor approach of CFFdeltaNF
is generally applicable for measurements at frequencies other than the
reference frequency. However, as outlined earlier, MUs should be considered
for this approach to take into account pattern changes due to non-ideal PA
behaviour which was verified using measurements. More detailed analyses are
required to study the non-linearity effects of PAs on the corresponding EIRP
MU of CFFdeltaNF.
Another investigation focused on the effect of the UE pattern change over
frequency in the resulting EIRP using the CFFdeltaNF methodology with black-
box approach as described in clause 5.1.4.2. A simulation campaign using
Matlab was defined following the assumptions presented in Table 5.1.4.3-1 with
additional frequencies at 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1200MHz from the centre
frequency (i.e. 28GHz).
In this case, the EIRP error is calculated between the theoretical EIRP value
in FF at the test frequency (e.g. 400MHz from channel's centre frequency) and
the resulting EIRP value calculated in the FF at the same test frequency but
applying the $\mathbf{\mathrm{\Delta}}_{\mathbf{\text{NFtoFF}}}$ calculated
for the reference test case at the reference frequency.
Mean and standard deviation errors, for all offsets and test frequencies, are
presented in table 5.1.4.8-8, including results for different grid steps for
the local search:

These results, assuming no change in antenna patterns due to non-linearities
of the PAs, etc., confirm that CFFdeltaNF method is not impacted the potential
changes in the pattern of the UE array due to frequency response.
#### 5.1.4.9 Simulation results for Influence of Noise
This clause provides influence of noise simulation assumptions and results for
IFF/DFF, CFFDNF, and CFFNF methodologies.
The influence of noise quantifies the effect of a SNR at the TE input on EIRP
measurements as outlined in [7].
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | B.2.1.27 Influence of noise | | | | This contributor describes an offset uncertainty factor caused by a | | noise floor especially in a case of low SNR. This contributor works | | as a bias to measured results only to a direction to increase values | | and thus this shall be included in the uncertainty budget table as a | | systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty value can be derived by the | | following equation. | | | | $$\text{Influence\ of\ noise} = 10\log_ | | {10}\left( 1 + 10^{\left( - \frac{\text{SNR}}{10} \right)} \right)$$ | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
For low UL power test cases, the \~1m path losses due to range length (DFF) or
focal distance (IFF) yield very poor SNR conditions at the TE input. Assuming
a fixed noise level at the TE input, a reduction in measurement distance/range
loss will significantly improve the SNR conditions for CFFDNF and CFFNF when
compared to DFF/IFF as illustrated in Figure 5.1.4.9-1.
{width="6.695138888888889in" height="3.0444444444444443in"}
Figure 5.1.4.9-1: SNR Conditions for different test methodologies
The analyses in this clause are focused on the following PC3 assumption:
\- For an _r_ ~1~=20cm CFFNF range length (distance between probe and centre
of QZ), the min distance between the probe and the antenna array is _d_
~CFFNF,min~= _r_ ~1~-12.5cm (max offset)=7.5cm
\- For an _r_ ~1~=20cm CFFNF range length, the max distance between the probe
and the antenna array is _d_ ~CFFNF,max~=_r_ ~1~=20cm
\- Similarly, for the CFFDNF methodology with a range length of _r_
~CFFDNF~=35cm, the min (max) distance between the probe and the antenna array
is _d_ ~CFFDNF,min~ = _r_ ~CFFDNF~-12.5cm=22.5cm (_d_ ~CFFDNF,max~ = _r_
~CFFDNF~=35cm).
\- For the DFF/IFF calculations, we considered a _r_ ~DFF/IFF~=1m range length
for simplicity.
The improvements in SNR for CFFNF and CFFDNF compared to DFF/IFF are tabulated
in Table 5.1.4.9-1.

The analyses of the difference in EIRP when compared to the FF EIRP due to
noise were based on 10k different AWGN simulations and _N_ =30 averages were
taken for each EIRP analysed. In each of the 10k AWGN simulations, a signal is
generated first with 1000 samples, subsequently AWGN with specified SNR on the
signal is applied, and in the end power of signal + AWGN was measured. These
simulated results, labelled '\|Mean Err to FF Reference\|' in the following
tables are then compared with the calculations using the analytical $10

The simulated influence of noise, i.e., \|Mean Err to FF Reference\|, was
determined for non-fixed distances _d_. Here, 1000 random offsets uniformly
spaced from 0 to 12.5cm were simulated and the individual results were
averaged to obtain the results tabulated in Table 5.1.4.9-5 for PC3 devices.
The simulated influences of noise are within the results at the respective
extremes presented in Table 5.1.4.9-3 (min offset) and Table 5.1.4.9-4 (max
offset). Similar simulations were performed for PC1 devices with the 12x12
antenna configuration with maximum offset of 10cm and are tabulated in Table

DNF has the following applicability:
\- Beam peak searches and spherical coverage test cases are not applicable for
the black-box approach. An extensive black&white-box approach would be
required to perform these tests with the NF measurement probe. Given the
complexities of the extensive black&white-box approach, DNF is not deemed a
feasible enhancement of the methodology for conformance testing but it might
be suitable during UE development phase.
\- The low UL power/high DL power EIRP/EIS test cases in the known FF BP
direction are not applicable to the black box approach.
\- The applicability of the low UL power/high DL power EIRP/TRP/EIS test cases
in the known BP direction and with the black&white-box approach is FFS.
The assumption for this "black & white box" testing approach is that the
antenna phase centre offset for the antenna panel that corresponds to the FF
beam peak is known and declared, i.e., following the "white box" approach
discussed earlier. On the other hand, however, it is assumed that the
geometric centre of the DUT is aligned with the centre of the QZ, i.e.,
following the "black box" approach. This approach would have the same
advantages as the "black box" approach over the "white box" approach in terms
of complexity, test time, MU, and improvements of the relaxations and is
summarized in Table 5.1.5-1 below.

## 5.2 Polarization basis mismatch between the TE and DUT
### 5.2.1 General
The investigation of polarization basis mismatch enhancements to the FR2 test
methodology includes the following aspects: scope of test cases with
polarization basis mismatch between the TE and DUT issues, enhanced test
methods, applicability of the enhanced test methods.
The initial testing methodology for FR2 UE RF requirement verification is
defined in [3] and features a measurement antenna capable of
\- transmitting and receiving on two orthogonal polarizations
\- introducing linearly polarized downlink signals at the centre of the quiet
zone one polarization at a time
\- measuring the total uplink signal power by combining the power measured by
two orthogonally polarized antennas sequentially or
\- demodulating the signal received by a single polarization at a time.
Regarding polarization basis mismatch between the UE TE and DUT, there are two
main issues:
\- DL polarization basis mismatch for EIRP measurement. The mismatch between
the TE and UE may lead such UEs to disable a Tx chain associated with one DL
polarization and may result in an EIRP measurement which fails to include the
polarization gain at some test points;
\- UL polarization basis mismatch for demodulation. Some UE implementations
may support uplink transmission diversity schemes which, although transparent
to the specification, impact the demodulation performance when the UL signal
is demodulated on just a single polarization.
Therefore, these two issues are addressed separated with different approach.
The potential solutions to minimize the impact of polarization basis mismatch
address two distinct goals: to enhance the EIRP measurement of UEs with
various capabilities, and to enhance the test equipment demodulation
performance in the uplink, such that a test mode to disable Tx diversity at
the UE is no longer necessary for the UE to perform conformance testing.
### 5.2.2 Enhanced test method for EIRP measurement
#### 5.2.2.1 TPMI method
Transmitted Matrix Precoding Indicator (TPMI) is the basis of codebook based
transmission enabling multi-port antenna transmission. TPMI method is
identified as applicable method to enhance EIRP measurement, which is able to
activate dual polarization transmission in EIRP measurement. The applicability
of this method is defined in Clause 5.2.2.2.
For FR2 UEs support the TPMI method, the precoding matrix $W$ is given by
Table 5.2.2.1-1 (same as Table 6.3.1.5-1 in TS 38.211 [4]). 2Tx TPMI index 2-5
can force UE single-layer transmission using two antenna ports. Among them,
only TPMI index 2 is selected for EIRP measurement.
Table 5.2.2.1-1: Precoding matrix $\mathbf{W}$ for single-layer transmission
using two antenna ports.
TPMI index $$\mathbf{W}\mathbf{  
}$$
* * *
0 -- 5 $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} - - 1
\ 0 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \  
0 \ 1 \ 1 \ - 1 \ j \ - j \  
\end{bmatrix}$$ \end{bmatrix}$$ \end{bmatrix}$$ \end{bmatrix}$$
\end{bmatrix}$$ \end{bmatrix}$$
The permitted test methods (i.e. DFF, IFF and NFTF) in [3] are all applicable
for TPMI method with the additional procedure that the UE should be configured
with TPMI index and working at single-layer transmission using two antenna
ports, before performing EIRP-based test procedures in Clause 5.2.1.3 in
TR38.810 [3].:
\- Peak EIRP Measurement Procedure
\- TRP Measurement Procedure
\- TX Beam Peak direction search and EIRP Spherical Coverage
#### 5.2.2.2 Applicability of TPMI side condition method
TPMI is applicable for one layer transmission with multi-port antenna. In FR2,
dual polarization can be regarded as dual antenna ports, so it is natural to
activate dual polarization transmission with TPMI side condition in EIRP
measurement procedure. However, for TPMI supporting dual antenna ports, the
number of SRS ports (_nrofSRS-Ports_) is configured as 2 for both one layer
transmission with 'full power transmission' and two layers transmission with
regular UL MIMO, as specified in clause 6.1 of TS 38.101-2 [2]:
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | For a UE that supports \'UL full power transmission\' and is | | configured to transmit a single layer with _nrofSRS-Ports_ = 2, the | | requirements for UL MIMO operation apply only when it is configured | | for any of its declared full power modes in IE | | _FullPowerTransmission-r16_ (as defined in TS 38.331[13]). | | | | For a UE configured to transmit 2 layers, transmitter requirements | | for UL MIMO operation apply when the UE transmits on 2 ports on the | | same CDM group. The UE may use higher MPR values outside this | | limitation. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
Thus, TPMI method is applicable for the following FR2 UEs:
\- Rel-15 Coherent UE
\- Rel-16 Coherent UE
\- Rel-16 UE supporting UL full power transmission mode1 (_ul-
FullPowerTransmission_ = _fullpowerMode1_)
Other UEs are not applicable for TPMI based test method.
#### 5.2.2.3 Alternative test method
A number of open issues have been identified with the configuration of 2-port
CSI-RS method, and a conclusion whether this method is a feasible enhancement
is TBD.
### 5.2.3 Enhanced test method for UL demodulation measurement
#### 5.2.3.1 Test equipment Zero-forcing MIMO receiver
As an enhancement to the FR2 test equipment topology, it has been proposed to
adopt a zero-forcing MIMO receiver architecture so that dual-polarization
transmissions by the UE can be demodulated by the test equipment receiver.
Two methods of demodulation and EVM calculation were discussed, one utilized
DMRS-based channel inversion (Method 1), and the other based on inversion of
the LSE-estimate of the channel (Method 2).
##### 5.2.3.1.1 Method 1
###### 5.2.3.1.1.1 Method 1 description
The EVM calculation method for 2-layer measurements is shown in Figure
5.2.3.1.1.1-1 and for 1-layer measurements in Figure 5.2.3.1.1.1-2.

Figure 5.2.3.1.1.1-2: EVM calculation block diagram for 1-Layer
The TE receives signals from 2 different ports which are connected to the dual
polarized measurement antenna in the FR2 test system.
For the 2-layer transmission case shown in Figure 5.2.3.1.1.1-1 a MIMO
equalization step as described in section 5.2.3.1.1.2 is performed to separate
the layers.
For the 1-layer transmission case shown in Figure 5.2.3.1.1.1-2 the signals
from both measurement antenna polarizations are combined using maximum ratio
combining as described in section 5.2.3.1.1.3.
Each layer is then processed as described in section 5.2.3.1.1.4 to receive
the measurement results for each individual layer.
###### 5.2.3.1.1.2 Method 1 MIMO Equalization
The MIMO equalization is based only on reference signals (DMRS) without using
any data symbols. In order to obtain comparable EVM results independent of the
number of DMRS symbols per slot, only the first DMRS symbol in each slot is
used.
Estimation of effective 2x2 channel matrix is a well known procedure if
reference signals use different subcarriers, e.g. in case of DMRS antenna
ports 0 and 2. In case that same subcarriers are used, e.g. DMRS antenna ports
0 and 1, a channel decomposition is necessary taking advantage of the
orthogonal codes _w~f~_ and _w~t~_ and assuming identical channel coefficients
for adjacent subcarriers of same CDM group.
Effective channel including the precoding matrix _P_ is:
$$\widetilde{H} = HP = \ \begin{bmatrix} {\widetilde{h}}_{0,0} &
{\widetilde{h}}_{0,1} \ {\widetilde{h}}_{1,0} & {\widetilde{h}}_{1,1} \
\end{bmatrix}$$
with
$${\widetilde{h}}_{n,\nu} = \frac{y_{n}r_{\nu}^{*}}{{|r_{\nu}|}^{2}}$$
where _y_ denotes the received symbol on port index _n_ and _r_ the reference
signal for layer index _ν_.
Since reference signals of a specific layer are transmitted only on
subcarriers of one CDM group channel, interpolation is needed in order to
obtain channel coefficients for all subcarriers. Channel interpolation is done
using the channel coefficients of active CDM group in all other CDM groups.
The channel coefficients used to calculate the equalizer coefficients are
obtained after channel smoothing in frequency domain by computing the moving
average of interpolated channel coefficients. The moving average window size
is 7. For subcarriers at or near the edge of allocation the window size is
reduced accordingly.
The ZF equalizer coefficients are calculated as the inverse of the effective
channel matrix, in general:
$$G_{\text{ZF}} = {\widetilde{H}}^{- 1}$$
###### 5.2.3.1.1.3 Method 1 Maximum Ratio Combining
The channel estimation for maximum ratio combining is based only on reference
signals (DMRS) w/o including any data symbols. One or all DMRS symbols of one
slot can be considered, but in order to obtain comparable EVM results
independent of number of DMRS symbols per slot, only first DMRS symbol is
used.
Estimation of effective 2x1 channel is a well known procedure. In case of
transmit diversity, the effective channel includes the precoding matrix _P_ :
$$\widetilde{H} = HP = \ \begin{bmatrix} {\widetilde{h}}_{0} \
{\widetilde{h}}_{1} \ \end{bmatrix}$$
with
$${\widetilde{h}}_{n} = \frac{y_{n}r^{*}}{{|r|}^{2}}$$
where _y_ denotes the received symbol on port index _n_ and _r_ the reference
signal.
Since reference signals are transmitted only on subcarriers of one CDM group,
channel interpolation is needed in order to obtain channel coefficients for
all subcarriers. Channel interpolation is done using the channel coefficients
of active CDM group in all other CDM groups.
The channel coefficients used to calculate the equalizer coefficients are
obtained after channel smoothing in frequency domain by computing the moving
average of interpolated channel coefficients. The moving average window size
is 7. For subcarriers at or near the edge of allocation the window size is
reduced accordingly.
The ZF equalizer coefficients for maximum ratio combining are calculated as
pseudo inverse of effective channel, in general:
$$G_{\text{ZF}} = {\widetilde{H}}^{+} =
{({\widetilde{H}}^{H}\widetilde{H})}^{- 1}{\widetilde{H}}^{H}$$
###### 5.2.3.1.1.4 Method 1 Layer processing
After performing either the MIMO equalization as described in section
5.2.3.1.1.2 or the maximum ratio combining as described in section
5.2.3.1.1.3, each layer is processed using the existing procedure as defined
in Annex E of TS 38.521-1 [6].
Since the channel estimation is calculated only on first DMRS symbol an
averaging including all 14 symbols of one slot, i.e. data and reference
signals, is needed in order to minimize EVM. The averaging is achieved by the
LS equalization method described for single layer in Annex E.3. of TS 38.521-2
[6].
_MS(f,t)_ and _NS(f,t)_ are processed with a least square (LS) estimator, to
derive one equalizer coefficient per time slot and per allocated subcarrier.
_EC(f)_ is defined for each layer as:
$$\text{EC}_{\nu}(f) = \frac{\sum_{t =
0}^{13}{\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)^{_}\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)}}{\sum_{t =
0}^{13}{MS_{\nu}(f,t)^{_}\text{NS}_{\nu}(f,t)}}$$
With * denoting complex conjugation. _EC(f)_ are used to equalize layer data
symbols.
EVM equalizer spectral flatness is derived from equalizer coefficients for
each layer as follows:
$$c_{\nu} = \left| \text{EC}_{\nu}(f) \right|\ \sqrt{\left| g_{\nu,0}
\right|^{2} + \left| g_{\nu,1} \right|^{2}}$$
##### 5.2.3.1.2 Method 2
###### 5.2.3.1.2.1 Method 2 description
The block diagram of this demodulation scheme for FR2 2L UL is shown in figure
5.2.3.1.2.1-1. Everything to the right of the FFT blocks is per SC, and
therefore must be replicated for the entire UL allocation. Figure
5.2.3.1.2.1-2 shows the 2L demodulation calculator while suppressing sections
that would be unused for single layer operation.
For the 2-layer transmission case shown in Figure 5.2.3.1.2.1-1 a MIMO
equalization step as described in section 5.2.3.1.2.2 is performed to separate
the layers.
For the 1-layer transmission case shown in Figure 5.3.2.1.2.1-2 the signals
from both measurement antenna polarizations are combined using maximum ratio
combining as described in section 5.2.3.1.2.3.

###### 5.2.3.1.2.2 Method 2 MIMO Equalization
For the 2L UL MIMO EVM test case, the system is framed as:
$$\mathbf{y = H\ }\left( \mathbf{G}\ \mathbf{W}\ \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{n}
\right)$$
Here, H is the 2x2 OTA channel, G is the 2x2 diversity scheme that the UE
uses, and W is the 2x2 precoder matrix. G and W are UE-resident as shown in
Figure 5.2.3.1.2.2-1.
{width="3.259301181102362in" height="2.29in"}
Figure 5.2.3.1.2.2-1: UE implementation model
Here, the effective channel (HGW) as seen by the TE can be represented by a
2x2 matrix for each subcarrier ('SC'). The process of equalization is
implemented by multiplying data collected simultaneously at the TE receiver
ports 'y' by an equalization matrix 'A'. A unique 'A' matrix is computed for
each SC. Using the ZF equalization method, 'A' is generated as the inverse of
the estimate 'F' of the effective channel HGW for that SC.
$$\widehat{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{A}.\mathbf{y}$$
$\mathbf{A}{\mathbf{=}\left( \mathbf{F} \right)}^{- 1}$; where $\mathbf{F = \
}\widehat{\mathbf{(HGW)}}$
For each SC, the train of reconstructed symbols and received symbols are
jointly used to estimate F (effective channel, also per SC), by minimizing the
LSE between the received symbols and those that are calculated from the
estimated channel and the reconstructed symbols, over all the symbols in the
measurement interval. This technique is a 2L generalization of the legacy
method to estimate the legacy rank 1 channel. This LSE minimization procedure
results in the following channel estimate:
$$\mathbf{F} =
\sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{\text{.x}}}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}.\left(
\sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}}
\right)^{- 1}$$
Where **x~k~** and **y~k~** are respectively the k^th^ transmitted and
received OFDM symbol in the measurement interval:
$$\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{k}} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{1,k} \ x_{2,k} \
\end{bmatrix};\ \mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{k}} = \begin{bmatrix} y_{1,k} \ y_{2,k} \
\end{bmatrix}$$
Note the strong resemblance to the expression for channel estimate for the
single layer legacy demodulation case.
While A can be taken as the inverse of 'F' for the ZF equalizer, we show later
that there is a more general form of A that helps streamline single layer and
2L treatments. Two aspects bear further consideration: the existence of F and
the invertibility of 'F', see section 5.2.3.1.2.5. The detailed treatment
logically derives that if either F or F^-1^ do not exist, it is because the UE
cannot support an OTA channel (coded into matrix 'H') of rank2, and is unable
to maintain valid 2L UL. Failure to calculate either of the quantities
therefore is tied to poor UE implementation rather than TE limitation.
Noting that A is the inverse of the estimate of the product HGW, the
equalization step can be written as:
$$\widehat{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{A}.\mathbf{y = A\ H\ G\ Wx + A\ H\ n ≝ x + A\
H\ n}$$
The matrix equation can be resolved into 2 separate scalar equations
corresponding to the two layers:
$$\widehat{x_{1}} = x_{1} + v_{1}$$
$$\widehat{x_{2}} = x_{2} + v_{2}$$
Where, x̂~m~ represents equalized layer data 'm', x~m~ represents
reconstructed (ideal) layer 'm' data, and _v_ ~m~ represents noise
accompanying ideal layer data 'm' after equalization. Note that the
transmitted symbols are recovered without phase or gain modification, albeit
in the presence of accompanying noise (responsible for EVM degradation). This
is the case for every allocated SC -- when the symbol on each sub carrier on
each layer is reproduced without gain modification as this method does, no
flatness artefacts are introduced into the measurements.
###### 5.2.3.1.2.3 Method 2 Maximal Ratio Combining
The channel estimate remains of the same form as in the 2L case, but the
dimensions are now 2x1 because x is now a scalar for the single layer case:
$$\mathbf{F} = \sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{k}}\text{.x}}_{k}^{H}.\left(
\sum_{k}^{}{x_{k}x_{k}^{H}} \right)^{- 1}$$
Because x is a scalar, (Σxx^H^)^-1^ is merely the reciprocal of a scalar
quantity. Consequently, there are no numerical corner cases pertaining to
existence of the quantity to ponder.
Due to F not being square, the equalization matrix 'A' must be derived as the
pseudo inverse of F, rather than a true inverse as in the 2L case:
$$\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{\text{SL}}}{\mathbf{=}\left(
\mathbf{F}^{\mathbf{H}}\mathbf{F} \right)}^{- 1}\mathbf{F}^{\mathbf{H}}$$
This type of ZF equalizer implements MRC for the single layer case. Note that
this expression simplifies to A=F^-1^ for the 2L case, and so, 'A~SL~' is a
more general construction for 'A' that is applicable to both cases (single
layer as well as 2L).
###### 5.2.3.1.2.4 Method 2 EVM equalizer flatness
In the legacy single layer UL case, the channel estimate for each SC was a
(complex) scalar, so it was straightforward to evaluate equalizer flatness. In
the 2L test case however, the channel equalizer 'A' consists of 4 elements, 2
for each layer. Framing A as a row vector:
$$A = \begin{bmatrix} A_{1}^{T} \ A_{2}^{T} \ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} \ a_{21} & a_{22} \ \end{bmatrix}$$
For layer 'm', recall that the ZF equalization coefficients for each layer
A~m~^T^ are scaled to diagonalize the channel. There is no realistic bound on
the relative ratios of the coefficients, but the coefficients together
preserve any frequency domain shape of the channel. Therefore, a composite
parameter c~m~ for each layer 'm' can be used to evaluate the equalizer
spectrum flatness, given by:
$$c_{m} = \left\| \mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{m}}^{\mathbf{T}} \right\|$$
Or
$$c_{m} = \sqrt{\left| a_{m1} \right|^{2} + \left| a_{m2} \right|^{2}}$$
The FR2 single layer case is merely a subset of the 2L case, where 'm' can
take on just one value: 1.
###### 5.2.3.1.2.5 Method 2 channel invertibility considerations
Recall that F, the estimate of the effective channel for each sub carrier is
derived as an averaging operation over multiple OFDM symbols:
$$\mathbf{F} =
\sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{\text{.x}}}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}.\left(
\sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}}
\right)^{- 1}$$
The existence of F depends on the sum matrix Σxx^H^ being rank 2. Recall now
that 'x~k~' is the train of constellation symbols per SC, for both layers, as
embedded in the train of OFDM symbols. For pseudo-random data, the sum matrix
Σxx^H^ accumulates positive values along the diagonal, and random zero-mean
values in off diagonal locations (cross correlation across independent data).
As the number of OFDM symbols increases in the averaging interval, this matrix
tends towards a multiple of an identity matrix. Could this matrix be rank 1 in
some corner case? Mathematically, this can happen only if 'x' is the same
(both layers) in a SC for all OFDM symbols in the averaging interval. This
outcome is extremely improbable if not impossible due to reliance on
scramblers and standardized pseudo-random data generators in the UE. One can
therefore conclude that F exists if the TE can merely work out 'x~k~'. Since
the TE estimates 'x~k~' by decoding measured data (see figure 2.2.1-1), the TE
still depends on the UE's ability to transmit data with enough inter-layer
isolation to allow reconstruction. If F does not exist or is ill conditioned,
it must mean that the UE is unable to maintain valid 2L UL.
The invertibility of 'F' depends on the invertibility of the cross-correlation
term Σyx^H^ in the expression for 'F':
$$\sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{\text{.x}}}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}
= H.\left(
\text{GW.}\sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{\text{.x}}}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}
+
\sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{\text{.x}}}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}
\right)$$
The first term inside the parenthesis (GWΣxx^H^) involves 2 unitary matrices
multiplied by a strongly diagonal matrix (as discussed in the section about
the existence of F), and so remains rank 2. The second term inside the
parenthesis (Σnx^H^) is a measure of correlation between noise and data
symbols.
'Noise' can be truly thermal (low output power cases) in which case the second
term would tend towards an all-zero matrix and can be ignored. We can
therefore conclude that in low output power cases, Σyx^H^ is rank 2 (i.e it is
invertible) if H is also rank 2. Now, H contains information about the UE
antenna's cross-pol isolation: H is strongly rank 2 for UE implementations
with good cross-pol isolation. H loses rank or becomes ill-conditioned if the
UE's transmit chains suffer from high antenna correlation. If F is not
invertible or is ill conditioned, the reason can be traced back to the UE's
inability to maintain valid 2L UL.
Alternatively, the 'noise' can be composed of third order non-linearity from a
PA. This is the case for high output power cases. A PA can be approximated by
the time domain normalized characteristic shown here (_k~3~_ > 0):
$$v_{o} = v_{i} - k_{3}.{v_{i}.\left| v_{i} \right|}^{2}$$
The cubic term retains strong correlation with the linear term, so the PA
model's cubic term output can be approximated as sum of a correlated component
('_a.x_ ', where 'a' is related to the correlation coefficient of the cubic
term to the linear term) and an un-correlated component ('_n~un~_ '). In the
post-FFT frequency domain, Σyx^H^ can be rewritten as:
$$\sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{\text{.x}}}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}
= H.\left(
\text{GW.}\sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{\text{.x}}}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}
-
\alpha.k_{3}.\sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{\text{.x}}}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}
+
\sum_{k}^{}{{\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{\text{un}}}}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{\text{.x}}}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}
\right)$$
We focus on the matrix inside the parenthesis:
$$B = \left(
\text{GW.}\sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{\text{.x}}}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}
-
\alpha.k_{3}.\sum_{k}^{}{\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{\text{.x}}}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}
+
\sum_{k}^{}{{\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{\text{un}}}}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{\text{.x}}}_{\mathbf{k}}^{\mathbf{H}}
\right)$$
The third term inside the parenthesis is a measure of correlation between data
and the un-correlated component, which (by definition) would tend towards an
all-zero matrix and can be ignored, like the low output power case. There is
still risk of Σyx^H^ losing rank and becoming non-invertible, however, for
example if the matrix (GW-a.k~3~.I) loses rank.
Note that this mechanism (3^rd^ order nonlinearity) also exists in the case of
demodulation by TE with single chain receivers, and experience tells us that
PA non-linearity products do not contribute to a situation where the channel
cannot be inverted. Legacy demodulation procedures therefore serve as
empirical proof of the argument that the matrix (G.W-a.k~3~.I) never loses
rank.

### B.1.1.2 Uncertainty Contributions descriptions
#### B.1.1.2.1 DUT antenna location estimation
This contribution originates from estimating the phase centre of the active
antenna array and thus declaring the phase centre offset incorrectly in the
vendor declaration for the black&white-box approach. The factors included in
this uncertainty are the differences in path losses between the declare and
the actual offsets and the difference in compensated probe pattern. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution. This MU element is
applicable to CFFDNF&CFFNF methodologies with the black&white-box approach.
Additional background: This MU element was analysed in Clause 5.1.4.9.
#### B.1.1.2.2 Probe antenna pattern
The probe pattern is assumed to be known so that the measurement in the near
field can be corrected when the probe pattern needs to be compensated. There
is no direct dependence between the UE pattern and the probe pattern in near
field measurements. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution. This MU element is applicable to the CFFDNF&CFFNF methodologies.
Additional background: This MU element is similar to the 'A3-14 Probe pattern
knowledge' of the Near Field Test Range in TR 37.941 and should be considered
0 since the probe pattern can readily be measured.
#### B.1.1.2.3 EIRP measurement error [in NF]{.underline}
The cause of this uncertainty contributor is due to the reduction of distance
between the measurement antenna and the DUT from Far-Field to Near-Field. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution. This MU element is
applicable to the CFFDNF, CFFNF, and CFFdeltaNF methodologies. This MU
element, if a non-insignificant mean error was identified, shall also be
listed under System Uncertainties.
Additional background: This MU element was analysed in Clauses 5.1.4.4,
5.1.4.5, 5.1.4.6, 5.1.4.8.
For the CFFdeltaNF methodology, there is an additional impact due to changes
in antenna pattern caused by PA non-linearities, etc. which is FFS.
Additional background: This effect was analysed in Clause 5.1.4.8.
#### B.1.1.2.4 TRP measurement error [in NF]{.underline}
This contribution originates from calculating the Total Radiated Power based
on EIRP measurements in the NF. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution. This MU element is applicable to the CFFDNF methodology.
**Additional background:** This MU element was analysed in Clause 5.1.4.4.
#### B.1.1.2.5 Near-field interaction between probe antenna and DUT antenna
This uncertainty term is related to the coupling between the UE antenna and
the measurement antenna in the near field at different distances. This
uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of the DUT when at
different distance from the probe. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution. This MU element is applicable to the CFFDNF&CFFNF
methodologies.
Additional background: This MU element is similar to the 'A3-15 Multiple
Reflections' MU element of the Near Field Test Range in TR 37.941 and can be
assumed to be 0 but needs to be evaluated for each system separately.
#### B.1.1.2.6 Influence of power measurement uncertainty
This contribution originates from relative power measurement uncertainties at
different radii when applied to the asymptotic expansion transformation. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution. This MU element is
applicable to the CFFNF methodology.
**Additional background:** This MU element was analysed in Clause 5.1.4.7.
#### B.1.1.2.7 Influence of noise
This contributor describes an offset uncertainty factor caused by a noise
floor especially in a case of low SNR. This contributor works as a bias to
measured results only to a direction to increase values and thus this shall be
included in the uncertainty budget table as a systematic uncertainty. The
uncertainty value can be derived by the following equation for CFFDNF and
CFFdeltaNF.
$$Influence\ of\ noise = 10*log(1 + 10^{\left( - \frac{\text{SNR}}{10}
\right)})$$
For the CFFNF methodology, the asymptotic expansion approach requires EIRP
measurements of two (black&white-box) or three different radii (black-box
approach) and thus different SNR conditions for each EIRP measurement. The
influence of noise MU therefore requires an AWGN analyses with those varying
SNR conditions applied to the signals.
The available SNR for the CFFDNF and CFFNF methodologies must take the
reduction in free-space path losses due to measurements in the near field and
the reduction of relaxations into account while making sure that the available
SNR is above 6dB.
Additional background: This MU element was analysed in Clause 5.1.4.8
### B.1.1.3 Uncertainty assessment
FFS
## B.1.2 Polarization basis mismatch between the TE and DUT
For TPMI-based test method for EIRP measurement, the fixed TPMI index is used
to configure the UE to ensure 1 layer 2 port transmission. The test setup and
test procedure keep unchanged, thus no additional MU is identified for this
enhanced test method.
## B.1.3 Inter-band (FR2+FR2) CA
For IFF-based off-focus test system defined in Clause 5.3, the Quality of
quiet zone (QoQZ) will be impacted by both the main antenna and of the offset
antenna. The preliminary QoQZ difference is analysed to present the
measurement uncertainty induced by the off-focus test system.
The difference between the QoQZ of main antenna and of the offset antenna is
summarized in Table B.1.3-1 and plotted in Figure B.1.3-1. Note that these
values are specific to the feed antenna (amplitude taper) in this experiment
and thus they may vary depending on an antenna pattern used by each test
equipment vendor.

## B.1.4 Test system for ETC
The ETC test method has been defined in Clause 5.4. The ETC test system will
increase measurement uncertainty compared with NTC test system. For MOP-EIRP
and REFSENS-EIS, the comparison of the MU under NTC and ETC is summarized in
the table B.1.4-1.

Whether the recommended ±[4]ºC temperature tolerance limit of FR2 ETC system
defined in clause 5.4.4 would introduce additional MU or not, is FFS.
## B.1.5 Measurement uncertainty budget for FR2-2 test methods
Editor's note: based on the approved SID, the preliminary MU assessment for
52.6GHz should be added.
