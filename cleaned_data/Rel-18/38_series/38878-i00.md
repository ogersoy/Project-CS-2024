# 4 Advanced receiver to cancel inter-user interference for MU-MIMO
## 4.1 Scenario and interference modelling
### 4.1.1 Scenario
MU-MIMO allows gNB to transmit data to multiple UEs in the same time-frequency
resources through spatial multiplexing. The process of selecting paired UEs is
called 'pairing'. As illustrated in Figure 4.1.1-1, UE1 and UE2 are paired and
gNB transmits data to both UEs with suitable precoders through the same time-
frequency resources. However, the gNB cannot guarantee the perfect pairing of
multiple users in the real network. The paired UEs may not perfectly spatially
orthogonal to each other and this will induce the intra-cell interference
between paired UEs.

Figure 4.1.1-1. gNB transmit data to paired UE1 and UE2 with the same time-
frequency resources
To evaluate the performance of UE with intra-cell interference induced by
spatial multiplexing, the following scenarios illustrated from Figure 4.1.1-2
to Figure 4.1.1-3 are considered for the case of number of paired UEs is 2.
Moreover, scenario illustrated in Figure 4.1.1-4 is considered for the case of
number of paired UEs is 3.
\- Target UE with single DMRS antenna port:
\- Scenario 1: Number of CDM group without data is 1
\- AP1000 for target UE, AP1001 for interference UE
\- Target UE with two DMRS antenna ports:
\- Scenario 2: Number of CDM group without data is 2
\- AP1000 and 1001 for target UE, AP1002 and 1003 for interference UE
\- Target UE with single DMRS antenna port:
\- Scenario 3: Number of CDM group without data is 1
\- AP1000 for target UE, AP1001 for 2 interference UEs with different
frequency domain allocation.

### 4.1.2 Interference model
The PDSCH of the co-scheduled UE consists of QAM modulated uncoded random
bits. The modulation order of PDSCH of paired UEs can be selected
independently. The DMRS sequences of paired UEs are assumed to be known for
channel estimation purposes for all paired UEs. Note that the DMRS scrambling
sequences of paired UEs are assumed to be the same to guarantee orthogonality.
The PDSCH and DMRS of the paired UEs are precoded prior to transmission. The
precoder for each user is denoted by $\mathbf{W}_{1}^{'}$ and
$\mathbf{W}_{2}^{'}$ respectively.
In the scope of this technical report $\mathbf{W}_{i}\ $is the precoder matrix
of i^th^ UE, of size N~TX~ x N~Li~ from Type I single panel codebook as
described in [3GPP TS 38.214]. Where, N~TX~ is the number of TX antenna, N~Li~
is the number of layers from i^th^ UE. The combined precoder $\mathbf{W\ = \
\lbrack W}_{1}\ \mathbf{W}_{2}\rbrack$, of size N~TX~ x N~L~ where, N~L~ is
the total number layers across all users. In general, other codebooks are also
valid for MU-MIMO scenarios with advanced receiver.
The precoder of the target UE $\mathbf{W}_{1}$ is randomly selected. For the
co-scheduled UE, the precoder $\mathbf{W}_{2}$ is selected in one of the two
ways below.
\- Orthogonal precoder: $\mathbf{W}_{2}$ is randomly selected from the
codebook with a constraint that the combined precoder **W** has orthogonal
columns, i.e., the off-diagonal entries of **W^H^W** are zero.
\- Random precoder: $\mathbf{W}_{2}$ is randomly selected from the codebook
ensuring any column of $\mathbf{W}_{2}$ is not identical to any column of
$\mathbf{W}_{1}$
To maintain the average per UE signal power as N~Li~ /N~L,~ an additional
scaling is applied to the each precoder as:
$\mathbf{ }\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{i}}^{\mathbf{'}} = \
\sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{Li}}}{N_{L}}}*\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{i}}$
## 4.2 Receiver structure
### 4.2.1 General
In this clause, we provide the receiver structure to mitigate the intra-cell
inter-user interference.
The N~Rx~-dimensional received signal vector **r** of the $k$-th subcarrier
and the $l$-th OFDM symbol is assumed to be expressed as a sum of target's UE
own signal $\mathbf{H}_{1}\left( k,l \right)\mathbf{d}_{1}\left( k,l \right)$,
and co-scheduled UEs' interference signals $\mathbf{H}_{j}\left( k,l
\right)\mathbf{d}_{j}\left( k,l \right)$ (j>1) and the white noise
$\mathbf{n}(k,l)$;
$$\mathbf{r}\left( k,\ l \right) = \ \mathbf{H}_{1}\left( k,l
\right)\mathbf{d}_{1}\left( k,l \right) + \sum_{j =
2}^{N_{\text{UE}}}{\mathbf{H}_{j}\left( k,l \right)\mathbf{d}_{j}\left( k,l
\right)} + \mathbf{n}(k,l)$$
Where,
> $\mathbf{d}_{j}\left( k,l \right)$ and $\mathbf{H}_{j}\left( k,l \right),\ j
> = { 2,\ldots N_{\text{UE}}}$ represent the N~layer,j~ x1 transmitted signal
> vector and the (N~Rx~ x N~layer,j~) channel matrix between the _j_ -th co-
> scheduled UE's interference and the UE containing the contribution from
> receiver branches, with $\mathbf{H}_{j} = \begin{bmatrix}
> {(\mathbf{H}_{j,1})}^{H} \ {(\mathbf{H}_{j,2})}^{H} \ \end{bmatrix}$ for two
> receiver antennas and $\mathbf{H}_{j} = \begin{bmatrix} \begin{matrix}
> {(\mathbf{H}_{j,1})}^{H} \ {(\mathbf{H}_{j,2})}^{H} \ \end{matrix} \
> \begin{matrix} {(\mathbf{H}_{j,3})}^{H} \ {(\mathbf{H}_{j,4})}^{H} \
> \end{matrix} \ \end{bmatrix}$ for four receiver antennas, where,
> $\mathbf{H}_{j,i}$ channel-matrix of size N~layer,j~ x1 for the _i_ -th
> receiver antenna, respectively.
>
> $N_{\text{UE}}$ is the number of paired UEs.
### 4.2.2 E-MMSE IRC receiver
To suppress the co-scheduled UE's interference, the candidate E-MMSE IRC
receiver type is captured in this subclause. The E-MMSE IRC receiver weight
matrix is expressed as follow:
$\mathbf{W}_{\text{RX},1}\left( k,l \right) =
{\widehat{\mathbf{H}}}_{1}^{H}(k,l)\mathbf{R}^{- 1}$
$\mathbf{R}\mathbf{= \ }P_{\mathbf{1}}{\widehat{\mathbf{H}}}_{1}\left( k,l
\right){\widehat{\mathbf{H}}}_{1}^{H}\left( k,l \right) +
P_{\mathbf{j}}\sum_{j = 2}^{N_{\text{UE}}}{{\widehat{\mathbf{H}}}_{j}\left(
k,l \right){\widehat{\mathbf{H}}}_{j}^{H}\left( k,l \right)} +
\frac{1}{N_{\text{re}}}\sum_{k,l \in \text{DMRS}\ \text{of}\
N_{\text{UE}}}^{}{\widetilde{\mathbf{r}}(k,l){\widetilde{\mathbf{r}}(k,l)}^{H}}$,
$\widetilde{\mathbf{r}}\left( k,l \right) = \mathbf{r}\left( k,\ l \right) -
\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{\text{UE}}}{{\widehat{\mathbf{H}}}_{j}\left( k,l
\right)\mathbf{d}_{j}\left( k,l \right)}$ .
> Where,
${\widehat{\mathbf{H}}}_{j}^{H}\left( k,l \right)$and$\mathbf{d}_{j}(k,l)$
denote the estimated channel matrix and the transmit signal of all UE's DMRS
symbols, respectively, where the estimated channel matrix is also based on
DMRS.
$N_{\text{re}}$ is the number of sampling REs of intra-user's DMRS.
_P~j~_ is the power of _j-_ th UE.
### 4.2.3 R-ML receiver
ML receiver performs joint maximum likelihood detection of the useful and co-
scheduled UE signals considering the constellations of both signals:
# $\mathbf{r}\left( k,\ l \right) = \ \mathbf{H}_{1}\left( k,l
\right)\mathbf{d}_{1}\left( k,l \right) + \sum_{j =
2}^{N_{\text{UE}}}{\mathbf{H}_{j}\left( k,l \right)\mathbf{d}_{j}\left( k,l
\right)} + \mathbf{n}\left( k,l \right)$
$=$[$\mathbf{H}_{1}\left( k,l \right)\mathbf{H}_{2}\left( k,l \right)\ldots\
\mathbf{H}_{N_{\text{UE}}}\left( k,l \right)$]$\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{d}_{1}\left( k,l \right) \ \mathbf{d}_{2}\left( k,l \right) \
\begin{matrix} \vdots \ \mathbf{d}_{N_{\text{UE}}}\left( k,l \right) \
\end{matrix} \ \end{bmatrix} + \mathbf{n}\left( k,l \right)$
So the ML receiver can be rewritten as
$$\underset{{\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }d}_{j} \in
S}{{\widehat{d}}_{\text{ML}} = argmin}\left\| \mathbf{r}\left( k,l \right) -
\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{\text{UE}}}{\mathbf{H}_{j}\left( k,l
\right)\mathbf{d}_{j}\left( k,l \right)} \right\|^{2}$$
Where,
$\left\| \cdot \right\|$ denotes the $l_{2}$-norm of a vector.
$\mathbf{r}\left( k,\ l \right)$ is the received signal vector.
$\mathbf{H}_{j}\left( k,l \right)\ $is the channel matrix over target and
interference layers for a RE at frequency location _k_ and symbol _l_.
_S_ is the set of all possible transmitted signal vectors across target and
interference spatial layers.
Reduced complexity ML ([R-ML]{.underline}):
Reduced complexity joint detection of useful and interference modulation
symbols in accordance to the ML criterion (e.g. sphere decoding, QR-MLD, MLM,
etc.).

# 5 Conclusions
This technical report has documented the RAN4 evaluation on techniques to
cancel downlink intra cell inter-user interference. The major work includes
the determination of network scenario, interference modelling, interference
suppressing receiver structure, required information analysis for each
candidate receiver, link-level simulation parameters and performance
evaluations.
MU-MIMO scenario with gNB transmits PDSCH to the paired UEs through the same
time-frequency resources is evaluated.
gNBs equipped with 2Tx and 4Tx antennas are considered in the RAN4 performance
evaluation. However, for the UEs capable of inter-user interference
suppression ability discussed in this TR, they can also be used in the
deployments with larger number of Tx ports configuration. For the interference
suppressing receiver, both E-MMSE-IRC and R-ML are evaluated as candidate
advanced receivers.
RAN4 reaches consensus on the required information for both E-IRC and R-ML
receiver. In addition, RAN4 has agreed the network default configuration
assumptions. Therefore, the advanced receiving algorithm can be performed
under these default assumptions. For some of the default assumptions, it is
required for the network to indicate the UE whether the default assumption is
valid or not by RRC signalling. For UE with R-ML receiver, DCI based network
assistant signalling is required.
PDSCH link-level simulations are performed to evaluate the performance gain of
the candidate E-IRC and R-ML receiver over the baseline MMSE-IRC receiver
under intra-cell inter-user interference scenario. 16 simulation cases that
covers the advanced receiver with genie-aided required information, with co-
scheduled UE DMRS port and FDRA information blind detection, and with co-
scheduled UE modulation order blind detection (for R-ML receiver only), are
selected for the evaluation. Different antenna and rank configurations for
target and interference UEs, different propagation condition, and CBW
configurations are included.
Based on the simulation results, the performance gain of R-ML receiver over
the baseline MMSE-IRC receiver is verified.
Based on the above evaluations, it is recommended to select _R-ML_ as the new
advanced receiver for inter-user interference suppression receiver for MU-MIMO
scenario in Rel-18, and to introduce necessary new UE capability and network
assistant signalling for the selected receiver.
It is also recommended to define NR PDSCH demodulation requirements for the
selected inter-user interference suppression receiver for MU-MIMO scenario in
Rel-18.
