# 1 Scope
The present document captures the findings from the study item of \"Study on
network energy savings for NR\" [2].
The study includes how to model network energy consumption especially for a
base station, and evaluations of network energy saving gains as well as impact
to network and user performance, by reusing existing KPI whenever applicable
or new KPIs as needed. The study is also to identify techniques on gNB and UE
side that can improve the network energy savings in various domains,
potentially with UE feedback/assistance information and information exchange
over network interfaces.
The study prioritizes **idle/empty and low/medium load scenarios, allow
different loads among carriers and neighbor cells, allows legacy UEs to be
able to continue accessing a network implementing Rel-18 network energy

# 4 Introduction
Network energy saving is of great importance for environmental sustainability,
to reduce environmental impact (greenhouse gas emissions), and for operational
cost savings. As 5G is becoming pervasive across industries and geographical
areas, handling more advanced services and applications requiring very high
data rates (e.g. XR), networks are being denser, use more antennas, larger
bandwidths and more frequency bands. The environmental impact of 5G needs to
stay under control, and novel solutions to improve network energy savings need
to be developed.
Energy consumption has become a key part of the operators\' OPEX. According to
the report from GSMA [3], the energy cost on mobile networks accounts for
\~23% of the total operator cost. Most of the energy consumption comes from
the radio access network and in particular from the AAU, with data centres and
fibre transport accounting for a smaller share. The power consumption of a
radio access can be split into two parts: the dynamic part which is only
consumed when data transmission/reception is ongoing, and the static part
which is consumed all the time to maintain the necessary operation of the
radio access devices, even when the data transmission/reception is not on-
going.
Therefore, there is a need to study and develop a network energy consumption
model especially for the base station (a UE power consumption model was
already defined in TR38.840), KPIs, an evaluation methodology and to identify
and study network energy savings techniques in targeted deployment scenarios.
The study investigates how to achieve more efficient operation dynamically
and/or semi-statically and finer granularity adaptation of transmissions
and/or receptions in one or more of network energy saving techniques in time,
frequency, spatial, and power domains, with potential support/feedback from
UE, potential UE assistance information, and information exchange/coordination
over network interfaces.
The study not only evaluates the potential network energy consumption gains,
but also assesses and balances the impact on network and user performance,
e.g. by looking at KPIs such as spectral efficiency, capacity, UPT, latency,
UE power consumption, complexity, handover performance, call drop rate,
initial access performance, SLA assurance related KPIs, etc. The techniques
studied could avoid having a large impact to such KPIs.
# 5 Modeling and evaluation methodology
## 5.1 Energy consumption model for BS
For evaluation purpose, the energy consumption modeling for a BS for
evaluation includes:
\- Reference configuration
\- Multiple power state(s) including sleep or non-sleep modes with relative
power, and associated transition time/energy
\- Scaling method to be applied.
For reference configuration, the following is considered for single CC case.
Table 5.1-1: Reference configuration for BS power consumption model
                                                                                                                     Set 1 FR1   Set 2 FR1   Set 3 FR2

dBm 49 dBm 33 dBm* Total number of UL Rx RUs 64 32 2 *Note: EIRP limit is 63
dBm for the reference configuration. The EIRP value is scaled with the number
of TxRUs.
For power states, for non-sleep mode and TDD, the BS power consumption for DL
and UL are separately modelled, allowing DL-only transmission or UL-only
reception. The relative power value in power consumption model tables for UL
reception and/or DL transmission is provided based on the reference
configurations. For simultaneous DL and UL transmission for FDD, the power for
UL reception is neglected in this study.
The power states of power consumption model are provided as Table 5.1-2. Note:
The BS power model defined in this study is a simplified model for the
purposes of evaluations, considering single-RAT NR BSs only. This does not
mean a BS cannot benefit from the identified techniques when serving multi-
RAT. Transition among power states, transition time, are implementation
specific, and different BS types may support a different number of power
states with different characteristics, i.e., power consumption values and
required transition time.
During the transition time period, relative power of sleep mode _i_ is assumed
to be consumed. For RAN1 evaluation purpose, the values of relative power
**_P_** for BS Category 1 and BS Category 2 for respective set of reference
configurations are provided in Table 5.1-3.
Additional transition energy **_E_** and total transition time _T_ also
include energy and time for both ramping down and ramping up. The values of
total transition time for BS power state transition are given in Table 5.1-4,
which are the same across different sets of reference configurations for a
given BS Category. The values of additional transition energy for reference
configuration Set 1, Set 2 and Set 3, with unit in (relative power) *
(duration in msec), are provided in Table 5.1-5.
For background and discussion related to the power models as well as the
corresponding values for relative power, transition time and additional
transition energy, see [4][5][6][7] and references therein.

For scaling method, for non-sleep mode, the scaling can be based on one or
more of the following:
\- number of used physical antenna elements, or TX/RX RUs
\- occupied BW/RBs for DL and/or UL in a slot/symbol in one CC
\- number of CCs in CA
\- number of TRPs
\- PSD or transmit power
\- number of DL and/or UL symbols occupied within a slot.
For active DL transmission, the BS power consumption is provided by
$$P^{\text{DL}} = P_{\text{static}}^{\text{DL}} +
P_{\text{dynamic}}^{\text{DL}}$$
where
\- $P_{\text{static}}^{\text{DL}}$ is a static part of power for BS in active,
which is not scaled based on reference configurations.
\- Baseline: $P_{\text{static}}^{\text{DL}} = P_{3}$
\- Optional: $P_{\text{static}}^{\text{DL}} = 1.5*P_{3}$
\- $P_{\text{dynamic}}^{\text{DL}}$ is a dynamic part of power for BS in
active, which is scaled based on reference configuration.
\- Baseline: ${P_{\text{dynamic}}^{\text{DL}} = s}_{a}_\left(
P_{\text{dyn},\text{ante}} + \frac{s_{f}{_ s}_{p}}{\eta\left( s_{f}{,\ \
s}_{p} \right)}*P_{\text{dyn},\text{joint}} \right)$, where $s_{a}$,$\
s_{f}$,$\ s_{p}$ is the fraction of active TRxRUs, the ratio between the RF
bandwidth and the maximum system BW, and the ratio of PSD per TxRU between the
DL transmission and reference configuration, respectively.
$$\left{ \begin{matrix} \mathbf{\&}P_{\text{dyn},\text{ante}} = \ \mathbf{A
_}{(P_{4} - P}_{\text{static}}^{\text{DL}}) \ \mathbf{\
&}P_{\text{dyn},\text{joint}}/\eta\left( s_{f} = 1{,\ s}_{p} = 1 \right) = \
(1 - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{\ _}{(P_{4} - P}_{\text{static}}^{\text{DL}}) \
\end{matrix} \right.\ $$
\- $P_{\text{dyn},\text{joint}}/\eta\left( s_{f}{,\ \ s}_{p} \right)$ _is the
power part related to PA._
_\- For simplicity_
\- A = baseline: 0.4; optional: 0.1, 0.7;
_\- For_ $\eta\left( s_{f}{,\ \ s}_{p} \right)$_, in evaluation, company to
report the assumption from below:_
> _\- If one value of_ $\eta\left( s_{f}{,\ \ s}_{p} \right)$_is used for
> evaluation,_ $\eta\left( s_{f}{,\ \ s}_{p} \right) = 1$ for any $s_{f}{,\ \
> s}_{p}$;
>
> _\- If two values of_ $\eta\left( s_{f}{,\ \ s}_{p} \right)$_are used for
> evaluation,_ $\eta\left( s_{f}{,\ \ s}_{p} \right) = 0.76$_if_
> $s_{f}{_s}_{p}  1.$
For active UL transmission, the BS power consumption for is provided by
$$P^{\text{UL}} = P_{\text{static}}^{\text{UL}} +
P_{\text{dynamic}}^{\text{UL}}$$
where
\- $P_{\text{static}}^{UL}$ is a static part of power for BS in active, which
is not scaled based on reference configurations.
\- $P_{\text{dynamic}}^{\text{UL}} = {s_{a}*P}_{dyn,ante}^{\text{UL}}$ is a
dynamic part of power for BS in active, which is scaled based on reference
configuration, and $s_{a}$ is the fraction of active TRxRUs.
\- Baseline:
\- $P_{\text{static}}^{\text{UL}} = P_{3}\ $
\- $P_{\text{dyn},\text{ante}}^{\text{UL}} = P_{5} - P_{3}$ when no scaling is
applied (i.e. scaling factor is 1).
Note,
\- For multi-carrier, the total power consumption of BS is calculated as is
the sum of the power consumption of each CC; for intra-band multi-carrier with
contiguous CCs, the power consumption of each additional CC is scaled by 0.7.
\- For multi-TRP, the total power consumption of BS is assumed as is the sum
of the power consumption of each TRP. Company to report whether
$P_{\text{static}}$ is shared among TRPs (if shared, $P_{\text{static}}$ is
accounted once).
\- Company to additionally report the assumption for antenna adaptation delay,
e.g. immediate adaptation, or with a transition time of 1-3 ms, etc.
\- In time domain, the power consumption in a slot is the sum of the power
consumption associated with symbols in the slot. The symbol may correspond to
uplink symbol, downlink symbol, or symbol without uplink and downlink. Company
to report how the summation is performed along with evaluation results.
Other values for the above scaling formula, and other scaling approaches can
be optionally reported, including
\- $P_{\text{DL}} = P_{4}\left( 0.4 + 0.6 _s_{f}_ s_{p}_\eta\left( s_{f}{,\ \
s}_{p} \right) \right)\left( 0.4 + 0.6_ s_{a} \right)\text{.\ }$At least
$\eta\left( s_{f}{,\ \ s}_{p} \right)$= 1 is supported.
\- $P_{\text{UL}}\mathbf{=}P_{5}\ (0.8 + \ 0.2 _s_{f})(0.4 + \ 0.6_ s_{a})$,
with $s_{f}$ being the ratio of RF BW to the maximum system BW.
## 5.2 Evaluation methodology
For evaluation, the BS energy consumption model at least include the power
consumption of BS on slot-level, and symbol-level power consumption to reflect
different BW (or RB utilization)/time-occupancy/tx-rx direction of different
symbols in a slot is considered. System simulation evaluations can be per slot
regardless of detailed approach for calculating symbol-level power
consumption. All calculation of energy consumption is to use the same time
unit. Companies are to indicate which time unit is used.
The evaluation baseline includes at least NR R15 mandatory without capability
features. Optional features from R15 onwards (e.g. CA, MIMO) as well as
implementation-based energy saving techniques are to be explicitly reported
and described if used in the evaluation baseline.
SLS is considered as baseline evaluation method. Other method, including
numerical analysis and LLS can also be considered. At least one of the methods
is to be selected and used for evaluation of a specific technique (selection
and criteria is up to proponent).
For evaluation purpose, network energy saving gain is computed based on the
energy consumptions for a technique and the baseline over the same duration.
Percentage of energy consumption reduction from the baseline is used to
express BS energy saving gain. In addition to the BS energy saving gain, at
least UPT/UE power consumption/access delay/latency is to be considered for
performance impact evaluation. Other KPIs can be optionally reported,
conditioned with clear definition/descriptions provided. Note for potential
new channel/signals, e.g. WUS from UE, the assumption for detection
reliability at BS side is to be reported (performance and complexity impact
would subject to results and further discussion).
For initial evaluations, there is always a non-sleep mode assumed between
adjacent sleep modes.
System level evaluation assumptions are provided in Annex A and B.
Companies are to report the assumption details for the reception of a low-
power UL channel/signal, if used, including power states, additional
transition energy, and transition times, receiver details (e.g. architecture
and receiver sensitivity), and other impact/change on the power consumption
model.
# 6 Techniques to improve network energy savings
Various techniques in time, frequency, spatial and power domains are studied.
Companies\' simulation results as well as evaluation assumption details are
gathered in [8]. In this document, results as well as some notable assumptions
and setting are explicitly present in relevant tables. Also, the
categorization of techniques in terms of technical domain and results
presentation/tabulation are for study/evaluation purpose. This does not
preclude to further merge or combine certain techniques.
For analysis of impact on legacy UE and RAN1 specification, the list described
in corresponding clauses is not an exhaustive list. RAN1 may identify
additional impact and determine that the listed impact may no longer apply to
the described technique(s) as specification is further developed.
## 6.1 Techniques in time domain
### 6.1.1 Technique A-1 Adapting transmission/reception of common
channels/signals
#### 6.1.1.1 Description of technique
In Rel-15 NR, time-domain positions of transmitted SSBs within a half frame
are semi-statically configured. Further, UE assumes a single periodicity for
the transmitted SSBs. The transmission of common signal and channels or
reception of random-access signals may limit the gNB ability to use (deeper)
sleep modes to save energy. Currently, system information (SI) update
mechanism can adapt the parameters in the cell, such as those associated with
downlink common and broadcast signals, such as SSB/SI/paging/cell common
PDCCH, and/or the periodicity/availability of uplink random access resources.
Technique A-1 adapts the transmission pattern (when applicable) of downlink
common and broadcast signals, such as SSB/SI/paging/cell common PDCCH, and/or
the transmission pattern/availability of uplink random access opportunities.
Adaptation of the transmission pattern includes changes to periodicity, time
resource locations, and omitting of specific signals/channels. The
transmission pattern can be adapted semi-statically or dynamically.
#### 6.1.1.2 Analysis of NW energy saving and performance impact
The following table captures the simulation results for the technique A-1-1
that use simplified version of SSB, such as only PSS, only PSS and SSS without
PBCH, or PSS and SSS with partial PBCH.
Based on the simulation results, at empty load, one source shows that BS
energy saving gain can be achieved by 15.7%\~28.3% with only PSS and SSS
transmitted from SSB, and half-reduced SIB1 transmission. One source shows
that the gain from light SSB only ranges from 0.7% to 4.4%, which slightly
increases as the listening periodicity of WUS from UE becomes larger. One
source shows that with simplified SSB of PSS, SSS and partial PBCH, for empty
load and Set 1 reference configuration, 2.4% BS energy savings can be
achieved. One source shows 30.49% BS energy savings with 2-symbol simplified
SSB for FR2.
No impact on UPT was observed due to empty load.

The following table captures the simulation results for the technique A-1-2 by
which transmission occasion of one or more common signals/channels, which are
SIB1 and SSB based on the submitted results, can be skipped.
Based on the results,
\- One source observed that statically skipping certain SIB1 transmission
occasions under Set 1 reference configuration for BS Category 1 can achieve
energy saving gain by 2.6%\~3.9% compared to the baseline of 20ms SSB&SIB1
repetition periodicity at low load. No impact to UPT was observed. There is no
random-access procedure modelled in the simulation, therefore the impact on
access delay/latency is not shown.
\- One source observed that static adaptation of number of SSB can achieve
energy saving gain by 0.3%\~25.4% at different scenarios with FTP3 model. The
gain generally increases when the traffic load becomes lighter while decreases
as the SSB periodicity becomes larger. For a same traffic load and SSB
periodicity, the gain increases as the number of SSB can be reduced. For FR2
with larger number of SSB for baseline, there is generally larger gain
observed than FR1. Due to reduced number of SSB, access delay is increased.
Performance of dynamic adaptation of SSB numbers is not provided. There is no
random-access procedure modelled in the simulation, therefore the impact on
access delay/latency is not shown.

The following show the BS energy savings by technique A-1-3, i.e.
configuration/adaptation of longer periodicity of common signals and/or uplink
random access opportunities.
Based on the results with static configurations from 9 sources, it can be
observed that longer SSB/SIB1 periodicity can bring BS with significant energy
savings in most cases (with gains up to 84.8%), compared to a selected
baseline, for both BS Categories, under all reference configurations. When
other configurations/settings are the same, the saving gain generally increase
as the periodicity becomes larger, and decrease as the traffic load increases
or the number of SSBs increases. Particularly, there are two sources providing
results with SSB periodicity larger than 160ms which is the maximum value that
is currently supported, i.e., being 640ms and 1280ms, and observed that
together with longer SIB1/RACH/RO monitoring periodicities, then depending on
the traffic load, the BS energy saving gain can be 53.6%\~7.1% and
83.6%\~3.4%, respectively, compared to a baseline with 20ms SSB periodicity.
The scheme does not affect the UPT for empty load case. When traffic occurs
and load increases, the UPT also significantly decreases. The latency/access
delay/UE power consumption increases proportionally as the periodicity of
SSB/SIB increases compared to a corresponding baseline.
Performance of dynamic SSB/SIB1 periodicity adaptation is not provided.

The following show the BS energy savings by technique A-1-4,
configuration/adaptation of transmission patterns of common signals, i.e.
Paging or SSB based on the submitted results.
Based on the results,
\- One source observed that for BS category 1 and at empty load case,
statically adapting paging configuration could provide BS energy savings by
0.2%\~6.7% when paging load (resource used for paging) is 0.2%\~0.5%, and the
gain can be up to 42.3% when paging load is increased up to 3.6%. The gain
could also increase as the number of SSB increases. Performance of dynamically
adapting paging configurations is not provided. The above energy saving gains
were achieved with SSB periodicity of 80ms or 160ms.
\- One source observed that having compact SSB (i.e., no time gap between
consecutive SSBs) could provide 10.3% network energy saving for BS category 1
and at empty load case in FR2 when SSB periodicity is 20ms. Furthermore, UE
power saving can be improved by 4%.

The following show the BS energy savings by the technique A-1-5, adapting
common signals, i.e. RACH based on the submitted results.
Based on the results with multiple static RACH occasion configurations, one
source observed that adaptation of RACH occasions can achieve BS energy
savings by 14.4%\~24.9% for BS Category 1 at empty load case under FR1 TDD
compared to 10ms RACH periodicity without adaptation. The gain generally
increases as PRACH periodicity increases for the same number of SSBs.
Performance of dynamic RACH configuration is not provided.
On UPT/access delay/latency, this scheme increases access delay/latency from
10ms to 70ms, proportional to the increased PRACH periodicity.

The following show the BS energy savings by technique A-1-6, scheduling of
SIB1 by SSB, without PDCCH for SIB1, with repetition period 20ms.
It is observed by one source that using SSB to schedule SIB1 can obtain
4.8%\~14.8% BS energy savings for Set 1 reference configuration for BS
Category 1, compared to SSB/SIB1 periodicity of 20ms for both.

#### 6.1.1.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
The access latency of legacy UEs may be impacted.
Specification impact of the technique(s) may include the following.
For (technique A-1-1) simplified version of SSB, such as only PSS, only PSS
and SSS without PBCH, or PSS and SSS with partial PBCH:
\- signaling mechanism to inform the UE about the use of simplified version of
SSB, if needed,
\- changes to SSB may have impact on SI acquisition, initial access, RRM/RLM
measurements, and mobility for legacy UEs and UEs that may not support the
technique,
\- technique may be enabled for a carrier only when legacy UEs are not using
the carrier.
For (technique A-1-2) skipping of SSB/SIB1 transmission occasion:
\- signaling mechanism to inform the UE about the skipping of SSB/SIB
transmission occasions, if needed,
\- skipping of common signals and channels, such as SSB and SIB1, may have
impact on initial access, RRM/RLM/BM measurements, and performance for legacy
UEs and UEs that may not support the technique,
\- technique may be enabled for a carrier only when legacy UEs are not using
the carrier.
For (technique A-1-3) configuration/adaptation of longer periodicity of
SSB/SIB1 and/or uplink random access opportunities:
\- signaling mechanism to inform the UE about the configuration/adaptation,
\- adaption of common signals and channels may have impact on SI acquisition,
initial access, RRM/RLM/BM measurements, and performance for legacy UEs and
UEs that may not support the technique.
For (technique A-1-4) the paging enhancement where paging resources are
grouped in a compact manner, potential specification impact of the
enhancements from paging transmission includes the following:
\- paging reception procedure (RAN2), i.e., identification of POs and PFs for
Rel-18 UEs,
\- UEs that do not support the technique are expected to follow legacy paging
reception procedure in the cell.
For (technique A-1-5) dynamically adapting PRACH periodicity and occasions:
\- signaling mechanism to inform the UE about the RACH enhancement resources,
\- preparation procedure time for dynamic PRACH adaptation,
\- UEs that do not support the technique are expected to use legacy RACH
resources in the cell.
For (technique A-1-6) scheduling of SIB1 without PDCCH:
\- signaling mechanism to inform the UE about the use of SIB1 without PDCCH,
if needed,
\- changes to PDCCH of SIB1 may have impact on initial access, and system
information acquisition for legacy UEs and UEs that may not support the
technique,
\- the specification impacts may include signalling mechanism to inform the UE
about SIB1 transmissions, details of SI acquisition,
\- technique may be enabled for a carrier only when legacy UEs are not using
the carrier.
### 6.1.2 Technique A-2 Adaptation of UE specific signals and channels
#### 6.1.2.1 Description of technique
The semi-static configured UE specific channels/signals may require the gNB to
perform periodic transmission or reception if they are activated. Except for
positioning RS (PRS), the configurations for the listed UE-specific
signals/channels are BWP-specific. Current specification allows gNB to
dynamically activate/deactivate CG-PUSCH/SPS/CSI-RS/CSI report/SRS using DCI
(i.e., PDCCH transmission) in UE specific manner.
Technique A-2 aims to reduce or omit time occasions for the UE specific
resources during low activity/non-active periods of the cell. The potential
list of UE specific resources includes periodic/semi-static CSI-RS, group-
common/UE-specific PDCCH, SPS PDSCH, PUCCH carrying SR, PUCCH/PUSCH carrying
CSI reports, PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACK for SPS, CG-PUSCH, SRS, positioning RS
(PRS).
UEs may assist the network with information related to the traffic (e.g.,
about which resources are necessary or unnecessary) so that the network can
optimize its scheduling and achieve more sleep opportunities.
#### 6.1.2.2 Analysis of NW energy saving and performance impact
No evaluations of this technique are available.
#### 6.1.2.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
Reducing or omitting time occasions for the UE specific resources during low
activity/non-active periods of the cell are not expected to impact UEs that do
not support the technique.
Specification impact of the technique may include at least:
\- mechanisms to configure and/or inform UEs about the resource availability,
\- UE behavior and procedures when configuration and/or information of the
resource availability of cell is provided.
### 6.1.3 Technique A-3 UE wake up signal (WUS) for gNB
#### 6.1.3.1 Description of technique
Technique A-3 enables the UE to send an uplink wake-up signal to request
transitioning of a cell from no or reduced transmission/reception activity to
active transmission or reception of a channel/signal. The technique can be
applied to UEs in one or more RRC states. The UE wake up signal (WUS) by
technique A-3-1 may be used to trigger the SSB/SIB transmission. It can be
used to trigger SSB/SIB1 transmissions with technique A-5. It can also be used
to trigger gNB to wake up with technique A-4.
With the support of WUS, the gNB might be inactive (e.g., where it does not
transmit nor receive signal/channel or where it only transmits and receives
limited signals). A gNB can transit to become active for transmitting or
receiving a channel/signal upon reception of an uplink signal from the UE,
referred to as technique A-3-2.
#### 6.1.3.2 Analysis of NW energy saving and performance impact
The following capture the results for waking up gNB triggered by UE WUS.

For UE WUS triggering SSB/SIB1/RACH for RRC IDLE/INACTIVE/CONNECTED mode by
technique A-3-1, based on results from 4 sources, it is observed that, with UE
WUS signal triggering a BS of 100% detection assumption,
\- With C-DRX, at low load, one source observed about 50% network energy
savings with marginal UE power increment, without UPT loss observed. The
scheduling delay when switching to a new gNB is not modelled.
\- For the evaluations with assumption of RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE mode without
C-DRX,
\- without DL transmission including DL common signals before gNB reception of
WUS, with WUS period of 20ms, 80ms and 160ms, at zero or low load, the network
energy savings could be 7.4%\~32.1% (6.2%\~45.6%), 19.6%\~69.6% (6.4%\~51.9%),
23.8%\~ 83.7% (6.5%\~52.5%) respectively by using Category 1 (Category 2) BS
power model. The savings can increase as the WUS period increases, and
decrease as the traffic load increases. When WUS period is 20ms, marginal UPT
loss, access delay/latency increment and UE power consumption increment are
observed. The UPT loss and access delay/latency increases as WUS periodicity
increases, while there is marginal UE power consumption increment.
\- With sparse SSB of 160ms periodicity transmitted before gNB reception of
WUS, at zero or low load, 27.3%\~29.7% (18.1%\~19.1%), 60.4%\~66.6%
(18.3%\~19.4%), 72.8%\~80.7% (18.3%\~19.4%) network energy savings can be
achieved with WUS period of 20ms, 80ms and 160ms respectively by using
Category 1 (Category 2) BS power model. When WUS period is 20ms, marginal UPT
loss, access delay/latency increment and UE power consumption increment are
observed. The UPT loss and access delay/latency increases as WUS periodicity
increases, while there is marginal UE power consumption increment.
\- Note: gNB coordination for WUS reception is assumed. Resource configuration
for WUS is not specifically modelled, while one source assumes the
configuration of WUS can be obtained from a camping cell. For the case of no
DL transmission, gNB synchronization is further assumed.
\- Note: For evaluation results from 2 sources, it is assumed that UE achieves
timing for the UL WUS transmission from the other cell. For evaluation results
from 2 sources, it is assumed that UE achieves synchronization with the gNB
targeting for energy saving by utilizing discovery signal from the same cell,
and one source assumed the discovery signal contains PSS only and its use is
to help the UE to get synchronized and to be able to transmit an uplink
triggering signal. The differentiation of multiple gNBs which have detected
the WUS is not modelled.
\- The detection of WUS is assumed to be ideal. False triggering for detection
of targeting gNB is not considered.
For UE WUS triggering gNB to wake up in case of uplink traffic arrival by
technique A-3-2, for RRC_CONNECTED without C-DRX, and without DL common
signals/DL transmission other than PDCCH carrying UL grant, with the
assumption of a separate receiver used and 100% detection assumption, at low
load, 1 source observed that,
\- With WUS detection power of 10, 55 or, with 90 which has the same active UL
power,
\- When the WUS periodicity is same as the baseline of SR periodicity,
77.8%\~93%, 66.7%\~92.8% or 57.2%\~76.4% network energy savings could be
achieved respectively;
\- When the WUS periodicity is smaller than the SR periodicity of the
baseline, 76.3%\~92%, 46.7%\~78% or 25.7%\~67.1% network energy savings could
be achieved respectively;
\- For each case, the gain generally increases as the WUS periodicity
increases and decreases as the traffic load increases. The gain could also
increase as the gNB detection power decreases.
\- There is latency reduction observed, which could increase as the
periodicity of WUS decreases. The gain can be up to 45%.
\- The assumption is that gNB needs to wake up to detect SR but can detect WUS
during sleep state. gNB is assumed to be in a state such that the main UL
receiver is still in deep sleep when detecting wake-up signal and gNB is able
to wake up from deep sleep to active in one slot after WUS detection. The WUS
receiver is assumed to be active only when detection of WUS signal and becomes
0 power in other time.
When technique A-3-1 is combined with a light version of SSB and on demand
SIB1, one source observed 18.7% network energy savings at low load for FR2,
assuming the light version of SSB contains PSS only and its use is to help the
UE to get synchronized and to be able to transmit an uplink trigger signal.
#### 6.1.3.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
Legacy UEs and UEs that do not support this technique cannot wake up a cell
that is inactive. Legacy UEs and UEs that do not support this technique are
not provided with expected transmission from the cell, therefore they cannot
operate in the cell.
Specification impact of the technique may include:
\- design of uplink wake-up signal/channel,
\- signaling details of wake-up signal/channel and if needed, downlink
signal/channel design/procedure for carrying information regarding the wake-up
configuration,
\- conditions for triggering WUS,
\- mechanisms for DL synchronization and UE measurements needed prior to WUS
transmission,
\- UE\'s assistance information to aid wake up operations by gNB,
\- UE behavior/procedure after transmitting WUS,
\- mechanism on how the UE can be informed about cell activity or lack of
activity.
### 6.1.4 Technique A-4 Adaptation of DTX/DRX
#### 6.1.4.1 Description of technique
Currently, the gNB can use reduced downlink transmission/uplink reception
activity without an explicit cell DTX/DRX pattern with restrictions due to UE
DRX configurations and any configured transmission/reception, e.g., common
channels/signals. Currently C-DRX is configured per UE. The alignment of the
DRX cycles or offsets for different UEs can be done only via RRC. During UE
DRX off period, the UE does not expect to monitor PDCCH, but it is allowed to
initiate UL transmission according to the configured resources (e.g. using
PUCCH, RACH, SR, or CG-PUSCH). Aligning/Omitting of DRX patterns across
multiple UE\'s can be achieved via gNB implementation.
Technique A-4 aims at providing mechanisms informing UE whether the cell stays
inactive. This may include enhancements to UE DRX configuration, e.g. to
align/omit DRX cycles or start offsets of DRX, for UEs in connected mode or
idle/inactive mode, potentially allowing longer opportunities for cell
inactivity. During a cell DTX/DRX, the cell may have no transmission/reception
or only keep limited transmission/reception. For example, the cell does not
need to transmit or receive some periodic signals/channels, such as common
channels/signals or UE specific signals/channels.

Based on 6 sources results, semi-static UE C-DRX alignment achieves BS energy
savings gain by 0.2%\~71.4% depending on the traffic, UE DRX configurations,
and the assumed baseline, e.g. random DRX offset per UE, or gNB is always ON
to provide service to the UE. At low or light traffic load cases, 4 sources
show that the gain can be 14.4%\~71.4%, while 3 sources show less than 6.7%
gain, depending on whether BS and UE active duration are aligned or not; at
medium load case, 2 sources show network energy saving gain can be
4.8%\~47.8%. According to one source, dropping SSB outside UE active time can
achieve the energy savings by 14.4%\~70.1% and it is assumed that the UE
active durations are aligned and the potential impact on synchronization and
UE measurement outside the UE duration is not considered.
On UPT, one source shows there is marginal negative impact while one source
shows it can be up to 15.5%. Also, one source shows that the impact on UPT
varies: when the UE DRX cycle is 160ms and gNB active time is 80ms, the UPT is
increased while in other configurations, there can be large UPT loss.
On access delay/latency, one source shows marginal increment while one source
shows the increment can be up to 50%. Also, about 50% unfinished packet ratio
is observed from one source compared to the baseline without UE C-DRX
alignment during the evaluation period. The increments are related to the DRX
configuration.
Additionally, one source shows that at low and medium load, the average EE is
increased by up to 28.93% when UE DRX alignment is assumed, whereas for light
load case, average EE decreases by up to 12.24% when UE DRX alignment is
assumed.
#### 6.1.4.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
For the cell DTX/DRX cases, depending on DTX/DRX occasions, legacy UEs and UEs
that do not support the technique may not have impact to
idle/inactive/connected mode operations. For example, if DTX/DRX are not
applied to common signals and channel required for idle/inactive/connected
modes or applied in UE specific manner, legacy UEs and UEs that do not support
the technique may not be impacted.
Specification impact of the technique may include:
\- design of cell DTX/DRX pattern/timers/parameters/procedure, if needed,
\- configuration and indication of cell DTX/DRX information to UE, if needed
and applicable,
\- UE behavior and procedures when cell DTX/DRX is in operation and/or when UE
DRX is configured, if needed,
\- potential channel/signal design and mechanism and uplink procedure (e.g.,
UE request or assistance feedback) related to cell DTX/DRX,
\- enhancements to UE DRX configuration
\- enhancements to UE DRX parameter adaptation.
#### 6.1.4.4 Higher layer procedures
Cell DTX/DRX is applied to at least UEs in RRC_CONNECTED state. A periodic
Cell DTX/DRX (i.e., active and non-active periods) can be configured by gNB
via UE-specific RRC signalling per serving cell. Below examples on Cell
DTX/DRX behaviour during non-active periods are assumed to be possible
options, and the UE behaviour/impact will be studied:
\- Example 1: gNB is expected to turn off all transmission and reception for
data traffic and reference signal during Cell DTX/DRX non-active periods.
\- Example 2: gNB is expected to turn off its transmission/reception only for
data traffic during Cell DTX/DRX non-active periods (i.e., gNB will still
transmit/receive reference signals)
\- Example 3: gNB is expected to turn off its dynamic data
transmission/reception during Cell DTX/DRX non-active periods (i.e., gNB is
expected to still perform transmission/reception in periodic resources,
including SPS, CG-PUSCH, SR, RACH, and SRS).
\- Example 4: gNB is expected to only transmit reference signals (e.g., CSI-RS
for measurement).
The study focus on UE behavior when at any point in time the cell activates a
single DTX/DRX configuration. It is up to NW whether legacy UEs can access
cells with Cell DTX/DRX.
The Cell DTX/DRX mode can be activated/de-activated via dynamic L1/L2
signalling and UE-specific RRC signaling. Both UE specific and common L1/L2
signalling can be considered for activating/deactivating the Cell DTX/DRX
mode.
Cell DTX and Cell DRX modes can be configured and operated separately (e.g.,
one RRC configuration set for DL and another for UL). Cell DTX/DRX can also be
configured and operated together. At least the following parameters can be
configured per Cell DTX/DRX configuration: periodicity, start slot/offset, on
duration. Details related to UE behaviour can be discussed during WI phase.
Whether to support multiple Cell DTX/DRX configurations can be discussed later
in the WI phase.
It is beneficial to align UE DRX with Cell DTX and DRX alignment among
multiple UEs. The alignment mechanism can be discussed during the WI phase.
From RAN2 perspective, Cell DTX/DRX is feasible.
6.1.4.5 Impacts on network interfaces
The cell DTX/DRX information is considered necessary to be exchanged and
coordinated between neighbour gNBs. The gNB can use the received cell DTX/DTX
information to determine its own cell DTX/DRX configuration for network energy
saving purpose.
Note: The details of cell DTX/DRX is finally up to RAN1 and RAN2.
### 6.1.5 Technique A-5 adaptation of SSB/SIB1 including on-demand SSB/SIB1
#### 6.1.5.1 Description of technique
Current specification supports SSB/SIB1-less operation for intra-band CA,
where UE retrieves system information from and can perform synchronization
based on another intra-band cell that transmits SSB and SIB1. Current
specification supports SSB periodicity configuration up to 160 msec.
For technique A-5-1 for non-CA, the UE may obtain system information from
other associated carriers/cells and synchronize from other associated
carriers/cells and/or synchronize from signal(s) transmitted on the cell.
Technique A-5-2 also supports on-demand SSB/SIB1 transmissions and enable
longer periods of cell inactivity to achieve network energy saving. SSB/SIB1
transmission at the serving cell can be triggered on-demand, e.g. by the UE.
#### 6.1.5.2 Analysis of NW energy saving and performance impact

transmission and for on-demand SIB1, 2.6% and 5.9% energy savings can be
achieved for one SSB and four SSB respectively, at empty load with baseline of

One source shows on-demand SSB can achieve BS energy savings by 22.0% or 43.4%
at low load compared to a baseline of 20ms SSB/SIB1 periodicity, for without

Performance impact of on demand SSB/SIB was not provided.
#### 6.1.5.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
For on-demand SSB, if no SSB or simplified SSB is transmitted and normal SSB
transmission is triggered upon reception of UE WUS, legacy UEs and UEs that do
not support this technique may not be able to operate in this cell.
\- Technique may be enabled for a carrier only when legacy UEs are not using
the carrier.
For on-demand SIB1, if no SIB1 is transmitted and normal SIB1 transmission is
triggered upon reception of UE WUS, legacy UEs and UEs that do not support
this technique may not be able to operate in this cell.
\- Technique may be enabled for a carrier only when legacy UEs are not using
the carrier.
For technique where UE may obtain system information from other associated
carriers/cells, cell without a SSB cannot be used as PCell/PSCell/inter-band
SCell for legacy UEs and UEs that do not support this technique.
For technique where UE may obtain system information from other associated
carriers/cells, cell without a SIB1 cannot be used as PCell for legacy UEs and
UEs that do not support this technique.
Specification impact of the technique may include:
\- channel/signal design and behavior and procedures of on-demand SSBs/SIB1
and any related signaling,
\- random access related enhancement including procedures and configuration
for UEs to access the SSB/SIB1-less carrier/cell,
\- mobility support or paging for the cell that does not transmit SSB and/or
SIB1,
\- design for new signal/channel (if any) and related procedures.
6.1.6 SCell without SSB in inter-band CA (RAN2)
From RAN2 perspective, the technique is studied from time domain. The
description of this technique, analysis of network energy saving and
performance impact as well as impact on legacy UE and RAN1 specification, can

Refer to clause 6.1.5 for Technique A-5-1 and clause 6.2.1 for Technique
B-1-1.
6.1.6.4 Higher layer procedures
The SCell without SSB in intra-band CA is considered as baseline, i.e., for a
serving cell without transmission of SS/PBCH blocks, a UE acquires time and
frequency synchronization with the serving cell based on receptions of SS/PBCH
blocks on the SpCell or the SCell, of the cell group.
More detailed discussion on higher layer procedures for RAN2 may be needed in
WI phase according to the other WGs input.
Feasibility of this solution is in RAN1 scope.

6.1.7.4 Higher layer procedures
The concept of non-anchor NES cell without SIB is only applicable in multi-
carrier scenario, where the UE is in coverage of an anchor cell and one or
multiple non-anchor NES cell(s).
Anchor cell is a cell where a UE is capable of receiving SSB, system
information and paging.
A non-anchor NES cell without SIB is a cell where the UE cannot receive SIB.
A non-anchor NES cell without SSB and SIB is a cell where a UE can receive
neither SSB nor SIB.
Depending on the design, the access may occur only via anchor cell or also
directly in the non-anchor NES cell. If access directly to a non-anchor NES
cell is supported, the SIB transmitted by anchor cell may also include the
necessary information to access the non-anchor NES cell.
How and whether the timing, synchronization and QCL relationship of the non-
anchor NES cell without SSB and SIB can be determined via another cell is
decided within WI.
UE camps on an anchor cell, not on a non-anchor NES cell without SIB (or
without SSB and SIB).
_Paging on a non-anchor NES cell without SIB or a non-anchor NES cell without
SSB and SIB is not supported._
Feasibility of this solution is in RAN1 scope.
## 6.2 Techniques in frequency domain
### 6.2.1 Technique B-1 Multi-carrier energy savings enhancements
#### 6.2.1.1 Description of technique
Intra-band SSB-less SCell operation is supported by the current specification.
PCell switching is supported by handover command according to current
specification.
Technique B-1-1 for CA supports inter-band CA with SSB-less SCell. No SSB
transmission in some inter-band SCell(s). The synchronization is acquired from
other cell with SSB transmission or same cell with simplified signal
transmission, also in order for fast activation and deactivation of SCell.
Enabling of inter-band SSB-less SCell operation that may include mechanism for
UE/gNB to trigger normal SSB transmission and/or reference signals, if needed,
on a SCell for fast access, where the on-demand uplink triggering signal can
be received either at inter-band SSB-less cell or another carrier/cell. RACH
transmission opportunity may be supported in SSB-less SCell.
Technique B-1-2 supports dynamic PCell switching in which a common primary
cell may be dynamically indicated for a group of UEs.

Observation includes the results for techniques that are also evaluated under
technique A-5 for non-CA. The following is observed.
In general, for SSB and/or SIB saved from one carrier of two carriers, 8
resources observed BS energy savings gain, by 5.1%\~98.4% for empty load,
3.0%\~58.4% for low load, and 1.0%\~7.9% for light load, 0.3%\~5.7% for medium
load. When traffic load is low, network may turn off SCell for energy saving.
The results are for FR1 only.
With one of two carriers having simplified SSB and no SIB1, one source shows
BS energy saving gain can be achieved by 31.4%\~56.5% compared with a baseline
of both carriers having SSB and SIB1 periodicity of 20ms; the same source also
shows that with CA configured where SIB1 is already carried by PCell, compared
with normal SSB on SCell, the gain of simplified SSB on SCell can be
5.7%\~10.5%.
With SIB-less only from one of two carriers and SSB is still transmitted,
\- one source shows that 33.6%\~16.0% BS energy saving gain can be achieved
compared with a carrier has 20ms SIB1 periodicity and both SSB and SIB1 are
transmitted, and the gain decreases as the traffic load increases. Meanwhile,
the SIB1 carried on another carrier increase the energy of that carrier by
7.5%\~5.5%, resulting a total saving across two carries by 26.1%\~10.5%. The
gain decreases to 4.0% when the baseline SIB1 periodicity increases to 160ms;
\- one source shows BS energy saving gain can be 3.3%\~40.7% compared with
baseline of SSB+SIB periodicity of {20ms+20ms, 80ms+80ms, 160ms+160ms} for
anchor cell and non-anchor cell; meanwhile, the SIB1 carried on another
carrier increase the energy of that carrier by 2.3%\~17.8%, resulting a total
saving across two carries by 1%\~22.9%;
\- one source shows at different loads, compared to baseline of 20ms SSB/SIB1
periodicity, that BS energy savings can be achieved by 53.8%\~36.5% with RO
periodicity of 20ms and 160ms;
\- also one source shows less than 2.3% BS energy savings when compared with a
baseline of SCell having SIB1.
With SSB-less only from one of two carriers, in which case the SIB is already
saved from SCell, with assumption that UE is able to acquire sync from a
carrier of another band,
\- for non-CA at different loads, compared to a baseline of 20ms SSB/SIB1
periodicity, one source shows BS energy savings by 27.5%\~22.7% and
51.8%\~43.2% when the RO periodicity is 20ms and 160ms respectively;
\- for CA, two sources show that BS energy savings can be 5.1%\~14.7% at
different loads, compared to a baseline of 20ms SSB periodicity;
\- for CA, one source shows, BS energy saving gain can be 80.4%\~97.4% at
empty load, 6.1%\~72.7% at low load for DL traffic, or 18.7%\~39.4% at low
load for UL traffic compared with baseline of SSB periodicity of {20ms, 80ms,
160ms}. The BS energy saving gain from SSB-less cell with UL traffic is
12.6%\~24.2% larger than SSB-less cell with DL traffic for BS category 2.
\- for CA, one source also shows that when the baseline SCell SSB periodicity
is 160ms, only 0.3%\~3% BS energy savings can be achieved, and one another
shows BS energy savings by less than 7.9% if compared with SCell having SIB1;
\- UE measurement is based on SSB(s) transmitted in the other carrier of the
two carriers.
With both SSB-less and SIB1-less from one of two carriers for non-CA
operation, with assumption that UE is able to acquire sync from a carrier from
another band,
\- compared to baseline of 20ms SSB/SIB1 periodicity on both carriers, one
source shows BS energy savings by 55.1%\~44.4% with RO periodicity of
20ms\~160ms at different loads, and one source shows 9.1%\~14.8% energy
savings at empty load if an anchor carrier carries additional SIB1 for another
carrier;
\- at different loads, compared to baseline of 20ms SSB/SIB1 periodicity, one
source shows BS energy savings by 36.0%\~13.5% when combined with simplified
SSB (i.e. PSS and SSS only);
\- one source shows that with baseline of SSB+SIB periodicity of {20ms+20ms,
80ms+80ms, 160ms+160ms} for anchor cell and non-anchor cell, BS energy savings
can be 9.4%\~98.4% if an anchor carrier carries the SSB and SIB1 for another
carrier depending on the traffic load. Meanwhile, the SIB1 carried on another
carrier increase the energy of that carrier by 2.3%\~17.8%, resulting a total
saving across two carries by 7.1%\~80.6%.
\- Comparison with CA is not provided.
\- UE measurement is not considered.
For results where SSB is not transmitted in SCell, performance impact(s) due
to lack of AGC and cell measurement results before SCell access and activation
is not provided.
For results where SSB is not transmitted in neighbour cell, mobility
performance impact(s) due to SSB-less operation in neighbour cell(s) is not
provided.
In results for SSB and/or SIB saved from one carrier of two carriers, the UPT
is not negatively impacted while one source shows slightly increased UPT. One
source shows that the SCell activation delay can also be reduced to 6ms from
the baseline.
No negative impact observed on UE power consumption for the above schemes.
Additionally, SSB-less SCell for CA can slightly improve the average EE, as
observed by one source.
One source showed that UE-group PCell switching together with SCell dormancy
could provide network energy saving by up to 37.5% for two-CC CA scenario with
FR1 Set 1. However, UPT degrades by 14% if one SCell goes to dormant state.
#### 6.2.1.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
Legacy UEs or UEs that do not support this feature may not be able to operate
inter-band CA with SSB-less SCells. A carrier without SSB cannot be operated
as a PCell/PSCell for legacy UEs. The carrier cannot be operated as an SCell
for legacy UEs if another intra-band carrier with SSB is not present. At least
the feasibility and/or potential requirements of acquiring
synchronization/measurements (including AGC aspects) from other cell with SSB
transmission in inter-band CA needs study.
For SSB-less inter-band CA, specification impact of the technique may include:
\- RACH procedures in SSB-less SCell for inter-band CA,
\- enhancement on SCell activation procedure,
\- enhancements on SCell dormancy operation,
\- design for new simplified signal/channel (if supported) and related
procedures.
For UE-group PCell switching, specification impact may include:
\- mechanism to signal PCell switching,
\- UE behavior based on indicated signalling.
### 6.2.2 Technique B-2 Adaptation of bandwidth part of UE(s) within a carrier
#### 6.2.2.1 Description of technique
In Rel-17, UE-specific BWP configuration and switching is supported. For SPS
PDSCH reception, type-2 CG PUSCH transmission, and SP-CSI reporting on PUSCH,
once BWP is switched, they should be reactivated by activation DCI.
Technique B-2 supports enhancements to enable UE group-common or cell-specific
BWP configuration and/or switching. Also supports enhancements to enable SPS
PDSCH reception/Type-2 CG PUSCH transmission/SP-CSI reporting on PUSCH without
reactivation after the BWP switching.
#### 6.2.2.2 Analysis of NW energy saving and performance impact
The following capture the results for semi-statically configured bandwidth
part of UEs within a carrier. The evaluation is performed with different
traffic, e.g. medium traffic to light traffic for Set 1, and low traffic to
very low traffic for Set 3, and the reduced BW of 80 MHz is applied as NES
mode compared with baseline BW of 100 MHz.

One source observed BS energy savings by 17.4%\~52.2% at the expense of UPT
loss by 28.4%\~14.47%, and packet latency increases by 6.44%\~39.4% when
traffic is reduced compared to corresponding baseline. BWP switching delay is
not modelled.
On scheduling latency, no negative impact is observed from the same source.
#### 6.2.2.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
Legacy UEs and UEs that do not support the technique are not able to change
the BWP using the enhanced signaling mechanisms.
Specification impact of the technique may include signaling and procedure to
support UE group-common or cell-specific BWP configuration and/or switching of
BWP.
### 6.2.3 Technique B-3 Adaptation of bandwidth of UE(s) within a BWP
#### 6.2.3.1 Description of technique
Currently, a bandwidth of a BWP is semi-statically configured, and the
bandwidth of the given BWP cannot be dynamically changed. The current BWP
framework allows the UEs to be configured with a default BWP and switching to
a default BWP based on timer. Reduction of the frequency resources within a
BWP can be achieved via configuration and scheduling a the gNB.
Technique B-3 supports enhancements to enable group-common signaling to adapt
the bandwidth of active BWP and continue operating in same BWP. Some frequency
resources within the active BWP may be deactivated.
#### 6.2.3.2 Analysis of NW energy saving and performance impact
The following captures the results for dynamic /(semi)-static adaptation of
bandwidth of active BWP.

3 sources show different observations.
One source shows small BW energy saving gain by 1.3%/1.4% at the expense of

source shows BW energy saving gain of 1.75%. One source shows BS power
consumption increases with BWP size reduction in a carrier and negative energy
saving gain in the range of -13.5%\~ -75.4% is observed, together with
significantly reduced UPT, and additionally reduced average EE.
#### 6.2.3.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
Specification impact of the technique may include behaviour, procedure, and
signalling related to enabling group-common adaptation of the bandwidth of
active BWP.
## 6.3 Techniques in spatial domain
### 6.3.1 Technique C-1 Adaptation of spatial elements
#### 6.3.1.1 Description of technique
According to legacy MIMO procedures, the adaptation of spatial elements can be
achieved by RRC (re-)configurations updating, such as CSI-RS
(re-)configurations, in a semi-static manner. Moreover, the current framework
allows UE to be configured with multiple CSI-RS resources, where these CSI-RS
configurations may be with respect to different numbers of spatial antenna
ports or antenna elements. With CSI reports respect to different number of
spatial elements available, gNB is able to dynamically adjust the number of
spatial elements for PDSCH transmission in current specification. CSI-RS and
CSI reporting configurations are BWP-specific, and BWP adaptation framework
can be utilized for the adaptation for a UE capable of multiple BWPs and
dynamic BWP switching.
Indication for potential enhancements related to spatial element adaptation
may help the UEs to adapt the already configured CSI-RS configuration such as
dynamic/semi-persistent ON-OFF of CSI-RS or to reconfigure the CSI-RS
configuration, with respect to adapted number of spatial elements/ports.
Technique C-1 aims to enhance dynamically adaptation of spatial elements such
as the number of active transceiver chains or the number of active antenna
panels at gNB in transmitting and/or receiving channels and signals.
#### 6.3.1.2 Analysis of NW energy saving and performance impact

12 sources observed that BS energy savings can be achieved, at all loads for
different sets of reference configurations with FTP3 for FTP3 IM traffic
models, with or without UE C-DRX configuration. The gain depends on whether
there is multiple CSI report assistance, the number of antenna ports that can
be adapted, the load scenarios, and UPT loss. No performance analysis was
provided for broadcast and common channels with dynamic antenna adaptation.
With dynamic/semi-static adaptation of spatial elements,
\- One source shows that BS energy saving for UE specific PDSCH for FR1 can be
achieved by 3.4%\~19.6% with dynamic adaptation and multi-CSI, compared to
dynamic adaptation of spatial elements with single CSI report. The UPT loss
was observed by less than 10%;
\- 3 sources show that the gain for UE specific PDSCH for FR1 can be
6.8%\~31.3% with dynamic adaptation and multi-CSI, compared with no
adaptation, with UPT loss of 0.02%\~7%;
\- 2 sources show that the gain can be 6.7%\~26.5% with dynamic adaptation
without multi-CSI, compared to no adaptation, with UPT loss of 0.3%\~18.5%;
\- 9 sources show that the gain can be 4.8%\~48.2% with static adaptation
without multi-CSI, compared to no adaptation, with UPT loss of 0.02%\~87.08%.
One source observed that the downlink coverage is reduced by 4.5dB \~ 6.5dB
when reducing the number of TxRUs from 64 to 32 in Set 1 FR1 configuration;
\- One source shows that when dynamic antenna adaptation is variably changed,
the gain is reduced to a range of 0\~4.5% with 0.02%\~2.18% UPT loss;
\- One source shows BS energy saving can be 18.8%\~19.7% that additional gain
can be obtained when this scheme is combined with PDSCH power offset. The UPT
loss is observed by 9.06%;
\- More number of elements are reduced, more gain can be generally obtained.
On latency, there is negative impact observed in three sources and the
increment becomes larger as the number of reduced antenna ports becomes
larger.
On UE power consumption, 2 sources show that there is increase by up to 79.99%
(when number of TX RU is reduced from 64 to 8).
Additionally, one source shows that the average EE can be generally increased
except for the low load case where number of antennas is reduced from 64 to
16, and the case of antenna number variably changing.
#### 6.3.1.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
There is no impact for legacy UEs if the spatial element adaptation is used on
a UE-specific basis, i.e., applied only for UEs supporting the technique.
Specification impact of the technique may include:
\- mechanisms to indicate spatial element adaptation to the UE,
\- signaling to update the active CSI-RS configurations,
\- enhancements on CSI-RS (re)configuration, CSI/RRM/RLM measurements, CSI
reporting (e.g., multiple CSI reports), and beam management for gNB to switch
between different spatial domain configurations,
\- associated UE behavior in case of spatial element adaptation occurs, if
needed, e.g., measurements, CSI feedback, power control, PUSCH/PDSCH
repetition, SRS transmission, TCI configuration, beam management, beam failure
recovery, radio link monitoring, cell (re)selection, handover, initial access,
etc.
### 6.3.2 Technique C-2 Adaptation of TRPs in mTRP operation
#### 6.3.2.1 Description of technique
Technique C-2 aims to support TRP activation/deactivation that can be informed
to the UE when a UE is configured with multiple TRPs. The technique aims to
dynamically adapt the number of TRPs transmitting and/or receiving signals and
channels.
#### 6.3.2.2 Analysis of NW energy saving and performance impact

For two TRP configuration case at different loads,
\- (2 sources) with semi-static TRP reduction, BS energy saving gain can be
achieved by 36.9%\~41.6% compared to no TRP reduction, with UPT loss of
7.27%\~22%;
\- (one source) with dynamic TRP reduction, compared to no TRP reduction, BS
energy saving gain can be achieved by 19.7%\~28.7%, without reported UPT
impact. It assumes two TRP are always transmitting CSI-RS.
For the BS energy saving gain around 19.7%\~28.7%, it is also observed from
one source that UE power savings can be achieved by about 12%.
#### 6.3.2.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
There is no impact for legacy UEs if the spatial element adaptation is used on
a UE-specific basis, i.e., applied only for UEs supporting the technique.
Specification impact of the technique may include:
\- UE-specific/group-level/cell common signaling for indicating adaptation of
TRPs and TRP-related parameters (e.g. TRP index or CORESET pool index) in
mTRP,
\- enhancements to UE behaviours due to dynamic adaptation of TRPs, e.g.,
measurements, CSI feedback, power control, PDCCH/PUCCH/PUSCH/PDSCH repetition,
single-DCI based scheduling, multi-DCI based scheduling, SRS transmission, TCI
configuration, beam management, beam failure recovery, radio link monitoring,
cell (re)selection, handover, initial access, etc.
## 6.4 Techniques in power domain
### 6.4.1 Technique D-1 Adaptation of transmission power of signals and
channels
#### 6.4.1.1 Description of technique
As per current specification, the SSB reference power, _ss-PBCH-BlockPower_ is
defined in SIB1. The _powerControlOffsetSS_ that is the power offset between
(NZP)CSI-RS and SSB, and the _powerControlOffset_ that is the power offset of
PDSCH and (NZP) CSI-RS, are semi-statically configured via RRC signaling. The
power offset configurations for PDSCH and CSI-RS are BWP-specific. Current
specification allows gNB to adapt the PDSCH transmission power.
Technique D-1 aims at adapting the transmission power or PSD of downlink
signals and channels dynamically, by enhancing the related configuration to
the UE (e.g. considering power offsets that account for potential power
adaptation) and/or enhancing the UE feedback (e.g. CSI report) to assist NW
energy saving operation. The technique may be applicable to one or more of
PDSCH, CSI-RS, DMRS, broadcast channels/signals (e.g., SSB/SI/paging).
Enhancements for updating the power offset values between various signals and
channels, e.g., CSI-RS to SSB, or PDSCH to CSI-RS include using lower layer
signaling.
#### 6.4.1.2 Analysis of NW energy saving and performance impact
The following capture the results for adaptation of transmission power of
signals and channels.

achieve BS energy savings gain at all load cases for both Set 1 FR1 TDD and
Set 2 FR1 FDD including 4Tx BS antenna configuration, for both BS categories
with FTP3 or FTP3 IM model, with or without UE C-DRX configuration.

5.3%\~11.5%, compared to dynamic power reduction without multi-CSI report; one
source observed BS energy savings by 12.1%\~23.8%, compared to no power
reduction baseline;
\- The gain generally increases when the traffic load increases;
\- The UPT loss is less than 1.17%;
\- No performance analysis was provided for broadcast and common channels with
dynamic downlink transmission power adaptation.

dB;
\- The UPT loss is observed by 2.03%\~19.49%.
One source observed that the latency can be increased by up to 24.21% when the

#### 6.4.1.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
There is no impact for legacy UEs and UEs that do not support the technique if
the signaling of modified power ratio between CSI-RS and PDSCH/SSB or between
SSB and CSI-RS, enhancements on CSI measurement and reporting are used on a
UE-specific basis, i.e., applied only for UEs supporting the enhancement.
Specification impact of the technique may include:
\- signaling of modified power of SSB or power ratio between CSI-RS and
PDSCH/SSB to provide adaptation of power ratio values, e.g. by utilizing UE-
specific, group-level or cell common signaling,
\- enhancements on RRM measurements, beam management, beam failure recovery,
radio link monitoring, cell (re)selection and handover procedure,
\- enhancements to CSI measurements and reporting, e.g. multiple CSI reports
in a single report.

linear impairments of the transmitter in standard transparent manner.
Technique D-2 supports over the air digital pre-distortion at the gNB. In gNB
digital pre-distortion over the air, the UEs assist the gNB in reducing
nonlinear impairments introduced by the PA, by processing on training signals,
and reporting the information needed for gNB digital pre-distortion.

3 reference configuration. Note PA scaling values used for this NW ES scheme
are not covered by RAN1 power consumption scaling model. On UPT/latency, no
negative impact is observed.

\- introduction of training signals/CSI-RS enhancements,
\- signaling for reporting assistance information for gNB digital pre-
distortion,
\- indication to the UE of whether it needs to apply non-linear equalization
for a transmission.
### 6.4.3 Technique D-3 Tone reservation
#### 6.4.3.1 Description of technique
Technique D-3 supports tone reservation that decreases PAPR, potentially
taking into account channel conditions and characteristics. Tone reservation
(TR) exploits the channel nulls to carry TR tones, potentially taking into
account channel conditions and characteristics. The UE is to be notified of
the sub-carriers carrying the TR signal for rate matching purposes only if UE
performs transmission or reception of the resource including sub-carriers
carrying the TR signal.
gNB may be able to implement PAPR reduction including tone reservations via
implementation with appropriate scheduling of signals and channels.

off reduction of 1\~3 dB which leads to 2.1%\~9.5% BS energy saving gains
depending on configurations, compared with transparent tone reservation. Note

consumption scaling model.
On UPT/latency, no negative impact is observed.
No impact on UE power consumption is observed.

reservation positions.
Specification impact of the technique may include:
\- assistance information from the UE to help gNB determine tone reservation
positions,
\- mechanism to convey information about tone reservation positions to the UE,
\- behavior associated with handling of resources with tone reservation
positions.
### 6.4.4 Technique D-4 PA power bias adaptation
#### 6.4.4.1 Description of technique
In case of low load, the PA can adapt/reduce its backoff thus reduce the PA
power consumption. PA backoff impacts unwanted in-band and out-of-band
emissions. gNB may be able to implement PA backoff adaptation in a
specification transparent manner.
Technique D-4 supports modification and/or reduction of the power amplifier
(PA) backoff in cases of no or low load. This technique enables PA backoff
adaptation for few msec and coordinate PA backoff adaptation among
neighbouring cells.
#### 6.4.4.2 Analysis of NW energy saving and performance impact
No evaluations of this technique are available.
#### 6.4.4.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
Specification impact of the technique may include enhancements to UE
measurements for assessing the impact from the PA backoff adaptation of
neighbour cells.
### 6.4.5 Technique D-5 UE post-distortion
#### 6.4.5.1 Description of technique
Technique D-5 supports the UE performing received signal post-distortion
processing (e.g. non-linear equalization stage that will \"invert\" the non-
linearity) to combat non-linear impairments from the transmitter. The
technique also considers enhancements to transmission of reference signals or
information to aid the UE to perform post-distortion processing.

One source observed that UE post-distortion can achieve BS energy saving by
16.1% for Set 3 reference configuration. Note PA scaling values used for this
NW ES scheme are not covered by RAN1 power consumption scaling model.
On UPT or latency, there is no negative impact observed.
The impact on UE power consumption depends on UE receiver\'s design for DPoD.
#### 6.4.5.3 Legacy UE and RAN1 specification impacts
Legacy UEs and UEs that do not support the technique are not able to
compensate the received signal distortions based on this enhancement
mechanism.
Specification impact of the technique may include:
\- mechanism and signalling to enable operation of UE post distortion,
\- enhancements to reference signals to aid UE post distortion,
\- signaling/configuration for supporting UE digital post-distortion,
\- introduction of activation of UE post distortion, notification of selected
power amplifier model, and possibly configuration of training reference
signals,
\- signaling for indicating to the UE of whether it needs to apply non-linear
equalization for a downlink transmission.
## 6.5 Higher layer aspects for network energy savings
From RAN3 perspective, the following candidate techniques (i.e., those
described in clause 6.5.3 and 6.5.4) should be evaluated in terms of energy
saving gain at the normative phase. Other candidate techniques discussed are
not excluded.
### 6.5.1 Cell selection/reselection
For backward compatibility, there is a need to allow NES cells to prevent
legacy UEs from camping. NES cells should be able to configure whether to
prevent legacy UEs, while allowing NES-capable UEs to camp on. Possible
solutions may include but not limited to:
\- Use IntraFreqExcludedCellList/InterFreqExcludedCellList
\- Use the cellBarred or cell reservation fields in MIB/SIB
The definition of NES cell will be discussed in the **WI** phase.
The NW should be able to configure NES-capable UEs to prioritize/**down**
-prioritize a specific NES cell or NES cells on a specific frequency. It is
left to the WI phase whether the existing mechanism for cell (re)selection is
sufficient according to the NES techniques specified.
From RAN2 perspective, legacy UEs and NES-capable UEs can be handled via cell
selection/reselection techniques **in the presence of NES cells**.
### 6.5.2 Connected mode mobility
During the switching of NES modes, it is possible to handover the UEs faster
by enhancing the CHO framework with:
1\. Evaluation of conditional handover conditions depending on the NES mode of
source/target cell,
2\. How to indicate to UE the triggering of the CHO evaluation is up to the WI
phase.
Whenever mobility from source cell is triggered, the NES mode of the target
cell could also be considered, e.g., to avoid UEs selecting cells operating in
NES mode if any other cell is available.
From RAN2 perspective, CHO enhancements are feasible.
Group HO (optimizing the Rel-15 HO procedure) and BWP adaptation with group
signalling are not considered by RAN2.
### 6.5.3 Inter-node Beam Activation
This mechanism allows an NG-RAN node to request a neighbouring NG-RAN node to
switch on certain SSB beams which have been deactivated e.g., in the capacity
layer. With this mechanism, the NG-RAN node (e.g., in the coverage-layer) can
request the re-activation of SSB beams that are deactivated before.
### 6.5.4 Paging Enhancements
This mechanism allows an NG-RAN node to page, e.g. the stationary UEs in a
restricted area. For example, paging can be done in certain SSB(s) instead of
all the SSBs within a cell.
# 7 Conclusions
Network energy savings for NR have been studied for both FDD and TDD, both FR1
and FR2. Power model comprised of different BS power states/modes for BS power
consumption is defined in clause 5 for evaluation purpose by using relative
power, which includes different sleep and active states (including DL
transmission and UL reception), and two types of BS categories. A scaling
approach considering BS power split by a static part of power and a dynamic
part of power is established for evaluation purpose, reflecting the
relationship of BS power consumption with respect to transmission
resources/configurations in time, frequency, spatial and power domain.
The potential techniques for enabling/improving network energy savings in
various domains are evaluated and analysed, as documented in clause 6.1- 6.4.
Techniques description, performed evaluations and performance impact on
selected KPIs including UPT, access delay, latency, UE power consumption, or
on averaged energy efficiency etc., as well as legacy UE impact and
specification impact are summarized therein. The relevant higher layer
procedures and analysis for some techniques are also included in clause 6.1.
Other common aspects from higher layer are studied and the outcome is
documented in clause 6.5.
The study of time domain techniques can be summarized as follows.
Depending on factors such as selected baselines, BS categories, SLS
configurations (including reference configurations, traffic models,
number/periodicity of reference signals), scaling parameters, and UE profiles
(including UE RRC_IDLE/INACTIVE/CONNECTED mode, DRX configurations), as well
as conditions (such as gNB detection, gNB coordination, UE ability of
synchronization) etc.,
\- 4 sources show technique A-1-1 of simplified SSB without PBCH or with
partial PBCH could achieve BS energy savings by 0.7%\~30.49% in range, with no
observed impact on UPT due to empty load.
\- 2 sources show technique A-1-2 of static skipping one or more of SSB/SIB1
transmission could achieve BS energy savings by 0.3%\~25.4% in range,
meanwhile the impact on access delay/latency is not provided in the
simulation.
\- 9 sources show technique A-1-3 of statically adapting the periodicity of
SSB longer than 20ms up to 1280ms (with current maximum periodicity being
160ms) could achieve BS energy savings by 0.9%\~84.8% in range, meanwhile when
traffic occurs and load increases, the UPT significantly decreases and the
latency/access delay/UE power consumption increases proportionally as the
periodicity of SSB/SIB increases compared to a corresponding baseline.
\- 2 sources show technique A-1-4 of statically adapting Paging (by 1 source)
or SSB transmission patterns (by 1 source), could achieve BS energy savings by
0.2%\~42.3% in range for Paging enhancement or 10.3% for SSB enhancement,
meanwhile UPT/latency impact are not reported.
\- 1 source shows technique A-1-5 of statically adapting RACH
periodicity/occasions could achieve BS energy savings by 14.4%\~24.9% in
range, meanwhile access delay/latency is increased from 10ms to 70ms,
proportional to the increased PRACH periodicity.
\- 1 source shows technique A-1-6 of scheduling SIB1 by SSB could achieve BS
energy savings by 4.8%\~14.8% in range without report of impact on UPT/latency
as irrelevant to the technique.
\- 5 sources show technique A-3-1 of UE WUS triggering gNB for SSB/SIB/RACH,
with the assumption of ideal detection of UE WUS, could achieve BS energy
savings by 6.2%\~80.7% in range with UPT loss by 0%\~24.2%, while 1 source
shows technique A-3-2 of UE WUS triggering gNB to wake up in case of uplink
traffic arrival could achieve BS energy savings by 25.7%\~93% in range, with
latency reduction of 0%\~45.5% depending on the SR periodicity assumed in the
baseline,
\- Note technique A-3-2 of UE WUS triggering gNB to wake up in case of uplink
traffic arrival assumes that gNB can detect WUS during sleep state.
\- 6 sources show technique A-4 of semi-static UE C-DRX alignment could
achieve BS energy savings by 0.2%\~71.4% in range, meanwhile, 3 sources show
that there is negative impact on UPT with loss from 0.91% to 15.5%, and 1
source shows that when the UE DRX cycle is 160ms and gNB active time is 80ms
the UPT is increased while in other configurations there can be large UPT loss
(up to 62.4%), 1 source shows marginal increment on latency while 1 source
show up to 50% latency increase.
\- 3 sources show technique A-5-2 of on-demand SSB/SIB1 could achieve BS
energy savings by 2.6%\~43.4% in range, meanwhile performance impact of on
demand SSB/SIB was not provided.
\- Technique A-1-4 of adapting Paging and technique A-1-5 of adapting RACH
periodicity/occasions may be used in a cell where legacy UE can still use
legacy Paging/RACH resources with negative impact on latency for legacy UEs,
while other techniques except technique A-3 and A-4 may be enabled for a
carrier only when legacy UEs are not using the carrier.
\- For technique A-3, legacy UEs cannot wake up a cell that is inactive, and
cannot operate in the cell if not provided with expected transmission from the
cell; for technique A-4, depending on DTX/DRX configuration, legacy UEs may
not be impacted.
\- Technique A-4 of adaptation of Cell DTX/DRX is also studied in higher
layer. From RAN2 perspective, technique A-4 is considered feasible and it is
also beneficial to align UE DRX durations with Cell DTX and DRX durations
among multiple UEs.
\- Technique A-3 of UE WUS is also discussed in higher layer and from RAN2
perspective, it is feasible if RAN1 agrees to support WUS, and details can be
discussed in normative phase if supported.
For techniques in frequency domain, the study can be summarized as follows.
Under various conditions,
\- 8 sources show technique A-5-1 (for non-CA) or B-1-1 (for CA) of SSB-
and/or SIB1-less operation in two carriers deployment could achieve BS energy
savings by 0.3%\~98.4% in range on the energy saving cell/carrier and if more
information, such as system information, needs to be transmitted at the anchor
carrier then 2.3%\~18.9% BS energy increases on the associated cell/carrier,
meanwhile the UPT/UE power consumption is not negatively impacted while 1
source shows slightly increased UPT and 1 source shows reduced SCell
activation delay, assuming UE sync is based on SSB from anchor carrier and UE
measurement is not considered,
\- A cell without SSB (or SIB1) cannot be operated as PCell/PSCell/inter-band
SCell (or PCell for SIB1-less) for legacy UEs. Mobility performance impact(s)
(for techniques A-5-1 of SSB-less operation in non-CA), or performance
impact(s) due to lack of AGC and cell measurement (for techniques B-1-1 of
SSB-less operation in CA) is not provided. For non-CA operation with both SSB-
less and SIB1-less, comparison to CA is not provided.
\- 1 source shows technique B-1-2 of dynamic UE-group PCell switching could
achieve BS energy savings by 5.8%\~37.5% in range, meanwhile UPT degrades by
14% if one SCell goes to dormant state.
\- 1 source shows technique B-2 of statically BWP adaptation of BW reduction
for multiple UEs within a carrier could achieve BS energy savings by
17.4%\~52.2% in range, while the reported UPT loss ranges from 6.1%\~28.2%.
\- 2 source show technique B-3 of BW adaptation of multiple UEs within a BWP
could achieve BS energy savings by up to 1.75%, and 1 source shows negative
energy saving gains (i.e. energy consumption increase) up to 75.4% with
significant UPT loss (up to 88%).
\- Evaluation of all techniques is based on the baseline BS power model in
Clause 5.
\- From RAN2 perspective, technique A-5-1/B-1-1 of SCell without SSB in inter-
band CA and NES cell without SSB/SIB may need more detailed study in normative
phase (if supported) with feasibility up to RAN1. From RAN2 perspective,
techniques B-2 is not considered.
Based on the study and summary, from time and frequency domain,
\- Technique A-4 of adaptation of DTX/DRX, including the alignment of Cell
DTX/DRX with UE DRX, is beneficial for network energy savings.
\- Adaptation/reduction/elimination of common channels/signals (UE WUS can
also be considered) in single or multi-carrier operation are beneficial for
network energy savings.
For techniques in spatial domain, over baseline of 32/64 TxRU for a gNB/TRP,
the study can be summarized as follows,
\- 12 sources show technique C-1 of adaptation of spatial elements could
achieve BS energy savings by 0\~48.2% in range, with legacy UE co-existence,
at the expense of small (less than 10% for dynamic adaptation with multi-CSI)
to large (up to 87.08% for static adaptation) negative impact on UPT. 4
sources provide evaluation results for dynamic adaptation while 9 sources
provide evaluation result for static adaptation.
\- 3 sources show technique C-2 of TRP muting in multi-TRP operation could
achieve BS energy savings by 19.7%\~41.6% in range, at the expense of UPT loss
of 7.27%\~22% for static TRP muting. 1 source provides evaluation results for
dynamic adaptation while 2 sources provide evaluation results for static
adaptation.
Based on the study, at least a technique based on C-1 is beneficial for
network energy savings, and can be recommended. Technique C-2 also has the
potential to provide large network energy saving gain.
For techniques in power domain, the study can be summarized as follows,
\- 10 source show technique D-1 of transmission power reduction on PDSCH could
achieve BS energy savings by 2.3%\~51.5% in range, with legacy UE co-
existence, with UPT loss of 0\~19.49%/latency increment of up to 24.21%/UE
power consumption increment of up to 14.78%. 2 sources provide evaluation
results for dynamic adaptation while 8 sources provide evaluation results for
static adaptation.
\- 1 source shows technique D-2 of over the air digital pre-distortion,
technique D-3 of channel aware tone reservation, and technique D-5 of UE post-
distortion, could achieve BS energy savings by 8.9%, by 2.1%\~9.5%, and by
16.1% respectively, with no/negligible negative impact on UPT/UE power
consumption, with PA scaling values not covered by the scaling of power model
in clause 5.
Based on the study, at least a technique based on D-1 is beneficial for
network energy savings.
For other higher layer aspects for network energy savings, from their
perspective, the study can be summarized as follows.
\- It is feasible to handle legacy UEs and NES-capable UEs via cell
(re-)selection techniques. It is also feasible and possible to enhance the CHO
framework to handover UEs faster.
\- Group HO is not considered.
\- Inter-node beam activation and paging enhancement need more study in
normative phase, if supported.
\- A means that one can prevent legacy UEs from camping on NES cells (of which
definition can be left to WI phase), and/or allow NES-capable UEs to
(down-)prioritize specific NES cell(s) on specific frequency, is needed, which
is left to the WI phase depending on whether the existing mechanism for cell
(re)selection is sufficient according to the NES techniques specified.
It is recommended that the normative phase includes not only energy saving
techniques (the necessary enhancements would need to be further identified
during the normative phase) but also the mitigation of their impacts when
network applies network energy savings technique(s).
