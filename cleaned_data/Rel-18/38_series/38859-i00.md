In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 General descriptions of expanded NR positioning enhancements
In Release 17, 3GPP RAN conducted studies on \"NR positioning enhancements\"
TR 38.857 [2] and \"Scenarios and requirements of in-coverage, partial
coverage, and out-of-coverage NR positioning use cases\" TR 38.845 [3].
The study on \"Scenarios and requirements of in-coverage, partial coverage,
and out-of-coverage NR positioning use cases\" focussed on V2X and public
safety use cases with the outcome being captured in TR 38.845 [3].
Additionally, SA1 has developed requirements in TS 22.261 [4] for \"Ranging
based services\" TR 22.855 [5] and has developed positioning accuracy
requirements in TS 22.104 [6] for IIoT use cases in out-of-coverage scenarios.
There is a need for 3GPP to study and develop sidelink positioning solutions
that can support the use cases, scenarios and requirements identified during
these activities.
The study on \"NR positioning enhancements\" TR 38.857 [2] investigated higher
accuracy, and lower latency location, high integrity and reliability
requirements resulting from new applications and industry verticals for 5G.
Some of the enhancements identified during that work have been specified
during the Release 17 Work Item on \"NR positioning enhancements\", but there
remain a number of opportunities for enhancement that have not yet been
incorporated into the specifications.
Regarding higher accuracy, two promising techniques identified in earlier
studies will be considered in Release 18: one is to take the advantage of the
rich 5G spectrum to increase the bandwidth for the transmission and reception
of the positioning reference signals based on PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation
for intra-band carriers, and the other is to use the NR carrier phase
measurements. GNSS carrier phase positioning has been used very successfully
for centimetre-level positioning but is limited to outdoor applications. NR
carrier phase positioning has the potential for significant performance
improvements for indoor and outdoor deployments in comparison with the
existing NR positioning methods, as well as shorter latency and lower UE power
consumption in comparison with RTK-GNSS outdoors.
Positioning integrity is a measure of the trust in the accuracy of the
position-related data and the ability to provide timely warnings based on
assistance data provided by the network. The focus in Release 17 work was on
GNSS integrity, and for Release 18 it is natural to extend this to address
other positioning techniques as well as there are relevant integrity aspects
of mission critical use cases that rely on positioning estimates and the
corresponding uncertainty estimate. Integrity enables applications to make the
correct decisions based on the reported position, e.g., when monitoring a
robotic arm to decide whether its arm movement are within allowed limits to
ensure safety distances to humans and other objects.
SA1 has introduced requirements for LPHAP (Low Power High Accuracy
Positioning) for industrial IoT scenarios including use cases such as massive
asset tracking, AGV tracking in industrial factory and person localization in
danger zones. The SA1 requirements are for high accuracy and extreme low power
consumption with battery life sustainable up to one or more years. A typical
scenario of interest is use case 6 as defined TS 22.104 [6], which corresponds
to tracking of workpiece (in- and outdoor) in assembly area and warehouse with
a target accuracy of \ \- RTT-type solutions using SL
>
> \- This includes single-sided (also known as one-way) RTT and double-sided
> (also known as two-way) RTT
>
> \- May include RTT with one or multiple devices.
>
> \- Strive to minimize the changes needed on top of the specification support
> for single-sided RTT, if any, for the introduction of double-sided RTT.
>
> \- NOTE: a UE should be able to support single-sided RTT without having to
> support double-sided RTT.
\- SL-AoA
\- This includes both Azimuth of Arrival (AoA) and Zenith of Arrival (ZoA) in
the study
\- SL-TDOA
\- For SL-only positioning, at least for the purpose of absolute positioning
estimation of a target UE, SL-TDOA corresponds to a method wherein SL PRS are
transmitted from multiple anchor UEs to a target UE (i.e., DL-TDOA-like
operation), and/or from a target UE to multiple anchor UEs (i.e., UL-TDOA-like
operation).
\- Based on the study, it was agreed that both DL-TDOA-like operation and UL-
TDOA-like operation should be introduced.
\- A UE is not required to support both DL-TDOA-like operation and UL-TDOA-
like operation.
\- SL-AoD
\- SL-AoD is deprioritized against the other methods listed above for possible
introduction.
Note that the above identification of methods does not necessarily imply their
specification as separate methods nor specification of a unified positioning
method for sidelink.
For the study of different positioning methods, the following aspects are
considered:
\- Definition(s) of the corresponding SL measurements for each method
\- Applicability of different positioning methods to absolute or relative
positioning or ranging, including whether such categorization is needed to be
discussed
\- For angle-based methods, antenna configuration consideration(s) using
practical UE capabilities
\- Per-panel location, if UE uses multiple panels
\- UE\'s mobility, especially for V2X scenarios
\- Impact of synchronization error(s) between UEs
\- Existing SL measurements (e.g., RSSI, RSRP), and UE ID information etc, may
be used.
With regards to the sidelink positioning measurement report, the following
aspects are included as part of the study:
\- Contents of the measurement report, that may include:
\- One or more sidelink positioning measurement(s)
\- Timestamp(s) associated with a sidelink positioning measurement
\- Quality metric(s) associated with a sidelink positioning measurement
\- Identification Information for a sidelink positioning measurement
\- Time domain behavior of the measurement report (e.g., one-shot, triggered,
aperiodic, semi-persistent, periodic).
Whether sidelink positioning measurements can be higher-layer report and/or a
lower-layer report is considered in the study.
With regards to the Positioning methods supported using SL PRS measurements at
least the following measurements are agreed to be introduced:
\- SL Rx-Tx time difference measurement
\- SL RSTD measurement
\- SL RSRP measurement
\- SL RSRPP measurement
\- SL RTOA measurement
\- SL Azimuth angle of Arrival (AoA) and SL Zenith angle of Arrival (ZoA)
measurement.
#### 5.2.1.2 Physical layer structure and reference signal design for SL
positioning
New reference signal designs for SL positioning/ranging, referred to as SL
PRS, are studied using the existing PRS/SRS design and SL design framework as
starting points.
For sequence design for the new reference signal for SL PRS, pseudo-random
sequence, using existing DL-PRS sequence as a starting point, is identified as
the preferred choice.
With regards to the numerologies of the SL PRS, the study is limited to those
supported for NR Sidelink.
As part of the study, at least the following aspects are considered: Sequence
design, frequency domain pattern, time domain pattern (e.g., number of
symbols, repetitions, etc), time domain behavior,
configuration/triggering/activation/de-activation of the SL PRS, AGC time, Rx-
Tx turnaround times, supportable bandwidth(s), multiplexing options with other
SL channels, and randomization/orthogonalization options.
On the physical structure of SL PRS, a frequency domain pattern following a
comb-N design is studied, at least including the following:
\- N>=1 (where N=1 corresponds to full RE mapping pattern)
\- Fully staggered SL PRS pattern (e.g., M symbols of SL PRS with comb-N with
M=N and, at each symbol a different RE offset is used), Partially staggered SL
PRS pattern (e.g., M symbol(s) of SL PRS with comb-N, with M\
1)
\- Of the above, fully and partially staggered patterns are further
prioritized.
\- The number of symbols of SL PRS within a slot
\- Any relation to the comb-N option
\- RE offset pattern repetitions within a slot
With regards to the frequency and time domain pattern of a SL PRS resource
within a slot, a SL PRS resource has the following characteristics:
\- On the value N (comb size) and the number M of SL PRS symbols within a slot
excluding the symbol(s) used for AGC training / Rx-Tx turnaround:
\- At least the following values are considered as potential candidate values:
N = {1,2,4,6,8,12}
\- The values considered as potential candidate values for M need further
consideration during normative work.
\- Whether to consider N>12 as a potential candidate value(s) will be
considered further during normative work.
\- The symbols of a SL PRS resource within a slot are consecutive symbols
\- Whether to support consecutive and/or non-consecutive symbols for shared
resource pool can be considered further during normative work.
\- Details of RE-Offset sequence within a SL PRS resource, including whether
to have in the end of the SL PRS pattern a symbol with the same RE-offset as
the first symbol, for phase-tracking purpose, can be considered further during
normative work.
For the new SL PRS design, the following are further studied:
\- Number of symbol(s) for AGC and/or Rx-Tx turnaround time.
\- Conditions under which AGC training and/or Rx-Tx turnaround time are
needed.
#### 5.2.1.3 Physical layer procedures for SL positioning
On the configuration/ activation/ deactivation/ triggering/ reservation of SL
PRS, the study focused on the following options, with considerations on
flexibility, overhead, latency, and reliability:
\- Option 1: High-layer-only signaling involvement in the SL PRS
configuration.
\- No Lower layer involvement, e.g., SL-MAC-CE or SCI or DCI, for the
activation or the triggering of a SL PRS.
\- Based on the study, this option may correspond to:
\- A SL PRS configuration that is a single-shot or multiple shots.
\- A high-layer configuration that may be received from an LMF, a gNB, or a
UE.
\- Option 2: High-layer and lower-layer signaling involvement in the SL PRS
configuration.
\- Lower-layer may correspond to SL-MAC-CE, or SCI, or DCI.
\- For example, high layer signaling can be used for SL PRS configuration and
lower layer signaling can may be used for initiating SL positioning and/or
configuration/triggering/activating/deactivating/indicating and potential
resource indication/reservation transmission of SL PRS.
Regarding resource allocation for SL PRS, at least the following schemes are
studied:
**\- Scheme 1** : Network-centric operation SL PRS resource allocation (e.g.,
similar to a legacy Mode 1 solution)
\- The network (e.g., gNB, LMF, gNB & LMF) allocates resources for SL PRS
**\- Scheme 2** : UE autonomous SL PRS resource allocation (e.g., similar to
legacy Mode 2 solution)
\- At least one of the UE(s) participating in the sidelink positioning
operation allocates resources for SL PRS
\- Applicable regardless of the network coverage
\- Potential mechanisms, if needed, for SL PRS resource coordination across a
number of transmitting UEs (e.g., Inter-UE Coordination (IUC)-like solutions)
can be considered further during normative work.
Regarding Scheme 1 SL PRS resource allocation, a transmitting UE receives a SL
PRS resource allocation signaling from the network. One or both of the
following options are considered further for the corresponding signaling:
\- Opt. 1: Through higher layers from the LMF
\- Opt. 2: Through dynamic grants, or via configurations of configured grant
type 1 or type 2 from gNB.
Regarding Scheme 2 SL PRS resource allocation, at least the following aspects
are studied:
\- Resource selection mechanism for SL PRS
\- Inter-UE coordination
\- Aspects for congestion control mechanisms for SL PRS.
For Scheme 2 SL PRS resource allocation, one or both of the following options
may be supported during normative work:
\- Option 1: A sensing-based resource allocation
\- Option 2: A random resource selection
\- For either Option 1 or 2, the legacy designs for UE autonomous resource
allocation should be used as a starting point and potential enhancements that
may be needed may be considered during the normative work.
Additionally, on SL positioning resource allocation, the following
alternatives are studied:
\- Alt. 1: Only dedicated resource pool(s) can be (pre-)configured for SL PRS
\- For dedicated resource pool(s) for SL positioning, at least the following
details are agreed to be considered:
\- which slots can be used, SL frame structure, SL positioning slot structure,
multiplexing of SL PRS with control information (if included in the same
slot),
\- positioning measurement report,
\- whether a dedicated frequency allocation (e.g., layer/BWP) is needed for SL
PRS,
\- resource allocation procedure(s) of SL PRS,
\- NOTE: This option may or may not include control information (i.e.,
configuration/ activation/ deactivation/ triggering of SL PRS) for the purpose
of SL positioning operation.
\- Alt. 2: Either dedicated resource pool(s) and/or a shared resource pool(s)
with sidelink communication can be (pre-)configured for SL PRS
\- For shared resource pool(s) for SL positioning, at least the following
details are considered:
\- Co-existence between SL communication and SL positioning, backward
compatibility
\- Multiplexing considerations of SL PRS with other PHY channels (PSCCH,
PSSCH, PSFCH) and any modifications in the SL-slot structure.
\- NOTE: whether other signals/channels can be present in the dedicated
resource pool can be considered further during the normative work.
With regards to the SL Positioning resource allocation, it was agreed that
either dedicated resource pool(s) and/or a shared resource pool(s) with
sidelink communication can be (pre-)configured for SL PRS.
\- NOTE: this does not imply that the design is the same for both types of
resources pools.
\- NOTE: shared resources pool(s) should be supported with backward
compatibility.
A dedicated SL PRS resource pool is (pre-)configured in the only SL BWP of a
carrier.
The following options are considered for multiplexing of other channels in a
dedicated resource pool for SL positioning in addition to SL PRS:
\- Opt. 1: No other channel can be included beyond SL PRS
\- Opt. 2: PSCCH which carries SCI associated with SL PRS transmission(s) is
included
\- Opt. 3: PSCCH which carries SCI associated with SL PRS transmission(s) and
PSSCH associated with SL PRS transmission(s) are included
\- Definition of \"PSSCH associated with SL PRS transmission(s)\" can be
considered further during normative work.
At least for a dedicated resource pool for SL positioning, the following
alternatives are studied for subsequent down-selection:
\- Alt. 1: The bandwidth of SL PRS can be same or smaller than that of the
resource pool.
\- Alt. 2: The bandwidth of SL PRS is the same as that of the resource pool.
\- Bandwidth of SL PRS transmission for a shared resource pool can be
considered further during normative work.
For SL Positioning resource (pre-)configuration in a shared resource pool with
Rel-16/17/18 sidelink communication, backward compatibility with legacy
Rel-16/17 UEs should be ensured.
With regards to SL signaling of the reservation/indication of SL PRS
resource(s) for dedicated resource pool and shared resource pool for
positioning:
\- SCI can be used for reserving/indicating one or more SL PRS resource(s)
\- NOTE: This does not imply that only SCI is being used. Higher layer
signaling may be used for the purpose of indicating a part of the SL PRS
configuration.
\- Whether SCI is single stage SCI or two stage SCI can be considered further
during normative work.
\- Use of SL-MAC-CE or other higher-layer signaling for SL PRS resource
reservation/indication can be considered further during normative work.
The granularity of time-domain resource allocation for SL PRS transmission is
studied.
The following options for time-domain resource assignments and associated Tx
UE behavior for SL PRS transmissions are studied:
\- Periodic SL PRS
\- SL PRS is transmitted periodically with a transmission periodicity.
\- Any additional details, including whether or not higher layers can
start/stop transmission, can be considered further during normative work.
\- Semi-persistent SL PRS
\- SL PRS is transmitted periodically with a transmission periodicity after
activation and until deactivation.
\- Aperiodic SL PRS
\- SL PRS is transmitted at least once after either triggering or request.
\- Applicability of the above options to SL PRS resource allocation schemes 1
and 2 respectively can be considered further during normative work.
\- Details of Rx UE behavior can be separately discussed during normative
work.
\- Mechanism(s) to be used for activation/deactivation/triggering can be
considered further during normative work.
Resource allocation for SL-Positioning measurement reports is also included in
the study.
Power control mechanisms for SL PRS transmission, including their necessity,
are considered in the study. Based on the study, it was agreed that at least
Open Loop Power Control (OLPC) should be introduced during the normative work.
### 5.2.2 Potential architecture and signaling procedures for sidelink
positioning
5.2.2.1 Potential architecture for SL positioning
Sidelink positioning in-coverage, partial coverage and out-of-coverage
scenarios may be supported. In partial coverage scenarios, either of UEs
including target UE and one or multiple anchor UEs may be OOC, but with at
least one UE being in coverage.
The architecture and signaling procedures are studied to support Operation
Scenarios 1 and 2 involving PC5-only-based positioning and combination of Uu-
and PC5-based positioning respectively.
NOTE: How to enable the procedures/signaling for supporting SL positioning in
partial coverage will be further discussed in normative work.
RAN2 follow SA2 on the architecture, including the possibility of a UE as a
location server. RAT-independent SL positioning is not considered in this
release. RAN2 waits for SA2 on the triggering of the positioning procedures
from upper layers.
The current NG-RAN positioning architecture can in principle be re-used to
support Sidelink Positioning in in-coverage and partial coverage scenarios.
5.2.2.2 Sidelink Positioning Protocol (SLPP)
With regards to the sidelink positioning **procedures between UEs** , **SLPP
is introduced** to support at least the following functionalities:
\- SL Positioning Capability Transfer
\- SL Positioning Assistance Data exchange
\- SL Location Information Transfer
\- Error handling
\- Abort
The cast type for SLPP signaling is studied, including unicast, groupcast and
broadcast.
Unicast/one-to-one operation is assumed as baseline for exchange of SLPP
signaling **between UEs**. Unicast SLPP session-based operation is supported.
At least \"centralized\" operation is supported, i.e., operation where one UE
performs range and/or position calculations based on measurement/location
information relating to itself and/or other UEs. It is feasible to send at
least the following positioning signaling for groupcast/broadcast (in addition
to unicast) from RAN2\'s perspective:
\- SL positioning capability
\- SL positioning assistance data
Location information is not excluded and can be further considered in
normative work.
RAN2 will further discuss in normative work:
\- The security issues (e.g., requirements for ciphering and/or integrity) on
specific information of SL positioning capability and assistance data in
groupcast/broadcast.
\- The use cases for applying groupcast/broadcast.
Both session-based and session-less operation for sidelink positioning
signaling are studied.
Sidelink positioning supports a session-based concept in SLPP, in which
signaling messages within a session can be associated with one another by the
involved UEs. The relationship to upper-layer designs from SA2 can be
discussed during normative work.
Whether to also support session-less operation and what aspects of session-
based operation would not be included can be studied further during normative
work.
At least in the case that positioning methods are supported that do not
require a mutual exchange of SLPP messages associated with one another among
UEs, SLPP session-less operation can be supported. If session-less operation
can be operated with security can be studied further during normative work.
If it is determined to support group positioning, it is feasible to perform at
least ranging with the estimate calculation at multiple UEs.
SLPP is a separate ASN.1 module from LPP (this does not necessarily imply
whether it is included in TS 37.355 [16]).
For the transport layer of SLPP, RAN2 agrees to down select between PDCP and
PC5-U.
5.2.2.3 Signaling between UE and LMF
The potential impact to LPP for the support of sidelink positioning procedures
between UE and LMF is studied. Protocol between UE and LMF for hybrid PC5+Uu
positioning and PC5-only positioning in-coverage will be down-selected from
the following options during normative work.
\- Extension of LPP, whereby new signaling is to be defined to support hybrid
Uu and PC5 based positioning, i.e., extend the existing LPP to support
sidelink based positioning between UE and LMF
\- Enhancement of LPP whereby SLPP signaling can be transported within LPP
transparently, i.e., use the newly defined SLPP to support sidelink based
positioning and use the existing LPP to support Uu based positioning; and the
SLPP is carried as a container in LPP
\- Use of SLPP between the UE and the LMF
The details of functionalities of LMF for supporting SL positioning will be
discussed in normative work.
## 5.3 Summary of sidelink positioning evaluations

requirements
The methodology for the evaluation of SL positioning can be found in Annex

positioning and relative positioning/ranging for all evaluated scenarios.

100MHz especially for the cases with smaller X values or RSU assist, and 5 out
of 7 sources show that Set A cannot be met with 100MHz PRS bandwidth

### 5.3.2 Evaluation of absolute positioning, relative positioning, and
ranging methods
The performance analysis for Rel-18 SL positioning shows that different SL
positioning methods can be used to determine absolute position of a target UE:
\- Simulation results for SL positioning based on SL-TDOA were reported in
contributions from 13 sources ([18], [21], [22], [23], [24], [26], [27], [28],
[29], [30], [31], [32], [78]).
\- Simulation results for SL positioning based on SL-RTT (multi-RTT) were
reported in contributions from 6 sources ([19], [20], [27], [28], [29], [30]).
\- Simulation results based on two anchors SL-AOA were provided in
contribution from 1 source ([26]).
For absolute positioning, 5 sources ([19], [24], [30], [32], [33]) provide
simulation results for Joint Uu-SL absolute positioning.
\- For V2X use case, 4 sources ([19], [24], [32], [33]) show performance
improvement of Joint Uu-SL absolute positioning compared to SL-only
positioning.
\- For V2X use case, 2 sources ([32], [33]) show performance improvement of
Joint Uu-SL absolute positioning compared to Uu-only positioning.
\- For IIOT use case, 3 sources ([19], [24], [32]) show performance
improvement of Joint Uu-SL absolute positioning compared to SL-only
positioning.
\- For IIOT use case, 3 sources ([24], [30], [32]) show performance
improvement of Joint Uu-SL absolute positioning compared to Uu-only
positioning.
\- For Public safety, 1 source ([24]) shows performance improvement of Joint
Uu-SL absolute positioning compared to SL-only or Uu-only positioning.
\- For commercial use case, 1 source ([24]) shows performance improvement of
Joint Uu-SL absolute positioning compared to SL-only positioning.
\- For commercial use case, 2 sources ([24], [30]) show performance
improvement of Joint Uu-SL absolute positioning compared to Uu-only
positioning.
The performance analysis for Rel-18 SL positioning shows that, SL positioning
methods can be used for relative positioning/ ranging between UEs. For
relative positioning/ ranging positioning accuracy,
\- Simulation results based on SL-RTT and/or AOA were provided in
contributions from 12 sources ([19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26],
[27], [30], [31], [33]).
\- Results based SL-TDOA were provided in contribution from 1 source ([32]).
Simulation results in contributions from 9 sources ([19], [20], [22], [23],
[24], [25], [26], [27], [31]) show that relative horizontal accuracy and/or
distance accuracy of ranging performance improves with decreasing values of X,
where X is the maximum distance between two UEs for performing relative
positioning or ranging.
\- In some simulation cases, for a certain SL PRS bandwidth, a target
requirement may be achieved for a smaller value of X but may not be achieved
for a larger value of X.
\- In some simulation cases, a target requirement may be achieved using a
smaller SL PRS bandwidth for a smaller value of X but may only be achieved
using a larger SL PRS bandwidth for a larger value of X.
From the reported simulation results, it is observed that SL absolute
positioning performance may be degraded due to uncertainty in the anchor UEs\'
location coordinates and synchronization error (for SL-TDOA) between anchor
UEs.
## 5.4 Potential specification impact for sidelink positioning
The following summarizes the key areas of potential specification impact from
RAN1\'s perspective that have been identified for the support of solutions for
sidelink positioning:
\- Specification changes to support the following two operation scenarios:
\- Operation Scenario 1: PC5-only-based positioning.
\- Operation Scenario 2: Combination of Uu- and PC5-based positioning.
\- Specification changes to introduce:
\- RTT-type solution(s) using SL, SL-AoA, SL-TDOA (where DL-TDOA-like
operation and UL-TDOA-like operation are included).
\- At least the following measurements: SL PRS based Rx-Tx measurement, SL PRS
based RSTD measurement, SL PRS based RSRP measurement, SL PRS based RSRPP
measurement, SL PRS based RTOA measurement, SL PRS based Azimuth of Arrival
(AoA) and SL Zenith of Arrival (ZoA) measurement.
\- A new sidelink reference signal (SL PRS), including details of sequence
design, physical structure, resource mapping.
\- Support of unicast, Groupcast (not including many to one) and Broadcast of
SL PRS transmissions,
\- Support of SCI to be used for reserving/indicating one or more SL PRS
resources.
\- SL PRS resource allocation Scheme 1 and Scheme 2, where Scheme 1
corresponds to a network-centric resource allocation, and Scheme 2 corresponds
to UE autonomous SL PRS resource allocation, and potential mechanisms for SL
PRS resource coordination.
\- SL PRS transmission in dedicated resource pool or shared resource pool that
may be shared with Rel-16/Rel-17/Rel-18 SL communication.
\- Support of Open Loop Power Control (OLPC) for SL PRS transmissions.
\- Details of sidelink positioning measurement reporting.
**RAN2 identified that there is potential specification impact for sidelink
positioning including:**
\- Introduction of a new protocol for sidelink positioning procedures between
UEs, with where it is specified to be determined during normative work.
\- The new protocol is a separate ASN.1 module from LPP (this does not
necessarily imply whether it is included in TS 37.355 [16]).
\- Options for signaling between LMF and UE will be downselected during
normative work.
From the perspective of NG-RAN interface, the following have been identified
to have potential specification impact for support of sidelink positioning:
\- Support of sidelink positioning and ranging service authorizations
signaling to NG-RAN as needed.
# 6 Positioning enhancements for improved integrity, accuracy, and power
efficiency
## 6.1 Integrity **for** RAT**-dependent positioning techniques**
### 6.1.0 Study objectives
The following objectives of the study on solutions for integrity for RAT-
dependent positioning techniques are listed in the SID [7]:
\- Identification of the error sources.
\- Study of methodologies, procedures, signaling, etc for determination of
positioning integrity for both UE-based and UE-assisted positioning.
\- Reuse of concepts and principles developed for RAT-Independent GNSS
positioning integrity are to be prioritized, when possible.
### 6.1.1 Identification of error sources
Sources of error for RAT-dependent positioning techniques are studied for
timing-based and angle-based positioning methods focussing on the origin of
the error source, the model of the error source, criteria for consideration as
an error source, and mapping between an error source and a positioning method
(e.g., DL, UL, DL&UL positioning method).
UE-based/assisted DL positioning methods, UL and DL&UL positioning methods are
considered in the study.
For timing-based positioning methods, the following error sources are studied:
\- TRP/UE measurements errors (e.g., ToA, Rx-Tx timing difference)
\- Error in assistance data (e.g., TRP location, Inter-TRP synchronization
errors (e.g., RTD))
\- TRP/UE Timing error
\- Identification of error sources resulting from the multipath/NLoS
channel/radio propagation environment, including multipath/NLoS channel itself
as an error source, can be considered further during normative work.
For angle-based positioning methods, the following error sources are studied:
\- TRP/UE measurements errors (e.g., AoA, RSRP, RSRPP)
\- Error in assistance data (e.g., TRP location, TRP beam antenna information)
\- Identification of error sources resulting from the multipath/NLoS
channel/radio propagation environment, including multipath/NLoS channel itself
as an error source, can be considered further during normative work.
For UE-based positioning integrity mode, whether boresight direction of DL PRS
(**_NR-DL-PRS-BeamInfo_** in TS 37.355 [16]) and/or beam information (**_NR-
TRP-BeamAntennaInfo_** in TS 37.355 [16]) of DL PRS can be error sources can
be considered further during normative work, focusing at least on the
following aspects:
> \- Granularity of boresight direction of DL-PRS and its influence on
> positioning integrity
>
> \- Feasibility and complexity of modelling
>
> \- Feasibility of obtaining quality/statistical parameters of beam
> information from the gNB
>
> \- Influence on measurement errors at the UE.
For DL AoD, whether DL PRS RSRP/RSRPP measurement can be an error source is
studied, focusing at least on the following aspect:
> \- Impact of RSRP/RSRPP measurement on positioning accuracy.
For LMF-based positioning integrity mode, whether System Frame Number (SFN)
initialization time is an independent error source for UL-TDOA or UE-assisted
DL-TDOA is studied.
Table 6.1.1-1 presents the identified error sources for LMF-based and UE-based
positioning integrity modes for different positioning methods.

The distributions of RSTD, RTOA, and UE/gNB Rx-Tx time difference measurement
errors are studied considering the following aspects:
\- Whether TEG-related timing error is an independent error source from timing
related measurement error (e.g., RTOA, RSTD, UE/gNB Rx-Tx time difference)
> \- Whether the measurement error is considered for each ToA or for the
> reported RSTD value
>
> \- Other Details (e.g., mean and standard deviation).
The distribution of angle of arrival measurement error is studied considering
the following aspects:
\- Whether the angle of arrival measurement error can be expressed as the
error of the AoA/ZoA in LCS or GCS or the error of a defined function of
AoA/ZoA in LCS
> \- Distribution of AoA measurement error for an NLOS/LOS link
>
> \- Other Details (e.g., mean, standard deviation).
The following alternatives for expression of angle of arrival measurement
error for determination of positioning integrity for UL AoA are studied with
the aim of eventual down-selection:

>
> \- Alt. 2: Conversion function (defined as function of AoA/ZoA in LCS).

### 6.1.2 Methodologies, procedures and signaling for determination of
positioning integrity
6.1.2.1 Integrity principle of operation
Reuse the concepts and principles developed for RAT-Independent GNSS
positioning integrity for RAT-Dependent positioning integrity.
Both UE-based and LMF-based integrity for RAT-dependent cases are studied and
supported in integrity for RAT-dependent positioning.
Use DNU flag for RAT-dependent integrity, with the meaning that the concerned
assistance data cannot be used for integrity calculation but may be usable for
positioning. Signaling details and relation to error sources can be determined
in normative work.
6.1.2.2 Signaling for UE-based positioning integrity
Rel-17 UE-based integrity mode signaling can be used as baseline at least with
the following aspects:
UE sends capability info to LMF on integrity for UE-based mode using LPP
capability transfer procedure.
\- LMF sends the assistance data for integrity calculation to UE. LMF
provides, in assistance data, the information of error sources (e.g.,
originated from RAN node) to UE for integrity in UE-based mode.
\- LMF sends integrity requirement e.g., TIR to UE in LPP request location
information message for integrity of UE-based mode.
\- UE sends integrity result to LMF using LPP location information Transfer
message.
6.1.2.3 Signaling for LMF-based positioning integrity
RAN2 studied LMF-based positioning integrity mode [2], and have identified the
following impacts to signaling:
\- UE sends capability info to LMF for LMF-based positioning integrity mode
using LPP capability transfer procedure
\- LMF sends the request of results related to integrity for integrity error
sources to UE for integrity of LMF-based mode
\- LMF sends the request of results related to integrity for integrity error
sources to RAN for integrity of LMF-based mode
\- RAN sends results related to integrity to LMF using NRPPa message.
NOTE 1: The signaling to transmit integrity KPI and integrity results can be
discussed during normative work.
NOTE 2: Whether UE sends results related to integrity to LMF using LPP message
or not can be discussed during normative work.
### 6.1.3 Summary of evaluation results for integrity for RAT-dependent
positioning techniques
The distribution of timing measurement error has been studied with evaluations
reported by the following sources: [133], [135], [136], [137], [138], [139],
[141], and [142].
The distribution of angle measurement error has been studied with evaluations
reported by the following sources: [133], [134], [135], [137], [138], and
[142].
Further details on the above can be found in Annex B.2.
### 6.1.4 Potential specification impact for integrity for RAT-dependent
positioning techniques
For UE-based positioning integrity mode, potential specification impacts
related to errors in assistance data (e.g., related to inter-TRP
synchronization error and TRP locations) include at least the enhancements to
assistance data from the LMF to the UE (e.g., inclusion of parameters related
to the error sources).
Signaling design of both UE-based and LMF-based integrity can be supported.
## 6.2 PRS / SRS **bandwidth aggregation**
### 6.2.0 Study objectives
In the SID [7], the following is identified as an objective for the study of
PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation towards enabling higher accuracy positioning:
\- Study solutions for accuracy improvement based on PRS/SRS bandwidth
aggregation for intra-band carriers considering e.g., timing errors, phase
coherency, frequency errors, power imbalance, etc.
### 6.2.1 Potential solutions based on PRS / SRS bandwidth aggregation
6.2.1.1 RF aspects
RF aspects of PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation for intra-band contiguous carriers
is studied by RAN4. Based on the study, PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation for
intra-band contiguous carriers is concluded as feasible for single chain Tx/Rx
architectures at both the UE and gNB.
The assumption for a single-chain Tx architecture is that PRS/SRS resources to
be aggregated are transmitted from a single Tx antenna.
6.2.1.2 RRM aspects
From the perspective of Radio Resource Management (RRM), the following are
assumed for PRS bandwidth aggregation:
\- A common numerology is required across all intra-band contiguous PFLs to be
aggregated.
\- PRS resources to be aggregated from different PFLs can have different
bandwidths (i.e., different number of PRS RBs).
**\- PRS resources** to be aggregated **from different PFLs are transmitted in
the same slot and in the same symbols.**
\- PRS resources to be aggregated from different PFLs are transmitted by the
same TRP and associated with a common Antenna Reference Point (ARP).
From RRM perspective, the following are assumed for SRS bandwidth aggregation:
\- A common numerology is required across all intra-band contiguous carriers
to be aggregated.
\- SRS resources to be aggregated from different carriers can have different
bandwidths (i.e., different number of SRS RBs).
**\- SRS resources** to be aggregated **from different carriers are
transmitted in the same slot and in the same symbols.**
From RRM perspective, FFT/IFFT size is up to UE implementation. PRS/SRS
bandwidth aggregation should allow UE implementation flexibility i.e., single
FFT/IFFT or multiple FFTs/IFFTs (i.e., FFT/IFFT per carrier) implementations.
PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation may be supported in RRC_CONNECTED and
RRC_INACTIVE subject to UE capability.
PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation across Positioning Frequency Layers (PFLs) for
positioning measurements is concluded as feasible from RRM perspective.
### 6.2.2 Summary of evaluations for PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation
RRM impact of possible group delay error between PRS/SRS from different
carriers in single RF chain (Tx/Rx) architecture will be considered in RRM
requirements during the WI.
### 6.2.3 Potential specification impact for PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation
Specification of RRM requirements including at least PRS measurement
period/reporting/accuracy (including margins), and the impacts of PRS
measurement on data communication including CA/DC.
## 6.3 NR carrier phase positioning
### 6.3.0 Study objectives
In the SID [7], the following objectives for the study on solutions for
accuracy improvement based on NR carrier phase measurements have been
identified:
\- Study on reference signals, physical layer measurements, and physical layer
procedures to enable positioning based on NR carrier phase measurements for
both UE-based and UE-assisted positioning.
In this study, the reuse of existing PRS and SRS is prioritized, with
consideration of new reference signals only if found necessary.
In the following three clauses, potential solutions, achievable performance,
and expected specification impact for support of positioning methods utilizing
NR carrier phase measurements are presented.
For the purposes of discussion, for NR downlink and/or uplink carrier phase
positioning, the carrier phase (CP) at a RF frequency at a receiver is a phase
that is a function of the signal propagation time from a transmitter antenna
reference point of a transmitter (e.g., a TRP or a UE) to a receiver antenna
reference point of the receiver (e.g., a UE or a TRP). The propagation time
can be expressed in a fractional part of a cycle of the RF frequency and a
number of integer cycles, but the CP may be independent of the number of
integer cycles.
### 6.3.1 Potential solutions for NR carrier phase positioning
#### 6.3.1.1 Reference signals for NR carrier phase positioning
Existing DL PRS and UL SRS for positioning can be re-used as the reference
signals to enable positioning based on NR carrier phase measurements for both
UE-based and UE-assisted positioning. Whether to consider enhancements of the
existing DL PRS and UL SRS for better positioning performance can be
considered further. Note that the use of MIMO SRS for positioning purpose is
transparent to UE.
#### 6.3.1.2 Physical layer measurements for NR carrier phase positioning
The study of the accuracy improvement based on NR carrier phase measurements
includes:
\- UE-based and UE-assisted carrier phase positioning
\- UL carrier phase positioning and DL carrier phase positioning
\- NR carrier phase positioning with the carrier phase measurements of one
carrier frequency or multiple frequencies
\- Combination of NR carrier phase positioning with another standardized Rel.
17 positioning method, e.g., DL-TDOA, UL-TDOA, Multi-RTT, etc.
For DL UE-assisted NR carrier phase positioning, at least the following
options are considered:
\- The difference between the carrier phase measured from the DL PRS signal(s)
of the target TRP and the carrier phase measured from the DL PRS signal(s) of
the reference TRP
\- The carrier phase measured from the DL PRS signal(s) of a TRP.
For UL UE-assisted NR carrier phase positioning, at least the carrier phase
measured from the UL SRS for positioning purpose is considered.
#### 6.3.1.3 Physical layer procedures for NR carrier phase positioning
The impact of integer ambiguity on NR carrier phase positioning and potential
solutions to resolve the integer ambiguity when using carrier phase
measurements to estimate the propagation delay/distance between transmitting
and receiving nodes are studied.
Benefits of using the carrier phase measurements of multiple DL PFLs for NR
carrier phase positioning, which may include the impact of the time gap
between the carrier phase measurements of multiple DL PFLs are studied.
NOTE 1: The initial phase error and the frequency error for each PFL can be
modelled independently.
NOTE 2: For evaluations, the PRSs of all the PFLs of a TRP can be assumed to
be transmitted from the same ARP or from different ARPs of the TRP.
NOTE 3: The location error for ARPs can be modelled independently.
NOTE 4: The timing errors of the PFLs may not be the same for PFLs in
different bands or frequency ranges.
NOTE 5: In Rel-17, simultaneous reception of DL PRS from multiple frequency
layers is not supported.
The impact of multipath/NLOS on NR carrier phase positioning is evaluated
during the study item. Based on the study, it is concluded that multipath/NLOS
deteriorates the performance of carrier phase positioning, and it is necessary
to consider multipath mitigation for NR carrier phase positioning.
The effectiveness of the following multipath mitigation methods for NR carrier
phase positioning is studied:
\- Identification and separation of the first path and other paths.
\- Reporting of the carrier phase of the first path, and optionally, the
additional paths.
\- The use of LOS/NLOS indication for the carrier phase measurements.
\- NOTE: Rel-17 LOS/NLOS indicator can be considered as a starting point.
\- The report of other channel information, such as existing RSRP/RSRPP.
The use of Positioning Reference Unit (PRU) to facilitate NR carrier phase
positioning is studied.
\- For DL NR carrier phase positioning, a PRU works as a UE to receive the DL
PRS reference signals and provide the DL carrier phase measurements to the
LMF, where the double differential measurements can be obtained by the
difference of the DL carrier phase measurements from the target UE and those
from the PRU for eliminating the measurement errors.
\- For UL NR carrier phase positioning, a PRU works as a UE to transmit the UL
SRS signals for positioning purpose. The TRPs provide the UL carrier phase
measurements obtained from the UL SRS signals of the target UE and of the PRU
to the LMF, where the double differential measurements can be obtained by the
difference of these UL carrier phase measurements for eliminating the
measurement errors.
The following approaches for NR carrier phase positioning are studied:
\- The reporting of the carrier phase measurements together with the existing
positioning measurements.
\- The reporting of the carrier phase-based measurements alone without
reporting the existing positioning measurements.
Potential solutions for NR carrier phase positioning are evaluated with the
consideration of various error sources, which include phase noise (FR2),
carrier frequency offset (CFO)/Doppler, oscillator-drift, transmitter/receiver
antenna reference point (ARP) location errors, transmitter/receiver initial
phase error, antenna Phase Center Offset (PCO) etc. Detailed evaluation
methodology and assumptions are presented in Annex A.3
A summary of the evaluation results for the impact of the multipath/NLOS on NR
carrier phase positioning are presented in Clause 6.3.2.
NR carrier phase positioning performance is evaluated at least with the
carrier phase measurements of a single measurement instance.
It should be noted that the use of \"carrier phase positioning\" does not
necessarily imply that it may be defined as a standalone positioning method.
**_The potential solutions of integer ambiguity resolution for NR carrier
phase positioning were investigated in the study item, which include the
following_** :
\- Reporting of the carrier phases of more than one frequency from UE/TRP to
LMF
\- NOTE: frequency refers to frequency of carrier or frequency of
subcarrier(s)
\- Reporting **_of the determined integer ambiguity and/or the search range of
the integer ambiguity from UE/TRP to LMF_**
\- Reporting **_of the carrier phase measurements together with the legacy
positioning measurements from UE/TRP to LMF_**
\- Reporting of the new measurements from UE /TRP to LMF, e.g., based on
carrier phase differentials across multiple subcarriers within a carrier
\- NOTE: _carrier_ phase differentials across multiple subcarriers within a
carrier can be equivalent to time of arrival
\- LMF configure the integer ambiguity range between the TRP and target UE
(for UE-based NR CPP).
### 6.3.2 Summary of evaluations for NR carrier phase positioning
The methodology for the evaluation of NR carrier phase positioning can be
found in Annex A.3.
_Evaluations of NR carrier phase positioning were conducted using evaluation
assumptions with some differences across sources. Different algorithms and
methods are also used for estimating the carrier phases and determining UE\'s
location based on the carrier phases. Thus, for the observations of evaluation
results presented in this clause, it is important to consider the details of
the evaluation assumptions as well as the algorithms and methods provided by
each source in the references (e.g., in Annex B.4)._
_The accuracy of NR carrier phase positioning is evaluated under different
scenarios (e.g., InF-SH, InF-DH) defined in [11] without considering the error
sources listed in Annex A.3 (e.g., timing/ frequency errors, antenna PCO and
ARP position errors). The evaluation results can be seen as the reference for
studying the impacts of the error sources listed in Annex A.3. 9 out of 11
sources ([79], [80], [81], [82], [_ 85 _], [86], [87], [88], [_ 90]_) show
that the centimeter-level positioning accuracy can be achieved by the use of
carrier phase measurements at least when other error sources are not
considered. 2 out of 11 sources ([_ 83], [84]) s _how that the centimeter-
level positioning accuracy can be achieved by the use of ideal resolution of
integer ambiguity_ _:_ **
\- Source [79] shows:
\- For InF-SH scenario:
\- (No differential) UL-CPP (Case 1): \ NOTE 1: In the above results, all other error sources (except initial phase
> error) were not modelled.
>
> NOTE 2: Unless indicated otherwise, the results shown above are for
> horizontal positioning accuracy with a single carrier of bandwidth of 100MHz
> in FR1.
>
> NOTE 3. Evaluation results above are mainly used as examples. Additional
> results and more details of the evaluation assumptions are provided in Annex
> B.4.
The impact of the residual CFO at the transmitter and the receiver for NR
carrier phase positioning are evaluated during the study item.
\- The evaluation results from the sources ([73], [76]) show that the impact
of residual CFO on carrier phase positioning is negligible.
\- The evaluation results from the source ([75]) show that the impact of the
residual CFO on the performance of carrier phase positioning can be mitigated
with the use of the double differential technique with a PRU that is located
at a fixed location in LOS of the TRP.
\- The evaluation results from the source [80] show that the impact of
residual CFO on carrier phase measurement is negligible. However, carrier
phase positioning accuracy degrades significantly with residual CFO with
single differential (SD) DL-CPP:
\- With UE residual CFO 30Hz and TRP residual CFO 10Hz, the accuracy drops
from 0.0044m to 0.2m \@80% and from 0.0014m to 0.0017m \@50% in InF-SH.
\- With UE residual CFO 100Hz and TRP residual CFO 10Hz, the accuracy drops
from 0.0044m to 0.27m \@80% and from 0.0014m to 0.0024m \@50% in InF-SH.
\- The evaluation results from the source [86] show that carrier phase
positioning accuracy degrades slightly with residual CFO with DD DL-CPP:
\- With maximum residual CFO 30Hz between UE and TRP, the accuracy drops from
0.0010m to 0.0018m \@50% and from 0.0046m to 0.0208m \@80% in InF-SH.
\- With maximum residual CFO 100Hz between UE and TRP, the accuracy drops from
0.0010m to 0.0027m \@50% and from 0.0046m to 0.0440m \@80% in InF-SH.
\- The evaluation results from the source [88] show the impact of Doppler in
FR1 at 3kmph is small enough that it has negligible impact on the carrier
phase positioning accuracy with DD DL-CPP, in the simulated scenario under the
agreed modelling for residual CFO.
> NOTE 1: Unless indicated otherwise, the results shown above are for
> horizontal positioning accuracy with a single carrier of bandwidth of 100MHz
> in FR1.
>
> NOTE 2: Evaluation results above are mainly used as examples. Additional
> results and more details of the evaluation assumptions are provided in Annex
> B.4.
_The impact of the ARP errors on NR carrier phase positioning is evaluated. 8
out of 8 sources ([__79_ _], [__80_ _], [__81_ _], [__85_ _], [__86_ _], [87],
[__88_ _], [__90_ _]) show that the ARP errors may have significant impact on
NR carrier phase positioning accuracy. 3 out of 8 sources ([__79_ _], [__81_
_], [__85_ _]) show_ _the impact of gNB ARP position errors on multi-frequency
carrier phase positioning is much smaller than the impact on single-frequency
carrier phase positioning._ **
\- Source [79] shows:
\- When double differential is not used:
\- For InF-SH scenario with 1cm ARP error:
\- UL-CPP (Case 23): 1.3368m \@50% and 2.121m \@80%
\- For InF-DH scenario with 1cm ARP error:
\- UL-CPP (Case 24): 1.2329m @ 50% and 1.9317m \@80%
\- When double differential is used:
\- For InF-SH scenario with 1cm ARP error:
\- (PRU 5m) DD UL-CPP (Case 27): \ NOTE: This proposal does not imply which carrier phase measurements are
> mapped to which positioning technique.
Multipath mitigation methods for the carrier phase positioning are recommended
to be introduced during normative work, if NR CPP is introduced. The candidate
solutions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
\- Reporting of the carrier phase of the first path.
\- At least reporting of the carrier phase of the first path, and optionally,
the additional paths.
\- The use of LOS/NLOS indication for the carrier phase measurements.
\- NOTE: Rel-17 LOS/NLOS indicator can be considered as a starting point.
\- Reporting of other channel information together with carrier phase
measurements, such as existing RSRP/RSRPP.
At least the double differential technique with PRU is feasible for UE-based,
and UE-assisted NR carrier phase positioning, if NR CPP is introduced, at
least, for eliminating the impact of the initial phases of the transmitter and
the receiver.
NOTE 1: How to efficiently enable the use of the PRU for supporting NR double
differential carrier phase positioning needs further discussion during
normative work.
NOTE 2: The required PRU density also needs further discussion during
normative work.
NOTE 3: Other methods for eliminating the impact of the initial phases of the
transmitter and the receiver are not precluded.
## 6.4 Low power high accuracy positioning
### 6.4.0 Study objectives
For the study on enhancing the power efficiency of RAT-dependent positioning
methods for LPHAP use cases, the following objectives have been identified in
the SID:
\- Study of the requirements on LPHAP as developed by SA1 and evaluation of
whether existing RAN functionality can support the power consumption and
positioning requirements.
\- Based on the evaluation, and, if found beneficial, study of potential
enhancements to help address any limitations.
The study is limited to enhancements to RRC_INACTIVE and/or RRC_IDLE states.
### 6.4.1 Target use cases and requirements for low power high accuracy
positioning
Use case 6 defined in TS 22.104 [6] is the single representative use case for
the study of LPHAP.
For LPHAP, the main objective of the evaluations from the perspective of lower
layers is on UE power consumption.
At least relative power unit is adopted as the performance metric to evaluate
the power consumption of the Rel-17 RRC_INACTIVE state positioning and
potential enhancements.
A reference device (e.g., a mobile phone) with reference traffic type,
reference battery capability, and reference battery life is defined for the
purpose of identification of the performance gap that achieved by the Rel-17
RRC_INACTIVE state positioning baseline and the target battery life of LPHAP
use case 6.
For the service type, at least the \'Low Power Periodic and Triggered 5GC-MT-
LR Procedures\' in TS 23 .273 [144] is supported.
For the evaluations of LPHAP use case 6, the following performance
requirements are considered:
\- Horizontal positioning accuracy \ SRS configuration request can be discussed during normative work from RAN2
> perspective. Scenarios requiring SRS configuration request include:
\- Scenario 1: During the UL positioning procedure, when the SRS configuration
turns invalid, e.g., when the UE moves out of the SRS positioning validity
area.
\- Scenario 2: At the initiation of UL positioning procedure when an event is
detected.
> Detailed solution for the SRS update, e.g., with RRC message, UL MAC, or NG-
> AP message can be discussed in the WI phase.
\- Pre-configure multiple SRS
> Pre-configuration of multiple SRS configurations (e.g., for multiple SRS
> positioning validity areas) is feasible from RAN2 perspective and can be
> discussed in normative work.
>
> The pre-configuration of multiple SRS configurations can be delivered to the
> UE either by dedicated signalling or SI broadcast.
b. Enhanced DL-PRS configuration
> Alignment between DRX and PRS is beneficial from power saving point of view
> for LPHAP and is recommended to normative work. Two directions of solutions
> for DRX/PRS alignments are considered:
\- PRS alignment with fixed DRX
\- DRX alignment with fixed PRS
Solutions for the PRS/DRX alignment, e.g., LMF-based/UE-based solution, is to
be discussed.
Impacts to different RRC states (RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_IDLE) is to be
discussed.
c. Exposure of LPHAP information to the gNB and/or LMF
> Exposure of LPHAP information to the gNB and/or LMF (e.g., as a UE
> capability) can be discussed in normative work if any enhancement for LPHAP
> is agreed, taking into account any guidance from SA2.
d. Positioning in RRC_IDLE state
> \- DL positioning in RRC_IDLE is recommended to normative work from RAN2\'s
> perspective if power saving benefits are confirmed by RAN1.
>
> Measurement is performed in RRC_IDLE while measurement report is sent in
> RRC_CONNECTED.
>
> Feasibility of measurement report in msg5 should be evaluated with SA2/3
> involved.
>
> Whether the CN can handle the measurement reports from the UE in
> RRC_CONNECTED, while the positioning measurement was performed in RRC_IDLE,
> can be evaluated in the WI phase with SA2 involved.
e. Paging relaxation
> Paging relaxation by skipping paging reception in RRC_INACTIVE for LPHAP is
> beneficial from power saving point of view and feasible from RAN2\'s
> perspective. Skipping paging reception in RRC_INACTIVE is recommended for
> normative work from RAN2\'s perspective for achieving LPHAP requirements, if
> feasible and beneficial from RAN1\'s perspective.
>
> The power saving gain can be further evaluated in RAN1. Impacts of skipping
> paging for UE in RRC_INACTIVE to the core network could be evaluated with
> SA2 involved in the WI phase.
### 6.4.3 Summary of evaluations for low power high accuracy positioning
The methodology for the evaluation of Low Power High Accuracy Positioning
(LPHAP) can be found in Annex A.4.
Evaluations of baseline Rel-17 RRC_INACTIVE state positioning with the

From evaluations for a LPHAP device, it is observed that the existing Rel-17
positioning procedures for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state cannot satisfy the target
battery life required by LPHAP use case 6 for majority of the evaluation
scenarios that are examined.

out of 19 sources, the following is observed:
\- Results with extended DRX cycle beyond 10.24s provide power saving gains
with respect to that with the baseline DRX cycle of 1.28s and is beneficial
towards meeting the battery life requirement as extended DRX cycle beyond
10.24s allows a UE to remain in a deeper sleep state for a longer duration.
\- From the evaluations,
\- Power saving gains achieved with extended DRX cycle with respect to
baseline DRX cycle 1.28s are provided by 2 sources ([93], [103]):
\- In [93], 87%\~90% power saving gains are achieved with DRX cycle of 30.72s
with respect to that with the baseline DRX cycle of 1.28s.
\- In [103], 35.05%\~53.70% power saving gains are achieved with DRX cycle of

6\~12 months is achieved by 12 sources in some cases.
Evaluation results of UE (re)entering RRC_CONNECTED state to obtain SRS
(re)configuration for UL/DL+UL positioning are provided by 7 sources ([92],
[93], [94], [99], [101], [103], [109], [110]) out of 19 sources, the following
is observed:
\- UE (re)entering RRC_CONNECTED state to obtain SRS (re)configuration
increases power consumption, and results without SRS (re)configuration
procedure provide power saving gains with respect to that with (re)entering
RRC_CONNECTED state to obtain SRS (re)configuration.
\- From the evaluations,
\- In [92], 65.2790% of total power is consumed by SRS (re)configuration for
UL positioning; UE (re)entering RRC_CONNECTED state to obtain SRS
(re)configuration increases the power consumption by 3 times.
\- In [93], UE (re)entering RRC_CONNECTED state to obtain SRS
(re)configuration every 10.24s/20.48s/40.96s increases the power consumption
by 8.71%/4.47%/2.23% with DRX cycle of 1.28s and by 13.38%/6.69%/3.34% with
DRX cycle of 10.24s.
\- In [94], 23.81%\~52.62% of total power is consumed by SRS (re)configuration
for UL positioning, and 21.65%\~26.54% of total power is consumed by SRS
(re)configuration for DL+UL positioning.
\- In [101], 11.6%\~34.4% of total power is consumed by SRS (re)configuration
for UL positioning with ultra-deep sleep state option 1 with additional
transition energy 10000, and 46.2%\~77.5% of total power is consumed by SRS
(re)configuration for UL positioning with ultra-deep sleep state option 2.
\- In [103], 11.28%\~52.41% of total power is consumed by SRS
(re)configuration for UL positioning; Without SRS (re)configuration procedure,
55.07%/20.38%/11.85% power saving gains are achieved for DRX cycle of
1.28s/10.24s/20.48s.

Evaluation results of minimized gaps between
PRS/SRS/paging/reporting/synchronization are provided by 10 sources ([92],
[93], [96], [98], [101], [102], [103], [108], [109], [110]) sources out of 19
sources, the following is observed:
\- Minimizing gaps between PRS/SRS/paging/reporting/synchronization reduces
power consumption, and results with minimized gaps between
PRS/SRS/paging/reporting/synchronization provide power saving gains with
respect to that without minimized gaps.
\- From the evaluations,
\- Comparative results with and without optimization of minimized gaps between
PRS/SRS/paging/reporting/synchronization are provided by 3 sources ([102],
[103], [110]):
\- In [102], 8%\~35% and 12.7%\~44.5% power saving gains are achieved for DRX
cycle 1.28s and 13.2% and 34% power saving gains for DRX cycle 10.24 sec, with
minimized gaps between PRS/SRS/paging/reporting/synchronization with sleep
states in TR 38.840 and ultra-deep sleep state option 1 with additional
transition energy 10000.
\- In [103], 5.48%\~15.59%, 1.05%\~3.60%, and 0.54%\~1.96% power saving gains
are achieved with minimized gaps between
PRS/SRS/paging/reporting/synchronization for DRX cycle 1.28s, 10.24s, and
20.48s with sleep states in TR 38.840; 17.14%\~33.33% power saving gains are
achieved with minimized gaps between PRS/SRS/paging/reporting/synchronization
for DRX cycle of 20.48s with ultra-deep sleep option 1.
\- Results on battery life of assuming minimized gaps between
PRS/SRS/paging/reporting/synchronization together with DRX cycle equal to or
larger than 10.24s and ultra-deep sleep state are provided by 10 sources
([92], [93], [96], [98], [101], [102], [103], [108], [109], [110]), and the
target requirement of 6\~12 months is achieved by 9 sources.
Results of paging and/or PEI triggered positioning are further provided by 2
sources ([101], [108]) based on minimized gaps, which is beneficial to improve
battery life as it allows a UE to perform positioning measurement and/or
reporting behaviors:
\- In [101], PEI triggered positioning improves battery life by 0.24\~1.64
months, for DRX cycle 10.24s, with multiple ultra-deep sleep state options.
\- In [108], paging triggered positioning improves battery life by 0.08
(6.02%) \~0.17 (7.98%) months for DL positioning, and by 0.02 (1.71%)\~0.05
(1.96%) months for UL positioning; PEI triggered positioning improves battery
life by 0.09 (6.77%) \~0.62 (29.11%) months for DL positioning, and by 0.04
(2.90%) \~0.47 (20.61%) months for UL positioning, for DRX cycle 10.24s and
20.48s, and ultra-deep sleep state option 1 with additional transition energy
10000.
Results on battery life of skipping paging reception are further provided by 1
source ([92] out of 19 sources, configuring a DRX cycle longer than
positioning periodicity (up to 81.92s) or without paging reception can achieve
44.32%\~89% power saving gain and is beneficial to improve battery life as it
allows a UE to wake up using ultra-deep sleep state option 2 when only
performing positioning related operations to achieve the target requirement of
LPHAP. When UE wakes up to perform other operations than just positioning
related operations, the UE uses ultra-deep sleep state option 1.
Results of only using TRS-based synchronization in adjacent slot to SRS is
further provided by 1 source ([92]) under ultra-deep sleep state option 2
without paging reception, which achieves 23.33% power saving gain and further
improves battery life with respect to that using SSB-based synchronization for
UL positioning.
Evaluation results of simplified PRS configuration on both battery life and
accuracy are provided by 1 source ([101]) out of 19 sources, the following is
observed:
\- In the case of K=1, C2=800, DRX cycle = 10.24s with ultra-deep sleep option
2, 1-symbol PRS can satisfy 6-month battery life but more than 1 symbol PRS
cannot.
\- The positioning accuracy of 1-symbol PRS and comb size > 12 barely reduces
and can meet the accuracy requirement in some cases.

### 6.4.4 Potential specification impact for low power high accuracy
positioning
Extending DRX cycle beyond 10.24s was studied and found beneficial towards
meeting the battery life requirement for LPHAP and is recommended for
normative work on Rel-18 positioning enhancements from RAN1\'s perspective.
> NOTE: No RAN1 specification impact has been identified.
For UL and DL+UL positioning for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state, the details of
solutions for enhancements on SRS for positioning to avoid frequent RRC
connection for SRS (re)configuration can be further discussed during normative
work, which may include but are not limited to one or combinations of the
following:
\- SRS for positioning configurations in multiple cells.
\- NOTE: Details including issues such as interference, timing advance,
spatial relation information, pathloss reference and common SRS parameters
across multiple cells can be further discussed during normative work.
\- Pre-configuration of one or multiple SRS for positioning configurations.
\- SRS for positioning activation/request procedure(s).
In addition to the above, specification impact can be expected from the
perspective of higher layers to support the potential enhancements for LPHAP
as detailed in Clause 6.4.2.2.
## 6.5 Positioning of UEs with reduced capabilities
### 6.5.0 Study objectives
The scope of the study on positioning for RedCap UEs is defined in the SID [7]
as:
\- Evaluation of positioning performance of existing positioning procedures
and measurements with RedCap UEs.
\- Based on the evaluations, assessment of the necessity of enhancements and,
if needed, identification of enhancements to help address limitations
associated with RedCap UEs.
For the purpose of the study of positioning performance for UEs with Reduced
Capabilities (RedCap UEs), the following target performance requirements are
considered:
For commercial use cases for both indoor and outdoor scenarios
\- Horizontal positioning accuracy: (\ NOTE: Sources used different combinations of number of hops, gap size
> between hops and partial overlap sizes in their evaluations.
Regarding the performance for positioning of Redcap UEs using Rx hopping for
reception of the DL PRS or Tx hopping for transmission of the UL SRS in IIoT
or commercial scenarios, considering time gap between hops together with UE
speed:
\- In FR1, for InF-SH based on the results provided by the following sources:
\- For UL-TDOA, results in [111] shows that the horizontal accuracy
requirement can be met for a gap of 140us for UE speed of up to 120km/h.
\- For DL-TDOA, results in [113] shows that the horizontal accuracy
requirement can be met for a gap of 2 or 4 ms for UE speed of up to 30km/h,
and cannot be met for 60km/h.
\- For DL-TDOA, results in [118] shows that the requirement can be met for a
gap of 0.1ms for UE speed of up to 150km/h; the horizontal accuracy
requirement can be met for a gap of 0.2ms for UE speed of up to 60km/h; the
horizontal accuracy requirement can be met for a gap of 0.5ms for UE speed of
up to 30km/h; the horizontal accuracy requirement can be met for a gap of 1ms,
2ms, 5ms for UE speed of up to 3km/h.
\- In FR1, for UMi, based on the results provided by the following sources:
\- For multi-RTT, results in [128] shows that the requirement for commercial
scenarios cannot be met, but performance of frequency hopping with 5 hops and
640 µsec switching gap degrades only marginally for speeds of 30 or 60 kmh
over 3 km/h.
In FR1, for InF-SH, the performance of carrier phase positioning with RedCap
UEs using 20MHz of bandwidth was evaluated without modeling the agreed error
sources. Based on the reported results the following observations are made:
\- Results in [113] shows that with an estimated integer ambiguity, a redcap
UE using CPP cannot meet the IIOT requirements.
\- Results in [113], [114] show that a redcap UE using CPP can meet the IIOT
requirement under ideal conditions and known integer ambiguity.
\- Results in [118] shows that a redcap UE using CPP cannot meet the IIOT
requirements with a fixed search range of integer ambiguity.
\- Results in [127] shows that a redcap UE using CPP can meet the IIOT
requirements, under some conditions for integer ambiguity resolution.
\- Results in [128] shows that a redcap UE using phase-difference AoD improves
performance over RSRPP-based AoD but cannot meet the IIoT requirements.
\- Results in [132] shows that a redcap UE using CPP can meet the IIOT
requirements if frequency hopping enhancements are also used and cannot meet
the IIOT requirements without enhancements.
### 6.5.3 Potential specification impact for positioning for RedCap UEs
From RAN1\'s perspective, the following have been identified for potential
specification impact to support NR positioning for RedCap UEs:
\- Maximum tolerable phase error, timing gap, and timing error between hops.
\- Considerations for IIoT, commercial, Public Safety and V2X scenarios, and
UE capabilities.
\- Details on the Tx or Rx hopping pattern(s), including frequency overlapping
between hops, if supported.
# 7 Conclusions
## 7.0 Study objectives
The scope of the Rel-18 study item on expanded NR positioning enhancements
included various aspects of positioning features in NR systems involving the
Uu and PC5 interfaces. These included sidelink (SL) positioning, including
evaluation of bandwidth requirements, and performance for absolute and
relative positioning, and ranging distance and angle determination;
positioning enhancements for improved integrity, accuracy, and power
efficiency via defining integrity characteristics for RAT-dependent
positioning, PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation, NR carrier phase positioning,
LPHAP; and support of positioning for UEs with Reduced Capabilities (RedCap
UEs).
Based on the studies conducted in RAN working groups, the following
conclusions are made.
## 7.1 Scenarios and requirements for sidelink positioning
Based on the study, the identified scenarios for the prioritized use-cases and

## 7.2 Bandwidth requirements for sidelink positioning
Performance evaluation results reported as part of the study indicate that,
depending on sources, use-cases, scenarios, assumptions, and positioning
methods used, the identified target requirements can be satisfied with
different values of SL PRS bandwidth choices.
\- For FR1 spectrum:
\- For certain sources and combinations of use-cases, scenarios, assumptions,
and positioning methods, some target requirements can be satisfied with SL PRS
bandwidths of 20 MHz or 40 MHz.
\- For certain sources and other combinations of use-cases, scenarios,
assumptions, and positioning methods, some target requirements require SL PRS
bandwidth of 100 MHz or may not be satisfied even with SL PRS bandwidth of 100
MHz.
\- For FR2 spectrum, based on submitted results from up to two sources:
\- For certain sources and combinations of use-cases, scenarios, assumptions,
and positioning methods, some target requirements can be satisfied with SL PRS
bandwidth of 200 MHz.
\- For certain sources and combinations of use-cases, scenarios, assumptions,
and positioning methods, some of the target requirements may not be satisfied
even with SL PRS bandwidth of 400 MHz.
From RAN1\'s perspective, it is recommended that SL PRS bandwidths of up to
100 MHz are supported by the specifications in FR1 spectrum.
NOTE: The above recommendations are based on the evaluations in licensed and
ITS spectra.
## 7.3 Sidelink positioning solutions
Sidelink positioning is recommended for normative work, including:
\- Sidelink positioning in-coverage, partial coverage and out-of-coverage
scenarios may be supported.
\- How to enable the procedures/signaling for supporting SL positioning in in-
coverage, partial coverage and out-of-coverage scenarios will be further
discussed in normative work.
\- Protocols between UE and UE
\- RAN2 will enable the support of SL PRS configuration in normative work
based on the progress in RAN1.
\- RAN2 will design protocol and procedures for SL positioning between UEs
(SLPP) in normative work.
\- Protocols between LMF and UE
\- RAN2 will discuss the details of functionalities of LMF for supporting SL
positioning in normative work.
\- RAN2 will discuss the protocol details to support sidelink positioning
procedures between UE and LMF in normative work.
For the solutions for sidelink positioning,
\- The following two operation scenarios are recommended for normative work:
\- Operation Scenario 1: PC5-only-based positioning.
\- Operation Scenario 2: Combination of Uu- and PC5-based positioning.
\- RTT-type solution(s) using SL, SL-AoA, and SL-TDOA are recommended for
normative work.
\- Both single-sided and double-sided RTT methods, striving to minimize the
changes needed on top of the specification support for single-sided RTT, if
any, for the introduction of double-sided RTT.
\- For SL-TDOA, DL-TDOA-like operation and UL-TDOA-like operation is
recommended for normative work.
\- For the support of the above methods the following measurements are
recommended for normative work:
\- SL PRS based Rx-Tx measurement
\- SL PRS based RSTD measurement
\- SL PRS based RSRP measurement
\- SL PRS based RSRPP measurement
\- SL PRS based RTOA measurement
\- SL PRS based Azimuth of Arrival (AoA) and SL Zenith of Arrival (ZoA)
measurement.
\- A new sidelink reference signal (SL PRS) is recommended for normative work.
\- Such a reference signal should use a comb-based frequency domain structure
and a pseudorandom-based sequence where the existing sequence of DL-PRS should
be used as a starting point.
\- SCI can be used for reserving/indicating one or more SL PRS resources.
\- Both a resource allocation Scheme 1 and Scheme 2 is recommended for
normative work, where Scheme 1 corresponds to a network-centric operation SL
PRS resource allocation and Scheme 2 corresponds to UE autonomous SL PRS
resource allocation.
\- For resource allocation mechanism for SL PRS in Scheme 2, a sensing-based
resource allocation, or a random resource selection, or both, should be
introduced, where the legacy designs for UE autonomous resource allocation are
used as a starting point.
\- With regards to the SL PRS transmission, both dedicated resource pool and
shared resource pool with Rel-16/Rel-17/Rel-18 SL communication are
recommended for normative work.
\- For SL Positioning resource (pre-)configuration in a shared resource pool
with Rel-16/17/18 sidelink communication, backward compatibility with legacy
Rel-16/17 UEs should be ensured.
\- With regards to the power control for SL PRS at least Open Loop Power
Control (OLPC) is recommended for normative work.
\- Unicast, Groupcast (not including many to one) and Broadcast of SL PRS
transmission are recommended for normative work.
## 7.4 Integrity **for** RAT**-dependent positioning techniques**
Both UE-based and LMF-based integrity for RAT**-Dependent Positioning
Techniques** are recommended for normative work.
## 7.5 PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation
Conclusions on support of PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation from the studies
performed in RAN1 can be found in [2].
As part of the current study, PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation for intra-band
contiguous carriers is studied by RAN4. Based on the study, PRS/SRS bandwidth
aggregation for intra-band contiguous carriers is concluded as feasible for
single chain Tx/Rx architectures at both the UE and gNB.
The assumption for a single-chain Tx architecture is that PRS/SRS resources to
be aggregated are transmitted from a single Tx antenna.
PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation across PFLs for positioning measurements is
concluded as feasible from RRM perspective.
## 7.6 NR carrier phase positioning
Based on the study, it is concluded that it is feasible to use existing DL PRS
and SRS signals to obtain the carrier phase measurements for achieving a
horizontal accuracy of up to a few centimeters at least at 50% under certain
conditions, including the PRU(s) being located in LOS with TRP(s), and the
locations of the PRU(s) and TRPs known with centimeter-level accuracy, in the
agreed evaluation assumptions.
If NR CPP is introduced,
\- Existing DL PRS and UL SRS for positioning purpose are recommended as the
reference signals to enable positioning based on NR carrier phase measurements
for both UE-based and UE-assisted positioning.
\- New measurements are recommended to be introduced for supporting UE-based
and UE-assisted NR carrier phase positioning.
\- Multipath mitigation methods for the carrier phase positioning are
recommended to be introduced during normative work.
## 7.7 Low power high accuracy positioning
The study of Rel-18 LPHAP focused on the evaluation of whether the existing
Rel-17 positioning techniques for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state can support the
battery life and positioning requirements, and on the analysis of potential
enhancements to address any limitations for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE and/or
RRC_IDLE states, as outlined in Clause 6.4.
The target use case for LPHAP is studied and confirmed that the use case 6
defined by SA1 as the single representative use case. The performance
requirement of LPHAP use case 6 is defined, including horizontal accuracy,
positioning interval, and battery life. It is assumed that the target
horizontal positioning accuracy requirement on LPHAP of \ {width="1.2625in" | | | | > height="1. | | | | 1006944444444444in"} | | | | | | | | **NOTE: Alt 1 is | | | | assumed for | | | | evaluation of joint | | | | Uu/PC5 positioning, | | | | Alt 2 is assumed for | | | | evaluation of | | | | PC5-only | | | | positioning.** | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Deployment layout | - BSs are disabled | - BSs are disabled | | for relative | | (baseline), or | | positioning/ranging | - UE type RSU may | enabled (optional) | | | be disabled (as | | | | baseline) or enabled | - Companies to | | | (as optional) | report their | | | | assumptions | | | - If enabled, | | | | UE-type RSUs are | - UE type RSU may | | | uniformly located | be disabled or | | | with 200m spacing on | enabled (companies | | | both sides of | should report their | | | highway | assumption) | | | symmetrically. | | | | | - If enabled, UE | | | - Optional: | type RSU deployment | | | sta | follows the | | | ggered/unsymmetrical | description clause | | | UE-type RSU | A.1.3 in TR 36.885 | | | distribution like | [9]. | | | | | | | > {width="1.2625in" | companies can | | | > height="1. | provide additional | | | 1006944444444444in"} | RSU deployment, | | | | e.g., additional | | | | RSUs are added to | | | | RSU deployment in TR | | | | 36.885 [9]. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | BS Tx power | Macro BS: 49dBm | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | UE Tx power | Vehicle UE or UE | | | | type RSU: 23dBm | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | BS receiver noise | 5dB | | | figure | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | UE receiver noise | 9 dB | | | figure | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | UE dropping | UE dropping option A | | | | defined in clause | | | | 6.1.2 of TR 37.885 | | | | [8]: | | | | | | | | - UE dropping | | | | option A is used for | | | | the highway | | | | scenario: | | | | | | | | - Vehicle type | | | | distribution: 100% | | | | vehicle type 2. | | | | | | | | - Clustered | | | | dropping is not | | | | used. | | | | | | | | - Vehicle speed is | | | | 140 km/h in all the | | | | lanes as baseline | | | | and 70 km/h in all | | | | the lanes | | | | optionally. | | | | | | | | - UE dropping | | | | option A is used for | | | | the urban grid | | | | scenario: | | | | | | | | - Vehicle type | | | | distribution: 100% | | | | vehicle type 2. | | | | | | | | - Clustered | | | | dropping is not | | | | used. | | | | | | | | - Vehicle speed is | | | | 60 km/h in all the | | | | lanes. | | | | | | | | In the intersection, | | | | a UE goes straight, | | | | turns left, turns | | | | right with the | | | | probability of 0.5, | | | | 0.25, 0.25, | | | | respectively. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | UE antenna model | Description in | | | | clause 6.1.4 in TR | | | | 37.885 [8] is | | | | reused: | | | | | | | | - Vehicle UE option | | | | 1 is the baseline | | | | (Vehicle UE antenna | | | | is modelled in Table | | | | 6.1.4-8 and 6.1.4-9 | | | | in TR 37.885 [8]) | | | | | | | | - Vehicle UE option | | | | 2 (two panels) can | | | | be optionally | | | | selected by | | | | companies. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Channel model | Description in | | | | clause 6.2 in TR | | | | 37.885 is reused. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

# A.3 Evaluation methodology for NR carrier phase positioning
For evaluations of NR carrier phase positioning, the relevant evaluation
assumptions as in TR 38.855 [12] and TR 38.857 [2] are reused, with optional
modifications to the assumptions based on appropriate justification.
Evaluations for FR1 bands are considered as baseline while those for FR2 bands
are optional.
For modelling of error sources, the following may be considered:
\- Phase noise (FR2)
\- CFO/Doppler
\- Oscillator-drift
\- Transmitter/receiver antenna reference point location errors
\- Transmitter/receiver initial phase error
\- Phase center offset
**_NOTE: Other error sources are not precluded_**
**_NOTE: UE mobility can be considered in the evaluations_**
**_NOTE: one or more error sources can be evaluated jointly_**
**_NOTE: companies should provide the error sources model with their
evaluations_**
**_The impact of multipath will be considered as part of evaluations of NR
carrier phase positioning, and the methods of mitigating the impact of
multipath for the carrier phase positioning will be studied, if it is
considered necessary after the evaluation._**
**_The following multipath mitigation methods for the carrier phase
positioning, which include, but are not limited to, the following are to be
evaluated:_**
\- The methods of estimating the carrier phase of the first path
\- NOTE: Both time-domain and frequency-domain methods can be considered
\- LOS/NLOS/ Multi-path indication for the carrier phase measurements for
improving the accuracy of the position calculation
\- Rel-17 LOS/NLOS indicator can be used as the starting point
\- Measurements of the first path and additional paths
\- E.g., carrier phase measurements, timing measurements
\- Other channel information, such as RSRP/RSRPP, CIR/CFR, etc.
Further, the use of PRUs to facilitate NR carrier phase positioning can be
evaluated.
Table A.3-1 provides the assumptions for the evaluation of NR carrier phase
positioning.

For conversion between relative power unit and device battery lifetime to
identify any performance gaps, the following characterization is considered:
\- Battery life is used as the metric to identify the gap
$$T2 = \ \frac{P1 _T1_ K}{X}_\ \frac{C2}{C1}_ \ \frac{1}{P2}$$
$$\text{Gap}_{\text{BatLife}} = \ {T2}_{\text{req}} - T2$$
in which,
\- C1 is the battery capacity of the reference device
\- T1 is the battery life of the reference device
\- P1 = 50 is the relative power unit obtained based on the reference traffic
type
\- X is the percentage of the power consumed by the reference traffic type
\- C2 is the battery capacity of the LPHAP device
\- P2 is the evaluated relative power unit of the LPHAP device
\- T2_req is the target battery life of the LPHAP device
\- K is an implementation factor, K = 1 (baseline); K = 0.5, 2, 4 (optional)
NOTE: In the above model, the voltage is assumed to be the same for the
reference device and the LPHAP device.
NOTE: As the reference device and LPHAP device characteristics, and therefore
the parameter values of the model for determining battery life, is dependent
on implementation factors, manufacturer, design options and cost options, it
is up to individual company to evaluate the optional K values, and report the
corresponding parameter values.
Examples of these parameters are provided as in Table A.4-2.
