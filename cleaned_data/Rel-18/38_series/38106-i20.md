Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship between Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements
Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling the
test requirements specified in the conformance specification TS 38.115-1 [7]
or TS 38.115-2 [8].
The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 38.115-1 [7] and TS
38.115-2 [8] define test tolerances. These test tolerances are individually
calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to relax the minimum
requirements in this specification to create test requirements. For some
requirements, including regulatory requirements, the test tolerance is set to
zero.
The measurement results returned by the test system are compared - without any
modification - against the test requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation ITUâ€‘R M.1545 [6].
## 4.2 Conducted and radiated requirement reference points
### 4.2.1 _Repeater type 1-C_
For _repeater type 1-C_ , the requirements are applied at the repeater
_antenna connector_ (BS-side connector or UE-side connector) for downlink or
uplink for the configuration in normal operating conditions.
Figure 4.2.1-1: _Repeater type 1-C_ downlink and uplink interface
### 4.2.2 _Repeater type 2-O_
For _repeater type 2-O_ , the radiated characteristics are defined over the
air (OTA), where the operating band specific radiated interface is referred to
as the Radiated Interface Boundary (RIB). Radiated requirements are also
referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which the
OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement.

## 4.3 Repeater classes
### 4.3.1 Repeater class for downlink
The requirements in this specification apply to downlink Wide Area repeaters,
downlink Medium Range repeaters and downlink Local Area repeaters unless
otherwise stated. The associated deployment scenarios for each class are
exactly the same for repeater with and without connectors.
For _repeater type 1-C_ and _type 2-O_ , repeater downlink classes are defined
as indicated below:
> \- Wide Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
> Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
> to 35 m.
>
> \- Medium Range repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from
> Micro Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the ground
> equal to 5 m.
>
> \- Local Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
> Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
> to 2 m or from Femto Cell scenarios.
\- Note: The requirements in this specification for LA 1-C repeaters apply to
1-C repeaters with declared output power less than or equal to LA rated output
power limits as in table 6.2.1-1.
### 4.3.2 Repeater class for uplink
The requirements in this specification apply to uplink Wide Area repeaters and
uplink Local Area repeaters unless otherwise stated. The associated deployment
scenarios for each class are exactly the same for repeater with and without
connectors.
For _repeater type 1-C_ and _type 2-O_ , repeater uplink classes are defined
as indicated below:
\- Wide Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.
\- Local Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.
## 4.4 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements set by local and
regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances the regional requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.

## 4.6 Requirements for contiguous and _non-contiguous spectrum_
A spectrum allocation where a repeater operates can either be contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for repeater configured for both contiguous spectrum
operation and non-contiguous spectrum operation.
For repeater operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply at
the repeater _passband_ edges. For each such requirement, it is stated how the
limits apply relative to the repeater _gap between passbands_ and the _Inter-
passband gap_ respectively.
## 4.7 Requirements for repeater capable of multi-band operation
For multi-band connector or multi-band RIB, the RF requirements in clauses 6
and 7 apply separately to each supported operating band unless otherwise
stated. For some requirements, it is explicitly stated that specific additions
or exclusions to the requirement apply at multi-band connector(s), and multi-
band RIB(s) as detailed in the requirement clause. For repeater capable of
multi-band operation, various structures in terms of combinations of different
downlink and uplink implementations (multi-band or single band) with mapping
to one or more _antenna connectors_ for _repeater type 1-C_ in different ways
are possible. For multi-band connector(s) the exclusions or provisions for
multi-band apply. For single-band connector(s), the following applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, _operating band_ unwanted
emissions, ACLR, output intermodulation, ACRR and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to this _connector_ that is mapped to single-band.
\- If the repeater is configured for single-band operation, single-band
requirements shall apply to this _antenna connector_ configured for single-
band operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable repeater
are applicable. Single-band requirements are tested separately at the _antenna
connector_ configured for single-band operation, with all other _antenna
connectors_ terminated.
# 5 Operating bands

Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE) limits
for _repeater type 1-C_ DL are defined from Î”f~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_ up to Î”f~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_. The values of
Î”f~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1â€‘1 for the NR _operating bands_.
Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE) limits
for _repeater type 1-C_ UL are defined from Î”f~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported uplink _operating band_ up to Î”f~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of each supported uplink _operating band_. The values of
Î”f~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1â€‘2 for the NR _operating bands_.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification. In
addition, for _repeater type 1-C_ operating in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , the
requirements apply inside any _gap between passbands_. In addition, for a
_repeater type 1-C_ operating in multiple bands, the requirements apply inside
any _inter-passband_ _gap_.
_Limits_ are specified in the tables below, where:
\- âˆ†f is the separation between the _passband edge_ frequency and the nominal
-3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the _passband edge_ frequency and the
centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Î”f~OBUE~ outside the downlink
_operating band of repeater type 1-C DL and uplink operating band of repeater
type 1-C UL_ , where Î”f~OBUE~ is defined in tables 6.5.1-1 and 6.5.1-2.
\- âˆ†f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.
For a _multi-band connector_ inside any **_inter-passband_ _gaps_ with W~gap~
\ \- f_offset~max~ is equal to the _gap between passbands_ bandwidth minus
> half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.
>
> \- âˆ†f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
> measuring filter.
For Wide Area _repeater type 1-C_ , the requirements of either clause
6.5.3.2.1 (Category A limits) or clause 6.5.3.2.2 (Category B limits) shall
apply.
For Medium Range _repeater type 1-C_ , the requirements in clause 6.5.3.2.3
shall apply (Category A and B).
For Local Area _repeater type 1-C_ , the requirements of clause 6.5.3.2.4
shall apply (Category A and B).
The application of either Category A or Category B minimum requirements shall
be the same as for Transmitter spurious emissions in clause 6.5.4.
For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the operating band unwanted emissions
limits shall be applied to the sum of the emission power over all _antenna
connectors_ for _repeater type 1-C_.
In addition to, for the part of passband where there is no input signal at DL
input port, the requirements in Table 6.5.2.2-2 shall apply. In addition to,
for the part of passband where there is no input signal at UL input port, the
requirements in clause 6.5.3.2.6 shall apply.

##### 6.5.3.2.6 Minimum requirements inside passband with no UL input signal
The requirement is defined as a function of frequency offset from the edge of
some part of passband with non-zero input signal. The requirement is measured
as the ratio of the repeater output power in a zero-input basic unit to the
repeater output power in a non-zero input basic unit. Basic unit equal to
360KHz.
The average of the basic requirements over 10 sub-frames shall not exceed the
values specified in Table 6.5.3.2.6-1.

The following requirement may apply to Repeater for Band n41 and n90 operation
in Japan. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from
Î”f~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of the Repeater downlink operating band up
to Î”f~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the Repeater downlink operating
band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

* * *
2505 MHz -- 2535 MHz -42 dBm 1 MHz NOTE: This requirement applies for carriers
allocated within 2545-2645 MHz.
The following requirement may apply to repeater operating in 3.45-3.55 GHz in
Band n77 in certain regions. Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels
specified in table 6.5.4.2.3-11.

NOTE: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to
the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy,
sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the
measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the
measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement
bandwidth.
The following requirement may also apply to repeater operating in Band n54 in
certain regions. The level of emissions in the 1541 -- 1650 MHz band, measured
in measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.5.4.2.3-12 shall not exceed the
maximum emission levels P~EM,n54,a,~ P~EM,n54,b~, P~EM,n54,c~, P~EM,n54,d~,
P~EM,n54,e~ and P~EM,n54,f~ declared by the manufacturer.

Note: The regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC reference
document, 0007135419 are defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic
radiated power), which is dependent on both the repeater emissions at the
antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss).
The EIRP level is calculated using: P~EIRP~ = P~E~ + G~ant~ where P~E~ denotes
the repeater unwanted emission level at the antenna connector, G~ant~ equals
the repeater antenna gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above
provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance
with the regional requirement.
##### 6.5.4.2.3 Co-location with base stations and _repeater type 1-C_ Nodes
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS, IAB-DU, IAB-
MT and _repeater type 1-C_ receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850,
CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU, IAB-MT, or _repeater type
1-C_ are co-located with _repeater type 1-C_.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with same class.
The _minimum requirements_ are in table 6.5.4.2.3-1 for a _repeater type 1-C_.
Requirements for co-location with a system listed in the first column apply,
depending on the declared _repeater type 1-C_ class. For a _multi-band
connector_ , the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table
6.5.4.2.3-1 shall apply for each supported _operating band_.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in table 6.5.4.2.4-1 do not apply for the frequency
range extending Î”f~OBUE~ immediately outside the transmit frequency range of a
_repeater type 1-C_. The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a
single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum coupling loss. However, there
are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are
addressed in TR 25.942 [3].
NOTE 2: Table 6.5.4.2.3-1 assumes that two _operating bands_ , where the
corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case
of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical
area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.
### 6.5.5 Receiver spurious emissions
#### 6.5.5.1 General
The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the _antenna connector_. The
requirements only apply to _repeater type 1-C_ for TDD operation.
For each a _ntenna connectors_ on BS-side and UE-side supporting both RX and
TX in TDD, the requirements apply during the _transmitter OFF state_. For
_antenna connectors_ both BS-side and UE-side in FDD, the RX spurious
emissions requirements are superseded by the TX spurious emissions
requirements, as specified in clause 6.5.4.
For _multi-band_ _connectors_ that both transmit and receive in _operating
band_ supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are applicable during
the _TX OFF state_ , and are subject to exclusion zones in each supported
_operating band_.
For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of receiver spurious
emissions requirements over all _antenna connectors_ for _repeater type 1-C_
shall not exceed _minimum requirements_ defined in clause 6.5.5.2.
#### 6.5.5.2 Minimum requirements
The receiver spurious emissions requirements for _repeater type 1-C_ are that
for each _antenna connector,_ the power of emissions shall not exceed the
value specified in table 6.5.5.2-1.

## 6.6 Repeater Error Vector Magnitude
### 6.6.1 Downlink repeater error vector magnitude
#### 6.6.1.1 General
The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference
between the symbols provided at the input of repeater and the measured signal
symbols at the output of the repeater after the equalization by the
measurement equipment. This difference is called the error vector. Details
about how the repeater EVM is determined are the same as specified in TS
38.104 [2] Annex B for FR1. The repeater EVM result is defined as the square
root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power
expressed in percent.
The repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at an
input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum output
power to the minimum power level in table 6.6.1.1-1.

#### 6.6.1.3 Repeater EVM frame structure for measurement
The input signals for the repeater EVM requirement shall have the same frame
structure as defined for the BS is TS 38.104 [2].
### 6.6.2 Uplink repeater error vector magnitude
#### 6.6.2.1 General
The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform provided at the input of repeater and the measured waveform
at the output of the repeater. This difference is called the error vector.
Details about how the repeater EVM is determined are the same as specified in
TS 38.101-1 [13] Annex F for FR1. Before calculating the repeater EVM the
measured waveform is corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency
offset. Then the carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured waveform
before calculating the repeater EVM.
The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the repeater EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement
specified in TS 38.101-1 [13] clause 6.4.2.4. For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, the
repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT and IDFT as the square
root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power
expressed as a %. For CP-OFDM waveforms, the repeater EVM result is defined
after the front-end FFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error
vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %.
The basic repeater EVM measurement interval in one slot in the time domain.
The repeater EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbols that contains
an allowable power transient in the measurement interval, as defined in TS
38.101-1 [13] clause 6.3.3 for EVM for UE.
The repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at an
input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum output
power to the minimum power level in table 6.6.2.1-1.

## 6.7 Input intermodulation
### 6.7.1 General requirement
#### 6.7.1.1 General
The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the repeater to
inhibit the generation of interference in the _passband_ , in the presence of
interfering signals on frequencies other than the _passband_.
The following requirement applies for interfering signals depending on the
repeaters _passband_.
This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater during the
_transmitter ON state_.
There is no co-location input intermodulation requirement for LA 1-C repeaters
deployed in Femto cell scenario.
#### 6.7.1.2 Minimum requirement
For the parameters specified in table 6.7.1.2-1, the power in the _passband_
shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the repeater as
measured with 1 MHz measurement bandwidth, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.
The core requirement is applicable for all frequency separation possibilities
between the two interfering signals that cause the 3rd order intermodulation
product to fall into the _passband_.
Table 6.7.1.2-1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals, where:
\- f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the first or
last channel in the _passband_ of the closer carrier.

### 6.7.2 Co-location with BS/repeater in other systems
#### 6.7.2.1 General
This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of NR repeater receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS or
repeater operating in a different frequency band are co-located with a NR
repeater.
The following requirement applies for interfering signals depending on the
repeaters _passband_.
This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater. If the BS
side is declared to meet co-location requirements, then it should meet input
intermodulation co-location requirements for the downlink. If the UE side is
declared to meet co-location requirements, then it should meet input
intermodulation co-location requirements for the uplink.
#### 6.7.2.2 Minimum requirement
For the parameters specified in table 6.7.2.2-1 for DL and 6.7.2.2-2 for UL,
the power in the _passband_ shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the
output of the repeater as measured with 1MHz measurement bandwidth, compared

## 6.8 Output intermodulation
6.8.1 General
The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of the
repeater to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear elements
caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
repeater via the output port. The requirement shall apply during the
_transmitter ON period_ and the _transmitter transient period_.
The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of the Repeater.
For _repeater type 1-C_ , the output intermodulation level is the power of the
intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the
_antenna connector_.
6.8.2 Minimum requirements for _repeater type 1-C_
6.8.2.1 Minimum requirements
The output intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation products
when an interfering signal is injected into the output port. The wanted signal
_passband_ shall be the maximum bandwidth supported by the repeater.
For _repeater type 1-C_ , the wanted signal and interfering signal centre
frequency is specified in table 6.8.2.1â€‘1, where interfering signal level is
_rated total output power_ (P~rated,t,AC~) at _antenna connector_ in the
_passband_ \-- 30 dB.
The unwanted emission with output intermodulation applied shall not exceed the
corresponding uplink and downlink unwanted emission limits in clause 6.5 in
the presence of an interfering signal according to table 6.8.2.1-1. The
measurement may be limited to frequencies on which third and fifth order
intermodulation products appear, considering the width of these products.

## 6.9 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
### 6.9.1 General
Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the average gain over
a carrier of the repeater in the _passband_ to the average gain of the
repeater over an adjacent channel outside the repeater _passband_. The carrier
in the _passband_ and in the adjacent channel shall be of the same type
(reference carrier) with bandwidths as defined by _nominal channel bandwidth_.
The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of the Repeater, where
the donor link is maintained via antennas (wireless Repeater).
The requirement is differentiated between uplink and downlink.
The requirement shall apply during the _transmitter ON state_.

## 6.10 Transmit ON/OFF power
### 6.10.1 Transmitter OFF power
#### 6.10.1.1 General
Transmit OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation of the repeater.
The requirement applies to both downlink and uplink of the repeater.
Transmitter OFF power is defined as the mean power measured over 70/N us
filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the _passband bandwidth_
of the repeater (BW~passband~) centred on the assigned channel frequency
during the _transmitter OFF state_. N = SCS/15, where SCS is Sub Carrier
Spacing in kHz of the input signal.
For _multi-band connectors_ and for _single band connectors_ supporting
transmission in multiple _operating bands_ , the requirement is only
applicable during the _transmitter OFF state_ in all supported _operating
bands_.
#### 6.10.1.2 Minimum requirement for _repeater type 1-C_
For _repeater type 1-C downlink_ , the requirements for transmitter OFF power
spectral density shall be less than -85 dBm/MHz per _antenna connector_.
For _repeater type 1-C uplink_ , the requirements for transmitter OFF power
spectral density shall be less than -50dBm / (SCS*(12*N~RB~+1)/1000) MHz per
_antenna connector,_ where SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.
### 6.10.2 Transmitter transient period
#### 6.10.2.1 General
_Transmitter transient period_ requirements apply only to TDD operation of the
repeater. The requirement applies to both downlink and uplink of the repeater.
The _transmitter transient state_ is the time period during which the
transmitter is changing from the _transmitter OFF state_ to the _transmitter
ON state_ or vice versa. The _transmitter transient period_ is illustrated in
figure 6.10.2.1-1.
{width="4.842592957130359in" height="2.317315179352581in"}
Figure 6.10.2.1-1: Example of relations between transmitter ON period,
transmitter OFF period and _transmitter transient period_
For _repeater type 1-C_ this requirement shall be applied at the _antenna
connector_ supporting transmission in the _operating band_. The beginning and
end point of downlink and uplink bursts are referenced to the slot timing at
the input.
#### 6.10.2.2 Minimum requirement for _repeater type 1-C_
For _repeater type 1-C_ , the _transmitter transient period_ shall be shorter
than the values listed in the minimum requirement table 6.10.2.2-1.

# 7 Radiated characteristics
## 7.1 General
Radiated characteristics are specified at RIB for _repeater type 2-O_.
Requirements apply in both DL and UL unless otherwise stated or declared.
## 7.2 OTA output power
### 7.2.1 General
_Repeater type 2-O_ are declared to support one or more beams, as per
manufacturer\'s declarations specified in TS 38.115-2 [8]. Radiated transmit
power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam at a specific _beam
peak direction_.
For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam identity,
_reference beam direction pair_ , beamwidth, _rated beam EIRP_ , _OTA peak
directions set_ , the _beam direction pairs_ at the maximum steering
directions and their associated _rated beam EIRP_ and beamwidth(s).
For a declared beam and _beam direction pair_ , the _rated beam EIRP_ level is
the maximum power that the repeater is declared to radiate at the associated
_beam peak direction_.
For each _beam peak direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within
the _OTA peak directions set_ , a specific _rated beam EIRP_ level may be
claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy requirement as
described below. _Rated beam EIRP_ is only required to be declared for the
_beam direction pairs_ subject to conformance testing as detailed in TS
38.115-2 [8].
NOTE 1: _OTA peak directions set_ is set of _beam peak directions_ for which
the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The _beam peak
directions_ are related to a corresponding contiguous range or discrete list
of _beam centre directions_ by the _beam direction pairs_ included in the set.
NOTE 2: A _beam direction pair_ is data set consisting of the _beam centre
direction_ and the related _beam peak direction._
NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer for
verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the manufacturer to
the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment and is not subject to
formal conformance testing.
For _pass bands_ where the supported _fractional bandwidth_ (FBW) is larger
than 6%, two rated beam EIRP may be declared by manufacturer:
\- P~rated,out,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and
\- P~rated,out,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.
For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated beam EIRP is:
\- P~rated,out,FBWlow,~ for the output whose frequency is within frequency
range F~FBWlow~ â‰¤ f \ | | | | | | | 100 MHz. | | | | | | +----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+

### 7.5.3 OTA operating band unwanted emissions
#### 7.5.3.1 General
The OTA limits for operating band unwanted emissions are specified as TRP per
RIB unless otherwise stated.
In addition to, for the part of passband where there is no input signal,
-13dBm/MHz shall apply for all classes DL and UL.
#### 7.5.3.2 Minimum requirement for _repeater type 2-O_
##### 7.5.3.2.1 General
The requirements of either clause 7.5.3.2.2 (Category A limits) or clause
7.5.3.2.3 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of either Category
A or Category B limits shall be the same as for General OTA transmitter
spurious emissions requirements (_repeater type 2-O_) in clause 7.5.3.3.2. In
addition, the limits in clause 7.5.3.2.4 may also apply.
Out-of-band emissions in FR2 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits.
For _repeater type 2-O_ , unless otherwise stated, the OTA operating band
unwanted emission limits in FR2 are defined from Î”f~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_ up to Î”f~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_.
The values of Î”f~OBUE~ are defined in table 7.5.1-1 for the NR _operating
bands_.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification. For
a _RIB_ operating in contiguous CA, the requirements apply to the frequencies
(Î”f~OBUE~) starting from the edge of the _passband._ In addition, for a _RIB_
operating in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , the requirements apply inside any
_gap between passbands_.
Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables below,
where:
\- âˆ†f is the separation between the _passband_ edge frequency and the nominal
-3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the _passband_ edge.
\- f_offset is the separation between the _passband_ edge frequency and the
centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Î”f~OBUE~ outside the downlink
_operating band_ , where Î”f~OBUE~ is defined in table 7.5.1-1.
\- âˆ†f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.
In addition, inside any _gap between passbands_ for a _RIB_ operating in _non-
contiguous spectrum_ , emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the
_limits_ specified for the adjacent _sub-blocks_ on each side of the _gap
between passbands_. The _limit_ for each _sub-block_ is specified in clauses
7.5.3.2.2 and 7.5.3.2.3 below, where in this case:
\- âˆ†f is the separation between the _sub-block_ edge frequency and the nominal
-3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the _sub-block_ edge.
\- f_offset is the separation between the _sub-block_ edge frequency and the
centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is equal to the _gap between passbands_ bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.
\- âˆ†f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.
##### 7.5.3.2.2 OTA operating band unwanted emission limits (Category A)
_Repeater type 2-O_ unwanted emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels
specified in tables 7.5.3.2.2â€‘1 and 7.5.3.5.2-2.
