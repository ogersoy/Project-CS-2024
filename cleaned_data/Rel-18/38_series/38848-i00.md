# Introduction
In recent years, IoT has attracted much attention in the wireless
communication world. More \'things\' are expected to be interconnected for
improving productivity efficiency and increasing comforts of life. Further
reduction of size, complexity, and power consumption of IoT devices can enable
the deployment of tens or even hundreds of billions of IoT devices for various
applications and provide added value across the entire value chain. It is
impossible to power all the IoT devices by battery that needs to be replaced
or recharged manually, which leads to high maintenance cost, serious
environmental issues, and even safety hazards for some use cases, for example,
wireless sensors in electrical power, and petroleum industries.
Most of the existing wireless communication devices are powered by batteries
that need to be replaced or recharged manually. The automation and
digitization of various industries opens numerous new markets requiring new
IoT technologies of supporting batteryless devices with no energy storage
capability or devices with energy storage that do not need to be replaced or
recharged manually.
An example type of application is asset identification, which presently has to
resort mainly to barcodes and RFID in most industries. The main advantage of
these two technologies is the ultra-low complexity and small form factor of
the tags. However, the limited reading range of a few meters usually requires
handheld scanning which leads to labor intensive and time-consuming
operations, or RFID portals/gates which leads to costly deployments. Moreover,
the lack of interference management scheme results in severe interference
between RFID readers and capacity problems, especially in case of dense
deployment. It is hard to support a large-scale network with seamless coverage
for RFID.
In contrast, this study investigates the feasibility of a new IoT technology
to open new markets within 3GPP systems, whose number of connections and/or
device density can be orders of magnitude higher than existing 3GPP IoT
technologies, and which can provide complexity and power consumption orders-
of-magnitude lower than existing 3GPP LPWA technologies such as NB-IoT and
LTE-MTC.
# 1 Scope
The present document reports on the feasibility of meeting the design targets
for relevant use cases of a new 3GPP IoT technology, on the basis of suitable
deployment scenarios in a 3GPP system, which relies on ultra-low complexity
devices with ultra-low power consumption for very-low end IoT applications. It
intends to provide a clear differentiation**, i.e. addressing use cases and
scenarios that _cannot_ otherwise be fulfilled based on existing 3GPP LPWA IoT
technology.**
In terms of energy storage, the study considers the following device
characteristics:
\- Pure batteryless devices with no energy storage capability at all, and
completely dependent on the availability of an external source of energy.
\- Devices with limited energy storage capability that do not need to be
replaced or recharged manually.

# 4 Deployment scenarios, use cases, services
## 4.1 Use cases/services
### 4.1.1 Representative use cases
Two sets or levels of grouping were defined. The first, Grouping A, is on the
basis of the deployment environment(s) described for a use case in TR 22.840
[2], and the second, Grouping B, is on the basis of functionality/application
described in TR 22.840 [2].
Grouping A:
\- Indoor
\- Outdoor
\- Indoor/outdoor
Grouping B:
\- Inventory
\- Sensors
\- Positioning
\- Command
These two groupings are then used to form representative use cases (rUCs) as
follows, which are used in Clause 4.2 -- Deployment scenarios and connectivity
topologies.
\- rUC1: Indoor inventory
\- rUC2: Indoor sensors
\- rUC3: Indoor positioning
\- rUC4: Indoor command
\- rUC5: Outdoor inventory
\- rUC6: Outdoor sensors
\- rUC7: Outdoor positioning
\- rUC8: Outdoor command
This resulted in the following mapping from SA1 use cases and traffic
scenarios onto RAN rUCs:

### 4.2.1 Connectivity topologies
#### 4.2.1.0 Introduction
The following connectivity topologies for Ambient IoT networks and devices are
defined for the purposes of the study. In all these topologies, the Ambient
IoT device may be provided with a carrier wave from other node(s) either
inside or outside the topology. The links in each topology may be
bidirectional or unidirectional.
BS, UE, assisting node, or intermediate node could be multiple BSs or UEs,
respectively. The mixture of indoor and outdoor placement of such nodes is
regarded as a network implementation choice. Account would need to be taken of
potential impact on device or node complexity. In the connectivity topologies,
this does not imply the existence of multi-hop assisting or intermediate
nodes.

In Topology 1, the Ambient IoT device directly and bidirectionally
communicates with a basestation. The communication between the basestation and
the ambient IoT device includes Ambient IoT data and/or signalling. This
topology includes the possibility that the BS transmitting to the Ambient IoT
device is a different from the BS receiving from the Ambient IoT device.

In Topology 2, the Ambient IoT device communicates bidirectionally with an
intermediate node between the device and basestation. In this topology, the
intermediate node can be a relay, IAB node, UE, repeater, etc. which is
capable of Ambient IoT. The intermediate node transfers Ambient IoT data
and/or signalling between BS and the Ambient IoT device.
#### 4.2.1.3 Topology 3: BS â†” assisting node â†” Ambient IoT device â†” BS
{width="2.925196850393701in" height="1.968503937007874in"}

Figure 4.2.1.3-2: Topology 3 with uplink assistance
In Topology 3, the Ambient IoT device transmits data/signalling to a
basestation, and receives data/signalling from the assisting node; or the
Ambient IoT device receives data/signalling from a basestation and transmits
data/signalling to the assisting node. In this topology, the assisting node
can be a relay, IAB, UE, repeater, etc. which is capable of ambient IoT.
#### 4.2.1.4 Topology 4: UE â†” Ambient IoT device

## 4.3 Device categorization
Ambient IoT devices are characterized in the study according to their energy
storage capacity, and capability of generating RF signals for their
transmissions.
The study considers that a device has either:
\- No energy storage at all; or
\- Limited energy storage
Relying on these storage capacities, the study considers the following set of
Ambient IoT devices:
\- Device A: No energy storage, no independent signal
generation/amplification, i.e. backscattering transmission.
\- Device B: Has energy storage, no independent signal generation, i.e.
backscattering transmission. Use of stored energy can include amplification
for reflected signals.
\- Device C: Has energy storage, has independent signal generation, i.e.,
active RF components for transmission.
A limited energy storage can be different among implementations within Device
B or implementations within Device C, and different between Device B and
Device C. Such storage is expected to be order(s) of magnitude smaller than an
NB-IoT device would typically include.
Device A, B, and C are able to demodulate control, data, etc from the relevant
entity in RAN according to connectivity topology.

# 5 RAN design targets
## 5.1 Device power consumption
For Device A, the power consumption target during transmitting/receiving is â‰¤
1 Î¼W or â‰¤ 10 Î¼W,
For Device B, the target during transmitting/receiving is such that:
\- Device A power consumption â‰ª Device B power consumption \< Device C power
consumption; or
\- Device A power consumption â‰¤ Device B power consumption \< Device C power
consumption.
The device power consumption during transmitting/receiving for Device C is â‰¤ 1
mW to â‰¤ 10 mW.
## 5.2 Device complexity
For Device A, the complexity target is to be comparable to UHF RFID
ISO18000-6C (EPC C1G2).
For Device B, the target is such that:
\- Device A complexity \< Device B complexity \< Device C complexity.
For Device C, the complexity target is to be orders-of-magnitude lower than
NB-IoT.
## 5.3 Coverage
The coverage target for both DL and UL is represented by the maximum distance:
\- Between Ambient IoT device and basestation in Topology (1) and (3)
\- Between Ambient IoT device and intermediate or assisting node in Topology
(2) and (3), respectively
\- Between Ambient IoT device and UE in Topology (4).
Details relevant to the maximum distance such as sensitivity, BLER, transmit
power, etc. are for WG expertise to study further.
The design target of coverage is:
By indoor / outdoor, grouping different Devices into a range that WGs can sub-
select within
\- the maximum distance of 10 -- 50 m for indoor
\- the maximum distance of 50 -- 500 m for outdoor
NOTE: Different target values within these ranges may apply to different
devices A/B/C and deployment scenarios 1-5.
NOTE: If BS is present, then continuous coverage (from the device perspective)
based on a typical ISD between base stations is assumed. This does not imply
an assumption of any particular topology.
NOTE: For Device A & B, the emitter-to-tag distance should be reported as part
of the assessment.
## 5.4 User experienced data rate
The user experienced data rate target is, for the uplink and downlink, maximum
not less than 5 kbps, and minimum not less than 0.1 kbps.
## 5.5 Maximum message size
The design target of maximum message size is approximately 1000 bits to be
received by the Ambient IoT device, and approximately 1000 bits to be
transmitted from the Ambient IoT device, based on the maximum application
layer packet size.
RAN1/RAN2 can refine as needed for TB size design.
## 5.6 Latency
The one-way end-to-end maximum latency targets, as defined in TR 22.840, are:
\- Longer latency target: 10 seconds
\- Shorter latency target: 1 second
A use case is assigned to a latency target according to TR 22.840. RAN WGs can
refine a definition of latency suitable for their work within the above.
NOTE: The time for charging the Ambient IoT device storage (if present) is not
included in the latency defined above. Time for energy harvesting, charging,
etc. is regarded as an implementation issue only.
NOTE: The one-way end-to-end maximum latency is assumed to also include
query/triggering time.
## 5.7 Positioning accuracy
The design target of absolute positioning accuracy when performed by the
cellular network (including assisting nodes when present) is:
\- 1\~3 meters @ 90% indoor location.
\- Several tens of meters @ 90% outdoor location.
The design target of relative ranging accuracy for topology 4 is:
\- 1\~3 meters @ 90% indoor and outdoor location
## 5.8 Connection/device density
According to the consolidated potential KPIs in TR 22.840, the maximum
connection density target is:
\- 150 devices per 100 m^2^ for indoor scenarios.
\- 20 devices per 100 m^2^ for outdoor scenarios.
RAN WGs will define the 2D or 3D distribution(s) of devices.
## 5.9 Moving speed of device
The design target of moving speed of Ambient IoT device is 10 km/h, at least
for indoor scenarios.
NOTE: Absolute speed is used in Topology (1), (2) and (3). Relative speed is
used in Topology (4).
# 6 Comparison and assessment
6.1 Preliminary feasibility assessment
### 6.1.1 Device power consumption
Feasibility of power consumption for Device A at â‰¤1 Î¼W level has been reported
by reference to [3], [4], [5], [6], and at â‰¤ 10 Î¼W level by [7] depending on
component choices such as in [8]. Feasibility of power consumption for Device
C at â‰¤1 mW level has been reported by reference to [9], [10], [11], [12],
[13], and by reference in part to the receiver architectures discussed in the
Rel-18 SI on low-power wake up signal/receiver [14] [15] at â‰¤10 mW level. For
Device B, which adds energy storage to Device A and has been described as also
potentially including (without limitation), e.g. reflection amplification,
feasibility of power consumption in the order of hundreds of uW has been
reported by [7] depending on component choices such as in [16].
### 6.1.2 Device complexity
Feasibility assessment for this aspect was presented on a qualitative basis by
companies describing exemplary waveform, and/or transmitter, and/or receiver
architectures which, according to their analysis, would satisfy the device
power consumption design target. It was also observed that the amount of
energy storage could affect device complexity. Examples of considered
waveforms include OOK/FSK, and ASK. Examples of considered transmitter
architectures for Device A/B include those based on backscattering technology,
and receiver architectures based on envelope detection, while for Device C,
very low power consumption heterodyne/homodyne architectures were reported as
satisfying the complexity design target.
On the other hand, aspects such as the memory required for security,
authentication, etc., and hardware used for encryption processing would add to
the complexity of the device. There were also discussions of the quality
required in circuitry such as energy harvesting, backscattering, and PAs
which, as their efficiency increases, tend to have higher complexity.
Detailed analysis of designs which meet the device complexity requirement is
considered to require WG-level technical expertise.
### 6.1.3 Coverage
Feasibility of a coverage target was assessed by sources differently for
Devices A, B, C. In addition to typical elements comprising a 3GPP coverage
evaluation, such as BS/intermediate/assistant node transmit power and receive
sensitivity, device receiver sensitivity, propagation losses, etc. (which vary
according to the specific calculation method), aspects particular to Ambient
IoT devices were added. These include:
\- Device A/B backscattering activation power threshold
\- Device B amplification (if any)
\- Device A/B reflection loss
\- Distance from carrier wave source to Ambient IoT device, for Device A/B
\- Power of carrier wave source and/or incident power at Device A/B from
carrier wave source
Although different evaluation methodologies were adopted by sources [17] --
[25], the coverage of Device A is reported as less than Device B (with or
without amplification), which is less than Device C. The coverage of Ambient
IoT devices relying on backscattering technology was reported to increase as
the carrier wave source gets closer to the Ambient IoT device, due to the
higher incident power on the device.
### 6.1.4 User experienced data rate
Full user-experienced data rate assessment was noted as requiring WG-level
technical expertise, and detailed assumptions on air interface design. For
TSG-level purposes, companies used simplified approximants. Peak data rate was
one such approximant, where companies reported values above 5 kbps for uplink
and downlink to be achievable according to various sets of assumptions
including sufficient bandwidth, and in one case noted that the components
assumed by reference to [26] would need further investigation whether the
device power consumption target could be simultaneously met. One source [17]
estimated data rate by accounting for device charging time and operation time,
resulting in data rates 0.14 -- 2.24 kbps for uplink and downlink.
### 6.1.5 Maximum message size
Companies' study of the feasibility of this design requirement was by
reference to e.g. RFID which supports message sizes larger than about 1000
bits. It was also observed that the different Devices could be regarded as
feasible for different maximum message sizes.
### 6.1.6 Latency
Feasibility of latency was reported typically by comparing a message size to a
data rate, for example 5 kbps / 1000 bit = 200 ms latency for the largest
message size at the target peak rate. Feasibility would also depend on a
consideration of signalling procedures and possible random access-like
procedure.
### 6.1.7 Positioning accuracy
Feasibility assessment for this aspect has been reported by reference to
technologies of a similar complexity level, such as UHF RFID achieving 2-3 m
accuracy in [27], [28], [29] indoors, and ultra-narrow IoT achieving from
several tens to 100 or 150 m in [30], [31], [32] outdoors. It is also observed
that Device A and B need to have a carrier wave source in an appropriate
distance to be able to transmit signals for positioning.
### 6.1.8 Connection/device density
Feasibility of the target was discussed from the basis of assuming cell access
procedures, and device addressing. It was discussed as applying a requirement
on the design of such procedures, identities, etc. rather than being a matter
for feasibility assessment before starting such designs.
### 6.1.9 Moving speed of device
The feasibility aspects that were reported related to the impact of Doppler
shift or channel coherence on the possible types of modulation contemplated by
companies for especially Device A and B. It was observed, without limiting RAN
WG design scope, that at least for low-order non-OFDM modulation, Doppler
impacts at the low moving-speed level implied in Clause 5.9 would likely be
acceptable, although the impact on transmission times potentially a multiple
of the coherence time should also be studied in RAN WGs.
## 6.2 Required RAN functionalities
The assumptions on required functionality have been studied on the basis of
supporting certain RAN design targets as well as other requirements. At least
the following potential functionalities are identified in different sets,
respectively, according to the purpose of each functionality assumed to be
mainly used for. An entry in the tables below neither implies nor precludes
RAN specification impact.

# 7 Conclusions and recommendations
## 7.1 Summary
The study has described eight rUCs in RAN, being indoor/outdoor for each of
inventory, sensors, positioning, and command. These rUCs encompass the UCs or
traffic scenarios from TR 22.840 as shown in Table 4.1-1.
Four general connectivity topologies were studied in Clause 4.2.1: BS â†”
Ambient IoT device, BS â†” intermediate node â†” Ambient IoT device, BS â†”
assisting node â†” Ambient IoT device â†” BS, and UE â†” Ambient IoT device.
Three devices were studied: Device A, B, and C, differentiated according to
inclusion of backscattering transmission or independent signal generation, and
inclusion or not of energy storage.
Together with other characteristics, the topologies and devices were used to
study deployment scenarios for Ambient IoT, shown in Clause 4.2.2,
differentiated according to whether the device and basestation/UE-based reader
are respectively indoors or outdoors.
A set of RAN design targets were developed, complementary to, and/or derived
from, the requirements reported in TR 22.840, in Clause 5. Further details of
these targets are assumed to be provided by WG-level expertise.
A non-exclusive list of functionalities needed in Ambient IoT from the RAN
perspective was formulated on the basis of supporting the RAN design targets,
and for supporting other requirements. The study has not investigated in
detail the implication of CN-related functionalities.
Finally, a preliminary feasibility assessment was conducted on the basis of
the set of design targets in Clause 5. This was by a mixture of reference to
external sources, characteristics of, or hardware used by, other technologies,
and companies' own analyses.
## 7.2 Recommendations
It is concluded in preliminary feasibility analysis at TSG-RAN level that
Ambient IoT is feasible and beneficial, and further WG-level study is
recommended prior to normative work.
For the initial WG-level study of Ambient IoT
\- RAN is recommended to down-select further starting from:
\- Deployment scenario 1 with Topology 1
\- Deployment scenario 2 with Topology 1
\- Deployment scenario 2 with Topology 2
\- Deployment scenario 4 with Topology 1
\- Deployment scenario 4 with Topology 3
\- FR1 licensed spectrum is recommended
\- Note: selection or prioritization between FDD and FDD/TDD is to be decided
\- RAN is recommended to down-select to one or more of:
\- Spectrum in-band to NR, in guard-band to LTE/NR, and in standalone band(s)
It is recommended to direct the RAN WGs to use the design targets reported in
Clause 5. The RAN WGs are expected to refine the design targets according to
their technical expertise, as needed.
