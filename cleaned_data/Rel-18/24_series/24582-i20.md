# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the media plane control protocols and
interactions with the media needed to support Mission Critical Data (MCData)
services, which are IP Connectivity, Short Data Service (SDS) and File
Distribution (FD).
Mission critical communication services are services that require preferential
handling compared to normal telecommunication services, e.g. in support of
police or fire brigade.
The MCData service and its associated media plane control protocols can be
used for public safety applications and also for general commercial
applications (e.g., utility companies and railways).
The present document is applicable to User Equipment (UE) supporting MCData
client functionality and to servers in the MCData system.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Overview
### 4.1.1 Short data service
The media plane control procedures, both for one-to-one and group short data
services, take place for on-network only, when standalone short data is sent
using media plane or when the short data is sent after an SDS session is
established. In both cases the media plane is established as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.282 [8].
The media plane uses the MSRP protocol as specified in RFC 4975 [11], RFC 4976
[14], RFC 6135 [12], and RFC 6714 [13].
In a standalone SDS using media plane, a single SDS message is sent by the
originating MCData client as specified in this document. The procedure is
terminated as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
When an SDS session is established any MCData client with appropriate
permissions, which participates this SDS session, can initiate the
transmission of and SDS message until the termination of the SDS session. The
termination of an SDS session is specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
An SDS message sent using media plane is carried in the body of an MSRP SEND
request. The media control parameters and the data of an SDS message are
carried in separate bodies in the same MSRP SEND request.
The Conversation ID,the Message ID, the optional InReplyTo message ID, the
optional SDS disposition request type and the optional Application identifier
are communicated by the MCData client which sends the SDS message in the media
control part of the body in the MSRP SEND request. The data is carried in a
separate body of the MSRP SEND request.
For standalone SDS using media plane, the disposition notification is
communicated as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
For SDS during an SDS session the disposition notification is communicated
using the procuderes specified in the current document until the SDS session
is terminated. After the termination of the SDS session the disposition
notification, if any, is communicated as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
### 4.1.2 File distribution
The media plane control procedures, both for one-to-one and group file
distribution using media plane, take place for on-network only. The media
plane for FD is established as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
The media plane uses the MSRP protocol as specified in RFC 4975 [11], RFC 4976
[14], RFC 6135 [12], and RFC 6714 [13].
A file is sent using media plane by the originating MCData client as specified
in this document. The procedure is terminated as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282
[8].
The Conversation ID , the Message ID, the optional InReplyTo message ID, the
optional FD disposition request type, the optional Application ID, the
optional Mandatory download and the optional Metadata are communicated by the
MCData client which sends the file using the procedures specified in 3GPP TS
24.282 [8] while establishing the media plane.
The file is carried in the body of the MSRP SEND request as specified in this
document.
The disposition notification is communicated as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282
[8].
### 4.1.3 Void
### 4.1.4 IP Connectivity
The media plane control procedures for one-to-one IP Connectivity service
using media plane, take place for on-network only. The media plane for IP
Connectivity is established and terminated as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
The media plane uses the IP protocol as specified in RFC 791 [21] and RFC 8200
[22].
The IP Connectivity media plane is established by the originating MCData
client as specified in this document.
IP Connectivity provides a media plane for exchange of any kind of IP data
between IP applications. Once the media plane is established along with IP
Connectivity the IP applications can exchange IP data.
NOTE IP Connectivity specified in the current document is not compatible with
release 16.
## 4.2 Other considerations
When an SDS message is sent using media plane, the body included in the MSRP
SEND request, which carries media control information or which carries
notification information, is protected between each entity separately if
protection is applied. On the other hand the body included in the MSRP SEND
request which carries the data is end to end protected. The procedures for the
protection of the media control information or notification or of the data are
specified in this document.
When a file is is sent using media plane, the file or file portion, included
in the body of the MSRP SEND request, is end to end protected. The procedure
for the protection of the file is specified in this document.
# 5 Functional entities
## 5.1 General for MCData functional entities
### 5.1.1 SDS and FD
Media plane control is conducted between the MCData server and MCData UE.
MCData server has capability functions for SDS and FD. MCData UE incorporates
the MCData client. MCData user or MCData user application may feed or consume
data transmitted or received via the capability functions in the MCData
client. The capability function in the MCData client provides SDS and FD
services.
The capability functions of the MCData server are specified for the
controlling MCData function and the participating MCData function. The
capability functions of the MCData UE are specified for the MCData client.
Data to be transmitted either by the MCData user or by a MCData user
application using media plane shall be transmitted by the MCData client to the
participating MCData function. The participating MCData function shall forward
the data to the controlling MCData function. The controlling MCData function
shall distribute the data to the destination MCData client for one-to-one
MCData service and to the MCData clients of the affiliated group members for
group MCData service via the participating MCData functions serving each
destination MCData client. A participating MCData function may serve one or
more MCData clients. Based on deployment, controlling MCData function may be
in communication with zero, one or more participating MCData functions. If a
participating MCData function is collocated with the controlling MCData
function, the controlling MCData function may perform the functions of this
co-located participating MCData function. In this case the controlling MCData
function and this co-located participating MCData function shall act as a
single entity.
In the media plane the MCData client and the controlling MCData function shall
act as MSRP clients. If and when a participating MCData function is in the
communication path as a separate entity between the controlling MCData
function and one or more MCData clients, it shall act as an MSRP relay.
### 5.1.2 IP Connectivity
IP Connectivity provides a media plane for exchange of any kind of IP data
between IP applications. These IP applications may reside on external non-3GPP
hosts connected via an IP interface to the MCData UE that incorporates the
MCData client, or they may be running on the MCData UE. The participating
MCData function and the controlling MCData functions may be in the path of the
data exchange between the authorized MC Data users.
## 5.2 Functional entities for SDS
The capability function for SDS for media plane in the MCData server is
composed of SDS distribution function and the Transmission/Reception control.
In the media plane the functions of SDS distribution and the
Transmission/Reception control are specified for the controlling MCData
function and the participating MCData function. The functions of the SDS are
specified for the SDS function in MCData client.
For SDS, data is composed of short data in the form of text, hypertext, binary
string or location information. Short data generated in the MCData client and
sent using media plane follows the path for the originating MCData client to
the terminating MCData clients as explained in clause 5.1.1.
## 5.3 Functional entities for FD
The capability function for FD for media plane in the MCData server is
composed of FD function and the Transmission/Reception control. The file
distribution over media plane functionalities in the MCData server are
specified for the controlling MCData function and the participating MCData
function. The functions of the FD are specified for the FD function in the
MCData client.
For FD, data is composed of a file. A file provided at the MCData client and
sent using media plane follows the path from the originating MCData client to
the terminating MCData clients as explained in clause 5.1.1.
## 5.4 Functional entities for IP Connectivity
For IP Connectivity, the transmitted data may consist of any kind of IP data.
IP Connectivity data sent by the MCData client using media plane follows the
path from the originating MCData client to the terminating MCData client as
explained in clause 5.1.2.
# 6 SDS media plane procedures
## 6.1 MCData client procedures
### 6.1.1 Standalone SDS via media plane
#### 6.1.1.1 General
In a standalone SDS via media plane, upon receiving an SDS request from the
user or user application the originating MCData client establishes the media
plane as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8]. When the media plane is established
a conversation ID is associated with this SDS message.
For the procedures in clause 6.1.1.2 it is assumed that it has been verified
that:
1\. if standalone one to one SDS using media plane is initiated:
a. the MCData client is allowed to transmit data;
b. the size of the SDS message is less than or equal to maximum amount of data
that the MCData user can transmit in a single request during one-to-one
communication; and
c. the size of the SDS message is less than or equal to maximum data size for
SDS;
2\. if standalone group SDS using media plane is initiated:
a. the MCData client is allowed to transmit data in this group;
b. the size of the SDS message is less than or equal to maximum amount of data
that the MCData user can transmit in a single request during group
communication;and
c. the size of the SDS message is less than or equal to maximum data size for
SDS; and3. the size of the short data including the media plane information
elements is larger than the allowed limits over MCData-SDS-1 interface using
SIP reference points.
before the media plane establishment is initiated as specified in 3GPP TS

## 6.5 SDS delivery using MBMS
### 6.5.1 General Description (non-normative)
The procedures for group SDS delivery using MBMS via the media plane can be
seen as extensions of the procedures for group SDS session delivery using
unicast. The procedures of the originating client, originating participating
function and controling function are those used for unicast session delivery
for group SDS. Only the terminating participating function and the terminating
client are involved in MBMS delivery functionality for group SDS.
The procedures assume that consistent with 3GPP TS 24.282 [8], an SDS session
has already been established and the originating and terminating MCData
clients have already completed successfully the SDP offer/answer negotiation.
It is further assumed that the terminating MCData participating function has
already sent an MBMS bearer announcement message providing information about
the MBMS bearer and subchannel intended for MBMS delivery and that the
terminating MCData client has received and processed the MBMS bearer
announcement message, as described in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
During the SDS session, the terminating MCData participating function
intercepts MSRP SEND messages arriving from the originating side, and, after
eliminating duplicates, encapsulates them unchanged as payload in
(S)RTP/UDP/IP (see IETF RFC 3711 [17]) packets and transmits them on an MBMS
bearer towards the terminating MCData client. Upon reception, the terminating
MCData client decapsulates the payload and processes it as an MSRP SEND
message within the SDS session, arriving from the originating side.
NOTE 1: Since MSRP chunking is supported for unicast delivery, it is also
supported for MBMS delivery.
NOTE 2: If SRTP (see IETF RFC 3711 [17]), rather than RTP, is used to security
protect packets sent on MBMS bearer, MuSiK (see 3GPP TS 24.482 [5] and 3GPP TS
33.180 [15]) may be employed to provide protection in addition to the security
mechanisms that protect the unicast MSRP traffic.
NOTE 3: Whether unicast or MBMS delivery are used is up to the terminating
participating function, which can use listening status reports from the MCData
clients, the presence or absence of the DELIVERED disposition in SDS, as well
as other information, to decide on an individual MCData client and SDS basis.
At any time during a session, the terminating participating server can toggle
between unicast and MBMS delivery.
### 6.5.2 Procedures for the terminating MCData client
#### 6.5.2.1 Handling the MSRP connection
The terminating MCData client shall execute the procedure for MSRP connection
establishment described in clause 6.1.2.3.1.
#### 6.5.2.2 Receiving Map Group To Bearer and Unmap Group To Bearer
While MBMS delivery is expected, the terminating MCData client shall monitor
the general purpose MBMS subchannel.
When receiving a Map Group To Bearer message over the general purpose MBMS
subchannel, the MBMS interface in the MCData client:
1) shall associate the TMGI in the TMGI field, the MBMS subchannel for media
with the MCData group identity in the MCData Group ID field; and
2) shall start or continue the procedure described in clause 6.5.2.3.
When receiving the Unmap Group To Bearer message referring to the current
communication over a MBMS subchannel, the MBMS interface in the MCData client:
1) shall remove the association between the TMGI, the MBMS subchannel for
media in the group session identified by the MCData Group ID field, if such an
association exists; and
2) shall cease monitoring the associated MBMS bearer and subchannel for media
and, if the SDS session is still ongoing, shall resume or continue SDS
delivery via media plane over unicast.
#### 6.5.2.3 Receiving media packets
The terminating MCData client shall:
1\. while MBMS delivery is expected, the terminating MCData client shall
monitor the MBMS bearer and subchannel indicated by the Map Group To Bearer
message; and
2\. for each received (S)RTP media packet, until a SIP BYE is received or
until an implementation dependent timeout occurs:
a. decapsulate the payload out of the (S)RTP packet and, if SRTP rather than
RTP is used (see IETF RFC 3711 [17]), decrypt and validate the payload;
b. if the media packet was received via an MBMS bearer with the TMGI
associated to the group, accept the payload as correctly destined for the
terminating MCData client, regardless of whether or not the Toâ€‘Path header of
the MSRP SEND message in the payload matches the terminating MCData client\'s
MSRP URI (i.e. the MSRP URI provided in the answer SDP to the controlling
function during the MSRP session establishment, in accordance with rules and
procedures of IETF RFC 4975 [11]); and
c. process the payload as a received MSRP SEND message according to clause
6.1.2.3.1, in the context of the media flow formed by previously received MSRP
SEND messages, whether delivered via unicast or via MBMS.
### 6.5.3 Procedures for the terminating MCData participating function
#### 6.5.3.1 Establishing MSRP session
The terminating MCData participating function:
1\. shall establish an MSRP session with the controlling MCData function
according to clause 6.2.2.5.1; and
2\. shall establish an MSRP session with the terminating MCData client
according to clause 6.2.2.5.2.
#### 6.5.3.2 Sending Map Group To Bearer and Unmap Group To Bearer
The terminating MCData participating function:
1\. shall build a Map Group To Bearer message (see clause 11.2.4) to include:
a. the TMGI of the MBMS bearer to carry the traffic;
b. the identifier of the media stream; and
c. the MCData Group identifier field; and
2\. shall send (repetitively, at short, implementation dependent time
intervals) the Map Group To Bearer message over the general purpose MBMS
subchannel.
When the session ends, the terminating MCData participating function shall
build the corresponding Unmap Group To Bearer message (see clause 11.2.5) and
shall send it over the general purpose MBMS subchannel.
#### 6.5.3.3 Receiving media packets intended for a terminating MCData client
When receiving an MSRP SEND message that the terminating participating server
considers qualified for MBMS delivery and is destined to one of the MCData
clients listening to the MBMS subchannel, the participating MCData function:
NOTE 1: An MSRP SEND message that does not qualify for MBMS delivery or is not
destined to an MCData client listening to the MBMS subchannel is handled as an
MSRP SEND message to be delivered over unicast (see clause 6.2.1.5.3).
1\. shall generate and send an MSRP 200 (OK) response for the received MSRP
SEND message to the controlling MCData function, according to the rules and
procedures of IETF RFC 4975 [11];
2\. shall check if the media packet that encapsulates the MSRP SEND message is
already sent over the MBMS subchannel or not;
3\. if the media packet is already sent over the MBMS subchannel, shall
discard the MSRP SEND message; and
4\. otherwise:
a. shall build an (S)RTP/UDP/IP (see IETF RFC 3711 [17]) media packet with the
IP address and UDP port number indicated in the sent Map Group To Bearer
message and with the received MSRP SEND message as payload, security protected
if SRTP is used, per IETF RFC 3711 [17] and 3GPP TS 33.180 [15]; and
b. shall transmit the built (S)RTP/UDP/IP packet on the MBMS bearer identified
by the TMGI indicated in the sent Map Group To Bearer message.
NOTE 2: To save over-the air resources, the terminating MCData participating
function releases or reduces the bandwidth of the unicast downlink bearers
used for unicast SDS delivery. However, to enable the ability of rapid
switching between unicast and MBMS delivery, the terminating MCData
participating function can keep the unicast bearers intact.
Upon receiving error MSRP responses (see IETF RFC 4975 [11]) from the
terminating MCData client, the terminating MCData participating function shall
forward the error MSRP responses towards the originating MCData client.
## 6.6 SDS delivery using MBS
All steps of clause 6.5 apply also for MBS, with the clarification that
terminology mapping specified in annex X applies.
# 7 FD media plane procedures
## 7.1 MCData client procedures
### 7.1.1 General
For file distribution, upon receiving a request from the user or user
application the originating client establishes the media plane as specified in
3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
The procedures in clause 7.1.2 and clause 7.1.3 are applicable for one-to-one
and group file distribution.
A MCData client which is not permitted to transmit data should not use the
procedure in clause 7.1.2.
### 7.1.2 Originating MCData client procedures
#### 7.1.2.1 Handling MSRP connection
Upon receiving an indication to establish MSRP connection for file
distribution as the originating client, the MCData client:
1\. shall act as an MSRP client according to IETF RFC 6135 [12];
2\. shall act according to IETF RFC 6135 [12], as:
a. an \"active\" endpoint, if a=setup attribute in the received SDP answer is
set to \"passive\"; and
b. an \"passive\" endpoint, if a=setup attribute in the received SDP answer is
set to \"active\";
3\. shall establish the MSRP connection according to the MSRP connection
parameters in the SDP answer received in the SIP 200 (OK) response according
to IETF RFC 4975 [11]; and
4\. if acting as an \"active\" endpoint, shall send an empty MSRP SEND request
to bind the MSRP connection to the MSRP session from the perspective of the
passive endpoint according to the rules and procedures of IETF RFC 4975 [11]
and IETF RFC 6135 [12].
On receiving MSRP 200 (OK) response to the first MSRP SEND request, the MCData
client can send the file. To send the file, the MCData client:
1\. shall generate MSRP SEND for file distribution request according to IETF
RFC 4975 [11]. When generating an MSRP SEND, the MCData client:
a. shall set To-Path header according to the MSRP URI(s) received in the
answer SDP;
b. shall set the Content-Type header field = to \"application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
file\"; and
c. shall include in the body of the MSRP SEND request the MSRP payload. The
MSRP payload is set to the file or part of the file.
2\. shall send the MSRP SEND request(s) on the established MSRP connection.
If MSRP chunking is used, the MCData client:
1\. shall send further MSRP SEND requests containing the file as necessary;
2\. shall wait for a 200 (OK) response to each MSRP SEND request sent; and
3\. on receipt of the last 200 (OK) response shall terminate the SIP session
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
On receiving a non-200 MSRP response to the MSRP SEND request the MCData
client shall handle the error as specified in IETF RFC 4975 [11]. To terminate
the MSRP session, the MCData client:
1\. if there are further MSRP chunks to send, shall abort transmission of
these further MSRP chunks;
2\. shall indicate to MCData user that the file could not be distributed; and
3\. shall terminate the SIP session as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
### 7.1.3 Terminating MCData client procedures
#### 7.1.3.1 Handling MSRP connection
Upon receiving an indication to establish MSRP connection for file
distribution as the terminating client, the MCData client:
1\. shall act as an MSRP client according to IETF RFC 6135 [12];
2\. shall act either as an active endpoint or as an passive endpoint to open
the transport connection, according to IETF RFC 6135 [12];
3\. shall establish the MSRP connection according to the MSRP connection
parameters in the SDP offer received in the SIP INVITE request according to
IETF RFC 4975 [11];
4\. if acting as an \"active\" endpoint, shall send an empty MSRP SEND request
to bind the MSRP connection to the MSRP session from the perspective of the
passive endpoint according to the rules and procedures of IETF RFC 4975 [11]
and IETF RFC 6135 [12];
Once the MSRP session is established, the MCData client:
1\. on receipt of an MSRP request in the MSRP session, shall follow the rules
and procedures defined in IETF RFC 4975 [11] and in IETF RFC 6714 [13];
2\. If an MSRP SEND request indicates the use of chunking, shall wait until
all further MSRP SEND requests for the remaining chunks have been received and
shall reassemble the entire set of MSRP requests into the file before
delivering the content to the application; and
3\. shall handle the received content as described in clause 7.1.3.2.
#### 7.1.3.2 Handling received content and disposition requests
Upon receiving a file, the MCData client:
1\. shall decode the contents of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-file MIME
body; and
2\. once all the chunks of the file are successfully received, shall indicate
to the signalling plane that the file download is completed.

## 7.3 Controlling MCData function procedures
### 7.3.1 General
### 7.3.2 Establishing MSRP session
#### 7.3.2.1 MSRP session establishment with originating MCData client
To establish the MSRP connection with the originating MCData client, the
controlling MCData function performs below procedures:
1\. shall act as an MSRP client and establish TLS connection with the
originating participating MCData function, if exists, otherwise the
originating MCData client, according to the rules and procedures as described
in IETF RFC 4975 [11];
2\. shall act as an MSRP client to send MSRP SEND requests according to the

[12].
#### 7.3.2.2 MSRP session establishment with terminating MCData client
To establish the MSRP connection with the terminating MCData client, the
controlling MCData function performs below procedures:
1\. shall act as an MSRP client and establish TLS connection with the
terminating participating MCData function, if exists, otherwise the
terminating MCData client, according to the rules and procedures as described
in IETF RFC 4975 [11];
2\. shall act as an MSRP client to send MSRP SEND requests according to the
rules and procedures described in IETF RFC 6135 [12];
3\. shall act according to IETF RFC 6135 [12], as:
a. an \"active\" endpoint, if a=setup attribute in the received SDP answer is

described in IETF RFC 6135 [12]; and
5\. if acting as an \"active\" endpoint, shall send an empty MSRP SEND request
on each established MSRP connection, to bind the MSRP connection to the MSRP
session according to the rules and procedures of IETF RFC 4975 [11] and IETF
RFC 6135 [12].
### 7.3.3 Handling of received MSRP messages
Upon receiving a MSRP SEND request from the originating participating MCData
function, the Controlling function:
1\. shall generate and send a MSRP 200 (OK) response for the received MSRP
SEND requests to the originating participating MCData function, according to
the rules and procedures of IETF RFC 4975 [11]; and
2\. shall forward the received MSRP SEND requests to each terminating MCData

the rules and procedures of IETF RFC 4975 [11]. Following clarifications apply
to the generated MSRP SEND request:
a. shall modify the To-Path header according to the MSRP URI received in the
answer SDP from the MCData client in accordance with rules and procedures of
IETF RFC 4975 [11]; and
b. shall modify the From-Path header to the controlling MCData function\'s own
MSRP URI, according to the rules and procedures of IETF RFC 4975 [11].
## 7.4 FD using MBMS delivery via MB2 interface
### 7.4.1 General Description
The procedures for group FD using MBMS delivery via the MB2 interface can be
seen as extensions of the procedures for group FD media delivery using
unicast. The procedures of the originating client, originating participating
function and controling function are those used for unicast session delivery
for group FD. Only the terminating participating function and the terminating
client are involved in MBMS delivery over MB2 interface functionality for
group FD.
The procedures assume that consistent with 3GPP TS 24.282 [8], an MSRP session
has already been established and the originating and terminating MCData
clients have already completed successfully the SDP offer/answer negotiation.
It is further assumed that the terminating MCData participating function has
already sent an MBMS bearer announcement message providing information about
the MBMS bearer and subchannel intended for MBMS delivery and that the
terminating MCData client has received and processed the MBMS bearer
announcement message, as described in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
During the session, the terminating MCData participating function intercepts
MSRP SEND messages arriving from the originating side, and, after eliminating
duplicates, encapsulates them unchanged as payload in (S)RTP/UDP/IP (see IETF
RFC 3711 [17]) packets and transmits them on an MBMS bearer towards the
terminating MCData client. Upon reception, the terminating MCData client
decapsulates the payload and processes it as an MSRP SEND message within the
MSRP session, arriving from the originating side.
NOTE 1: Since MSRP chunking is supported for unicast delivery, it is also
supported for MBMS delivery.
NOTE 2: If SRTP (see IETF RFC 3711 [17]), rather than RTP, is used to securely
protect packets sent on MBMS bearer, MuSiK (see 3GPP TS 24.282 [8] and 3GPP TS
33.180 [15]) may be employed to provide protection in addition to the security
mechanisms that protect the unicast MSRP traffic.
NOTE 3: The terminating participating function, which can use listening status
reports from the MCData clients, the presence, absence or content of the FILE
DOWNLOAD COMPLETED report, as well as other information, decides whether to
use unicast or MBMS delivery on an individual MCData client and file basis. At
any time during a session, the terminating participating server can toggle
between unicast and MBMS delivery.
### 7.4.2 Procedures for the terminating MCData client
#### 7.4.2.1 Handling the MSRP connection
The terminating MCData client shall execute the procedure for MSRP connection
establishment described in clause 7.1.3.1.
#### 7.4.2.2 Receiving Map Group To Bearer and Unmap Group To Bearer
While MBMS delivery is expected, the terminating MCData client shall monitor
the general purpose MBMS subchannel.
When receiving a Map Group To Bearer message over the general purpose MBMS
subchannel, the MBMS interface in the MCData client:
1) shall associate the TMGI in the TMGI field, the MBMS subchannel for media
with the MCData group identity in the MCData Group ID field; and
2) shall start or continue the procedure described in clause 7.4.2.3.
When receiving the Unmap Group To Bearer message referring to the current
communication over a MBMS subchannel, the MBMS interface in the MCData client:
1) shall remove the association between the TMGI, the MBMS subchannel for
media in the group session identified by the MCData Group ID field, if such an
association exists; and
2) shall cease monitoring the associated MBMS bearer and subchannel for media
and, if the MSRP session is still ongoing, shall resume or continue file
delivery via media plane over unicast.
#### 7.4.2.3 Receiving media packets
The terminating MCData client shall:
1\. while MBMS delivery is expected, monitor the MBMS bearer and subchannel
indicated by the Map Group To Bearer message; and
2\. for each received (S)RTP media packet, until a SIP BYE is received or
until an implementation dependent timeout occurs:
a. decapsulate the payload out of the (S)RTP packet and, if SRTP rather than
RTP is used (see IETF RFC 3711 [17]), decrypt and validate the payload;
b. if the media packet was received via an MBMS bearer with the TMGI
associated to the group, accept the payload as correctly destined for the
terminating MCData client, regardless of whether or not the Toâ€‘Path header of
the MSRP SEND message in the payload matches the terminating MCData client\'s
MSRP URI (i.e. the MSRP URI provided in the answer SDP to the controlling
function during the MSRP session establishment, in accordance with rules and
procedures of IETF RFC 4975 [11]); and
c. process the payload as a received MSRP SEND message during the established
MSRP session, according to clause 7.1.3.1, in the context of the media flow
formed by previously received MSRP SEND messages, whether delivered via
unicast or via MBMS.
### 7.4.3 Procedures for the terminating MCData participating function
#### 7.4.3.1 Establishing MSRP sessions
The terminating MCData participating function:
1\. shall establish an MSRP session with the controlling MCData function
according to clause 7.2.5.1; and
2\. shall establish an MSRP session with the terminating MCData client
according to clause 7.2.5.2.
#### 7.4.3.2 Sending Map Group To Bearer and Unmap Group To Bearer
The terminating MCData participating function:
1\. shall build a Map Group To Bearer message (see clause 11.2.4) to include:
a. the TMGI of the MBMS bearer to carry the traffic;
b. the identifier of the media stream; and
c. the MCData Group identifier field; and
2\. shall send (repetitively, at short, implementation dependent time
intervals) the Map Group To Bearer message over the general purpose MBMS
subchannel.
When the MSRP session with the terminating MCData client (see clause 7.4.3.1)
ends, the terminating MCData participating function shall build the
corresponding Unmap Group To Bearer message (see clause 11.2.5) and shall send
it over the general purpose MBMS subchannel.
#### 7.4.3.3 Receiving media packets intended for a terminating MCData client
When receiving an MSRP SEND message that the terminating participating
function considers qualified for MBMS delivery and is destined to one of the
MCData clients listening to the MBMS subchannel, the terminating participating
MCData function:
NOTE 1: An MSRP SEND message that does not qualify for MBMS delivery or is not
destined to an MCData client listening to the MBMS subchannel is handled as an
MSRP SEND message to be delivered over unicast (see clause 7.2.5.3).
1\. shall generate and send an MSRP 200 (OK) response for the received MSRP
SEND message to the controlling MCData function, according to the rules and
procedures of IETF RFC 4975 [11];
2\. shall check if the media packet that encapsulates the MSRP SEND message is
already sent over the MBMS subchannel or not;
3\. if the media packet is already sent over the MBMS subchannel, shall
discard the MSRP SEND message; and
4\. otherwise:
a. shall build an (S)RTP/UDP/IP (see IETF RFC 3711 [17]) media packet with the
IP address and UDP port number indicated in the sent Map Group To Bearer
message and with the received MSRP SEND message as payload, security protected
if SRTP is used, per IETF RFC 3711 [17] and 3GPP TS 33.180 [15]; and
b. shall transmit the built (S)RTP/UDP/IP packet on the MBMS bearer identified
by the TMGI indicated in the sent Map Group To Bearer message.
NOTE 2: To save over-the air resources, the terminating MCData participating
function releases or reduces the bandwidth of the unicast downlink bearers
used for unicast file delivery. However, to enable the ability of rapid
switching between unicast and MBMS delivery, the terminating MCData
participating function can keep the unicast bearers intact.
Upon receiving error MSRP responses (see IETF RFC 4975 [11]) from the
terminating MCData client, the terminating MCData participating function shall
forward the error MSRP responses towards the originating MCData client.
## 7.5 FD using MBS delivery via MCData-FD interface
All steps of clause 7.4 apply also for MBS except different interfaces, with
the clarification that terminology mapping specified in annex X applies.
# 8 Communication release media plane procedures
When communication is released by the MCData client or by the MCData server,
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8], for an SDS or FD session which uses the
media plane, the related MSRP session and the TCP or TLS connections used for
this MSRP session shall also be released.
# 9 Coding
## 9.1 General
SDS and FD over media plane messages are coded according to MSRP as specified
in RFC 4975 [11] both for short data and disposition notification. The body of
an MSRP message includes SDS specific messages of a file.
## 9.2 SDS specific messages
SDS specific messages used for on-network SDS using media plane are SDS
SIGNALLING PAYLOAD message, DATA PAYLOAD message and SDS NOTIFICATION message.
The message structures and the format of the information elements are
specified in clause 15 of 3GPP TS 24.282 [8]
# 10 Media plane security aspects
## 10.1 General
Media plane security provides integrity and confidentiality protection for the
MCData media information and media plane control information transmitted using
media plane. Media plane security also provides the authentication of MCData
media information.
The media plane security is based on 3GPP MCData security solution including
key management as defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [15].
NOTE: In 3GPP TS 33.180 [15] media information is denoted as MCData Data
Payload and media plane control information is denoted as MCData Data
signalling Payload.
Various keys and associated key identifiers protect the media information and
media plane control information carried in the body of an MSRP SEND message.
The media plane control information may be:
1\. SDS SIGNALLING PAYLOAD; or
2\. SDS NOTIFICATION.
The media information may be:
1\. DATA PAYLOAD; or
2\. File or file portion.
In an on-network MCData communication for an MCData group, if protection of
media is negotiated, the GMK and the GMK-ID of the MCData group shall be used
for protecting the media sent and received by MCData clients.
In an on-network one-to-one MCData communication, if protection of media is
negotiated, the PCK and the PCK-ID shall be used for protecting the media sent
and received by MCData clients.
If protection of media control information sent using unicast between the
MCData client and the participating MCData function serving the the MCData
client is negotiated, the CSK and the CSK-ID shall be used for protecting the
media control information sent and received using unicast by the MCData client
and by a participating MCData function.
If protection of media control information between the participating MCData
function and the controlling MCData function is configured, the SPK and the
SPK-ID shall be used for protecting the media control information sent and
received between the participating MCData function and the controlling MCData
function.
The GMK and the GMK-ID are distributed to the MCData clients using the group
document subscription and notification procedure specified in 3GPP TS 24.481
[4].
The PCK and the PCK-ID are generated by the MCData client initiating the
standalone one-to-one SDS using media plane or one-to-one SDS session or one-
to-one FD using media plane and provided to the MCData client receiving the
SIP signalling according to 3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
The CSK and the CSK-ID are generated by the MCData client and provided to the
participating MCData function serving the MCData client using SIP signalling
according to 3GPP TS 24.282 [8].
The SPK and the SPK-ID are configured in the participating MCData function and
the controlling MCData function.
The key material for creating and verifying the authentication signature (SSK,
PVT and KPAK) is provisioned to the MCData clients by the KMS as specified in
3GPP TS 33.180 [15].
## 10.2 **Derivation of master keys for media and media control**
Each MCData Payload Protection Key (DPPK) (i.e. GMK, PCK, CSK, SPK) and its
associated key identifier DPPK-ID (i.e. GMK-ID, PCK-ID, CSK-ID, SPK -ID)
described in clause 10.1 shall be used to derive a MCData Payload Cipher Key
(DPCK) and its associated DPCK-ID as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [15].
DPCK and DPCK-ID shall be used in the protection of media or media plane
control information as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [15].
## 10.3 Protection of media and media control and authentication of media
### 10.3.1 General
The media information may be protected. Protection shall be applied as
specified in clause 8.5.4 in 3GPP TS 33.180 [15].
The media control information may be protected. Protection shall be applied as
specified in clause 8.5.4 in 3GPP TS 33.180 [15].
MCData media information or protected MCData media information may also be
authenticated as specified in clause 8.5.5 in 3GPP TS 33.180 [15].
### 10.3.2 The MCData client
A MCData client transmitting media information shall protect the media
information using the related DPPK and DPPK-ID according to the negotiatd
protection method. For one-to-one communication PCK and PCK-ID shall be used
as DPPK and DPPK-ID. For group communication GMK and GMK-ID shall be used as
DPPK and DPPK-ID.
A MCData client transmitting media information or protected media information
shall use the key material provisioned by the KMS when generating the
authentication signature.
A MCData client which receives protected media information shall decrypt and
check the integrity of the protected media using the related DPPK and DPPK-ID
according to the negotiated protection method.
A MCData client which receives signed media information or signed and
protected media information shall verify the signature by using the signature,

# 11 Communication using MBMS
## 11.1 Control messages sent over MBMS bearers
### 11.1.1 General
The control messages sent over MBMS bearers by MCData participating function
and specified in the present document are based on the (S)RTCP Application
Packets (SRTCP: APP), as defined in IETF RFC 3550 [16] and IETF RFC 3711 [17],
but the control messages do not conform to the rules for compound RTCP packets
or RTCP packet transmission.
Each MBMS control message is one (S)RTCP: APP packet. These RTCP: APP packets
are not to be sent in compound RTCP packets, but more than one MBMS control
message can be sent in a single IP packet.
### 11.1.2 SRTCP: APP format for control messages sent over MBMS bearers
The definition of the fields in the SRTCP APP packet is found in IETF RFC 3550
[16] and IETF RFC 3711 [17].

RTCP packet per IETF RFC 3711 [17].
### 11.1.3 Application specific data field
Each application specific data field is composed of:
1\. a field ID which is one octet long;
2\. a length value which is:
\- one octet long, if the field ID is less than 192; and
\- two octets long, if the field ID is equal to or greater than 192;
3\. a field value. The length in octets of the field value is indicated in the
length value; and
4\. a padding. The padding is zero, one, two, or three octets long. The value
of the padding octet(s) is set to zero by sender and ignored by receiver.
An application specific data field is always a multiple of 4 octets long.

## 12.1 MCData client procedure
Upon establishing one-to-one or group SDS using media plane or one-to-one or
group SDS session using pre-established call, the MCData client shall follow
procedures as descried in clause 6.1.
## 12.2 Participating MCData function procedure
Upon establishing one-to-one or group SDS using media plane or one-to-one or
group SDS session using pre-established call, the participating MCData
function shall follow the procedure as described in clause 6.2.
# 13 IP Connectivity media plane procedures
## 13.1 IP Connectivity client procedures
### 13.1.1 General
For IP Connectivity the endpoint of the media plane is an IP application that
can send and receive any kind of IP messages. The IP application may reside on
an external non-3GPP host connected via an IP interface to the MCData UE that
incorporates the MCData client, or it may be running on the MCData UE. If the
IP application resides on an external non-3GPP host, the MCData UE that
incorporates the MCData client provides a second IP interface with an IP
address independent of the 3GPP system for communication with the external non
3GPP host. The IP interface between the IP application the MCData UE and the
MCData client is implementation specific.
### 13.1.2 Originating MCData client procedures
Upon receiving a request by an MCData user, or an IP packet from an IP
application, the MCData client shall follow the procedure in 20.2.1 in 3GPP TS
24.282 [8]. The IP address and port number received in the SDP payload of the
200 OK response in this procedure shall be used to establish an IP tunnel. The
IP tunnel shall be based on GRE-in-UDP Encapsulation as specified in IETF RFC
8086 [23], and as specified in clause 13.4. Generic Routing Encapsulation
(GRE) as specified in IETF RFC 2784 [19] is used as a basis of GRE-in-UDP
Encapsulation.
The MCData client shall perform encapsulation and decapsulation according to
clause 13.4.
The MCData client acts as an IP relay for IP traffic between the IP
application and the IP tunnel to the far endpoint. Once the IP tunnel is
established, the IP applications can exchange IP data. The MCData client that
receives the IP packets from the IP application shall perform encapsulation to
the tunnelling protocol adding a GRE header and a UDP header to the IP packet,
and send the outgoing UDP traffic to the IP address and port present in the
SDP answer. When the originating MCData client receives IP packets from the IP
tunnel it shall perform de-capsulation from the tunnelling protocol, removing
the UDP header and the GRE header from the received packet, before passing the
IP data to the IP application.
### 13.1.3 Terminating MCData client procedures
The successful outcome of the procedure 20.2.2 in 3GPP TS 24.282 [8] shall be
the trigger to start the establishment of the IP tunnel. The IP tunnel is
based on GRE-in-UDP Encapsulation as specified in IETF RFC 8086 [23], and as
specified in clause 13.4.
The MCData client shall perform encapsulation and decapsulation in accordance
with clause 13.4.
The MCData client acts as an IP relay for IP traffic between the IP tunnel and
the IP application. Once the IP tunnel is established, the IP applications can
exchange IP data. The client that receives IP packets from the IP tunnel shall
perform de-capsulation from the tunnelling protocol, removing the UDP header
and the GRE header from the received packet, before passing the IP data to the
IP application. When the terminating MCData client receives an IP packet from
the IP application, it shall perform encapsulation to the tunnelling protocol
adding a GRE header and a UDP header to the IP packet, and send the outgoing
UDP traffic to the IP address and port present in the SDP offer.
## 13.2 Participating MCData function procedures
### 13.2.1 Originating procedures
If the originating participating MCData function is in the path of the data
exchange between the MCData clients, it shall provide an endpoint for the UDP
based communication towards the originating MCData client, and a second
endpoint for UDP based communication towards the next hop of the UDP based
communication in the direction of the terminating MCData client. The
originating participating MCData function shall act as a relay for the UDP
traffic between these two adjacent UDP communication endpoints using the IP
addresses and UDP ports exchanged in the SDP offers/answers.
### 13.2.2 Terminating procedures
If the terminating participating MCData function is in the path of the data
exchange between the MCData clients, it shall provide an endpoint for the UDP
based communication towards the terminating MCData client, and a second
endpoint for UDP based communication towards the next hop of the UDP based
communication in the direction of the originating MCData client. The
terminating participating MCData function shall act as a relay for the UDP
traffic between these two adjacent UDP communication endpoints using the IP
addresses and UDP ports exchanged in the SDP offers/answers.
## 13.3 Controlling MCData function procedures
If the controlling MCData function is in the path of the data exchange between
the MCData clients, it shall provide an endpoint for the UDP based
communication towards the next hop of the UDP based communication in the
direction of the originating MCData client, and a second endpoint for the UDP
based communication towards the next hop of the UDP based communication in the
direction of the terminating MCData client. The controlling MCData function
shall act as a relay for the UDP traffic between these two adjacent UDP
Communication endpoints using the IP addresses and UDP ports exchanged in the
SDP offers/answers.
## 13.4 Encapsulation of the user data in the GRE-in-UDP tunnel
The Encapsulation of the user data in the GRE-in-UDP tunnel shall be performed
as defined in IETF RFC 8086 [23] with the following clarifications:
1.) UDP checksum shall be used when encapsulating in both IPv4 and IPv6;
2.) The UDP ports can be freely chosen. The port information is exchanged via
SDP; and
3.) GRE keys shall not be used.
## 13.5 Media plane details
### 13.5.1 General
The media plane is used for transport of data via the GRE-in-UDP tunnel as
specified in the present clause.
### 13.5.2 Establishing a media plane for a GRE-in-UDP tunnel
#### 13.5.2.1 General
The MCData client and the MCData server use the SDP offer/answer mechanism in
order to negotiate the establishment of the media plane for a GRE-in-UDP
tunnel.
The media description (\"m=\" line) associated with the media plane of the
GRE-in-UDP tunnel shall have the values as described in table 13.5.2.1-1.

## 13.6 Session description types defined within the present document
### 13.6.1 General
This clause contains definitions for SDP parameters that are specific to SDP
usage with MCData IP connectivity and therefore are not described in an IETF
RFC.
### 13.6.2 SDP \"fmtp\" attribute for MCData IP connectivity
#### 13.6.2.1 General
This clause defines the structure and syntax of the SDP \"fmtp\" attribute,
when used to negotiate the ports used for GRE-in-UDP tunnel establishment.
#### 13.6.2.2 Semantics
In an SDP offer and answer, the \"mcdata-ipconn-sport\" fmtp attribute is used
to indicate the UDP source port of the GRE-in-UDP tunnel.
