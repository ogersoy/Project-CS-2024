via Eees interface to register, update its registration and deregister at a
given EES.
### 5.2.2 Service Operations
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
The service operation defined for Eees_EECRegistration API is shown in the
table 5.2.2.1-1.
Table 5.2.2.1-1: Operations of the Eees_EECRegistration API
* * *
Service operation name Description Initiated by Eees_EECRegistration_Request
This service operation is used by the EEC to register itself to a given EES.
EEC Eees_EECRegistration_Update This service operation is used by the EEC to
update its registration information at EES. EEC
Eees_EECRegistration_Deregister This service operation is used by the EEC to

* * *
#### 5.2.2.2 Eees_EECRegistration_Request
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
This service operation is used by EEC to register itself with a given EES.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 EEC registering to EES using Eees_EECRegistration_Request
operation
For an EEC to register at the EES, the EEC shall send an HTTP POST message to
the EES on the \"EEC Registrations\" collection resource to create the
resource associated to or representing the EEC. The body of the HTTP POST
message shall include the EEC ID, may include UE identifier, AC Profile(s),
proposed expiration time for the registration, EEC context ID obtained from a
previous registration, the ACR scenario(s) supported by the EEC for service
continuity, as specified in clause 6.2.2.2.3.1. If EEC context ID is included
in the body of the HTTP POST message, it shall also include Source EES ID and
Source EES Endpoint of the EES that provided EEC context ID. If the EdgeApp_2
feature is supported, the EEC may include indication for UE mobility support
requirement and UE type to the EES.
Upon receiving the HTTP POST message from the EEC, the EES shall:
a) Process the EEC registration request information;
b) verify if the EEC is authorized to register itself at EES; and
c) if the EEC is authorized to register with EES, then;
1) if the AC Profile(s) is included in the HTTP POST message, the EES further
determines whether the registered EAS(s) fulfils the requirements that were
indicated in the AC Profile(s):
i) if acSvcContSupp information is included in the AC Profile, the EEC, EES,
and the matching EAS have to support ACRScenario indicated in the
acSvcContSupp information; and
ii) For each AC Profile, if eass information is included in the AC Profile,
the EES identifies the matching EAS such that the matching EAS shall:
A) be identified by the easId information; and
B) suffice all information included in the minimumReqSvcKPIs information.
NOTE 1: With respect to expectedSvcKPIs information, it is up to the EES
implementation on how to identifies the matching EAS.
iii) For each AC Profile, if easBundleInfo information is included in the AC
Profile, the EES identifies the matching list of EAS bundle to which the EAS
identified by the by the easId information belongs.
When a matching EAS is identified, the EES determines that the corresponding
requirements are fulfilled and are supported for the new resource.
When a matching EAS is not identified for even one AC profile, the EES shall
reject the request message by sending an HTTP response to the EEC with a
status code set to 404 Not Found and indicate the \"RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND\" error
in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure.
2) if the received EEC registration request contains an EEC context ID, a
source EES endpoint, the EES retrieves the EEC\'s context from the source EES
according to the procedures specified in clause 5.10 of 3GPP TS 29.558 [4];
3) the EES creates a new resource with the EEC registration information as
specified in clause 6.2.2.1, and assigns and stores new EEC context ID;
i) if the EES cannot reserve the necessary resources while meeting the
capability requirements of the existing registered EECs, the EES shall
determine the EEC Context information stale and send a failure response with a
corresponding cause as specified in clause 6.2.2.2.3.1; and
ii) Otherwise the EES shall return the EEC registration information in the
response message. The response message may include expiration time to indicate
when the EEC registration will automatically expire. The response message may
include a newly assigned EEC context ID. The URI of the created resource shall
be returned in the \"Location\" HTTP header. If the EEC registration request
contains AC Profile(s), and the EES determines that the requirements indicated
in the AC profile(s) cannot be fulfilled for some of the AC profile(s), the
EES shall include \"unfulfillAcProfs\" or \"unfulfilledAcProfs\" attribute
containing the list of ACIDs of such AC Profile(s) and appropriate reasons as
specified in clause 6.2.5.2.2; and
4) if the EdgeApp_2 feature is supported;
i) if the received EEC registration request contains an UE mobility support
requirement information to the EES, the EES shall store the same in the EEC
context. If UE mobility support requirement is set to true, the EES shall
subscribe to UE's location or analytics information using 3GPP core network
capabilities and in case of false the EES as per ECSP policy and EAS
requirements may decide to fetch one time UE location or subscribe to NEF or
NWDAF for UE location information or its analytics; and
ii) if the received EEC registration request contains an UE type information,
the EES shall check if the UE is a constrained device and shall store the
received UE type information in the EEC context.
NOTE 2: The \"unfulfilledAcProfs\" attribute can only be provided if there is
only a single unfulfilled AC profile.
The EEC stores the new EEC context ID and uses it when it registers with
another EES.
If the expiration time is provided, then to maintain the registration, the EEC
shall send a registration update request (as described in clause 5.2.2.3)
prior to the expiration time. If a succesful registration update request is
not received prior to the expiration time, then the EES shall treat the EEC as
implicitly deregistered and remove the corresponding EEC registration
resource.
#### 5.2.2.3 Eees_EECRegistration_Update
##### 5.2.2.3.1 General
This service operation is used by the EEC to update its registration
information at the EES.
##### 5.2.2.3.2 EEC updating registration information using
Eees_EECRegistration_Update operation
To update the EEC registration information at the EES, the EEC shall send an
HTTP PATCH request (for partial update) or HTTP PUT message (for fully
replacement) to the EES on resource URI identifying the Individual EEC
registration resource representation as specified in clause 6.2.2.3.3.3 for an
HTTP PATCH message or in clause 6.2.2.3.3.1 for an HTTP PUT message.
The PATCH message includes the parameters (AC profiles or proposed expiry
time) that need to be replaced in the existing registration information.
The PUT message shall replace all properties of the existing resource with the
EEC registration information in the request. The value of the eecId provided
during the EEC registration shall not be changed.
Upon receiving the HTTP PATCH or PUT message from the EEC, if the resource URI
does not exist, the EES shall respond 404 Not Found error to the EEC.
Otherwise, the EES shall:
a) check the registration update message from the EEC to see if the EEC is
authorized to modify the requested registration resource; and
b) if the EEC is authorized to update the registration information and the
eecId information in the request and the resource match, then the EES shall;
1) if the AC Profile(s) is included in the HTTP PATCH or PUT message, the EES
further determines whether the registered EAS(s) fulfils the requirements that
were indicated in the AC Profile(s):
i) if acSvcContSupp information is included in the AC Profile, the EEC, EES
and the matching EAS have to support ACRScenario indicated in the
acSvcContSupp information; and
ii) For each AC Profile, if EAS(s) information is included in the AC Profile,
the EES identifies the matching EAS such that the matching EAS shall:
A) be identified by the easId information; and
B) suffice all information included in the minimumReqSvcKPIs information.
NOTE 1: With respect to expectedSvcKPIs information, it is up to the EES
implementation on how to identifies the matching EAS.
iii) For each AC Profile, if easBundleInfo information is included in the AC
Profile, the EES identifies the matching list of EAS bundle to which the EAS
identified by the by the easId information belongs.
When a matching EAS is identified for atleast one AC profile, the EES
determines that the corresponding requirements are fulfilled and are supported
and shall update the resource identified by Resource URI of the EEC
registration information with the updated EEC registration information
received in the HTTP PATCH or PUT request message.
2) return the updated EEC registration information in the response. In the
response message, the EES may send \"200 OK\" response code to provide an
updated expiration time to indicate to the EEC when the updated registration
will automatically expire. Otherwise, the EES sends \"204 No Content\"
response code. If the EEC registration request contains AC Profile(s), and the
EES determines that the requirements indicated in the AC profile(s) cannot be
fulfilled for some of the AC profile(s), the EES shall include
\"unfulfillAcProfs\" or \"unfulfilledAcProfs\" attribute containing the list
of ACIDs of such AC Profile(s) and appropriate reasons as specified in clause
6.2.5.2.2.
3) if the EdgeApp_2 feature is supported;
i) if the received EEC registration update request contains an UE mobility
support requirement information to the EES, the EES shall update the same in
the EEC context. If UE mobility support requirement is set to true, the EES
shall subscribe to UE's location or analytics information using 3GPP core
network capabilities and in case of false the EES as per ECSP policy and EAS
requirements may decide to fetch one time UE location or subscribe to NEF or
NWDAF for UE location information or its analytics; and
ii) if the received EEC registration update request contains an UE type
information, the EES shall check if the UE is a constrained device and shall
store the received UE type information in the EEC context.
NOTE 2: The \"unfulfilledAcProfs\" attribute can only be provided if there is
only a single unfulfilled AC profile.
If the expiration time is provided, the EEC shall send a registration update
request prior to the expiration time if the EEC wants to maintain the
registration. If a successful registration update request is not received
prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC as implicitly de-
registered and remove the corresponding EEC registration resource.
#### 5.2.2.4 Eees_EECRegistration_Deregister
##### 5.2.2.4.1 General
This service operation is used by EEC to deregister itself from a given EES.
##### 5.2.2.4.2 EEC deregistering from EES using
Eees_EECRegistration_Deregister operation
To deregister itself from the EES, the EEC shall send HTTP DELETE message to
the EES, on the resource URI identifying the Individual EEC registration
resource representation as specified in clause 6.2.2.3.3.3. Upon receiving the
HTTP DELETE request, the EES shall:
a) verify the identity of the EEC and check if the EEC is authorized to
deregister the EEC registration information;
b) if the EEC is authorized to deregister the EEC registration information,
then the EES shall
1) if the resource identified by registrationId is not found, return \"404 Not
Found\" error message to the EEC;
2) otherwise, deregister the EEC profile from the EES and delete the resource
representing EEC registration information; and
3) return the \"204 No Content\" message to the EEC, indicating the successful
deregistration of the EEC information.

requirements on EAS bundle information initiated by the EEC. It is FFS which
service operations of the Eecs_ServiceProvisoning API need to be updated.
#### 5.3.2.2 Eees_EASDiscovery_EasDiscRequest
##### 5.3.2.2.1 General
This service operation is used by the EEC to request for one-time EAS
discovery information.
##### 5.3.2.2.2 EEC requesting EAS discovery information using
Eees_EASDiscovery_EasDiscRequest operation
To request for one-time EAS discovery, the EEC shall send an HTTP POST request
to the EES as specified in clause 6.3.2.4.4. The body of the POST message
shall include the EasDiscoveryReq data structure as specified in clause
6.3.5.2.2.
Upon reception of the HTTP POST message from the EEC, the EES shall:
a) process the EAS discovery request information;
b) the EES verifies and checks if the EEC is authorized to discover the
requested EAS(s) from EES;
c) if EEC is authorized to discover the requested EAS(s) from EES, the EEC is
not registered with the EES, and the ECSP policy requires the EEC to perform
EEC registration prior to EAS discovery, the EES shall reject the request by
sending an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" status code to the EEC including the
ProblemDetails data structure with the \"cause\" attribute containing the
\"REGISTRATION_REQUIRED\" application error;
d) if the EEC is authorized to discover the requested EAS(s) from EES and the
EEC is registered as required by the ECSP policy, then the EES;
1) may obtain the UE\'s location as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.122
[3];
2) if EAS discovery filters are provided by the EEC, the EES identifies the
EAS(s) based on the provided EAS discovery filters and the UE location, and if
the enNB1 feature is supported, the \"userLocation\" attribute may be provided
in the \"locInf\" attribute within the EasDiscoveryReq data type;
3) if the EEC indicates that service continuity support is required, the EES
shall take the indication which ACR scenarios are supported by the AC and the
EEC and which of these are preferred by the AC into consideration. The EES
identifies the EAS(s) who supports at least one of the ACR scenarios as
indicated by EEC;
4) if EAS discovery filters are not provided:
i. if available, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the UE-specific
service information at the EES and the UE location; and
ii. EES identifies the EAS(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on
the UE location);
5) the EES may trigger the EAS management system to instantiate the EAS that
matches with EAS discovery filter IEs;
6) if the EdgeApp_2 feature is supported and the EEC indicates the EAS
selection support within the \"easSelSupInd\" attribute, the EES shall select
one matching EAS that fulfils the EEC requirements as described in bullets 2),
3) and 4), and the EES shall provide the selected EAS information to the EEC
within the \"discoveredEas\" attribute;
e) if the EdgeApp_2 feature is supported, and:
1) if the EEC indicates EAS Instantiation Triggering using \"easIntTrigSup\"
attribute with the value set to true in the EAS discovery request, and the EES
supports such capability, the EES may determine instantiable EAS information
using \"easInstInfos\" attribute, which is provided in the EAS discovery
response, for EAS(s) that are instantiable but not yet instantiated and match
the EAS discovery filter IEs; and
2) if the EEC indicates the predicted expiration time by which the UE reaches
location using the \"predictExpTime\" attribute, the EES may also collect edge
load analytics from the ADAES (as specified in clause 8.8.2 of 3GPP TS 23.436
[9]) or performance data from the OAM to find whether the EAS(s) satisfies the
expected AC service KPIs or the minimum required AC service KPIs; and
Editor\'s note [CR#0053, EDGEAPP_Ph2]: The EEC usage of the analytics
information received in the EAS discovery response is FFS.
f) if the processing of the request was successful, the EES sends an EAS
discovery response to the EEC as specified in clause 6.3.2.4.4.2.2, which
includes information about the discovered EASs. The response shall include
endpoint information for discovered EASs. Depending on the EAS discovery
filters received in the EAS discovery request, the response may include
additional information regarding matched capabilities, e.g. service
permissions levels, KPIs, AC locations(s) that the EASs can support, ACR
scenarios supported by the EAS, etc. The EAS discovery response may contain a
list of EASs. This list may be based on EAS discovery filters containing a
Geographical or Topological Service Area, e.g. a route, included in the EAS
discovery request by the EEC.
If the successful processing of the request does not result in finding a
matching EAS (i.e. there is no client side error), the EES responds with \"204
No Content\" HTTP status code. Otherwise, the EES shall reject the EAS
discovery request and respond with an appropriate failure HTTP status code.
The EEC may cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for subsequent use
and avoid the need to repeat this procedure. If the \"lifeTime\" attribute is
included in the response, the EEC may cache the EAS information only for the
duration specified by the Lifetime IE.
If the failure response is received for the EAS discovery request, the EEC may
resend the EAS discovery request, taking into account the received failure
cause. If the failure cause indicated \"REGISTRATION_REQUIRED\" error in the
\"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure, the EEC shall perform
an EEC registration as specified in clause 5.2.2.2.2 before resending the EAS
discovery request.
#### 5.3.2.3 Eees_EASDiscovery_Subscribe
##### 5.3.2.3.1 General
This service operation is used by the EEC to subscribe to EES for reporting of
EAS discovery information.
##### 5.3.2.3.2 EEC subscribing to EAS discovery information from EES using
Eees_EASDiscovery_Subscribe operation
To subscribe to changes of EAS discovery information at the EES, the EEC shall
send an HTTP POST message to the EES on the \"EAS Discovery Subscriptions\"
resource. The body of the POST message shall include the
EASDiscoverySubscription data structure as specified in clause 6.3.2.2.3.1.
Upon receiving the HTTP POST message from the EEC, the EES:
a) shall process the EAS discovery subscription request;
b) if the EEC is not registered with the EES, and if ECSP policy requires the
EEC to perform EEC registration prior to EAS discovery, the EES shall reject
the request message by sending an HTTP response to the EEC with a status code
set to 403 Forbidden and may indicate the \"REGISTRATION_REQUIRED\" error in
the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure;
b) if the EEC is registered, the EES shall verify and check if the EEC is
authorized to subscribe for information of the requested EAS(s) from EES;
c) if the EEC is authorized to discover the requested EAS(s) from EES, then
the EES;
1) may obtain the UE\'s location as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.122
[3];
2) shall create a new Individual EAS Discovery Subscription resource as
specified in clause 6.3.2.2.3.1; and
d) if EdgeApp_2 feature is supported;
1) if the EEC indicates EAS Instantiation Triggering using \"easIntTrigSup\"
attribute set to true in the EAS discovery subscription request, the EES may
trigger dynamic instantiation of the EAS; and
2) if the EEC indicates EEC Trigger Request using \"eecTriggerRequest\"
attribute set to true, then application triggering is supported and required
by the EEC and the EES may send trigger towards the EEC to perform EAS
discovery; and
e) if the processing of the request was successful, the EES shall send an EAS
discovery subscription response to the EEC as specified in clause 6.3.2.2.3.1,
which includes the subscription identifier and shall include the expiration
time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire.
If the EES is unable to process the request (e.g. was not able to determine
the EAS using the input information in the request or using the locally
available information), the EES shall reject the request with a with
appropriate response code as specified in Table 5.2.6-1 of TS 29.122 [3].
If the expiration time is provided, the EEC shall send an EAS discovery
subscription update request prior to the expiration time if the EEC wants to
maintain the subscription. If an EAS discovery subscription update request is
not received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC as
implicitly unsubscribed.
If the failure response is received for the EAS discovery request, the EEC may
resend the EAS discovery subscription request, taking into account the
received failure cause. If the failure cause indicated
\"REGISTRATION_REQUIRED\" error in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure, the EEC shall perform an EEC registration as
specified in clause 5.2.2.2.2 before resending the EAS discovery request.
#### 5.3.2.4 Eees_EASDiscovery_Notify
##### 5.3.2.4.1 General
This service operation is used by the EES to notify the EEC about the EAS
discovery information.
##### 5.3.2.4.2 EES notifying the EAS discovery information to EEC using
Eees_EASDiscovery_Notify operation
The EES determines to notify the EEC with the EAS discovery information, when
an event occurs at the EES that satisfies trigger conditions for updating EAS
discovery information of a subscribed EEC. The EES may obtain the UE\'s
location as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.122 [3].
If EAS discovery filters are provided by the EEC, the EES identifies the
EAS(s) based on the provided EAS discovery filters and the UE location.
If EAS discovery filters are not provided, the EES identifies the EAS(s), if
available, based on the UE-specific service information at the EES and the UE
location; and by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on the UE
location).
If valid UE location information is not available in local cache, then the EES
shall obtain the UE location information by consuming the 3GPP core network
capabilities. If obtaining UE location information from the 3GPP core network
capabilities fails, then the EES may retry to obtain UE location information.
If EES is unable to obtain UE location, then the EES fails to discover the EAS
and the notification will not be sent.
If UE location is available and EES determines that the UE location is outside
the Geographical or Topological Service Area of an EAS, then the EES shall not
include this EAS in the EAS discovery notification.
If the EdgeApp_2 feature is supported, the EES, based on local policy, may use
the EAS endpoints received from the EEC or all registered EAS endpoints to get
edge load analytics information from the ADAES services (e.g. as specified in
clause 8.8.2 of 3GPP TS 23.436 [9]) to monitor EAS service status like EAS
status and EAS schedule if the EEC subscribed to the
\"EAS_DYNAMIC_INFO_CHANGE\" event.
Editor\'s note [CR#0053, EDGEAPP_Ph2]: The EEC usage of the analytics
information received in the EAS discovery notification request is FFS.
If the EES identifies the EAS(s) then to notify the EAS discovery information
events, the EES shall either send an HTTP POST message using the Notification
Destination URI received in the subscription request, as specified in clause
6.3.4.2.
The EEC may cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for subsequent use.
If the \"lifeTime\" attribute is included in the notification, the EEC may
cache the EAS information only for the duration specified by the Lifetime IE.

request (for fully replacement) message to the EES using the resource URI
identifying the concerned \"Individual EAS Discovery Subscription\" resource
as specified in clause 6.3.2.3.3.3 for an HTTP PATCH message and in clause
6.3.2.3.3.1 for an HTTP PUT message.
The PATCH message includes the parameters (EAS discovery filters, EAS dynamic
information filters, Service continuity support, or proposed expiry time) that
need to be replaced in the existing subscription resource.
The PUT message shall replace all properties of the existing resource with the
EAS Discovery subscription information in the request. The values of the easId
and ueId provided during the subscription creation shall not be changed.
Upon receiving the HTTP PATCH or PUT message from the EEC, the EES:
a) shall check the update subscription message from the EEC to see if the EEC
is authorized to update the requested subscription resource;
b) if the EEC is authorized to update the EAS discovery subscription and if
the eecId and the ueId of the request match the eecId and the ueId in the
resource, then the EES;
1) shall update the resource identified by Resource URI of the EAS discovery
subscription with the updated information received in the HTTP PATCH or PUT
request message;
2) on success, shall either return an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the
payload body of the HTTP PATCH or PUT response containing the representation
of the replaced resource or an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response.
c) if the EAS discovery subscription update operation is unsuccessful, shall
return an appropriate error response as specified in Table 5.2.6-1 of 3GPP TS
29.122 [3];
d) may include an expiration time.
If the expiration time is provided, the EEC shall send the EAS discovery
subscription update request prior to the expiration time if the EEC wants to
maintain the subscription. If the EAS discovery subscription update request is
not received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC as
implicitly unsubscribed and remove the corresponding EAS discovery

## 7.2 Eecs_ServiceProvisioning Service
### 7.2.1 Service Description
The Eecs_ServiceProvisioning API, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.558 [2], allows an
EEC via the Eecs interface to obtain service provisioning information as a
one-time request or to subscribe for reporting from the ECS.
### 7.2.2 Service Operations
#### 7.2.2.1 Introduction
The service operation defined for Eecs_ServiceProvisioning API is shown in the
table 7.2.2.1-1.
Table 7.2.2.1-1: Operations of the Eecs_ServiceProvisioning API
* * *
Service operation name Description Initiated by
Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Request This service operation is used by the EEC to
request for one-time service provisioning information. EEC
Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Subscribe This service operation is used by the EEC
to subscribe to ECS for reporting of service provisioning information. EEC
Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Notify This service operation is used by the ECS to
notify the EEC about the service provisioning information. ECS
Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_UpdateSubscription This service operation is used by
the EEC to update its subscription at ECS for reporting of service
provisioning information. EEC Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Unsubscribe This
service operation is used by the EEC to remove its subscription from ECS for
reporting of service provisioning information. EEC
* * *
Editor\'s note [CR#0031, EDGEAPP_Ph2]: 3GPP TS 23.558 [2] contains
requirements on EAS bundle information received from the ECS. It is FFS which
service operations of the Eecs_ServiceProvisoning API need to be updated.
#### 7.2.2.2 Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Request
##### 7.2.2.2.1 General
This service operation is used by the EEC to request for one-time service
provisioning information.
##### 7.2.2.2.2 EEC requesting service provisioning information using
Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Request operation
To request for the one-time service provisioning information, the EEC shall
send an HTTP POST request (custom operation: \"Request\") to the ECS with the
request URI set to\"{apiRoot}/eecs-
serviceprovisioning/\/request\". And the body including the
ECSServProvReq data structure, as specified in clause 8.1.5.2.2.
Upon receiving the HTTP POST message from the EEC, the ECS shall:
a) process the EEC service provisioning request information;
b) verify and check if the EEC is authorized to request service provisioning
information from ECS;
c) if the EEC is authorized to request service provisioning information from
ECS, then the ECS:
1) may obtain the UE\'s location as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.122
[3];
2) if AC profile(s) are provided by the EEC, the ECS identifies the EES(s)
based on the provided AC profile(s) and the UE location, and if the enNB1
feature is supported, the \"userLocation\" attribute may be provided in the
\"locInf\" attribute within the EasDiscoveryReq data type;
i) if acSvcContSupp information is included in the AC Profile, the matching
EES has to support ACRScenario indicated in the acSvcContSupp information; and
ii) for each AC Profile, if eass information is included in the AC Profile,
the ECS identifies the matching EES such that the EES profile matches easId
information. ECS may also include EAS instantiation information using \"
easInstInfos\" attribute in eass information;
3) if AC profiles(s) are not provided:
i. if available, the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the UE-specific
service information at the ECS and the UE location; and
ii. ECS identifies the EES(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based on the
UE location);
4) if the EdgeApp_2 feature is supported and the EEC provided the list of
desired ECSP identifiers within the \"ecspIds\" attribute, the ECS shall
identify the matching EESs based on registered ECSP identifier in EES profile;
and
5) the ECS also determines other information that needs to be provisioned,
e.g. identification of the EDN, EDN service area, EES endpoints; and
d) if the ECS is able to determine service provisioning information using the
inputs in service provisioning request, UE-specific service information at the
ECS or the ECSP\'s policy, then the ECS returns an HTTP \"200 OK\" status code
response with the response body including the ECSServProvResp data structure
which may include the lifetime of the provided EDN configuration information.
If the inputs in service provisioning request do not match any EDN
configuration information (i.e. there is no client side error), the ECS sends
an HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code response code.
Otherwise, the ECS shall reject the service provisioning request and respond
with an appropriate failure cause.
The EEC may cache the service provisioning information (e.g. EES endpoint). If
the lifeTime attribute is included in the service provisioning response, then
the EEC may cache and reuse the service provisioning information only for the
duration specified by the lifeTime attribute.
The EEC may select one or more EES to perform EAS discovery, for multiple
EES(s) case, if instantiable EAS information using \"easInstInfos\" attribute
for an EAS is not available, or the instantiable EAS information using
\"easInstInfos\" attribute is set to instantiated or instantiable.
The EEC may consider the instantiable EAS information using \"easInstInfos\"
attribute and the associated instantiation criteria to mitigate the waste of
EDN resources for EAS discovery. The EEC selects one EES, if the EAS
instantiation status corresponding to the EASID requested by AC/EEC is
instantiable but not yet instantiated (i.e., no instantiated EAS).
NOTE 1: If the EAS instantiation fails based on the selected EES, the EEC
retries the EAS discovery request to another EES ((e.g. selecting another one
EES based on the instantiable EAS information).
NOTE 2: How EEC maintains the service provisioning information is
implementation specific.
#### 7.2.2.3 Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Subscribe
##### 7.2.2.3.1 General
This service operation is used by the EEC to subscribe to ECS, for reporting
of service provisioning information when changes to provisioning information
occur which are of interest to EEC.
##### 7.2.2.3.2 EEC subscribing to service provisioning information from ECS
using Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Subscribe operation
To subscribe to changes to service provisioning information at the ECS, the
EEC shall send an HTTP POST message to the ECS on the Service Provisioning
Subscriptions resource. The body of the POST message may include Notification
Target Address (e.g. URL, provided with in \"notificationDestination\"
attribute), the UE identifier (e.g. GPSI), connectivity information, proposed
expiration time, AC Profile information and if the EdgeApp_2 feature is
supported the list of desired ECSP identifiers and indication whether the
application triggering is required with in \"eecTriggerRequest\" attribute, as
specified in clause 8.1.2.3.3.1.
If the \"eecTriggerRequest\" attribute is included then the
\"notificationDestination\" attribute shall not be included.
Upon receiving the HTTP POST message from the EEC, the ECS shall:
a) process the EEC service provisioning subscription request;
b) verify and check if the EEC is authorized to subscribe for the service
provisioning information; and
c) if the EEC is authorized to subscribe for the service provisioning
information, then the ECS;
1) may obtain the UE\'s location as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.122
[3];
2) shall create a new resource with the Service Provisioning Subscriptions
resource as specified in clause 8.1.2.3;
3) if the ECS determines the EES information using the inputs in service
provisioning subscription request, UE-specific service information at the ECS
or the ECSP policy, then the ECS returns the service provisioning subscription
response, which includes the subscription identifier and may include the
expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire.
Otherwise, the ECS shall reject the service provisioning subscription request
and respond with an appropriate failure cause and
4) if EdgeApp_2 feature is supported and the EEC required EEC Trigger Request
by setting the \"eecTriggerRequest\" attribute to true, then ECS may send
trigger towards the EEC to perform service provisioning.
If the expiration time is provided, then to maintain the subscription, the EEC
shall send a Service provisioning subscription update request (as described in
clause 7.2.2.5) prior to the expiration time. If a Service provisioning
subscription update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the
ECS shall treat the EEC as implicitly unsubscribed and remove the
corresponding service provisioning subscription resource.
#### 7.2.2.4 Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Notify
##### 7.2.2.4.1 General
This service operation is used by the ECS to notify the EEC about the service
provisioning information.
##### 7.2.2.4.2 ECS notifying the service provisioning information to EEC
using Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Notify operation
The ECS determines to notify the EEC with the service provisioning
information, when an event occurs at the ECS that satisfies trigger conditions
for updating service provisioning of a subscribed EEC.
The ECS may obtain the UE\'s location as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS
29.122 [3]. If AC profile(s) were provided by the EEC during subscription
creation, the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the provided AC profile(s)
and the UE location.
NOTE 1: How the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the provided AC profile(s)
and the UE location is implementation specific.
If AC profiles(s) were not provided, then if available, the ECS identifies the
EES(s) based on the UE-specific service information at the ECS and the UE
location. The ECS may also identify the EES(s) by applying the ECSP policy
(e.g. based only on the UE location). If the EdgeApp_2 feature is supported
and the ECS received the list of desired ECSP identifiers, the ECS identifies
the EES(s) based on registered ECSP identifier in EES profile.
The ECS also determines other information that needs to be provisioned, e.g.
identification of the EDN, EDN service area, EES endpoints.
To notify the service provisioning information events, the ECS shall send an
HTTP POST message using the Notification Destination URI received in the
subscription request, as specified in clause 8.1.4.2.
Upon receiving the HTTP POST message, the EEC shall process the service
provisioning information. The EEC may cache the service provisioning
information (e.g. EES endpoint). If the lifeTime attribute is included in the
service provisioning response, then the EEC may cache and reuse the service
provisioning information only for the duration specified by the lifeTime
attribute. If the ECS provided information regarding the service continuity
support of individual EESs, the EEC may take this information into account
when selecting an EES for EEC registration, EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery,
respectively.
NOTE 2: How the EEC maintains the service provisioning information is
implementation specific.
#### 7.2.2.5 Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_UpdateSubscription
##### 7.2.2.5.1 General
This service operation is used by the EEC to update its subscription at the
ECS, for reporting of service provisioning information.
##### 7.2.2.5.2 EEC updating service provisioning information subscription at
ECS using Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_UpdateSubscription operation
To update service provisioning information subscription at the ECS, the EEC
shall send an HTTP PATCH message (for partial modification) or HTTP PUT
message (for fully replacement) to the ECS on resource URI identifying the
Individual Service Provisioning Subscription resource representation, as
specified in clause 8.1.2.4.3.3 for an HTTP PATCH message and in clause
8.1.2.4.3.1 for an HTTP PUT message.
The PATCH message includes the parameters (AC Profiles, proposed expiry time,
service continuity support or list of connectivity information) that need to
be replaced in the existing subscription resource.
The PUT message shall replace all properties of the existing resource with the
service provisioning information in the request. The values of the eecId and
ueId provided during the subscription creation shall not be changed.
Upon receiving the HTTP PATCH or PUT message from the EEC, the ECS:
a) shall check the update subscription message from the EEC to see if the EEC
is authorized to modify the requested subscription resource;
b) if the EEC is authorized to update the service provisioning subscription
and the eecId of the requesting EEC and the eecId in the resource match, then
the ECS;
1) may obtain the UE\'s location as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.122
[3];
2) shall update the resource identified by Resource URI of the service
provisioning subscription with the updated information received in the HTTP
PATCH or PUT request message;
3) shall return the service provisioning subscription response. The ECS may
send \"200 OK\" response code which includes the subscription identifier and
the expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically
expire. Otherwise, the EES sends \"204 No Content\" response code.
If the expiration time is provided, the EEC shall send a service provisioning
subscription update request prior to the expiration time if the EEC wants to
maintain the subscription. If a service provisioning subscription update
request is not received prior to the expiration time, the ECS shall treat the
EEC as implicitly unsubscribed and remove the corresponding service
provisioning subscription resource.
#### 7.2.2.6 Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Unsubscribe
##### 7.2.2.6.1 General
This service operation is used by the EEC to remove its subscription from the
ECS for reporting of service provisioning information.
##### 7.2.2.6.2 EEC unsubscribing to service provisioning subscription from
ECS using Eecs_ServiceProvisioning_Unsubscribe operation
To unsubscribe service provisioning subscription from the ECS, the EEC shall
send an HTTP DELETE message to the ECS, on the resource URI identifying the
individual service provisioning subscription resource representation as
specified in clause 8.1.2.4.3.2. Upon receiving the HTTP DELETE request, the
ECS:
a) shall verify and check if the EEC is authorized to unsubscribe the
Individual Service Provisioning Subscription resource;
b) if the EEC is authorized to delete the Individual Service Provisioning
Subscription resource, then the ECS shall unsubscribe the EEC service
provisioning subscription identified by the subscriptionId;
c) shall return the \"204 Not Content\" message to the EEC, indicating the
successful removal of the subscription information.

###### ## Annex C (informative): Protocol options considered for EDGE-4
