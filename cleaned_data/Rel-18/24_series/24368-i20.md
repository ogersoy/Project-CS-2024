# 1 Scope
The present document defines a Management Object (MO) that can be used to
configure the UE with parameters related to Non-Access Stratum (NAS)
functionality.
The MO is compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM) protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA DM
Device Description Framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [2].
The MO consists of relevant parameters for NAS related configuration of a UE.

# 4 NAS configuration MO
The NAS configuration MO is used to manage configuration parameters related to
NAS functionality for a UE supporting provisioning of such information. The
presence and format of the non-access stratum configuration file on the USIM
is specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [6].
