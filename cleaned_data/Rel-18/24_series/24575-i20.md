# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies UE pre-configuration for multicast/broadcast
services (MBS) in order to receive the data of multicast communication
services and broadcast communication services as specified in 3GPP TS 23.247
[3].
The present document defines a management object (MO) that can be used to
configure the UE with parameters related to reception of data of multicast
communication services and broadcast communication services.
The MO is compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM) protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA DM
device description framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [8].
The MO consists of nodes and leaves conveying UE pre-configuration parameters
used for multicast communication service and broadcast communication service
selection and data reception.

# 4 General description
A UE can support multicast and broadcast service (MBS) that is a point-to-
multipoint service in which data is transmitted from a single source entity to
multiple recipients either to all users in a broadcast service area (MBS
broadcast communication), or to users in a multicast group (MBS multicast
communication) as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [3]. The UE may support pre-
configuration of information for services using MBS.
If the UE is pre-configured with information related to services using MBS,
the UE can discover and receive data for services by using the provisioned
configuration.
The UE pre-configuration contains a list of PLMNs in which for each PLMN, the
following information is configured:
a) PLMN ID of the PLMN for which the configuration applies;
b) RAN information based on NR-ARFCN on which the broadcast communication
service is available;
c) list of TMGI, on which the broadcast communication service is available,
each associated with user service description (USD) information (see 3GPP TS
26.517 [11]) for the MBS broadcast service. If TMGI and USD information for
the MBS user service is configured for the PLMN selected for broadcast
communication service, the UE uses the information configured therein to
acquire the broadcast communication service;
d) list of TMGI, on which the service announcement for broadcast communication
service is available along with the associated USD information (see 3GPP TS
26.517 [11]) for the MBS user service announcement service. If TMGI and USD
information for MBS user service announcement is configured for a PLMN
selected for broadcast communication service, the UE uses the information
configured therein to acquire the service announcement for broadcast
communication service; and
e) default DNN and S-NSSAI pair for PDU sessions that can be used to join MBS
multicast sessions (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [10]) for which no other
information is available.
# 5 Multicast/Broadcast UE pre-configuration
## 5.1 General
The UE pre-configuration MO is used to configure the UE with parameters
related to MBS (see 3GPP TS 23.247 [3]).
The MO identifier is: urn: oma:mo:ext-3gpp-UE-pre-config-MBS:1.0.
Editor's note: The MO identifier needs to be registered.
The OMA DM access control list (ACL) property mechanism (see OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2
[8]) may be used to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to
modify nodes and leaf objects of the UE pre-configuration MO.
## 5.2 UE pre-configuration MO structure
The structure of the UE pre-configuration MO is shown in figure 5.2.1 and
figure 5.2.1 below.
