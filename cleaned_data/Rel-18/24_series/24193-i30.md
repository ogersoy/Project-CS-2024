# 4 General description
## 4.1 Introduction
ATSSS is an optional feature that can be supported by the UE and the 5GC
network to route data traffic across 3GPP access and non-3GPP access networks.
An ATSSS capable UE establishes an MA PDU session supporting multi-access
connectivity over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access networks as described in
clause 4.2. The ATSSS capable UE can support ATSSS-LL MPTCP or MPQUIC steering
functionality or any combination of them as described in clause 4.3, with
associated steering modes, i.e. active-standby, smallest delay, load
balancing, priority based or redundant. The ATSSS capable UE indicates the
steering functionality and associated steering modes to the 5GC network.
When the ATSSS capable UE registers to a registration area, it receives an
indication from the AMF if the network supports the ATSSS. The procedure for
how the AMF indicates the UE about its ATSSS support is specified in 3GPP TS
24.501 [6]. The UE capable ATSSS and the network supporting ATSSS exchange
access performance measurements as described in clause 4.4. Clause 4.5
describes the traffic distribution over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access
networks. Clause 4.6 provides a description for interworking with EPS network.
Clause 4.7 describes ATSSS when the ATSSS capable UE is interconnected with
EPS.
The architecture reference model for ATSSS support is described in clause
4.2.10 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
## 4.2 Multi-access PDU session
A PDU session supporting a multi-access PDU connectivity service is referred
to as multi-access PDU (MA PDU) session. An MA PDU session is a PDU session
which can use one 3GPP access network or one non-3GPP access network at a
time, or simultaneously one 3GPP access network and one non-3GPP access
network as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
An MA PDU session can be established when the UE is registered to the same
PLMN over 3GPP access network and non-3GPP access network or registered to
different PLMNs over 3GPP access network and non-3GPP access network
respectively. A UE can initiate MA PDU session establishment when the UE is
registered to a PLMN over both 3GPP access network and non-3GPP access
network, or only registered to one access network. Therefore, at any given
time, the MA PDU session can have user-plane resources established on both
3GPP access and non-3GPP access, or on one access only (either 3GPP access or
non-3GPP access), or can have no user-plane resources established on any
access.
An ATSSS capable UE can establish an MA PDU session based on the URSP rules as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.526 [5].
The following PDU session types are defined for an MA PDU session: IPv4, IPv6,
IPv4v6 and Ethernet.
NOTE 1: The unstructured PDU session type is not supported in this release of
the specification.
NOTE 2: An MA PDU session using IPv6 multi-homing or uplink classifier is not
specified in this release of the specification.
MA PDU sessions for LADN are not supported.
## 4.3 Steering functionalities
An ATSSS capable UE can use a steering functionality to steer, switch and
split the UL traffic across the 3GPP access network and the non-3GPP access
network as defined in clause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. An ATSSS capable
network can use the corresponding steering functionality for the DL traffic.
The UE and the network can support one or more steering functionalities as
defined in clause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], in the categories of:
a) high-layer steering functionalities i.e.:
i) the MPTCP steering functionality which operates above the IP layer, where
the UE and an associated MPTCP proxy functionality in the UPF can communicate
by using the MPTCP protocol; and
ii) the MPQUIC steering functionality which operates above the UDP/IP layer,
where the UE and an associated QUIC proxy in the UPF can communicate by using
the QUIC protocol; and
b) low-layer steering functionalities, i.e.:
i) the ATSSS-LL steering functionality which operates below the IP layer as a
data switching function.
## 4.4 Support of access performance measurements
The ATSSS capable UE can perform access performance measurements to decide how
to distribute traffic over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. The access
performance measurements can be performed by using the QoS flow(s) of default
QoS rule. Based on the UE capability that the UE has indicated to the network,
the access performance measurements can also be performed by using the QoS
flows of non-default QoS rules.
An ATSSS capable UE receives MAI from the SMF during the PDU session
establishment procedure for an MA PDU session as described in clause 5.32.5 of
3GPP TS 23.501 [2], during a network-requested PDU session modification
procedure as specified in clause 6.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6], during UE
requested PDN connectivity procedure according to clause 6.5.1 of 3GPP TS
24.301 [10] or during EPS bearer context modification procedure according to
clause 6.4.3 of 3GPP TS 24.301 [10]. The MAI can contain the addressing
information of the PMF in the UPF, as well as an indicator on whether access
availability/unavailability reports need to be sent to the network. If the UE
indicates to the network the capability to perform the access performance
measurements by using the QoS flows of non-default QoS rules, the MAI can also
indicate to the UE that the performance measurement is for the QoS flows of
non-default QoS rules and therefore include a QoS flow list for which, the
measurements are to be performed. The encoding of the MAI is specified in
clause 6.1.5.
An ATSSS capable UE that supports the MPTCP steering functionality can use the
measurements available at the MPTCP layer.
An ATSSS capable UE that supports the MPQUIC steering functionality can use
the measurements available at the MPQUIC layer.
The following PMF protocol messages can be exchanged between the PMF in the UE
and the PMF in the UPF:
a) messages for RTT measurements, only applicable for the ATSSS-LL steering
functionality;
b) messages for reporting access availability/unavailability by the UE to the
UPF;
c) messages for PLR measurements, only applicable for the ATSSS-LL steering
functionality; or
d) messages for UAD provisioning ;
e) messages for UAT ;
f) messages for TDS; or
g) messages for TDR.
An ATSSS capable UE does not apply the ATSSS rules to the PMF protocol
messages.
The performance measurement function protocol procedures are specified with
following procedures:
a) UE-initiated RTT measurement (see clause 5.4.3);
b) Network-initiated RTT measurement (see clause 5.4.4);
c) UE-initiated PLR measurement (see clause 5.4.6);
d) Network-initiated PLR measurement (see clause 5.4.7);
e) UE assistance data provisioning procedure (see clause 5.4.8);
f) The access availability/unavailability procedures (see clause 5.4.5);
g) UE assistance data termination procedure (see clause 5.4.9);
h) Traffic duplication suspend procedure (see clause 5.4.10); and
i) Traffic duplication resume procedure (see clause 5.4.11).
## 4.5 Distribution of traffic across 3GPP access and non-3GPP access networks
The UE can receive ATSSS rules during the PDU session establishment procedure
for an MA PDU session or network-requested PDU session modification procedure.
The ATSSS rule ID and ATSSS rule operation for each rule is used to add a new
ATSSS rule, or to delete or update an existing ATSSS rule. The UE can
distribute the UL traffic except for the PMF protocol messages across the 3GPP
access network and the non-3GPP access network according to the ATSSS rules
and other local conditions (such as network interface availability, signal
loss conditions, user preferences, etc.).
NOTE: On the network side, the SMF configures relevant N4 rules according to
the ATSSS control information provided by the PCF for the UPF to distribute DL
traffic across two access networks.
## 4.6 EPS interworking
In the network supporting N26 interface:
a) if the UE established an MA PDU session over non-3GPP access only, no EPS
bearer identity can be assigned to any QoS flow of the MA PDU session as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3];
b) if the UE established an MA PDU session over 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access and the user plane of the MA PDU session over 3GPP access is released,
the EPS bearer identity assigned for the MA PDU session can be revoked as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3];
c) for an inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode:
1) if the UE established an MA PDU session over 3GPP access only, the UE
follows the procedure as specified in clause 6.1.4.1 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]; or
2) if the UE established an MA PDU session over 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access, the UE follows the procedure as specified in clause 6.1.4.1 of 3GPP TS
24.501 [6], and
A) if the MA PDU session is transferred to EPS as a PDN connection and the UE
did not indicate its support of establishing a PDN connection as the user
plane resource of an MA PDU session during the MA PDU session establishment
procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6], the SMF can
initiate the network-requested PDU session release procedure over non-3GPP
access as specified in clause 6.3.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] or perform a local
release of the MA PDU session. The UE performs a local release of the MA PDU
session over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access;
NOTE 1: If the UE receives from the network a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND
message which indicates to release the MA PDU session over non-3GPP access and
the UE has already performed or is performing a local release of the MA PDU
session, the error handling as specified in clause 6.3.3.6 of 3GPP TS 24.501
[6] is applied.
NOTE 2: The QoS flow(s) with EBI assigned over non-3GPP access is also
transferred to the corresponding PDN connection.
B) if the MA PDU session is transferred to EPS as a PDN connection and the UE
indicated its support of establishing a PDN connection as the user plane
resource of an MA PDU session during the MA PDU session establishment
procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6], the SMF can
keep the MA PDU session over non-3GPP access; or
C) if the MA PDU session is not transferred to EPS as a PDN connection and the
SMF decides to move the traffic of the MA PDU session from 3GPP access to
non-3GPP access, the SMF can initiate the network-requested PDU session
modification procedure as specified in clause 6.3.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6];
and
3) if the UE established an MA PDU session with the user-plane resource over
3GPP access and the user-plane resource with the PDN connection over untrusted
non-3GPP access network, the UE follows the procedure as specified in clause

the MA PDU session over untrusted non-3GPP access.
B) if the MA PDU session is not transferred to EPS as a PDN connection and the
SMF decides to move the traffic of the MA PDU session from 3GPP access to
untrusted non-3GPP access, the SMF can initiate the tunnel modification
procedure as specified in clause 7.4.2 of 3GPP TS 24.302 [17]; and
d) for an inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, if the UE requests an
MA PDU session or the related URSP or UE local configuration does not mandate
that the PDU session is established over a single access when transferring the
PDN connection to 3GPP access, the PDN connection can be converted by the
network to an MA PDU session via the UE-requested PDU session modification
procedure (see clause 5.2.5).

# 5 ATSSS control procedures
## 5.1 Introduction
The ATSSS control procedures include:
a) multi-access PDU connectivity service procedures (see clause 5.2);
b) multi-access PDU connectivity over E-UTRAN and non-3GPP access network (see
clause 5.3); and
c) performance measurement function protocol procedures (see clause 5.4).
In clause 5.2, multi-access PDU connectivity service procedures include
following management procedures:
a) activation of multi-access PDU connectivity service;
b) re-activation of user-plane resources;
c) release of user-plane resources;
d) updating ATSSS parameters;
e) converting PDU session transferred from EPS to MA PDU session; and
f) PDU session establishment with network modification to MA PDU session.
In clause 5.3, the multi-access PDU connectivity procedures over E-UTRAN and
non-3GPP access network are specified.
In clause 5.4, performance measurement function protocol procedures are
performed by exchanges of PMF protocol messages between the PMF in a UE and
the PMF in the UPF over the user plane. For MA PDU sessions of IPv4, IPv6, or
IPv4v6 PDU session type, the PMF protocol messages are transported using UDP.
For MA PDU sessions of Ethernet PDU session type, the PMF protocol messages
are transported using Ethernet frames. The protocol stacks of the PMF protocol
are specified in clause 5.32.5.4 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
## 5.2 Multi-access PDU connectivity service
### 5.2.1 Activation of multi-access PDU connectivity service
Activating multi-access PDU connectivity service refers to the establishment
of user-plane resources on both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access:
a) if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in the
same PLMN, the UE shall initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over a selected
access, either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access. Over which access to initiate
this UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure is UE implementation
specific. When the UE receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message
including the ATSSS container IE as specified in clause 6.4.1.3 of 3GPP TS
24.501 [6], the UE shall consider that the MA PDU session has been established
and the user plane resources are successfully established on the selected
access. When the user plane resources are established on the access other than
the selected access (e.g. received lower layer indication in 3GPP access or
established user plane IPsec SA in untrusted non-3GPP access), the UE shall
consider the user plane resources are established on both;
NOTE: If the UE receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message
including the ATSSS container IE and fails to receive user plane resources
established on the access other than the selected access, upon an
implementation specific timer expiry the UE re-initiates the UE-requested PDU
session establishment procedure over the access other than the selected
access, in order to establish user plane resources on the access other than
the selected access.
b) if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in
different PLMNs, the UE shall initiate the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]
over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access sequentially. Over which access to first
initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure is UE
implementation specific. When the UE receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
ACCEPT message including the ATSSS container IE as specified in clause 6.4.1.3
of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over the selected access, the UE shall consider that the
MA PDU session has been established and the user plane resources of the MA PDU
session on this access are successfully established. The UE shall then
initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure with the same
PDU session ID, as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over the
other access, in order to establish user plane resources on the other access
for the MA PDU session. If the UE receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
ACCEPT message as specified in clause 6.4.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over the
other access, the UE shall consider that the user plane resources of the MA
PDU session have been established on both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access; or
c) if the UE is registered to a PLMN over only one access, either 3GPP access
or non-3GPP access, the UE shall initiate the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]
over this access. When the UE receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT
message including the ATSSS container IE as specified in clause 6.4.1.3 of
3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over the access, the UE shall consider that the MA PDU
session has been established and the user plane resources of the MA PDU
session on this access are successfully established. When the UE at a later
point in time registers over the other access, either in the same PLMN or in a
different PLMN, the UE shall initiate the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure with the same PDU session ID as specified in clause
6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over the other access in order to establish user
plane resources on the other access for the MA PDU session. If the UE receives
the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message as specified in clause 6.4.1.3 of
3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over the other access, the UE shall consider that the user
plane resources of the MA PDU session have been established over both 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access.
If the UE is in the non-allowed area, the UE shall not initiate a PDU session
establishment procedure for an MA PDU session over the 3GPP access. It may
still initiate a PDU session establishment procedure for an MA PDU session
over the non-3GPP access other than wireline access network, however the
network shall not establish user plane resources for the 3GPP access if the UE
is in the non-allowed area. The handling of non-allowed area when using
wireline access is described in 3GPP TS 23.316 [4].
### 5.2.2 Re-activation of user-plane resources
In order to re-establish the user-plane resources of an MA PDU session:
a) if the UE requests re-establishment of the user-plane resources of the MA
PDU session over 3GPP access which were released, the UE shall include the
Uplink data status IE indicating the related MA PDU session,
1) in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message when the registration procedure for
mobility and periodic registration update is initiated by the UE over 3GPP
access as specified in clause 5.5.1.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]; or
2) in the SERVICE REQUEST message when the service request procedure initiated
by the UE over 3GPP access as specified in clause 5.6.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501
[6];
b) if the UE requests re-establishment of the user-plane resources of the MA
PDU session over non-3GPP access which were released and the UE is in 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access, the UE shall include the Uplink data
status IE indicating the related MA PDU session,
1) in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message when the registration procedure for
mobility registration update is initiated by the UE over non-3GPP access as
specified in clause 5.5.1.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]; or
2) in the SERVICE REQUEST message when the service request procedure initiated
by the UE over non-3GPP access as specified in clause 5.6.1.2 of 3GPP TS
24.501 [6];
c) if the UE requests re-establishment of the user-plane resources of the MA
PDU session over non-3GPP access which were released and the UE is in 5GMM-
IDLE mode over non-3GPP access,
1) for untrusted non-3GPP access, the UE shall perform the procedure as
specified in clause 7.3 of 3GPP TS 24.502 [7] and include the Uplink data
status IE indicating the related MA PDU session in the SERVICE REQUEST message
when the service request procedure initiated by the UE over non-3GPP access as
specified in clause 5.6.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]; or
2) for trusted non-3GPP access, the UE shall perform the procedures as
specified in clause 7.3A of 3GPP TS 24.502 [7] and include the Uplink data
status IE indicating the related MA PDU session in the SERVICE REQUEST message
when the service request procedure initiated by the UE over non-3GPP access as
specified in clause 5.6.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]; and
d) if the network requests re-establishment of the user-plane resources of the
MA PDU session, the UE shall initiate the service request procedure by sending
a SERVICE REQUEST message to the AMF upon receipt of the paging request as
specified in clause 5.6.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] or shall follow the
procedure specified in clause 5.6.3 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] upon receipt of a
NOTIFICATION message.
If the UE is in the non-allowed area, the UE shall not request re-
establishment of the user plane resources of the MA PDU session for the 3GPP
access. It may still request re-establishment of the user plane resources of
the MA PDU session for the non-3GPP access.
### 5.2.3 Release of user-plane resources
In order to release the MA PDU session:
a) the SMF shall initiate the network-requested PDU session release procedure
as specified in clause 6.3.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over 3GPP access or
non-3GPP access, by sending the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message to the UE.
Over which access to initiate this network-requested PDU session release
procedure is SMF implementation specific; or
b) the UE shall initiate the UE-requested PDU session release procedure as
specified in clause 6.4.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over 3GPP access or non-3GPP
access by sending the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message to the network. Over
which access to initiate this UE-requested PDU session release procedure is UE
implementation specific.
When the UE receives the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message, the UE shall
behave as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] clause 6.3.3.3.
In order to release the MA PDU session\'s user-plane resources on either 3GPP
access or non-3GPP access, the SMF shall initiate the network-requested PDU
session release procedure as specified in clause 6.3.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]
over 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, by sending the PDU SESSION RELEASE
COMMAND message with the Access type IE indicating of which access the user-
plane resources are released to the UE, e.g. when the AMF indicates to the SMF
that the UE is deregistered over an access or when S-NSSAI of the MA PDU
session is not in the Allowed NSSAI over an access. Over which access to
initiate this network-requested PDU session release procedure is SMF
implementation specific. When the UE receives the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND
message, the UE shall behave as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] clause
6.3.3.3, and consider that the user plane resources of the MA PDU session have
been released on the access indicated in the Access type IE.
### 5.2.4 Updating ATSSS parameters
An SMF may update ATSSS parameters, i.e. the ATSSS rules, and the MAI,
according to the procedure for the network-requested PDU session modification
as specified in clause 6.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over 3GPP access network or
non-3GPP access network. The ATSSS rules may be individually added, deleted or
updated using the ATSSS rule ID and ATSSS rule operation. The SMF may change
the access network over which the traffic of the GBR QoS flow is transmitted
by updating the UE\'s ATSSS rules. The SMF may change the QoS flows over which
access performance measurements may be performed by updating the MAI.
### 5.2.5 Converting PDU session transferred from EPS to MA PDU session
When an ATSSS capable UE has transferred a PDN connection from S1 mode to N1
mode in the network supporting N26 interface and the related URSP or UE local
configuration does not mandate the PDU session shall be established over a
single access:
a) if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in the
same PLMN, and the S-NSSAI associated with the PDU session over 3GPP access is
included in the allowed NSSAI of non-3GPP access, the UE may initiate the UE-
requested PDU session modification procedure by sending the PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message including 5GSM capability IE over 3GPP access as
specified in clause 6.4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]. The UE may set the Request
type IE to either:
1) \"modification request\" and include the MA PDU session information IE set
to \"MA PDU session network upgrade is allowed\" as defined in clause
9.11.3.31A of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]; or
2) \"MA PDU request\"
in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message as specified in clause 8.2.10 of 3GPP TS
24.501 [6]. When the UE receives the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message
including the ATSSS container IE as specified in clause 6.4.2.3 of 3GPP TS
24.501 [6], the UE shall consider that the requested PDU session was converted
by the network to an MA PDU session and the user plane resources are
successfully established on 3GPP access. When the user plane resources are
established on the non-3GPP access (e.g., received established user plane
IPsec SA in untrusted non-3GPP access), the UE shall consider the user plane
resources are established on both accesses;
NOTE: If the UE receives the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message
including the ATSSS container IE and fails to receive user plane resources
established on the non-3GPP access, upon an implementation specific timer
expiry the UE initiates the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure
over the non-3GPP access, in order to establish user plane resources on the
non-3GPP access.
b) if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in
different PLMNs, the UE may initiate the UE-requested PDU session modification
procedure by sending the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message including
5GSM capability IE over 3GPP access as specified in clause 6.4.2.2 of 3GPP TS
24.501 [6]. The UE may set the Request type IE to either:
1) \"modification request\" and include the MA PDU session information IE set
to \"MA PDU session network upgrade is allowed\" as defined in clause
9.11.3.31A of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]; or
2) \"MA PDU request\"
in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message as specified in clause 8.2.10 of 3GPP TS
24.501 [6]. When the UE receives the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message
including the ATSSS container IE as specified in clause 6.4.2.3 of 3GPP TS
24.501 [6], the UE shall consider that the requested PDU session was converted
by the network to an MA PDU session and the user plane resources are
successfully established on 3GPP access. The UE shall then initiate the UE-
requested PDU session establishment procedure with the same PDU session ID, as
specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over non-3GPP access, in
order to establish user plane resources on the other access for the MA PDU
session; or
c) if the UE is registered over 3GPP access only, the UE may initiate the UE-
requested PDU session modification procedure by sending the PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION REQUEST message including 5GSM capability IE over 3GPP access as
specified in clause 6.4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6], The UE may set the Request
type IE to either:
1) \"modification request\" and include the MA PDU session information IE set
to \"MA PDU session network upgrade is allowed\" as defined in clause
9.11.3.31A of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]; or
2) \"MA PDU request\"
in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message as specified in clause 8.2.10 of 3GPP TS
24.501 [6]. When the UE receives the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message
including the ATSSS container IE as specified in clause 6.4.2.3 of 3GPP TS
24.501 [6], the UE shall consider that the requested PDU session was converted
by the network to an MA PDU session and the user plane resources are
successfully established on 3GPP access. When the UE at a later point in time
registers over the non-3GPP access, either in the same PLMN or in a different
PLMN, the UE shall initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure with the same PDU session ID as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP
TS 24.501 [6] over non-3GPP access in order to establish user plane resources
on non-3GPP access for the MA PDU session.
### 5.2.6 PDU session establishment with network modification to MA PDU
session
When an ATSSS capable UE establishes a new PDU session and the related URSP or
UE local configuration does not mandate the PDU session shall be established
over a single access:
a) if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in the
same PLMN and the UE initiates the UE-requested PDU session establishment
procedure over a selected access, either 3GPP access or non-3GPP acc _ess, the
UE may include_ the MA PDU session information IE in the UL NAS TRANSPORT
message and set the IE to \"MA PDU session network upgrade is allowed\" as
defined in clause 9.11.3.31A of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]. When the UE receives the
PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message including the ATSSS container IE as
specified in clause 6.4.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6], the UE shall consider that
the requested PDU session is established as an MA PDU session and the user
plane resources are successfully established on the selected access. When the
user plane resources are established on the access other than the selected
access (e.g. received lower layer indication in 3GPP access or established
user plane IPsec SA in untrusted non-3GPP access), the UE shall consider the
user plane resources are successfully established on both accesses;
NOTE: If the UE receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message
including the ATSSS container IE and fails to receive user plane resources
established on the access other than the selected access, upon an
implementation specific timer expiry the UE re-initiates the UE-requested PDU
session establishment procedure over the access other than the selected
access, in order to establish user plane resources on the access other than
the selected access.
b) if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in
different PLMNs and the UE initiates the UE-requested PDU session
establishment procedure over 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, the UE may
include the MA PDU session information IE in the UL NAS TRANSPORT message and
shall set the IE to \"MA PDU session network upgrade is allowed\" as defined
in clause 9.11.3.31A of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]. When the UE receives the PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message including the ATSSS container IE as
specified in clause 6.4.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over the access, the UE
shall consider that the requested PDU session is established as an MA PDU
session and the user plane resources are established on this access. The UE
shall then initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure with
the same PDU session ID, as specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]
over the other access, in order to establish user plane resources on the other
access for the MA PDU session. If the UE receives the PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message including the ATSSS container IE as specified in
clause 6.4.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over the other access, the UE shall
consider that the user plane resources of the MA PDU session have been
established on both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access; or
c) if the UE is registered to a PLMN over only one access, either 3GPP access
or non-3GPP access, and the UE requests to establish a PDU session over this
access, the UE may include the MA PDU session information IE in the UL NAS
TRANSPORT message and shall set the IE to \"MA PDU session network upgrade is
allowed\" as defined in clause 9.11.3.31A of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6]. When the UE
receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message including the ATSSS
container IE as specified in clause 6.4.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over the
access, the UE shall consider that the requested PDU session is established as
an MA PDU session and the user plane resources are established on this access.
When the UE at a later point in time registers over the other access, either
in the same PLMN or in a different PLMN, the UE shall initiate the UE-
requested PDU session establishment procedure with the same PDU session ID as
specified in clause 6.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] over the other access in
order to establish user plane resources on the other access for the MA PDU
session. If the UE receives the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message
including the ATSSS container IE as specified in clause 6.4.1.3 of 3GPP TS
24.501 [6] over the other access, the UE shall consider that the user plane
resources of the MA PDU session have been established on both 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access.
## 5.3 Multi-access PDU connectivity over E-UTRAN and non-3GPP access network
### 5.3.0 General
If the UE supports MA PDU session and procedures for PDN connection
establishment as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [10], then the UE shall also
support handling as described in clauses 5.3.1 and 5.3.2.
NOTE: The PDN connection established as a user plane resource of an MA PDU
session is not applicable for CIoT EPS optimizations in this release of
specification.

[2], the UE shall set the ATSSS-ST field to \"ATSSS Low-Layer functionality
with any steering mode supported\";
NOTE 2: The ATSSS Low-Layer functionality cannot be used together with the
redundant steering mode. When the UE indicates that it is capable of
supporting the ATSSS [Low-Layer]{.underline} functionality with any steering
mode, it implies that the UE supports the ATSSS [Low-Layer]{.underline}
functionality with any steering mode except the redundant steering mode.
2) if the UE supports MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL
functionality with only active-standby steering mode as specified in clause

functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with only
active-standby steering mode supported\";
5) if the UE supports MPQUIC functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL
functionality with any steering mode as specified in clause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS
23.501 [2], the UE shall set the ATSSS-ST field to \"MPQUIC functionality with
any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode
supported\";
6) if the UE supports MPTCP functionality with any steering mode, MPQUIC
functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with only
active-standby steering mode as specified in clause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501
[2], the UE shall set the ATSSS-ST field to \"MPTCP functionality with any
steering mode, MPQUIC functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL
functionality with only active-standby steering mode supported\"; or
7) if the UE supports MPTCP functionality with any steering mode, MPQUIC
functionality with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with any
steering mode as specified in clause 5.32.6 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], the UE
shall set the ATSSS-ST field to \"MPTCP functionality with any steering mode,

any steering mode supported\".
Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message of a
default EPS bearer context activation procedure as a response to the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [10], the ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message containing the extended protocol
configuration options IE with the ATSSS response with the length of two octets
PCO parameter:
a) the UE shall consider that the MA PDU session is established based on
parameters from the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection, as
follows:
1) the PDN type of the default EPS bearer context shall be mapped to the PDU
session type of the MA PDU session as follows:
i) if the PDN type is \"IPv4\", the PDU session type is set to \"IPv4\";
ii) if the PDN type is \"IPv6\", the PDU session type is set to \"IPv6\";
iii) if the PDN type is \"IPv4v6\", the PDU session type is set to \"IPv4v6\";

i) if the ESM cause is #50 \"PDN type IPv4 only allowed\", the 5GSM cause of
the MA PDU session is set to #50 \"PDU session type IPv4 only allowed\"; or
ii) if the ESM cause is #51 \"PDN type IPv6 only allowed\", the 5GSM cause of
the MA PDU session is set to #51 \"PDU session type IPv6 only allowed\";
and that the PDN connection is established as a user-plane resource of the MA
PDU session;
b) if the network steering functionalities information is included in the
ATSSS response with the length of two octets PCO parameter, the UE shall use
the network steering functionalities information; and
c) if the measurement assistance information is included in the ATSSS response
with the length of two octets PCO parameter, the UE shall use the measurement
assistance information.
Upon receipt of:
a) a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message as a response to the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [10]; or
b) an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message of a default EPS

the UE shall consider that the MA PDU session is not established and the PDN
connection is not established as a user-plane resource of the MA PDU session.
### 5.3.2 UE establishing a PDN connection as a user-plane resource of an
already established MA PDU session
In order to establish a PDN connection as a user-plane resource of an already
established MA PDU session, the UE shall initiate the UE requested PDN
connectivity procedure according to 3GPP TS 24.301 [10].
In the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message or, when applicable, in the ESM
INFORMATION RESPONSE message, of the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure:
a) the UE shall set the request type to \"handover\" as specified in 3GPP TS
24.301 [10];
NOTE 1: According to 3GPP TS 24.301 [10], the PDU session ID of the already
established MA PDU session is included in the protocol configuration options
IE or the extended protocol configuration options IE of the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message with the request type \"handover\".
b) the UE shall set the PDN Type IE to \"IPv4\", \"IPv6\", \"IPv4v6\",
\"Ethernet\" or \"non-IP\"; and
NOTE 2: If the UE does not support Ethernet PDN type or the Ethernet PDN type
is not supported in EPC, the UE sets \"non-IP\" PDN type when the established
MA PDU session is Ethernet PDU session type.
c) in the protocol configuration options or extended protocol configuration
options IE, the UE shall include the ATSSS request PCO parameter.
Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message of a
default EPS bearer context activation procedure as a response to the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [10], the UE shall
consider that the PDN connection is established as a user-plane resource of

## 5.4 Performance measurement function (PMF) protocol (PMFP) procedures
### 5.4.1 General
Performance measurement function protocol (PMFP) procedures are performed
between a performance measurement function (PMF) in a UE and a PMF in the UPF.
The following UE-initiated PMFP procedures are specified:
a) UE-initiated RTT measurement procedure; and
b) access availability or unavailability report procedure;
c) UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure;
d) UE assistance data provisioning procedure; and
e) UE assistance data termination procedure.
The following UPF-initiated PMFP procedures are specified:
a) UPF-initiated RTT measurement procedure;
b) UPF-initiated PLR measurement procedure;
c) traffic duplication suspend procedure; and
d) traffic duplication resume procedure.
The UE-initiated PMFP procedures and the UPF-initiated PMFP procedures can be
performed:
a) on the user plane of an MA PDU session via either 3GPP access or non-3GPP
access in 5GS if the MAI is provided to the UE during establishment of the MA
PDU session; or
b) on the user plane of the PDN connection established as the user plane
resource of an MA PDU session via 3GPP access in EPS or the user plane of the
MA PDU session via non-3GPP access in 5GS as specified in clause 5.3.
PMFP messages are transported in an IP packet or an Ethernet frame according
to clause 5.3.2.
If the UE supports performance measurement function protocol procedures for
the QoS flow of a non-default QoS rule, the UE indicates its \"access
performance measurements per QoS flow\" capability as defined in clause
9.11.4.1 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [6] to the SMF. If the SMF determines that PMFP
using the QoS flow of the non-default QoS rule is applied to the MA PDU
session for the UE, the SMF provides the UE with the MAI including a list of
QoS flows over which access performance measurements may be performed. The UE
performs the RTT measurement procedure or the PLR measurement procedure over
the QoS flow(s) as indicated in the received MAI.
NOTE 1: In this release of the specification, for the PDN connection
established as a user-plane resource of an MA PDU session, the PMFP procedures
are only performed over the default EPS bearer of the PDN connection.
If the UPF receives the indication from the SMF that the performance
measurement is for QoS flow(s) of the non-default QoS rule, the UPF performs
the RTT measurement procedure or the PLR measurement procedure over the QoS
flow(s) of non-default QoS rule as indicated by the SMF. Otherwise, the UPF
performs the RTT measurement procedure or the PLR measurement procedure over
the QoS flow of the default QoS rule
PMFP messages, transported between the UE and the UPF over one (or more) QoS
flows of a non-default QoS rule, are specified in clause 5.4.2.1.3.
PMFP messages transported between the UE and the UPF (and vice versa) are
protected using the security mechanisms protecting the user data packets
transported over NG-RAN or non-3GPP access connected to the 5GCN and over the
N3 and N9 reference points, are specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [14]. A PMFP-
specific security mechanism is not specified.
NOTE 2: Even though transport of PMFP messages between the UE and the UPF is
protected, a compromised UE can send false or incorrect PMFP messages.
PMFP is a standard L3 protocol according to 3GPP TS 24.007 [13], PMFP messages
are standard L3 messages according to 3GPP TS 24.007 [13] and error behaviour
specified for L3 protocol in according to 3GPP TS 24.007 [13] applies for
PMFP.
The access availability or unavailability report procedure, the traffic
duplication suspend procedure and the traffic duplication resume procedure are
only performed over the QoS flow of the default QoS rule, or over the default
EPS bearer of the PDN connection established as a user-plane resource.

address of the PMF in the UPF associated with an access, included in the
measurement assistance information provided to the UE.
In order to enable the UPF to discover the MAC address of the PMF in the UE of
an MA PDU session of Ethernet PDU session type, the UE shall perform an access
availability or unavailability report procedure over an access immediately
after the MA PDU session is established. If the MA PDU session is established
over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, the UE may use either of the
accesses for the access availability or unavailability report procedure. If
the access availability or unavailability report procedure is aborted, the UE
shall repeat the access availability or unavailability report procedure over
the same access or, if the MA PDU session is established over both 3GPP access
and non-3GPP access, over the other access.
##### 5.4.2.1.3 PMFP message transport associated with QoS flow
In this release of specification, RTT measurement procedure and PLR
measurement procedure can be performed per QoS flow.
In order to transport PMFP ECHO REQUEST message, PMFP ECHO RESPONSE message,
PMFP PLR COUNT REQUEST message, PMFP PLR COUNT RESPONSE message, PMFP PLR
REPORT REQUEST message and PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message over the specific
QoS flows, SMF shall provide the UE with the QoS rules including the packet

flow in the MAI. The SMF shall ensure the UDP port or the MAC address is
unique within the PDU session.
NOTE: The SMF providing the UPF with the UL PDR including the UDP port or the
MAC address associated with a QoS flow is specified in 3GPP TS 29.244 [16].
#### 5.4.2.2 Extended procedure transaction identity (EPTI)
The UE shall maintain the current available UE EPTI value. When the MA PDU
session is established, the UE shall set the current available UE EPTI value
to 0000H. When a UE-initiated PMFP procedure is initiated, the UE shall
allocate the current available UE EPTI value to the UE-initiated PMFP
procedure and:
\- if the current available UE EPTI value is 7FFFH, shall set the current
available UE EPTI value to 0000H; or
\- otherwise, shall increase the current available UE EPTI value by one.
The UE shall release the EPTI value allocated to the UE-initiated PMFP
procedure when the UE-initiated PMFP procedure completes or is aborted.
The UPF shall maintain the current available UPF EPTI value. When the MA PDU
session is established, the UPF shall set the current available UPF EPTI value
to 8000H. When a UPF-initiated PMFP procedure is initiated, the UPF shall
allocate the current available UPF EPTI value to the UPF-initiated PMFP
procedure and:

### 5.4.3 UE-initiated RTT measurement procedure
#### 5.4.3.1 General
The purpose of the UE-initiated RTT measurement procedure is to enable the UE
to measure the RTT of an exchange of user data packets between the UE and the
UPF over an access of an MA PDU session.
The UE-initiated RTT measurement procedure can be performed over an access of
an MA PDU session only when the UE has user-plane resources on the access of
the MA PDU session.
#### 5.4.3.2 UE-initiated RTT measurement procedure initiation
In order to initiate a UE-initiated RTT measurement procedure over an access
of an MA PDU session, the UE shall allocate an EPTI value as specified in
clause 5.4.2.2 and shall create one or more PMFP ECHO REQUEST messages. The
number of created PMFP ECHO REQUEST messages is UE implementation specific. In
each PMFP ECHO REQUEST message, the UE:
a) shall set the EPTI IE to the allocated EPTI value;
b) shall set the RI IE to a unique value identifying the particular PMFP ECHO
REQUEST message within the transaction; and.
c) if the upper layers request a particular length of PMFP messages, shall
include the Padding IE such that length of the PMFP message becomes equal to
the requested length.
The UE shall start a timer T101 and shall send the one or more PMFP ECHO
REQUEST messages over the access of the MA PDU session.
An example of the UE-initiated RTT measurement procedure is shown in figure
5.3.3.2-1.
Figure 5.4.3.2-1: UE-initiated RTT measurement procedure
#### 5.4.3.3 UE-initiated RTT measurement procedure completion
Upon reception of the PMFP ECHO REQUEST message, the UPF shall create a PMFP
ECHO RESPONSE message. In the PMFP ECHO RESPONSE message, the UPF shall set
the EPTI IE to the EPTI value in the PMFP ECHO REQUEST message and shall set
the RI IE to the RI value in the PMFP ECHO REQUEST message. If the PMFP ECHO
REQUEST message contains the Padding IE, the UPF shall include the Padding IE
such that length of the PMFP message becomes equal to length of the received
PMFP message. The UPF shall send the PMFP ECHO RESPONSE message over the
access of the MA PDU session via which the PMFP ECHO REQUEST message was
received.
Upon reception of a PMFP ECHO RESPONSE message with the same EPTI as the
allocated EPTI value and with the RI value of a sent PMFP ECHO REQUEST
message, the UE shall determine the RTT value for the request identified by
the RI value by subtracting the current value of the timer T101 from the value
of the timer T101 valid when the PMFP ECHO REQUEST with the RI value was sent.
When a PMFP ECHO RESPONSE message with the same EPTI as the allocated EPTI
value has been received for each sent PMFP ECHO REQUEST message, the UE shall
calculate an average of the RTT values for the requests, shall stop the timer
T101.
#### 5.4.3.4 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Expiration of the timer T101
Upon expiration of the timer T101, the UE shall abort the procedure, shall
calculate an average of the RTT values for the requests for which a response
was received and shall count the number of requests for which no response was
received.
### 5.4.4 Network-initiated RTT measurement procedure
#### 5.4.4.1 General
The purpose of the UPF-initiated RTT measurement procedure is to enable the
UPF to measure the RTT of an exchange of user data packets between the UPF and
the UE over an access of an MA PDU session.
The UPF-initiated RTT measurement procedure can be performed over an access of
an MA PDU session only when the UE has user-plane resources on the access of
the MA PDU session.
#### 5.4.4.2 UPF-initiated RTT measurement procedure initiation
In order to initiate a UPF-initiated RTT measurement procedure over an access
of an MA PDU session, the UPF shall allocate a EPTI value as specified in
clause 5.4.2.2 and shall create one or more PMFP ECHO REQUEST messages. The
number of created PMFP ECHO REQUEST messages is UPF implementation specific.
In each PMFP ECHO REQUEST message, the UPF:
a) shall set the EPTI IE to the allocated EPTI value;
b) shall set the RI IE to a unique value identifying the particular PMFP ECHO
REQUEST message within the transaction; and
c) if the upper layers request a particular length of PMFP messages, shall
include the Padding IE such that length of the PMFP message becomes equal to
the requested length.
The UPF shall start a timer T201 and shall send the one or more PMFP ECHO
REQUEST messages over the access of the MA PDU session.
An example of the UPF-initiated RTT measurement procedure is shown in figure
5.4.4.2-1.
Figure 5.4.4.2-1: UPF-initiated RTT measurement procedure
#### 5.4.4.3 UPF-initiated RTT measurement procedure completion
Upon reception of the PMFP ECHO REQUEST message, the UE shall create a PMFP
ECHO RESPONSE message. In the PMFP ECHO RESPONSE message, the UE shall set the
EPTI IE to the EPTI value in the PMFP ECHO REQUEST message and shall set the
RI IE to the RI value in the PMFP ECHO REQUEST message. If the PMFP ECHO
REQUEST message contains the Padding IE, the UE shall include the Padding IE
such that length of the PMFP message becomes equal to length of the received
PMFP message. The UE shall send the PMFP ECHO RESPONSE message over the access
of the MA PDU session via which the PMFP ECHO REQUEST message was received.
Upon reception of a PMFP ECHO RESPONSE message with the same EPTI as the
allocated EPTI value and with the RI value of a sent PMFP ECHO REQUEST
message, the UPF shall determine the RTT value for the request identified by
the RI value by subtracting the current value of the timer T201 from the
starting value of the timer T201 valid when the PMFP ECHO REQUEST with the RI
value was sent.
When a PMFP ECHO RESPONSE message with the same EPTI as the allocated EPTI
value has been received for each sent PMFP ECHO REQUEST message, the UPF shall
calculate an average of the RTT values for the requests, shall stop the timer
T201.
#### 5.4.4.4 Abnormal cases in the network
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Expiration of the timer T201
Upon expiration of the timer T201, the UPF shall abort the procedure, shall
calculate an average of the RTT values for the requests for which a response
was received and shall count the number of requests for which no response was
received.
### 5.4.5 Access availability or unavailability report procedure
#### 5.4.5.1 General
The purpose of the access availability or unavailability report procedure is
to enable the UE to inform the UPF about availability or unavailability of an
access of an MA PDU session.
#### 5.4.5.2 Access availability or unavailability report procedure initiation
In order to initiate an access availability or unavailability report procedure
over an access of an MA PDU session, the UE shall allocate a EPTI value as
specified in clause 5.4.2.2 and shall create a PMFP ACCESS REPORT message. In
the PMFP ACCESS REPORT message, the UE shall set the EPTI IE to the allocated
EPTI value. The UE shall send the PMFP ACCESS REPORT message over the access
of the MA PDU session and shall start a timer T102.
An example of the access availability or unavailability report procedure is
shown in figure 5.4.5.2-1.
Figure 5.4.5.2-1: Access availability or unavailability report procedure
#### 5.4.5.3 Access availability or unavailability report procedure completion
Upon reception of the PMFP ACCESS REPORT message, the UPF shall create a PMFP
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message. In the PMFP ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message, the UPF shall
set the EPTI IE to the EPTI value in the PMFP ACCESS REPORT message. The UPF
shall send the PMFP ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message over the access of the MA PDU
session via which the PMFP ACCESS REPORT message was received.
Upon reception of a PMFP ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message with the same EPTI as the
allocated EPTI value, the UE shall stop the timer T102.
#### 5.4.5.4 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Expiry of the timer T102
The UE shall, on the first expiry of the timer T102, retransmit the PMFP
ACCESS REPORT message and shall reset and start timer T102. This
retransmission is repeated up to four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer
T102, the UE shall abort the procedure.
### 5.4.6 UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure
#### 5.4.6.1 General
The purpose of the UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure is to enable the UE
to measure the PLR of UL traffic to the UPF over an access of an MA PDU
session.
The UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure can be performed over an access of
an MA PDU session only when the UE has user-plane resources on the access of
the MA PDU session. The UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure can be
performed for the QoS flow of the default QoS rule or the QoS flow of the non-
default QoS rule.
The UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure consists of following:
a) one UE-initiated PLR count procedure (see clause 5.4.6.2); and
b) one or more UE-initiated PLR report procedure (see clause 5.4.6.3).
If an indication to request restart of counting procedure is sent by the UE
and accepted by the UPF, the UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure consists
of more than one UE-initiated PLR report procedure. Otherwise, the UE-
initiated PLR measurement procedure consists of one UE-initiated PLR report
procedure.
The UE shall not initiate another PLR measurement procedure over the same QoS
flow on the same access until current UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure
is completed.
An example of UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure which consists of the two
procedures is shown in figure 5.4.6.1-1.
Figure 5.4.6.1-1: UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure
1\. The UE sends a PMFP PLR count request message to the UPF. If the UE-
initiated PLR measurement is to meaure the PLR of the SDF over a QoS flow of
the non-default QoS rule, the PMFP PLR count request message is transported
over the QoS flow of the non-default QoS rule. Otherwise, the PMFP PLR count
request message is transported over the QoS flow of the default QoS rule.
NOTE 1: In the UE-initiated PLR measurement procedure, all the PMFP messages
are transported over the same QoS flow on the same access.
2\. Upon sending the PMFP PLR count request message, the UE starts counting
the transmitted UL packets over the QoS flow.
3-4. Upon receiving the PMFP PLR count request message, the UPF starts
counting the received UL packets over the QoS flow which the PMFP PLR count
request message is received from and sends the PMFP PLR count response message
to the UE.
5-7. The UE sends a PMFP PLR report request message to request the UPF to
report the number of the counted UL packets and stops counting the transmitted
UL packets over the QoS flow. If the UE intends to request the UPF to restart
counting the UL packets, the UE can include an indication in the PMFP PLR
report request message and restart counting the transmitted UL packets over
the QoS flow.
8-10. Upon receiving the PMFP PLR report request message, the UPF stops
counting the UL packets and sends PMFP PLR report response message which
includes the number of the UL packets counted since the reception of the last
PMFP PLR count request message. If an indication to request restart of
counting procedure is received in the PMFP PLR report request message and
accepted by the UPF, the UPF restarts counting the received UL packets.
11\. The UE calculates the UL packet loss rate based on the local counting
result of the number of transmitted UL packets and the reported number of
received UL packets included in the PMFP PLR report response message. If the
UE includes an indication to request restart of counting in the PMFP PLR
report request message in step 5 and the UE receives PMFP PLR report response
message with an indication of restart counting is not accepted or without an
indication of restart counting, the UE shall abort the restart of PMFP PLR
measurement procedure.
12\. Same as step 5, if the UE restarts counting the transmitted UL packets as
specified in step 7.
13\. Same as step 6, if the UE restarts counting the transmitted UL packets as
specified in step 7.
14\. Same as step 7.
15\. Same as step 8, if the UPF restarts counting the received UL packets as
specified in step 9.
16\. Same as step 9.
17 Same as step 10, if the UPF restarts counting the transmitted UL packets as
specified in step 9.
18 Same as step 11, if the UE restarts counting the transmitted UL packets as
specified in step 7.
NOTE 2: When the UE requests and the UPF accepts the restart of counting,
there can be multiple occurrences of step 7, 9, and 12-18.
#### 5.4.6.2 UE-initiated PLR count procedure
##### 5.4.6.2.1 UE-initiated PLR count procedure initiation
In order to initiate a UE-initiated PLR count procedure over an access of an
MA PDU session, the UE shall:
\- allocate an EPTI value as specified in clause 5.4.2.2;
\- create a PMFP PLR COUNT REQUEST message;
\- set the EPTI IE of the PMFP PLR COUNT REQUEST message to the allocated EPTI
value;
\- send the PMFP PLR COUNT REQUEST message using the QoS flow indicated in the
MAI over the access of the MA PDU session;
\- start a timer T103 upon sending the PMFP PLR COUNT REQUEST message; and
\- start counting the transmitted UL packets over the QoS flow.
An example of the UE-initiated PLR count procedure is shown in figure
5.4.6.2.1-1.
Figure 5.4.6.2.1-1: UE-initiated PLR count procedure
##### 5.4.6.2.2 UE-initiated PLR count procedure completion
Upon receiving the PMFP PLR COUNT REQUEST message, the UPF shall:
\- create a PMFP PLR COUNT RESPONSE message;
\- set the EPTI IE of the PMFP PLR COUNT RESPONSE message to the EPTI value of
the received PMFP PLR COUNT REQUEST message;
\- send the PMFP PLR COUNT RESPONSE message over the access of the MA PDU
session via which the PMFP PLR COUNT REQUEST message was received; and
\- set the counted received UL packets, if any, to zero, and start counting
the received UL packets over the QoS flow on the same access which the PMFP
PLR COUNT REQUEST message is received.
Upon receiving PMFP PLR COUNT RESPONSE message with the same EPTI as the
allocated EPTI value of the sent PMFP PLR COUNT REQUEST message, the UE shall
stop the timer T103 and consider that the counting has started.
##### 5.4.6.2.3 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Expiration of the timer T103
Upon expiration of the timer T103, the UE shall abort the procedure.
#### 5.4.6.3 UE-initiated PLR report procedure
##### 5.4.6.3.1 UE-initiated PLR report procedure initiation
In order to initiate a UE-initiated PLR report procedure over an access of an
MA PDU session, the UE shall
\- allocate an EPTI value as specified in clause 5.4.2.2;
\- create a PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message;
\- set the EPTI IE of the PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message to the allocated
EPTI value; and
\- include the Additional measurement indication IE with \"RC\" bit set if the
UE intends to request the UPF to restart counting the UL packets.
Upon sending the PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message the UE shall:
\- start a timer T104;
\- stop counting the UL packets; and
\- restart counting the transmitted UL packets if the Additional measurement
indication IE with \"RC\" bit set is included in the PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST
message.
An example of the UE-initiated PLR report procedure is shown in figure
5.4.6.3.1-1.
Figure 5.4.6.3.1-1: UE-initiated PLR report procedure
##### 5.4.6.3.2 UE-initiated PLR report procedure completion
Upon receiving the PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message, the UPF shall:
\- create a PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message;
\- set the EPTI IE of the PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message to the EPTI value
of the received PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message;
\- stop counting the received UL packets and set the Counting result IE to the
number of counted received UL packets since the reception of the last PMFP PLR
COUNT REQUEST message over the QoS flow; and
\- include the Additional measurement indication IE with \"RC\" bit set if
accepting the request from the UE to restart counting the UL packets.
The UPF shall send the PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message over the QoS flow on
the same access which the PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message was received. Upon
sending the PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message, the UPF restarts counting the
received UL packets over the QoS flow on the same access which the PMFP PLR
REPORT REQUEST message is received if accepting the request from the UE to
restart counting the UL packets.
Upon receiving the PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message with the same EPTI as the
allocated EPTI value of the sent PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message, the UE
shall:
\- stop the timer T104; and
\- calculate the UL PLR over the QoS flow based on the number of the UL
packets counted locally and the number indicated in Counting result IE in the
received PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message.
##### 5.4.6.3.3 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Expiration of the timer T104
Upon expiration of the timer T104, the UE shall abort the UE-initiated PLR
measurement procedure.
### 5.4.7 Network-initiated PLR measurement procedure
#### 5.4.7.1 General
The purpose of the network-initiated PLR measurement procedure is to enable
the UPF to measure the PLR of DL traffic to the UE over an access of an MA PDU
session.
The network-initiated PLR measurement procedure can be performed over an
access of an MA PDU session only when there is user-plane resources on the
access of the MA PDU session. The network-initiated PLR measurement procedure
can be performed for the QoS flow of the default QoS rule or the QoS flow of
the non-default QoS rule. In the latter case, the SMF shall provide the UE
with the QoS rules including _downlink only or bidirectional packet filter
matching the SDF to be measured,_ unless reflective QoS is used for the SDF
during the PDU session establishment procedure or PDU session modification
procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [6].
The network-initiated PLR measurement procedure consists of following:
a) one network-initiated PLR count procedure (see clause 5.4.7.2); and
b) one or more network-initiated PLR report procedure (see clause 5.4.7.3).
If an indication to request restart of counting procedure is sent by the UPF
and accepted by the UE, the network-initiated PLR measurement procedure
consists of more than one network-initiated PLR report procedure. Otherwise,
the network-initiated PLR measurement procedure consists of one network-
initiated PLR report procedure.
The network shall not initiate another PLR measurement procedure over the same
QoS flow until current network-initiated PLR measurement procedure is
completed.
An example of network-initiated PLR measurement procedure which consists of
the two procedures is shown in figure 5.4.7.1-1.
Figure 5.4.7.1-1: Network-initiated PLR measurement procedure
1\. The UPF sends a PMFP PLR count request message to the UE. If the network-
initiated PLR measurement is to measure the PLR of the SDF over a QoS flow of
the non-default QoS rule, the PMFP PLR count request message is transported
over the QoS flow of the non-default QoS rule. Otherwise, the PMFP PLR count
request message is transported over the QoS flow of the default QoS rule.
NOTE 1: In the network-initiated PLR measurement procedure, all the PMFP
messages are transported over the same QoS flow on the same access of the MA
PDU session.
2\. Upon sending the PMFP PLR count request message, the UPF starts counting
the transmitted DL packets over the QoS flow.
3-4. Upon receiving the PMFP PLR count request message, the UE starts counting
the received DL packets over the QoS flow which the PMFP PLR count request
message is received from and sends the PMFP PLR count response message to the
UPF. In order to determine the QFI of the received PMFP PLR count request
message, the UE:
\- learns the QFI from the header of the received message (e.g. in the SDAP
header as specified in 3GPP TS 37.324 [15]); or
\- maps the received message to the QFI by evaluating the QoS rules for
downlink only or bidirectional packet filter(s) if no QFI is included in the
header of the received message;
In order to determine the QFI the counted DL packet is associated with, the
UE:
\- learns the QFI from the header of the received DL packet (e.g. in the SDAP
header as specified in 3GPP TS 37.324 [15]); or
\- maps the DL packet to the QFI by evaluating the QoS rules for downlink only
or bidirectional packet filter(s) if no QFI is included in the header of the
received DL packet.
5-7. The UPF sends a PMFP PLR report request message to request the UE to
report the number of the counted DL packets. If the UPF intends to request the
UE to restart counting the DL packets, the UPF can include an indication in
the PMFP PLR report request message and restart counting the transmitted DL
packets over the QoS flow.
8-10. Upon receiving the PMFP PLR report request message, the UE stops
counting the DL packets and sends PMFP PLR report response message which
includes the number of the DL packets counted since the reception of the last
PMFP PLR count request message. If an indication to request restart of
counting procedure is received in the PMFP PLR report request message and
accepted by the UE, the UE restarts counting the received DL packets.
11\. The UPF calculates the DL packet loss rate based on the local counting
result of the number of transmitted DL packets and the reported number of
received DL packets included in the PMFP PLR report response message. If the
UPF includes an indication to request restart of counting in the PMFP PLR
report request message in step 5 and the UPF receives PMFP PLR report response
message with an indication of restart counting is not accepted or without an
indication of restart counting, the UPF shall abort the restart of PMFP PLR
measurement procedure.
12\. Same as step 5, if the UPF restarts counting the transmitted DL packets
as specified in step 7.
13\. Same as step 6, if the UPF restarts counting the transmitted DL packets
as specified in step 7.
14\. Same as step 7.
15\. Same as step 8, if the UE restarts counting the received DL packets as
specified in step 9.
16\. Same as step 9.
17\. Same as step 10, if the UE restarts counting the received DL packets as
specified in step 9.
18\. Same as step 11, if the UPF restarts counting the transmitted DL packets
as specified in step 7.
NOTE 2: When the UPF requests and the UE accepts the restart of counting,
there can be multiple occurrences of step 7, 9, and 12-18.

session via which the PMFP PLR COUNT REQUEST message was received; and
\- set the counted received DL packets, if any, to zero, and start counting
the received DL packets over the QoS flow on the same access which the PMFP
PLR COUNT REQUEST message is received.
Upon receiving PMFP PLR COUNT RESPONSE message with the same EPTI as the
allocated EPTI value of the sent PMFP PLR COUNT REQUEST message, the UPF shall
stop the timer T203 and consider that the counting has started.
##### 5.4.7.2.3 Abnormal cases in the UPF
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Expiration of the timer T203
Upon expiration of the timer T203, the UPF shall abort the procedure.
#### 5.4.7.3 Network-initiated PLR report procedure
##### 5.4.7.3.1 Network-initiated PLR report procedure initiation
In order to initiate a network-initiated PLR report procedure over an access
of an MA PDU session, the UPF shall
\- allocate an EPTI value as specified in clause 5.4.2.2;
\- create a PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message;
\- set the EPTI IE of the PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message to the allocated
EPTI value; and
\- include the Additional measurement indication IE with \"RC\" bit set if the
UPF intends to request the UE to restart counting the DL packets.
Upon sending the PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message the UPF shall:
\- start a timer T204;
\- stop counting the DL packets; and
\- restart counting the transmitted DL packets if the Additional measurement
indication IE with \"RC\" bit set is included in the PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST
message.
An example of the network-initiated PLR report procedure is shown in figure
5.4.7.3.1-1.
Figure 5.4.7.3.1-1: Network-initiated PLR report procedure
##### 5.4.7.3.2 Network-initiated PLR report procedure completion
Upon receiving the PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message, the UE shall:
\- create a PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message;
\- set the EPTI IE of the PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message to the EPTI value
of the received PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message;
\- stop counting the received DL packets and set the Counting result IE to the
number of counted received DL packets since the reception of the last PMFP PLR
COUNT REQUEST message over the QoS flow; and
\- include the Additional measurement indication IE with \"RC\" bit set if
accepting the request from the UPF to restart counting the DL packets.
The UE shall send the PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message over the QoS flow on
the same access which the PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message was received. Upon
sending the PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message, the UE restarts counting the
received DL packets over the QoS flow on the same access which the PMFP PLR
REPORT REQUEST message is received if accepting the request from the UPF to
restart counting the DL packets.
Upon receiving the PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message with the same EPTI as the
allocated EPTI value of the sent PMFP PLR REPORT REQUEST message, the UPF
shall:
\- stop the timer T204; and
\- calculate the DL PLR over the QoS flow based on the number of the DL
packets counted locally and the number indicated in Counting result IE in the
received PMFP PLR REPORT RESPONSE message.
##### 5.4.7.3.3 Abnormal cases in the UPF
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Expiration of the timer T204
Upon expiration of the timer T204, the UE shall abort the network-initiated
PLR measurement procedure.
### 5.4.8 UE assistance data provisioning procedure
#### 5.4.8.1 General
The purpose of the UE assistance data provisioning procedure is to enable the
UE to provide to the UPF a DL traffic distribution that can be applied by the
UPF for all DL traffic that applies to the UE assistance operation.
If the UE has received the LBPAO set to \"UE assistance operation is allowed\"
in an ATSSS rule and decides to apply for an SDF a UL traffic distribution
different from the default UL traffic distribution indicated in the load
balancing steering mode of the ATSSS rule, the UE sends a PMFP UAD
provisioning message to the UPF.
NOTE 1: It is based on UE implementation that how the UE decides to apply a
different UL traffic distribution for an SDF and how the corresponding DL
traffic distribution is decided.
NOTE 2: Once the UE assistance data provisioning procedure is successfully
completed, if the UE receives updated ATSSS rules in which the value of the
load balancing percentages adjustment operation filed is changed from \"UE
assistance operation is allowed\" to other values, the UE needs to turn to
apply immediately the UL traffic distribution for the SDF indicated in the
updated ATSSS rules.
#### 5.4.8.2 UE assistance data provisioning procedure initiation
In order to initiate a UE assistance data provisioning procedure over an
access of an MA PDU session, the UE shall:
a) allocate an EPTI value as specified in clause 5.4.2.2;
b) create a PMF UAD PROVISIONING message;
c) set the EPTI IE of the PMFP UAD PROVISIONING message to the allocated EPTI
value; and
d) include the DL distribution information IE with a DL traffic distribution
that can be applied by the UPF for all DL traffic that applies to the UE-
assistance operation.
Upon sending the PMFP UAD PROVISIONING message the UE shall start a timer
T106.
The UE in the PMFP UAD provisioning message includes DL distribution
information.
Figure 5.4.8.2-1: UE assistance data provisioning procedure
#### 5.4.8.3 UE assistance data received by the network
On receipt of a PMFP UAD PROVISIONING message, the UPF may use the information
in the received PMFP UAD PROVISIONING message to align the DL traffic
distribution for all DL traffic that applies to the UE-assistance operation.
Furthermore, the UPF shall create a PMFP UAD PROVISIONING COMPLETE message. In
the PMFP UAD PROVISIONING COMPLETE message, the UPF shall set the EPTI IE to
the EPTI value in the PMFP UAD PROVISIONING message. The UPF shall send the
PMFP UAD PROVISIONING COMPLETE message over the access of the MA PDU session
via which the PMFP UAD PROVISIONING message was received.
#### 5.4.8.4 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Expiry of the timer T106
The UE shall, on the first expiry of the timer T106, retransmit the PMFP UAD
PROVISIONING message and shall reset and start timer T106. This retransmission
is repeated up to four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T106, the UE
shall abort the procedure.
### 5.4.9 UE assistance data termination procedure
#### 5.4.9.1 General
The purpose of the UE assistance data termination procedure is to enable the
UE to inform the UPF that the UE assistance data operation is terminated and
the UE performs UL traffic distribution according to load balancing
percentages of the ATSSS rule received from the network.
If the UE decides to terminate the UE assistance data operation and instead
use the split percentages for respective SDF traffic transmitted over 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access as indicated in the load balancing steering mode of
the ATSSS rules, the UE sends a PMFP UAT command message to the UPF.
NOTE: It is based on UE implementation how the UE decides to terminate
applying UL traffic distribution different from the percentages indicated in
the load balancing steering mode of the ATSSS rules.
#### 5.4.9.2 UE assistance data termination procedure initiation
In order to initiate a UE assistance data termination procedure over an access
of an MA PDU session, the UE shall:
a) allocate an EPTI value as specified in clause 5.4.2.2;
b) create a PMF UAT COMMAND message; and
c) set the EPTI IE of the PMFP UAT COMMAND message to the allocated EPTI
value.
Upon sending the PMFP UAT COMMAND message the UE shall start a timer T105.
Figure 5.4.9.1-1: UE assistance data termination procedure
#### 5.4.9.3 UE assistance data termination received by the network
On receipt of a PMFP UAT command message, the UPF shall remove the DL steering
information, if created for a previous UE assistance data operation, and shall
perform DL traffic distribution according to the load balancing percentages
without UE assistance operation. Furthermore, the UPF shall create a PMFP UAT
COMPLETE message . In the PMFP UAT COMPLETE message, the UPF shall set the
EPTI IE to the EPTI value in the PMFP UAT COMMAND message. The UPF shall send
the PMFP UAT COMPLETE message over the access of the MA PDU session via which
the PMFP UAT COMMAND message was received.
Upon reception of a PMFP UAT COMPLETE message with the same EPTI as the
allocated EPTI value, the UE shall stop the timer T105.
#### 5.4.9.4 Abnormal cases in the UE
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Expiry of the timer T105
The UE shall, on the first expiry of the timer T105, retransmit the PMFP UAT
COMMAND message and shall reset and start timer T105. This retransmission is
repeated up to four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T105, the UE
shall abort the procedure.
### 5.4.10 Traffic duplication suspend procedure
#### 5.4.10.1 General
The purpose of the traffic duplication suspend procedure is to enable the UPF
to suspend traffic duplication of the MA PDU session when the redundant
steering mode is applied.
The traffic duplication suspend procedure can be performed over any available
access of the MA PDU session.
#### 5.4.10.2 Traffic duplication suspend procedure initiation
In order to initiate a traffic duplication suspend procedure over an access of
the MA PDU session, the UPF shall allocate a EPTI value as specified in clause
5.4.2.2 and shall create a PMFP TDS REQUEST message. In the PMFP TDS REQUEST
message, the UPF:
a) shall set the EPTI IE to the allocated EPTI value; and
b) may include the traffic type IE that indicates the type of traffic where
duplication is to be suspended (\"GBR\", \"non-GBR\" or \"GBR and non-GBR\").
The UPF shall start a timer T207 and shall send the PMFP TDS REQUEST message
over any available access of the MA PDU session.
An example of the traffic duplication suspend procedure is shown in figure
5.4.10.2-1.

#### 5.4.10.3 Traffic duplication suspend procedure completion
Upon reception of the PMFP TDS REQUEST message, the UE:
a) shall stop the duplication of the traffic, if any, as per the traffic type
indicated in the traffic type IE if included. If the traffic type IE is not
included, the UE shall stop the duplication of both GBR traffic and non-GBR
traffic, if any; and
b) shall create a PMFP TDS RESPONSE message. In the PMFP TDS RESPONSE message,
the UE shall set the EPTI IE to the EPTI value in PMFP TDS REQUEST message.
The UE shall send the PMFP TDS RESPONSE message over the access of the MA PDU
session via which the PMFP TDS REQUEST message was received.
Upon reception of a PMFP TDS RESPONSE message with the same EPTI as the
allocated EPTI value, the UPF shall stop the timer T207.
#### 5.4.10.4 Abnormal cases in the network
The following abnormal cases can be identified:
a) Expiration of the timer T207
The UPF shall, on the first expiry of the timer T207, retransmit the PMFP TDS
REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer T207. This retransmission is
repeated up to four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T207, the UPF
shall abort the procedure.
### 5.4.11 Traffic duplication resume procedure
#### 5.4.11.1 General
The purpose of the traffic duplication resume procedure is to enable the UPF
to resume traffic duplication of the MA PDU session when the redundant
steering mode is applied.
The traffic duplication resume procedure can be performed over any available
access of the MA PDU session.
#### 5.4.11.2 Traffic duplication resume procedure initiation
In order to initiate a traffic duplication resume procedure over an access of
the MA PDU session, the UPF shall allocate a EPTI value as specified in clause
5.4.2.2 and shall create a PMFP TDR REQUEST message. In the PMFP TDR REQUEST
message, the UPF:
a) shall set the EPTI IE to the allocated EPTI value; and
b) may include the traffic type IE that indicates the type of traffic where
duplication is to be resumed (\"GBR\", \"non-GBR\" or \"GBR and non-GBR\").

### 6.1.3 ATSSS rules
#### 6.1.3.1 Definition of ATSSS rules
The ATSSS rules are defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and is set of one or more
ATSSS rules, where a rule is composed of:
a) an ATSSS rule ID identifying the individual ATSSS rule;
b) an ATSSS rule operation identifying whether the ATSSS rule is added to or
deleted from the set of ATSSS rules;
c) a precedence value of the ATSSS rule identifying the precedence of the
ATSSS rule;
d) a traffic descriptor matching a service data flow (SDF); and
e) an access selection descriptor including:
1) a steering functionality set to:
A) MPTCP functionality, the UE steers the SDF by using the MPTCP
functionality;
B) MPQUIC functionality, the UE steers the SDF by using the MPQUIC
functionality;
C) ATSSS-LL functionality, the UE steers the SDF by using the ATSSS-LL
functionality;or
D) UE\'s supported steering functionality;
where the UE, supporting multiple steering functionalities, shall use a
steering functionlity by using the ATSSS rules (see 3GPP TS 23.503 [3A]) to
apply for a specific packet flow;
NOTE 0: The steering functionality can only be set to \"UE\'s supported
steering functionality\" if the UE indicated that the UE supports only \"ATSSS
Low-Layer functionality with any steering mode\".
NOTE 1: If the included steering functionality is not supported by the UE, the
UE ignores this ATSSS rule, and proceeds with the evaluation of the ATSSS rule
with the next smallest precedence, if available.
2) a steering mode:
A) active-standby, the UE steers the SDF by using the active access if the
active access is available. If the active access is not available and the
standby access is available, the UE steers the SDF by using the standby
access;
B) smallest delay, the UE steers the SDF by using the access network with the
smallest RTT. If there is only one access available, the UE steers the SDF by
using the available access. This steering mode is only applicable to non-GBR
SDF;
C) load balancing, the UE steers the SDF across both the 3GPP access and the
non-3GPP access with a given precentage if both accesses are available. If
there is only one access available, the UE steers the SDF by using the
available access. This steering mode is only applicable to non-GBR SDF;
D) priority based, the UE steers the SDF over the access with high priority
unless the access with high priority is congested or unavailable, when the UE
steers the SDF over both the access with high priority and the access with low
priority. This steering mode is only applicable to non-GBR SDF;or
E) redundant, the UE duplicates the traffic of an SDF on both the 3GPP access
and the non-3GPP access according to the following rules when there is no
threshold values provided in the the access selection descriptor:
\- if both accesses are available and the steering mode information field in
the access selection descriptor is set to \"Primary access is not provided\",
the UE shall duplicate all the traffic of the SDF on both accesses;
\- if both accesses are available and the steering mode information field in
the access selection descriptor is set to \"Primary access is 3GPP\" or set to
\"Primary access is non-3GPP\", the UE shall send all the traffic of an SDF on
the indicated primary access (3GPP access or non-GPP access) and may dublicate
the traffic on the other access, where how many and which data packets are
duplicated by UE on the other access are implementation dependent; or
\- If there is only one access available, the UE shall send the traffic of the
SDF on the available access.
The redundant steering mode is applicable to both GBR SDF and non-GBR SDF when
there is no threshold value provided in the access selection descriptor. If
threshold value is provided in the access selection descriptor, the redundant
steering mode is applicable to only non-GBR SDF. If the steering functionality
is set to ATSSS-LL functionality, the steering mode shall not be set to
redundant.
3) a steering mode additional indicator:
A) load balancing percentages adjustment operation (LBPAO):
\- autonomous load-balance operation, this operation is only applicable to
load balancing steering mode. With this operation, the UE may ignore the
information provided in the steering mode information (i.e. percentages of the
SDF traffic transmitted over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access), and that the UE
may autonomously determine its own percentages for traffic splitting, in a way
that maximizes the aggregated bandwidth in the uplink direction. The UPF may
apply a similar behaviour in the downlink direction; or
\- UE assistance operation, this operation is only applicable to load
balancing steering mode. With this operation, the UE may decide how to
distribute the UL traffic of the matching SDF based on the UE\'s internal
state (e.g. when the UE is in the special internal state such as lower battery
level) and inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic of the
matching SDF by performing UE assistance data provisioning procedure as
specified in clause 5.4.8;
NOTE 2: The UE is expected to determine its own percentages for traffic
splitting by performing measurements across both the 3GPP access and the
non-3GPP access.
4) threshold values include one maximum RTT value or one maximum packet loss
rate value or both. The threshold values are only used when the steering mode
is indicated as load balancing, priority based; or redundant, where in the
redundant steering mode, only either maximum RTT value or maximum packet loss
rate value may be provided and not both; and
NOTE 3: The threshold values and the LBPAO set with either \"autonomous load-
balancing operation is allowed\" or \"UE assistance operation is allowed\" in
the steering mode additional indicator cannot exist at the same time in an
ATSSS rule.
NOTE 4: The threshold values and the steering mode indicator cannot be
provided together in an access selection descriptor.
5) a transport mode to identify the transport mode for the matching traffic
when the steering functionality is MPQUIC functionality.
NOTE 5: If the steering functionality is not MPQUIC functionality, the
transport mode is not provided.
The UE and the UPF use the provided threshold values on both 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access as follows:
A) for the load balancing steering mode,
i) if the maximum RTT value or the maximum packet loss rate value of the MA
PDU session in an access exceeds the indicated value, the UE and the UPF
reduce the amount of traffic sent over that access and they send traffic over
the other access; and
ii) if both the maximum RTT value and the maximum packet loss rate value of
the MA PDU session for both accesses do not exceed the provided threshold
values, the UE and the UPF steer the SDF traffic across both the 3GPP access
and non-3GPP access as indicated by the steering information of the ATSSS
rule;
B) for the priority based steering mode, the UE and the UPF use the maximum
RTT value or the maximum packet loss rate value or both to detect when an
access of an MA PDU session is congested. If the maximum RTT value or the
maximum packet loss rate value in an access of the MA PDU session exceeds the
indicated value, the UE and the UPF may send some traffic over the other
access, i.e. the UE splits the SDF traffic over both the access with high
priority and the access with low priority; and.
C) for the redundant steering mode,
i) if the maximum packet loss rate value is indicated and:
\- the maximum packet loss rate value of the MA PDU session on both accesses
exceeds the indicated value, the UE and UPF shall duplicate the traffic of the
SDF on both accesses;
\- the maximum packet loss rate value of the MA PDU session on only one access
exceeds the indicated value, the UE and UPF shall send the traffic of the SDF
on the other access; or
\- the maximum packet loss rate value of the MA PDU session on any access does
not exceed the indicated value, the UE and UPF shall send the traffic of the
SDF only over the primary access indicated in the steering mode information
field, if any. If the steering mode information field is set to \"Primary
access is not provided\", the UE and UPF select a primary access based on
their implementation (e.g., the access with the lowest packet loss rate); or
ii) if the maximum RTT value is indicated and:
\- the maximum RTT value of the MA PDU session on both accesses exceeds the
indicated value, the UE and UPF may duplicate the traffic of the SDF on both
accesses based on their implementation;
\- the maximum RTT value of the MA PDU session on only one access exceeds the
indicated value, the UE and UPF shall send the traffic of the SDF on the other
access; or
\- the maximum RTT value of the MA PDU session on any access does not exceed
the indicated value, the UE and UPF shall send the traffic of the SDF only
over the primary access indicated in the steering mode information field, if
any. If the steering mode information field is set to \"Primary access is not
provided\", the UE and UPF select a primary access based on their
implementation (e.g., the access with the lowest RTT).
NOTE 6: If measurement results on an access are not available for a parameter,
it is considered that the measured parameter for this access has not exceeded
the provided threshold value.

ATSSS rule ID (octet 6) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
The ATSSS rule ID specifies the identity of the individual ATSSS rule on which the ATSSS rule operation in octet 7 is applied. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
ATSSS rule operation (octet 7) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
The ATSSS rule operation is encoded as follows: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

If "Add or replace ATSSS rule" is indicated, the ATSSS rule with identity as indicated in ATSSS rule ID and contents as indicated in the following octets of the ATSSS rule parameter is added to the set of ATSSS rules. If an ATSSS rule with the same ATSSS rule ID does not exist in the set of ATSSS rules, a new rule is created and added. If an ATSSS rule with the same ATSSS rule ID exists in the set of ATSSS rules, the old rule is replaced with the new ATSSS rule. If "Delete ATSSS rule" is indicated, the ATSSS rule with identity as indicated in the ATSSS rule ID parameter is deleted from the set of ATSSS set of rules and octets a+5 and onwards of the ATSSS rule parameter are ignored. If no ATSSS rule with identity as indicated in the ATSSS rule ID parameter exists in the set of ATSSS rules, the Delete ATSSS rule operation is successful without changes to the set of ATSSS rules. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

MPQUIC protocol is built on top of UDP/IP and to implement the MPQUIC
functionality:
a) the UE and the UPF shall support QUIC layer supporting QUIC protocol as
defined IETF RFC 9000 [9A], IETF RFC 9001[9B], IETF RFC RFC 9002 [9C] and the
extensions defined in:
1) IETF RFC RFC 9221 [9.4] for supporting unreliable datagram transport with
QUIC; and
2) draft-ietf-quic-multipath [9I] for supporting QUIC connections using
multiple paths simultaneously; and
b) the UE shall implement the HTTP/3 client and the UPF shall implement HTTP/3
proxy of the HTTP/3 layer, where the HTTP/3 layer support the HTTP/3 protocol
defined in IETF RFC 9114 [9F] and the following extensions defined in:
1) IETF RFC 9298 [9E] for supporting UDP proxying over HTTP;
2) IETF RFC 9297 [9G] for supporting HTTP datagrams; and
3) IETF RFC 9220 [9H] for supporting Extended CONNECT.
After the QUIC connection is established, the UE sends all uplink traffic of
the QUIC connection to the QoS flow associated with the QUIC connection. This
enables the network to determine the QoS flow associated with the QUIC
connection for selecting a QUIC connection for downlink traffic of the QoS
flow.
NOTE: How the UE ensures that all uplink traffic of the QUIC connection is
sent to the QoS flow associated with the QUIC connection, is an implementation
issue. Upon establishment of the QUIC connection, methods such as liveness
testing as defined in IETF RFC 9000 [9A], can be used over the QoS flow of the
QUIC connection.

non-3GPP access network for access performance measurements over the QoS flow
of the default QoS rule, and optionally a QoS flow list according to figure
6.1.5.2-3 and figure 6.1.5.2-4 with the allocated port numbers to perform

# 8 Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous PMFP data
## 8.1 General
The procedures specified in the clause apply to those messages which pass the
checks described in this clause.
This clause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown, unforeseen,
and erroneous PMFP data by the receiving entity. These procedures are called
\"error handling procedures\", but in addition to providing recovery
mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility mechanism for
future extensions of the PMFP.
Clauses 8.1 to 8.8 shall be applied in order of precedence.
Detailed error handling procedures in the network are implementation dependent
and may vary from PLMN to PLMN. However, when extensions of PMFP are
developed, networks are assumed to have the error handling which is indicated
in this clause as mandatory (\"shall\") and that is indicated as strongly
recommended (\"should\").
Also, the error handling of the network is only considered as mandatory or
strongly recommended when certain thresholds for errors are not reached during
a dedicated connection.
For definition of semantical and syntactical errors see 3GPP TS 24.007 [13],
clause 11.4.2.
## 8.2 Message too short or too long
### 8.2.1 Message too short
When a message is received that is too short to contain a complete message
type information element, that message shall be ignored, c.f. 3GPP TS 24.007
[13].
### 8.2.2 Message too long
The maximum size of a PMFP message is 65535 octets.
## 8.3 Unknown or unforeseen extended procedure transaction identity (EPTI)
### 8.3.1 Extended procedure transaction identity (EPTI)
The following network procedures shall apply for handling an unknown,
erroneous, or unforeseen EPTI received in a PMFP message:
a) In case the network receives a PMFP ECHO RESPONSE message in which the EPTI
value does not match any EPTI in use, the network shall ignore the PMFP
message.
The following UE procedures shall apply for handling an unknown, erroneous, or
unforeseen EPTI received in a PMFP message:
a) In case the UE receives a PMFP ECHO RESPONSE message, a PMFP UAD
PROVISIONING COMPLETE message, a PMFP UAT COMPLETE message or a PMFP
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message in which the EPTI value does not match any EPTI in
use, the UE shall ignore the PMFP message.
## 8.4 Unknown or unforeseen message type
If the UE or the network receives a PMFP message with message type not defined
for the PMFP or not implemented by the receiver, it shall ignore the PMFP
message.
NOTE: A message type not defined for the PMFP in the given direction is
regarded by the receiver as a message type not defined for the PMFP, see 3GPP
TS 24.007 [13].
If the UE receives a message not compatible with the PMFP state, the UE shall
ignore the PMFP message.
If the network receives a message not compatible with the PMFP state, the
network actions are implementation dependent.
## 8.5 Non-semantical mandatory information element errors
### 8.5.1 Common procedures
When on receipt of a message,
a) an \"imperative message part\" error; or
b) a \"missing mandatory IE\" error;
is diagnosed or when a message containing:
a) a syntactically incorrect mandatory IE;
b) an IE unknown in the message, but encoded as \"comprehension required\"
(see 3GPP TS 24.007 [13]); or
c) an out of sequence IE encoded as \"comprehension required\" (see 3GPP TS
24.007 [13]) is received;
the UE shall ignore the PMFP message and the network shall:
a) try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation
dependent); or
b) ignore the message.
## 8.6 Unknown and unforeseen IEs in the non-imperative message part
### 8.6.1 IEIs unknown in the message
The UE shall ignore all IEs unknown in a message which are not encoded as
\"comprehension required\" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [13]).
The network shall take the same approach.
### 8.6.2 Out of sequence IEs
The UE shall ignore all out of sequence IEs in a message which are not encoded
as \"comprehension required\" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [13]).
The network should take the same approach.
### 8.6.3 Repeated IEs
If an information element with format T, TV, TLV, or TLV-E is repeated in a
message in which repetition of the information element is not specified in
clause 6.2.1, the UE shall handle only the contents of the information element
appearing first and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information
element. When repetition of information elements is specified, the UE shall
handle only the contents of specified repeated information elements. If the
limit on repetition of information elements is exceeded, the UE shall handle
the contents of information elements appearing first up to the limit of
repetitions and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information
element.
The network should follow the same procedures.
## 8.7 Non-imperative message part errors
### 8.7.1 General
This category includes:
a) syntactically incorrect optional IEs; and
b) conditional IE errors.
### 8.7.2 Syntactically incorrect optional IEs
The UE shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in a
message as not present in the message.
The network shall take the same approach.
### 8.7.3 Conditional IE errors
NOTE: In this release of specification, there are no conditional IEs.
When upon receipt of a PMFP message the UE diagnoses a \"missing conditional
IE\" error or an \"unexpected conditional IE\" error, or when it receives a
PMFP message containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE,
the UE shall ignore the message.
When the network receives a message and diagnoses a \"missing conditional IE\"
error or an \"unexpected conditional IE\" error or when it receives a message
containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE, the network
shall either:
a) try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation
dependent); or
b) ignore the message.
## 8.8 Messages with semantically incorrect contents
When a message with semantically incorrect contents is received, the UE shall
perform the foreseen reactions of the procedural part of clause 5.4. If,
however no such reactions are specified, the UE shall ignore the message.
The network should follow the same procedure.

# A.1 IEEE registration templates
## A.1.1 IEEE registration templates for ethertype values
### A.1.1.1 IEEE registration templates for ethertype value for 3GPP IEEE MAC
based protocol family
Editor\'s note: MCC is requested to apply in IEEE-RA for allocation of an
ethertype value according to this template.
Registration URL:
http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/ethertype/index.html
Registry:
ethertype
Detailed description:
This application requests allocation of an ethertype value for 3GPP IEEE MAC
based protocol family, as specified in IEEE 802 [11].
Protocol description:
The MAC client data field of a MAC frame as specified in IEEE 802.3 [12] of
the 3GPP IEEE MAC based protocol family is formatted as follows:
\- octet 1 of the MAC client data field is the protocol subtype field.
\- remaining octets of the MAC client data field are the protocol data field.
The protocol subtype field set to one identifies the performance measurement
function protocol specified in 3GPP TS 24.193.
3GPP TS 24.193 enables assignment of further protocols to values of the
protocol subtype field.
Assignment quantity:
1
Additional comments:
1) Does the company requesting the assignment have any existing Ethertype
assignments?
Yes.
1a) Does the existing use of the original assignment support sub-typing?
No.
1b) Does the current applicant know who is currently responsible for
maintenance of the previously assigned Ethertype?
Yes.
1c) Has the company considered using sub-typing of the older Ethertype for the
new use under application?
Yes. Sub-typing of the older Ethertype for the new use under application is
not possible.
1d) Given the above, why is a new Ethertype needed?
See detailed description for the new use under application.
2) Has the new protocol been developed and tested in accordance with clause 9
and especially clause 9.2.3 and Figure 12 of IEEE Std 802-2014 [11], IEEE
Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area Networks: Overview and Architecture?
The 3GPP IEEE MAC based protocol family has been developed as follows:
\- the first octet of the MAC client data field of a MAC frame as specified in
IEEE 802.3 [12] of the 3GPP IEEE MAC based protocol family contains the
protocol subtype field.
\- the MAC client data field of the MAC frame of the 3GPP IEEE MAC based
protocol family does not contain a protocol version field. If a protocol
identified by an existing protocol subtype field value is modified in a
backward-compatible way, there is no need to indicate a protocol version. If a
protocol identified by an existing protocol subtype field value needs to be
modified in a backward-incompatible way, a new protocol subtype field value
will be assigned to the modified protocol.
The 3GPP IEEE MAC based protocol family has not been tested.
3) Have the full provisions of Figure 12 for the \"Protocol identification
field\" in the prototype protocol been preserved in the final version of the
protocol for which the new EtherType is being requested?
The first octet of the MAC client data field of a MAC frame as specified in
IEEE 802.3 [12] of the 3GPP IEEE MAC based protocol family contains the
protocol subtype field.
The MAC client data field of the MAC frame of the 3GPP IEEE MAC based protocol
family does not contain a protocol version field. If a protocol identified by
an existing protocol subtype field value is modified in a backward-compatible
way, there is no need to indicate a protocol version. If a protocol identified
by an existing protocol subtype field value needs to be modified in a
backward-incompatible way, a new protocol subtype field value will be assigned
to the modified protocol.
This is preserved in the final version.
4) What provisions have been made for maintaining and assigning sub-types
going forward within your company? Please provide an example of the first 10
bytes/octets as an example.
3GPP TS 24.193 enables assignment of protocols to values of the protocol
subtype field. A sending entity shall not set the protocol subtype field to a
reserved value. A receiving entity shall ignore the MAC client data field, if
the protocol subtype field is set to a reserved value. 3GPP TS 24.193 so far
contains an assignment for the performance measurement function to value one
of the protocol subtype field.
For the performance measurement function protocol:
\- value of octet 1 of the MAC client data field is set to one.
\- values of octet 2 and octet 3 of the MAC client data field contain the
length of the performance measurement function protocol message.
\- value of octet 4 of the MAC client data field is set to the message type of
the performance measurement function protocol.
\- value of octet 5 and octet 6 of the MAC client data field is set to the
extended procedure transaction identity of the performance measurement
function protocol, enabling distinguishing of procedures running in parallel.
\- values of octet 7 and later octets of the MAC client data field depend on
the message type of the performance measurement function protocol.
