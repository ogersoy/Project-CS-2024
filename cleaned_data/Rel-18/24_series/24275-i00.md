# 1 Scope
The present document defines the management object (MO) for Basic
Communication Part (BCP) of IMS Multimedia Telephony (MMTEL) communication
service.
The MO for BCP of MMTEL communication service is compatible with OMA device
management protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined
using the OMA DM device description framework as described in the enabler
release definition OMA-ERELD_DM-V1_2 [2].
The MO for BCP of MMTEL communication service consists of relevant
configuration parameter that can be managed for a UE supporting the timer
RequestTimeout specified in 3GPP TS 24.173 [3].

# 4 MO for BCP of MMTEL communication service
The MO for BCP of MMTEL communication service is used to manage settings of
the UE, which supports a RequestTimeout timer. The timer RequestTimeout is
configurable as specified in 3GPP TS 24.173 [3].
The MO identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-bcp:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA DM 1.2.

Editor\'s Note: [NG_RTC, CR#0004] It is FFS whether the policy for
IMS_DC_configuration requires more parameters for finer granularity.
