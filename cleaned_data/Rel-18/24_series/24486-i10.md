# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In drafting the TS/TR, pay particular attention to the use of modal auxiliary
verbs! TRs shall not contain any normative provisions.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope

# 4 General description
The UE can contain a VAE client (VAE-C). The VAE-C communicates with the VAE
server (VAE-S) over the V1-AE interface (see 3GPP TS 23.286 [4]). Furthermore,
the VAE-C of a UE can communicate with the VAE-C of another UE over the V5-AE
interface (see 3GPP TS 23.286 [4]). Both the VAE-C and the VAE-S can act as an
HTTP client or an HTTP server (see IETF RFC 7230 [24]). The HTTP protocol
interactions are described in detail in clause 6 and 7.
The VAE layer supports UEs in the LTE-Uu communication range assigning a ProSe
Layer-2 Group ID for application layer V2X dynamic group formation (on-network
dynamic group creation procedure as defined in clause 6.10).
Additionally, the VAE layer supports UEs in assigning a ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
for application layer V2X dynamic group formation (off-network dynamic group
creation procedure as defined in clause 6.10).
By means of using the V1-AE interface:
a) V2X UE registration and de-registration towards the VAE-S can be provided
as defined by clause 6.2 and 6.3;
b) application level location tracking can be provided as defined by clause
6.4;
c) V2X message delivery can be provided as defined by clause 6.5;
d) V2X service discovery information can be provided as defined by clause 6.6;
e) V2X service continuity can be provided as defined by clause 6.7;
f) dynamic local service information for V2X service continuity can be
obtained as defined by clause 6.8;
g) network monitoring by the V2X UE can be provided as defined by clause 6.9;
h) V2X USD provisioning can be provided as defined by clause 7.2; and
i) PC5 parameters provisioning can be provided as defined by clause 7.3.
# 5 SEAL services
The VAE layer utilizes SEAL services to support V2X services. The SEAL
services are specified in 3GPP TS 24.544 [9], 3GPP TS 24.545 [10], 3GPP TS
24.546 [11], 3GPP TS 24.547 [12] and 3GPP TS 24.548 [13]. Interactions between
the VAE layer and the SEAL services are described in detail in clause 6.
