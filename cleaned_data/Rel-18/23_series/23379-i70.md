# 1 Scope
This document specifies the functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support the mission critical push to talk (MCPTT)
service. The MCPTT service utilizes the common functional architecture to
support MC services over LTE including the common services core defined in
3GPP TS 23.280 [16].Support for both MCPTT group calls and MCPTT private calls
operating in on-network and off-network modes of operation is specified.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] and
3GPP TS 22.280 [17].
The present document is applicable primarily to MCPTT voice service using
E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8].
Certain application functions of the MCPTT service such as dispatch and
administrative functions could also be supported via non-3GPP access networks
but no additional functionality is specified to support non-3GPP access.
The MCPTT service requires preferential handling compared to normal
telecommunication services e.g. in support of police or fire brigade including
the handling of prioritised MCPTT calls for emergency and imminent threats.
The MCPTT service can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.
In the present document, MCPTT calls between MCPTT users on different MCPTT
systems are considered.

# 4 Introduction
The MCPTT service supports communication between several users (i.e. group
call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the permission to
talk in an arbitrated manner. The MCPTT service also supports private calls
between two users.
The MCPTT architecture utilises the common functional architecture to support
mission critical services over LTE defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] and aspects
of the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5], the Proximity-based
Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7], the Group
Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [9] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS
23.237 [6] to enable support of the MCPTT service.
The MCPTT UE primarily obtains access to the MCPTT service via E-UTRAN, using
the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8]. Certain application
functions of MCPTT service such as dispatch and administrative functions can
be supported using either MCPTT UEs in E-UTRAN or using MCPTT UEs via non-3GPP
access networks.
NOTE: Dispatch consoles and devices used by MCPTT service administrators are
considered MCPTT UEs in the MCPTT architecture.
MCPTT UEs that use non-3GPP access can only support a subset of the
functionality specified in this specification that is supported by the
non-3GPP access network.
The MCPTT system provides the function to support interworking with LMR
systems defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [20].
# 5 Architectural requirements
## 5.1 Media routing requirements
The voice media flow for a private call shall be routed according to one of
the following two options:
a) Option 1:
1) Through the primary MCPTT system if both users in the call belong to the
same organisation; or
2) Through the primary MCPTT system of both users, if the users in the call do
not belong to the same organisation.
b) Option 2: The voice media flow may be routed locally, under the control of
the primary MCPTT system, through an entity allowing the duplication of the
media flow to the primary MCPTT system of each user.
The voice media flow for a group call shall be routed to the group home MCPTT
system.
The routing of media flow shall be end-to-end from transmitter to receiver(s),
except for the MCPTT control function.
## 5.2 Requirements for user identity management
To allow for confidentiality of user identities in various cases of business
relationship as defined in clause 6, the MCPTT application may provide public
user identities to the MCPTT UE, to be used by MCPTT UE for MCPTT services.
## 5.3 MCPTT group affiliation and MCPTT group de-affiliation
MCPTT group affiliation shall be as specified in clause 5.2.5 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [16]. In addition, the following requirements shall be fulfilled by the
MCPTT service for MCPTT users affiliated to MCPTT groups:
\- MCPTT users receive notifications for MCPTT group call setup and
invitations for their affiliated MCPTT group(s).
\- MCPTT users receive media and events from their affiliated MCPTT group(s).
## 5.4 MCPTT call requirements
### 5.4.1 General
The on-network MCPTT service shall support the use of pre-established
sessions.
### 5.4.2 Group call requirements
The MCPTT service shall support the chat group (restricted) call model for
MCPTT group call.
The MCPTT service shall support the pre-arranged group call model for MCPTT
group call.
## 5.5 GCS AS requirements for the MCPTT service
The GCS AS architecture requirements for MC services are specified in 3GPP TS
23.280 [16].
## 5.6 Group selection
The following functionalities shall be supported by the MCPTT service.
a. The MCPTT user shall select an affiliated group to initiate a new group
call or transmit media in an existing group call.
b. An authorized MCPTT user (e.g., dispatcher) may remotely force or request
to change other on-network MCPTT users\' selected MCPTT group to a particular
affiliated group.
## 5.7 Bearer management
### 5.7.1 General
The MCPTT UE shall use the APNs as defined in subclause 5.2.7.0 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [16].
### 5.7.2 EPS bearer considerations
The EPS bearer considerations specified in subclause 5.2.7.2 of 3GPP TS 23.280
[16] shall apply.
#### 5.7.2.1 Void
#### 5.7.2.2 Void
### 5.7.3 EPS unicast bearer considerations for MCPTT
For an MCPTT call session request, resources shall be requested utilising
interaction with dynamic PCC. The MCPTT system shall request resources over Rx
to a PCRF. The dedicated bearer for voice shall utilise the QCI value of 65
(as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [4]) and the bearer for MCPTT-4 reference
point messaging shall utilise the QCI value of 65 or the QCI value of 69 (as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [4]). The request of resources over Rx shall
include an application identifier for MCPTT in order for the PCRF to evaluate
the correct QCI.
The UE is required to support at minimum one UM bearer which is used for MCPTT
voice (see annex A in 3GPP TS 36.331 [12]).
Depending on operator policy:
\- the MCPTT system may be able to request modification of the priority (ARP)
of an existing bearer without the need to initiate a new dedicated GBR bearer;
or
\- the EPS bearers for MCPTT call may enable pre-emption of lower priority EPS
bearers if the maximum number of UM bearers has been reached in favour of
MCPTT initiated EPS bearer, if the EPS bearer used for MCPTT call has higher
priority level (ARP) than the UM bearer(s) used for other application(s) and
if the bearers for non MCPTT application are pre-emptable. In this case, the
EPS bearer for MCPTT call pre-empts one of the existing EPS bearers when the
maximum number of bearers is established for other applications.
NOTE 1: Operator policy takes into account regional/national requirements.
The EPS bearer for MCPTT emergency call shall have highest priority level
among MCPTT call types. The EPS bearer for MCPTT imminent peril call shall
have higher priority level than one for MCPTT call.
To ensure that the MCPTT service always has access to a dedicated bearer for
MCPTT media, a pre-established session may be setup that includes a request
for resources at the first MCPTT group affiliation.
This means that the PCC may multiplex MCPTT media streams from multiple
concurrent MCPTT calls into one EPS bearer on one shared network priority
regardless of MCPTT call priority.
NOTE 2: A single UM bearer is used to multiplex the media streams from
multiple concurrent MCPTT calls.
NOTE 3: The sharing of a single GBR bearer for voice means that different QCI
and/or ARP values are not possible for different voice media streams.
NOTE 4: Multi-talker control may require additional bearer resources if
multiple audio streams are sent to the UE when the floor is granted to
additional participants during an established MCPTT group session.
### 5.7.4 MBMS bearer management
The MBMS bearer management for MC services is specified in subclause 5.2.7.1
of 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
## 5.8 MCPTT system interconnect requirements
The architecture for interconnect between MCPTT systems is specified, allowing
the affiliation of MCPTT users from an MCPTT system with MCPTT groups defined
in another MCPTT system. When both MCPTT systems are served by different
networks, interconnect of signalling and media is achieved using the
interfaces defined for interconnect between PLMNs.
# 6 Involved business relationships

## 7.4 Functional entities description
### 7.4.1 General
Each subclause is a description of a functional entity and does not imply a
physical entity.
### 7.4.2 Application plane of MCPTT service
#### 7.4.2.1 General
Entities within the application plane of MCPTT service provide application
control, media control and distribution functions.
#### 7.4.2.2 Common services core
The description of the common services core entities are contained in common
functional architecture to support MC services in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
#### 7.4.2.3 MCPTT application service
##### 7.4.2.3.1 MCPTT client
The MCPTT client functional entity acts as the user agent for all MCPTT
application transactions. The client reports the information of where the
client is currently located.
##### 7.4.2.3.2 MCPTT server
The MCPTT server functional entity provides centralised support for MCPTT
services.
All the MCPTT clients supporting users belonging to a single group are
required to use the same MCPTT server for that group. An MCPTT client
supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have relationships with
multiple MCPTT servers.
NOTE 1: Possible requirements for handling multiple distinct media on
different MCPTT servers are not covered in this version of the document.
The MCPTT server functional entity represents a specific instantiation of the
GCS AS described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [9] to control multicast and unicast
operations for group communications.
The MCPTT server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS, HTTP client and
HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.
By assuming the role of a GCS AS, the MCPTT server functional entity is
responsible for:
\- requesting the allocation of multicast resources utilizing the media
distribution function;
\- announcing the association of multicast resources to calls to MCPTT UEs;
\- determining for each MCPTT UE involved in a given call whether to use
unicast or multicast transport;
\- announcing the assignment of multicast transport for specific calls to
MCPTT UEs; and
\- informing the media distribution function of the media streams requiring
support for a given call.
The MCPTT server shall support the controlling role and the participating
role. The MCPTT server may perform the controlling role for private calls and
group calls. The MCPTT server performing the controlling role for a private
call or group call may also perform a participating role for the same private
call or group call. For each private call and group call, there shall be only
one MCPTT server assuming the controlling role, while one or more MCPTT
servers in participating role may be involved.
The MCPTT server performing the controlling roles is responsible for:
\- call control (e.g. policy enforcement for participation in the MCPTT group
calls) towards all the MCPTT users of the group call and private call;
\- interfacing with the group management server for group policy and
affiliation status information of this MCPTT server\'s served affiliated
users;
\- enforcing functional alias priority handling;
\- managing floor control entity in a group call and private call; and
\- managing media handling entity in call i.e. conferencing, transcoding.
The MCPTT server performing the functional alias controlling role is
responsible for:
\- interfacing with the functional alias management server for functional
alias policy from the functional alias configuration;
\- functional alias activation, deactivation, take over and interrogation
support for MCPTT user.
The controlling roles for group call, private call and functional alias are
independent with each other.
The MCPTT server performing the participating roles is responsible for:
\- call control (e.g. authorization for participation in the MCPTT group
calls) to its MCPTT users for group call and private call;
\- group affiliation support for MCPTT user, including enforcement of maximum
N2 number of simultaneous group affiliations by a user;
\- enforcing functional alias priority handling;
\- relaying the call control and floor control messages between the MCPTT
client and the MCPTT server performing the controlling role; and
\- media handling in call for its MCPTT users, i.e. transcoding, recording,
lawful interception for both unicast and multicast media.
NOTE 2: The MCPTT server in the controlling role and the MCPTT server in the
participating role can belong to the same MCPTT system or to different MCPTT
systems.
For group regrouping involving multiple groups from primary and partner MCPTT
systems,
\- the group host MCPTT server of the temporary group performs the controlling
role and is responsible for the centralized floor control, and for arbitration
according to the temporary group or user policies (e.g., priority);
\- the group host MCPTT server of the constituent MCPTT group is responsible
for providing call invitations to their group members, and for filtering
between constituent group members\' floor control requests according to the
constituent group or user policies (e.g., priority); and
\- the MCPTT server responsible for the constituent MCPTT group members
performs the participating role.
##### 7.4.2.3.3 Floor participant
The floor participant functional entity is responsible for floor requests.
This functional entity is located in the UE for both on-network and off-
network operations.
##### 7.4.2.3.4 Floor control server
This functional entity provides support for centralised floor control for on-
network and distributed floor control for off-network operation. It may
provide arbitration between floor control requests between different users,
grant the floor in response to successful requests, and provide queuing in
cases of contention. For on-network operation, this functional entity is
located with the MCPTT server. For off-network operation, this functional
entity is located in the UE.
##### 7.4.2.3.5 Media distribution function
The media distribution function is responsible for the distribution of media
to call participants. By means of information provided by the MCPTT server
(e.g. IP addresses, transport layer ports), it will provide the following
functionality:
\- provide for the reception of uplink MCPTT UE media transmission by means of
the MCPTT-7 reference point;
\- replicate the media as needed for distribution to those participants using
unicast transport;
\- distribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs by IP unicast transmission to those
participants utilizing unicast transport by means of the MCPTT-7 reference
point;
\- distribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs using multicast downlink transport
of media for the call by means of the MCPTT-8 reference point; and
\- provide a media mixing function where multiple media streams are combined
(e.g. multi-talker control) into a single media stream for transmission to the
MCPTT UE.
NOTE 1: If media mixing function occurs within the media distribution
function, it operates independently of the media mixer in the UE.
NOTE 2: A media mixing function within the media distribution function is not
possible where the media is end to end encrypted.
Group configuration data determines whether audio mixing for multi-talker
control is applied by the media mixing function in the MCPTT server.
NOTE 3: If media mixing in the network is utilized, care should be taken to
minimize the feedback of the user\'s own voice from the mixed audio in order
to avoid echoes.
##### 7.4.2.3.6 Media mixer
This functional entity exists on the UE and provides support for combining
multiple media streams (e.g. multi-talker control) into one media stream
through the enforcement of media policy information. Group configuration data
determines whether audio mixing for multi-talker control is applied by the
media mixing function in the UE.
##### 7.4.2.3.7 MCPTT user database
This functional entity contains information of the MCPTT user profile
associated with an MCPTT ID that is held by the MCPTT service provider at the
application plane. The MCPTT user profile is determined by the mission
critical organization, the MCPTT service provider, and potentially the MCPTT
user.
##### 7.4.2.3.8 MC gateway server
The MC gateway server provides support for MCPTT interconnection services with
a partner MCPTT system in a different trust domain whilst providing topology
hiding. It acts as a proxy for one or more MCPTT servers in the partner MCPTT
system without needing to expose the MCPTT servers in the primary MCPTT system
outside the trusted domain of the primary MCPTT system. It may be a role of
the MCPTT server described in subclause 7.4.2.3.2 of the present document.
The MC gateway server is responsible for relaying call control and floor
control signalling messages, and media between MCPTT servers within the MCPTT
system and the interconnected MCPTT system.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the gateway MC server can act as a
signalling proxy as defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].
### 7.4.3 Signalling control plane
The description of the signalling control plane is contained in the common
functional architecture to support MC services as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280
[16].
## 7.5 Reference points
### 7.5.1 General reference point principle
The protocols on any reference point that is exposed for MCPTT service
interoperability with other SIP core or other IMS entities in other systems
shall be compatible with the protocols defined for the corresponding reference
point defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3].
### 7.5.2 Application plane of MCPTT service
#### 7.5.2.1 General
The reference points for the application plane of MCPTT service are described
in the following subclauses.
#### 7.5.2.2 Reference point MCPTT-1 (between the MCPTT client and the MCPTT
server)
The MCPTT-1 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT client and the
MCPTT server, is used for MCPTT application signalling for establishing a
session in support of MCPTT. The MCPTT-1 reference point shall use the SIP-1
and SIP-2 reference points for transport and routing of SIP signalling. The
MCPTT-1 reference point may use the HTTP-1 and HTTP-2 reference points.
The TMGI is communicated between the MCPTT server and the MCPTT client using
the MCPTT-1 reference point.
Information that is reported to the MCPTT server from the MCPTT client shall
be configurable at the application layer. This interface may include the area
where a UE is currently located, described as ECGI of the serving and
neighbouring cell(s), MBMS SAIs, MBSFN Area ID. This information comes from
the broadcast by the local cell, e.g. from SIB1 and SIB15 (see 3GPP TS 36.331
[12]) as decoded by the UE.
NOTE: This reference point includes the GC1 reference point as described in
3GPP TS 23.468 [9]. It is assumed that the MCPTT server is performing the
function of GCS AS. While 3GPP TS 23.468 [9] does not specify GC1 it does
include high level descriptions of certain interactions on GC1, including
those relating to the availability of multicast delivery for the application
client. The MCPTT-1 reference point fulfils the requirements of the GC1
reference point for MCPTT.
Messages supported on this interface may also include the MCPTT server
providing the MCPTT client with information describing the mapping of
transport resources to specific group calls.
#### 7.5.2.3 Reference point MCPTT-2 (between the MCPTT server and the MCPTT
user database)
The MCPTT-2 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT server and the
MCPTT user database, is used by the MCPTT server to obtain information about a
specific user. The MCPTT-2 reference point utilises a diameter management
application protocol as defined in 3GPP TS 29.283 [18] and shall be intra-
network.

signalling. If a pair of MCPTT servers, or an MCPTT server and an MC gateway
server, are served by different SIP cores then the MCPTT-3 reference point
shall also use the SIP-3 reference point for transport and routing of
signalling. Floor control signalling and media are also transferred using the
MCPTT-3 reference point.
#### 7.5.2.5 Reference point MCPTT-4 (unicast between the floor control server
and the floor participant)
The MCPTT-4 reference point, which exists between the floor control server in
the MCPTT server and the floor participant in the MCPTT client, provides floor
control signalling between the floor control server in the MCPTT server and
the floor participant over a unicast bearer. The MCPTT-4 reference point uses
the SGi reference point defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3].
#### 7.5.2.6 Reference point MCPTT-5 (between the MCPTT server and the EPS)
The MCPTT-5 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT server and the
EPS, is used, subject to the conditions below, by the MCPTT server to obtain
unicast bearers with appropriate QoS from the EPS. It utilises the Rx
interface of the EPS according to 3GPP TS 23.203 [4].
MCPTT-5 is not used when the MCPTT service provider and the PLMN operator do
not have an operational agreement for QoS control to be provided directly from
the MCPTT service provider domain.
MCPTT-5 may be used when the MCPTT service provider and the PLMN operator have
an operational agreement where QoS control is provided directly from the MCPTT
service provider domain.
NOTE: Any coordination between the P-CSCF use of Rx and the MCPTT server use
of Rx (via MCPTT-5) from the MCPTT service provider domain is not specified in
this release of this specification.
#### 7.5.2.7 Reference point MCPTT-6 (between the MCPTT server and the EPS)
The MCPTT-6 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT server and the
EPS, is used to request the allocation and activation of multicast transport
resources for MCPTT application usage. The MCPTT-6 reference point uses the
MB2-C interface as defined in 3GPP TS 29.468 [10].
#### 7.5.2.8 Reference point MCPTT-7 (unicast between the media distribution
function and the media mixer)
The MCPTT-7 reference point, which exists between the media distribution
function and the media mixer, is used to exchange unicast media between the
media distribution function of the MCPTT server and the media mixer of the
MCPTT client. The MCPTT-7 reference point uses the SGi reference point defined
in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3].
#### 7.5.2.9 Reference point MCPTT-8 (multicast between the media distribution
function and the media mixer)
The MCPTT-8 reference point, which exists between the media distribution
function and the media mixer, is used by the media distribution function of
the MCPTT server to send multicast media to the media mixer of the MCPTT
client. The MCPTT-8 reference point uses the MB2-U interface defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [9].
#### 7.5.2.10 Reference point MCPTT-9 (multicast between the floor control
server and the floor participant)
The MCPTT-9 reference point, which exists between the floor control server and
the floor participant, provides floor control signalling between the floor
control server and the floor participant over a multicast bearer. The MCPTT-9
reference point uses the MB2-U interface defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [9].
#### 7.5.2.11 Reference point IWF-1 (between the MCPTT server and the
interworking function to legacy systems)
The IWF-1 reference point is specified in 3GPP TS 23.283 [20].
#### 7.5.2.12 Reference points of common services core used in the MCPTT
service

\- The MC service user profile index is the MCPTT user profile index.
## 10.2 User authentication and authorization for MCPTT service
NOTE 1: Flow 10.2-1 is a high level user authentication and authorization
flow. 3GPP TS 33.180 [19] defines the specific user authentication and
authorization architecture required by the MCPTT service in order to realize
the MCPTT user authentication and authorization requirements as defined in
3GPP TS 22.179 [2].
A procedure for user authentication is illustrated in figure 10.2-1. The user
authentication is performed based on the procedure specified in 3GPP TS
23.280[16].
Figure 10.2-1: MCPTT user authentication and registration, single domain
1\. The user authentication is performed as per the general user
authentication procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280[16].
2\. MCPTT client performs the MCPTT service authorization for the user. Step 2
utilizes the results of step 1.
NOTE 2: The MCPTT server may reject a request for service authorization by an
MCPTT user if the number of simultaneous service authorizations for that MCPTT
user would be exceeded.
## 10.3 Affiliation and de-affiliation to/from MCPTT group(s)
The MCPTT service shall support the procedures and related information flows
as specified in subclause 10.8 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] with the following
clarifications:
\- The MC service client is the MCPTT client;
\- The MC service server is the MCPTT server;
\- The MC service group is the MCPTT group;
\- The MC service ID is the MCPTT ID; and
\- The MC service group ID is the MCPTT group ID.
When an MCPTT user has affiliated to an MCPTT group then the MCPTT user can
send and receive MCPTT related media for that MCPTT group. When an MCPTT user
has de-affiliated from an MCPTT group then the MCPTT user cannot send and
receive MCPTT related media to and from that MCPTT group.
## 10.3a Activation and de-activation of/from functional alias(es)
The MCPTT service shall support the procedures and related information flows
as specified in subclause 10.13.4 and subclause 10.13.5 of 3GPP TS 23.280
[16].
\- The MC service client is the MCPTT client;

### 10.4.3 Authorized user remotely changes another MCPTT user\'s selected
MCPTT group -- mandatory mode
Procedure for an authorized user to change other MCPTT users\' selected MCPTT
group without requiring target user\'s approval is described in figure
10.4.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCPTT client 1 has already been provisioned (statically or dynamically)
with the target MCPTT user\'s information and its group information, that the
selected MCPTT group of target MCPTT user 2 is allowed to be changed;
Figure 10.4.3-1: Remotely change MCPTT group selection -- mandatory mode
1\. When an authorized user changes other MCPTT users\' selected MCPTT group,
the MCPTT client 1 sends MCPTT group selection change request to the MCPTT
server. The information (i.e. target MCPTT ID, MCPTT group ID) used to set the
requested MCPTT group as the selected MCPTT group of the target MCPTT user
shall be included.
2\. The MCPTT server shall check if the MCPTT user 1 is authorized to change
the target MCPTT user\'s selected MCPTT group. The MCPTT server shall perform
the affiliation relationship check based on the stored affiliation status.
3\. If the MCPTT user 1 is authorized to change the target MCPTT user\'s
selected MCPTT group, and if the target MCPTT user is not already affiliated
to the requested MCPTT group, the remotely change of affiliation procedures
shall be performed (see subclause 10.8 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).
4\. The MCPTT server then shall send the MCPTT group selection change
notification including the target user ID and the selected MCPTT group ID to
the MCPTT client 2.
5\. The group selection change response then returns to the MCPTT client 1.
6\. Target MCPTT client 2 are notified about the change of its selected MCPTT
group.
## 10.5 Pre-established session (on-network)
### 10.5.1 General
The MCPTT server and client may use one or more pre-established sessions as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] for the following procedures for on-network:
\- Group calls (as specified in subclause 10.6.2.3 and subclause 10.6.2.4);
\- Private calls (as specified in subclause 10.7.2.2 and subclause 10.7.2.3);
\- MCPTT emergency group calls (as specified in subclause 10.6.2.6.1);
\- MCPTT imminent peril group calls (as specified in subclause 10.6.2.6.2);
\- MCPTT emergency private calls (as specified in subclause 10.7.2.4); and
\- MCPTT emergency alerts (as specified in subclause 10.6.2.6.3).
For outgoing MCPTT call setup for a private call or a pre-arranged group call
using a pre-established session, an MCPTT UE uses SIP procedures to establish
the call.
For incoming MCPTT call setup for a pre-arranged group call using a pre-
established session, media plane control procedures are used to establish the
call between the MCPTT server and client.
For incoming MCPTT call setup for a private call using a pre-established
session, SIP procedures are used to establish the call between the MCPTT
client and server in manual commencement mode and media plane control
procedures in automatic commencement mode.
An MCPTT UE can join an MCPTT chat group using a pre-established session by
sending a group join request using SIP procedures.
NOTE: A chat group call is started and notified using floor control messages
regardless of whether pre-established session is used.

#### 10.6.2.3 Group call within one MCPTT system
##### 10.6.2.3.1 Group call models
###### 10.6.2.3.1.1 Pre-arranged group call
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.1 General {#general-11 .H6}
A pre-arranged group call is initiated by one of the affiliated group members.
The initiation of a pre-arranged group call results in all other affiliated
group members being invited. Media plane resources are reserved (on-demand) or
a pre-established session is associated during the group call setup procedure
and released (if on-demand session) or de-associated (if pre-established
session) when the call is released. SIP signalling is used to setup and
release pre-arranged group calls.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.2 Pre-arranged group call setup {#pre-arranged-group-call-
setup .H6}
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is initiating an MCPTT
group call with unicast signalling for communicating with the affiliated MCPTT
members of that group.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an MCPTT group
call with a pre-arranged group i.e., MCPTT users on client 1, client 2 and
client 3 belong to the same group which is defined in the MCPTT group
management server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A pre-arranged group is an MCPTT group that is pre-defined with MCPTT
group ID and member list in the group management server. All members of the
group belong to the same MCPTT system.
2\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 are already registered for receiving MCPTT service and affiliated.
Optionally, they may have an activated functional alias to be used during the
group communication.
3\. Optionally the MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
4\. Optionally the MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 has bound a functional alias
to the MCPTT group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup
1\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT group call with a
selected group (identified by MCPTT group ID). The MC service user may select
a functional alias.
NOTE 1: MCPTT client 1 need not be aware of the affiliation status of other
MCPTT clients to the group while initiating the group call.
NOTE 2: The selected functional alias is not changed during the group call,
i.e. a MCPTT client uses the same functional alias until the group call is
released or the MCPTT client has left the group call.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends a group call request towards the MCPTT server via the
SIP core, which hosts the group selected by the user and identified by MCPTT
group ID. The group call request also contains the MCPTT group ID and an SDP
offer containing the MCPTT client media parameters. If there is a floor
request to transmit, then the group call request contains an indication of an
implicit floor request. If the MC service user of MCPTT client 1 has selected
a functional alias, then the group call request contains that functional
alias. If the group call request contains an implicit floor request it may
also include location information.
3\. The MCPTT server checks whether the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized
to initiate a group call for the selected group. If authorized and the group
call is ongoing for that MCPTT group ID, the MCPTT server adds the requesting
MCPTT client 1 to the existing MCPTT group call and notifies the MCPTT client
1 that the MCPTT group call is already in progress. Otherwise, MCPTT server
resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that group and their
affiliation status, based on the information from the group management server.
The MCPTT server evaluates the applicable group call start criteria defined
for this group (e.g. minimum number of affiliated members, specific members
affiliated) and determines whether the group call setup can proceed.
If the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via
binding, the MCPTT server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the
functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding,
it is up to the MCPTT server implementation to determine a value for the
functional alias to be used.
If present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is
allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
If location information was included in the group call request, the MCPTT
server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location
information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call
(refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other
MCPTT users on a call when talking\").
NOTE 3: MCPTT server can have already retrieved the user/group configuration
data and locally cached. If the user/group configuration data is not locally
cached on the MCPTT server then MCPTT server requests the user/group
configuration data from the MCPTT user database/group management server.
4\. MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using MCPTT
service, offers the same media parameters or a subset of the media parameters
contained in the initial received request and sends the corresponding group
call request via the SIP core towards the MCPTT clients of each of those
affiliated group members. MCPTT users are notified about the incoming group
call and the functional alias of the group call initiating user is displayed
if present. The MCPTT server indicates whether acknowledgement is required for
the call and the functional alias of the group call initiating MC service user
may be displayed.
5\. The receiving MCPTT clients accept the group call request, and a group
call response is sent to the group host MCPTT server. This response may
contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending acknowledgement may be
based on configuration. The response may also contain a functional alias of
the responding MC service user, which is verified (valid and activated for the
user) by the MCPTT server.
6\. MCPTT server sends the group call response including the selected media
parameters to the MCPTT client 1 through the signalling path to inform about
successful call establishment. The response may contain the functional alias,
which may be displayed.
NOTE 4: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4b, and prior to step 7
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
7\. If the initiating MCPTT user requires the acknowledgement from affiliated
MCPTT group members, and the required MCPTT group members do not acknowledge
the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup
timeout\"), then the MCPTT server may proceed with or abandon the call and
then notify the initiating MCPTT user that the acknowledgements did not
include all required members according to group policy from the group
configuration. The MCPTT server may notify the initiating MCPTT user of all
MCPTT group members who did not acknowledge the group call request within the
configured time. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCPTT user by
the MCPTT server more than once during the call when MCPTT users join or leave
the MCPTT group call.
8\. MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully established media
plane for communication. MCPTT floor participant 1, floor participant 2 and
floor participant 3 exchange floor control information e.g., MCPTT client 1
receives the floor granted information over the established media plane
assuming implicit floor control request from MCPTT client 1 while at the same
time floor participants at other MCPTT client\'s receive floor taken
information. MCPTT client 1 indicates to the MCPTT user that the floor is
available to send media, while the other MCPTT clients in the group call will
be receiving that media. If audio cut-in policy is enabled for the MCPTT
group, floor arbitration follows the logic defined in subclause 10.9.1.5.
NOTE 5: The clients use the same functional alias within floor control
procedures as used during group call setup.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.3 Release pre-arranged group call {#release-pre-arranged-
group-call .H6}
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT server initiates the
termination of an ongoing MCPTT group call for all the participants of that
group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met e.g., due
to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant
leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT group
members are not present.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT server initiating termination of an ongoing MCPTT
group call.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.3-1: Release pre-arranged group call
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3
are already part of the ongoing group call (e.g., as a result of pre-arranged
group call setup).
2\. MCPTT server would like to release the MCPTT group call which is ongoing
e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT
group members are not present.
3\. MCPTT server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and
generates group call release request to release ongoing session.
4\. MCPTT server sends a group call release request via SIP core towards each
participant of the ongoing group call.
5\. MCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.
6\. MCPTT client(s) receiving group call release request, acknowledge towards
the MCPTT server by sending a group call release response.
7\. MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the floor
control and media plane resources associated with the group call that is
terminated.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.4 Late entry pre-arranged group call {#late-entry-pre-
arranged-group-call .H6}
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.4-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT server requesting a newly affiliated member or a
member coming back from out of coverage to join an ongoing MCPTT group call.
NOTE: This procedure applies to all types of group call, including, for
example, emergency call, imminent peril call and broadcast call.
Pre-condition:
1\. MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MCPTT system.
2\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n are on
an ongoing call. Optionally, the MCPTT users may use activated functional
aliases.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.4-1: Late entry pre-arranged group call
1\. MCPTT server determines that MCPTT client 1 which is newly affiliated or
coming back from out of coverage has to be invited to join an ongoing group
call (late entry).
2\. MCPTT server generates group call request including the information such
as MCPTT service identifier (possible for the SIP core to route the request to
the MCPTT server), MCPTT group ID of the group invited to join, offer one or
more media types and sends towards the MCPTT client 1 via SIP core.
3\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is notified about the incoming group call.
4\. Upon MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 accepting the incoming group call
request, MCPTT client 1 sends the group call response including the selected
media types to the MCPTT server through the signalling path. If the incoming
group call request is rejected by the MCPTT client 1, the MCPTT server should
not resend the group call request. The group call response may also contain a
functional alias of MCPTT client 1.
5\. MCPTT client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and MCPTT
users at MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client n may be notified about the MCPTT
client 1 joining the group call and the functional alias of MCPTT client 1 may
be displayed.
6\. The floor taken with the information of the current talker is sent to
MCPTT client1.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.1.5 Rejoining call {#rejoining-call .H6}
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.5-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client to rejoin an ongoing MCPTT group call (e.g.
coming back from out of coverage).
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n are on
an ongoing call. Optionally, the MCPTT users may use activated functional
aliases.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.1.5-1: Rejoin call
1\. MCPTT client 1 has necessary information for rejoining an ongoing group
call, then the MCPTT client 1 initiates group call rejoin request including
the ongoing group call information. The group call rejoin request may contain
a functional alias of MCPTT client 1 as selected by the MC service user.
2\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT client 1 can rejoin the ongoing call
(e.g. based upon affiliation status) and checks the functional alias, if
present.
3\. MCPTT client 1 is informed that the group call rejoin is successful by
sending a group call rejoin response. If the ongoing group call is emergency
or imminent peril group call, the response shall contain emergency or imminent
peril indicator.
4\. MCPTT client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and MCPTT
users at MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client n may be notified about the MCPTT
client 1 joining the group call and the functional alias of MCPTT client 1 may
be displayed.
5\. The floor taken with the information of the current talker is sent to
MCPTT client 1.
###### 10.6.2.3.1.2 Chat group call
##### 10.6.2.3.1.2.1 General {#general-12 .H6}
In a chat group (restricted) call model, the MCPTT user individually joins a
group call without being invited. The establishment of a chat group
(restricted) call does not result in other group members being invited.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCPTT client
initiating an MCPTT group call which uses the chat group (restricted) call
model. Restricted means that only users that have been configured as members
of the given group are allowed to join the group communications for the given
group.
Chat group join mechanism:
\- Each MCPTT client sends a group join request when the MCPTT user wants to
participate in the group communication for the group. (This message does not
impact the MCPTT user\'s membership in the group; the MCPTT server will verify
that the MCPTT user is an authorized member of the group.)
\- The group join request may include a request to transmit. If the group join
request includes a request to transmit it may also include location
information. It is assumed that the group join request will be delivered from
MCPTT client to MCPTT server using SIP.
\- If location information was included in the group join request, the MCPTT
server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location
information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call
(refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other
MCPTT users on a call when talking\").
\- The group join request is used to indicate to the MCPTT server that the
MCPTT user associated with the given MCPTT client wishes to participate i.e.
begin to receive media from or send media to the group.
\- The group join request shall cause the MCPTT server to generate an implicit
affiliation for the MCPTT user to the group, if the user is not already
affiliated to the group.
\- The group join request contains the information needed to negotiate media
parameters (on demand) or to associate a pre-established session between MCPTT
server and MCPTT client for the group call. The group join request can take
the form of a SIP invite.
\- A selected functional alias is not changed by a MCPTT client during the
whole participation within a chat group call, i.e. a MCPTT client uses the
same functional alias selected when joining the chat group call until the chat
group call is released or the MCPTT client leaves the chat group call.
Subsequent participation in a group call when the group is using the chat
model:
\- Once an MCPTT client successfully joins a group call which is using the
chat model, the MCPTT client connects to the media plane for the call if the
call is currently ongoing.
\- If the MCPTT group call is not currently ongoing (i.e.: when MCPTT clients
on the group call are not sending or receiving media, and the time out between
floor control exchanges has expired) then the newly joined MCPTT client will
only have pre-established its media parameters for the call.
\- If the newly joined MCPTT user wishes to transmit media (start or re-start
the call) to the other joined users of the group using the chat model, then
the MCPTT client shall use a normal floor control procedure for requesting the
floor.
\- Since subsequent group call media transmissions are controlled using floor
control signalling, additional SIP signalling messages may not be required for
subsequent call stop and start.
\- Each request to transmit from an MCPTT user could be viewed as a new
instance of a group call for the given group when the floor idle timer expires
and no media is present for an extended time.
\- The MCPTT server may tear down the media plane between successive group
calls using the chat model, or the MCPTT server may allow the media plane to
remain up between successive group calls using the chat model depending on
resources.
Leaving and releasing a chat group:
\- When a user wants to leave a chat group call, the client shall send a group
call leave request to the server and release the media plane.
\- The server can release a chat group call by sending a group call release to
all joined clients. A server initiated release also releases the media plane
for all joined clients.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.2.2 Chat group call setup {#chat-group-call-setup .H6}
MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 are served by the home MCPTT service
provider in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1.
Pre-condition:
1\. MCPTT user 2 and MCPTT user 3 have previously joined (affiliated) to the
group. MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 are registered and all users
(MCPTT user 1, user 2, and user 3) have been authenticated and authorized to
use the MCPTT service.
2\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may have activated
functional alias(es) configured to be used during the group call
communication. No call is currently in progress for the group.
3\. Optionally the MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 has bound a functional alias
to the MCPTT group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.2-1: MCPTT chat group call
1\. MCPTT user 1 indicates to join the group communication for the group. This
may include a request to transmit.
1a. MCPTT client 1 sends a group join request with the MCPTT group ID of the
desired group. It contains the MCPTT user\'s MCPTT ID, the MCPTT client media
parameters and optionally a functional alias. If there is a request to
transmit, then the group joint request contains an indication of an implicit
floor request. If the group join request includes an implicit floor request it
may also include location information.
1b. The MCPTT server receives the group join request. MCPTT server generates
an implicit affiliation (if the MCPTT user is not already affiliated to the
group) and verifies that MCPTT user 1 is authorized to affiliate to the group
by following the affiliation procedure (subclause 10.8.3 in 3GPP TS 23.280
[16]).
If the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via
binding, the MCPTT server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the
functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding,
it is up to the MCPTT server implementation to determine a value for the
functional alias to be used.
If present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is
allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
If location information was included in the group join request, the MCPTT
server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location
information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call
(refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other
MCPTT users on a call when talking\").
1c. The MCPTT server replies with a group join response indicating the
acceptance of the group join request and also returns the MCPTT server
selected media parameters for the group call in the group join response.
2\. If MCPTT user 1 requests to transmit, the MCPTT server establishes the
media plane (if not already established) for the call. The associated floor
participants for MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 use the floor control
procedure to initiate the call. E.g., the floor participant for MCPTT client 1
receives the MCPTT floor grant. The corresponding floor participants for MCPTT
client 2 and MCPTT client 3 receive the MCPTT floor taken. If present, the
functional alias of MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 are
displayed where appropriate.
3\. Floor control will continue to be used by the floor participants
associated with MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 for the
duration of the call. Media plane signalling using floor control will be used
for subsequent calls for the group as long as one or more users are
affiliated. If audio cut-in policy is enabled for the MCPTT group, floor
arbitration follows the logic defined in subclause 10.9.1.5.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.2.3 Release chat group call {#release-chat-group-call .H6}
The procedure describes the case where the MCPTT server releases an ongoing
MCPTT group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least
one of the conditions for release are met e.g. due to hang time expiry, last
participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or
the number of affiliated MCPTT group members is below the minimum number
permitted.
NOTE 1: The procedure for an MCPTT user leaving the group call is a different
procedure.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.3-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT server
initiating the release of an ongoing MCPTT group call.
The following precondition applies:
\- A group call is ongoing between MCPTT clients 1, 2 and 3
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.3-1: Release chat group call
1\. MCPTT server would like to release the MCPTT group call which is ongoing
e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT
group members are not present.
2\. MCPTT server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and
generates group call release request to release the ongoing session.
3\. MCPTT server sends a group call release request towards each participant
of the ongoing group call.
NOTE 2: The group call release request can also be sent over SIP signalling on
the signalling plane.
4\. MCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.
5\. Optionally the MCPTT client(s) receiving group call release request, may
send a group call release response to the MCPTT server.
NOTE 3: The MCPTT client can send group call release response when the group
call release request is sent using a unicast bearer.
6\. MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 release the floor control and media
plane resources associated with the group call that is released. Successful
release of the group call does not affect the status of affiliation of any of
the clients.
##### 10.6.2.3.1.2.4 Late entry chat group call, newly joined group member
{#late-entry-chat-group-call-newly-joined-group-member .H6}
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.4-1 are those for a group member entering an
ongoing MCPTT group call, i.e. performing a late entry.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT user 2 and MCPTT user 3 have previously joined to the group. MCPTT
client 1, client 2, and client 3 are registered and all users (MCPTT user 1,
user 2, and user 3) have been authenticated and authorized to use the MCPTT
service.
2\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may have activated
functional alias(es) configured to be used during the group call
communication. MCPTT users using MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 are in an
ongoing group call. MCPTT client 1 has not yet joined the group call.
Optionally, the MCPTT users may use activated functional aliases.
3\. MCPTT user 1 indicates to join the group communication for the group.
4\. Optionally the MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 has bound a functional alias
to the MCPTT group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.4-1: Late entry of a newly joined group member
1\. MCPTT client 1 sends a group join request with the MCPTT group ID of the
desired group. It contains the MCPTT user\'s MCPTT ID, the MCPTT client media
parameters and optionally a functional alias. If there is a request to
transmit, then the group joint request contains an indication of an implicit
floor request.
2\. The MCPTT server receives the group join request. MCPTT server generates
an implicit affiliation (if the MCPTT user is not already affiliated to the
group) and verifies that MCPTT user 1 is authorized to affiliate to the group.
If the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via
binding, the MCPTT server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the
functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding,
it is up to the MCPTT server implementation to determine a value for the
functional alias to be used.
If present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is
allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
3\. The MCPTT server replies with a group join response indicating the
acceptance of the group join request.
4\. Media plane between MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT server is established using
media plane control signalling.
> 5\. MCPTT users at MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may be notified about
> the MCPTT client 1 joining the group call. The functional aliases of MCPTT
> client 1 is displayed, if present.
6\. The MCPTT server sends a floor taken (for the current talker) to MCPTT
client 1.
7\. Floor control will continue to be used by the floor participants
associated with MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3.

out-of-coverage .H6}
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.5-1 are those for an MCPTT client coming
back from out of coverage during an ongoing MCPTT group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may have activated
functional alias(es) configured to be used during the group call
communication. MCPTT users using MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 are in an ongoing group call when MCPTT client1 goes out of radio
coverage.
2\. MCPTT client1 returns from out of coverage while the group call is still
ongoing.
Figure 10.6.2.3.1.2.5-1: Late entry of a MCPTT client returning from out of
coverage
1\. MCPTT client 1 or MCPTT server detects that MCPTT client 1 has returned
from out of coverage.
NOTE 1: How the MCPTT client or MCPTT server detects that the client has
returned from out of coverage is out of scope of the present document.
2\. Media plane between MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT server is re-established
using media plane control signalling.
NOTE 2: Depending on how long MCPTT client 1 was out of coverage, this step
can include signalling from MCPTT client 1 to rejoin the chat group.
3\. MCPTT server sends a floor taken (for the current talker) to MCPTT client
1.
4\. MCPTT users at MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may be notified about the
MCPTT client 1 returning to the group call. The functional aliases of MCPTT
client 1 is displayed, if present.
5\. Floor control will continue to be used by the floor participants
associated with MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3.
##### 10.6.2.3.2 Exiting group call due to de-affiliation
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT server requesting a newly de-affiliated member to leave an
ongoing MCPTT group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MCPTT system.
2\. MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client n are on an ongoing call.
3\. MCPTT client 1 has been de-affiliated from the MCPTT group.
Figure 10.6.2.3.2-1: Exiting MCPTT group call due to de-affiliation
1\. MCPTT client 1 which has been de-affiliated is instructed to leave the
ongoing group call.
2\. MCPTT server sends a group call leave request to MCPTT client 1.
3\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is notified about leaving the group call.
4\. MCPTT client 1 sends the group call leave response and leaves the group
call.
5\. MCPTT client 1 is now removed from the ongoing group call and MCPTT users
at MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n may be notified that MCPTT client 1 has
left the group call.
##### 10.6.2.3.3 MCPTT user leaving a group call
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.3.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT user leaving an ongoing MCPTT group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MC system.
2\. MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client n are on an ongoing call.

NOTE 1: MCPTT server checks if group call termination conditions are met, e.g.
hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving,
initiator leaving, minimum number of affiliated MCPTT group members are not
present. If at least one of the group call termination conditions is met, the
MCPTT server releases the group call for all participants (see subclauses
10.6.2.3.1.1.3 Release pre-arranged group call and 10.6.2.3.1.2.3 Release chat
group call).
4\. MCPTT users at MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client n may be notified that the
MCPTT user of client 1 has left the group call. The functional alias of MCPTT
client 1 is displayed, if present.
NOTE 2: The MCPTT server does not perform late entry for MCPTT users that have
left the group call.
#### 10.6.2.4 Group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems
##### 10.6.2.4.1 Group call for non-broadcast temporary groups across multiple
MCPTT systems
###### 10.6.2.4.1.1 Group call setup
##### 10.6.2.4.1.1.1 Group call setup procedure -- originating side {#group-
call-setup-procedure-originating-side .H6}
Figure 10.6.2.4.1.1.1-1 illustrates the originating side group call involving
groups from multiple MCPTT systems. It considers the scenario for group
hierarchies and non-broadcast temporary groups formed by group regroup. The
protocol followed may be SIP.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share their users\' information to the primary MCPTT system.
2\. The MCPTT user belongs to an MCPTT group hosted by the primary MCPTT
system.
3\. A non-broadcast temporary group is formed by authorized MCPTT
user/dispatcher by the group regroup procedure (subclause 10.2.4.2 in 3GPP TS
23.280 [16]) and identified via a temporary MCPTT group ID.
4\. The affiliated MCPTT group members of the constituent MCPTT groups have
been implicitly affiliated to the temporary group.
5\. The authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group on the
MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system.
6\. The constituent groups of the temporary group may belong to MCPTT servers
of the partner MCPTT systems.
Figure 10.6.2.4.1.1.1-1: Group call setup involving non-broadcast temporary
groups from multiple MCPTT systems (originating)
1\. The affiliated MCPTT user via MCPTT client initiates a group call with an
MCPTT group ID. A group call request message with the MCPTT group ID is routed
to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system, which owns the group and is
where the authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group. If the
group call is for a temporary group formed by the group regroup procedure, the
MCPTT group ID will be a temporary MCPTT group ID.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system gets the group information
(either from group management server or itself) including the constituent
MCPTT groups\' identities, accessible group members list of the constituent
groups, and other related data.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system initiates directly a call
request to the accessible group members using the detailed user information
and/or location information. The group members upon receipt of the call
request may accept or reject the call.
4\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may not have access to group
members\' information of the constituent group belonging to the partner MCPTT
system. For such group members, the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system
initiates a group call request message to the MCPTT server of the partner
MCPTT system with the target group\'s MCPTT group ID information.
5\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system further initiates a call
request to the constituent group\'s members as described in step 3.
6\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system provides a group call
response to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system with success or
failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.
7\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system provides a group call
response message to the MCPTT client of the affiliated MCPTT user upon
receiving responses to the call requests sent to members of primary and
partner MCPTT systems. The group call response message will consist of the
success or failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a
failure.
NOTE: The group call response message is triggered depending on the conditions
to proceed with the call.
8\. Upon successful call setup completion a group call is established for the
group members from constituent groups of multiple MCPTT servers.
##### 10.6.2.4.1.1.2 Group call setup procedure -- terminating side {#group-
call-setup-procedure-terminating-side .H6}
The procedure in figure 10.6.2.4.1.1.2-1 illustrates the terminating side
group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems. It considers the
scenario for group hierarchies and non-broadcast temporary groups formed by
group regroup. The protocol followed may be SIP.
Figure 10.6.2.4.1.1.2-1: Non-broadcast group call involving groups from
multiple MCPTT systems (terminating)
1\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system sends the group call request
message to the MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT system.
2\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system determines whether to forward
the group call request message to the MCPTT client(s) based on the user
affiliation.
3\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system forwards the group call
request message to MCPTT client(s). The MCPTT server indicates whether
acknowledgement is required for the call.
4\. The MCPTT user is notified about the incoming MCPTT group call.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client(s) accept the group call request and a group
call response message is sent to the MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system.
This response may contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending
acknowledgement may be based on configuration.
6\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system forwards the group call
response message to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system (i.e. group
hosting MCPTT server for the group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT
systems).
###### 10.6.2.4.1.2 Group call release
The procedure focuses on the case where the group host MCPTT server releases
an ongoing MCPTT group call for all the participants of that group call
involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems, since at least one of the
release conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant
leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number
of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.
NOTE: The scenario of MCPTT user leaving the group call is not considered in
this procedure.
Figure 10.6.2.4.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the MCPTT server releasing
an ongoing MCPTT group call involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system is controlling the group call
involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 belongs to group of the MCPTT server of the primary
MCPTT system and the MCPTT client 2 and client 3 belong to the groups of the
MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system.
3\. The MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already part
of the ongoing group call (e.g., as a result of group call setup involving
groups from multiple MCPTT systems).
Figure 10.6.2.4.1.2-1: Group call release involving groups from multiple MCPTT
systems
1\. The MCPTT server of primary MCPTT system would like to release the MCPTT
group call which is ongoing e.g., due to hang timer expiry, last participant
leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number
of affiliated MCPTT group members are not present.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system identifies the participants
of the ongoing group call and generates group call release message to release
ongoing session.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system initiates a group call
release request message via SIP core towards each accessible participant of
the ongoing group call (3a). The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may
not have access to group members\' information of the constituent group
belonging to a partner MCPTT system. For such group members, the MCPTT server
of the primary MCPTT system initiates a group call release request message
(3b) to the MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT system(s) with the target
group\'s MCPTT group ID information. The MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT
system(s) further initiate group call release request messages (3c-1, 3c-2) to
its group\'s users.
4\. The MCPTT users are notified about the release of the group call.
5\. The MCPTT client(s) receiving the group call release request messages
provide group call release response to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT
system. The MCPTT client(s) of the MCPTT users belonging to partner MCPTT
system(s) route their responses via the MCPTT server(s) of the partner MCPTT
system(s).
6\. The MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the
floor control and media plane resources associated with the group call that is
released.
##### 10.6.2.4.2 Group call for non-broadcast temporary group formed by group
regroup procedure involving multiple MCPTT systems via trusted mode
Figure 10.6.2.4.2-1 illustrates a group call involving a non-broadcast
temporary group formed by group regroup from multiple MCPTT systems. The
protocol followed may be SIP.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system shares their
users\' information to the primary MCPTT system.
2\. The MCPTT user belongs to an MCPTT group hosted by the primary MCPTT
system.
3\. A non-broadcast temporary group is formed by authorized MCPTT
user/dispatcher by the group regroup procedure (subclause 10.2.4.2 in 3GPP TS
23.280 [16]) and identified via a temporary MCPTT group ID.
4\. The MCPTT group members of the constituent MCPTT groups belonging to the
temporary group are affiliated to participate in a group call for the
temporary group.
5\. The authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group on the
MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system.
6\. The constituent groups of the temporary group may belong to MCPTT servers
of the partner MCPTT systems.
Figure 10.6.2.4.2-1: Group call involving non-broadcast temporary group formed
by group regroup from multiple MCPTT systems
1\. The affiliated MCPTT user via MCPTT client initiates a group call with an
MCPTT group ID. A group call request message with the MCPTT group ID is routed
to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system, which owns the temporary
group formed by group regroup procedure, and is also where the authorized
MCPTT user/dispatcher has created the temporary group. The MCPTT group ID will
be a temporary MCPTT group ID.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system gets the group information
(either from group management server or itself) including the constituent
MCPTT groups\' identities, and other related data.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may interrogate the MCPTT
server of the partner MCPTT system for the affiliated group 2 members.
4\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system responds with a list of the
affiliated group members of group 2.
NOTE 1: Steps 3 and 4 do not occur if the constituent groups\' information is
available and up to date at primary MCPTT system due to the procedure for
temporary group formation as defined in subclause 10.2.4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280
[16].
5\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system verifies the commencement
policies of the temporary group, and initiates a call invitation or call
notification to the affiliated members of groups 1 and 2.
6\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system provides group call response
message to the MCPTT UE of authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher upon receiving
responses to the call invitations sent to members of primary and partner MCPTT
systems. The group call response will consist of the success or failure result
and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.
7\. Upon successful call setup completion, a group call is established for the
group members belonging to constituent groups of multiple MCPTT systems.
NOTE 2: MCPTT clients are generally aware that their (constituent) groups have
been regrouped (e.g., see subclause 10.1.5.3 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]); however,
if not, the partner MCPTT server of the constituent group can also respond to
a group call request with a redirection response, such as \"moved
temporarily\" that includes the group URI of the temporary group formed by
group regroup procedure.
##### 10.6.2.4.3 Group call for an MCPTT group defined in the partner MCPTT

Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT group is defined on the group management server which is located in
the partner MCPTT system with MCPTT users affiliated to that group.
2\. The members of the MCPTT group defined in partner MCPTT system belong to
different MCPTT systems.
Figure 10.6.2.4.3.1-1: Pre-arranged group call setup for an MCPTT group
defined in partner MCPTT system (initiating)
1\. The affiliated MCPTT user via MCPTT client initiates a group call with an
MCPTT group ID. A group call request message with the MCPTT group ID is routed
to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system determines the group home
MCPTT server where the MCPTT group is defined.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system forwards the group call
request to the MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system which owns the group
and is where the authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the temporary group.
4\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system checks whether the user of
MCPTT client is authorized for initiating the group call for the selected
group. If authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members
of that group and their affiliation status, based on the information from
group management server.
5\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system initiates a call request to
the group\'s affiliated members.
6\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system provides a group call
response message to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system of the MCPTT
client. The group call response message will consist of the success or failure
result and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.
7\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system forwards the group call
response message to the MCPTT client.
8 Upon successful call setup completion a group call is established for the
group members.
###### 10.6.2.4.3.2 Pre-arranged group call setup -- terminating side
The procedure described in figure 10.6.2.4.3.2-1 is used for pre-arranged
group call setup when acknowledgement is required from at least some of the
call recipients.
Figure 10.6.2.4.3.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup for an MCPTT group
defined in partner MCPTT system (terminating)
1\. MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system sends the group call request
message towards the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system of the MCPTT
client.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system determines whether to forward
the group call request message to the MCPTT client based on the user profile.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system forwards the group call
request message to MCPTT client. The MCPTT server indicates whether
acknowledgement is required for the call.
4\. MCPTT user is notified about the incoming group call.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client accepts the group call and a response message
is sent to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system. This response may
contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending acknowledgement may be
based on configuration.
6\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system forwards the response message
to the MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system (i.e. group hosting MCPTT
server).
###### 10.6.2.4.3.3 Chat group call setup
Figure 10.6.2.4.3.3-1 illustrates the group call setup procedure for an MCPTT
chat group defined in the partner MCPTT system.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT users of MCPTT clients 1, 2 and 3 are members of a chat group
that is defined in the partner MCPTT system.
2\. MCPTT user 2 and MCPTT user 3 have previously joined (affiliated) to the
group. MCPTT client 1, client 2, and client 3 are registered and all users
(MCPTT user 1, user 2, and user 3) have been authenticated and authorized to
use the MCPTT service.
3\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 may have activated
functional alias(es) configured to be used during the group call
communication.
4\. No call is currently in progress for the group.
5\. Optionally the MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 has bound a functional alias
to the MCPTT group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).
Figure 10.6.2.4.3.3-1: Chat group call setup for an MCPTT group defined in
partner MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT client 1 sends a group join request with the MCPTT group ID of the
desired group. If there is a request to transmit, then the group join request
contains an indication of an implicit floor request.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system verifies that MCPTT user 1 is
authorized to affiliate to the group by following the affiliation procedure
(subclause 10.8.3.2 / 10.8.3.2a in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).The MCPTT server of
the primary MCPTT system determines the group home MCPTT server where the
MCPTT group is defined.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system forwards the group join
request to the partner MCPTT server i.e. to the the group home MCPTT server.
4\. The partner MCPTT server receives the group join request. The partner
MCPTT server generates an implicit affiliation (if the MCPTT user 1 is not
already affiliated to the group) and verifies that MCPTT user 1 is authorized
to affiliate to the group by following the affiliation procedure (subclause
10.8.3 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]).
If the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via
binding, the MCPTT server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the
functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding,
it is up to the MCPTT server implementation to determine a value for the
functional alias to be used.
If present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias is
allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
5\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system replies with a group join
response indicating the acceptance of the group join request and also
including the MCPTT server selected media parameters for the group call.
6\. The primary MCPTT server stores the affiliation status of the user for the
requested MCPTT group.
7\. The primary MCPTT server forwards the group join response to the MCPTT
client.
8\. The MCPTT user 1 requests to transmit, causing the media plane to be
established (if not already established) for the call.
9\. Floor control will continue to be used by the floor participants
associated with MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 for the
duration of the call. Media plane signalling using floor control will be used
for subsequent calls for the group as long as one or more users are
affiliated.
##### 10.6.2.4.4 Merging of groups involving multiple MCPTT systems
Figure 10.6.2.4.4-1 below illustrates the merging of MCPTT clients in a newly
formed temporary group with active group calls.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The temporary group consists of group 1, which is hosted by the primary
MCPTT system, and group 2, which is hosted by the partner MCPTT system.
2\. Both group 1 and group 2 have active calls.
3\. The group management client of the authorized MCPTT user belongs to the
primary MCPTT system.
Figure 10.6.2.4.4-1: Merging of groups involving multiple MCPTT systems
1\. The temporary group formation - group regrouping involving multiple MCPTT
systems, according to subclause 10.2.4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], takes place.
2\. The MCPTT client of the authorized MCPTT user requests group call merge
operation to MCPTT server hosting group 1. The identities of the groups being
combined are included in this message.
3\. The MCPTT server (primary) responds with an OK response.
4\. The MCPTT server (primary) sends a group combine request to the MCPTT
server (partner) that is hosting group 2.
5\. The MCPTT server (partner) responds with a list members of group 2 and an
indication of which members are affiliated and which are active in the call.
6\. The MCPTT server (primary) contacts the active members of group 2 inviting
them to join the temporary group call.
7\. The MCPTT server (partner) transfers group 2\'s floor status data
(including pending requests and queue positions) to the primary MCPTT server
and combines this with the group 1\'s floor status data in order to create the
temporary group\'s floor status data.
8\. The MCPTT server (primary) performs floor control for the temporary group.
9\. The MCPTT server (primary) notifies the MCPTT client of the authorised
MCPTT user that the active calls have been merged.
NOTE: The MCPTT server in primary system revokes and queues floor given to one
of the two talkers based on the arbitration result for the temporary group.
#### 10.6.2.5 Broadcast group call
##### 10.6.2.5.1 General
A broadcast group call is a special group call where the initiating MCPTT user
expects no response from the other MCPTT users, so that when his transmission
is complete, so is the call.
##### 10.6.2.5.2 Common broadcast group call procedure
The group-broadcast group and the broadcast regrouped group are similar in
structure (a collection of groups). Similarly the user-broadcast group and the
pre-arranged group (a collection of users) are similar in structure. Only the
call originator can transmit media during the broadcast group call and the
broadcast group call is released when the transmission is complete, unless the
call originator is overridden.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2-1 illustrates the common procedure for group-broadcast group
call, user-broadcast group call, and broadcast regrouped group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are members of a group-broadcast
group/user-broadcast group/broadcast regroup group.
2\. Optionally, MCPTT client 1 may have an activated functional alias for the
group communication.
3\. The MCPTT server may have subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2-1: Broadcast group call
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates the broadcast group call setup
procedure with the indication of broadcast group call. The signalling
procedure is identical to the group call setup as described in subclause
10.6.2 with the inclusion of the parameter for broadcast group call indicator.
The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may include a functional alias used for the
broadcast group call and the MCPTT server checks whether the provided
functional alias can be used and has been activated for the MCPTT user.
NOTE 1: Broadcast group call applies to both pre-arranged and chat group call
model. In the chat group call model case, the broadcast group call setup
procedure is done by floor control signalling.
2\. MCPTT client 1 starts to transmit media.
NOTE 2: Only the call originating MCPTT user is allowed to transmit media on
broadcast group call, unless overridden.
NOTE 3: A broadcast group call transmitted on a user-broadcast group has
priority over group calls involving users within the user hierarchy. A
broadcast group call transmitted on a group-broadcast group has priority over
group calls on its subordinate groups.
3\. If the media transmission from call originating MCPTT user is complete,
the broadcast group call is released.
###### 10.6.2.5.2.1 Group-broadcast group call procedure
The group-broadcast group is defined as a set of groups, not a set of MCPTT
users. The group-broadcast group is also defined with a hierarchy. It is
expected that the MCPTT user that originates the group-broadcast group call is
the only one transmitting media during the group-broadcast group call and that
the group-broadcast group call is terminated when the transmission is
complete. However, if the override feature is enabled, then the call
originator may be overridden.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call
establishment.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group (e.g. A) to which MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are members
is a subordinate group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast
group was defined with group A as a subordinate group).
2\. The group (e.g. A) currently has an on-going MCPTT group call that is not
an MCPTT emergency group call.
3\. The call initiator of the group-broadcast group is a member of another
group (e.g., X, not group A) which is also a subordinate group of the group-
broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast group was defined with group X as a
subordinate group).
4\. The group-broadcast group and its subordinated groups are defined in the
same group management server and served by the same MCPTT server.
5\. Optionally, MCPTT client 3 may have an activated functional alias for the
group communication.
6\. The MCPTT server may have subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.1-1: Group-broadcast group call
1\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3 initiates the group-broadcast group call
setup procedure.
2\. The MCPTT client 3 sends a group-broadcast group call request to the MCPTT
server. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may include a functional alias used
for the broadcast group call.
3\. The MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias can be used
and has been activated for the MCPTT user. The MCPTT server needs to resolve
the group-broadcast group ID into its subordinate groups in order to contact
the affiliated MCPTT users of those subordinate groups.
4\. The MCPTT server then needs to consider any on-going group calls on those
subordinate groups because this may affect the behaviour for what happens
next. In this case a group call exists on a subordinate group. Thus, the MCPTT
users involved in the group call on this subordinate group.
5\. Optionally the on-going group call on a subordinate group may be
terminated in which case the MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 need to be sent
a Group call release request.
6\. The MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 then notify their users of the group
call release request.
7\. The MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 respond to the group call release
request by sending a group call release response.
8\. A group-broadcast group call request is sent to both the MCPTT client 1
and the MCPTT client 2. The request may contain the functional alias of the
calling party.
9\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 notify their users of the incoming
group-broadcast group call. The functional alias of the calling party, if
available, is presented to the users.
10\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 respond to the group-broadcast group
call request by sending a group-broadcast group call response.
11\. The MCPTT server responds to MCPTT client 3 (the call initiator) that the
group-broadcast group call has been established by sending a group-broadcast
group call response.
12\. The MCPTT client 3 notifies its user that the user can begin transmitting
using the group-broadcast group call resources.
Resources are now available for the transmission from MCPTT client 3 to MCPTT
client 1 and MCPTT client 2. Once the user of MCPTT cleint 3 completes
transmitting, the group-broadcast group call is releases as are the resources.
###### 10.6.2.5.2.2 Group-broadcast group call procedure when a subordinate
group has an on-going MCPTT emergency group call
The group-broadcast group is defined as a set of groups, not MCPTT users. The
affiliated MCPTT group members of a subordinate group with an on-going MCPTT
emergency group call are not interrupted by a group-broadcast group call.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call
when a subordinate group has an on-going MCPTT emergency group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT The group (e.g. A) to which MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
members is a subordinate group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-
broadcast group was defined with group A as a subordinate group).
2\. The group (e.g. A) currently has an on-going MCPTT emergency group call.
3\. The call initiator (user of MCPTT client 3) of the group-broadcast group
is a member of another group (e.g., X, not group A) which is also a
subordinate group of the group-broadcast group (i.e., the group-broadcast
group was defined with group X as a subordinate group).
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.2-1: Group-broadcast group call when an emergency group call
is on-going in one of the subordinate groups
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3 initiates the group-broadcast group call
setup procedure.
2\. The MCPTT client 3 sends a group-broadcast group call request to the MCPTT
server.
3\. The MCPTT server needs to resolve the group-broadcast group ID into its
subordinate groups in order to contact the affiliated MCPTT group members of
those subordinate groups.
4\. The MCPTT server then considers any on-going group calls on those
subordinate groups (e.g. A) because this may effect the behaviour for what
happens next. In this case an emergency group call exists on a subordinate
group.
NOTE: Not shown - The group-broadcast group call request is sent to the MCPTT
clients of the MCPTT users who are affiliated members of any other subordinate
groups of the group-broadcast group being set up
5\. The MCPTT server responds to the call initiator that the group-broadcast
group call has been established.
6\. The MCPTT client 3 notifies its user that the user can begin transmitting
using the group-broadcast group call resources.
Resources are now available for the transmission from MCPTT client 3 to the
MCPTT clients (not shown) of other subordinate groups (i.e., not A). Once the
user of MCPTT cleint 3 completes transmitting, the group-broadcast group call
is releases as are the resources.
###### 10.6.2.5.2.3 Group-broadcast group call release procedure
When the call originator has completed transmitting, the group-broadcast group
call is terminated and resources released.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure for group-broadcast group call
release.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An on-going group-broadcast group call involving MCPTT client 1, MCPTT
client 2, and MCPTT client 3 exists.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.3-1: Group-broadcast group call transmission ended
1\. MCPTT user on MCPTT client 3 finished transmitting.
2\. A group-broadcast group call release request is sent to the MCPTT server
of the group-broadcast group.
3\. The MCPTT users of MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 of the group-
broadcast group\'s subordinate groups are sent a group-broadcast group call
release request
4\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 notify their users that the group-
broadcast group call has ended.
5\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 respond to confirm the release of the
group-broadcast group call by sending a group-broadcast group call release
response.
6\. The MCPTT server sends a group-broadcast group call release response
indicating to the initiator that the call is now terminated.
###### 10.6.2.5.2.4 Server-initiated broadcast group call release procedure
In a broadcast group call, when the call originator has completed
transmitting, the MCPTT client releases the floor. Upon receiving the floor
release message the MCPTT server then determines if the broadcast call should
be released.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure for server-initiated broadcast
group call release.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An on-going broadcast group call involving MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2,
and MCPTT client 3 exists.
2\. MCPTT client 3 is transmitting.
Figure 10.6.2.5.2.4-1: Server-initiated broadcast group call release
1\. MCPTT user on MCPTT client 3 finished transmitting.
2\. MCPTT client 3 sends a Floor release message to the MCPTT server of the
group.
3\. The MCPTT Server determines that the group is a broadcast group and
decides that the call should be released.
NOTE 1: Whether the MCPTT server uses the Broadcast indicator in the
originating group call request message or uses the configured Group call hang
timer to determine whether the call should be released is left to
implementation.
4\. The MCPTT server sends a Group call release request to MCPTT clients 1, 2,
and 3.
5\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 notify their users that the group call
has ended.
6\. MCPTT clients 1, 2, and 3 respond to confirm the release of the group call
by sending a group call release response.
NOTE 2: If the group call release request is sent from the MCPTT server via
MBMS, no response is expected from the MCPTT clients.
##### 10.6.2.5.3 Void
##### 10.6.2.5.4 Group call for broadcast temporary groups across multiple
MCPTT systems
Figure 10.6.2.5.4-1 illustrates the procedure for broadcast temporary group
calls across multiple MCPTT systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share their users\' information to the primary MCPTT system.
2\. A broadcast temporary group is formed on the MCPTT server of the primary
MCPTT system by an authorized MCPTT user (e.g. dispatcher) by the group
regroup procedure (subclause 10.2.4.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]) and identified
via a temporary MCPTT group ID.
3\. The affiliated MCPTT group members of the constituent MCPTT groups have
been implicitly affiliated to the temporary group.
4\. The MCPTT user of the MCPTT client is authorized to transmit on a
broadcast temporary group.
5\. One or more of the constituent groups of the temporary group may belong to
MCPTT servers of partner MCPTT systems.
Figure 10.6.2.5.4-1: Group call involving a broadcast temporary group across
multiple MCPTT systems
1\. The MCPTT user via MCPTT client initiates a group call for a broadcast
temporary group with an MCPTT group ID, temporary group indicator, and the
broadcast indicator. A group call request message with the MCPTT group ID is
routed to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system, which owns the group
and is where the authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher created the broadcast
temporary group. The MCPTT group ID is a temporary MCPTT group ID.
2\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system obtains the temporary group
information (either from group management server or itself) including the
constituent MCPTT groups\' identities, accessible group members list of the
constituent groups, the broadcast group type, and other related data.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system initiates directly a call
request to the accessible group members using the detailed user information
and/or location information. The group members upon receipt of the call
request may accept or reject the call.
4\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system may not have access to group
members\' information of the constituent group belonging to the partner MCPTT
system. For such group members, the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system
initiates a group call request message to the MCPTT server of the partner
MCPTT system with the target group\'s MCPTT group ID information.
5\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system further initiates a call
request to the clients of the constituent group\'s members as described in
step 3.
6\. The MCPTT server of the partner MCPTT system provides a group call
response to the MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system with success or
failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a failure.
7\. The MCPTT server of the primary MCPTT system provides a group call
response message to the MCPTT client of the affiliated MCPTT user upon
receiving responses to the call requests sent to members of primary and
partner MCPTT systems. The group call response message will consist of the
success or failure result and/or detailed reason information if there is a
failure.
NOTE 1: The group call response message is triggered depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
8\. Upon successful call setup completion a broadcast group call is
established for the group members from constituent groups of multiple MCPTT
servers. The call originating MCPTT user starts transmitting media to other
group call participants. The media is also distributed to the partner MCPTT
system.
NOTE 2: Only the call originating MCPTT user is allowed to transmit media on a
broadcast temporary group call.
9\. At the completion of the media transmission, the broadcast temporary group
call is released.
#### 10.6.2.6 Emergency and imminent peril procedures
##### 10.6.2.6.1 MCPTT emergency group call
###### 10.6.2.6.1.1 MCPTT emergency group call commencement
The procedure describes the case where an MCPTT client is initiating an MCPTT
emergency group call with the affiliated MCPTT members of that MCPTT group. An
MCPTT client in the MCPTT emergency state gains elevated access privilege for
all of the MCPTT user\'s mission critical applications. Initiating an MCPTT
emergency group call puts the MCPTT group into the in-progress emergency
state. While in the in-progress emergency state, all MCPTT group calls in the
MCPTT group are processed as MCPTT emergency group calls by the MCPTT server
until the in-progress emergency state of the MCPTT group is cancelled.
Figure 10.6.2.6.1.1-1 shows the procedures for the MCPTT client initiating
establishment of an MCPTT emergency group call with an MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT
users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 belong to the same
MCPTT group which is defined on MCPTT group management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group
that has been designated via provisioning as the MCPTT emergency group.
> 4\. Optionally, MCPTT client 1 may use an activated functional alias for the
> group communication.
5\. The MCPTT server may have subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
NOTE 2: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the selected group.
Figure 10.6.2.6.1.1-1: MCPTT emergency group call
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency group call.
MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client
1 may select a functional alias used for the call. The MCPTT emergency state
of MCPTT client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCPTT
client 1.
NOTE 3: While MCPTT client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCPTT group and
private calls initiated by MCPTT client 1 are initiated as MCPTT emergency
calls.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency group call request towards the
MCPTT server. The MCPTT server records the identity of the MCPTT user that
initiated the MCPTT emergency group call until the MCPTT emergency state of
the group is cancelled. Once an MCPTT emergency call has been initiated, the
MCPTT group is considered to be in an in-progress emergency state until the
emergency state of the group is cancelled. If configured to send an MCPTT
emergency alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency group call, the request
also contains an indication that an MCPTT emergency alert is to be initiated.
The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
NOTE 4: While the MCPTT group is in the in-progress emergency state, all MCPTT
group calls within the group are processed as emergency group calls by the
MCPTT server. MCPTT group members that are not in the emergency state do not
indicate emergency in group call requests but set the requested priority of
all group call requests to high priority.
3\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates MCPTT client 1 to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized
for initiation of MCPTT emergency calls on the indicated MCPTT group, and if
authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group
management server. The MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional
alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user.
5\. The MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
NOTE 5: Successive calls during the MCPTT group\'s in-progress emergency state
will all receive the adjusted bearer priority.
6\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request
contains an indication of the in-progress emergency. The request contains an
indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if the request from the originator
indicated MCPTT emergency alert.
7\. MCPTT users are notified of the incoming MCPTT emergency group call. The
functional alias of the group call initiating MCPTT user may be displayed.
8\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency group call response
to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT emergency group call request. For
a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent. The receiving MCPTT
client check whether it is already involved in an MCPTT emergency group call
when using this functional alias and whether the maximum number of parallel
MCPTT emergency group calls when using this functional alias has been reached.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to inform the successful MCPTT emergency call establishment.
NOTE 6: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 10
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 have successfully
established media plane for communication. MCPTT floor participant 1, floor
participant 2 and floor participant 3 exchange floor control information e.g.,
MCPTT client 1 receives the floor granted information over the established
media plane, while the other MCPTT client\'s receive floor taken information.
MCPTT client 1 indicates to the MCPTT user that the floor is available to send
media, while the other MCPTT clients in the MCPTT emergency group call will be
receiving that media. MCPTT client 1 can override other clients in the call
except those that are also in the MCPTT emergency state.
###### 10.6.2.6.1.2 MCPTT group call upgraded to an MCPTT emergency group call
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is upgrading
an MCPTT group call to an MCPTT emergency group call while the MCPTT group
call is already in progress.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client upgrading an MCPTT group call on an MCPTT
group to an MCPTT emergency group call.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. An MCPTT group call is already in progress.
4\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been configured to send an MCPTT
emergency alert when upgrading an MCPTT emergency group call.
Figure 10.6.2.6.1.2-1: MCPTT group call upgraded to an MCPTT emergency group
call
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates a group emergency. MCPTT client
1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state of MCPTT client 1
is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCPTT client 1.
NOTE 2: While MCPTT client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCPTT group and
private calls initiated by MCPTT client 1 are initiated as MCPTT emergency
calls.
2\. MCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to upgrade the MCPTT group to an
in-progress emergency state by sending an MCPTT emergency group call request.
If configured to send an MCPTT alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency
upgrade, the request also contains an indication that an MCPTT alert is to be
initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
NOTE 3: While the MCPTT group is in the in-progress emergency state, all MCPTT
group calls within the group are processed as emergency group calls by the
MCPTT server. MCPTT group members that are not in the emergency state do not
indicate emergency in group call requests but set the requested priority of
all group call requests to high priority.
3\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for all or
selected participants in the MCPTT group call that receive the communication
over unicast.
NOTE 4: The determination of the selected participants whose bearers have to
be upgraded is left to implementation.
4\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call request towards the
MCPTT clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request
contains an indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if the request from the
originator indicated MCPTT emergency alert.
5\. MCPTT users are notified of the in-progress emergency state of the MCPTT
group.
6\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT emergency group call response
to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT group emergency request. For a
multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
7\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to confirm the upgrade request.
NOTE 5: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 3, and prior to step 8
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 continue with the MCPTT
group call, which has been transformed into an MCPTT emergency group call.
MCPTT client 1 can override other clients in the call except those that are
also in the MCPTT emergency state.
###### 10.6.2.6.1.3 MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel
NOTE 1: In Rel-14 and Rel-13 versions of this specification the title of this
subclause is \"MCPTT emergency group call cancel\".
The procedure describes the case where an MCPTT client cancels an MCPTT
group\'s in-progress emergency state. The emergency state of the group may
alternatively be cancelled by the emergency alert cancellation procedure
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an in-progress emergency of a
group.
NOTE 2: For simplicity, a single MCPTT server is shown in place of a user home
MCPTT server and a group hosting MCPTT server.
NOTE 3: The end of the MCPTT emergency group call does not cancel the MCPTT
group\'s in-progress emergency state. It is explicitly cancelled by an
authorized user using this procedure, or by the emergency alert cancellation
procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. MCPTT group members have been notified about the in-progress emergency.
4\. The MCPTT group is in the in-progress emergency state and has prioritized
bearer support when a call is in progress.
5\. MCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel an in-progress emergency for the
group.
Figure 10.6.2.6.1.3-1: MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT in-progress emergency
group state cancel.
NOTE 4: An authorized user (e.g. dispatcher, supervisor) can cancel either or
both the in-progress emergency state of the group and the MC service emergency
alert of another user. However, only the initiator of an MCPTT emergency alert
can cancel the initiator\'s local MCPTT emergency state. Determination of
authorized users is implementation dependent.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel
request to the MCPTT server.
NOTE 5: If an MCPTT emergency alert relating to MCPTT client 1 is in effect
together with an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state on the MCPTT group,
the MCPTT emergency alert of MCPTT client 1 can be cancelled at the same time.
In that case, the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request
carries an indication that the emergency alert of MCPTT client 1 is also being
cancelled.
NOTE 6: If an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request is
received by the MCPTT server while a group member that is in the emergency
state is transmitting, the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel
request is rejected by the MCPTT server.
3\. MCPTT server resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based upon the information from
group management server.
4\. The MCPTT server verifies that the user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized to
cancel the emergency state of this MCPTT group. The MCPTT server
cancels/resets the in-progress emergency state of the MCPTT group.
5\. If a call is currently in progress, the MCPTT server adjusts the priority
of the underlying bearer; priority treatment is no longer required.
6\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel
request to the MCPTT group members.
7\. MCPTT group members are notified of the MCPTT in-progress emergency group
state cancel.
8\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT in-progress emergency group
state cancel response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT in-progress
emergency group state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these
acknowledgements are not sent.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel
response to the MCPTT user 1 to confirm the MCPTT in-progress emergency group
state cancel. If the MCPTT in-progress emergency group state cancel request
(in step 2) contained the \"Alert indicator\" IE, the MCPTT client 1 resets
its local emergency status.
NOTE 7: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 4, depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
##### 10.6.2.6.2 MCPTT imminent peril group call
###### 10.6.2.6.2.1 MCPTT imminent peril group call commencement
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is initiating
an imminent peril group call for communicating with the affiliated MCPTT
members of that MCPTT group. This procedure will gain elevated access
privilege for the MCPTT client if it is not already in that state. The access
privilege for other applications will not necessarily be affected.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.2.1-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of an imminent peril
group call with an MCPTT group i.e., MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, MCPTT
client 2 and MCPTT client 3 belong to the same MCPTT group which is defined on
MCPTT group management server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been provisioned with an MCPTT group
that has been designated in the provisioning to be used for imminent peril
communications.
NOTE 1: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for imminent
peril behaviour on the selected group.
4\. Optionally, MCPTT client 1 may use an activated functional alias for the
group communication.
5\. The MCPTT server may have subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 10.6.2.6.2.1-1: MCPTT imminent peril group call
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an imminent peril group call. The
MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may select a functional alias used for the call.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT imminent peril group call request towards
the MCPTT server. The request contains an indication of the in-progress
imminent peril. The MCPTT server records the identity of the MCPTT user that
initiated the imminent peril group call until the in-progress imminent peril
state is cancelled. Once an imminent peril group call has been initiated, the
MCPTT group is considered to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until
cancelled. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
If the group call request includes an implicit floor request it may also
include location information.
3\. The MCPTT server implicitly affiliates MCPTT client 1 to the imminent
peril group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 1 is authorized
for initiation of imminent peril group calls on the indicated MCPTT group, and
if authorized, it resolves the MCPTT group ID to determine the members of that
MCPTT group and their affiliation status, based on the information from group
management server. The MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional
alias, if present, can be used and has been activated for the user.
5\. The MCPTT server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
NOTE 2: Successive calls during the in-progress imminent peril state will all
receive the adjusted bearer priority.
6\. MCPTT server sends the imminent peril group call request towards the MCPTT
clients of each of those affiliated MCPTT group members. The request contains
an indication of the in-progress imminent peril. If location information was
included in the imminent peril group call request, the MCPTT server checks the
privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location information of
MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call (refer to Annex A.3
\"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a call
when talking\").
7\. MCPTT users are notified of the incoming imminent peril call. The
functional alias of the group call initiating MCPTT user may be displayed.
8\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT imminent peril group call
response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the imminent peril call request.
For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not set.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT imminent peril group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to inform the successful imminent peril call establishment.
NOTE 3: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 10
depending on the conditions to proceed with the imminent peril call.
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 have successfully
established media plane for communication. MCPTT floor participant 1, floor
participant 2 and floor participant 3 exchange floor control information e.g.,
MCPTT client 1 receives the floor granted information over the established
media plane, while the other MCPTT clients receive floor taken information.
MCPTT client 1 indicates to the MCPTT user that the floor is available to send
media, while the other MCPTT clients in the imminent peril call will be
receiving that media.
###### 10.6.2.6.2.2 Imminent peril group call upgrade
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is upgrading
an MCPTT group call to an imminent peril group call while the MCPTT group call
is already in progress.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.2.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client upgrading an MCPTT group call on an MCPTT
group to an imminent peril group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 affiliated to that MCPTT
group.
2\. All members of the MCPTT group belong to the same MCPTT system.
3\. An MCPTT group call is already in progress.
Figure 10.6.2.6.2.2-1: MCPTT group call upgrade to an imminent peril group
call
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates an imminent peril call.
2\. MCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to upgrade the MCPTT group to an
in-progress imminent peril state by sending an MCPTT imminent peril group call
request. The request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request.
If the imminent peril group call request includes an implicit floor request it
may also include location information.
3\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for all
participants in the MCPTT group.
4\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT imminent peril group call request towards
the MCPTT clients of the affiliated MCPTT group members. If location
information was included in the imminent peril group call request, the MCPTT
server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location
information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the call
(refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other
MCPTT users on a call when talking\").
5\. MCPTT users are notified of the in-progress imminent peril state of the
MCPTT group.
6\. The receiving MCPTT clients send the MCPTT imminent peril group call
response to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the MCPTT imminent peril group
call request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not set.
7\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT imminent peril group call response to the
MCPTT user 1 to confirm the upgrade request.
NOTE: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 8
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 continue with the MCPTT
group call, which has been transformed into an imminent peril group call.
###### 10.6.2.6.2.3 MCPTT in-progress imminent peril group state cancel
NOTE 1: In Rel-14 and Rel-13 versions of this specification the title of this
subclause is \"MCPTT imminent peril group call cancel\".
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user cancels an
MCPTT group\'s in-progress imminent peril state.
Procedures in figure 10.6.2.6.2.3-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client cancelling an MCPTT group\'s in-progress
imminent peril state.
NOTE 2: The end of the imminent peril call does not cancel the MCPTT group\'s
in-progress imminent peril state. It is explicitly cancelled by an authorized

#### 10.6.2.9 Group regroup with preconfigured group
##### 10.6.2.9.1 General
A group regroup may be achieved by regrouping MCPTT groups into a new MCPTT
regroup group which uses the configuration of a separate preconfigured MCPTT
group. The MCPTT regroup group configuration needs to be provided to the
relevant MCPTT group members of the MCPTT groups that will be regrouped in
advance of the regrouping operation.
NOTE 1: A preconfigured group which is intended only to provide configuration
for the preconfigured regroup process is identified by a parameter in the
group configuration described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
NOTE 2: The configuration may alternatively be taken from any MCPTT group that
has been configured in the user profile of all the relevant MCPTT users who
will be regrouped.
NOTE 3: Regroup groups may be defined according to the organizational
structure of a mission critical organization, or by some other means which
allows the MCPTT client of an authorized user to be aware of an appropriate
regroup group for sets of MCPTT groups that will be regrouped together.
The preconfigured MCPTT group that provides the configuration is not used as
the MCPTT regroup group itself, it only provides configuration for one or more
MCPTT regroup groups. The MCPTT group ID of the regroup group is provided by
the authorized user when the preconfigured regrouping is carried out.
The MCPTT regroup group can be specified to be a broadcast or non-broadcast
type according to the configuration of the MCPTT group whose configuration is
specified by the regroup request. The broadcast type of regroup is used for
one-way communication where only an authorized MCX user is allowed to transmit
and all other regroup members are only allowed to receive the communication
(e.g. a call from a dispatcher to all regroup members). The non-broadcast type
is used for two-way communication where all regroup members can transmit and
receive (i.e, the regroup group call behaves like a normal non-broadcast group
call).
These procedures provide a regrouping service for MCPTT only and are
independent of group regrouping procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
If the MCPTT server has been notified by the group management server that one
of the MCPTT groups that has been requested for regrouping by means of this
procedure has already been regrouped by the group regrouping procedure
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], the MCPTT server shall reject the request
for regrouping described in the following procedure.
Editor\'s note: These procedures provide a regrouping service for MCPTT only;
any issues arising from conflicts with similar regrouping operations for
MCVideo and MCData are FFS.
##### 10.6.2.9.2 Regroup procedures in single MCPTT system
###### 10.6.2.9.2.1 Regroup formation using preconfigured group in single
MCPTT system
Figure 10.6.2.9.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a group regroup
procedure using a preconfigured MCPTT group. The procedure takes place prior
to the establishment of a group call to the regroup group.
Pre-conditions:
\- MCPTT client 2 is an affiliated member of MCPTT group 1 and MCPTT client 3
is an affiliated member of MCPTT group 2.
\- The MCPTT group identity and group configuration for the regroup MCPTT
group have been preconfigured in MCPTT clients 2 and 3, and MCPTT clients 2
and 3 have received the relevant security related information to allow them to
communicate in the regroup MCPTT group.
\- MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiated a preconfigured regroup
procedure.
\- MCPTT client 1 is aware of a suitable preconfigured regroup group whose
configuration has been preconfigured in the MCPTT UEs of the group members who
will be regrouped.
\- In order to be aware whether the group is regrouped, the MCPTT server is
subscribed to the group configuration in GMS.
\- The GMS has subscribed group dynamic data as specified in subclause
10.1.5.5.1 from the MCPTT server using the procedures defined in subclause
10.1.5.6 in TS 23.280 [16].
Figure 10.6.2.9.2.1-1: Regroup procedure using preconfigured group in single
MCPTT system
1\. The authorized user of MCPTT client 1 initiates the regroup procedure,
specifying the list of MCPTT groups to be regrouped (MCPTT groups 1 and 2),
the MCPTT group ID of the regroup group (if available) and the MCPTT group ID
of the group from which configuration information for the regroup group is to
be taken.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MCPTT
server.
3\. The MCPTT server checks that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a
preconfigured regroup procedure, and resolves the group identities of the
MCPTT groups requested in step 1. The MCPTT server also checks which group
members are affiliated to MCPTT groups 1 and 2. The MCPTT server may retrieve
the configuration for the regroup group from the GMS if that configuration
information is not already known to the MCPTT server. The MCPTT server also
checks that none of the MCPTT groups that are requested for regrouping are
already regrouped by any mechanism. If the preconfigured regroup request is
authorized, the MCPTT server assigns a MCPTT group ID for this regroup group
call if:
i. one is not provided in the request or
ii. the one provided in the request is not accepted.
NOTE 1: This procedure does not require that the authorized user of MCPTT
client 1 is a group member of MCPTT groups 1 or 2, or that the authorized user
of MCPTT client 1 is an affiliated group member of MCPTT groups 1 or 2.
NOTE 2: The list of groups included in the regroup is held in dynamic data in
the MCPTT server, and is not used to update group configuration information in
the group management server.
4a. If the MCPTT server determines that any of the groups requested for
regrouping, including the regroup group, have been regrouped by other group
regrouping procedures, the MCPTT server then sends a preconfigured regroup
reject back to MCPTT client 1 with a reject reason indicating that one of the
groups has already been regrouped, and this procedure terminates.
4b. The MCPTT server shall send the preconfigured regroup request return
message to MCPTT client 1 containing the below:
i. the MCPTT group ID is generated by the MCPTT server; and
ii. result of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not
If the preconfigured regroup request is not authorized, MCPTT client 1 shall
not proceed with the rest of the steps.
5\. The MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to MCPTT clients
2 and 3 in steps 5a and 5b respectively.
NOTE 3: Only group members that are affiliated to the MCPTT groups that are to
be regrouped are sent a preconfigured regroup request.
6\. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the regrouping in steps 6a and
6b respectively.
7\. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup response to the
MCPTT server to acknowledge the regrouping action. These acknowledgements are
not sent in response to a multicast transmission of the preconfigured regroup
request.
8\. The MCPTT server affiliates the regrouped MCPTT clients to the regroup
group.
9\. The MCPTT server sends a preconfigured regroup response to MCPTT client 1.
After the group regrouping procedure, the regrouping remains in effect until
explicitly cancelled by the procedure in 10.6.2.9.2.2.
MCPTT client participation in the ongoing regroup persists until the MCPTT
client is no longer affiliated to any of the regrouped groups (group 1 or 2 in
this procedure).
MCPTT client affiliation to the regroup group may cease when the UE\'s MCPTT
service ceases, e.g. when the UE is powered down, or by performing a log-off
operation.
Editor\'s note: Data persistence in the MCPTT client following a user log-off
or power down needs further study.
###### 10.6.2.9.2.2 Regroup cancellation in single MCPTT system
Figure 10.6.2.9.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure to cancel a regrouping that
uses a preconfigured MCPTT group.
Pre-conditions:
\- MCPTT clients 2 and 3 have been regrouped into an MCPTT regroup group.
\- MCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel a regrouping that uses a
preconfigured MCPTT group.
\- The GMS has subscribed to group dynamic data as specified in subclause
10.1.5.5.1 from the MCPTT server using the procedures defined in subclause
10.1.5.6 in TS 23.280 [16].
Figure 10.6.2.9.2.2-1: Cancel preconfigured regroup procedure in single MCPTT
system
1\. The authorized user of MCPTT client 1 initiates the cancellation of the
regrouping that uses a preconfigured MCPTT group.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup cancel request to the MCPTT
server, specifying the MCPTT group ID of the regroup group.
3\. The MCPTT server checks that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel a
regrouping that uses a preconfigured group regroup procedure.
4\. The MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup cancel requests to MCPTT
clients 2 and 3 (steps 4a and 4b respectively).
5\. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the cancellation of the group
regrouping in steps 5a and 5b respectively.
6\. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup cancel response
to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the cancellation of the regrouping
function. These acknowledgements are not sent in response to a multicast
transmission of the preconfigured regroup cancel request.
7\. The MCPTT server de-affiliates MCPTT clients 2 and 3 from the MCPTT
regroup group.
8\. The MCPTT server sends a preconfigured regroup cancel response to MCPTT
client 1.
##### 10.6.2.9.3 Regroup procedures in multiple MCPTT systems
###### 10.6.2.9.3.1 Regroup formation using preconfigured group in multiple
MCPTT systems
Figure 10.6.2.9.3.1-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a regroup
procedure using a preconfigured MCPTT group, where at least one of the groups
to be regrouped is configured in a partner MCPTT system. The primary MCPTT
system where the preconfigured group regrouping is initiated does not need to
be aware of the list of group members belonging to groups whose group home
system is the partner MCPTT system. If the group management server in the
primary MCPTT of the regroup group shares the necessary security related
parameters together with the group configuration of the MCPTT regroup group
with the group management server in the partner MCPTT system and the group
management server in the partner MCPTT system distributes this configuration
including those security parameters to its served MCPTT users according to the
procedures in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] subclause 10.2.7, the primary MCPTT system
does not need to be aware of the list of group members of the preconfigured
regroup group that are receiving service in the partner MCPTT system.
The procedure takes place prior to the establishment of a group call to the
regroup group.
In this procedure, any gateway MC servers in the primary or partner MCPTT
systems are not shown.
Pre-conditions:
\- MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiated a preconfigured regroup
procedure, and is receiving MCPTT service in the primary MCPTT system of MCPTT
client 1.
\- MCPTT client 2 is an affiliated member of MCPTT group 1 where MCPTT group 1
is defined in the partner MCPTT system and MCPTT client 2 is receiving service
in the partner MCPTT system of MCPTT client 1.
\- The MCPTT group identity and group configuration for the regroup MCPTT
group have been preconfigured in MCPTT client 2, and MCPTT client 2 has
received the relevant security related information to allow communication in
the regroup MCPTT group.
\- In order to be aware whether the group is regrouped, the MCPTT server is
subscribed to the group configuration in GMS.
\- The GMS has subscribed group dynamic data as specified in subclause
10.1.5.5.1 from the MCPTT server within the same MCPTT system using the
procedures defined in subclause 10.1.5.6 in TS 23.280 [16].
Figure 10.6.2.9.3.1-1: Regroup procedure using preconfigured group in multiple
MCPTT systems
1\. The authorized user of MCPTT client 1 initiates the regroup procedure,
specifying the list of MCPTT groups to be regrouped including MCPTT group 1,
the MCPTT group ID of the regroup group (if available) and the MCPTT group ID
of the group from which configuration information for the regroup group is to
be taken.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MCPTT
server.
3\. The MCPTT server checks that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a
preconfigured regroup procedure, and resolves the group identities of the
MCPTT groups requested in step 1. The MCPTT server also checks which group
members are affiliated to the requested MCPTT groups that are homed in the
primary MCPTT system. The MCPTT server identifies any partner systems which
are the group home systems for MCPTT groups identified in the list of groups
to be regrouped. The MCPTT server may retrieve the configuration for the
regroup group from the GMS if that configuration information is not already
known to the MCPTT server. If the preconfigured regroup request is authorized,
the MCPTT server assigns a MCPTT group ID for this regroup group call if:
i. one is not provided in the request or
ii. the one provided in the request is not accepted.
NOTE 1: This procedure does not require that the authorized user of MCPTT
client 1 is a group member of the MCPTT groups listed in the regroup request,
or that the authorized user of MCPTT client 1 is an affiliated group member of
any of the listed MCPTT groups.
4a. If the MCPTT server determines that any of the groups requested for
regrouping, including the regroup group, have been regrouped by other group
regrouping procedures, the MCPTT server then sends a preconfigured regroup
reject back to MCPTT client 1 with a reject reason indicating that one of the
groups has already been regrouped, and this procedure terminates.
4b. The MCPTT server shall send the preconfigured regroup request return
message to MCPTT client 1 containing the below:
i. the MCPTT group ID is generated by the MCPTT server; and
ii. result of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not
If the preconfigured regroup request is not authorized, MCPTT client 1 shall
not proceed with the rest of the steps.
5\. The MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to the MCPTT
server in the partner MCPTT system.
6\. The partner MCPTT server checks the status of any MCPTT groups hosted by
that partner MCPTT server, and identifies affiliated group members of any of
the identified MCPTT groups (both MCPTT groups that are hosted in the primary
MCPTT system and MCPTT groups that are hosted in the partner MCPTT system)
that are receiving MCPTT service in the partner MCPTT system, which include
MCPTT client 2.
7\. The partner MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup request to MCPTT
client 2.
NOTE 2: Only group members that are affiliated to the MCPTT groups that are to
be regrouped are sent a preconfigured regroup request.
8\. MCPTT client 2 notifies the user of the regrouping.
9\. MCPTT client 2 may send the preconfigured regroup response to the partner
MCPTT server to acknowledge the regrouping action. This acknowledgement is not
sent in response to a multicast transmission of the preconfigured regroup
request.
10\. The partner MCPTT server affiliates the regrouped MCPTT client 2 to the
regroup group.
11\. The MCPTT server sends a preconfigured regroup response to the primary
MCPTT server.
12\. The primary MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup response to
MCPTT client 1.
After the group regrouping procedure, the regrouping remains in effect until
explicitly cancelled by the procedure in 10.6.2.9.3.2.
MCPTT client participation in the ongoing regroup persists until the MCPTT
client is no longer affiliated to any of the regrouped groups (group 1 or 2 in
this procedure).
MCPTT client affiliation to the regroup group may cease when the UE\'s MCPTT
service ceases, e.g. when the UE is powered down, or by performing a log-off
operation.
Editor\'s note: Data persistence in the MCPTT client following a user log-off
or power down needs further study.
###### 10.6.2.9.3.2 Regroup cancellation using preconfigured group in multiple

group in the MCPTT server and coordination to the MC System is FFS.
##### 10.6.2.9.5 Preconfigured regroup update procedures
###### 10.6.2.9.5.1 MCPTT client PTTs on MCPTT group during an in-progress
preconfigured group regroup
Figure 10.6.2.9.5.1-1 illustrates the procedure when a user attempts to setup
an MCPTT group call on a group involved in an in-progress preconfigured MCPTT
group regroup.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCPTT client is an affiliated member of MCPTT group A that is part of
an in-progress preconfigured group regroup with MCPTT groups B and C.
\- MCPTT group D is being used as the preconfigured regroup group.
\- The MCPTT client has missed the preconfigured regroup request message (e.g.
poor signalling conditions, race condition).
Figure 10.6.2.9.5.1-1: Procedure for MCPTT client PTTs on MCPTT group during
an in-progress preconfigured group regroup
1\. The MCPTT client attempts to start a call on MCPTT group A. The MCPTT
client sends a group call request message to the MCPTT server containing MCPTT
group A as the target group.
2\. The MCPTT server checks to see whether MCPTT group A is currently part of
a preconfigured group regroup. In this case the group is part of an active
preconfigured group regroup.
3\. The MCPTT server sends a group call response to the MCPTT client
indicating that the call setup is denied because the group is part of an in-
progress group regroup.
4\. The MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MCPTT
client containing MCPTT group D, the group ID of the preconfigured group.
NOTE 1: This message should be sent over unicast.
5\. The MCPTT client notifies the user of the group call setup failure and of
the regrouping procedure.
6\. The MCPTT client sends the preconfigured regroup response to the MCPTT
server to acknowledge the regrouping action.
7\. The MCPTT server affiliates the regrouped MCPTT client to the regroup
group.
NOTE 2: If there is a call currently in progress on the regroup group then
this MCPTT client can be added to the call using the late entry procedure. If
there is no call currently in progress, then the MCPTT user can retry the
group call setup.
###### 10.6.2.9.5.2 MCPTT client PTTs on preconfigured regroup group after
group regroup has been cancelled
Figure 10.6.2.9.5.2-1 illustrates the procedure when a user attempts to setup
a MCPTT group call on a preconfigured regroup group after the preconfigured
MCPTT group regroup has been cancelled.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCPTT client is a member of MCPTT group A that was part of an in-
progress preconfigured group regroup with MCPTT groups B and C that has been
cancelled. MCPTT group D was used as the MCPTT regroup group.
\- The MCPTT client has missed the preconfigured regroup cancel request
message (e.g. poor signalling conditions, race condition).
Figure 10.6.2.9.5.2-1: Procedure for MCPTT client PTTs on regroup group after
the group regroup is cancelled
1\. The MCPTT client attempts to start a call on MCPTT group D, the MCPTT
regroup group. The MCPTT client sends a group call request message to the
MCPTT server containing MCPTT group D as the target group.
2\. The MCPTT server checks to see whether MCPTT group D is currently being
used as part of a preconfigured group regroup. In this case the preconfigured
group regroup is no longer active.
NOTE 1: The regroup group D can be a group in the MCPTT client\'s profile, and
the MCPTT client can be a member of group D.
3\. The MCPTT server sends a group call response to the MCPTT client
indicating that the call setup is denied because the group regroup is no
longer active.
NOTE 2: In the following, steps 4 and 6 are optional.
4\. The MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup cancel request to the
MCPTT client.
NOTE 3: This message should be sent over unicast.
5\. The MCPTT client notifies the user of the group call setup failure and of
the regrouping cancellation.
6\. The MCPTT client sends the preconfigured regroup cancel response to the
MCPTT server to acknowledge the regrouping cancellation.
NOTE 4: If there is a call currently in progress on MCPTT group A that was
previously part of the group regroup then this MCPTT client can be added to
the call using the late entry procedure. If there is no call currently in
progress then the MCPTT user can retry the group call setup on MCPTT group A.
#### 10.6.2.10 User regroup using group creation procedure
##### 10.6.2.10.1 General
User regroup using the group creation procedure can be initiated by an
authorized user creating a temporary group with a list of MCPTT users. The
group ID for this temporary group can be provided at the time of group
creation. The temporary group can be used by all MCPTT users in the list for
two-way (non-broadcast) communication until deleted by an authorized user.
Optionally, the group can be used for one-way (broadcast ) communication where
the creator of the temporary group can make a broadcast group call, but the
other MCPTT users can only listen to the group call and cannot respond.
##### 10.6.2.10.2 Temporary group creation and broadcast group call by
authorized user
Figure 10.6.2.10.2-1 below illustrates the temporary group creation, and
optional broadcast call setup procedure and temporary group deletion initiated
by an authorized user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The authorized user is aware of the MCPTT users who will be included in
the temporary group.
Figure 10.6.2.10.2-1: User regroup using group creation procedure
1\. The authorized user of MCPTT UE 1 makes use of the group management client
of MCPTT UE 1 to create the temporary group according to the group creation
procedure in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] subclause 10.2.3. The configuration
identifies the group as a temporary group. As part of this procedure, the
MCPTT users are notified of their membership to the temporary group, and the
MCPTT server is notified about the creation of the group and the list of group
members. Alternatively, the MCPTT client 1 (not shown in the figure) on MCPTT
UE 1 can provide the criteria which allows the MCPTT server to determine the
list of MCPTT users to be regrouped.
The authorized user can create the group as a broadcast group by configuring
it as a broadcast group.
NOTE 1: After step 1 the temporary group can be used by all members of the
group for two-way (non-broadcast) communication until deleted by an authorized
user.
NOTE 2: The following two steps are optional and can be used for broadcast
communication where only the creator of the temporary group is allowed to
transmit media on this temporary group.
2\. The creator of the temporary group, the authorized user of MCPTT UE 1,
initiates a broadcast group call according to the procedure described in
subclause 10.6.2.5.2 of the present document. The authorized user of MCPTT UE
1 is implicitly affiliated to the temporary group. The receiving MCPTT clients
of MCPTT UEs 2 and 3 are implicitly affiliated to the group and are notified
of this affiliation during the call setup.
3\. The authorized user of MCPTT UE 1 ends the use of the temporary group
according to the procedure for group deletion described in 3GPP TS 23.280
[16].
##### 10.6.2.10.3 Temporary group deletion by authorized user
If the authorized user wishes to end the use of the temporary group, the
procedure for group deletion described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] is followed.
#### 10.6.2.11 Broadcast group regroup call using preconfigured group
##### 10.6.2.11.1 General
The temporary group created using a preconfigured group can be a broadcast
group or a non-broadcast group. The broadcast regroup is used for one-way
communication where only an authorized MCPTT user is allowed to transmit and
all other regroup members are only allowed to receive the communication (e.g.
a call from a dispatcher to all regroup members). The non-broadcast regroup is
used for two-way communication where all regroup members can transmit and
receive (i.e. the regroup group call behaves like a normal non-broadcast group
call). The broadcast regroup satisfies the temporary group-broadcast group
requirements defined in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2].
A broadcast group regroup call using preconfigured groups can be achieved by
first regrouping MCPTT groups into an MCPTT regroup group, making the
broadcast group call on the regroup group, and then cancelling the
preconfigured group regroup.
##### 10.6.2.11.2 Broadcast group regroup call procedure using preconfigured
group in a single MCPTT system
The broadcast group regroup call procedure using preconfigured group allows an
authorized MCPTT user to initiate a broadcast call to a set of MCPTT groups,
which are regrouped only for the duration of the broadcast call. The regroup
is cancelled at the end of the broadcast call to prevent users from talking
back on the regroup group. This procedure requires that the authorized MCPTT
user is a group member of at least one of the MCPTT groups included in the
regroup operation.
Figure 10.6.2.11.2-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a broadcast group
regroup call using a preconfigured MCPTT group.
Pre-conditions:
\- MCPTT clients 1, 2, and 3 are registered with the MCPTT service.
\- The group configuration for the MCPTT regroup group have been preconfigured
in MCPTT clients 1, 2, and 3, and MCPTT clients 1, 2 and 3 have received the
relevant security related information to allow them to communicate in the
regroup MCPTT group.
\- MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a group regroup using the
preconfigured regroup procedure.
\- MCPTT client 1 is aware of a suitable preconfigured group whose
configuration has been preconfigured in the MC service UEs of the MCPTT users
who will be regrouped.
\- MCPTT client 1 is affiliated to group 1, MCPTT client 2 is affiliated to
group 2, and MCPTT client 3 is affiliated to group 3. Group 4 is used as the
regroup group.
Figure 10.6.2.11.2-1: Broadcast group regroup call using preconfigured group
in a single MCPTT system
1\. The authorized user of MCPTT client 1 initiates the group regroup
formation procedure using preconfigured groups as specified in 10.6.2.9.2.1.
MCPTT groups 1, 2, and 3 are regrouped into group 4.
2\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 performs the broadcast group call
procedure as specified in 10.6.2.5.2.
3\. If the broadcast group call is made on the regroup group 4, the MCPTT
client 1 initiates the preconfigured group regroup cancellation procedure as
specified in 10.6.2.9.2.2.
#### 10.6.2.12 User regroup with preconfigured group
##### 10.6.2.12.1 General
A user regroup may be achieved by regrouping MCPTT users into a new regroup
group which uses the configuration of a separate preconfigured MCPTT group.
The MCPTT regroup group configuration needs to be provided to the relevant
MCPTT users who will be regrouped in advance of the regrouping operation. User
regroup with preconfigured group satisfies user regroup requirements in 3GPP
TS 22.180 [17], particularly [R-6.6.4.2-003].
NOTE 1: A preconfigured group which is intended only to provide configuration
for the preconfigured regroup process is identified by a parameter in the
group configuration described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
NOTE 2: The configuration may alternatively be taken from any MCPTT group that
has been configured in the user profile of all of the relevant MCPTT users who
will be regrouped.
Editor\'s note: These procedures provide a regrouping service for MCPTT only;
any issues arising from conflicts with similar regrouping operations for
MCVideo and MCData are FFS.
The preconfigured MCPTT group that provides the configuration is not used as
the MCPTT regroup group itself, it only provides configuration for one or more
MCPTT regroup groups. The MCPTT group ID of the regroup group is provided by
the authorized user when the preconfigured regrouping is carried out.
##### 10.6.2.12.2 User regroup procedures in a single MCPTT system
###### 10.6.2.12.2.1 User regroup formation in a single MCPTT system
Figure 10.6.2.12.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure to initiate a user regroup
procedure using a preconfigured MCPTT group. The procedure takes place prior
to the establishment of a group call to the MCPTT regroup group.
Pre-conditions:
\- MCPTT clients 2 and 3 are registered with the MCPTT service.
\- An MCPTT group that will be used for configuration of the temporary user
regroup group has been preconfigured in MCPTT clients 2 and 3, and MCPTT
clients 2 and 3 have received the relevant security related information to
allow them to communicate in the temporary user regroup group.
\- MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiated a user regroup using the
preconfigured regroup procedure.
\- MCPTT client 1 is aware of a suitable preconfigured group whose
configuration has been preconfigured in the MCPTT UEs of the MCPTT users who
will be regrouped.
Figure 10.6.2.12.2.1-1: User regroup procedure using preconfigured group in
single MCPTT system
1\. The authorized user of MCPTT client 1 initiates the user regroup
procedure, specifying the list of MCPTT users to be regrouped (MCPTT clients 2
and 3), the MCPTT group ID of the regroup group (if available), and the MCPTT
group ID of the group from which configuration information for the regroup
group is to be taken. Alternatively, the MCPTT client 1 can provide the
criteria which allows the MCPTT server to determine the list of MCPTT users to
be regrouped.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup request to the MCPTT
server. The request indicates the list of users to be included in the regroup
operation.
3\. The MCPTT server checks that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a
preconfigured regroup procedure. If the preconfigured regroup request is
authorized, the MCPTT server assigns a MCPTT group ID for this regroup group
call if:
i. one is not provided in the request or
ii. the one provided in the request is not accepted.
NOTE 1: MCPTT clients can be involved in multiple user and group regroups
simultaneously.
4\. The MCPTT server shall send the preconfigured regroup request return
message to MCPTT client 1 containing the below:
i. the MCPTT group ID is generated by the MCPTT server; and
ii. result of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not
If the preconfigured regroup request is not authorized, MCPTT client 1 shall
not proceed with the rest of the steps.
5\. The MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup requests to MCPTT clients
2 and 3 in steps 4a and 4b respectively.
NOTE 2: When using multicast, the MCPTT server can periodically rebroadcast
the preconfigured regroup request.
6\. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the regrouping in steps 5a and
5b respectively.
7\. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup response to the
MCPTT server to acknowledge the regrouping action. These acknowledgements are
not sent in response to a multicast transmission of the preconfigured regroup
request.
8\. The MCPTT server affiliates the regrouped MCPTT clients to the regroup
group.
9\. The MCPTT server sends a preconfigured regroup response to MCPTT client 1.
NOTE 3: After the user regrouping procedure, the regrouping remains in effect
until explicitly cancelled by the procedure in 10.6.2.12.2.2.
###### 10.6.2.12.2.2 User regroup cancellation in single MCPTT system
Figure 10.6.2.12.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure to cancel a user regrouping
that uses a preconfigured MCPTT group.
Pre-conditions:
\- MCPTT clients 2 and 3 have been regrouped into an MCPTT regroup group.
\- MCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel a user regrouping that uses a
preconfigured MCPTT group.
Figure 10.6.2.12.2.2-1: Cancel preconfigured user regroup procedure in single
MCPTT system
1\. The authorized user of MCPTT client 1 initiates the cancellation of the
user regrouping that uses a preconfigured MCPTT group.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends the preconfigured regroup cancel request to the MCPTT
server, specifying the MCPTT group ID of the regroup group.
3\. The MCPTT server checks that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to cancel a
regrouping that uses a preconfigured user regroup procedure.
4\. The MCPTT server sends the preconfigured regroup cancel requests to MCPTT
clients 2 and 3 (steps 4a and 4b respectively).
5\. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 notify their users of the cancellation of the user
regrouping in steps 5a and 5b respectively.
6\. MCPTT clients 2 and 3 may send the preconfigured regroup cancel response
to the MCPTT server to acknowledge the cancellation of the regrouping
function. These acknowledgements are not sent in response to a multicast
transmission of the preconfigured regroup cancel request.
7\. The MCPTT server de-affiliates MCPTT clients 2 and 3 from the MCPTT
regroup group.
8\. The MCPTT server sends a preconfigured regroup cancel response to MCPTT
client 1.
##### 10.6.2.12.3 User regroup MCPTT ID list update
Figure 10.6.2.12.3-1 illustrates the procedure to add or remove an MCPTT user
based on the MCPTT user criteria known at the MC service server.
NOTE 1: This procedure applies to MCPTT users that have been added and are to
be added to the preconfigured regroup group based on MCPTT user criteria known
at the MCPTT server. If only the criteria are to be applied, then only the
criteria are included in the request and both the group and user lists are not
included
Preconditions:
\- A preconfigured regroup group has been established.
\- The MCPTT server has selected MCPTT user 2 to participate in the
preconfigured regroup group based on MCPTT user criteria known at the MCPTT
server.
NOTE 2: Other participants of the preconfigured regroup group are not shown in

### 10.6.3 Off-network group call
#### 10.6.3.1 General
When an MCPTT user using a ProSe-enabled UE wants to communicate with a
specific MCPTT group using ProSe capabilities, the MCPTT client enables the
use of the ProSe layer procedures for public safety, as specified in 3GPP TS
23.303 [7].
The MCPTT client obtains configuration data such as the user info ID of the
calling MCPTT user and the ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2
Group ID associated to the target MCPTT group (as described in clause 8.1.3.2
in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]), and provides it to the ProSe layer. The ProSe Layer-2
Group ID of the target MCPTT group may be used by the ProSe layer as the
target group info and the discovery group ID (defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).
Prior to the establishment of an off-network group call, a group member
discovery procedure may be initiated to identify whether other members of the
target MCPTT group are in the proximity of the calling MCPTT user, as
described in the ProSe direct discovery for public safety use procedure in
3GPP TS 23.303 [7]. The establishment of an off-network group call using the
ProSe capability is based on the one-to-many ProSe direct communication
procedure for public safety use described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].
Off-network group calls can use pre-defined configuration information provided
to MCPTT clients prior to the off-network group call or configuration
information that is transmitted to MCPTT clients during group call setup or
late entry procedures.
If off-network group configuration information is pre-defined (e.g. codec to
be used) and provided to the MCPTT clients prior to the off-network group call
(e.g. as part of group metadata), the MCPTT client will be able to participate
in the off-network group call without needing to follow the group call setup
or late joining procedures as they will be able to receive the media and
signalling without the need for the announcement or invitation.
If off-network group configuration information is not pre-defined or provided,
call parameters need to be transmitted to MCPTT clients via group call
announcement or invitation.
NOTE: When the MCPTT client receives a message that is not addressed to either
its MCPTT ID or to any MCPTT group of which the MCPTT client is an affiliated
group member, the MCPTT client ignores the message.

#### 10.6.3.3 Group call setup
The flow in figure 10 6.3.3-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for
MCPTT group call establishment for off-network. The procedure describes how an
MCPTT client initiates an MCPTT group call with other MCPTT client within the
off-network radio coverage and how the group call is established.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that information for ProSe direct communications
corresponding to the mappings of MCPTT group ID and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
(see subclause 8.1.3.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]) are pre-configured;
\- It is assumed that a multicast IP address and port for the call setup
signalling are pre-configured;
\- All messages exchanged between the MCPTT clients for the MCPTT group
follows ProSe direct communications as defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]; and
\- The MCPTT users of MCPTT client 1, 2 and 3 belong to the same MCPTT group.
Figure 10.6.3.3-1: Off-network group call setup
1\. MCPTT client 1 as the group call originator sends group call announcement
message to the group. This message contains the following parameters such as
MCPTT group ID, group call originator identity, media type, media codec,
multicast port number for media, port number for floor control protocol,
period of group call announcement, and any encryption key for the media
encryption if needed, and optionally confirm mode indication.
NOTE 1: The group call announcement includes at least one common set of
parameters and values for media transfer. Additional values per parameter will
not be prohibited for the better user experience.
NOTE 2: By using the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID mapping with the MCPTT group ID,
ProSe layer ensures that the messages sent for the corresponding MCPTT group
are only received by its group\'s members.
2\. MCPTT client 2, 3 join the group call. The MCPTT clients configure the
parameters for media delivery by making use of the received parameters in
group call announcement.
3\. MCPTT client 2, 3 may send the response message to the group when the
group call announcement from originator includes confirm mode indication. This
message contains MCPTT ID.
4\. MCPTT client 2, 3 recognize the group call originator through the group
call announcement and MCPTT client 1 checks the participants of the group call
through the received response message.
NOTE 3: Due to the movement of the participants (in and out of the radio
coverage) during the off-network group call, the group call announcement
message including parameters for media delivery is periodically sent.
NOTE 4: The participating MCPTT clients do not need to respond to the periodic
group call announcement.
#### 10.6.3.4 Passive join to group call
Figure 10 6.3.4-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for the passive
MCPTT client to join the on-going MCPTT group call. The passive MCPTT client
does not initiate to establish an MCPTT group call, but receives the group
call announcement to be transferred periodically. When receiving the
announcement message with parameters for media transfer, the passive MCPTT
client configures the parameter to receive the voice and joins the announced
MCPTT group call.
This procedure happens after the MCPTT group call is established. The group
call announcement including the parameters for the media transfer has been
performed periodically, in order for the MCPTT client later to join the MCPTT
group call.
The MCPTT client 4 enters the coverage of the MCPTT group call lately.
Figure 10.6.3.4-1: Passive join to group call
1\. MCPTT client 2 sends the group call announcement message. This message
contains parameters such as MCPTT group ID, group call originator identity,
media type, media codec, multicast port number for media, port number for
floor control protocol, any encryption key for the media encryption if needed,
and optionally confirm mode indication.
NOTE 1: The group call announcement includes at least one common set of
parameters and values for media transfer. Additional values per parameter will
not be prohibited for the better user experience.
2\. MCPTT client 4 configures the parameters for media transfer by making use
of the received parameters in group call announcement.
3\. MCPTT client 4 may send the response message to the group when the
periodic group call announcement includes confirm mode indication. This
message contains the MCPTT ID.
4\. MCPTT client 1, 2, 3 check through the received response message that the
MCPTT client 4 joins the group call. The MCPTT client 2, as the floor control
arbitrator, may send a floor taken message.
NOTE 2: Due to the movement of the participants (in and out of the radio
coverage) during the off-network group call, the group call announcement
message including parameters for media delivery is periodically sent.
NOTE 3: The participating MCPTT clients do not need to respond to the periodic
group call announcement.
#### 10.6.3.5 Join to ongoing group call when new entry member initiates the
call with on-going group call id
Figure 10 6.3.5-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for an MCPTT client
to join an on-going MCPTT group call. When entering the coverage of on-going
group call, new MCPTT client may send group call setup announcement message
with on-going group call id. Upon receiving the group call setup announcement,
the MCPTT client as a participant of on-going MCPTT group call sends
parameters for media transfer to the newly entered MCPTT client (entrant) to
join the on-going MCPTT group call. When receiving the parameters for media
transfer of on-going MCPTT group call, the MCPTT client configures the
parameters to receive the voice and becomes the participant of the on-going
MCPTT group call.
Figure 10.6.3.5-1: Late entry join when receiving MCPTT group call
announcement with on-going MCPTT group ID
1\. MCPTT client 4 enters the coverage of the on-going MCPTT group call.
2\. The new entry of MCPTT client 4 sends group call setup announcement with
MCPTT group call id.
3\. MCPTT client 1 as a participant of on-going MCPTT group call acknowledges
that on-going MCPTT group call exists with MCPTT group call id sent by MCPTT
client 4 and sends parameters for media transfer to MCPTT client 4.
4\. MCPTT client 4 may send a response message.
5\. MCPTT client 4 sets the parameters for media delivery in the on-going
MCPTT group call.
MCPTT client 4 joins and becomes participants of the on-going MCPTT group
call.
#### 10.6.3.6 Immediate group call announcement to join an ongoing group call
Figure 10.6.3.6-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for an MCPTT client
to immediately join an on-going MCPTT group call. Upon the detection of a new
entrant, the MCPTT client that is the current talker (floor arbitrator)
immediately sends the group call announcement. When receiving the group call
announcement message with parameters for media transfer, that MCPTT client
configures the parameters to receive the voice and joins the on-going MCPTT
group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. There is on-going group call. MCPTT client 1 is the current talker and
therefore the floor arbitrator.
Figure 10.6.3.6-1: Immediate group call announcement to join an ongoing group
call
1\. MCPTT client 4 enters the coverage of the on-going MCPTT group call.
2\. The entry of MCPTT client 4 is detected by the current participants.
3\. Since MCPTT client 1 is the current talker (floor arbitrator), MCPTT
client 1 immediately sends the group call announcement with the call
parameters to the group.
4\. MCPTT client 4 may send a response message.
5\. MCPTT client 4 sets the parameters for the group call.
6\. All participants are now considered part of the on-going group call.
#### 10.6.3.7 Group call release due to inactivity
If the on-going MCPTT group call is inactive for a specific duration, the
participating MCPTT clients release the MCPTT group call by themselves.
NOTE: Inactivity time can be set according to the policy of MCPTT service
provider.
#### 10.6.3.8 Broadcast group call
Group call on group-broadcast group and user-broadcast group are handled
without distinction in off-network.
Figure 10 6.3.8.1-1 illustrates the control plane procedures for broadcast
group call in off-network.
Figure 10.6.3.8.1-1: Broadcast group call in off-network
1\. An authorized MCPTT client 1 initiates broadcast group call setup as
described in subclause 10.6.3.3. The group call announcement message includes
the indication of broadcast group call.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 initiating broadcast group call starts to transmit
media.
NOTE: Other clients of group member are not allowed to transmit media in
broadcast group call.
3\. The broadcast group call is released as described in subclause 10.6.3.7.
#### 10.6.3.9 Emergency and imminent peril procedures
##### 10.6.3.9.1 Emergency group call
The off-network emergency group call is a special case of off-network (non-
emergency) group call as defined in subclauses 10.6.3.2, 10.6.3.3, 10.6.3.4,
10.6.3.5, 10.6.3.6 and 10.6.3.7. The following are modifications to the
aforementioned subclauses to support MCPTT emergency group calls:
\- As a pre-condition, the client initiating the emergency call has previously
been provisioned with an MCPTT group designated as the MCPTT emergency group.
The MCPTT client initiates MCPTT emergency group calls on this group.
Alternatively, the MCPTT client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the selected MCPTT group.
\- The group call announcement contains an indication that the MCPTT group
call is to be an MCPTT emergency call regardless of whether or not the MCPTT
client is in call. Group call participants learn of the MCPTT group\'s in-
progress emergency state from the indication.
\- Every call initiated by the MCPTT client will be an emergency call while
the MCPTT client is in MCPTT emergency state.
\- The MCPTT client enters the MCPTT emergency state when initiating an MCPTT
emergency call or MCPTT emergency alert. Only the MCPTT user of the MCPTT
client can clear the client\'s local MCPTT emergency state.
\- The MCPTT group in-progress emergency state is cancelled when the call
ends.
\- The MCPTT user who initiated an emergency call, or upgraded a group call to
an emergency call, or an authorized user, may cancel the in-progress emergency
state with an MCPTT emergency group state cancel message. The message is sent
to the call participants.
\- When the MCPTT group is no longer in the in-progress emergency state, every
client returns its default value of ProSe Per Packet Priority.
\- An MCPTT group call in-progress is upgraded to an emergency group call when
the periodic group call announcement contains the emergency indicator.
\- The value of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to emergency
state of MCPTT group call.
\- An MCPTT group call becoming an emergency group call does not affect the
state of other MCPTT call(s) in the client.
\- The MCPTT group remains in the in-progress emergency state until the
emergency group call ends or the in-progress emergency state is cancelled.
##### 10.6.3.9.2 MCPTT imminent peril
The off-network imminent peril group call is a special case of off-network
(non-imminent peril) group call as defined in subclauses 10.6.3.2, 10.6.3.3,
10.6.3.4, 10.6.3.5, 10.6.3.6 and 10.6.3.7. The following are modifications to
the aforementioned subclauses to support MCPTT imminent peril calls:
\- As a pre-condition, the user initiating the imminent peril call has
previously an MCPTT group to be used as the MCPTT imminent peril group. The
MCPTT client initiates MCPTT imminent peril group calls on this group.
\- The group call announcement contains an indication that the MCPTT group
call is to be an MCPTT imminent peril call. Group call participants learn of
the MCPTT group in-progress imminent peril condition from the indication.
\- The MCPTT group in-progress imminent peril state is considered cancelled
when the call ends.
\- The originating MCPTT user of the in-progress imminent peril or an
authorized user may cancel the in-progress imminent peril state with an MCPTT
imminent peril group cancel. The message is sent to the call participants.
\- When the MCPTT in-progress imminent peril is no longer in the in-progress
imminent peril state, every MCPTT client returns its bearer to the priority it
had prior to the in-progress imminent peril state.
\- An MCPTT upgrade to imminent peril call is used to upgrade an MCPTT group
call already in progress. The message is sent to all call participants so that
they are aware of the in-progress imminent peril.
\- The bearer is upgraded by all participants for the MCPTT group call already
in progress when the MCPTT group call is upgraded to in-progress imminent
peril state.
\- An MCPTT imminent peril call puts the MCPTT group into the in-progress
imminent peril state.
##### 10.6.3.9.3 MCPTT emergency alert (off-network)
The MCPTT service shall support the procedures and related information flows
as specified in subclauses 10.10.2 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] with the following
clarifications:
> \- The MC service client is the MCPTT client;
>
> \- The MC service server is the MCPTT server;
>
> \- The MC service group ID is the MCPTT Group ID; and
>
> \- The MC service user profile index is the MCPTT user profile index.

#### 10.7.2.2 Private call within one MCPTT system
##### 10.7.2.2.1 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call for communicating with another MCPTT user, with or without floor
control enabled, in an automatic commencement mode.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.2.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating establishment of MCPTT private call
with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected automatic commencement mode for the
call; or
2\. The called MCPTT client is set to automatic commencement mode.
3\. Optionally, MCPTT client 1 may use an activated functional alias for the
call.
4\. The MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling
server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation
updates.
Figure 10.7.2.2.1-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode-- MCPTT
users in the same MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are already registered
for receiving MCPTT service, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
2\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call for
the chosen MCPTT user. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may include a
functional alias used within the MCPTT private call. For a private call with
floor control, floor control is to be established.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server (via SIP core) using a service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228
[5] for MCPTT, for establishing a private call with the chosen MCPTT user. The
MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT ID or the functional alias of
the invited user, an SDP offer containing one or more media types. For a
private call with floor control, the MCPTT private call request also contains
an element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is requesting the floor. The
MCPTT client 1 may include a Requested commencement mode that indicates that
the call is to be established in automatic commencement mode if automatic
commencement mode is requested by the initiating user.
NOTE 1: As part of this step, MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 set up a
security association (when no functional alias is present), if end-to-end
encryption is used for this call.
4\. If the MCPTT private call request contains a functional alias instead of
an MCPTT ID as called party, the MCPTT server shall resolve the functional
alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID(s) for which the functional alias is
active. The MCPTT server shall also check whether MCPTT client 1 is allowed to
use the functional alias of MCPTT client 2 to setup a private call and whether
MCPTT client 2 is allowed to receive a private call from MCPTT client 1 using
the functional alias. If authorized, proceed with step 5. Otherwise, the MCPTT
server checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to
initiate the private call, and that MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 is authorized
to receive the private call. If the MCPTT private call request requested
automatic commencement mode then the MCPTT server also checks whether the
MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a private call in
automatic commencement mode and proceed with step 6.
NOTE 2: Depending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call
restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the
resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of
the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias
used as the target of the private call request is simultaneously active for
multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by selecting an
appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria (e.g. current location
of the initiating user to determine the dispatcher who is responsible for the
related geographic area). The selection of an appropriate MCPTT ID is left to
implementation. This selection criteria can include rejection of the call, if
no suitable MCPTT ID is selected.
5a. The MCPTT server responds with a functional alias resolution response
message that contains the resolved MCPTT ID back to MCPTT client 1.
5b. If the MCPTT server replies with a MCPTT functional alias resolution
response message, the MCPTT client 1 abandons the first MCPTT private call
request in step 3 and sends a new MCPTT private call request towards the
resolved MCPTT ID.
NOTE 3: MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 set up a security association for
the media, if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.
6\. MCPTT server may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE 4: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 5b, and prior to step 10.
7\. If authorized, MCPTT server includes information that it communicates
using MCPTT service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request, includes the requested
automatic commencement mode indication based on a requested automatic
commencement mode by the calling user or based upon the setting of the called
MCPTT client and sends the corresponding MCPTT private call request towards
the MCPTT client 2, including the MCPTT ID and, if available, the functional
alias of the calling MCPTT user 1. If the called MCPTT user has registered to
the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has designated the MCPTT UE for
receiving the private calls, then the incoming MCPTT private call request is
delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE.
8\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private
call and displays the functional alias of calling MCPTT user 1.
9\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and
an MCPTT private call response is sent to the MCPTT server (via SIP core).
10\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call response from MCPTT client 2
accepting the private call request, the MCPTT server informs the MCPTT client
1 about successful call establishment.
11\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 have successfully established media
plane for communication and either user can transmit media. For successful
call establishment for private call with floor control request from MCPTT
client 1, floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted floor by the floor
control server, giving it permission to transmit. At the same time floor
participant at MCPTT client 2 is informed by the floor control server that
floor is taken.
##### 10.7.2.2.2 Private call setup in manual commencement mode
###### 10.7.2.2.2.1 Description
Figure 10.7.2.2.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCPTT client
initiating an MCPTT private call that uses manual commencement mode. The flow
may use a floor request in the MCPTT private call request indicating that the
originator will be given the floor when the call starts and eliminates the
need for a separate initial floor request message during media plane
establishment. Alternatively the call initiation may be sent without the floor
request, which allows the called party to request the floor first.
###### 10.7.2.2.2.2 Procedure
Both clients are served by the primary MCPTT service provider in figure
10.7.2.2.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected manual commencement mode or has not
specified a commencement mode for the call; and
2\. The called MCPTT client is set to manual commencement mode.
3\. Optionally, MCPTT client 1 may use an activated functional alias for the
call.
4\. The MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling
server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation
updates.
Figure 10.7.2.2.2.2-1: MCPTT private call in manual commencement mode-- MCPTT
users in the same MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are both registered and their respective
users, MCPTT user 1 and MCPTT user 2, are authenticated and authorized to use
the MCPTT service, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
2\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call
for the selected MCPTT user. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may include a
functional alias used within the MCPTT private call. For a private call with
floor control, floor control is to be established. For private call without
floor control, both users will have the ability to transmit without floor
arbitration.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request addressed to the MCPTT
ID of MCPTT user 2 using an MCPTT service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS
23.228 [5] (possible for the SIP core to route the request to the MCPTT
server). The MCPTT private call request contains the MCPTT ID or the
functional alias of invited user and an SDP offer containing one or more media
types. The MCPTT private call request may also contain a data element that
indicates that MCPTT client 1 is requesting the floor, for a private call with
floor control. The MCPTT client 1 may include a requested commencement mode
that indicates that the call is to be established in manual commencement mode
if manual commencement mode is requested by the initiating user.
NOTE 1: As part of this step, MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 set up a
security association (when no functional alias is present), if end-to-end
encryption is used for this call.
4\. The MCPTT server confirms that both MCPTT users are authorized for the
private call. MCPTT server verifies whether the provided functional alias, if
present, can be used and has been activated for the user. The MCPTT server
shall resolve the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID(s) for which
the functional alias is active. The MCPTT server shall also check whether
MCPTT client 1 is allowed to use the functional alias of MCPTT client 2 to
setup a private call and whether MCPTT client 2 is allowed to receive a
private call from MCPTT client 1 using the functional alias. The MCPTT server
checks the commencement mode setting of the called MCPTT client and also
checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a
call in manual commencement mode.
NOTE 2: Depending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call
restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the
resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of
the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias
used as the target of the private call request is simultaneously active for
multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by selecting an
appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria (e.g. current location
of the initiating user to determine the dispatcher who is responsible for the
related geographic area). The selection of an appropriate MCPTT ID is left to
implementation. This selection criteria can include rejection of the call, if
no suitable MCPTT ID is selected.
5a. If the MCPTT private call request contains a functional alias instead of
an MCPTT ID as called party, the MCPTT server responds with a functional alias
resolution response message that contains the resolved MCPTT ID back to MCPTT
client 1.
5b. If the MCPTT server replies with a MCPTT functional alias resolution
response message, the MCPTT client 1 abandons the first MCPTT private call
request in step 3 and sends a new MCPTT private call request towards the
resolved MCPTT ID.
NOTE 3: MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 set up a security association for
the media, if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.
6\. The MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using MCPTT
service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types contained
in the initial received request and sends an MCPTT private call request for
the call to MCPTT client 2, including the MCPTT ID and, if available, the
functional alias of the calling MCPTT user 1. If the called MCPTT user has
registered to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has designated the
MCPTT UE for receiving the private calls, then the incoming MCPTT private call
request is delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE.
7\. MCPTT server may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE 4: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 5b, and prior to step 8b.
8a. The MCPTT user is alerted and may display the functional alias of calling
MCPTT user 1. MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT ringing to the MCPTT server.
8b. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT ringing to MCPTT client 1, indicating that
MCPTT client 2 is being alerted.
9\. MCPTT user 2 has accepted the call using manual commencement mode (i.e.,
has taken some action to accept via the user interface) which causes MCPTT
client 2 to send an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server. If MCPTT
user 2 has not accepted the incoming call, the MCPTT client 2 sends a call
failure response to the MCPTT server without adding reason for call failure.
10\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call response to MCPTT client 1
indicating that MCPTT user 2 has accepted the call, including the accepted
media parameters.
11\. The media plane for communication is established. Either user can
transmit media individually when using floor control. For successful call
establishment for private call with floor request from MCPTT client 1, the
floor participant associated with MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor
initially. At the same time the floor participant associated with MCPTT client
2 is informed that the floor is taken. The meaning of the floor request (give
floor initially to originator [client 1], or give floor initially to target
[client 2]) may be configurable. For a private call without floor control both
users are allowed to transmit simultaneously.
##### 10.7.2.2.3 Private call release
###### 10.7.2.2.3.1 Client initiated
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT client is requesting to
release an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor control) and the
call established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or
automatic).
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.2.3.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT client initiating the release of an ongoing MCPTT
private call.
Figure 10.7.2.2.3.1-1: Private call release -- client initiated
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCPTT service and are involved in private
call with or without floor control established either in manual or automatic
commencement mode, as described in subclause 10.7.2.2.1 and subclause
10.7.2.2.2.
2\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to release an ongoing MCPTT private call
with MCPTT client 2.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call end request towards the MCPTT
server (via SIP core), for tearing down the private call with the other
client.
4\. MCPTT server sends the corresponding MCPTT private call end request
towards the MCPTT client specified in the original MCPTT private call end
request.
5\. MCPTT user is notified about the release of the private call.
6\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 acknowledges the MCPTT private call end
request with an MCPTT private call end response.
7\. After receiving the MCPTT private call end response from MCPTT client 2,
the MCPTT server generates an acknowledgement for the MCPTT client 1\'s MCPTT
private call end request.
8\. MCPTT clients release all the media plane resources used for the private
call. Further, if the private call was established with floor control, floor
control resources are released and MCPTT clients cannot make further requests
for floor control or send media.
###### 10.7.2.2.3.2 Server initiated
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT server is terminating an
ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor control) and the call
established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or automatic),
upon conditions to terminate call e.g., MCPTT administrator configured maximum
duration for MCPTT private calls has expired or timed out due to MCPTT private
call without transmission/reception.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.2.3.2-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCPTT server initiating termination of an ongoing MCPTT
private call.
Figure 10.7.2.2.3.2-1: End private call -- server initiated
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCPTT service and are involved in private
call with or without floor control established either in manual or automatic
commencement mode.
2\. Upon conditions to terminate call e.g., MCPTT administrator configured
maximum duration for MCPTT private calls has expired or timed out due to MCPTT
private call without transmission/reception, the MCPTT server decides to
initiate termination of an ongoing MCPTT private call between MCPTT client 1
and MCPTT client 2.
3\. MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call end request towards the MCPTT
clients 1 and 2 (via SIP core), for tearing down the private call between
them.
4\. MCPTT users at client 1 and client 2 are notified about the termination of
the private call.
5\. The MCPTT private call end request receiving MCPTT clients 1 and 2
acknowledge the request with an MCPTT private call end response.
6\. MCPTT clients release all the media plane resources used for the private
call. Further, if the private call was established with floor control, floor
control resources are released and MCPTT clients cannot make further requests
for floor control or send media.
#### 10.7.2.3 Private call within several MCPTT systems
##### 10.7.2.3.1 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode -- MCPTT
users in multiple MCPTT systems
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call (automatic commencement mode) for communicating with MCPTT user
in another MCPTT system with or without floor control enabled.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.3.1-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT client
initiating establishment of MCPTT private call with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected automatic commencement mode for the
call; or
2\. The called MCPTT client is set to automatic commencement mode.
Figure 10.7.2.3.1-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode \--
users in multiple MCPTT systems
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCPTT service to their respective MCPTT
service provider, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
2\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call
for the chosen MCPTT user. For a private call with floor control, floor
control is to be established.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the home MCPTT
server 1 (via SIP core) using a service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS
23.228 [5] for MCPTT, for establishing private call with the MCPTT client 2
registered at MCPTT service provider 2. The MCPTT private call request
contains the MCPTT id of invited user and an SDP offer containing one or more
media types. For a private call with floor control, the MCPTT private call
request also contains an element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is
requesting the floor. If the private call request request the floor it may
include location information. The MCPTT client 1 may include a requested
commencement mode that indicates that the call is to be established in
automatic commencement mode if automatic commencement mode is requested by the
initiating user.
4\. MCPTT server 1 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is
authorized to initiate the private call. If the MCPTT private call request
requested automatic commencement mode then the MCPTT server 1 also checks
whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a call in
automatic commencement mode.
5\. MCPTT server 1 may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE: Step 5 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 11.
6\. If authorized, MCPTT server 1 includes information that it communicates
using MCPTT service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request, includes an automatic
commencement mode indication if automatic commencement mode was requested by
and authorised for the calling user and sends the corresponding MCPTT private
call request towards the MCPTT system (via SIP core) of the MCPTT client
specified in the original MCPTT private call request (MCPTT client 2) i.e.,
MCPTT server 2. If location information was included in the private call
request, the MCPTT server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to
decide if the location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to the
other user on the call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location
information to other MCPTT users on a call when talking\").
7\. MCPTT server 2 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 is
authorized to receive a private call.
8\. MCPTT server 2 includes information that it communicates using MCPTT
service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types contained
in the initial received request, includes a requested automatic commencement
mode indication based on a requested automatic commencement mode by the
calling user or based upon the setting of the called MCPTT client and sends
the received MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT client specified in
the received MCPTT private call request (i.e., MCPTT client 2). If the called
MCPTT user has registered to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has
designated the MCPTT UE for receiving the private calls, then the incoming
MCPTT private call request is delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE.
9\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the user about the incoming private
call.
10\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and
an acknowledgement is sent to the MCPTT server 1 (via SIP core and MCPTT
server 2).
11\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call response from MCPTT client 2
accepting the private call request, MCPTT client 1 is informed about
successful call establishment.
12\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 have successfully established media
plane for communication and either user can transmit media. For successful
call establishment of a private call with implicit floor control request from
MCPTT client 1, floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted floor by the
floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1, giving it permission to
transmit. At the same time floor participant at MCPTT client 2 is informed by
the floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1 that the floor is taken.
##### 10.7.2.3.2 Private call setup in manual commencement mode -- MCPTT users
in multiple MCPTT systems
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call (manual commencement mode) for communicating with MCPTT user in
another MCPTT system with or without floor control enabled.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.3.2-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT client
initiating establishment of MCPTT private call with the selected MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected manual commencement mode or has not
specified a commencement mode for the call; and
2\. The called MCPTT client is set to manual commencement mode.
Figure 10.7.2.3.2-1: Private call setup in manual commencement mode -- users
in multiple MCPTT systems
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are
already registered for receiving MCPTT service to their respective MCPTT
service provider, as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
2\. MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an MCPTT private call
for the selected MCPTT user. For a private call with floor control, floor
control is to be established.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the home MCPTT
server 1 (via SIP core), for establishing private call with the MCPTT client 2
registered at MCPTT service provider 2. For a private call with floor control,
the MCPTT private call request contains an element that indicates that MCPTT
client 1 is requesting the floor. If the call request requests the floor the
call request may include location information. The MCPTT client 1 may include
a requested commencement mode that indicates that the call is to be
established in manual commencement mode if manual commencement mode is
requested by the initiating user.
4\. MCPTT server 1 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is
authorized to initiate the private call. The MCPTT server 1 also checks
whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a call in
manual commencement mode.
5\. If authorized, MCPTT server 1 sends the corresponding MCPTT private call
request towards the MCPTT system (via SIP core) of the MCPTT client specified
in the original MCPTT private call request (MCPTT client 2) i.e., MCPTT server
2. If location information was included in the private call request, the MCPTT
server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location
information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to the other user on the call
(refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other
MCPTT users on a call when talking\").
6\. MCPTT server may provide a progress indication to MCPTT client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4, and prior to step 10.
7\. The MCPTT server 2 checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 is
authorized to receive a private call and also checks the commencement mode
setting of MCPTT client 2.
8\. The MCPTT server 2 offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request and sends an MCPTT private
call request towards the MCPTT client specified in the received MCPTT private
call request (i.e., MCPTT client 2). If the called MCPTT user has registered
to the MCPTT service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has designated the MCPTT UE
for receiving the private calls, then the incoming MCPTT private call request
is delivered only to the designated MCPTT UE.
9\. The MCPTT user is alerted. MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT ringing to the
MCPTT server 1 (via server 2).
10\. The MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT ringing to MCPTT client 1, indicating
that MCPTT client 2 is being alerted.
11\. MCPTT user 2 has accepted the call using manual commencement mode (i.e.
has taken some action to accept via the user interface) which causes MCPTT
client 2 to send an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server 1 (via SIP
core and MCPTT server 2)
12\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call response from MCPTT client 2
accepting the private call request, MCPTT client 1 is informed about
successful call establishment.
13\. MCPTT client 1 and client 2 have successfully established media plane for
communication and either user can transmit media. For successful call
establishment of a private call with implicit floor control request from MCPTT
client 1, floor participant at MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor by the
floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1, giving it permission to
transmit. At the same time floor participant at MCPTT client 2 is informed by
the floor control server at MCPTT service provider 1 that the floor is taken.
##### 10.7.2.3.3 Private call release -- MCPTT users in multiple MCPTT systems
The procedure in this subclause is for the case where an MCPTT client is
requesting to release an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor
control) established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or
automatic), and the MCPTT users are in multiple MCPTT systems.
Procedures are similar to those described for private call release when MCPTT
users are in single MCPTT system as in subclause 10.7.2.2.3.1, with the
addition that the MCPTT call end request and the corresponding acknowledgement
are routed through the MCPTT server in partner MCPTT system.
#### 10.7.2.4 MCPTT emergency private call
##### 10.7.2.4.1 MCPTT emergency private call commencement
This procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCPTT user is
initiating an MCPTT emergency private call with unicast signalling for
communicating with another MCPTT user. An MCPTT client in the MCPTT emergency
state gains elevated access privilege for all of the MCPTT user\'s mission
critical applications.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.4.1-1 are the procedures for the MCPTT client
initiating establishment of an MCPTT emergency private call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Both members of the MCPTT private call belong to the same MCPTT system.
2\. The initiating MCPTT client 1 has been configured to send an MCPTT
emergency alert prior to initiating an MCPTT emergency private call.
3\. Optionally, MCPTT client 1 may use an activated functional alias for the
call.
4\. The MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias controlling
server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-activation
updates.
Figure 10.7.2.4.1-1 MCPTT emergency private call
1\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency private call.
MCPTT client 1 sets its MCPTT emergency state. MCPTT client 1 retains the
MCPTT emergency state until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCPTT client
1.
NOTE 1: While MCPTT client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCPTT group and
private calls initiated by MCPTT client 1 are initiated as MCPTT emergency
calls.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT emergency private call request towards the
MCPTT server. The request contains an indication of the MCPTT emergency. MCPTT
user at MCPTT client 1 may select a functional alias as calling party address
and the MCPTT server verifies whether the provided functional alias can be
used. Instead of an MCPTT ID the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 may also select
a functional alias as called party address, which the MCPTT server replaces by
an appropriate MCPTT ID. The MCPTT server records the identity of the MCPTT
user that initiated the MCPTT emergency private call until the MCPTT emergency
is cancelled. If the MCPTT client is configured to send an MCPTT emergency
alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency private call, the request also
contains an indication that an MCPTT emergency alert is to be initiated.
NOTE 2: If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias used as the
target of the private call request is simultaneously active for multiple MCPTT
users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by selecting an appropriate MCPTT ID
based on some selection criteria. This selection of an appropriate MCPTT ID is
left to implementation.
3\. MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency private call request towards the
target MCPTT client. The request contains an indication of the in-progress
emergency. The request contains an indication of an MCPTT emergency alert if
the request from the originator indicated MCPTT emergency alert.
4\. The MCPTT user on MCPTT client 2 is notified of the incoming MCPTT
emergency private call and may display the functional alias of MCPTT client 1.
NOTE 3: MCPTT client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of
receiving the MCPTT emergency private call.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client acknowledges the MCPTT emergency private call
request to the MCPTT server.
6\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer.
7\. The MCPTT server informs MCPTT client 1 about the successful MCPTT
emergency private call establishment.
8\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 establish the media plane for
communication. The MCPTT client 1 can override MCPTT client 2 unless MCPTT
client 2 is also in the MCPTT emergency state.
NOTE 4: The priority for the MCPTT emergency private call is retained until
cancelled according to system policy (e.g. timeout or call end) or cancelled
by an authorized MCPTT user.
NOTE 5: The initiating MCPTT user\'s MCPTT emergency state is retained by the
system until cancelled as in subclause 10.6.2.6.1.3, or by the emergency alert
cancellation procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.
The initiating MCPTT user\'s MCPTT emergency state is also retained locally by
the MCPTT client until explicitly cancelled by the MCPTT user.
##### 10.7.2.4.2 MCPTT private call emergency upgrade
This procedure describes the case where an authorized MCPTT user is upgrading
a private call to an MCPTT emergency private call while the private call is
already in progress.
Procedures in figure 10.7.2.4.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the MCPTT
client upgrading a private call to an MCPTT emergency private call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Both members of the private call belong to the same MCPTT system.
2\. A private call is already in progress.
Figure 10.7.2.4.2-1: MCPTT private call upgrade
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates an emergency. MCPTT client 1
sets its MCPTT emergency state. MCPTT client 1 retains the MCPTT emergency
state until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCPTT client 1.
NOTE 1: While MCPTT client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCPTT group and
private calls initiated by MCPTT client 1 are initiated as MCPTT emergency
calls.
2\. MCPTT client 1 requests the MCPTT server to upgrade the private call to
in-progress emergency by sending an MCPTT emergency request. If configured to
send an MCPTT alert when initiating an MCPTT emergency upgrade, the request
also contains an indication that an MCPTT alert is to be initiated. The
request may contain an indication of an implicit floor request. If the
emergency private call request includes an implicit floor reques it may also
include location information.
3\. The MCPTT server sends the MCPTT emergency request towards MCPTT client 2,
the MCPTT client of the other participant. If location information was
included in the emergency private call request, the MCPTT server checks the
privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the location information of
MCPTT client 1 can be provided to the other user on the call (refer to Annex
A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to other MCPTT users on a
call when talking\").
4\. The MCPTT user of MCPTT client 2 is notified of the in-progress emergency
of the MCPTT emergency private call.
NOTE 2: MCPTT client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of
receiving the MCPTT emergency private call upgrade.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client acknowledges the MCPTT emergency request to the
MCPTT server.
6\. The MCPTT server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for both
participants in the private call. The priority is retained until the call
ends.
7\. The MCPTT server confirms the upgrade request to MCPTT client 1.
8\. MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 continue with the private call, which
has been transformed into an MCPTT emergency private call. MCPTT client 1 can
override MCPTT client 2 unless MCPTT client 2 is also in the MCPTT emergency
state.

#### 10.7.3.2 Use of ProSe capability for private call
When an MCPTT user using a ProSe-enabled UE wants to communicate with a
specific MCPTT user using a ProSe-enabled UE by a ProSe mechanism, the MCPTT
client enables the use of the ProSe layer procedures for public safety, as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].
The MCPTT client obtains configuration data such as the ProSe discovery group
ID and user info ID of the target MCPTT user from the \"List of user(s) who
can be called in private call\" in the MCPTT user profile and requests the IP
address of the MCPTT UE associated with the target MCPTT user from the ProSe
layer.
The MCPTT client enables the ProSe layer to determine the IP address for the
communication with the target MCPTT UE by providing the ProSe discovery group
ID and user info ID (as defined in specification 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) of the
target MCPTT user. This may trigger the ProSe direct discovery for public
safety use procedure, described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7], to identify whether the
target MCPTT user is in the proximity of the calling MCPTT user. The user info
ID of the target MCPTT user is used by the ProSe layer as the target info (as
defined in specification 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).
The ProSe layer can then provide the IP address related to the target MCPTT
user\'s MCPTT ID to the MCPTT client. The establishment of the off-network
private call using the ProSe capability is based on the one-to-one ProSe
direct communication procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].
NOTE: The ProSe procedures for one-to-one direct communications specified in
3GPP TS 23.303 [7] retrieves a layer-2 ID associated with the user info ID of
the target MCPTT user by the discovery procedure to establish direct
communications between ProSe users.
#### 10.7.3.3 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call for communicating with another MCPTT user when off-network using
an automatic commencement mode.
Procedures in figure 10.7.3.3-1 are the basic signalling procedures for the
MCPTT client initiating establishment of an off-network MCPTT private call
with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT user profile used for off-network operation mode is pre-provisioned
in the MCPTT UEs.
Figure 10.7.3.3-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate a private call to
the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 sends a call setup request towards the MCPTT client 2.
The call setup request contains an SDP offer, an automatic commencement mode
indication, and an element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is requesting
the floor. If the private call request requests the floor it may include
location information.
3\. The MCPTT client 2 notifies the MCPTT user about the incoming private
call.
4\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and a
call setup response indicating the successful call establishment is sent to
MCPTT client 1. If MCPTT client 2 rejected the incoming call, the MCPTT client
2 sends a call setup response indicating the failure reason to the MCPTT
client 1.
NOTE: Step 4 can also occur prior to step 3.
5\. The MCPTT client 1 and the MCPTT client 2 have successfully established
the media plane for communication with floor control and the MCPTT client 1 is
automatically granted the floor.
#### 10.7.3.4 Private call setup in manual commencement mode
The procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT user is initiating an MCPTT
private call for communicating with another MCPTT user when off-network using
a manual commencement mode.
Procedures in figure 10.7.3.4-1 are the basic signalling procedures for the
MCPTT client initiating establishment of an off-network MCPTT private call
with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:

call to the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 sends a call setup request towards the MCPTT client 2.
The MCPTT private call setup request contains an SDP offer, a manual
commencement mode indication, and an element that indicates that MCPTT client
1 is requesting the floor. If the private call request requests the floor it
may include location information.
3\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the MCPTT user about the incoming
private call.
4\. The MCPTT client 2 sends MCPTT ringing message to the MCPTT client 1.
NOTE: Step 4 can also occur prior to step 3.
5\. The MCPTT user at the MCPTT client 2 has accepted the call using manual
commencement mode (i.e., has taken some action to accept via the user
interface). The MCPTT user may also reject or fail to answer the incoming
call.
6\. The MCPTT client 2 sends a call setup response indicating the successful
call establishment to MCPTT client 1. If the MCPTT client 2 rejected the call
or the MCPTT user 2 rejected or failed to answer the incoming call, the MCPTT
client 2 sends a call setup response indicating the failure reason to the
MCPTT client 1.
7\. The MCPTT client 1 and the MCPTT client 2 have successfully established
the media plane for communication with floor control and the MCPTT client 1 is
automatically granted the floor.
#### 10.7.3.5 Private call release

plane resources.
#### 10.7.3.6 MCPTT emergency private call
The off-network emergency private call is a special case of off-network
private call as defined in subclause 10.7.3. The following are modifications
to the aforementioned subclause to support MCPTT private calls:
\- The call setup contains an indication that the MCPTT private call is to be
an MCPTT emergency private call,
\- the bearers of both MCPTT private call participants are given MCPTT
emergency priority prior to media transfer,
\- either participant in an MCPTT private call may upgrade the call to the
MCPTT emergency state during the call by sending an MCPTT upgrade private
emergency request,
\- placing an MCPTT emergency private call places the MCPTT client in the
MCPTT emergency state,
\- the bearer priority of each participant is restored to the priority as it
was prior to the MCPTT emergency private call initiation, when the call ends
or when the MCPTT emergency priority is cancelled
\- an authorized user or the originator of the call may cancel the MCPTT
emergency priority of the call by sending an MCPTT cancel private emergency
request and
\- the MCPTT emergency priority of the MCPTT private call may be cancelled

#### 10.7.4.2 MCPTT private call call‑back request within one MCPTT system
The MCPTT private call call‑back request procedure includes the initial MCPTT
private call call‑back request from the MCPTT user and the indication to the
receiving MCPTT user of the who called, the time when the call request was
made, and the urgency indication.
Procedures in figure 10.7.4.2-1 show the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT client initiating an MCPTT private call call‑back request with
the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
\- MCPTT user 1 is the current user at MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT user 2 is the
current user at MCPTT client 2;
\- MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 are registered for MCPTT service.

same MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT private call call‑back
request to the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 2.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call call‑back request towards the
MCPTT server.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user 1 at MCPTT client 1 is
authorized to initiate the MCPTT private call call‑back request.
4\. If authorized, MCPTT server sends the corresponding MCPTT private call
call‑back request towards the MCPTT client 2.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 stores the MCPTT user who initiated the MCPTT
private call call‑back request, the time the MCPTT private call call‑back
request was received, and the urgency indication for the MCPTT private call
call-back request.
6\. The MCPTT client 2 notifies the MCPTT user 2 that there is an MCPTT
private call call-back request awaiting his attention.
7\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT private call call‑back
response to the MCPTT server.
8\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call call-back response from MCPTT client
2, the MCPTT server informs the MCPTT client 1 about successful call-back
request.
#### 10.7.4.3 MCPTT private call call‑back cancel request within one MCPTT
system
Once an MCPTT private call call‑back request has been successfully made and
before the receiving MCPTT user has made an MCPTT private call to the calling
MCPTT user, the calling MCPTT user may cancel the outstanding MCPTT private
call request.
Procedures in figure 10.7.4.3-1 show the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT client initiating an MCPTT private call call-back cancel request
with the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A previously successfully made MCPTT private call call‑back request from
MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client 2.
Figure 10.7.4.3-1: MCPTT private call call‑back cancel request -- MCPTT users
in the same MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 wants to cancel a previously created MCPTT
private call call‑back request to the MCPTT user 2 of MCPTT client 2.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call call‑back cancel request
towards the MCPTT server.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user 1 at MCPTT client 1 is
authorized to cancel the previous MCPTT private call call‑back request, if one
exists.
4\. If authorized, MCPTT server sends the corresponding MCPTT private call
call‑back cancel request towards the MCPTT client 2.
5\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 removes all stored information about the
previous MCPTT private call call‑back request from the MCPTT user 1 on MCPTT
client 1.
6\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT private call call‑back cancel
response to the MCPTT server.
7\. Upon receiving the MCPTT private call call‑back cancel response from MCPTT
client 2, the MCPTT server informs the MCPTT client 1 about successful
call‑back request cancelation.
#### 10.7.4.4 MCPTT private call call‑back request fulfillment within one
MCPTT system
Once an MCPTT private call call‑back request has been successfully made, it is
expected that the receiving MCPTT user will make an MCPTT private call to the
MCPTT user who sent the MCPTT private call call‑back request. The procedures
for establishing the MCPTT private call between the two users is the same as
an MCPTT private call (10.7.2.2.2).
Procedures in figure 10.7.4.4-1 show the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT client returning an MCPTT private call to the MCPTT user who
initiated the MCPTT private call call‑back request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A previously successfully made MCPTT private call call‑back request from
MCPTT client 1 to MCPTT client 2.
Figure 10.7.4.4-1: MCPTT private call‑back request fulfillment -- MCPTT users
in the same MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT user 2 on MCPTT client 2 decides to initiate an MCPTT private call
based on the stored MCPTT private call call‑back request to the MCPTT user 1
on MCPTT client 1 using the MCPTT private call procedures of 10.7.2.2.2.
2\. Once a successful MCPTT private call has been made between the MCPTT user
1 on MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT user 2, then the MCPTT client 2 removes the
stored call‑back request information.
### 10.7.5 MCPTT call forwarding for private calls
#### 10.7.5.1 General
Call forwarding of MCPTT private calls allows users to configure forwarding of
incoming private calls (with or without Floor control) to another MCPTT user
depending on the following conditions:
\- Immediate
\- No answer: If the incoming private call is a call with manual commencement
mode and the MCPTT User does not answer within a configured period
The forwarding of an individual call can also be based on manual input of the
called MCPTT user on a per call basis. In this case the MCPTT user responds to
an incoming MCPTT private call by requesting redirection of that MCPTT private
call to another MCPTT user. It can only be invoked before the communication is
established by the served user, which is the period that the served user is
being informed of the communication (during ringing).

subclause 10.1.4.5.
##### 10.7.5.2.2 MCPTT immediate private call forwarding in a single MCPTT
system
Figure 10.7.5.2.2-1 below illustrates the procedure of immediate call
forwarding of MCPTT private calls.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 2 is authorized to use call forwarding and has immediate call
forwarding enabled with the destination MCPTT client 3.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make private calls to client 2.
3\. The redirection counter is below the limit.
4\. MCPTT client 1 has the necessary security information to initiate a
private call with MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 if end2end encryption is
required for the private call.
Figure 10.7.5.2.2-1: Call forwarding immediate for private calls
1\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server.
2\. The MCPTT server detects that MCPTT client 2 has immediate call forwarding
enabled.
3\. The MCPTT server checks that the limit of immediate forwardings is not
reached. The MCPTT server increments the redirection counter for immediate
forwardings. If the target of the MCPTT private call forwarding is a
functional alias instead of an MCPTT ID the MCPTT server resolves the
functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID for which the functional alias
is active.
NOTE 1: Depending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call
restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the
resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of
the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias
used as the target of the MCPTT private call forwarding is simultaneously
active for multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by
selecting an appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria (e.g.
current location of the initiating user to determine the dispatcher who is
responsible for the related geographic area). The selection of an appropriate
MCPTT ID is left to implementation. The selection criteria can include
rejection of the call, if no suitable MCPTT ID is selected.
3a. If the target of the call forwarding is a functional alias that is not
active, or if the target functional is simultaneously active by multiple users
and the outcome of the selection is a rejection, the MCPTT private call
forwarding is cancelled, and the MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call
cancel request towards MCPTT client 1. Otherwise, the procedure continues with
step 4.
3b. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT call private cancel response back to the
MCPTT server, and the procedure ends.
4\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call forwarding request towards
MCPTT client 1.
NOTE 2: The target MCPTT ID is based on the entry in the user profile for call
forwarding immediate.
5\. The user at MCPTT client 1 is notified that a call forwarding is in
process.
6\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT call private forwarding response back to the
MCPTT server.
7\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server that includes a call forwarding indication set to true. MCPTT client 1
and MCPTT client 3 set up a security association if end-to-end encryption is
used for this call.
8\. The MCPTT server verifies that client 1 is authorized to perform the MCPTT
private call as a result of the MCPTT private call forwarding request. The
MCPTT server verifies that the MCPTT private call request contains MCPTT
client 3 that is the authorized target from step 4, and the forwarding
indication is set to true.
9\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call request towards MCPTT client
3.
10\. Optionally the MCPTT server sends an MCPTT progress indication to MCPTT
client 1.
11\. The user at MCPTT client 3 is alerted. MCPTT client 3 sends an MCPTT
ringing to the MCPTT server. This step is not required in case of automatic
commencement mode.
12\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT ringing to MCPTT client 1. This step is
not required in case of automatic commencement mode.
13\. MCPTT client 3 sends an MCPTT private call response to the MCPTT server.
In manual commencement mode this occurs after the user at MCPTT client 3 has
accepted the call.
14\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call response to MCPTT client 1
indicating that MCPTT client 3 has accepted the call.
15\. The media plane for communication between MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client
3 is established.
##### 10.7.5.2.3 MCPTT private call forwarding no answer in a single MCPTT
system
Figure 10.7.5.2.3-1 below illustrates the procedure of call forwarding no
answer of MCPTT private calls.
NOTE 1: The condition no answer covers both the cases in which the user does
not answer because he is not reachable, as well as the case in which he is
reachable but does not answer.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 2 is authorized to use call forwarding and has call
forwarding no answer enabled with the destination MCPTT client 3.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make private calls to MCPTT client 2.
3\. No forwarding with no answer or based on manual user input has so far
occurred in this call.
4\. MCPTT client 1 has the necessary security information to initiate a

required for the private call.
Figure 10.7.5.2.3-1: MCPTT call forwarding no answer
1\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server.
2\. The MCPTT server checks if MCPTT client 2 has call forwarding no answer
enabled. If the MCPTT server detects that MCPTT client 2 is not registered,
the procedure continues with step 7. Otherwise, the MCPTT server starts a
timer with the configured no answer timeout.
3\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call request in manual
commencement mode towards MCPTT client 2. If the MCPTT server detects that
MCPTT client 2 is not reachable, the procedure continues with step 7.

6\. The MCPTT server detects that MCPTT client 2 does not answer within the
specified time interval.
7\. The MCPTT server verifies that no other forwarding with the condition no
answer or based on manual user input has occurred so far. If the target of the
MCPTT private call forwarding is a functional alias instead of an MCPTT ID the
MCPTT server resolves the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID for
which the functional alias is active.
NOTE 2: Depending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call
restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the
resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of
the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias
used as the target of the MCPTT private call forwarding is simultaneously
active for multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by
selecting an appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria (e.g.
current location of the initiating user to determine the dispatcher who is
responsible for the related geographic area). The selection of an appropriate
MCPTT ID is left to implementation. The selection criteria can include
rejection of the call, if no suitable MCPTT ID is selected.
7a. If the target of the call forwarding is a functional alias that is not
active, or if the target functional is simultaneously active by multiple users
and the outcome of the selection is a rejection, the MCPTT private call
forwarding is cancelled, and the MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call
cancel request towards MCPTT client 1. Otherwise, the procedure continues with
step 8.
7b. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT call private cancel response back to the
MCPTT server, and the procedure ends.

used for this call.
12\. The MCPTT server verifies that client 1 is authorized to perform the
MCPTT private call as a result of the MCPTT private call forwarding request.
The MCPTT server verifies that the MCPTT private call request contains MCPTT
client 3 that is the authorized target from step 8, and the forwarding
indication is set to true.
NOTE 4: For call forwarding the MCPTT server does not check if the initial
originating MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make an MCPTT
private call to the final target MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3.
13\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call request towards MCPTT client
3.
14\. Optionally the MCPTT server sends an MCPTT progress indication to MCPTT
client 1.
15\. The user at MCPTT client 3 is alerted. MCPTT client 3 sends an MCPTT
ringing to the MCPTT server. This step is not required in case of automatic
commencement mode.
16\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT ringing to MCPTT client 1. This step is
not required in case of automatic commencement mode.

server.
8\. The MCPTT server verifies if the user at client 2 is allowed to perform
forwarding based on manual input. If the target of the MCPTT private call
forwarding is a functional alias instead of an MCPTT ID the MCPTT server
resolves the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID for which the
functional alias is active.
NOTE 1: Depending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call
restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the
resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of
the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias

22\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call response to MCPTT client 1
indicating that MCPTT client 3 has accepted the call.
23\. The media plane for communication between MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client
3 is established.
##### 10.7.5.2.4 Handling of multiple MCPTT private call forwardings
If the target of the MCPTT private call forwarding has also any kind of MCPTT
call forwarding activated generally the additional forwardings are performed
sequentially. However, to avoid excessive numbers of forwardings and in
particular to avoid indefinite loops in the forwarding a limit for immediate
forwardings is defined in the service configuration. The MCPTT server keeps
track of the number of forwardings, if the limit is exceeded, the call will be
released. For forwarding no answer or for forwarding based on manual user
input, only one forwarding is allowed, and in case of no answer on the first
forwarding the MCPTT server will release the call.
##### 10.7.5.2.5 MCPTT private call forwarding with target of the MCPTT
private call forwarding in partner MCPTT system
The procedure describes the case for MCPTT for private call forwarding that an
MCPTT user in a partner MCPTT system is the target of the MCPTT private call
forwarding.
NOTE 1: The procedure shows manual commencement mode, but the changes are also
applicable when using automatic commencement mode.
NOTE 2: The procedure focusses on the interaction between the MCPTT servers,
which is independent of the condition of the call forwarding. Therefore, the
procedure is generically applicable for all types of MCPTT private call
forwarding.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 2 is authorized to use call forwarding and has immediate call
forwarding enabled with the destination MCPTT client 3.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make private calls to MCPTT client 2.
3\. The redirection counter is below the limit.
4\. MCPTT client 1 has the necessary security information to initiate a
private call with MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 if end-to-end encryption
is required for the private call.
Figure 10.7.5.2.5-1: Simplified private call setup with MCPTT private calls
forwarding in manual commencement mode with forwarding target in the partner
MCPTT system
1\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards MCPTT server 1.
1a If the MCPTT private call request contains a functional alias instead of an
MCPTT ID as called party, MCPTT server 1 checks whether MCPTT client 1 is
allowed to use the functional alias of MCPTT client 2 to setup a private call
and whether MCPTT client 2 is allowed to receive a private call from MCPTT
client 1 using the functional alias.
NOTE 1: If the target of the MCPTT private call request is a functional alias,
the procedure resolves the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID for
which the functional alias is active. For simplicity details are not described
in this procedure.
2\. MCPTT server 1 detects that MCPTT client 2 has immediate call forwarding
enabled to MCPTT client 3 which is registered in MCPTT system 2.
3\. MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT private call forwarding request towards
MCPTT client 1.
NOTE 2: If the target of the MCPTT private call forwarding is a functional
alias, the procedure resolves the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT
ID for which the functional alias is active. For simplicity details of the
resolution are not described.
4\. The user at MCPTT client 1 is notified that a call forwarding is in
process.
5\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT call private forwarding response back to

originating MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make an MCPTT
private call to the final target MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3.
8\. MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards MCPTT server 2.
9\. MCPTT server 2 sends an MCPTT private call request towards MCPTT client 3.
NOTE 3: MCPTT server 2 detects that the private call request contains a
forwarding indication is set to true and therefore skips the authorization
checking.
10\. Optionally MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT progress indication to MCPTT
client 1.
11\. The user at MCPTT client 3 is alerted. MCPTT client 3 sends an MCPTT
ringing to MCPTT server 2. This step is not required in case of automatic
commencement mode.
12\. MCPTT server 2 sends an MCPTT ringing to MCPTT server 1. This step is not
required in case of automatic commencement mode.
13\. MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT ringing to MCPTT client 1. This step is not

private call forwarding occurring in the partner MCPTT system.
NOTE 1: The procedure shows manual commencement mode, but the changes are also
applicable when using automatic commencement mode.
NOTE 2: The procedure focusses on the interaction between the MCPTT servers,
which is independent of the condition for the call forwarding. Therefore, the
procedure is generically applicable for all types of call forwarding.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 3 is authorized to use call forwarding and has immediate call
forwarding enabled with the destination MCPTT client 2.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make private calls to MCPTT client 3.
3\. The redirection counter is below the limit.
4\. MCPTT client 1 has the necessary security information to initiate a
private call with MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 if end-to-end encryption
is required for the private call.
Figure 10.7.5.2.6-1: Simplified private call setup with MCPTT private calls
forwarding in manual commencement mode with forwarding in the partner MCPTT
systems
1\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards MCPTT server 1
for establishing an MCPTT private call with MCPTT client 3 registered at MCPTT
system 2.
1a If the MCPTT private call request contains a functional alias instead of an
MCPTT ID as called party, MCPTT server 1 checks whether MCPTT client 1 is
allowed to use the functional alias of MCPTT client 3 to setup a private call.
NOTE 1: If the target of the MCPTT private call request is a functional alias,
the procedure resolves the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT ID for
which the functional alias is active. For simplicity details are not
described.
2\. MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards MCPTT server 2
for establishing an MCPTT private call with MCPTT client 3 registered at MCPTT
system 2.
2a If the MCPTT private call request contains a functional alias instead of an
MCPTT ID as called party, MCPTT server 2 checks whether MCPTT client 3 is
allowed to receive a private call from MCPTT client 1 using the functional
alias.
3\. MCPTT server 2 detects that MCPTT client 3 has immediate call forwarding
enabled to MCPTT client 2 registered at MCPTT system 1.
NOTE 2: If the target of the MCPTT private call forwarding is a functional
alias, the procedure resolves the functional alias to the corresponding MCPTT
ID for which the functional alias is active. For simplicity details of the
resolution are not described.
4\. MCPTT server 2 sends an MCPTT private call forwarding request towards
MCPTT server 1.
5\. MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT private call forwarding request towards
MCPTT client 1.
6\. The user at MCPTT client 1 is notified that a call forwarding is in
process.
7\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT call private forwarding response back to
MCPTT server 1.
8\. MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT call private forwarding response back to
MCPTT server 2.
9\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards MCPTT server 1
that includes a call forwarding indication set to true.
10\. MCPTT server 1 verifies that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to perform the
MCPTT private call as a result of the MCPTT private call forwarding request.
MCPTT server 1 verifies that the MCPTT private call request contains MCPTT
client 2 that is the authorized target from step 5, and the forwarding
indication is set to true.
NOTE 3: For call forwarding the MCPTT server does not check if the initial
originating MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make an MCPTT
private call to the final target MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2.
11\. MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards MCPTT client
2.
12\. Optionally MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT progress indication to MCPTT
client 1.
13\. The user at MCPTT client 2 is alerted. MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT
ringing to MCPTT server 1. This step is not required in case of automatic
commencement mode.
14\. MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT ringing to MCPTT client 1. This step is not
required in case of automatic commencement mode.
15\. MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT private call response to MCPTT server 1\.
In manual commencement mode this occurs after the user at MCPTT client 2 has
accepted the call.
16\. MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT private call response to MCPTT client 1
indicating that MCPTT client 2 has accepted the call.
17\. The media plane for communication between MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client

#### 10.7.6.2 Procedures
##### 10.7.6.2.1 MCPTT private call unannounced transfer in a single MCPTT
system
The procedure for MCPTT private call unannounced transfer covers the case
where an MCPTT client requests an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without
floor control) to be transferred to another MCPTT user without prior
announcement.
Figure 10.7.6.2.1-1 below illustrates the procedure for MCPTT private call
unannounced transfer.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 2 is authorized to use call transfer.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make private calls to MCPTT client 2.
3\. MCPTT client 2 is authorized to transfer private calls to MCPTT client 3.
4\. MCPTT client 1 has the necessary security information to initiate a
private call with MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 if end2end encryption is
required for the private call.
Figure 10.7.6.2.1-1: MCPTT private call unannounced transfer
1\. MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT private call to MCPTT client 2 using the
normal MCPTT call establishment as described in subclause 10.7.2.2. The MCPTT
private call is established, and the user at MCPTT client 1 can talk with the
user at MCPTT client 2.
2\. Now the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 decides to perform a call transfer.
3\. The MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT call transfer request to the MCPTT
server.
4\. The MCPTT server verifies that MCPTT client 2 is authorized to transfer
the MCPTT private call to MCPTT client 3. This check is based on entries in
the user profile of the user at MCPTT client 2. First, the MCPTT server checks
the value of the \"Allow private call transfer\" entry. If it is false, the
authorization check has failed, and the procedure continues with step 5.
Otherwise the MCPTT server checks if the \"Authorised to transfer private
calls to any MCPTT user\" entry is true. If this is the case the check has
passed, and for target type of MCPTT ID the procedure continues with step 5
and for target ID type of functional alias the procedure continues with step
4a. The subsequent checking depends on the type of target ID. If the target ID
is a MCPTT ID, the MCPTT server checks for a matching entry of the target
MCPTT ID in the \"List of MCPTT users that the MCPTT user is authorised to use
as targets for call transfer\" list. If a matching entry is found, the check
has passed, if no matching entry is found the check has failed, for any
outcome the procedure continues with step 5. If the target ID is a functional
alias, the MCPTT server checks for a matching entry of the target functional
alias in the \"List of functional aliases that the MCPTT user is authorised to
use as targets for call transfer\" list. If a matching entry is found, the
check has passed, and the procedure continues with step 4a. If no matching
entry is found, the authorization check has failed and the procedure continues
with step 5.
4a. If the target of the MCPTT private call transfer is a functional alias
instead of an MCPTT ID the MCPTT server resolves the functional alias to the
corresponding MCPTT ID for which the functional alias is active.
NOTE 1: Depending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call
restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the
resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of
the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias
used as the target of the MCPTT private call transfer is simultaneously active
for multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by selecting an
appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria (e.g. current location
of the initiating user to determine the dispatcher who is responsible for the
related geographic area). The selection of an appropriate MCPTT ID is left to
implementation. The selection criteria can include rejection of the call, if
no suitable MCPTT ID is selected.
5\. If the authorization check has failed, or the target of the transfer is a
functional alias that is not active, or the target of the transfer is a
functional alias that is simultaneously active by multiple users and the
outcome of the selection is a rejection, the MCPTT private call transfer is
cancelled, and the MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call transfer response
with result \"fail\" back to MCPTT client 2. The MCPTT private call between
MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 remains up, and the procedure stops.
Otherwise, the procedure continues.
6\. MCPTT client 2 initiates release of the private call between MCPTT client
1 and MCPTT client 2 as described in subclause 10.7.2.2.3.1. This step can
occur at any time after step 5, since a new private call between MCPTT client
1 and MCPTT client 3 is independent of the private call between MCPTT client 1
and MCPTT client 2.
7\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT call transfer request towards the MCPTT
client 1.
8\. Optionally the user at MCPTT client 1 is notified that a call transfer is
in progress.
9\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT call transfer response back to the MCPTT
server.
10\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server that includes a call transfer indication set to true.
11\. The MCPTT server verifies that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to perform
the MCPTT private call as a result of the MCPTT private call transfer request
based on the fact that the transfer indication is present and set to true in
the MCPTT private call request.
NOTE 2: For call transfer the MCPTT server does not check if the initial
originating MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make an MCPTT
private call to the final target MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3.
12\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT call request to MCPTT client 3.
13\. The user at MCPTT client 3 is notified about the incoming call.
14\. MCPTT client 3 sends an MCPTT private call response back to the MCPTT
server.
15\. The MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT private call response towards MCPTT
client 1.
16\. The media plane for communication between MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client
3 is established.
##### 10.7.6.2.2 MCPTT private call announced transfer in a single MCPTT
system
The procedure for MCPTT private call announced transfer covers the case where
an MCPTT client requests an ongoing MCPTT private call (with or without floor
control) to be transferred to another MCPTT user with prior announcement.
Figure 10.7.6.2.2-1 below illustrates the procedure for MCPTT private call
announced transfer.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCPTT client 2 is authorized to use call transfer.
2\. MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make private calls to MCPTT client 2.
3\. MCPTT client 2 is authorized to make private calls to MCPTT client 3.
4\. MCPTT client 2 is authorized to transfer private calls to MCPTT client 3.
5\. MCPTT client 2 supports simultaneous sessions for MCPTT private calls
(10.8).
6\. MCPTT client 1 has the necessary security information to initiate a
private call with MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3, and MCPTT client 2 has
the necessary security information to initiate a private call with MCPTT
client 3 if end2end encryption is required for the private call.
Figure 10.7.6.2.2-1: MCPTT private call announced transfer
1\. MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT private call to MCPTT client 2 using the
normal MCPTT call establishment as described in subclause 10.7.2.2. The MCPTT
private call is established, and the user at MCPTT client 1 can talk with the
user at MCPTT client 2. The user at MCPTT client 2 decides to transfer the
call.
2\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 puts the call on hold.
3\. MCPTT client 2 initiates an MCPTT private call to MCPTT client 3 using the
normal MCPTT call establishment procedures as described in subclause 10.7.2.2.
The MCPTT private call is established, and the user at MCPTT client 2 can talk
with the user at MCPTT client 3.
4\. The user at MCPTT client 2 can talk with the user at MCPTT client 3 and
announce the call transfer.
5\. The MCPTT client 2 releases the MCPTT private call with MCPTT client 3
using the normal MCPTT call release procedure as described in subclause
10.7.2.2.3.1. This step can occur at any time after step 4.
6\. Optionally the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 puts the call with MCPTT
client 1 off hold and confirms that the call will be transferred.
7\. The MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT call transfer request to the MCPTT
server.
8\. The MCPTT server verifies that MCPTT client 2 is authorized to transfer
the MCPTT private call to MCPTT client 3. This check is based on entries in
the user profile of the user at MCPTT client 2. First, the MCPTT server checks
the value of the \"Allow private call transfer\" entry. If it is false, the
authorization check has failed, and the procedure continues with step 10.
Otherwise the MCPTT server checks if the \"Authorised to transfer private
calls to any MCPTT user\" entry is true. If this is the case the check has
passed, and for target type of MCPTT ID the procedure continues with step 10
and for target ID type of functional alias the procedure continues with step
9. The subsequent checking depends on the type of target ID. If the target ID
is a MCPTT ID, the MCPTT server checks for a matching entry of the target
MCPTT ID in the \"List of MCPTT users that the MCPTT user is authorised to use
as targets for call transfer\" list. If a matching entry is found, the check
has passed, if no matching entry is found the check has failed, for any
outcome the procedure continues with step 10. If the target ID is a functional
alias, the MCPTT server checks for a matching entry of the target functional
alias in the \"List of functional aliases that the MCPTT user is authorised to
use as targets for call transfer\" list. If a matching entry is found, the
check has passed, and the procedure continues with step 9. If no matching
entry is found, the authorization check has failed and the procedure continues
with step 10.
9\. If the target of the MCPTT private call transfer is a functional alias
instead of an MCPTT ID the MCPTT server resolves the functional alias to the
corresponding MCPTT ID for which the functional alias is active.
NOTE 1: Depending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call
restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the
resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of
the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias

of the initiating user to determine the dispatcher who is responsible for the
related geographic area). The selection of an appropriate MCPTT ID is left to
implementation. The selection criteria can include rejection of the call, if
no suitable MCPTT ID is selected.
10\. If the authorization check has failed, or the target of the transfer is a
functional alias that is not active, or the target of the transfer is a
functional alias that is simultaneously active by multiple users and the
outcome of the selection is a rejection, the MCPTT private call transfer is
cancelled, and the MCPTT server sends an MCPTT private call transfer response
with result \"fail\" back to MCPTT client 2. The MCPTT private call between
MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 remains up, and the procedure stops.
Otherwise, the procedure continues.
11\. MCPTT client 2 initiates release of the private call between MCPTT client
1 and MCPTT client 2 as described in subclause 10.7.2.2.3.1. This step can
occur at any time after step 10, since a new private call between MCPTT client
1 and MCPTT client 3 is independent of the private call between MCPTT client 1
and MCPTT client 2.
12\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT call transfer request towards the MCPTT
client 1.
13\. Optionally the user at MCPTT client 1 is notified that a call transfer is
in progress.
14\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT call transfer response back to the MCPTT
server.
15\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server that includes a call transfer indication set to true.
16\. The MCPTT server verifies that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to perform
the MCPTT private call as a result of the MCPTT private call transfer request
based on the fact that the transfer indication is present and set to true in
the MCPTT private call request.
NOTE 2: For call transfer the MCPTT server does not check if the initial
originating MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make an MCPTT
private call to the final target MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3.
17\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT call request to MCPTT client 3.
18\. The user at MCPTT client 3 is notified about the incoming call.
19\. MCPTT client 3 sends an MCPTT private call response back to the MCPTT
server.
20\. The MCPTT server forwards the MCPTT private call response towards MCPTT
client 1.
21\. The media plane for communication between MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client
3 is established.

Figure 10.7.6.2.3-1 below illustrates the procedure for MCPTT private call
announced transfer with target in partner MCPTT system.
NOTE 1: The procedure for MCPTT private call unannounced transfer is very
similar, the only difference is that steps 2-6 are skipped.

The MCPTT private call is established, and the user at MCPTT client 2 can talk
with the user at MCPTT client 3.
NOTE 2: The procedure for private call using functional alias towards a
partner MC system is defined in clause 10.16.3 in 3GPP TS 23.280[16].
4\. The user at MCPTT client 2 can talk with the user at MCPTT client 3 and
announces the call transfer.

10.7.2.3. This step can occur at any time after step 4.
6\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 puts the call with MCPTT client 1 off
hold and confirms that the call will be transferred.
7\. The MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT call transfer request to the MCPTT
server 1.
8\. The MCPTT server 1 verifies that MCPTT client 2 is authorized to transfer
the MCPTT private call to MCPTT client 3. This check is based on entries in
the user profile of the user at MCPTT client 2. First, the MCPTT server 1
checks the value of the \"Allow private call transfer\" entry. If it is false,
the authorization check has failed, and the procedure continues with step 10.
Otherwise, the MCPTT server 1 checks if the \"Authorised to transfer private

passed, and for target type of MCPTT ID the procedure continues with step 10
and for target ID type of functional alias the procedure continues with step
9. The subsequent checking depends on the type of target ID. If the target ID
is a MCPTT ID, the MCPTT server 1 checks for a matching entry of the target

normal MCPTT call establishment procedures as described in subclause 10.7.2.3.
The MCPTT private call is established, and the user at MCPTT client 3 can talk
with the user at MCPTT client 2.
NOTE 3: The procedure for private call using functional alias towards a
partner MC system is defined in clause 10.16.3 in 3GPP TS 23.280[16].
4\. The user at MCPTT client 3 can talk with the user at MCPTT client 2 and
announce the call transfer.
5\. The MCPTT client 3 releases the MCPTT private call with MCPTT client 2
using the normal MCPTT call release procedure as described in subclause
10.7.2.3. This step can occur at any time after step 4.
6\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 3 puts the call with MCPTT client 1 off
hold and confirms that the call will be transferred.
7\. The MCPTT client 3 sends an MCPTT call transfer request to the MCPTT
server 2.
8\. The MCPTT server 2 verifies that MCPTT client 3 is authorized to transfer
the MCPTT private call to MCPTT client 2. This check is based on entries in
the user profile of the user at MCPTT client 3. First, the MCPTT server 2
checks the value of the \"Allow private call transfer\" entry. If it is false,
the authorization check has failed, and the procedure continues with step 10.
Otherwise, the MCPTT server 2 checks if the \"Authorised to transfer private
calls to any MCPTT user\" entry is true. If this is the case the check has
passed, and for target type of MCPTT ID the procedure continues with step 10
and for target ID type of functional alias the procedure continues with step
9. The subsequent checking depends on the type of target ID. If the target ID
is an MCPTT ID, the MCPTT server 2 checks for a matching entry of the target
MCPTT ID in the \"List of MCPTT users that the MCPTT user is authorised to use
as targets for call transfer\" list. If a matching entry is found, the check
has passed, if no matching entry is found the check has failed, for any
outcome the procedure continues with step 10. If the target ID is a functional
alias, the MCPTT server 2 checks for a matching entry of the target functional
alias in the \"List of functional aliases that the MCPTT user is authorised to
use as targets for call transfer\" list. If a matching entry is found, the
check has passed, and the procedure continues with step 9. If no matching
entry is found, the authorization check has failed and the procedure continues
with step 10.
9\. If the target of the MCPTT private call transfer is a functional alias
instead of an MCPTT ID the MCPTT server 2 resolves the functional alias to the
corresponding MCPTT ID for which the functional alias is active.
NOTE 4: Depending on implementation the MCPTT server can apply additional call
restrictions and decide whether the call is allowed to proceed with the
resolved MCPTT ID(s) (e.g. whether the MCPTT ID is within the allowed area of
the functional alias). If the MCPTT server detects that the functional alias
used as the target of the MCPTT private call transfer is simultaneously active
for multiple MCPTT users, then the MCPTT server can proceed by selecting an
appropriate MCPTT ID based on some selection criteria (e.g. current location
of the initiating user to determine the dispatcher who is responsible for the
related geographic area). The selection of an appropriate MCPTT ID is left to
implementation. The selection criteria can include rejection of the call, if
no suitable MCPTT ID is selected.
10\. If the authorization check has failed, or the target of the transfer is a
functional alias that is not active, or the target of the transfer is a
functional alias that is simultaneously active by multiple users and the
outcome of the selection is a rejection, the MCPTT private call transfer is
cancelled, and the MCPTT server 2 sends an MCPTT private call transfer
response with result \"fail\" back to MCPTT client 3\. The MCPTT private call
between MCPTT client 3 and MCPTT client 2 remains up, and the procedure stops.
Otherwise the procedure continues.
11\. The MCPTT server 2 sends an MCPTT call transfer request towards the MCPTT
server 1.
12\. The MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT call transfer request towards the MCPTT
client 1.
13\. Optionally the user at MCPTT client 1 is notified that a call transfer is
in progress.
14\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT private call request towards the MCPTT
server 1 that includes a call transfer indication set to true.
15\. The MCPTT server 1 verifies that MCPTT client 1 is authorized to perform
the MCPTT private call as a result of the MCPTT private call transfer request
based on the fact that the transfer indication is present and set to true in
the MCPTT private call request.
NOTE 5: For call transfer the MCPTT server does not check if the initial
originating MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to make an MCPTT
private call to the final target MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2.
16\. The MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT private call request to MCPTT client 2.
17\. The user at MCPTT client 2 is notified about the incoming call.
18\. MCPTT client 2 sends an MCPTT private call response back to the MCPTT
server 1.
19\. The MCPTT server 1 forwards the MCPTT private call response towards MCPTT
client 1.
20\. MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT call transfer response back to the MCPTT
server 1.
21\. The MCPTT server 1 sends an MCPTT call transfer response back to the
MCPTT server 2.
22\. The MCPTT server 2 sends an MCPTT call transfer response back to the
MCPTT client 3.
23\. MCPTT client 3 initiates release of the private call between MCPTT client
3 and MCPTT client 1 as described in subclause 10.7.2.3.
24\. The media plane for communication between MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client
2 is established.
## 10.8 Simultaneous session for MCPTT calls (on-network)
### 10.8.1 General
An MCPTT client and MCPTT server may use a simultaneous session as defined in
3GPP TS 23.280 [16] for MCPTT calls. The MCPTT client becomes involved in a
simultaneous session for MCPTT calls by inviting, joining or accepting more
than one MCPTT call, or affiliating to a group.
NOTE: An MCPTT client affiliating to multiple MCPTT groups with active calls
will result in the MCPTT client being invited simultaneously to multiple MCPTT
calls.
The MCPTT client can also still handle multiple MCPTT calls in parallel at the
same time i.e. using multiple dialogs.
The simultaneous session is established during either an originating on-demand
call establishment or during pre-established session establishment or a
modification of an already established pre-established session or on-demand
call.
It is possible to change the prioritisation while the MCPTT client is engaged
in multiple MCPTT calls. The setting of the priority can be made at MCPTT call
setup or by performing a modification after the MCPTT call is established.
This may result in more than one media bearer.
## 10.9 Floor control
### 10.9.1 Floor control for on-network MCPTT service
#### 10.9.1.1 General
The procedure is for providing a floor control to MCPTT UE in an on-network
case and applies for both private call and group call. Floor control is
performed by using floor control information flows between the floor
participant and the floor control server.
#### 10.9.1.2 Information flows for floor control for on-network
##### 10.9.1.2.1 General
When the floor control server receives a floor request from the floor
participant, it decides whether to give a grant or not based on, e.g., the
session status (i.e., whether the grant is given to another user or not), user
profile, priority. The result is informed to the requesting floor participant.
When the floor participant receives a floor granted message, it can send voice
media over the uplink bearer established beforehand. The floor revoked message
can be used as part of override. The floor queue status request can be used to
know current position in the queue for floor.
Some floor control information flows can also piggyback call control
information flows to provide efficient call setup and clearing:
\- Call setup request is optionally carried in floor request (uplink) or floor
taken (downlink, can be broadcast); and
\- Call release request is optionally carried in floor release (uplink) or
floor idle (downlink, can be broadcast).
##### 10.9.1.2.2 Floor request

Figure 10.9.1.3.1-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted for the MCPTT session already established between the floor
participant and the floor control server. Only three UEs involved in the
session are shown for the simplicity.
Pre-condition:
1\. MCPTT session is established between MCPTT clients (client A, client B and
client C) and MCPTT server.
2\. The user at MCPTT client C is an authorized user (e.g., dispatcher)
allowed to remove a floor request of other MCPTT users from the floor queue
and can receive notifications about another user when their floor request is
queued, when their queued floor request is rejected and when their queued
floor request is removed from the queue.

NOTE 2: If the floor participant user B\'s queued floor request is rejected
after de-queue from the floor control queue then the floor control server may
send the queue position info to floor participant C who is an authorized user.
The floor queue position info message should indicate that floor participant
user B\'s queued floor request is no longer queued.
##### 10.9.1.3.1a Floor request, floor granted and multi-talker floor taken
during an MCPTT session enhanced with multi-talker control
Figure 10.9.1.3.1a-1 shows the high level procedure that allows several
participants to talk simultaneously in a MCPTT session already established
between the floor participant and the floor control server. Three UEs involved
in the session are shown for simplicity.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is configured to support multi-talker control and audio
mixing by the network is applied.
2\. MCPTT session is established between MCPTT clients (client A, client B and
client C) and MCPTT server.
3\. Participants and A and B have the permission to talk to all other
participants and the floor is granted to floor participant B.
Figure 10.9.1.3.1a-1: Floor request, floor granted and multi-talker floor
taken during an MCPTT session
1\. Floor participant B is talking and is sending the voice media.
2\. Floor participant A wants to send voice media over the session.
3\. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control
server which includes the necessary information, e.g. floor priority.
4\. Based on applicable criteria (e.g. floor priority, participant type,
allowance to transmit, maximum number of simultaneous talkers) floor control
server determines what action (grant, deny, or queue) shall be applied to the
request. In this case, the floor request from floor participant A will be
accepted. Simultaneous floor requests to transmit are handled in a sequential
order. Based on the group configuration repository data, the floor control
server may limit the time a floor participant is allowed to talk.
5a. Floor control server responds with a floor granted message to floor
participant A.
5b. Floor control server sends a multi-talker floor taken message to floor
participant B.
5c. Floor control server sends a multi-talker floor taken message to floor
participant C.
5d. Floor control server may send a multi-talker floor taken message to floor
participant A.
6a. The floor granted shall cause the user of UE A, where the floor
participant A is located, to be notified.
6b. The multi-talker floor taken shall inform the user of UE B, that the
floors are granted to other floor participants, but the floor is not revoked.
6c. The multi-talker floor taken shall inform the user of UE C floor
participants list the floor are currently granted to.
7\. Floor participant A starts sending voice media over the session
established beforehand, i.e. participants A and B receive and transmit voice
media; participant C only receives voice media.
NOTE: Floor control is independent from whether audio mixing is performed by
the MCPTT server or by the UE.
##### 10.9.1.3.2 Floor override
###### 10.9.1.3.2.1 Floor override using floor revoked (also floor rejected)
during an MCPTT session
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.1-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted for the MCPTT session already established between the floor
participant (with floor granted to floor participant B) and the floor control
server (with an override based on priority). Only two UEs involved in the
session are shown for the simplicity.
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.1-1: Floor override using floor revoked (also floor
rejected) during an MCPTT session
1\. It is assumed that floor participant B has been given floor and is
transmitting voice media.
2\. Floor participant A having a priority which is relatively higher than that
of floor participant B wants to send voice media over the session.
3\. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control
server.
4\. The floor control server determines to accept the floor request from floor
participant A based on arbitration result e.g., according to the priority
information that is received in the floor request message. The floor control
server sends a floor revoked message to floor participant B stopping the voice
media transmission from floor participant B.
5\. The user of floor participant B may be notified that the floor is revoked.
6\. The Floor control server sends a floor granted message to floor
participant A, while sending a floor taken message to floor participant B with
information of who is granted the floor.
7\. The user of floor participant A may be notified that he is granted the
floor. Similarly, the user of floor participant B may be notified who is
granted the floor.
8\. Floor participant A starts sending voice media over the session
established beforehand.
9\. Now floor participant B may want the floor to start sending voice media.
10\. Floor participant B sends a floor request message to floor control server
which may include priority information.
11\. Floor control server determines whether to accept the floor request from
floor participant B based on arbitration result e.g., according to the
priority information that is received in the floor request message.
12\. The floor control server responds with a floor rejected message to floor
participant B.
13\. Floor participant B may be notified that he is rejected.
###### 10.9.1.3.2.2 Floor override without using floor revoked during an MCPTT
session
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.2-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted for the MCPTT session already established between the floor
participants (with floor granted to floor participant B) and the floor control
server (with an override based on priority and configured to permit the
transmission of the overridden floor participant B to continue). Only two UEs
involved in the session are shown for the simplicity.
Pre-conditions
\- The floor control server has been configured to support override.
\- The override supported in this case permits both the overridden floor
participant and the overriding floor participant to be transmitting.
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.2-1: Floor override (overridden continues to transmit)
during an MCPTT session
1\. It is assumed that floor participant B has been given the floor and is
transmitting voice media.
2\. Floor participant A having a floor priority which is relatively higher
than that of floor participant B wants to send voice media over the session.
3\. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor control
server.
4\. The floor control server determines to accept the floor request from floor
participant A based on arbitration result e.g., according to the floor
priority information that is received in the floor request message.
5a. Floor control server responds with a floor granted message to floor
participant A.
5b. Floor control server sends a floor taken message to the other floor
participants (including floor participant B). Floor participant B continues
transmitting the (overridden) voice media transmission.
NOTE 1: All other floor participants (not shown) that are part of this group
call receive a floor taken message, so that the other floor participants learn
who the newly granted talker (overriding) is.
6a. The floor granted causes the user of floor participant A to be notified.
6b. The user of floor participant B is notified of the status that the floor
is now taken by floor participant A.
7\. Floor participant A (overriding) starts sending voice media over the
session established beforehand.
NOTE 2: Floor participant B is still sending voice (overridden). The list of
floor participants that receive the overriding, overridden, or both
transmissions is based on configuration.
##### 10.9.1.3.2.3 Floor override using floor revoked (also floor rejected)
during an MCPTT session enhanced with multi-talker control {#floor-override-
using-floor-revoked-also-floor-rejected-during-an-mcptt-session-enhanced-with-
multi-talker-control .H6}
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.3-1 shows the high-level procedure that the floor control
allows several participants to talk simultaneously in a MCPTT session already
established between the floor participant (with floor granted to floor
participant B) and the floor control server. Only two UEs involved in the
session are shown for the simplicity.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is configured to support multi-talker control.
2\. MCPTT session is established between MCPTT clients (client A, client B and
client C) and MCPTT server.
3\. The maximum number of simultaneous talkers is set to 2.
4\. The floor priority of floor participant A is higher than of floor
participant B.
5\. The floor is granted to floor participant B and floor participant C.
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.3-1: Floor override using floor revoked (also floor
rejected) during an MCPTT session
1\. Floor participant B and floor participant C are sending voice media over
the session established.
2\. Floor participant A wants to send voice media over the session.
3\. Floor participant A wants to talk (i.e. send voice media) over the
session. Floor participant A sends a floor request message to the floor
control server.
4\. Based on an arbitration result (e.g. per the priority information that is
received in the floor request message), the floor control server determines to
accept the floor request from floor participant A. The maximum number of
simultaneous talkers in the MCPTT group has been reached, the floor control
server decides to apply the override mechanism.
5\. The floor control server sends a floor revoked message to floor
participant B stopping the voice media transmission of floor participant B.
6\. The user of floor participant B may be notified that the floor is revoked.
7\. The Floor control server sends a floor granted message to floor
participant A, while sending a multi-talker floor taken message to floor
participant B and floor participant C including the information to whom the
floor has been granted.
8\. The user of floor participant A may be notified that the floor has been
granted to him. Similarly, the user of floor participant B and floor
participant C may be notified to whom the floor has been granted.
9\. Floor participant A starts sending voice media over the session
established beforehand.
10\. Now floor participant B may want the floor to start sending voice media.
11\. Floor participant B sends a floor request message to floor control server
that may include participant priority information.
12\. Based on arbitration result, e.g. per the priority information that is
received in the floor request message, and if the number of MCPTT Users has
already reached the maximum number of simultaneous talkers in the group, the
floor control server determines whether to accept or reject the floor request
from floor participant B. Due to lower priority of participant B and the
applicable limitation of simultaneous talkers, the floor control server
rejects the floor request.
13\. The floor control server responds with a floor rejected message to floor
participant B.
14\. Floor participant B may be notified about the floor rejection.
NOTE: Floor control procedure is independent from whether audio mixing is
performed by the MCPTT server or by the UE.
##### 10.9.1.3.2.4 Floor release during an MCPTT session enhanced with multi-
talker control {#floor-release-during-an-mcptt-session-enhanced-with-multi-
talker-control .H6}
Figure 10.9.1.3.2.4-1 shows the high-level procedure where the floor
controller allows a participant to release the floor while other participants
continue to talk simultaneously in a MCPTT session already established between
the floor participants and the floor control server. Only three UEs involved
in the session are shown for simplicity.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is configured to support multi-talker control and audio
mixing by the network is applied.
2\. MCPTT session is established between MCPTT clients (client A, client B,
and client C) and the MCPTT server.
3\. Participants A, B, and C have the permission to talk to all other
participants, and the floor is granted to floor participants A, B, and C.

1\. Floor participants A, B and C are sending voice media over the established
session.
2\. User A stops talking and wants to stop sending voice media over the
session.
3\. Floor participant A sends a floor release message to the floor control
server.
4\. The floor control server accepts the floor release from floor participant
A and sends a multi-talker floor release message to floor participant B and
floor participant C.
4a. The users of floor participant B and floor participant C may be notified
that floor participant A has released the floor.
5\. Floor participants B and C continue sending voice media over the
established session.
NOTE: Floor control procedures are independent from whether audio mixing is
performed by the MCPTT server or by the UE.
##### 10.9.1.3.3 Queue position during an MCPTT session
Figure 10.9.1.3.3-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted for the MCPTT session already established between MCPTT clients
(with floor granted to floor participant B) and server (with an override based
on priority at floor control server). Only two UEs involved in the session are
shown for the simplicity.
Figure 10.9.1.3.3-1: Queue status during an MCPTT session
1\. It is assumed that floor participant B has been given a floor granted and
is transmitting voice media. There are several other floor participants
(including floor participating A) requesting floor which get queued at the
floor control server.
2\. Floor participant A would like to know its current position in the floor
request queue.
3\. Floor participant A sends a queue position request message to the floor
control server.
4\. Floor control server determines the current queue position of floor
participant A from the floor request queue.
5\. Floor control server responds with the current position in queue position
info message.
6\. User at floor participant A is informed about the current queue position.
##### 10.9.1.3.4 Floor request cancellation from the floor request queue
###### 10.9.1.3.4.1 Floor request cancellation from the queue -- MCPTT user
initiated
Figure 10.9.1.3.4.1-1 illustrates the procedure for floor request cancellation
from the floor queue initiated by the MCPTT user. The MCPTT user may be an
authorized user who has rights to cancel the floor requests of other MCPTT
users, whose floor requests are in floor control queue.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that floor participant B has been granted the floor and is
transmitting voice media. There are several other floor participants
(including floor participant A and floor participant C) requesting the floor
which have been queued at the floor control server.
Figure 10.9.1.3.4.1-1: Floor request cancellation from queue initiated by
MCPTT user
1\. The floor participant A wants to remove the floor request from the floor
request queue. If floor participant A is an authorized MCPTT user with the
rights to cancel another MCPTT user\'s floor request, the authorized MCPTT
user may request floor request cancellation for one or more floor
participants, whose floor request needs to be removed from the floor queue.
2\. The floor participant A sends a floor request cancel (initiating MCPTT ID)
message to the floor control server. If the floor participant A wants to
remove the floor request(s) of other participant(s), the target
participant(s)\' MCPTT ID should be included in this message.
3\. The floor control server shall check whether the requesting floor
participant has authorization to cancel the floor request(s). If authorized,
the floor request(s) will be removed from the floor request queue. When
current transmission is completed, floor control server will process the floor
request from the updated floor request queue.
4\. If the floor request cancel in step 2 is sent by an authorized user (e.g.,
dispatcher) to cancel the floor request(s) of other participant(s) from the
floor request queue, the floor request cancel notify message is sent to the
floor participant whose floor request was cancelled from the floor queue. The
floor request cancel notify message is also sent to the authorized user (not
shown in figure) if the floor request cancel in step 2 is sent by the floor
participant A is an initiating MCPTT user.
5\. The floor control server provides a floor request cancel response to the
floor participant A when the floor cancellation is completed. Optionally, the
new queue position information may be notified to the floor participants whose
floor requests are in the floor request queue (not shown in the figure).
###### 10.9.1.3.4.2 Floor request cancellation from the queue - floor control
server initiated
Figure 10.9.1.3.4.2-1 illustrates the procedure for floor request cancellation
from the queue initiated by the floor control server. Only three UEs involved
in the session are shown for the simplicity.
Pre-conditions:
\- MCPTT session is established between MCPTT clients (client A, client B,
client C and client D) and MCPTT server.
\- It is assumed that floor participant B (not shown in figure) has been
granted the floor and is transmitting voice media. There are several other
floor participants (including floor participant A and participant C)
requesting the floor which have been queued at the floor control server.
\- The user at MCPTT client D is an authorized user (e.g., dispatcher) allowed
to remove a floor request of other MCPTT users from the floor queue and can
receive notifications about another user when their floor request is queued,
when their queued floor request is rejected and when their queued floor
request is removed from the queue.
Figure 10.9.1.3.4.2-1: Floor request cancellation from queue initiated by
floor control server
1\. The floor control server removes the floor request from the floor request
queue based on policy. e.g., expiration of a timer. In the case when floor
control server receives repeated floor requests from a floor participant while
the floor is occupied, the new floor request is accepted and added into the
floor queue and the existing/former floor request is removed from the floor
queue or the new floor request is rejected and the existing/former floor
request of this floor participant is retained in the floor request queue.
2\. The floor control server sends a floor request cancel notify to the floor
participant(s) whose floor request is removed from the floor request queue.
3\. Optionally, the newly queue position information is notified to the other
floor participants whose floor requests are queued.
4\. If the floor request cancel in step 2 is sent by floor control server for
the user whose floor request is in the floor request queue, the floor control
server may send the floor cancel notify to the floor participant D who is an
authorized user.
##### 10.9.1.3.5 Floor idle during an MCPTT session
During silence (when no talk burst is ongoing), the floor control server may
send floor idle message to all floor participants from time to time.
Figure 10.9.1.3.5-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor idle is
conducted for the MCPTT session already established between the floor
participant and the floor control server. Only three MCPTT UEs involved in the
session are shown for the simplicity.
Pre-condition:
1\. The floor control is established between the floor participants and floor
control server.
2\. The floor participant A is granted the floor.
Figure 10.9.1.3.5.1-1: Floor idle during an MCPTT session
1\. User A stops talking and wants to stop sending voice media over the
session. The floor participants A sends the floor release message to the floor
control server.
2\. The floor control server sends the floor idle message to the participants
due to e.g., all the floor requests are processed and no new floor request is
received..
3\. Floor participants may notify the MCPTT user about the floor is idle.
NOTE: Floor idle may be sent multiple times during the MCPTT session.
#### 10.9.1.4 Floor control involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems
##### 10.9.1.4.1 Partner MCPTT system routes all floor control messages to
primary MCPTT system\'s floor control server
The MCPTT users belonging to different groups in multiple MCPTT systems will
participate in MCPTT media services (group communication, private calls, etc.)
in scenarios like group hierarchies and temporary groups formed by group
regroup. In this service delivery model involving multiple groups from
different MCPTT systems, the floor control arbitration resides with the
primary MCPTT system. This is determined in the group call setup stage. The
MCPTT users of groups involved in the call session will transmit their floor
control messages through the partner MCPTT systems to which they belong. In
this scenario, the partner MCPTT systems request the floor control for its
MCPTT user(s) from the floor control server of the primary MCPTT system. The
protocol used for media plane signalling is non-SIP like RTCP.
Figure 10.9.1.4.1-1 describes the procedure for floor control involving groups
from multiple MCPTT systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share all information of their users\' to the primary MCPTT system (public
information would still need to be shared).
2\. The group 1 is hosted by primary MCPTT system and group 2 and 3 are hosted
by the partner MCPTT system.
3\. The floor participant 1 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 1. The
floor participant 2 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 2. The floor
participant 3 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 3. The floor control
server 1 belongs to primary MCPTT system. The floor control server 2 belongs
to partner MCPTT system.
4\. The floor control server 1 is the floor arbitrator of the MCPTT group
call. The floor control server 2 routes all floor control messages to and from
the floor participants 2 and 3 and then floor control server 1.
Figure 10.9.1.4.1-1: Floor control (partner MCPTT system forwarding) involving
groups from multiple MCPTT systems
1\. An MCPTT group call involving group1, group 2 and group 3 is setup and
active.
2\. The MCPTT users want to talk.
3\. The floor participants initiate a floor request to the floor control
server of their corresponding MCPTT systems. (The requests may or may not
occur at the same time).
4\. If only one floor request is received, or floor control server 2 handles
the floor request sequentially, there is no arbitration performed and the
corresponding floor request is forwarded to the floor control server 1. If the
floor control server 2 receives multiple floor requests at the same time or
during an interval, then it forwards the floor requests to the floor control
server 1 (floor arbitrator for the MCPTT group call). As the floor participant
information shall not be exposed, the floor priority related information
or/and group information to be used by floor control server 1 should be
included in the forwarded request.
5\. The floor control server 1 performs floor arbitration for the MCPTT group
call and determines the floor request to be accepted.
6\. If the floor request from floor participant 2 of the partner MCPTT system
is accepted, a floor granted is sent with permission to talk. The floor
control messages from floor control server 1 are routed to floor participant 2
via the floor control server 2.
7\. When the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the floor granted, the
floor control server 2 sends a floor granted message on to floor participant
2.
8\. The floor granted shall cause the user of the UE where the floor
participant 2 is located to be notified.
9\. The primary floor control server 1 may (9a.1) send a floor rejected
message, or (9b.1) send a queue position info message for each non-granted
received floor requests forwarded from the floor control server 2 (partner).
When the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the floor rejected message,
then the floor control server 2 (partner) (9a.2) sends a floor rejected
message to the appropriate floor participant. When the floor control server 2
(partner) receives the queue position info, then the floor control server 2
(partner) (9b.2) sends a queue position info message to the appropriate floor
participant.
10a.1 If floor control server 1 rejects the floor request from floor
participant 1, then a floor reject message is sent.
10a.2 Upon this being received the user of the UE where floor participant 1 is
located may be notified.
10b.1 If floor control server 1 supports floor queue, queue position info
message is sent to the floor participant 1.
10b.2 Upon this being received the user of the UE where floor participant 1 is
located may be notified.
NOTE 1: Steps 10a.1 through 10.b2 are optional as indicated by the dashed box
enclosing them. However, if this box is implemented then either information
flow 10a or 10b would occur.
NOTE 2: Optionally, the authorized user (e.g., dispatcher) receiving
notifications about another user when their floor request is queued, when
their queued floor request is rejected and when their queued floor request is
removed from the queue is not shown here for the sake of brevity.
11\. Since the floor is granted to floor participant 2 of the partner MCPTT
system, then a floor taken is sent to all other floor participants ((11a)
floor participant 1 and (11b.1) to floor control server 2 (partner) for
forwarding to (11b.2) floor participant 3.
12\. The receipt of the floor taken may be used to inform the users of the UEs
where the floor participant entity 1 and floor participant 3 are located to be
notified.
13\. Upon successful floor granted, the group call media transmission occurs.
NOTE 3: The media flow between the media gateways of primary and partner MCPTT
systems have not been depicted in the figure for clarity.
##### 10.9.1.4.2 Partner MCPTT system performs filtering of floor control
messages entering and leaving the partner MCPTT system
The MCPTT users belonging to different groups in multiple MCPTT systems will
participate in MCPTT media services (group communication, private calls, etc.)
in scenarios like group hierarchies and temporary groups formed by group
regroup. In this service delivery model involving multiple groups from
different MCPTT systems, the floor control arbitration resides with the
primary MCPTT system. This is determined in the group call setup stage. The
MCPTT users of groups involved in the call session will transmit their floor
control messages through the partner MCPTT systems to which they belong. In
this scenario, the partner MCPTT system filters its MCPTT users\' floor
requests before communicating with the floor control server of the primary
MCPTT system. The protocol used for media plane signalling is non-SIP like
RTCP.
Figure 10.9.1.4.2-1 describes the procedure for floor control involving groups
from multiple MCPTT systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MCPTT systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MCPTT system does not
share all information of their users to the primary MCPTT system (public
information would still need to be shared).
2\. The group 1 is hosted by primary MCPTT system and group 2 and 3 are hosted
by the partner MCPTT system.
3\. The floor participant 1 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 1. The
floor participant 2 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 2. The floor
participant 3 corresponds to the MCPTT user of group 3. The floor control
server 1 belongs to primary MCPTT system. The floor control server 2 belongs
to partner MCPTT system.
4\. The floor control server 1 is the floor arbitrator of the MCPTT group
call. The floor control server 2 does floor control filtering with its floor
participants 2 and 3 before communicating with the floor control server 1.
Figure 10.9.1.4.2-1: Floor control (filtering by partner MCPTT system)
involving groups from multiple MCPTT systems
1\. An MCPTT group call involving group 1, group 2 and group 3 is setup and
active.
2\. The MCPTT users want to talk
3\. The floor participants initiate a floor request to the floor control
server of their corresponding MCPTT systems. (The requests may or may not
occur at the same time).
4\. Floor control server 2 receives a floor request from floor participant 2
and from participant 3 at the same time or during an interval, then the floor
control server 2 (partner) performs filtering of the floor requests received
according to its local policy such as priority or order based on its own
users, and forwards the selected floor request (floor participant 2) to the
floor control server 1 (floor arbitrator for the MCPTT group call). As the
floor participant information shall not be exposed, the priority related
information or/and group information to be used by floor control server 1
should be included in the forwarded request.
5\. The floor control server 2 (partner) may send a floor rejected towards the
floor participant 3, since its floor request was not chosen to be forwarded on
to the floor control server 1.
6\. The user on the UE where the floor participant 3 is located may be
notified of the rejection.
NOTE 1: Steps 5 and 6 can occur any time between step 4 and step 16.
7\. The floor control server 2 (partner) forwards the floor request of floor
participant 2 to the floor server 1.
8\. The floor control server 1 performs floor arbitration for the MCPTT group
call and determines the floor request to be accepted. The floor request
message from floor participant 2 of the partner system is accepted by the
floor control server 1 (arbitrator) and is determined that a floor granted is
sent with permission to talk.
9\. The floor granted message from floor control server 1 is routed to floor
participant 2 via the floor control server 2 (partner).
10\. Since floor participant 1 sent a floor request but was not granted,
10a.1 the primary floor control server may send a floor rejected message to
floor participant 1.
10a.2 The user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be
notified of the rejection.
10b.1 if floor control server supports floor queuing, send a queue position
info message to floor participant 1.
10b.2 The user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be
notified of the queue position.
NOTE 2: Steps 10a.1 through 10.b2 are optional as indicated by the dashed box
enclosing them. However, if this box is implemented then either information
flow 10a or 10b would occur.
NOTE 3: Optionally, the authorized user (e.g., dispatcher) receiving
notifications about another user when their floor request is queued, when
their queued floor request is rejected and when their queued floor request is
removed from the queue is not shown here for the sake of brevity.
11\. A floor taken message is sent to floor participant 1.
12\. The user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be
notified.
NOTE 4: Step 10 through Step 12 can occur any time between step 8 and step 18.
13\. Since the floor control server 2 (partner) filters floor requests, when
the floor control server 2 (partner) receives the floor granted for floor
participant 2 from floor control server 1, the floor control server 2
(partner) needs to use the information received to generate the floor taken
which will be sent to all other floor participants (floor control participant
3).
14\. The floor control server 2 (partner) sends a floor granted message to
floor participant 2.
15\. The user of the UE where the floor participant 2 is located is notified.
16\. The floor control server 2 (partner) sends a floor taken message to all
other floor participants (floor participant 3).
17\. The user of the UE where the floor participant 1 is located may be
notified.
18\. Upon successful floor grant, the group call media transmission occurs.
NOTE 5: The media flow between the media gateways of primary and partner MCPTT
systems have not been depicted in the figure for clarity.
#### 10.9.1.5 Floor control for audio cut-in enabled group
Figure 10.9.1.5-1 shows the procedure for audio cut-in for the session already
established between the floor participants from same MCPTT service provider.
Floor participants may request the floor while Floor Participant B is
transmitting voice media. Floor control server grants floor immediately to the
floor request received.
Editor\'s note: Configuration parameter for queue depth is FFS.
Pre-conditions:
\- The floor control server has been configured to support audio cut-in.
\- It is assumed that the floor has been granted to floor participant B and
floor participant B is transmitting voice media. There are several other floor
participants (including floor participant A).

participant B stopping the voice media transmission from floor participant B.
6\. The user of floor participant B may be notified that the floor is revoked.
7\. The Floor control server sends a floor granted message to floor
participant A, and sends a floor taken message to floor participant B with
information of who is granted the floor. The floor control server may limit
the time a user talks (holds the floor).
8\. The user of floor participant A may be notified that he is granted the
floor. Similarly, the user of floor participant B may be notified who is
granted the floor.
9\. Floor participant A starts sending voice media over the session
established.
10\. Now floor participant B may want the floor to start sending voice media.
11\. Floor participant B sends a floor request message to floor control
server.
12\. The floor control server applies the audio cut-in policy with floor queue
disabled.
13\. The floor control server sends a floor revoked message to floor
participant A stopping the voice media transmission from floor participant A.
14\. The user of floor participant A may be notified that the floor is
revoked.
15\. The Floor control server sends a floor granted message to floor
participant B, and sends a floor taken message to floor participant A with
information of who is granted the floor. The floor control server may limit
the time a user talks (holds the floor).
16\. The user of floor participant B may be notified that he is granted the
floor. Similarly, the user of floor participant A may be notified who is
granted the floor.
17\. Floor participant B starts sending voice media over the session
established.
#### 10.9.1.6 Unicast media stop and resume requests
Figure 10.9.1.6-1 shows the procedure for a floor participant to indicate to
the floor control server that the unicast media flow of an active MCPTT group
call can be stopped.
Pre-condition:
1\. An MCPTT session is established between MCPTT client A and MCPTT server
for an MCPTT group call. Other participants to the call are not shown in the
figure for simplicity.
2\. The floor control is established between the floor participant and the
floor control server.
Figure 10.9.1.6-1: Unicast media stop request during an MCPTT session
1\. Another floor participant has requested and has been granted the floor.
The floor control server sends a floor taken message to floor participant A.
The floor taken message may include an identifier of the associated media
flow.
2\. Floor control server sends the voice media flow to floor participant A
over unicast.
3\. Floor participant A gets the information, e.g. from the user, that media
for the call is not needed.
4\. Floor participant A sends a unicast media stop request to floor control
server, identifying the media flow to be stopped.
5\. Floor control server stops sending that unicast media flow to floor
participant A. Associated bearer resources may be de-allocated by the MCPTT
server.
Figure 10.9.1.6-2 shows the procedure for a floor participant to request from
the floor control server that the unicast media flow of an active MCPTT group
call be restarted.
Pre-condition:
1\. An MCPTT session is established between MCPTT client A and MCPTT server
for an MCPTT group call. Other participants to the call are not shown in the
figure for simplicity
2\. The floor control is established between the floor participant and the
floor control server.

The floor control server sends a floor taken message to floor participant A.
The floor taken message may include an identifier of the associated media
flow.
2\. Floor participant A gets the information, e.g. from the user, that media
for the call is needed again.
3\. Floor participant A sends a unicast media resume request to floor control
server, identifying the media flow to be re-started.
4\. Floor control server starts sending that unicast media flow to floor
participant A. This may need new bearer resources to be allocated.
NOTE 1: The identifier of the flow to be stopped or resumed is known by the
floor participant from the floor control information flows associated with
that MCPTT session.
NOTE 2: Stopping a media flow is not leaving the session and subsequent floor
control messages will still be sent by the floor control server to the floor
participant which has requested a unicast media stop.
NOTE 3: Both requests have no effect on a possible ongoing transmission of the
media flow over MBMS. In particular, they are not interpreted by the MCPTT
server as MBMS listening status reports.
### 10.9.2 Floor control for off-network MCPTT service
#### 10.9.2.1 General
The procedures defined in this subclause provide floor control to MCPTT UEs in
off-network operation. The procedures apply to both private calls and group
calls.
In off-network, floor control is performed by using floor control messages
among the MCPTT clients without centralized MCPTT server. The MCPTT client can
transmit voice packets once it is granted the right to speak, either locally
in the UE or by reception of a floor granted message from another MCPTT
client.
In off-network, the MCPTT client currently speaking performs the temporary
floor arbitrator during speaking since there is no centralized MCPTT floor
control server. The floor arbitrator controls the floor whether or not queue
is supported, and when floor is requested with override. If queue is
supported, the MCPTT client performing floor arbitrator grants the right to
speak to the next speaker and transfers the floor arbitrator role after
completing the voice transfer and releasing the floor. For group calls, the
floor arbitrator also transfers the floor control queue when granting the
floor. The next MCPTT client receiving the right to speak becomes the new
floor arbitrator and, for group calls, has the floor control queue.
For group calls, the floor control message is delivered in multicast based
communication and can be monitored by all the members within the MCPTT group.
The following information flows apply among MCPTT clients.
\- Floor request (from the floor participants to the floor arbitrator): used
to request a floor for voice transfer.
\- Floor release (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participants): used
to inform that the voice transfer is completed and the floor is released.
\- Floor granted (from the floor arbitrator to a floor participant): used to
indicate that the request for floor is granted, that voice transfer is
possible and the current queue list.
\- Queue position request (from the floor participant to the floor
arbitrator): used to request the position in the floor request queue.
\- Queue position info (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant):
used to indicate the floor request is queued and the current queue status.
\- Floor rejected (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant): used
to indicate that a request for the floor is rejected.
\- Floor taken (from the floor arbitrator to the floor participant): used to
indicate the floor is granted to another MCPTT user.
#### 10.9.2.2 Information flows for floor control for off-network
##### 10.9.2.2.1 General
For floor control for off-network, the information flows defined under
subclause 10.9.1.2 apply unless it is explicitly defined under this subclause.
##### 10.9.2.2.2 Floor granted
Table 10.9.2.2.2-1 describes the information flow floor granted, from the
floor participant to the floor participant, which is used to indicate that a
request for floor is granted and media transfer is possible.
Table 10.9.2.2.2-1: Floor granted
* * *
Information element Status Description MCPTT ID M Requester identity Duration
M The time for which the granted party is allowed to transmit Source
identifier O Identifies the communication, e.g. by identifying the media flow
within a media multiplex, present only in case of media multiplexing
Acknowledgement required O Indicates if acknowledgement from the floor
participant is required
* * *
#### 10.9.2.3 Floor control during silence
##### 10.9.2.3.1 Successful floor taken (No floor contention)
If a floor arbitrator still exists, the expected behaviour for floor requests
during periods of silence is described in subclauses 10.9.2.5 and 10.9.2.6
(with the exception that no media was being generated prior to the floor
request).
If a floor arbitrator does not exist, figure 10.9.2.3.1-1 shows the successful
high level floor control procedure during periods **when there is no
detectable talker**.
NOTE 1: The description also applies to private calls.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group call had been established and all MCPTT clients have
the call parameters. No participant is currently talking and no floor
arbitrator is identified.
Figure 10.9.2.3.1-1: Successful floor taken flow (No floor contention)
1\. The MCPTT client 1 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 does not detect any floor contention. Floor contention
occurs when multiple floor requests may exist simultaneously.
NOTE 2: The mechanism for detecting floor contention is out of scope of the
present document.
3\. The MCPTT client 1 sends the floor taken message to the MCPTT group.
4\. The user gets a notification that the floor request was successful (the
floor has been granted).
5\. The MCPTT client 1 begins voice transmission.
#### 10.9.2.4 Simultaneous floor requests
If a floor arbitrator does not exist, figure 10.9.2.4.1-1 shows the expected
behaviour in case of simultaneous floor requests are generated **when there is
no detectable talker**.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group call is established and all MCPTT clients have the
call parameters. No participant is currently talking and no floor arbitrator
is identified.
2\. MCPTT client 1 has higher priority than MCPTT client 2.
Figure 10.9.2.4.1-1: Simultaneous floor requests
1a. The MCPTT client 1 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
1b. The MCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
NOTE 1: Step 1a and 1b happen in parallel
2\. On receiving a floor request message, while waiting for a response to the
sent floor request message, the MCPTT client compares its floor priority with
the floor priority indicated in the received floor request message.
3\. On determining that it has higher floor priority than the received floor
request message(s), and no response to the sent floor request message is
received, the MCPTT client 1 sends the floor taken message to the MCPTT group.
4\. The user at MCPTT client 1 gets notification that the floor request was
successful (the floor has been granted).
NOTE 2: If the floor priority in the received floor request message is same as
its own floor priority, the MCPTT client can use another scheme to decide who
gets the floor.
#### 10.9.2.5 Floor request during speaking with queue
Figure 10.9.2.5-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among
MCPTT floor participants and while voice media is transmitting. In the case,
MCPTT clients should support queue function. The current speaking MCPTT client
acting as the floor arbitrator put the floor request into the queue list when
receiving the floor request from other MCPTT clients. This procedure happens
while voice media is transmitting. In the flow, MCPTT client 1 transmits the
voice media to the MCPTT group and acts as the floor arbitrator.
NOTE: The description only applies to group calls.
Figure 10.9.2.5-1: Floor request during speaking with queue
1\. MCPTT client 1 is transmitting voice media to the MCPTT group.
2\. MCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
3\. MCPTT client 1 acting as the floor arbitrator put the floor request of
MCPTT client 2 into the queue list.
4\. MCPTT client 1 sends the queue position info message with the queuing
status regarding the floor request of MCPTT client 2 in order to inform the
floor request is queued.
5\. MCPTT client 1 sends the floor granted message to the MCPTT group when
releasing the floor. The message contains the MCPTT ID to be granted to send
the voice media, and queue list, if any. MCPTT client 1 may include the
maximum duration that MCPTT client 2 transmits in the floor granted message.
6\. MCPTT client 2 sends the voice media when receiving the floor granted
message and being granted as next speaker in the floor granted message. In
addition, MCPTT client 2 becomes the floor arbitrator.
#### 10.9.2.6 Floor request during speaking without queue
Figure 10.9.2.6-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among
MCPTT floor participants. In the case, MCPTT clients do not support queue
function. The current speaking MCPTT client acting as the floor arbitrator
controls the floor request when receiving the floor request from other MCPTT
clients. This procedure happens while voice media is transmitting. In the
flow, MCPTT client 1 transmits the voice media to the MCPTT group and acts as
the floor arbitrator.
NOTE: The description also applies to private calls.
Figure 10.9.2.6-1: Floor request during speaking without queue
1\. MCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message to the MCPTT group.
2\. MCPTT client 1 acting as the floor arbitrator rejects the floor request
from MCPTT client 2 if no queue function is supported and sends the floor
rejected message to the MCPTT group.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends the floor release message to the MCPTT group when
releasing the floor, in order to indicate that MCPTT client 1 finishes to send
the voice media and releases the floor.
When the floor release message is transmitted, there are no voice media in the
MCPTT group until an MCPTT client requests the floor as described in subclause
10.9.2.3.
#### 10.9.2.7 Override
Figure 10.9.2.7-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among
MCPTT floor participants and while voice media is transmitting. When the
currently speaking MCPTT floor participant receives the floor request message
from another floor participant who is authorized to revoke the active
transmission (e.g. higher hierarchy), the current speaking MCPTT floor
participant immediately stops sending the audio media and then grants the
permission to that authorized floor participant.
NOTE: The description also applies to private calls.
Pre-condition:
\- MCPTT client 1, who acts as the floor arbitrator, transmits the audio media
to the MCPTT group.
Figure 10.9.2.7-1: Floor request with override authorization
1\. MCPTT client 2 sends the floor request message with override criteria
(e.g., priority level) to the MCPTT group.
2\. MCPTT client 1 acting as the floor arbitrator determines if the floor is
to be revoked based on override criteria. If this is the case, MCPTT client 1
revokes its right of the floor and stops sending the voice media immediately.
3\. MCPTT client 1 sends the floor granted message to the MCPTT group. The
floor granted message contains the MCPTT ID to be granted, the floor and the
floor control queue (if supported). MCPTT client 1 may also include the
maximum duration that MCPTT client 2 can transmit voice in the floor granted
message.
MCPTT client2 who has revoked the floor is the new floor arbitrator and
transmits the audio media to the MCPTT group.
#### 10.9.2.8 Floor queue status
Figure 10.9.2.8-1 shows the high level procedure that the floor control is
conducted when the MCPTT off-network session is already established among
MCPTT floor participants and while voice media is transmitting. If the floor
control queueing is supported by the floor control mechanism, the current
speaking MCPTT group member who is acting as the floor arbitrator collects the
information about the queue status based on the received request(s) from the
MCPTT group participant(s). The current speaker can then share information
about the queue status of the MCPTT floor participant upon request.
NOTE: The description only applies to group calls.
Pre-condition:
\- MCPTT client 1, who acts as the floor arbitrator, transmits the audio media
to the MCPTT group.
Figure 10.9.2.8-1: Queue status request
1\. MCPTT client 2 sends the queue position request message targeted to MCPTT
client 1 i.e. the floor arbitrator by broadcasting the message to the MCPTT
group to get its queue status.
2\. Since the queue function is assumed to be supported in this call flow,
MCPTT client 1 i.e. the floor arbitrator processes the queue position request
to find out the status of MCPTT client 1 in the queue.
3\. MCPTT client 1 constructs the queue position info message containing the
MCPTT client 2\'s queue status and sends it toward MCPTT client 2 by
broadcasting the message to the MCPTT group.
MCPTT client1 continues being the floor arbitrator and transmits the audio
media to the MCPTT group.
## 10.10 Use of MBMS transmission (on-network)
### 10.10.1 Information flows for MBMS Transmission
#### 10.10.1.1 MapGroupToBearer
Table 10.10.1.1-1 describes the information flow to associate a MCPTT group
call to a MBMS bearer. It is sent from the MCPTT server to the MCPTT client.
Table 10.10.1.1-1: MapGroupToBearer
Information element Status Description
* * *
MCPTT group ID M This element identifies the MCPTT group, in which the call is
started. Media stream identifier M This element identifies the media stream of
the SDP used for the group call (e.g. MBMS subchannel). TMGI (see NOTE) O The
MBMS bearer identifier if the media of the MCPTT group call is not sent on the
same MBMS bearer as this MapGroupToBearer message. Call acknowledgement
indicator O Indication that the MCPTT group call requires acknowledgement from
receiving MCPTT clients. NOTE: TMGI shall be present if this message is sent
over a different MBMS bearer than the media of the group call; TMGI may be
present if this message is sent over the same MBMS bearer as the media of the
group call.
#### 10.10.1.2 UnmapGroupFromBearer
Table 10.10.1.2-1 describes the information flow to disconnect a MCPTT group
call from a MBMS bearer. It is sent from the MCPTT server to the MCPTT client.
Table 10.10.1.2-1: UnmapGroupFromBearer
Information element Status Description
* * *
MCPTT group ID M This element identifies the MCPTT group which will no longer
use the MBMS bearer.
#### 10.10.1.3 Application paging
Table 10.10.1.3-1 describes the information flow application paging from the
MCPTT server to the MCPTT clients.
Table 10.10.1.3-1: Application paging
* * *
Information element Status Description MCPTT Group ID (see NOTE) O This
element identifies the MCPTT group which is paged by the application. MCPTT ID
(see NOTE) O Identity of the MCPTT user which is paged by the application for
the private call. Cause M The cause for this message being sent (e.g. for the
use in group calls or private calls). NOTE: Either MCPTT Group ID or MCPTT ID
is present.
* * *
### 10.10.2 Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
The MCPTT service shall support the procedure for using pre-established MBMS
bearers as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]. The MCPTT service shall use the
MCPTT-1, MCPTT-6, MCPTT‑8 and MCPTT-9 reference points for this procedure.
MCPTT may use pre-established MBMS bearer for the different types of MCPTT
group calls. Both pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls can use the
pre-established MBMS bearer for distributing the media. The MBMS bearer can be
used by any group. Depending on the capacity of the MBMS bearer, the bearer
can be used to broadcast one or more group calls in parallel.
Both the media packets as well as the floor control messages to the receiving
users are sent on the MBMS bearer. Optionally a separate MBMS bearer could be
used for the floor control messages, due to different bearer characteristic
requirements.
When using the pre-established procedure for MCPTT, the MCPTT server perform
the procedure of call connect and disconnect over MBMS as defined in subclause
10.10.4 at the group communication session establishment step.
### 10.10.3 Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
The MCPTT service shall support the procedure for using dynamic MBMS bearers
as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]. The MCPTT service shall use the MCPTT-1,
MCPTT-4, MCPTT-6, MCPTT‑7, MCPTT-8 and MCPTT-9 reference points for this
procedure.
MCPTT may use dynamic MBMS bearer establishment for the different types of
MCPTT group calls. Both pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls can use
the dynamic MBMS bearer for distributing the media.
Both the media packets as well as the floor control messages to the receiving
users are sent on the MBMS bearer.
When using the procedures for dynamic MBMS bearer establishment for MCPTT, the
MCPTT server perform the procedure of call connect and disconnect over MBMS as
defined in subclause 10.10.4 at the group communication session establishment
step.
### 10.10.4 Call connect and disconnect over MBMS
#### 10.10.4.1 General
MBMS bearer can be used for MCPTT group calls. One MBMS bearer is not
permanently associated to one specific group or group call. Before sending
media packets of a group call over MBMS bearer, the MCPTT server shall send
the association information between group call and the MBMS bearer. The group
call setup procedure indicates the media stream within one MBMS bearer that is
used for the specific group call. When the group call over the MBMS bearer is
finished, this temporary association information of an MCPTT group call to
specific resources on a MBMS bearer is undone. The procedure in figure
10.10.4.2.1-1 requires that the group session is setup before the call start.
This eliminates the need for the receiving clients to continuously use a
unicast bearer. Prior to this the MBMS bearer is activated and announced to
the MCPTT clients.
#### 10.10.4.2 Procedure
##### 10.10.4.2.1 Call connect over MBMS
In figure 10.10.4.2.1-1 the MCPTT client 1 is the client that initiate an
MCPTT chat group call and also the transmitting client. MCPTT client 1 may,
but does not have to, be in an MBMS service area. The MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT
client 3 represents MCPTT clients receiving the MCPTT call over an MBMS
bearer. There may be other receiving clients both over unicast bearers and
over this or other MBMS bearer(s), however they are not illustrated in this
figure.
The same procedure as for chat group call can also be applied for pre-arranged
calls. However, that requires that the pre-arranged sessions are already
active. If a pre-arranged group session is initiated the use of pre-
established sessions are required.
Pre-conditions:
\- All users participating in the MCPTT group call are already affiliated to
the group.
\- All participating users have joined the group session.
Figure 10.10.4.2.1-1: Chat group call connect on MBMS bearer
1\. Activation and announcement of MBMS bearer availability.
NOTE 1: The procedure does not include the steps for MCPTT client location
reporting, or for MBMS capability information exchange.
2\. MCPTT client 1 initiate the MCPTT group call by sending an initial floor
request over a unicast bearer to the MCPTT server (reference point MCPTT-4).
3\. The MCPTT server will send a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously
activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the call over an MBMS
bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between
the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MCPTT
group ID and information about the media stream identifier of the activated
MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e. the TMGI) of the MBMS bearer
broadcasting the call. The message is sent over reference point MCPTT-9.
NOTE 2: Step 3 can be deferred until step 5 and the MapGroupToBearer message
can then be included in the floor taken message.
4\. The MCPTT server grants the right to transmit for MCPTT client 1 and by
that sends a floor granted message to the MCPTT client 1. This message is sent
over a unicast bearer (reference point MCPTT-4).
5\. A floor taken message is sent from the MCPTT server to all receiving
users. This message includes the MCPTT ID of the transmitting MCPTT client as
well as the MCPTT group ID. The message is sent over a MBMS bearer to all
users that have previously been setup to receive calls over the MBMS bearer.
The message is sent over reference point MCPTT-9.
6\. The media is sent from MCPTT client 1 to the MCPTT server over unicast
bearer and from the MCPTT server to the MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 over
MBMS bearer.
NOTE 3: Additional floor request messages in the same call will not trigger
the MapGroupToBearer message to be sent.
##### 10.10.4.2.2 Call disconnect over MBMS
Figure 10.10.4.2.2-1 shows the high level procedure where an
UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCPTT server to the MCPTT clients
to indicate that the MCPTT group call is being dissociated from the MBMS
bearer.
Figure 10.10.4.2.2-1: Chat group call disconnect on MBMS bearer
1\. An MCPTT group call is ongoing; the media is broadcasted over MBMS bearer
to MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3.
2\. MCPTT server has determined to disconnect the call over the MBMS bearer
for the MCPTT clients
3\. An UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCPTT server to MCPTT
client 2, MCPTT client 3 and possibly to MCPTT client 1 (if in MBMS coverage
area) on MBMS bearer(s).
NOTE 4: The UnmapGroupFromBearer message can be sent as part of other
messages.
NOTE 5: The UnmapGroupFromBearer message and the MapGroupToBearer message can
be combined, to facilitate switching bearers in one signalling step, as
necessary.
### 10.10.5 Switching from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer
The MCPTT service shall support the procedure for switching from MBMS bearer
to unicast bearer as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]. The MCPTT service shall
use the MCPTT-1, MCPTT-4, MCPTT‑7, MCPTT-8 and MCPTT‑9 reference points for
this procedure.
### 10.10.6 Enhanced MCPTT group call setup procedure with MBMS bearer
#### 10.10.6.1 Description
When the MCPTT server initiates a new MCPTT call, the MCPTT server shall
decide to use unicast bearers or broadcast bearers for the downlink media. A
similar decision may also be made for other types of media communication e.g.
MCVideo. To decide to use broadcast or unicast involves a number of aspects.
The figure 10.10.6.1-1 specifies a procedural flow to perform such decision.
The flow described evaluates which bearer type to use for a new MCPTT group
call. It is assumed that if an MBMS bearer is active it is also announced to
the MCPTT client.
When using an MBMS bearer for application level control signalling, the
announcement of an already active MBMS bearer could be part of the MCPTT group
call setup, however that will have an impact on the call setup time.
Figure 10.10.6.1-1: MBMS bearer decision flow
On a high level the procedure outcome is to use unicast or broadcast bearers
for the new MCPTT group call. For an enhanced group call setup procedure, the
MBMS bearer may be used to trigger the use of a unicast bearer.
#### 10.10.6.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 10.10.6.2-1 can be used in the following scenarios:
\- Initiate a new call on unicast bearer
\- Transfer an ongoing call from broadcast bearer to unicast bearers
Pre-conditions:
\- There must be an active and announced MBMS bearer
Figure 10.10.6.2-1: Application paging over an MBMS bearer
1\. The MCPTT server initiates a new MCPTT group call on unicast or decides to
transfer an ongoing call to unicast, or may initiate an MCPTT private call.
2\. The MCPTT sends an application paging message on the MBMS bearer to inform
the MCPTT client that the MCPTT server will initiate media transmission over a
unicast bearer.
NOTE: The application paging message is sent with the assumption that there
are UEs in idle mode. Furthermore, this message is an application level paging
message and does not replace the normal paging procedure executed by EPC and
RAN.
3\. In the case that the UE is in idle mode the UE will initiate a service
request to transfer the UE to connected mode.
4\. The MCPTT server stops sending the media over an MBMS bearer. This step is
only performed if transferring an ongoing call.
5\. The MCPTT server initiates the media transmission over the unicast bearer.
Step 4-5 may be performed in parallel with step 2-3. Step 5 will trigger a
normal paging in EPC and RAN if the client is still in idle mode.

## 10.12 MCPTT media plane transmissions with partner MCPTT systems (on-
network)
The MCPTT user is able to receive MCPTT media services (e.g. group
communication, private calls) from partner MCPTT systems in normal and roaming
conditions. In this service delivery model, the media plane transmissions
between the MCPTT UE of the user and the partner MCPTT system can be achieved
directly or via the primary MCPTT system, selected by the PLMN operator\'s
policy. The protocol used for media plane signalling is non-SIP like RTCP.
Figure 10.12-1 provides the procedure for media related signalling.
Figure 10.12-2 provide the procedure for the media transmission (directly)
between MCPTT UE of the user and the partner MCPTT system.
Figure 10.12-3 provides the procedure for the media transmission (via the
primary MCPTT system) between MCPTT UE of the user and the partner MCPTT
system.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT group is defined in the partner MCPTT system, where the MCPTT
client of user receives the MCPTT service.
2\. An MCPTT group call is set up and active.
3\. The partner MCPTT system is the group host MCPTT server that is hosting
the MCPTT group. The corresponding floor control server manages the media
corresponding to the group call.
4\. Protocol used for signalling of media plane is non-SIP, it can be protocol
like RTCP.
5\. Media related signalling is sent via the primary MCPTT system.
6\. The path for media between the MCPTT UE and partner MCPTT system has been
selected to be sent directly to the partner MCPTT system or via the primary
MCPTT system based on PLMN operator\'s policy.
Figure 10.12-1: Media related signalling communication
Figure 10.12-2: Media communication direct
Figure 10.12-3: Media communication via primary MCPTT system
For media related signalling communication:
1\. An MCPTT user wants to talk.
2\. The floor participant corresponding to the MCPTT user sends a floor
request message to floor control server (partner MCPTT system) to get the
authorization and/or permission to talk.
3\. The floor control server (partner MCPTT system) performs the authorization
and arbitrates between requests that are in contention (i.e., floor control).
4\. If the floor control server (partner MCPTT system) allows the floor
participant to talk, a floor granted is provided with permission granted to
talk.
For media communication:
5\. The MCPTT client can now send uplink media data to the media distribution
function of the MCPTT server (partner MCPTT system).
6\. The media distribution function of the MCPTT server (partner MCPTT system)
has downlink media data to transfer.
7\. The media distribution function of the MCPTT server (partner MCPTT system)
transfers the downlink media to the MCPTT client of the MCPTT user.
## 10.13 Location information (on-network)
The MCPTT system makes use of all of the procedures for location management as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], utilising the CSC-14 reference point between
the location management client and location management server and the CSC‑15
reference point between the MCPTT server and location management server.
\- The MC service client is the MCPTT client;
\- The MC service server is the MCPTT server;
\- The MC service group is the MCPTT group;
\- The MC service ID is the MCPTT ID; and
\- The MC service group ID is the MCPTT group ID.
## 10.14 Ambient listening call
### 10.14.1 General
The ambient listening call is a type of a private MCPTT call that only allows
a \"listened to\" user to transmit media to a \"listening\" user such that
there is no indication on the MCPTT UE of the \"listened to\" user about the
call and the media transmission.
NOTE 1: \"listened to\" user refers to the user who is transmitting media in
an ambient listening call.
NOTE 2: \"listening\" user refers to the user who is receiving media in an
ambient listening call.
There are two types of ambient listening call as below:
\- Remotely initiated ambient listening is initiated by the authorized user
(e.g., dispatcher) who wants to listen to another user. In this case, the
\"listened to\" user is the called party, and shall automatically accept the
call without causing any indication about the call and transmit the media to
the \"listening\" user.
\- Locally initiated ambient listening is initiated by an authorized user who
wants another user to listen to the MCPTT UE communication. In this case, the
\"listened to\" user is the calling party and shall automatically transmit the
media to the \"listening\" user without causing any indication about the call
processing and media transmission.
### 10.14.2 Information flows for ambient listening call
#### 10.14.2.1 Ambient listening call request
Table 10.14.2.1-1 describes the information flow ambient listening call
request from the MCPTT client to the MCPTT server and MCPTT server to the
MCPTT client.

## 10.15 First-to-answer call setup
### 10.15.1 Description
Figure 10.15.3-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCPTT client initiating
MCPTT first-to-answer call. The flow may use a floor request in the MCPTT call
request indicating that the originator will be given the floor when the call
starts and eliminates the need for a separate initial floor request message
during media plane establishment. Alternatively, the call initiation may be
sent without the floor request, which allows the called party to request the
floor first. For a MCPTT first-to-answer call without floor control, floor
control is not established.
Figure 10.15.3-1 also describes the handling of private calls when a
functional alias replaces the MCPTT ID as target address. A functional alias
can be simultaneously used by more than one MCPTT user, i.e. multiple MCPTT
clients can activate the same functional alias.

### 10.15.3 Procedure
All clients are served by the primary MCPTT service provider in figure
10.15.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The calling MCPTT user has selected first-to-answer call.
2\. **MCPTT clients 1 to n are registered and their respective users, MCPTT
user 1 to MCPTT user n, are authenticated and authorized to use the MCPTT
service** , as per procedure in subclause 10.2.
> 3\. MCPTT clients 2 to n have activated the same functional alias.
>
> 4\. The MCPTT server has subscribed to the MCPTT functional alias
> controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
> activation updates.
Figure 10.15.3-1: MCPTT first-to-answer call -- MCPTT users in the same MCPTT
system
**1**. **MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to establish a MCPTT first-
to-answer call** indicating a set of potential target recipients or by calling
a functional alias**. For a MCPTT first-to-answer call with floor control,
floor control is to be established. For first-to-answer call without floor
control, both users will have the ability to transmit without floor
arbitration.**
2\. **MCPTT client 1 sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call request including a
set of potential target recipients** to the MCPTT server (via the SIP core as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5])**, using** either a list of **MCPTT IDs** or a
functional alias**. The MCPTT first-to-answer call request contains the MCPTT
ID** and may contain the functional alias **of originating user and an SDP
offer containing one or more media types. The MCPTT first-to-answer call
request may also contain a data element that indicates that MCPTT client 1 is
requesting the floor, for a first-to-answer call with floor control. The MCPTT
client 1 includes a first-to-answer call indication that the call is to be
established only to the first answering user.**
3\. The MCPTT server confirms that MCPTT users are authorized for the call and
whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate a first-to-
answer call. The MCPTT server checks whether the provided functional alias of
the calling user, if present, can be used and has been activated for the MCPTT
user. If a functional alias is present, the MCPTT server shall also check
whether MCPTT client 1 is allowed to use the functional alias of MCPTT client
2 (to MCPTT client n) to setup a private call and whether MCPTT client 2 (to
MCPTT client n) is (are) allowed to receive a private call from MCPTT client 1
using a functional alias.
4\. The MCPTT server **determines the list of MCPTT users to send MCPTT first-
to-answer call request, based on a set of** potential target recipients
**obtained from the request from MCPTT client 1. Alternatively, when a
functional alias is used as target address, the MCPTT server resolves the
functional alias to a corresponding list of related MCPTT IDs of MCPTT client
2 to MCPTT client n who have activated the functional alias. The functional
alias must have been activated to identify the MCPTT IDs of the called
users.**
NOTE 1: Based on some selection criteria (e.g. using the current location of
the initiating user to determine the dispatchers that are responsible for the
related geographic areas), the MCPTT server can send MCPTT first-to-answer
call requests only to a sub-set of the MCPTT users that have activated the
functional alias. The selection of the appropriate sub-set of MCPTT IDs is
left to implementation.
Editor\'s note: Whether the MCPTT server shall proceed only with those MCPTT
IDs which are allowed to be called by MCPTT client 1 is FFS.
5a, 5b, 5c. **The MCPTT server includes information that it communicates using
MCPTT service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types
contained in the initial received request and sends similar MCPTT first-to-
answer call request to each** potential target recipient**, including the
MCPTT ID and, if present, the functional alias of the calling MCPTT user at
MCPTT client 1. If one or more called MCPTT users have registered to the MCPTT
service with multiple MCPTT UEs and has designated the MCPTT UE for receiving
the calls, then the incoming MCPTT first-to-answer call request is delivered
only to the designated MCPTT UE. Otherwise MCPTT first-to-answer call request
may be delivered to all the registered MCPTT UEs. If a functional alias is
present and more than one MCPTT client has activated that functional alias,
then the MCPTT server sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call request to each
MCPTT client.**
6a, 6b, 6c. The MCPTT users are alerted, regardless of the commencement mode.
7\. MCPTT user **at MCPTT client** 2 accepted the call which causes MCPTT
client 2 to send an MCPTT first-to-answer call response to the MCPTT server.
NOTE 2: MCPTT server does not divert MCPTT first-to-answer call to voicemail
if MCPTT user at MCPTT client 2 has not accepted the incoming call.
8\. The MCPTT server sends an MCPTT first-to-answer call response to MCPTT
client 1 indicating that MCPTT user **at MCPTT client** 2 has accepted the
call, including the accepted media parameters.
9a. The MCPTT server sends a MCPTT first-to-answer call cancel request to
MCPTT client 3.
9b. Optionally, MCPTT client 3 notifies the user.
10a. The MCPTT server sends a MCPTT first-to-answer call cancel request to
MCPTT client n.
10b. Optionally, MCPTT client n notifies the user.
11\. The media plane for communication is established. Either user can
transmit media individually when using floor control. For successful call
establishment for first-to-answer call with floor request from MCPTT client 1,
the floor participant associated with MCPTT client 1 is granted the floor
initially. At the same time the floor participant associated with MCPTT client
2 is informed that the floor is taken. For a first-to-answer call without
floor control both users are allowed to transmit simultaneously.
NOTE 3: Prior to media plane establishment, MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2
set up a security association for the media, if end-to-end encryption is used
for this call.
Editor\'s note: It is assumed that MCPTT client 1 initiates the set up as is
done for private calls, but the details for the media security establishment
are FFS and are in the scope of SA3. Results provided by SA3 may require
changes in the procedure.
NOTE 4: The steps 9a ,10a and 11 can occur in any order and can also be
performed in parallel.
12\. MCPTT client 3 sends an MCPTT first-to-answer cancel call response.
13\. MCPTT client n sends an MCPTT first-to-answer cancel call response.
## 10.16 Remotely initiated MCPTT call
### 10.16.1 General
A remotely initiated MCPTT call allows an authorized user to cause a remote
MCPTT UE to initiate a call by itself, without its user explicitly initiating
the call.
### 10.16.2 Information flows for remotely initiated MCPTT call
#### 10.16.2.1 Remotely initiated MCPTT call request

### 10.16.3 Procedure
#### 10.16.3.1 Remotely initiated MCPTT call request
The remotely initiated MCPTT call request procedure includes the initial
remotely initiated MCPTT call request from the MCPTT user to the remote UE and
either the MCPTT private call procedures or the MCPTT group call procedures
originating at the remote UE.
Procedures in figure 10.16.3.1-1 show the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT client initiating a remotely initiated MCPTT call request with
the chosen MCPTT user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. If the MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 wants the resulting remotely initiated
MCPTT call to be:
a. an MCPTT group call, then MCPTT user 2 on MCPTT client 2 is an affiliated
MCPTT group member of the MCPTT group that is the target of the remotely
initiated MCPTT call.
b. an MPCTT private call, then the MCPTT user 2 on MCPTT client 2 is permitted
to initiate an MCPTT private call to the identified MCPTT user.
Figure 10.16.3.1-1: Remotely initiated MCPTT call request
1\. MCPTT user on MCPTT client 1 initiates a remotely initiated MCPTT call
request to the MCPTT user of MCPTT client 2.
2\. MCPTT client 1 sends a remotely initiated MCPTT call request towards the
MCPTT server.
3\. MCPTT server checks whether the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized
to initiate a remotely initiated MCPTT call request. If the resulting of this
request is to initiate a group call, MCPTT client 1 is authorized to remotely
initiate the MCPTT call request, and if MCPTT client 2 is a member of the
group, the MCPTT server implicitly affiliates the MCPTT user 2 on MCPTT client
2 to the MCPTT group if the MCPTT client 2 is not already affiliated and
notifies the MCPTT client 2 of this affiliation change.
4\. If authorized, MCPTT server sends the corresponding remotely initiated
MCPTT call request towards the MCPTT client 2.
5\. Based on the received information the receiving MCPTT client 2 may notify
the user of the remotely initiated MCPTT call request.
6\. Optionally the receiving MCPTT client 2 sends a remotely initiated MCPTT
call response to the MCPTT server.
7\. After receiving the remotely initiated MCPTT call response from MCPTT
client 2, the MCPTT server informs the MCPTT client 1 about successful
remotely initiated MCPTT call request.
NOTE 1: Step 6 and step 7 might not be sent, since it could be determined that
the remotely initiated MCPTT call was successful by receiving the MCPTT call
initiated by MCPTT client 2.
8\. Based on the received information the MCPTT client 2 initiates an MCPTT
call (either an MCPTT group call or an MCPTT private call) using the normal
MCPTT call establishment procedures (10.6.2.3.1.1.2 or 10.7.2.2) with implicit
floor request and other call set up parameters if received in the remotely
initiated call request. The MCPTT call request may include the additional
information such as indication of whether the call initiation is due to
receiving of remotely initiated call request.
NOTE 2: Step 6 and step 7 are received in this order. However, step 6 or step
7 or both might occur before or after step 8.
NOTE 3: The received information can have call setup related information, such
as requested application priority level, commencement mode, etc.
9\. If the remotely initiated call is a group call, then when the ongoing
MCPTT group call is terminated, the MCPTT server de-affiliates the MCPTT user
2 on MCPTT client 2 from the MCPTT group if MCPTT client 2 is implicitly
affiliated as defined in the step 3 above (the de-affiliation is not shown in
the figure for simplicity).
The result of these procedures is an on-going MCPTT (group or private) call
which includes MCPTT client 1.
## 10.17 Support for multiple devices
### 10.17.1 General
An MCPTT user may be authorized to use the MCPTT service from multiple MCPTT
UEs as per the procedure in subclause 10.2.
If an MCPTT server receives a service authorization request for an MCPTT user
who is previously MCPTT service authorized on another MCPTT UE, then the MCPTT
server shall process this service authorization request as described in
subclause 10.2. In the MCPTT service authorization response to the MCPTT user,
the MCPTT server shall also indicate that the MCPTT user is already MCPTT
service authorized from another MCPTT UE.
Editor\'s Note: How to log off remotely from MCPTT clients on one or more
other MCPTT UEs that the MCPTT user is already MCPTT service authorized from
is FFS.
## 10.18 Subscription and notification for functional alias
### 10.18.1 General
The MCPTT service shall support the procedures and related information flows
as specified in subclauses 10.13.10 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] with the following
clarifications:
> \- The MC service client is the MCPTT client;
>
> \- The MC service server is the MCPTT server;
### 10.18.2 Void
### 10.18.3 Void
## 10.19 Ad hoc group call
### 10.19.1 General
This subclause contains procedures for ad hoc group call across a one or more
MCPTT systems, and associated functions such as emergency call, Imminent peril
call, broadcast call and others.
The ad hoc group calls can use the participants list provided by either an
initiator of the call or MCPTT server. The MCPTT server can use the criteria
provided by the initiator of the call to determine the participants list along
with its own criteria or local policies. The resulting ad hoc group uses the
configuration of a separate preconfigured MCPTT group.
NOTE 1: A preconfigured group which is intended only to provide configuration
for the ad hoc group is identified by a parameter in the group configuration
described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
The preconfigured MCPTT group that provides the configuration is not used for
the MCPTT group communication, it only provides configuration for one or more
adhoc group calls. The MCPTT group ID of the ad hoc group call is provided by
the MCPTT server when the ad hoc group call is originated. In order to
establish security context for the end-to-end secured ad hoc group call, the
security related information is used from this preconfigured group.
NOTE 2: The configurations defined for the adhoc group call in user profile
and service configuration document as described in the Annex A.3 and A.5 is
applicable only for single MCPTT system.

### 10.19.3 Procedures
#### 10.19.3.1 Ad hoc group call procedures in single MCPTT system
##### 10.19.3.1.1 Ad hoc group call setup
Figure 10.19.3.1.1-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group call setup procedure
initiated by an authorized user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The authorized user at MCPTT client 1 wants to invite MCPTT users at MCPTT
client 2, MCPTT client 3 and MCPTT client 4 for the ad hoc group call and is
aware of the MCPTT IDs of the participants or to invite the ad hoc group
member if the ad hoc group call follows an ad hoc group emergency alert, the
MCPTT client 1 is aware of the ad hoc group ID.
2\. Number of participants being invited for the ad hoc group call is within
the limit.
3\. End-to-End encryption is supported for this ad hoc group call.
4\. The pre-configured group identity and pre-configured group configuration
to be used for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in MCPTT client and
other participants of ad hoc group have also received the relevant security
related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group
communication.
NOTE 1: Selection of MCPTT IDs of the participants can be manual or from the
user profile configuration data or by any other means. This is left for the
implementation.
Figure 10.19.3.1.1-1: Ad hoc group call setup
1\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group call. The
MCPTT client 1 initiates the ad hoc group call by sending the ad hoc group
call request containing the list of participants or an ad hoc group ID from an
ad hoc group emergency alert to the MCPTT server. Encryption supported
information element shall be set to true since end-to-end encryption is
supported. An SDP offer containing the MCPTT client media parameters is
included. If there is a floor request to transmit, then the ad hoc group call
request contains an indication of an implicit floor request. If the MCPTT user
of MCPTT client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group call
request contains that functional alias. If the ad hoc group call request
contains an implicit floor request it may also include location information.
If the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency ad hoc group
call or the MCPTT emergency state is already set for the MCPTT client 1 (due
to a previously triggered MCPTT emergency alert):
i. the MCPTT ad hoc group call request shall contain an emergency indicator;
ii. if the MCPTT emergency state is not set already, MCPTT client 1 sets its
MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state of MCPTT client 1 is retained
until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCPTT client 1.
2\. If the ad hoc group call is supported, the MCPTT server verifies whether
the user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate an ad hoc group call. If
not authorized, the MCPTT server rejects the ad hoc group call request as
specified in the step 3. The MCPTT server accepts the ad hoc group call
request if the ad hoc group call is supported and authorized. If authorised,
it validates whether the number of invited participants is within the
configured limit before proceeding with the call setup.
If functional alias is present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided
functional alias allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
If location information was included in the ad hoc group call request, the
MCPTT server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the
location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the
call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to
other MCPTT users on a call when talking\").
> If an emergency indicator is present in the received MCPTT ad hoc group call
> request, the MCPTT ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress
> emergency state until this ad hoc group call is terminated; and
>
> If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCPTT ad hoc group
> call request, the MCPTT ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress
> imminent peril state until this ad hoc group call is terminated.
>
> If the MC service users\' information received in step 1 does not contain an
> ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCPTT server forms
> the ad hoc group by using MCPTT users\' information received in step 1,
> determines the preconfigured group to be used for the configuration of the
> ad hoc group and assigns a MC service group ID for the newly formed ad hoc
> group. If no MC service ad hoc group ID was included in the ad hoc group
> call request of step 1, or if the provided MC service ad hoc group ID is not
> accepted by the MC service server, the MCPTT server assigns a MCPTT group ID
> for the newly formed ad hoc group.
>
> The MCPTT server considers the ad hoc group call participants as implicitly
> affiliated to the ad hoc group.
3\. The MCPTT server shall send the ad hoc group call request return message
to MCPTT client 1 containing the below:
i. The MCPTT ad hoc group ID either generated by the MCPTT server or provided
by the MCPTT client 1 if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group emergency
alert (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized);
ii. The group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group
call (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized); and
iii. Result of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not.
> If the ad hoc group call request is not authorized, the MCPTT server and
> MCPTT client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.
4a-4c. The MCPTT server sends the ad hoc group call requests towards the MCPTT
clients of the invited users based on step 1. While sending the ad hoc group
call requests, the MCPTT server shall remove the information elements that are
not required to be conveyed to the target MCPTT clients (e.g. MCPTT ID list of
the users who are required to acknowledge)
5a-5c. The receiving MCPTT clients notify their corresponding MCPTT user about
the incoming ad hoc group call request with the information of the MCPTT group
ID for the ad hoc group.
6a-6c. The receiving MCPTT clients may accept or reject the ad hoc group call
requests and send ad hoc group call responses to the MCPTT server. The
response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MCPTT user,
which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCPTT server.
7\. The MCPTT server sends the ad hoc group call response to MCPTT client 1
through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment.
NOTE 2: Steps 5 to step 7 can start to occur before all of step 4 is completed
since the MCPTT server do not require to wait for the previous ad hoc group
call request to complete before sending the ad hoc group request to another
participant.
8\. If the initiating MCPTT user requires the acknowledgement from the invited
MCPTT users, and the required MCPTT users do not acknowledge the call setup
within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup timeout\"), then the
MCPTT server may proceed with or abandon the call and then notify the
initiating MCPTT user that the acknowledgements did not include all required
members according to ad hoc group call policy from the user profile
configuration. The MCPTT server may notify the initiating MCPTT user of all
MCPTT users who did not acknowledge the ad hoc group call request within the
configured time. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCPTT user by
the MCPTT server more than once during the call when MCPTT users join or leave
the MCPTT ad hoc group call.
9\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, MCPTT client 3 and MCPTT client 4
establish media plane and floor control resources.
NOTE 3: Step 9 can occur any time following step 7 if the conditions to
proceed with the call are met.
##### 10.19.3.1.2 Release ad hoc group call
The procedure focuses on the case where the MCPTT server releases an ongoing
MCPTT ad hoc group call for all the participants of that ad hoc group call,
since at least one of the release conditions are met e.g., due to hang time
expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator
leaving.
Figure 10.19.3.1.2-1 below illustrates the signalling control plane procedure
for the MCPTT server initiating termination an ongoing ad hoc group call.
Figure 10.19.3.1.2-1: Release ad hoc group call
1\. It is assumed that MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3
are already part of the ongoing ad hoc group call.
2\. MCPTT server would like to release the MCPTT ad hoc group call which is
ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving.
3\. MCPTT server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc group call
and generates ad hoc group call release request to release ongoing session.
The MCPTT server cancels the in-progress emergency state or in-progress
imminent peril state of the ad hoc group if the ad hoc group call is an
emergency or imminent peril call respectively.
4\. MCPTT server sends ad hoc group call release request via SIP core towards
each participant of the ongoing ad hoc group call.
5\. MCPTT users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group call.
6\. MCPTT client(s) receiving ad hoc group call release request, acknowledge
towards the MCPTT server by sending an ad hoc group call release response.
NOTE: If the initiator of the ad hoc group call does not supply the
participants list, the MCPTT client(s) may choose to store the list of
participants for easy re-initiation of another ad hoc group call with the same
participants.
7\. MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the floor
control and media plane resources associated with the ad hoc group call that
is terminated and the ad hoc group ceases to exist (i.e., further call is not
possible over the same ad hoc group, otherwise if the ad hoc group call
follows an ad hoc group emergency alert the ad hoc group continues to exist
(i.e., further calls over the same ad hoc group are possible).
##### 10.19.3.1.3 Ad hoc group call setup with MCPTT server determining the
participants lists
Figure 10.19.3.1.3-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group call setup procedure
initiated by the MCPTT user and MCPTT client 1 wherein the list of
participants is determined by the MCPTT server based on the citeria received
from the MCPTT client.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initate ad hoc group
call.
2\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 wants to invite MCPTT users who are
satisying certain criteria for the ad hoc group call.
Figure 10.19.3.1.3-1: Ad hoc group call participants determined by MCPTT
server
1\. User at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group call in-
order to invite the participants satisfying specific criteria. The MCPTT
client 1 initiates the ad hoc group call by sending the ad hoc group call
request containing the details of the criteria to be applied by the MCPTT
server for determining the participant list. If end-to-end encryption is
supported, the Encryption supported information element shall be set to true
and pre-configured MCPTT group whose configuration is to be applied is
included. An SDP offer containing the MCPTT client media parameters is
included. If there is a floor request to transmit, then the ad hoc group call
request contains an indication of an implicit floor request. If the MCPTT user
of MCPTT client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group call
request contains that functional alias. If the ad hoc group call request
contains an implicit floor request it may also include location information.
If the MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 initiates an MCPTT emergency ad hoc group
call or the MCPTT emergency state is already set for the MCPTT client 1 (due
to a previously triggered MCPTT emergency alert):
i. the MCPTT ad hoc group call request shall contain an emergency indicator;
ii. if the MCPTT emergency state is not set already, MCPTT client 1 sets its
MCPTT emergency state. The MCPTT emergency state of MCPTT client 1 is retained
until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCPTT client 1.
2\. If the ad hoc group call is supported, the MCPTT server verifies whether
the user at MCPTT client 1 is authorized to initiate an ad hoc group call. If
not authorized, the MCPTT server rejects the ad hoc group call request as
specified in the step 3. The MCPTT server accepts the ad hoc group call
request if the ad hoc group call is supported and authorized.
If functional alias is present, the MCPTT server checks whether the provided
functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
If location information was included in the ad hoc group call request, the
MCPTT server checks the privacy policy of the MCPTT user to decide if the
location information of MCPTT client 1 can be provided to other users on the
call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to
other MCPTT users on a call when talking\").
If an emergency indicator is present in the received MCPTT ad hoc group call
request, the MCPTT ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress
emergency state until this ad hoc group call is terminated; and
If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCPTT ad hoc group
call request, the MCPTT ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress
imminent peril state until this ad hoc group call is terminated.
If the information received in the request in step 1 does not contain an ad
hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCPTT server forms the
ad hoc group by using received information, and determines the preconfigured
group to be used for the configuration of the ad hoc group. The MCPTT server
assigns a MCPTT group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group. Further, the ad
hoc group participants are included to ad hoc group once determined as
specified in the step 4.
3\. The MCPTT server shall send the ad hoc group call request return message
to MCPTT client 1 containing the below:
i. The MCPTT ad hoc group ID, either generated by the MCPTT server, if not
included in the ad hoc group call request of step 1, or if the provided MCPTT
ad hoc group ID is not accepted by the MCPTT server, or provided by the
MCVideo client 1 if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group emergency
alert;
ii. The group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group
communication (only included when the ad hoc group data session is
authorized); and
iii. Result of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not
If the ad hoc group call request is not authorized, the MCPTT server and MCPTT
client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.
4\. The MCPTT server determines the list of participants to be invited for the
ad hoc group call based on the information present in the information element
Criteria for determining the participants. This information element could
carry either criteria or indicator identifying pre-defined criteria or a
combination of both.
NOTE: The content of the Criteria information element, the details of the pre-
defined criteria, and the way how their MCPTT server determines the list of
participants are left to implementation.
5\. The MCPTT server sends the ad hoc group call requests towards the MCPTT
clients 2 and 3. While sending the ad hoc group call requests, the MCPTT
server shall remove the information elements that are not required to be
conveyed to the target MCPTT clients. This request carries the pre-configured
group ID whose configuration is to be applied for this ad hoc group call if
end-to-end encryption is requested. The MCPTT server considers the ad hoc
group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.
6\. The receiving MCPTT clients notify their corresponding MCPTT user about
the incoming ad hoc group call request with the information of the MCPTT group
ID for the ad hoc group.
7\. The receiving MCPTT clients may accept or reject the ad hoc group call
requests and send ad hoc group call responses to the MCPTT server. The
response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MCPTT user,
which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MCPTT server.
8\. The MCPTT server sends the ad hoc group call response to MCPTT client 1
through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment.
9\. The MCPTT server may notify the initiating MCPTT user of all MCPTT users
who acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad hoc group
call. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCPTT user by the MCPTT
server more than once during the call when MCPTT users join or leave the MCPTT
ad hoc group call. The authorized users (not shown in figure), who are
configured to receive the participants information of ad hoc group call, are
notified to receive the MCPTT IDs of the MCPTT users who acknowledged the ad
hoc group call request and joined the ad hoc group call, when the MCPTT users
joins late or leave the MCPTT ad hoc group call.
10\. MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 establish media plane
and floor control resources.
##### 10.19.3.1.4 Modification of ad hoc group call participants by the
initiator

2.
NOTE: Steps 8 to 10 can occur at any time following step 3.
9\. The receiving MCPTT client 2 notifies the user about the incoming ad hoc
group call.
10\. The MCPTT client 2 accepts the ad hoc group call request and send ad hoc
group call responses to the MCPTT server. The response may also contain a
functional alias of the responding MCPTT user, which is verified (valid and
activated for the user) by the MCPTT server.
11\. The MCPTT server may notify the initiating MCPTT user of all the users
who are added to the on-going ad hoc group call. This notification may be sent
to the initiating MCPTT user by the MCPTT server more than once during the
call when MCPTT users join or leave the ad hoc group call.
12\. The MCPTT server may notify the participants about the change in the
participants list of on-going ad hoc group call.
##### 10.19.3.1.5 Modification of ad hoc group call participants by the MCPTT

#### 10.19.3.2 Ad hoc group call involving multiple MC systems
##### 10.19.3.2.1 Procedure for ad hoc group call setup -- Participants list
provided by the Initiator
Figure 10.19.3.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure for ad hoc group call setup
procedure initiated by an authorized user wherein either a list of
participants or an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert is
provided by the authorised user and the determined MCPTT users are from
multiple MCPTT systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, it is considered that the partner MC system shares
their users\' information to the primary MC system.
2\. The authorized MCPTT user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MC system.
3\. The MCPTT server of the primary MC system is where the authorized MCPTT
user/dispatcher controls the ad hoc group.
4\. Some users of the ad hoc group belong to partner MC systems.
5\. The preconfigured group identity and preconfigured group configuration to
be used for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in the MCPTT client and
other participants of ad hoc group have also received the relevant security
related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group
communication.
6\. If an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert is used to
invite the ad hoc group members, MCPTT client is aware of the ad hoc group ID.
Figure 10.19.3.2.1-1: Ad hoc group call setup
1\. The MCPTT client of the authorized user initiates an ad hoc group call
with multiple users from primary and partner MC systems. An ad hoc group call
request message with the information of the MCPTT IDs or an ad hoc group ID if
the ad hoc group call follows an ad hoc group emergency alert is routed to the
MCPTT server of the primary MC system.
2\. If the ad hoc group call is supported, the MCPTT server of the primary MC
system verifies whether the user at of MCPTT client is authorized to initiate
an ad hoc group call. If not authorized, the MCPTT server of the primary MC
system rejects the ad hoc group call request as specified in the step 3. If
the the MC service users\' information received in step 1 does not contain an
ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCPTT server of the
primary MC system forms the ad hoc group by using MCPTT users\' information
received in step 1, determines the preconfigured group to be used for the
configuration and assigns an MCPTT group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group.
If no MC service ad hoc group ID was included in the ad hoc group call request
of step 1, or if the provided MC service ad hoc group ID is not accepted by
the MC service server, the MCPTT server assigns a MCPTT group ID for the newly
formed ad hoc group.
The MCPTT server identifies the appropriate MCPTT server responsible for the
MCPTT users of the ad hoc group. The MCPTT server considers the ad hoc group
call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.
NOTE 1: The ad hoc group information including the MCPTT group ID and the list
of users is held in dynamic data in the MCPTT server.
3\. The MCPTT server shall send the ad hoc group call request return message
to the MCPTT client containing the below:
i. The MCPTT ad hoc group ID either generated by the MCPTT server or provided
by the MCPTT client if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group emergency
alert (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized);
ii. The group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group
call (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized); and
iii. Result of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not.
If the ad hoc group call request is not authorized, the MCPTT server and MCPTT
client shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.
4\. The MCPTT server of the primary MC system sends the ad hoc group call
requests towards the MCPTT clients of the invited users belonging to the
primary MC system based on step 1. While sending the ad hoc group call
requests, the MCPTT server of the primary MC system shall remove the
information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the target MCPTT
clients (e.g. MCPTT ID list of the users who are required to acknowledge).
5\. The receiving MCPTT clients notify their corresponding MCPTT users about
the incoming ad hoc group call request with the information of the MCPTT group
ID for the ad hoc group, and may accept or reject the call and respond with an
adhoc group call response.
6\. The primary MCPTT server further initiates an ad hoc group call request
message to the MCPTT users of the partner MC system. The ad hoc group call
request message is routed to the MCPTT users via the MCPTT server of the
partner MC system.
7\. The receiving MCPTT clients notify their corresponding MCPTT users about
the incoming ad hoc group call request with the information of the MCPTT group
ID for the ad hoc group. The MCPTT users upon receipt of the invitation may
accept or reject the call, and respond with the ad hoc group call response.
The ad hoc group call response message is routed to the MCPTT server of the
primary MC system via the MCPTT server of the partner MC system.
8\. The MCPTT server of the primary MC system provides an ad hoc group call
response message to the MCPTT client of the authorized MCPTT user upon
receiving response to the corresponding ad hoc group call request in step 1.
The ad hoc group call response will consist of the success or failure result
and/or detailed reason information in case of failure.
NOTE 2: The ad hoc group call response message is triggered depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
9\. Upon successful ad hoc group call setup, a group call is established
amongst the multiple group members from primary and partner MC systems. The
media plane and floor control resources are established.
##### 10.19.3.2.2 Procedure for ad hoc group call release by MCPTT server --
Participants list provided by the Initiator
This procedure focuses on the case where an MCPTT server initiates the
termination of an ongoing MCPTT ad hoc group call for all the participants of
that group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met
e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT
group members are not present.
Procedures in figure 10.19.3.2.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCPTT server initiating termination of an ongoing MCPTT ad hoc group
call.
Pre-condition:
\- The MCPTT client 1 and MCPTT client 2 belong to primary MC system. The
MCPTT client 3 belongs to partner MC system.
Figure 10.19.3.2.2-1: Ad hoc group call release
1\. The MCPTT users on MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already part
of the ongoing ad hoc group call (e.g. as a result of ad hoc group call setup
as specified in clause 10.19.3.2.x).
2\. The MCPTT server would like to release the ad hoc group call which is
ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated MCPTT
group members are not present.
3\. The MCPTT server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc group
call and generates ad hoc group call release request to release ongoing
session.
4\. The MCPTT server sends a ad hoc group call release request via SIP core
towards each participant of the ongoing group call. If the participants belong
to partner MC system, then ad hoc group call release request is routed to the
MCPTT clients of the partner MC system via the partner MCPTT server.
5\. The MCPTT users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group call.
6\. The MCPTT client(s) receiving ad hoc group call release request, send
acknowledgement towards the MCPTT server by sending a ad hoc group call
release response.
7\. The MCPTT client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the
floor control and media plane resources associated with the ad hoc group call
that is terminated. The MCPTT servers remove the ad hoc group information from
the dynamic data held in the MCPTT servers and the ad hoc group ceases to
exist, otherwise if the ad hoc group call follows an ad hoc group emergency
alert the MCPTT servers keep the dynamic data and the ad hoc group continues
to exist.
##### 10.19.3.2.3 Ad hoc group call setup -- Participants list determined by
the MCPTT server
Figure 10.19.3.2.3-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group call setup procedure
initiated by an authorized user wherein the list of participants is determined
by the MCPTT server based on the criteria received from the MCPTT client and
determined MCPTT users are from multiple MCPTT systems.
Pre-conditions:

3\. The MCPTT server 1 of the primary MC system is where the authorized MCPTT
user/dispatcher creates the ad hoc group.
4\. Some users of the ad hoc group belong to MCPTT server 2 of the partner MC
systems.
5\. The pre-configured group identity and pre-configured group configuration
to be used for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in MCPTT client and
other participants of ad hoc group have also received the relevant security
related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group
communication.
Figure 10.19.3.2.3-1: Ad hoc group call setup involving multiple MCPTT systems
1-3. Same as described in subclause 10.19.3.1.3.
4\. The MCPTT server 1 determines the list of participants from the primary MC
system and determines the partner MC system to be involved in the ad hoc group
call based on the information present in the information element Criteria for
determining the participants. This information element carries the criteria,
indicator identifying pre-defined criteria, or a combination of both.
NOTE 1: The content of the Criteria information element, the details of the
pre-defined criteria, and the way how their MCPTT server determines the list
of participants are left to implementation.
5\. If the MCPTT server 1 needs to involve the partner system based on the
agreement and based on the criteria for determining the participant list, it
sends the ad hoc group call get userlist request to the MCPTT server 2. This
request carries the criteria specified in the step 1.
6\. MCPTT server 2 evaluates the criteria and determines the participants
satisfying the criteria (i.e., MCPTT client 3 and MCPTT client 4) and sends
the response containing the list of MCPTT users satisfying the criteria. The
partner MCPTT server may apply local policies if any while determining the
participants satisfying the criteria.
7\. The MCPTT server 1 compiles the list of participants to be invited for the
ad hoc group call including the participants from both primary and partner MC
system.
8a-8b. The MCPTT server 1 sends the ad hoc group call request towards the
MCPTT client 3 and MCPTT client 4. While sending the ad hoc group call
request, the MCPTT server shall remove the information elements that are not
required to be conveyed to the target MCPTT clients. This request carries the
pre-configured group ID whose configuration is to be applied for this ad hoc
group call if end-to-end encryption is requested. The MCPTT server 1 considers
the ad hoc group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc
group.
9\. The MCPTT server 1 sends the ad hoc group call requests towards the MCPTT
client 2. While sending the ad hoc group call request, the MCPTT server shall
remove the information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the
target MCPTT clients. This request carries the pre-configured group ID whose
configuration is to be applied for this ad hoc group call if end-to-end
encryption is requested. The MCPTT server 1 considers the ad hoc group call
participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.
10a-10c. The receiving MCPTT clients notify their corresponding MCPTT user
about the incoming ad hoc group call request with the information of the MCPTT
group ID for the ad hoc group.
11\. The MCPTT client 2 may accept or reject the ad hoc group call request and
send ad hoc group call response to the MCPTT server 1.
12\. The MCPTT client 3 may accept or reject the ad hoc group call request,
and sends ad hoc group call response to the MCPTT server 1.
13\. The MCPTT client 4 may accept or reject the ad hoc group call request,
and sends ad hoc group call response to the MCPTT server 1.
14\. The MCPTT server 1 sends the ad hoc group call response to MCPTT client 1
through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment.
15\. The MCPTT server 1 may notify the initiating MCPTT user of all MCPTT
users who acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad hoc
group call. The MCPTT server 1 more than once during the call may send this
notification to the initiating MCPTT user whenever an MCPTT user joins or
leaves the MCPTT ad hoc group call. The authorized users (not shown in
figure), who are configured to receive the participants information of ad hoc
group call, are notified to receive the MCPTT IDs of the MCPTT users who
acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad hoc group call,
when the MCPTT users joins late or leave the MCPTT ad hoc group call.
16\. The MCPTT client 1, MCPTT client 2, MCPTT client 3 and MCPTT client 4
establish media plane and floor control resources.
NOTE 2: The ad hoc group call request and response exchanged between MCPTT
server 1 of primary MC system and MCPTT client 3/MCPTT client 4 will always
traversal through the MCPTT server 2.

2\. The MCPTT server 1 detects that the ad hoc group call which is ongoing is
to be released e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second
last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated
MCPTT group members are not present.
3\. The MCPTT server 1 sends the notification to MCPTT server 2 of the partner
MCPTT system about the ad hoc group call release to stop determining the
participant list by MCPTT server 2 of the partner MCPTT system.
4a-4d. The MCPTT server 1 sends ad hoc group call release request to all the
participants of the ad hoc group call.
5a-5d. The MCPTT clients notifies the user about the release of the ad hoc
group call.
5\. The MCPTT server 1 sends the notification to MCPTT server 2 of the partner
MCPTT system about the ad hoc group call release to stop determining the
participant list by MCPTT server 2 of the partner MCPTT system.
6a-6d. All the participants of the ad hoc group call receives the ad hoc group
call release request and sends the ad hoc group call release response to the
MCPTT server 1 of the primary MCPTT server.
NOTE: The ad hoc group call request and response exchanged between MCPTT
server 1 of primary MC system and MCPTT client 3/MCPTT client 4 will always
traversal through the MCPTT server 2.
###### ## Annex A (normative): MCPTT related configuration data
# A.1 General
This Annex provides information about the static data needed for configuration
for the MCPTT service, which belongs to one of the following categories:
\- MCPTT UE configuration data (see subclause A.2);
\- MCPTT user profile configuration data (see subclause A.3);
\- MCPTT related group configuration data (see subclause A.4); and
\- MCPTT service configuration data (see subclause A.5).
For each configuration category, data is split between configuration data that
is applicable to both on‑network and off‑network, configuration data that is
applicable to on-network only, and configuration data that is applicable to
off-network only. The configuration data in each configuration category
corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MCPTT UE, MCPTT
group, MCPTT user and MCPTT service configuration data refers to the
information that will be stored against each MCPTT UE, MCPTT group, MCPTT user
and MCPTT service. This means that the three separate tables (on-network and
off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each configuration
category represent the complete set of data for each configuration data
category element.
The columns in the tables have the following meanings:
\- Reference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.179
[2] or 3GPP TS 22.280 [17] or 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] or the corresponding
subclause from the present document.
\- Parameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the
corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter
in the configuration hierarchy.
\- When it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is
configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the
following nomenclature is used:
\- \"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be
configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
\- \"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need
to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
Parameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy
that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the
configuration data is common across all three tables of on-network and off-
network, on network only and off network only. The level of a parameter within
the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character
\">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level.
Parameters that are at the top most level within the hierarchy have no \">\"
character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child
parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\"
character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child
parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child
parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they
are just containers for their child parameters.
Each parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through
one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline
shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent
configuration data made available to the MCPTT UE shall always overwrite
previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data
was provided via the online or offline mechanism.
# A.2 MCPTT UE configuration data
The general aspects of UE configuration are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
Data in tables A.2-1 and A.2-2 have to be known by the MCPTT UE after MCPTT
authorization.
Data in table A.2-1 can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference
point. Table A.2-2 contains the UE configuration required to support the use
of off-network MCPTT service.
Table A.2-1: UE configuration data (on and off network)
Reference Parameter description
* * *
[R-5. 4.2-002] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [17] Maximum number of simultaneous group
calls (Nc4) [R-5.4.2-003] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [17] Maximum number of
transmissions (Nc5) in a group [R-5.5.2-007] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [17] Maximum
number of private calls (N10)
Table A.2-2: UE configuration data (on network)
Reference Parameter description
* * *
Subclause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] Relay service (Y/N) Subclause 5.2.3 of
3GPP TS 23.280 [16] List of allowed relayed MCPTT groups and their relay
service code (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) (optional) (see NOTE) >
MCPTT group ID > Relay service code (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) NOTE:
When the value of the parameter Relay service is N, this parameter and its
child parameters are not needed.
# A.3 MCPTT user profile configuration data
The general aspects of MC service user profile configuration data are
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16]. The MCPTT user profile configuration data is
stored in the MCPTT user database. The MCPTT server obtains the MCPTT user
profile configuration data from the MCPTT user database (MCPTT-2).
Tables A.3-1 and A.3-2 contain the MCPTT user profile configuration required
to support the use of on-network MCPTT service. Tables A.3-1 and A.3-3 contain
the MCPTT user profile configuration required to support the use of off-
network MCPTT service. Data in table A.3-1 and A.3-3 can be configured offline
using the CSC-11 reference point.
Table A.3-1: MCPTT user profile data (on and off network)

# A.5 MCPTT service configuration data
The general aspects of MC service configuration are specified in 3GPP TS
23.280 [16]. The MCPTT service configuration data is stored in the MCPTT
server.
Tables A.5-1 and A.5-2 describe the configuration data required to support the
use of on-network MCPTT service. Tables A.5-1 and A.5-3 describe the
configuration data required to support the use of off-network MCPTT service.
Data in tables A.5-1and A.5-3 can be configured offline using the CSC-11
reference point.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Local UE settings for MCPTT
# B.1 Local UE settings for MCPTT
Table B.1-1 details local UE settings for MCPTT that represent important
functionalities that may be required by MCPTT UEs, however these
functionalities do not require central configuration like the parameters in
annex A, so these are detailed in this annex for information to UE vendors
interested in producing MCPTT UEs. The various columns in the tables have the
following meanings:
\- Reference: Is the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS
22.179 [2].
\- Definition: A short definition of the local UE setting.
