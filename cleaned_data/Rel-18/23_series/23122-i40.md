# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document gives an overview of the tasks undertaken by the Core
network protocols of a Mobile Station (MS) when in idle mode, that is,
switched on but typically not having a dedicated channel allocated. It also
describes the corresponding network functions. The idle mode functions are
also performed by a GPRS MS as long as no dedicated channel is allocated to
the MS. The conditions when the idle mode functions are performed by an MS in
the UTRA RRC connected mode states are specified in 3GPP TS 25.331 [33]. The
conditions when the idle mode functions are performed by an MS in the E-UTRAN
are specified in 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]. The conditions when the idle mode
functions are performed by an MS in the NG-RAN are specified in 3GPP TS 36.304
[43] and 3GPP TS 38.304 [61]. The conditions when the idle mode functions are
performed by an MS in the NG-RAN RRC inactive state are specified in 3GPP TS
36.331 [42] and 3GPP TS 38.331 [65].
The present document defines the PLMN selection for a multi mode MS that
supports both 3GPP and 3GPP2 systems. The common PLMN selection logic covers
also PLMNs that are available in 3GPP2 system, but the present document makes
no changes on the cdma2000^®^ signalling towards networks that are available
via 3GPP2 system.
The present document gives procedures for using the CSG cells, whenever such
use is permitted.
The present document gives procedures for using the CAG cells, when the MS
supports CAG.
The present document specifies the SNPN selection.
This 3GPP TS outlines how the requirements of the 22 series Technical
Specifications (especially 3GPP TS 22.011 [9]) on idle mode operation shall be
implemented. Further details are given in 3GPP TS 24.008 [23].
Clause 2 of this 3GPP TS gives a general description of the idle mode process.
Clause 3 outlines the main requirements and technical solutions of those
requirements. Clause 4 describes the processes used in idle mode. There is
inevitably some overlap between these clauses.
NOTE: cdma2000^®^ is a registered trademark of the Telecommunications Industry
Association (TIA-USA).
The present document describes the procedures for control plane solution of
steering of roaming in 5GS in annex C.
Annex C is applicable to the MS, the AMF, the UDM and the SOR-AF in the 5GS.
The present document does not consider GERAN Iu mode.

## 1.2 Definitions and abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations defined in 3GPP TR
21.905 [36] apply.
**(A/Gb mode only):** Indicates this clause applies only to a GSM system which
operates in A/Gb mode. For multi system case this is determined by the current
serving radio access network.
**(Iu mode only):** Indicates this clause applies only to UMTS. For multi
system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
NOTE 1: In accordance with the description of packet services in Iu mode in
3GPPS TS 24.008 [23], the terms \'CS/PS mode of operation\' and \'PS mode of
operation\' are not used in the present document. Instead the terms \'MS
operation mode A\' and \'MS operation mode C\' are used.
**(S1 mode only):** Indicates this clause applies only to an EPS. For multi
system case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
**Acceptable Cell:** This is a cell that the MS may camp on to make emergency
calls or to access RLOS. It must satisfy criteria which are defined for A/Gb
mode in 3GPP TS 43.022 [35], for Iu mode in 3GPP TS 25.304 [32], for S1 mode
in 3GPP TS 36.304 [43], and for NR access in N1 mode in 3GPP TS 38.304 [61]
and for E-UTRA access in N1 mode in 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]. For an MS in eCall
only mode, an acceptable cell must further satisfy the criteria defined in
clause 4.4.3.1.1.
**Access Technology:** The access technology associated with a PLMN or SNPN.
The MS uses this information to determine what type(s) of radio carrier to
search for when attempting to select a specific PLMN or SNPN The following
access technologies are defined: GSM, UTRAN, GSM COMPACT, EC-GSM-IoT, cdma2000
1xRTT, cdma2000 HRPD, E-UTRAN (WB-S1 mode and NB-S1 mode), NG-RAN, satellite
NG-RAN and satellite E-UTRAN (WB-S1 mode and NB-S1 mode). A PLMN may support
more than one access technology. SNPNs only support NG-RAN.
NOTE 2: Access technology \"E-UTRAN\" maps to core network type \"EPC\" and
access technology \"NG-RAN\" maps to core network type \"5GCN\", see 3GPP TS
24.501 [64].
**ACDC:** Application specific Congestion control for Data Communication, see
3GPP TS 22.011 [9].
**Allowable PLMN:** In the case of an MS operating in MS operation mode A or
B, this is a PLMN which is not in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" in the MS.
In the case of an MS operating in MS operation mode C or an MS not supporting
A/Gb mode and not supporting Iu mode, this is a PLMN which is not in the list
of \"forbidden PLMNs\" and not in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS
service\" in the MS.
**Allowable SNPN:** In the case of an MS operating in SNPN access operation
mode over 3GPP access and for an SNPN candidate not belongs to clause
4.9.3.1.1 bullet a0), this is an SNPN which is not in the list of
\"permanently forbidden SNPNs\" which is, if the MS supports access to an SNPN
using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both,
associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the
selected PLMN subscription, and is not in the list of \"temporarily forbidden
SNPNs\" which is, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from
a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, associated with the selected
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. In
the case of an MS operating in SNPN access mode and for an SNPN candidate
belongs to clause 4.9.3.1.1 bullet a0), this is an SNPN which is not in the
list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in
SNPN\" which is associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber
data\" or the selected PLMN subscription, and is not in the list of
\"temporarily forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\"
which is associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\"
or the selected PLMN subscription.
**Allowable PLMN/access technology** **combination:** For an MS operating in
MS operation mode C or an MS not supporting A/Gb mode and not supporting Iu
mode, this is an allowable PLMN in any specific access technology. For an MS
operating in MS operation mode A or B, this is a PLMN/access technology
combination where:
\- the PLMN is an allowable PLMN and the specific access technology is
supporting non-GPRS services; or
\- the PLMN is not in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" and not in the list of
\"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" in the MS and the specific access
technology is only supporting GPRS services.
EXAMPLE: E-UTRAN, satellite E-UTRAN, satellite NG-RAN (see 3GPP TS 22.261
[74]) and NG-RAN are access technologies that are only supporting GPRS
services.

PLMN in a specific access technology.
**CAG-ID authorized based on \"Allowed CAG list\":** A CAG-ID in an \"Allowed
CAG list\", without a time validity information, or with a time validity
information with at least one time period matching UE\'s current time.
**Camped on a cell:** The MS (ME if there is no SIM) has completed the cell
selection/reselection process and has chosen a cell from which it plans to
receive all available services. Note that the services may be limited, and
that the PLMN or the SNPN may not be aware of the existence of the MS (ME)
within the chosen cell.
**Country: A country is identified by a single MCC value defined in ITU-T**
**recommendation** **E.212** **[76], with the exception of the following MCC
ranges that identify a single country:**
\- values 310 through 316 (USA);
\- values 404 through 406 (India);
\- values 440 through 441 (Japan);
\- values 460 through 461 (China); and
\- values 234 through 235 (United Kingdom).
**Permitted CSG list:** See 3GPP TS 36.304 [43].
**Current serving cell:** This is the cell on which the MS is camped.
**CTS MS:** An MS capable of CTS services is a CTS MS.
Discontinuous coverage: Deployment option for satellite E-UTRAN access, in
which shorter periods of satellite E-UTRAN access radio coverage are followed
by longer periods of satellite E-UTRAN access coverage gaps. During coverage
gaps, the access stratum may be deactivated. For more details see 3GPP TS
23.401 [58] and 3GPP TS 36.304 [43].
**EAB:** Extended Access Barring, see 3GPP TS 22.011 [9].
**Extended Coverage in GSM for Internet of Things (EC-GSM-IoT):** Extended
coverage in GSM for IoT is a feature which enables extended coverage
operation. See 3GPP TS 43.064 [55].
**EHPLMN:** Any of the PLMN entries contained in the Equivalent HPLMN list.
**Equivalent HPLMN list:** To allow provision for multiple HPLMN codes, PLMN
codes that are present within this list shall replace the HPLMN code derived
from the IMSI for PLMN selection purposes. This list is stored on the USIM and
is known as the EHPLMN list. The EHPLMN list may also contain the HPLMN code
derived from the IMSI. If the HPLMN code derived from the IMSI is not present
in the EHPLMN list then it shall be treated as a Visited PLMN for PLMN
selection purposes.
**Generic Access Network (GAN):** See 3GPP TS 43.318 [35A].
**GAN mode:** See 3GPP TS 43.318 [35A].
**GPRS MS:** An MS capable of GPRS services is a GPRS MS.
**MS operation mode:** See 3GPP TS 23.060 [27].
**High quality signal:** The high quality signal limit is used in the PLMN
selection procedure. It is defined in the appropriate AS specification: 3GPP
TS 43.022 [35] for the GSM radio access technology, 3GPP TS 25.304 [32] for
the UMTS radio access technology (FDD or TDD mode), 3GPP TS 36.304 [43] for
the E‑UTRAN radio access technology (WB-S1 mode, NB-S1 mode, WB-N1 mode or
NB-N1 mode), 3GPP TS 36.304 [43] and 3GPP TS 38.304 [61] for the NG-RAN radio
access technology. For 3GPP2 access technologies the high quality signal limit
is defined in 3GPP2 C.S0011 [45] for cdma2000^®^ 1xRTT and in 3GPP2 C.S0033
[46] for cdma2000^®^ HRPD. A mobile station attempting to find a cell that
supports EC-GSM-IoT (see 3GPP TS 43.064 [55]) does not use high quality signal
limit in the PLMN selection procedure, i.e. for the purpose of PLMN selection,
when attempting to find a cell that supports EC-GSM-IoT, any found cell
supporting EC-GSM-IoT is considered to be received with high quality signal. A
UE attempting to find a cell that supports enhanced coverage when operating in
any WB-S1 or WB-N1 enhanced coverage mode does not use high quality signal
limit in the PLMN selection procedure, i.e. for the purpose of PLMN selection,
when attempting to find a cell that supports enhanced coverage, any found cell
supporting enhanced coverage and satisfying the coverage specific quality
signal limit defined for CE mode (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]) is considered to be
received with high quality signal.
**Home PLMN:** This is a PLMN where the MCC and MNC of the PLMN identity match
the MCC and MNC of the IMSI. Matching criteria are defined in Annex A.
**In A/Gb mode:** Indicates this clause applies only to a GSM system which
operates in A/Gb mode. For multi system case this is determined by the current
serving radio access network.
**In Iu mode:** Indicates this clause applies only to UMTS. For multi system
case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
**In N1 mode:** Indicates this clause applies only to an 5GS. For multi system
case this is determined by the current serving radio access network.
**In NB-N1 mode:** Indicates this paragraph applies only to a system which
operates in NB-N1 mode. For a multi-access system this case applies if the
current serving radio access network provides access to 5G network services
via E-UTRA connected to 5GCN by NB-IoT (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [56], 3GPP TS
36.331 [42], 3GPP TS 36.306 [54]).
**In WB-N1 mode:** Indicates this paragraph applies only to a system which
operates in WB-N1 mode. For a multi-access system this case applies if the
system operates in N1 mode with E-UTRA connected to 5GCN, but not in NB-N1
mode.
**In S1 mode:** Indicates this clause applies only to an EPS. The S1 mode
includes WB-S1 mode and NB-S1 mode. For multi system case this is determined
by the current serving radio access network.
**In NB-S1 mode:** Indicates this paragraph applies only to a system which
operates in NB-S1 mode. For a multi-access system this case applies if the
current serving radio access network provides access to network services via
E-UTRA by NB-IoT (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [56], 3GPP TS 36.331 [22], 3GPP TS 36.306
[54]).
**In WB-S1 mode:** Indicates this paragraph applies only to a system which
operates in WB-S1 mode. For a multi-access system this case applies if the
system operates in S1 mode, but not in NB-S1 mode.
**Limited Service State:** See clause 3.5.
**Localised Service Area (LSA):** A localised service area consists of a cell
or a number of cells. The cells constituting a LSA may not necessarily provide
contiguous coverage.
**Localized services in NPN:** Localized services in NPN are services, which
are provided by an NPN at specific or limited area, are bounded in time, or
both.
**Localized services in SNPN:** Localized services in SNPN are localized
services in NPN, which are provided by an SNPN at specific or limited area,
are bounded in time, or both.
**Location Registration (LR):** An MS which is IMSI attached to non-GPRS
services only performs location registration by the location updating
procedure. A GPRS MS which is IMSI attached to GPRS services or to GPRS and
non-GPRS services performs location registration by the routing area update
procedure only when in a network of network operation mode I. Both location
updating and routing area update procedures are performed independently by the
GPRS MS when it is IMSI attached to GPRS and non-GPRS services in a network of
network operation mode II (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [27]). An MS which is attached
via the E-UTRAN performs location registration by the tracking area update
procedure. An MS which is registered via the NG-RAN performs location
registration by the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
**MINT: Minimization of service interruption (see 3GPP TS 22.261 [71]).**
**MS:** Mobile Station. The present document makes no distinction between MS
and UE.
**N1 mode capability:** Capability of the UE associated with an N1 NAS
signalling connection between the UE and network. The present document refers
to the N1 mode capability over 3GPP access only (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
**NarrowBand Internet of Things (NB-IoT):** NB-IoT is a non-backward
compatible variant of E-UTRAN supporting a reduced set of functionality. NB-
IoT allows access to EPC or 5GCN network services via E-UTRA with a channel
bandwidth limited to 180 kHz (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [20], 3GPP TS 36.331 [42],
3GPP TS 36.306 [44]).
**Network Type:** The network type associated with HPLMN or a PLMN on the PLMN
selector (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]). The MS uses this information to determine
what type of radio carrier to search for when attempting to select a specific
PLMN. A PLMN may support more than one network type.
**Onboarding services in SNPN** : Onboarding services in SNPN allow an MS to
access an SNPN indicating that onboarding is allowed, using default UE
credentials for primary authentication in order for the MS to be configured
with one or more entries of the \"list of subscriber data\".
NOTE 3: When the MS is registered for onboarding services in SNPN, services
other than the onboarding services in SNPN are not available. When the MS is
not registered for onboarding services in SNPN, onboarding services in SNPN
are not available.
**MS determined PLMN with disaster condition:** A PLMN to which a disaster
condition applies, determined as described in clause 4.4.3.1.1.
**Registered PLMN (RPLMN):** This is the PLMN on which certain LR outcomes
have occurred (see table 1). In a shared network the RPLMN is the PLMN defined
by the PLMN identity of the CN operator that has accepted the LR.
**Registered SNPN (RSNPN):** This is the SNPN on which certain LR outcomes
have occurred. In a shared network the RSNPN is the SNPN defined by the SNPN
identity of the CN operator that has accepted the LR.
**Registration:** This is the process of camping on a cell of the PLMN or the
SNPN and doing any necessary LRs.
**Registration Area:** A registration area is an area in which mobile stations
may roam without a need to perform location registration. The registration
area corresponds to location area (LA) for performing location updating
procedure, to routing area for performing the GPRS attach or routing area
update procedures, and to a list of tracking areas (TAs) for performing the
EPS attach, tracking area update, or 5GS registration procedure.

# 2 General description of idle mode
When an MS is switched on, it attempts to make contact with a public land
mobile network (PLMN) or stand-alone non-public network (SNPN). The particular
PLMN or SNPN to be contacted may be selected either automatically or manually.
The MS looks for a suitable cell of the chosen PLMN or SNPN and chooses that
cell to provide available services, and tunes to its control channel. This
choosing is known as \"camping on the cell\". The MS will then register its
presence in the registration area of the chosen cell if necessary, by means of
a location registration (LR), GPRS attach, IMSI attach or registration
procedure.
If the MS loses coverage of a cell, or find a more suitable cell, it reselects
onto the most suitable cell of the selected PLMN or SNPN and camps on that
cell. If the new cell is in a different registration area, an LR request is
performed.
If the MS loses coverage of a PLMN or SNPN, either a new PLMN or SNPN is
selected automatically, or an indication of which PLMNs or SNPNs are available
is given to the user, so that a manual selection can be made.
Registration is not performed by MSs only capable of services that need no
registration.
The purpose of camping on a cell in idle mode is fourfold:
a) It enables the MS to receive system information from the PLMN or SNPN.
b) If the MS wishes to initiate a call, it can do this by initially accessing
the network on the control channel of the cell on which it is camped.
c) If the PLMN or SNPN receives a call for the MS, it knows (in most cases)
the registration area of the cell in which the MS is camped. It can then send
a \"paging\" message for the MS on control channels of all the cells in the
registration area. The MS will then receive the paging message because it is
tuned to the control channel of a cell in that registration area, and the MS
can respond on that control channel.
d) It enables the MS to receive cell broadcast messages.
If the MS is unable to find a suitable cell to camp on, or the SIM is not
inserted, or there is no valid entry in \"list of subscriber data\" in case
the MS is operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access, or if it
receives certain responses to an LR request (e.g., \"illegal MS\"), it
attempts to camp on a cell irrespective of the PLMN identity or the SNPN
identity, and enters a \"limited service\" state in which it can only attempt
to make emergency calls or to access RLOS. An MS operating in NB-S1 mode,
never attempts to make emergency calls or to access RLOS. An MS operating in
N1 mode never attempts to access RLOS.
If the MS is in eCall only mode, it attempts to camp on a suitable cell and
enters an \"eCall inactive\" state in which it can only attempt an eCall over
IMS, or a call to a non-emergency MSISDN or URI for test or terminal
reconfiguration services as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [40].
If the MS is in eCall only mode and is unable to find a suitable cell to camp
on, it attempts to camp on an acceptable cell in limited service state, and
enters an \"eCall inactive\" state in which it can only attempt an eCall over
IMS.
While in eCall inactive state, the MS does not perform LR with the PLMN of the
cell on which the MS is camped.
In A/Gb mode, if the CTS MS is in CTS mode only or in automatic mode with CTS
preferred, it will start by attempting to find a CTS fixed part on which it is
enrolled.
The idle mode tasks can be subdivided into the following processes:
\- PLMN selection;
\- SNPN selection (N1 mode only);
\- CSG selection (Iu mode and S1 mode only);
\- Cell selection and reselection;
\- Location registration;
\- CTS fixed part selection (A/Gb mode only); and
\- CAG selection (N1 mode only).
In A/Gb mode, to make this initial CTS fixed part selection, the MS shall be
enrolled on at least one fixed part.
Except for SNPN selection, the relationship between these processes is
illustrated in figure 1 in clause 5. The states and state transitions within
each process are shown in figure 2a, figure 2b, and figure 3 in clause 5.
# 3 Requirements and technical solutions
## 3.0 General
The following clauses list the main requirements of idle mode operation and
give an outline of the technical solution.
## 3.1 PLMN selection and roaming
The MS normally operates on its home PLMN (HPLMN) or equivalent home PLMN
(EHPLMN). However, a visited PLMN (VPLMN) may be selected, e.g., if the MS
loses coverage. There are two modes for PLMN selection:
i) Automatic mode ‑ This mode utilizes a list of PLMN/access technology
combinations in priority order. The highest priority PLMN/access technology
combination which is available and allowable is selected.
ii) Manual mode ‑ Here the MS indicates to the user which PLMNs are available.
Only when the user makes a manual selection does the MS try to obtain normal
service on the VPLMN.
To prevent repeated attempts to have roaming service on a not allowed area
(i.e. LA or TA), when the MS is informed that an area is forbidden, the LA or
TA is added to a list of \"forbidden location areas for roaming\" or
\"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" respectively which is stored in the
MS. These lists, if existing, are deleted when the MS is switched off or when
the SIM is removed, and periodically (with period in the range 12 to 24
hours). LA area restrictions are always valid for complete location areas
independent of possible subdivision into GPRS routing areas. The structure of
the routing area identifier (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [22A]) supports area
restriction on LA basis.
To prevent repeated attempts to obtain service on a PLMN through satellite NG-
RAN or satellite E-UTRAN access technology, when the MS receives an integrity
protected reject message with cause value #78 \"PLMNs not allowed to operate
at the present UE location\" from a satellite NG-RAN cell or a satellite
E-UTRAN cell, the MS maintains a list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the
present UE location\" in which it stores the PLMN ID of the rejecting PLMN,
the current geographical location, if known by the MS. A timer is started when
the PLMN ID of the rejecting PLMN is added to the list of \"PLMNs not allowed
to operate at the present UE location\". If the geographical location exists,
a MS implementation specific distance value needs to be stored. An entry in
the list is deleted if the timer associated to the entry expires or the MS
successfully registers to the PLMN stored in the entry. An entry in the list
may be deleted if the current UE location is known, a geographical location is
stored for the entry of this PLMN, and the distance to the current UE location
is larger than a UE implementation specific value. For details see 3GPP TS
24.501 [64] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A].
NOTE 1: The list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE
location\" is provided to the AS, see 3GPP TS 38.304 [61].
In automatic PLMN selection mode, if the MS detects a PLMN in satellite NG-RAN
access technology which is part of the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate
at the present UE location\" the MS shall consider the PLMN as PLMN selection
candidate for satellite NG-RAN access technology only if the current MS
location is known, a geographical location is stored for the entry of this
PLMN, and the distance to the current MS location is larger than a MS
implementation specific value.
This does not prevent selection of such a PLMN if it is available in another
RAT.
A timer is started when the PLMN ID of the rejecting PLMN is added to the list
of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\".
In automatic PLMN selection mode, if the MS detects a PLMN in satellite
E-UTRAN access technology which is part of the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to
operate at the present UE location\" the MS shall consider the PLMN as PLMN
selection candidate for satellite E-UTRAN access technology only if the
current MS location is known, a geographical location is stored for the entry
of this PLMN, and the distance to the current UE location is larger than a UE
implementation specific value.
This does not prevent selection of such a PLMN if it is available in another
RAT.
If a message with cause value #15 (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [23], 3GPP TS 24.301
[23A] and 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) is received by an MS, then the MS shall take
the following actions depending on the mode in which the message was received:
A/Gb mode or Iu mode:
The location area is added to the list of \"forbidden location areas for
roaming\" which is stored in the MS. The MS shall then search for a suitable
cell in the same PLMN but belonging to an LA or TA which is not in the
\"forbidden location areas for roaming\" or \"forbidden tracking areas for
roaming\" list respectively.
S1-mode:
The tracking area is added to the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for
roaming\" which is stored in the MS. The MS shall then search for a suitable
cell in the same PLMN but belonging to a TA or LA which is not in the
\"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" or \"forbidden location areas for
roaming\" list respectively
N1-mode:
The tracking area is added to the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for
roaming\" which is stored in the MS. The MS shall then search for a suitable
cell in the same PLMN but belonging to a tracking area which is not in the
\"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" list.
In manual or automatic mode, a VPLMN is added to a list of \"forbidden PLMNs\"
in the SIM if a message with cause value \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"Requested
service option not authorized in this PLMN\" or \"Serving network not
authorized\" is received by an MS in response to an LR request from that VPLMN
and:
\- the MS is configured to use timer T3245 as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [23],
3GPP TS 24.301 [23A], and 3GPP TS 24.501 [64];
\- the MS is not configured to use timer T3245 and the message is integrity-
protected;
\- the MS is not configured to use timer T3245, the message is not integrity-
protected and the MS does not maintain a list of PLMN-specific attempt
counters; or
\- the MS is not configured to use timer T3245, the message is not integrity-
protected, the MS maintains a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters and the
value of the PLMN-specific attempt counter for that VPLMN is equal to the MS
implementation specific maximum value as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [23], 3GPP
TS 24.301 [23A] and 3GPP TS 24.501 [64].
If:
\- after a subsequent manual selection of that PLMN, there is a successful LR
not for disaster roaming services, then the PLMN is removed from the
\"forbidden PLMNs\" list;
\- the MS is configured to use timer T3245 and the timer T3245 expires, then
the PLMN is removed from the \"forbidden PLMNs\" list ; or
\- the MS is not configured to use timer T3245 and:
1) the MS maintains a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters, the value of the
PLMN-specific attempt counter for that PLMN is greater than zero and less than
the MS implementation specific maximum value, and timer T3247 expires, then
the PLMN is removed from the \"forbidden PLMNs\" list stored in memory as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A] and 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]; or
2) the MS does not maintain a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters, the PLMN
is stored in the \"forbidden PLMNs\" list in the SIM, and the timer T3247
expires, then the PLMN is removed from the \"forbidden PLMNs\" list in the SIM
as defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A].
This list is retained when the MS is switched off or the SIM is removed. The
HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or an EHPLMN (if the
EHPLMN list is present) shall not be stored on the list of \"forbidden
PLMNs\".
In A/Gb mode, an ME not supporting SoLSA may consider a cell with the escape
PLMN code (see 3GPP TS 23.073) to be a part of a PLMN belonging to the list of
\"forbidden PLMNs\".
Optionally the ME may store in its memory an extension of the \"forbidden
PLMNs\" list. The contents of the extension of the list shall be deleted when
the MS is switched off or the SIM is removed.
A VPLMN may be stored in the extension of the \"forbidden PLMNs\" list if a
message with cause value \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"Requested service option
not authorized in this PLMN\" or \"Serving network not authorized\" is
received by an MS in response to an LR request from that VPLMN, and the
following is valid:
\- the MS is not configured to use timer T3245, the message is not integrity-
protected, the MS maintains a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters and the
value of the PLMN-specific attempt counter for that VPLMN is less than an MS
implementation specific maximum value as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [23], 3GPP
TS 24.301 [23A] and 3GPP TS 24.501 [64].
In manual or automatic mode, if a message with cause value \"GPRS services not
allowed in this PLMN\" or \"EPS services not allowed in this PLMN\" is
received by an MS in response to an GPRS attach, routing area update, EPS
attach or tracking area update request or received in a network initiated GPRS
detach or EPS detach request (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [23] and 3GPP TS 24.301
[23A]) from a VPLMN, that VPLMN is added to a list of \"forbidden PLMNs for
GPRS service\" which is stored in the MS. This list is deleted when the MS is
switched off or when the SIM is removed. A PLMN is removed from the list of
\"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" if:
\- after a subsequent manual selection of that PLMN, there is a successful
GPRS attach, routing area update, EPS attach, tracking area update or
registration procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]);
\- the MS is configured to use timer T3245 and timer T3245 expires; or
\- the MS is not configured to use timer T3245, the MS maintains a list of
PLMN-specific PS-attempt counters as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [23] and 3GPP
TS 24.301 [23A], the value of the PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter for that
PLMN has a value greater than zero and less than the MS implementation-
specific maximum value as defined in clause 5.3.7b in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A],
and T3247 expires.
The maximum number of possible entries in this list is implementation
dependant, but must be at least one entry. The HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is
not present or is empty) or an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present) shall
not be stored on the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\".
An MS that is attaching for emergency bearer services or for access to RLOS,
or is attached for emergency bearer services or for access to RLOS, may access
PLMNs in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" or the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for
GPRS service\". The MS shall not remove any entry from the list of \"forbidden
PLMNs\" or the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" as a result of
such accesses.
An MS that is registered for disaster roaming services, may access PLMNs in
the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" or the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS
service\" following the criteria as specified in clause 4.4.3.1.1 and shall
not remove any entry from the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" or the list of
\"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" as a result of such accesses.
A UE capable of S101 mode maintains a list \"forbidden PLMNs for attach in
S101 mode\"; the properties and handling in NAS signalling is defined in
clause 5.3.3 of 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A].
If the MS is in GAN mode and a \"Location not allowed\" message is received
(see 3GPP TS 44.318 [35B]), then the MS may attempt to select another PLMN so
that further GAN registrations may again be attempted. The selection of the
PLMN either automatically or manually is implementation dependent.
If an MS that has disabled its E-UTRA capability re-enables it when PLMN
selection is performed, then the MS of which usage setting is \"voice
centric\":
\- should, for duration of timer TD, memorize the PLMNs where E-UTRA
capability was disabled as PLMNs where voice service was not possible in
E-UTRAN. The number of PLMNs where voice service was not possible in E-UTRAN
that the MS can store is implementation specific, but it shall be at least
one. The value of timer TD is MS implementation specific, but shall not exceed
the maximum possible value of background scanning timer T as specified in
clause 4.4.3.3.1.
\- in automatic PLMN selection, shall not consider PLMNs where voice service
was not possible in E-UTRAN as PLMN selection candidates for E-UTRA access
technology, unless no other PLMN is available. This does not prevent selection
of such a PLMN if it is available in another RAT; and
\- shall delete stored information on PLMNs where voice service was not
possible in E-UTRAN when the MS is switched off, the USIM is removed, timer TD
expires or MS voice domain configuration changes so that E-UTRA capability
disabling is no longer necessary.
The MS may support \"E-UTRA Disabling for EMM cause #15\" as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.301 [23A]. If the MS supports \"E-UTRA Disabling for EMM cause #15\" and
the \"E-UTRA Disabling Allowed for EMM cause #15\" parameter as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [50] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [40] is present and set to enabled:
\- the MS shall maintain a list of \"PLMNs with E-UTRAN not allowed\";
\- when the MS disables its E-UTRA capability on a PLMN due to E-UTRAN not
allowed, it shall add the PLMN to the \"PLMNs with E-UTRAN not allowed\" list,
and start timer TE if timer TE is not already running;
\- the number of PLMNs that the MS can store in the \"PLMNs with E-UTRAN not
allowed\" list is implementation specific, but it shall be at least one;
\- the value of timer TE is MS implementation specific, but it shall not
exceed the maximum possible value of background scanning timer T (8 hours or
240 hours for MSs supporting EC-GSM-IoT, Category M1 or Category NB1 as
defined in 3GPP TS 36.306 [54])) as specified in clause 4.4.3.3.1;
\- in automatic PLMN selection the MS shall not consider PLMNs included in the
\"PLMNs with E-UTRAN not allowed\" list as PLMN selection candidates for
E-UTRAN access technology, unless no other PLMN is available. This does not
prevent selection of such a PLMN if it is available in another RAT; and
\- the MS shall delete stored information in the \"PLMNs with E-UTRAN not
allowed\" list when the MS is switched off, the USIM is removed or timer TE
expires.
The MS should maintain a list of PLMNs where the N1 mode capability was
disabled because IMS voice was not available and the MS\'s usage setting was
\"voice centric\" as PLMNs where voice service was not possible in N1 mode.
When the MS disables its N1 mode capability because IMS voice was not
available and the MS\'s usage setting was \"voice centric\":
\- the MS should add the identity of the PLMN to the list of PLMNs where voice
service was not possible in N1 mode and should start timer TF if timer TF is
not already running. The number of PLMNs that the MS can store where voice
services is not possible is implementation specific, but it shall be at least
one. The value of timer TF is MS implementation specific, but shall not exceed
the maximum possible value of background scanning timer T as specified in
clause 4.4.3.3.1;
\- in automatic PLMN selection the MS shall not consider PLMNs where voice
service was not possible in N1 mode as PLMN selection candidates for NG-RAN
access technology, unless no other PLMN is available. This does not prevent
selection of such a PLMN if it is available in another RAT; and
\- the MS shall delete stored information on PLMNs where voice service was not
possible in N1 mode when the MS is switched off, the USIM is removed, timer TF
expires or the MS\'s usage setting changes so that N1 mode capability
disabling is no longer necessary.
The MS should maintain a list of PLMNs where the N1 mode capability was
disabled due to receipt of a reject from the network with 5GMM cause #27 \"N1
mode not allowed\", as PLMNs where N1 mode is not allowed for 3GPP access.
When the MS disables its N1 mode capability due to receipt of a reject from
the network with 5GMM cause #27 \"N1 mode not allowed\":
\- the MS should add the identity of the PLMN to the list of PLMNs where N1
mode is not allowed for 3GPP access and should start timer TG if timer TG is
not already running. The number of PLMNs that the MS can store where N1 mode
is not allowed for 3GPP access is implementation specific, but it shall be at
least one. The value of timer TG is MS implementation specific, but shall not
exceed the maximum possible value of background scanning timer T as specified
in clause 4.4.3.3.1;
\- in automatic PLMN selection the MS shall not consider PLMNs where N1 mode
is not allowed for 3GPP access as PLMN selection candidates for NG-RAN access
technology, unless no other PLMN is available. This does not prevent selection
of such a PLMN if it is available in another RAT;
\- if the MS is not configured to use timer T3245, the MS maintains a list of
PLMN-specific N1 mode attempt counters for 3GPP access as specified in 3GPP TS
24.501 [64] and T3247 expires, then the MS removes for each PLMN-specific N1
mode attempt counter for 3GPP access that has a value greater than zero and
less than the MS implementation-specific maximum value the respective PLMN
from the list of PLMNs where N1 mode is not allowed for 3GPP access, as
specified in clause 5.3.20.2 in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]; and
\- the MS shall delete stored information on PLMNs where N1 mode is not
allowed for 3GPP access when the MS is switched off, the USIM is removed or
timer TG expires.
NOTE 2: The expiry of timer TG does not cause a reset of the PLMN-specific N1
mode attempt counters for 3GPP access (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
NOTE 3: If an access technology is disabled for a PLMN that is part of the
list of \"equivalent PLMNs\", the UE implementation ensures that registration
to a different PLMN within the list of \"equivalent PLMNs\" does not result in
reselection or inter-system change to the disabled access technology of that
PLMN.
The MS in NB-S1 mode may maintain a list of \"PLMNs with NB-IoT not allowed\"
where the NB-IoT capability was disabled due to receipt of a reject from the
network with EMM cause #15 \"no suitable cells in tracking area\" and an
Extended EMM cause IE with value \"NB-IoT not allowed\", as PLMNs where NB-S1
mode is not allowed. When the MS disables its NB-IoT capability due to receipt
of a reject from the network with EMM cause #15 \"no suitable cells in
tracking area\" and an Extended EMM cause IE with value \"NB-IoT not
allowed\":
\- the MS may add the identity of the PLMN to the list of \"PLMNs with NB-IoT
not allowed\" and start timer TH if timer TH is not already running. The
number of PLMNs that the MS can store in the \"PLMNs with NB-IoT not allowed\"
list is implementation specific, but it shall be at least one. The value of
timer TH is MS implementation specific, but shall not exceed the maximum
possible value of background scanning timer T as specified in clause
4.4.3.3.1;
\- in automatic PLMN selection the MS shall not consider PLMNs included in the
\"PLMNs with NB-IoT not allowed\" list as PLMN selection candidates for the
access technology E-UTRAN in NB-S1 mode, unless no other PLMN is available.
This does not prevent selection of such a PLMN if it is available in another
RAT; and
\- the MS shall delete stored information in the \"PLMNs with NB-IoT not
allowed\" list when the MS is switched off, the USIM is removed or timer TH
expires.
## 3.1A CSG selection / restriction
If the MS supports CSG, it is provisioned with an Allowed CSG list and an
Operator CSG list and associated PLMN identities. Both lists can be retrieved
either from the USIM if the lists are available in the USIM, or as described
in 3GPP TS 24.285 [47] if the lists are not available in the USIM. These lists
have zero or more entries.
NOTE 1: The network also updates the Allowed CSG list in the same updating
operation if one or more entries are removed from the Operator CSG list. This
avoids an entry removed from the Operator CSG list remaining in the Allowed
CSG list.
There are two modes of CSG selection:
\- Automatic mode: This mode utilizes the Allowed CSG list and the Operator
CSG list. After a PLMN is selected, the MS camps on a cell in that PLMN only
if the cell is either not a CSG cell or it is a CSG cell with a CSG identity
that is in the Allowed CSG list or in the Operator CSG List. The idle mode
procedures of NAS are not impacted by this mode. Upon switch on the MS is in
automatic mode.
\- Manual mode: In this mode, the MS indicates to the user a list of available
CSGs and the associated PLMNs. Based on configuration by the HPLMN, the list
of CSGs provided to the user for a certain PLMN is either:
\- not restricted by the Allowed CSG list and the Operator CSG List stored in
the MS; or
\- restricted to entries in the Operator CSG List only.
After the user makes a selection, the MS camps on a cell with the selected CSG
identity and may attempt to register with the associated PLMN (see 3GPP TS
24.008 [23] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A]).
The permitted CSG list is a combination of Operator CSG list and the Allowed
CSG list. NAS shall provide the permitted CSG list to the AS. If the contents
of the permitted CSG list have changed, NAS shall provide an updated permitted
CSG list to the AS.
NOTE 2: The same CSG ID and its associated PLMN can exist in both the Operator
CSG list and the Allowed CSG list. Such duplicates can be removed when
combining these lists to form the permitted CSG list.
If an integrity protected message with cause value #25 (see 3GPP TS 24.008
[23] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A]) is received by an MS for a CSG ID and
associated PLMN identity present in the Operator CSG list, then for an
implementation dependent time which is not shorter than 60 minutes, or until
the MS is switched off, or the SIM/USIM is removed, or the Operator CSG list
is updated:
a) The NAS shall not include this CSG ID and the associated PLMN identity in
the permitted CSG list provided to the AS; and
b) In CSG manual mode selection, the MS shall not indicate to the user that
this CSG ID and the associated PLMN identity is in the Operator CSG List
stored in the MS.
NOTE 3: As an implementation option, the user can be informed that the MS has
not been authorized for a CSG included in the Operator CSG list.
## 3.1B PLMN selection triggered by ProSe communications
If the MS supports ProSe communications and needs to perform PLMN selection
for ProSe communications as specified in 3GPP TS 24.334 [51] or 3GPP TS 24.554
[80], then the MS shall proceed as follows:
i) the MS shall store a duplicate value of the RPLMN and a duplicate of the
PLMN selection mode that were in use before PLMN selection due to ProSe
communications was initiated, unless this PLMN selection due to ProSe
communications follows another PLMN selection due to ProSe communications or a
manual CSG selection as specified in clause 4.4.3.1.3.3;
ii) the MS shall enter into Automatic mode of PLMN selection as specified in
clause 4.4 taking into account the additional requirements in items iii) to x)
below;
iii) among the PLMNs advertised by the E-UTRA cell or NR cell operating in the
radio resources provisioned to the MS for ProSe communications as specified in
3GPP TS 24.333 [52], 3GPP TS 24.555 [81] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [40], the MS shall
choose one allowable PLMN which meets:
1) the following:
\- is advertised by the E-UTRA cell;
\- provides radio resources for ProSe communications over E-UTRA PC5;
\- is in the list of authorised PLMNs for ProSe communications as specified in
3GPP TS 24.334 [51]; and
\- is not in the list of \"PLMNs with E-UTRAN not allowed\" as specified in
clause 3.1; or
2) the following:
\- is advertised by the NR cell;
\- provides radio resources for 5G ProSe communications over NR PC5;
\- is in the list of authorised PLMNs for 5G ProSe communications over PC5 as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.554 [80];
\- is the advertised PLMN(s) of the 5G ProSe layer-2 UE-to-network relay UE if
the MS is acting as a 5G ProSe layer-2 remote UE;
\- is not in the list of PLMNs where the N1 mode capability was disabled due
to IMS voice not available and the MS\'s usage setting was \"voice centric\"
as PLMNs where voice service was not possible; and
\- is not in the list of PLMNs where the N1 mode capability was disabled due
to receipt of a reject from the network with 5GMM cause #27 \"N1 mode not
allowed\" in N1 mode as specified in clause 3.1;
if either condition 1) or condition 2) above is met then the MS shall attempt
to register on that PLMN. If none of the PLMNs meet either condition 1) or
condition2) above, the MS shall return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection
mode and use the stored duplicate value of RPLMN for further action;
iv) if the registration fails due to \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"EPS services
not allowed\" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.334 [51], or due to \"PLMN not
allowed\" or \"5GS services not allowed\" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.554 [80],
then the MS shall update the appropriate list of forbidden PLMNs as specified
in clause 3.1, and shall either:
A) if the PLMN provides common radio resources needed by the MS to do ProSe
communications as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331 [42] or 3GPP TS 38.331 [65],
perform ProSe communications on the selected PLMN in limited service state. In
this case the MS shall not search for available and allowable PLMNs during the
duration of ProSe communications;
B) return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action; or
C) perform the action described in iii) again with the choice of PLMNs further
excluding the PLMNs on which the MS has failed to register.
Whether the MS performs A), B) or C) above is left up to MS implementation.
v) if the registration fails due to causes other than \"PLMN not allowed\" or
\"EPS services not allowed\" or \"5GS services not allowed\", the MS shall:
\- if the handling of the failure requires updating a list of forbidden PLMNs,
update the appropriate list (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A] or 3GPP TS
24.501 [64]); and
\- if the handling of the failure does not require updating a list of
forbidden PLMNs (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A] or 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]),
remember the PLMN as a PLMN on which the MS has failed to register;
NOTE 1: How long the MS memorizes the PLMNs on which it has failed to register
is implementation dependent.
and the MS shall either:
A1) return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action;
B1) perform the action described in iii) again with the choice of PLMNs
further excluding the PLMNs on which the MS has failed to register; or
C1) perform ProSe communications in limited service state on a PLMN advertised
by the cell operating in the radio resources provisioned to the MS for ProSe
communications as specified in 3GPP TS 24.333 [52], 3GPP TS 24.555 [81] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [40], if registration on this PLMN has previously failed due to
\"PLMN not allowed\" or \"EPS services not allowed\" as specified in 3GPP TS
24.334 [51] or due to \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"5GS services not allowed\" as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.554 [80] and if this PLMN provides common radio
resources needed by the MS to do ProSe communications as specified in 3GPP TS
36.331 [42] or 3GPP TS 38.331 [65]. In this case the MS shall not search for
available and allowable PLMNs during the duration of ProSe communications;
Whether the MS performs A1), B1) or C1) above is left up to MS implementation.
vi) if the MS is no longer in the coverage of the selected PLMN, then the MS
shall either:
A2) perform ProSe communications procedures for MS to use provisioned radio
resources as specified in 3GPP TS 24.334 [51] or 3GPP TS 24.554 [80]; or
B2) return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action.
Whether the MS performs A2) or B2) above is left up to MS implementation.
vii) if the MS is unable to find a suitable cell on the selected PLMN as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.334 [51], then the MS shall either:
A3) if the PLMN provides common radio resources needed by the MS to do ProSe
communications as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331 [42] or 3GPP TS 38.331 [65],
perform ProSe communications on the selected PLMN in limited service state. In
this case the MS shall not search for available and allowable PLMNs during the
duration of ProSe communications; or
B3) return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action.
Whether the MS performs A3) or B3) above is left up to MS implementation.
viii) if the MS is switched off while on the selected PLMN and switched on
again, the MS shall use the stored duplicate value of RPLMN as RPLMN and
behave as specified in clause 4.4.3.1;
ix) if the user initiates a PLMN selection while on the selected cell, the MS
shall delete the stored duplicate value of PLMN selection mode, use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN as RPLMN and follow the procedures (as specified for
switch-on or recovery from lack of coverage) in clause 4.4.3.1. The MS shall
delete the stored duplicate value of RPLMN once the MS has successfully
registered to the selected PLMN; and
x) if the MS no longer needs to perform Prose communications, the MS shall
return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action.
NOTE 2: If the MS returns to the RPLMN due to a failure to register in the
selected PLMN, the upper layers of the MS can trigger PLMN selection again to
initiate ProSe communications.
If the PLMN selected for ProSe communications is a VPLMN, the MS shall not
periodically scan for higher priority PLMNs during the duration of ProSe
communications.
The solution to prevent potential ping-pong between the RPLMN and the PLMN
selected for ProSe communications is MS implementation specific.
## 3.1C PLMN selection triggered by V2X communication over PC5
If the MS supports V2X communication over E-UTRA-PC5 or NR-PC5 and needs to
perform PLMN selection for V2X communication over PC5 as specified in 3GPP TS
24.386 [59] or 3GPP TS 24.587 [75], then the MS shall proceed as follows:
i) the MS shall store a duplicate value of the RPLMN and a duplicate of the
PLMN selection mode that were in use before PLMN selection due to V2X
communication over PC5 was initiated, unless this PLMN selection due to V2X
communication over PC5 follows another PLMN selection due to V2X communication
over PC5 or a manual CSG selection as specified in clause 4.4.3.1.3.3;
ii) the MS shall enter into Automatic mode of PLMN selection as specified in
clause 4.4 taking into account the additional requirements in items iii) to x)
below;
iii) Among the PLMNs advertised by the E-UTRA or NG-RAN cell operating in the
radio resources provisioned to the MS for V2X communication over PC5 as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.385 [60], 3GPP TS 24.588 [79] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [40],
the MS shall choose one allowable PLMN which meets:
1) the following:
\- provides radio resources for V2X communication over PC5;
\- is in the list of authorised PLMNs for V2X communication over PC5 as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.386 [59] or 3GPP TS 24.587 [75]; and
\- is not in the list of \"PLMNs with E-UTRAN not allowed\" as specified in
clause 3.1; or
2) the following:
\- provides radio resources for V2X communication over PC5;
\- is in the list of authorised PLMNs for V2X communication over PC5 as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.386 [59] or 3GPP TS 24.587 [75];
\- is not in the list of PLMNs where the N1 mode capability was disabled due
to IMS voice not available and the MS\'s usage setting was \"voice centric\"
as PLMNs where voice service was not possible; and
\- is not in the list of PLMNs where the N1 mode capability was disabled due
to receipt of a reject from the network with 5GMM cause #27 \"N1 mode not
allowed\" in N1 mode as specified in clause 3.1;
if condition 1) or 2) above are met then the MS shall attempt to register on
that PLMN. If none of the PLMNs meet condition 1) or 2) above, the MS shall
return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action;
iv) if the registration fails due to \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"EPS services
not allowed\" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.386 [59], or due to \"PLMN not
allowed\" or \"5GS services not allowed\" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.587 [75],
or both, then the MS shall update the appropriate list of forbidden PLMNs as
specified in clause 3.1, and shall:
A) if the PLMN provides common radio resources needed by the MS to do V2X
communication over PC5 as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331 [42] or 3GPP TS 38.331
[65], perform V2X communication over PC5 on the selected PLMN in limited
service state. In this case the MS shall not search for available and
allowable PLMNs during the duration of V2X communication over PC5;
B) return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action; or
C) perform the action described in iii) again with the choice of PLMNs further
excluding the PLMNs on which the MS has failed to register.
Whether the MS performs A), B) or C) above is left up to MS implementation.
v) if the registration fails due to causes other than \"PLMN not allowed\" or
\"EPS services not allowed\" or \"5GS services not allowed\", the MS shall:
\- if the handling of the failure requires updating a list of forbidden PLMNs,
update the appropriate list (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A] or 3GPP TS
24.501 [64]); and
\- if the handling of the failure does not require updating a list of
forbidden PLMNs (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A] or 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]),
remember the PLMN as a PLMN on which the MS has failed to register;
NOTE 1: How long the MS memorizes the PLMNs on which it has failed to register
is implementation dependent.
and the MS shall:
A1) return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action;
B1) perform the action described in iii) again with the choice of PLMNs
further excluding the PLMNs on which the MS has failed to register; or
C1) perform V2X communication over PC5 in limited service state on a PLMN
advertised by the cell operating in the radio resources provisioned to the MS
for V2X communication over PC5 as specified in 3GPP TS 24.385 [60], 3GPP TS
24.588 [79] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [40], if registration on this PLMN has
previously failed due to \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"EPS services not allowed\"
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.386 [59], or due to \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"5GS
services not allowed\" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.587 [75], or both, and if
this PLMN provides common radio resources needed by the MS to do V2X
communication over PC5 as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331 [42] or 3GPP TS 38.331
[65]. In this case the MS shall not search for available and allowable PLMNs
during the duration of V2X communication over PC5;
Whether the MS performs A1), B1) or C1) above is left up to MS implementation.
vi) if the MS is no longer in the coverage of the selected PLMN, then the MS
shall:
A2) perform V2X communication over PC5 procedures for MS to use provisioned
radio resources as specified in 3GPP TS 24.386 [59] or 3GPP TS 24.587 [75]; or
B2) return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action.
Whether the MS performs A2) or B2) above is left up to MS implementation.
vii) if the MS is unable to find a suitable cell on the selected PLMN as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.386 [59] or 3GPP TS 24.587 [75], then the MS shall:
A3) if the PLMN provides common radio resources needed by the MS to do V2X

[65], perform V2X communication over PC5 on the selected PLMN in limited
service state. In this case the MS shall not search for available and
allowable PLMNs during the duration of V2X communication over PC5; or
B3) return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored

Whether the MS performs A3) or B3) above is left up to MS implementation.
viii) if the MS is switched off while on the selected PLMN and switched on
again, the MS shall use the stored duplicate value of RPLMN as RPLMN and
behave as specified in clause 4.4.3.1;
ix) if the user initiates a PLMN selection while on the selected cell, the MS
shall delete the stored duplicate value of PLMN selection mode, use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN as RPLMN and follow the procedures (as specified for
switch-on or recovery from lack of coverage) in clause 4.4.3.1. The MS shall
delete the stored duplicate value of RPLMN once the MS has successfully
registered to the selected PLMN; and
x) if the MS no longer needs to perform V2X communication over PC5, the MS
shall return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action.
NOTE 2: If the MS returns to the RPLMN due to a failure to register in the
selected PLMN, the upper layers of the MS can trigger PLMN selection again to
initiate V2X communication over PC5.
If the PLMN selected for V2X communication over PC5 is a VPLMN, the MS shall
not periodically scan for higher priority PLMNs during the duration of V2X
communication over PC5.
The solution to prevent potential ping-pong between the RPLMN and the PLMN
selected for V2X communication over PC5 is MS implementation specific.
## 3.1D PLMN selection triggered by A2X communication over PC5
If the MS supports A2X communication over E-UTRA-PC5 or NR-PC5 and needs to
perform PLMN selection for A2X communication over PC5 as specified in 3GPP TS
24.577 [86], then the MS shall proceed as follows:
i) the MS shall store a duplicate value of the RPLMN and a duplicate of the
PLMN selection mode that were in use before PLMN selection due to A2X
communication over PC5 was initiated, unless this PLMN selection due to A2X
communication over PC5 follows another PLMN selection due to A2X communication
over PC5 or a manual CSG selection as specified in clause 4.4.3.1.3.3;
ii) the MS shall enter into Automatic mode of PLMN selection as specified in
clause 4.4 taking into account the additional requirements in items iii) to x)
below;
iii) among the PLMNs advertised by the E-UTRA cell or NR cell operating in the
radio resources provisioned to the MS for A2X communication over PC5 as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.577 [86], 3GPP TS 24.578 [87] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [40],
the MS shall choose one allowable PLMN which meets:
1) the following:
\- provides radio resources for A2X communication over PC5;
\- is in the list of authorised PLMNs for A2X communication over PC5 as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.577 [86]; and
\- is not in the list of \"PLMNs with E-UTRAN not allowed\" as specified in
clause 3.1; or
2) the following:
\- provides radio resources for A2X communication over PC5;
\- is in the list of authorised PLMNs for A2X communication over PC5 as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.577 [86];
\- is not in the list of PLMNs where the N1 mode capability was disabled due
to IMS voice not available and the MS\'s usage setting was \"voice centric\"
as PLMNs where voice service was not possible; and
\- is not in the list of PLMNs where the N1 mode capability was disabled due
to receipt of a reject from the network with 5GMM cause #27 \"N1 mode not
allowed\" in N1 mode as specified in clause 3.1;
if either condition 1) or condition 2) above is met then the MS shall attempt
to register on that PLMN. If none of the PLMNs meet either condition 1) or
condition 2) above, the MS shall return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection
mode and use the stored duplicate value of RPLMN for further action;
iv) if the registration fails due to \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"EPS services
not allowed\" in case of EPS, due to \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"5GS services
not allowed\" in case of 5GS, or both as specified in 3GPP TS 24.577 [86],
then the MS shall update the appropriate list of forbidden PLMNs as specified
in clause 3.1, and shall:
A) if the PLMN provides common radio resources needed by the MS to do A2X
communication over PC5 as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331 [42] or 3GPP TS 38.331
[65], perform A2X communication over PC5 on the selected PLMN in limited
service state. In this case the MS shall not search for available and
allowable PLMNs during the duration of A2X communication over PC5;
Editor\'s note (pCR, UAS_Ph2): 3GPP TS 38.331 and 3GPP TS 36.331 still need to
be updated for A2X communication over PC5.
B) return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action; or
C) perform the action described in iii) again with the choice of PLMNs further
excluding the PLMNs on which the MS has failed to register.
Whether the MS performs A), B) or C) above is left up to MS implementation.
v) if the registration fails due to causes other than \"PLMN not allowed\" or
\"EPS services not allowed\" or \"5GS services not allowed\", the MS shall:
\- if the handling of the failure requires updating a list of forbidden PLMNs,
update the appropriate list (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A] or 3GPP TS
24.501 [64]); and
\- if the handling of the failure does not require updating a list of
forbidden PLMNs (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A] or 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]),
remember the PLMN as a PLMN on which the MS has failed to register;
NOTE 1: How long the MS memorizes the PLMNs on which it has failed to register
is implementation dependent.
and the MS shall either:
A1) return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action;
B1) perform the action described in iii) again with the choice of PLMNs
further excluding the PLMNs on which the MS has failed to register; or
C1) perform A2X communication over PC5 in limited service state on a PLMN
advertised by the cell operating in the radio resources provisioned to the MS
for A2X communication over PC5 as specified in 3GPP TS 24.577 [86], 3GPP TS
24.578 [87] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [40], if registration on this PLMN has
previously failed due to \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"EPS services not allowed\"
in case of EPS, due to \"PLMN not allowed\" or \"5GS services not allowed\" in
case of 5GS, or both as specified in 3GPP TS 24.577 [86], and if this PLMN
provides common radio resources needed by the MS to do A2X communication over
PC5 as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331 [42] or 3GPP TS 38.331 [65]. In this case
the MS shall not search for available and allowable PLMNs during the duration
of A2X communication over PC5;
Editor\'s note (pCR, UAS_Ph2): 3GPP TS 38.331 and 3GPP TS 36.331 still need to
be updated for A2X communication over PC5.
Whether the MS performs A1), B1) or C1) above is left up to MS implementation.
vi) if the MS is no longer in the coverage of the selected PLMN, then the MS
shall:
A2) perform A2X communication over PC5 procedures for MS to use provisioned
radio resources as specified in 3GPP TS 24.577 [86]; or
B2) return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action.
Whether the MS performs A2) or B2) above is left up to MS implementation.
vii) if the MS is unable to find a suitable cell on the selected PLMN as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.577 [86], then the MS shall:
A3) if the PLMN provides common radio resources needed by the MS to do A2X
communication over PC5 as specified in 3GPP TS 36.331 [42] or 3GPP TS 38.331
[65], perform A2X communication over PC5 on the selected PLMN in limited
service state. In this case the MS shall not search for available and
allowable PLMNs during the duration of A2X communication over PC5; or
Editor\'s note (pCR, UAS_Ph2): 3GPP TS 38.331 and 3GPP TS 36.331 still need to
be updated for A2X communication over PC5.
B3) return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action.
Whether the MS performs A3) or B3) above is left up to MS implementation.
viii) if the MS is switched off while on the selected PLMN and switched on
again, the MS shall use the stored duplicate value of RPLMN as RPLMN and
behave as specified in clause 4.4.3.1;
ix) if the user initiates a PLMN selection while on the selected cell, the MS
shall delete the stored duplicate value of PLMN selection mode, use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN as RPLMN and follow the procedures (as specified for
switch-on or recovery from lack of coverage) in clause 4.4.3.1. The MS shall
delete the stored duplicate value of RPLMN once the MS has successfully
registered to the selected PLMN; and
x) if the MS no longer needs to perform A2X communication over PC5, the MS
shall return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN for further action.
NOTE 2: If the MS returns to the RPLMN due to a failure to register in the
selected PLMN, the upper layers of the MS can trigger PLMN selection again to
initiate A2X communication over PC5.
If the PLMN selected for A2X communication over PC5 is a VPLMN, the MS shall
not periodically scan for higher priority PLMNs during the duration of A2X
communication over PC5.
The solution to prevent potential ping-pong between the RPLMN and the PLMN
selected for A2X communication over PC5 is MS implementation specific.
## 3.2 Regional provision of service
An MS may have a \"regionally restricted service\" where it can only obtain
service on certain areas (i.e. LAs or TAs). If such an MS attempts to camp on
a cell of an area for which it does not have service entitlement, when it does
an LR request, it will receive a message with cause value #12 (see 3GPP TS
24.008 [23], 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A] and 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]). In this case, the
MS shall take the following actions depending on the mode in which the message
was received:
A/Gb mode or Iu mode:
\- The MS stores the forbidden LA identity (LAI) in a list of \"forbidden
location areas for regional provision of service\", to prevent repeated access
attempts on a cell of the forbidden LA. This list is deleted when the MS is
switched off, the SIM is removed or periodically (with period in the range 12
to 24 hours). The MS enters the limited service state.
S1-mode:
The MS stores the forbidden TA identity (TAI) in a list of \"forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service\", to prevent repeated access
attempts on a cell of the forbidden TA. This list is deleted when the MS is
switched off, the SIM is removed or periodically (with period in the range 12
to 24 hours). The MS enters the limited service state.
N1-mode:
The MS stores the forbidden TA identity (TAI) in a list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service\", to prevent repeated access
attempts on a cell of the forbidden TA. This list is deleted when the MS is
switched off, the SIM is removed or periodically (with period in the range 12
to 24 hours). The MS enters the limited service state.
In A/Gb mode, a cell may be reserved for SoLSA exclusive access (see 3GPP TS
24.008 [23] and 3GPP TS 44.060 [39]). An MS is only allowed to camp normally
on such a cell if it has a Localised Service Area subscription to the cell.
Other MS may enter the limited service state.
NOTE 1: In A/Gb mode, in a SoLSA exclusive cell the MCC+MNC code is replaced
by a unique escape PLMN code (see 3GPP TS 23.073), not assigned to any PLMN,
in SI3 and SI4. An MS not supporting SoLSA may request for location update to
an exclusive access cell. In this case the location attempt is rejected with
the cause \"PLMN not allowed\" and the escape PLMN code is added to the list
of the \"forbidden PLMNs\".
The MS operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access shall maintain
one or more lists of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service\", each associated with an SNPN and, if the MS supports access to an
SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both,
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or, if the MS supports access to an
SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, the PLMN subscription. The
MS shall use the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision
of service\" associated with the selected SNPN and, if the MS supports access
to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or
both, the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected
PLMN subscription. If the MS selects a new SNPN, the MS shall keep the list of
\"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" associated
with the previously selected SNPN and, if the MS supports access to an SNPN
using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, the
previously selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the previously
selected PLMN subscription. If the number of the lists to be kept is higher
than supported, the MS shall delete the oldest stored list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service\". The MS shall delete all
lists of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\",
when the MS is switched off. The MS shall delete the list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service\" associated with an SNPN:
a) when the entry with the subscribed SNPN identifying the SNPN in the \"list
of subscriber data\" is updated;
b) when the USIM is removed if:
\- EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using EAP-
AKA\'; or
\- 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure;
was performed in the selected SNPN; or
c) if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials
holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, when the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking
areas for regional provision of service\" is associated with:
\- the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" and the entry of the \"list of
subscriber data\" is updated; or
\- the PLMN subscription and USIM is removed.
NOTE 2: The number of the lists of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\" supported by the MS is MS implementation specific.
## 3.3 Borders between registration areas
If the MS is moving in a border area between registration areas, it might
repeatedly change between cells of different registration areas. Each change
of registration area would require an LR, which would cause a heavy signalling
load and increase the risk of a paging message being lost. The access stratum
shall provide a mechanism to limit this effect.
## 3.4 Access control
### 3.4.1 Access control
Due to problems in certain areas, network operators may decide to restrict
access from some MSs (e.g., in case of congestion), and for this reason, a
mechanism for common access control is provided. In A/Gb mode and Iu mode a
mechanism for domain specific access control is also provided (see 3GPP TS
43.022 [35], 3GPP TS 44.018 [34] and 3GPP TS 25.304 [32]).
A mechanism to restrict access is provided via EAB. A network operator can
restrict network access of those MSs that are configured for EAB in addition
to common access control and domain specific access control.
The MS can be configured for EAB in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) or in
the ME (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50]). An MS that supports EAB shall follow the EAB
mechanism (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [23], 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A], 3GPP TS 44.018 [34],
3GPP TS 25.331 [33], 3GPP TS 36.331 [42]) when configured for EAB.
The MS can be configured for ACDC in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) or in
the ME (see 3GPP TS 24.105 [53]). An MS that supports ACDC shall follow the
ACDC mechanism (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [23], 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A], 3GPP TS 25.331
[33], 3GPP TS 36.331 [42]) when configured for ACDC.
The MS can be configured in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) or in the ME
(see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50]) to override EAB. An MS that supports overriding EAB
shall follow the overriding EAB mechanism (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [23], 3GPP TS
24.301 [23A]) when configured to allow overriding EAB.
In the case that a network operator decides to restrict access they may as an
option allow restricted MSs to respond to paging messages and/or to perform
location registrations. Mechanisms to allow this optional access are provided
(see 3GPP TS 25.304 [32]).
A network operator can also restrict some MSs to access the network for
location registration, although via common access class control or domain
specific access class control the MSs are permitted to access the network for
other purposes.
If the MS is accessing the network with a special access class (Access classes
11 to 15), then the MS shall ignore EAB and ACDC.
NOTE: The conditions when the MS is allowed to access the network with access
class 11 -- 15 are specified in 3GPP TS 22.011 [138].
If an MS configured for EAB is initiating an emergency call, then the MS shall
ignore EAB.
If an MS configured for EAB is responding to paging, then the MS shall ignore
EAB.
If an MS configured for ACDC is responding to paging, then the MS shall ignore
ACDC.
If an MS configured for ACDC is initiating an emergency call, then the MS
shall ignore ACDC.
If an MS configured for ACDC and the MO MMTEL voice call is started, the MO
MMTEL video call is started or the MO SMSoIP is started (see 3GPP TS 24.008
[23], 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A]), then the MS shall ignore ACDC.
### 3.4.2 Forbidden LA or TA for regional provision of service
The MS is not allowed to initiate establishment of a CM connection except for
an emergency call when camped on a cell of an LA or TA of which belongs to the
list of \"forbidden location areas for regional provision of service\" or
\"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\". The MS may
respond to paging.
The MS is not allowed to request GPRS services except for an emergency bearer
services or for access to RLOS when camped on a cell of an LA or TA of which
belongs to the list of \"forbidden location areas for regional provision of
service\" or \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\".
The MS is not allowed to request 5GS services except emergency services when
camped on a cell of a TA of which belongs to the list of \"5GS forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service\".
## 3.5 No suitable cell (limited service state)
There are a number of situations in which the MS is unable to obtain normal
service from a PLMN or SNPN. These include:
a) Failure to find a suitable cell of the selected PLMN or of the selected
SNPN;
b) No SIM in the MS or the \"list of subscriber data\" with no valid entry;
c) A \"PLMN not allowed\", \"Requested service option not authorized in this
PLMN\" ,\"Serving network not authorized\" or \"PLMNs not allowed to operate
at the present UE location\" response in case of PLMN or a \"Temporarily not
authorized for this SNPN\" or \"Permanently not authorized for this SNPN\"
response in case of SNPN when an LR is received;
d) An \"illegal MS\" or \"illegal ME\" response when an LR is received (Any
SIM or the corresponding entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" in the ME is
then considered \"invalid\");
e) An \"IMSI unknown in HLR\" response when an LR is received (Any SIM in the
ME is then considered \"invalid\" for non-GPRS services);
f) A \"GPRS services not allowed\" response when an LR of a GPRS MS attached
to GPRS services only is received (The cell selection state of GPRS MSs
attached to GPRS and non-GPRS depends on the outcome of the location
updating), or an \"EPS services not allowed\" response is received when an EPS
attach, tracking area update or service request is performed, or a \"5GS
services not allowed\" response is received when a registration or service
request is performed;
g) Void;
h) Void;
i) MS supporting CAG is camped on a CAG cell belonging to a PLMN, the CAG-ID
of the CAG cell is not manually selected by the user and none of the CAG-ID(s)
of the CAG cell are authorized based on the \"Allowed CAG list\" associated
with that PLMN in the \"CAG information list\";
j) MS supporting CAG is camped on a non-CAG cell belonging to a PLMN, the PLMN
ID of the non-CAG cell without a CAG-ID is not manually selected by the user
and the UE is configured with \"indication that the MS is only allowed to
access 5GS via CAG cells\" for that PLMN in the \"CAG information list\"; and
k) MS supporting CAG is camped on a CAG cell belonging to a PLMN, the CAG-ID
of the CAG cell is not manually selected by the user and the \"CAG information
list\" does not contain an entry for the PLMN (e.g. because the UE is not
(pre-)configured with a \"CAG information list\").
l) MS selected a PLMN for disaster roaming, the timer precluding registration
for disaster roaming in the selected PLMN for disaster roaming is running and
the MS is not registering or registered for emergency services in the selected
PLMN for disaster roaming.
m) MS determined that a disaster condition has ended, selected the PLMN
previously with disaster condition, the timer precluding registration in the
PLMN previously with disaster condition is running and the MS is not
registering or registered for emergency services in the PLMN previously with
disaster condition.
(In automatic PLMN selection mode, items a, c and f would normally cause a new
PLMN selection, but even in this case, the situation may arise when no PLMNs
are available and allowable for use).
(In automatic SNPN selection mode, items a, c, d, and f would normally cause a
new SNPN selection if there are two or more entries in the \"list of
subscriber data\", but even in this case, the situation may arise when no
SNPNs are available and allowable for use).
For the items a to f, if the MS does not operate in SNPN access operation mode
over 3GPP access, the MS attempts to camp on an acceptable cell, irrespective
of its PLMN identity, so that emergency calls or access to RLOS can be made if
necessary, with the exception that an MS operating in NB-S1 mode, shall never
attempt to make emergency calls or to access RLOS. When in the limited service
state with a valid SIM, the MS shall search for available and allowable PLMNs
in the manner described in clause 4.4.3.1 and when indicated in the SIM also
as described in clause 4.4.3.4. For an MS that is not in eCall only mode, with
the exception of performing GPRS attach or EPS attach for emergency bearer
services, performing an initial registration for emergency services, or
performing EPS attach for access to RLOS, no LR requests are made until a
valid SIM is present and either a suitable cell is found or a manual network
reselection is performed. For an MS in eCall only mode, no LR requests are
made except for performing EPS attach for emergency bearer services or an
initial registration for emergency services. When performing GPRS attach or
EPS attach for emergency bearer services, an initial registration for
emergency services, or performing EPS attach for access to RLOS, the PLMN of
the current serving cell is considered as the selected PLMN for the duration
the MS is attached for emergency bearer services, registered for emergency
services, or attached for access to RLOS. In the limited service state the
presence of the MS need not be known to the PLMN on whose cell it has camped.
If the MS is enabled for SNPN, the MS needs to make an emergency call, there
is no available PLMN supporting emergency services and the MS determines that
there is an available SNPN supporting emergency services (based on broadcasted
information of SNPN support for emergency services), the MS may start
operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access and attempt to camp
on a cell of the SNPN supporting emergency services. After an emergency call
is released, the MS should stop operating in SNPN access operation mode over
3GPP access and perform PLMN selection. If the MS is enabled for SNPN and
wants to perform configuration of SNPN subscription parameters in PLMN via the
user plane, but there is no available PLMN for normal services, either because
of no available PLMN or all available PLMNs being in forbidden PLMN list due
to LR failure, the MS may start operating in SNPN access operation mode over
3GPP access (if the MS is configured with default UE credentials) and perform
SNPN selection as per subclause 4.9.3.1.3 or 4.9.3.1.4. After the onboarding
services in SNPN are complete, the MS may stop operating in SNPN access
operation mode over 3GPP access and perform PLMN selection.
For the items a, c, d and f, if the MS operates in SNPN access operation mode
over 3GPP access and the MS has a valid entry in the \"list of subscriber
data\", the MS shall search for available and allowable SNPNs in the manner
described in clause 4.9.3.1. For the item b, if the MS operates in SNPN access
operation mode over 3GPP access, the MS:
\- attempts to camp on an acceptable cell so that emergency calls can be made
if supported and necessary; and
\- may perform SNPN selection procedure for onboarding services in SNPN if the
MS is configured with the default UE credentials for primary authentication.
For the item l, the MS shall search for available and allowable PLMNs in the
manner described in clause 4.4.3.1 and when indicated in the SIM also as
described in clause 4.4.3.4.
When in the limited service state, with the exception of performing an initial
registration for emergency services, no LR requests are made until a valid
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" is present and either a suitable cell
is found or a manual network reselection is performed. In the limited service
state, the presence of the MS need not be known to the SNPN on whose cell it
has camped. If the MS needs to make an emergency call, the MS supports
accessing a PLMN, and there is no available SNPN supporting emergency services
and the MS determines that there is an available PLMN supporting emergency
services (based on broadcasted information of PLMN support for emergency
services), the MS shall stop operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP
access and attempt to camp on a cell of the PLMN supporting emergency services
so that emergency calls can be made. After an emergency call is released, the
MS may re-start operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access and
perform SNPN selection. If the MS is enabled for SNPN and wants to select an
SNPN for onboarding services in SNPN, but finds no suitable SNPN as per
subclause 4.9.3.1.3 or 4.9.3.1.4, the MS may stop operating in SNPN access
operation mode over 3GPP access, and perform PLMN selection (if the MS is
configured with PLMN credentials in USIM). The MS may perform PLMN selection
as per clause 4.4. After the configuration of SNPN subscription parameters in
PLMN via the user plane is complete, the MS may start operating in SNPN access
operation mode over 3GPP access and perform SNPN selection. If the MS supports
access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN and access
for localized services in SNPN is enabled, and the MS is in limited service
state because no SNPN is available as per subclause 4.9.3.1, when the time
validity information of an SNPN based on the \"credentials holder controlled
prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access for localized services in
SNPN\" or \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs
for access for localized services in SNPN\" changes from not met to met, the
MS shall perform an SNPN selection as per subclause 4.9.3.1.
There are also other conditions under which only emergency calls or access to
RLOS may be made if the MS does not operate in SNPN access operation mode over
3GPP access. These are shown in table 2 in clause 5. ProSe communications can
be initiated in case of PLMN if necessary (see 3GPP TS 24.334 [51] or 3GPP TS
24.554 [80]) when in the limited service state due to items a) or c) or f).
V2X communication over PC5 can be initiated if necessary (see 3GPP TS 24.386
[59] or 3GPP TS 24.587 [75]) when in the limited service state due to items a)
or c) or f). A2X communication over PC5 can be initiated if necessary (see
3GPP TS 24.577 [86]) when in the limited service state due to items a) or c)
or f).
## 3.6 CTS fixed part selection (A/Gb mode only)
In CTS mode only or in automatic mode with CTS preferred, the CTS MS normally
operates on a CTS fixed part on which the mobile station is already enrolled.
If the CTS MS loses CTS coverage in these modes, it shall attempt periodically
to select again a CTS fixed part.
To select a CTS fixed part, the CTS MS shall listen to the CTSBCH frequencies
of all the fixed parts on which the MS is currently enrolled.
If the CTS MS is moving in a border area between one area with CTS coverage
and one without it, it might repeatedly require CTS attachments and LU on the
PLMN. To prevent this, the criteria C1_CTS and C2_CTS (defined in 3GPP TS
45.008 [25] clause 11.1) are used. To attach to a CTS FP, the C1_CTS criterion
shall be greater than zero. When the C2_CTS criterion falls below zero, the
CTS MS shall consider itself to be no more under CTS coverage.
## 3.7 NAS behaviour configuration
NAS behaviour can be operator configurable using parameters in the USIM (see
3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) or in the ME (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50]). For parameters
available in both the USIM and the ME, precedence is specified in 3GPP TS
31.102 [40] clause 5.2.29.
## 3.8 CAG selection (N1 mode only)
The MS may support CAG.
The MS may support enhanced CAG information. If the MS supports enhanced CAG
information, the MS shall support CAG.
If the MS supports CAG, the MS can be provisioned by the network with a \"CAG
information list\", consisting of zero or more entries, each containing:
a) a PLMN ID;
b) an \"Allowed CAG list\". The \"Allowed CAG list\" contains zero or more
CAG-IDs .If the UE supports enhanced CAG information, each CAG-ID in the
\"Allowed CAG list\" can be associated with time validity information. The
time validity information contains one or more time periods; and
c) an optional \"indication that the MS is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG
cells\".
The \"CAG information list\" provisioned by the network is stored in the non-
volatile memory of the ME, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C.
NOTE 1: When the MS is registering or registered to a PLMN other than the
HPLMN or EHPLMN, then the HPLMN will send a \"CAG information list\"
consisting of CAG subscription information related to the serving PLMN only.
When the MS is registering or registered to the HPLMN or EHPLMN then the HPLMN
or EHPLMN can send CAG subscription information related to any PLMN in the
\"CAG information list\".
In addition, the MS can also be pre-configured with a \"CAG information list\"
stored in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]). The \"Allowed CAG list\"
included in the entry for the HPLMN or EHPLMN in \"CAG information list\"
stored in the USIM can contain a range of CAG-IDs.
3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C specifies condition under which the \"CAG
information list\" stored in the ME is deleted. Additionally, when a USIM is
inserted, if:
\- no \"CAG information list\" is stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME;
or
\- the SUPI from the USIM does not match the SUPI stored together with the
\"CAG information list\" in the non-volatile memory of the ME;
and the MS has a \"CAG information list\" stored in the USIM (see 3GPP TS
31.102 [22]), the MS shall store the \"CAG information list\" from the USIM
into the ME, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C. If an entry in the
\"CAG information list\" stored in the USIM includes an \"Allowed CAG list\"
which contains a range of CAG-IDs, the range of CAG-IDs can be replaced with
individual CAG-IDs matching the range up to ME implementation.
NOTE 2: The MS ignores the \"CAG information list\" stored in the USIM except
when the USIM is inserted.
If the MS supports CAG and a PLMN is selected as described in clause
4.4.3.1.1, the automatic CAG selection is performed as part of clause
4.4.3.1.1.
If the MS supports CAG and a PLMN is selected as described in clause
4.4.3.1.2, the manual CAG selection is performed as part of clause 4.4.3.1.2.
The NAS shall provide the AS with a \"CAG information list\", if available,
where the \"CAG information list\" contains only the CAG-IDs authorized by the
\"Allowed CAG list\" for the entries in the \"CAG information list\", if
available. If the contents of the \"CAG information list\" have changed, or
the time validity information of an entry of \"Allowed CAG list\" in the \"CAG
information list\" starts or stops matching the MS's current time, the NAS
shall provide an updated \"CAG information list\" to the AS, where the \"CAG
information list\" contains only the CAG-IDs authorized by the \"Allowed CAG
list\" for the entries in the \"CAG information list\", if available. If an
entry in the \"CAG information list\" includes an \"Allowed CAG list\" which
contains a range of CAG-IDs, whether the NAS provides the AS the range of CAG-
IDs or individual CAG-IDs matching the range is up to ME implementation.
The \"indication that the MS is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells\" is
not applicable in EPS.
## 3.9 SNPN selection
An MS may be enabled for SNPN.
An MS enabled for SNPN may operate in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP
access.
An MS may support onboarding services in SNPN.
An MS enabled for SNPN may support access to an SNPN using credentials from a
credentials holder.
An MS enabled for SNPN may support access to an SNPN providing access for
localized services in SNPN. If the MS supports access to an SNPN providing
access for localized services in SNPN, the MS shall support access to an SNPN
using credentials from a credentials holder.
With the exception of onboarding services in SNPN, the MS operating in SNPN
access operation mode over 3GPP access selects:
a) an SNPN for which it is configured with a subscriber identifier and
credentials;
b) if the MS supports equivalent SNPNs, an equivalent SNPN; or
c) if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials
holder, an SNPN which supports access using credentials from a credentials
holder.
The MS can have several sets of subscriber identifiers, credentials, SNPN
identities, and other parameters related to SNPN selection (see clause
4.9.3.0). There are two modes for SNPN selection:
i) Automatic SNPN selection mode.
ii) Manual SNPN selection mode.
For onboarding services in SNPN, the MS operating in SNPN access operation
mode over 3GPP access selects an SNPN indicating that onboarding is allowed.
There are two modes for SNPN selection for onboarding services in SNPN:
i) Automatic SNPN selection mode.
ii) Manual SNPN selection mode.
## 3.10 Minimization of service interruption
The MS may support Minimization of service interruption (MINT).
MINT is not applicable in SNPNs.
For a PLMN that provides disaster roaming services, if one of the CAG-ID(s)
broadcasted by a CAG cell for the PLMN is authorized based on the \"Allowed
CAG list\" included in the entry for the PLMN in the \"CAG information list\",
then the UE may attempt to access the PLMN on the CAG cell for disaster
roaming services.
If the MS supports MINT, the MS can be provisioned by the network with:
a) an indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE, provided by
the HPLMN;
b) a \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided by the
HPLMN, consisting of zero or more entries, each containing a PLMN ID. The
PLMNs are listed in order of decreasing priority, with the first PLMN being
the highest priority PLMN;
c) one or more \"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided
by a VPLMN, consisting of zero or more entries, each containing a PLMN ID. The
PLMNs are listed in order of decreasing priority, with the first PLMN being
the highest priority PLMN;
d) a disaster roaming wait range consisting of a minimum wait time and a
maximum wait time;
e) a disaster return wait range consisting of a minimum wait time and a
maximum wait time; and
f) an indication of \'applicability of \"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in
disaster condition\" provided by a VPLMN\', provided by the HPLMN.
The network may provide the \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster
condition\", the disaster roaming wait range and the disaster return wait
range to the UE during a successful registration procedure or a generic UE
configuration update procedure. The network may also provide the disaster
return wait range to the UE during a network initiated de-registration
procedure, an unsuccessful registration procedure or an unsuccessful service
request procedure. The HPLMN may also provide an indication of whether
disaster roaming is enabled in the UE and an indication of \'applicability of
\"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided by a VPLMN\'
during a UE parameters update procedure.
The indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE, the
indication of \'applicability of \"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster
condition\" provided by a VPLMN\', one or more instances of \"list of PLMN(s)
to be used in disaster condition\" each stored with the PLMN identity of the
PLMN that provided it, the disaster roaming wait range and the disaster return
wait range provisioned by the network are stored in the non-volatile memory of
the ME, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C.
In addition, the MS can also be pre-configured with an indication of whether
disaster roaming is enabled in the UE, the indication of \'applicability of
\"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided by a VPLMN\', a
\"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided by the HPLMN, a
disaster roaming wait range and a disaster return wait range stored in the
USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]).
3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C specifies the conditions under which the
indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE, the indication of
\'applicability of \"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\"
provided by a VPLMN\', the one or more \"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in
disaster condition\", the disaster roaming wait range and the disaster return
wait range stored in the ME are deleted. Additionally:
a) when a USIM is inserted:
1) if:
i) no indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE is stored in
the non-volatile memory of the ME; or
ii) the SUPI from the USIM does not match the SUPI stored together with the
indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE in the non-
volatile memory of the ME;
and the MS has an indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE
stored in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [22]), the MS shall store the
indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE from the USIM into
the ME, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C;
2) if:
i) no disaster roaming wait range is stored in the non-volatile memory of the
ME; or

31.102 [22]), the MS shall store the disaster roaming wait range from the USIM
into the ME, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C; and
3) if:

ME; or
ii) the SUPI from the USIM does not match the SUPI stored together with the
disaster return wait range in the non-volatile memory of the ME;
and the MS has a disaster return wait range stored in the USIM (see 3GPP TS
31.102 [22]), the MS shall store the disaster return wait range from the USIM
into the ME, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C;
4) if:
i) the indication of \'applicability of \"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in
disaster condition\" provided by a VPLMN\' is stored in the non-volatile
memory of the ME; or
ii) the SUPI from the USIM does not match the SUPI stored together with the
indication of \'applicability of \"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster
condition\" provided by a VPLMN\' in the non-volatile memory of the ME;

used in disaster condition\" provided by a VPLMN\' stored in the USIM (see
3GPP TS 31.102 [22]), the MS shall store the indication of \'applicability of
\"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided by a VPLMN\'
from the USIM into the ME, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C; and
5) if:

HPLMN is stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME; or
ii) the SUPI from the USIM does not match the SUPI stored together with the
\"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided by the HPLMN in
the non-volatile memory of the ME;
and the MS has a \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided
by the HPLMN stored in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [22]), the MS shall store
the \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided by HPLMN
from the USIM into the ME, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C;
b) when the ME receives a USAT REFRESH command indicating that:
1) the indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE stored in
the USIM has been updated, the MS shall store the indication of whether
disaster roaming is enabled in the UE from the USIM into the ME, as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C;
2) the disaster roaming wait range stored in the USIM has been updated, the MS
shall store the disaster roaming wait range from the USIM into the ME, as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C;

into the ME, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C; or
5) the \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided by the
HPLMN stored in the USIM has been updated, the MS shall store the \"list of
PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided by the HPLMN from the USIM
into the ME, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64] annex C; or
NOTE 1: The MS ignores the indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled
in the UE stored in the USIM except when the USIM is inserted or when the ME
receives a USAT REFRESH command indicating that the indication of whether
disaster roaming is enabled in the UE stored in the USIM has been updated.
NOTE 2: The MS ignores the disaster roaming wait range stored in the USIM
except when the USIM is inserted or when the ME receives a USAT REFRESH
command indicating that the disaster roaming wait range stored in the USIM has
been updated.
NOTE 3: The MS ignores the disaster return wait range stored in the USIM
except when the USIM is inserted or when the ME receives a USAT REFRESH
command indicating that the disaster return wait range stored in the USIM has
been updated.
NOTE 4: The MS ignores the indication of \'applicability of \"lists of PLMN(s)
to be used in disaster condition\" provided by a VPLMN\' stored in the USIM
except when the USIM is inserted or when the ME receives a USAT REFRESH
command indicating that the indication of \'applicability of \"lists of
PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided by a VPLMN\' stored in the
USIM has been updated.
NOTE 5: The MS ignores the \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster
condition\" provided by the HPLMN stored in the USIM except when the USIM is
inserted or when the ME receives a USAT REFRESH command indicating that the
\"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" provided by the HPLMN
stored in the USIM has been updated.
If the MS does not have an indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled
in the UE stored in the ME, or the indication of whether disaster roaming is
enabled in the UE stored in the ME is set to \"Disaster roaming is disabled in
the UE\", disaster roaming is disabled at the MS. In this case, the MS shall
not perform disaster roaming.
Upon selecting a PLMN for disaster roaming, if there is a disaster roaming
wait range stored in the ME, the MS shall generate a random number within the
disaster roaming wait range and start a timer set to the generated random
number. While the timer is running, the MS shall not initiate registration
with the exception of performing an initial registration for emergency
services, in the selected PLMN. If performing an initial registration for
emergency services in the selected PLMN, the MS shall keep the timer running.
Upon expiration of the timer, if the MS does not have an emergency PDU
session, the MS may initiate registration, if still camped on the selected
PLMN. Upon expiration of the timer, if the MS has an emergency PDU session,
the MS shall initiate registration after release of the emergency PDU session,
if still camped on the selected PLMN.
Upon determining that a disaster condition has ended and selecting the PLMN
previously with disaster condition, if there is a disaster return wait range
stored in the ME, the MS shall generate a random number within the disaster
return wait range and start a timer set to the generated random number. While
the timer is running, the MS shall not initiate registration with the
exception of performing an initial registration for emergency services, in the
selected PLMN. If performing an initial registration for emergency services in
the selected PLMN, the MS shall keep the timer running. Upon expiration of the
timer, if the MS does not have an emergency PDU session, the MS may initiate
registration, if still camped on the selected PLMN. Upon expiration of the
timer, if the MS has an emergency PDU session, the MS shall initiate
registration after release of the emergency PDU session, if still camped on
the selected PLMN.
## 3.11 Signal level enhanced network selection
Signal level enhanced network selection is optionally supported by the home
operator.
Signal level enhanced network selection applies only to NB-IoT, GERAN EC-GSM-
IoT and Category M1 or M2 of E-UTRA. An MS supporting any, or a combination,
of NB-IoT, GERAN EC-GSM-IoT and Category M1 or M2 of E-UTRA shall apply signal
level enhanced network selection if the following conditions are fulfilled:
1) The MS is in automatic PLMN selection mode;
2) The MS supports the \"_Operator controlled signal threshold per access
technology_ \" as specified in 3GPP TS 22.011 [19];
3) The MS is configured for using signal level enhanced network selection as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [50];
4) The MS is configured for using signal level enhanced network selection as
specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]; and
5) The \"_Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology_ \" is
configured in the USIM as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [40].
NOTE 1: The usage of the \"Operator controlled signal threshold per access
technology\" is intended only for IoT stationary devices (see 3GPP TS 22.011
[19]).
NOTE 2: \"Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology\" is not
expected to be supported by non-IoT devices.
The HPLMN can configure the MS with an \"_Operator controlled signal threshold
per access technology_ \" stored in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]), which
consists of one or more entries, each containing:
a) a home operator controlled signal threshold; and
b) an access technology.
The \"Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology\" is specific
for a certain access technology and when applicable, applies to all allowable
PLMNs with the corresponding access technology combination.
The HPLMN can update the \"Operator controlled signal threshold per access
technology\" via steering of roaming information. When the ME receives a USAT
REFRESH command indicating that the \"Operator controlled signal threshold per
access technology\" stored in the USIM has been updated, an MS which applies
SENSE shall use the \"Operator controlled signal threshold per access
technology\" provided by the HPLMN for the subsequent PLMN selections.
The \"_Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology_ \" can also
be received from the HPLMN over the control plane steering of roaming
mechanism.
# 4 Overall process structure
## 4.1 Process goal
The aim of the idle mode processes is to ensure that the registered PLMN is
the selected PLMN and that the registered SNPN is the selected SNPN.
## 4.2 States description
Each of the processes of PLMN selection and SNPN selection, cell selection and
location registration can be described by a set of states. The overall state
of the mobile is thus a composite of the states of the three processes. In
some cases, an event which causes a change of state in one process may trigger
a change of state in another process, e.g., camping on a cell in a new
registration area triggers an LR request. Except for SNPN selection, the
relationship between the processes is illustrated in figure 1 in clause 5.
Except for SNPN selection, the states in which the MS may be, for each of the
processes, are described below and illustrated in figures 2a, 2b and 3 in
clause 5. For many of the states, a fuller description can be found in other
Technical Specifications, and a reference to the Technical Specification is
given after the state description.
In the event of any conflict between the diagrams and the text in the present
document, the text takes precedence.
## 4.3 List of states
### 4.3.1 List of states for the PLMN selection process
#### 4.3.1.1 List of states for automatic mode (figure 2a)
A1 Trying RPLMN ‑ The MS is trying to perform a Location Registration on the
registered PLMN.
A2 On PLMN ‑ The MS has successfully registered on a PLMN.
A3 Trying PLMN ‑ The MS is trying to register on a PLMN in the ordered list of
PLMNs.
A4 Wait for PLMNs to appear ‑ There are no allowable and available PLMNs at
present and the MS is waiting for one to appear.
A5 HPLMN search in progress ‑ The MS is trying to find if the HPLMN is
available.
A6 No SIM ‑ There is no SIM in the MS, or certain LR responses have been
received.
#### 4.3.1.2 List of states for manual mode (figure 2b)
M1 Trying registered PLMN ‑ The MS is trying to perform a Location
Registration on the registered PLMN.
M2 On PLMN ‑ The MS has successfully registered on a PLMN.
M3 Not on PLMN ‑ The MS has failed to register on the selected PLMN.
M4 Trying PLMN ‑ The MS is trying to register on a user selected PLMN.
M5 No SIM ‑ There is no SIM in the MS, or certain LR responses have been
received.
### 4.3.2 Void
### 4.3.3 List of states for location registration (figure 3)
The states are entered depending on responses to location registration (LR)
requests. Independent update states exist for GPRS and for non-GPRS operation
in MSs capable of GPRS and non-GPRS services.
L0 Null -- The MS is considered in this state when switched off.
L1 Updated ‑ The MS enters this state if an LR request is accepted. The update
status is set to \"UPDATED\". The GPRS and the non-GPRS update state of an MS
may enter \"Updated\" as a result of combined signalling or as a result of
individual signalling depending on the capabilities of the network.
L2 Idle, No IMSI ‑ The MS enters this state if an LR request is rejected with
cause:
a) IMSI unknown in HLR;
b) illegal ME;
c) illegal MS;
d) GPRS services not allowed,
e) GPRS services and non-GPRS services not allowed,
or if there is no SIM. All update states of an MS enter this state regardless
whether received by individual or combined signalling for events b) and c).
Event a) has no influence on the GPRS update state. Events b) and c) result in
\"ROAMING NOT ALLOWED\" for the GPRS and/or non-GPRS update status depending
on the specific location registration procedure. Event d) results in \"ROAMING
NOT ALLOWED\" for the GPRS update status. Event e) results in \"ROAMING NOT
ALLOWED\" for the GPRS update status and non-GPRS update status.
If a SIM is present, the non-GPRS update status of the SIM is set to \"ROAMING
NOT ALLOWED\".
L3 Roaming not allowed ‑ The MS enters this state if it receives an LR reject
message with the cause:
a) PLMN not allowed;
b) Location area not allowed;
c) Tracking area not allowed;
d) Roaming not allowed in this location area;
e) Roaming not allowed in this tracking area;
f) GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN;
g) No suitable cells in location area;
h) No suitable cells in tracking area;
i) Not authorized for this CSG.
Except from event f) all update states of the MS are set to \"Roaming not
allowed\" regardless whether received by individual or combined signalling.
Event f) results in \"Roaming not allowed\" for the GPRS update state only.
Event f) has no influence on the non-GPRS update state. The behaviour of the
MS in the roaming not allowed state is dependent on the LR reject cause as
shown in table 2 in clause 5. Additionally:
\- in automatic mode, \"PLMN not allowed\", \"Roaming not allowed in this
location area\" and \"Roaming not allowed in this tracking area\" cause the
Automatic Network Selection procedure of clause 4.4.3.1.1 to be started; it is
also caused by \"GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN\" when received by a
GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode C;
\- in manual mode, \"PLMN not allowed\" and \"Roaming not allowed\" cause the
Manual Network Selection procedure of clause 4.4.3.1.2 to be started; it is
also caused by \"GPRS services not allowed in this PLMN\" when received by a
GPRS MS operating in MS operation mode C.
L4 Not updated ‑ The MS enters this state if any LR failure not specified for
states L2 or L3 occurs, in which cases the MS is not certain whether or not
the network has received and accepted the LR attempt. The non-GPRS update
status on the SIM and/or the GPRS update status are set to \"NOT UPDATED\"
depending on the specific location registration procedure and their outcome.
L5 LR request -- The MS enters this state when determining that a LR request
is to be made.
L6 LR pending -- The MS enters this state after having started the LR, waiting
for the outcome (response message from the network).
NOTE This clause does not describe all the cases. For more details refer to
3GPP TS 24.008 [23], 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A] and 3GPP TS 24.501 [64].
## 4.4 PLMN selection process
### 4.4.1 Introduction
There are two modes for PLMN selection, automatic and manual. These are
described in clauses 4.4.3 below and illustrated in figures 2a to 2b in clause
5.
NOTE: Figures 2a to 2b in clause 5 do not cover CAG selection aspects.
The MS not operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access shall
perform PLMN selection process.
The MS operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access shall not
perform PLMN selection process.
### 4.4.2 Registration on a PLMN
The MS shall perform registration on the PLMN if the MS is capable of services
which require registration. In both automatic and manual modes, the concept of
registration on a PLMN is used. An MS successfully registers on a PLMN if:
a) the MS has found a suitable cell of the PLMN to camp on; and
b) an LR request from the MS has been accepted in the registration area of the
cell on which the MS is camped (see table 1).
### 4.4.3 PLMN selection
The registration on the selected PLMN and the location registration are only
necessary if the MS is capable of services which require registration.
Otherwise, the PLMN selection procedures are performed without registration.
The ME shall utilise all the information stored in the SIM related to the PLMN
selection; e.g. \"HPLMN Selector with Access Technology\", \"User Controlled
PLMN Selector with Access Technology\", \"Forbidden PLMNs\", \"Equivalent
HPLMN\", see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]. The ME shall also utilise the extension of
the \"forbidden PLMNs\" list that it has stored locally on the ME if
available.
The ME shall either utilise the \"Operator controlled PLMN Selector with
Access Technology\" that it has stored locally on the ME, or the Operator
controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" stored in the SIM, for the
purposes of PLMN selection.
The \"HPLMN Selector with Access Technology\", \"User Controlled PLMN Selector
with Access Technology\" and \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access
Technology\" data files in the SIM include associated access technologies for
each PLMN entry, see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]. The PLMN/access technology
combinations are listed in priority order. If an entry indicates more than one
access technology, then no priority is defined for the access technologies
within this entry and the priority applied to each access technology within
this entry is an implementation issue. If no particular access technology is
indicated in an entry, it shall be assumed that all access technologies
supported by the ME apply to the entry. If an entry only indicates access
technologies not supported by the ME, the entry shall be ignored. If an entry
indicates at least one access technology supported by the ME, the entry shall
be used in the PLMN selection procedures if the other criteria defined for the
specific PLMN selection procedures are fulfilled.
The Mobile Equipment stores a list of \"equivalent PLMNs\". This list is
replaced or deleted at the end of each location update procedure, routing area
update procedure, GPRS attach procedure, tracking area update procedure, EPS
attach procedure, and registration procedure. The list is deleted by an MS
attached for emergency bearer services or for access to RLOS after detach or
registered for emergency services after de-registration. The stored list
consists of a list of equivalent PLMNs as downloaded by the network plus the
PLMN code of the registered PLMN that downloaded the list. All PLMNs in the
stored list, in all access technologies supported by the PLMN, are regarded as
equivalent to each other for PLMN selection, cell selection/re-selection and
handover.
When the MS reselects to a cell in a shared network, and the cell is a
suitable cell for multiple PLMN identities received on the BCCH or on the EC-
BCCH the AS indicates these multiple PLMN identities to the NAS according to
3GPP TS 44.018 [34], 3GPP TS 44.060 [39], 3GPP TS 25.304 [32], 3GPP TS 36.304
[43] and 3GPP TS 38.304 [61]. The MS shall choose one of these PLMNs. If the
registered PLMN is available among these PLMNs, the MS shall not choose a
different PLMN.
The MS shall not use the PLMN codes contained in the \"HPLMN Selector with
Access Technology\" data file.
It is possible for the home network operator to identify alternative Network
IDs as the HPLMN. If the EHPLMN list is present, and not empty, the entries in
the EHPLMN list are used in the network selection procedures. When attempting
to select a network the highest priority EHPLMN that is available shall be
selected. If the EHPLMN list is present and is empty or if the EHPLMN list is
not present, the HPLMN derived from the IMSI is used for network selection
procedures.
NOTE 1: The \"HPLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file is only used
by the MS to get the HPLMN access technologies related to the HPLMN code which
corresponds to the PLMN code included in the IMSI if the EHPLMN list is not
present or is empty. If the EHPLMN list is present then this data field is
applicable to all the entries within the EHPLMN list.
NOTE 2: Different GSM frequency bands (e.g. 900, 1800, 1900, 400) are all
considered GSM access technology. An MS supporting more than one band should
scan all the bands it\'s supports when scanning for GSM frequencies. However
GSM COMPACT systems which use GSM frequency bands but with the CBPCCH
broadcast channel are considered as a separate access technology from GSM.
NOTE 3: The inclusion of the HPLMN derived from the IMSI in the EHPLMN list is
allowed. The priority of the HPLMN derived from the IMSI is given by its
position in the EHPLMN list, see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40].
The MS may support minimization of service interruption (MINT).
#### 4.4.3.1 At switch‑on or recovery from lack of coverage
a) if
\- signal level enhanced network selection is not applicable (see clause
3.11); or
\- the MS has stopped applying signal level enhanced network selection
according to requirement v) of clause 4.4.3.1.1;
then the MS selects the registered PLMN or equivalent PLMN (if it is
available) using all access technologies that the MS is capable of without
considering the \"Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology\"
stored in the USIM; or
b) if:
\- signal level enhanced network selection is applicable (see clause 3.11);
and
\- the received signal quality from a candidate PLMN/access technology
combination comprising of a registered PLMN or an equivalent PLMN (if it is
available) is equal to or greater than the \"_Operator controlled signal
threshold per access technology_ \" of the access technology configured in the
USIM _._
_the_ MS shall select the registered PLMN or equivalent PLMN (if it is
available) and the access technology for which the received signal quality is
equal to or greater than the \"_Operator controlled signal threshold per
access technology_ \" stored in the USIM. If for the registered PLMN or
equivalent PLMN there are two or more access technologies for which the
received signal quality is equal to or greater than the \"_Operator controlled
signal threshold per access technology_ \" stored in the USIM, it is up to
implementation which access technology is selected by the MS.
and if necessary (in the case of recovery from lack of coverage, see clause
4.5.2) attempts to perform a Location Registration.
NOTE 1: The MS in automatic network selection mode can end the PLMN search
procedure once the registered PLMN or equivalent PLMN is found on an access
technology.
NOTE 2: An MS in automatic network selection mode can use location information
to determine which PLMNs can be available in its present location.
EXCEPTION: As an alternative option to this, if the MS is in automatic network
selection mode and it finds coverage of an EHPLMN, the MS may register to that
EHPLMN and not return to the registered PLMN or equivalent PLMN. If the EHPLMN
list is not present or is empty, and the HPLMN is available, the MS may
register on the HPLMN and not return to the registered PLMN or equivalent
PLMN. The operator shall be able to control by SIM configuration whether an MS
that supports this option is permitted to perform this alternative behaviour.
If signal level enhanced network selection is applicable (see clause 3.11),
the MS may register to that EHPLMN or HPLMN only over an access technology for
which the received signal quality is equal to or greater than the \"_Operator
controlled signal threshold per access technology_ \" stored in the USIM.
EXCEPTION: As an alternative option to this, if the MS is in automatic network
selection mode, the MS has a list of \"PLMNs where registration was aborted
due to SOR\" and the registered PLMN is part of the list of \"PLMNs where
registration was aborted due to SOR\", the MS may choose not to return to the
registered PLMN or equivalent PLMN and proceed as defined in clause 4.4.3.1.1
with the exception that in iii), the MS considers PLMNs which are in the list
of \"PLMNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\" as lowest priority.
EXCEPTION: In A/Gb mode an MS with voice capability, shall not search for
CPBCCH carriers. In A/Gb mode an MS not supporting packet services shall not
search for CPBCCH carriers.
If successful registration is achieved, the MS indicates the selected PLMN.
If:
\- there is no registered PLMN;
\- registration is not possible due to the PLMN being unavailable or
registration failure; or
\- signal level enhanced network selection is applicable (see clause 3.11) and
the received signal quality of all access technologies (if the MS is capable
of and if it is available) from the registered PLMN or equivalent PLMN (if
available) is lower than the \"_Operator controlled signal threshold per
access technology\"_ stored in the USIM _of the corresponding access
technology_.
the MS follows one of the following two procedures depending on its PLMN
selection operating mode. At switch on, if the MS provides the optional
feature of user preferred PLMN selection operating mode at switch on then this
operating mode shall be used. Otherwise, the MS shall use the PLMN selection
mode that was used before switching off.
EXCEPTION: At switch on, if the MS is in manual mode and neither registered
PLMN nor PLMN that is equivalent to it is available, but EHPLMN is available,
then instead of performing the manual network selection mode procedure of
clause 4.4.3.1.2 the MS may select and attempt registration on the highest
priority EHPLMN. If the EHPLMN list is not available or is empty and the HPLMN
is available, then the MS may select and attempt registration on the HPLMN. If
the MS supports CAG and needs to select or attempt registration on the highest
priority EHPLMN or HPLMN, the MS follows network selection procedures of
clause 4.4.3.1.1 bullet m). The MS shall remain in manual mode.
NOTE 3: If successful registration is achieved, then the current serving PLMN
becomes the registered PLMN and the MS does not store the previous registered
PLMN for later use.
EXCEPTION: If registration is not possible on recovery from lack of coverage
due to the registered PLMN being unavailable, an MS attached to GPRS services,
attached via E-UTRAN or registered via the NG-RAN may, optionally, continue
looking for the registered PLMN for an implementation dependent time.
NOTE 4: An MS attached to GPRS services, attached via E-UTRAN or registered
via the NG-RAN should use the above exception only if one or more PDP
contexts, PDN connections or PDU sessions are currently active.
EXCEPTION: At switch on, if the RPLMN is a PLMN with which the MS was
registered for disaster roaming services and the MS is registered via non-3GPP
access connected to 5GCN or an NG-RAN cell of the RPLMN broadcasts neither the
disaster related indication nor a \"list of one or more PLMN(s) with disaster
condition for which disaster roaming services is offered by the available
PLMN\" including the MS determined PLMN with disaster condition or an
allowable PLMN is available then the MS will ignore RPLMN and its equivalent
PLMN.
##### 4.4.3.1.1 Automatic Network Selection Mode Procedure
The MS selects and attempts registration on other PLMN/access technology
combinations, if available and, for bullets i, ii, iii, iv, v, allowable, in
the following order:
i) either the HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or the
highest priority EHPLMN that is available (if the EHPLMN list is present);
ii) each PLMN/access technology combination in the \"User Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" data file in the SIM (in priority order);
iii) each PLMN/access technology combination in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" data file in the SIM (in priority order) or
stored in the ME (in priority order);
iv) other PLMN/access technology combinations with received high quality
signal in random order;
NOTE 1: High quality signal is defined in the appropriate AS specification.
v) other PLMN/access technology combinations in order of decreasing signal
quality.
vi) PLMN/NG-RAN combinations for any forbidden PLMNs broadcasting the PLMN ID
of the MS determined PLMN with disaster condition or broadcasting the disaster
related indication and matching the below conditions:
a) if the indication of \'applicability of \"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in
disaster condition\" provided by a VPLMN\' is set to true:
\- each PLMN in the \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\"
stored in the ME which is associated with the PLMN ID of the MS determined
PLMN with disaster condition, if any, ordered based on this list; otherwise
\- if the ME does not have a stored \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster
condition\" associated with the PLMN ID of the MS determined PLMN with
disaster condition, each PLMN in the \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster
condition\" stored in the ME which is associated with the PLMN ID of the
HPLMN, if any, ordered based on this list.
b) if the indication of \'applicability of \"lists of PLMN(s) to be used in
disaster condition\" provided by a VPLMN\' is set to false:
\- each PLMN in the \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\"
stored in the ME which is associated with the HPLMN, if any, ordered based on
this list.
vii) PLMN /NG-RAN combinations for other forbidden PLMNs broadcasting the PLMN
ID of the MS determined PLMN with disaster condition or broadcasting the
disaster related indication, in random order.
When following the above procedure the following requirements apply:
a) An MS with voice capability shall ignore PLMNs for which the MS has
identified at least one GSM COMPACT.
b) In A/Gb mode or GSM COMPACT, an MS with voice capability, or an MS not
supporting packet services shall not search for CPBCCH carriers.
c) In ii and iii, the MS should limit its search for the PLMN to the access
technology or access technologies associated with the PLMN in the appropriate
PLMN Selector with Access Technology list (User Controlled or Operator
Controlled selector list).
An MS using a SIM without access technology information storage (i.e. the
\"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" and the \"Operator
Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data files are not present)
shall instead use the \"PLMN Selector\" data file, for each PLMN in the \"PLMN
Selector\" data file, the MS shall search for all access technologies it is
capable of. The priority ordering amongst the access technologies is
implementation dependent.
d) In iv, v, vi and vii, the MS shall search for all access technologies it is
capable of, before deciding which PLMN to select.
e) In ii, and iii, a packet only MS which supports GSM COMPACT, but using a
SIM without access technology information storage (i.e. the \"User Controlled
PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" and the \"Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" data files are not present) shall instead
use the \"PLMN Selector\" data file, for each PLMN in the \"PLMN Selector\"
data file, the MS shall search for all access technologies it is capable of
and shall assume GSM COMPACT access technology as the lowest priority radio
access technology.
f) In i, the MS shall search for all access technologies it is capable of. No
priority is defined for the preferred access technology and the priority is an
implementation issue, but \"HPLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file
on the SIM may be used to optimise the procedure.
g) In i, an MS using a SIM without access technology information storage (i.e.
the \"HPLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file is not present) shall
search for all access technologies it is capable of. The priority ordering
amongst the access technologies is implementation dependent. A packet only MS
which supports GSM COMPACT using a SIM without access technology information
storage shall also assume GSM COMPACT access technology as the lowest priority
radio access technology.
NOTE 2: For f) and g), the MS in automatic network selection mode can end the
PLMN search procedure once the HPLMN or the highest priority EHPLMN is found
on an access technology.
NOTE 3: For i, ii and iii, the MS can use location information to determine
which PLMNs can be available in its present location.
h) In v, the MS shall order the PLMN/access technology combinations in order
of decreasing signal quality within each access technology. The order between
PLMN/access technology combinations with different access technologies is an
MS implementation issue.
NOTE 4: Requirements a) and b) apply also to requirement d), so a GSM voice
capable MS should not search for GSM COMPACT PLMNs, even if capable of GSM
COMPACT.
NOTE 5: Requirements a) and b) apply also to requirement f), so a GSM voice
capable MS should not search for GSM COMPACT PLMNs, even if this is the only
access technology on the \"HPLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file
on the SIM.
i) In i to vii, the MS shall not consider PLMNs where voice service was not
possible as PLMN selection candidate, unless such PLMN is available in GERAN
or UTRAN or no other allowed PLMN is available.
j) In i to v, if the MS only supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection
(see 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A]), the MS shall not consider PLMNs which do not
advertise support of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection.
k) In i to v, if the MS only supports control plane CIoT EPS optimization (see
3GPP TS 24.301 [23A]) and the MS camps on a E-UTRA cell which is not NB-IoT
cell (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [43], 3GPP TS 36.331 [42]), the MS shall not consider
PLMNs which do not advertise support of EPS services with control plane CIoT
EPS optimization.
l) In i to vii, if the MS is in eCall only mode, the MS shall not consider
PLMNs which do not advertise support for eCall over IMS, unless such PLMNs are
available in GERAN or UTRAN.
NOTE 6: As an implementation option, an MS in eCall only mode that was not
able to select any PLMN according to l) can perform a second iteration of i to
v with no restriction.
m) In i to vii, if the MS supports CAG and:
1) is provisioned with a non-empty \"CAG information list\", the MS shall
consider a PLMN indicated by an NG-RAN cell only if:
A) the cell is a CAG cell and broadcasts a CAG-ID for the PLMN such that there
exists an entry with the PLMN ID of the PLMN in the \"CAG information list\"
and the CAG-ID is authorized based on the \"Allowed CAG list\" of the entry;
or
B) the cell is not a CAG cell and:
\- there is no entry with the PLMN ID of the PLMN in the \"CAG information
list\"; or
\- there exists an entry with the PLMN ID of the PLMN in the \"CAG information
list\" but the \"indication that the MS is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG
cells\" is not included in the entry; or
2) is provisioned with an empty \"CAG information list\" or is not provisioned
with a \"CAG information list\", the MS shall consider a PLMN indicated by an
NG-RAN cell only if the cell is not a CAG cell.
n) In i to vii, if the MS only supports control plane CIoT 5GS optimization
(see 3GPP TS 23.501 [62]) and the MS camps on an E-UTRA cell connected to
5GCN, which is not NB-IoT cell (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [43], 3GPP TS 36.331 [42]),
the MS shall not consider PLMNs which do not advertise support of 5GS services
with control plane CIoT 5GS optimization.
o) In i to vii, if the MS supports CIoT 5GS optimizations, the MS shall not
consider the PLMN/access technology combinations for which the MS preferred
CIoT network behaviour is not advertised as supported by the PLMN/access
technology combination (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
NOTE 7: As an implementation option, the MS supporting CIoT 5GS optimizations
that was not able to select any PLMN according to o) can perform a second
iteration of i to v with no restriction.
p) In iii, the MS shall use the PLMN/access technology combination in the
\"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" stored in the ME,
if the last update of the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access
Technology\" was due to receiving steering of roaming information containing
the \"list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations\" (see annex C)
and storing it in the ME. Otherwise, the MS shall use the \"Operator
Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list retrieved from the SIM.
q1) for vi and vii, if a forbidden PLMN is broadcasting the \"list of one or
more PLMN(s) with disaster condition for which disaster roaming services is
offered by the available PLMN\", the MS shall determine the MS determined PLMN
with disaster condition as follows:
i) if the MS\'s RPLMN is included in any \"list of one or more PLMN(s) with
disaster condition for which disaster roaming services is offered by the
available PLMN\" broadcast by any NG-RAN cell and is allowable, the MS shall
consider that the MS\'s RPLMN is the MS determined PLMN with disaster
condition; or
ii) if the MS\'s RPLMN is not included in any \"list of one or more PLMN(s)
with disaster condition for which disaster roaming services is offered by the
available PLMN\" broadcast by any NG-RAN cell or the MS\'s RPLMN is not
allowable or the MS does not have a RPLMN (see table 1), the MS shall
determine the MS determined PLMN with disaster condition from PLMNs:
\- in the \"list of one or more PLMN(s) with disaster condition for which
disaster roaming services is offered by the available PLMN\" broadcast by any
NG-RAN cell; and
\- which are allowable;
in the following order:
\- either the HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or the
highest priority EHPLMN that is available (if the EHPLMN list is present);
\- each PLMN in the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
data file in the SIM (in priority order);
\- each PLMN in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access
Technology\" data file in the SIM (in priority order) or stored in the ME (in
priority order); and
\- other PLMNs.
q2) for vi and vii, if a forbidden PLMN is broadcasting the \"disaster related
indication\", the MS shall attempt to determine the MS determined PLMN with
disaster condition as follows:
1) if the country of the MS\'s RPLMN matches the country of a PLMN for which
any NG-RAN cell broadcasts the \"disaster related indication\" and the MS\'s
RPLMN is allowable, the MS shall consider that the MS\'s RPLMN is the MS
determined PLMN with disaster condition; or
2) if the country of the MS\'s RPLMN does not match the country of any PLMN
for which any NG-RAN cell broadcasts the \"disaster related indication\" or
the MS\'s RPLMN is not allowable, the MS shall determine the MS determined
PLMN with disaster condition from allowable PLMN(s) where the country of
allowable PLMN(s) matches the country of a PLMN for which any NG-RAN cell
broadcasts the \"disaster related indication\" in the following order:
\- either the HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or the
highest priority EHPLMN that is available (if the EHPLMN list is present);
\- each PLMN in the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
data file in the SIM (in priority order);
\- each PLMN in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access
Technology\" data file in the SIM (in priority order) or stored in the ME (in
priority order).
r) The MS shall perform vi and vii to select a PLMN for disaster roaming
services only if:
1) the MS supports MINT;
2) the indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE stored in
the ME is set to \"Disaster roaming is enabled in the UE\";
3) there is no available PLMN which is allowable;
4) the MS is not in 5GMM-REGISTERED state and 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over
non-3GPP access (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]);
4a) the MS does not have a PDN connection via an ePDG connected to EPC; and
5) an NG-RAN cell of the PLMN or of a shared network where the PLMN is
available:
A) broadcasts the disaster related indication for the PLMN. The disaster
related indication broadcasted by the NG-RAN cell for the PLMN indicates that
the PLMN is accessible for disaster inbound roamers, that this PLMN accepts
disaster inbound roamers from any PLMN(s) other than the PLMN(s) available on
the NG-RAN cell, and that a disaster condition applies to all PLMN(s) other
than the PLMN(s) available on the NG-RAN cell in the location of the
broadcast. If the disaster related indication is broadcasted, the disaster
inbound roamers attempt to determine the MS determined PLMN with disaster
condition as per bullet q2); or
NOTE 8: In case of a shared network, the disaster related indication is
broadcasted per PLMN.
B) broadcasts a \"list of one or more PLMN(s) with disaster condition for
which disaster roaming services is offered by the available PLMN\" which
includes the MS determined PLMN with disaster condition as determined in
bullet q1).
s) In i to vii, if the MS only supports NR RedCap and the MS camps on an NR
cell connected to 5GCN, the MS shall not consider PLMNs which do not advertise
support of NR RedCap.
t) In i to vii, if the MS detects a PLMN in satellite NG-RAN access technology
which fulfils the conditions related to the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to
operate at the present UE location\" as defined in clause 3.1, it shall not
consider the PLMN as PLMN selection candidate for satellite NG-RAN access
technology.
u) In i to vii, if the MS detects a PLMN in a satellite E-UTRAN access
technology which fulfils the conditions related to the list of \"PLMNs not
allowed to operate at the present UE location\" as defined in clause 3.1, it
shall not consider the PLMN as PLMN selection candidate for the satellite
E-UTRAN access technology.
v) In i), ii), iii), and v), if:
\- signal level enhanced network selection is applicable (see clause 3.11);
and
\- the received signal quality of the candidate PLMN/access technology
combination is lower than the threshold value indicated for the access
technology in the \"_Operator controlled signal threshold per access
technology_ \" stored in the USIM.
the MS shall not consider the PLMN(s) in i) and PLMN/access technology
combination(s) in ii), iii) and v) as selection candidate. If the received
signal quality from none of the candidate PLMN(s) or PLMN/access technology
combination(s) is equal to or greater than the \"_Operator controlled signal
threshold per access technology_ \" stored in the USIM, the MS shall stop
applying signal level enhanced network selection and repeat the network
selection procedure as specified in clause 4.4.3.1.
If successful registration is achieved, the MS indicates the selected PLMN.
If registration cannot be achieved because no PLMNs are available and
allowable, and the MS does not support access to RLOS, the MS indicates \"no
service\" to the user, waits until a new PLMN is available and allowable and
then repeats the procedure.
If there were one or more PLMNs which were available and allowable, but an LR
failure made registration on those PLMNs unsuccessful or an entry in any of
the lists \"forbidden location areas for roaming\", \"forbidden tracking areas
for roaming\", \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", \"forbidden
location areas for regional provision of service\", \"forbidden tracking areas
for regional provision of service\", \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service\", \"CAG information list\", or \"PLMNs not
allowed to operate at the present UE location\" prevented a registration
attempt, the MS selects the first such PLMN again and enters a limited service
state.
If:
\- the MS supports access to RLOS;
\- either the UICC containing the USIM is not present in the MS, or the UICC
containing the USIM is present in the MS and the MCC part of the IMSI in the
USIM is present in the RLOS allowed MCC list configured in the USIM (see 3GPP
TS 31.102 [40]) or in the ME (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50]);
\- one or more PLMNs offering access to RLOS has been found;
\- registration cannot be achieved on any PLMN; and
\- the MS is in limited service state,
the MS shall select a PLMN offering access to RLOS as follows:
a) if at least one preferred PLMN exists based on the RLOS preferred PLMN list
configured in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) or in the ME (see 3GPP TS
24.368 [50]) and the MCC part of the preferred PLMN ID is present in the RLOS
allowed MCC list configured in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) or in the ME
(see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50]), the MS shall select the preferred PLMN offering
access to RLOS and indicate the selected preferred PLMN for access to RLOS;
and
b) if none of the preferred PLMNs for access to RLOS is available, the MS
shall evaluate the remaining PLMNs offering access to RLOS that are not in the
RLOS preferred PLMN list. If the MCC part of a PLMN ID is present in the RLOS
allowed MCC list configured in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) or in the ME
(see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50]), the MS shall select this PLMN and indicate the
selected PLMN for access to RLOS.
If registration cannot be achieved because no PLMNs are available and
allowable, and if no PLMN offering access to RLOS has been found, or none of
the PLMNs offering access to RLOS is allowed to be accessed according to the
RLOS allowed MCC list configured in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) or in
the ME (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50]), or the MS does not support access to RLOS,
the MS indicates \"no service\" to the user, waits until a new PLMN is
available and then repeats the procedure.
##### 4.4.3.1.2 Manual Network Selection Mode Procedure
The MS indicates whether there are any PLMNs, which are available using all
supported access technologies. This includes PLMNs in the \"forbidden PLMNs\"
list, \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" list, PLMNs which only offer
services not supported by the MS, and the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to
operate at the present UE location\". An MS which supports GSM COMPACT shall
also indicate GSM COMPACT PLMNs (which use PBCCH).
If displayed, PLMNs meeting the criteria above are presented in the following
order:
i) either the HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or, if one
or more of the EHPLMNs are available then based on an optional data field on
the SIM either only the highest priority available EHPLMN is to be presented
to the user or all available EHPLMNs are presented to the user in priority
order. If the data field is not present on the SIM, then only the highest
priority available EHPLMN is presented;
ii) PLMN/access technology combinations contained in the \" User Controlled
PLMN Selector with Access Technology \" data file in the SIM (in priority
order);
iii) PLMN/access technology combinations contained in the \"Operator
Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file in the SIM (in
priority order) or stored in the ME (in priority order);
iv) other PLMN/access technology combinations with received high quality
signal in random order;
NOTE 1: High quality signal is defined in the appropriate AS specification.
v) other PLMN/access technology combinations in order of decreasing signal
quality.
In ii and iii, an MS using a SIM without access technology information storage
(i.e. the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" and the
\"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data files are
not present) shall instead present the PLMNs contained in the \"PLMN
Selector\" data file in the SIM (in priority order).
In v, requirement h) in clause 4.4.3.1.1 applies.
In i to v, requirements j), k) and l) in clause 4.4.3.1.1 apply.
In iii, requirement p) in clause 4.4.3.1.1 applies.
In GSM COMPACT, the non-support of voice services shall be indicated to the
user.
The HPLMN may provide on the SIM additional information on the available
PLMNs. If this information is provided, then the MS shall indicate it to the
user. This information, provided as free text may include:
\- preferred partner,
\- roaming agreement status,
\- supported services
Furthermore, the MS may indicate whether the available PLMNs are present on
the EHPLMN list, the Forbidden list, the User Controlled PLMN List or the
Operator Controlled PLMN List. The MS may also indicate that the PLMN is not
present on any of these lists.
If:
\- the MS supports MINT;
\- the MS is not registered via non-3GPP access connected to 5GCN;
\- the MS has detected that the RPLMN is a MS determined PLMN with disaster
condition as broadcasted by an NG-RAN cell of an available PLMN(s) (see clause
4.4.3.1.1);
\- only forbidden PLMN(s) are available; and
\- the MS receives indication that some of the forbidden PLMN(s) provide
disaster roaming services to the MS(s) of the RPLMN (see clause 4.4.3.1.1),
then the MS may indicate to the user that those PLMN(s) support disaster
roaming services.
In i to v, if the MS supports CAG, for each PLMN/access technology combination
of NG-RAN access technology, the MS shall present to the user:
a) the PLMN/access technology combination and a list of CAG-IDs composed of
one or more CAG-IDs such that for each CAG-ID:
1) there is an available CAG cell which broadcasts the CAG-ID for the PLMN;
and
2) the following is true:
i) there exists an entry with the PLMN ID of the PLMN in the \"CAG information
list\" and the CAG-ID is authorized based on the \"Allowed CAG list\" of the
entry; or
ii) the available CAG cell broadcasting the CAG-ID for the PLMN also
broadcasts that the PLMN allows a user to manually select the CAG-ID.
For each of the presented CAG-ID, the MS may indicate to the user whether the
CAG-ID is authorized based on the \"Allowed CAG list\" stored in the UE; and
b) the PLMN/access technology combination without a list of CAG-IDs, if there
is an available NG-RAN cell which is not a CAG cell for the PLMN. If there
exists an entry for the presented PLMN in the \"CAG information list\" and the
entry includes an \"indication that the MS is only allowed to access 5GS via
CAG cells\", the MS may indicate to the user that the MS is only allowed to
access the PLMN via CAG cells.
If the NAS receives a human-readable network name associated with a CAG-ID and
a PLMN ID from the AS, the human-readable network name shall be sent along
with the CAG-ID and PLMN ID to the upper layer for use in manual CAG
selection.
NOTE 2: A human-readable network name can be broadcasted per CAG-ID and PLMN
ID by a CAG cell.
Upon selection of a PLMN (and CAG-ID if the user selected a desired CAG-ID as
well) by the user, the NAS shall provide the AS with the selected PLMN ID (and
CAG-ID if the user selected a desired CAG-ID as well or an indication to
select a non-CAG cell if the user did not select any CAG-ID) and the MS
initiates registration on this PLMN (and on a cell which broadcasts the CAG-ID
if the user selected a desired CAG-ID as well) using the access technology
chosen by the user for that PLMN or using the highest priority available
access technology for that PLMN, if the associated access technologies have a
priority order (this may take place at any time during the presentation of
PLMNs). For such a registration, the MS shall ignore the contents of the
\"forbidden location areas for roaming\", \"forbidden tracking areas for
roaming\", \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", \"forbidden location
areas for regional provision of service\", \"forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service\", \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\", \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\", \"PLMNs not
allowed to operate at the present UE location\" and \"forbidden PLMNs\" lists.
Also for such a registration, if the NAS has provided the AS with an
indication to select:
\- a non-CAG cell, the MS shall ignore the \"indication that the MS is only
allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells\", if any, in the \"CAG information list\"
for the selected PLMN; or
\- a selected CAG-ID and the CAG-ID is not authorized based on the \"Allowed
CAG list\" associated with that PLMN in the \"CAG information list\", the MS
shall consider the selected CAG-ID of the selected PLMN as authorized based on
the \"Allowed CAG list\" for the selected PLMN for this registration attempt.
NOTE 3: It is an MS implementation option whether to indicate access
technologies to the user. If the MS does display access technologies, then the
access technology selected by the user is only used for initial registration
on the selected PLMN. If the MS does not display access technologies, then the
access technology chosen for a particular PLMN should be the highest priority
available access technology for that PLMN, if the associated access
technologies have a priority order, and is only used for initial registration.
If the MS has, or is establishing, a PDU session for emergency services, a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services or a PDP context for emergency bearer
services or CS emergency call, being registered for emergency services or
having an ongoing emergency services fallback procedure, manual network
selection shall not be performed.
After selection of a PLMN and CAG-ID, if the AS does not provide an indication
of finding a cell belonging to the selected PLMN and which broadcasts the
selected CAG-ID for the registration procedure (see 3GPP TS 38.304 [40]),
then:
i) the MS shall indicate to user that it can not find the selected PLMN and
CAG-ID; and
ii) If there is an \"indication that the MS is only allowed to access 5GS via
CAG cells\" in the \"CAG information list\" for the selected PLMN, the MS may
attempt to camp on a suitable CAG cell broadcasting a CAG-ID authorized based
on the \"Allowed CAG list\" for the selected PLMN or an acceptable cell,
otherwise the MS may attempt to camp on a suitable cell belonging to the
selected PLMN (i.e. a non-CAG cell or a CAG cell broadcasting a CAG-ID
authorized based on the \"Allowed CAG list\" for the selected PLMN) or an
acceptable cell.
Once the MS has registered on a PLMN selected by the user, the MS shall not
automatically register on a different PLMN unless:
i) the new PLMN is declared as an equivalent PLMN by the registered PLMN. If
the MS is registered for disaster roaming services, the UE shall also detect
that the new PLMN offers disaster roaming services to the MS determined PLMN
with disaster condition as broadcasted by the NG-RAN cell of the new PLMN (see
clause 4.4.3.1.1) and that the MS determined PLMN with disaster condition in
the old PLMN is also a MS determined PLMN with disaster condition in the new
PLMN;
ii) the user selects automatic mode;
iii) the user initiates an emergency call while the MS is in limited service
state and either the network does not broadcast the indication of support of
emergency calls in limited service state, the registration request for
emergency services is rejected by the network or the attach request for
emergency bearer services is rejected by the network; or
iv) the user initiates access to RLOS, while the MS is in limited service
state and either the network does not broadcast the indication of support of
RLOS in limited service state, or the EPS attach request for access to RLOS is
rejected by the network, or the EPS tracking area update request for access to
RLOS is rejected by the network.
NOTE 4: If case iii) or iv) occurs, the MS can provide an indication to the
upper layers that the MS has exited manual network selection mode.
Once the MS has registered on a PLMN selected by the user, the MS may
automatically register on a different PLMN if:
1) the MS supports MINT;
2) the \"list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\" is non-empty;
3) there is no available PLMN which is declared as an equivalent PLMN by the
RPLMN; and
4) the RPLMN of the MS is considered as the MS determined PLMN with disaster
condition based on the determination of the MS determined PLMN with disaster
condition as specified in clause 4.4.3.1.1.
NOTE 5: If the above case occurs, the MS can provide an indication to the
upper layers that the MS has exited manual network selection mode.
If the user does not select a PLMN (or PLMN and CAG-ID), the selected PLMN
shall be the one that was selected before the PLMN selection procedure
started. If no such PLMN was selected or that PLMN is no longer available,
then the MS shall attempt to camp on any acceptable cell and enter the limited
service state.
If:
\- the MS supports access to RLOS;
\- either the UICC containing the USIM is not present in the MS, or the UICC
containing the USIM is present in the MS and the MCC part of the IMSI in the
USIM is present in the RLOS allowed MCC list configured in the USIM (see 3GPP
TS 31.102 [40]) or in the ME (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50]);
\- one or more PLMNs offering access to RLOS has been found;
\- registration cannot be achieved on any PLMN; and
\- the MS is in limited service state,
the MS indicates the PLMNs offering access to RLOS, presented in the following
order:
i) PLMNs contained in the RLOS preferred PLMN list configured in the USIM (see
3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) or in the ME (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50]) (in priority
order) if the MCC part of the preferred PLMN ID is present in the RLOS allowed
MCC list configured in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) or in the ME (see
3GPP TS 24.368 [50]); and
ii) any of the remaining PLMNs offering access to RLOS that are not in the
RLOS preferred PLMN list if the MCC part of the PLMN ID is present in the RLOS
allowed MCC list configured in the USIM (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) or in the ME
(see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50]).
Upon selection of a PLMN by the user, the MS initiates registration for access
to RLOS on the PLMN chosen by the user (this may take place at any time during
the presentation of PLMNs).
##### 4.4.3.1.3 Manual CSG selection
##### 4.4.3.1.3.1 General {#general-1 .H6}
The HPLMN may configure the MS whether to provide to the user CSGs for a
certain PLMN without any restriction or to provide to the user only CSGs in
the Operator CSG List for that PLMN.This configuration may be done either:
\- in the USIM if the Operator CSG list is available in the USIM; or
\- as described in 3GPP TS 24.285 [47].
In the absence of such configuration from the HPLMN for a certain PLMN, the MS
shall by default provide to the user CSGs for that PLMN without any
restriction.
For PLMNs where no restriction is configured, the MS provides to the user the
CSGs that are available and the associated PLMNs using all access technologies
which support CSGs (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [22A]) and which are supported by the
MS. For each entry in the list, an indication is provided whether that CSG
identity is in the Allowed CSG list or in the Operator CSG list stored in the
MS for this PLMN.
For PLMNs where the MS is configured to provide to the user only CSGs in the
Operator CSG List, the MS provides to the user the CSGs that are available and
in the Operator CSG list, using all access technologies which support CSGs
(see 3GPP TS 23.003 [22A]) and which are supported by the MS. For each entry
in the list, the MS provides to the user the associated PLMN and an indication
that the CSG identity is in the Operator CSG List stored in the MS for this
PLMN.
Additional requirements for the display, including for the display of HNB
name, can be found in 3GPP TS 22.220 [49].
The user may select a CSG from the indicated CSGs.
If the MS has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, manual CSG
selection shall not be performed.
##### 4.4.3.1.3.2 Manual CSG selection within the RPLMN {#manual-csg-
selection-within-the-rplmn .H6}
If the user selects a CSG whose CSG identity is not included in the Allowed
CSG list or Operator CSG list, then the MS shall attempt to register on a cell
that corresponds to the CSG. For such a registration, the MS shall ignore the
contents of the \"forbidden location areas for roaming\", \"forbidden tracking
areas for roaming\", \"forbidden location areas for regional provision of
service\", \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" and
\"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" lists.
Upon successful or unsuccessful completion of the registration or if
registration is not possible, because the MS is no longer in the coverage of
the selected CSG, the MS shall return to automatic CSG selection mode.
Manual CSG selection within the RPLMN does not affect the current PLMN
selection mode.
##### 4.4.3.1.3.3 Manual CSG selection in a PLMN different from the RPLMN
{#manual-csg-selection-in-a-plmn-different-from-the-rplmn .H6}
If the user selects a CSG in a PLMN that is different from the RPLMN, then the
following applies:
i) The MS shall store a duplicate of the RPLMN and a duplicate of the PLMN
selection mode that were in use before the manual CSG selection was initiated,
unless this manual CSG selection follows another manual CSG selection or a
PLMN selection triggered by ProSe communications as specified in clause 3.1B
or a PLMN selection triggered by V2X communication over PC5 as specified in
clause 3.1C or a PLMN selection triggered by A2X communication over PC5 as
specified in clause 3.1D;
ii) The MS shall enter into Manual mode of PLMN selection in state M4 (Trying
PLMN) as defined in clause 4.3.1.2;
iii) The MS shall select the PLMN corresponding to the CSG and attempt to
register on the selected CSG cell in the PLMN. For such a registration, the MS
shall ignore the contents of the \"forbidden location areas for roaming\",
\"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", \"forbidden location areas for
regional provision of service\", \"forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\", \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" and \"forbidden
PLMNs\" lists. If the registration is successful the MS remains in manual CSG
selection mode, until the user selects automatic CSG selection mode, the MS is
switched off or the condition of any of items iv) to viii) below is fulfilled;
iv) If the registration fails or the MS is no longer in the coverage of the
selected CSG, then the MS shall return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection
mode and automatic CSG selection mode and use the stored duplicate value of
RPLMN for further action;
v) If the MS is switched off while on the selected CSG and switched on again,
the MS should return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode, unless the
MS provides the optional feature of user preferred PLMN selection operating
mode at switch on. Additionally, the MS shall use the stored duplicate value
of RPLMN and automatic CSG selection mode for further action;
vi) If the user initiates a PLMN selection while on the selected CSG, the MS
shall delete the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode, use the stored
duplicate value of RPLMN as RPLMN, return to automatic CSG selection mode and
follow the procedures (as specified for switch-on or recovery from lack of
coverage) in clause 4.4.3.1. The MS shall delete the stored duplicate value of
RPLMN once the PLMN selection has been completed successfully;
vii) If the MS\'s E-UTRA capability is disabled as a result of successful
registration (as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A] clauses 5.5.1.3.4.2,
5.5.1.3.4.3, 5.5.3.3.4.2 and 5.5.3.3.4.3) and the selected CSG is not
available on UTRAN radio access technology, the MS shall re-enable the E-UTRA
capability, return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection mode and automatic
CSG selection mode and use the stored duplicate value of RPLMN for further
action; and
viii) If the MS\'s E-UTRA capability is disabled as a result of performing the
service request procedure (as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A] clause
5.6.1.5), the selected CSG is not available on UTRAN radio access technology
and the MS performed a CS call, then after the end of the call, the MS shall
re-enable the E-UTRA capability, return to the stored duplicate PLMN selection
mode and automatic CSG selection mode and use the stored duplicate value of
RPLMN for further action.
#### 4.4.3.2 User reselection
At any time the user may request the MS to initiate reselection and
registration onto an available PLMN, according to the following procedures,
dependent upon the operating mode.
##### 4.4.3.2.1 Automatic Network Selection Mode
The MS selects and attempts registration on PLMN/access technology
combinations, if available and allowable, in all of its bands of operation in
accordance with the following order:
i) the HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or the highest
priority EHPLMN that is available (if the EHPLMN list is present);
ii) PLMN/access technology combinations contained in the \"User Controlled
PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file in the SIM (in priority
order) excluding the previously selected PLMN/access technology combination;
iii) PLMN/access technology combinations contained in the \"Operator
Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" data file in the SIM (in
priority order) or stored in the ME (in priority order) excluding the
previously selected PLMN/access technology combination;
iv) other PLMN/access technology combinations with the received high quality
signal in random order excluding the previously selected PLMN/access
technology combination;
NOTE 1: High quality signal is defined in the appropriate AS specification.
v) other PLMN/access technology combinations, excluding the previously
selected PLMN/access technology combination in order of decreasing signal
quality or, alternatively, the previously selected PLMN/access technology
combination may be chosen ignoring its signal quality;
vi) The previously selected PLMN/access technology combination.
The previously selected PLMN/access technology combination is the PLMN/access
technology combination which the MS has selected prior to the start of the
user reselection procedure.
NOTE 2: If the previously selected PLMN is chosen, and registration has not
been attempted on any other PLMNs, then the MS is already registered on the
PLMN, and so registration is not necessary.
The equivalent PLMNs list shall not be applied to the user reselection in
Automatic Network Selection Mode.
When following the above procedure, the requirements a), b), c), e), f), g),
h), j), k), l), m), n), o), p) and v) in clause 4.4.3.1.1 apply: Requirement
d) shall apply as shown below:
d) In iv, v, and vi, the MS shall search for all access technologies it is
capable of before deciding which PLMN/access technology combination to select.
##### 4.4.3.2.2 Manual Network Selection Mode
The Manual Network Selection Mode Procedure of clause 4.4.3.1.2 is followed.
##### 4.4.3.2.3 Manual CSG selection
The procedure of clause 4.4.3.1.3 is followed.
#### 4.4.3.3 In VPLMN
##### 4.4.3.3.1 Automatic and manual network selection modes
##### 4.4.3.3.1.1 Automatic and manual network selection modes when not
registered for disaster roaming services {#automatic-and-manual-network-
selection-modes-when-not-registered-for-disaster-roaming-services .H6}
If the MS is in a VPLMN and not registered for disaster roaming services, and
the MS shall periodically attempt to obtain service on its HPLMN (if the
EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or one of its EHPLMNs (if the EHPLMN
list is present) or a higher priority PLMN/access technology combinations
listed in \"user controlled PLMN selector\" or \"operator controlled PLMN
selector\" by scanning in accordance with the requirements that are applicable
to i), ii) and iii) as defined in the Automatic Network Selection Mode in
clause 4.4.3.1.1.
NOTE 1: Additionally if signal level enhanced network selection is applicable
and the received signal quality of the registered PLMN is lower than the
\"_Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology_ \"_, the
procedures defined in clause_ 4.4.3.5 _are applicable_.
For this purpose, a value of timer T may be stored in the SIM. The
interpretation of the stored value depends on the radio capabilities supported
by the MS:
\- For an MS that does not support any of the following: EC-GSM-IoT, Category
M1 or Category NB1 (as defined in 3GPP TS 36.306 [54]);
a) if the MS is in a VPLMN through satellite NG-RAN access or satellite
E-UTRAN access with a shared MCC, T is in the range 6 multiplied by integer M
minutes to 8 multiplied by integer M hours in 6 multiplied by integer M
minutes steps or T indicates that no periodic attempts shall be made. If no
value for M is stored in the SIM, a default value of M equal to one is used;
or
b) otherwise, T is either in the range 6 minutes to 8 hours in 6 minutes steps
or it indicates that no periodic attempts shall be made. If no value for T is
stored in the SIM, a default value of 60 minutes is used for T.
\- For an MS that only supports any of the following or a combination of: EC-
GSM-IoT, Category M1 or Category NB1 (as defined in 3GPP TS 36.306 [54]), T is
either in the range 2 hours to 240 hours, using 2 hour steps from 2 hours to
80 hours and 4 hour steps from 84 hours to 240 hours, or it indicates that no
periodic attempts shall be made. If no value for T is stored in the SIM, a
default value of 72 hours is used.
\- For an MS that supports both:
a) any of the following or a combination of: EC-GSM-IoT, Category M1 or
Category NB1 (as defined in 3GPP TS 36.306 [54]); and
b) any other than the following: EC-GSM-IoT, Category M1 or Category NB1 (as
defined in 3GPP TS 36.306 [54]),
T is interpreted depending on what is in use as specified below:
a) if the MS is using any of the following at the time of starting timer T:
EC-GSM-IoT, Category M1 or Category NB1 (as defined in 3GPP TS 36.306 [54]), T
is either in the range 2 hours to 240 hours, using 2 hour steps from 2 hours
to 80 hours and 4 hour steps from 84 hours to 240 hours, or it indicates that
no periodic attempts shall be made. If no value for T is stored in the SIM, a
default value of 72 hours is used; and
b) if the MS is not using any of the following at the time of starting timer
T: EC-GSM-IoT, Category M1 or Category NB1 (as defined in 3GPP TS 36.306
[54]), T is either in the range 6 minutes to 8 hours in 6 minutes steps or it
indicates that no periodic attempts shall be made. If the MS is using the
satellite NG-RAN access technology or the satellite E-UTRAN access technology
with a shared MCC at the time of starting timer T: T is in the range 6
multiplied by integer M minutes to 8 multiplied by integer M hours in 6
multiplied by integer M minutes steps. If no value for M is stored in the SIM,
a default value of M equal to one is used. If no value for T is stored in the
SIM, a default value of 60 minutes is used for T.
If the MS is configured with the MinimumPeriodicSearchTimer as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [50] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [40], the MS shall not use a value for T
that is less than the MinimumPeriodicSearchTimer. If the value stored in the
SIM, or the default value for T (when no value is stored in the SIM), is less
than the MinimumPeriodicSearchTimer, then T shall be set to the
MinimumPeriodicSearchTimer.
The MS does not stop timer T, as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [23] and 3GPP TS
24.301 [23A], when it activates power saving mode (PSM) (see 3GPP TS 23.682
[27A]) or mobile initiated connection only mode (MICO) as described in 3GPP TS
24.501 [64].
The MS does not stop timer T, as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [23] and 3GPP TS
24.301 [23A], when the access stratum is de-activated due to discontinuous
coverage (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [58] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A]).
The MS does not stop timer T when it activates unavailability period as
described in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64].
The MS can be configured for Fast First Higher Priority PLMN search as
specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [40] or 3GPP TS 24.368 [50]. Fast First Higher
Priority PLMN search is enabled if the corresponding configuration parameter
is present and set to enabled. Otherwise, Fast First Higher Priority PLMN
search is disabled.
The attempts to access the HPLMN or an EHPLMN or higher priority PLMN shall be
as specified below:
a) The periodic attempts shall only be performed in automatic mode when the MS
is roaming, and not while the MS is attached for emergency bearer services, is
registered for emergency services, has a PDU session for emergency services or
has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services;
b) The MS shall make the first attempt after a period of at least 2 minutes
and at most the time configured for T:
\- only after switch on if Fast First Higher Priority PLMN search is disabled;
or
\- after switch on or upon selecting a VPLMN if Fast First Higher Priority
PLMN search is enabled.
c) The MS shall make the following attempts if the MS is on the VPLMN at time
T after the last attempt according to the present clause or according to
clause 4.4.3.5;
d) Periodic attempts shall only be performed by the MS while in idle mode or
5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]);
d1) Periodic attempts may be postponed while the MS is in power saving mode
(PSM) (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [27A]) or when the access stratum is deactivated due
to discontinuous coverage (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [58] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A]).
d2) Periodic attempts may be postponed while the MS is receiving eMBMS
transport service in idle mode (see 3GPP TS 23.246 [68]).
d3) Periodic attempts may be postponed while the MS is receiving broadcast MBS
service in idle mode (see 3GPP TS 23.247 [85]).
d4) Periodic attempts may be postponed till the next eDRX occasion while the
MS is configured with eDRX.
d5) Periodic attempts may be postponed while the MS is in relaxed monitoring
(see 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]).
d6) Periodic attempts may be postponed while the MS is in Mobile Initiated
Connection Only mode (MICO).
d7) Periodic attempts may be postponed while the MS unavailability period is
activated as described in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64].
e) If the HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or a EHPLMN
(if the list is present) or a higher priority PLMN is not found, the MS shall
remain on the VPLMN.
f) In steps i), ii) and iii) of clause 4.4.3.1.1 the MS shall limit its
attempts to access higher priority PLMN/access technology combinations to
PLMN/access technology combinations of the same country as the current serving
VPLMN, as defined in Annex B.
EXCEPTION: If the MS is in a VPLMN through satellite NG-RAN access or
satellite E-UTRAN access with a shared MCC, the MS may attempt to access
higher priority PLMN/access technology combinations irrespective of their MCC
values.
EXCEPTION: If the MS is in a VPLMN, the MS may attempt to access higher
priority PLMNs with a shared MCC with satellite NG-RAN access technology or
satellite E-UTRAN access technology irrespective of their MCC values.
f1) In the case that the MS has a stored \"Equivalent PLMNs\" list the MS
shall only select a PLMN if it is of a higher priority than those of the same
country as the current serving PLMN which are stored in the \"Equivalent
PLMNs\" list.
EXCEPTION: If the MS is in a VPLMN through satellite NG-RAN access or
satellite E-UTRAN access with a shared MCC, the MS shall only select a PLMN if
it is of a higher priority than those which are stored in the \"Equivalent
PLMNs\" list.
EXCEPTION: If the MS is in a VPLMN, the MS shall only select a PLMN if it is
of a higher priority than those of the same country as the current serving
PLMN or those with a shared MCC with satellite NG-RAN access technology or
satellite E-UTRAN access technology which are stored in the \"Equivalent
PLMNs\" list.
g) Only the priority levels of Equivalent PLMNs of the same country as the
current serving VPLMN, as defined in Annex B, and which are not in the list of
\"PLMNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\" if the UE has a list of
\"PLMNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\" shall be taken into
account to compare with the priority level of a selected PLMN.
h) If the PLMN of the highest priority PLMN/access technology combination
available is the current VPLMN, or one of the PLMNs in the \"Equivalent
PLMNs\" list and is not in the list of \"PLMNs where registration was aborted
due to SOR\" if the UE has a list of \"PLMNs where registration was aborted
due to SOR\", the MS shall remain on the current PLMN/access technology
combination.
i) In step iii) of clause 4.4.3.1.1 the MS shall consider PLMNs which are in
the list of \"PLMNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\" as lowest
priority, if the UE has a list of \"PLMNs where registration was aborted due
to SOR\".
j) In steps i), ii) and iii) of clause 4.4.3.1.1, if signal level enhanced
network selection is applicable (see clause 3.11 and step d) of clause
4.4.3.5), the MS shall only select a PLMN, if the received signal quality of
the candidate PLMN/access technology combination is equal to or greater than
the \"_Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology_ \".
NOTE 2: As an MS implementation option, the MS can make an attempt when the
timer TD, TE, TF, TG or TH expires and there is a PLMN/access technology
combination which the MS could not select while the timer was running (e.g.
the PLMN was in the list of PLMNs where voice service was not possible in
E-UTRAN) that is higher priority than the current serving PLMN and belongs to
the same country as the current serving PLMN, as defined in Annex B.
NOTE 3: As an MS implementation option, upon a transition in or out of
international areas, a UE supporting satellite NG-RAN or satellite E-UTRAN can
attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as defined in this clause.
It is up to the UE implementation to determine when it is transitioning in and
out of international areas. What constitutes an international area is out of
scope of this specification and not the responsibility of 3GPP.
##### 4.4.3.3.1.2 Automatic and manual network selection modes when registered
for disaster roaming services {#automatic-and-manual-network-selection-modes-
when-registered-for-disaster-roaming-services .H6}
If the MS is registered for disaster roaming services, the MS shall
periodically attempt to obtain service on an allowable PLMN of the same
country as the current serving PLMN in accordance with the requirements as
defined in the Automatic Network Selection Mode in clause 4.4.3.1.1.
If the MS is registered for disaster roaming services, timer T is either in
the range 30 minutes to 40 hours in 30 minute steps, or it indicates that no
periodic attempts shall be made. If no value for T is stored in the SIM, a
default value of 60 minutes is used for T.
If the MS is configured with the MinimumPeriodicSearchTimer as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [50] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [40], the MS shall not use a value for T
that is less than the MinimumPeriodicSearchTimer. If the value stored in the
SIM, or the default value for T (when no value is stored in the SIM), is less
than the MinimumPeriodicSearchTimer, then T shall be set to the
MinimumPeriodicSearchTimer.
The MS does not stop timer T, as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [23] and 3GPP TS
24.301 [23A], when it activates power saving mode (PSM) (see 3GPP TS 23.682
[27A]) or mobile initiated connection only mode (MICO) as described in 3GPP TS
24.501 [64].
The MS does not stop timer T when it activates unavailability period as
described in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64].
The attempts to obtain service on an allowable PLMN shall be as specified
below:
a) The periodic attempts shall only be performed in automatic mode when the MS
is registered for disaster roaming services and does not have a PDU session
for emergency services;
a1) The MS shall make the first attempt after a period of at least 2 minutes
and at most the time configured for T upon selecting a VPLMN for disaster
roaming;
b) The MS shall make the following attempts if the MS is registered for
disaster roaming services at time T after the last attempt;
c) The periodic attempts shall only be performed by the MS while in idle mode
or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]);
d) The periodic attempts may be postponed:
\- while the MS is in power saving mode (PSM) (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [27A]);
\- while the MS is receiving eMBMS transport service in idle mode (see 3GPP TS
23.246 [68]);
\- while the MS is receiving broadcast MBS service in idle mode (see 3GPP TS
23.247 [85]);
\- till the next eDRX occasion while the MS is configured with eDRX;
\- while the MS is in relaxed monitoring (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]);
\- while the MS is in Mobile Initiated Connection Only mode (MICO).
\- while the unavailability period is activated in MS as described in 3GPP TS
24.501 [64].
e) The MS shall limit its attempts to access allowable PLMN/access technology
combinations of the same country as the current serving VPLMN, as defined in
Annex B.
EXCEPTION: If the MS is in a VPLMN through satellite NG-RAN access or
satellite E-UTRAN access with a shared MCC, the MS may attempt to access
higher priority PLMN/access technology combinations irrespective of their MCC
values.
EXCEPTION: If the MS is in a VPLMN through non-satellite access, the MS may
attempt to access higher priority PLMNs with a shared MCC with satellite NG-
RAN access technology or satellite E-UTRAN access technology.
##### 4.4.3.3.2 Manual CSG selection
The procedure of clause 4.4.3.1.3 is followed.
#### 4.4.3.4 Investigation Scan for higher prioritized PLMN
The support of this procedure is mandatory if the ME supports GSM COMPACT and
otherwise optional.
An MS capable of both GSM voice and packet service shall, when indicated in
the SIM, investigate if there is service from a higher prioritized PLMN not
offering GSM voice service, either HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or
is empty) or one of its EHPLMNs (if the EHPLMN list is present) or a PLMN in a
\"PLMN Selector with Access Technology \" data file on the SIM.
The MS shall scan for PLMNs in accordance with the requirements described for
automatic network selection mode in clause 4.4.3.1.1 that are applicable to
i), ii) and iii) with the exception of requirement a) and b) in clause
4.4.3.1. Requirement a) and b) that are specified for automatic network
selection mode in clause 4.4.3.1 shall be ignored during the investigation
scan.
If indicated on the SIM, the investigation scan shall be performed:
i) After each successful PLMN selection and registration is completed, when
the MS is in idle mode. This investigation scan may rely on the information
from the already performed PLMN selection and may not necessarily require a
rescan
ii) When the MS is unable to obtain normal service from a PLMN, (limited
service state) see clause 3.5.
The investigation scan is restricted to automatic selection mode and shall
only be performed by an MS that is capable of both voice and packet data. It
shall only be performed if the selected PLMN is not already the highest
prioritized PLMN in the current country. (HPLMN in home country, otherwise
according to PLMN selector lists)
The MS shall return to RPLMN after the investigation scan is performed.
If a higher prioritized PLMN not offering GSM voice service is found, this
shall be indicated to the user. The MS shall not select the PLMN unless
requested by the user.
#### 4.4.3.5 Periodic attempts for signal level enhanced network selection
If signal level enhanced network selection is applicable (see clause 3.11) and
the received signal quality of registered PLMN observed over an averaging
window is lower than the \"Operator controlled signal threshold per access
technology\" the MS shall periodically attempt to obtain service on an
allowable PLMN/access technology combination for which the received signal
quality of the candidate PLMN/access technology combination is equal to or
greater than the \"_Operator controlled signal threshold per access
technology_ \" in accordance with the requirements that are applicable to i),
ii), iii), iv) and v) as defined in the Automatic Network Selection Mode in
clause 4.4.3.1.1. For this purpose, the value of the timer T~SENSE~ is
configured with an MS implementation specific value with a minimum value of 2
min and a maximum value set to the value applicable for timer T as defined in
clause 4.4.3.3.1.1.
The averaging window shall be shorter than the value of the timer T~SENSE~.
The MS does not stop timer T~SENSE~, as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [23] and
3GPP TS 24.301 [23A], when it activates power saving mode (PSM) (see 3GPP TS
23.682 [27A]) or mobile initiated connection only mode (MICO) as described in
3GPP TS 24.501 [64].
The MS does not stop timer T~SENSE~, as described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [23] and
3GPP TS 24.301 [23A], when the access stratum is de-activated due to
discontinuous coverage (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [58] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A]).
The attempts to obtain service on an allowable PLMN shall be as specified
below:
a) The periodic attempts shall only be performed in automatic mode, and not
while the MS is attached for emergency bearer services, is registered for
emergency services, has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services or has
a PDU session for emergency services.
b) When the MS detects that the received signal quality of the current cell of
the registered PLMN is below the \"_Operator controlled signal threshold per
access technology_ \" either upon registration or any time later, the MS shall
start timer T~SENSE,~ if not already running.
c) If upon expiry of timer T~SENSE~ the received signal quality of the
registered PLMN observed over an averaging window is equal to or greater than
the \"_Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology_ \" the MS
shall stay on the current selected PLMN. If timer T defined in _clause_
4.4.3.3.1.1 expires while timer T~SENSE~ is running and the received signal
quality of registered PLMN observed over an averaging window is lower than the
\"Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology\", the MS shall
stop timer T~SENSE~ and shall perform the actions defined in this clause
instead of the action defined for timer T expiry defined in _clause_
4.4.3.3.1.1.
d) If the received signal quality of the registered PLMN and all _other
available and allowable PLMN/_ access technology combinations are lower than
the \"_Operator controlled signal threshold per access technology_ \"_, the MS
shall stop applying_ signal level enhanced network selection and repeat _the
network selection procedure as specified in clause_ 4.4.3.3.1.1 _._
e) The attempts shall only be performed by the MS while in idle mode or 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
f) The attempts may be postponed:
\- while the MS is in power saving mode (PSM) (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [27A]) or
when the access stratum is deactivated due to discontinuous coverage (see 3GPP
TS 23.401 [58] and 3GPP TS 24.301 [23A]);
\- while the MS is receiving eMBMS transport service in idle mode (see 3GPP TS
23.246 [68]);
\- till the next eDRX occasion while the MS is configured with eDRX;
\- while the MS is in relaxed monitoring (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [43]);
\- while the MS is in Mobile Initiated Connection Only mode (MICO).
g) The MS shall limit its attempts to access allowable PLMN/access technology
combinations of the same country as the current serving VPLMN, as defined in
Annex B.
EXCEPTION: If the MS is in a VPLMN through satellite NG-RAN access or
satellite E-UTRAN access with a shared MCC, the MS may attempt to access
higher priority PLMN/access technology combinations irrespective of their MCC
values.
EXCEPTION: If the MS is in a VPLMN through non-satellite access, the MS may
attempt to access higher priority PLMNs with a shared MCC with satellite NG-
RAN access technology or satellite E-UTRAN access technology.
### 4.4.4 Abnormal cases
If there is no SIM in the MS, if there is an authentication failure, or if the
MS receives an \"IMSI unknown in HLR\", \"illegal ME\" or \"illegal MS\"
response to an LR request, then effectively there is no selected PLMN (\"No
SIM\" state). In these cases, the states of the cell selection process are
such that no PLMN selection information is used. Except when performing GPRS
attach, EPS attach for emergency bearer services, an initial registration for
emergency services, or EPS attach for access to RLOS, no further attempts at
registration on any PLMN are made until the MS is switched off and on again,
or a SIM is inserted. When performing GPRS attach, EPS attach for emergency
bearer services, an initial registration for emergency services or EPS attach
for access to RLOS, the PLMN of the current serving cell is temporarily
considered as the selected PLMN.
When in Automatic Network Selection mode and the MS is in the \"not updated\"
state with one or more suitable cells to camp on; then after the maximum
allowed unsuccessful LR requests (controlled by the specific attempt counters)
the MS may continue (or start if it is not running) the user reselection
procedure of clause 4.4.3.2.1.
A multi mode MS that also supports 3GPP2 access technology may fall back to
3GPP2 mode if no SIM is inserted.
### 4.4.5 Roaming not allowed in this LA or TA
If in either PLMN selection mode the LR response \"Roaming not allowed in this
LA\" or \"Roaming not allowed in this TA\" is received:
The PLMN Automatic or Manual Mode Selection Procedure of clause 4.4.3.1 are
followed, depending on whether the MS is in automatic or manual mode.
### 4.4.6 Steering of roaming
If the MS receives a USAT REFRESH command qualifier (3GPP TS 31.111 [41]) of
type \"Steering of Roaming\", the MS shall:
a) replace the highest priority entries in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the ME with the list provided
in the REFRESH command, if any, or replace the SOR-CMCI in the ME with the
SOR-CMCI provided in REFRESH command, if any, or both;
b) delete the PLMNs identified by the list in the REFRESH command from the
Forbidden PLMN list and from the Forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service list, if
they are present in these lists. This includes any information stored in the
SIM and the ME internal memory;
c) take the new information into account in subsequent attempts to access a
higher priority PLMN; and
d) attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause
4.4.3.3 by acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired.
In order to avoid unnecessary signalling, the network operator should avoid
repeatedly using steering of roaming of a particular MS.
## 4.5 Location registration process
### 4.5.1 General
When the MS is switched on and capable of services requiring registration, the
action taken by the location registration process is as follows:
a) SIM present and no LR needed (because of the status of the stored
registration area identity and \"attach\" flag): The MS is in the update state
\"Updated\";
b) SIM present and LR needed: A LR request is made;
c) No SIM present: The MS enters the update state \"Idle, No IMSI\".
In case b) above, and subsequently whenever a LR request is made, the MS
enters a state depending on the outcome of the LR request, as listed in clause
4.3.3 above. In case c) the GPRS and the non-GPRS update state enters \"Idle,
No IMSI\".
Whenever the MS goes to connected mode and then returns to idle mode again,
the MS selects the appropriate state.
A multi mode MS that also supports 3GPP2 access technology may fall back to
3GPP2 mode if no SIM is inserted.
### 4.5.2 Initiation of Location Registration
An LR request indicating Normal Updating is made when, in idle mode,
\- the MS changes cell while the update status is \"NOT UPDATED\"; (for MS
capable of GPRS and non-GPRS services when at least one of both update
statuses is \"NOT UPDATED\")
\- the MS detects that it has entered a new registration area, i.e., when the
received registration area identity differs from the one stored in the MS, and
the LAI, TAI or PLMN identity is not contained in any of the lists of
\"forbidden location areas for roaming\", \"forbidden tracking areas for
roaming\", \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", \"forbidden location
areas for regional provision of service\", \"forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service\", \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\", \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" or \"forbidden
PLMNs\" respectively, while being in one of the following update statuses:
\- UPDATED;
\- NOT UPDATED;
\- ROAMING NOT ALLOWED.
\- the MS detects that it has entered a new registration area, i.e., when the
received registration area identity differs from the one stored in the MS, and
the MS is attached for access to RLOS;
\- the MS detects that it has entered a registration area that has the same
identity as the one stored in the MS, while the update status is \"ROAMING NOT
ALLOWED\", and
the LAI, TAI or PLMN identity is not contained in any of the lists of
\"forbidden location areas for roaming\", \"forbidden tracking areas for
roaming\", \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", \"forbidden location
areas for regional provision of service\", \"forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service\", \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service\", \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" or \"forbidden
PLMNs\" respectively; and
\- if the selected cell is a satellite NG-RAN cell or a satellite E-UTRAN
cell, it does not fulfil the conditions related to the list of \"PLMNs not
allowed to operate at the present UE location\" as defined in clause 3.1, i.e.
it is considered as candidate for PLMN selection.
\- the periodic location updating timer expires while the non-GPRS update
status is \"NOT UPDATED\" (triggers location updating);
\- the periodic routing area update timer expires while the GPRS update status
is \"NOT UPDATED\" (triggers routing area update);
\- the periodic tracking area update timer expires while the EPS update status
is \"NOT UPDATED\" (triggers tracking area update);
\- the periodic registration update timer expires while the 5GS update status
is \"NOT UPDATED\" (triggers mobility and periodic registration update
procedure);
\- a manual network reselection has been performed, an acceptable cell of the
selected PLMN or the selected SNPN is present, and the MS is not in the update
status \"UPDATED\" on the selected PLMN or the selected SNPN; or
\- emergency bearer services over packet services are requested by upper
layers.
An MS which is attached for PS services other than RLOS and enters a new PLMN
shall perform a routing area update or a tracking area update or an MS which
is registered via NG-RAN and enters a new PLMN or SNPN shall perform a
registration update if the following conditions are fulfilled:
a) if the MS:
1) does not operate in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access, is in S1
mode or N1 mode and the currently stored TAI list does not contain the TAI of
the current serving cell; or
2) operates in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access;
b) the LAI, TAI or PLMN identity of the current serving cell is not contained
in any of the lists \"forbidden location areas for roaming\", \"forbidden
tracking areas for roaming\", \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\",
\"forbidden location areas for regional provision of service\", \"forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service\", \"5GS forbidden tracking
areas for regional provision of service\", \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS
service\" or \"forbidden PLMNs\", or the MS has a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services, or the MS has a PDU session for emergency services;
b1) if the selected cell is a satellite NG-RAN cell or a satellite E-UTRAN
cell, it does not fulfil the conditions related to the list of \"PLMNs not
allowed to operate at the present UE location\" as defined in clause 3.1, i.e.
it is considered as candidate for PLMN selection; and
c) the current update state is different from \"Idle, No IMSI\"; and
1) the MS is configured to perform the attach procedure with IMSI at PLMN
change (see \"AttachWithIMSI\" leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS
24.368 [50] or USIM file NAS~CONFIG~ in 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) and the new PLMN
is the registered PLMN or an equivalent PLMN; or
2) the MS is not configured to perform the attach procedure with IMSI at PLMN
change.
An MS which is attached for access to RLOS and enters a new PLMN shall perform
tracking area update if the following condition is fulfilled:
\- the currently stored TAI list does not contain the TAI of the current
serving cell.
If the new PLMN the MS has entered is neither the registered PLMN nor an
equivalent PLMN, an MS which is attached for PS services and configured to
perform the attach procedure with IMSI at PLMN change (see \"AttachWithIMSI\"
leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [50] or USIM file NASCONFIG
in 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) shall perform an attach procedure using IMSI as mobile
identity.
An LR request indicating periodic location updating is made when, in idle
mode, the periodic location updating timer expires while the non-GPRS update
status is \"UPDATED\".
An LR request indicating periodic routing area update is made when the
periodic routing area update timer expires while the GPRS update status is
\"UPDATED\", except when the MS is attached for emergency bearer services.
An LR request indicating periodic tracking area update is made when the
periodic tracking area update timer expires while the EPS update status is
\"UPDATED\", except when the MS is attached for emergency bearer services.
An LR request indicating Periodic Registration Updating is made when the
periodic registration timer expires while the 5GS update status is
\"UPDATED\", except when the MS is registered for emergency services.
An LR request indicating IMSI attach is made when the MS is activated in the
same location area in which it was deactivated while the non-GPRS update
status is \"UPDATED\", and the system information indicates that IMSI
attach/detach shall be used.
A GPRS attach is made by a GPRS MS when activated and capable of services
which require registration. A GPRS attach may only be performed if the
selected PLMN is not contained in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS
service\". Depending on system information about GPRS network operation mode
MSs operating in MS operation mode A or B perform combined or non-combined
location registration procedures. When the combined routing area update or
GPRS attach is accepted with indication \"MSC not reachable\" or is not
answered the MS performs also the corresponding location updating procedure or
falls back to a GPRS only MS. When the combined routing area update or GPRS
attach is rejected with cause \"GPRS not allowed\" the GPRS update status is
\"ROAMING NOT ALLOWED\" and the MS performs the corresponding location
updating procedure.
An LR request indicating Disaster Roaming registration updating is made when
the MS supporting MINT needs to register to the PLMN offering disaster roaming
services for the first time.
Furthermore, an LR request indicating normal location updating is also made
when the response to an outgoing request shows that the MS is unknown in the
VLR or SGSN, respectively.
Table 2 in clause 5 summarizes the events in each state that trigger a new LR
request. The actions that may be taken while being in the various states are
also outlined in table 2.
A GPRS MS which is both IMSI attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services and which
is capable of simultaneous operation of GPRS and non-GPRS services shall
perform routing area update in connected mode when it has entered a new
routing area which is not part of a LA contained in the list of \"forbidden
location areas for roaming\" or \"forbidden location areas for regional
provision of service\".
### 4.5.3 Periodic Location Registration
A Periodic Location Updating timer (for non-GPRS operation), a Periodic
Routing Area Update timer (for GPRS operation), a Periodic Tracking Area
Update timer (for EPS operation) and a Periodic Registration Update timer (for
5GS operation) with the following characteristics shall be implemented in the
MS (MS shall implement all timers corresponding to supported operations):
i) Upon switch on of the MS or when the system information indicates that
periodic location registration shall be applied, and the timer is not running,
the timer shall be loaded with a random value between 0 and the broadcast or
signalled time‑out value and started.
ii) The time‑out value for the periodic location updating timer shall be
within the range of 1 deci‑hour to 255 deci‑hours with a granularity of 1
deci‑hour.
iii) When the timer reaches its expiry value, it shall be initiated with
respect to the relevant time‑out value, and the MS shall initiate the periodic
location registration corresponding to the expired timer. If the MS is
attached for emergency bearer services or the MS is registered for emergency
services, the MS shall locally detach instead of performing periodic location
registration.
iv) The periodic location updating timer shall be prevented from triggering
periodic location updating during connected mode. When the MS returns to idle
mode, the periodic location updating timer shall be initiated with respect to
the broadcast time‑out value, then started. Thereafter, the procedure in iii)
shall be followed.
v) The periodic routing area update timer shall be prevented from triggering
the periodic routing area update during Ready state. At transition from Ready
to Standby state the periodic routing area update timer shall be initiated
with respect to its time‑out value, then started. Thereafter, the procedure in
iii) shall be followed.
vi) If the MS performs a successful combined routing area update the periodic
location updating timer shall be prevented from triggering the periodic
location updating until the MS starts using location updating procedure, for
example because of a changed network operation mode or the MS uses non-GPRS
services only.
vii) When a change in the time‑out value occurs (at a change of serving cell
or a change in the broadcast time‑out value or a change in the signalled time-
out value), the related timer shall be reloaded so that the new time to expiry
will be: \"old time to expiry\" modulo \"new time‑out value\".
viii) The periodic tracking area update timer shall be prevented from
triggering periodic tracking Area updating during connected mode. When the MS
returns to idle mode, the periodic tracking area update timer shall be
initiated with respect to the signalled time‑out value, then started.
Thereafter, the procedure in iii) shall be followed.
ix) The periodic registration update timer shall be prevented from triggering
periodic registration updating during connected mode. If periodic timer is not
running due to Strictly periodic registration feature, when the MS returns to
idle mode, the periodic registration update timer shall be initiated with
respect to the signalled time‑out value, then started. Thereafter, the
procedure in iii) shall be followed.
### 4.5.4 IMSI attach/detach operation
The system information will contain an indicator indicating whether or not
IMSI attach/detach operation is mandatory to use in the cell. The MS shall
operate in accordance with the received value of the indicator.
A GPRS MS shall perform GPRS attach/detach procedures independent of the value
of the IMSI attach/detach indicator. When a GPRS MS has to perform IMSI
attach/detach independent of GPRS procedures (for example GPRS network
operation mode 2) the handling described in the clause above applies.
When IMSI attach/detach operation applies, an MS shall send the IMSI detach
message to the network when the MS is powered down or the SIM is removed while
the update status is \"UPDATED\". The IMSI detach message will not be
acknowledged by the network.
When the MS returns to the active state, the MS shall perform an LR request
indicating IMSI attach, provided that the MS still is in the same registration
area. If the registration area has changed, an LR request indicating normal
location updating according to clause 4.5.2 shall be performed.
### 4.5.5 No Suitable Cells In Location Area
If during location registration the LR response \"No Suitable Cells In
Location Area\" or \"No Suitable Cells In Tracking Area\" is received:
\- The MS shall attempt to find another LA or TA of the same PLMN, the same
SNPN, an equivalent PLMN or an equivalent SNPN, on which it received the LR
response. If the MS is able to find another LA or TA it shall attempt
registration. If the MS is unable to find an LA or TA, the PLMN Automatic or
Manual Mode Selection Procedure of clause 4.4.3.1 or the SNPN Automatic or
Manual Mode Selection Procedure of clause 4.9.3.1 shall be followed, depending
on whether the MS is in automatic or manual mode and whether the MS operates
in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access.
## 4.6 Service indication (A/Gb mode only)
This is an indication to the user that service or CTS service is available.
The service indication should be set if the following conditions are all
satisfied:
a) Cell Selection: Camped on a suitable cell and in updated state, or in
connected mode having been camped on a suitable cell.
b) Location registration: In updated state, for MSs capable of services
requiring registration.
A specific CTS service indication should be set when the CTS MS is attached to
a CTS FP.
However due to the fact that there may be some transitory changes of state,
the service indication is permitted to continue to be set for up to 10 seconds
after the above conditions cease to be met. Also the service indication is
permitted to take up to 1 second to be set after the above conditions are met.
## 4.7 Pageability of the mobile subscriber
An MS is required to listen to all paging messages that could address it (see
3GPP TS 45.002 [24]), when the following conditions are all satisfied:
\- A SIM is inserted;
\- The MS is camped on a cell;
\- The MS is not in state \"Idle, No IMSI\"; and
\- The MS is not performing the task to search for available PLMNs or
available SNPNs. (Whenever possible during this task, the MS should listen for
paging.). However, when the MS is camped on a cell, is registered in a PLMN
and is performing its regular search for a higher priority PLMN, as specified
in 3GPP TS 22.011 [9], then it shall listen to all paging messages that could
address it.
NOTE: In A/Gb mode, during cell reselection there is a certain period when the
MS is no longer camped on the old cell but must decode the full BCCH, CPBCCH
or EC-BCCH before camping on the new cell. This leads to a period of slightly
more than 8 51 frame multiframes when the MS will not necessarily be pageable
(full BCCH or CPBCCH is decoded) or up to 32 51 frame multiframes when the MS
will not necessarily be pageable (full EC-BCCH is decoded).
## 4.8 MM Restart Procedure
In some cases, e.g. on change of SIM data, there is a need for the MM to be
restarted without the need for user intervention.
To perform the procedure the MS shall behave as if the SIM is removed and
afterwards a new SIM is inserted.
## 4.9 SNPN selection process
### 4.9.1 General
The MS operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access shall perform
the SNPN selection process.
The MS not operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access shall not
perform the SNPN selection process.
There are two SNPN selection modes - automatic SNPN selection mode and manual
SNPN selection mode.
In the SNPN selection process, the MS shall consider only the access networks
of the NG-RAN access technology.
### 4.9.2 Registration on an SNPN
The MS shall perform registration on the SNPN if the MS is capable of services
which require registration. In both automatic SNPN selection mode and manual
SNPN selection mode, the concept of registration on an SNPN is used. An MS
successfully registers on an SNPN if:
a) the MS has found a suitable cell of the SNPN to camp on; and
b) an LR request from the MS has been accepted in the registration area of the
cell on which the MS is camped.
### 4.9.3 SNPN selection
#### 4.9.3.0 General
The ME is configured with a \"list of subscriber data\" containing zero or
more entries. Each entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" consists of:
a) a subscriber identifier in the form of a SUPI with the SUPI format
\"network specific identifier\" containing a network-specific identifier or
with the SUPI format \"IMSI\" containing an IMSI, except when the subscribed
SNPN uses:
1) the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using the
EAP-AKA\'; or
2) the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure;
NOTE 1: A subscriber identifier in the form of a SUPI with the SUPI format
\"network specific identifier\" containing a network-specific identifier or
with the SUPI format \"IMSI\" containing an IMSI, is available in USIM if the
subscribed SNPN uses the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure using the EAP-AKA\' or the 5G AKA based primary authentication and
key agreement procedure.
NOTE 2: If the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a
credentials holder and is configured with the SNPN selection parameters as

holder, the credentials can include an indication to use MSK for derivation of
K~AUSF~ after success of primary authentication and key agreement procedure;
NOTE 3: Credentials are available in USIM if the subscribed SNPN uses the EAP
based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using the EAP-AKA\'
or the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure. If the
MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder,
credentials available in USIM can include an indication to use MSK for
derivation of K~AUSF~ after success of primary authentication and key
agreement procedure.
ba) optionally, a routing indicator, except when the subscribed SNPN uses:
1) the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using the

the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using the
EAP-AKA\' or the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure.
bb) optionally, the protection scheme identifier as specified in 3GPP TS
33.501 [66], except when the subscribed SNPN uses:
1) the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using the
EAP-AKA\'; or
2) the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure;
If the protection scheme identifier is configured in the entry of the \"list
of subscriber data\" and not set to \"null-scheme\", the entry of the \"list
of subscriber data\" also contains the home network public key and the home
network public key identifier as specified in in 3GPP TS 33.501 [66];
NOTE 3B: The protection scheme identifier, the home network public key and the
home network public key identifier are available in USIM if the subscribed
SNPN uses the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure
using the EAP-AKA\' or the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key
agreement procedure.
c) an SNPN identity of the subscribed SNPN;
d) optionally, the unified access control configuration indicating for which
access identities (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) the ME is configured, when the MS
accesses an SNPN using the entry.
Access identity 11 or 15, if configured, is applicable for the MS only in the
subscribed SNPN.
Access identity 12, 13 or 14, if configured, is applicable for the MS only:
1) in the subscribed SNPN; and
2) if the MCC of the SNPN identity of the subscribed SNPN is not the MCC of
value 999, in the non-subscribed SNPNs of the same country as the subscribed
SNPN;
Access identity 1 or 2, if configured, is applicable for the MS only:
1) in the subscribed SNPN;

e) zero or more sets of pre-configured URSP rules (see 3GPP TS 24.526 [77]),
each set for the subscribed SNPN or a non-subscribed SNPN;
f) optionally, the default configured NSSAI (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]);
g) optionally, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a
credentials holder:
1) the SNPN selection parameters, consisting of:
i) a user controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs, where each entry
contains an SNPN identity;
ii) a credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs, where
each entry contains an SNPN identity;
iii) a credentials holder controlled prioritized list of Group IDs for Network
Selection (GINs); and
iv) optionally, if the MS supports access to an SNPN providing access for
localized services in SNPN, the SNPN selection parameters for access for
localized services in SNPN, consisting of:

\- optionally, location assistance information; and
2) optionally, an indication to expect to receive the steering of roaming
information due to initial registration in a non-subscribed SNPN;
NOTE 4: How the ME is configured with the \"list of subscriber data\" is out
of scope of 3GPP in this release of the specification.
NOTE 5: Multiple entries can include the same subscriber identifier and
credentials.
NOTE 6: Handling of more than one entry with the same SNPN identity is left up
to MS implementation.
NOTE 7: Handling of the case when the subscribed SNPN uses the EAP based
primary authentication and key agreement procedure using the EAP-AKA\' or the
5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and the MS has
multiple valid USIMs (3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) is left up to MS implementation.
NOTE 8: To enable UE mobility between SNPNs in 5GMM-IDLE mode, SNPN identities
in the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs are
assumed to be globally-unique SNPN identities.
h) optionally:
1) an indication of whether the MS shall ignore all warning messages received
in the subscribed SNPN or an equivalent SNPN of the subscribed SNPN; and
2) an indication of whether the MS shall ignore all warning messages received
in an non-subscribed SNPN or an equivalent SNPN of the non-subscribed SNPN.
NOTE 9: The ME can be configured with an indication to use anonymous SUCI
associated with an entry of \"list of subscriber data\" when the EAP method
associated with the credentials of the entry supports SUPI privacy at the EAP
layer.
NOTE 10: Anonymous SUCI is not used if the subscribed SNPN of the entry uses
the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using the
EAP-AKA\' or the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement
procedure.
The MS which supports onboarding services in SNPN shall be pre-configured with
default UE credentials for primary authentication and may be pre-configured
with onboarding SNPN selection information. Contents of the onboarding SNPN
selection information are MS implementation specific. Contents of default UE
credentials for primary authentication are out of scope of 3GPP.
Additionally, if the MS has a USIM with a PLMN subscription, the ME may be
configured with the SNPN selection parameters associated with the PLMN
subscription, consisting of:
a) a user controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs, where each entry
contains an SNPN identity;
b) a credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs, where
each entry contains an SNPN identity;
c) a credentials holder controlled prioritized list of GINs;and
d) optionally, if the MS supports access to an SNPN providing access for
localized services in SNPN, with the following SNPN selection parameters for
access for localized services in SNPN associated with the PLMN subscription,
consisting of:
1) a \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for
access for localized services in SNPN\", where each entry contains:
\- an SNPN identity;
\- validity information consisting of time validity information; and
\- optionally, location assistance information; and
2) a \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for
access for localized services in SNPN\", where each entry contains:
\- a GIN;
\- validity information consisting of time validity information; and
\- optionally, location assistance information
and with the following configuration parameters associated with the PLMN
subscription:
a) zero or more sets of pre-configured URSP rules (see 3GPP TS 24.526 [77]),
each set for the HPLMN or a non-subscribed SNPN; and
b) optionally, an indication to expect to receive the steering of roaming
information due to initial registration in a non-subscribed SNPN.
NOTE 11: To enable MS mobility between SNPNs in 5GMM-IDLE mode, SNPN
identities in the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred
SNPNs are assumed to be globally-unique SNPN identities.
NOTE 12: If an MS accesses an SNPN using the PLMN subscription, access
identity 1, 2, 12, 13, or 14 is configured in the USIM of the MS, and the SNPN
is of the same country as the HPLMN, then the configured access identity 1, 2,
12, 13, or 14 is applicable for the MS.
NOTE 13: If an MS accesses an SNPN using the PLMN subscription, an indication
of whether the MS shall ignore all warning messages in an SNPN is configured
in the USIM of the MS.
NOTE 14: Handling of URSP rules is specified in 3GPP TS 24.526 [77].
The time validity information contains one or more time periods.
If at least one time period of the time validity information matches UE\'s
current time, then the validity information is met otherwise the validity
information is not met.
The MS shall maintain a list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" and a list of
\"permanently forbidden SNPNs\" in the ME. Each entry of those lists consists
of an SNPN identity. If the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials
from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, the MS shall maintain one
list of "temporarily forbidden SNPNs" and one list of "permanently forbidden
SNPNs" per entry of the "list of subscriber data". If the MS supports access
to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, the MS shall maintain
one list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" and one list of \"permanently
forbidden SNPNs\" per the PLMN subscription, If the MS supports access to an
SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both,
the MS shall use the lists associated with the selected entry of the \"list of
subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. In addition, if the MS
supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN,
the MS shall maintain one list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs for access for
localized services in SNPN\" and one list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs for
access for localized services in SNPN\" per entry of the \"list of subscriber
data\" and per the PLMN subscription, the MS shall use the lists associated
with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected
PLMN subscription. In addition, if the MS supports onboarding services in
SNPN, a \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\" list for onboarding services and a
\"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" list for onboarding services shall be
maintained.
The MS shall add an SNPN to the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" (for
access for localized services in SNPN, if the SNPN was selected according to
clause 4.9.3.1.1 bullet a0)) (for onboarding services, if the MS is registered
for onboarding services in SNPN or performing initial registration for
onboarding services in SNPN) which is, if the MS supports access to an SNPN
using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both
associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the
selected PLMN subscription, if a message with cause value #74 \"Temporarily
not authorized for this SNPN\" (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) is received by the MS
in response to an LR request from the SNPN. In addition, if:
\- the message is integrity-protected; or
\- the message is not integrity-protected, and the value of the SNPN-specific
attempt counter for that SNPN is equal to the MS implementation specific
maximum value as defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64];
then the MS shall start an MS implementation specific timer not shorter than
60 minutes.
The MS shall remove an SNPN from the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\"
(for access for localized services in SNPN, if the SNPN was selected according
to clause 4.9.3.1.1 bullet a0)) (for onboarding services, if the MS is
registered for onboarding services in SNPN or performing initial registration
for onboarding services in SNPN) which is, if the MS supports access to an
SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both,
associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the
selected PLMN subscription, if:
a) there is a successful LR after a subsequent manual selection of the SNPN;
b) the MS implementation specific timer not shorter than 60 minutes expires;
c) the MS is configured to use timer T3245 and timer T3245 expires;
d) the MS is not configured to use timer T3245, the timer T3247 expires and
the value of the SNPN-specific attempt counter for that SNPN is less than the
MS implementation specific maximum value as defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64];
e) the MS is switched off;
f) an entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the subscribed SNPN
identity identifying the SNPN is updated or the USIM is removed if:
\- EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using EAP-
AKA\'; or
\- 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure;
was performed in the selected SNPN; or
g) the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" is updated or USIM is
removed for the selected PLMN subscription.
If an SNPN is removed from the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" list,
the MS shall stop the MS implementation specific timer not shorter than 60
minutes, if running.
NOTE 15: If the MS supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized
services in SNPN, the UE ensures that such an SNPN is not inaccessible due to
being in the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs for access for localized
services in SNPN\" when the time validity information of the SNPN changes from
not met to met. As a UE implementation option, the MS can remove an SNPN from
the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in
SNPN\" associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\"
or the selected PLMN subscription, when the time validity information of the
SNPN changes from not met to met.
The MS shall add an SNPN to the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\" (for
access for localized services in SNPN, if the SNPN was selected according to
clause 4.9.3.1.1 bullet a0)) (for onboarding services, if the MS is registered
for onboarding services in SNPN or performing initial registration for
onboarding services in SNPN) which is, if the MS supports access to an SNPN
using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both,
associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the
selected PLMN subscription, if a message with cause value #75 \"Permanently
not authorized for this SNPN\", #3 \"Illegal UE\" (applicable in an onboarding
SNPN only), #6 \"Illegal ME\" (applicable in an onboarding SNPN only), or #7
\"5GS services not allowed\" (applicable in an onboarding SNPN only) (see 3GPP
TS 24.501 [64]) is received by the MS in response to an LR request from the
SNPN.
The MS shall remove an SNPN from the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\"
(for access for localized services in SNPN, if the SNPN was selected according
to clause 4.9.3.1.1 bullet a0)) (for onboarding services, if the MS is
registered for onboarding services in SNPN or performing initial registration
for onboarding services in SNPN) which is, if the MS supports access to an
SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both,
associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the
selected PLMN subscription, if:
a) there is a successful LR after a subsequent manual selection of the SNPN;
b) the MS is configured to use timer T3245 and timer T3245 expires;
c) the MS is not configured to use timer T3245, the timer T3247 expires and
the value of the SNPN-specific attempt counter for that SNPN is less than the
MS implementation specific maximum value as defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64];
d) an entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the subscribed SNPN
identity identifying the SNPN is updated or the USIM is removed if:
\- EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using EAP-
AKA\'; or
\- 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure;
was performed in the selected SNPN; or
e) the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" is updated or USIM is
removed for the selected PLMN subscription.
NOTE 16: If the MS supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized
services in SNPN, the UE ensures that such an SNPN is not inaccessible due to
being in the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized
services in SNPN\" when the time validity information of the SNPN changes from
not met to met. As a UE implementation option the MS can remove an SNPN from
the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in
SNPN\" associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\"
or the selected PLMN subscription, when the time validity information of the
SNPN changes from not met to met.
When the MS reselects to a cell in a shared network, and the cell is a
suitable cell for multiple SNPN identities received in the broadcast
information as specified in 3GPP TS 38.331 [65], the AS indicates these
multiple SNPN identities to the NAS according to 3GPP TS 38.304 [61]. The MS
shall select one of these SNPNs. If the registered SNPN is available among
these SNPNs, the MS shall not select a different SNPN.
The MS operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access shall maintain
one or more lists of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", each
associated with an SNPN and, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using
credentials from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, entry of the
\"list of subscriber data\" or, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using
credentials from a credentials holder, the PLMN subscription. The MS shall use
the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" associated with the
selected SNPN and, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from
a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, the selected entry of the
\"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. If the MS
selects a new SNPN, the MS shall keep the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking
areas for roaming\" associated with the previously selected SNPN and, if the
MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder,
equivalent SNPNs or both, the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber
data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. If the number of the lists to be
kept is higher than supported, the MS shall delete the oldest stored list of
\"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\". The MS shall delete all lists of
\"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", when the MS is switched off and
periodically (with period in the range 12 to 24 hours). The MS shall delete
the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" associated with an
SNPN:
a) when the entry with the subscribed SNPN identifying the SNPN in the \"list
of subscriber data\" is updated;
b) when the USIM is removed if:
\- the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using the
EAP-AKA\'; or
\- the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure;
was performed in the selected SNPN; or
c) if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials
holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, when the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking
areas for roaming\" is associated with:
\- the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" and the entry of the \"list of
subscriber data\" is updated; or
\- the PLMN subscription and USIM is removed.
NOTE 17: The number of the lists of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for
roaming\" supported by the MS is MS implementation specific.
If a message with cause value #15 (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) is received by an
MS operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access, the TA is added
to the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" of the selected
SNPN and, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a
credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, the selected entry of the \"list
of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription,. The MS shall then
search for a suitable cell in the same SNPN but belonging to a TA which is not
in the \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" list of the selected SNPN
and, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials
holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, the selected entry of the \"list of
subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription.
The MS should maintain a list of SNPNs for which the N1 mode capability was
disabled due to receipt of a reject from the network with 5GMM cause #27 \"N1
mode not allowed\". When the MS disables its N1 mode capability due to receipt
of a reject from an SNPN with 5GMM cause #27 \"N1 mode not allowed\":
\- the MS should add the SNPN identity of the SNPN which sent a reject with
5GMM cause #27 \"N1 mode not allowed\" to the list of SNPNs for which the N1
mode capability was disabled and should start timer TJ if timer TJ is not
already running. The number of SNPNs for which the N1 mode capability was
disabled that the MS can store is implementation specific, but it shall be at
least one. The value of timer TJ is MS implementation specific;
\- in automatic SNPN selection, the MS shall not select an SNPN for which the
N1 mode capability was disabled as SNPN selection candidates, unless no other
SNPN is available;
\- if the MS is not configured to use timer T3245, the MS maintains a list of
SNPN-specific attempt counters for 3GPP access as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501
[64], and T3247 expires, then the MS removes for each SNPN-specific attempt
counter for 3GPP access that has a value greater than zero and less than the
MS implementation-specific maximum value the respective SNPN from the list of
SNPNs for which the N1 mode capability was disabled, as specified in clause
5.3.20.3 in 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]; and
\- the MS shall delete stored information on SNPNs for which the N1 mode
capability was disabled when the MS is switched off, the USIM is removed, the
entries of the \"list of subscriber data\" for the SNPNs are updated, or timer
TJ expires.
NOTE 18: The expiry of timer TJ does not cause a reset of the SNPN-specific
attempt counters for 3GPP access (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
If the MS does not support access to an SNPN using credentials from a
credentials holder and does not support equivalent SNPNs, the MS should
maintain a list of SNPNs where the N1 mode capability was disabled because IMS
voice was not available and the MS\'s usage setting was \"voice centric\". If
the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder,
equivalent SNPNs or both the MS should maintain one or more lists of SNPNs
where the N1 mode capability was disabled because IMS voice was not available
and the MS\'s usage setting was \"voice centric\", each associated with an
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\". If the MS supports access to an SNPN
using credentials from a credentials holder, the MS should maintain a list of
SNPNs where the N1 mode capability was disabled because IMS voice was not
available and the MS\'s usage setting was \"voice centric\", associated with
the PLMN subscription. If the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials
from a credentials holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, the MS shall use the
lists associated with the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or
the selected PLMN subscription. When the MS disables its N1 mode capability
due to IMS voice not available and the MS\'s usage setting was \"voice
centric\":
\- the MS should add the SNPN identity of the SNPN to the list of SNPNs where
voice service was not possible in N1 mode and should start timer TK if timer
TK is not already running. The number of SNPNs that the MS can store where
voice services is not possible is implementation specific, but it shall be at
least one. The value of timer TK is MS implementation specific;
\- in automatic SNPN selection the MS shall not consider SNPNs where voice
service was not possible in N1 mode as SNPN selection candidates, unless no
other SNPN is available; and
\- the MS shall delete stored information on SNPNs where voice service was not
possible in N1 mode when the MS is switched off, the USIM is removed, the
entries of the \"list of subscriber data\" for the SNPNs are updated, or timer
TK expires.
The MS may support equivalent SNPNs. If the MS supports equivalent SNPNs, the
ME shall store up to one list of equivalent SNPNs:
\- per entry of \"list of subscriber data\"; or
\- per the PLMN subscription, if the MS supports access to an SNPN using
credentials from a credentials holder.
SNPNs in the list of equivalent SNPNs associated with the selected entry of
\"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription shall be
regarded by the MS as equivalent to each other for SNPN selection, cell
selection, and cell re-selection. The list of equivalent SNPNs associated with
the selected entry of \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN
subscription is created, replaced or deleted at the end of each registration
procedure. The stored list consists of a list of equivalent SNPNs as provided
by the network plus the SNPN identity of the registered SNPN that provided the
list. When the MS is switched off, the MS shall keep the stored list(s) so
that they can be used for SNPN selection after switch on. The MS shall delete
the stored list associated with an entry of \"list of subscriber data\" or the
PLMN subscription, when the USIM is removed, the associated entry of \"list of
subscriber data\" is updated, or the MS registered for emergency services
deregisters.
NOTE 19: The MS can provide the list of equivalent SNPNs associated with the
selected entry of \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN
subscription to the lower layers.
NOTE 18: The list of equivalent SNPNs is not provided by the network when the
MS is registering or is registered for onboarding services in SNPN.
#### 4.9.3.1 At switch‑on or recovery from lack of coverage
##### 4.9.3.1.0 General
At switch on, following recovery from lack of coverage, or when the MS starts
operating in the SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access, the MS selects
the registered SNPN or an equivalent SNPN (if it is available) using NG-RAN
access technology and if necessary (in the case of recovery from lack of
coverage, see clause 4.5.2) attempts to perform an LR.
NOTE 1: The MS in automatic SNPN selection mode can end the SNPN search
procedure once the registered SNPN or an equivalent SNPN is found on NG-RAN
access technology.
NOTE 2: An MS in automatic SNPN selection mode can use location information to
determine which SNPNs can be available in its present location.
If successful registration is achieved, the MS indicates the selected SNPN.
If there is no registered SNPN, or registration is not possible due to the
SNPN and all equivalent SNPNs, if any, being unavailable or registration
failure, unless the MS needs to select an SNPN for onboarding services in
SNPN, the MS follows the procedure in clause 4.9.3.1.1 or clause 4.9.3.1.2
depending on its SNPN selection mode. If the MS needs to select an SNPN for
onboarding services in SNPN, the MS follows the procedure in clause 4.9.3.1.3
or clause 4.9.3.1.4 depending on its SNPN selection mode for onboarding
services in SNPN. At switch on, the MS shall use the SNPN selection mode and
the SNPN selection mode for onboarding services in SNPN that were used before
switching off.
NOTE 3: If successful registration is achieved, then the current serving SNPN
becomes the registered SNPN and the MS does not store the previous registered
SNPN for later use.
If registration is not possible on recovery from lack of coverage due to the
registered SNPN and all equivalent SNPNs, if any, being unavailable, an MS
may, optionally, continue looking for the registered SNPN or an equivalent
SNPN for an implementation dependent time.
NOTE 4: An MS registered to an SNPN should behave as described above only if
one or more PDU sessions are currently active.
EXCEPTION: As an alternative option to this, if the MS is in automatic SNPN
selection mode and it finds coverage of a subscribed SNPN (for the selected
entry of \"list of subscriber data\"), the MS may register to that SNPN and
not return to the registered SNPN or equivalent SNPN.
##### 4.9.3.1.1 Automatic SNPN selection mode procedure
If:
\- there is at least one entry in the \"list of subscriber data\"; or
\- there is zero or more entries in the \"list of subscriber data\", the MS
has a USIM with a PLMN subscription and the ME is provisioned with the SNPN
selection parameters associated with the PLMN subscription,
the MS shall select one entry in the \"list of subscriber data\", if any, or
the PLMN subscription, if any, to be used for automatic SNPN selection. How
the MS selects the entry in the \"list of subscriber data\" or the PLMN
subscription is MS implementation specific.
The MS selects an SNPN, if available and allowable, in the following order:
a0) if the MS supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized
services in SNPN and access for localized services in SNPN is enabled, then,
using the SNPN selection parameters for access for localized services in SNPN
in the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or associated with
the selected PLMN subscription:
1) the SNPN previously selected as result of an entry of a list of bullet a0)
2) or a0) 3) with which the UE was last registered, if validity information of
the entry is still met;
2) each SNPN which broadcasts the indication that access using credentials
from a credentials holder is supported and which is identified by an SNPN
identity contained in an entry of the \"credentials holder controlled
prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access for localized services in
SNPN\" (in priority order), if the validity information of the entry is met;
and
3) each SNPN which broadcasts the indication that access using credentials
from a credentials holder is supported and which broadcast a GIN contained in
an entry of the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred
GINs for access for localized services in SNPN\" (in priority order), if the
validity information of the entry is met. If more than one such SNPN broadcast
the same GIN, the order in which the MS attempts registration on those SNPNs
is MS implementation specific;
a) the SNPN with which the UE was last registered or an equivalent SNPN,
except if the registered SNPN was previously selected as result of an entry of
a list of bullet a0) 2) or a0) 3) and validity information of the entry is no
longer met or access for localized services in SNPN is no longer enabled;
b) the SNPN identified by an SNPN identity of the subscribed SNPN in the
selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" in the ME, if any;
c) if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials
holder, using the SNPN selection parameters in the selected entry of the
\"list of subscriber data\" or associated with the selected PLMN subscription:
1) each SNPN which broadcasts the indication that access using credentials
from a credentials holder is supported and which is identified by an SNPN
identity contained in the user controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs
(in priority order);
2) each SNPN which broadcasts the indication that access using credentials
from a credentials holder is supported and which is identified by an SNPN
identity contained in the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of
preferred SNPNs (in priority order);
3) each SNPN which broadcasts the indication that access using credentials
from a credentials holder is supported and which broadcast a GIN contained in
the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of GINs (in priority
order). If more than one such SNPN broadcast the same GIN, the order in which
the MS attempts registration on those SNPNs is MS implementation specific; and
4) each SNPN identified by an SNPN identity which is included neither in the
SNPN selection parameters of the entries of the \"list of subscriber data\"
nor in the SNPN selection parameters associated with the PLMN subscription,
which does not broadcast a GIN which is included in the credentials holder
controlled prioritized list of GINs, and which broadcasts an indication that
the SNPN allows registration attempts from MSs that are not explicitly
configured to select the SNPN. If more than one such SNPN is available, the
order in which the MS attempts registration on those SNPNs is MS
implementation specific.
The MS shall limit its search for the SNPN to the NG-RAN access technology.
Once the MS selects the SNPN, the MS attempts registrations on the selected
SNPN using the NG-RAN access technology, the subscriber identifier and the
credentials from the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or from
the USIM, if the PLMN subscription is selected.
If successful registration is achieved, the MS indicates the selected SNPN.
If registration cannot be achieved because no SNPNs are available, allowable,
and identified by an SNPN identity in an entry of the \"list of subscriber
data\" in the ME, the MS indicates \"no service\" to the user, waits until a
new SNPN is available, allowable, and identified by an SNPN identity in an
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" in the ME and then repeats the
procedure.
If there were one or more SNPNs which were available, allowable, and
identified by an SNPN identity in an entry of the \"list of subscriber data\"
in the ME but an LR failure made registration on those SNPNs unsuccessful, the
MS selects one of those SNPNs again and enters a limited service state.
If an SNPN is being removed from the \"temporarily forbidden PLMNs\" or the
\"permanently forbidden PLMNs\" list (e.g due to MS implementation specific
timer not shorter than 60 minutes expires or timer T3245 expires), and the MS
is in limited service state, and the MS does not have a PDU session for
emergency services, the MS shall perform SNPN selection as described in
subclause 4.9.3.1. If the MS has an established emergency PDU session, then
the UE shall attempt to perform the SNPN selection subsequently after the
emergency PDU session is released.
If:
a) the MS supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services
in SNPN;
b) the access for localized services in SNPN has been enabled;
c) the MS is in limited service state;
d) the MS does not have a PDU session for emergency services; and
e) an SNPN is being removed from the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs for
access for localized services in SNPN\" or \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs for
access for localized services in SNPN\" (e.g due to MS implementation specific
timer not shorter than 60 minutes expires, timer T3245 expires or validity
information of the SNPN becomes valid);
the MS shall perform SNPN selection as described in subclause 4.9.3.1. If the
MS has an established emergency PDU session, then the UE shall attempt to
perform the SNPN selection subsequently after the emergency PDU session is
released.
##### 4.9.3.1.2 Manual SNPN selection mode procedure
The MS indicates to the user any available SNPNs which meet the criteria
specified in bullets a) and b). If the MS does not support access to an SNPN
using credentials from a credentials holder, this includes SNPNs in the list
of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\", and the list of \"temporarily forbidden
SNPNs\". The MS may indicate to the user whether the available SNPNs are
present in the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" or the list of
\"permanently forbidden SNPNs\". If the MS supports access to an SNPN using
credentials from a credentials holder, this includes SNPNs in the lists of
\"permanently forbidden SNPNs\", and the lists of \"temporarily forbidden
SNPNs\" associated with each entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the
PLMN subscription. If the MS supports equivalent SNPNs, this includes SNPNs in
the lists of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\", and the lists of \"temporarily
forbidden SNPNs\" associated with each entry of the \"list of subscriber
data\". The MS may indicate to the user whether the available SNPNs are
present in a list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" or a list of
\"permanently forbidden SNPNs\" for an entry of the \"list of subscriber
data\" or the PLMN subscription. If the MS supports access to an SNPN
providing access for localized services in SNPN, the MS may indicate to the
user whether an available SNPN is identified by an SNPN identity contained in
an entry of one of the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of
preferred SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\" and whether the
validity information of the entry is met, and whether an available SNPN is
broadcasting a GIN contained in an entry of one of the \"credentials holder
controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for access for localized
services in SNPN\" and whether the validity information of the entry is met.
a) SNPNs with the following order:
1) identified by an SNPN identity contained in one of the \"credentials holder
controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access for localized
services in SNPN\" configured in the ME if the validity information of the
entry is met, the MS supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized
services in SNPN. Prioritization between the different lists is MS
implementation specific;
2) broadcast a GIN contained in one of the \"credentials holder controlled
prioritized list of preferred GINs for access for localized services in SNPN\"
configured in the ME if the validity information of the entry is met, the MS
supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN.
Prioritization between the different lists is MS implementation specific. If
more than one SNPN broadcast the same GIN, the order in which those SNPNs are
indicated is MS implementation specific;
3) identified by an SNPN identity contained in one of the \"credentials holder
controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access for localized
services in SNPN\" configured in the ME if the validity information of the
entry is not met, the MS supports access to an SNPN providing access for
localized services in SNPN. Prioritization between the different lists is MS
implementation specific;
4) broadcast a GIN contained in one of the \"credentials holder controlled
prioritized list of preferred GINs for access for localized services in SNPN\"
configured in the ME if the validity information of the entry is not met, the
MS supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN.
Prioritization between the different lists is MS implementation specific. If
more than one SNPN broadcast the same GIN, the order in which those SNPNs are
indicated is MS implementation specific; and
5) identified by an SNPN identity in an entry of the \"list of subscriber
data\" in the ME, if any. The order in which those SNPNs are indicated is MS
implementation specific;
b) if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials
holder, for the SNPNs which broadcast the indication that access using
credentials from a credentials holder is supported:
1) each SNPN which is identified by an SNPN identity contained in one of the
user controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs configured in the ME.
SNPNs included in the same list are indicated in the order in which they are
included in the list. Prioritization between the different lists is MS
implementation specific;
2) each SNPN which is identified by an SNPN identity contained in one of the
credentials holder controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs configured
in the ME. SNPNs included in the same list are indicated in the order in which
they are included in the list. Prioritization between the different lists is
MS implementation specific;
3) each SNPN which broadcasts a GIN contained in one of the credentials holder
controlled prioritized lists of GINs configured in the ME. SNPNs broadcasting
a GIN included in the same list are indicated in the order in which the GIN is
included in the list. Prioritization between the different lists is MS
implementation specific. If more than one SNPN broadcast the same GIN, the
order in which those SNPNs are indicated is MS implementation specific; and
4) each SNPN identified by an SNPN identity which is not indicated in any of
bullets a), b) 1), b) 2) or b) 3). The order in which those SNPNs are
indicated is MS implementation specific.
For each of the SNPNs indicated to the user, the MS shall forward a human-
readable network name along with the SNPN identity to the upper layers if the
system information broadcasted for the SNPN includes the human-readable
network name for the SNPN.
The MS shall limit its search for the SNPN to the NG-RAN access technology.
If the UE has a PDU session for emergency services manual SNPN selection shall
not be performed.
The user may select an SNPN and the MS then initiates registration on this
SNPN using the NG-RAN access technology, the subscriber identifier and the
credentials from the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or from
USIM, if the PLMN subscription is selected, determined as follows:
\- for bullet a) 1) above:
i) the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" which contains the
\"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access
for localized services in SNPN\" that includes the SNPN identity of the

services in SNPN\" that includes the SNPN identity of the selected SNPN is
included in the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" and validity
information of the selected SNPN in the \"credentials holder controlled
prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access for localized services in
SNPN\" that includes the SNPN identity of the selected SNPN is not met; or
ii) the PLMN subscription shall be considered as selected, if the
\"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access
for localized services in SNPN\" associated with the PLMN subscription
includes the SNPN identity of the selected SNPN and validity information of
the selected SNPN in the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of
preferred SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\" that includes the
SNPN identity of the selected SNPN is not met;
\- for bullet a) 4) above:
i) the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" which contains the
\"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for access
for localized services in SNPN\" that includes the GIN broadcast by the
selected SNPN shall be considered as selected, if the \"credentials holder
controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for access for localized
services in SNPN\" that includes the GIN broadcasted by the selected SNPN is
included in the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" and validity
information of the GIN in the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list
of preferred GINs for access for localized services in SNPN\" that includes
the GIN is not met; or
ii) the PLMN subscription shall be considered as selected, if the
\"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for access
for localized services in SNPN\" associated with the PLMN subscription
includes the GIN broadcast by the selected SNPN and validity information of
the GIN in the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred
GINs for access for localized services in SNPN\" that includes the GIN is not
met;
\- for bullet a) 5) above, the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\", with
the SNPN identity matching the selected SNPN (this may take place at any time
during the presentation of SNPNs), shall be considered as selected;
\- for bullet b-1) above:
i) the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" which contains the user
controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs that includes the SNPN
identity of the selected SNPN shall be considered as selected, if the user
controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs that includes the SNPN identity

subscription includes the SNPN identity of the selected SNPN;
\- for bullet b-2) above:
i) the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" which contains the credentials
holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs that includes the SNPN
identity of the selected SNPN shall be considered as selected, if the

holder controlled prioritized list of GINs associated with the PLMN
subscription includes the GIN broadcast by the selected SNPN; and
\- for bullet b-4) above, the entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the
PLMN subscription shall be selected by MS implementation specific means.
NOTE1: If the SNPN identity of the selected SNPN is included in more than one
of the following: one or more user controlled prioritized list(s) of preferred
SNPNs configured in the ME, one or more credentials holder controlled
prioritized list(s) of preferred SNPNs configured in the ME or the list of
SNPNs which are broadcasting a GIN included in one or more credentials holder
controlled prioritized list(s) of GINs configured in the ME, which
subscription is selected is MS implementation specific.
Once the MS has registered on an SNPN selected by the user, the MS shall not
automatically register on a different SNPN unless:
a) the user selects automatic SNPN selection mode;
b) the user initiates an emergency call while the MS is in limited service
state and either the SNPN does not broadcast the indication of support of
emergency calls in limited service state or the registration request for
emergency services is rejected by the network; or
c) the new SNPN is declared as an equivalent SNPN by the registered SNPN.
NOTE 2: If case b) occurs, the MS can provide an indication to the upper
layers that the MS has exited manual network SNPN selection mode.
If the user does not select an SNPN, the selected SNPN shall be the one that
was selected either automatically or manually before the SNPN selection
procedure started. If no such SNPN was selected or that SNPN is no longer
available, then the MS shall attempt to camp on any acceptable cell and enter
the limited service state.
##### 4.9.3.1.3 Automatic SNPN selection mode procedure for onboarding
services in SNPN
When the MS needs to access an SNPN for onboarding services in SNPN, the MS
shall select an SNPN indicating that onboarding is allowed and, if the
onboarding SNPN selection information is pre-configured, also matching the
onboarding SNPN selection information. If more than one such SNPNs are
available, how the MS selects one of those SNPNs is MS implementation
specific. The MS shall not select an SNPN not indicating that onboarding is
allowed or not matching the onboarding SNPN selection information, if pre-
configured, for onboarding services in SNPN.
The MS shall limit its search for the SNPN to the NG-RAN access technology.
Once the MS selects the SNPN, the MS shall attempt initial registration for
onboarding services in SNPN on the selected SNPN using the NG-RAN access
technology and the default UE credentials for primary authentication.
If successful registration is achieved, the MS may indicate to upper layers
the selected SNPN. How this indication is displayed by upper layers is
implementation specific.
If successful registration is not achieved and one or more other SNPNs
indicating that onboarding is allowed and matching the onboarding SNPN
selection information, if pre-configured, are available, the MS can select
such other SNPN and attempt initial registration for onboarding services in
SNPN on the selected SNPN using the NG-RAN access technology and the default
UE credentials for primary authentication, or the MS can perform SNPN
selection not for onboarding services in SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3.1.1
or clause 4.9.3.1.2 depending on its SNPN selection mode.
If:
\- registration cannot be achieved because no SNPNs indicating that onboarding
is allowed and matching the onboarding SNPN selection information, if pre-
configured, are available; or
\- there were one or more SNPNs indicating that onboarding is allowed and
matching the onboarding SNPN selection information, if pre-configured, but an
LR failure made registration on all those SNPNs unsuccessful;
the MS can indicate no onboarding services to upper layers, enter limited
service state and wait until a new SNPN indicating that onboarding is allowed
and matching the onboarding SNPN selection information, if pre-configured, is
available and then repeat the procedure, or the MS can perform SNPN selection
not for onboarding services in SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3.1.1 or clause
4.9.3.1.2 depending on its SNPN selection mode.
##### 4.9.3.1.4 Manual SNPN selection mode procedure for onboarding services
in SNPN
The MS shall indicate to upper layers one or more SNPNs, which are available
and indicate that onboarding is allowed.
These include SNPNs in the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\" for
onboarding services and the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" for
onboarding services. The MS may indicate to the user whether the available
SNPNs are present in the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" or the list
of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\".
The MS shall limit its search for the SNPN to the NG-RAN access technology.
For each SNPN indicated to upper layers, the MS shall indicate to the upper
layers along with the SNPN identity:
a) whether the SNPN matches the onboarding SNPN selection information, if pre-
configured; and
b) the human-readable network name, if the system information broadcast
includes the human-readable network name for the SNPN.
Once the user selects the SNPN for onboarding services, the MS shall attempt
initial registration for onboarding services in SNPN on the selected SNPN
using the default UE credentials for primary authentication.
##### 4.9.3.1.5 SNPN selection when access for localized services in SNPN is
changed or when validity information of an SNPN changes between not met and
met
If the MS supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services
in SNPN, the UE is in automatic SNPN selection mode, and:
a)- access for localized services in SNPN is changed between disabled and
enabled; or
b)- access for localized services in SNPN is enabled and:
1) the selected SNPN was selected according to clause 4.9.3.1.1 bullet a0) and
the validity information for the selected SNPN is no longer met; or
2) the selected SNPN was not selected according to clause 4.9.3.1.1 bullet a0)
and the validity information for an entry in the \"credentials holder
controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access for localized
services in SNPN\" or \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of
preferred GINs for access for localized services in SNPN\" changes from not
met to met;
then:
\- if the MS does not have an emergency PDU session and is not registered for
emergency services, the MS may perform SNPN selection according to clause
4.9.3.1.1; or
\- otherwise, if the validity information for the selected SNPN is no longer
met the MS shall perform a local release of all PDU sessions except for the
emergency PDU session. The MS may perform SNPN selection according to clause
4.9.3.1.1 after the emergency PDU session is released.
#### 4.9.3.2 User reselection
##### 4.9.3.2.0 General
At any time the user may request the MS to initiate reselection and
registration onto an available SNPN, according to the following procedures,
dependent upon the SNPN selection mode of the UE.
##### 4.9.3.2.1 Automatic SNPN selection mode
If:
\- there is at least one entry in the \"list of subscriber data\"; or
\- there is zero or more entries in the \"list of subscriber data\", the MS
has a USIM with a PLMN subscription and the ME is provisioned with the SNPN
selection parameters associated with the PLMN subscription,
the MS shall select one entry in the \"list of subscriber data\", or the PLMN
subscription, if any, to be used for automatic SNPN selection. How the MS
selects the entry in the \"list of subscriber data\" or the PLMN subscription
is MS implementation specific.
The MS selects an SNPNs, if available and allowable, in accordance with the
following order:
a) the SNPN identified by an SNPN identity of the subscribed SNPN in the
selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" in the ME, if any, excluding
the previously selected SNPN;
b) if the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials
holder, using the SNPN selection parameters in the selected entry of the
\"list of subscriber data\" or associated with the selected PLMN subscription:
1) each SNPN which broadcasts the indication that access using credentials
from a credentials holder is supported and which is identified by an SNPN
identity contained in the user controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs
(in priority order), excluding the previously selected SNPN;
2) each SNPN which broadcasts the indication that access using credentials
from a credentials holder is supported and which is identified by an SNPN
identity contained in the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of
preferred SNPNs (in priority order), excluding the previously selected SNPN;
3) each SNPN which broadcasts the indication that access using credentials
from a credentials holder is supported and which broadcast a GIN contained in
the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of GINs (in priority
order), excluding the previously selected SNPN. If more than one such SNPN
broadcast the same GIN, the order in which the MS attempts registration on
those SNPNs is MS implementation specific; and
4) each SNPN identified by an SNPN identity which is included neither in the
SNPN selection parameters of the entries of the \"list of subscriber data\"
nor in the SNPN selection parameters associated with the PLMN subscription and
which broadcasts an indication that the SNPN allows registration attempts from
MSs that are not explicitly configured to select the SNPN, excluding the
previously selected SNPN. If more than one such SNPN is available, the order
in which the MS attempts registration on those SNPNs is MS implementation
specific.
c) the previously selected SNPN.
The MS shall limit its search for the SNPN to the NG-RAN access technology.
The previously selected SNPN is the SNPN which the MS has selected prior to
the start of the user reselection procedure.
The equivalent SNPNs list shall not be applied to the user reselection in
automatic SNPN selection mode.
Once the MS selects an SNPN, if the selected SNPN is other than the previously
selected SNPN, the MS attempts registrations on the selected SNPN using the
NG-RAN access technology, the subscriber identifier and the credentials from
the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or from the USIM, if the
PLMN subscription is selected.
NOTE: If the previously selected SNPN is selected, and registration has not
been attempted on any other SNPNs, then the MS is already registered on the
SNPN, and so registration is not necessary.
##### 4.9.3.2.2 Manual SNPN selection mode procedure
The manual SNPN selection mode procedure of clause 4.9.3.1.2 is followed.
### 4.9.4 Abnormal cases
If:
a) the MS does not support access to an SNPN using credentials from a
credentials holder and:
1) the \"list of subscriber data\" is empty; or
2) for each entry of the \"list of subscriber data\", such that an SNPN with
the SNPN identity of the entry or an equivalent SNPN, is available:
i) there has been an authentication failure for the subscriber identifier of
the entry on the SNPN or an equivalent SNPN; or
ii) the MS has received an \"illegal ME\" or \"illegal UE\" response to an LR
request for the subscriber identifier of entry on the SNPN or an equivalent
SNPN; or
b) the MS supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials
holder and:
1) the \"list of subscriber data\" is empty and:
i) the MS is not provisioned with SNPN selection parameters associated with
the PLMN subscription;
ii) the MS does not have a USIM; or
iii) both of the above;
2) for each entry of the \"list of subscriber data\", such that an SNPN with
the SNPN identity of the subscribed SNPN of the entry or an equivalent SNPN,
is available:
i) there has been an authentication failure for the subscriber identifier of
the entry on the SNPN or an equivalent SNPN; or
ii) the MS has received an \"illegal ME\" or \"illegal UE\" response to an LR
request for the subscriber identifier of entry on the SNPN or an equivalent
SNPN;
and:
i) the MS is not provisioned with SNPN selection parameters associated with
the PLMN subscription;
ii) the MS does not have a USIM; or
iii) both of the above; or
3) for each available SNPN which broadcasts an indication that access using
credentials from a credentials holder is supported and:
i) is identified by an SNPN identity contained in one of the user controlled
prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs configured in the ME;
ii) is identified by an SNPN identity contained in one of:
\- the credentials holder controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs
configured in the ME; or
\- the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for
access for localized services in SNPN\" configured in the ME supporting access
to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN and the access for
localized services in SNPN is enabled and the validity information of the SNPN
is met;
iii) broadcasts a GIN contained in one of:
\- the credentials holder controlled prioritized lists of GINs configured in
the ME; or
\- the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for
access for localized services in SNPN\" configured in the ME supporting access
to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN and the access for
localized services in SNPN is enabled and the validity information of the SNPN
is met;
iv) is identified by an SNPN identity which is included neither in the SNPN
selection parameters of the entries of the \"list of subscriber data\" nor in
the SNPN selection parameters associated with the PLMN subscription, which
does not broadcast a GIN which is included in one of the credentials holder
controlled prioritized lists of GINs configured in the ME and which broadcasts
an indication that the SNPN allows registration attempts from MSs that are not
explicitly configured to select the SNPN;
the following applies:
i) there has been an authentication failure in the SNPN; or
ii) the MS has received an \"illegal ME\" or \"illegal UE\" response to an LR
request from the SNPN;
then effectively there is no selected SNPN (\"No SIM\" state).
In these cases, the states of the cell selection process are such that the
\"list of subscriber data\" (if any) or the PLMN subscription (if any) is not
used. An MS in \"No SIM\" state configured with default UE credentials for
primary authentication may perform SNPN selection procedure for onboarding
services in SNPN. Except when an MS in \"No SIM\" state performs an initial
registration for emergency services to an SNPN or an MS in \"No SIM\" state
configured with default UE credentials for primary authentication performs
registration for onboarding services in SNPN, no further attempts at
registration on any SNPN are made until the MS is switched off and on again,
or an entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" with the SNPN identity of the
SNPN is updated or the USIM is inserted. When performing an initial
registration for emergency services, an SNPN supporting emergency services, of
the current serving cell is temporarily considered as the selected SNPN. If
the MS needs to make an emergency call, the MS supports accessing a PLMN and
there is no available SNPN supporting emergency services, the MS shall stop
operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access and attempt to camp
on a cell of a PLMN so that emergency calls can be made. After an emergency
call is released, the MS may re-start operating in SNPN access operation mode
over 3GPP access and perform SNPN selection.
When in automatic SNPN selection mode and the MS is in the \"not updated\"
state with one or more suitable cells to camp on; then after the maximum
allowed unsuccessful LR requests (controlled by the specific attempt counters)
the MS may continue (or start if it is not running) the user reselection
procedure in clause 4.9.3.2.1.

Figure 1: Overall Idle Mode process
The individual steps are the following (they are not necessarily executed in
the number sequence):
(1) The PLMN selection mode is set (e.g. by the user via the user interface or
by AT command).
(2) The list of available PLMNs is presented to the user, according to the
rules given in clause 4.4.3.1.2.
(3) In manual PLMN selection mode the user selects from the available PLMNs.
(4) If the MS supports CSGs, the list of available PLMNs and CSGs, together
with an indication as to which of the available CSGs is in the Allowed or
Operator CSG list, is presented to the user upon request. The detailed rules
are defined in clause 5.5.4 of 3GPP TS 22.220 [49].
(5) Only for MSs supporting CSGs: when camping on a cell, the available CSGs
(with PLMN information) are conveyed to the CSG selection/restriction
procedure (see clause 3.1A).
(6) Only for MSs supporting CSGs: in manual CSG selection mode the user
selects from the available CSGs.
(7) Only for MSs supporting CSGs: if the selected CSG is associated with the
RPLMN, the MS performs selection of a cell belonging to this CSG.
(8) Only for MSs supporting CSGs: if the selected CSG is associated with a
PLMN different from the RPLMN, the MS enters the PLMN selection process and
performs the parts applicable after manual selection of a PLMN.
(9) After it has selected a PLMN, the MS performs selection of a cell
belonging to this PLMN; this selection is additionally restricted by the
selected CSG, if the PLMN selection was triggered by a manual CSG selection.
(10) After having selected a new cell and the registration area has changed,
the MS shall enter the LR process (see figure 3).
(10a) An MS\'s CM requests may lead to a registration request.
(11) If the LR is not successful, and if the cause received from the network
does not exclude the RPLMN, the MS performs another cell selection (i.e. cell
re-selection) within the RPLMN.
(12) The information on available PLMNs, as detected by the cell selection
process from detectable broadcast information, is made available to the PLMN
selection process.
(13) If the LR is not successful, and if the cause received from the network
excludes the RPLMN, the MS performs PLMN selection.
(14) The positive result of cell selection (suitable cell and in updated
state, or in connected mode having been camped on a suitable cell) and
location registration (updated, for MSs capable of services requiring
registration) is indicated to the user.
Possible sequences of steps are e.g.:
1) 1 2 3 9 10 11 (manual PLMN selection, MS is not CSG capable)
2) 1 9 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 (automatic PLMN selection, MS is CSG capable, manual
CSG selection);
Figure 2a: PLMN Selection State diagram (automatic mode)
Figure 2b: PLMN Selection State diagram (manual mode)
NOTE 1: Whenever the MS goes to connected mode and then returns to idle mode
again the MS selects appropriate state.
NOTE 2: An MS capable of GPRS and non-GPRS services has two Task State
machines one for GPRS and one for non-GPRS operation.

# 6 MS supporting access technologies defined both by 3GPP and 3GPP2
## 6.1 General
An MS that supports access technologies defined both by 3GPP and 3GPP2 (see
3GPP TS 31.102 [40]) shall consider all supported access technologies in all
supported bands when performing PLMN selection.
The goal of the PLMN selection process for such a multi mode MS is to find the
highest priority PLMN and to attempt to register to it.
A multi mode MS shall follow the requirements in the present document for the
PLMN selection procedures across both 3GPP and 3GPP2 access technologies.
Additionally, the MS shall follow the requirements of the present document in
its signalling procedures towards any 3GPP network. If the common PLMN
selection procedure leads to selection of a 3GPP2 network, then the MS shall
follow 3GPP2 specifications **_in meeting any 3GPP2 specific system selection
constraints and_** in all signalling procedures towards the 3GPP2 network.
While registered to VPLMN via 3GPP2 access, the MS shall follow the 3GPP2
specifications for scan of higher priority PLMNs. Additionally to the
requirements specified for 3GPP2 system, a multi mode MS while registered to a
3GPP2 VPLMN shall follow the requirements specified in clause 4.4.3.3.
NOTE: It is assumed that the MS can determine the PLMN identity of networks
supporting 3GPP2 technologies from the information broadcast over the air.
###### ## Annex A (normative): HPLMN Matching Criteria
With the introduction of PCS1900 with the regulatory mandate to allocate
3-digit MNC codes, additional functionality is required to identify the HPLMN.
**Assumptions**
An MNC code shall consist of 2 or 3 decimal digits. In NA PCS1900, all SIMs
shall store 3 digit MNCs.
Any network using a 2 digit MNC code shall broadcast the hexadecimal code
\"F\" in place of the 3^rd^ digit.
For PCS1900 for North America, regulations mandate that a 3-digit MNC shall be
used; however during a transition period, a 2 digit MNC may be broadcast by
the Network and, in this case, the 3^rd^ digit of the SIM is stored as 0 (this
is the 0 suffix rule).
With the exception of North America during the transition period:
a) Within a single country (or area identified by a MCC) all networks shall
broadcast a 2 digit MNC code, or all networks shall broadcast a 3 digit MNC
code. A mixture of broadcast 2 and 3 digit MNC codes is not permitted within a
single country (or area identified by a MCC).
b) A network which broadcasts a 2 digit MNC code, will issue SIMs with a 2
digit MNC code in the IMSI on the SIM. A network which broadcasts a 3 digit
MNC code, will issue SIMs with a 3 digit MNC code in the IMSI on the SIM.
**Definitions and abbreviations**
**BCCH-MCC** For GERAN, the MCC part of the LAI read from System Information
type 3 messages broadcast on the BCCH by the network (see 3GPP TS 44.018
[34]), for UTRA, the MCC part of the PLMN broadcasted as specified in 3GPP TS
25.331 [33], for E-UTRA, the MCC part of the PLMN broadcasted as specified in
3GPP TS 36.331 [42], or for NR, the MCC part of the PLMN broadcasted as
specified in 3GPP TS 38.331 [65].
**BCCH-MNC** For GERAN the MNC part of the LAI read from System Information
type 3 messages broadcast on the BCCH by the network (see 3GPP TS 44.018
[34]), for UTRA, the MNC part of the PLMN broadcasted as specified in 3GPP TS
25.331 [33], for E-UTRA, the MNC part of the PLMN broadcasted as specified in
3GPP TS 36.331 [42], or for NR, the MNC part of the PLMN broadcasted as
specified in 3GPP TS 38.331 [65].
**SIM-MCC** The MCC part of the IMSI or of additional entries in the EHPLMN
list read from the SIM.
**SIM-MNC** The MNC part of the IMSI or of additional entries in the EHPLMN
list read from the SIM.
**HPLMN Matching Criteria in mobiles which don\'t support PCS1900 for NA:**
Figure A.1 illustrates the logic flow described below. The text below is
normative. Figure A.1 is informative.
(1) The MS shall compare using all 3 digits of the SIM-MCC with the BCCH-MCC.
If the values do not match, then the HPLMN match fails.
NOTE: If the MCC codes match, then the number of digits used for the SIM-MNC
must be the same as the number of digits used for the BCCH-MNC.
(2) The MS shall read the 3^rd^ digit of the BCCH-MNC. If the 3^rd^ digit is
Hex F, then proceed to step (4).
(3) The MS shall compare using all 3 digits of the SIM-MNC with the BCCH-MNC.
If the values match, then the HPLMN match succeeds, otherwise the HPLMN match
fails.
(4) The MS shall compare using just the 1^st^ 2 digits the SIM-MNC with the
BCCH-MNC. If the values match, then the HPLMN match succeeds, otherwise the
HPLMN match fails.
If the EHPLMN list is present and is empty or if the EHPLMN list is not
present, the matching procedure shall be done for the MCC/MNC of the IMSI.
If the EHPLMN list is present and is not empty, the matching procedure shall
be done for all entries in the EHPLMN list until a match is found or all
matches fail.

Figure A.1: HPLMN Matching Criteria Logic Flow for mobiles which support GSM
and DCS1800 (informative)
**HPLMN Matching Criteria for mobiles which support PCS1900 for NA:**
Figure A.2 illustrates the logic flow described below. The text below is
normative. Figure A.2 is informative.
(1) The MS shall compare using all 3 digits the SIM-MCC with the BCCH-MCC. If
the values do not match, then the HPLMN match fails.
(2) The MS shall read the 3^rd^ digit of the BCCH-MNC. If the 3^rd^ digit is
Hex F, then proceed to step (4).
(3) The MS shall compare using all 3 digits the SIM-MNC with the BCCH-MNC. If
the values match, then the HPLMN match succeeds, otherwise the HPLMN match
fails.
NOTE: These rules (1) -- (3) are the same as for mobiles which don\'t support
PCS1900 for NA, except step (4) is different.
(4) The MS shall determine if the BCCH-MCC lies in the range 310-316 (i.e.,
whether this network is a PCS1900 for NA network). If the BCCH-MCC lies
outside the range 310-316, then proceed to step (6).
(5) The MS shall compare the 3^rd^ digit of the SIM-MNC with \'0\'. If the
3^rd^ digit is not \'0\' then the HPLMN match fails.
NOTE: This is the \'0\' suffix rule.
(6) The MS shall compare using just the 1^st^ 2 digits of the SIM-MNC with the
BCCH-MNC. If the values match, then the HPLMN match succeeds, otherwise the
HPLMN match fails.
NOTE: When PCS1900 for NA switches over to broadcasting 3 digit MNCs in all
networks, then the additional requirements for PCS1900 for NA can be deleted.
If the EHPLMN list is present and is empty or if the EHPLMN list is not
present, the matching procedure shall be done for the MCC/MNC of the IMSI.
If the EHPLMN list is present and is not empty, the matching procedure shall
be done for all entries in the EHPLMN list until a match is found or all
matches fail.
**Guidance for Networks in PCS1900 for NA**
There may be some problems in the transition period from broadcasting 2 MNC
digits to broadcasting 3 MNC digits. Here are some guidelines to avoid these
problems.
(1) Existing network codes. Operators who currently use a 2 digit BCCH-MNC
**xy** should use the new code **xy0**.
(2) New operators allocated 3 digit MNC codes with the same 1^st^ 2 digits as
an existing operator shall not use a 3^rd^ digit of 0.

PCS1900 for NA (informative)
###### ## Annex B (normative): PLMN matching criteria to be of same country as
VPLMN
While an MS is roaming on a VPLMN, **the VPLMN and a PLMN are of the same
country only if their MCC values identify the same country.** See clause 1.2
for the definition of country.
###### ## Annex C (normative): Control plane solution for steering of roaming
in 5GS
# C.0 Requirements for 5G steering of roaming over the control plane
In addition to the requirements specified in 3GPP TS 22.011 [9] clause
3.2.2.8, 3GPP TS 22.261 [74] clause 6.30 and clause 6.1.2.1, and 3GPP TS
23.501 [62] clause 5.30.2.2, the requirements in this clause apply.
The UE supporting N1 mode shall support the control plane solution for
steering of roaming in 5GS. If the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN supports and wants
to use the control plane solution for steering of roaming in 5GS, then the
HPLMN or subscribed SNPN shall provide the steering of roaming information to
the UE using the control plane mechanism defined in this annex.
The VPLMN shall transparently relay the steering of roaming information
received from the HPLMN to the UE. The UE shall be able to detect whether the
VPLMN removed the steering of roaming information during the initial
registration procedure in the VPLMN. The UE shall be able to detect whether
the VPLMN altered the steering of roaming information. If the UE detects that
the VPLMN altered or removed the steering of roaming information then the UE
shall consider the current VPLMN as the lowest priority PLMN and perform PLMN
selection as defined in this annex.
The non-subscribed SNPN shall transparently relay the steering of roaming
information received from the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN to the UE. The UE shall
be able to detect whether the non-subscribed SNPN removed the steering of
roaming information during the initial registration procedure in the non-
subscribed SNPN. The UE shall be able to detect whether the non-subcribed SNPN
altered the steering of roaming information. If the UE detects that the non-
subscribed SNPN altered or removed the steering of roaming information then
the UE shall consider the current SNPN as the lowest priority SNPN and perform
SNPN selection as defined in this annex.
# C.1 General
## C.1.1 Steering of roaming over the control plane in a PLMN
The purpose of the control plane solution for steering of roaming in 5GS
procedure in a PLMN is to allow the HPLMN to update one or more of the
following via NAS signalling:
a) the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list in
the UE by providing the HPLMN protected list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations or a secured packet;
b) the SOR-CMCI;
c) the SOR-SNPN-SI associated with the selected PLMN subscription in the ME;
d) the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS associated with the selected PLMN subscription in the
ME;
e) the SOR-SENSE (i.e the \"Operator controlled signal threshold per access
technology\") provided in a secured packet; and
f) the slice-based PLMN selection information.
If the selected PLMN is a VPLMN, the HPLMN can provide the steering of roaming
information to the UE using the control plane mechanism during and after
registration. If the selected PLMN is the HPLMN, the HPLMN can provide the
steering of roaming information to the UE using the control plane mechanism
after registration only. The HPLMN updates the \"Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" based on the operator policies, which can be
based on the registered VPLMN, the location of the UE, etc.
The HPLMN may update the \"Operator controlled signal threshold per access
technology\" based on the operator policies and the operator specific data
analytic information.
The HPLMN can configure their subscribed UE\'s USIM to indicate that the UE is
expected to receive the steering of roaming information due to initial
registration in 5GS in a VPLMN. At the same time the HPLMN will mark the UE is
expected to receive the steering of roaming information due to initial
registration in 5GS in a VPLMN, in the subscription information in the UDM. In
this case, it is mandatory for the HPLMN to provide the steering of roaming
information to the UE during initial registration in a VPLMN. Otherwise, if
such configuration is not provided in the USIM, it is optional for the HPLMN
to provide the steering of roaming information to the UE during initial
registration (based on operator policy). The HPLMN can provide the steering of
roaming information to the UE during the registration procedure for mobility
and periodic registration update (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) and initial
registration procedure for emergency services. In addition, the HPLMN can
request the UE to provide an acknowledgement of successful reception of the
steering of roaming information.
NOTE 1: In annex C of this specification, the _User Data Repository (_ UDR) is
considered as part of the UDM.
As the HPLMN needs to consider certain criteria including the number of
customers distributed through multiple VPLMNs in the same country or region,
the list of the preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is not
necessarily the same at all times and for all users. The list of the preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations needs to be dynamically generated, e.g.
generated on demand, by a dedicated steering of roaming application function
(SOR-AF) providing operator specific data analytics solutions.
NOTE 2: The functional description of this dedicated application function
(SOR-AF) is out of scope of 3GPP.
The steering of roaming connected mode control information (SOR-CMCI) enables
the HPLMN to control the timing of a UE in 5GS connected mode to move to idle
mode to perform the steering of roaming. If the UE selects a cell of any
access technology other than NG-RAN, the SOR procedure is terminated (see
clause C.4.2). The UE shall support the SOR-CMCI. The support and use of SOR-
CMCI by the HPLMN is based on the HPLMN\'s operator policy.
The following requirements are applicable for the SOR-CMCI:
\- The HPLMN may configure SOR-CMCI in the UE and may also send SOR-CMCI over
N1 NAS signalling. The SOR-CMCI received over N1 NAS signalling has precedence
over the SOR-CMCI configured in the UE.
NOTE 3: Based on HPLMN policy, while setting the SOR-CMCI the HPLMN can take
into consideration the user preference for the service(s) not to be
interrupted due to SOR (e.g. MMTEL voice call, MMTEL video call, HPLMN defined
services, among others). The user can communicate its preference for the
service(s) not to be interrupted due to SOR to the HPLMN utilizing non-
standard operator-specific mechanisms, e.g. web-based.
\- The UE shall indicate ME\'s support for SOR-CMCI to the HPLMN.
NOTE 4: The HPLMN has the knowledge of the USIM\'s capabilities in supporting
SOR-CMCI.
\- While performing SOR, the UE shall consider the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations or secured packet received in the SOR
information together with the available SOR-CMCI.
\- The HPLMN may provision the SOR-CMCI in the UE over N1 NAS signalling. The
UE shall store the configured SOR-CMCI in the non-volatile memory of the ME or
in the USIM as described in clause C.4.
The following requirement is applicable for the SOR-SNPN-SI:
\- If the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credential\'s
holder, the UE shall indicate ME\'s support for SOR-SNPN-SI to the HPLMN.
The following requirement is applicable for the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS:
\- If the UE supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized
services in SNPN, the UE shall indicate ME\'s support for SOR-SNPN-SI-LS to
the HPLMN.
The slice-based PLMN selection enables the HPLMN to control PLMN
prioritization based on UE subscribed S-NSSAI(s) available via VPLMN(s). The
slice-based PLMN selection information is used for slice-based PLMN selection
(see clause 4.X).
NOTE 5: According to the SLA among operators, the HPLMN will have the
knowledge of the supported NSSAI(s) in the VPLMN(s).
The following requirements are applicable for the slice-based PLMN selection
information:
\- The UDM indicates the UE support of slice-based PLMN selection information
and the UE\'s subscribed S-NSSAI(s) to the SOR-AF.
\- The SOR-AF may create a slice-based PLMN selection information.
\- The HPLMN may provision slice-based PLMN selection information to the UE
using control plane steering of roaming mechanism.
\- The slice-based PLMN selection information carried in the steering of
roaming transparent container is security protected.
\- The UE shall indicate support for slice-based PLMN selection information to
the HPLMN.
Editor's Note: The structure of the slice-based PLMN selection is FFS.
Editor's Note: SA3 to check the security requirements for the slice-based PLMN
information, if any.
Editor's Note: Interworking between slice-based PLMN selection and SOR is FFS.
In order to support various deployment scenarios, the UDM may support at least
one of the following functionalities:
a) obtaining a list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, SOR-
CMCI, if any (if supported by the UDM and required by the HPLMN), slice-based
PLMN selection information, if any, or a secured packet which is available or
becomes available in the UDM (i.e. retrieved from the UDR); or
NOTE 5: A secured packet can be made available at the UDR via implementation
specific means. In this case the implementation specific means are required to
ensure that the secured packet satisfies the \"Replay detection and Sequence
Integrity counter\" (see ETSI TS 102 225 [73]) every time it is sent out from
the HPLMN to the UE.
b) obtaining a list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, SOR-
CMCI, if any (if supported by the UDM and required by the HPLMN), slice-based
PLMN selection information, if any (if supported by the UDM and required by
the HPLMN), or a secured packet from the SOR-AF.
The HPLMN policy for the SOR-AF invocation can be present in the UDM only if
the UDM supports obtaining a list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations, SOR-CMCI, if any, or a secured packet from the SOR-AF.
The UDM discards any list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations,
SOR-CMCI, if any, slice-based PLMN selection information, if any, or any
secured packet obtained from the SOR-AF or which is or becomes available in
the UDM (i.e. retrieved from the UDR), either during registration (as
specified in annex C.2) or after registration (as specified in annex C.3 and
C.4.3), when the UDM cannot successfully forward the SOR information to the
AMF (e.g. in case the UDM receives the response from the SOR-AF with the list
of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the SOR-CMCI, if any, slice-
based PLMN selection information, if any, the secured packet after the
expiration of the operator specific timer, or if there is no AMF registered
for the UE).
The UE maintains a list of \"PLMNs where registration was aborted due to
SOR\". If the UE receives steering of roaming information in the REGISTRATION
ACCEPT or DL NAS TRANSPORT message and the security check to verify that the
steering of roaming information is provided by HPLMN is successful, the UE
shall remove the current selected PLMN from the list of \"PLMNs where
registration was aborted due to SOR\". The UE shall delete the list of \"PLMNs
where registration was aborted due to SOR\" when the MS is switched off or the
USIM is removed. The UE may also remove PLMN(s) from the list of \"PLMNs where
registration was aborted due to SOR\" after a UE implementation dependent
time.
If:
a) the UE\'s USIM is configured to indicate that the UE shall expect to
receive the steering of roaming information during initial registration
procedure but did not receive it or security check on the steering of roaming
information fails;
b) the current chosen VPLMN is not contained in the list of \"PLMNs where
registration was aborted due to SOR\";
c) the current chosen VPLMN is not part of \"User Controlled PLMN Selector
with Access Technology\" list; and
d) the UE is not in manual mode of operation;
then the UE will perform PLMN selection with the current VPLMN considered as
lowest priority.
It is mandatory for the VPLMN to transparently forward to the UE the steering
of roaming information received from HPLMN and to transparently forward to the
HPLMN the acknowledgement of successful reception of the steering of roaming
information received from UE, both while the UE is trying to register onto the
VPLMN as described in clause C.2, and after the UE has registered onto the
VPLMN as described in clause C.3 and C.4.3.
If the last received steering of roaming information contains the list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations then the ME shall not delete the
\"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in
the non-volatile memory of the ME when the UE is switched off.
The \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list shall be
stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME together with the SUPI from the
USIM. The ME shall delete the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access
Technology\" list stored in the ME when a new USIM is inserted.
The procedure in this annex for steering of UE in VPLMN can be initiated by
the network while the UE is trying to register onto the VPLMN as described in
clause C.2, or after the UE has registered onto the HPLMN or the VPLMN as
described in clause C.3, C.7 and C.4.3.
## C.1.2 Steering of roaming over the control plane in an SNPN
The purpose of the control plane solution for steering of roaming in 5GS
procedure in an SNPN is to allow the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN to update one or
more of the following via NAS signalling:
a) the SOR-SNPN-SI associated with the selected entry of \"list of subscriber
data\" or the selected PLMN subscription in the ME, for a UE which supports
access to an SNPN using credentials from a credential holder;
b) the SOR-CMCI; and
c) the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS associated with the selected entry of \"list of
subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription in the ME, if the UE
supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN.
The control plane solution for steering of roaming in 5GS procedure in an SNPN
can also be used by the HPLMN to update the \"Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" list in the UE by providing the HPLMN
protected list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or a secured
packet via NAS signalling.
The HPLMN or subscribed SNPN can provide the steering of roaming information
to the UE using the control plane mechanism during and after registration. The
HPLMN or subscribed SNPN updates the SOR-SNPN-SI based on the HPLMN or
subscribed SNPN policies, which can be based on the registered SNPN, the
location of the UE, etc. The control plane solution for steering of roaming in
5GS procedure in an SNPN is not applicable for credentials holder with AAA
server.
If the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials
holder:
a) the UE shall indicate ME\'s support for SOR-SNPN-SI when registering in a
subscribed SNPN or in the HPLMN; and
b) the UE may indicate ME\'s support for SOR-SNPN-SI when sending an SOR
transparent container including a UE acknowledgement in a PLMN.
When the UE indicates ME\'s support for SOR-SNPN-SI in the 5GMM capability in
initial registration or emergency registration or when ME\'s support for SOR-
SNPN-SI changes in mobility registration update, the AMF shall inform the UDM.
The HPLMN or subscribed SNPN can configure their subscribed UEs\' SNPN
configuration parameters associated with the PLMN subscription or the selected
entry of the \"list of subscriber data\", respectively, to expect to receive
the steering of roaming information due to initial registration in a non-
subscribed SNPN. At the same time the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN will mark the
UE as expecting to receive the steering of roaming information due to initial
registration in a non-subscribed SNPN, in the subscription information in the
UDM. In this case, it is mandatory for the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN to provide
the steering of roaming information to the UE during initial registration in a
non-subscribed SNPN. Otherwise if such configuration is not provided in the
ME, it is optional for the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN to provide the steering of
roaming information to the UE during initial registration (based on HPLMN or
subscribed SNPN policy). The HPLMN or subscribed SNPN can provide the steering
of roaming information to the UE during the registration procedure for
mobility and periodic registration update (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) and
initial registration procedure for emergency services. In addition, the HPLMN
or subscribed SNPN can request the UE to provide an acknowledgement of
successful reception of the steering of roaming information.
NOTE 1: In annex C of this specification, the _User Data Repository (_ UDR) is
considered as part of the UDM.
As the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN needs to consider certain criteria including
the number of customers distributed through multiple SNPNs in the same country
or region, the SOR-SNPN-SI is not necessarily the same at all times and for
all users.
NOTE 2: The functional description of this dedicated application function
(SOR-AF) is out of scope of 3GPP.
The steering of roaming connected mode control information (SOR-CMCI) enables
the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN to control the timing of a UE in connected mode
to move to idle mode, if the UE decides to perform SNPN selection upon
receiving the steering of roaming information. The UE shall support the SOR-
CMCI. The support and use of SOR-CMCI by the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN is based
on the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN policy.
The following requirements are applicable for the SOR-CMCI:
\- The HPLMN or subscribed SNPN may configure SOR-CMCI in the UE and may also
send SOR-CMCI over N1 NAS signalling. The SOR-CMCI received over N1 NAS
signalling has precedence over the SOR-CMCI configured in the UE.
\- The UE shall indicate ME\'s support for SOR-CMCI to the HPLMN or subscribed
SNPN.
NOTE 3: If the credentials holder is the HPLMN, the HPLMN has the knowledge of
the USIM\'s capabilities in supporting SOR-CMCI.
\- While performing SOR, the UE shall consider the SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-
SI-LS (if any) received in the SOR information together with the available
SOR-CMCI.
\- The HPLMN or subscribed SNPN may provision the SOR-CMCI in the UE over N1
NAS signalling. The UE shall store the configured SOR-CMCI in the non-volatile
memory of the ME or in the USIM as described in clause C.4.
The following requirement is applicable for the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS:
\- If the UE supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized
services in SNPN, the UE shall indicate ME\'s support for SOR-SNPN-SI-LS to
the subscribed SNPN or the HPLMN.
In order to support various deployment scenarios, the UDM may support:
\- obtaining the SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any (if supported by the
UDM and required by the HPLMN), which are or becomes available in the UDM
(i.e. retrieved from the UDR);
\- obtaining the SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any (if supported by the
UDM and required by the HPLMN), from the SOR-AF; or
\- both of the above.
The HPLMN or subscribed SNPN policy for the SOR-AF invocation can be present
in the UDM only if the UDM supports obtaining the SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-
LS, if any, from the SOR-AF.
The UDM discards any SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any, obtained from the
SOR-AF or which are or becomes available in the UDM (i.e. retrieved from the
UDR), either during registration (as specified in annex C.5) or after
registration (as specified in annex C.6), when the UDM cannot successfully
forward the SOR information to the AMF (e.g. in case the UDM receives the
response from the SOR-AF with the SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any,
after the expiration of the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN specific timer, or if
there is no AMF registered for the UE).
The UE maintains a list of \"SNPNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\"
per entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the PLMN subscription. If the
UE receives steering of roaming information in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT or DL
NAS TRANSPORT message in an SNPN and the security check to verify that the
steering of roaming information is provided by the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN is
successful, the UE shall remove the current selected SNPN from the list of
\"SNPNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\" for the selected entry of
the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription. The UE
shall delete the list of \"SNPNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\"
when the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" is updated or the
UICC containing the USIM is removed.
If:
\- the UE\'s ME is configured to indicate that the UE shall expect to receive
the steering of roaming information during initial registration procedure for
the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN
subscription but did not receive it or security check on the steering of
roaming information fails;
\- the current chosen non-subscribed SNPN is not contained in the list of
\"SNPNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\" for the selected entry of
the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription;
\- the current chosen non-subscribed SNPN is not part of the user controlled
prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for the selected entry of the \"list of
subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription; and
\- the UE is not in manual mode of operation;
then the UE will perform SNPN selection with the current SNPN considered as
lowest priority.
It is mandatory for the non-subscribed SNPN to transparently forward to the UE
the steering of roaming information received from the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN
and to transparently forward to the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN the
acknowledgement of successful reception of the steering of roaming information
received from the UE, both while the UE is trying to register onto the non-
subscribed SNPN as described in clause C.5, and after the UE has registered
onto the non-subscribed SNPN as described in clause C.6.
The ME shall delete the SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS (if available) stored
in the ME when the subscriber identifier, the SNPN identity of the subscribed
SNPN, or both, of the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" are
updated or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.
The procedure in this annex for steering of UE in an SNPN can be initiated by
the network while the UE is trying to register onto a non-subscribed SNPN as
described in clause C.5, or after the UE has registered onto the subscribed
SNPN or a non-subscribed SNPN as described in clause C.6 and C.8.
# C.2 Stage-2 flow for steering of UE in VPLMN during registration
The stage-2 flow for the case when the UE registers with VPLMN AMF is
described below in figure C.2.1. The selected PLMN is the VPLMN. The AMF is
located in the selected VPLMN.
Figure C.2.1: Procedure for providing list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations and the SOR-CMCI, if any, or secured packet during registration
For the steps below, security protection is described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [66].
1) The UE to the VPLMN AMF: The UE initiates initial registration, emergency
registration or registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration
update (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) to the VPLMN AMF by sending REGISTRATION
REQUEST message with the 5GS registration type IE indicating \"initial
registration\", \"emergency registration\" or \"mobility registration
updating\";
2) Upon receiving REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the VPLMN AMF executes the
registration procedure as defined in clause 4.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]. As
part of the registration procedure:
a) the AMF provides the registration type to the UDM using
Nudm_UECM_Registration. As a consequence, in case of the 5GS registration type
message indicates \"initial registration\" or \"emergency registration\" the
UDM shall delete the stored \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, if any, the
stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, if any, and the stored \"ME
support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if any, in UDR using Nudr_DM_Update
service operation (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]).
NOTE 1: Nudr_DM_Update service operation corresponds to Nudr_DR_Update service
operation (see 3GPP TS 29.504 [82] and 3GPP TS 29.505 [83]).
In addition:
a) if the VPLMN AMF does not have subscription data for the UE, the VPLMN AMF
invokes Nudm_SDM_Get service operation to the HPLMN UDM to get amongst other
information the Access and Mobility Subscription data for the UE (see step 14b
in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]); or
b) if the VPLMN AMF already has subscription data for the UE and:
i) the 5GS registration type IE in the received REGISTRATION REQUEST message
indicates \"initial registration\" and the \"SoR Update Indicator for Initial
Registration\" field in the UE context is set to \'the UDM requests the AMF to
retrieve SoR information when the UE performs NAS registration type \"initial
registration\"\' as specified in table 5.2.2.2.2-1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]); or
ii) the 5GS registration type IE in the received REGISTRATION REQUEST message
indicates \"emergency registration\" and the \"SoR Update Indicator for
Emergency Registration\" field in the UE context is set to \'the UDM requests
the AMF to retrieve SoR information when the UE performs NAS registration type
\"emergency registration\"\' as specified in table 5.2.2.2.2-1 of 3GPP TS
23.502 [63]);
then the VPLMN AMF invokes Nudm_SDM_Get service operation message to the HPLMN
UDM to retrieve the steering of roaming information (see step 14b in clause
4.2.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]);
otherwise the VPLMN AMF sends a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message without the
steering of roaming information to the UE and steps 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4, 5, 6
are skipped;
3a) If the user subscription information indicates to send the steering of
roaming information due to initial registration in a VPLMN, then the HPLMN UDM
shall provide the steering of roaming information to the UE when the UE
performs initial registration in a VPLMN, otherwise the HPLMN UDM may provide
the steering of roaming information to the UE, based on operator policy.
NOTE 2: Based on operator deployment and policy, if the UDM receives the list
of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations from the UDR, and the UDM
supports communication with the SP-AF, the UDM can send this list to the SP-AF
requesting it to provide this information in a secured packet as defined in
3GPP TS 29.544 [71].
If the HPLMN UDM is to provide the steering of roaming information to the UE
when the UE performs the registration in a VPLMN, and the HPLMN policy for the
SOR-AF invocation is absent then steps 3b and 3c are not performed and the
HPLMN UDM obtains the available list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations or the available secured packet (i.e. all retrieved from the
UDR). In addition, if the HPLMN UDM obtains the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations and the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored
for the UE, then the HPLMN UDM shall obtain the SOR-CMCI, if available,
otherwise the HPLMN UDM shall not obtain the SOR-CMCI. If the SOR-CMCI is
provided then the HPLMN UDM may indicate to the UE to store the SOR-CMCI in
the ME by providing the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator set to \"Store SOR-
CMCI in ME\".
NOTE 3: The secured packet obtained by the UDM can include SOR-CMCI only if
the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE and the USIM of
the indicated SUPI supports SOR-CMCI. Otherwise if only the \"ME support of
SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, then SOR-CMCI, if any, cannot be
included in the secured packet.
NOTE 4: The secured packet obtained by the UDM can include SOR-SENSE only if
the USIM of the indicated SUPI supports SOR-SENSE.
If the HPLMN UDM is to provide the steering of roaming information to the UE
when the UE performs the registration in a VPLMN, and the HPLMN policy for the
SOR-AF invocation is present, then the HPLMN UDM obtains the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations, SOR-CMCI, if any, slice-based PLMN
selection information, or the secured packet from the SOR-AF using steps 3b
and 3c;
3b) The HPLMN UDM to the SOR-AF: Nsoraf_SoR_Get request (VPLMN ID, SUPI of the
UE, access type (see3GPP TS 29.550 [88])). The VPLMN ID and the access type
parameters, indicating where the UE is registering, are stored in the HPLMN
UDM;
NOTE 5: Information about UE supporting SOR-SENSE can be available directly in
SOR-AF (or in OAM which configures the secure packet in UDM/UDR).
3c) The SOR-AF to the HPLMN UDM: Nsoraf_SoR_Get response (the list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the SOR-CMCI, if any, and the
\"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, slice-based PLMN selection
information or the secured packet, or neither of them);
Based on the information received in step 3b and any operator specific
criteria, the SOR-AF may either:
\- include the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the SOR-
CMCI, if any, and optionally the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any;
\- include slice-based PLMN selection information;
\- provide the secured packet in the Nsoraf_SoR_Get response; or
\- provide the Nsoraf_SoR_Get response with neither of the information above.
If the SOR-AF includes the list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations and the ME supports the SOR-CMCI, the SOR-AF may provide the SOR-
CMCI and optionally the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, otherwise the SOR-
AF shall provide neither the SOR-CMCI nor \"Store the SOR-CMCI in ME\"
indicator.
NOTE 6: In this version of the specification, when the access type where the
UE is registering indicates 3GPP access, then the UE is registering over the
NG-RAN access technology.
NOTE 7: Based on operator deployment and policy, if the UDM receives the list
of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, and the SOR-CMCI, if any, in
the Nsoraf_SoR_Get response from the SOR-AF, and the UDM supports
communication with SP-AF, it can send this list, and the SOR-CMCI, if any, to
SP-AF requesting it to provide this information in a secured packet as defined
in 3GPP TS 29.544 [71].
NOTE 8: The SOR-AF can include a different list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations, different SOR-CMCI, if any, and different \"Store
SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, or a different secured packet for each
Nsoraf_SoR_Get request even if the same VPLMN ID, the SUPI of the UE, and the
access type are provided to the SOR-AF.
NOTE 9: The SOR-AF can subscribe to the HPLMN UDM to be notified about the
changes of the roaming status of the UE identified by SUPI.
NOTE 10: The SOR-AF can determine that the ME supports the SOR-CMCI if the
Nsoraf_SoR_Info service operation has returned the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\"
indicator.
NOTE 11: Secured packet provided by the SOR-AF can include SOR-CMCI only if
the SOR-AF has determined that the ME supports the SOR-CMCI and the USIM of
the indicated SUPI supports SOR-CMCI. Otherwise if only the \"ME support of
SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, then SOR-CMCI, if any, cannot be
included in the secured packet.
NOTE 12: Secured packets do not include the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\"
indicator.
3d) The HPLMN UDM forms the steering of roaming information as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 [66] from:
\- the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the SOR-CMCI, if
any, and the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, or the secured packet
obtained in step 3a; or
the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations and the SOR-CMCI, if
any, and \"Store the SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, or the secured
packet, obtained in step 3c.
If:
\- neither the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations nor the
secured packet was obtained in steps 3a or 3c; or
\- the SOR-AF has not sent to the HPLMN UDM an Nsoraf_SoR_Get response (step
3c) within an operator defined time after the HPLMN UDM sending to the SOR-AF
an Nsoraf_SoR_Get request (step 3b);
NOTE 13: Stage 3 to define the timer needed for the SOR-AF to respond to the
HPLMN UDM. The max time needs to be defined considering that this procedure is
part of the registration procedure.
and the UE is performing initial registration in a VPLMN and the user
subscription information indicates to send the steering of roaming information
due to initial registration in a VPLMN, then the HPLMN UDM forms the steering
of roaming information as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [66] from the HPLMN
indication that \'no change of the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with
Access Technology\" list stored in the UE is needed and thus no list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is provided\';
If the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator was not obtained in step 3a or 3c
and the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE in the HPLMN
UDM, the HPLMN UDM forms the steering of roaming information with the \"Store
SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator set to \"Do not store SOR-CMCI in ME\";
4) The HPLMN UDM to the VPLMN AMF: The HPLMN UDM sends a response to the
Nudm_SDM_Get service operation to the VPLMN AMF, which includes the steering
of roaming information within the Access and Mobility Subscription data. The
Access and Mobility Subscription data type is defined in clause 5.2.3.3.1 of
3GPP TS 23.502 [63]).
NOTE 14: The UDM cannot provide the SOR-CMCI, if any, to the VPLMN AMF which
does not support receiving SoR transparent container (see 3GPP TS 29.503
[78]).
If the UE is performing initial registration or emergency registration and the
HPLMN UDM supports SOR-CMCI, the HPLMN shall request the UE to acknowledge the
successful security check of the received steering of roaming information, by
providing the indication as part of the steering of roaming information in the
Nudm_SDM_Get response service operation. Otherwise, the HPLMN may request the
UE to acknowledge the successful security check of the received steering of
roaming information, by providing the indication as part of the steering of
roaming information in the Nudm_SDM_Get response service operation;
NOTE 15: If the UE is performing registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) after inter-system
change from S1 mode to N1 mode and the HPLMN UDM supports SOR-CMCI, the HPLMN
requests the UE to acknowledge the successful security check of the received
steering of roaming information, by providing the indication as part of the
steering of roaming information in the Nudm_SDM_Get response service
operation, unless the HPLMN UDM has already received and stored the \"ME
support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator for the UE during its former registration on
the current VPLMN.
5) The VPLMN AMF to the HPLMN UDM: As part of the registration procedure, the
VPLMN AMF also invokes Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation to the HPLMN UDM
to subscribe to notification of changes of the subscription data (e.g.
received in step 4) including notification of updates of the steering of
roaming information included in the Access and Mobility Subscription data (see
step 14c in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]);
6) The VPLMN AMF to the UE: The VPLMN AMF shall transparently send the
received steering of roaming information to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message;
7) If the steering of roaming information is received and the security check
is successful, then:
a) if the UDM has not requested an acknowledgement from the UE, then the UE
shall send the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the serving AMF without
including an SOR transparent container;
b) if the steering of roaming information contains a secured packet (see 3GPP
TS 31.115 [67]):
\- the ME shall upload the secured packet to the USIM using procedures in 3GPP
TS 31.111 [41], if the service \"data download via SMS Point-to-point\" is
allocated and activated in the USIM Service Table (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]);
NOTE 16: How the ME handles UICC responses and failures in communication
between the ME and UICC is implementation specific and out of scope of this
release of the specification.
\- if the UDM has not requested an acknowledgement from the UE and:
A) the ME receives a USAT REFRESH with command qualifier (3GPP TS 31.111 [41])
of type \"Steering of Roaming\" and either a SOR-CMCI is included, or the UE
is configured with the SOR-CMCI, the UE shall perform items a), b) and c) of
the procedure for steering of roaming in clause 4.4.6, and if the UE is in
automatic network selection mode, then it shall apply the actions in clause
C.4.2. In this case steps 8 to 11 are skipped; or
B) the ME receives a USAT REFRESH command qualifier (3GPP TS 31.111 [41]) of
type \"Steering of Roaming\" and neither a SOR-CMCI is included, nor the UE is
configured with the SOR-CMCI, it shall perform items a), b) and c) of the
procedure for steering of roaming in clause 4.4.6 and if:
i) the UE has a list of available and allowable PLMNs in the area and based on
this list or any other implementation specific means the UE determines that
there is a higher priority PLMN than the selected VPLMN; or
ii) the UE does not have a list of available and allowable PLMNs in the area
and is unable to determine whether there is a higher priority PLMN than the
selected VPLMN using any other implementation specific means;
and the UE is in automatic network selection mode, then the UE shall either:
i) release the current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and then attempt
to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by
acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired. In this
case, steps 8 to 11 are skipped. The UE shall suspend the transmission of 5GSM
messages until the N1 NAS signalling is released. The UE shall not initiate
the establishment of a new N1 NAS signalling connection, unless for the
purpose of initiating a registration procedure for emergency services or
establishing an emergency PDU session, until the attempts to obtain service on
a higher priority PLMN are completed. If the UE has an established emergency
PDU session (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]), the receipt of the steering of roaming
information shall not trigger the release of the N1 NAS signalling connection.
If camped on a NG-RAN cell, the UE shall release the current N1 NAS signalling
connection locally subsequently after the emergency PDU session is released,
otherwise the UE shall not take any further actions; or
ii) not release the current N1 NAS signalling connection locally (e.g. if the
UE has established PDU session(s)) and skip steps 8 to 10;
c) if the steering of roaming information contains the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations, the ME shall replace the highest priority
entries in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
list stored in the ME with the received list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations, and delete the PLMNs identified by the list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations from the Forbidden PLMN list and
from the Forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service list, if they are present in these
lists. Additionally, if:
i) the UE has a list of available and allowable PLMNs in the area and based on
this list or any other implementation specific means the UE determines that
there is a higher priority PLMN than the selected VPLMN; or
ii) the UE does not have a list of available and allowable PLMNs in the area
and is unable to determine whether there is a higher priority PLMN than the
selected VPLMN using any other implementation specific means;
and the UE is in automatic network selection mode:
A) if the UE is configured with the SOR-CMCI or received the SOR-CMCI over N1
NAS signalling, the UE shall apply the actions in clause C.4.2. In this case
steps 8 to 11 are skipped;
B) otherwise, the UE shall:
i) release the current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and then attempt
to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by
acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired. In this
case, steps 8 to 11 are skipped. The UE shall suspend the transmission of 5GSM
messages until the N1 NAS signalling is released. The UE shall not initiate
the establishment of a new N1 NAS signalling connection, unless for the
purpose of initiating a registration procedure for emergency services or
establishing an emergency PDU session, until the attempts to obtain service on
a higher priority PLMN are completed. If the UE has an established emergency
PDU session (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]), the receipt of the steering of roaming
information shall not trigger the release of the N1 NAS signalling connection.
If camped on a NG-RAN cell, he UE shall release the current N1 NAS signalling
connection locally subsequently after the emergency PDU session is released,
otherwise the UE shall not take any further actions. If the UE needs to
disable the N1 mode capability (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) and there is no
emergency service pending, the UE shall first attempt to obtain service on a
higher priority PLMN as described in this step, and if no higher priority PLMN
can be selected but the last registered PLMN is selected, then the UE shall
disable the N1 mode capability; or
ii) not release the current N1 NAS signalling connection locally (e.g. if the
UE has established PDU session(s)) and skip steps 8 to 10;
NOTE 17: When the UE is in the manual mode of operation or the current chosen
VPLMN is part of the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
list, the UE stays on the VPLMN.
8) If the UE\'s USIM is configured with indication that the UE is to receive
the steering of roaming information due to initial registration in a VPLMN,
but neither the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations nor the
secured packet nor the HPLMN indication that \'no change of the \"Operator
Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the UE is
needed and thus no list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is
provided\' is received in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, when the UE
performs initial registration in a VPLMN or if the steering of roaming
information is received but the security check is not successful, then the UE
shall:
a) if the SOR transparent container is included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message, send the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the serving AMF without
including an SOR transparent container;
b) if the current chosen VPLMN is not contained in the list of \"PLMNs where
registration was aborted due to SOR\", and is not part of \"User Controlled
PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list and the UE is not in manual mode
of operation:
i) if the steering of roaming information is received but the security check
is not successful when the UE performs registration procedure for mobility and
periodic registration update (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) in a VPLMN and the UE
has a stored SOR-CMCI, and there are ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE
shall apply the actions in clause C.4.2. In this case, current PLMN is
considered as lowest priority and steps 9 to 11 are skipped;
ii) otherwise, the UE shall release the current N1 NAS signalling connection
locally and attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified
in clause 4.4.3.3 by acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts has
expired, with an exception that the current PLMN is considered as lowest
priority, and skip steps 9 to 11. The UE shall suspend the transmission of
5GSM messages until the N1 NAS signalling is released. The UE shall not
initiate the establishment of a new N1 NAS signalling connection, unless for
the purpose of initiating a registration procedure for emergency services or
establishing an emergency PDU session, until the attempts to obtain service on
a higher priority PLMN are completed. If the UE has an established emergency
PDU session (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]), if camped on a NG-RAN cell, the UE
shall release the current N1 NAS signalling connection locally after the
release of the emergency PDU session, otherwise the UE shall not take any
further actions. If the UE needs to disable the N1 mode capability (see 3GPP
TS 24.501 [64]) and there is no emergency service pending, the UE shall first
attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as described in this step,
and if no higher priority PLMN can be selected but the last registered PLMN is
selected, then the UE shall disable the N1 mode capability; and
c) if the current chosen VPLMN is not contained in the list of \"PLMNs where
registration was aborted due to SOR\", store the PLMN identity in the list of
\"PLMNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\";
NOTE 18: When the UE is in the manual mode of operation or the current chosen
VPLMN is part of the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
list, the UE stays on the VPLMN.
9) The UE to the VPLMN AMF: If the UDM has requested an acknowledgement from
the UE and the UE verified that the steering of roaming information has been
provided by the HPLMN in step 7, then:
a) the UE sends the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the serving AMF with an
SOR transparent container including the UE acknowledgement;
b) the UE shall set the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator in the header of
the SOR transparent container to \"supported\";
c) if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a credentials
holder, the UE may set the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator in the
header of the SOR transparent container to \"supported\";
c1) if the UE supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized
services in SNPN, the UE shall set the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\"
indicator in the header of the SOR transparent container to \"supported\"; and
d) if:
\- the steering of roaming information contained a secured packet, then when
the UE receives the USAT REFRESH command qualifier of type \"Steering of
Roaming\" and neither a SOR-CMCI is included, nor the UE is configured with
the SOR-CMCI, it performs items a), b) and c) of the procedure for steering of
roaming in clause 4.4.6;
\- the steering of roaming information contained a secured packet, then when
the UE receives a USAT REFRESH with command qualifier (3GPP TS 31.111 [41]) of
type \"Steering of Roaming\" and either a SOR-CMCI is included, or the UE is
configured with the SOR-CMCI, the UE shall perform items a), b) and c) of the
procedure for steering of roaming in clause 4.4.6 and if the UE is in
automatic network selection mode, then it shall apply the actions in clause
C.4.2, and step 11 is skipped;
\- the steering of roaming information contains the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations, the UE is configured with the SOR-CMCI or
received the SOR-CMCI over N1 NAS signalling, and the UE is in automatic
network selection mode, then the UE shall apply the actions in clause C.4.2,
and step 11 is skipped; or
\- the steering of roaming information contains an indication that \'no change
of the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list
stored in the UE is needed and thus no list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations is provided\', then step 11 is skipped;
10) The VPLMN AMF to the HPLMN UDM: If an SOR transparent container is
received in the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message, the AMF uses the Nudm_SDM_Info
service operation to provide the received SOR transparent container to the
UDM. If the HPLMN decided that the UE is to acknowledge the successful
security check of the received steering of roaming information in step 4, the
UDM verifies that the acknowledgement is provided by the UE as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 [66]. If:
\- the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator in the header of the SOR
transparent container is set to \"supported\", then the HPLMN UDM shall store
the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, otherwise the HPLMN UDM shall delete
the stored \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, if any;
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator in the header of the SOR
transparent container is set to \"supported\", then the HPLMN UDM shall store
the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, otherwise the HPLMN UDM shall
delete the stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, if any; and
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator in the header of the SOR
transparent container is set to \"supported\", then the HPLMN UDM shall store
the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, otherwise the HPLMN UDM shall
delete the stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if any.
NOTE 19: The UDM cannot receive the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, the
\"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, or \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\"
indicator from the VPLMN AMF which does not support receiving SoR transparent
container (see 3GPP TS 29.503 [78]).
10a) The HPLMN UDM to the SOR-AF: Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE, successful
delivery, \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, if any, \"ME support of SOR-
SNPN-SI\" indicator, if any, \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if
any). If the HPLMN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is present and the HPLMN
UDM received and verified the UE acknowledgement in step 10, then the HPLMN
UDM informs the SOR-AF about successful delivery of the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations, or of the secured packet to the UE. If:
\- the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, the HPLMN
UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator is stored for the UE, the HPLMN
UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator; and
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator is stored for the UE, the
HPLMN UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator; and
NOTE 20: How the SOR-AF determines that the USIM for the indicated SUPI
supports SOR-CMCI is implementation specific.
11) If the UE has a list of available PLMNs in the area and based on this list
the UE determines that there is a higher priority PLMN than the selected VPLMN
and the UE is in automatic network selection mode, then the UE shall attempt
to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by
acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired after the
release of the N1 NAS signalling connection. If within an implementation
dependent time the N1 NAS signalling connection is not released, then the UE
may locally release the N1 NAS signalling connection except when the UE has an
established emergency PDU session (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]). The UE shall not
initiate the establishment of a new N1 NAS signalling connection, unless for
the purpose of initiating a registration procedure for emergency services or
establishing an emergency PDU session, until the attempts to obtain service on
a higher priority PLMN are completed.
When the UE performs initial registration for emergency services (see 3GPP TS
24.501 [64] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]) while the UE has a valid USIM and the AMF
performs the authentication procedure, then based on HPLMN policy, the SOR
procedure described in this clause may apply.
If:
\- the UE in manual mode of operation encounters scenario mentioned in step 8
above; and
\- upon switching to automatic network selection mode, the UE remembers that
it is still registered on the PLMN where the missing or security check failure
of SOR information was encountered as described in clause 8;
the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain
service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3, by acting as
if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired, with an exception that
the current registered PLMN is considered as lowest priority. The UE shall not
initiate the establishment of a new N1 NAS signalling connection, unless for
the purpose of initiating a registration procedure for emergency services or
establishing an emergency PDU session, until the attempts to obtain service on
a higher priority PLMN are completed. If the UE has an established emergency
PDU session, then the UE shall attempt to perform the PLMN selection
subsequently after the emergency PDU session is released.
NOTE 21: The receipt of the steering of roaming information by itself does not
trigger the release of the emergency PDU session.
NOTE 22: The list of available and allowable PLMNs in the area is
implementation specific.
NOTE 23: If the UE is served by any access technology other than NG-RAN, the
HPLMN can initiate a steering of roaming procedure as specified in clause
4.4.6.
# C.3 Stage-2 flow for steering of UE in HPLMN or VPLMN after registration
The stage-2 flow for the steering of UE in HPLMN or VPLMN after registration
is indicated in figure C.3.1. The selected PLMN can be the HPLMN or a VPLMN.
The AMF is located in the selected PLMN. In this procedure, the SOR-CMCI, if
any, is sent together with the list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations in plain text or is sent within the secured packet.
The procedure is triggered:
\- If the HPLMN UDM supports obtaining a list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations and SOR-CMCI, if any, or a secured packet from the
SOR-AF, the HPLMN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is present in the HPLMN
UDM, and the SOR-AF provides the HPLMN UDM with a new list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations or a secured packet for a UE identified by
SUPI. If the ME supports the SOR-CMCI, the SOR-AF may provide the SOR-CMCI and
optionally provides the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator otherwise the SOR-
AF shall provide neither the SOR-CMCI nor the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\"
indicator.
The secured packet provided by the SOR-AF may include SOR-CMCI only if the
SOR-AF has determined that the ME supports the SOR-CMCI and the USIM of the
indicated SUPI supports SOR-CMCI. Otherwise if only the \"ME support of SOR-
CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, then the SOR-AF shall not include the
SOR-CMCI, if any, in the secured packet; or
NOTE 1: The SOR-AF can determine that the ME supports the SOR-CMCI if the
Nsoraf_SoR_Info service operation has returned the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\"
indicator. How the SOR-AF determines that the USIM for the indicated SUPI
supports SOR-CMCI is implementation specific.
\- When a new list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or a
secured packet becomes available in the HPLMN UDM (i.e. retrieved from the
UDR).
If the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE and the new
list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations becomes available in the
HPLMN UDM (i.e. retrieved from the UDR), the HPLMN UDM shall obtain the SOR-
CMCI and the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if available, otherwise the
HPLMN UDM shall obtain neither the SOR-CMCI nor the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\"
indicator.
NOTE 3: Based on operator deployment and policy, if the UDM receives the list
of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, SOR-CMCI, if any, the
\"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, and the USIM of the indicated SUPI
supports SOR-CMCI from the UDR, and the UDM supports communication with the
SP-AF, the UDM can send this list and SOR-CMCI to the SP-AF requesting it to
provide this information in a secured packet as defined in 3GPP TS 29.544
[71].
NOTE 4: Before providing the HPLMN UDM with a new list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations or a secured packet for a UE identified by
SUPI, the SOR-AF, based on operator policies or criteria, can obtain the user
location information by triggering the unified location service exposure
procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 23.273 [70] clause 6.5, or additionally based
on implementation specific criteria, by requesting the UE location information
from other application function using implementation specific method. This
user location information can then be used in the SOR-AF algorithms.
NOTE 5: The secured packet obtained by the UDM can include SOR-CMCI only if
the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE and the USIM of
the indicated SUPI supports SOR-CMCI. Otherwise if only the \"ME support of
SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, then the SOR-CMCI, if any, cannot
be included in the secured packet.
Figure C.3.1: Procedure for providing list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations and the SOR-CMCI, if any, or secured packet after registration
For the steps below, security protection is described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [66].
1) The SOR-AF to the HPLMN UDM: Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update request is sent
to the HPLMN UDM to trigger the update of the UE with the new list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations, the SOR-CMCI, if any, and the
\"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, or a secured packet for a UE
identified by SUPI.
2) The HPLMN UDM to the AMF: The UDM notifies the changes of the user profile
to the affected AMF by the means of invoking Nudm_SDM_Notification service
operation. The Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation contains the steering
of roaming information that needs to be delivered transparently to the UE over
NAS within the Access and Mobility Subscription data. If the HPLMN decided
that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check of the received
steering of roaming information, the Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation
also contains an indication that the UDM requests an acknowledgement from the
UE as part of the steering of roaming information. If the SOR-CMCI was
obtained, the HPLMN UDM shall include the SOR-CMCI into the steering of
roaming information. If the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator was obtained,
the HPLMN UDM shall include the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator; otherwise,
the HPLMN UDM shall include the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator set to \"Do
not store SOR-CMCI in ME\";
NOTE 6: The UDM cannot provide the SOR-CMCI, if any, to the VPLMN AMF which
does not support receiving SoR transparent container (see 3GPP TS 29.503
[78]).
3) The AMF to the UE: the AMF sends a DL NAS TRANSPORT message to the served
UE. The AMF includes in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message the steering of roaming
information received from the UDM.
4) Upon receiving the steering of roaming information, the UE shall perform a
security check on the steering of roaming information included in the DL NAS
TRANSPORT message to verify that the steering of roaming information is
provided by HPLMN, and:
\- if the security check is successful and:
a) if the steering of roaming information contains a secured packet (see 3GPP
TS 31.115 [67]) and the service \"data download via SMS Point-to-point\" is
allocated and activated in the USIM Service Table (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]),
the ME shall upload the secured packet to the USIM using procedures in 3GPP TS
31.111 [41].
If the UDM has requested an acknowledgement from the UE in the DL NAS
TRANSPORT message and the ME receives UICC responses indicating that the UICC
has received the secured packet successfully, then the UE sends an UL NAS
TRANSPORT message to the serving AMF with an SOR transparent container
including the UE acknowledgement and the UE:
\- shall set the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator in the header of the SOR
transparent container to \"supported\";
\- may set the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator in the header of the
SOR transparent container to \"supported\" if the UE supports access to an
SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder; and
\- shall set the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator in the header of
the SOR transparent container to \"supported\" if the UE supports access to an
SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN; and
NOTE 7: How the ME handles UICC responses that do not indicate that the UICC
has received the secured packet successfully and failures in communication
between the ME and UICC is implementation specific and out of scope of this
release of the specification.
\- when the ME receives a USAT REFRESH command qualifier (see 3GPP TS 31.111
[41]) of type \"Steering of Roaming\" and neither a SOR-CMCI is included, nor
the UE is configured with the SOR-CMCI, it performs the procedure for steering
of roaming in clause 4.4.6 with an exception that if the UE is in automatic
network selection mode, then the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or
5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64])
before attempting to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN (specified in
clause 4.4.6 bullet d); or
\- when the ME receives a USAT REFRESH with command qualifier (see 3GPP TS
31.111 [41]) of type \"Steering of Roaming\" and either a SOR-CMCI is
included, or the UE is configured with the SOR-CMCI, the UE shall perform
items a), b) and c) of the procedure for steering of roaming in clause 4.4.6.
If the UE is in automatic network selection mode it shall apply the actions in
clause C.4.2;
b) if the steering of roaming information contains the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations, the ME shall replace the highest priority
entries in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
list stored in the ME with the received list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations, and delete the PLMNs identified by the list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations from the Forbidden PLMN list and
from the Forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service list, if they are present in these
lists.
If the UDM has requested an acknowledgement from the UE in the DL NAS
TRANSPORT message, the UE sends an UL NAS TRANSPORT message to the serving AMF
with an SOR transparent container including the UE acknowledgement and the UE:
\- shall set the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator to \"supported\"
\- may set the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator in the header of the
SOR transparent container to \"supported\" if the UE supports access to an
SNPN using credentials from a credentials holder; and
\- shall set the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator in the header of
the SOR transparent container to \"supported\" if the UE supports access to an
SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN.
If the UE is in automatic network selection mode and the selected PLMN is a
VPLMN, then:
\- if the UE has a stored SOR-CMCI or received the SOR-CMCI over N1 NAS
signalling, the UE shall apply the actions in clause C.4; or
\- the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with
RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain
service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by acting as
if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired. The UE shall not
initiate the establishment of a new N1 NAS signalling connection, unless for
the purpose of initiating a registration procedure for emergency services or
establishing an emergency PDU session, until the attempts to obtain service on
a higher priority PLMN are completed.
If the selected PLMN is a VPLMN and the UE has an established emergency PDU
session then the UE shall attempt to perform the PLMN selection subsequently
after the emergency PDU session is released, if the UE is in automatic network
selection mode.
If the UDM has not requested an acknowledgement from the UE, then step 5 is
skipped; and
\- if the selected PLMN is a VPLMN, the security check is not successful and
the UE is in automatic network selection mode, then:
\- if the UE has a stored SOR-CMCI, the current PLMN is considered as lowest
priority and the UE shall apply the actions in clause C.4.2; or
\- if there are ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall apply the
actions in clause C.4.2; or
\- the UE shall release the current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and
attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause
4.4.3.3 by acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired.
The UE shall not initiate the establishment of a new N1 NAS signalling
connection, unless for the purpose of initiating a registration procedure for
emergency services or establishing an emergency PDU session, until the
attempts to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN are completed;
\- if the UE does not have a stored SOR-CMCI, then:
\- if there are ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall wait until it
moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see
3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain service on a higher priority
PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by acting as if timer T that controls
periodic attempts has expired, with an exception that the current PLMN is
considered as lowest priority. The UE shall not initiate the establishment of
a new N1 NAS signalling connection, unless for the purpose of initiating a
registration procedure for emergency services or establishing an emergency PDU
session, until the attempts to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN are
completed. If the selected PLMN is a VPLMN and the UE has an established
emergency PDU session, then the UE shall attempt to perform the PLMN selection
after the emergency PDU session is released; or
\- if there are no ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall release the
current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and attempt to obtain service on
a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by acting as if timer T
that controls periodic attempts has expired, with an exception that the
current PLMN is considered as lowest priority. The UE shall not initiate the
establishment of a new N1 NAS signalling connection, unless for the purpose of
initiating a registration procedure for emergency services or establishing an
emergency PDU session, until the attempts to obtain service on a higher
priority PLMN are completed.
Step 5 is skipped;
NOTE 8: When the UE is in the manual mode of operation or the current chosen
VPLMN is part of the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
list, the UE stays on the VPLMN.
5) The AMF to the HPLMN UDM: If the UL NAS TRANSPORT message with an SOR
transparent container is received, the AMF uses the Nudm_SDM_Info service
operation to provide the received SOR transparent container to the UDM. If the
HPLMN decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check of the
received steering of roaming information in step 1, the UDM verifies that the
acknowledgement is provided by the UE. If:
\- the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator in the header of the SOR
transparent container is set to \"supported\", then the HPLMN UDM shall store
the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, otherwise the HPLMN UDM shall delete
the stored \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, if any;
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator in the header of the SOR
transparent container is set to \"supported\", then the HPLMN UDM shall store
the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, otherwise the HPLMN UDM shall
delete the stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, if any; and
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator in the header of the SOR
transparent container is set to \"supported\", then the HPLMN UDM shall store
the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, otherwise the HPLMN UDM shall
delete the stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if any; and
6) The HPLMN UDM to the SOR-AF: Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE, successful
delivery, \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, if any, \"ME support of SOR-
SNPN-SI\" indicator, if any, \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if
any). If the HPLMN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is present and the HPLMN
UDM received and verified the UE acknowledgement in step 5, then the HPLMN UDM
informs the SOR-AF about successful delivery of the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations, SOR-CMCI, if any, or of the secured
packet to the UE. If:
\- the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, the HPLMN
UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator;
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator is stored for the UE, the HPLMN
UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator; and
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator is stored for the UE, the
HPLMN UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator.
If the selected PLMN is a VPLMN and:
\- the UE in manual mode of operation encounters security check failure of SOR
information in DL NAS TRANSPORT message; and
\- upon switching to automatic network selection mode, the UE remembers that
it is still registered on the PLMN where the security check failure of SOR
information was encountered;
the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain
service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3, by acting as
if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired, with an exception that
the current registered PLMN is considered as lowest priority. The UE shall not
initiate the establishment of a new N1 NAS signalling connection, unless for
the purpose of initiating a registration procedure for emergency services or
establishing an emergency PDU session, until the attempts to obtain service on
a higher priority PLMN are completed. If the selected PLMN is a VPLMN and the
UE has an established emergency PDU session, then the UE shall attempt to
perform the PLMN selection after the emergency PDU session is released.
NOTE 9: The receipt of the steering of roaming information by itself does not
trigger the release of the emergency PDU session.
NOTE 10: If the selected PLMN is the HPLMN, regardless of whether the UE is in
automatic network selection mode or manual network selection mode, regardless
of whether the UE has an established emergency PDU session or not, and
regardless of whether the security check is successful or not successful, the
UE is not required to perform the PLMN selection.
# C.4 Enhanced 5G control plane steering of roaming for the UE in connected
mode
## C.4.1 General
The HPLMN or subscribed SNPN, based on operator policy, may provide the UE
with SOR-CMCI to control the timing when the UE enters idle mode and performs
higher priority PLMN/access technology or SNPN selection. This is achieved by
the HPLMN indicating to the UE the criteria for releasing specific PDU
session(s) or services and entering idle mode.
NOTE 1: The released PDU sessions may be re-established by the application
once the UE successfully registers on a higher priority PLMN or SNPN. User
interaction is required for some applications.
The HPLMN or subscribed SNPN may configure the SOR-CMCI in the UE, and may
also provide the SOR-CMCI to the UE over N1 NAS signalling. The SOR-CMCI
received over N1 NAS signalling takes precedence over the SOR-CMCI stored in
the non-volatile memory of the ME or stored in the USIM.
NOTE 2: The SOR-CMCI received over N1 NAS signalling in the steering of
roaming information is either the SOR-CMCI in the USAT REFRESH with command
qualifier of type \"Steering of Roaming\" (see 3GPP TS 31.111 [41]) which is
received in a secured packet, or the SOR-CMCI received in plain text.
If the UE receives SOR information containing the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations or SOR-SNPN-SI without SOR-CMCI, or the ME
receives USAT REFRESH with command qualifier (see 3GPP TS 31.111 [41]) of type
\"Steering of Roaming\" without SOR-CMCI, or the security check of the
received steering of roaming information is not successful as described in
clause C.2, clause C.3 and clause C.4.3, then:
1) if the UE has SOR-CMCI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME, the UE
shall use the SOR-CMCI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME; and
2) if the UE has no SOR-CMCI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME, the
UE shall use the SOR-CMCI stored in the USIM, if any.
The UE shall delete the stored SOR-CMCI, if any, in the non-volatile memory of
the ME and store the received SOR-CMCI in the non-volatile memory of the ME
when:
1) the ME receives SOR-CMCI in the USAT REFRESH with command qualifier (see
3GPP TS 31.111 [41]) of type \"Steering of Roaming\"; or
2) the UE receives the steering of roaming information containing the SOR-CMCI
over N1 NAS signalling and the UE receives the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\"
indicator set to \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\";
The SOR-CMCI shall be stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME together
with the SUPI from the USIM. The ME shall not delete the SOR-CMCI when the UE
is switched off. The ME shall delete the SOR-CMCI when a new USIM is inserted.
The MS shall be able to handle at least:
\- 4 SOR-CMCI rules for PDU session attribute type criterion DNN of the PDU
session;
\- 4 SOR-CMCI rules for PDU session attribute type criterion S-NSSAI STT of
the PDU session or S-NSSAI SST and SD of the PDU session; and
\- 6 SOR-CMCI rules for any of the following types: service type criterion,
SOR security check criterion or match all type criterion.
If the UE receives the steering of roaming information over N1 NAS signalling
containing the SOR-CMCI together with the \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator
set to \"Do no store SOR-CMCI in ME\", the UE shall not overwrite the SOR-CMCI
stored in the ME, if any, with the received SOR-CMCI, and shall apply the
received SOR-CMCI for the procedure triggered by receiving the steering of
roaming information containing that SOR-CMCI. If there is an ongoing SOR
procedure, then the UE shall apply the received SOR-CMCI as described in
clause C.4.2.
SOR-CMCI consists of SOR-CMCI rules. Each SOR-CMCI rule consists of the
following parameters:
i) a criterion of one of the following types:
\- PDU session attribute type criterion;
\- service type criterion;
\- SOR security check criterion; or
\- match all type criterion; and
ii) a value for Tsor-cm timer associated with each criterion presented in i)
indicating the time the UE shall wait before releasing the PDU sessions or the
services and entering idle mode.
SOR-CMCI contains zero, one or more SOR-CMCI rules with PDU session attribute
type criterion, zero, one or more SOR-CMCI rules with service type criterion,
and zero or one SOR-CMCI rule with match all type criterion.
PDU session attribute type criterion consists of one of the following:
a) DNN of the PDU session;
b) S-NSSAI STT of the PDU session; or
c) S-NSSAI SST and SD of the PDU session.
Service type criterion consists of one of the following:
a) IMS registration related signalling;
b) MMTEL voice call;
c) MMTEL video call; or
d) SMS over NAS or SMSoIP.
SOR security check criterion consists of:
a) SOR security check not successful.
Match all type criterion consists of:
a) match all.
When the SOR-CMCI received by the UE over N1 NAS signalling contains no SOR-
CMCI rules, the UE shall stop all running Tsor-cm timers, if any, and act as
if no SOR-CMCI is configured. Additionally:
\- if the SOR-CMCI is received in plain text and it also contains the \"Store
SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator set to \"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\", the UE shall
delete the stored SOR-CMCI in the non-volatile memory of the ME, if any; and
\- if the SOR-CMCI is received in a secured packet, and the USIM provides the
ME with the SOR-CMCI in the USAT REFRESH with command qualifier of type
\"Steering of Roaming\" (see 3GPP TS 31.111 [41]), then the UE shall delete
the stored SOR-CMCI in the non-volatile memory of the ME, if any.
The HPLMN may update the SOR-CMCI in the USIM such that it contains no SOR-
CMCI rules, in which case the UE behaviour described in clause C.4.2 applies.
Also the HPLMN may make the SOR-CMCI file in the USIM unavailable (see 3GPP TS
31.102 [40]).
If there are more than one criterion applicable for a PDU session (e.g., a
criterion for the PDU session and another one for the service) then the Tsor-
cm timer with the highest value shall apply.
If there are more than one criterion applicable to different ongoing PDU
sessions or services leading to multiple applicable Tsor-cm timers, then all
the applicable Tsor-cm timers shall be started. Further handling of such cases
is described in clause C.4.2.
If the value for Tsor-cm timer equals \"infinity\" then the UE shall wait
until the PDU session is released or the service is stopped.
The Tsor-cm timer is applicable only if the UE is in automatic network
selection mode.
Upon switching to the manual network selection mode, the UE shall stop any
Tsor-cm timer, if running. In this case, the UE is not required to enter idle
mode and perform the de-registration procedure.
The UE shall consider the following services as exempted from being forced to
release the related established PDU session, if any, enter idle mode and
perform high priority PLMN/access technology or SNPN selection. These services
are known to the UE by default and the UE shall not follow the SOR-CMCI
criteria even if configured to interrupt such services:
i) emergency services.
The UE configured with high priority access in the selected PLMN or SNPN shall
consider all services and all related established PDU sessions, if any, to be
exempted from being forced to be released to enter idle mode and perform high
priority PLMN/access technology or SNPN selection.
## C.4.2 Applying SOR-CMCI in the UE
During SOR procedure and while applying SOR-CMCI, the UE shall determine the
time to release the PDU session(s) or the services as follows:
\- If the UE encounters SOR security check not successful on the received
steering of roaming information, and:
\- if a matching criterion \"SOR security check not successful\" is included
in the stored SOR-CMCI, then the UE shall:
\- if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the
value included in the SOR-CMCI;
\- stop all other running Tsor-cm timers, if any; and
\- not start any new Tsor-cm timer while Tsor-cm timer associated with \"SOR
security check not successful\" criterion is running;
\- otherwise, the UE shall keep the Tsor-cm timers running, if any, and apply
actions when the timers expire as described in this clause.
\- If one or more SOR-CMCI rules are included in SOR-CMCI, where for each
criterion:
a) DNN of the PDU session:
the UE shall check whether it has a PDU session with a DNN matching to the DNN
included in SOR-CMCI, and if any, the UE shall, if the timer value is not
zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included in the SOR-
CMCI;
b) S-NSSAI SST of the PDU session:
the UE shall check whether it has a PDU session with a S-NSSAI SST matching
the S-NSSAI SST included in SOR-CMCI, and if any, the UE shall, if the timer
value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included
in the SOR-CMCI;
b1) S-NSSAI SST and SD of the PDU session:
the UE shall check whether it has a PDU session with a S-NSSAI SST and SD
matching the S-NSSAI SST and SD included in SOR-CMCI, and if any, the UE
shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with
the value included in the SOR-CMCI;
c) IMS registration related signalling:
the UE shall check whether IMS registration related signalling is ongoing, and
if it is ongoing, the UE shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an
associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI;
d) MMTEL voice call:
the UE shall check whether MMTEL voice call is ongoing, and if it is ongoing,
the UE shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm
timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI;
e) MMTEL video call:
the UE shall check whether MMTEL video call is ongoing, and if it is ongoing,
the UE shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm
timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI;
f) SMS over NAS or SMSoIP:
the UE shall check whether SMS over NAS or SMSoIP services is ongoing, and if
it is ongoing, the UE shall, if the timer value is not zero, start an
associated Tsor-cm timer with the value included in the SOR-CMCI; or
g) match all:
the UE shall check whether there are any PDU sessions or services for which
there is no matching criterion in a) to f) above. If such PDU session or
service exists, then for each of these PDU sessions or services, the UE shall,
if the timer value is not zero, start an associated Tsor-cm timer with the
value included in the SOR-CMCI.
If the SOR-CMCI is available, and:
\- the SOR-CMCI used is in the USIM, contains no SOR-CMCI rule;
\- there are one or more SOR-CMCI rules but there is no criterion matched with
any ongoing PDU session or service; or
\- there are one or more SOR-CMCI rules and there is one or more criteria
matched with an ongoing PDU session or service, but the highest Tsor-cm timer
value associated with the matched criteria is equal to zero;
then there is no Tsor-cm timer started for any PDU session or service.
While one or more Tsor-cm timers are running, the UE shall check the newly
established PDU session or service for a matching criterion in the SOR-CMCI:
\- If a matching criterion is found and the applicable Tsor-cm timer indicated
the value \"infinity\" then the UE shall start the Tsor-cm timer associated to
the newly established PDU session or service with the value set to infinity;
or
\- For all other cases, if a matching criterion is found and the timer value
is not zero then the UE shall start the Tsor-cm timer associated to the newly
established PDU session or service with the value included in the SOR-CMCI,
with the exception that if the value of the Tsor-cm timer included in the SOR-
CMCI exceeds the highest value among the current values of all running Tsor-cm
timers, then the value of the Tsor-cm timer for the newly established PDU
session or service shall be set to the highest value among the current values
of all running Tsor-cm timers.
NOTE 1: For newly established PDU session or service as described above, the
timer is set irrespective of whether other ongoing PDU sessions or services
that match the same criteria exist and for which corresponding Tsor-cm timers
are running.
NOTE 2: NAS 5GMM layer will receive an explicit indication from the upper
layers that a service is started or stopped. When a service is started, it is
handled as a new service in the procedures described in this clause.
NOTE 3: While one or more Tsor-cm timers are running, the UE can trigger any
5GSM procedure or start new services.
While one or more Tsor-cm timers are running, upon receiving a new SOR-CMCI as
described in annex C.4.3, the UE shall check if there is a matching criterion
found for any ongoing PDU session or service in the new SOR-CMCI:
\- if a matching criterion is found and the value of Tsor-cm timer in the new
SOR-CMCI indicates the value \"infinity\", then:
a) if the Tsor-cm timer associated to the PDU session or service is not
running, then the UE shall start the Tsor-cm timer associated to the PDU
session or service with the value set to infinity; or
b) if the Tsor-cm timer associated to the PDU session or service is already
running, then the UE shall set the value of the Tsor-cm timer associated to
the PDU session or service to infinity without stopping and restarting the
timer;
\- if a matching criterion is found and the value of Tsor-cm timer in the new
SOR-CMCI is other than infinity and is smaller than the current value of the
running Tsor-cm timer for the associated PDU session or service, then the
Tsor-cm timer value for the associated PDU session or service shall be
replaced with the value in the new SOR-CMCI without stopping and restarting
the timer; or
\- for all other cases, the running Tsor-cm timers for the associated PDU
sessions or services are kept unchanged.
The Tsor-cm timer shall be stopped when the associated PDU session is released
or the associated service is stopped.
If the security check on the received steering of roaming information is
successful, the UE shall stop the Tsor-cm timer associated with \"SOR security
check not successful\", if running, and act on the received steering of
roaming information. The current PLMN or SNPN is not considered as lowest
priority.
NOTE 4: This also applies to the case when the current PLMN or SNPN is
different from the PLMN or SNPN in which the Tsor-cm timer associated with
\"SOR security check not successful\" was started.
If the UE, while one or more Tsor-cm timers are running:
a) enters idle mode not due to lower layer failure (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]);
b) is not able to successfully recover the N1 NAS signalling connection (see
3GPP TS 24.501 [64]); or
c) enters 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501
[64]);
then the UE shall stop the timer(s). In these cases, if:
a) the UE has a list of available and allowable PLMNs or SNPNs in the area and
based on this list or any other implementation specific means, the UE
determines that there is a higher priority PLMN or SNPN than the selected
VPLMN or non-subscribed SNPN; or
b) the UE does not have a list of available and allowable PLMNs or SNPNs in
the area and is unable to determine whether there is a higher priority PLMN or
SNPN than the selected VPLMN or non-subscribed SNPN using any other
implementation specific means;
then the UE shall attempt to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN or SNPN
as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by acting as if timer T that controls periodic
attempts has expired or as specified in clause 4.9.3.
NOTE 5: When the UE enters idle mode due to lower layer failure while one or
more Tsor-cm timers are running, then the UE does not stop Tsor-cm timer(s) as
recovery of NAS signalling connection is possible (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
When the UE determines that no Tsor-cm timer is started for any PDU session or
service, the last running Tsor-cm timer is stopped due to release of the
associated PDU sessions or stop of the associated services, or the last
running Tsor-cm timer expires, if:
i) the UE has a list of available and allowable PLMNs or SNPNs in the area and
based on this list or any other implementation specific means, the UE
determines that there is a higher priority PLMN or SNPN than the selected
VPLMN or non-subscribed SNPN; or
ii) the UE does not have a list of available and allowable PLMNs or SNPNs in
the area and is unable to determine whether there is a higher priority PLMN or
SNPN than the selected VPLMN or non-subscribed SNPNusing any other
implementation specific means;
then if the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE shall perform the de-
registration procedure (see clause 4.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]) that
releases all the established PDU sessions and services, if any, and once the
UE enters idle mode it shall attempt to obtain service on a higher priority
PLMN or SNPN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by acting as if timer T that
controls periodic attempts has expired or as specified in clause 4.9.3.
NOTE 6: The list of available and allowable PLMNs or SNPNs in the area is
implementation specific.
The UE which has an emergency PDU session, receives a request from the upper
layers to establish an emergency PDU session or perform emergency services
fallback, registers for emergency services, or is configured for high priority
access in the selected PLMN or SNPN is not required to enter idle mode if the
last running Tsor-cm timer for any PDU session or service stops or expires. In
this case, the UE shall attempt to perform the PLMN or SNPN selection after
the emergency PDU session or the high priority service is released and after
the UE enters idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication
(see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
If the UE selects a cell of any access technology other than NG-RAN, the
ongoing SOR procedure is terminated and the UE shall stop applying SOR-CMCI
and stop all running Tsor-cm timers without triggering any further actions.
NOTE 7: If the UE is served by any access technology other than NG-RAN, the
HPLMN can initiate a steering of roaming procedure as specified in clause
4.4.6.
## C.4.3 Stage-2 flow for providing UE with SOR-CMCI in HPLMN, VPLMN,
subscribed SNPN or non-subscribed SNPN after registration
The stage-2 flow for providing UE with SOR-CMCI in HPLMN, VPLMN, subscribed
SNPN or non-subscribed SNPN after registration is indicated in figure C.4.3.1,
when the ME supports the SOR-CMCI. The selected PLMN or SNPN can be the HPLMN,
a VPLMN, the subscribed SNPN or a non-subscribed SNPN. The AMF is located in
the selected PLMN or SNPN. The UDM is located in the HPLMN or the subscribed
SNPN.
In this procedure, the SOR-CMCI is sent without the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations and the SOR-SNPN-SI. In this procedure,
the SOR-CMCI is sent in plain text or is sent within the secured packet.
NOTE 0: When the UE is registered in a non-subscribed SNPN, the SOR-CMCI can
be provided in a secured packet only if the UE is using a PLMN subscription to
access the non-subscribed SNPN.
NOTE 1: The SOR-AF can determine that the ME supports the SOR-CMCI if the
Nsoraf_SoR_Info service operation has returned the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\"
indicator. The UDM can determine that the ME supports the SOR-CMCI if the \"ME
support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE. How the SOR-AF
determines that the USIM for the indicated SUPI supports SOR-CMCI is
implementation specific.
NOTE 2: The secured packet provided by the SOR-AF can include SOR-CMCI only if
the SOR-AF has determined that the ME supports the SOR-CMCI and the USIM of
the indicated SUPI supports SOR-CMCI. Otherwise if only the \"ME support of
SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, then SOR-CMCI, if any, cannot be
included in the secured packet.
The procedure is triggered:
\- If the UDM supports obtaining the parameters of the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations, the SOR-SNPN-SI, the SOR-CMCI, and the
\"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, or a secured packet from the SOR-
AF, the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is present
in the UDM and the SOR-AF provides the UDM with the SOR-CMCI for a UE
identified by SUPI; or
\- When the SOR-CMCI becomes available in the UDM (i.e., retrieved from the
UDR).
Figure C.4.3.1: Procedure for configuring UE with SOR-CMCI after registration
For the steps below, security protection is described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [66].
1) The SOR-AF to the UDM: Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update request is sent to
the UDM to trigger the update of the UE with the SOR-CMCI (in plain text or
secured packet). In case of providing SOR-CMCI in plain text, include the
\"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if applicable. In case of providing SOR-
CMCI in a secured packet, include an indication that \"the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations is not included in the secured packet\".
2) The UDM to the AMF: The UDM notifies the changes of the user profile to the
affected AMF by the means of invoking Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation.
The Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation contains the steering of roaming
information that needs to be delivered transparently to the UE over NAS within
the Access and Mobility Subscription data. If the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN
decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check of the
received steering of roaming information, the Nudm_SDM_Notification service
operation also contains an indication that the UDM requests an acknowledgement
from the UE as part of the steering of roaming information. The UDM:
\- upon receiving the SOR-CMCI (in plain text), shall:
i) if the UE is registered in the HPLMN or a VPLMN, include the SOR-CMCI, the
\"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, and the HPLMN indication that \'no
change of the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
list stored in the UE is needed and thus no list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations is provided\';
ii) if the UE is registered in a non-subcribed SNPN, include the SOR-CMCI, the
\"Store SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, and the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN
indication that \'no change of the SOR-SNPN-SI stored in the UE is needed and
thus no SOR-SNPN-SI is provided\'; and
iii) if the UE is registered in a subcribed SNPN and the AMF has reported to
the UDM that the UE supports SOR-SNPN-SI, include the SOR-CMCI, the \"Store
SOR-CMCI in ME\" indicator, if any, and the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN
indication that \'no change of the SOR-SNPN-SI stored in the UE is needed and
thus no SOR-SNPN-SI is provided\'; or
\- upon receiving the SOR-CMCI in secured packet, shall include the secured
packet into the steering of roaming information;
NOTE 3: The UDM considers \"the list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations is not included in the secured packet\" received together with
the secured packet from the SOR-AF to indicate that the UE is not expected to
perform SOR based on the associated steering of roaming information sent to
the UE. However, the SOR-CMCI included in the secured packet can be applied by
the UE if the UE has one or more Tsor-cm timers running as described in C.4.2.
NOTE 4: The UDM cannot provide the SOR-CMCI, if any, to the AMF which does not
support receiving SoR transparent container (see 3GPP TS 29.503 [78]).
3) The AMF to the UE: the AMF sends a DL NAS TRANSPORT message to the served
UE. The AMF includes in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message the steering of roaming
information received from the UDM.
4) Upon receiving the steering of roaming information containing the SOR-CMCI
and the HPLMN indication that \'no change of the \"Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the UE is needed and thus no
list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations is provided\' or the
HPLMN or subscribed SNPN indication that \'no change of the SOR-SNPN-SI stored
in the UE is needed and thus no SOR-SNPN-SI is provided\', or the secured
packet, the UE shall perform a security check on the steering of roaming
information included in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message to verify that the
steering of roaming information is provided by HPLMN or subscribed SNPN, and:
a) if the security check is successful, the UE shall store the SOR-CMCI
according to clause C.4.1. If the UE has one or more Tsor-cm timers running,
the UE shall apply the received SOR-CMCI as described in C.4.2.
If the steering of roaming information contains a secured packet and the UDM
has requested an acknowledgement from the UE in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message,
the UE sends an UL NAS TRANSPORT message to the serving AMF with an SOR
transparent container including the UE acknowledgement and the UE shall set
the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator to \"supported\" only after the ME
receives UICC responses indicating that the UICC has received the secured
packet successfully. Otherwise, if the UDM has requested an acknowledgement
from the UE in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message, the UE sends an UL NAS TRANSPORT
message to the serving AMF with an SOR transparent container including the UE
acknowledgement and the UE shall set the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator
to \"supported\". Additionally, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using
credentials from a credentials holder and the UE is in a PLMN, the UE may set
the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator to \"supported\".
If the UDM has not requested an acknowledgement from the UE then step 5 is
skipped; and
b) if the selected PLMN is a VPLMN or a non-subscribed SNPN, the security
check is not successful and the UE is in automatic network selection mode,
then:
\- if the UE has a stored SOR-CMCI, the current PLMN is considered as lowest
priority and the UE shall apply the actions in clause C.4.2;
\- otherwise, the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED
mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting
to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by
acting as if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired, with an
exception that the current PLMN is considered as lowest priority, or before
attempting to obtain service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause
4.9.3, with an exception that the current registered SNPN is considered as
lowest priority. If the selected PLMN or SNPN is a VPLMN or a non-subscribed
SNPN and the UE has an established emergency PDU session then the UE shall
attempt to perform the PLMN selection after the emergency PDU session is
released and after the UE enters idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
Step 5 is skipped;
NOTE 5: When the UE is in the manual mode of operation or the current chosen
VPLMN is part of the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
list or the current chosen non-subscribed SNPN is part of the user controlled
prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for the selected entry of the \"list of
subscriber data\" the selected PLMN subscription, the UE stays on the VPLMN or
non-subscribed SNPN.
5) The AMF to the UDM: If the UL NAS TRANSPORT message with an SOR transparent
container is received, the AMF uses the Nudm_SDM_Info service operation to
provide the received SOR transparent container to the UDM. If the HPLMN or
subscribed SNPN decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security
check of the received steering of roaming information in step 2, the UDM
verifies that the acknowledgement is provided by the UE. The UDM shall store
the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator and the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\"
indicator, if any; and
6) The UDM to the SOR-AF: Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE, successful
delivery, \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\"
indicator, if any). If the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN policy for the SOR-AF
invocation is present and the UDM received and verified the UE acknowledgement
in step 5, then the UDM informs the SOR-AF about successful delivery of the
SOR-CMCI to the UE. The UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\"
indicator and the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, if any.
If the selected PLMN is a VPLMN or a non-subscribed SNPN and:
\- the UE in manual mode of operation encounters security check failure of SOR
information in DL NAS TRANSPORT message; and
\- upon switching to automatic network selection mode the UE remembers that it
is still registered on the PLMN the non-subscribed SNPN where the security
check failure of SOR information was encountered;
the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain
service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3, by acting as
if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired, with an exception that
the current registered PLMN is considered as lowest priority, or before
attempting to obtained service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in
clause 4.9.3, with an exception that the current registered SNPN is considered
as lowest priority. If the selected PLMN is a VPLMN or the selected SNPN is a
non-subscribed SNPN and the UE has an established emergency PDU session then
the UE shall attempt to perform the PLMN selection after the emergency PDU
session is released and after the UE enters idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode
with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
NOTE 6: The receipt of the steering of roaming information by itself does not
trigger the release of the emergency PDU session.
# C.5 Stage-2 flow for steering of UE in SNPN during registration
The stage-2 flow for the case when the UE registers in a non-subscribed SNPN
is described below in figure C.5.1. The AMF is located in the non-subscribed
SNPN. The UDM is located in the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN.
Figure C.5.1: Procedure for providing SOR-SNPN-SI and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS (if any)
during registration
For the steps below, security protection is described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [66].
1) The UE to the AMF: The UE initiates initial registration, emergency
registration or registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration
update (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) to the AMF by sending REGISTRATION REQUEST
message with the 5GS registration type IE indicating \"initial registration\",
\"emergency registration\" or \"mobility registration updating\";
2) Upon receiving the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the AMF executes the
registration procedure as defined in clause 4.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]. As
part of the registration procedure:
a) the AMF provides the registration type to the UDM using
Nudm_UECM_Registration. As a consequence, in case of the 5GS registration type
message indicates \"initial registration\" or \"emergency registration\" the
UDM shall delete the stored \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, if any, and
the stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if any, in UDR using
Nudr_DM_Update service operation (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]).
NOTE 1: Nudr_DM_Update service operation corresponds to Nudr_DR_Update service
operation (see 3GPP TS 29.504 [82] and 3GPP TS 29.505 [83]).
In addition:
a) if the AMF does not have subscription data for the UE, the AMF invokes
Nudm_SDM_Get service operation to the UDM to get amongst other information the
Access and Mobility Subscription data for the UE (see step 14b in clause
4.2.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]); or
b) if the AMF already has subscription data for the UE and:
i) the 5GS registration type IE in the received REGISTRATION REQUEST message
indicates \"initial registration\" and the \"SoR Update Indicator for Initial
Registration\" field in the UE context is set to \'the UDM requests the AMF to
retrieve SoR information when the UE performs NAS registration type \"initial
registration\"\' as specified in table 5.2.2.2.2-1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]); or
ii) the 5GS registration type IE in the received REGISTRATION REQUEST message
indicates \"emergency registration\" and the \"SoR Update Indicator for
Emergency Registration\" field in the UE context is set to \'the UDM requests
the AMF to retrieve SoR information when the UE performs NAS registration type
\"emergency registration\"\' as specified in table 5.2.2.2.2-1 of 3GPP TS
23.502 [63]);
then the AMF invokes Nudm_SDM_Get service operation message to the UDM to
retrieve the steering of roaming information (see step 14b in clause 4.2.2.2.2
of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]);
otherwise the AMF sends a REGISTRATION ACCEPT message without the steering of
roaming information to the UE and steps 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4, 5, 6 are skipped;
3a) If the user subscription information indicates to send the steering of
roaming information due to initial registration in a non-subscribed SNPN, then
the UDM shall provide the steering of roaming information to the UE when the
UE performs initial registration in a non-subscribed SNPN. Otherwise:
a) If the UE is registering on the subscribed SNPN and the UE has not
indicated support for SOR-SNPN-SI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the UDM
shall not provide the SOR-SNPN-SI to the UE; and
b) If the UE is registering on the subscribed SNPN and the UE has indicated
support for SOR-SNPN-SI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, or the UE is not
registering on the subscribed SNPN, the UDM may provide the SOR-SNPN-SI to the
UE based on the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN policy.
If the UDM is to provide the steering of roaming information to the UE when
the UE performs the registration in a non-subscribed SNPN and the subscribed
SNPN or HPLMN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is absent then steps 3b and 3c
are not performed and the UDM obtains the available SOR-SNPN-SI (i.e. all
retrieved from the UDR). In addition, if the UDM obtains the SOR-SNPN-SI and
\- the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, then the UDM
shall obtain the SOR-CMCI, if available, otherwise the UDM shall not obtain
the SOR-CMCI. If the SOR-CMCI is provided then the UDM may indicate to the UE
to store the SOR-CMCI in the ME by providing the \"Store the SOR-CMCI in the
ME\" indicator; and
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator is stored for the UE, then
the UDM shall obtain the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if available, otherwise the UDM shall
not obtain the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS.
If the UDM is to provide the steering of roaming information to the UE when
the UE performs the registration in a non-subscribed SNPN and the subscribed
SNPN or HPLMN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is present, then the UDM
obtains the SOR-SNPN-SI, SOR-CMCI, if any, and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any, from
the SOR-AF using steps 3b and 3c;
3b) The UDM to the SOR-AF: Nsoraf_SoR_Get request (SNPN identity, SUPI of the
UE, access type (see 3GPP TS 29.571 [72])). The SNPN identity and the access
type parameters, indicating where the UE is registering, are stored in the
UDM;
3c) The SOR-AF to the UDM: Nsoraf_SoR_Get response (the SOR-SNPN-SI, the SOR-
CMCI, if any, the \"Store the SOR-CMCI in the ME\" indicator, if any, and the
SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any);
Based on the information received in step 3b and any subscribed SNPN or HPLMN
specific criteria, the SOR-AF may include the SOR-SNPN-SI, the SOR-CMCI, if
any, optionally the \"Store the SOR-CMCI in the ME\" indicator, if any, and
the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any.
If the SOR-AF includes the SOR-SNPN-SI and the ME supports:
\- the SOR-CMCI, the SOR-AF may provide the SOR-CMCI and optionally the
\"Store the SOR-CMCI in the ME\" indicator, otherwise the SOR-AF shall provide
neither the SOR-CMCI nor the \"Store the SOR-CMCI in the ME\" indicator;and
\- the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, the SOR-AF may provide the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, otherwise
the SOR-AF shall not provide SOR-SNPN-SI-LS.
NOTE 1: In this version of the specification, when the access type where the
UE is registering indicates 3GPP access, then the UE is registering over the
NG-RAN access technology.
NOTE 2: The SOR-AF can include a different SOR-SNPN-SI, different SOR-CMCI, if
any, different \"Store the SOR-CMCI in the ME\" indicator, if any, and
different SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any, for each Nsoraf_SoR_Get request even if the
same SNPN identity, the SUPI of the UE, and the access type are provided to
the SOR-AF.
NOTE 3: The SOR-AF can subscribe to the UDM to be notified about the changes
of the roaming status of the UE identified by SUPI.
NOTE 4: The SOR-AF can determine that the ME supports the SOR-CMCI or the SOR-
SNPN-SI-LS if the Nsoraf_SoR_Info service operation has returned the \"ME
support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator or the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\"
indicator, respectively.
3d) The UDM forms the steering of roaming information as specified in 3GPP TS
33.501 [66] from the SOR-SNPN-SI, the SOR-CMCI, if any, the \"Store the SOR-
CMCI in the ME\" indicator, if any, and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any, obtained in
step 3a or the SOR-SNPN-SI, the SOR-CMCI, if any, the \"Store the SOR-CMCI in
the ME\" indicator, if any, and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any, obtained in step 3c.
If:
\- the SOR-SNPN-SI was not obtained in steps 3a or 3c; or
\- the SOR-AF has not sent to the UDM an Nsoraf_SoR_Get response (step 3c)
within an operator defined time after the UDM sending to the SOR-AF an
Nsoraf_SoR_Get request (step 3b);
NOTE 5: Stage 3 to define the timer needed for the SOR-AF to respond to the
UDM. The max time needs to be defined considering that this procedure is part
of the registration procedure.
and the UE is performing initial registration in a non-subscribed SNPN and the
user subscription information indicates to send the steering of roaming
information due to initial registration in a non-subscribed SNPN, then the UDM
forms the steering of roaming information as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [66]
from the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN indication that \'no change of the SOR-SNPN-
SI stored in the UE is needed and thus no SOR-SNPN-SI is provided\';
4) The UDM to the AMF: The UDM sends a response to the Nudm_SDM_Get service
operation to the AMF, which includes the steering of roaming information
within the Access and Mobility Subscription data. The Access and Mobility
Subscription data type is defined in clause 5.2.3.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]).
NOTE 6: The UDM cannot provide the SOR-SNPN-SI, the SOR-CMCI, if any, or the
SOR-SNPN-SI-LS to the AMF which does not support receiving SOR transparent
container (see 3GPP TS 29.503 [78]).
If the UE is performing initial registration or emergency registration and the
UDM supports SOR-CMCI or SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN shall
request the UE to acknowledge the successful security check of the received
steering of roaming information, by providing the indication as part of the
steering of roaming information in the Nudm_SDM_Get response service
operation. Otherwise, the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN may request the UE to
acknowledge the successful security check of the received steering of roaming
information, by providing the indication as part of the steering of roaming
information in the Nudm_SDM_Get response service operation;
5) The AMF to the UDM: As part of the registration procedure, the SNPN also
invokes Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation to the UDM to subscribe to
notification of changes of the subscription data (e.g. received in step 4)
including notification of updates of the steering of roaming information
included in the Access and Mobility Subscription data (see step 14c in clause
4.2.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]);
6) The AMF to the UE: The AMF shall transparently send the received steering
of roaming information to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message;
7) If the steering of roaming information is received and the security check
is successful, then:
a) if the UDM has not requested an acknowledgement from the UE, then the UE
shall send the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the serving AMF without
including an SOR transparent container; and
b) if the steering of roaming information contains the SOR-SNPN-SI, the ME
shall replace the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred
SNPNs for the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the
selected PLMN subscription with the received credentials holder controlled
prioritized list of preferred SNPNs, if any, and the ME shall replace the
credentials holder controlled prioritized list of GINs for the selected entry
of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription with the
received credentials holder controlled prioritized list of GINs, if any, and
delete the SNPNs identified by the credentials holder controlled prioritized
list of preferred SNPNs or credentials holder controlled prioritized list of
GINs from the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" and the list of
\"permanently forbidden SNPNs\", if they are present in these lists. If the
SOR information contains the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, the ME shall replace the
\"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access
for localized services in SNPN\" for the selected entry of the \"list of
subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription with the received
\"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access
for localized services in SNPN\", if any, and the ME shall replace the
\"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for access
for localized services in SNPN\" for the selected entry of the \"list of
subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription with the received
\"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for access
for localized services in SNPN\", if any, and delete the SNPNs identified by
the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for
access for localized services in SNPN\" from the list of \"temporarily
forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\" and the list of
\"permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\", if
they are present in these lists. Additionally, the UE may perform SNPN
selection. If the UE decides to perform SNPN selection:
i) if the UE has a list of available and allowable SNPN in the area and based
on this list or any other implementation specific means the UE determines that
there is a higher priority SNPN than the selected SNPN; or
ii) the UE does not have a list of available and allowable SNPN in the area
and is unable to determine whether there is a higher priority SNPN than the
selected SNPN using any other implementation specific means;
and the UE is in automatic network selection mode:
A) if the UE is configured with the SOR-CMCI or received the SOR-CMCI over N1
NAS signalling, the UE shall apply the actions in clause C.4.2. In this case
steps 8 to 11 are skipped;
B) otherwise, the UE shall:
i) release the current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and then attempt
to obtain service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3. In
this case, steps 8 to 11 are skipped. The UE shall suspend the transmission of
5GSM messages until the N1 NAS signalling is released. The UE shall not
initiate the establishment of a new N1 signalling connection, unless for the
purpose of initiating a registration procedure for emergency services or
establishing an emergency PDU session, until the attempts to obtain service on
a higher priority SNPN are completed. If the UE has an established emergency
PDU session (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]), the receipt of the steering of roaming
information shall not trigger the release of the N1 NAS signalling connection.
The UE shall release the current N1 NAS signalling connection locally
subsequently after the emergency PDU session is released. If the UE needs to
disable the N1 mode capability (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) and there is no
emergency service pending, the UE shall first attempt to obtain service on a
higher priority SNPN as described in this step, and if no higher priority SNPN
can be selected but the last registered SNPN is selected, then the UE shall
disable the N1 mode capability; or
ii) not release the current N1 NAS signalling connection locally (e.g. if the
UE has established PDU session(s)) and skip steps 8 to 10;
NOTE 7: When the UE is in the manual mode of operation or the current chosen
non-subscribed SNPN is part of the user controlled prioritized list of
preferred SNPNs, the UE stays on the current chosen non-subscribed SNPN.
8) If the UE\'s ME is configured with an indication that the UE is to receive
the steering of roaming information due to initial registration in a non-
subscribed SNPN, but neither the SOR-SNPN-SI nor the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN
indication that \'no change of the SOR-SNPN-SI stored in the UE is needed and
thus no SOR-SNPN-SI is provided\' is received in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message, when the UE performs initial registration in a VPLMN or if the
steering of roaming information is received but the security check is not
successful, then the UE shall:
a) if the SOR transparent container is included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message, send the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the serving AMF without
including an SOR transparent container;
b) if the current chosen non-subscribed SNPN is not contained in the list of
\"SNPNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\" for the selected entry in
the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription, and is not
part of the user controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for the
selected entry in the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN
subscription, and the UE is not in manual mode of operation, release the
current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and attempt to obtain service on
a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that
the current SNPN is considered as lowest priority, and skip steps 9 to 11. The
UE shall suspend the transmission of 5GSM messages until the N1 NAS signalling
is released. If the UE has an established emergency PDU session (see 3GPP TS
24.501 [64]), the UE shall release the current N1 NAS signalling connection
locally after the release of the emergency PDU session. If the UE needs to
disable the N1 mode capability (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) and there is no
emergency service pending, the UE shall first attempt to obtain service on a
higher priority SNPN as described in this step, and if no higher priority SNPN
can be selected but the last registered SNPN is selected, then the UE shall
disable the N1 mode capability; and
c) if the current chosen non-subscribed SNPN is not contained in the list of
\"SNPNs where registration was aborted due to SOR\" for the selected entry in
the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription, store the
SNPN identity in the list of \"SNPNs where registration was aborted due to
SOR\" for the selected entry in the \"list of subscriber data\" or the
selected PLMN subscription;
NOTE 8: When the UE is in the manual mode of operation or the current chosen
non-subscribed SNPN is part of the user controlled prioritized list of
preferred SNPNs, the UE stays on the current chosen non-subscribed SNPN.
9) The UE to the AMF: If the UDM has requested an acknowledgement from the UE
and the UE verified that the steering of roaming information has been provided
by the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN in step 7, then:
a) the UE sends the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message to the serving AMF with an
SOR transparent container including the UE acknowledgement;
b) the UE shall set the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator in the header of
the SOR transparent container to \"supported\";
b1) if the UE supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized
services in SNPN, the UE shall set the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\"
indicator in the header of the SOR transparent container to \"supported\"; and
c) if:
1) the steering of roaming information contains the SOR-SNPN-SI, the UE is
configured with the SOR-CMCI or received the SOR-CMCI over N1 NAS signalling,
the UE is in automatic network selection mode and the UE decides to perform
SNPN selection, then the UE shall apply the actions in clause C.4.2, and step
11 is skipped; or
2) the steering of roaming information contains subscribed SNPN or HPLMN
indication that \'no change of the SOR-SNPN-SI stored in the UE is needed and
thus no SOR-SNPN-SI is provided\', then step 11 is skipped;
10) The AMF to the UDM: If an SOR transparent container is received in the
REGISTRATION COMPLETE message, the AMF uses the Nudm_SDM_Info service
operation to provide the received SOR transparent container to the UDM. If the
subscribed SNPN or HPLMN decided that the UE is to acknowledge the successful
security check of the received steering of roaming information in step 4, the
UDM verifies that the acknowledgement is provided by the UE as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 [66]. If:
\- the "ME support of SOR-CMCI" indicator in the header of the SOR transparent
container is set to "supported", then the UDM shall store the "ME support of
SOR-CMCI" indicator, otherwise the UDM shall delete the stored "ME support of
SOR-CMCI" indicator, if any; and
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator in the header of the SOR
transparent container is set to \"supported\", then the UDM shall store the
\"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, otherwise the UDM shall delete the
stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if any
NOTE 9: The UDM cannot receive the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator or the
\"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator from the AMF which does not support
receiving SoR transparent container (see 3GPP TS 29.503 [78]).
10a) The UDM to the SOR-AF: Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE, successful
delivery, \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, if any, \"ME support of SOR-
SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if any). If the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN policy for
the SOR-AF invocation is present and the UDM received and verified the UE
acknowledgement in step 10, then the UDM informs the SOR-AF about successful
delivery of the SOR-SNPN-SI to the UE. If:
\- the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, the UDM
shall include the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator; and
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator is stored for the UE, the
UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator; and
11) If the UE has a list of available SNPNs in the area and based on this list
the UE determines that there is a higher priority SNPN than the selected SNPN
and the UE is in automatic network selection mode, then the UE may attempt to
obtain service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3 after
the release of the N1 NAS signalling connection. If within an implementation
dependent time the N1 NAS signalling connection is not released, then the UE
may locally release the N1 signalling connection except when the UE has an
established emergency PDU session (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
When the UE performs initial registration for emergency services (see 3GPP TS
24.501 [64] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [63]) and the AMF performs the authentication
procedure, then based on subscribed SNPN or HPLMN policy, the SOR procedure
described in this clause may apply.
If:
\- the UE in manual mode of operation encounters scenario mentioned in step 8
above; and
\- upon switching to automatic network selection mode, the UE remembers that
it is still registered on the where the security check failure of SOR
information was encountered as described in step 8;
the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain
service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an
exception that the current registered SNPN is considered as lowest priority.
If the UE has an established emergency PDU session, then the UE shall attempt
to perform the SNPN selection subsequently after the emergency PDU session is
released.
NOTE 10: The receipt of the steering of roaming information by itself does not
trigger the release of the emergency PDU session.
NOTE 11: The list of available and allowable SNPNs in the area is
implementation specific.
# C.6 Stage-2 flow for steering of UE in SNPN after registration
The stage-2 flow for the steering of UE in SNPN after registration is
indicated in figure C.6.1. The UE is registered on an SNPN which can be the
subscribed SNPN or a non-subscribed SNPN. The AMF is located in the selected
SNPN. The UDM is located in the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN.
The procedure is triggered if:
a) the UDM supports obtaining SOR-SNPN-SI, if any, SOR-CMCI, if any, and SOR-
SNPN-SI-LS, if any, from the SOR-AF, the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN policy for
the SOR-AF invocation is present in the UDM, and the SOR-AF provides the UDM
with:
\- the SOR-SNPN-SI for a UE identified by SUPI if the ME supports SOR-SNPN-SI;
\- the SOR-CMCI for a UE identified by SUPI if the ME supports SOR-CMCI; or
\- the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS for a UE identified by SUPI if the ME supports SOR-SNPN-
SI-LS; or
NOTE 0: The SOR-AF can determine that the ME supports SOR-SNPN-SI if the
Nsoraf_SoR_Info service operation has returned the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-
SI\" indicator. The UDM determines that the ME supports SOR-SNPN-SI if the UE
is in a non-subscribed SNPN or the UE is a subscribed SNPN and the AMF has
indicated to the UDM that the UE supports SOR-SNPN-SI.
NOTE 1: The SOR-AF can determine that the ME supports the SOR-CMCI if the
Nsoraf_SoR_Info service operation has returned the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\"
indicator. How the SOR-AF determines that the USIM for the indicated SUPI
supports SOR-CMCI is implementation specific.
NOTE 1a: The SOR-AF can determine that the ME supports SOR-SNPN-SI-LS if the
Nsoraf_SoR_Info service operation has returned the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-
SI-LS\" indicator. The UDM determines that the ME supports SOR-SNPN-SI-LS.
b) a SOR-SNPN-SI (if supported by ME), a SOR-CMCI (if supported by ME), or a
SOR-SNPN-SI-LS (if supported by ME) becomes available in the UDM (i.e.
retrieved from the UDR).
NOTE 2: Before providing the UDM with SOR-SNPN-SI for a UE identified by SUPI,
the SOR-AF, based on subscribed SNPN or HPLMN policies or criteria, can obtain
the user location information by triggering the unified location service
exposure procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 23.273 [70] clause 6.5, or
additionally based on implementation specific criteria, by requesting the UE
location information from other application function using implementation
specific method. This user location information can then be used in the SOR-AF
algorithms.
NOTE 3: Before providing the UDM with a new SOR-SNPN-SI for a UE identified by
SUPI, the SOR-AF, based on subscribed SNPN or HPLMN policies or criteria, can
obtain the user location information by triggering the unified location
service exposure procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 23.273 [70] clause 6.5, or
additionally based on implementation specific criteria, by requesting the UE
location information from other application function using implementation
specific method. This user location information can then be used in the SOR-AF
algorithms.
Figure C.6.1: Procedure for providing SOR-SNPN-SI (if any) and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS
(if any) after registration
For the steps below, security protection is described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [66].
1) The SOR-AF to the UDM: Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update request is sent to
the UDM to trigger the update of the UE with the SOR-SNPN-SI,if any, the SOR-
CMCI, if any, the \"Store the SOR-CMCI in the ME\" indicator, if any, and the
SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any, for a UE identified by SUPI.
2) The UDM to the AMF: The UDM notifies the changes of the user profile to the
affected AMF by the means of invoking Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation.
The Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation contains the steering of roaming
information that needs to be delivered transparently to the UE over NAS within
the Access and Mobility Subscription data. If the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN
decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check of the
received steering of roaming information, the Nudm_SDM_Notification service
operation also contains an indication that the UDM requests an acknowledgement
from the UE as part of the steering of roaming information. If the SOR-SNPN-SI
was obtained, the UDM shall include the SOR-SNPN-SI in to the SOR information.
If the SOR-CMCI was obtained, the UDM shall include the SOR-CMCI into the
steering of roaming information and shall requests an acknowledgement from the
UE as part of the steering of roaming information. If the \"Store the SOR-CMCI
in the ME\" indicator was obtained, the UDM shall include the \"Store the SOR-
CMCI in the ME\" indicator If the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS was obtained, the UDM shall
include the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS into the SOR information;
NOTE 4: The UDM cannot provide the SOR-SNPN-SI SOR-CMCI, or SOR-SNPN-SI-LS to
the AMF which does not support receiving SOR transparent container (see 3GPP
TS 29.503 [78]).
3) The AMF to the UE: the AMF sends a DL NAS TRANSPORT message to the served
UE. The AMF includes in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message the steering of roaming
information received from the UDM.
4) Upon receiving the steering of roaming information, the UE shall perform a
security check on the steering of roaming information included in the DL NAS
TRANSPORT message to verify that the steering of roaming information is
provided by the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN, and
i) if the security check is successful, then:
a) if the steering of roaming information contains the SOR-SNPN-SI, the ME
shall replace the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred
SNPNs for the selected entry of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the
selected PLMN subscription with the received credentials holder controlled
prioritized list of preferred SNPNs, if any, the ME shall replace the
credentials holder controlled prioritized list of GINs for the selected entry
of the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription with the
received credentials holder controlled prioritized list of GINs, if any, and
the ME shall delete the SNPNs identified by the credentials holder controlled
prioritized list of preferred SNPNs or credentials holder controlled
prioritized list of GINs from the list of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" and
the list of \"permanently forbidden SNPNs\", if they are present in these
lists. If the SOR information contains the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, the ME shall
replace the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred
SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\" for the selected entry of
the \"list of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription with the
received \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs
for access for localized services in SNPN\", if any, and the ME shall replace
the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for
access for localized services in SNPN\" for the selected entry of the \"list
of subscriber data\" or the selected PLMN subscription with the received
\"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for access
for localized services in SNPN\", if any, and delete the SNPNs identified by
the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for
access for localized services in SNPN\" from the list of \"temporarily
forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\" and the list of
\"permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\", if
they are present in these lists;
b) if the UDM has requested an acknowledgement from the UE in the DL NAS
TRANSPORT message, the UE sends an UL NAS TRANSPORT message to the serving AMF
with an SOR transparent container including the UE acknowledgement and the UE
shall set:
\- the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator to \"supported\"; and
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator to \"supported\" if the UE
supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN.
c) if the UE is in automatic network selection mode, the selected SNPN is a
non-subscribed SNPN and the UE decides to perform SNPN selection, then:
\- if the UE is configured with the SOR-CMCI or received the SOR-CMCI over N1
NAS signalling, the UE shall apply the actions in clause C.4; or
\- the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with
RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain
service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3.
d) if the selected SNPN is a non-subscribed SNPN and the UE has an established
emergency PDU session then the UE may attempt to perform the SNPN selection
subsequently after the emergency PDU session is released, if the UE is in
automatic network selection mode.
e) if the UDM has not requested an acknowledgement from the UE, then steps 4
is skipped; and
ii)the security check is not successful:
a) step 5 is skipped; and
b) if the selected SNPN is a non-subscribed SNPN and the UE is in automatic
network selection mode, then:
A) if the UE has a stored SOR-CMCI, then:
\- if there are ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall apply the
actions in clause C.4.2, and the current SNPN is considered as lowest
priority; or
\- if there are no ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall release the
current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and attempt to obtain service on
a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that
the current SNPN is considered as lowest priority;
B) if the UE does not have a stored SOR-CMCI, then:
\- if there are ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall wait until it
moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see
3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain service on a higher priority
SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that the current SNPN is
considered as lowest priority. If the selected SNPN is a non-subscribed SNPN
and the UE has an established emergency PDU session, then the UE shall attempt
to perform the SNPN selection after the emergency PDU session is released; or
\- if there are no ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall release the
current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and attempt to obtain service on
a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that
the current SNPN is considered as lowest priority.
NOTE 5: When the UE is in the manual mode of operation and the current chosen
non-subscribed SNPN is part of the user controlled prioritized list of
preferred SNPNs, the UE stays on the current chosen non-subscribed SNPN.
5) The AMF to the UDM: If the UL NAS TRANSPORT message with an SOR transparent
container is received, the AMF uses the Nudm_SDM_Info service operation to
provide the received SOR transparent container to the UDM. If the subscribed
SNPN or HPLMN decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check
of the received steering of roaming information in step 1, the UDM verifies
that the acknowledgement is provided by the UE. If:
\- the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator in the header of the SOR
transparent container is set to \"supported\", then the UDM shall store the
\"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, otherwise the UDM shall delete the
stored \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, if any; and
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator in the header of the SOR
transparent container is set to \"supported\", then the UDM shall store the
\"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, otherwise the UDM shall delete the
stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if any.
If the present flow was invoked by the UDM after receiving from the SOR-AF the
SOR-SNPN-SI, if any, SOR-CMCI, if any, and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any, for a UE
identified by SUPI using an Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update request, and the
UDM verification of the UE acknowledgement is successful, then the UDM informs
the SOR-AF about successful delivery of the SOR-SNPN-SI,if any SOR-CMCI, if
any, and SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any, using Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE,
successful delivery); and
6) The UDM to the SOR-AF: Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE, successful
delivery, \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator, if any, \"ME support of SOR-
SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if any). If the subscribed SNPN or HPLMN policy for
the SOR-AF invocation is present and the UDM received and verified the UE
acknowledgement in step 5, then the UDM informs the SOR-AF about successful
delivery of the SOR-SNPN-SI, if any, SOR-CMCI, if any, SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any,
to the UE. If:
\- the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator is stored for the UE, the UDM
shall include the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" indicator; and
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator is stored for the UE, the
UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator.
If the selected SNPN is a non-subscribed SNPN and:
\- the UE in manual mode of operation encounters security check failure of SOR
information in DL NAS TRANSPORT message; and
\- upon switching to automatic network selection mode, the UE remembers that
it is still registered on the where the security check failure of SOR
information was encountered;
the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain
service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an
exception that the current registered SNPN is considered as lowest priority.
If the selected SNPN is a non-subscribed SNPN and the UE has an established
emergency PDU session, then the UE shall attempt to perform the SNPN selection
after the emergency PDU session is released.
NOTE 6: The receipt of the steering of roaming information by itself does not
trigger the release of the emergency PDU session.
NOTE 7: If the selected SNPN is the subscribed SNPN, regardless of whether the
UE is in automatic network selection mode or manual network selection mode,
regardless of whether the UE has an established emergency PDU session or not,
and regardless of whether the security check is successful or not successful,
the UE is not required to perform the SNPN selection.
# C.7 Stage-2 flow for providing UE with SOR-SNPN-SI or SOR-SNPN-SI-LS in
HPLMN or VPLMN after registration
The stage-2 flow for providing UE with SOR-SNPN-SI or SOR-SNPN-SI-LS in HPLMN
or VPLMN after registration is indicated in figure C.7.1, when the ME and the
HPLMN support the SOR-SNPN-SI or SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, respectively. The selected
PLMN can be the HPLMN or a VPLMN. The AMF is located in the selected PLMN. The
UDM is located in the HPLMN.
In this procedure, the SOR-SNPN-SI or SOR-SNPN-SI-LS is sent without the list
of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations.
NOTE 1: The SOR-AF can determine that the ME supports the SOR-SNPN-SI or SOR-
SNPN-SI-LS if the Nsoraf_SoR_Info service operation has returned the \"ME
support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator or \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\"
indicator, respectively. The UDM can determine that the ME supports the SOR-
SNPN-SI or SOR-SNPN-SI-LS if the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator or
\"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, respectively, is stored for the
UE.
The procedure is triggered if:
a) the UDM supports obtaining the SOR-SNPN-SI or SOR-SNPN-SI-LS from the SOR-
AF, the HPLMN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is present in the UDM, and the
SOR-AF provides the UDM with the SOR-SNPN-SI or the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS for a UE
identified by SUPI; or
b) the SOR-SNPN-SI or the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS becomes available in the UDM (i.e.,
retrieved from the UDR).
Figure C.7.1: Procedure for configuring UE with SOR-SNPN-SI or SOR-SNPN-SI-LS
in a PLMN after registration
For the steps below, security protection is described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [66].
1) The SOR-AF to the UDM: Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update request is sent to
the UDM to trigger the update of the UE with the SOR-SNPN-SI or SOR-SNPN-SI-
LS.
2) The UDM to the AMF: The UDM notifies the changes of the user profile to the
affected AMF by the means of invoking Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation.
The Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation contains the steering of roaming
information that needs to be delivered transparently to the UE over NAS within
the Access and Mobility Subscription data. If the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN
decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check of the
received steering of roaming information, the Nudm_SDM_Notification service
operation also contains an indication that the UDM requests an acknowledgement
from the UE as part of the steering of roaming information. Upon receiving the
SOR-SNPN-SI or the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, the UDM shall include the SOR-SNPN-SI (if
any), SOR-SNPN-SI-LS (if any), and the HPLMN indication that \'no change of
the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list stored
in the UE is needed and thus no list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations is provided\'.
NOTE 2: The UDM cannot provide the SOR-SNPN-SI, or the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS to the
AMF which does not support receiving SoR transparent container (see 3GPP TS
29.503 [78]).
3) The AMF to the UE: the AMF sends a DL NAS TRANSPORT message to the served
UE. The AMF includes in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message the steering of roaming
information received from the UDM.
4) Upon receiving the steering of roaming information containing the SOR-SNPN-
SI (if any), the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS (if any), and the HPLMN indication that \'no
change of the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
list stored in the UE is needed and thus no list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations is provided\', the UE shall perform a security check
on the steering of roaming information included in the DL NAS TRANSPORT
message to verify that the steering of roaming information is provided by
HPLMN, and:
a) if the security check is successful, then:
\- the ME shall replace the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of
preferred SNPNs for the selected PLMN subscription with the received
credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs, if any, the
ME shall replace the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of GINs
for the selected PLMN subscription with the received credentials holder
controlled prioritized list of GINs, if any, and the ME shall delete the SNPNs
identified by the credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred
SNPNs or credentials holder controlled prioritized list of GINs from the list
of \"temporarily forbidden SNPNs\" and the list of \"permanently forbidden
SNPNs\", if they are present in these lists: and
\- the ME shall replace the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list
of preferred SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\" for the
selected PLMN subscription with the received \"credentials holder controlled
prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for access for localized services in
SNPN\", if any, the ME shall replace the \"credentials holder controlled
prioritized list of preferred GINs for access for localized services in SNPN\"
for the selected PLMN subscription with the received \"credentials holder
controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs for access for localized
services in SNPN\", if any, and the ME shall delete the SNPNs identified by
the \"credentials holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs for
access for localized services in SNPN\" from the list of \"temporarily
forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\" and the list of
\"permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN\", if
they are present in these lists.
If the UDM has requested an acknowledgement from the UE in the DL NAS
TRANSPORT message, the UE sends an UL NAS TRANSPORT message to the serving AMF
with an SOR transparent container including the UE acknowledgement and the UE
shall set:
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator to \"supported\"; and
\- the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator to \"supported\" if the UE
supports access to an SNPN providing access for localized services in SNPN.
If the UDM has not requested an acknowledgement from the UE then step 5 is
skipped; and
b) if the selected PLMN is a VPLMN, the security check is not successful and
the UE is in automatic network, then
\- if the UE has a stored SOR-CMCI, then:
\- if there are ongoing PDU sessions or services, the current PLMN is
considered as lowest priority and the UE shall apply the actions in clause
C.4.2;
\- if there are no ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall release the
current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and attempt to obtain service on
a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that
the current PLMN is considered as lowest priority;
\- if the UE does not have a SOR-CMCI stored in the non-volatile memory of the
ME, then:
\- if there are ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall wait until it
moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see
3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain service on a higher priority
PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3 by acting as if timer T that controls
periodic attempts has expired, with an exception that the current PLMN is
considered as lowest priority. If the selected PLMN is a VPLMN and the UE has
an established emergency PDU session then the UE shall attempt to perform the
PLMN selection after the emergency PDU session is released and after the UE
enters idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP
TS 24.501 [64]); or
\- if there are no ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall release the
current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and attempt to obtain service on
a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that
the current PLMN is considered as lowest priority.
Step 5 is skipped;
NOTE 3: When the UE is in the manual mode of operation or the current chosen
VPLMN is part of the \"User Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
list, the UE stays on the VPLMN.
5) The AMF to the UDM: If the UL NAS TRANSPORT message with an SOR transparent
container is received, the AMF uses the Nudm_SDM_Info service operation to
provide the received SOR transparent container to the UDM. If the HPLMN
decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check of the
received steering of roaming information in step 2, the UDM verifies that the
acknowledgement is provided by the UE. The UDM shall store the \"ME support of
SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator. If the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator in
the header of the SOR transparent container is set to \"supported\", then the
UDM shall store the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, otherwise the
UDM shall delete the stored \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator, if
any.
If the present flow was invoked by the UDM after receiving from the SOR-AF the
SOR-SNPN-SI or the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS for a UE identified by SUPI using an
Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update request, and the UDM verification of the UE
acknowledgement is successful, then the UDM informs the SOR-AF about
successful delivery of the SOR-SNPN-SI or the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS using
Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE, successful delivery); and
6) The UDM to the SOR-AF: Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE, successful
delivery, \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator, \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-
SI-LS\" indicator, if any). If the HPLMN policy for the SOR-AF invocation is
present and the HPLMN UDM received and verified the UE acknowledgement in step
5, then the UDM informs the SOR-AF about successful delivery of the SOR-SNPN-
SI or the SOR-SNPN-SI-LS to the UE. The UDM shall include the \"ME support of
SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator. If the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\" indicator is
stored for the UE, the UDM shall include the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI-LS\"
indicator.
If the selected PLMN is a VPLMN and:
\- the UE in manual mode of operation encounters security check failure of SOR
information in DL NAS TRANSPORT message; and
\- upon switching to automatic network selection mode the UE remembers that it
is still registered on the PLMN where the security check failure of SOR
information was encountered;
the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain
service on a higher priority PLMN as specified in clause 4.4.3.3, by acting as
if timer T that controls periodic attempts has expired, with an exception that
the current registered PLMN is considered as lowest priority. If the selected
PLMN is a VPLMN and the UE has an established emergency PDU session then the
UE shall attempt to perform the PLMN selection after the emergency PDU session
is released and after the UE enters idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
NOTE 4: The receipt of the steering of roaming information by itself does not
trigger the release of the emergency PDU session.
# C.8 Stage-2 flow for providing UE with list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations in SNPN after registration
The stage-2 flow for providing UE with the list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations in an SNPN after registration is indicated in figure
C.8.1. The selected SNPN is a non-subscribed SNPN. The AMF is located in the
selected SNPN. The UDM is located in the HPLMN.
In this procedure, the list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations
is sent in plain text or sent within the secured packet, without the SOR-SNPN-
SI.
Based on HPLMN policy, if the HPLMN supports sending the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations in plain text or secured packet to the UE
when the UE is registered to an SNPN, then the procedure is triggered:
\- If the UDM supports obtaining a list of preferred PLMN/access technology
combinations or a secured packet from the SOR-AF, the HPLMN policy for the
SOR-AF invocation is present in the UDM and the SOR-AF provides the UDM with a
new list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or a secured packet
for a UE identified by SUPI; or
\- When a new list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or a
secured packet becomes available in the UDM (i.e., retrieved from the UDR).
Figure C.8.1: Procedure for configuring UE with list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations in an SNPN after registration
For the steps below, security protection is described in 3GPP TS 33.501 [66].
1) The SOR-AF to the UDM: Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update request is sent to
the UDM to trigger the update of the UE with the new list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations or a secured packet for a UE identified by
SUPI.
2) The UDM to the AMF: The UDM notifies the changes of the user profile to the
affected AMF by the means of invoking Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation.
The Nudm_SDM_Notification service operation contains the steering of roaming
information that needs to be delivered transparently to the UE over NAS within
the Access and Mobility Subscription data. If the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN
decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check of the
received steering of roaming information, the Nudm_SDM_Notification service
operation also contains an indication that the UDM requests an acknowledgement
from the UE as part of the steering of roaming information.
3) The AMF to the UE: the AMF sends a DL NAS TRANSPORT message to the served
UE. The AMF includes in the DL NAS TRANSPORT message the steering of roaming
information received from the UDM.
4) Upon receiving the steering of roaming information, the UE shall perform a
security check on the steering of roaming information included in the DL NAS
TRANSPORT message to verify that the steering of roaming information is
provided by HPLMN, and:
a) if the security check is successful:
\- if the steering of roaming information contains a secured packet (see 3GPP
TS 31.115 [67]) and the service \"data download via SMS Point-to-point\" is
allocated and activated in the USIM Service Table (see 3GPP TS 31.102 [40]),
the ME shall upload the secured packet to the USIM using procedures in 3GPP TS
31.111 [41]; and
\- if the steering of roaming information contains the list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations, the ME shall replace the highest priority
entries in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN Selector with Access Technology\"
list stored in the ME with the received list of preferred PLMN/access
technology combinations, and delete the PLMNs identified by the list of
preferred PLMN/access technology combinations from the Forbidden PLMN list and
from the Forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service list, if they are present in these
lists.
If the UDM has requested an acknowledgement from the UE in the DL NAS
TRANSPORT message, the UE sends an UL NAS TRANSPORT message to the serving AMF
with an SOR transparent container including the UE acknowledgement and the UE
shall set the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator to \"supported\".
If the UDM has not requested an acknowledgement from the UE then step 5 is
skipped; and
b) if the security check is not successful and the UE is in automatic network
selection mode, then:
\- if the UE has a stored SOR-CMCI, then:
\- if there are ongoing PDU sessions or services, the current SNPN is
considered as lowest priority and the UE shall apply the actions in clause
C.4.2;
\- if there are no ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall release the
current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and attempt to obtain service on
a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that
the current SNPN is considered as lowest priority;
\- if the UE does not have a SOR-CMCI stored in the non-volatile memory of the
ME, then:
\- if there are ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall wait until it
moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see
3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain service on a higher priority
SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that the current SNPN is
considered as lowest priority. If the UE has an established emergency PDU
session then the UE shall attempt to perform the SNPN selection after the
emergency PDU session is released and after the UE enters idle mode or 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]); or
\- if there are no ongoing PDU sessions or services, the UE shall release the
current N1 NAS signalling connection locally and attempt to obtain service on
a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an exception that
the current SNPN is considered as lowest priority.
Step 5 is skipped;
NOTE 1: When the UE is in the manual mode of operation or the current chosen
non-subscribed SNPN is part of the user controlled prioritized list of
preferred SNPNs, the UE stays on current chosen non-subscribed SNPN.
5) The AMF to the UDM: If the UL NAS TRANSPORT message with an SOR transparent
container is received, the AMF uses the Nudm_SDM_Info service operation to
provide the received SOR transparent container to the UDM. If the HPLMN
decided that the UE is to acknowledge successful security check of the
received steering of roaming information in step 2, the UDM verifies that the
acknowledgement is provided by the UE. The UDM shall store the \"ME support of
SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator.
If the present flow was invoked by the UDM after receiving from the SOR-AF a
list of preferred PLMN/access technology combinations or a secured packet for
a UE identified by SUPI using an Nudm_ParameterProvision_Update request, and
the UDM verification of the UE acknowledgement is successful, then the UDM
informs the SOR-AF about successful delivery of the steering of roaming
information using Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE, successful delivery); and
6) The UDM to the SOR-AF: Nsoraf_SoR_Info (SUPI of the UE, successful
delivery, \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator). If the HPLMN policy for
the SOR-AF invocation is present and the HPLMN UDM received and verified the
UE acknowledgement in step 5, then the UDM informs the SOR-AF about successful
delivery of the steering of roaming information to the UE. The UDM shall
include the \"ME support of SOR-SNPN-SI\" indicator.
If:
\- the UE in manual mode of operation encounters security check failure of SOR
information in DL NAS TRANSPORT message; and
\- upon switching to automatic network selection mode the UE remembers that it
is still registered on non-subscribed SNPN where the security check failure of
SOR information was encountered;
the UE shall wait until it moves to idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC
inactive indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]) before attempting to obtain
service on a higher priority SNPN as specified in clause 4.9.3, with an
exception that the current registered SNPN is considered as lowest priority.
If the UE has an established emergency PDU session then the UE shall attempt
to perform the SNPN selection after the emergency PDU session is released and
after the UE enters idle mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive
indication (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [64]).
NOTE 2: The receipt of the steering of roaming information by itself does not
trigger the release of the emergency PDU session.
