# Introduction
Considering vertical-specific applications and edge applications as the major
consumers of 3GPP-provided data analytics services, the application enablement
layer can play role on the exposure of data analytics services from different
3GPP domains to the vertical/ASP in a unified manner; and on defining, at an
overarching layer, value-add application data analytics services which cover
stats/predictions for the end-to-end application service.
This technical specification provides procedures for enabling ADAE service
over 3GPP networks, while the architecture is defined in TS 23.434 [2].

# 5 Application architecture for ADAES
## 5.1 General
This clause provides the functional architecture for ADAE. This includes the
on-network and off-network functional models which are provided in detail in
clause 5.2.
In addition, the ADAE internal architecture is described in 5.3, which aligns
with the 3GPP data analytics framework (specified in TS 23.288 [4]) and
introduces new logical entities within ADAE framework, such as the A-DCCF and
A-ADRF.
## 5.2 Functional architecture
### 5.2.1 General
The functional architecture for the application data analytics enablement is
based on the generic functional model specified in clause 6.2 of 3GPP TS
23.434 [2]. It is organized into functional entities to describe a functional
architecture which addresses the support for application data analytics
enablement aspects for vertical applications.
### 5.2.2 On-network Functional Architecture
For the on-network functional architecture, both service-based representation
and reference point representation are provided.
Figure 5.2.2-1 depicts the application data analytics enablement architecture
in the non-roaming case, using the reference point representation showing how
various entities interact with each other.
Figure 5.2.2-1: Architecture for application data analytics enablement \--
reference points representation
The application data analytics enablement client communicates with the
application data analytics enablement server over the ADAE-UU reference point.
The application data analytics enablement client provides the support for
application data analytics enablement functions to the VAL client(s) over
ADAEâ€‘C reference point. The VAL server(s) communicates with the application
data analytics enablement server over the ADAE-S reference point. The
application data analytics enablement server, acting as AF, may communicate
with the 5G Core Network functions (over N33 reference point to NEF and N6
reference point to UPF) and OAM (over ADAE-OAM interface).
Figure 5.2.2-2 exhibits the service-based interfaces for providing and
consuming application data analytics enablement services. The application data
analytics enablement server could provide service to VAL server and ADAE
client through interface SAdae.
Figure 5.2.2-2: Architecture for application data analytics enablement \--
Service based representation
Figure 5.2.2-3 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization of
the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [9].
Figure 5.2.2-3: Architecture for application data analytics enablement
utilizing the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA -- Service based
representation
Figure 5.2.2-4 illustrates the architecture for inter-service communication
between ADAES server and other SEAL server.
Figure 5.2.2-4: Inter-service communication between ADAES server and other
SEAL server
The ADAE server interacts with another SEAL server for inter-service
communication over SEAL-X reference point.
### 5.2.3 Off-network Functional Architecture
Figure 5.2.3-1 illustrates the generic off-network functional model for ADAE.
Figure 5.2.3-1: Generic off-network functional model
In the vertical application layer, the VAL client of UE1 communicates with VAL
client of UE2 over VAL-PC5 reference point. An application data analytics
enablement client of UE1 interacts with the corresponding application data
analytics enablement client of UE2 over ADAE-PC5 reference points. The UE1, if
connected to the network via Uu reference point, can also act as a UE-to-
network relay, to enable UE2 to access the VAL server(s) over the VAL-UU
reference point.
The service-based interface representation is specified in clause 15 of 3GPP
TS 23.434 [2].
## 5.3 ADAE internal architecture
In ADAE framework, A-DCCF and A-ADRF can be defined as functionalities within
the internal ADAE architecture and can offer the following functionalities:
\- Application layer - Data Collection and Coordination Function (A-DCCF)
coordinates the collection and distribution of data requested by the consumer
(ADAE server). Data Collection Coordination is supported by a A-DCCF. ADAE
server can send requests for data to the A-DCCF rather than directly to the
Data Sources. A-DCCF may also perform data processing/abstraction and data
preparation based on the VAL server requirements.
\- Application layer -- Analytics and Data Repository Function (A-ADRF) stores
historical data and/or analytics, i.e., data and/or analytics related to past
time period that has been obtained by the consumer (e.g. ADAE server). After
the consumer obtains data and/or analytics, consumer may store historical data
and/or analytics in an A-ADRF. Whether the consumer directly contacts the
A-ADRF or goes via the A-DCCF is based on configuration.
Figure 5.3-1 illustrates the generic functional model for ADAE when re-using
the 3GPP network data analytics model.
Figure 5.3-1: ADAE internal functional architecture
In this model, an A-DCCF is used to fetch data or put data into an
application-level entity (e.g. A-ADRF, Data Source). Such A-DCCF coordinates
the collection and distribution of data requested by ADAE server (over
ADCCF-1, ADAE-X). ADAE server can also directly interact with the Data Sources
via ADAE-Y.
Also, Application layer -- Analytics and Data Repository Function (A-ADRF) can
be used to store historical data and/or analytics, i.e., data and/or analytics
related to past time period that has been obtained by the ADAE server (via
AADRF-1) or other NFs/NWDAF. ADAE server can also fetch historical data from
A-ADRF. Whether the ADAE server directly contacts the A-ADRF or goes via the
A-DCCF is based on configuration.
Data Sources can be 5GS data sources (5GC, OAM) or enablement layer data
sources (SEAL, EEL) or external data sources at the DN side (VAL server/ EAS)
and VAL UEs. A-DCCF and A-ADRF can be used only for interacting with certain
data sources (e.g., 5GC, OAM) based on configuration, and can be hidden from
the VAL layer.
NOTE: If the Data Source is the VAL UE, then the data collection mechanism
shall reuse the SA4 mechanism based on EVEX study (TS 26.531 [3]).
# 6 ADAE layer Functional Description
## 6.1 Support for application performance analytics
This feature supports the derivation and exposure of application layer
analytics to provide insight on the operation and performance of an
application (VAL server or EAS, application session), and in particular
statistics or prediction on parameters related to e.g. VAL server number of
connections for a given time and area, VAL server rate of connection requests,
connection probability failure rates, RTT and deviations for a VAL server or
VAL UE session, packet loss rates etc. This feature also supports the
collection of service experience information from the ADAE clients (as
described in clause 8.9) to support application performance analytics.
## 6.2 Support for slice-specific application performance analytics
This feature introduces application layer analytics to provide insight on the
performance of the VAL applications when using a given network slice (from a
list of subscribed slices for the VAL customer). Such capability provides an
analytics service to a consumer who can be either the VAL server (for helping
to identify what slice it will use for its applications) or for other
consumers such as SEAL NSCE to support on providing analytics (since NSCE
doesn\'t contain an analytics engine for providing analytics on top of NWDAF
[4] /MDAS [5]).
## 6.3 Support for UE-to-UE application performance analytics
This feature supports the derivation and exposure of application layer
analytics to predict the performance of an application session among two or
more VAL UEs within a service or group. Such prediction relates to application
QoS attributes prediction for a given time horizon and area. This can be
requested by the VAL server during the session, or the VAL server can
subscribe to receive predicted application QoS downgrade indication for an
ongoing session. Such analytics will help improving the application service
experience and allow the VAL layer to pro-actively adapt to predicted
application QoS changes.
## 6.4 Support for location accuracy analytics
This feature supports application layer analytics enablement to allow a VAL
server to be notified based on analytics whether the accuracy of a location
can be met for a given application and optionally for a given UE/group route.
For example, a VAL server may request the ADAE server to provide analytics
whether the accuracy of a location for the UEs within a VAL application is
predicted to be sustainable or is expected to downgrade in a specific area or
for an expected route from location A to location B.
## 6.5 Support for service API analytics
This feature introduces service API analytics to allow a VAL server or any
other consumer (e.g. API provider) to be notified on the predicted /statistic
availability and service level for the requested service API analytics. Such
analytics may be utilized by the API provider to perform actions to avoid
service API invocation failures or other actions like throttling/rate
limitations. Also, such analytics will support the VAL server to identify
if/when to perform an API invocation request based on the API expected status
at the given area and time horizon.
## 6.6 Slice usage pattern analytics
Slice usage pattern analytics provides network slice usage pattern analytics
based on collected network slice performance and analytics, historical network
slice status, and network performance to help the analytics consumer manage
the network slice.
## 6.7 Support for edge load analytics
Edge load analytics provide insight on the operation and performance of an EDN
and in particular statistics or prediction on parameters related to:
\- the EAS / EES load for one or more EAS/EES
\- edge platform load parameters, which include the aggregated load per EDN or
per DNAI due to the edge support services and e.g., load level of edge
computational resources.
Such analytics can improve edge support services by allowing the pro-active
edge service operation changes to deal with possible edge overload scenarios.
For example, this can trigger EAS migration to a different EDN / central DN,
or pro-active EAS reselection for a target UE or group of UEs.
# 7 Identities and commonly used values
## 7.1 General
The common identities for SEAL refer to TS 23.434[2]. The following clauses
list the additional identities and commonly used values for Application Data
Analytics Enablement Service.
## 7.2 ADAE Server ID
The ADAE server ID uniquely identifies the application data analytics
enablement server, and each ADAE server ID is unique within PLMN domain.
## 7.3 ADAE client ID
The ADAE client ID uniquely identifies the application data analytics
enablement client.
## 7.4 A-ADRF ID
The A-ADRF ID uniquely identifies the application data analytics repository
function.
## 7.5 A-DCCF ID
The A-DCCF ID uniquely identifies the application data collection and
coordination function.
## 7.6 Data Producer ID
The Data Producer ID uniquely identifies the data producer / source which is
used as input for application data analytics enablement services. Data
Producer based on the analytics event, can be either a network function or a
management domain function/service or an application server or client or an
edge / cloud service.
## 7.7 ADAE service area
The ADAE service area is the area where the Application Data Analytics
Enablement server owner provides its analytics services. It is equal to the
coverage area for which analytics apply.
The ADAE service area can be expressed as a Topological Service Area (e.g. a
list of TA), a Geographical Service Area (e.g. geographical coordinates) or
both.
## 7.8 Analytics ID
The analytics ID (or analytics event ID) identifies the application layer
analytics event which corresponds to the specified ADAE analytics services.
# 8 Procedures and information flows
## 8.1 General
This clause describes the procedures and the information flows related to the
ADAE capabilities, as introduced in clause 6.
## 8.2 Procedure on support for application performance analytics
### 8.2.1 General
In this functionality, two procedures are described in more detail in clause
8.2.2 and 8.2.3 accordingly:
\- one procedure for VAL server related analytics where an example in provided
for VAL server performance,
\- one procedure for VAL session/UE related analytics.
### 8.2.2 Procedure on VAL server performance analytics
Figure 8.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure where the VAL server performance
analytics are performed based on data collected from the ongoing VAL sessions
as well as data from the DN (VAL server, DN database or networking stack at
the DN).
Pre-conditions:
1\. ADAE Client (ADAEC) is connected to ADAES.
2\. Data producers (e.g. A-ADRF, VAL Client) may be pre-configured with data
producer profiles for the data they can provide. ADAES and ADAEC have
discovered available data producers and their data producer profiles.
Figure 8.2.2-1: ADAES support for VAL server performance analytics
1\. The consumer of the ADAES analytics service sends a VAL performance
analytics subscription request to ADAES.
2\. The ADAES sends a subscription response as a positive or negative
acknowledgement to the consumer of the analytics service.
**3\. The ADAES maps the analytics event ID to a list of data collection event
identifiers, and a list of data producer IDs. Such mapping may be
preconfigured by OAM or may be determined by ADAES based on the analytics
event type / vertical type and/or data producer profile.**
**4\. The ADAES sends a data collection subscription request to the Data
Producers (at the DN side or UE side) with the respective Data Collection
Event ID and the requirement for data collection. Such data producers include
the A-ADRF, the A-DCCF, the VAL server, SEALDD server, or the VAL UEs.**
**5\. The Data Producer(s)** sends a subscription response as a positive or
negative acknowledgement **to the ADAES.**
NOTE: The ADAES acting as AF may also subscribe to NEF/SMF/PCF/NWDAF to
monitor network/UE situation or network data analytics required for the
application data analytics event.
6\. The ADAES based on subscription, may receive offline stats/data from
A-ADRF on the VAL server performance based on the analytics/data collection
event ID. Such offline data can be average/peak throughput, average/maximum
e2e delay, jitter, av. PER, availability, VAL server load, number of failed
transactions, and can be for a given area and time of the day (based on the
time/area of the request).
A session starts between the VAL server #1 and a UE (this could happen for
more than one UEs)
7\. The Data Producer at DN side, starts collecting data from the data
generating entities, e.g. real-time networking or application data (from
networking start at DN or VAL server itself), such as RTT, PER, throughput.
8a. The Data Producer sends the real-time data to the ADAES, where the data
correspond to the data collection ID or the analytics event ID for which the
ADAES subscribed.
8b. The ADAES may receive also data (periodically or if a threshold is reached
based on configuration) from the application of the UE within the ongoing
session (via ADAEC). Such data can be about the RTT, average/peak throughput,
jitter, QoE measurements (MOS, stalling events, stalling ratios, etc), QoS
profile load, VAL server load, etc.
9\. When the VAL UE session with VAL server finishes, the ADAEC notifies the
ADAEC of the completion of the reporting.
10\. The ADAES abstracts or correlates the data based on the analytics event
and the data collection configuration. Such correlation can be filtering of
data for the same metrics but with different granularities or be
combining/aggregating the data of segments of the end-to-end path (end to end
is between VAL client and server). The outcome is an
abstracted/correlated/filtered set of data.
11\. The ADAES derives application layer analytics on VAL server #1
performance, based on the analytics ID and type of request. Such analytics can
be stats or prediction for a given area/time and based on the event type for a
given network configuration.
12**.** The ADAES sends the analytics to the consumer, where these analytics
include the VAL server 1 predicted or statistic performance for a given area
and time horizon, including also the confidence level, whether offline/online
analytics were used.
### 8.2.3 Procedure on VAL session performance analytics
Figure 8.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure where the VAL session performance
analytics are performed based on data collected from the ongoing VAL sessions.
Pre-conditions:
1\. ADAEC is connected to ADAES.
2\. Data producers (e.g. A-ADRF, VAL Client) may be pre-configured with data
producer profiles for the data they can provide. ADAES and ADAEC have
discovered available data producers and their data producer profiles.
Figure 8.2.3-1: ADAES support for VAL session performance analytics
1\. The consumer of the ADAES analytics service sends a VAL performance
analytics subscription request to ADAES and provides the analytics event ID
e.g. \"VAL UE perf prediction\", the target VAL UE ID, VAL server ID/VAL
application ID, the time validity and area of the request, the required
confidence level, exposure level for providing UE analytics. If the consumer
is the VAL server, the VAL server can provide to ADAEC application data
related to the UE expected route/trajectory and VAL application traffic
schedule / expected session time.
2\. The ADAES sends a subscription response as an ACK to the consumer.
**3\. The ADAES selects the corresponding ADAEC of the VAL UE for which the
local analytics need to be performed.**
**4a. The ADAES sends a subscription request to the ADAEC with the analytics
event ID and the configuration of the reporting required (e.g., periodic,
based on threshold or event).**
**4b. The ADAEC sends a subscription response to ADAES.**
**5\. The ADAEC maps the analytics event ID to a list of data collection event
identifiers or data collected IDs at the VAL UE or other UEs within the
service and in proximity (in group-based communications). The ADAEC also
determines the data producers using the analytics event ID, target data
producer profile and optional preconfigured policies.**
**6\. The** ADAEC subscribes to the VAL clients and/or requests UE local data
based on the respective Data Collection Event ID (or the analytics event ID if
they already know the mapping). This data may come from the PDU layer of the
UE (via listening the traffic), or via VAL client of one or more UEs (if an
application consists of a group of UEs).
**A session starts between the VAL UE #1 and a VAL server.**
**7\. The** ADAEC (after being aware from the VAL client that the session
started) sends a notification to ADAES that a session started, and it could be
possible to provide real-time data analytics for VAL UE performance in the
target area.
**8\. The ADAEC starts collecting data from the corresponding data producers
based on subscription. Such data can be about the RTT, throughput, jitter, QoE
measurements, QoS profile load, etc. It can be also possible that VAL client
provides to ADAEC application data related to the UE expected route/trajectory
and VAL application traffic schedule / expected session time.**
**9\. The ADAEC** filters or correlates the data based on the analytics event
and the data collection configuration.
**10\. When the VAL UE session finishes, the ADAEC (optionally) derives VAL
session analytics to ADAES on VAL UE #1 performance, based on the analytics ID
and type of request. Such analytics (if performed at the ADAEC can be stats or
predictions on the RTT or RTT deviation, average/peak throughput, av. jitter,
QoE measurements (MOS, stalling events, buffer related events), QoS profile
load, VAL application traffic load etc. In case of prediction, a confidence
level shall be also present and a time horizon for the predicted parameters.**
**11\. The ADAEC sends the data of step 8 or the analytics of step 9 (if ADAEC
performs analytics) to the ADAES**.
12\. The ADAES derives application layer analytics on VAL session performance
(based on the data or analytics received by the ADAEC), based on the analytics
ID and type of request. Such analytics can be stats or prediction for a given
area/time and based on the event type for a given network configuration.
**Such analytics (if no analytics is performed at ADAEC) at ADAES can be stats
or predictions on the RTT or RTT deviation, average/peak throughput, av.
jitter, QoE measurements, QoS profile load, VAL application traffic load etc.
In case of prediction, a confidence level shall be also present and a time
horizon for the predicted parameters.**
**13\. The ADAES sends the analytics to the consumer, where these analytics
include the VAL UE #1 session predicted performance for a given area and time
horizon, including also the confidence level, whether offline/online analytics
were used.**

## 8.3 Procedure on support for slice-specific application performance
analytics
### 8.3.1 General
This clause describes the procedure for supporting slice-tailored application
performance analytics. The ADAES service consumer can subscribe and receive
notifications about slice specific application performance analytics events.
In case that the ADAES consumer needs information about historical data, the
procedure in 8.7.3 can be used for retrieving of slice -specific application
performance metrics data about a specific area and time window in the past.
### 8.3.2 Procedure
Figure 8.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure where the VAL server performance
analytics are performed based on data collected from the ongoing VAL sessions
as well as data from the DN (VAL server, DN database or networking stack at
DN) for a specific slice.
Pre-conditions:
1\. ADAEC is connected to ADAES.
Figure 8.3.2-1: ADAES support for slice-related performance analytics
1\. The consumer of the ADAES analytics service sends a subscription request
to ADAES and provides the analytics event ID e.g. \"slice perf prediction\",
the target S-NSSAI, DNN, NSI ID, the time validity and area of the request,
the required confidence level, whether offline and/or online analytics are
needed etc.
2\. The ADAES sends a subscription response as an ACK to the consumer.
**3\. The ADAES subscribes to the Data Sources with the respective Data
Collection Event ID and the requirement for data collection related to the
request slice(s). Such requests can be towards:**
\- OAM for providing PM data related to the requested slice / NSI.
Alternatively, if the interaction to OAM happens via NSCE layer (see TS 23.435
[6]), such subscription can be performed to NSCE (where ADAES is acting as VAL
server).
\- NWDAF for providing slice related analytics for the given area and time
horizon (indicated in step 1). Such analytics can be the slice load level
related network data analytics, or the service experience related network data
analytics for a given slice
4\. The ADAES based on subscription, receives PM data notification from OAM or
from NSCE (via OAM APIs or NSCE-S APIs)
5\. The ADAES based on subscription, receives the requested NWDAF analytics
outputs. Such analytics can be:
\- network slice or NSI statistics or predictions (clause 6.3.3 of TS 23.288
[4])
\- per slice instance service experience stats or predictions (clause 6.4.3 of
TS 23.288 [4])
6\. The ADAES can also provide analytics on the VAL session performance (based
on the procedure of clause 8.2.2 step 11 or clause 8.2.3 step 12) and filters
the analytics only for the sessions which are connected to that requested
slice for the area of interest.
7\. The ADAES abstracts or correlates the data/analytics from steps 4-6 and
provides analytics on the slice or NSI performance for the the target VAL
application/server. For example, such analytics can be about the
min/average/max predicted RTT / end to end latency for the VAL
application/server if this server uses a given slice/NSI (or for a list of
given slices) within an area of interest.
8**.** The ADAES sends the analytics to the consumer, as a slice-specific
performance analytics notification message.

performance analytics.
### 8.4.2 Procedure
Figure 8.4.2-1 illustrates the procedure where the VAL session performance
analytics are performed based on data collected from the ongoing VAL UE-to-UE
sessions.
Pre-conditions:
1\. ADAECs are connected to ADAES.
Figure 8.4.2-1: ADAES support for VAL session performance analytics
> 1\. The consumer of the ADAES analytics service sends a subscription request
> to ADAES and provides the analytics event ID e.g. \"VAL UE to UE session
> prediction\", the target VAL UE ID or group of UE IDs, the VAL session /
> service ID, the time validity and area of the request, the required
> confidence level, exposure level for providing UE to UE analytics. Such
> request can also include whether the analytics notification shall be
> periodic or based on an expected application QoS change (in that case also
> the thresholds can be provided at the request)
>
> 2\. The ADAES sends a subscription response as an ACK to the consumer.
>
> **3\. The ADAES selects the corresponding ADAEC #1 of the VAL UE 1 where the
> session performance analytics need to be performed. Such UE can be for
> example a capable and authorized UE from the involved VAL UEs within the
> service or group, e.g. a group lead.**
>
> **4\. The ADAES sends a UE to UE analytics request to the ADAEC #1 with the
> analytics event ID and the configuration of the reporting required (e.g.,
> periodic, based on threshold or event). Such request also includes the
> application QoS attributes to be analyzed (latency, jitter, PER,..)A session
> starts between the VAL UE #1 and a VAL UE #2 (or more VAL UEs).**
>
> **5\. The ADAEC #1 starts collecting data from the corresponding VAL UE(s)
> based on the request. Such data can be about the latency, throughput,
> jitter, QoE measurements, PQI load, etc. The data can be collected by ADAEC
> #1 from other ADAECs via ADAE-C interface, or from the VAL clients (VAL
> client to VAL client interaction is out of scope).**
>
> **6\. The ADAEC** either detects or predicts an application QoS change
> (depending on the authorization of ADAEC to perform analytics). Such change
> can be for example an application QoS downgrade related to the UE-to-UE
> session latency, or the PER/channel losses higher than a predefined
> threshold, for a given time horizon with a certain confidence level.
>
> **7\. The ADAEC sends the analytics to the ADAES in a UE-to-UE analytics
> response message**.
>
> 8\. The ADAES based on the received response, confirms/verifies the
> analytics received or provides analytics (in case that data were reported)
> for the UE-to-UE session. Such analytics can be about predicting the
> application QoS change for the UE-to-UE session.
>
> 9**.** The ADAES sends the derived analytics notification to the consumer.

## 8.6 Procedure for supporting service API analytics
### 8.6.1 General
This clause describes the procedure for supporting service API analytics. Such
analytics can be for one or more service APIs for a service produced by one or
more service producers within the 5GS or enablement layer or the DN side
(e.g., application server).
### 8.6.2 Procedure
Figure 8.6.2-1 illustrates the procedure for service API analytics enablement
solution.
Pre-conditions:
1\. ADAES is registered to CCF
Figure 8.6.2 -1: Service API analytics procedure
1\. The subscribing entity (VAL server / API invoker, API provider) sends a
service API event subscription request to the ADAE server to receive analytics
for one or more service APIs.
2\. Upon receiving the event subscription request from the subscribing entity,
the ADAE server checks for the relevant authorization for the event
subscription. If the authorization is successful, the ADAE server stores the
subscription information.
3\. The ADAE server sends a service API event subscription response indicating
successful subscription
4\. Upon sending the subscription response, the ADAE server requests to
collect API logs to be used to derive analytics and triggers API invocation
log pull request towards the CAPIF core function. The API invocation log fetch
request indicates the API (or list of APIs) for which logs are required. Based
on the ADAE server deployment, this can be a Query service API log request
which is performed via CAPIF_Auditing API as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8].
5\. The CCF authorizes the request and fetches the API logs from the storage
unit. CCF then sends the requested information to the ADAE server via a query
service API log response
6\. The ADAES may also request service API historical analytics /data from
A-ADRF for the corresponding service APIs.
7\. Based on the request, the ADAES receives historical analytics/data for the
service APIs.
8\. The ADAE server authorizes and anonymizes the API logs (if not performed
by CCF) and abstracts based on exposure level. The exposure level can be known
based on pre-configuration by the OAM or based on the subscription and type of
invoker. The ADAE server then derives analytics on the target service API(s)
based on the logs received from the CCF. Such analytics are predictions/stats
for the API status based on the analytics event.
9\. The ADAE server sends the analytics as event notifications to all the
subscribing entities that have subscribed for the event matching the criteria.
If a notification reception information is available as part of the
subscribing entity event subscription, then the notification reception
information is used by the ADAE server to send event notifications to the
subscribing entity.
### 8.6.3 Information flows
#### 8.6.3.1 General
The following information flows are specified for service API analytics based
on 8.6.2.
#### 8.6.3.2 Service API event subscription request

## 8.8 Procedure for supporting edge load analytics
### 8.8.1 General
This clause describes two procedures (covering both subscribe-notify and
request-response models in 8.8.2.1 and 8.8.2.2 respectively) for supporting
edge load analytics. where the edge analytics are performed based on data
collected from the EDN (EAS and/or EES) and A-ADRF.
### 8.8.2 Procedure
#### 8.8.2.1 Subscribe-notify model
Figure 8.8.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure for edge load analytics enablement
solution.
Pre-conditions:
1\. ADAES has discovered the APIs to access the edge services at EDN.
2\. ADAES has subscribed to OAM and NWDAF for receiving management and DN
performance analytics respectively.
3\. Data producers (e.g. A-ADRF, EAS, EES) may be pre-configured with data
producer profiles (as in Table 8.2.4.8-1) for the data they can provide. ADAES
and ADAEC have discovered available data producers and their data producer
profiles.
Figure 8.8.2.1-1: ADAES support for edge analytics
1\. The consumer of the ADAES analytics service sends an edge analytics
subscription request to ADAES.
2\. The ADAES sends an edge analytics subscription response as an ACK to the
analytics consumer.
**3\. The ADAES maps the analytics event ID to a list of data collection event
identifiers, and a list of data producer IDs. Such mapping may be
preconfigured by OAM or may be determined by ADAES based on the analytics
event ID and/or data producer profile (Table 8.2.4.8-1). Such Data Producers
can be EASs onboarded to EDN, EESs, A-ADRF, as well as MEC Platform
services.**
**4\. The ADAES sends a subscription request to the Data Producers (EASs
onboarded to EDN, EESs, A-ADRF, ADAEC) or the A-DCCF with the respective Data
Collection Event ID and the requirement for data collection.**
**5\. The Data Producers (e.g., EASs onboarded to EDN, EESs, A-ADRF, ADAEC) or
the A-DCCF send a subscription response as a positive or negative
acknowledgement to the ADAES.**
**6\. The ADAES based on subscription receive offline stats/data on the edge
DN load based on the analytics/data collection event ID from A-ADRF. Such
stats can be about the load in terms of number of EAS or EES connections for a
given area or time window, or the average edge computational resource usage or
usage ratio based on the EDN total resource availability, EDN overload/high
load indication events, probability of EAS/EES unavailability due to high
load, etc.**
**7\. The Data Producers at the edge start collecting data from the data
generating entities. Such data can be measurements or analytics based on the
data source/producer, as follows:**
\- from OAM or EAS/ASP (for EAS load info): Per EAS/EES computational resource
load, number of connections per EES/EAS
\- from N6 endpoint: N6 load
\- from 5GC / NWDAF: DN performance analytics
\- from OAM / MDAS: UPF load analytics (per DNAI)
\- from MEC platform services (e.g., RNIS): per cell radio conditions / load
for all cells within EDN coverage
NOTE 1: How the ADAES obtains the EAS load information from EAS/ASP is up to
implementation.
NOTE 2: Steps 6 and 7 are not necessarily sequential and can be performed in
parallel or in different order.
**8\. If in step 4 ADAES sent a subscription request to ADAEC as Data
Producer, data collection is initiated by ADAEC from UE data generating
entities.**
NOTE 3: Data collection at the UE reuses the SA4 mechanism based on EVEX study
(TS 26.531 [3]).
**9\. The edge Data Producers (targets of the subscription requests in step 4)
send the data to the ADAES (based on step 7 measurements or analytics) as a
data notification message. Such data can be about the load in terms of number
of EAS or EES connections for a given area or time window, or the average edge
computational resource usage or usage ratio based on the EDN total resource
availability, EDN overload/high load indication events, probability of EAS/EES
unavailability due to high load, etc.**
**10\. ADAEC sends data (periodically or if a threshold is reached based on
configuration) about the edge load as collected at the UE, e.g. in terms of
number of AC or EEC connections for a given UE in a given time window, number
of edge service sessions, etc.**
11\. The ADAES derives edge analytics on EDN / DNAI load or per EES/EAS load,
based on the analytics ID and type of request. The analytics are derived based
on the performance analytics received per DN or load analytics per DNAI/UPF;
as well as considering measurements on the computational or RAN resource load
or number of connections for the EES/EASs which are active at the EDN.
12**.** The ADAES sends the edge analytics to the consumer, based on the
request and the derived analytics in step 9. Such analytics indicate a
prediction of the EDN load considering inputs from both 5GS as well as from
edge platform services. Such prediction can also be in form of a
recommendation for triggering an EAS relocation to a different platform.
#### 8.8.2.2 Request-response model
Figure 8.8.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the analytics consumer to
request analytics data of the application server(s) from the ADAE server.
Figure 8.8.2.2-1: ADAES support for edge analytics
1\. The analytics consumer sends a request message to the ADAE server to
receive analytics data for one or more application servers. The request
message includes the identity of the analytics consumer, security
credential(s) for authorization and verification, identity of all the
application server for which analytics data is requested, type of analytics
data, time duration since when analytics data is required.
2\. Upon receiving the request, the ADAE server authenticates and authorizes
the analytics consumer. If the analytics consumer is authorized, the ADAE
server may get the analytics data by performing step 3 to 9 of clause 8.8.2.1.
The ADAE server sends a response message including the statistical and
predictive analytics data of the application servers for the requested
duration period (if the time duration is available).

## 8.9 Procedure on Service experience to support application performance
analytics
### 8.9.1 General
When Application server (like VAL server) is not available to provide
analytics data due to overload or any other reasons or the application server
is not providing the required quality of service experience at the UE side,
the ADAE server may need to rely on alternate information sources like the
application clients (like VAL clients) that provide the visibility on
application service status. ADAE server can use this information from the
clients alone, for the predictions and share with the consumer of the
analytics. This clause provides a mechanism for the ADAE client to send
service experience report to the ADAE server. ADAE server upon receiving the
service experience information from the UE side entities can use it for
predictions of application performance analytics.
NOTE: In this solution, ADAE server uses data collection and reporting
mechanisms as defined in 3GPP TS 26.531 [3], where the ADAE client acts as a
UE application and ADAE server acts as an AF from Application service
provider.
Editor's note: If the data collection mechanisms, necessary to meet the
requirements to specify solution#5 of the TR 23.700-36, are not supported by
3GPP TS 26.531 [3], such mechanisms will be defined in this version of the
specification based on the conclusions in TR 23.700-36.
### 8.9.2 Procedure
#### 8.9.2.1 Push service experience information
The ADAE client determines the service experience information based on
information received from the VAL client. The service experience information
includes application specific performance measurements like end-to-end
response time, connection bandwidth, request rate, server availability time,
etc. On request VAL client or any other trigger conditions, the ADAE client
sends the service experience report about a VAL server to the ADAE server
using the mechanism defined in 3GPP TS 26.531 [3]. The information elements as
defined in clause 8.9.3.1 are used by ADAE client to send the request and
clause 8.9.3.2 are used by ADAE server to send the response.
For direct reporting, if data reporting session is not available, the ADAE
client creates data reporting session as specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS
26.531 [3]. Once data reporting session is available, the ADAE client (acting
as a UE client) sends reports to ADAE server using direct reporting method as
specified in clause 5.5 of 3GPP TS 26.531 [3].
The ADAE server may take further actions based on the analysis of the report
as shared by the ADAE client. A service experience information from certain
UEs, can trigger the ADAE server to fetch further service experience
information other UEs. Use the service experience information report from
other UEs, to determine/predict analytics.
\- If most of the UE side entities report a similar service experience, then
it could be the application server problem across globally.
\- If only some UEs report a bad service experience, the problem could be
localized among a group of UEs.
\- If the bad service experience from only a UE, the problem is localized to
the UE.
#### 8.9.2.2 Pull service experience information
The procedure can be initiated by the ADAE server upon receiving a service
experience from an ADAE client, to fetch service experience information other
ADAE clients or upon receiving VAL server performance analytics request from
application service provider (application server) or any other event that
requires the ADAE server to determine the service experience data.
Figure 8.9.2.2-1: Pull service experience information from UE
1\. The ADAE server sends Pull service experience request to the ADAE client.
The request contains identity of the specific VAL server and VAL service ID,
for which the service experience report is required, as mentioned in Table
8.9.3.3-1.
2\. Upon receiving the Pull service experience request from the ADAE server,
the ADAE client may take user consent to send the report if the user consent
is not available already.
3\. The ADAE client sends the Pull service experience response to the ADAE
server. The ADAE client instructs the Direct Data Collection Client to
prioritise immediate delivery of a UE data report to the Data Collection AF as
specified in clause 5.5 of 3GPP TS 26.531 [3]. The service experience contains
parameters as specified in Table 8.9.3.4-1.
4\. The ADAE server uses the service experience report for derivation of VAL
server performance analytics.
#### 8.9.2.3 Service experience information based on triggers
The ADAE server configures triggers to the ADAE client to send the service
experience report using the mechanism defined in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 26.531
[3].
The procedure can be initiated by the ADAE server upon receiving VAL server
performance analytics request from application service provider (application
server). The information elements as defined in clause 8.9.3.5 are used by
ADAE server to send the request and clause 8.9.3.6 are used by ADAE client to
send the response.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Deployment scenarios
# A.1 General
This clause provides the different deployment models for ADAE services. There
could be three deployment options:
\- ADAES can be deployed at a centralized cloud platform, and collects data
from multiple EDNs
\- ADAES can be deployed at the edge platform
\- Coordinated ADAES deployment, where multiple ADAE services are deployed in
edge or central clouds. Such deployment allows for local-global analytics for
system wide optimization
# A.2 Deployment model #1: Cloud-deployed ADAES
In this deployment, as shown in Figure A.2-1, the ADAES is centrally located
and can provide analytics services to different consumers including, edge
servers, VAL servers, as well as to other SEAL servers (e.g. NSCE).
The statistics/predictions that the ADAES provides are applicable to the ADAES
service area, which can be provided for the entire PLMN.
Figure A.2-1: Cloud deployed ADAES
# A.3 Deployment model #2 Edge-deployed ADAES
In this deployment, as shown in Figure A.3-1, the ADAES is located at the EDN
and provides analytics services to the EAS and EES at the edge platform. ADAES
can be deployed by the ECSP or the MNO to provide analytics for the
application or edge parameters.
The statistics/predictions that the edge deployed ADAES are applicable to the
ADAES service areas (as shown in the example in Fig A.2-2), which are
equivalent to the EES/EAS service areas. Such analytics can be about the edge
load or the EAS performance and can be provided to consumers within EDN.
In this deployment the interaction between edge deployed ADAES is possible for
exchanging edge/application analytics for application mobility scenarios or
for cases when ADAES #1 and #2 service areas have overlapping coverage.
Figure A.3-1: Edge deployed ADAES
# A.4 Deployment model #3: Coordinated ADAES deployment
In this deployment, multiple ADAESs can be located at different EDNs/DNs and
can be deployed by the same ADAE provider. Such coordinated deployments allow
the local -- global analytics derivation (which may be needed for improving
the analytics confidence level). The centrally deployed ADAES can also act as
ADAE analytics aggregator entity and configures the edge deployed ADAES to
derive analytics on different sub-areas.
One example is the use of analytics for the EDN#1 or EDN#2 load which will
help predicting the VAL server performance at a centrally located ADAES. Such
deployment is also applicable for ML-based analytics methods, like supervised
learning, where the centrally located ADAES acts as ML model training entity,
and the edge located ADAESs can act as ML model inference entities (using edge
data to improve the prediction accuracy).
The statistics/predictions that the edge deployed ADAES correspond to the
ADAES service areas (as shown in the example in Fig A.4-1), which is
equivalent to the EES/EAS service areas. The central ADAE server covers all
PLMN area and is used to coordinate or jointly perform analytics with the
distributed ADAES. Such analytics services can be provided to consumers at the
central DN, like the VAL servers or SEAL services or even at the PLMN side
(e.g. NWDAF consuming service experience analytics).
