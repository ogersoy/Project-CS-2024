\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as

scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document studies the potential enhancements in CAPIF and
application enablement frameworks (e.g. SEAL, EDGEAPP, vertical enabler
layers) to support the subscriber-aware northbound API access (SNA), whose
requirements are specified in TS 22.261 [2].
This study takes into consideration the existing works for CAPIF (3GPP TS
23.222 [3]), SEAL (3GPP TS 23.434 [4]), and EDGEAPP (3GPP TS 23.558 [5]).
Any potential enhancements to security procedures related to CAPIF and
application enablement frameworks (e.g. EDGEAPP, SEAL, vertical enabler
layers) to support SNA are not in the scope of this study.

# 4 Key issues
## 4.1 Key Issue #1: UE-originated API invocation
### 4.1.1 Description
The UE-originated API invocation scenario corresponds to the following
requirement specified in TS 22.261 [2]:
\- The 5G system shall be able to provide a UE with secure access to APIs
(e.g. triggered by an application that is not visible to the 5G system), by
authenticating and authorizing the UE.
In this scenario, the application on the UE invokes the northbound APIs. The
scenario is illustrated in figure 4.1.1-1.
From CAPIF point of view, the application on the UE in this scenario plays the
role of the API invoker, as defined in TS 23.222 [3].
Figure 4.1.1-1: UE-originated API invocation
Open issues:
1) Whether the existing CAPIF functional model is sufficient for the UE-
originated API invocation.
a) If the existing CAPIF functional model is insufficient, how it must be
modified to accommodate for the API invoker in the UE.
## 4.2 Key Issue #2: AF-originated API invocation
### 4.2.1 Description
In the AF-originated API invocation scenario, the AF invokes the northbound
APIs, and the application on the UE consumes the service from the AF. The
scenario is illustrated in figure 4.2.1-1.
Figure 4.2.1-1: AF-originated API invocation
Open issues:
1) Whether the existing CAPIF functional model is sufficient for the AF-
originated API invocation.
a) If the existing CAPIF functional model is insufficient, how it should be
updated.
2) Study the business relationship between the user (UE), the AF and the
northbound API provider.
## 4.3 Key Issue #3: Providing and revoking resource owner consent upon
invoking APIs
### 4.3.1 Description
Invocation of some northbound APIs may require obtaining resource owner
consent (e.g. API to retrieve the location of the UE).
In the SNA context, it is for further study how to obtain resource owner
consent when the API invocation is related to the resource owner (e.g. the
user).
In addition, the system should ensure that there are mechanisms for the
resource owner to revoke the resource owner consent provided previously for
the API invocation.
In an API provider domain, several AEFs can expose resources of the resource
owner and it is possible that the AEFs themselves may interact with each other
to utilize the resources. For a nested API invocation, the API invoker
performs an API invocation towards the AEF1 which also results in AEF1 to
perform another API invocation to AEF2. This nested API interactions may
require multiple queries to obtain resource owner consent information from
resource owner to support API invocations towards the AEF1 and AEF2. It is
beneficial for the resource owner to reduce the resource owner consent inquiry
so that the resource owner does not have to provide the consent twice for the
nested API invocations. It is for further study how to reduce such resource
owner consent inquiries for nested API invocations.
Open issues:
1) Whether and how CAPIF functions can determine the resource owner upon API
invocation.
2) Whether and how CAPIF can support obtaining resource owner consent from
resource owner.
3) Whether and how CAPIF can support revoking resource owner consent by the
resource owner.
4) Whether and how CAPIF can reduce resource owner consent inquiries for a
nested API invocation.
NOTE: This document studies the high-level architecture to solve this issue.
The detailed procedure for providing the resource owner consent will be
specified in SA3.
## 4.4 Key Issue #4: Discovery of target API information
### 4.4.1 Description
As per the below requirement from 3GPP TS 22.261 [2] (clause 6.10.2), the
third party needs to be provided with information to locate the target APIs in
the network.
\- provide a third-party with information to identify networks and APIs on
those networks.
An AF may serve UEs that belong to different PLMNs. When the AF is not aware
of the PLMN provider of the UEs and has to discover the service API in
relation to such UEs, then it is not clear how to discover the service APIs.
How the AF can determine the right AEF instance, which is exposing the
required Northbound API for which the AF wants to consume that Northbound API
with the UE(s) information.
Open Issue:
\- Whether and how to support discovery of the target Service API information
in CAPIF with respect to UE(s) information, especially when:
\- AF is serving UEs belonging to multiple PLMNs; and
\- There are multiple instances of the AEF within a PLMN.
# 5 Architectural requirements
## 5.1 General requirements
[AR-5.1-a] The confidentiality of the UE\'s external identity (e.g. MSISDN)
shall be preserved during the API invocation supported by CAPIF.
[AR-5.1-b] The CAPIF shall support the authentication of the resource owner.
[AR-5.1-c] The CAPIF shall enable the resource owner(s) to provide and revoke
resource owner consent.

## 6.1 Solution #1: Business relationship in SNA
### 6.1.1 Solution description
This solution addresses the key issue #2 with regard to the business
relationship between the user (UE), the AF and the northbound API provider in
the AF-originated API invocation scenario. Considering the business
relationship, the resource owner (which is a UE-side entity) is a new entity
that has not been in the existing CAPIF business relationship, thus the
business relationship should be updated to include the resource owner.
Figure 6.1.1-1 shows the typical business relationship in SNA. This business
relationship can be applied to both AF- and UE-originated API invocation
scenario, as the API invoker in figure 6.1.1-1 can either be an application on
the UE or the AF.
Figure 6.1.1-1: Business relationships in SNA
The API invoker has service agreement with a CAPIF provider, and the API
provider provides APIs associated with the resource owner. The CAPIF provider
and the API provider can be part of the same organization (e.g. PLMN
operator), as described in 3GPP TS 23.222 [3] clause 5. When the CAPIF
provider is a PLMN operator, the resource owner may be a subscriber of the
PLMN.
NOTE: In the current release, both the CAPIF provider and the API provider
should belong to the same organization (e.g., PLMN operator).
### 6.1.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enhances the existing CAPIF business relationship by introducing
the resource owner, which is viable.
## 6.2 Solution #2: Functional model description for SNA
### 6.2.1 Solution description
#### 6.2.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issues #1, #2 and #3 with regard to the
functional model to support the UE- and AF-originated API invocation and to
support obtaining and revoking resource owner consent from the resource owner
client. As the resource owner client is a new entity for CAPIF, the functional
model for the CAPIF should be updated including the resource owner client and
authorization function.
#### 6.2.1.2 Functional model
##### 6.2.1.2.1 Functional model description for the CAPIF with SNA
enhancements
Figure 6.2.1.2.1-1 shows the reference point based functional model for the
CAPIF with enhancements to support SNA.
Figure 6.2.1.2.1-1: Functional model for the CAPIF authorization with SNA
enhancements
The resource owner client(s) are application clients used by end-users or
subscribers of the API provider domain\'s service provider.
The resource owner client(s) interacts with the authorization function via
CAPIF-8. The resource owner communicates with the authorization function to
provide and revoke resource owner consent. The resource owner interactions are
supported via a resource owner client, which is a client-side entity.
Triggering the resource owner client to provide authorization is not supported
via CAPIFâ€‘8.
NOTE 1: CAPIF-8 details will be addressed by SA3.
The API exposing function (e.g NEF) acts as a resource owner consent
enforcement point as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and interacts with the
authorization function via CAPIF-9. The API exposing function can retrieve the
resource owner consent parameters from.the authorization function.
The API invoker interacts with authorization function via CAPIF-10/CAPIF-10e.
NOTE 2: Security aspects including specification of the authorisation
procedures are to be decided in SA3.
##### 6.2.1.2.2 Functional model description for the CAPIF with SNA
enhancements to support 3^rd^ party API provider
In the current release, 3^rd^ party API providers (i.e., API providers outside
the PLMN trust domain) are not supported.
#### 6.2.1.3 Deployment models
##### 6.2.1.3.1 General
This clause provides the deployment models for the functional model specified
in clause 6.2.1.2.
##### 6.2.1.3.2 Deployment of the authorization function within the CAPIF core
function
Figure 6.2.1.3.2-1 shows a deployment model for PLMN providing the API
provider. In this deployment model, the authorization function resides in the
CAPIF core function. Those functions are in a single node depicted by a red
box.
Figure 6.2.1.3.2-1: Deployment of the authorization function within the CAPIF
core function
##### 6.2.1.3.3 Collocated deployment of authorization function and CAPIF core
function
The CAPIF provider and API provider can be the same organization (e.g. PLMN
operator). In such cases, the authorization function of the API provider
domain and the CCF is collocated in the same node to provide authorization
services (e.g. authorization grant and access token).
Figure 6.2.1.3.2-1 illustrates the deployment where the authorization function
and the CAPIF core function are collocated in a single node depicted by a red
box. The deployment of other CAPIF functionalities are not shown in this
illustration.
Figure 6.2.1.3.3-1: Collocated deployment of Authorization function and CAPIF
core function in a single node
A single node (denoted by red box) provides the CAPIF APIs and the
Authorization APIs towards the API invokers in this deployment case. API
invokers are served by the node for the authentication and authorization (for
both API invoker related authorization and resource owner related
authorization) requirements.
##### 6.2.1.3.4 Deployment of the enhanced CAPIF by different organizations
within the PLMN trust domain
The CAPIF provider and API provider can be different organizations (e.g. PLMN
operator can be CAPIF provider and an MVNO can be the API provider) within the
PLMN trust domain.
Figure 6.2.1.3.4-1 illustrates the deployment where the CAPIF entities are
deployed by different organizations. Nodes (denoted by red boxes) identify one
example of deployment.
Figure 6.2.1.3.4-1: Deployment of the enhanced CAPIF by different
organizations within the PLMN trust domain
The node providing CAPIF core function is deployed by the CAPIF provider (e.g.
PLMN operator). The functions of the API provider domain functions can be
deployed in multiple nodes. Example: The AEF, APF and AMF can reside in one
node and the Authorization function can reside in another node. It is also
possible that all functions of the API provider domain can reside in one node.
Typically this type of deployment is where the authentication and
authorization for subscribers/users of API provider (i.e. MVNO) are managed by
the API provider itself.
If API invokers wish to utilize the API provider users\' resources via the
service API exposed by the API provider, then API invoker is required to
obtain the resource owner authorization from API provider\'s authorization
function and obtain the API invoker\'s authorization from the CAPIF
provider\'s CCF.
### 6.2.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enhances the existing CAPIF functional model by introducing the
resource owner client and the authorization function, which is viable.
## 6.3 Solution #3: Obtaining resource owner consent upon service API
invocation
### 6.3.1 Solution description
#### 6.3.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issues #1, #2 and #3 with regard to obtaining
resource owner consent in the UE- and AF-originated API invocation scenarios.
Acting as the resource owner consent enforcement point, the AEF judges whether
the invoked service API requires the resource owner consent and whether a
valid resource owner consent is already included in the service API
invocation. If the resource owner consent is required and a valid resource
owner consent is not included in the API invocation, the AEF in collaboration
with the resource owner client and the authorization function obtains a valid
resource owner consent before the service API execution is continued. For the
interaction between the authorization function and the resource owner client,
the resource owner registration may optionally be performed prior to the
service API invocation.
NOTE: Whether the resource owner registration is required and used for the
purpose of obtaining resource owner authorization is to be decided by SA3.
Clause 6.3.1.2 shows the procedure for resource owner registration and clause
6.3.1.3 shows the procedure for obtaining resource owner consent.
#### 6.3.1.2 Resource owner registration
Figure 6.3.1.2-1 shows the procedure for resource owner registration.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The resource owner client is authorised to access the authorization
function; and
2\. The resource owner client has information for accessing the authorization
function.
Figure 6.3.1.2-1: Procedure for resource owner registration
1\. The resource owner client sends resource owner registration request to the
authorization function, including the resource owner identity (e.g. GPSI) and
security credentials.
2\. The authorization function initiates the verification procedure and
validates the resource owner registration request.
3\. The resource owner registration function sends resource owner registration
response.
#### 6.3.1.3 Obtaining resource owner consent
Figure 6.3.1.3-1 shows the procedure to obtain resource owner consent upon
service API invocation.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The resource owner client is registered to the authorization function and
can be accessed by the API exposing function.
Figure 6.3.1.3-1: Procedure for obtaining resource owner consent upon service
API invocation
1\. The API invoker sends service API invocation request to the API exposing
function via CAPIF-2.
2\. The API exposing function determine if the resource owner consent
verification is required to execute the service API. If the resource owner
consent verification is not required for the API invocation, the steps 3-5
will be skipped.
NOTE: The API exposing function determines if the resource owner consent
verification is required based on implemented API logic.
The API exposing function identifies the resource owner client in 3GPP network
context by one of the following processes:
\- If the service API invocation indicates the resource owner client by GPSI,
the API exposing function identifies the resource owner client by retrieving
the resource owner information from the authorization function, which has
received the resource owner information in resource owner registration, as
shown in clause 6.3.1.2.
\- If the service API invocation indicates the resource owner client by UE (IP
or Ethernet) address, the API exposing function identifies the resource owner
client by interacting with BSF, as specified in TS 29.513 [6].
\- If the service API invocation indicates the resource owner client by
external group identifier, the API exposing function identifies the individual
resource owner clients by interacting with HSS/UDM, as specified in TS 23.682
[7].
\- If the service API invocation indicates the resource owner client by \"any
UE\" identification, the API exposing function regards all the available
resource owner clients as the target resource owner clients.
3\. The API exposing function obtains the resource owner consent from the
resource owner client. The result of the resource owner consent response may
be stored in the API exposing function.
NOTE: The detailed procedure to obtain the resource owner consent and manage
such resource owner consent information will be specified in SA3.
4\. If the API invocation is allowed, the process for service API execution is
continued. If the API invocation is denied, the service API execution is
rejected.
5\. The API exposing function sends service API invocation response to the API
invoker based on the result of the service API execution.
#### 6.3.1.4 Updating resource owner consent
The resource owner client may update resource owner consent anytime to allow
or deny future API invocation.
NOTE: The detailed procedure to update the resource owner consent will be
specified in SA3.
### 6.3.2 Solution evaluation
This solution addresses KI#3. This solution addresses the case where API
invoker has access token given by the CAPIF core function (as per clause 8.11
of TS 23.222 [3]) to perform service API invocation, but without any
authorization grant by the resource owner before the service API invocation.
NOTE: The API exposing function may need a solution to contact UE through
firewall in Step 3 of clause 6.3.1.2.
## 6.4 Solution #4: API invoker obtaining resource owner consent
### 6.4.1 Solution description
This solution addresses the key issues #1, #2 and #3 with regard to obtaining
resource owner consent in the UE- and AF-originated API invocation scenarios.
CAPIF may authorize the API invoker to invoke the service API based on the
resource owner consent slightly before the API invocation. The procedures to
obtain the resource owner consent may reuse well-known authorization
procedures such as OAuth 2.0 [9].
Clause 6.4.1.1 shows the procedure for obtaining resource owner consent in a
near real-time manner.
#### 6.4.1.1 API invoker obtaining resource owner consent prior to the service
API invocation
Figure 6.4.1.1-1 shows the procedure to obtain resource owner consent prior to
the service API invocation, which is used in the near real-time consent
scenario.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The resource owner can communicate with the API invoker.
Figure 6.4.1.1-1: Procedure for API invoker obtaining resource owner consent
prior to the service API invocation
1\. The API invoker requests authorization grant and access token to invoke
the service API.
NOTE: The detailed procedure to obtain resource owner consent and provide an
access token is studied in SA3.
2\. The API invoker sends service API invocation request to the API exposing
function with the access token received in step 1.
### 6.4.2 Solution evaluation
This solution addresses KI#3. Unlike Solution #3, this solution requires that
the API invoker get authorized to invoke the service API by the resource owner
before sending the service API invocation request. The procedure to obtain the
authorization grant and access token before the service API invocation is
compliant with the ordinary OAuth 2.0 flow and is a viable solution to be
considered.
## 6.5 Solution #5: UE-originated API invocation within CAPIF
### 6.5.1 Solution description
KI#1 describes the scenario of UE application client (AC) invokes 3GPP
northbound APIs (e.g. NEF location API). In figure 6.5.1-1, the AC plays the
role of the API invoker, and triggers a number of service operations with CCF
and AEF (e.g. onboarding, security, API discovery).
Figure 6.5.1-1: Overview of CAPIF operations
The existing CAPIF model and procedures for UE-originated API invocation with
CAPIF may be used but it is not so efficient since UE may be installed with
many application clients (e.g. 100-200 apps). To reduce the number of CAPIF
interactions per UE, a CAPIF client agent in the UE can be used as a common
API invoker. Such CAPIF client agent executes the onboarding, authentication
and authorization for security, service API discovery (discovered result can
be re-used by all ACs), CAPIF event subscription with CCF.
NOTE 1: The interactions between ACs and CAPIF client agent (API invoker) in
the UE for achieving per application granularity operation is out of scope.
NOTE 2: Security aspects including specification of the authentication and
authorisation procedures for UE-originated API invocation with the CAPIF
client agent are to be decided in SA3.
In short, the CAPIF client agent (as an application in the UE) is seen as an
API invoker (see figure 6.5.1-2).
Figure 6.5.1-2: CAPIF client agent functionality in the UE
NOTE: Reference point detail between AC and CAPIF client agent is out of 3GPP
scope.
### 6.5.2 Solution evaluation
This solution addresses KI#1. It introduces an option to have a common API
invoker (i.e. CAPIF client agent) for the UE so that the signalling over CAPIF
reference points can be optimized. Without enforcement in the UE, i.e. updates
to the UE, the application developer can choose whether to use this CAPIF
client agent. Therefore, from CAPIF\'s perspective, the CAPIF client agent is
seen as a normal API invoker, so there is no impact on the current CAPIF
architecture.
## 6.6 Solution #6: Discover a proper AEF with owner information
### 6.6.1 Solution description
The API provider hosts one or more service APIs and has a service API
arrangement with CAPIF provider to offer the service APIs to the API invoker,
as described in 3GPP TS 23.222 [3]. A CAPIF provider may have business
relationships with multiple API providers (e.g. MNOs).
The AF knows UE IP address from the Application traffic. If the AF wants to
contact with an API exposing function (AEF) provided by MNO but does not know
which MNO the UE belongs to, the AF can utilize the information provided by
Regional Internet Registry (RIR). e.g. Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre
(APNIC) is responsible for providing allocation and administration services to
Asia-Pacific\'s Internet service providers (ISPs) and Internet users. IP
\"whois\" service can be used to retrieve IP address related information, for
instance, with input of IP address 223.167.255.255 in
[https://wq.apnic.net/apnic-bin/whois.pl]{.underline} it gives the following
result including the owner for such IP address (only partial result is listed
here for relevant info):

Noting that such interaction with IP address administrative authority is out
of the scope of 3GPP.
Once the AF knows which MNO it should contact for the API invocation related
to a UE, the AF queries the CAPIF core function (CCF) with required API
provider name (e.g. China Mobile Beijing) and CCF responds with the AEF
information matching the required API provider name. The CCF knows the API
provider name either via API management function triggered Registration
procedure for the whole API provider domain functions or via the API publish
function triggered service API information publish procedure for the AEF
offered API(s). The impact for CAPIF procedures is illustrated in figure
6.6.1-1, and tables 6.6.1-1, table 6.6.1-2 and 6.6.1-3 describe the
information flow impact with highlighted IEs.

Table 6.6.1-3: Service API discover request
+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | Information element | Status | Description | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | API invoker identity | M | Identity information of the | | information | | API invoker discovering | | | | service APIs | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | Query information | M | Criteria for discovering | | | | matching service APIs (e.g. | | | | service API type, Serving | | | | Area Information | | | | (optional), preferred AEF | | | | location (optional), | | | | **required API provider | | | | name (optional)** , | | | | interfaces, protocols) | | | | | | | | (see NOTE) | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | NOTE: It should be possible | | | | to discover all the service | | | | APIs. | | | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+
The API provider name can be shared between CCFs over CAPIF-6/6e reference
point and the interconnection service API discovery may also include the
required API provider name as query parameter.
Alternatively, to reduce the burden on API invoker side, API invoker may
include subscriber IP address in the service API discover request in step 6
above and CCF uses implementation specific means (e.g. whois) to resolve the
subscriber IP address to its owner information (e.g. API provider name) and
then find the matching service API information with the owner information. CCF
may also receive from the API provider, the mapping information between the
subscriber IP address range information and the AEF information. For example,
a NEF provider may share the IP address range information related to its
subscribers that NEF provides the service to, while publishing the APIs at
CCF.
### 6.6.2 Solution evaluation
This solution addresses KI#4, it enables the API invoker to discover a proper
AEF with API provider name or subscriber IP address for invoking an API
related to UE. It is assumed that all AEF instances provided by the API
provider know their owner\'s information and API invoker knows subscriber IP
address. This solution is a viable CAPIF solution to be considered.
## 6.7 Solution #7: Reducing resource owner consent inquiry in a nested API
invocation
### 6.7.1 Solution description
This solution addresses the key issue #3 with regard to reduce resource owner
consent inquiries for a nested API invocation, in which **the first API
invocation towards the API exposing function 1 triggers this API exposing
function to request another API invocation towards the API exposing function
2, which is in the same API provider domain that the API exposing function
1**. Some service APIs may require invoking another service APIs. For example,
if the API invoker invokes SEAL locationInfoRetrieval API, the location
management server (acting as an API exposing server for the API invoker and as
an API invoker for the NEF) may invoke NEF API to retrieve UE location
information from 5GC. This solution suggests how the CAPIF entities obtain the
resource owner consent if more than one API exposing function is involved in
the procedure, specifically when these API exposing functions are in the same
trust domain.
#### 6.7.1.1 Reducing resource owner consent inquiry in a nested API
invocation
Figure 6.7.1.1-1 shows the procedure to obtain resource owner consent in a
nested API invocation, in which an API exposing function receiving the service
API invocation request interacts with another API exposing function to provide
the service.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The resource owner can communicate with the API invoker.
2\. The API exposing functions 1 and 2 are in the same trust domain.
Figure 6.7.1.1-1: Procedure for obtaining resource owner consent in a nested
API invocation
1\. The API invoker requests authorization grant and access token to invoke
the service API exposed by the API exposing function 1.
NOTE: This step may use either the existing procedure to obtain authorization
to access service API specified in TS 23.222 [3] or the procedure that
involves the resource owner client to get resource owner consent. For the
latter case, the detailed procedure to obtain resource owner consent and
provide an access token is studied in SA3.
2\. The API invoker sends service API invocation request to the API exposing
function 1 with the access token received in step 1.
3\. Based on the service API invocation request, the API exposing function 1
decides to invoke another service API exposed by the API exposing function 2.
4\. The API exposing function 1, acting as an API invoker, obtains the access
token to access the service API exposed by the API exposing function 2.
NOTE: The existing mechanisms such as OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [10] can be
used to obtain the access token for the nested API invocation. The detailed
procedure for authorization for nested API invocations in this step will be
studied in SA3
5\. The API invoker sends service API invocation request to the API exposing
function with the access token received in step 1.
### 6.7.2 Solution evaluation
This solution clarifies how to obtain the resource owner consent in a nested
API invocation. The step 4 in the clause 6.7.1.1 outlines a specific case
where the API exposing functions 1 and 2 are in the same trust domain and the
CAPIF can provide authorization for nested API invocation. The detailed
security aspects for this case will be studied in SA3.

### 7.3.2 Overall evaluation of solutions for Key Issue #1
Key Issue #1 is an issue about the CAPIF functional model to support the UE-
originated API invocation. Three solutions are proposed in this document.
Solutions #3 and #4 propose procedures to support providing and revoking the
resource owner consent. These solutions have no normative impact regarding the
Key Issue #1.
Solution #5 proposes that a CAPIF client agent be introduced to reduce the
number of interactions between the UE and the CAPIF entities. This solution is
proposed specifically for the UE-originated API invocation scenario but does
not impact the existing CAPIF architecture.
For Key Issue #1, the security aspects including specification of the
authentication and authorisation procedures for UE-originated API invocation
within CAPIF are to be decided in SA3.
### 7.3.3 Overall evaluation of solutions for Key Issue #2
Key Issue #2 is an issue about the CAPIF functional model to support the AF-
originated API invocation. Two solutions are proposed in this document.
Solutions #3 and #4 propose procedures to support providing and revoking the
resource owner consent. These solutions have no normative impact regarding the
Key Issue #2.
### 7.3.4 Overall evaluation of solutions for Key Issue #3
Key Issue #3 is an issue about providing and revoking resource owner consent
upon invoking APIs. Three solutions are proposed in this document.
Solution #3 proposes procedures to support providing and revoking the resource
owner consent. The procedure in the clause 6.3.1.3 assumes that the resource
owner consent is, if needed, provided after the service API invocation request
from the API invoker. To enable the interaction between the resource owner
client and the authorization function after the service API invocation request
from the API invoker, the resource owner registration may optionally be
performed beforehand. Even if the resource owner client has performed the
resource owner registration, the API exposing function may need a solution to
contact UE through firewall.
Solution #4 also proposes a procedure to support providing and revoking the
resource owner consent. Unlike Solution #3, this solution assumes that the API
invoker get authorized to invoke the service API by the resource owner before
sending the service API invocation request. The procedure to obtain the
authorization grant and access token before the service API invocation is
compliant with the ordinary OAuth 2.0 flow and is a viable solution to be
considered.
Solution #7 proposes a procedure to reduce the resource owner consent
inquiries in a nested API invocation. This solution suggests that the existing
mechanisms such as OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [10] can be used when obtaining
the access token for the nested API invocation. The detailed procedure will be
studied in SA3.
Whether and how security related mechanisms for these solutions can be
specified should be decided by SA3.
### 7.3.5 Overall evaluation of solutions for Key Issue #4
Key Issue #4 is an issue about discovery of target API information. One
solution is proposed in this document.
Solution #6 proposes a procedure to enable the API invoker to discover a
proper AEF with API provider name or subscriber IP address for invoking an API
related to UE. The CCF receives the API provider name and subscriber IP
address range information from the API provider to discover the proper AEF.
This solution supports proper API discovery in cases where the AF is serving
UE belonging to multiple PLMNs and there are multiple instances of the AEF
within a PLMN.
The solutions above will be considered in the normative work.
# 8 Conclusions
This technical report fulfills the objectives of the study on application
enablement aspects for subscriber-aware northbound API access. The results
from the study will be considered for the follow-up normative work in Release
18 as follows:
1\. The architectural requirements (clause 5) will be considered the basis for
the technical specification;
2\. The architecture solutions including the business relationship (clause
6.1) and the functional models (clause 6.2) will be considered the
enhancements to the existing CAPIF specification;
3\. The individual solutions (clause 6) will be considered the candidate
solutions with necessary enhancements as appropriate, according to the overall
evaluation (clause 7).
SA3 feedback will be considered for progressing the architecture related
solutions (e.g. enhanced CAPIF functional models and deployment models) to the
normative phase.
###### ## * *Annex A (informative): Use case examples
# A.1 AF-originated API invocation (Gaming)
## A.1.1 General
This use case is an example of AF-originated API invocation with a gaming
application. In this use case, the end user (also a subscriber of the MNO)
allows the AF (game provider\'s server) to invoke the QoS API (offered by MNO)
to modify the QoS of the end user.
## A.1.2 Pre-conditions
An end user (also a subscriber of the MNO) is playing a time-sensitive game
using a game client application on the end user's UE communicating with a game
provider\'s server. The end user wants to have a high-quality and low-latency
communication for better service experience, so the game server (AF or API
invoker) tries to invoke the QoS API provided by the 5GC of the MNO to change
the end user\'s QoS according to the request from the game client application
on the end user\'s UE. Changing the QoS may affect the charging rate to the
end user, so the game server needs to get authorized to invoke the API by the
end user.
## A.1.3 Service flows
1\. The game server triggers an authorization procedure of the QoS API
provider where the MNO subscriber (end user) is asked to confirm whether the
game server can invoke QoS API with extra charge.
2\. The MNO subscriber (end user) authorizes the game server to apply the QoS
change with extra charge.
## A.1.4 Post-conditions
After receiving this authorization as per the authorization procedure, the
game server invokes the QoS API.
NOTE: This is an example of real-time or near real-time request of
authorization, but the game server may also use the authorization information
given by the MNO subscriber in the past authorization procedure.
# A.2 UE-originated API invocation (Location tracking)
## A.2.1 General
This use case is an example of UE-originated API invocation with a location
tracking application. In this use case, the end user (also a subscriber of the
MNO) on UE X allows the end user on UE Y to invoke an API to track the
location of the end user on UE X.
## A.2.2 Pre-conditions
A tracking application enables the user on UE Y to track the location of a
user on UE X. An API Provider AP provides location APIs for the end users on
UE X and UE Y, and the tracking application on the UE utilizes the location
APIs to provide the tracking functionality.
## A.2.3 Service flows
1\. Tracking application of UE Y triggers the AP to obtain consent from end
user on UE X.
2\. Consent is obtained from the end user on UE X via an authorization
procedure of the AP allowing "Tracking application on UE Y\" to invoke the
location API for UE X exposed by AP (UE-originated API invocation as shown in
Figure 4.1.1-1).
## A.2.4 Post-conditions
After receiving the authorization as per the authorization procedure of the
AP, the tracking application on UE Y invokes the location API of AP for
obtaining location of user on UE X.
