# Introduction
The use of 5GS to support MC services (i.e., MCPTT defined in 3GPP TS 23.379
[6], MCVideo defined in 3GPP TS 23.281 [4], MCData defined in 3GPP TS 23.282
[5]) including common application plane and signalling plane entities is
specified in the present document.
Each MC service supports several types of communications amongst the users
(e.g. group communication, peer to peer communication). There are several
general functions and entities (e.g. configuration, identity) which are used
by the MC services. The general functional architecture to support MC services
utilizes aspects of the IMS architecture specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [2].
An MC service UE in the 5GS context obtains access to a MC service via 3GPP
access (i.e., E-UTRA, 5G NR), wireless non-3GPP access (e.g. WLAN or
Satellite) and/or wireline access using the 5GS architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.501 [7]. Certain MC service functions such as dispatch and
administrative functions can be supported using MC service UEs with 3GPP
access and non-3GPP wireless/wireline access. External applications usage of
MC services can be enabled via 3GPP access and/or non-3GPP access.
NOTE: Dispatch consoles and devices used by MC service administrators are
considered as MC service UEs to support MC services.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the use of the 5G System (5GS) considering
common functional architecture, procedures and information flows needed to
support mission critical services encompassing the common services core
architecture.
The corresponding service requirements applied in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], 3GPP TS
22.179 [11], 3GPP TS 22.280 [12], 3GPP TS 22.281 [13] and 3GPP TS 22.282 [14]
also apply here.
The corresponding MC service specific procedures and information flows are
defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [6], 3GPP TS 23.281[4], and 3GPP TS 23.282 [5].
The present document is applicable primarily to mission critical services
using 3GPP access (5G NR and/or E-UTRA) and non-3GPP access (WLAN, Satellite
and/or wireline) based on the 5GC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7],
3GPP TS 23.247 [15] and 3GPP TS 23.304 [17].
The common functional architecture to support mission critical services can be
used for public safety applications and for general commercial applications
e.g. utility companies and railways.

# 4 MC system resource requirements
## 4.1 Multiple Access
### 4.1.1 General
5GS provides simultaneous integration of different access types 3GPP and
non-3GPP (wireline and wireless), defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7]. Accordingly,
this enables the MC service UE to be used under both stationary and non-
stationary conditions.
With the convergence of multiple access technologies in 5GS, service features
can be assigned agnostically without taking the access type into account for
the MC service user.
### 4.1.2 Requirements
With the use of 5GS, MC services shall be available via 3GPP access as well as
via non-3GPP access. To enable access to the MC system, the use of the various
access types shall be authorized by the 5GC. The simultaneous use of different
access types (Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting) is defined in
3GPP TS 23.501 [7] and its characteristics are subject to respective operators
policy.
## 4.2 Session connectivity
### 4.2.1 General
The access from 5GS to the MC service environment takes place via the Data
Network (DN) in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7]. A Data Network Name (DNN)
as part of the 5GS user profile allows access to the Data Network with up to 8
connectivity sessions (PDU sessions) each with up to 64 communication flows
(QoS flows). Different data networks require different DNNs.
### 4.2.2 Requirements
For MC service UEs who only utilize 5GS, a single DNN may be used for:
\- for the SIP-1 reference point;
\- for the HTTP-1 reference point; and
\- for the CSC-1 reference point.
The DNN shall be made available to the MC service UE either via UE
(pre)configuration or via initial UE configuration on a per HPLMN and
optionally also per VPLMN basis.
NOTE 1: The Data Network access can also be shared with the \"IMS\" access
taking into account the communication flow limits.
The MC service UE may exploit secondary authentication/authorization by a DN-
AAA server during the establishment of session connectivity as specified in
3GPP TS 23.501 [7] using the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to
access the DN identified by the MC service DNN. If required, DN access
credentials shall be made available to the MC service UE via initial MC
service UE configuration on a per DNN basis.
The DN connection to the DNN defined within the present subclause can be of
PDU session type \"IPv4\", \"IPv6\", \"IPv4v6\", Ethernet or Unstructured (see
3GPP TS 23.501 [7]). If a DN connection to an DNN defined within the present
subclause is of type \"IPv4v6\" then the MC service client shall use
configuration data to determine whether to use IPv4 or IPv6.
NOTE 2: In accordance to 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], the use of PDU session type
Ethernet and Unstructured has limited support in the Session and Service
Continuity context.
For MC service UEs who utilize EPS and 5GS 3GPP TS 23.280 [3] clause 5.2.7
applies.
## 4.3 QoS characteristics
### 4.3.1 General
In 5GS, quality of service is enforced at QoS flow level and corresponding
packets are classified and marked with an identifier in accordance with 3GPP
TS 23.501 [7]. Every QoS flow is characterized by a QoS profile provided by
the 5GC, and can be used for all connectivity types (PDU sessions) in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7].
5G QoS characteristics, standardized or non-standardized, are indicated
through the 5QI value in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7]. Standardized 5QI
values have a one-to-one mapping to a standardized combination of 5G QoS
characteristics and non-standardized 5QI values allows a dynamic assignment of
QoS parameter values.
NOTE 1: The use of non-standardized 5QI values can be subject for
harmonisation within the individual user area.
The QoS parameter Allocation Retentions Priority (ARP) determines the priority
level, the pre-emption capability and the pre-emption vulnerability of each
QoS flow. ARP priority level defines the relative importance of a resource
request to allow in deciding whether a new QoS Flow may be accepted or needs
to be rejected in the case of resource limitations in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.501 [7].
NOTE 2: The use of ARP is regulated by the individual MC service.
The use of Multicast Broadcast Services (MBS) for MC services shall apply QoS
handling as determined by 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
### 4.3.2 QoS requirements for general purposes
The selection, deployment, initiation, and termination of QoS signalling and
resource allocation shall consider the QoS mechanisms described in 3GPP TS
23.501 [7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10], 3GPP TS 23.503 [9] and 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]
for MBS.
MC system as well as MC service UE may share one DNN using multiple QoS flows
for the settlement of MC services, application plane and signalling plane.
For the transport of SIP-1 reference point signalling, the standardized 5QI
value of 69 in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7] shall be used.
For the transport of HTTP-1 reference point signalling, the standardized 5QI
value of 8 in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7] or better shall be used.
MC services shall use standardized 5QI values or may use non-standardized 5QI
values in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7].
When the MC system utilizes IMS services, at least one QoS flow shall be
associated for IMS signalling. The generic mechanisms for interaction between
QoS and session signalling applicable for the use of IMS in the 5GS context
are defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [2].
### 4.3.3 QoS requirements for Mission Critical Push to Talk

The requirements listed here apply for the use of 5GS and replace the
corresponding requirements in 3GPP TS 23.379 [6].
#### 4.3.3.2 5QI values for MCPTT
The MCPTT system may use the N5 reference point or Rx reference point for
direct interaction with 5GS PCF to determine the required QoS flow parameters.
Alternatively, the MCPTT system may use the N33 reference point for indirect
interaction with 5GS NEF.
For the use of MBS, the MCPTT system may interact with the PCF/MB-SMF/NEF/MBSF
to provide the corresponding QoS information.
A QoS flow (unicast or multicast/broadcast) for an MCPTT voice call and
MCPTT-4/MCPTT-9 reference point signalling shall utilize 5QI value 65 in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
#### 4.3.3.3 Use of priorities
The QoS flow (unicast or multicast/broadcast) for an MCPTT emergency call
shall have highest priority level among MCPTT call types. The QoS flow
(unicast or multicast/broadcast) for MCPTT imminent peril call shall have
higher priority level than one for a MCPTT call.
Depending on operators\' policy, the MCPTT system may be able to request
modification of the priority (ARP) of an established QoS flow (unicast or
multicast/broadcast).
NOTE: Operators\' policy takes into account regional/national requirements.
### 4.3.4 QoS requirements for Mission Critical Video
#### 4.3.4.1 General
The requirements listed here apply for the use of 5GS and replace the
corresponding requirements in 3GPP TS 23.281 [4].
#### 4.3.4.2 5QI values for MCVideo
The MCVideo system may use the N5 reference point or Rx reference point for
direct interaction with 5GS PCF to determine the required QoS flow parameters.
Alternatively, the MCVideo system may use the N33 reference point for indirect
interaction with 5GS NEF.
For the use of MBS, the MCVideo system may interact with the PCF/MB-
SMF/NEF/MBSF to provide the corresponding QoS information.
Video media and control of the video media may use independent QoS flows
(unicast or multicast/broadcast) and utilizes 5QI values depending on the
MCVideo mode of the MCVideo call/session, as per table 4.3.4.2-1.
Table 4.3.4.2-1: MCVideo mode associated 5QI values
* * *
MCVideo mode 5QI value utilized\ (in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7])

* * *
For transmission and reception control signalling, the 5QI value 69 is
recommended in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
#### 4.3.4.3 Use of priorities
The MCVideo audio media and video media may transmit over dedicated QoS flows
(unicast or multicast/broadcast), in which case the priority for each QoS flow
(unicast or multicast/broadcast) is determined by the operator policy.
MCVideo services shall be able to use ARP pre-emption capability and the pre-
emption vulnerability of each individual QoS flow (unicast or
multicast/broadcast) according to operators\' policy. Depending on operators\'
policy, the MCVideo system may be able to request modification of the priority
(ARP) of an established QoS flow (unicast or multicast/broadcast).
NOTE: Operator policy takes into account regional/national requirements.

NOTE: Operators\' policy takes into account regional/national requirements.
## 4.4 Network Slicing
### 4.4.1 General
Network slicing in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7] can be used for several
purposes such as to separate MC service users, UEs as well as applications in
accordance with the various QoS requirements independent from 3GPP or non-3GPP
access.
The corresponding slice information identifies a network slice across the 5G
core, access network and the UE. In accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7]
standardized and non-standardized slice selection information can be used.
### 4.4.2 Requirements
For the use of network slicing in the MC service context, the following
minimum requirements in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7] shall be
considered:
One network slice shall be assigned per PDU session and may benefit from a
dedicated transmission resource allocation.
The network slicing for MC services follows the concepts defined in 3GPP TS
23.501 [7]. The Initial MC service UE configuration shall contain at least one
network slice identity (S-NSSAI). Those S-NSSAIs shall be considered as part
of the Default Configured S-NSSAI(s), and should be utilized by the MC service
UE to form the Requested S-NSSAI(s) at registration as specified in 3GPP TS
23.501 [7].
If the MC service UE requests a slice which is subject to Network Slice-
Specific Authentication and Authorization, the corresponding aspects as well
as the MC service UE behaviour are to be followed as described in 3GPP TS
23.501 [7], and 3GPP TS 23.502 [10]. The corresponding credentials per S-NSSAI
can be configured in the initial MC service UE configuration or UE
(pre-)configuration.
The use of network slices corresponding to non-standardized NSSAIs across PLMN
boundaries requires harmonisation in order to guarantee their availability.
Initial MC service UE configuration data may contain information for the PDU
session to be used for each MC service (including among others the S-NSSAI).
## 4.5 Use of public and non-public networks
### 4.5.1 General
MC services are service agnostic with respect to 5GS, i.e., the available
service options are identical in both public networks (i.e. PLMN) and non-
public networks (NPNs). A non-public network (NPN) can be deployed in
organization defined premises and the 5G network services are provided to a
defined set of users or organizations in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7].
### 4.5.2 Requirements
An MC system shall be able to utilize connectivity from public 5GS networks
and non-public 5GS networks in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7].
## 4.6 Migration
### 4.6.1 General
For the migration of an MC service user the general assumptions in 3GPP TS
23.280 [3] clause 5.2.9.1 are applied.
### 4.6.2 Public network utilization
Migrated MC service users should utilize the home PLMN of the partner MC
system to access MC services in the partner MC system, however, utilizing the
home PLMN of the primary MC system is not precluded.
NOTE 1: The above recommendation ensures the security policy of the partner MC
system and is not compromised, the expected 5QIs are used on the 5GS to ensure
that serviceâ€‘level delay requirements are consistently met (which are
especially at risk when the home PLMN of the primary MC system and the home
PLMN of the partner MC system are far apart from a geographical point of
view).
NOTE 2: Whether the home PLMN of partner MC systems or the home PLMN of the
primary MC system is used to access MC services in partner MC systems is left
to business agreements between MC service providers and is outside the scope
of the present document.
NOTE 3: The MC service user\'s MCData message store will not be available when
using the home PLMN of the partner MC system to access MC services in
migration.
The MC service user profile enabled for migration shall be provisioned with
configuration data that specifies which PLMNs supporting 5GS are to be
selected when migrating to another MC system.
If the home PLMN of a partner MC system is different from the home PLMN of the
primary MC system (i.e. migrating MC service users roam into the home PLMN of
the partner MC system), then:
\- 5GSâ€‘level roaming is required between the home PLMN of the primary MC
system and home PLMN of the partner MC system;
\- the home PLMN of the partner MC system needs to enable local break-out for
the DNNs in accordance to subclause 4.2.2 that identify the DNs of the partner
MC system; and
\- the 5GS user profile of the home PLMN of the primary MC system used by the
MC service users who are allowed to migrate to the partner MC system needs to
be provisioned with, and local break-out enabled for, the DNNs proposed in
subclause 4.2.2 that identify the DNs of the partner MC system.
If the home PLMN of the partner MC system and the home PLMN of the primary MC
system are the same (i.e. migrating MC service users continue to use the home
PLMN of their primary MC system), then:
\- the 5GS user profile of the home PLMN of the primary MC system utilized by
the MC service users who are allowed to migrate to the partner MC system needs
to be provisioned with the DNNs specified in subclause 4.2.2 that identify the
DNs of the partner MC system.
### 4.6.3 Non-Public network utilization
When the NPN is a PNI-NPN as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], the requirements
in clause 4.6.2 are applicable.
When the NPN is a SNPN as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], the requirements
may be different in the following options.
Option 1: The SNPN utilized by the primary MC system and the SNPN utilized by
the partner MC system are the same (i.e., migrating MC service users continue
to use the SNPN of their primary MC system.)
\- the 5GS user profile of the SNPN of the primary MC system utilized by the
MC service users who are allowed to migrate to the partner MC system needs to
be provisioned with the DNNs specified in subclause 4.2.2 that identify the
DNs of the partner MC system.
Option 2: The partner MC system and the primary MC system utilize different
SNPNs.
\- the migrated MC service users shall utilize the SNPN of the partner MC
system to access MC service in the partner MC system.
\- the 5GS user profile of the SNPN of the partner MC system used by the MC
service users who are allowed to migrate to the partner MC system needs to be
provisioned with the DNNs proposed in subclause 4.2.2 that identify the DNs of
the partner MC system.
\- the MC service UE shall have credentials to access the SNPN of the partner
MC system. UE may access using credentials owned by a Credentials Holder
separate from the SNPN of the partner MC system.
Option 3: The partner MC system utilizes the PLMN and the primary MC system
utilize SNPN.
\- the migrated MC service users should utilize the PLMN of the partner MC
system to access MC service in the partner MC system.
\- 5GSâ€‘level SNPN and PLMN interworking is required between the SNPN of the
primary MC system and PLMN of the partner MC system if the migrated MC service
users utilize the SNPN of the primary MC system to access MC service in the
partner MC system.
\- the 5GS user profile of the PLMN of the partner MC system used by the MC
service users who are allowed to migrate to the partner MC system needs to be
provisioned with the DNNs proposed in subclause 4.2.2 that identify the DNs of
the partner MC system.
Option 4: The partner MC system utilizes the SNPN and the primary MC system
utilize PLMN.
\- the migrated MC service users should utilize the SNPN of the partner MC
system to access MC service in the partner MC system.
\- 5GSâ€‘level SNPN and PLMN interworking is required between the PLMN of the
primary MC system and SNPN of the partner MC system if the migrated MC service
users utilize the PLMN of the primary MC system to access MC service in the
partner MC system.
\- the MC service UE shall have credentials to access the SNPN of the partner
MC system. UE may access using credentials owned by a Credentials Holder
separate from the SNPN of the partner MC system.
\- the 5GS user profile of the SNPN of the partner MC system used by the MC
service users who are allowed to migrate to the partner MC system needs to be
provisioned with the DNNs proposed in subclause 4.2.2 that identify the DNs of
the partner MC system.
## 4.7 Architectural aspects of MC services using MBS
### 4.7.1 General
The main purpose of 5G Multicast-Broadcast Service (MBS) use by mission
critical services is to provide efficient downlink delivery of user traffic in
group calls and communications. The architectural figures in this clause are
aligned with the 5GS architecture for MBS shown in Figure 5.1-2 of 3GPP TS
23.247 [15], which identifies both mandatory and optional functional entities
and interfaces, in reference point representation, available for use by the MC
services.
Multicast and broadcast communication services in 5G for MC group
communications rely on the creation and establishment of MBS sessions to
deliver user data in downlink. Shared and individual delivery from the MC
service server to multiple MC users (i.e., users affiliated to a certain MC
group) is supported either as point-to-point or point-to-multipoint over the
radio. The MBS sessions are either broadcast or multicast type and consist of
one or multiple QoS flows for different service requirements. For the
broadcast MBS session or local MBS session, the MBS service area is configured
with the MBS session.
NOTE 1: Support of MBS and specific session types is an implementation choice.
Within this arrangement, the MC service server decides whether to create
broadcast or multicast MBS sessions to be associated with certain MC groups.
The 5GC adaptively decides whether to deliver the MBS traffic from the MB-UPF
in the form of shared delivery or individual delivery, where the latter is
applicable to multicast MBS sessions only. The NG-RAN decides to utilize
point-to-point or point-to-multipoint delivery methods applicable for shared
delivery only. MBS provides reliability enhancements and minimizes loss of
information, e.g., due to mobility and handover.
MBS group scheduling mechanism enables simultaneous reception of MBS and
unicast user traffic by the MC service UEs. The UEs can receive broadcast MBS
sessions irrespective of their RRC state (i.e., connected, inactive or idle)
and multicast sessions only in RRCâ€‘CONNECTED and RRC-INACTIVE state.
The following capabilities (non-exhaustive list) provided by MBS could be used
by MC service servers as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]:
\- MBS session creation;
\- MBS session update;
\- MBS session release;
\- MBS session ID allocation;
\- Transparent MBS Data forwarding;
> \- Dynamic PCC control for MBS session;
>
> \- UE\'s MBS assistance information provision.
### 4.7.2 General on-network architecture for use of MBS by MC services
Figure 4.7.2-1 presents a high-level architectural view of mission critical
services when using MBS. The shown architecture is consistent with 3GPP TS
23.501 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
MC services use MBS control plane capabilities by initiating access via Nmb13,
Nmb10 or N33. MBS user plane capabilities can be accessed via N6mb or Nmb8. MC
service servers can initiate access to MBS PCC capabilities supported by PCF
via N5 or N33. If the MC service server and the 5GS are in different trust
domains with respect to MBS, N33 needs to be used to gain access to the MBS
control plane capabilities and the PCC capabilities.
The 5G-GC1 reference point, which exists between the MC service client and the
MC service server, is used for application layer signalling for the control of
mission critical service delivery over MBS session. The functions of this
reference point are defined in clause 7.3.
Figure 4.7.2-1: Architectural view of a mission critical system when using MBS
NOTE 1: Support of interfaces associated to 5GS optional entities (e.g. MBSF,
MBSTF, NEF) is necessary only if features enabled by these entities are
supported.
NOTE 2: When the MC service server uses MBS, the N5 reference point is used as
described in the present document.

services when using MBS without the presence or use of the optional entities
(MBSF, MBSTF and NEF) and their associated interfaces. The shown architecture
is a particularization of the general architecture shown in figure 4.7.3.1-1.
MC services use MBS control plane capabilities by initiating access via Nmb13.
MBS user plane capabilities can be accessed via N6mb. MC service servers can
initiate access to MBS PCC capabilities supported by PCF via N5.
Figure 4.7.3.1-1: Architectural view of a mission critical system when using
MBS without optional MBS interfaces
#### 4.7.3.2 Instantiation without MBSF / MBSTF and associated interfaces
Figure 4.7.3.2-1 presents a high-level architectural view of mission critical
services when using MBS without the presence or use of the optional entities
MBSF and MBSTF and their associated interfaces. The shown architecture is a
particularization of the general architecture shown in figure 4.7.2-1.
MC services use MBS control plane capabilities by initiating access via Nmb13
or N33. MBS user plane capabilities can be accessed via N6mb. MC service
servers can initiate access to MBS PCC capabilities supported by PCF via N5 or
N33. If the MC service server and the 5GS are in different trust domains with
respect to MBS, N33 needs to be used to gain access to the MBS control plane
capabilities and the PCC capabilities.

services when using MBS without the presence or use of the optional entity NEF
and its associated interfaces. The shown architecture is a particularization
of the general architecture shown in figure 4.7.2-1.
MC services use MBS control plane capabilities by initiating access via Nmb13
or Nmb10. MBS user plane capabilities can be accessed via N6mb or Nmb8. MC
service servers can initiate access to MBS PCC capabililities supported by PCF
via N5.

MBS without optional NEF entity and its associated interfaces
### 4.7.4 Service layerâ€‘based interworking between eMBMS and MBS
Figure 4.7.4-1 presents a high-level architectural view of mission critical
services interworking between eMBMS and MBS at the service layer. The shown
architecture is consistent with 3GPP TS 23.247 [15], subclauses 5.2, 6.8 and
configurations 2 and 3 in Annex A.
The interworking between eMBMS and MBS for mission critical operation is
enabled by the Joint BM-SC, MBSF and MBSTF functional entity. MC services can
use control plane capabilities by accessing the Joint entity directly via
MB2-C or Nmb10 or indirectly (using NEF) via N33+Nmb5. User plane traffic
delivery is supported via MB2-U or Nmb8. If the MC service server and the 5GS
are in different trust domains with respect to MBS, N33 needs to be used to
gain access to the MBS PCC capabilities.
Figure 4.7.4-1: Service layerâ€‘based mission critical interworking between
eMBMS and MBS
NOTE: Support of interfaces associated to 5GS optional entities (e.g., NEF) is
necessary only if features enabled by these entities are supported.
### 4.7.5 Application layer based interworking between eMBMS and MBS
Figure 4.7.5-1 presents a high-level architectural view of mission critical
services interworking between eMBMS and MBS at the application layer. The
shown architecture does not use the MBSF/MBSTF entities defined in 3GPP TS
23.247 [15] and is inclusive of configuration 1 in Annex A of 3GPP TS 23.247
[15].
MC services initiate access to control plane capabilities via MB2-C (for
eMBMS) and via Nmb13 or N33 (for MBS). User plane capabilities can be accessed
via MB2-U (for eMBMS) and via N6mb (for MBS). MC service servers can initiate
access to PCC capabilities via the Rx interface (for the PCRF in the EPS) and
via the N5 or N33 interfaces (for the PCF in the 5GS). If the MC service
server and the 5GS are in different trust domains with respect to MBS, N33
needs to be used to gain access to the MBS control plane capabilities and the
PCC capabilities.
Figure 4.7.5-1: Application layerâ€‘based mission critical interworking between
eMBMS and MBS
NOTE: Support of interfaces associated to 5GS optional entities (e.g., NEF) is
necessary only if features enabled by these entities are supported.
### 4.7.6 General architecture showcasing use of MBS by UE for MC services
Figure 4.7.6-1 presents a high-level system architecture that shows how the MC
service UEs support the delivery of mission critical services through MBS.
Figure 4.7.6-2 shows the functional model used by the UE, highlighting the
conceptual MC MBS API used for information transfer within the UE. The shown
system architecture and functional model are analogous to the models described
in 3GPP TS 23.479 [20] and consistent with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7] and 3GPP TS
23.247 [15].
Figure 4.7.6-1: System architecture for MC MBS systems
NOTE: The shown architecture does not consider MBS User Services, i.e.,
signalling with MBSF/MBSTF, which is described in 3GPP TS 26.502 [21].
The conceptual MC MBS API resides between the MC service client and the
conceptual MC MBS user agent.
Figure 4.7.6-2: Functional model highlighting the MC MBS API
The MC service client uses information received from the MC service server
through MC signalling (e.g., announcements) and through application-level
signalling (e.g., mappings of MBS sessions and MBS subchannels to specific MC
service groups) to communicate with the conceptual MC MBS user agent via the
conceptual MC MBS API, in order to establish and update the proper
communication context between the entities. Multiple MC service clients can be
supported by the MC MBS user agent. The conceptual MC MBS user agent presents
data and information received from the UE\'s lower layers to each MC service
client according to the most recently established communication context. The
functionalities of the MC service client and of the MC MBS user agent are
described in clauses 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.479 [20]. The information
flows and procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.479 [20] apply, with the
following clarifications:
\- References to 4G \"eMBMS\" are understood to be references to 5G \"MBS\";
\- Unless used as in \"multicast IP address\", the stand-alone term
\"multicast\" is understood as \"broadcast or multicast\"; and
\- References to \"SAI\" are understood to be references to \"MBS service
areas\", e.g., cell id, tracking area id, MBS frequency selection area id, as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.274 [15].
## 4.8 Use of 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay
### 4.8.1 General
The MC service shall support the capabilities for 5G ProSe UE-to-network
relay. For this matter, 5G ProSe Layer-2 and 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-network
relaying techniques can be utilized, as described in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17]. The
5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network relaying technique may be done with or without
the support of N3IWF, as described in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17].
A 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay supporting MC service UE provides means of
connectivity and relaying of MC traffic to remote MC service UE(s). For this
matter, the 5G ProSe UE-to-network Relay Discovery service allows the MC
service remote UE to discover a potential UE-to-network relay UE supporting MC
service in its proximity as described in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17]. Upon its
discovery, the 5G ProSe Direct UE-to-network Relay Communication functionality
is utilized to achieve communication to provide the MC service remote UE
access to 5GS, and relay MC traffic via the UE-to-network relay UE over the NR
PC5 reference point.
### 4.8.2 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay service requirements
In order to enable 5G ProSe UE-to-network relaying capabilities -- whether
based on Layer-3 or Layer-2 UE-to-network relaying techniques, the MC system
provides the appropriate parameters and configurations to the MC service
UE(s).
As defined in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17], among these parameters are: Relay Service
Code(s) (RSCs) which can be associated to a certain MC service group, User
Info, ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and ProSe Group IP multicast address. Moreover,
the MC service group ID is resolved to the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and ProSe
Group IP multicast address, which are utilized within the 5G ProSe Relay
Discovery and 5G ProSe Direct Communication procedures, as described in 3GPP
TS 23.304 [17]. Furthermore, the RSCs are utilized to restrict the necessary
UE-to-network relay service and related procedures within members of a certain
MC service group.
Moreover, in case of 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-network relay with the support of
N3IWF, the UE-to-network relay is provisioned with policies and parameters,
among others suitable RSC(s), in order to support N3IWF access, as defined in
3GPP TS 23.304 [17].
## 4.9 EPS interworking
### 4.9.1 General
Network deployments of MC services over 5GS may support interworking with EPS.
EPS interworking aspects in 5G systems are specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7],
3GPP TS 23.502 [10], and 3GPP TS 23.503 [9].
### 4.9.2 Requirements
For MC services over a 5G system with EPS interworking, inter-system mobility
between 5GC and EPC/E-UTRAN of MC service UEs shall be supported by the
network based on the capabilities and procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.501
[7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10], and 3GPP TS 23.503 [9].
For the case that seamless session continuity is required for MC services,
e.g. for MCPTT services, EPS interworking with N26 (interface between AMF in
5GC and MME in EPC) is required for inter-system change.
The MC system should be able to subscribe/unsubscribe to notification
capabilities of specific events from the network related to EPS interworking.
Thereby, the MC system can identify whether an MC service UE is registered on
5GS or EPS.
# 5 MC system functional model
## 5.1 General
The functional model for the MC services architecture is defined as a series
of planes to allow for the breakdown of the architectural description. Each
plane is expected to operate in an independent manner, providing services to
the connected planes as and when requested by the connected plane, and
requesting services from other planes as required.
In this context, each plane manages on its own behalf:
a) Use of identities: Each plane is responsible for the privacy of that
plane\'s own identities; and
b) Security for that plane: It does not preclude a plane requesting security
services from another plane, but that is a decision made within the plane, as
to whether to use offered security services or mechanisms within the plane
itself.
NOTE: Terminology such as client and server are not meant to imply specific
physical implementation of a functional entity.
## 5.2 Description of the planes
The following planes are identified:
a) application plane: The application plane provides all of the services (e.g.
call control, floor control, video control, data control, conferencing of
media, provision of tones an announcements) required by the user together with
the necessary functions to support MC service. It uses the services of the
signalling control plane to support those requirements.
b) signalling control plane: The signalling control plane provides the
necessary signalling support to establish the association of users involved in
an MC service, such as an MCPTT call or other type of MC services. The
signalling control plane also offers access to and control of services across
MC services. The signalling control plane uses the services of session
connectivity.
The corresponding session connectivity supporting these planes are defined for
the use of 5GS within 3GPP TS 23.501 [7]. The associated resource control to
support these planes is defined within 3GPP TS 23.503 [9].
## 5.3 Common functional model description
### 5.3.1 On-network functional model
Each MC service can be represented by an application plane functional model.
The corresponding functional model across MC services may be similar but is
described by the individual functional entities and reference points that
belong to that MC service. Within the application plane for an MC service, a
common set of functions as well as reference points is shared across MC
services and is referred as the common services core.
Figure 5.3.1-1 shows the common functional model for the application plane for
an MC system using 5GS.
Figure 5.3.1-1: Common functional model for application plane for an MC system
The common services core functions and reference points shown in figure
5.3.1-1 are shared across each MC service.
Figure 5.3.1-2 shows the common functional model for the signalling control
plane using 5GS.
Figure 5.3.1-2: Common functional model for signalling control plane
In the model shown in figure 5.3.1-2, the SIP core may interact directly with
5GS via the N5 reference point or Rx reference point to control QoS on a per
communication flow in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [7].
NOTE 1: Indirect interaction between SIP core and 5GS Network Exposure
Function using N33 reference point is not supported by 3GPP TS 23.002 [8].
Figure 5.3.1-3 shows the relationships between the reference points of the
common application plane of an MC service server and the common signalling
plane.
Figure 5.3.1-3: Relationships between reference points of the common MC
service application plane and signalling control planes
NOTE 2: Application plane reference point CSC-7 makes use of SIP-2 reference
point when the group management servers are connected by a single SIP core.
Where they are joined by more than one SIP core, CSC-7 also makes use of the
SIP-3 reference point.
NOTE 3: For simplicity, the HTTP proxy, which provides the interconnection
between HTTP-1, HTTP-2 and HTTP-3 reference points, is not shown in figure
5.3.1-3.
NOTE 4: CSC-5, CSC-9, and CSC-15 make use of SIP-1 and SIP-2 reference points.
For simplicity, this mapping relationship is not shown in figure 5.3.1-3.

MCVideo-9 reference point utilizes the Nmb4 reference point according to 3GPP
TS 23.247 [15].
## 5.6 MCData functional model description
### 5.6.1 On-network functional model
Figure 5.6.1-1 shows the generic functional model for the application plane
for an MCData system using the 5GS.
Figure 5.6.1-1: Generic MCData functional model for application plane
In the functional model shown in figure 5.6.1-1, the following is considered:
\- The description of the corresponding functional entities and reference
points in 3GPP TS 23.282 [5] applies.
\- MCData-cap-1, uses the 5G-GC1 reference point as described in clause 4.7
and fulfils the requirements of the 5G-GC1 reference point for MCData.
\- The description of the MCData-5 reference point in 3GPP TS 23.282 [5]
applies considering that it exists between the MCData server and the 5GS. It
is used for resource management of MCData sessions, e.g. QoS control, and
utilizes the N5 reference point or the Rx reference point or the N33 reference
point as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10], 3GPP TS 23.503
[9] and 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
\- MCData-5, utilizing Rx reference point or N5 reference point, may be used
when the MCData service provider directly interacts with operator\'s relevant
5GS network function for QoS control for both unicast PDU sessions and MBS
sessions (if dynamic PCC is applicable).
\- MCData-5, utilizing N33 reference point, may be used when the MCData
service provider is limited by the operational agreement, i.e., indirect
interaction with operator\'s 5GS network functions for QoS control.
\- The respective functional models supporting MCData capabilities (e.g., SDS,
FD, DS, IPcon) over unicast transmissions along with the corresponding
reference points (i.e., MCData-cap-1 to MCData-cap-n) described in 3GPP TS
23.282 [5] also apply when the 5G system is used.
\- The MCData-6 reference point, which exists between the MCData server and
the 5GS, is used to create an MBS session obtaining multicast or broadcast
resources for MCData application usage.
\- The MCData-6 reference point utilizes Nmb13 reference point when the MCData
service provider and the PLMN operator have an operational agreement where QoS
control is provided directly from the MCData service provider domain.
\- The MCData-6 reference point utilizes Nmb10 reference point when MBSF is
used.
\- The MCData-6 reference point utilizes N33 reference point when the MCData
service provider is limited by the operational agreement for QoS control, i.e.
indirect interaction with operator\'s 5GS network functions for QoS control is
only allowed.
\- The MCData-6 reference point utilizes Nmb6 reference point when MCData
service provider interacts with the Joint BM-SC, MBSF and MBSTF entity to
facilitate interworking with LTE.
\- The MCData-6 reference point utilizes the Nmb8 reference point according to
3GPP TS 23.247 [15] when MBSTF is used.
\- For interworking with LTE via Joint BM-SC, MBSF and MBSTF entity, the
MCData-6 reference point utilizes the Nmb4 reference point according to 3GPP
TS 23.247 [15].
\- The respective functional models supporting MCData capabilities (e.g., SDS,
FD, DS, IPcon) over eMBMS transmissions along with the corresponding reference
points (i.e., MCData-cap-1 to MCData-cap-n) described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [5]
also apply when the 5G MBS is used.
# 6 Application of functional models and deployment scenarios
## 6.1 General
This clause describes the application of the functional models described in
clause 5. It also describes deployment scenarios that highlight some of the
possible variations in the way that the functional models can be applied in
different situations.
## 6.2 On-network architectural model
### 6.2.1 On-network architectural model diagram
Figure 6.2.1-1 below is the on-network architectural model for the MC system
solution, where the MC system provides one or more MC services via a single
PLMN.
Figure 6.2.1-1: On-network architectural model
### 6.2.2 Application services layer
#### 6.2.2.1 Overview
The application services layer includes application functions of one or more
MC services and any required supporting functions grouped into common services
core.
#### 6.2.2.2 Common services core
Common services core is composed of the functional entities described in the
common functional model in clause 5.3.
#### 6.2.2.3 MC services
MC services are composed of the functional entities described in the
corresponding MC service functional models in clause 5.
### 6.2.3 SIP core
The SIP core provides rendezvous (contact address binding and URI resolution)
and service control (application service selection) functions, as described in
clause 5.3.
### 6.2.4 5GS
The 5GS provides data connectivity and services with QoS control for the
support of MC service sessions.
### 6.2.5 UE 1
UE 1 is an MC service UE in on-network mode supporting data connectivity and
application(s) related to one or more MC services over the 5GS, or an UE that
acts as 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay, or both of the above. It is composed of
the corresponding MC service functional entities described in clause 5.
### 6.2.6 UE 2
UE 2 is a device using 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay, and supporting
application(s) related to one or more MC services. It is composed of the
corresponding MC service functional entities described in clause 5.
## 6.3 Deployment scenarios
### 6.3.1 Administration of MC service, SIP core and 5GS
#### 6.3.1.1 General
This clause describes deployment scenarios in which different administration
of MC service, SIP core and 5GS are described, together with the sensitivities
of identities and other forms of signalling in those scenarios.
In each of these scenarios, the owner of the devices at each plane may be
different from the organization that administers these devices. For example,
the MC service provider may own some RAN components within the 5GS even when
the 5GS is administered by the PLMN operator, and the MC service UE may be
owned by an organization that is independent from PLMN and MC service
providers.
#### 6.3.1.2 Common administration of all planes
In this scenario, all planes (application services layer, SIP core and 5GS)
are administered by the same party. This is illustrated in figure 6.3.1.2-1
below.
Figure 6.3.1.2-1: Common administration of all services by one operator
Although the identities in each plane are separate as described in 3GPP TS
23.280 [3], there is no particular sensitivity of identities and other
information at the application plane, and these may be exposed to the SIP core
and the 5GS.
All authorization and authentication mechanisms at each plane, i.e. the
application services layer, SIP core and 5GS, shall be separate, but there may
be no need for any restrictions in how these are stored and managed; for
example the same entity could provide services to each of the application
services layer, SIP core and 5GS.
#### 6.3.1.3 MC service provider separate from SIP core and 5GS
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 6.3.1.3-1, the MC service provider
is separate and independent from the PLMN operator, and the MC service is
administered independently of the 5GS and SIP core. The PLMN operator
administers the 5GS and the SIP core.
Figure 6.3.1.3-1: MC service provider administers MC service separately from
SIP core and 5GS
The MC service provider may require that all application services layer
identities and other sensitive information are hidden both from the SIP core
and the 5GS.
When required by the MC service provider, all authentication and authorization
mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer are
hidden from and not available to the PLMN operator.
#### 6.3.1.4 MC service provider administers SIP core, separate from 5GS
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 6.3.1.4-1, the MC service provider
administers the SIP core, and the MC services and SIP core are independent of
the PLMN operator.
Figure 6.3.1.4-1: MC service provider provision of SIP core, separate domain
from 5GS
The MC service provider may require that all identities and other sensitive
information at the application services layer are hidden from the 5GS. The MC
service provider need not hide the identities and signalling at the
application services layer from the SIP core. However, the MC service provider
may require that identities and other sensitive information between SIP core
and SIP client in the MC service UE are also hidden from the 5GS.
All authentication and authorization mechanisms, including security roots, at
both application services layer and at SIP signalling plane may need to be
hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.
#### 6.3.1.5 SIP core partially administered by both PLMN operator and MC
service provider
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 6.3.1.5-1, the SIP core is
partially administered by both parties, for example when the SIP core
registrar is administered by the MC service provider, but the SIP core
registrar finder and proxy is administered by the PLMN operator.
Figure 6.3.1.5-1: MC service provider partial provision of SIP core, separate
domain from 5GS
The MC service provider may require that all identities and signalling at the
application services layer are hidden from the 5GS, and may require identities
and other sensitive information to be hidden from the PLMN operator
administered part of the SIP core.
All authentication and authorization mechanisms, including security roots, at
the application services layer may need to be hidden from, and not available
to, the PLMN operator.
#### 6.3.1.6 PLMN operator administers SIP core with SIP identities
administered by MC service provider
In this scenario, the PLMN operator administers the SIP core. However, the
identities used by the SIP core (IMPI and IMPU) for MC service UEs served by
the MC service provider are provided from the SIP database of the MC service
provider.
Figure 6.3.1.6-1: MC service provider provides identities to PLMN operator SIP
core
The MC service provider may require that all identities and signalling at the
application services layer are hidden from the SIP core and 5GS.
When required by the MC service provider, all authentication and authorization
mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer may
need to be hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.
The security roots (authentication keys) required for access to the signalling
control plane are not available to the PLMN operator as these are held in the
MC service provider\'s SIP database. However, derived parameters e.g.
authentication vectors are provided to the SIP core to allow signalling
control plane authentication to take place.
### 6.3.2 Resource management of MC service sessions by SIP core and MC
service server
#### 6.3.2.1 General
This clause describes two different scenarios in which resource management of
MC service sessions is performed via the Rx reference point, or N5 reference
point, or N33 reference point as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], 3GPP TS 23.502
[10] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [9], by either the SIP core or the MC service server
with the 5GS (PCF).
These may provide suitable models for each of the scenarios listed in clause
6.3.1. However, there is no direct correlation of any of the scenarios
described in this clause to each of the scenarios described in clause 6.3.1.
#### 6.3.2.2 Resource Management of MC service sessions by SIP core
In the scenario shown in figure 6.3.2.2-1, resource management of MC service
sessions is performed by the SIP core.
Figure 6.3.2.2-1: Resource management of MC service sessions by SIP core
#### 6.3.2.3 Management of MC service sessions by MC service server
In the scenario shown in figure 6.3.2.3-1, resource management of MC service
sessions is performed by the MC service server.
Figure 6.3.2.3-1: Resource management of MC service sessions by MC service
server
## 6.4 Involved business relationships
### 6.4.1 General
For the relationship between the MC service provider, the MC service
organization and the MC service user 3GPP TS 23.280 [3] clause 6 applies.
### 6.4.2 Public network and non-public network utilization
For the relationship between MC service provider and the utilization of public
networks and/or non-public networks the following service arrangements apply:
\- A home public network operator or a home non-public network operator can
have service arrangements with multiple MC service providers.
\- A MC service provider can have service arrangements with multiple home
public network operators and/or home non-public network operators.
\- As part of the service arrangement between the MC service provider and the
home public network operator/home non-public network operator, the
corresponding 5GS user profile can be provided which allows the MC service UEs
to register to the home public network operator/home non-public network
operator.
\- The home PLMN operator can have PLMN roaming agreements with multiple
visited PLMN operators and the visited PLMN operator can have PLMN roaming
agreements with multiple home PLMN operators.
Figure 6.4.2-1: Business relationships for MC services
## 6.5 Off-network architectural model
### 6.5.1 Off-network architectural model diagram
Figure 6.5.1-1 shows the off-network architectural model for the MC system
solution for 5G inter-UE communication, where no relay function is used.
Figure 6.5.1-1: Off-network architectural model for 5G inter-UE communication
where no relay function is used
Figure 6.5.1-2 shows the off-network architectural model for the MC system
solution for configuration management and group management. The description in
clause 9.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [3] applies.
Figure 6.5.1-2: Off-network architectural model for configuration management
and group management
### 6.5.2 UE 3
The UE 3 is a UE using 5G ProSe and supporting application(s) related to off-
network MC service, and it is composed of the corresponding MC service
functional entities described in clause 5.
### 6.5.3 UE 4
The UE 4 represents one or more UEs with the same functionality as UE 3.
6.5.4 Offline common services server
The offline common services server supports configuration applications related
to MC service, and it is composed of the corresponding MC service functional
entities described in clause 5.
# 7 MC procedures for 5GS
## 7.1 General
In this clause, only the procedures and information flows which are different
from that over EPS are captured. The MC service specific procedures and
information flows over 5GS remains the same as specified in TS 23.379 [6], TS
23.281[4], TS 23.282 [5] if not specially described in this clause.
## 7.2 MC service resource management (on-network)
### 7.2.1 General
These clauses specify the procedures for resource management for mission
critical services. The procedures are utilized by the following MC services:
\- MCPTT (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [6]);
\- MCVideo (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [4]); and
\- MCData (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [5]).
Session management, QoS model and QoS policy control are defined in 3GPP TS
23.501 [7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [9].
### 7.2.2 Request for unicast resources at session establishment
The procedure defined in this clause specifies how communication resources are
requested from 5GS at session establishment. If concurrent sessions are used
the MC service server may utilize the capability of resource sharing specified
in 3GPP TS 23.503 [9]. The exchange of the QoS characteristics of the required
resources takes place exclusively by means of direct interaction between SIP
core and PCF using N5 reference point or Rx reference point and encompass
media type, bandwidth, priority, application identifier and resource sharing
information.
Establishment, modification or release of communication resources are managed
according to 3GPP TS 23.502 [10]. The procedure is generic to any type of
session establishment that requires communication resources.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2-1 show the signalling procedures for the requesting
resource at session establishment.
Figure 7.2.2-1: Resource request at session establishment
1\. MC service client sends a call/session establishment request.
2\. MC service server receives evaluates the need of communication resources
and the use of media resource sharing.
3\. MC service server sends a session progress request containing request for
communication resources.
4\. Session management procedures using PCF policy control enforcement (as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [10]) initiated from SIP core local inbound/outbound
proxy using direct interaction between SIP core and PCF.
5\. The SIP core local inbound/outbound proxy forwards the call control
protocol request to the MC service client.
6\. The MC service client acknowledges the session progress request with an OK
message.
7\. The SIP core local inbound/outbound proxy forwards the OK message to the
MC service server.
8\. The MC service call/session is established, and resources have been
allocated.
### 7.2.3 Request for unicast resources at session establishment from MC
service server
#### 7.2.3.1 General
The procedure defined in this clause specifies how communication resources are
requested from 5GS at session establishment from the MC service server. The
required QoS characteristics for resources are sent directly to the PCF via
the N5 reference point or Rx reference point from the MC service server.
Alternatively, QoS characteristics for resources can be exchanged indirectly
utilizing N33 reference point between MC service server and NEF. QoS
characteristic information encompasses media type, bandwidth, priority,
application identifier, resource sharing information and network slice
information. If concurrent sessions are used, the MC service server may
utilize the capability of resource sharing specified in 3GPP TS 23.503 [8].
For the request of communication resources by the MC service server via N5
reference point or Rx reference point, or N33 reference point, the MC service
client provides to the MC service server the corresponding communication
resource details (e.g. IP addresses and ports) of the MC service client and
the corresponding media anchoring points.
This procedure is generic to any type of session establishment with the MC
service server requesting network resources.
#### 7.2.3.2 Procedure
Figure 7.2.3.2-1 describes the procedure for the request of resources at
session establishment from the MC service server.
Figure 7.2.3.2-1: Resource request at session establishment from the MC
service server
1\. The MC service client sends a call/session establishment request. The
request includes, apart from the SDP offer, access resource details, e.g. IP
addresses and ports of the MC service client related to the media session.
2\. The MC service server evaluates the need of communication resources and
use of media resource sharing.
3\. The MC service server sends a session progress request to the SIP core.
NOTE: The session progress request does not include a request for network
communication resources to be performed by the SIP core.
4\. The SIP core local inbound/outbound proxy forwards the session progress
request to the MC service client.
5\. The MC service client acknowledges the session establishment to the MC
service server. This message contains the final negotiated media parameters,
e.g. IP addresses and ports related to the media anchoring points received in
the SDP answer from the SIP core.
6\. To trigger resources allocation, the MC service server sends a request for
communication resources to 5GS. For direct interaction, the resource
allocation request is exchanged between MC service server and 5GS PCF using N5
reference point or Rx reference point. For indirect interaction, the resource
allocation request is exchanged between MC service server and 5GS NEF using
N33 reference point. The respective procedures are defined in 3GPP TS 23.502
[10]).
7\. Session management procedures using PCF policy control enforcement (as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [10]) initiated from MC service server either
directly via PCF or indirectly via NEF.
8\. The MC service call/session is established, and resources have been
allocated.
### 7.2.4 Request for modification of unicast resources
To modify an unicast media flow, the MC service server shall send a resource
modification request containing the parameters to be modified, using the call
control protocol via the SIP core to the UE. The exchange of the QoS
characteristics of the concerned resources takes place exclusively by means of
direct interaction between SIP core and PCF.
Possible scenarios when this procedure may be used are:
> \- Modify the allocation and retention priority for unicast resources;
>
> \- Release and resume resources in-between MC service calls when using the
> chat model; or
\- Releasing resources for the media plane should give the option to allow the
SIP session to either be torn down or continue.
Procedures in figure 7.2.4-1 are the signalling procedures for the
modification of a unicast:
Pre-conditions:
\- An MC service call or session is already in progress;
Figure 7.2.4-1: Media flow modification request
1\. MC service server decides to modify the parameters of a unicast bearer
(e.g. a request to upgrade the existing MC service call to an MC service
emergency or imminent threat call).
2\. MC service server sends a session update which includes a resource
modification request containing the modified parameters of the unicast bearer.
3\. Session management procedures using PCF policy control enforcement (as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [10]) initiated by the MC service server using
direct interaction between SIP core and PCF.
4\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the session update
request to the MC service client.
5\. The MC service client acknowledges the call control protocol request with
an OK message.
6\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the OK message to the
MC service server.
7\. The MC service call continues with the modified unicast resources.
NOTE: If multiple audio streams are sent to the UE, additional QoS flows could
be required during an established session. Pre-allocation of additional QoS
flows already at session establishment could be useful.
### 7.2.5 Request for media resources from MC service server
#### 7.2.5.1 General
The procedure in this sub clause specifies how to request resources for floor
control (or transmission control in MCVideo and MCData) and for the media
plane can be handled independently. This procedure utilizes the N5 reference
point or Rx reference point for direct interaction between MC service server
and 5GS (PCF) and for direct interaction between SIP core and 5GS (PCF).
Alternatively, resource requests for the media plane can be exchanged
indirectly using N33 reference point between MC service server and NEF.
Resources for transmission control are requested at session establishment, in
this case the IMS standard procedures using for direct interaction N5
reference point or Rx reference point as specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [2] are
used. The session description in this procedure shall encompass bandwidth
information applicable for the transmission control traffic requirement. At
group call setup the request for resources for the media plane is triggered.
Either this request is sent directly from the MC service server to 5GS (PCF)
or indirectly from the MC service server to 5GS (NEF).
The procedure is optional and is suitable when the procedures for pre-
established sessions are used. It may also be used to setup and tear down the
media plane used between consecutive group calls in one communication session
using the chat call model.
#### 7.2.5.2 Procedure
The figure 7.2.5.2-1 illustrates the procedure for resource allocation.
Figure 7.2.5.2-1: Request of resources for transmission control and media
plane
1\. The MC service client sends a request for group affiliation.
2\. The MC service client sends a request to the MC service server for
establishment of a communication session.
3\. The MC service server answer the session establishment request and adjust
the bandwidth information in the session description. The requested bandwidth
shall be minimized to cover the bandwidth requirements for floor control
signalling (or transmission control for MCVideo or MCData).
4\. The SIP core request resources towards the 5GS according to the session
establishment request.
5\. Session management procedures using PCF policy control enforcement (as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [10]) initiated by the SIP Core.
6\. The session establishment request is completed, and a response is sent
towards the MC service client.
7\. The MC service client sends a call setup message according to existing
procedures.
8\. The MC service server sends a request for resources for the media plane to
5GS, and the media plane is by that established. For direct interaction, the
resource allocation request is exchanged between MC service server and 5GS PCF
using N5 reference point or Rx reference point. For indirect interaction, the
resource allocation request is exchanged between MC service server and 5GS NEF
using N33 reference point. The respective procedures are defined in 3GPP TS
23.502 [10]). This request includes media description relevant for the media
plane.
9\. Session management procedures using PCF policy control enforcement (as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [10]) initiated by the MC service server either
directly via PCF or indirectly via NEF.
10\. Group call is ongoing on the group communication session.
11\. The MC service serve sends a release of media resources to 5GS, and the
media plane is by that terminated.
NOTE 1: The resources for transmission control are retained.
NOTE 2: Step 7-11 can be repeated several times within the life cycle of one
communication session.
## 7.3 MC service over 5G MBS
### 7.3.1 General
This subclause defines information flows and procedures for 5G MBS usage that
applies to MC services. 5G MBS session can be used by any MC service for any
MC service group.
The following subclauses specify the procedures and information flows for the
usage of 5G MBS transmission that are utilized by the following MC services:
\- MCPTT (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [6]);
\- MCVideo (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [4]); and
\- MCData (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [5]).
MC service specific pre-requisites and resultant behaviour by functional
entities in performing these procedures are specified in the respective MC
service TSs as listed above.
The first phase to utilize MBS sessions for MC service media transmission is
to have the sessions created hence the network resources are reserved. The MC
service server may consider the UE\'s capabilities and service related
information e.g., UE\'s MBS capabilities, location, MBS listening status
report sent by group members when it decides to create or use MBS sessions.
The MC service server needs to interact with the 5GC for this matter. During
the interaction, the necessary information related to the requested session is
determined, e.g., MBS session mode (either a broadcast or a multicast session)
and the required QoS profile. This interaction depends on the configuration
option under consideration, i.e., whether the MC service server is in trusted
domain (limited operations), and whether the session creation is done with or
without a dynamic PCC rule.
NOTE 1: It is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to
use multicast or broadcast MBS sessions.
NOTE 2: It is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to
create (one or multiple) MBS sessions for MC media for MC group communications
associated to a certain MC group or create (one or multiple) dynamic MBS
sessions once the need has emerged, e.g., dynamic MBS sessions to be
associated for an ad hoc group.
NOTE 3: It is implementation specific whether an MBS session is associated to
one or multiple MC groups, and whether it is re-assigned to other MC groups.
NOTE 4: How the MC service server uses the UE\'s capabilities and service
related information in order to create and use the MBS session is
implementation specific.
The information elements describing the MBS session under consideration is
then sent to the MC service clients via MBS session announcement, where the
latter need to react according to the announced session mode.
If eMBMS and 5G MBS co-exist for MC services, the MC service server may decide
to trigger the establishment of an eMBMS bearer to deliver the MC media
associated to the MC service group communications, if the target MC service
group(s) consists of members with eMBMS capable UE. As a result, the MC
service server subsequently needs to send an eMBMS bearer announcement towards
the clients camping on LTE.
NOTE 5: It is implementation specific whether the MC service server triggers
an eMBMS bearer or a unicast bearer to serve MC service clients camping on
LTE.
### 7.3.2 Information flows for 5G MBS
#### 7.3.2.1 MBS session announcement
Table 7.3.2.1-1 provides the information elements during MBS session
announcement, which are sent by the MC service server to the clients. The MBS
session announcement includes information elements related to the announced
MBS session. Optionally, it includes eMBMS related information elements, if
eMBMS and 5G MBS co-exist.

### 7.3.3 Procedures for usage of 5G MBS
#### 7.3.3.1 MBS session creation and MBS session announcement
##### 7.3.3.1.1 General
The procedures in this clause describe how MBS session creation and MBS
session announcement can be used for the transmission of MC service group
communication data over either broadcast or multicast MBS sessions. The MBS
session can either be created with or without dynamic PCC rule, where the
latter requires less interaction done by the MC service server towards the 5GC
(either directly or via NEF).
##### 7.3.3.1.2 Procedure for pre-created MBS session and MBS session
announcement
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service server has decided to use an MBS session for MC service
group communications associated to a certain MC service group based on
transport only mode.
\- The MC service server has performed MB-SMF discovery and selection either
directly or indirectly, via NEF/MBSF, unless the corresponding information is
locally configured.
\- MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same MC service group X.
\- The MC service server is aware whether to request the creation of the MBS
service server with or without dynamic PCC rule.
Figure 7.3.3.1.2-1: Use of pre-created MBS session.
1\. The MC service server initiates an MBS session creation procedure towards
the 5GC as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. The procedure starts once the MC
service server initiates a TMGI allocation request (either directly to MB-SMF
or indirectly via NEF). Upon the reception of the TMGI allocation response,
the MC service server sends an MBS session creation request, including further
information related to the MBS session, e.g., MBS session ID, MBS session mode
and the QoS requirements if dynamic PCC rule is not considered. However, if
dynamic PCC rule is considered, the MC service server defines these
requirements at a later step, namely it sends an MBS authorization/policy
create request towards PCF (either directly or to the NEF) indicating the QoS
requirements.
NOTE 1: In case of LTE eMBMS and 5G MBS co-existence, the MC service server
may trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearers as described in 3GPP TS 23.280
[3] (or it may establish a unicast bearer) based on the RAT capabilities
supported by the affiliated members in the MC service group X. If MBSF and BM-
SC are co-located, TMGI used by 4G eMBMS can be the same as the MBS session
ID.
NOTE 2: For the case of multi carrier support for broadcast MBS sessions, the
MC service server may indicate the frequencies within a broadcast MBS service
area by providing the MBS frequency selection area ID(s) (MBS FSA ID(s)) to
the MB-SMF, or indirectly, via NEF.
2\. The MC service server provides the MC service clients affiliated to MC
service group X with the information related to the created MBS session via
the MBS session announcement. As described in table 7.3.2.1-1, the MBS session
announcement includes information such as the MBS session ID, MBS session mode
(broadcast or multicast service type) and SDP information related to the MBS
session under consideration.
NOTE 3: The MC service server may send an MBS session announcement at an
earlier step during the MBS session creation procedure towards the MC service
clients once the MC group associated to the MBS session is known.
Optionally, the MC service server includes the information elements related to
the established eMBMS bearer once the MC service server has determined the
need, as indicated in table 7.3.2.1-1. The MC service clients which camp on
LTE will subsequently react to the information elements related to the eMBMS
bearer as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].
3\. MC service clients store and process the received MBS session information.
4\. MC service clients may provide an MBS session announcement acknowledgment
to the MC service server to indicate the reception of the corresponding MBS
session announcement.
5\. Based on the MBS session mode (either multicast or broadcast), the
following actions take place:
5a. For multicast MBS sessions, MC service clients initiate a UE session join
request towards the 5GC using the information provided via the MBS session
announcement. Hence, upon the first successful UE session join request, the
multicast is then established, and the radio resources are reserved, if the
session is in an active state. The established session can either be in active
or inactive state as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. The MC service clients
sends a UE session join notification towards the server. If indicated in the
MBS session announcement information, MC service clients report the monitoring
state (i.e., the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the MC service
server; or
5b. For broadcast MBS sessions, if the MC service client is accessing over 5G,
the session is established as part of the session creation procedures as
described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15], and the network resources are reserved both
in 5GC and NG-RAN. The MC service clients start monitoring the reception
quality of the broadcast MBS session. If indicated in the MBS session
announcement information, MC service clients report the monitoring state
(i.e., the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the MC service
server.
NOTE 4: It is implementation specific whether the MBS session reception
quality level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS
flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signals, such as the
reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), or packet loss.
6\. The MC service clients provide a listening status notification related to
the announced session (multicast or broadcast session) in the form of an MBS
listening status report.
7\. An MC service group communication setup takes place as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.379 [6], 3GPP TS 23.281 [4], or 3GPP TS 23.282 [5]. The MC service
server determines to use the pre-created MBS session for this group
communication.
##### 7.3.3.1.3 Procedure for dynamic MBS sessions
In this scenario, the group communication is already taken place and a unicast
PDU session is utilized for MC DL transmission. When the MC service server
decides to use an MBS session for the transmission under consideration, the MC
service server interacts with 5GC to reserve the necessary network resources.
NOTE 1: The MC service server logic for determining when to create a dynamic
MBS session is implementation specific.
The procedure in figure 7.3.3.1.3-1 shows one MC service client receiving the
DL media. There might also be MC service clients in the same MC group
communication session that receive the communication on an MBS session.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service client is attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to a
certain MC service group X.
\- The MC service server is aware whether to request the creation of the MBS
service server with or without dynamic PCC rule.
\- The MC service server has performed MB-SMF discovery and selection either
directly or indirectly, via NEF/MBSF, unless the corresponding information is
locally configured.
\- No MBS session exists, or the existing multicast MBS session fails to
satisfy the QoS requirements.
Figure 7.3.3.1.3-1: Use of dynamic MBS session.
1\. An MC service group communication session is established as specified in
3GPP TS 23.379 [6], 3GPP TS 23.281 [4], or 3GPP TS 23.282 [5].
2\. The MC service server decides to create an MBS session. The MBS session
creation procedure takes place as described in clause 7.3.3.1.
NOTE 2: In case of LTE eMBMS and 5G MBS co-existence, the MC service server
may trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearers as described in 3GPP TS 23.280
[3] (or it may establish a unicast bearer) based on the RAT capabilities
supported by the affiliated members in the MC service group X. If MBSF and BM-
SC are co-located, TMGI used by 4G eMBMS can be the same as the MBS session
ID.
NOTE 3: For the case of multi carrier support for broadcast MBS sessions, the
MC service server may indicate the frequencies within a broadcast MBS service
area by providing the MBS frequency selection area ID(s) (MBS FSA ID(s)) to
the MB-SMF, or indirectly, via NEF.
3\. The MC service server provides the MC service client with the information
related to the created MBS session via an MBS session announcement. As
described in table 7.3.2.1-1, the session announcement includes information
such as the MBS session ID, MBS session mode (broadcast or multicast service
type), and SDP information related to the MBS session.
> Optionally, the MC service server includes the information elements related
> to the established eMBMS bearer once the MC service server has determined
> the need, as indicated in table 7.3.2.1-1. The MC service clients which camp
> on LTE will subsequently react to the information elements related to the
> eMBMS bearer as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].
4\. The MC service client stores the MBS session ID and other associated
information.
5\. The MC service client may send an MBS session announcement ack back to the
MC service server.
6\. Based on the MBS session mode (either multicast or broadcast), the
following actions take place:
6a. For multicast MBS sessions, MC service client initiates a UE session join
request towards the 5GC using the information provided via the MBS session
announcement. Hence, upon the first successful UE session join request, the
multicast is then established, and the radio resources are reserved, if the
session is in active state. The established session can either be in active or
inactive state as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. The MC service client
sends a UE session join notification towards the server. If indicated in the
MBS session announcement information, MC service clients report the monitoring
state (i.e., the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the MC service
server; or
6b. For broadcast MBS sessions, if the MC service client is accessing over 5G,
the session is established as part of the session creation procedures as
described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15], and the network resources are reserved both
in 5GC and NG-RAN. The MC service clients start monitoring the reception
quality of the broadcast MBS session. If indicated in the MBS session
announcement information, MC service clients report the monitoring state
(i.e., the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the MC service
server.
NOTE 4: It is implementation specific whether the MBS session reception
quality level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS
flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the
reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.
7\. The MC service clients provide a listening status notification related to
the announced session (multicast or broadcast session) in the form of an MBS
listening status report.
8\. An MC service group communication via dynamic MBS session is established.
#### 7.3.3.2 Request for updating MBS resources for group communications
##### 7.3.3.2.1 General
The MC service server can create one or several MBS sessions based on certain
service requirements (e.g., QoS profile), a certain service area, or the
activity status of multicast MBS sessions. However, during the life cycle of
the MBS sessions, the MC service server may need to update the sessions to
meet emerging needs, including the service requirements, service area related
parameters, etc..., as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
In case of dynamic PCC rule, the MC service server needs to determine what
aspects are needed to be updated (either service area related aspects/
multicast activation status, service requirements aspects, or both as
described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]) in order to interact with the required
entity in the 5GC either directly, (in case the MC service server is in
trusted domain), or indirectly via NEF/MBSF.
##### 7.3.3.2.2 Procedure for updating MBS resources without dynamic PCC rule
The procedure shown in figure 7.3.3.2.2-1 presents an MBS session update
procedure triggered by the MC service server (either directly to the MB-SMF,
or indirectly via NEF/MBSF). Within the update request, either the service
requirements, MBS service area, activity status of multicast MBS session, or
all three are done, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same active MC service group.
\- The MC service server has obtained the required information related to the
MB-SMF, either locally configured or during initial session configuration.
\- The MBS session is created with certain service requirements and optionally
with a certain broadcast/multicast service area. The MBS session is announced
to be associated with the MC service group for group communication purposes.
Figure 7.3.3.2.2-1: MBS session update without dynamic PCC.
1\. An MBS session is established as described in in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]
(either a multicast or a broadcast session), and associated with a certain
active MC group for group communication purposes. In the case of a multicast
MBS session, the MC service clients have already joined the session.
2\. The MC service server invokes an MBS session update request towards the
5GC (either directly to the MB-SMF or indirectly via NEF/MBSF) once the need
has emerged to modify some aspects for the given MBS session under
consideration. Hence, the MC service server sends the MBS session update
request as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15] and either directly to the MB-SMF
or indirectly via NEF/MBSF, indicating the MBS session ID to be updated. Along
with the update request, the updated aspects are sent, which are either
service requirements (required QoS), service area, or both. In case of
multicast MBS sessions, the MC service server may as well update the status
(active or inactive) of the multicast MBS session once needed within the
update request.
NOTE 1: The updated service area information is required for local MBS and for
broadcast MBS services.
3\. Based on the needed requirements, the corresponding MBS session is
accordingly modified, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. The update may lead
to QoS Flow(s) addition, modification, or removal.
4\. The MC service server receives an MBS session update response as described
in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15], once the requested modifications are performed, and
the indicated MBS session is updated accordingly.
5\. The MC service server may initiate a session announcement towards the MC
service clients associated with the ongoing session in order to announce the
updated information, if required, e.g., the updated service area or SDP
information.
NOTE 2: The updated service area information is required for local MBS and for
broadcast MBS services.
6\. The MC service server sends an MapGroupToSessionStream over the configured
MBS session providing the required information to receive the media related to
the established MC service group communication.
7\. The MC service clients process the received information over the
MapGroupToSessionStream in order to receive the associated MC media over the
specific MBS session stream.
8\. MC service client 1 sends media to the MC service server over unicast to
be distributed for the established group communication.
9\. The MC service server distributes the MC media to the MC services clients
2 to n over the indicated streams.
##### 7.3.3.2.3 Procedure for updating MBS resources with dynamic PCC rule
The procedure shown in figure 7.3.3.2.3-1 presents an MBS session update
procedure triggered by the MC service server to the 5GC, either directly or
via NEF/MBSF. Based on the required updates to be done, the MC service server
needs to interact with the MB-SMF to update the MBS service area and multicast
activity status, with the PCF to update the required QoS requirements, or
sequentially both to update all the above, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247
[15].
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same active MC service group.
\- The MC service server has obtained the required information related to the
MB-SMF, either locally configured or during initial session configuration.
\- The MBS session is created with certain service requirements and optionally
with a certain broadcast/multicast service area. The MBS session is announced
to be associated with the MC service group for group communication purposes.
Figure 7.3.3.2.3-1: MBS session update with dynamic PCC.
1\. An MBS session is established as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15] (either
a multicast or a broadcast MBS session), and associated with a certain active
MC group for group communication purposes. In the case of a multicast MBS
session, the MC service clients have already joined the MBS session.
2\. The MC service server, based on the update requirements (i.e., MBS service
area and/or the multicast MBS session activity status as well as the service
requirements), perform the MBS session update with PCC procedure towards the
5GS as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15] and/or the MBS session
activate/deactivate procedure as described in clause 7.3.3.4.
NOTE 1: The updated service area information is required for local MBS and for
broadcast MBS services.
3\. The MC service server may initiate a MBS session announcement towards the
MC service clients associated with the ongoing MBS session in order to
announce the updated information if required, e.g., the updated service area
or SDP information.
NOTE 2: The updated service area information is required for local MBS and for
broadcast MBS services.
4\. The MC service server sends an MapGroupToSessionStream over the MBS
session providing the required information to receive the media related to the
established MC service group communication.
5\. The MC service clients process the received information over the
MapGroupToSessionStream in order to receive the associated MC media over the
specific MBS session stream.
6\. MC service client 1 sends media to the MC service server over unicast to
be distributed for the established group communication.
7\. The MC service server distributes the MC media to the MC services clients
2 to n over the indicated streams.
#### 7.3.3.3 MBS session deletion request
##### 7.3.3.3.1 General
The MC service server can decide to release a certain MBS session once it is
no longer further utilized for the associated MC service group communication,
e.g., the MC service group is no longer active, the MC media transmission is
over and no further MC media to be delivered, group communication is
terminated. The MBS session deletion procedure leads to releasing the network
resources associated to that MBS session.
NOTE: It is up to implementation of MC service server to decide whether to
release the MBS session or re-use it for subsequent group operations.
To delete the MBS session, the MC service server sends an MBS session deletion
request to the 5GS providing the corresponding MBS session ID. The MBS session
deletion request is sent to the MB-SMF (directly or via NEF/MBSF) when PCC is
not used. However, if dynamic PCC rule is utilized, a policy authorization
deletion request is initially sent to the PCF. Further details are provided in
3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
MC service server further informs the MC service client with the MBS session
de-announcement, so that the MC client UE stops monitoring the broadcast MBS
session or leaves the multicast MBS session. This procedure is applied for
both broadcast MBS session and multicast MBS session.
##### 7.3.3.3.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.3.3.3.2-1 describes the MBS session deletion aspects
for group communication.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same active MC service group.
\- An MBS session is configured to address the corresponding MC service group
with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain
broadcast/multicast service area. The session is announced and established for
group communication purposes for the MC service group.
Figure 7.3.3.3.2-1: MBS session deletion procedure.
1\. The MC service server decides to delete the MBS session for the associated
MC group communication, either multicast or broadcast session.
2\. The MC service server sends an MBS session de-announcement message with
the MBS session ID towards the MC service client(s). Upon receiving the MBS
session de-announcement message, either 3a or 3b is performed.
3a. If the MBS session identified by MBS session ID is a broadcast MBS
session, the MC service client(s) stops monitoring the broadcast MBS session
and removes the broadcast MBS session related information.
3b. If the MBS session identified by MBS session ID is a multicast MBS
session, the joined MC service client(s) initiate an MBS session leave
procedure to leave the indicated MBS session in order to release the
respective network resources, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
4\. Subsequently, the MC service clients may send an MBS session de-
announcement acknowledgement message to the MC service server indicating the
status of MBS session.
5\. The MC service server initiates the MBS session deletion procedure with
the 5GC (either directly or through NEF/MBSF) in order to stop using the
configured MBS session and release the corresponding network resources. The MC
service server indicates within the MBS session release request the
corresponding MBS session ID. The MBS session deletion procedure can either be
with or without a dynamic PCC rule, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
#### 7.3.3.4 Request to activate / de-activate multicast MBS sessions
##### 7.3.3.4.1 General
In case of multicast MBS sessions, the members affiliated to a certain MC
group need to initiate a UE session join request towards the 5GC in order to
receive the MC media sent via the associated MBS session. The UE session join
request enables the reservation of NG-RAN resources for the members of the MC
group. However, it is not necessary that the MC media is delivered over the
whole time the multicast MBS session is associated to the group under
consideration. Therefore, the MC service server is able to efficiently utilize
and control the reservation of radio resources based on the availability of MC
data to be delivered via the activation and de-activation procedure. This
presents more flexibility and efficient use of resources different from LTE.
The most suitable scenario to activate/de-activate a certain multicast MBS
session is based on whether there is an MC group call, e.g., MCPTT group call,
taking place over that associated MBS session to the MC group. In this manner,
the MC service server can activate the associated multicast session once an MC
group call takes place, then deactivate it once the MC group call is over.
Whether the multicast session is activated (i.e., in an active state), or de-
activated (in an inactive state), the MC group is associated to the multicast
session and its members are within a UE session join.
The MBS session update request with the requested MBS session status is
triggered by the MC service server either directly towards the MB-SMF or
indirectly via NEF/MBSF.
NOTE: The activation of de-activation procedure may also be triggered by MB-
SMF based on receiving notification from MB-UPF based on the availability of
MC data to be transmitted.
##### 7.3.3.4.2 Multicast MBS session activation procedure
The procedure shown in figure 7.3.3.4.2-1 presents the multicast MBS session
activation procedure triggered by the MC service server.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to
the same MC service group X.
\- The MC service server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF
discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally
configured.
\- The MC service server has decided to use a multicast MBS session for MC
service group communications associated to MC service group X.
\- The MBS session is created and announced to address MC group communication
related to the associated MC service group X with certain service requirements
and optionally with a certain service area.
Figure 7.3.3.4.2-1: Multicast MBS session activation procedure.
1\. The multicast MBS session is established as the first UE session join
request, which is initiated by the first MC service UE towards 5GC, is
granted. At this stage, the multicast MBS session is established with an
inactive state.
2\. The MC service server decides to activate the multicast MBS session as MC
data is needed to be transmitted over the MBS session to the MC group X, as an
MC group communication (e.g., MCPTT group call) is to take place over the
associated MBS session.
3\. The MC service sends an MBS session update request towards the 5GC, either
directly to the MB-SMF or via NEF/MBSF, indicating the MBS session ID to be
activated as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
4\. The 5GC changes the MBS session status to \"active\" and finds the list of
joined MC service UEs associated with the MBS session and activates the NG-
RAN resources for MC data delivery as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
5\. The 5GC may send an MBS session update response to the MC service server
indicating that the requested multicast MBS session has been activated as
described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
##### 7.3.3.4.3 Multicast MBS session de-activation procedure
The procedure shown in figure 7.3.3.4.3-1 presents the multicast MBS session
activation procedure triggered by the MC service server.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to
the same MC service group X.
\- The MC service server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF
discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally
configured.
\- A multicast MBS session is created and announced to address the
corresponding MC service group with certain service requirements and
optionally with a certain multicast service area.
\- The MC service clients have already joined the multicast MBS session and
are able to receive the MC data over the associated MBS session.
Figure 7.3.3.4.3-1: Multicast MBS session deactivation procedure.
1\. The group communication associated with MC service group X takes place,
and the corresponding MC data is delivered over the associated multicast MBS
session, hence the MBS session has an active state.
2\. The MC service server decides to deactivate the multicast MBS session, as
no further MC data to be delivered to the associated group, as the MC group
call is over, and no further MC media is to be delivered.
3\. The MC service server sends an MBS session update request towards the 5GC,
either directly to the MBâ€‘SMF or via NEF/MBSF, indicating the MBS session ID
to be deactivated as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
4\. The 5GC changes the MBS session state to \"inactive\" and deactivates the
radio resources associated with the joined MC service UEs as described in 3GPP
TS 23.247 [15].
5\. The 5GC may send an MBS session update response to the server indicating
that the requested multicast MBS session has been inactivated as described in
3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
#### 7.3.3.5 MC service group media transmissions over 5G MBS sessions
##### 7.3.3.5.1 General
The MC service server can decide to configure an MBS session per MC service
group to transmit the media related to the corresponding MC service group
communications. Such group communications can comprise different service
requirements. For that, multicast and broadcast MBS sessions need to be
configured with multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service
requirements, e.g., different required QoS, provided by the MC service server.
For instance, application-level control messages or media associated to a
group communication can comprise different QoS requirements. Also, different
type of group communications can comprise different QoS requirements, e.g.,
emergency group calls should be handled with a higher priority than normal
group calls.
The configuration of multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service
requirements is associated to the assignment of different streams (e.g.,
different ports) within an MBS session.
The established multicast MBS session can either be in active or inactive
state, where the former indicates the activation of radio resources hence
transmitting the MC media to the associated MC service group, and the latter
indicates their deactivation as no MC media is being transmitted. The MC
service server may trigger the activation of multicast MBS sessions once the
MC service group is established and active, as well as once the MC media is
available for transmission. For this purpose, the MC service server sends a
multicast MBS session activation request towards the 5GC indicating the MBS
session ID to be activated.
Similar to the use of eMBMS, the MC service server shall provide the
associated information between a specific group communication and the stream
to be used within an MBS session. This information could be sent in advance in
an MBS session announcement or could be provided on demand in an additional
signalling message for the MBS session, e.g., MapGroupToSessionStream (similar
to the MapGroupToBearer in eMBMS).
##### 7.3.3.5.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.3.3.5.2-1 describes how media related to a specific
group communication can be distributed over a configured MBS session which
consist of multiple QoS flows, i.e. addressing different service requirements.
The procedure is applicable for both the pre-created MBS session case as
described in clause 7.3.3.1.2 and the dynamic MBS session case as described in
clause 7.3.3.1.3. For simplicity, the figure 7.3.3.5.2-1 shows that the MBS
session is pre-created prior to the group communication establishment.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same MC service group X.
\- The MC service server has decided to use an MBS session for MC service
group communications associated to MC service group X.

NOTE: The MC service server can stop the unicast delivery (if ongoing) towards
the MC service clients considering the UE session join notification or the MBS
listening status report.
9\. The MC service server may send a multicast MBS session deactivation
request towards the 5GC in order to deactivate the multicast MBS session. For
this purpose, the MC service server indicates the MBS session ID to be
deactivated.
10\. The MC service server may further trigger the UE to leave multicast MBS
session.
#### 7.3.3.6 Aplication level control signalling over 5G MBS sessions
##### 7.3.3.6.1 Description
The MC service server may use an 5G MBS session for application level control
signalling. An 5G bearer for application level control signalling is typically
used for the purposes beyond the benefit for using 5G for resource efficiency,
e.g. for improved MC service performance (KPIs), handling of high load
scenarios.
Similar to the usage of eMBMS, both broadcast and multicast 5MBS session for
application level control signalling may be used to transmit the following
messages,
\- Transmission control (e.g. call setup and floor control)
\- MBS session announcement for media sessions
\- Group application paging
\- Group dynamic data (e.g. status of the group)
\- Group state (e.g. emergency alerts)
Similar to the usage of eMBMS bearer in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], 5G MBS session for
application level control signalling is created in a service area that is
larger than the estimated service for media MBS session. The service area for
the media sessions is mainly based on counting of group members in each
defined service area. The MBS session for application level control signalling
is also created with a QoS that is better than MBS media session since the
packet loss requirements are much stricter.
The MC service client shall not send responses to group-addressed application
level control signalling unless instructed or configured to respond.
##### 7.3.3.6.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 7.3.3.6.2-1 shows only one of the receiving MC service
clients using an 5G MBS session.
Figure 7.3.3.6.2-1: Use of 5G MBS for application-level control signalling
1\. The MC service server determines to create MBS session for application-
level control signalling, The creation of the 5G MBS session is done according
to 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
2\. The MC service server passes the 5G MBS session info for the service
description associated with the 5G MBS session to the MC service client. The
MC service client obtains the MBS session ID, from the service description.
NOTE: For 5G MBS and 4G eMBMS co-existence, the eMBMS bearers activation and
MBS session announcement are performed as specified in the procedure for pre-
created MBS session and session announcement.
3\. The MC service client stores the information associated with the MBS
session ID. The MC service client uses the MBS session ID and other 5G MBS
session related information to enable monitoring of the 5G MBS session by the
MC service UE. In the case of multicast, UE may execute network layer
multicast MBS joining as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
4\. Steps 4 to 6 defined in clause 7.3.3.1.2 are performed.
5\. The MC service server transmits MC application control messages over the
MBS session.
#### 7.3.3.7 Multi-server MBS session coordination
##### 7.3.3.7.1 General
The motivation and principle of supporting Multi-server MBS session
coordination is exactly similar to Multi-server eMBMS bearer coordination as
described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].
NOTE: The procedures in clause 7.3.3.7.2 are only used when MBS session
sharing between multiple MC service servers is required. It is implementation
specific whether MBS session is shared amongst multiple MC service servers.
##### 7.3.3.7.2 Procedures
###### 7.3.3.7.2.1 MBS Session coordination independent of media
The procedure in this sub clause applies to both multicast and broadcast MBS
session. The principle and pre-condition is similar with eMBMS bearer
coordination as defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].
This procedure is used when two or more MC service servers are serving users
in the same area and are configured to share 5G MBS sessions for that specific
area. The MC service servers may be of the same kind or different kind. The MC
service servers are not participating in the same group call, which means that
each MC service server transmit media independently of each other.
Pre-conditions:
\- All MC service servers are configured with the contact information of those
MC service servers that are configured to take the MBS session control role.
Figure 7.3.3.7.2.1-1: Multiple server MBS procedure independent of media.
1\. The MC service server 1 evaluates whether MBS transmission is desired for
each service area in which MC service group members are located, based upon
the locations, affiliation status and other factors.
2\. The MC service server 1 determines whether another MC service server has
already established an MBS session with coverage for the MBS service area
where MBS transmissions are desired. To do this, the MC service server 1
consults a pre-configured list of MC service servers and sends them a discover
MBS session request. This request may be sent to several MC service servers.
NOTE: MC service servers of the same type can be configured to discover MBS
sessions from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized
entity for MBS session control for the MC service. Similarly, all MC service
servers of all types can be configured to discover MBS sessions from a single
server. The single server then becomes a centralized MBS session controller
for all MC services.
3\. The MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) responds with a
discover MBS session response indicating whether there is an MBS session
available in the specific MBS service area with the requested bandwidth. The
discover MBS session response message includes the MBS session ID of the MBS
session that is shared between the MC service servers. If the MBS session of
interest has insufficient bandwidth, the polling MC service server 1 may
resort to unicast, or may allocate another MBS session for the congested area.
If a duplicate MBS session is allocated for the same area, the MBS session
should not be shared with other servers and may be torn down as soon as the
congestion on the original MBS session clears up, in order to conserve
resources.
For any MBS service areas not covered by another MC service server, the MC
service server 1 prepares to distribute media to those MBS service areas by
setting up an MBS session. The MBS session set up by the MC service server 1
may then become available for other MC service servers (controlling role) for
other MC service groups.
4\. 4a.The MC service server 1 performs the MBS session announcement towards
MC client 1, as well as MBS notification handling, according to the relevant
procedures specified in this specification. In case of multicast MBS sessions,
the MC service UE subsequently initiates a UE session join towards 5GC, and
may send a UE session join notification to MC service server 1 indicating it
has successfully joined the multicast MBS session under consideration.
4.b If the MC service server 2 is authorized to receive MBS related location
information from the users utilizing the services from MC service server 1,
the MC service server 2 may optionally do the MBS session announcement and
handling of the notifications on behalf of MC service server 1. The
notifications shall in this case be sent to both MC service server 1 and MC
service server 2. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service UE
subsequently initiates a UE session join towards 5GC, and may send a UE
session join notification to MC service server 2.
5\. The MC service server 1 sends a media distribution request to the MC
service server 2 (MBS session control role). The media distribution request is
sent to reserve the specified capacity in the MBS session.
6\. MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) sends a media distribution
response to the MC service server 1 indicating whether the request can be
supported and supplies details about the MBS session.
7\. The MC service server 1 establishes a group communication session via the
MBS session, informing MBS session connected MC service clients 1 and 2 that a
group communication session is about to start on the MBS session. This step is
equivalent to MapGroupToSessionStream.
8\. MC service client 2 sends media on the uplink to the MC service server 1.
9\. The MC service server 1 forwards the media to MC service server 2 (MBS
session control role).
10\. The MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) distributes the media
to MC service client 1 with MBS capabilities over the MBS session.
11\. The MC service server 1 sends a media distribution release request,
informing the MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) to request the MC
service server 2 (MBS session control role) to release the capacity that was
reserved in step 5.
12\. The MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) responds to the
request by sending a media distribution release response.
###### 7.3.3.7.2.2 MBS session coordination within one group call
The procedure in this subclause applies to both multicast MBS session and
broadcast MBS session.
The principle is similar to eMBMS bearer coordination within one group call as
the following:
\- It may be used when two MC service servers are serving users in the same
area and are configured to share MBS sessions for that specific area. The MC
service servers are of the same kind, and the MC service servers may
participate in the same group call, and by that have a need to deliver the
same content.
Pre-conditions:
\- All MC service servers are configured with the contact information of those
MC service servers that are configured to take the MBS session control role.
Figure 7.3.3.7.2.2-1: Multiple server MBS procedure within one group call
1\. The MC service server 1 evaluates whether MBS based transmission is
desired for each service area in which MC service group members are located,
based upon the locations, affiliation status and other factors.
2\. The MC service server 1 determines whether another MC service server has
already established an MBS session with coverage for the MBS service area
where MBS based transmission is desired. To do this, the MC service server 1
consults a pre-configured list of MC service servers and sends them a discover
MBS session request. This request may be sent to several MC service servers.
NOTE 1: MC service servers of the same type can be configured to discover MBS
sessions from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized
entity for MBS session control for the MC service. Similarly, all MC service
servers of all types can be configured to discover MBS sessions from a single
server. The single server then becomes a centralized MBS session controller
for all MC services.
3\. The MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) responds with a
discover MBS session response indicating whether there is an MBS session
available in the specific MBS service area with the requested bandwidth. The
discover MBS session response message includes the ID of the MBS session that
is shared between the MC service servers. If the MBS session of interest has
insufficient bandwidth, the polling MC service server 1 may resort to unicast,
or may allocate another MBS session for the congested area. If a duplicate MBS
session is allocated for the same area, the MBS session should not be shared
with other servers and may be torn down as soon as the congestion on the
original MBS session clears up, in order to conserve resources.
For any MBS service areas not covered by another MC service server, the MC
service server 1 prepares to distribute media to those MBS service areas by
setting up a MBS session. The MBS session created by the MC service server 1
may then become available for other MC service servers (controlling role) for
other MC service groups.
4a. The MC service server 1 performs the MBS session announcement as well as
the MBS listening reporting according to the relevant procedures specified in
this specification. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service UE(s)
subsequently initiate a UE session join towards 5GC, and may send a UE session
join notification to MC service server 1 indicating it has successfully joined
the multicast MBS session under consideration.
4b. If the MC service server 2 is authorized to receive MBS related location
information from the users utilizing the services from MC service server 1,
the MC service server 2 may optionally do the MBS session announcement and
handling the listening reports on behalf of MC service server 1. Listening
reports shall in this case be sent to both MC service server 1 and MC service
server 2. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service UE(s) subsequently
initiate a UE session join towards 5GC, and may send a UE session join
notification to MC service server 2.
NOTE 2: Steps 1-4 are also performed by MC service server 3, but is not shown
in the procedure to make it easier to read.
5\. The MC service client 2 initiates a group call that is subject for MBS
transmission. In this scenario there are more than one MC service server
(i.e., MC service server 1 and MC service server 3) that serve MC service
clients that are affiliated to the group, and by that should receive the media
in the group call.
6a. The MC service server 1 sends a media distribution request to the MC
service server 2 (MBS session control role). The media distribution request
includes the MC group identifier. This indicates that the media distribution
request is used for this specific group call.
6b. The MC service server 3 sends a media distribution request to the MC
service server 2 (MBS session control role). The media distribution request
includes the MC group identifier. This indicates that the media distribution
request is used for this specific group call.
7a. The MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) sends a media
distribution response to the MC service server 1 indicating whether the
request can be supported and supplies details about the MBS session. This also
includes details on which media stream should be used for transmitting the
media on the MBS session. This information is used in the
MapGroupToSessionStream message sent by the MC service server when setting up
the group call.
7b. The MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) sends a media
distribution response to the MC service server 3 indicating that the group
call is already transmitted on the MBS session by another MC service server.
Based on the information, the MC service server 3 could decide to not transmit
media if media is already transmitted.
8a. The media is sent from the MC service client 2 to MC service server 1,
which is the participating server for the MC service group of the group call.
8b. The media is forwarded to all MC service servers that are serving users
that take part in the group call.
NOTE 3: The figure above does not visualize the participating server for the
MC service group and controlling server for the MC service group. The media is
sent to all participating servers for the MC service group which are the
servers that decide on unicast or MBS transmission.
9\. The MC service server 1 forwards the media to MC service server 2 (MBS
session control role).
10\. The MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) distributes the media
to MC service client 1 with MBS capabilities via MBS session.
11\. The MC service server 1 sends a media distribution release request, to
request the MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) to release the
capacity that was reserved in step 5. The media distribution release request
shall only be sent when the group call is terminated.
12\. The MC service server 2 (MBS session control role) responds to the
request by sending a media distribution release response.
#### 7.3.3.8 Service continuity between 5G MBS delivery and unicast delivery
##### 7.3.3.8.1 General
This clause addresses the issue of MC service media delivery over MBS session,
specifically, to maintain the service continuity when switching between 5G MBS
delivery and unicast delivery.
##### 7.3.3.8.2 Service continuity for broadcast MBS session
###### 7.3.3.8.2.1 General
The MC service client reports the broadcast reception quality to the MC
service server which is used to make the decision whether to use the unicast
delivery to the MC service UE(s) which are suffering bad broadcast reception
quality due to e.g., move out of the broadcast service area.
An MC service client monitors the broadcast MBS session to receive MC service
media. Based on the received quality (e.g., radio level quality, RTP packet
loss), the MC service client needs to inform the MC service server that the MC
service client is able to receive the MC service media on the broadcast MBS
session with sufficient quality or not.
This estimation of the broadcast reception quality may be dependent on, for
example, the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and measurements from the
reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), RTP packet loss, BLER of the
received media.
###### 7.3.3.8.2.2 Procedures
###### # 7.3.3.8.2.2.1 Service continuity from broadcast to unicast
The procedure in figure 7.3.3.8.2.2.1-1 illustrates the UE which is receiving
media via broadcast MBS session is switched to unicast delivery because the UE
suffers from bad broadcast reception quality due to e.g., moving out of the
broadcast service area. It shows only one of the receiving MC service clients
receiving the broadcast MBS session.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC group communication is ongoing and the MC service media (e.g., DL
media, application layer control signalling) is transmitted via broadcast MBS
session.
2\. The MC service client is receiving the MC service media (e.g., DL media,
application layer control signalling) via the broadcast MBS session.
3\. The MC service client(s) already have the associated information (e.g.,
SDP) to receive the unicast delivery during the group communication
establishment phase.
Figure 7.3.3.8.2.2.1-1: Service continuity from broadcast to unicast
1\. An MC service group communication session is ongoing and the DL media is
transmitted over broadcast MBS session.
2\. The MC service client detects that it suffers bad broadcast reception due
to e.g., moving out of the broadcast service area of the announced MBS session
ID (i.e., TMGI). The MC service client may determine the broadcast reception
quality by using the BLER of the received media. When no media is received,
the quality estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation
and coding scheme (MCS).
3\. The MC service client sends MBS listening status report which indicates
the broadcast reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is not
sufficient to receive media. The MC service client may also map the determined
broadcast reception quality to a broadcast reception quality level. The
broadcast reception quality level indicates at which specific broadcast
reception quality level the MC service media has been received.
NOTE 1: It is implementation that the broadcast reception quality level can be
determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via
e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals
from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.
NOTE 2: The set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the
determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are implementation.
NOTE 3: The frequency of MC service UE sending listening reports can be
limited to prevent signalling congestion. E.g., the MC service UE can stop
monitoring the broadcast reception quality and send the MBS listening status
report only once when it moves outside of the broadcast service area.
4\. The MC service server based on the report from the participant, determines
that the UE is not able to receive the media or the QoS requirements is not
satisfied. The MC service server determines to send the MC service media
(e.g., DL media, application layer control signalling) via the unicast
delivery to the reported MC service client.
5\. If the unicast QoS flow is not satisfied, the MC service server interacts
with the 5GC to update the QoS requirements.
6\. The MC service server sends the MC service media via the unicast delivery
towards the MC service client which suffers bad broadcast reception quality.
7\. The MC service client then receives the DL MC service via both broadcast
MBS session and unicast delivery.
###### # 7.3.3.8.2.2.2 Service continuity from unicast to broadcast
The procedure in figure 7.3.3.8.2.2.2-1 illustrates the UE receiving media via
unicast delivery being switched to broadcast MBS session as the UE enters the
broadcast service area where the NG-RAN is broadcasting the MC service media
of the ongoing group communication. The MC service client now is able to
receive the broadcast media. Only one of the receiving MC service clients
receiving the broadcast MBS session is shown.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC group communication is ongoing and the MC service media (e.g., DL
media, application layer control signalling) is transmitted via broadcast MBS
session in the broadcast service areas.
2\. The MC service client is receiving the MC service media (e.g., DL media,
application layer control signalling) via the unicast delivery.
3\. The MC service client has already received the broadcast MBS session
announcement, MapGroupToSessionStream information and enters the broadcast
service area.
Figure 7.3.3.8.2.2.2-1: Service continuity from unicast to broadcast.
1\. An MC service group communication session is ongoing and the broadcast MBS
session is used to deliver the MC service media of the group communication.
The MC service client is receiving the MC service media via the unicast
delivery.
2\. The MC service client detects that it is able to receive the broadcast
media due to e.g., moving into the broadcast service area of the announced MBS
session ID. The MC service client may determine the broadcast reception
quality by using the BLER of the received media. When no media is received,
the quality estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation
and coding scheme (MCS).
3\. The MC service client sends MBS listening status report which indicates
the broadcast reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is
sufficient to receive media. The MC service client may also map the determined
broadcast reception quality to a broadcast reception quality level. The
broadcast reception quality level indicates at which specific broadcast
reception quality level the MC service media has been received.
NOTE 1: The set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the
determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are implementation.
NOTE 2: It is implementation that the broadcast reception quality level can be
determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via
e.g., measurements of radio level signals, such as the reference signals from
the NG-RAN node(s), or packet loss.
4\. Based on the MapGroupToSessionStream received before, the MC service
client receives the DL MC service via both the broadcast MBS session and the
unicast delivery.
NOTE 3: If any information about the broadcast MBS session stream has changed,
the MC service server provides the MapGroupToSessionStream again.
5\. The MC service server, based on the report from the participant,
determines to stop sending the MC service media (e.g., DL media, application
layer control signalling) via the unicast delivery to the reporting MC service
client. After then, the MC service client receives the MC service media only
via the broadcast MBS session.
##### 7.3.3.8.3 Service continuity for multicast MBS session
##### 7.3.3.8.3.1 General {#general-33 .H6}
The MC service server may also switch between multicast and unicast by
utilizing application layer mechanisms similar to switching between broadcast
and unicast as specified in clause 7.3.3.8.2. If indicated in the MBS session
announcement information, the MC service client reports the monitoring state
(i.e., the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the MC service
server.
NOTE: Once the MC service UE has successfully joined the multicast MBS session
and started to receive the MC service media via the multicast MBS session,
then the network mechanism specified in TS 23.247 [15] will deliver the media
from the MC service server via the 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method
or the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery method towards the MC service UE(s).
The usage of 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method or the 5GC Shared MBS
traffic delivery method is transparent to the MC service server.
##### 7.3.3.8.4 Path switch between MBS session and 5G ProSe UE-to-network
relay
###### 7.3.3.8.4.1 General
The MC service communications over 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay is supported
for unicast delivery.
NOTE: In this release of the specification, service continuity is supported
for unicast PDU session over 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay, however it is not
yet supported for multicast/broadcast MBS sessions for MC service
communications.
The path switch procedures for MC service communications between MBS session
and 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay is specified in this clause.
The architecture of MC service utilizing IMS service continuity is specified
in Annex B.
###### 7.3.3.8.4.2 Path switch procedure from MBS session to a 5G ProSe UE-to-
network relay
This clause describes the procedures for path switch from MBS session to a 5G
ProSe UE-to-network relay.
Figure 7.3.3.8.4.2-1 illustrates the path switch procedure from MBS session to
a 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay.
Figure 7.3.3.8.4.2-1: Path switch from MBS session to a 5G ProSe UE-to-network
relay.
1\. The DL media is transmitted over an MBS session to a (remote) MC service
client.
2\. The MC service client sends an MBS listening status report indicating that
the MBS reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is not sufficient
to receive media. The MC service client may also map the determined MBS
reception quality to an MBS reception quality level. The MBS reception quality
level indicates at which specific MBS reception quality level the MC service
media has been received.
3\. The MC service server based on the report from the MC service client
determines that the (remote) MC service UE is unable to receive the media or
the QoS requirements are not satisfied. The MC service server determines to
send the MC service communications (e.g., DL media, application layer control
signalling) via the unicast delivery to the reported MC service client.
4\. The MC service server sends the DL media to the (remote) MC service UE
over a unicast PDU session.
NOTE 1: Steps 2 to 4 may occur after step 6 if the MBS listening status report
towards the MC service server has failed due to connection lost.
5\. The remote MC service UE discovers and utilizes a 5G ProSe UE-to-network
relay UE in its proximity once it has detected being out of the network
coverage. This step applies to both 5G ProSe Layer-3 and Layer-2 UE-to-network
relay.
NOTE 2: An NG-RAN based measurement report triggers the remote MC service UE
to perform a 5G Prose UE-to-Network relay discovery over PC5, as indicated in
3GPP TS 38.331 [19]. The remote MC service UE establishes a secure point-to-
point link with the relay UE in its proximity over PC5. As part of this
process the remote MC service UE is mutually authenticated at PC5 layer with
either the relay or with the network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17].
6\. For the case of 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-network relay without the support
of N3IWF, as described in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17], the remote MC service client
performs SIP re-registration over the relay UE due to the change in IP address
of the remote MC service UE and initiates IMS service continuity procedures as
described in Annex B.
NOTE 3: For the case of 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network relay with the support
of N3IWF, the relay UE performs registration and authentication procedures
towards the 5GC to support the remote MC service UE with an end-to-end
confidentiality and IP address reservation requirements, as described in 3GPP
TS 23.304 [17].
NOTE 4: For the case of 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-network relay, the 5GC can
provide the service continuity for the remote MC service UE with the UE\'s
original IP address, as described in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17].
7\. The MC service server sends the MC service communications using the
unicast delivery via the 5G ProSe MC service UE-to-Network relay UE towards
the remote MC service client. The MC service client then receives the DL MC
service communication via the relay UE.
###### 7.3.3.8.4.3 Path switch from a 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay to MBS
session
This clause describes the procedure for path switch from a 5G ProSe UE-to-
network relay to MBS session.
Figure 7.3.3.8.4.3-1 illustrates path switch from a 5G ProSe UE-to-network
relay to MBS session.
Figure 7.3.3.8.4.3-1 Path switch from a 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay to MBS
session.
1\. The remote MC service client is receiving the MC service media using the
unicast delivery via a 5G ProSe UE-to-Network relay UE. This step applies to
both 5G ProSe Layer 3 and Layer 2 UE-to-network relay.
2\. Based on the (remote) MC service UE`s path selection policies described in
3GPP TS 23.304 [17], and once the NG-RAN based measurement report discussed in
3GPP TS 38.331 [19] is triggered due to network coverage detection,the
(remote) MC service UE connects to the network via the Uu-interface.
NOTE 1: The path selection policies may be pre-configured in the MC service UE
or provided by the PCF, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17].
3\. For the case of 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-network relay without the support
of N3IWF, the (remote) MC service client performs SIP re-registration over Uu
and initiates the IMS service continuity procedures as described in Annex B.
Further, the MC service server sends MC service communications using unicast
delivery which traverses over Uu to the remote MC service client.
NOTE 2: For the case of 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-network relay via the support
of N3IWF, the (remote) MC service UE performs registration procedures towards
the 5GS to establish the necessary resources over the Uu-interface.
NOTE 3: For the case of 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-network relay, the 5GC can
provide the service continuity for the (remote) MC service UE with the UE\'s
original IP address, as described in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17].
4\. The MC service client receives the MC service communication over a unicast
PDU session.
5\. Optionally, the MC service server may send the MBS session announcement to
the (remote) MC service client with the information of the MBS session.
NOTE 4: The information of the MBS session can be available at the (remote) MC
service client due to a previous MC service signalling via the relay UE.
6a. If a multicast MBS session has been announced, the MC service UE performs
a UE session join towards the 5GC using the MBS session information, and the
MC service client may send a UE session join notification towards the server.
6b. If a broadcast MBS session has been announced, the MC service client start
monitoring the reception quality of the broadcast MBS session.
7\. The MC service client sends an MBS listening status report which indicates
the MBS reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is sufficient to
receive media.
NOTE 4: It is implementation specific whether the MBS session reception
quality level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS
flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the
reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.
8\. Based on the report received from MC service client in step 7, the MC
service server determines to stop sending the MC service communications (e.g.,
DL media, application layer control signalling) using the unicast delivery.
Further, the MC server sends the MC service communications via the MBS
session.
9\. The MC service client receives the MC service communications from the MC
service server via the MBS session.
#### 7.3.3.9 MC service inter-system switching between 5G and LTE
##### 7.3.3.9.1 General
When working in transport only mode, the MC service server guides the MC
service clients throughout the MC media transmission for switching between the
LTE and 5G systems. For this purpose, the location management client sends
location related information to the location management server, similar to the
one defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], which is triggered due to its location
change -- in this case due to Radio Access Technology (RAT) change, to inform
the server hence the latter provides guidance related to how to receive the MC
services after the location update.
The procedures cover both the deployment scenarios with/without MBSF/MBSTF.
The procedures specify four inter-system switching related scenarios as
follows:
1\. Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS bearer, as in
7.3.3.9.2
2\. Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast bearer, as in
7.3.3.9.3
3\. Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G MBS session, as in 7.3.3.9.4
4\. Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G unicast PDU session, as in
7.3.3.9.5
In all the inter-system switching related scenario described in 7.3.3.9.2,
7.3.3.9.3, 7.3.3.9.4 and 7.3.3.9.5, the functional entity that resides in 5GS
may be NEF, or MBSF, or MB-SMF for session creation and together with PCF or
PCC related interaction.
NOTE: There will be a service interrupt when the MC service server performs
path switch between 5G and LTE bearers or sessions.
##### 7.3.3.9.2 Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS bearer
The procedure provided in figure 7.3.3.9.2-1 describes how the MC service
server handles inter-system switching when the MC service UE switches from 5G
to LTE network, where the MC service server is able to provide the MC services
to the clients over eMBMS bearer(s).
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to
the same MC service group X.
\- The MC services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.
\- The MC service client(s) is within the eMBMS service area.
\- It is assumed that the MC service client(s) has not received the eMBMS
bearer announcement while camping in 5GS.
Figure 7.3.3.9.2-1: Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS
bearer.
1\. An MC service group communication takes place, and the MC media is
delivered over 5G MBS session (either broadcast or multicast session mode),
which is associated to the MC service group X.
2\. The MC service UE performs handover to EPS.
3\. Location information handling can be based on location reports provided by
the MC service client, where the MC service UE`s location information is
provided via the location management client, triggered by RAT change, to the
location management server, where the latter provides the location information
to the MC service server.
Also, location information handling can be based on notifications provided
from the network to the MC service server related to 5GS supporting EPS
interworking, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10], and
3GPP TS 23.503 [9] and described in clause 7.4.3. For that, the MC service
server can subscribe to receive notifications of specific events from the
network. For instance, the MC service server can subscribe to PCF related
notifications (via N5 or Rx) for specific events, e.g., access network
information notification and change of access type. Also, when SCEF+NEF is
deployed, the MC service server can subscribe to SCEF+NEF related
notifications for specific events, e.g., core network (CN) type change.
4\. The MC service server analyses the location information and decides how to
serve the client. If the MC service server decides to serve the client via
eMBMS bearer, it may send an eMBMS bearer announcement as described in 3GPP TS
23.280 [3]. This step is optional as the bearer announcement related
information could be sent in advance (implementation specific).
5\. If not already available, the MC service client stores the announced
TMGI(s), service area, and any relevant information to the eMBMS, which is
delivered via the bearer announcement. As a result, the MC service client
starts monitoring the bearer.
6\. The MC service client sends an eMBMS listening status report to inform the
server of its ability of receiving MC media over the specified bearer.
7\. The MC server sends the necessary information related to receiving the MC
media in the form of the MapGroupToBearer.
8\. The MC service group communication takes place over EPS, and the MC media
is transmitted over an eMBMS bearer.
##### 7.3.3.9.3 Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast
bearer
The procedure provided in figure 7.3.3.9.3-1 describes how the MC service
server handles inter-system switching when the MC service UE switches from 5G
to LTE network, where the MC service server is unable to provide the MC
services to the client over eMBMS bearer.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to
the same MC service group X.
\- The MC services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.
Figure 7.3.3.9.3-1: Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast
bearer.
1\. An MC service group communication takes place, and the MC media is
delivered over 5G MBS session (either broadcast or multicast session mode),
which is associated to the MC service group X.
2\. The MC service UE performs handover to EPS.
3\. Location information handling can be based on location reports provided by
the MC service client, where the MC service UE`s location information is
provided via the location management client, triggered by RAT change, to the
location management server, where the latter provides the location information
to the MC service server.
Also, location information handling can be based on notifications provided
from the network to the MC service server related to 5GS supporting EPS
interworking, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10], and
3GPP TS 23.503 [9] and described in clause 7.4.3. For that, the MC service
server can subscribe to receive notifications of specific events from the
network. For instance, the MC service server can subscribe to PCF related
notifications (via N5 or Rx) for specific events, e.g. access network
information notification and change of access type. Also, when SCEF+NEF is
deployed, the MC service server can subscribe to SCEF+NEF related
notifications for specific events, e.g. core network (CN) type change.
4\. The MC service server may interact with the EPC for providing the required
media resources over the unicast bearer, if not already allocated.
5\. The MC service group communication takes place over EPS, and the MC media
is transmitted over a unicast bearer.
##### 7.3.3.9.4 Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G MBS session
The procedure provided in figure 7.3.3.9.4-1 describes how the MC service
server handles inter-system switching when the MC service UE switches from LTE
network to 5G, where the MC service server is able to provide the MC services
to the client over 5G MBS sessions (either broadcast or multicast).
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the EPC and affiliated to the same MC
service group X.
\- The MC services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.
\- The MC service client(s) is within the service area (if the session is
limited to an area), where the MBS session is configured.
\- It is assumed that the MC service client(s) has not received the 5G MBS
session announcement while camping in EPS.

information notification and change of access type. Also, when SCEF+NEF is
deployed, the MC service server can subscribe to SCEF+NEF related
notifications for specific events, e.g., core network (CN) type change.
4\. The MC service server analyses the location information and decides how to
serve the client. If the MC service server decides to serve the client via 5G
MBS session, it may send an MBS session announcement indicating information
among others the session mode to serve the MC service client and the
corresponding MBS session ID. This step is optional as the session
announcement related information could be sent in advance (implementation
specific).
5\. The MC service UE acts according to the MBS session mode provided to
receive the DL media.
5a. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service UE performs a UE session
join towards the 5GC indicating the MBS session ID to join. It may as well
send a UE session join acknowledgement to the MC service server.
5b. In case of broadcast MBS sessions, the MC service UE starts monitoring the
broadcast MBS session.
6\. The MC service client sends an MBS listening status report to the server
indicating its ability to receive media over the indicated MBS session.

to the client over 5G MBS sessions (either broadcast or multicast).
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the EPC and affiliated to the same MC
service group X.
\- The MC services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.
Figure 7.3.3.9.5-1: Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS bearer to 5G unicast
PDU session.
1\. An MC service group communication takes place, and the MC media is
delivered over eMBMS bearer, which is associated to the MC service group X.
2\. The MC service UE performs handover to 5GS.
3\. Location information handling can be based on location reports provided by
the MC service client, where the MC service UE`s location information is
provided via the location management client, triggered by RAT change, to the
location management server, where the latter provides the location information
to the MC service server.
Also, location information handling can be based on notifications provided
from the network to the MC service server related to 5GS supporting EPS
interworking, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10], and
3GPP TS 23.503 [9] and described in clause 7.4.3. For that, the MC service
server can subscribe to receive notifications of specific events from the

(if not already allocated) with specific requirements over unicast PDU
session, as it is able to serve the MC service client via unicast PDU session,
as described in clause 7.2.
5\. The MC service group communication takes place over 5GS, and the MC media
is delivered over unicast PDU session.
#### 7.3.3.10 MBS transmission in MCPTT
##### 7.3.3.10.1 General
MCPTT server can determine to use 5G MBS for the transmission of downlink
media for different types of MCPTT group calls.
The application layer signalling such as the floor control messages,
application layer paging messages may be transmitted along with the MC media
over the same MBS session however with different QoS requirements, or over
other means such as unicast downlink or a different MBS session.
When using the procedures for pre-configured or dynamic MBS session
establishment for MCPTT, the MCPTT server performs the procedure of call
connect and disconnect over MBS session at the group communication session
establishment phase.
##### 7.3.3.10.2 Call connect and disconnect over MBS session procedures
##### 7.3.3.10.2.1 General {#general-37 .H6}
MBS session can be used for MCPTT group calls. One MBS session may be not
permanently associated to one specific group or group call.
NOTE: It is implementation-specific that one MBS session can be re-assigned to
different groups, or is associated to only one group.
The procedure in clause 7.3.3.10.2 requires that the group session is setup
before the media transmission starts. This eliminates the need for the
receiving clients to continuously use a unicast session. Prior to this, the
MBS session is activated and announced to the MCPTT clients.
##### 7.3.3.10.2.2 Procedure {#procedure-5 .H6}
##### 7.3.3.10.2.2.1 Group call connect over MBS session {#group-call-connect-
over-mbs-session .H6}
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCPTT clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated
to the same MCPTT group X.
\- The MCPTT server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF
discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally
configured.
\- The MCPTT server has decided to use an MBS session for the MCPTT service
group call associated with to the MCPTT group X.
Figure 7.3.3.10.2.2.1-1: Group call connect over broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions.
1\. An MBS session is configured with the required QoS requirements announced
and established.
NOTE: In case of broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established as part of
session configuration procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. In case
of multicast MBS sessions, the session is established as specified in step 2.
2\. In the case of multicast MBS sessions, the MCPTT UE initiates a UE session
join towards the 5GS, based on the session information provided to the MCPTT
UE during the session announcement step. This step is essential in order to
receive the corresponding MC media. The multicast MBS session is hence
established once the first initiated UE session join is accepted as indicated
in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
3\. MCPTT client 1 initiates a group call by sending an initial floor request
over a unicast PDU session towards the MCPTT server.
4\. The MCPTT server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream including the necessary
stream information for the MCPTT clients 2 to n to receive the MC media
related to the group call which is taken place within the associated MBS
session.
5\. The MCPTT clients 2 to n process the MapGroupToSessionStream information
and may send a MapGroupToSessionStream Ack back to the MCPTT server if
required.
6\. The MCPTT server grants MCPTT client 1 the right to transmit media over
the associated MBS session and sends a floor granted message to client 1 over
a unicast PDU session.
7\. A floor taken message is sent from the MCPTT server to MCPTT clients 2 to
n indicating the MCPTT ID of the transmitting client, i.e., MCPTT client 1 and
the associated MCPTT group ID. The floor taken message is transmitted over the
associated MBS session.
8\. MCPTT client 1 sends the MC media over uplink unicast PDU session towards
the MCPTT server.
9\. The MCPTT server sends the MC media over the indicated stream within the
associated MBS session to the MCPTT clients 2 to n.

MBS sessions.
1\. The MC group communication is taking place over the associated MBS
session. MCPTT client 1 is sending the MC media over a unicast PDU session to
the MCPTT server.
2\. The MCPTT server sends the MC media over the associated MBS session to
MCPTT clients 2 to n.
3\. After the MC media transmission is over, i.e., no further media to be sent
over the group communication, the MCPTT server sends an
UnMapGroupFromSessionStream to de-associate the group call from the MBS
session.
4\. The MCPTT server may release the MBS session as described in clause
7.3.3.3.2.
##### 7.3.3.10.3 Enhanced MCPTT group call setup procedure with 5MBS
Enhanced MCPTT group call setup procedure with eMBMS bearer is specified in
clause 10.10.6 of 3GPP TS 23.379 [6]. When using mission critical services
over 5G MBS, the application paging message transported over 5G MBS session
should also be supported.
The related procedures and information flow is as specified in 3GPP TS 23.379
[6], with only difference of using of 5G MBS session for the transmission of
application paging message.

session, or dynamic MBS session as specified clause 7.3.3.1.
MCPTT may use MBS session for the different types of MCPTT group calls. Both
pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls can use the pre-created 5G MBS
session for distributing the media.
Both the media packets as well as the floor control messages to the receiving
users are sent on the 5G MBS session. Optionally a separate 5G MBS session
could be used for the floor control messages.

eMBMS bearer, and LTE unicast bearer for MCPTT
The MCPTT service shall support the procedure for switching between 5G MBS
session, 5G unicast PDU session, LTE eMBMS bearer and LTE unicast bearer as
specified in clause 7.3.3.8 and clause 7.3.3.9 with the following
clarifications:
\- The MC service client is the MCPTT client;
\- The MC service server is the MCPTT server; and
\- The MC service ID is the MCPTT ID.
The MCPTT service shall use the MCPTT-1, MCPTT-4, MCPTTâ€‘7, MCPTT-8 and MCPTTâ€‘9
reference points for this procedure.
#### 7.3.3.11 MBS transmission in MCVideo
##### 7.3.3.11.1 General
MCVideo server can determine to use 5G MBS for the transmission of DL link
media for different types of MCVideo group calls.
The application layer signalling such as the transmit media request and
transmit media granted messages, may be transmitted along with the MC media
over the same MBS session however with different QoS requirements, or over
other means such as unicast downlink or a different MBS session.

points for this procedure.
##### 7.3.3.11.2 Call connect and disconnect over MBS session procedures
##### 7.3.3.11.2.1 General {#general-39 .H6}
MBS session can be used for MCVideo group calls. One MBS session may not be
permanently associated to one specific group or group call.
NOTE: It is implementation-specific that one MBS session can be re-assigned to
different groups, or is associated to only one group.
The procedure in clause 7.3.3.11.2.2 requires that the group session is setup
before the media transmission start. This eliminates the need for the
receiving clients to continuously use a unicast session. Prior to this the MBS
session is activated and announced to the MCVideo clients.
##### 7.3.3.11.2.2 Procedure {#procedure-6 .H6}

MCDataâ€‘DS-3 reference points for this procedure.
##### 7.3.3.12.4 Group communication connect and disconnect over MBS session
procedures
###### 7.3.3.12.4.1 General
MBS session can be used for MCData group communication. One MBS session may be
not permanently associated to one specific group or group communication.
NOTE: It is implementation-specific that one MBS session can be re-assigned to
different groups, or is associated to only one group.
The procedure in clause 7.3.3.12.4 requires that the group session is setup
before the data transmission starts. This eliminates the need for the
receiving clients to continuously use a unicast session. Prior to group
session setup, the MBS session is activated and announced to the MCData
clients.
###### 7.3.3.12.4.2 Procedure
The procedure specified in this clause is applicable (for the group
communication establishment) for Group standalone short data service using
media plane as described in clause 7.4.2.6 in 3GPP TS 23.282 [5] and for Group
short data service session as described in clause 7.4.2.7 in 3GPP TS 23.282
[5].
###### # 7.3.3.12.4.2.1 Group communication connect over MBS session
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCData clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same MCData group X.
\- The MCData server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF
discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally
configured.
\- The MCData server has decided to use an MBS session for the MCData service
group communication associated with to the MCData group X.
Figure 7.3.3.12.4.2.1-1: Group communication connect over broadcast and
multicast MBS sessions.
1\. An MBS session is configured with the required QoS requirements announced
and established.
NOTE 1: In case of broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established as part
of session configuration procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15]. In
case of multicast MBS sessions, the session is established as specified in
step 2.
2\. In the case of multicast MBS sessions, the MCData UE initiates a UE
session join towards the 5GS based on the session information provided to the
MCData UE during the session announcement step. This step 2 is essential in
order to receive the corresponding MC media. The multicast MBS session is
hence established once the first initiated UE session join is accepted as
indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [15].
3\. The MCData client 1 initiates a group communication by sending a MCData
group data request over a unicast PDU session towards the MCData server.
4\. MCData server initiates the MCData group data request towards each MCData
clients 2 to n.
5\. The receiving MCData clients 2 to n optionally notify the user about the
incoming MCData session data request.
6\. The receiving MCData client 2 to n accept or reject the MCData group data
request and the corresponding result is in the MCData group data response
towards MCData server.
7\. The MCData server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream including the necessary
stream information for the MCData clients 2 to n to receive the MC data
related to the group communication which is taken place within the associated
MBS session.
8\. The MCData clients 2 to n process the MapGroupToSessionStream information
and may send a MapGroupToSessionStream Ack back to the MCData server if
required.
9\. MCData server forwards the MCData group data response received from MCData
client 2 to n to the MCData user initiating the MCData session data request.
NOTE 2: The steps 4 to 6 and steps 7 to 8 can occur in any order, and prior to
step 10 depending on the conditions to proceed with the data transmission.
10\. MCData client 1 sends the MC data over uplink unicast PDU session towards
the MCData server.
11\. The MCData server sends the MC data over the indicated stream within the
associated MBS session to the MCData clients 2 to n.
###### # 7.3.3.12.4.2.2 Group communication disconnect from MBS session
Figure 7.3.3.12.4.2.2-1 presents the procedure for a group communication
disconnect over broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.
Figure 7.3.3.12.4.2.2-1: Group communication disconnect over broadcast and
multicast MBS sessions.
1\. The MC group communication is taking place over the associated MBS
session. MCData client 1 is sending the MC data over a unicast PDU session to
the MCData server.
2\. The MCData server sends the MC data over the associated MBS session to
MCData clients 2 to n.
3\. After the MC data transmission is over, i.e., no further data to be sent
over the group communication, the MCData server sends an
UnMapGroupFromSessionStream to de-associate the group communication from the
MBS session.
4\. The MCData server may release the MBS session as described in clause
7.3.3.3.2.
##### 7.3.3.12.5 Downlink media transmission with 5MBS
The MCData service shall support the procedure for using pre-established MBS
session, or dynamic MBS session as specified in clause 7.3.3.1.
MCData may use MBS session for the different types of sub-services. Both SDS
and FD can use the pre-established MBS session or dynamic MBS session for
distributing the data.
#### 7.3.3.13 Use of FEC to protect 5G MBS transmissions
##### 7.3.3.13.1 General
Application layer FEC can be used to recover the packet losses when delivering
a MC service over 5G MBS, to reach its required level of QoS.
The support of FEC is optional for the MC service servers and MC service
clients. FEC can be optionally applied by the MBSTF, if required by the MC
service server (as specified in clause 7.3.3.13.2), or directly by the MC
service server (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3]).
##### 7.3.3.13.2 FEC encoding by the MBSTF
In this procedure, depicted in figure 7.3.3.13.2-1, the MC service server asks
the MBSF/MBSTF to apply FEC to a set of media, transported by a 5G MBS
session, using the Setup FEC request.
This procedure can be applied when using pre-created MBS session and session
announcement (as specified in clause 7.3.3.1.2) or using MBS session and
session announcement (as specified in clause 7.3.3.1.3).
Pre-condition:
1\. The MC service server has already configured and activated a 5G MBS
session.
Figure 7.3.3.13.2-1: Application of FEC by the MBSF-MBSTF
1\. The MC service server decides to set up FEC for a set of MC service media
flows. It will send the FEC request to MBSF/MBSTF.
It includes the following elements: the MBS session ID of the MBS session
transporting those media, the media descriptions (codecs, transport protocols,
bitrates, destination IP addresses and ports), the identification of the FEC
repair packet flow (IP destination and port), and an upper bound to the
additional latency resulting due to FEC application. The MC Service server may
perform this request several times to protect separately different sets of
media transported within the same 5G MBS session.
2\. If the MBSF can satisfy the request, the Setup FEC response includes a
modified list of media information and FEC information. The response also
includes an identifier of the corresponding FEC process instance, which can be
used to release the application of FEC for these media flows.
NOTE 1: Source media packets may be modified by the application of FEC (e.g.,
addition of a footer or header), leading to a modification of the delivery
protocol to be announced within the media information.
NOTE 2: The Release FEC request is not shown in the figure.
3\. The MC service server announces the 5G MBS session to the MC service
client with the MBS session announcement procedure, including the modified
list of media information and FEC information within the SDP information.
4\. When the MC service server decides to transmit the MC service media flow
for a group communication, the MC service server sends to the group a message
identifying the MC service media flow and the MBS session ID, such as the
MapGroupToSessionStream message for MCPTT or MCVideo.
5\. The MC service server sends the downlink media to the MBSTF over Nmb8.
6\. The MBSTF performs FEC encoding of the downlink media in accordance with
the announced FEC algorithm and parameters and delivers it over 5G MBS.
7\. The MC service client performs FEC decoding of the encoded media flows in
accordance with the announced FEC information and delivers the decoded flows
to the media player.
## 7.4 MC services over 5GS supporting EPS interworking
### 7.4.1 General
MC services over a 5G system supporting EPS interworking are provided to
5GS/EPS capable MC service UEs as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], 3GPP TS
23.502 [10], and 3GPP TS 23.503 [9].
This clause describes procedures related to the support of MC services over a
5G system with EPS interworking.
### 7.4.2 Inter-system mobility
As specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], a dedicated user plane anchor point, i.e.
UPF + PGW-U function, is defined for interworking between 5GS and EPS. This
enables that the network can directly handle PDU sessions (in 5GS) and PDN
connections (in EPS) associated to MC service sessions of an MC service UE
during inter-system change.
The inter-system change of an MC service UE will be transparent to the MC
service server. The MC service server will continue interacting with the same
control plane functions, e.g. PCF, and user plane function, e.g. UPF + PGW-U.
NOTE 1: For the case that seamless session continuity is required for MC
services, e.g. for MCPTT services, EPS interworking with N26 (interface
between AMF in 5GC and MME in EPC) is required for inter-system change, as
described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7].
The procedure in figure 7.4.2-1 describes in a high level inter-system
mobility of 5GS/EPS capable MC service UEs with associated MC service
sessions.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service UE is a 5GS/EPS capable UE.
\- MC service UE is registered to a 5GS supporting EPS interworking for the
support of MC services.
Figure 7.4.2-1: MC services over 5GS with EPS interworking -- Inter-system
mobility
1\. MC service UE is registered to the MC service server over the 5GS. MC
service UE has established a PDU session(s) associated to MC service sessions.
2\. The 5GS supporting EPS interworking decides that the MC service UE should
be handed over to EPS, e.g. due to radio conditions. 5GS handles associated
PDU sessions of the MC service UE to establish corresponding PDN connections
in EPS, i.e. required default and dedicated EPS bearers associated to MC
service sessions.
NOTE 2: The interworking procedures with EPS are described in 3GPP TS 23.501
[7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10], and 3GPP TS 23.503 [9].
3\. MC service UE is registered on EPS. MC services continue being provided to
the MC service UE over EPS via the established PDN connections (default and
dedicated bearers associated to corresponding MC service sessions) in step 2.
### 7.4.3 Network notifications of EPS interworking related events
In the case of MC services provided over a 5GS supporting EPS interworking,
the MC service server may not be able to identify whether an MC service UE is
registered on 5GS or EPS. Therefore, the MC service server can
subscribe/unsubscribe to receive notifications of specific events from the
network. These notifications can be related to PDU sessions/PDN connections to
which MC service sessions are bounded or related to a specific MC service UE
or group of MC service UEs.
Such notifications can be provided from the PCF (via N5 or Rx) for specific
events, e.g. access network information notification and change of access
type. If SCEF+NEF is deployed, notifications can also be provided from
SCEF+NEF for specific events, e.g. core network (CN) type change. The
specification of these event procedures are described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7],
3GPP TS 23.502 [10], and 3GPP TS 23.503 [9].
The procedure in figure 7.4.3-1 describes a high level
subscription/notification procedure between the MC service server and the
network.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service UE is a 5GS/EPS capable UE.
\- MC service UE is registered to a 5GS supporting EPS interworking for the
support of MC services.
Figure 7.4.3-1: Network notifications of EPS interworking related events
1\. MC service UE is registered to the MC service server over the 5GS. MC
service UE has established a PDU session(s) associated to MC service sessions.
2\. MC service server subscribes to receive notifications from the network
associated to MC service UE related to EPS interworking events. For instance,
the MC service server may subscribe to notifications of events from the PCF
associated to the MC service UE, e.g. access network information notification
and change of access type, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.503 [9].
If SCEF+NEF is deployed, the MC service server may also subscribe to
notifications of events from SCEF+NEF associated to the MC service UE, e.g. CN
type change, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [10].
3\. The 5GS supporting EPS interworking decides that the MC service UE should
be handed over to EPS, e.g. due to radio conditions. 5GS handles associated
PDU sessions of the MC service UE to establish corresponding PDN connections
in EPS, i.e. required default and dedicated EPS bearers associated to MC
service sessions.
NOTE 1: The interworking procedures with EPS are described in 3GPP TS 23.501
[7], 3GPP TS 23.502 [10], and 3GPP TS 23.503 [9].
4\. MC service UE is registered on EPS. MC services continue being provided to
the MC service UE over EPS via the established PDN connections (default and
dedicated bearers associated to corresponding MC service sessions) in step 2.
5\. The network provides notifications to the MC service server of subscribed
events associated to the MC service UE.
NOTE 2: Step 5 can occur before or in parallel to step 4.
## 7.5 Enhancements for Location management over 5GS
### 7.5.1 General
In addition to the location management functions defined in 3GPP TS 23.280
[3], the location management system over 5GS shall support the following
enhancement:
\- Inter-system RAT changes event triggering and report as described in clause
7.3.3.9.1.
\- Serving and neighbouring 5G NR Cell Global Identifiers (NCGI) as optional
Location Information elements in the information flows of 3GPP TS 23.280 [3]

### 7.5.3 Procedure
#### 7.5.3.1 General
In this clause, only the procedure which requires enhancement to 3GPP TS
23.280 [3] for MC services over 5G specific are included.
#### 7.5.3.2 Event-triggered location reporting procedure
NOTE 1: This procedure is valid for single MC system operation only.
The location management server provides location reporting configuration to
the location management clients, indicating what information the location
management server expects and what events will trigger the sending of this
information to the location management server. For eMBMS and MBS co-existing,
the MC service server needs to obtain the inter-RAT information. If the inter-
RAT information report from the MC service UE is expected, the MC service
server may obtain the inter-RAT information from the location management
server, and the location management server then performs the procedure as
described clause 10.9.3.1 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], clause 7.5.2.2 and 7.5.2.3.
In addition to those trigger criteria defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], the new
inter-RAT triggers may include, the change of MBS FSA ID, inter-system RAT
type changes. The location information report contains the inter- RAT
information.
NOTE 2: How the location management client can identify or obtain information
about the case that an inter-RAT change has occurred is implementation
specific or out of the scope of this specification.
Similar to the usage of eMBMS bearer for transmitting of location reporting
configuration defined in TS 23.280, the location reporting configuration
message can also be sent over 5G MBS Session.
## 7.6 MC service over 5G ProSe
### 7.6.1 Off network group communication for MC service
The procedures and information flows used in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], 3GPP TS
23.379 [6], 3GPP TS 23.281 [4], and 3GPP TS 23.282 [5] are reused for Off
network group communication for MC service over 5G ProSe with following
differences:
> \- Discovery Group ID is replaced by Application Layer Group ID, as
> specified in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17].
>
> \- The ProSe Layer-2 Group ID of the target MC service group may be used by
> the ProSe layer as the target group info;
>
> \- The Groupcast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication procedure in clause
> 6.4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.304 [17] is utilized for the establishment of off-
> network group communication and the following media plane traffic exchanges.
### 7.6.2 Off-network private communication
The procedures and information flows used in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], 3GPP TS
23.379 [6], 3GPP TS 23.281 [4], and 3GPP TS 23.282 [5] are reused for
offâ€‘network private communication for MC service over 5G ProSe with following
differences:
\- PPPP (ProSe Per-Packet Priority) is replaced with PQI, as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.304 [17].
\- The ProSe discovery group ID is replaced with Application layer group ID
which identifies a discovery group as specified in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17]. The
Application layer group ID and the user info ID of the target MC service user
are provisioned to the MC service client in the MC service user profile. The
MC service client enables the ProSe layer to determine the IP address for the
communication with the target MC service user by providing the Application
layer group ID and user info ID of the target MC service user.
\- Group Member Discovery procedure in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17] is utilized to
enable for the call initiator to determine whether the called MC service user
is in the proximity of the calling user prior to the establishment of an off-
network private communication.
\- The Unicast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication procedure in 3GPP TS 23.304
[17] is utilized for the establishment of off-network private communication
and the following media plane traffic exchanges.
### 7.6.3 Use of 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay
#### 7.6.3.1 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay service authorization
The MC service shall support the capability for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay
to restrict the relayed group communication on a per group basis by using the
relay service codes corresponding to the group.
5G ProSe (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17]) supports layer 2 UE-to-network
relay and layer 3 UE-to-network relay. The procedure defined in clause 10.5 of
3GPP TS 23.280 [3] applies with the following differences:
\- 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay is provisioned that each relay service code is
offering layer 2 or layer 3 UE-to-Network Relay service.
\- 5G ProSe remote UE is provisioned that each relay service code is offering
layer 2 or layer 3 UE-to-Network Relay service.
\- 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-network relay is provisioned with suitable relay
service codes to support access to N3IWF for the case of 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-
to-network relay with the support of N3IWF.
#### 7.6.3.2 UE-to-network relay MC service
The 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay provides a layer 2 or layer 3 routing service
(as specified in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17]) for a 5G ProSe remote UE, when the MC
service user on the 5G ProSe remote UE requires to access the MC service via a
5G ProSe UE-to-network relay.
The application layer signalling for the MC service user on a 5G ProSe remote
UE using a 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay are identical to the application layer
signalling for the MC service user on an on-network UE.

This Annex provides information about the static data needed for configuration
of MC services encompassing the following category:
\- Initial MC service UE configuration data (see subclause A.2).
Each parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through
one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline
shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent
configuration data made available to the MC service UE shall always overwrite
previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data

shall be used, along with the S-NSSAI to be used for each MC service;
\- The Default Configured slice(s) information may be pre-configured at the MC
service UE and be utilized as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7];
NOTE: It is up to UE implementation, whether an S-NSSAI value is included in
the Requested NSSAI. If not included, the corresponding MC traffic could be
handled according to the URSP rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor.
\- Additional MC network slice identification information may be provided for
each S-NSSAI, e.g., the corresponding network slice credentials.
# A.3 MC service user profile configuration data

following exceptions:
\- \"Default PQI (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.304 [17]) values\" instead of
\"Default ProSe Per-Packet priority (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7])
values\" shall be used;
###### ## Annex B (informative): Service continuity for MC service
# B.1 Service continuity between on-network MC service and UE-to-network relay
MC service
This annex describes how 3GPP TS 23.237 [18] mechanisms for IMS service
continuity can be used to provide service continuity between on-network MC
service and UE-to-network relay MC service.
Figure B.1-1: Service continuity from on-network to UE-to-network relay
The details of MBS interfaces are specified in clause 4.7. The interaction
between SIP core and 5GC is specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [2]. The procedure for
service continuity from on-network MCPTT service to UE-to-network relay MCPTT
service is described in Annex B of 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].
As illustrated in figure B.1-1:
\- Initially UE-1 has a direct connection to the network via 5GS (on-network
MCPTT service). It is registered with the SIP core and is engaged in a SIP
session with the MCPTT Application Server (solid lines SIP-1 and MC[service]-1
in figure B.1-1).
\- When UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network, or after
the connection to the network has been lost, UE-1 discovers a UE-to-network
relay (UE-R) and establishes a PC5 connection with UE-R. UE-1 registers with
the SIP core over the target access leg and enters UE-to-network relay MC
service by transferring the media streams over the target leg (dashed lines
SIP-1 and MC[service]-1 in figure B.1-1).
\- The SIP session is anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity
Application Server (SCC AS) before and after the handover, as described in
3GPP TS 23.237 [18].
