layer are location management, group management, configuration management,
identity management, key management and network resource management. The V2X
application specific layer consists of the V2X application specific
functionalities.
NOTE 1: The functionalities of the V2X application specific layer are out of
scope of the present document.
The V2X application server consists of the VAE server, the SEAL servers and
the V2X application specific server. The VAE server provides the V2X
application layer support functions to the V2X application specific server
over Vs reference point. The SEAL server(s) provide the SEAL services to the
V2X application specific server over SEAL‑S reference point.
The V2X UEs consist of the VAE client, the SEAL clients and the V2X
application specific client. The VAE client provides the V2X application layer
support functions to the V2X application specific client over Vc reference
point. The SEAL client(s) provide the SEAL services to the V2X application
specific client over SEAL‑C reference point.
NOTE 2: In some deployments, the client and server entities of SEAL can be
part of VAE client and VAE server respectively.
The VAE client acts as a VAL client for its interaction with the SEAL clients
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6]. The VAE server acts as a VAL server for
its interaction with the SEAL servers as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].
In the VAE layer, the VAE client communicates with the VAE server over V1-AE
reference point. In the V2X application specific layer, the V2X application
specific client communicates with V2X application specific server over V1-APP
reference point.
NOTE 3: The V1-APP reference point is out of scope of the present document.
In the VAE layer, the VAE client of V2X UE2 communicates with VAE client of
V2X UE1 over V5-AE reference point. In the V2X application specific layer, the
V2X application specific client of V2X UE2 communicates with VAE client of V2X
UE1 over V5-APP reference point.

The VAE client interacts with SEAL clients over the SEAL-C reference point
specified for each SEAL service. The VAE server interacts with SEAL servers
over the SEAL-S reference point specified for each SEAL service. The
interaction between the SEAL clients is supported by SEAL-PC5 reference point
specified for each SEAL service. The interaction between a SEAL client and the
corresponding SEAL server is supported by SEAL-UU reference point specified
for each SEAL service.
NOTE 5: The SEAL-C, SEAL-S, SEAL-PC5, SEAL-UU reference points for each SEAL
service is specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].
To support distributed VAE server deployments, the VAE server interacts with
another VAE server over VAE-E reference point.
V2X UE1 can also act as a UE-to-network relay,
\- to enable VAE client on V2X UE2 to access VAE server over V1-AE reference
point; and
\- to enable V2X application specific client on V2X UE2 to access V2X
application specific server over V1-APP reference point.
A V1-AE message can be sent over unicast, transparent multicast via xMB,
transparent multicast via MB2. The non-transparent multicast via xMB (as
specified in 3GPP TS 26.348 [11]) is triggered by a V1-AE message. Multicast
distribution can be supported by both transparent and non-transparent
multicast modes.
The VAE server interacts with the 3GPP network system over V2, MB2, xMB, Rx,
T8, N5 and N33 reference points. The EPS and 5GS are considered as the 3GPP
network system.

A centralized deployment is where a single VAE server offers the VAE
capabilities to one or more V2X application specific server. The VAE server
and the V2X application specific server may be co-located in a single physical
entity. The VAE server may be deployed either in the PLMN operator domain or
deployed in the V2X service provider domain. The VAE server connects with the
3GPP network systems (EPS, 5GS) in one or more PLMN operator domain. When VAE
server and V2X application specific server are co-located in a single physical
entity, the Vs reference point between the VAE server and the V2X application
enabler server may not be used.
Figure 7.2.1-1 illustrates a deployment of the VAE server and the V2X
application specific server in a single physical entity and deployed in V2X
service provider domain. The VAE server may be deployed in a separate physical
entity from the V2X application specific server in the V2X service provider
domain. In such deployments, the Vs reference point is used for the
communication between the VAE server and the V2X application specific server.

# 8 Identities
## 8.1 V2X user identity (V2X user ID)
The V2X user ID can be an instance of the VAL user ID as specified in 3GPP TS
23.434 [6]. The V2X user ID is a globally unique identifier within the V2X
service that represents the V2X user. The V2X user ID shall be a URI. The V2X
user ID is used for authentication and authorization purposes for providing
the V2X service towards the V2X user via the V2X UE. The V2X user ID also
indicates the V2X service provider with whom the V2X user has a V2X service
agreement. The V2X user may have V2X service agreement with several V2X
service providers and thus will have obtained unique V2X user ID per V2X
service provider.
Based on the service agreement, each V2X user ID is mapped to a V2X UE ID.
## 8.2 V2X UE identity (V2X UE ID)
The V2X UE ID can be an instance of the VAL UE ID as specified in 3GPP TS
23.434 [6]. The V2X UE ID is a unique identifier within the V2X service that
represents the V2X UE. The V2X UE ID is mapped to an application specific UE
identity (e.g. StationID as specified in ETSI TS 102 894-2 [16] or GPSI as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [23]). Due to privacy considerations, the V2X UE
ID may be changed. The V2X UE ID is used to address the V2X UE in order to
send V2X messages.
## 8.3 V2X service identity (V2X service ID)
The V2X service ID can be an instance of the VAL service ID as specified in
3GPP TS 23.434 [6]. The V2X service ID is a globally unique identifier that
represents the V2X service. A V2X application server provides a list of V2X
services towards the V2X UE. Each V2X service is uniquely identified by a V2X
service ID, which is an identifier of the V2X application. The V2X service ID
can be used for policy mapping, QoS handling for V2X communication and V2X
message distribution, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.285 [5]. An identifier of a
V2X service, e.g. ITS-AID or PSID specified in ETSI TS 102 965 [17] and ISO TS
17419 [18], can be used as a V2X service ID.
## 8.4 V2X group identity (V2X group ID)
The V2X group ID is a globally unique identifier within the V2X service that
represents a set of V2X users and the corresponding V2X UE. The set of V2X
users may belong to the same or different V2X service provider. It indicates
the V2X application server where the group is defined.
## 8.5 Geographical area identity (GEO ID)
The V2X service provider defined identity of a geographical area. The GEO ID
supports different representations of geographical area (e.g. geo-fence, tile
identifiers). The VAE server maintains the mapping of the GEO ID with the
location corresponding to one or more V2X UE IDs.
The GEO ID may support the format of a URI.

### 9.5.1 General
The VAE capabilities provide support for file distribution to the V2X
application specific layer. The VAE capabilities abstract the aspects like
file chunking, QoE management, file delivery from the V2X application specific
layer.
### 9.5.2 Use of MBMS \"files\" session type
The VAE server acts as a content provider and the VAE client acts as an MBMS
client in the xMB reference model (subclause 4.1 in 3GPP TS 26.348 [11]).
The VAE server makes use of the xMB procedures from 3GPP TS 26.348 [11] to
create MBMS sessions whose type is set to \"files\" and to request the
delivery of files over these sessions. Before provisioning files to the BM‑SC,
the VAE server prepares the file for distribution, which may include partition
of large files into smaller files or encryption.
The VAE server is responsible for translating the parameters related to the
V2X application triggering the file delivery into corresponding xMB
parameters. Table 9.5.2-1 describes the mapping between the V2X parameters and
the xMB API properties specified in 3GPP TS 26.348 [11].

Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAE server acting as a SCS/AS is configured with the SCEF information
and is authorized to exchange information with the SCEF as specified in
subclause 4.9 in 3GPP TS 23.682 [8]. The VAE server has subscribed to QoS
notification service from 5GS (e.g. PCF/NWDAF). The notification may either
include the request for QoS sustainability events as specified in 3GPP TS
23.288 [24] or can include a QoS change notification requests as provided by
SMF and specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [8];
2\. The V2X UE1 and V2X UE2 have subscribed for the network monitoring
information at the VAE server.
3\. The VAE server may be aware of the RAT type the V2X UE supports from the
registration of VAE client.
Figure 9.7.4.2-1: Notifications for network monitoring information

information as per the procedure in subclause 4.9 of 3GPP TS 23.682 [8],
and/or communicates with NEF or NWDAF to receive QoS monitoring information
and/or data analytics information of 5GS as defined in 3GPP TS 23.288 [24] for
the requesting area and/or the V2X UE(s). The VAE server may determine to
receive network monitoring information from EPC or 5GC or both considerting
the RAT type provided by the UE. The VAE server subscription to QoS monitoring
service from 5GS (e.g. PCF/NWDAF) may be active for a certain period of time
or a given geographical area and/or the V2X UE(s). The monitoring may either
include the request for QoS sustainability events as specified in 3GPP TS
23.288 [24], or can include a QoS change notification requests as provided by
SMF and specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [8]. The reporting may be configured by
the application enabler layer for a given area, V2X UE(s), time, periodicity
etc taking into account the service requirement and other parameters (e.g.
expected congestion in certain area, time of the day, road conditions). Based
on the subscription, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [8], 5GS provides the
extended QoS monitoring report, over N33 interface. This report may come
either from NWDAF or SMF via PCF/NEF.
2\. The network monitoring information (e.g. uplink or downlink link
degradations, congestions, etc.) available at the VAE server about the on-
going V2V session(s) and the network status is based on the original network
monitoring information provided by the SCEF in step 1, and/or based on QoS
monitoring report or data analytics from 5GS as specified in step 1. The VAE
server determines the network monitoring information to send to the UE.
3\. The monitoring information is sent to the subscribed V2X UEs via network
monitoring information notification.
## 9.8 Switching modes of operations for V2V communications
### 9.8.1 General
The V2X services need to support different modes of operation for V2V (PC5 and
Uu) communications. The V2X UE makes the decision to switch between different
modes of operation for V2V communications considering the V2V service KPIs as
specified in 3GPP TS 22.186 [3]. The V2X application layer may provide the
network monitoring information or recommendation for the communication mode to
assist the V2X UE in making the switching decision for the operation modes
selection.
The V2X UE determines switching of the mode of operation for V2V sessions
based on several factors including the received network monitoring information
as specified in subclause 9.7 and the PC5 communication quality information
and assistance information received from the VAE server. The V2X UE switches
the mode of operation and engages in either direct (PC5) or indirect (Uu)
session as specified in subclause 23.14 of 3GPP TS 36.300 [14].

#### 9.10.4.1 General
For the V2X scenarios like extended sensors, platooning, the V2X UEs may be
connected to the serving PLMN, but the V2X application server information may
change as per the geographical location. Also it is not practically feasible
to provide all the V2X server USDs to the V2X UE via the initial V2X UE
configuration by the PLMN. It is hence required that the V2X server USDs may
be provided considering the mobility of the V2X UE. This subclause describes
the procedure for obtaining the local service information by the V2X UE via
V1-AE.
#### 9.10.4.2 Procedure
Figure 9.10.4.2-1 illustrates the procedure for obtaining the dynamic local
service information by the V2X UE via V1-AE.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The V2X UE is connected to the VAE server in geographical area A.
2\. The V2X UE has no local service information for geographical area B.
3\. If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is
activated by the VAE server.
Figure 9.10.4.2-1: Obtaining dynamic local service information by V2X UE via
V1-AE
1\. The VAE client sends a local service information request to the VAE server
(responsible for geographic location A) which may include mobility information
like the geographic locations (geographic location B).
2\. The VAE server determines the local service information (e.g. V2X server
USD(s), V2X USD) corresponding to the geographic locations information
received in step 1.
3\. The VAE server provides the local service information (e.g. V2X server
USD(s), V2X USD) with the corresponding geographic locations information to
the VAE client via a local service information response. The V2X USD
information consists of TMGI, list of SAIs, frequency and SDP information with
the local service information for local V2X application server discovery. The
details of V2X server USD are specified in subclause 4.4.7.3 in 3GPP TS 23.285
[5]. This message can be sent via unicast or multicast.
4\. Upon receiving the local service information in step 3, the VAE client
stores the received information.

service provider B.
3\. The service area and VAE server 2 information of V2X service provider B
mapping is available at VAE server 1 of V2X service provider A.
Figure 9.10.5-1: Dynamic local service information in multiple V2X service
provider scenario
1\. The VAE client sends a local service information request to the VAE server
1 (responsible for geographic location A) with V2X UE ID and current V2X UE
location.
2\. The VAE server 1 determines the V2X UE is in the service area of VAE
server 2 of V2X service provider B, and the local service information
corresponding to the service area of VAE server 2 is not available at VAE
server 1. If the local service information corresponding to the service area
of VAE server 2 is available, then go to step 5.
3\. The VAE server 1 sends the local service information request to the VAE
server 2 to get the local service information information for the V2X UE. The
V2X UE location is included in the request.
4\. The VAE server 2 determines the local service information (e.g. V2X server
USD(s), V2X USD) with the corresponding geographic locations information based
on UE location, and sends local service information response to the VAE server
1. This message carries the local service information. Upon receiving the
local service information corresponding to the service area of VAE server 2,
the VAE server 1 stores the received information.
5\. The VAE server 1 provides the local service information to the VAE client.
Upon receiving the local service information, the VAE client stores the

application resource adaptation.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAE server has the KPI information for the V2X services.
2\. The VAE server is provided with the network monitoring information as per
the subclause A.3.
3\. The VAE server is configured with the NRM server information.

request to the VAE server for an adaptation of the V2X service operation per
V2X UE or per group of UEs.
2\. The VAE server translates the V2X application requirement to different
network resource requirement for group of users, which may be a subset of V2X
UEs within the V2X group that will be affected by application adaptation.
3\. If the V2X application requirement is successfully translated to the
network resource requirement, the VAE server sends a V2X application
requirement response to the V2X application specific server.
4\. The VAE server performs network resource adaptation by interacting with
the NRM server as specified in the 3GPP TS 23.434 [6] for the V2X application
requirement received in step 1.
5\. Based on the result of the network resource adaptation in step 4
corresponding to step 1, the VAE server sends a V2X application requirement
notification to the V2X application specific server.
## 9.12 Dynamic group management
### 9.12.1 General
Some of the V2X scenarios require group-based communication (e.g. platooning).
Unlike V2X communication for safety scenarios where all V2X UEs in the
communication range receive broadcasted communication, the group-based
communication is expected to be received only by the V2X UEs of the members of
that group. However in some scenarios the V2X UEs are required to be
determined dynamically (with the assistance of the V2X application server or
independently by the V2X UEs when they are not connected to the network)
during the operation. Also each V2X application group has to be mapped to a
ProSe Layer-2 group ID in order to avoid any interference during PC5
communications for the V2X application groups. The ProSe Layer-2 Group ID is
only used in PC5 V2X group communication (without the involvement of the V2X
application server).

The V2X application specific server is responsible for V2X dynamic group
formation (including information like group ID assignment, group definition),
membership management (e.g. user authorization). VAE layer supports V2X UEs in
the Uu communication range assigning a ProSe Layer-2 Group ID for application
layer V2X dynamic group formation.
#### 9.12.3.2 Procedure
The procedure for on-network dynamic group creation is illustrated in figure
9.12.3.2-1.
Pre-condition:
1\. V2X application dynamic group is defined at the V2X application specific
server with V2X UE assigned as dynamic group leader.
2\. VAE server has a pool of the ProSe Layer-2 Group IDs that can be assigned
to dynamic groups
Figure 9.12.3.2-1: On-network dynamic group creation
1\. The V2X application specific server requests the VAE server to configure
dynamic group corresponding to the dynamic group information (e.g. dynamic
group ID, group definition, group leader).
2\. To enable PC5 communication, the VAE server assigns ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
to the received dynamic group information from the available ProSe Layer-2
Group ID pool.
3\. The VAE server responds to the V2X application specific server for the
request to configure dynamic group.
4\. The VAE server triggers a push request including ProSe Layer-2 Group ID
corresponding to the dynamic group information to the VAE client.
5\. The VAE client stores the received PC5 communication parameters
corresponding to the dynamic group information received from the VAE server.
NOTE 1: The VAE client may further announce the dynamic group information
including the corresponding ProSe Layer-2 Group ID to the other VAE clients
within the PC5 communication proximity on a PC5 channel dedicated for V5-AE
communications, enabling more V2X UEs to join the dynamic group.
NOTE 2: When there is loss of connectivity with the network by the V2X UEs,
service continuity is ensured by the V2X UEs switching to PC5 communication
using the VAE server assigned ProSe Layer-2 Group ID corresponding to the
dynamic group formation.
### 9.12.4 Off-network dynamic group creation
#### 9.12.4.1 General
The V2X application specific client is responsible for V2X dynamic group
information (including information like group ID assignment, group
definition). VAE layer on the client supports assigning a ProSe Layer-2 Group
ID for application layer V2X dynamic group formation.
#### 9.12.4.2 Procedure
The procedure for off-network dynamic group creation is illustrated in figure
9.12.4.2-1.
Pre-condition:
1\. VAE clients are provisioned ProSe Layer-2 Group ID(s) generation rules
corresponding to the group information or
2\. VAE client(s) are configured with the unique pool of ProSe Layer-2 Group
IDs, when they are in coverage area of the VAE server.
Figure 9.12.4.2-1: Off-network dynamic group creation
1\. The V2X application specific client 2 requests the VAE client 2 to
configure dynamic group corresponding to the dynamic group information (e.g.
dynamic group ID, group definition, group leader).
2\. Each VAE client generates ProSe Layer-2 Group ID independently based on
the provisioned ProSe Layer-2 Group ID(s) generation rules for its group
information or the VAE client 2 assigns ProSe Layer-2 Group ID from the pool
of configured ProSe Layer-2 Group IDs.
3\. VAE client may further announce the dynamic group information including
the corresponding ProSe Layer-2 Group ID to the other VAE clients within the
PC5 communication proximity on a PC5 channel dedicated for V5-AE
communications, enabling more V2X UEs to join the dynamic group.
4\. The VAE client stores the PC5 communication parameters corresponding to
the dynamic group information received from another VAE client.
### 9.12.5 On-network dynamic group notification
#### 9.12.5.1 General
Once the on-network dynamic group is created as defined in subclause 9.12.3,
the VAE client notifies the VAE server about changes in the group (i.e. UE
joins or leaves the group) and finally the V2X application specific server is
notified with such information.
#### 9.12.5.2 Procedure
The procedure for on-network dynamic group notification is illustrated in
figure 9.12.5.2-1.
Pre-condition:
1\. V2X application dynamic group is created as defined in subclause 9.12.3.
Figure 9.12.5.2-1: On-network dynamic group notification
1\. The VAE client sends identity list notification to the VAE server about
group member changes.
2\. Upon receipt of the identity list notification from the VAE client, the
VAE server further notifies the V2X application specific server about the
newly joined or left group member(s).
### 9.12.6 On network dynamic group information update procedure
#### 9.12.6.1 General
This subclause provides procedures to update dynamic group information of an
on-network V2X dynamic group.
#### 9.12.6.2 VAE client initiated on network dynamic group information update
procedure
The procedure for on-network dynamic group information (e.g. group leader)
update is illustrated in figure 9.12.6.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The on network dynamic group has already been defined and V2X UE A and V2X
UE B are members of the group;
2\. V2X UE A is the current group leader; and
3\. The V2X application specific client in V2X UE A has determined to update
the group information (e.g., update group leader ID from identity of V2X UE A
to identity of V2X UE B) and informed the updates and other relevant
information about the update (e.g. if the update is temporary, like time
bound, or permanent) to VAE client A to update the group information.
Figure 9.12.6.2-1: VAE client initiated on network dynamic group information
update procedure
1\. The VAE client A sends a Dynamic group information update request to the
VAE server. The request includes the group-ID of the group for which group
information update request is sent. The request also includes the updated
group information (e.g. identity of V2X UE B as group leader ID) and other
relevant information about the update (e.g. if the update to the group
information are temporary and time bound or permanent).
2\. Upon receiving the Dynamic group information update request from VAE
client A, the VAE server checks for the V2X user authorization to update the
group information. If required, the VAE server also checks validity of the
updated group information (e.g. if the request is to update the group leader
ID to V2X UE B, the VAE server checks with V2X application specific server
about the capabilities of the proposed group leader V2X UE B to ensure it is
capable of sufficient fuel, sensors and applications to communicate and
coordinate with other group members to act as group leader). If required, then
the VAE server consults with V2X application specific server to ratify the
updated group information or seek changes to the requested update (e.g. a
different V2X UE as group leader). If the authorization fails or if the
updated group information is not valid, then steps 3 to 6 are skipped.
3\. If the request from the VAE client is authorized and the updated group
information is valid, the VAE server acknowledges the VAE client A.
4\. If the update in group information requires consent from other group
member(s) (e.g. consent from the proposed new group leader, V2X UE B, to
accept the role of group leader), then the VAE server obtains the consent from
the user as specified in clause 9.12.6.4. This step is skipped if user consent
is not required.
5\. The VAE server sends the Dynamic group information update change response
to VAE client A indicating success or failure. If:
\- the request was authorized but the updated group information was not valid,
as determined in step 2; or
\- a reject response to the Dynamic group information update consent request
was received from VAE client B;
> then, the VAE server may include suggestions for the updated group
> information (e.g. identity of the V2X UE C as potential group leader). These
> suggestions are based on consultation with the V2X application specific
> server.
6\. If the group information update request was successful, the VAE server
updates the group document.
7\. Upon successful update of the group document, the VAE server triggers a
group information update notification to other group members and to the V2X
application specific server.
#### 9.12.6.3 VAE server initiated on network dynamic group information update
procedure
The procedure for on-network dynamic group information (e.g. group leader)
update is illustrated in figure 9.12.6.3-1.

information (e.g., update group leader ID from identity of V2X UE A to
identity of V2X UE B) and informed the updates and other relevant information
about the update (e.g. if the update is temporary, like time bound, or
permanent) to the VAE server to update the group information.
Figure 9.12.6.3-1: VAE server initiated on network dynamic group information
update procedure
1\. If the update in group information requires consent from the group
member(s) (e.g. consent from the proposed new group leader, V2X UE B, to
accept the role of group leader), then the VAE server obtains the consent from
the user as specified in clause 9.12.6.4. This step is skipped if user consent
is not required.
2\. If required (e.g. when group leader ID is being changed from V2X UE A to
V2X UE B), the VAE server sends Dynamic group information update indication to
the VAE client A about the possible update to group information.
NOTE: Step 1 and step 2 can happen in parallel.
3\. Upon receiving the indication from the VAE server, the VAE client A
notifies the V2X application specific client A about the possible update to
group information.
4\. If group leader information update request is successful, the VAE server
updates the group document.
5\. Upon successful update of the group document, the VAE server triggers a
Dynamic group information update notification to other group members and to
the V2X application specific server.
#### 9.12.6.4 VAE Server taking consent from user
The procedure for the VAE server to take consent form the user is illustrated
in figure 9.12.6.4-1.

1\. If the update in group information requires consent from other group
member(s) (e.g. consent from the proposed new group leader, V2X UE B, to
accept the role of group leader), then the VAE server sends a dynamic group
information update consent request to VAE client B. The request includes the
group-ID of the group for which the request is sent. The request also includes
other relevant information about the update (e.g. if the update to the group
information are temporary and time bound or permanent).
2\. The VAE client B notifies the V2X application specific client B about the
Dynamic group information update consent request. The V2X application specific
client or the V2X user decides to accept or reject the request.
3\. The VAE client B sends a Dynamic group information update consent response
to the VAE server. The response includes the decision whether the request is
accepted or rejected.

1\. Dynamic UE location based group creation or update is triggered (e.g.
notified of the UE location of host vehicle) via the step 4 in clause 9.16.3
for the V2X UE ID of the host vehicle.
2\. VAE server 1 uses its associated LMS 1 to obtain the dynamic UE list and
the corresponding location information in the proximity area of the host
vehicle by providing the application defined proximity range and the UE
location of the host vehicle as specified in clause 9.3.10 of 3GPP TS 23.434
[6].
3\. VAE server 1 determines the list of other VAE servers 2..N operating in
the same location as per clause 9.10.2.1.
4\. For each VAE server determined in step 4, VAE server 1 requests the
dynamic UE list and its corresponding location information for the application
defined proximity range by providing the UE location of the host vehicle.
5\. The VAE server(s) 2..N obtain UE information corresponding to the UE
location and application defined proximity range from its corresponding LMS
2..N as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [6].
6\. As per the agreement between the V2X SPs, if the V2X UE IDs are not
shareable, then VAE server(s) 2..N may replace the V2X UE IDs with temporary
V2X UE IDs.
7\. The VAE server(s) 2..N sends get response with UE list in the UE location
and application defined proximity range to VAE server 1.
8\. If VAE server 1 has no dynamic UE location group for the V2X UE ID, the
VAE server 1 creates a dynamic UE location based group with the UE list
received from its LMS and other VAE server(s) 2..N. Further VAE server 1
stores the dynamic UE location based group. Otherwise, the VAE server 1
updates the dynamic UE location group with the latest UE information. The V2X
UEs whose locations are no more within the application defined proximity range
are removed from the dynamic UE location group.

\- The VAE clients of the V2X-UEs have received and stored the UE-to-UE
broadcast/groupcast configuration policies per V2X application.
Figure 9.17.4.2-1: V2X groupcast/broadcast delivery by VAE layer
1\. The V2X application specific client of the V2X UE 1 sends to the VAE
client 1, the V2X message to be broadcasted/groupcasted. This message may be
for example a PCM, CPM, MCM, DENM.
2\. The VAE client 1 retrieves the mapping for the V2X service and
configuration policy related to the V2X message. The VAE client 1 forms a VAE
message, based on the V2X message(s) and the applied configuration policy.
3\. The VAE message is sent from the transmitting V2X-UE 1 to the receiving
V2X-UE N (which may be application relay or destination V2X-UEs). For the case
when a V2X-UE acts as application relay, the message is relayed towards the
destination VAE client.
4\. The V2X message is provided from the destination VAE client to the
corresponding V2X application specific client. In case of message bundling,
the receiving VAE client first un-bundles the V2X message and then sends to
the V2X application specific client.

### 9.20.3 Subscription Procedure
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAE server includes an Application Function (AF) functionality, as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.287 [8].
2\. The VAE server has subscriptions with SEAL servers to receive V2X service-
related information (e.g. UE IDs, location, group, configuration info, etc.).
Figure 9.20.3-1: Subscription for monitoring and control of QoS for eV2X
communications
1\. The V2X application specific server sends a service adaptation and QoS
control subscription request to the VAE server.
2\. The VAE server, who acts as an AF, subscribes to QoS monitoring service
from 5GS (e.g. PCF/NWDAF). This subscription may be active for a certain
period of time or a given geographical area. The monitoring may either include
the request for QoS sustainability events as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [24],
or can include a QoS change notification requests as provided by SMF and
specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [8]. The reporting may be configured by the
application enabler layer for a given area, time, periodicity etc taking into
account the service requirement and other parameters (e.g. expected congestion
in certain area, time of the day, road conditions).
3\. The VAE server sends a service adaptation and QoS control subscription
response indicating success or failure of subscription.
### 9.20.4 Notification Procedure
Pre-condition:
1\. The subscription procedure specified in clause 9.20.3 is performed.
Figure 9.20.3-1: Notification for monitoring and control of QoS for eV2X
communications
1\. Based on the subscription, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [8], 5GS
provides the extended QoS monitoring report, over N33 interface. This report
may come either from NWDAF or SMF via PCF/NEF.
2 The VAE server, based on the monitoring events (step 1) for one or multiple
V2X-UEs within one service or across multiple services, may trigger a service
requirement adaptation (step 3) based on the actual or expected QoS change for
one or more V2X services.
3\. The VAE server sends a service requirement adaptation notification request
to V2X application specific server to identify the action which is needed,
based on the actual or expected QoS change. This could be the adaptation of
the Level of Automation (LoA) for one or more V2X-UEs or V2X services.
4\. The V2X application specific server decides whether to adapt the service
requirement based on step 3.
5\. The V2X application specific server sends a response to VAE server with a
positive or negative acknowledgment. Optionally, this may include the list of
a sub-set of V2X-UEs within a service for which the requirement change should
be applied
6\. If no QoS adaptation is required, V2X application layer may adapt based on
the adapted service requirements; and steps 7-10 are optional.
7\. If a QoS adaptation is required, the VAE server, triggers the adaptation
of QoS for the affected V2X-UE(s) within the service or across multiple
services in close vicinity.
8\. The VAE server performs network resource adaptation by interacting with
the NRM server as specified in the 3GPP TS 23.434 [10].
9\. The VAE server also notifies about the QoS adaptation to the V2X
application specific server.
10\. The V2X application layer adapts based on the adapted service and QoS
requirements.

### 9.21.3 Procedure on VAL server - triggered VRU zone configuration
Figure 9.21.3-1 illustrates the procedure where the VAE server configures the
VRU zone based on application requirement; and supports the run-time operation
based on an expected UE entrance to the zone.
Pre-conditions:
1\. V2X application specific server or client has subscribed to VAE layer to
provide support for V2P communication.
Figure 9.21.3-1: VAL server - triggered VRU zone configuration
1\. The V2X application specific server sends a subscription request to manage
the configuration of a new high-risk area zone and requires the VAE server
support to translate it to a network-related zone configuration and
provisioning to the UEs within the requested area.
2\. The VAE server processes the request and stores the subscription. The
processing includes the translation of the zone requirement of step 1 and
determines a set of network-related zone parameters which indicates the
configuration parameters.
3\. The VAE sever sends a VRU zone management subscription response to VASS.
4\. The VAE server initiates the SEAL LMS service for location tracking both
for static location and dynamically changing location for all UEs within the
VRU zone area. VAE server obtains and initiates tracking the V2X UEs location
from the location management server 1 as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 (clause
9.3.12) or, for static area, it obtains location area monitoring information
based on clause 9.3.10 of 3GPP TS 23.434.
5\. The VAE server sends a notification message including the VRU zone
configuration parameters. Parameters can be based on the parameters provided
in step 2. This configuration will be provided to the V2X-UEs (and
pedestrians) within the area that will be covered by the VRU zone.
6\. The VAE server keeps monitoring the VRU zone area based on monitoring SEAL
LMS events. This includes events on whether a UE (e.g. UE1) is moving in or
out a target area of interest.
The VAE server translates the UE1 mobility event to an expected entrance to a
VRU high risk zone, and based on the configuration of the zone, it identifies
whether to generate and send a notification to the VASS on the expected
entrance / leave of UE1.
7\. The VAE server alerts the VASS that the UE1 is expected to move to the VRU
zone area in a given time horizon and provides also information on its
mobility as well as the UE1 capabilities (e.g. VRU capable).
8\. The VAE server may also alert the VAE client (if deployed at the UE1) that
it is expected to enter the VRU zone and requests the confirmation for
allowing the push of VRU messages within the zone.
## 9.22 VAE support for Energy Efficient V2P communications
### 9.22.1 General
Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P) is one of the V2X scenarios, which enables
communication between vehicles and pedestrians for both safety and traffic
efficiency related applications. One of the key V2P applications is the
Vulnerable Road User Protection (VRUP) as specified in ETSI TS 103 300-2 [13].
VRUP provides warning to vehicles of the presence of vulnerable road users,
e.g. pedestrian or cyclist, in case of dangerous situation. In VRUP, multiple
V2X messages need to be exchanged between the pedestrian and the vehicular
UEs, originating by one or more applications. Such messages can be standard
VRU messages (e.g. VAM) and other V2X messages (CAM, DENM, BSM, CPM) and can
be exchanged via different transmission modes (unicast, groupcast, broadcast).
In such scenario, one challenge is that a pedestrian UE might have a lower
battery capacity and limited radio capability, and therefore may have to work
in a low power consumption mode, e.g. not being able to send/receive V2X
messages with the same periodicity as a Vehicular UE. Continuous
sending/receiving V2X messages by the pedestrian UE would affect UE power
efficiency. A further challenge is that multiple applications related to VRU
may be deployed, which may have differentiated traffic/QoS requirements as
well as transmission/reception schedules.
The VAE layer may provide support functionality for enabling V2P applications,
by consolidating the V2P application requirements and aligning the
communication traffic pattern with the PC5 QoS setting and the AS layer
configurations (e.g. DRX cycles).

#### 9.22.3.1 Procedure on VAE server enabled V2P communication schedule
configuration
This subclause describes the procedure for V2P communication schedule
configuration and update support by the VAE server.
Figure 9.22.3.1-1 illustrates the procedure where the VAE server configures
the traffic schedule for V2P communications based on application requirement;
and communicates with the VAE clients to trigger the translation to an AS
layer/ QoS configurations update.
Pre-conditions:
1\. V2X Application Specific Server has subscribed to VAE server to provide
support for V2P communication.
2\. VAE client of V2X UE #1 and V2X UE #2 are registered with VAE server.
Figure 9.22.3.1-1: VAE server - enabled V2P communication schedule
configuration
1\. A V2P application specific server provides the V2P application
requirements in form of a request to the VAE server, including application QoS
requirements for the V2P applications and provisioning policies and parameters
for the PC5 communication.
2\. The VAE server authorizes the request and sends a V2P application
requirement response.
3\. The VAE server generates a communication schedule for one or more involved
V2X UEs, so that the off duration is maximized. The determination of the
transmission schedule can be determined based on the V2P service KPIs. Such
communication schedule may include the transmission/reception schedule for the
application messages and may also include the DRX cycle configuration for out
of coverage and groupcast/broadcast communications.
4\. The VAE server sends a V2P communication schedule configuration request
message to the involved VAE clients. This includes the generated UE level
transmission schedules and may also include the DRX cycle configuration for
PC5 communication in out of coverage and groupcast/broadcast modes.
5\. V2X UE #1\'s and V2X UE #2\'s VAE clients provide the updated traffic
pattern as V2X Application Requirements to V2X layer, also including QoS
requirements such as delay requirements, priority, etc., for the PC5
communication for both applications, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [19]
clause 5.4.1.1. VAE client may also indicate the transmission mode (unicast,
groupcast) per application. The V2X layer of UEs #1 and #2 process the
requirements from VAE client and generates a UE level DRX schedule. The AS
layer of UE #1 and #2 applies/configures the DRX schedule for the
corresponding V2X communication.
6\. VAE clients of V2X UEs #1 and #2 send a response to the configuration
request as positive or negative acknowledgement to the VAE server.
7\. VAE clients of V2X UEs #1 and #2 may send a notification to the V2X
application specific client(s) to inform on the communication traffic pattern.
#### 9.22.3.2 Procedure on VAE client enabled V2P communication schedule
configuration
This subclause describes the procedure for V2P communication schedule
configuration and update support by the VAE client.
Figure 9.22.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure where the VAE client configures
the traffic schedule for V2P communications based on application requirement;
and triggers the translation to an AS layer/ QoS configurations update.
Pre-conditions:
1\. VAE client 1 has been configured by the VAE server to configure the
communication schedule for V2P communications.
2\. V2X UE #1 and V2X UE#2 have discovered each other based upon V2P service
and established a unicast connection using the V2X Service oriented Layer-2
link establishment procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [19] clause
6.3.3.1.
Figure 9.22.3.2-1: VAE client - enabled V2P communication schedule
configuration
1\. On V2X UE #1, one or more V2X application specific clients send V2P
application requirement request to the VAE client, including application QoS
requirements for the V2P applications and provisioning policies and parameters
for the PC5 communication.
2\. The VAE client sends a V2P application requirement response to the
requestor V2X application specific client (s).
3\. V2X UE #1\'s VAE client consolidates requirements (from one or more
application specific clients) and generates a UE level transmission schedule,
so that the off-duration is maximized. The determination of the transmission
schedule can be determined based on the configuration on the UE (energy
efficiency target) and the service KPIs.
4\. V2X UE #1\'s VAE client sends a V2P communication schedule update request
which includes the generated UE level transmission schedule to other VAE
client 2 (in vicinity, or in service-based group), in order to negotiate the
optimal transmission pattern or inform on the expected reception pattern.
5\. V2X UE #2\'s VAE client optionally generates or updates the communication
schedule for V2X UE #2, based on step 4, or negotiates the traffic pattern.
6\. VAE client of V2X UE #2 may send a V2P communication schedule update
response indicating the result or an expected/generated UE #2 transmission
pattern (in case of negotiation).
7\. V2X UE #1\'s and V2X UE #2\'s VAE clients provide the updated traffic
pattern as V2X Application Requirements to V2X layer, also including QoS
requirements such as delay requirements, priority, etc., for the PC5
communication for both applications, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.287 [x] clause
5.4.1.1. VAE client may also indicate the transmission mode (unicast,
groupcast) per application. The V2X layer of UEs #1 and #2 process the
requirements from VAE client and generates a UE level DRX schedule. The AS
layer of UE #1 and #2 applies/configures the DRX schedule for the
corresponding V2X communication.
8\. VAE clients of V2X UEs #1 and #2 may send a V2P schedule notification to
the V2X application specific client(s) to inform on the communication traffic
pattern.

###### ## Annex D (normative): Utilization of edge computing
The application architecture for supporting edge applications are specified in
3GPP TS 23.558 [25]. The V2X application layer functional model as specified
in clause 6 may be deployed in edge computing environment.
Figure D-1 illustrates a V2X application layer deployment in edge computing
environments.
Figure D-1: Utilization of edge computing
Figure D-1 illustrates the utilization of edge computing for V2X application
layer based on edge enabler layer specified in 3GPP TS 23.558 [25].
At UE side, V2X Application Specific client(s) and VAE client interact with
the Edge Enabler Client (EEC) via EDGE‑5 reference point. In an Edge Data
Network (EDN), V2X Application Specific Server and VAE server assume the role
of EAS (Edge Application Server) and interacts with the Edge Enabler Server
(EES) via EDGE-3 reference point, for instance, to register its profile into
the EES. Upon service provisioning, the EEC interacts with the EES via EDGE-1
reference point, for instance, to discover V2X Application Specific Server(s)
and VAE Server and further the EEC provides the discovered V2X Application
Specific Server(s) and VAE server to the V2X Application Specific client and
VAE client respectively. The interactions between the entities and 5GS are not
shown for the sake of simplicity.
In an EDN, there could be several EES(s) provided by the same or different
ECSP. The V2X application specific server(s), VAE server(s) and SEAL servers
(e.g. GMS, NRMS, ADAES) shall be able to discover and register into an
appropriate EES. If CAPIF is used, this can be done by utilizing the AEF
serving area and/or the AEF location as described in 3GPP TS 23.222 [x];
otherwise, local configuration of the EES endpoint may be used.
The services provided by EES over EDGE-3 are not re-exposed by the VAE server
or SEAL servers to the V2X application specific server but are directly
consumed by the SEAL servers, VAE server and V2X application specific
server(s).
NOTE: This clause illustrates an example edge deployment using edge enabler
layer and there can be other valid edge deployments enabled for V2X
application layer.
