### 4.2.1 General
This clause provides the overall architecture description:
\- Clause 4.2.2 describes the application architecture in the service based
representation and reference point representation;
\- Clause 4.2.3 describes the functional entities;
### 4.2.2 Architecture
Figure 4.2.2-1 Architecture for network slice capability enablement -- Service
based representation
Figure 4.2.2-1 exhibits the service-based interfaces for providing and
consuming network slice capability enablement services.
The mechanisms for service discovery in the service-based representation
depicted in figure 4.2.2-1 are as follows:
\- The network slice capability enablement server could provide service to VAL
server and NSCE client through interface Snsce.
Figure 4.2.2-2 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization of
the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA specified in 3GPP TS 23.501[3]
and TS 28.533[6].
Figure 4.2.2-2: Architecture for network slice capability enablement utilizing
the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA -- Service based representation
Figure 4.2.2-3 depicts the network slice capability enablement architecture in
the non-roaming case, using the reference point representation showing how
various entities interact with each other.
Figure 4.2.2-3: Architecture for network slice capability enablement --
reference points representation
The network slice capability enablement client communicates with the network
slice capability enablement server over the NSCE-UU reference point. The
network slice capability enablement client provides the support for network
slice capability enablement functions to the VAL client(s) over NSCEâ€‘C
reference point. The VAL server(s) communicates with the network slice
capability enablement server over the NSCE-S reference point. The network
slice capability enablement server, acting as AF, may communicate with the 5G
Core Network functions via NEF (N33) reference point (for interactions with
PCF, NSACF, etc.), or interacting with PCF directly via N5, if permitted. The
network slice capability enablement server may interact with OAM system over
NSCE-OAM reference point, as consumer in both NSaaS and NoP model (for Network
Slice Provisioning capabilities, Performance Assurance, Fault Supervision
etc.).
NOTE: The NSCE-OAM reference point can be realized by the services exposed by
EGMF as defined in TS 28.533[6].
Figure 4.2.2-4 illustrates the architecture for interconnection between NSCE
servers.
Figure 4.2.2-4: Interconnection between NSCE servers
The NSCE server could interact with another NSCE server over NSCE-E reference
point.
### 4.2.3 Functional elements
#### 4.2.3.1 Network slice Capability Enablement client
The network slice capability enablement client functional entity acts as the
application client for the slice enablement. The network slice capability
enablement client interacts with the network slice capability enablement
server to trigger a network slice related operations. This trigger may be due
to an application QoS requirement change, a service operation change, a
network slice status change, etc. The NSCE client may receive a network slice
related notification from the NSCE server. The NSCE client may optionally
notify the VAL client on the network slice / DNN change.
#### 4.2.3.2 Network slice Capability Enablement server
The network slice capability enablement server functional entity provides
application layer enablement to support the network slice management and
control with/without invoking control and management plane capabilities from
SA2 and SA5 pertaining to network slicing. Such enablement supports the
network slice related operations such as the mapping or migration of one or
more vertical applications to one or more network slices, triggering the
dynamic network slice lifecycle management, NSI/NSSI monitoring, etc.
### 4.2.4 Service-based interfaces
The architecture for enabling network slice capability enablement service
contains the following service-based interfaces:
> Sval: Service-based interface exhibited by VAL server.
>
> Snsce: Service-based interface exhibited by NSCE server.
>
> Unsce-c: Service-based interface exhibited by NSCE client.
NOTE: Detailed specification of Unsce-c is based on implementation.
### 4.2.5 Reference points description
#### 4.2.5.1 VAL-UU
The interactions related to vertical application layer support functions
between VAL client and VAL server are supported by VAL-UU reference point.
This reference point is an instance of Uu reference point as described in 3GPP
TS 23.401 [9] and 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
NOTE: The details of VAL-UU reference point is out of scope of the present
document.
#### 4.2.5.2 NSCE-UU
The interactions between a NSCE client and the corresponding NSCE server are
generically referred to as NSCE-UU reference point. This reference point
supports fault data, QoE data and KQI data provisioning etc.
#### 4.2.5.3 NSCE-C
The interactions between the VAL client(s) and the NSCE client(s) within a VAL
UE are generically referred to as NSCEâ€‘C reference point. This reference point
supports obtaining information about network slice that VAL client(s) require,
application client information (such as its KQI) provisioning etc.
#### 4.2.5.4 NSCE-S
The interactions between the VAL server and the NSCE server are generically
referred to as NSCEâ€‘S reference point. This reference point supports network
slice capability exposure such as: application layer slice lifecycle
management, fault diagnosis, slice API configuration and mapping, QoS
verification, slice performance analytics exposure etc.
#### 4.2.5.5 NSCE-E
The interactions between the NSCE servers are generically referred to as
NSCEâ€‘E reference point. his reference point supports information collection
from other NSCE servers.
Editor\'s Note: The supported capabilities for NSCE-E are FFS.

# 5 Key issues
## 5.1 Key issue 1: Network slice capability management enhancements
SEAL is the service enabler architecture layer common to all vertical
applications over 3GPP systems. It provides the functions like location
management, group management, configuration management, identity management,
key management, network resource management and network slice capability
management as defined in 3GPP TS 23.434 [2].
Network slicing is a general network capability which can be applied for many
vertical industries. The network slice capability management service in 3GPP
TS 23.434 [2] only provides capability of network slice adaptation between
NSCE server and the NSCE client. However, for such capability both control
plane and management plane interactions need to be considered since there is
close coupling between the per UE session and the per slice related actions.
For example, the SEAL/NSCE layer may need to be aware of the slice
provisioning parameters (NSI/NSSI configuration) which can be provided by the
slice management system. Furthermore, NSI/NSSI performance monitoring from
management system (e.g. NSI/ NSSI status) may be useful to be known at the
enabler layer, since this may affect the application to slice re-mapping
triggering (e.g. to re-map to the least congested slice); and may also impact
other SEAL provided functionalities (e.g. QoS/resource control, group
management etc).
Open issues:
\- Whether and which enhancement to SEAL network slice capability management
service is required having in mind SA2 and SA5 slice related exposure?
\- Whether a potential enhancement to SEAL network slice capability management
functional model is required?
\- Whether new or enhanced APIs are needed to support the potential SEAL
enhancements?
\- How the network slice capability (such as management service (MnS))
consumption may trigger and impact the value-add services provided by the SEAL
layer?
## 5.2 Key issue 2: Application layer exposed network slice lifecycle
management
It is specified in clause 6.10 of 3GPP TS 22.261 [7] that 5G network is
required to provide suitable APIs to allow a trusted third-party to create,
modify, scale and delete network slices used for the third-party. As specified
in 28.531 [5], SA5 has defined the network slice lifecycle management service.
SA6 can provide a more concise application layer exposed network slice
lifecycle management with additional functionality for verticals. It can help
vertical do the lifecycle management without knowledge of SA5 O&M defined
interfaces and APIs. In addition, with the network slice related information
(such as network slice status reported from NSACF), the SA6 could trigger some
slice lifecycle management operations automatically to provide a value-added
lifecycle management service. It is not clear how to expose the network slice
lifecycle management service from application perspective with providing
additional value on top of existing SA5 solution.
NOTE: The interface which may be used in this KI is specified in TS 28.532
[8], and the enabler layer could use the interface exposed by EGMF defined in
TS 28.533[6].
Hence, it is required to study the following issues:
\- How to integrate and expose the SA5 and SA2 network slice related
capability to provide some value-added lifecycle management service from
application layer?
\- Whether and how additional service APIs are required to be supported for
application layer enablement of network slice lifecycle management?
\- Whether and how CAPIF can be leveraged for additional service APIs.
## 5.3 Key issue 3: Discovery & registration aspects for management service
exposure
There are use cases (being discussed also in SA1, TR 22.835 [9]), where the
applications (e.g. gaming or online video applications) may access the 5GS
over multiple slices for different services (e.g. based on the user
membership); or have different priorities on different slices based on
Application Service Provider (ASP) request. As an example, a mobile network
operator has provisioned a set of network slices (Slice#1, Slice#2, Slice#3)
which may be used by different ASPs (e.g. Slice#1 for online video services,
Slice#2 for gaming. Slice#3 for eMBB or IOT service). Different ASPs may use
these slices (or a subset of them) for different services that they offer.
Furthermore, when an application changes the network slices to be accessed, it
should be agnostic to the UEs accessing the service and should be performed
automatically.
The vertical enablement layer (SEAL, vertical-specific enablers) supports the
exposure of telco provided services to the vertical / application service
provider (ASP). Such telco-provided services traditionally covered the 3GPP
control plane services (provided by SA2); however, these can be extended to
3GPP management domain services (provided by SA5) which may be useful for
allowing the ASP to monitor and manage the slices used by the UEs. The enabler
layer can be seen as a trusted application entity that interacts with the
management system on behalf of ASP to allow the exposure of management
services related to the offered slices. It can be used to trigger dynamic
slice-related actions and also reduce complexity at the ASP side.
In this extended notion of vertical enablement (to cover the 3GPP management
service exposure), the vertical/ slice customer needs to be able to 1)
discover the relevant Network Slice Instances and the respective capabilities
such as coverage offered, RAT/ frequencies, to 2) discover the management
services (based on TS 28.533 [6]) which can be exposed as part of the offered
slices, and 3) register to the 3GPP management domain via the vertical enabler
layer for consuming the management services.
This study needs to investigate:
\- Whether and how SEAL needs to be enhanced to support the discovery of the
offered slices and the offered management services related to these slices, to
the vertical/ASP;
\- Whether and how SEAL needs to be enhanced to support the registration of
the vertical applications to the 3GPP management domain.
## 5.4 Key issue 4: Network slice fault management capability
As the requirement captured in TS 22.261 [7], _based on operator policy, the
5GS shall provide suitable APIs to allow a trusted third-party to monitor the
network slice used for the third-party according to operator policy._
In addition, the descriptions of network diagnostics are captured in clause
F.2, TS 22.261 [7] as following:
_Network diagnostics helps with scanning, diagnosing and identifying problems
within a network. Diagnostics includes gathering data and continuously
providing sufficient performance parameters that characterize the quality of
the network connection. This includes data of the physical connection as well
as of logical links and sub-networks. Exposure of relevant (and possibly
aggregated) performance parameters ensures a quick reaction in case of failure
as well as identifying network connectivity, performance and other related
problems._
_Network diagnostic information needs to be generated automatically and, in
case of a hosted or virtual network deployment, be made available to the
tenant of the network via a suitable API._
The alarm data can be used to help the third-party to diagnose the fault
problem of the services, locate the fault causes, and to be aware of the
potential fault. In TS 28.545 [10], the fault supervision management services
are standardized by which the alarm of the network slice instance from network
resource aspects can be subscribed and reported. This alarm information
together with the application function\'s fault report and communication
service related knowledge can be utilized by the SEAL/NSCE to diagnose and
locate the cause of the service performance deterioration and the fault of the
communication services, and then exposed the fault report to the third-party.
For example, if the status of the required communication is not correct, the
SEAL/NSCE derives this alarm information from application functions. In this
case, it is the SEAL/NSCE\'s responsibility to detect whether this fault is
caused by the 5GS network or not and exposed the fault report to the third-
party. If it is, then the SEAL/NSCE may inform the management functions the
location of the fault and ask for the maintenance of the managed functions to
clear the fault.
In addition, the two business relationships of network slice as a service and
network slice as NOP internals may considered separately for the capabilities
exposed in each scenarios. The coordination with SA5 is needed to fill the gap
between the communication services (from the verticals\' point of view) and
the 5G network.
Open issues:
\- Whether and how additional APIs dedicated to network slice fault management
capability are required?
\- How to define the APIs to expose the fault report to verticals
client/server
\- How to coordinate with fault supervision management services provided by
O&M systems defined in SA5 to fill the gap in fault management.
## 5.5 Key issue 5: Communication service management exposure
In clause 6.10 of TS 22.261 [7], following requirements are defined:
_Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall expose a suitable API to allow
an authorized third-party to define and reconfigure the properties of the
communication services offered to the third-party._
_The 5G system shall support the means for disengagement (tear down) of
communication services by an authorized third-party_
In addition, in clause 6.23.1 of TS 22.261 [7], it defines that QoS monitoring
can be used for assessing and assuring the dependability of the communication
services.
In SA5 TS 28.535 [11], management services to assure the communication service
as per agreement (for example a SLS) with a communication service (only
network slice as a service scenario) consumer (e.g. enterprise) have been
defined. For other scenarios, the communication services from the verticals
aspects required by SA1 (e.g., vertical automation communication services,
URLLC services) are not discussed in SA5
From the vertical industry perspective, they may be more concerned about how
to operate the communication services provided by 5GS to meet the business
requirements on application level. Take V2X service as an example, there is a
specific service of cooperative driving for vehicle platooning information
exchange, and the vertical has some requirements on this service, including
end-to-end latency between two UEs. Therefore, the service enable layer needs
to provide such capabilities for vertical industries, including lifecycle
management and quality assurance of communication services from the
verticals\' perspective. For example, with the QoE/QoS data of communication
services collected from vertical application layer, SA6 may need to provide
some value-added communication services management and/or assurance services.
It is not clear how to expose the communication service management service
from application perspective with providing additional value on top of
existing SA5 solution.
Hence, it is required to study the following issues:
\- What kinds of service APIs are required to be supported for application
layer exposure of communication services life cycle management?
\- What kinds of additional service APIs are required to be supported for
application layer exposure of communication services SLA assurance?
\- How to support above capabilities in the enable layer?
\- How to coordinate with SA5 functionalities to fill the gap between the
communication services (from the verticals\' point of view) and the 5G
network.
## 5.6 Key issue 6: Application layer QoS verification capability enablement
In clause 6.23 of TS 22.261 [7], it is defined the requirements about QoS
monitoring that 5G system shall be able to assessing and assuring the
dependability of the communication services.
In clause F.1 of TS 22.261 [7], it is discussed how QoS monitoring information
can be used for assurance purposes. In step \"Customer rating of QoS\", it
mentions that the customer can compare the QoS achieved by the provider with
the QoS requirements and its own experience of the QoS.
In clause SA5 TS 28.552 [12], it defined QoS measurements reports with
different Filters from perspective of OAM, e.g. 5QI, QIC, S-NSSAI, PLMN.
In some cases, the verticals and the service provider reach an agreement on
the SLA, however with this SLA requirement, the VAL client may also suffer
unsatisfied experience. Hence, it could be possible to provide Vertical
application layer the capability of comparing the QoS achievement status
together with the OAM QoS data versus real customer QoS data (e.g., MOS)
collected from VAL client to check whether the existing QoS data is able to
satisfy the VAL client\'s.
It is not clear how to expose the QoS verification capabilities on top of
existing SA5 solution.
Hence, it is required to study the following issues:
\- What kinds of additional service APIs are required to be supported for
application layer enablement of QoS verification?
\- What kinds of additional service APIs are required to obtain the real
vertical QoS to support the QoS verification?
\- How to support above capabilities in the enable layer?
## 5.7 Key issue 7: Network slice related performance and analytics exposure
As specified in clause 6.10 of 3GPP TS 22.261 [7], 5G network is requested to
support a 3^rd^ party to get the network status information of a private slice
dedicated for the 3^rd^ party. The 5G network collects various kinds of data,
such as performance measurements in TS 28.552 [12] and analytics data as
specified in 3GPP TS 28.104 [15] and the analytics data from NWDAF and NSACF
exposed by NEF. However, to get the information efficiently, the verticals are
supposed to know, which entity to interact with to get the desired
information, how to extract useful information from data which is collected
using different statistical methods from different entities, which is
challenging for some verticals. The network slice capability exposure enabler
layer can aggregate and process the data from different source, making the
network information exposure more orderly and easier to read. For example, for
the slice related performance and analytics come from multiple sources, the
enabler layer could help to organize and aggregate the information. For some
applications utilizing multiple S-NSSAI, the enabler layer could help to
organize and aggregate the information so that it is exposed and displayed
based on the application level rather than slices level.
Hence, it is required to study the following:
\- Whether and how information about available (SA2 and SA5) slice performance
and analytics should be exposed to a third party with added value?
\- Whether and how available slice performance and analytics related
information could be aggregated or processed to support an efficient
information exposure?
\- Whether and how additional service APIs are required to be supported at
SEAL for the network slice measurements and analytics exposure?
\- Whether and how CAPIF can be leveraged for additional service APIs?
## 5.8 Key issue 8: Support for requirements translation
Requirements for network slice from different verticals may vary from one to
another, in terms of performance and capability requirements. For example, for
the performance related requirements, the live video streaming cares more on
bandwidth while V2X cares more on latency and jitters. For the capabilities
related requirements, V2X may requests the positioning while future factory
may request the self-control and management. To satisfy the requirements,
vertical has to interact with several 5GS entities and understand the specific
network parameters, such as the attributes in the service profile as defined
in TS 28.541 [14]. Slice enabler layer could act as a mediator between the
vertical customer and the 5GS to decompose and translate the requirements.
Besides, the verticals are more focused on the KQI or QoE of the applications
and services. For example, in a scenario of future factory, the robots are
used to enable the intelligent delivering, the third-parties have a
requirement on the application latency between the robots and the robots
control system, the slice enabler may decompose this application latency
requirement to 5GS network latency requirement (e.g., the network latency
requirements specified in TS 28.541[14] as _packet transmission latency
(millisecond) through the RAN, CN, and TN part of 5G network_ or _the UL/DL
packet delay measurement between UE and PSA UPF for a QoS Flow_ defined in TS
23.501[3]) and forward it to the 5GS systems. Another example is that to
support the service of the imaging for professional applications as defined in
TS 22.261[7], the imaging system latency of the application as defined in TS
22.263[x] is required which may not only depends on the 5GS network
transmission latency but also will be influenced by the network throughput and
network bandwidth. The NSCE are responsible for the translation from the
vertical\'s KQI/QoE requirements to 5GS network requirements based on the
knowledge of the industry profiles and 5G network (the definition of the
KQI/OoE is service and application specific and is out the scope of this
study).
However, to cope with the various requirements, it is needed to specify the
operations and procedure on how to translate them more efficiently, such as in
the unified manner with unified format/model/template. In such way, the slice
enabler layer is capable of translating requirements from the vertical, to
service consumption or service API invocation and configurations to the
respective 5GS domains. The service could be provided from control plane,
management plane and SA6 slice enabler layer itself, or the combinations of
services above.
There are two main aspects in requirements translation: 1) one is how the
vertical requirements could be collected, whether and how the template is
needed? 2) The other is how to transfer the requirements into actions, whether
and how API translation is needed?
This key issue aims to discuss how to configure and translate the requirements
to service consumption and configuration in a way that the slice capability
exposure is 1) agnostic to the underlying telecom infrastructure, 2) hides the
complexity of telecom infrastructure, 3) doesn\'t impact/restrict the level of
exposure to the vertical and 4) that is resilient to dynamic changes that may
happen due to application portability or telco-provided API status changes.
Therefore, the open issues include:
\- Whether and how the vertical requirements could be collected at the slice
enabler to allow the translation to network service consumption and
configuration,
\- Whether and how API translation is needed to support the requirements
translation.
## 5.9 Key issue 9: Support for trust enablement
A vertical application may use the slice enabler services (which can be seen
as a trusted 3^rd^ party to the MNO) to request management services as well as
control plane services for a new slice on demand, based on an agreement
between the vertical and the network slice provider.
However, the creation of a new slice will require a form of trust between the
vertical/end application and the 5GS (management and control plane) for
authorizing/authenticating the application request and enabling the vertical
app to consume management / control services related to the requested slice.
The vertical application may not be trusted by the OAM or the 5GC, and is
therefore not able to access management and control services. Also, there can
be two way of accessing these services after authorization, via direct
exposure or indirectly via the enabler server.
So, the key issue will study:
\- How to enable the authorization/authentication of the vertical application
to consume telco-provided services (management and control plane), based on
the vertical applications request.
\- How to enable the authorization/authentication of the vertical application
to consume telco-provided services (management and control plane) indirectly
via the slice enabler layer, based on the vertical applications request.
## 5.10 Key Issue 10: Support for managing trusted third-party owned
application(s)
As per 3GPP TS 22.261 [7], it is possible for trusted third-party to use a
dedicated network slice for diverse use cases. Further, it provides following
requirement to manage applications:
\"_Based on operator policy, a 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow
a trusted third-party to manage this trusted third-party owned application(s)
in the operator\'s Service Hosting Environment._ \"
It is also possible for the third-party to offer its consumers different
contract qualities level (e.g. gold, silver and bronze). In clause 5.7.1 of
3GPP TR 22.835 [9], following use case has been specified:
\"_For gaming or online video applications, the end users, who have
subscription with MNOs who may provide multiple network slices to different
users or services, may still have different priority or membership e.g. VIP
maintained by 3^rd^ party Service Provider (SP). And depending on the priority
or membership information from 3^rd^ party SP perspective, based on the
agreement between SP and MNO, the UE have different priority for the available
network slices._ \"
In clause 4.2.11.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [4] specifies following:
_\"When for all the Requested S-NSSAI(s) provided in step 2 the NSACF returned
the maximum number of UEs per network slice has been reached and if one or
more subscribed S-NSSAIs are marked as default in the subscription data and
not subject to Network Slice Admission Control, the AMF can decide to include
these Default Subscribed S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI. Otherwise, the AMF
rejects the UE request for registration. In the Registration Reject message
the AMF includes the rejected S-NSSAI(s) in the rejected NSSAI parameter, and
for each rejected S-NSSAI the AMF includes a reject cause to indicate that the
maximum number of UEs per network slice has been reached and optionally a
back-off timer.\"_
Upon reaching maximum UEs slice quota, the 5GC may reject the registration
request on the S-NSSAI from the gold quality level customer which may not be
desirable by the trusted third party. This happens since 5GC is not aware of
the relevant application information e.g. contract qualities level of the UE
making the registration request.
The third party application needs to provide high priority to the higher level
of contract qualities and so it needs to manage such connections.
It is also specified in 3GPP TS 22.261 [7] that the 5G system shall support a
mechanism to optimize resources of network slices (e.g., due to operator
deploying different frequency to offer different network slices) based on
network slice usage patterns and policy (e.g., application preference) of a UE
or group of UEs.
In particular, this KI will address:
\- Whether and how the AF can provide application policy information to the
operator\'s Service Hosting Environment to enable automatic management of
application resources?
\- What application policy information needs to be specified by the trusted
third-party AF that can be automatically evaluated by the operator\'s Service
Hosting Environment?
\- Whether and how the AF can manage use of the application resources in the
operator\'s Service Hosting Environment on a per user characteristic?
## 5.11 Key issue 11: Slice requirement alignment
As described in clause 6.1.2.2, TS 22.261[7], _the 5G system shall allow the
operator to create, modify, and delete a network slice_ , verticals have
strong desires for the slice/service self-management. Initially, they may
translate the communication service parameters to slice parameters
(_serviceProfile_ provided to OAM as defined SA5) and order a slice with
certain slice requirements parameters and their values.
The verticals will put their best effort into slice requirements translation.
However, they are not able to guarantee that all the potential factors will be
considered to generate the optimal slice requirements parameters on the first
try. After the service is executed on the required slice, the slice may not
fully match the service real-time running conditions, for example, maybe only
60% of the slice resource is used to support the service, and rest of the
slice resource is always idle, or the slice resource is insufficient due to
under-provisioning. Or in some cases, there may be some unforeseen exceptions
(e.g., unexpected traffic changes) and the current configured slice
requirements parameters are not able to fulfil the requirements, for example,
more resources are required to address the exceptions.
In order to achieve the maximum return of investment and ensure the
slice/service self-management, the verticals expect a more optimal service
profile which contains the exact value of those slice requirements parameters
to support to the executing services\' demands, i.e., by monitoring the
network performance statistics to align the slice requirements between
verticals and network providers. Furthermore, the action of alignment is not
triggered by a single event but considers the statistics of the network
performance during a certain time period. From the management perspective,
third-party is able to modify the slice requirements (_serviceProfile_ defined
in TS 28.541[14]) by perform the operation of _modifyMOIAttributes_ listed in
table 6.1-1 in TS 28.531[5] to support the slice requirements alignment.
This key issue is to study how to enable better alignment between the vertical
needs and the slice requirements parameters.
NOTE: All the potential changes to the slice are based on existing SA2 and SA5
service/capability.
Open issues:
\- Whether and How the SEAL network slice capability management service
supports better alignment between vertical needs and slice requirements
parameters for initial service requirements and ongoing service conditions?
\- How does the SEAL network slice capability management service determine and
indicate that VAL server policy (e.g., requirements provided when adding or
changing slices) requests or actions result in suggested changes to the NSCE
service provider policy (e.g., allowed NS profile operations or parameter
ranges) or to VAL policies?
## 5.12 Key issue 12: Network slice capability exposure in the edge data
network
The network slice deployed in the core network has a certain distance from the
customer, so the delay will be affected to a certain extent and cannot meet
the operation requirements of low latency equipment. Moreover, a variety of
service data need to be processed in the core network, the scale of data
traffic is large, the backhaul network needs to bear a large load and consume
more bandwidth. For example, the differential protection service has strict
requirements for latency in power industry.
In order to meet the personalized services requirements of vertical
industries, network slices are deployed by using the computing, storage and
communication capabilities of the edge date network, so as to realize the
localized processing of the service, reduce the service transmission latency
and enhance the service performance.
How to expose the network slice capability deployed in the edge data network
to the vertical industry or the third parties is worthy of our study.
Open issues:
\- How could the NSCE server deployed inside the EDN interact with the NSCE
server outside the EDN? Whether and how could the NSCE server interact with
other NSCE serve?
\- Whether and how could the NSCE server inside the EDN manage the network
slice that has resource outside the EDN?
\- Whether and how does SEAL need to be enhanced to support NSCE client to
interact with NSCE server in the EDN and NSCE server outside the EDN?
## 5.13 Key issue 13: Delivery of the existing Network Slice information to
the trusted third-party
There are many requirements on Network Slice Exposure specified in clause 6.10
of 3GPP TS 22.261 [7].
_Based on operator policy, a 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow a
trusted third-party to create, modify, and delete network slices used for the
third-party._
_Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow
a trusted third-party to monitor the network slice used for the third-party._
_Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow
a trusted third-party to define and update the set of services and
capabilities supported in a network slice used for the third-party._
_Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow
a trusted third-party to configure the information which associates a UE to a
network slice used for the third-party._
_Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow
a trusted third-party to configure the information which associates a service
to a network slice used for the third-party._
_Based on operator policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow
a trusted third-party to assign a UE to a network slice used for the third-
party, to move a UE from one network slice used for the third-party to another
network slice used for the third-party, and to remove a UE from a network
slice used for the third-party based on subscription, UE capabilities, and
services provided by the network slice._
In order to satisfy the above requirements, the third party should know the
Network Slice existence in prior to the proper operation related to the
Network Slice.
The 3^rd^ party service providers may know the existence of Network Slice
through a way of delivery from the NSCE as an entity of NSP, which manages
information of Network Slice for the 3^rd^ party service providers. The
concept of Network slice delivery is described in TS 28.530 clause 4.1.8.
Which information should be contained and delivered is another important point
for delivery of the existing Network Slice. When 3^rd^ party service providers
activate the existing Network slice, 3^rd^ party service providers should
analyze the specific information of Network Slice such as set of service,
capability, QoE, bandwidth and so on in order to figure out to meet their
service requirements. What kind of information is necessary to 3^rd^ party
service providers may vary according to the services of the 3^rd^ party
service providers. With the regards, NSCE servers collect and manage
information on Network Slice which 5GS may provide. It may be enough to
indicate the standardized NEST (e.g, MBB, URLLC, massive IOT, etc.). Security
aspects have to be considered. If there is a need for resource reservation per
customer, then a dedicated slice is needed.
Open issues:
\- When does the Network Slice delivery occur?
\- Which information of Network Slice does need to be contained when
delivered? Or is it enough the delivery indicates the standardized NEST such
MBB, URLLC, massive IOT?
\- Whether and how management domain capabilities (e.g. MnS) corresponding to
the network slice need to be delivered via the NSCE server?
\- How the deployment of NSCE server (e.g. at NSP or NSC side) affects the
level of slice information to be delivered?
## 5.14 Key issue 14: Network Slice creation to the third-party and UE
The requirements specified in clause 6.10 of 3GPP TS 22.261 [7] says,
_Based on operator policy, a 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow a
trusted third-party to create, modify, and delete network slices used for the
third-party._
This requirement interprets that the third-party can allocate the Network
Slice for its service with suitable APIs provided by 5G Network. It can be
implemented based on whether an appropriate Network Slice for the third-party
service does exist or not. In case the appropriate Network Slice exists, the
third-party request to use the Network Slice for the service, and the
corresponding entities modifies the info of the Network Slice properly. In
case the appropriate Network Slice does not exist, then the third-party
request to create the new Network slice. This procedure should be handled with
interaction between VAL server, NSCE and 5G network. Security aspects have to
be considered. If there is a need for resource reservation per customer, then
dedicated slice is needed.
After the Network Slice allocation is requested, UE should be notified that
the Network Slice for the third-party service is used. It is obvious that the
UE utilizes the info of Network Slice in URSP or local configuration to
transport the data of the third-party service. With the regard, without
notification to the UE, the Network Slice will not be used for the service.
When notified, SA6 needs to take it consideration whether the notification is
transported over NSCE layer. If transported over NSCE layer, then it should be
considered whether UE applies the new allocated Network Slice into URSP.
NOTE 1: The application enablement layer will not circumvent nor try to
replace solutions required at the network layer defined by SA2 nor the
management layer defined by SA5.
Open Issues
\- What kind of information should be required for creating a new Network
Slice for the third-party service (between NSP and NSC)? Any minimum set of
information should be considered such as Service/Slice Type, Device Type or
QoS Index?
\- Whether and how is the notification transported over NSCE layer?
\- Whether does UE apply the new allocated Network Slice into URSP when
transported over NSCE layer?

## 6.1 Solution 1: Automatic application layer network slice management
### 6.1.1 Solution description
#### **6.1.1.1 General**
This solution aims to address the issues identified in Key Issue 2.
This solution provides a procedure for automatic application layer network
slice management performed by the network slice capability enablement server
based on network slice status collected from 5GS and **QoE collected from
application layer**.
When network slice capability enablement server receives a request for
automatic application layer network slice management from VAL server, the
network slice capability enablement server performs the service operations
including detecting and subscribing the event which may trigger the automatic
network slice lifecycle management, making the network slice lifecycle
management recommendation/decision, triggering the network slice management
operations, notifying the consumer about the network slice information.
#### **6.1.1.2 Automatic application layer network slice lifecycle
management**
Figure 6.1.1.2-1 illustrates **an automatic application layer network slice
lifecycle management solution based on network slice related data and QoE
collected from application layer.**
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL client has requested a network slice provisioning;
2\. The VAL server has subscribed to the network slice capability enablement
server for automatic network slice management;
3\. The network slice enabler layer is registered/capable for interacting with
5GS such as triggering network slice LCM operations, and has collected current
network slice capabilities.
Figure 6.1.1.2-1: Automatic application layer network slice lifecycle
management
1\. The vertical server sends a request for automatic application layer
network slice lifecycle management (auto-NS-LCM), with network slice
requirements (e.g. delay, throughput, load, the maximum number of users
supported, etc.). The request can indicate the level of auto-NS-LCM that is
required, such as whether to notify the VAL server/consumer before performing
the auto-NS-LCM. The request may also indicate the trigger conditions, such as
by providing the monitored parameters and the corresponding thresholds.
2\. After receiving the request, the network slice capability enablement
server checks that the user is authenticated and authorized to perform the
corresponding auto-NS-LCM operations, and filters the unauthorized requests,
if any.
3\. If authenticated and authorized, the network slice capability enablement
server, acting as the network slice LCM service consumer, triggers the
AllocateNsi request (see TS 28.531 clause 6.5.1 [5]) towards the respective
management service provider, based on the network slice capabilities and
network slice requirements.
4\. The network slice capability enablement server sends the auto-NS-LCM
response to the VAL server with the result(s) of the network slice LCM
operation(s).
5\. According to network slice requirements, network slice capability
enablement server triggers the provision of network slice status and QoE
metrics.
5a. The network slice status could be collected through subscribing or
requesting to 5GS. For example, to monitor the slice load, it could subscribe
to/request the relevant service(s), such as AnalyticsExposure defined in TS
23.502 [4] clause 5.2.6.16, provisioning data report exposure for NSI in
clause 5 of TS 28.532 [8]. If the trigger conditions are not indicated in the
subscription, the network slice capability enablement server may help to
configure an appropriate trigger condition, such as report period or
thresholds.
5b. Also, the network slice capability enablement server could get the
information of QoE metrics from the application layer domain.
6\. Once the trigger condition or a combination of trigger conditions are met,
based on requirements and network slice capabilities with updated information
in Step 5, such as change in QoE, change in network slice status etc., the
network slice capability enablement server determines whether and what network
slice LCM operations should be taken and makes the
decision(s)/recommendation(s), such as modifyNsi/AllocateNsi/DeallocateNsi
request as specified in TS 28.531 [5].
7\. Optionally, if it is indicated in the request to notify the VAL
server/consumer before performing the auto-NS-LCM, the network slice
capability enablement server sends the network slice LCM recommendation(s)
with network slice status to VAL server, to see whether takes the
recommendation(s) or not.
8\. Optionally, sending the response indicating the decision made by VAL
server to network slice capability enablement server.
9\. Based on decision made by VAL server or network slice capability
enablement server, the network slice capability enablement server performs the
corresponding operation(s).
10\. According to the corresponding operation(s) result, the network slice
capability enablement server sends the response to the VAL server.
### 6.1.2 Solution evaluation
The proposed solution addresses Key Issue #2. SA5 provides the network slice
lifecycle management, while this solution provides a procedure for automatic
application layer network slice management performed by the network slice
capability enablement server based on network slice status collected from 5GS
and QoE collected from application layer. With automatic application layer
network slice management, the consumer\'s requirement could be better met
without having to interact with 5GS frequently. This solution does not
introduce impact on 5GS architecture. It will possible need enhancement of SA6
SEAL architecture enhancement to support the interaction with OAM system, but
the interface for interaction with the OAM system is still being studied in
SA5.
## 6.2 Solution 2: Network slice fault management capability
### 6.2.1 Solution description
#### 6.2.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue 4 of network slice fault management
described in clause 5.4.
This solution provides a possible procedure to illustrate the network slice
fault management capability exposed by NSCE server.
To enable the VAL server to monitor the problems of a network, the NSCE layer
should help the VAL server to scanning, diagnosing and identifying problems
within a network. The performance data and alarm data from multiple sources is
helpful to characterize the quality of the network connection.
#### 6.2.1.2 Network slice fault management capability exposure
Figure 6.2.1.2-1 illustrates the network slice fault management process to
address the key issue 4 of network slice fault management described in clause
5.4.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL client has subscribed to the network slice fault management
capability.
2\. The network slice enabler layer is capable to interact with NEF and OAM
system.
3\. The VAL client has checked the status of application layer.
Figure 6.2.1.2-1: Network slice fault management process
1\. The VAL server sends a request to NSCE server to request for the fault
diagnosis of the applications and networks when it detected a fault in the
application layer, the services and the network slices. This request may be
triggered by the errors of the applications detected by the VAL server itself,
or the VAL server may periodically collect the fault diagnostic report
subscribing to the network slice fault management capability. The fault
information of applications may be included in this request. For example, the
Service Availability Failure Events e.g, described as Fallback events carried
out by the Dual SIM cellular device.
2\. On receiving the request from VAL server, NSCE server retrieves the
performance data of network slice from 5GS. For OAM system, the APIs defined
in clause 11.3, TS 28.532[8] is utilized. For CN functions, the APIs of
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service defined in clause 7.3, TS 23.288[17] can be
utilized.
> The analytics data defined in clause 6.3 to clause 6.14, TS 23.288[17],
> network slice instance related performance data defined in clause 5, TS
> 28.552[12] and network analytics data in clause 8.3 and clause 8.4 TS
> 28.104[15] exposed by OAM system may be acquired.
3\. NSCE server retrieves the alarms of network slice instances from OAM
system via the procedures defined in clause 6.1,TS 28.545[10], and the alarms
are defined in clause 4.1.1.1, TS 32.111-1 [16], e.g., the fault of
communication, environmental, equipment, processing error, QoS for
device/resource/file/functionality/smallest.
4\. NSCE server may request the alarm information (e.g., the 5GS network is
not work or the required performance is under the threshold which leads the
service\'s problem) collected by NSCE client if possible. The information
collected by the NSCE client depends on the third-parties\' requirements and
implementation.
5\. NSCE client report the requested fault information to NSCE server.
6\. NSCE server correlates the applications, services and the network
resources of the specific network slice instances which supports the
applications and services with the S-NSSAI, NSI ID (_nSInstanceId_ defined in
TS 28.541[14]), Application Identifier (defined in 23.501[3]), and then
diagnoses the causes of the fault of the applications or services by analysing
the fault information from different sources. For example, the RAN function of
the slice instance which is utilized to support the service of the smart grid
application, for a certain time duration, the smart grid suffered the bad
experience caused by Service Availability Failure Events, and in the RAN
function is detected continuously to report an alarm of environmental fault in
the same time duration, then the environment fault may be the root cause of
the Service Availability Failure and should be prioritized to be solved. The
fault may be identified with \"critical\", \"major\", \"minor\", \"ignore\" to
show its prioritization.
7\. NSCE server response to VAL server with the reports of fault diagnostic
result to indicate the causes of the failures of the applications or services.
If there is no problem within the 5GS network, the VAL server may be requested
to check the application layer itself again.
8\. If the NSCE server detects that the application/service error is caused by
the 5GS, the VAL server may send the fault diagnosis report to OAM system to
indicate the server fault which causes the application/service failure by
utilizing the NSCE-OAM interface.
NOTE: The APIs utilized to send the fault diagnosis report to OAM will re-
utilize the fault management services in TS 28.532[8] exposed by EGMF as
defined in TS 28.533[6].
### 6.2.2 Solution evaluation
The solution addresses the key issue #4 and this solution will have
interaction with both the 5GC and OAM to collect the alarm information and
network analytics data and also could acquire application fault data from VAL
server or VAL client. For the NSCE server and NSCE client, it will possible
need enhancement of the existed Rel-17 architecture to perform network and
service level diagnosis. Also, fault diagnosis service in service level should
also need to be added in the existed network architecture.
## 6.3 Solution 3: Slice API configuration and translation
### 6.3.1 Solution description
#### 6.3.1.1 General
This solution aims to address the issues identified in Key Issue 8.
This contribution provides a solution for the API configuration and
translation and proposes the translation of the service API as invoked by the
end applications to slice APIs based on the API configuration and application
to slice mapping. **Slice APIs can be defined as customized/tailored sets of
service APIs (which can be either NEF northbound APIs or OAM provided APIs or
enabler layer/SEAL provided APIs) and can be mapped to particular slice
instances. The slice APIs can be a bundled or combined API comprising of
different types of APIs, which will be used to expose the telco
(5GS/SEAL)-provided services as needed by the applications of the slice
customer. Each slice API may be configured per network slice instance.**
**This solution provides a support functionality to the vertical application
specific layer and configures the exposure of APIs in a slice-tailored manner.
It is assumed that the VAL server is not initially aware of the all the API
exposure capabilities and information which will be needed for the given slice
based on the SLA, and NSCE plays a vital role in configuring and translating
the slice API based on the per slice requirements to service APIs.**
This solution has two procedures:
\- a procedure on the slice API configuration
\- a procedure on the slice API translation
#### 6.3.1.2 slice API configuration
In this procedure, the VAL server initially provides an application
requirement to enabler server including the service KPIs and the
subscribed/preferred slices. Then, the slice enabler configures the mapping of
the VAL application to a slice API which is a combination/bundling of
northbound APIs (from both management and control plane). In particular, a
slice API (or SDK) consists of telco-provided/platform dependent service APIs
(e.g. NEF, OAM, SEAl, etc), and provides an abstraction/simplification on top
of them. The procedure also covers the scenario where a trigger event occurs
(e.g. QoS degradation, slice load) and the mapping configuration or the slice
API configuration needs to change. In this scenario, the slice enabler updates
the configuration of the API and provides a notification to the VAL server.
Figure 6.3.1.2-1 illustrates **a solution for the slice API configuration.**
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL server has registered to receive network slice capability
enablement services
Figure 6.3.1.2-1: Slice API configuration
1\. The VAL server sends a VAL application requirement request to the network
slice capability enablement server. This request provides the service
requirements / KPIs, the capability exposure requirements and a
preferred/subscribed slice identification (e.g. S-NSSAI or ENSI)
2\. The network slice capability enablement server maps the VAL application
requirement to a slice API which includes a list of APIs which are needed to
be consumed as part of this service capability exposure (such APIs can be NEF
APIs as specified in TS 29.522 clause 5 e.g. related to network monitoring,
slice status, analytics exposure, SEAL APIs as specified in TS 23.434, OAM
provided APIs). Such mapping can be determined at the network slice capability
enablement server based on the VAL application exposure requirements or can be
pre-configured per slice instance. The criteria for the mapping are the
capability exposure requirement per slice (based on GST parameters, or from
service/slice profile] as well as the capability exposure
permissions/authorization for the API invoker.
The network slice capability enablement server may also store the mapping of
the slice API to the service API list and per service API information (e.g.
data encoding, transport technology, API protocol and versions)
NOTE: For OAM provided APIs, the consumption of the network slice management
service related procedures are specified in TS 28.531[5].
3\. The network slice capability enablement server subscribes/registers to
consume the corresponding APIs from the 5GS (NEF and OAM) and SEAL service
producers. For example, network slice capability enablement server may
subscribe to consume NEF monitoring events, or SLA monitoring from OAM.
4\. The network slice capability enablement server sends a VAL application
requirement response to notify on the result of the request and indicate
whether configuration of the slice API can be possible or not.
5\. The network slice capability enablement server sends the slice API
information and optionally the slice to service API mapping to the VAL server.
6\. A trigger event is captured by the service/API providers (e.g. control
plane, management plane, SEAL) or the VAL server side (application server
relocation to different EDN/DN, UE mobility to different EDN, application
change of behaviour) or any other API related event captured by the network
slice capability enablement server (e.g. failure, unavailability, high load).
7\. The network slice capability enablement server processes the trigger event
and checks and updates the mapping of service APIs to the slice APIs. The
objective is to keep the slice APIs unchanged, so the VAL server is not aware
of any change (if not triggered by VAL server). To accomplish this, the
service APIs may need to be updated accordingly. For example, if one service
API changes (e.g. due to high load, unavailability, ..) the mapping to service
APIs should be updated (e.g. if service API is a Location API which is
provided by 5GC in the first place, the update would trigger the remapping to
a Location API from SEAL LMS) to avoid affecting the slice API.
8\. The network slice capability enablement server updates the
subscription/registration to the underlying 5GS and SEAL service producers, if
an update on the service APIs (e.g. NEF APIs, SEAL APIs, OAM provided APIs) is
needed.
9\. The network slice capability enablement server optionally notifies the VAL
server on the slice/service API related updates.
#### 6.3.1.3 Slice API translation
This procedure follows the 6.3.1.2 and aims to describe how the slice API
invocation request is translated to service API invocations after the slice
API configuration mapping. In this procedure, the network slice capability
enablement server initially receives a slice API invocation request from the
vertical application based on step 5 of 6.3.1.2. Then, the network slice
capability enablement server based on the slice API request fetches the
service APIs to be invoked based on the slice API configuration and performs
invocation requests to the corresponding service API providers.
As example, a slice API is requested for an IIOT slice. This may translate to:
NSI Monitoring from Management Domain #1, NSSI Monitoring from Management
Domain #2, network/QoS monitoring from NEF#1, Location monitoring from SEAL
LMS, slice-related analytics from NWDAF (via NEF). Such translation could be
based on the slice API configuration mapping of 6.3.1.2.
Figure 6.3.1.3-1 illustrates a solution for the slice API translation based on
the configuration.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL server has registered to receive network slice capability
enablement services.
2\. The slice API mapping to the VAL server has been performed based on
6.3.1.2 step 2 and the slice API information is provided to the VAL server
based on 6.3.1.2 step 5.
Figure 6.3.1.3-1: Slice API translation
1\. The VAL server sends a slice API invocation request to the network slice
capability enablement server. This request provides slice API information
(name, type, communication methods, protocols,..), based on the received
information in step 5 of 6.3.1.2. Service APIs are indicated above can be NEF
APIs as specified in TS 29.522, SEAL APIs as specified in TS 23.434, OAM
provided APIs)
NOTE 1: For OAM provided APIs, the consumption of the network slice management
service related procedures are specified in TS 28.531[5].
2\. After receiving the request, the network slice capability enablement
server checks that the user is authenticated and authorized to perform the
slice API invocation and maps the requested slice API to a service APIs (based
on the VAL server ID / slice ID and procedure in clause 6.6.1.2).
NOTE 2: If CAPIF is used, the network slice capability enablement server acts
as AEF, and the authorization is obtained by CCF.
3\. The network slice capability enablement server generates a trigger for
service API invocation requests to all the service APIs within the slice API.
4\. The network slice capability enablement server sends a service API
invocation request to the producers of the service APIs within the slice API.
This may include the originated service API invoker identity information (VAL
server) as well as the direct API invoker information, authorization
information, service API and slice API identification.
5\. The service API provider authenticates the API invoker and authorizes the
request.
NOTE 3: If CAPIF is used, the requests are sent to the corresponding AEFs of
the API provider\'s domain, and the authorization is obtained by CCF.
6\. The network slice capability enablement server receives the service API
invocation response as a result of the service API invocation.
7\. The network slice capability enablement server sends to the VAL server a
slice API invocation response as a result of the slice API invocation.
### 6.3.2 Solution evaluation
The solution addresses the key issue #8 on requirements translation; and
discusses the API translation and configuration aspects. Solution #3 requires
interaction with API producers in 3GPP network systems, based on already
defined procedures. This includes interaction with 5GC (acting as trusted AF)
for subscribing to and invoking NEF services; the interaction with OAM / MnS
producers (or EGMF) for consuming OAM services, and the interaction with SEAL
for invoking SEAL APIs.
The solution is feasible and proposes the enhancement NSCE server capabilities
to translate / bundle service APIs (of different producers and types) to slice
APIs. The definition of the slice APIs and the interaction with the VAL server
are expected to be specified during the normative phase.
## 6.4 Solution 4: QoS verification capability
### 6.4.1 Solution description
#### 6.4.1.1 General
This solution aims to address the issues identified in Key Issue 6.
This solution provides a procedure to illustrate the QoS verification
capability by the network slice capability enablement server.
To enable the VAL server to verify QoS data of a network, the NSCE layer
should help the VAL server to check whether the existing QoS data is able to
satisfy the VAL client\'s requirement.
#### 6.4.1.2 QoS verification capability
Figure 6.4.1.2-1 illustrates the QoS verification capability process to
address the key issue 6 of Application layer QoS verification capability
exposure described in clause 5.6.
> Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL client has subscribed to the QoS verification capability.
2\. The VAL client has subscribed to the capability of Network slice related
performance and analytics exposure.
3\. The network slice enabler layer is capable to interact with NEF/NWDAF and
OAM system.
Figure 6.4.1.2-1: QoS verification process
1\. The VAL server sends a request to NSCE server to verify the
service/application QoS data.
2\. On receiving the request form VAL server, NSCE server retrieves the QoS
data of network slice from 5GC and OAM system. For OAM system, the APIs
defined in clause 11.3, TS 28.532[15] is utilized, the performance data
specified in TS 28.552[12] and analytics data specified in TS 28.104[16] can
be collected. For CN functions, the APIs of Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service
defined in clause 7.3, TS 23.288[18] is utilized. The data of QoS information
defined in TS 23.501[3].
3\. NSCE server sends a request to application layer to request the QoE data
(e.g., MOS).
4\. VAL server sends the requested QoE data to NSCE server.
5\. NSCE server may send a request to NSCE client to collect the QoE data of
network and services if possible.
6\. NSCE client report the requested data collected by itself if possible, the
information collected by the NSCE client depends on the third-parties\'
implementations.
7\. NSCE server verifies and analyses QoS data of network slice instance,
Comparing QoS achieved status together with the OAM QoS data versus real
customer QoE data (e.g., MOS) collected from VAL client to check whether the
existing QoS data is able to satisfy the VAL client\'s to generate the QoS
verification report as required by VAL server for specific period of time.
8\. NSCE server sends the service/application QoS verification response to VAL
server.
### 6.4.2 Solution evaluation
The proposed solution addresses Key Issue #6, the solution provides a
procedure for application layer the capability of QoS verification by the
network slice capability enablement server, which has interaction with both
the 5GC and OAM to collect the QoS data from N33 and NSCE-OAM interface
respectively, acquires network and service QoE data from NSCE client by NSCE-
UU interface and obtains application QoE data from VAL server by NSCE-S
interface to compare QoE date and QoS data, checking whether the existing QoS
data is able to satisfy the real customer QoE data.
This solution does not introduce impact on 5GS architecture and SEAL
architecture, the NSCE server has the capability to translate and compare QoE
data and QoS data.\"
## 6.5 Solution 5: Network slice related performance and analytics exposure
### 6.5.1 Solution description
#### 6.5.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue 7 of performance and analytics exposure
described in clause 5.7.
This solution provides a possible procedure to illustrate the network slice
related performance and analytics exposure capability provided by network
slice capability enablement server.
To enable the third-party to adjust the network slice or to configure the
information which associates a service/UE to a network slice, the third-party
is allowed to monitor the performance data and analytics data of the network
slice, service or application. The network slice related performance data may
be collected from multiple sources (e.g., OAM system or 5GC functions) to help
the NSCE layer to perform data aggregation or analyses to generate the data
required by the third-party. The solutions of performance data and analytics
data exposed to the third-party needs to be studied.
#### 6.5.1.2 Network slice related performance and analytics exposure
Figure 6.5.1.2-1 illustrates the network slice related performance and
analytics exposure process to address the key issue 7 of performance and
analytics exposure described in clause 5.7.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL client has subscribed to the capability of Network slice related
performance and analytics exposure.
2\. The network slice enabler layer is capable to interact with NEF and OAM
system.
Figure **6.5.1.2-1:** Network slice related performance and analytics exposure
process
1\. The VAL server sends a request to NSCE server to collect the desired
service/application specific performance data and analytics data, the detailed
content of the reported data depends on the type of the application and
services (the KQI and QoE data may be included with in the request). For
example, the VAL may request the NSCE server to report the performance and
analytics report of the service of the imaging for professional applications.
The request may contain the interested geographical area.
NOTE 1: It is not shown in the figure that VAL client could also trigger
step1. It may be triggered by a specific event or request from the VAL client.
Besides, the VAL client can trigger this procedure if the performance issue
are detected by the VAL client itself.
NOTE 2: Both periodical or ad-hoc reporting are possible, the VAL layer can
request a periodical reporting or a one-off reporting. The result of the
reporting can be subscribed by the VAL layer; it can request both or any one
of them.
2\. The NSCE server shall check if the VAL server is authorized to get the
network slice performance and analytics data.
3\. On receiving the request from VAL server, NSCE server retrieves the
performance data and analytics data of network slice from 5GS. For OAM system,
the APIs defined in clause 11.3, TS 28.532[8] is utilized. For CN functions,
the APIs of Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service defined in clause 7.3, TS 23.288[17]
is utilized.
The performance and analytics data such as the Observed Service experience
statistics, Load level information of a Network Slice defined in TS
23.288[18], network slice status defined in TS 23.502[4] clause 5.2.21, and
analytics data defined in TS 23.288[17], network slice instance related
performance data defined in TS 28.552[12] and network analytics data in TS
28.104[15] exposed by OAM system may be acquired. For example, when the
performance and analytics report of the service of the imaging for a
professional application is required, the imaging system latency as defined in
TS 22.263[18] should be reported and analysed. In this case, the NSCE requests
the OAM system to report the one-way/Round-trip packet delay of a specific
S-NSSAI between PSA UPF and NG-RAN in clause 5.4, TS 28.552[12] and requests
the NWDAF to report the User Data Congestion Analytics report defined in
clause 6.8, TS 23.288[17].
4\. NSCE server retrieves the KQI data of services (e.g., the jitter duration
of a video service), the network performance related data and the end users
information (e.g., _5G UE\'s running time_) by following the procedures
defined in Figure **6.5.1.2.1-1 and** Figure **6.5.1.2.1-2**.
5\. NSCE server correlates and analyses the performance data of network slice
instance, the analytics data of group of UEs and the KQI/QoE data to generate
the performance data and analytics data report as required by VAL server for
specific period of time.
NOTE 3: How the data analytics correlation happens is out of scope of NSCALE
study
6\. NSCE server sends the service/application related performance data and
analytics response to VAL server. For example, when the performance and
analytics report of the service of the imaging for a professional application
is required, the report may acquire the calculated imaging system latency of
the application, and level (e.g., good, normal, poor) of the latency.
##### 6.5.1.2.1 KQI and performance data report from NSCE client
Figure 6.5.1.2.1-1 and 6.5.1.2.1-2 illustrate the procedure to acquire instant
KQI/performance data and KQI/performance data report from NSCE client
respectively.
Figure **6.5.1.2.1-1: Process of** instant KQI/performance data reporting
1\. NSCE server sends a request to NSCE client to ask for instantly reporting
of the KQI and performance (e.g., the jitter duration of a video service), the
network performance related data (e.g., the downlink/uplink RSRP of serving
cell measured by 5G UE) and the end users information (e.g., 5G UE\'s running
time).
NOTE 1: The APIs over the NSCE-UU interface utilized to achieve the instant
KQI/performance data from NSCE client is to be defined in normative work.
2\. On receiving the request described in step1, the NSCE client sends the
response to notify NSCE server whether the request is received successfully.
3\. NSCE client reports the requested data (e.g., the jitter duration of a
video service, _5G UE\'s running time_) once the data is measured.
NOTE 2: In this study, general functionalities and procedures of NSCE are
defined, the required data depends on the concrete scenarios. The data
measured by NSCE client may depend on the study of SEALDD.
Figure **6.5.1.2.1-2: Process of** reporting KQI/performance data
1\. NSCE server sends a request to NSCE client to request the report
collection of KQI data (e.g., the jitter duration of a video service), the
network performance related data and the end users information (e.g., 5G UE\'s
running time), and the time period of the data collection may be included in
this request.
NOTE 1: The APIs over the NSCE-UU interface utilized to achieve the instant
KQI/performance data from NSCE client is to be defined in normative work.
2\. On receiving the request described in step1, the NSCE client sends the
response to notify NSCE server whether the request is received successfully.
3\. NSCE server sends a request to retrieve the data desired report, the data
type and the time duration may be indicated in this request.
4\. NSCE client sends the requested data report (e.g., the report of the
jitter duration of a video service, 5G UE\'s running time) collected by
itself.
NOTE 2: In this study, general functionalities and procedures of NSCE are
defined, the required data depends on the concrete scenarios. The data
measured by NSCE client may depend on the study of SEALDD.
### 6.5.2 Solution evaluation
The solution addresses the key issue #7 and this solution will have
interaction with 5GC and OAM system to acquire KQI and performance data from
N33 and NSCE-OAM interface, it also acquires KQI and performance data from
NSCE Client by NSCE-UU interface. For the NSCE Client, it has the capabilities
of KQI and performance data measurement and collection from Unsce-c interface.
The data measurement may also depend with SEALDD. The NSCE Server could
capture the KQI and performance data from 5GC and OAM system as well as NSCE
Clients. The third applications or verticals can extract the performance data
of network and analysis result from NSCE Server.
## 6.6 Solution 6: VAL server authorization and authentication via slice
enabler layer
### 6.6.1 Solution description
#### 6.6.1.1 General
This solution aims to address the issues identified in Key Issue 9.
When a vertical application from third party wants to request management
services as well as control plane services for a new slice on demand, it needs
the authorization and authentication from 5GC. The vertical application may
not be trusted by the OAM or the 5GC, it needs to interact with OAM and 5GC
via the enabler server.
#### 6.6.1.2 VAL server authorization and authentication via slice enabler
layer
Figure 6.6.1.2-1 illustrates the VAL server authorization and authentication
via slice enabler layer.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NSCE server can be seen as a trusted AF to interact with 5GC and has
registered to the OAM.
2\. The NSCE server has been authorized to act as a middle layer to do the
authentication and authorization.
Figure 6.6.1.2-1: VAL server authorization and authentication via slice
enabler layer
1\. The vertical server sends a request for authorization and authentication
to the NSCE server with its identity and the requested network slice
management and control capability (e.g. request for establish a new network
slice).
2\. After receiving the request, the NSCE server authenticates and authorizes
the VAL server based on its identity and requested capability.
The procedure of authentication and authorization could refer to API invoker
authenticate and authorize as specified in TS 23.222[20] clause 8.10.3 and
8.11.3, if applicable.
NOTE: the authentication and authorization mechanism will be in scope of SA3.
3\. Upon authorized and authenticated, NSCE server sends the authorization and
authentication response and information to VAL server with the token.
4\. The NSCE server triggers the network slice management and control
operation.
### 6.6.2 Solution evaluation
The solution 6 proposed the producer of authorization and authentication for
VAL server to address the Key Issue 9. As an authorized middle layer, the NSCE
server authenticates and authorizes the VAL server based on its identity and
requested capability. The API invoker authenticate and authorize
functionalities of CAPIF could be utilized if applicable. After that, the VAL
server can be trusted by 5GC and OAM.
The solution is feasible. And this solution does not introduce impact on 5GS
architecture and SEAL architecture.
## 6.7 Solution 7: network slice capability registration
### 6.7.1 Solution description
#### 6.7.1.1 General
This solution aims to address the issues identified in Key Issue 3.
This solution provides a possible procedure to perform the VAL server
registration.
The vertical enablement layer (SEAL, vertical-specific enablers) supports the
exposure of telco provided services to the VAL. After registered in the
enablement layer, the VAL server could be authorized to access network slice
related exposure capabilities, e.g. monitoring of network/UE performance.
#### 6.7.1.2 Capability exposure registration
Figure 6.7.1.2-1: Capability exposure registration
1\. The VAL server sends the registration request to the NSCE server with its
identity, and may also include interested service and level of exposure
requirement.
2\. The NSCE server does the registration check by verifying whether all the
necessary information has been provided and is reasonable. If the VAL server
is already registered with the same registration information, the request will
be rejected by the NSCE server. If the VAL server is already registered and
updated information is received in the registration request, the request will
be accepted by the NSCE server and the existing registration context of that
VAL server will be updated based on the latest registration request.
The procedure of registration check could refer to API invoker on-boarding as
specified in TS 23.222[20] clause 8.1.3 if applicable.
3\. After the registration procedure, the NSCE server sends the response to
the VAL server indicating could initiate the authorization and authentication
and further to do the service discovery.
### 6.7.2 Solution evaluation
This solution solves the Key Issue 7 by proposing a procedure to register the
VAL server in the slice enabler layer. The on-boarding functionalities of
CAPIF could be utilized if applicable. This solution does not introduce impact
on 5GS architecture and SEAL architecture.
## 6.8 Solution 8: Discovery of management service exposure
### 6.8.1 Solution description
#### 6.8.1.1 General
This solution aims to address the issues identified in Key Issue 3 and more
specifically the first open issue supporting the discovery of the offered
slices and the offered management services related to these slices, to the
vertical/ASP. This solution also addresses partially Key Issue #13, and in
particular the point on \"Whether and how management domain capabilities (e.g.
MnS) corresponding to the network slice need to be delivered via the NSCE
server?\"
To be able to utilise capabilities/features of the management system the
applications must be made aware of existence of such features and
capabilities. All management domain (MD) features/capabilities come with a
pre-configured exposure, where this can be configured by the operator for a
given slice. This exposure is used to decide which application can see which
information regarding the capability/feature. Exposure refers to the
permissions that the 3^rd^ party entity has gained over its use of the
management service, e.g., the ability to read, or execute or modify or delete
can be considered as different sorts of exposure.
A MD feature/capability is anything of use offered by the management system to
the 3^rd^ party application. Therefore, a new feature could be a managed
entity, a MnS or management API, any software, hardware, or other
functionality -- for example, new technology support, new coverage area, new
network slice type or instance, new NFs or new network slice subnet type or
instance.
This solution provides a mechanism which is aligned with SA5 ongoing work
related to the MnS registry exposure for external discovery (see TR 28.824
clauses 5.4 and 7.1), which enables the initial discovery of MnS for a given
slice based on VAL server request, and the discovery of new/modified MnS.
#### 6.8.1.2 Procedure
In this procedure, the VAL server initially requests the new MnS which are
supported by a target slice and based on this request the NSCE server requests
from the OAM the MnS discovery (via EGMF). Then, the OAM/MnS registry derives
the details to be exposed based on the NSCE server/VAL server permissions and
provides the list of MnS for the given slice and the access details via the
NSCE server to the VAL server. This procedure also includes the case when a
new/modified MnS is deployed at the MD for the given slice, and the OAM/MnS
registry provides this information directly to VAL server via EGMF (assuming
that VAL server has registered to the MD).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL server has registered to receive NSCE services
2\. The NSCE server is trusted by the 3GPP MD.
3\. MnS registry at OAM is aware of the allowed MnS and the exposure levels
for a given slice
Figure 6.8.1.2-1 illustrates **a solution for the MnS discovery support.**
Figure 6.8.1.2-1: MnS discovery support
**The steps of this embodiment are as follows:**
1\. The VAL server requests from NSCE server the expected exposure capability
type and the related exposure level for a target slice or for a given VAL
application, using the VAL application ID, the MD ID and optionally the slice
ID.
2\. The NSCE server translates the expected exposure capability type in to MnS
exposure requirement.
3\. The NSCE server coordinates with the 5GS and discovers the related network
service(s), by triggering the MnS service discovery as specified in TS
28.533[6], clause5.1.1 and 6.1.1. The 5GS, acting as the discovery service
producer, sends the discovery result including related exposure information
such as management service identifier, management service information and
management service producer information to the NSCE server.
4\. The NSCE server sends the service/management data based on step 3,
including the list of MnS and the corresponding exposure details to the VAL
server. Here to mention that based on exposure level, the exposure details may
be different.
5\. VAL server registers to NSCE server for the management domain capability
exposure for the subscribed slice.
The registration procedure of the VAL server to NSCE server for management
capability exposure is based on Solution #7.
6\. The MnS registry discovers new or modified MnS in the 3GPP MD. The MnS
registry derives the details to be exposed to the VAL server (via the NSCE
server), based on the exposure level configured by the new or modified MnS and
the exposure levels of registered VAL applications and NSCE server. The MnS
change could be triggered due to changes on:
\- New/modified management service producers
\- New/modified managed entities -- such as new radio, new technology or new
NFs
\- New/modified technical support -- such as support in a new geography or
coverage area
\- Availability of new management data -- e.g. related to slice performance
7\. The MnS registry sends to the NSCE server the new / modified MnS, as
discovered in step 6.
8\. The information on the discovered new/modified MnS is sent from the NSCE
server to VAL server.
### 6.8.2 Solution evaluation
The solution addresses the key issue #3 and key #13; and in particular the
discovery aspects related to the MnS exposure. Solution #8 is non-overlapping
and complementary to Solution #7 (which describes the Registration aspects).
This solution is viable and important for allowing the VAL server to discover
the MnS from OAM initially and based on MnS updates from the 3GPP MD. This
solution will interact with OAM initially to trigger MnS service discovery and
also OAM when new or modified MnS parameters change, it will inform NSCE
server on the updated/new MnS info. This solution uses already supported SA5
capabilities when interacting with OAM.
## 6.9 Solution 9: Support for managing trusted third-party owned
application(s)
### 6.9.1 Solution description
#### 6.9.1.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue 10 for managing trusted third-party
owned application(s) as specified in clause 5.10.
This solution provides a possible procedure to illustrate **the process of the
VAL server requesting to manage network slice quota to NSCE server**. This
solution enables the trusted third-party AF to provide application policy
information to the operator\'s Service Hosting Environment. This solution also
enables automatic management of application resources.
#### 6.9.1.2 Network slice quota management capability exposure
Figure 6.9.1.2-1 illustrates the network slice quota management process to
address the key issue 10 for managing trusted third-party owned
application(s).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The network slice enabler layer is capable to interact with NEF.
Figure 6.9.1.2-1: Network slice quota management process
1\. The VAL server initiates network slice quota management request towards
the NSCE server. The request includes VAL service ID, Slice identity, identity
of the type of the quota, specific type of action to take (e.g. release low
priority users as identified by 5GC, release list of users as identified by
the VAL server, etc) and optionally list of UEs on which specific action to
apply. The message also includes unique identity for the request in order to
update or cancel the action based on change of the requirement or service
provider\'s policy.
2\. Upon receiving the request from the VAL server to manage the network slice
quota, the NSCE server authorises the VAL server and if VAL server is
authorized, the NSCE server subscribes to the network slice quota events. The
NSCE server includes possible actions (e.g. maximum number of UEs per slice is
reached, etc) expected from 3GPP core network upon reaching the network slice
quota threshold.
NOTE: The network slice quota events is not supported in release 18.
3\. The NSCE server sends the network slice quota management response
specifying the result.
4\. Upon receiving notification from the 5GC/NEF about network slice quota
threshold, the NSCE server may request the 5GC to perform specific action if
not specified already.
### 6.9.2 Solution evaluation
The proposed solution addresses Key Issue #10. This solution enables NSCE
server to request the 5GC to perform specific action upon reaching network
slice quota threshold. While SA2 has no mechanisms for AF managing UEs with
different qualities/priority level within a slice in release 18.
## 6.10 Solution 10: Network slice application policy management capability
### 6.10.1 Solution description
#### 6.10.1.1 General
This solution aims to address the issues identified in Key Issue 10.
This solution provides a possible procedure to illustrate the process of the
VAL server requesting to manage network slice through NSCE server when
reaching UEs slice quota threshold. This solution enables the trusted third-
party AF to provide network slice access management policy based on the UE\'s
priority, contract qualities level, etc. This solution also helps to avoid
traffic loss in case of slice congestion and make adjustment beforehand
considering the application policy from AF.
#### 6.10.1.2 Network slice application policy management capability
Figure 6.10.1.2-1 illustrates the application policy capability process to
address the key issue 10 described in clause 5.10.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL server is authorized to use the slice event reporting exposure and
slice adaptation trigger capability.
2\. The network slice enabler layer is capable to interact with
NEF/NWDAF/NSACF and OAM system.
3\. NSCE has added UEs to different slices based on UE priority, QoS
reservation. High priority UEs with dedicated reserved resources are in one
slice.
Figure 6.10.1.2-1: Network slice application policy management process
1\. The VAL server initiates network slice event reporting exposure request
towards the NSCE server. The request includes VAL service ID, Event Filter
(such as slice identity, event type, etc.), Event Reporting filter (such as
whether the notification is threshold based or periodical). The message also
includes notification threshold or periodicity based on the Event Reporting
filter settings.
2-3. Upon receiving the request from the VAL server to manage the network
slice quota event reporting, the NSCE server authorises the VAL server and if
VAL server is authorized, the NSCE server subscribes to the network slice
quota (the number of UE or PDU sessions) events, including the slice identity
(S-NSSAI) and threshold/periodicity information. According to 3GPP TS 23.502
[4], there can be multiple NSACFs serving the same network slice and different
threshold can be set based on the policy of trusted third-party AF. The event
subscription procedure is described in clause 4.15.3.2.10 of TS 23.502 [4],
and the APIs defined in clause 6.2 of TS 29.536 [22] can be utilized.
4\. The NSCE server receives the network slice event notification response
specifying the result after 5GC confirms the subscription.
5-6. When the event (e.g. the number of UE or PDU sessions has reached the
threshold for specific slice) happens, the notification is sent from 5GC to
NSCE server including the Event Reporting information (such as percentage of
the maximum number of UEs or percentage of the maximum number of the PDU
Sessions established on the network slice). The event notification procedure
is specified in clause 4.15.3.2.10 of TS 23.502 [4].
7\. The notification is forwarded from NSCE server to VAL server including the
Event ID, Event filter and Event reporting information.
8\. The VAL server initiates network slice adaptation trigger request to the
NSCE server.
9\. The NSCE server retrieves the network slice related status information
from 5GC and OAM. For OAM system, the services defined in clause 11.3 of TS
28.532 [8] and clause 5 of TS 28.552 [12] can be utilized. For CN functions,
the services of Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service defined in clause 7.3 of TS
23.288 [17] can be utilized.
10\. The NSCE server makes network slice adaptation analysis on network status
information from 5GS and makes slice adjustment decision. NSCE server can make
slice lifecycle management operations for specific slice as specified in step
11.
11\. The NSCE server determines whether and what network slice LCM operations
should be taken and makes the decision(s)/recommendation(s) (e.g. to allocate
more RAN resources for UEs with high priority), such as modifyNsi request as
specified in TS 28.531 [5].
### 6.10.2 Solution evaluation
The proposed solution addresses Key Issue #10, the solution provides a high
level procedure for the capability of network congestion handling when
reaching UEs slice quota threshold. Based on VAL request, the NSCE server can
define preferred slice maximum capacity threshold and get notification when
the threshold is reached. Both the 5GC and OAM can be interacted by NSCE
server to collect slice related status information. Based on VAL request, the
NSCE server can make adjustment slice resource allocation (max number of
registered UEs and max number of PDU sessions) having in mind the increased
demand. SA5 has defined slice service profile parameters modification (as
specified in TS 28.541 [14]) to change the maximum number of UEs/maximum
number of PDU sessions in a slice. This solution does not introduce impact on
5GS architecture, the NSCE server has the capability to analyze network status
data and decide how to make slice resource adjustment. The NSCE server can
potentially have lack of knowledge of the actual hardware limitations of
5GC/NSACF. During normative phase it would be decided if NSCE server will
manage RAN parameters for slice adaptation. It might be the case that SA5 has
its own solution for adapting network slice capacity (max number of registered
UEs and max number of PDU sessions per slice). During normative phase it will
be decided if the NSCE server shall inform the VAL server about the result of
NSCE slice adaptation. During the normative phase actual APIs will be
described. The SA6 SEAL will possibly need enhancement to support the
interaction with 5GS and OAM system.
## 6.11 Solution 11: Communication service management exposure
### 6.11.1 Solution description
#### 6.11.1.1 General
This solution aims to address the issues identified in Key Issue 5.
This solution provides a procedure for communication services management
including the communication service lifecycle and communication assurance
performed by the network slice capability enablement server.
To enable the verticals to create/modify/disengagement a communication
service, the NSCE layer helps the VAL server to subscribe the slice services
to allocate the network slices to fulfil the communication services. Also the
NSCE server is able to perform the network slice related analyses to help the
verticals to assure the communication service.
#### 6.11.1.2 Use Case of Communication service lifecycle management
Figure 6.11.1.2-1 illustrates one possible procedure of communication service
management to address the communication service lifecycle management and
communication service assurance
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL client ordered slice services to offer its communication services.
2\. The network slice enabler layer is registered/capable for interacting with
5GS such as triggering network slice LCM operations.
Figure 6.11.1.2-1: Communication service creation
1\. The VAL server sends a request to NSCE server to create a communication
service, e.g., the VAL server requests to create a video service in a future
factory, the requirements of the video service (for instance, the service ID,
the number of the UEs, the coverage area of the video service, the mobility
information of the UEs, the resolution of the video service) is included in
this request.
2\. NSCE server translates the communication service requirements (e.g., for a
video service, the mobility information and the resolution of the video) then
determines the network SLA (e.g., _dLtThptPerSlice_ , _uLtThptPerSlice_ ,
latency as defined in _serviceProfile_ TS 28.541[14]). The NSCE may perform
the translation by pre-configured industry profiles or by KQI-KPI translation
algorithms which are out scope of standard.
3\. NSCE server initiates the Slice Service subscription procedures by
utilizing the management service of network slice creation as defined in
clause 6.1, TS 28.531[5] exposed by EGMF defined in SA5. The slice creation
request may fail due to the shortage of network resources.
4\. NCSE server sends the communication service creation response to VAL
server. If the slice creation failed in step3, the NSCE server may ask the VAL
sever to modify the service requirements.
Figure 6.11.1.2-2: Communication service modification
1\. VAL server sends the communication service reconfiguration request to the
NSCE server to reconfigure the properties of the communication service if the
SLA is not able to satisfy current service requirements (e.g., reconfigure the
resolution requirements of the communication service) or the VAL server
predicts that service requirements changes sometime in the future (e.g., some
new cameras are to be supported).
2\. NSCE server translates the communication requirements according the
reconfigured communication properties then updates the network SLA.
3\. NSCE server initiates the Slice Service update procedures by utilize the
management service of network slice modification as defined in clause 6.1, TS
28.531[5] exposed by EGMF defined in SA5.
4\. NCSE server sends the communication service modification response to VAL
server.
Figure 6.11.1.2-3: Communication service disengagement
1\. The VAL server sends a request to NSCE server to disengage the
communication service when the communication service ends.
2\. NSCE server initiates the Slice Service de-allocation procedures by
utilizing the management service of network slice de-allocation as defined in
clause 6.1, TS 28.531[5] exposed by EGMF defined in SA5.
3\. NCSE server sends the communication service disengagement response to VAL
server.
#### 6.11.1.3 Communication service creation
Figure 6.11.1.3-1: Communication service creation
Figure 6.11.1.3-1 shows the APIs of service subscription of communication
service creation as step 1 and step 4 of Figure 6.11.1.2-1.
#### 6.11.1.4 Communication service modification
Figure 6.11.1.4-1: Communication service reconfiguration
Figure 6.11.1.4-1 shows the APIs of service subscription of communication
service reconfiguration as step 1 and step 4 of Figure 6.11.1.2-2.
#### 6.11.1.5 Communication service disengagement
Figure 6.11.1.5-1: Communication service reconfiguration
Figure 6.11.1.5-1 shows the APIs of service subscription of communication
service reconfiguration as step 1 and step 3 of Figure 6.11.1.2-3.
### 6.11.2 Solution evaluation
The solution addresses the key issue #5 of communication service management
exposure. In this solution, the NSCE server interacts with VAL server to
acquire/update the requirements of the communication service if a
communication services is required to create/update. After the determination
of the SLA of network slice according to the communication services
requirements, the NSCE Server will have interactions with OAM system to
trigger the network slice allocation/modification/deallocation by utilize the
network slice related management services exposed by EGMF defined in SA5. The
existing management services defined in SA5 are able to support the solution
described in clause 6.11.1. The APIs over S-NSCE interface to be defined in
normative phase:
1\. APIs of service subscription of communication service creation (for
instance, to create a service, the service ID, the number of the UEs, the
coverage area of the service, the mobility information of the UEs)
2\. APIs of service subscription of communication service reconfiguration
3\. APIs of service subscription of communication service disengagement
## 6.12 Solution 12: SEAL enhancement
This solution aims to address the issues \"which enhancement to SEAL network
slice capability management service is required\" identified in Key Issue 1.
This solution illustrates the impact on SEAL by analyzing the existing
solutions.
### 6.12.1 Solution description
The following solutions provide the new service which could enhance the SEAL
network slice capability management service defined in TS 23.434;
\- Solution 1 provides the Automatic application layer network slice
management service based on the collected network slice status from 5GS and
QoE from application layer;
\- Solution 2 provides the Network slice fault management capability based on
collected alarm information from 5GS and application fault data from
application layer;
\- Solution 3 provides the Slice API configuration by mapping the VAL
application requirement to a slice API, and API translation service by mapping
the slice API to service API;
\- Solution 4 and solution 5 provide the QoS verification service and the
performance and analytics exposure based on the QoS and performance data 5GS,
and KQI and QoE data from NSCE Client.
\- Solution 8 provides the Discovery of management service exposure by
triggering the MnS service discovery;
\- Solution 9 provides a possible procedure to illustrate the process of the
VAL server requesting to manage network slice quota, but it does not specify
specific follow up action(s). Solution 10 provides the Network slice
application policy management capability based on slice quota by triggering
the network slice lifecycle management. Solution 20 provides service of AF
policy based network slice optimization by utilizing the network slice related
management services. The three solutions may be merged in the normative work
to enhance the SEAL.
\- Solution 11 provides the Communication service management exposure;
Solution 13 provides a Network Slice allocation service, where the NSCE layer
performs the Network Slice allocation operation on behalf of the VAL server,
and sends the allocated Network Slice information (e.g., S-NSSAI) to the NSCE
Client.
\- Solution 14 provides a service of information collection among the NSCE
servers. This service requires an interface between NSCE servers.
\- Solution 15 provides enhancements to the existing NSCE client functionality
by separating the network slice adaptation subscription/notification
functionality from the slice adaption triggering. Also, it enables the NSCE
server to receive location requirements, schedule time window requirements and
access type within the network slice adaptation request sent from the NSCE
client.
\- Solution 16 and solution 17 provide Multi-Network slice monitoring service
and Multi-Network slice resource optimization service for network slice from
multi-networks (e.g. the PNI-NPN network and PLMN network) through NSCE server
in a combined manner.
\- Solution 18 provides service of Network Slice Information delivery. It
could be done via request and subscribe/notify operation, also it could be
done along with the registration procedure.
\- Solution 19 provides service of slice requirement alignment by comparing
the slice requirements with network current situations to estimate if the
current slice requirements are properly configured.
\- Solution 21 provides service of predictive slice modification in edge based
NSCE deployments, which is mainly for the NSaaS scenario when an expected
migration happens for a UE or group of UEs from an EDN to another.
The following solutions could utilize the exiting services of CAPIF, and may
not introduce enhancement to SEAL.
\- Solution 6 provides the authorization and authentication capability.
\- Solution 7 provides the registration capability.
Solution 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 require the
interface between OAM and NSCE server (OAM-NSCE interface defined by SA5).
Solution 14, 16, 17, 21 require the interface between the NSCE servers (NSCE-E
interface). Therefore the SEAL NSCE architecture could consider to support the
NSCE-E interface.
### 6.12.2 Solution evaluation
This solution analyzes all the solutions that could provide services to
enhance SEAL service. The above analysis could be taken into consideration
while working on the conclusion.
## 6.13 Solution 13: Network Slice Allocation by VAL server
### 6.13.1 Solution description
#### 6.13.1.1 General
The NSCE layer performs the Network Slice allocation operation on behalf of
the VAL server. The non-trusted 3^rd^ party application (i.e., VAL server) can
not access to the 5GS management system directly. So, the NSCE server needs to
perform the authentication and authorization for the registration of VAL
server on behalf of 5G MnS. This procedure follows the clause 6.7 Solution 7
network slice capability registration.
The Network Slice creation that is triggered by the VAL server depends upon
network operator policy. The network slice capabilities and management options
offered to the customer are determined by a business agreement prior to and
outside of the scope of 3GPP standards.
The VAL server can identify the Network slice in Network Slice creation
request with the Network Slice indicator (e.g., S-NSSAI).
Upon network slice allocation, the NSCE server acts as the network slice
provisioning MnS consumer. The NSCE server requests \'AllocacatedNsi\'
operation to the network slice provisioning MnS producer as specified in TS
28.531. When the \'AllocatedNsi\' operation is received, the network slice
provisioning MnS Producer in 5GS performs charging mechanism as specified in
TS 28.202.
The NSCE server sends the allocated Network Slice information (e.g., S-NSSAI)
to the NSCE Client, after the Network Slice allocation to the VAL server is
successful.
NOTE: If the UE is provisioned with URSP rules by the network operator, the UE
handles the precedence between the delivered network slice info via NSCE layer
info and URSP rules as defined in 3GPP TS 23.503 [12] clause 6.1.2.2.1. How
the UE uses the Network Slice info delivered via NSCE layer in relation to the
URSP is implementation dependent.
With the above regards, The NSCE layer performs the below for the Network
Slice Allocation by the VAL server.
\- Network Slice Allocation operation on behalf of VAL Server as specified in
TS 28.531
\- Delivery of the Network Slice Allocation result
\- Delivery of the allocated Network Slice Information to NSCE client
The VAL server as a Network Slice consumer makes use of the APIs provided from
NSCE server to allocate the Network Slice for the Network Slice Lifecycle
management for its service.
#### 6.13.1.2 Network Slice Allocation by VAL Server
This subclause depicts the procedure of the Network Slice Allocation by the
VAL server, when the VAL server needs to allocate the Network Slice,
interaction with 5GS via the NSCE layer.
Figure 6.13.1.2-1: Network Slice Allocation by the VAL server
1\. The VAL server makes an request to create the Network Slice.
The VAL server specifies the Network Slice requirements for the VAL service.
The Network Slice requirement at the VAL server may be specified with the
attributes of GST (which results in NEST) as specified in GSMA NG.116.
2\. The VAL server requests the Network Slice creation with the Network Slice
requirements.
The Network Slice creation request includes the VAL Service ID, VAL UE\'s ID
List, S-NSSAI and so on.
3\. The NSCE server performs the Network Slice Allocation. The NSCE server as
network slice provisioning MnS consumer requests of \'AllocacatedNsi\'
operation as specified in TS 28.531.
When the \'AllocatedNsi\' operation is received, the network slice
provisioning MnS Producer performs charging mechanism as specified in TS
28.202.
The NSCE server performs AF-driven guidance for URSP determination to 5GS per
VAL UE.
NOTE 1: According to the network operator policy, the NSCE server acting as AF
may send the created network slice information to the PCF via NEF as part of
the AF-driven guidance for URSP determination to 5G system (as specified in
TS23.502 clause 4.15.6.10, TS 23.503 clause 6.6.2.2, TS 23.548 clause 6.2.4).
This guidance may create the new route selection parameters to indicate sets
of PDU Session information (DNN, S-NSSAI) that can be associated with
applications matching the application traffic.
4\. The NSCE server sends the result of Network Slice Allocation to the VAL
server.
5\. The NSCE server delivers the Network Slice Allocation Information to the
NSCE Clients of VAL UEs based on the VAL UE\'s ID list from step 2, in case
the Network Slice Allocation is successful, if the NSCE server does not
perform AF-driven guidance for URSP determination to 5GS in step 3.
The Network Slice Allocation Information contains the VAL service ID, S-NSSAI,
DNN and so on.
6\. The NSCE client stores and applies the Network Slice Allocation
Information.
7\. The NSCE client sends the Network Slice Allocation Information response to
the NSCE server.
NOTE 2: If the UE is provisioned with URSP rules by the network operator, the
UE handles the precedence between the delivered network slice info via NSCE
layer info and URSP rules as defined in 3GPP TS 23.503 [12] clause 6.1.2.2.1.
How the UE uses the Network Slice info delivered via NSCE layer in relation to
the URSP is implementation dependent.
### 6.13.2 Solution evaluation
The proposed solution addresses the KI #14.
This solution provides the procedure for NSCE layer to operate the Network
Slice allocation on behalf of the VAL server. This allows the NSCE layer to
interact with both the VAL server and 5GS MnS for allocating Network Slice and
makes use of the operation of 5GS MnS defined in SA5. The interaction between
NSCE server and NSCE client is required for informing the Network slice to be
used for the service provided from the VAL server.
The APIs of NSCE layer expect to be defined for the Network slice allocation
for the VAL server in the normative phase.
## 6.14 Solution 14: Interaction between the NSCE servers
### 6.14.1 Solution description
This solution aims at addressing the KI #12 and KI #1. It proposes procedures
of interaction between the NSCE servers.
### 6.14.2 Information collection from multiple NSCE servers
The owner of the centralized/national NSCE server including the MNO and
vertical could have requirement to collect the slice status from
edge/provincial NSCE server. The collected information could be used to
optimize network resource allocation after some analysis.
Pre-condition:
1\. NSCE server#2 has agreement with NSCE server#1 to provide the collected
slice information.
Figure 6.14.2: Information collection from multiple NSCE servers
1\. The NSCE server#1 sends out the information collection subscription
request with expected period and interested slice ID, e.g., List of SNSSAI.
This step could be done by pre-configuration.
2\. The NSCE server#2 shall check if the NSCE server#1 is authorized to get
the network slice information.
3\. After authenticated, the NSCE server#2 sends collected slice information
to NSCE server#1. The Network slice related performance and analytics exposure
could be re-utilized.
### **6.14.3 Solution evaluation**
This solution addresses the KI #12 and KI #1 by providing a interaction
procedure between the NSCE servers. In this solution, the NSCE server
interacts with another NSCE server to monitor/collect the network slice
information. The Network slice related performance and analytics exposure
could be re-utilized to do the network slice information
collection/monitoring.
The APIs over NSCE-E interface to be defined in normative phase:
1\. APIs of NSCE server registration on another NSCE server.
2\. APIs of service subscription of information collection across NSCE server.

### 6.15.2 Solution evaluation
The solution addresses key issue #1. The solution provides enhancements to the
existing NSCE client functionality by separating the network slice adaptation
subscription/notification functionality from the slice adaption triggering.
This enables an NSCE client to subscribe and receive network slice adaptation
notifications from a NSCE server independent of issuing a network slice
adaptation trigger request to the NSCE server. The solution also addresses the
open issue on enhancements needed to the information to be provided in the UE
triggered network slice adaptation procedure. These enhancements enable the
NSCE server to receive location requirements, schedule time window
requirements and access type within the network slice adaptation request sent
from the NSCE client to NSCE server. This enables the NSCE server to provide
this information within the AF-driven URSP guidance requests it sends to PCF.

## 6.18 Solution 18: Network Slice Information Delivery
### 6.18.1 Solution description
#### 6.18.1.1 General
This solution aims to address the issues identified in Key Issue 13.
The NSCE layer provides the feature of Network Slice information delivery. The
Network Slice information is necessary for the VAL server to manage the
network slice for their service such as preparation, creation, activation and
termination (tear-down) of network slice.
The Network Slice information that is delivered to the VAL server depends upon
network operator policy. The network slice capabilities and management options
offered to the customer are determined by a business agreement prior to and
outside of the scope of 3GPP standards.
In initial phase of Network slice Lifecycle, the network slice is defined by
Network Slice Provider (NSP). When the Network Slice is defined, the NSP with
5G system may create Network Slice Service Profile with the appropriate
values, which characterize the network slice. It refers to the Generic Network
Slice Template (GST) and Network Slice Type (NEST) which are standardized by
3GPP, GSMA and is called S-NEST. In addition, the NEST can be defined
specifically by NSP itself, which is called P-NEST. According to NSP\'s
policy, the Network Slice Information can be derived from the information in
Network Slice - ServiceProfile.
The VAL server needs to know which the characterized Network Slice service
types and capabilities it is authorized to use. The VAL server retrieves
authorized Network Slice information defined by NSP (e.g., S-NEST, P-NEST)
from the NSCE server.
The NSCE layer performs the below.
\- Retrieval of Network Slice ServiceProfile in 5GS (e.g., NSMF) as specified
in TS 28.532[8]
\- Conversion of Network Slice ServiceProfile (specified in TS 28.541) to
Network Slice Information
\- Creation of Network Slice Information
\- Storing of Network Slice Information
\- Delivery of Network Slice Information to VAL server that the Network Slice
Customer is authorized to use.
NOTE: The Network Slice Information provided to the VAL server depends on
service agreements
The VAL server as a Network Slice consumer makes use of the delivered Network
Slice information for the Network Slice Lifecycle management for its service.
#### 6.18.1.2 Network Slice Information delivery

provided. The NSCE server follows the procedure to request/receive the Network
Slice Service Profile with \'getMOIAttributes\' operation as specified in TS
28.532[8].
NOTE: If NSCE server and NSMF are in same operator, then the NSCE server gets
access directly to NSMF. The delivered Network Slice Service Profile contains
the values of attributes such as PLMN, S-NSSAI, SST, maximum number of UEs,
maximum number of PDU sessions, Coverage Area, Latency, Data volume, etc which
specify the Network Slice characteristics, as specified in clause of
ServiceProfile in TS 28.541.

### 6.18.2 Solution evaluation
The proposed solution addresses the KI #13 on Network Slice Information
delivery.
The solution provides the procedure for NSCE server to operate the Network
Slice information delivery to the VAL server. This allows the NSCE layer to
interact with both 5GS MnS and the VAL server for retrieval of Network Slice
ServiceProfile and for delivery of Network Slice information. This solution
makes use of the operation of 5GS MnS defined in SA5 for retrieval of Network
Slice Service Profile. The Network slice information can be delivered to the
VAL server with various ways according to the deployment
The solution is feasible and viable for NSaaS scenario when the VAL server
needs to be informed on the Network Slice information. The APIs of the NSCE
server capabilities expect to be defined for the Network Slice Information
delivery to the VAL server in the normative phase.
## 6.19 Solution 19: Slice requirements alignment capability
### 6.19.1 Solution description
#### 6.19.1.1 General
This solution aims to address the issue identified in Key Issue 11 of slice
requirement alignment.
This solution provides a procedure to illustrate slice requirements alignment
capability by the network slice capability enablement server in case that the
initial slice requirements are not configured properly or the slice
requirements need modifications to meet the adjusted service requirements.
To enable the VAL server to configure the optimal slice requirements
parameters to align with the real vertical needs, the NSCE layer is able to
monitor the network performance statistics and to evaluate whether the current
slice requirements parameters are reasonable to achieve the maximum return of
investment. To enable the slice/service self-management, the NSCE server may
have the capability to generate and configure more reasonable slice
requirements parameters. To avoid frequently reconfiguration of network slice
requirements, the action of alignment is triggered by the evaluation of
network performance statistics during a certain time period but not by a
single event.
#### 6.19.1.2 Slice requirements alignment capability
Figure 6.19.1.2-1 provides a possible procedure of slice parameters alignment
to address the key issue 11 described in clause 5.11.
> Pre-conditions:
>
> 1\. The VAL Server has subscribed to the slice requirements alignment
> capability
>
> 2\. The NSCE Server has subscribed to the service of network slice
> performance management provided by EGMF.
>
> 3\. The NSCE server has subscribed to the service of network slice
> provisioning provided by EGMF.
Figure 6.19.1.2-1: Slice requirements alignment process
1\. The VAL server sends a slice requirements alignment request to NSCE server
to require the NSCE server to check whether the slice requirements (by
configuring the attributes of _serviceProfile_) matches the real network slice
usage status, the request may include the S-NSSAI, the ID of the VAL server,
the slice requirements parameters (attributes of _serviceProfile_) which is
requested to be aligned.
2\. The NSCE server checks if the VAL server is authorized to trigger the
service of slice requirements alignment.
3\. The NSCE server response to VAL server with the result of slice
requirements alignment request, e.g., the slice requirements alignment request
is accepted.
4\. On receiving the request from VAL server, NSCE server retrieves the
network slice related performance data and KPIs (e.g., the average PRB usage,
the distribution of the PRB usage) defined in TS 28.552[12] by utilize
performance assurance management services exposed by EGMF.
5\. NSCE server compares the slice requirement parameters of network slice
(the values of attributes of _serviceProfile,_ e.g., radioSpectrum, the
maxNumberofUEs) with network slice performance statistics (e.g., active number
of users, the average PRB usage, the distribution of the PRB usage of the
S-NSSAI) to generate the optimal slice requirements for the required service
(represented by S-NSSAI) of the vertical and determine whether the network
slice modification operations should be taken. This step depends on
implementation (e.g., if the VAL client experience are satisfied while the
network slice resources are with low utilization, the resources required in
the slice requirements could be reduced).
6\. If NSCE decides to update the slice requirements, the NSCE server performs
the network slice modification operation, as defined in clause 7.6, TS
28.531[5] exposed by EGMF defined in SA5, the _serviceProfile_ will be re-
configured by utilizing the modifyMOIAttributes operation.
7\. NSCE server sends the notifications to VAL server to notify the change of
the slice requirements parameters.
### 6.19.2 Solution evaluation
This solution addresses the key issue #11 of slice requirement alignment. In
this solution, the NSCE server interacts with VAL Server and OAM system
respectively to compare the slice requirements with network current situations
to estimate if the current slice requirements are properly configured. The
network situation can be monitored by utilize the performance assurance
related management services exposed by EGMF. The alignment of slice
requirements is a semi-static operation which is not triggered by a single
event but considers the network performance statistics during a certain time
period. Besides, this solution has no impact on the actual business
arrangement between the third-party and the MNO, which only performs
adjustments within the bounds of the actual SLA.
## 6.20 Solution 20: Network slice optimization based on AF policy
### 6.20.1 Solution description
#### 6.20.1.1 General
This solution aims at providing potential procedures for KI#10. It provides a
mechanism to optimize the network slice parameters for the vertical
applications (by triggering the slice modification), based on network slice
usage patterns and policy of application, e.g., to trigger some slices
operation when the pre-configured thresholds are met.
The AF policy can be in form of a policy profile which contains the listed
trigger event and expected action.
For example, the trigger events can be:
\- Slice load exceeding the threshold (a numeric value or a percentage of the
maximum number),
\- A specific time period (e.g., summer vacation or spring festival).
The event list above is not exhaustive list, and just something for
information.
When one or more event(s) are triggered, then network slice optimization
operations are expected to be triggered.
The expected network slice optimization operations could be:
\- Network slice modification for network slice(s),
\- Or just sending out the notification.
Then some examples of policy are:
\- In June, trigger the slice modification to decrease the slice with 10%,
with updated network slice related requirement (e.g. maximum number of UEs,
latency, and throughput).
\- When the max number of PDU sessions is reached, trigger the slice
modification to expand with 20% this parameter for slice capacity.
\- When the uplink throughput threshold is reached, trigger the slice
modification to expand with 20% this parameter.
According to the trigger event, slice optimization can be triggered by OAM as
describe in 6.20.1.2, triggered by NWDAF as describe in 6.20.1.3, or triggered
by NSCE server itself as describe in 6.20.1.4.
#### 6.20.1.2 OAM event triggered network slice optimization
Figure 6.20.1.2 illustrates **the procedure of** OAM event triggered Network
slice optimization.
In this clause, the AF policy is triggered by the network slice management
data reported from OAM. The measured object is defined in item f) of
measurement definitions (3GPP TS 32.404 [23], TS 28.552 [12]) and in item d)
of KPI definitions (TS 28.554 [24]).
The policy in this clause is when the network slice is vertical owned private
slice, the vertical request to only activate part of the network slice at the
beginning considering the energy saving. Based on the monitored connected UE
or established PDU session or Downstream Throughput, more resource could be
activated by triggering the modification of
uLThptPerSlice/dLThptPerSlice/maximum number of UEs/maximum number of PDU
session.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NSCE server is authorized to get network slice management data
notification from OAM;
2\. The VAL server is authorized to the NSCE server for network slice
optimization.
3\. There is enough network capacity when the expected action is to expand the
network slice.
4\. The AF policy has been pre-configured on the VAL server based on the
agreement with NSCE server which is not conflicts with the SLA.
5\. The AF policy has been provided to the NSCE server as specified in clause
6.20.1.5.
Figure 6.20.1.2: Network slice optimization **triggered by OAM**
1\. VAL server sends network slice optimization service subscription request
to NSCE server. The request contains the policy ID indicating the OAM based
trigger event. The policy in this clause is: When the max number of PDU
sessions is reached, trigger the slice modification to expand slice capacity

### 6.20.2 Solution evaluation
The solution addresses the key issue #10. In this solution, the NSCE server
optimizes the network slice for the vertical applications based on AF policy.
After receiving the policy from AF, the NSCE Server may have interactions with
5GC and OAM system to monitor the network slice, and then trigger the network
slice modification by utilize the network slice related management services
exposed by EGMF defined in SA5. This solution is based on the capacity
supported by SA2 and SA5 and does not introduce impact on 5GS architecture.
While the SA6 SEAL will possibly need enhancement to support the interaction
with 5GS and OAM system. The APIs interface needs to be defined in normative
phase:
1\. APIs of policy/service subscription of network slice modification.
2\. APIs to provide the AF policy to NSCE server.
## 6.21 Solution 21: Solution on predictive slice modification in edge based
NSCE deployments
### 6.21.1 Solution description
#### 6.21.1.1 General
The solution addresses the key issue #12 and in particular the open issues:
\- How could the NSCE server deployed inside the EDN interact with the NSCE
server outside the EDN? Whether and how could the NSCE server interact with
other NSCE server?
\- Whether and how does SEAL need to be enhanced to support NSCE client to
interact with NSCE server in the EDN and NSCE server outside the EDN?
This scenario targets mainly deployments where the slice enabler is deployed
at the edge and the migration to different DN will require that the ongoing
slice is supported at the target area to ensure meeting the application
session requirements. The slice parameters monitoring at the target area (e.g.
for per NSI/NSSI resource situation) need to be known at the server NSCE
server to allow for pro-active slice (or slice subnet) modification trigger to
avoid degradation of the application service performance.
In this procedure, the NSCE server initially receives an expected/predicted UE
location/mobility change request outside an EDN service area for one or more
UEs within the VAL application session (e.g. such session can be an indirect
V2V session or a multiplayer gaming session). Then, service or target NSCE
server checks with 5GS (OAM, 5GC) whether the serving slice is available and
can offer the same performance at the target EDN. Thereafter, NSCE server
evaluates the need for a slice modification (e.g. a slice lifecycle related
trigger change) e.g. a slice subnet resource adaptation to allow for
optimizing the application performance at the target area. Based on this
decision/recommendation, it provides the action to the OAM and supports the
re-mapping of NSCE server for the NSCE client proactively, before UE mobility
happens.
#### 6.21.1.1 Procedure
Figure 6.21.1.2-1 illustrates the solution to Key Issue #12 on network slice
capability exposure in the edge data network to allow for slice modification
when a vertical application migrates to a different EDN supported by different
NSCE server**.**
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL server has subscribed to the network slice capability enablement
server
2\. Initially, VAL client of VAL UE is mapped to Slice#1, and NSCE client of
VAL UE has established a connection to NSCE server#1 (S-NSCE server).
3\. The S-NSCE server has already discovered the T-NSCE server and its area of
coverage.
Figure 6.21.1.2-1: Support for predictive slice modification in distributed
NSCE server deployments
1a/1b. The VAL server sends to S-NSCE server a VAL application service
continuity requirement due to predicted/expected UE or group UE mobility to an
area covered by a different EDN. Such UE predicted mobility can be based on
analytics received by NWDAF or ADAES or can be predicted by the VAL layer (VAL
server or VAL UE).
2\. S-NSCE server acting as AF, may interact with 5GC to query the UE specific
information (location, UE connection capabilities) as well as network
conditions (network monitoring from NEF) and/or slice related analytics on the
slice load (from NWDAF as specified in TS 23.288).
3\. S-NSCE server may also interact with OAM to query on the up to data
configured slice parameters e.g. slice RRM policies, modification of the
NSI/NSSI resources (see TS 28.531[5], 5.1.12) at the target area and
measurements for the slice at the target area.
4\. S-NSCE server checks whether new NSCE service area supports slice #1 and
if slice #1 offers similar performance in target area. Here we assume that the
S-NSCE is aware of the per application QoS requirements / KPIs (or has
acquired this information from the VAL server).
If the current slice doesn\'t fulfil these requirements, S-NSCE interacts with
T-NSCE server (by sending the VAL application service continuity requirement
and optionally a proposed action) to negotiate and jointly determine the need
for a slice lifecycle change at the target area and translates this to a
trigger action towards OAM (slice provisioning MnS producer). This trigger
action can be the outcome of the negotiation and can be a requested slice
modification or the slice #1 creation/instantiation at the target area (this
may happen if a group of UEs are moving to the target area and use slice #1,
so it may be beneficial to create slice #1 at the target area). Such trigger
action can be generated by either the S-NSCE server or the T-NSCE server based
on the deployment.
5a/b.Then, S- or T-NSCE server may send the trigger action to the slice
provisioning MnS at OAM (e.g. slice modification for network slice) based on
the expected/predicted VAL UE or VAL group mobility. Following the MnS
provides a response with a positive or negative result.
6\. After the slice lifecycle change execution (based on the indication in
5b), if the NSCE client needs to be remapped to different NSCE server (due to
the expected change of UE location), the NSCE client establishes a new
connection with T-NSCE and terminates the one with S-NSCE (in case of
subscription-based interaction), or in case of request-based interaction, it
updates the mapping at the client side, and maintains the new NSCE server
address / ID and may also request for report configuration information for the
target NSCE area.
### 6.21.2 Solution evaluation
The solution addresses the key issue #12 on network slice capability exposure
in the edge data network, and in particular the interaction between NSCE
servers (deployed at different EDNs) when an expected migration happens for a
UE or group of UEs from an EDN to another. Solution #X requires interaction
with 5GC (acting as trusted AF) for querying network/slice condition at the
target area and the interaction with OAM / slice provisioning MnS producer for
consuming OAM services.
The solution is feasible and viable mainly for the NSaaS scenario (where the
NSCE server is the NSP and the VAL server is the NSC) and proposes the
enhancement NSCE server capabilities to deal with scenarios when NSCE servers
are deployed at the edge / distributed and a trigger can be related to
UE/group predicted mobility from one edge area to another.
## 6.22 Solution #22: Slice policy and configuration alignment
### 6.22.1 Solution description
#### 6.22.1.1 General
This solution addresses the KI 11 bullet on resolving misalignments between
VAL server policy (e.g., requirements provided when adding or changing slice)
and the NSCE service provider policy (NSPP).
The VAL server policy can be in the form of a profile or configuration which
the VAL server requests to be applied or maintained by NSCE, e.g., a profile
including the configuration of several services using the same network slice.
Alternatively, the VAL server policy can be provided together with the request
for an action, e.g., adding a network slice. When the action requested also
includes a VAL server policy to be applied, it needs to be aligned with the
existing network slice policies available at NSCE i.e., NSPPs.
#### 6.22.1.2 Procedure
Figure 6.22.1.2 illustrates **the procedure for slice lice policy and
configuration alignment**
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NSCE service provider policy (NSPP) is available at the NSCE Server.
NOTE 1: It is assumed that NSPP includes ranges of NS capabilities which can
be adapted via NSCE, along with conditions under which such adaptations are
allowed. This policy is used by NSCE also in other TR solutions to determine
whether parameters in NS management operations are within allowed ranges,
e.g., clause 6.10.2.1 step 10, fig 6.11.1.2-1 steps 2 and/or 3, fig 6.11.1.2-2
steps 2 and/or 3, clause 6.13.1.2 step 3, clause 6.13.1.2 step 3, clause
6.17.1.2 step 5., clause 6.19.1.2 step 5., etc.
2\. The VAL server is authorized to receive NSCE services.
Figure 6.22.1.2: Policy alignment
1\. VAL server sends a provisioning or action request to NSCE server. The
request contains the VAL policy.
NOTE 2: The request in this step is described generically and can correspond
to one or more requests to be defined in the normative phase to support other
solutions. For example, the request corresponds to clause 6.1.1.2 step 1,
clause 6.9.1.2 step 1, clause 6.10.1.2 step 8, clause 6.11.1.1 step 1, clause
6.11.1.2 step 1, clause 6.13.1.2 step 2, clause 6.17.1.2 step 1 etc. The
response in step 3 is to be defined in a complementary manner.
2\. The NSCE server checks whether the provided VAL policy conflicts with the
NSCE service provider policy. **If not, the action requested, if any, is
performed.**
If the VAL policy conflicts with the NSCE service provider policy, the NSCE
server can determine parameters harmonizing the two configurations. The NSCE
server determines parameters harmonizing the configurations if previously
authorized.
NOTE 3: In the normative phase, this step can be implemented, for example, as
part of the following: clause 6.1.1.2 steps 2, 6 or 9, clause 6.10.2.1 step
10, fig 6.11.1.2-1 steps 2 and/or 3, fig 6.11.1.2-2 steps 2 and/or 3, clause
6.13.1.2 step 3, clause 6.13.1.2 step 3, clause 6.17.1.2 step 5., clause
6.19.1.2 step 5., etc.
> 3\. NSCE server sends the VAL server a response indicating whether the VAL
> policy conforms with NSPP. If the policies conflicted, the NSCE server
> provides optional parameters values that allow the policies to be
> harmonized. If the policies did not conflict, the response indicates that
> there is alignment. If an action was also requested in step 1, the result of
> the action can be provided in the response.
>
> 4\. The NSCE Server can provide a notification to 5GS with the result of the
> compare and harmonize procedure.
>
> NOTE 4: In the normative phase the specification of this step is to be
> aligned with SA5 specifications
### 6.22.2 Solution evaluation
The solution addresses key issue #11 on slice requirement alignment by
addressing misalignments between VAL server policy (e.g., requirements
provided when adding or changing slices) and the NSCE service provider policy.
The solution provides clarity to the how requirements and parameters from the
two different domains may be harmonized/ aligned, in order to allow other NSCE
functions to be performed.
In the normative phase, this solution can be used to provide clarifications
and enhancements to a number of procedures. Alternatively, this solution can
be implemented as a stand-alone process similar to the one described in clause
6.19., with the slice requirement updates resulting mainly from interactions
between VAL Server and NSCE Server (not from interactions between NSCE and
EGMF, as captured in the clause 6.19. solution),
The solution in this clause can be used to enhance request/response messaging
and procedural steps specified within the scope of other solutions. Therefore,
the solution is feasible and can be used to complement other key issues.

### 8.2.2 Overall Evaluation for KI#1
This clause provides an overall evaluation of the key issue #1 Network slice
capability management enhancements.
The Solution #12 analyzes potential new services that could enhance the SEAL
and the potential enhancement to SEAL NSCE architecture.
The solution #15 provides enhancements to the existing NSCE client
functionality by separating the network slice adaptation
subscription/notification functionality from the slice adaption triggering.
The solution #16 and solution #17 provides enhancements to the NSCE
functionality by supporting the NSCE services including the network slice
monitoring and network slice optimization in multi-Networks. Detailed
signalling and APIs of making multiple networks resource adjustment and slice
monitoring are to be addressed in normative phase.
Solution #15, solution #16 and solution #17 could be considered in the
normative work.
### 8.2.3 Overall Evaluation for KI#10
This clause provides an overall evaluation of the key issue #10 supporting for
managing trusted third-party owned application(s).
Solution #9 provides a possible procedure of the VAL server requesting to
manage network slice quota by providing specific type of action to take (e.g.
release low priority users as identified by 5GC, release list of users as
identified by the VAL server, etc) and optionally list of UEs on which
specific action to apply to NSCE Server. While SA2 has no mechanisms for AF
managing UEs with different qualities/priority level within a slice.
The Solution #10 illustrates the process of the VAL server requesting to
manage network slice when reaching UEs slice quota threshold. The slice
adjustment is mainly to modify the network slice and the decision is made
based on network status information from 5GS.
Solution #20 illustrates the process of optimizing the network slice (modify
the network slice ) based on policy of application, which could be triggered
by not only predicted network slice status, but also network slice management
data.
The solution #10 and solution#20 could be considered to be merged during the
normative work, and the detailed APIs are to be addressed in normative phase.
### 8.2.4 Overall Evaluation for KI#12
This clause provides an overall evaluation of the key issue #12 Network slice
capability exposure in the edge data network. The solution #14 and solution
#21 are complementary to each other.
The solution #14 is applicable when the monitoring of network slice supported
by different edge deployed NSCE servers is needed to form an overview of the
whole network.
The solution #21 is to optimize the application performance when the one or
more UEs is predicted to migrate between different NSCE server.
Both solutions need the support of interaction between the NSCE servers, and
the detailed API could be considered in the normative work.

###### ### Annex A Deployment models
## A.1 Deployment scenarios
### A.1.1 General
In addition to SA2 and SA5 network slicing capabilities, the NSCE service
provides application layer enablement to support the network slice management
and control in the granularity of slice which is identified by S-NSSAI.
A network slice can have only one owner and one NSCE service provider. NSCE
service provider and slice owner can be different. For example the slice owner
is VAL server, but the NSCE service provider is MNO.
This clause describes examples of deployment models with respect to different
deployment scenarios as follows.
### A.1.2 Centralized NSCE deployment
Figure A.1.2 shows a fundamental deployment of NSCE server whose service area
covering the whole PLMN. It is also possible slice coverage area to be smaller
than the NSCE service area. One NSCE server can also be responsible for local
slices covering only small service areas.
The network slice capability enablement service is provided with the view of
whole PLMN in this scenario.
Figure A.1.2: Illustration of centralized NSCE deployment
### A.1.3 Distributed NSCE deployment
The distributed deployment refers to the deployment model in which the service
area only covers some specific areas as shown below (based on geographical
coordinates or TA list(s)).
Figure A.1.3: Illustration of distributed NSCE deployment
Examples of distributed deployment including NPN NSCE deployment and edge NSCE
deployment which are shown below in A.1.3.1 and A.1.3.2.
When there are multiple NSCE servers managed by same provider, NSCE server(s)
may be subscribed for providing the network slice statistics to another NSCE
server to provide a global view.
There can be two use cases to provide the NSCE service in the distributed
deployment:
One use case is that the edge/NPN deployed NSCE is about a slice service area
which is equivalent to the edge/NPN area. For this scenario, if the edge/NPN
deployed NSCE wants to access the NEF/NWDAF/NSACF services or to receive
policies from OAM, it needs to interact to the global NSCE.
A further use case could be that some NSCE services (e.g. MnS discovery) are
locally provided to edge -native VAL servers (for example as a micro-service),
whereas other capabilities are provided for the whole PLMN area. So, the
edge/NPN NSCE includes a subset of capabilities which are edge native. The
local deployment of such capabilities can allow for more efficient services to
the edge deployed VAL servers (e.g. for QoS verification, the edge deployed
NSCE can receive more timely KQI/QoE measurements and can process them locally
before triggering an event).
### A.1.3.1 NPN NSCE deployment
Figure X.1.3.1 shows the NPN NSCE server deployment. This case is valid if a
geographical match between slice coverage area, NPN coverage area and NSCE
service area is pre-configured. The matching may be pre-configured by network
operator based on the TA list. The service area of the NSCE server equals to
the area of the NPN in this case. The slice(s) coverage area may equals to the
area of the NPN, but it is also possible slice coverage area to be smaller
than the NPN service area.
The NSCE server is deployed in Non-public network to provide the network slice
capabilities exposure application service based on the interaction with
NPN-5GC and NPN-OAM.
Figure A.1.3.1: Illustration of NPN NSCE deployment
### A.1.3.2 Edge NSCE deployment
Figure X.1.3.2 shows the edge NSCE deployment cases when the NSCE server is
deployed in the EDN using LADNs as described in Annex A.2.4 of TS 23.558[x].
This case is valid if a geographical match between slice coverage area, LADN
service area (which is EDN service area) and NSCE service area is pre-
configured. The matching can based on the TA list or geographical coordinates.
The service area of the NSCE server equals to the area of the LADN in this
case. The slice(s) coverage area may equals to the area of the LADN(EDN), but
it is also possible slice coverage area to be smaller than the LADN(EDN)
service area.
The NSCE server is deployed in EDN to provide the network slice capabilities
exposure application service based on the interaction with EDN-5GC and EDN-
OAM.
Figure A.1.3.2: Illustration of edge NSCE deployment
## A.2 Deployment of NSCE server(s) in relation to VAL server and 3GPP system
To support the centralized/distributed, the NSCE server(s) will have different
deployment models and different relation with VAL server and 3GPP system. This
clause describes examples of deployment models of NSCE server(s) in relation
to VAL server and 3GPP system.
Figure X.2-1 illustrates the centralized NSCE deployment. The NSCE server can
be deployed in PLMN domain by MNO, or deployed in VAL service provider domain
by vertical.
Figure A.2-1: Illustration of centralized NSCE deployment
Figure A.2-2 illustrates the distributed NSCE deployment. The NSCE servers can
be deployed in PLMN domain by MNO, deployed in VAL service provider domain by
vertical, or deployed in 3^rd^ party domain by3^rd^ party. The VAL server can
communicate with multiple NSCE servers via NSCE-S as long as other NSCE
servers are discovered and accessible. Or, the VAL server can communicate with
other NSCE servers via NSCE-E if needed.

###### ### Annex B (informative): Business models and relationships for NSCALE
## Annex B.1: Relevance to SA5 models
According to TS 28.530, the roles related to 5G networks and network slicing
management include among others:
\- Communication Service Provider (CSP): Provides communication services.
Designs, builds and operates its communication services. The CSP provided
communication service can be built with or without network slice.
\- Communication Service Customer (CSC): Uses communication services.
\- Network Operator (NOP): Designs, builds and operates networks and provides
related services, including network services and network slices.
Also, according to TS 28.530: \"In case of Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS)
(cf. clause 4.1.6), the Communication Service Provider (CSP) role can be
refined into NSaaS Provider (NSaaSP) role -- or, in short, Network Slice
Provider (NSP) - and the Communication Service Customer (CSC) role can be
refined into NSaaS Customer (NSaaSC) role -- or, in short, Network Slice
Customer (NSC). A NSC can, in turn, offer its own communication services to
its own customers, being thus CSP at the same time. A tenant might take the
role of a NSC.\"
Figure 4.1.6.1 of TS 28.530 illustrates some examples on how network slices
can be utilized to deliver communication services, including network slice as
a Service. For simplicity this figure omits the details of how NFs are being
managed and does not show their groupings into network slice subnet:
a) A Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS) is provided to CSC-A by CSP-A. Unlike
the communication service delivered to end customers, in NSaaS, the offered
service is the actual network slice.
b) CSC-A can use the network slice obtained from CSP-A to support own
Communication Services or may add additional network functions to the obtained
NSaaS and offer the resulting combination as a new network slice to CSP-B. In
this case, CSC-A plays the role of NOP-B and builds his own network. The
network slice obtained by CSC-A from CSP-A becomes a \"building block\" or a
network slice subnet of CSC-A in its role of NOP-B. The NOP-B (a.k.a. CSC-A)
combines this network slice subnet with other network slice subnets and offers
the new network slice subnet as network slice to CSP-B.
c) CSP-B can use the network slice obtained from CSC-A / NOP-B to deliver
communication services to its end customers (as CSC-B).
Figure 4.1.6.1: Examples of Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS) being utilized
to deliver communication services to end customers [TS 28.530]
**[Observation B.1-1]** For the NSaaS model, NSCE can be defined as an NSC of
the NSP, which in turn offers its own communication services to its own
customers, being thus CSP at the same time.
**[Observation B.1-2]** A Network Slice in NSaaS model can be combined with
additional functions, and a new slice can be provided by the CSC-A which acts
as NOP-B. In such model, the NSCE server can provide enablement services for
the new slice provided by the NOP-A customer.
**[Observation B.1-3]** It is not necessary that the NOP-B \"slice
parameters\" are the same as the NOP-A \"slice parameters\"; hence the slice
areas for the resulting slice can be different from the slice area provided by
NOP-B/CSC-A.
TS 28.530 also specifies the \"network slices as NOP internals\" model. In
this model, the network slices are not part of the NOP service offering and
hence are not visible to its customers. However, the NOP, to provide support
to communication services, may decide to deploy network slices, e.g. for
internal network optimization purposes. This model allows CSC to use the
network as the end user or optionally allows CSC to monitor the service status
(assurance of the SLA associated with the internally offered network slice).
The CSP should be able to provide the service status information (e.g. service
performance, fault information, traffic data, etc) to CSC via the management
exposure interface.
Figure 4.1.7.1: Examples of network slice as NOP internals [TS 28.530]
**[Observation B.1-4]** For the network slices as NOP internals model, the
NSCE server can be only defined as part of NOP to translate the slice specific
requirements to communication service requirements and vice versa.
## Annex B.2: Business relationships
NSCE layer provides value added services to VAL customers, based on consuming
5GS services related to slicing (from OAM, 5GC) and based on interacting with
the VAL UE side. The variety of services and the deployment aspects depend on
the different assumptions for the slice owner / provider, the slice customer
and the enablement service provider. With respect to NSCALE, the NSCE server
can play different roles based on the business models. For example, NSCE
server can be:
\- deployed by NOP / MNO
\- deployed by an Edge / Cloud Provider, as a trusted 3^rd^ party
\- deployed by a vertical industry, which can be the end slice customer
From business perspective, if the NSCE server is not part of vertical or MNO,
the following business model apply. In Figure X.2-1, the different
interactions among all the involved entities are provided. More specifically,
in this model the end user is the consumer of the applications provided by the
vertical/ASP and can have app-level service agreement with vertical/ASP(s).
The end user/UE also has a PLMN subscription arrangement with the MNO. The UE
used by the end user is allowed to be registered on the MNO\'s network. MNO
(via OAM) can have a slice SLA with the vertical / ASP, which is optional when
vertical customer is the NSC. In addition, due to the involvement of a NSCE
service provider, additional agreements can be possible between the NSCE
server and VAL/ASP layer and the NOP/MNO(s):
\- the enablement service agreement between VAL/ASP layer and the NSCE service
provider include the agreement on the value-added services, which in case on
NSaaS these are services related to the consumed slice from NOP. So, the end
customer (VAL) subscribes to NSCE server for receiving additional services for
optimizing the slice utilization. In case that the NSCE server is a NSP
towards VAL customer, then such agreement can relate to slice SLA (for the
slice provided by the NSCE server).
\- the service agreement between MNO and NSCE service provider is for
consuming 5GS services (and being also authorized and trusted to provide
additional services on top). Such agreement could be also a slice SLA for the
scenarios when NSCE server is the NSC of the MNO (in NSaaS model).
