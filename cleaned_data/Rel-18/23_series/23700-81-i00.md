# 5 Key Issues
## 5.1 Key Issue #1: How to improve correctness of NWDAF analytics
### 5.1.1 Description
Correctness of predictions is usually associated to accuracy, which represents
the most prominent KPI to rate ML models. However, the accuracy can be
corrupted by a wrong calculation and/or unfair feedback collection. It is thus
of utmost importance to ensure that the accuracy is meaningful, consistent,
and comparable.
Incorrect predictions can be due to the fact that the accuracy of an ML model
during inference may be lower than the accuracy of the same ML model during
training. This is likely to happen if the training data set differs
significantly in terms of distribution and features from the input data that
the ML model is fed with during inference. Knowing how the ML model is meant
to be used would help to train the ML model efficiently and effectively.
The following aspects need to be studied:
\- How to detect that improving the correctness of an Analytics ID is needed?
\- How and what information is required to compute and represent the
correctness of NWDAF analytics in a reliable way?
NOTE: Whether the information is used to represent correctness of NWDAF
analytics may depend on the use case.
\- Whether and what action(s) should be taken when the NWDAF Analytics are
considered incorrect, whether and how a NF can continue consuming an Analytics
ID for which the need for improvement has been detected?
\- Whether and which action(s) should be taken by consumer NF to help improve
correctness of NWDAF Analytics.
\- Whether and how the NWDAF can improve correctness of NWDAF Analytics (e.g.
which existing and/or additional information may be used by the NWDAF to
improve the correctness of NWDAF Analytics)?
\- Whether there is a need for architectural and/or functional enhancements
for improving correctness of NWDAF Analytics, if there is additional
signalling load caused by any new functional enhancement and how to mitigate
the signalling?
\- How and which information is needed to enhance the ML model provisioning to
improve the correctness of NWDAF Analytics.
\- Study mechanisms to detect that degradation on an ML model has happened and
whether and which actions should be triggered.
## 5.2 Key Issue #2: NWDAF-assisted application detection
### 5.2.1 Description
This key issue proposes to study whether and how the NWDAF can assist the
detection of the traffic generated by an application. This KI corresponds to
WT#2.1: NWDAF assisted application detection.
The detection of traffic generated by an application can be performed using
the application detection filters in the UPF/SMF and those application
detection filters may include Packet Flow Description(s), i.e. PFD(s).
Depending on service level agreements between the operator and the Application
Service Provider (ASP), the ASP may provide PFD(s) for each application
identifier maintained by the ASP.
It will be studied whether and how the NWDAF can assist to identify the
traffic specific to a certain application at the UPF.
The following issues shall be studied:
\- How to consider the consent of user and ASP (i.e. no privacy and regulatory
issue) for performing and exposing the analytics for application detection?
\- Whether and how the NWDAF can assist the application detection, considering
the following aspects:
\- Study use cases where the NWDAF can assist the application detection, for
instance how to detect the application traffic if the ASP provides initial PFD
information but does not update it in time or does not update it anymore, or
if the ASP does not provide any PFD information.
\- If NWDAF provides analytics to assist the application detection performed
at the UPF. What is the potential consumer of these analytics (e.g. NEF/PFDF)
and how does that consumer use these analytics?
\- Whether new input data needs to be collected by NWDAF to assist the
application detection performed at the UPF?
\- Whether existing or new Analytics ID(s) are needed to be provided by NWDAF
to assist the application detection performed at the UPF?
Solutions for this key issue shall not cause degradation of UPF performance.
NOTE: Coordination with FS_ UPEAS / Study on UPF enhancement for Exposure and
SBA may be needed.
## 5.3 Key Issue #3: Data and analytics exchange in roaming case
### 5.3.1 Description
In roaming scenario, the HPLMN/VPLMN may need to collect data or consume
analytics from the VPLMN/HPLMN. The data or analytics may relate to particular
UEs or contain information about all UEs or groups of UEs. Both PLMNs (VPLMN,
HPLMN) need the ability to control the amount of data exposed and to abstract
or hide network-internal aspects based on user consent, operator policy,
regulatory constraints and/or roaming agreements. Use cases for data exchange
and analytics exposure between HPLMN and VPLMN require further investigation.
The technical aspects to be studied include the following:
\- Identification of use cases and requirements for data and/or analytics
exchange between PLMNs (i.e. HPLMN and VPLMN(s)) in roaming scenario. For each
use case, identify what raw data, existing or new Analytics IDs needs to be
exchanged, and which existing Analytics ID can be enhanced or new Analytics ID
can be generated for the roaming user based on the exchanged data
\- Determination of possible architecture enhancements to support this
exchange in roaming scenarios and of any necessary enhancements to related NFs
in HPLMN and VPLMN, e.g. possible enhancement on data collection using DCCF,
or possible enhancement on data storage using ADRF, or possible enhancement on
security and privacy of the data and analytics exchange between PLMNs.
NOTE 1: Where possible, existing capabilities of the 5GC for inter-PLMN
communication should be reused, for instance NRF capabilities to authorize
access to services, and capabilities of Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP)
defined in TS 33.501 [12] to manipulate data and to secure the
confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data exchange over the N32
interface between PLMNs.
NOTE 2: Coordination with SA3 on security aspects is required.
NOTE 3: Coordination with GSMA on sharing of user data while roaming may be
required.
## 5.4 Key Issue #4: How to Enhance Data collection and Storage
### 5.4.1 Description
For this Key Issue the following aspects will be studied:
\- Interaction between multiple DCCFs and MFAFs (e.g. DCCF or MFAF relocation)
if multiple DCCFs are deployed in one PLMN, to facilitate and improve data
collection coordination.
\- Whether and how to enhance ADRF selection in case of multiple ADRF deployed
in the network and whether and how to support ADRF relocation.
\- Whether and how the ADRF should store types of data other than historical
data and analytics (e.g. ML models, analytics context) for network analytics.
\- Whether and what other enhancements are required for storage of data and/or
analytics in ADRF, NWDAF and/or data source NF.
\- Whether and what other enhancements can be made to further reduce
signalling and data traffic and the impact of obtaining data on data sources
related to network analytics.
## 5.5 Key Issue #5: Enhance trained ML Model sharing
### 5.5.1 Description
As described in the below note from clause 5.1, TS 23.288 [5] that in Rel-17
the ID(s) of the NWDAF containing MTLF(s) is locally configured in the NWDAF
containing AnLF, and the NWDAF containing AnLF is only allowed to retrieve
trained ML model(s) from the configured NWDAF containing MTLF(s).
_NOTE 3: In this Release of the specification an NWDAF containing AnLF is
locally configured with (a set of) IDs of NWDAFs containing MTLF and the
Analytics ID(s) supported by each NWDAF containing MTLF to retrieve trained ML
models. An NWDAF containing AnLF uses NWDAF discovery for NWDAF containing
MTLF within the set of configured IDs of NWDAFs containing MTLF, if necessary.
ML Model provisioning/sharing between multiple MTLFs is not supported in this
Release of the specification._
In Rel-18, the following aspects are to be studied to enhance trained ML Model
sharing between NWDAFs from different vendors:
\- How to discover and select a NWDAF containing MTLF even from different
vendors which can provide interoperable trained ML model(s), and how to
retrieve interoperable trained ML model(s) from it, by a NWDAF containing
AnLF, including:
\- Whether and what new functionality / function(s) is needed for support of
trained ML model interoperability?
\- What additional information should be exchanged between the NWDAF
containing MTLF and the NWDAF containing AnLF, for support of trained ML model
interoperability.
\- Whether and how to define common characteristics for trained ML models from
different vendors?
NOTE 1: Coordination with SA5 is needed for ML model sharing aspects.
NOTE 2: Coordination with SA3 is needed for security aspects related to ML
model sharing (e.g. ML model integrity, authorization of use, etc.) as
investigated by this Key Issue.
## 5.6 Key issue #6: **NWDAF-assisted URSP**
### 5.6.1 Description
NWDAF can already provide some network analytics to PCF for policy decisions
as described in clause 6.1.1.3 in TS 23.503 [4]. However, further
investigation is required on whether and how analytics can be used to assist
in the generation of URSP Rules.
In this key issue, the following aspects need to be studied:
\- Whether any and which components of the URSP rules can benefit from
analytics.
\- Whether and how existing Analytics IDs, or new Analytics ID(s) can be used
to assist in the generation of URSP Rules.
\- What procedures trigger the subscription to these Analytics IDs.
\- Whether new (set of) interactions(s) are required to assist in the
generation of URSP Rules as defined in Rel17, and how to define the new
interactions if needed.
\- What information should be collected (or provided) as input (or output) by
the NWDAF for these Analytics IDs.
## 5.7 Key Issue #7: Enhancements on QoS Sustainability analytics
### 5.7.1 Description
Currently, NWDAF can provide Cell level QoS Sustainability analytics with
limited QoS parameters, i.e. RAN UE Throughput and QoS Flow retainability.
More KPIs reporting for QoS Sustainability analytics would benefit, e.g. for
V2X use cases as defined by 5GAA.
Therefore, the following aspects are needed to be studied for QoS
Sustainability analytics enhancement:
\- Whether and how to enhance the QoS Sustainability analytics with a finer
granularity area (e.g. below Cell level)? Or alternatively if a new Analytics
ID is required for the finer granularity area for this purpose?
\- Whether and how to enhance the QoS Sustainability analytics (or a new
Analytics ID) with additional input and/or output data?
\- Whether and how to enhance the request for QoS Sustainability analytics (or
a new Analytics ID)?
NOTE: Coordinated activities with 5GAA are needed.
## 5.8 Key Issue #8: Supporting Federated Learning in 5GC
### 5.8.1 Description
This contribution is related to WT # 4.1.
Current enablers for network automation architecture by NWDAF still faces some
major challenges as follows:
\- User data privacy and security (protected by e.g. GDPR) has become a
worldwide issue, it is also difficult for NWDAF to collect UE level network
data.
\- With the introduction of MTLF in Rel-17, various data from wide area is
needed to train an ML model for NWDAF containing MTLF. However, it is
difficult for NWDAF containing MTLF to collect all the raw data from
distributed data source in different areas.
In order to address the challenges, 3GPP tries to adopt Federated Learning
(also called Federated Machine Learning) technique in NWDAF containing MTLF to
train an ML model, in which there is no need for raw data transferring (e.g.
centralized into NWDAF) but only need for cooperation among multiple NWDAFs
(MTLF) i.e. sharing of ML model and of the learning results among multiple
NWDAFs (MTLF). In Rel-17, however, the cooperation of multiple NWDAF
containing MTLF is explicitly prohibited and it is only allowed for NWDAF
containing AnLF to subscribe or request the ML model from the configured NWDAF
containing MTLF
This Key Issue is aim to study architecture enhancement to support Federated
Learning which allows the cooperation of multiple NWDAF containing MTLF to
train an ML model in 3GPP network with the following aspects:
\- Identify the use cases that required Federated learning in 5GC;
\- Study the registration and discovery of the NWDAF supporting Federated
Learning;
\- Study how to decide whether Federated Learning is required or not for an
existing Analytics ID or a new Analytics ID;
\- Study how to coordinate multiple NWDAFs including selection of participant
NWDAF instances in the Federated Learning group, e.g. assistance information
(if any) to perform the selection, and decision of role for the participant
NWDAF;
\- Study whether and how to perform performance (e.g. network performance and
model performance) monitoring of the NWDAF Federated Learning operation.
NOTE 1: Performance monitoring of Federated Learning operation should be
aligned with mechanisms for improved correctness of analytics defined in
WT#1.2.
NOTE 2: In terms of user data privacy and security improvement, the
cooperation with SA3 is needed.
NOTE 3: The impact on UE and RAN shall be avoided for this Key Issue.
NOTE 4: Solutions requiring model distribution for FL should be aligned with
mechanism for model sharing defined in WT#3.2.
NOTE 5: Server NWDAF connects to one layer of Client NWDAFs, and any of the
Client NWDAFs cannot cascade more sublayers.
NOTE 6: All the NWDAFs attending the Federated Learning should belong to the
same PLMN.
## 5.9 Key Issue #9: Enhancement of NWDAF with finer granularity of location
information
### 5.9.1 Description
The NWDAF can retrieve and collect UE location information and then provide
some analytic(s) to NWDAF consumer(s), e.g. UE mobility analytics, QoS
Sustainability Analytics as defined in TS 23.288 [5]. However, the UE location
information that NWDAF can obtain is only TA/cell granularity in Rel-17.
The horizontal accuracy and the vertical accuracy of the existing location
service can reach a granularity level finer than TA and cell level. Meanwhile,
some extra information (e.g. speed, heading) could possibly also be provided
by the location service. But whether such LCS related information is
beneficial for the NWDAF is not clear, and it also needs to be studied how the
NWDAF can obtain such LCS related information. Therefore, a KI to study
whether and how the NWDAF can provide additional benefits from location
service is required.
In this key issue, the following aspects will be studied:
\- Identify use case(s) and corresponding existing or new Analytics ID(s)
where the analytics require location information with finer granularity than
TA/cell level, and how to enhance related existing Analytics ID(s).
\- Identify how an NWDAF determines that location information with finer
granularity than cell/TA level is required in output analytics.
\- Identify what input data needs to be collected to deliver analytics with
fine granularity location information.
\- Identify how NWDAF acquires the input data to deliver finer granularity
location information. Whether and how the functionality and services of NWDAF
or other NF(s) need to be enhanced.
NOTE 1: Coordinated activities with the eLCS_ph3 study are needed.
NOTE 2: Some examples of UE location different than cell/TA level are
described in clause 4.2 and 4.3, TS 22.071 [6].
## 5.10 Key Issue #10: Interactions with MDAS/MDAF
### 5.10.1 Description
MDAS/MDAF functionality enables a service consumer to obtain management data
analytics, and NWDAF can be one of such service consumers. The following
aspects shall be studied:
\- Identify which use case(s) should be applied for the interactions between
NWDAF and MDAS/MDAF.
\- Whether and how NWDAF can leverage MDAS/MDAF functionality, for producing
Analytics ID(s) given in TS 23.288 [5].
\- Whether and how NWDAF can leverage MDAS/MDAF functionality for data
collection.
\- How MDAS/MDAF instances are discovered and selected by NWDAF.
NOTE 1: Solution impacts to MDAS/MDAF need SA5 to give inputs before
conclusions are made.
NOTE 2: Studying the MDAS/MDAF output is out scope of this KI.

## 6.1 Solution #1: Improving Correctness using multiple ML models for an
analytics report {#solution-1-improving-correctness-using-multiple-ml-models-
for-an-analytics-report .list-paragraph}
### 6.1.1 Description
TS 23.288 [5] assumes that the NWDAF containing AnLF has a single ML model for
inferring analytics, at a given time, after applying any potential analytics
filter. However, in many scenarios, it is possible that the NWDAF containing
AnLF may have multiple ML models at its disposal, and therefore, multiple ML
models can be used to generate the analytic reports provided by a given
Analytics ID.
Having the NWDAF containing AnLF multiple ML models to choose from, enables
use cases where an ML model can be selected depending on, e.g. the UE
location, time of day, network load, level of accuracy or any other filter of
information. NWDAF containing AnLF could indicate e.g. list of time period of
Interest, list of accuracy level of Interest to NWDAF containing MTLF, which
could be used by NWDAF containing MTLF to filter out the corresponding
multiple models accordingly.
This solution is based on the existence of several models to draw a prediction
for a single Analytics ID. In all these scenarios, the following
functionalities needs to be taken into consideration:
\- Each ML model needs to have a unique identifier within the PLMN which is
assigned by the ML model creator, i.e. an NWDAF containing MTLF. The ML Model
unique identifier may be created, e.g. upon the NF Instance ID of the NWDAF
containing an MTLF and a serial number. The exact format and encoding of the
ML model unique identifier is left to stage 3.
\- An NWDAF containing AnLF should be able to get all available ML models for
a specific Analytics ID, from an NWDAF containing MTLF.
\- For the case of ML model provisioning, an NWDAF containing AnLF should be
able to request ML model information (i.e. the parameters described in clause
6.2A.2 of TS 23.288 [5]) for an Analytics ID, from an NWDAF containing MTLF,
and be able to receive responses including more than one ML model for the same
Analytics ID.
\- Upon reception of multiple ML model information for the same Analytics ID,
the NWDAF containing AnLF should be able to choose and download the model(s)
of its choice.
Figure 6.1.1-1 presents an example of an NWDAF containing AnLF that collects
multiple data, feeds each data to a multiple and different ML models, and uses
three ML models for generating predictions for the same Analytics ID. Once a
given ML model has generated a prediction, an internal logic in the
aggregation/voting unit selects the best prediction and delivers it to the
consumer. Therefore, the consumer is provided with the best of the three
predictions or an optimized aggregated prediction.
Figure 6.1.1-1: Aggregation/voting chooses the best prediction
NOTE: The aggregation/voting function in Figure 6.1.1-1 is for illustration
purposes and is left to implementation logic.
### 6.1.2 Procedures
#### 6.1.2.1 General
This solution does not require new procedures. However, the existing
procedures for provisioning an ML model are extended to allow the description
of multiple ML models: the data of several service operations are modified to
accommodate the reference to multiple ML models and the delivery of multiple
predictions.
#### 6.1.2.2 Support for describing multiple ML models in provisioning service
operations
After the NWDAF containing AnLF selects the proper NWDAF containing MTLF via
the NRF procedures, figure 6.1.2.2-1 illustrates a subscription using the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe service operation for a given Analytics ID.
This service operation is enhanced with an indication from the consumer
declaring support for multiple ML models.
Then an Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify request is enhanced with the capability
of including, for a given Analytics ID, pairs of unique identifiers of the ML
model and its corresponding ML model information (as per clause 6.2A.2 of TS
23.288 [5]).
Then, the NWDAF containing AnLF can find out whether it has already downloaded
any of the ML models identified by the unique identifier and may decide to
request, from the NWDAF containing MTLF, one or more ML models of its choice
which has not already downloaded.
The NWDAF containing MTLF analyses the ML Model data privacy, and if the NWDAF
containing AnLF is authorized to receive the requested ML Models, the NWDAF
containing MTLF provide the authorized pairs of unique identifiers of the ML
model and its corresponding ML model information to the NWDAF containing AnLF.
NOTE: The ML Model data privacy may determine that one or more requested ML
Models cannot be provided to this NWDAF containing AnLF.
Figure 6.1.2.2-1: Enhancements to Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision services
Figure 6.1.2.2-2 illustrates an NWDAF containing AnLF sending an
Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request request for a given Analytics ID to an NWDAF
containing MTLF. This service operation is enhanced with an indication from
the consumer declaring support for multiple ML models.
The NWDAF containing MTLF sends an enhanced response including, for a given
Analytics ID, pairs of unique identifiers of the ML model and its
corresponding ML model information (the ML model information is described in
clause 6.2A.2 of TS 23.288 [5]).
Figure 6.1.2.2-2: Enhancements to Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo service
### 6.1.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The interfaces related to ML Model provisioning are updated to support
multiple ML model in the following ways:
\- Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe and Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request are
enhanced with an indication, inserted by the consumer, indicating whether the
consumer supports multiple ML models for the same Analytics ID.
\- Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify and the response to
Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request are enhanced for supporting the provisioning of
data related to multiple ML models for the same Analytics ID, including pairs
of unique identifiers of the ML Model together with its corresponding ML Model
information.
## 6.2 Solution #2: Improving the Correctness of Service Experience
Predictions with Contribution Weights
### 6.2.1 Description
This solution addresses the following aspects of Key Issue #1 for the Service
Experience Analytics ID.
\- How and what information is required to compute and represent the
correctness of NWDAF analytics in a reliable way?
\- Whether and how the NWDAF can improve correctness of NWDAF Analytics (e.g.
which existing and/or additional information may be used by the NWDAF to
improve the correctness of NWDAF Analytics)?
When Service Experience information is provided to the NWDAF for multiple UEs,
the NWDAF does not know the relative importance of the Service Experience
value (i.e. MOS) that was provided by each UE. For example, it might be that
one the Service Experience of one UE is not very important because the UE is
an infrequent user of the service, or the UE does not use all features that
are associated with the service. Whereas another UE might be a frequent user
of the service or a \"power user\" who uses many features that are associated
with the service.
This solution proposes that, when the AF provides Service Experience
Information for a group UEs, the AF can also provide a \"Service Experience
Contribution Weight\" with each UE\'s Service Experience value. The \"Service
Experience Contribution Weight\" is determined by the AF and indicates the
relative importance of each UE\'s Service Experience. The NWDAF can then use
this information to derive more accurate predictions and confidence values.
For example, the NWDAF may choose to give less weight, or importance to a
Service Experience value that is associated with a \"Service Experience
Contribution Weight\" that is lower than other \"Service Experience
Contribution Weights\". The format of the \"Service Experience Contribution
Weight\" may be defined by stage-3 but an example is that the \"Service
Experience Contribution Weight\" may be an integer value with a range that is
agreed on between the MNO and AF where a higher value indicates more
importance than a lower value. The NWDAF may use the \"Service Experience
Contribution Weight\" values the improve the correctness of its Service
Experience predictions and confidence values calculations (e.g. giving less
weight to less important values will result in improved correctness of its
predictions).
### 6.2.2 Procedures
The NWDAF subscribes to the service data from the AF (i.e. the information in
the Table 6.4.2-1 of TS 23.288 [5]) either directly for trusted AFs by
invoking Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service (Event ID = Service Experience
information, Event Filter information = Area of Interest, Application ID) as
defined in TS 23.502 [3], or indirectly for untrusted AFs via NEF by invoking
Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe service (Event ID = Service Experience
information, Event Filter information = Area of Interest, Application ID).
When the AF provides the Service Experience Information (i.e. the information
in the Table 6.4.2-1 of TS 23.288 [5]) the AF can also provide a \"Service
Experience Contribution Weight\" for each Service Experience value.
The NWDAF considers the \"Service Experience Contribution Weight\" values when
calculating Service Experience predictions and confidence values. How the
NWDAF uses the \"Service Experience Contribution Weight\" values when
calculating Service Experience predictions and confidence values is left to
NWDAF implementation and is not in scope of 3GPP.
### 6.2.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
AF:
\- Sends the \"Service Experience Contribution Weight\" when sending a
notification in response to an Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service invocation
(Event ID = Service Experience information).
NWDAF:
\- Receives the \"Service Experience Contribution Weight\" when receiving a
notification in response to an Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service invocation
(Event ID = Service Experience information).
## 6.3 Solution #3: Accuracy based NWDAF Analytics Correctness Improvement
### 6.3.1 Description
This solution is about KI #1: How to improve correctness of NWDAF analytics to
address how to improve correctness of NWDAF analytics.
In AI community, there is a concept called \'accuracy\' which is used to
indicate the correctness of an AI/ML model\'s predictions. The Accuracy is the
percentage of correct predictions in all predictions. One of methods to
determines a prediction is correct is to compare the prediction with its
corresponding ground truth data i.e. the label data.
For the regression problems, the predictions and the ground truth data may be
not same but similar, and their difference can be calculated by other methods
e.g. Mean Absolute Error (MAE). If this difference is smaller than a
threshold, this prediction should be considered as correct.
Figure 6.3.1-1: Accuracy in AI Community
As shown in Figure 6.3.1-2, Accuracy in Training (AiT) and Accuracy in Use
(AiU) can be used to measure the correctness of a ML model, the Accuracy in
Use should be observed/monitored by the NWDAF/network, which could be a
trigger for NWDAF(MTLF) to re-train the ML Model if Accuracy in Use cross a
threshold:
Figure 6.3.1-2: Accuracy in Training with Training dataset vs Accuracy in Use
with live network dataset
As shown in left side of the Figure, a NWDAF(MTLF) trained a ML Model with
Training dataset (input data, ground truth data) and the Accuracy in Training
is to indicate the performance of ML model in training stage by comparing
prediction with ground truth data in validation dataset reserved from training
dataset.
The NWDAF(MTLF) deliver the trained ML Model to a NWDAF(AnLF), which will be
used by the NWDAF(AnLF) to perform inference with input data from live
network.
1) As shown in right side of the Figure, Accuracy in Use is to indicate the
performance of ML model used in live network by comparing prediction with the
observed label data i.e. ground truth from the live network.
Please note that the NWDAF(AnLF) performs inference with live network input
data to get the prediction and also retrieves the label data from live
network.
2) However, due to some reasons, e.g. different data distribution between
training data set and data in live network, poor model generalization ability,
etc. there may be a gap between Accuracy in Training and Accuracy in Use, and
the Accuracy in Use usually is not as good as Accuracy in Training especially
as times goes by.
The NWDAF(AnLF) decides to indicate the NWDAF(MTLF) to re-train the AI/ML
model e.g. if Accuracy in Use crosses a threshold or the gap between Accuracy
in Training and Accuracy in Use crosses a threshold.
In order to improve training data quality e.g. the data distribution, the
NWDAF(AnLF) also provides the input data, ground truth data, where prediction
is regarded as incorrect prediction by comparing with ground truth data, to
help the NWDAF(MTLF) to re-train a better AI/ML Model e.g. with model
generalization ability.
On the other hand, based on local configuration, the NWDAF(MTLF) could decide
to calculate the Accuracy/MAE in Use after collecting the data (the input
data, predictions and the corresponding ground truth data) from the
NWDAF(AnLF) or ADRF, and decides to re-train models.
Note: Input data is the necessary data which is collected by AnLF to perform
inference to generate prediction and the ground truth data is the actual
measured data of the prediction. In other words, the \"ground truth data\" is
the measured data that corresponds or relates to the one predicted.
Similarly, regarding regression, MAE in training and MAE in use is introduced
to measure the ML model correctness.
### 6.3.2 Procedures
#### 6.3.2.1 AnLF-based Accuracy calculating
Figure 6.3.2-1 depicts the procedure for the proposed solution that the AnLF
collects the ground truth data and calculates the AiU.
Figure 6.3.2-1: AnLF collect ground truth data and calculate Accuracy/MAE in
use
1\. The NWDAF(AnLF) service consumer subscribes to analytics information by
invoking the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation. The
parameters that can be provided by the NWDAF service consumer are listed in
clause 6.1.3 of TS 23.288 [5].
2\. The NWDAF(AnLF) subscribes to a NWDAF(MTLF) a trained ML Model by invoking
the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision (Analytics ID, ML Model Filter Information,
Accuracy/MAE requirement) service operation.
3\~4. The MTLF trains the model according to the requirement from AnLF and
notifies the AnLF with the ML model information by invoking
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify (Analytic ID, the file address of the trained
ML model, Accuracy in Training (AiT) or MAE in Training) service operation.
5\~8. The AnLF collects the input data from data providers, e.g. OAM, NFs,
makes predictions and sends the predictions to the NF consumer. The AnLF also
collects the ground truth data, which is actual measured data and
corresponding to the prediction calculated by AnLF (based on the trained ML
Model provided by the MTLF).
9\. The AnLF calculates the Accuracy in Use or the MAE in Use, which reflects
the performance of ML model used in live network by comparing prediction with
the corresponding ground truth data retrieved from the live network by the
AnLF in step 6.
10\. The AnLF compares the Accuracy in Use with the Accuracy in Training
and/or MAE in Use with MAE in Training and decide whether or not to send
notification to MTLF to re-train the AI/ML model e.g. if Accuracy in Use cross
a threshold or by comparing the Accuracy in Training and Accuracy in Use.
11\~12. The AnLF reuse MLModelProvision service (subscription Correlation ID,
Analytic ID, AiU or MAE in Use, the corresponding time scale, input data and
ground truth data) to modify of the original ML model subscription in step 2,
indicating to the MTLF that the Accuracy in Use or MAE in Use is not good as
the Accuracy in Training or MAE in Training and the MTLF retrains the model
with new data from the AnLF.
Both AiU or MAE in Use and the corresponding time scale are indicated to MTLF,
indicating AiU or MAE in Use is calculated within the corresponding time
scale.
In order to improve training data quality e.g. the data distribution, the AnLF
provides the input data, ground truth, where prediction is regarded as
incorrect prediction by comparing with the ground truth:
\- In the case of classification, if the prediction is not same with its
corresponding ground truth data retrieved from live network then this
prediction should be considered as incorrect.
\- In the case of regression, if the difference e.g. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
between the prediction and its corresponding ground truth data is greater than
a threshold, this prediction should be considered as incorrect.
14\~15. The AnLF notifies the consumer that the Accuracy in Use is not as good
as the Accuracy in Training to consequently stop using the provided analytic
result by invoking the Nnwdaf_AnalyticInfo_Notify (Analytic ID, AiU, Disable
notification).
#### 6.3.2.2 MTLF-based Accuracy calculating
Figure 6.3.2-2 depicts the procedure for the proposed solution that the AnLF
collects the ground truth data but MTLF calculates the AiU.
Figure 6.3.2-2: MTLF calculate Accuracy/MAE in use with collected data by AnLF
1-8. The procedures are same as described in step 1-8 of clause 6.3.2.1 except
in step 4 the MTLF in addition indicates that the MTLF need data (input data,
prediction and its corresponding ground truth data) to monitor the performance
of the ML model.
9\. The AnLF sends the data to the MTLF by reusing the MLModelProvision
service (subscription Correlation ID, Analytic ID, input data, prediction and
its corresponding ground truth data).
Alternatively, the AnLF could store the data in the ADRF by using
Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageRequest , which could be retrieved by MTLF to
calculate Accuracy/MAE in use.
10-11. The MTLF calculates the Accuracy/MAE in Use by comparing predictions
and the corresponding ground truth data retrieved from the AnLF in step 9, and
compares the Accuracy/MAE in Use with the Accuracy/MAE in Training and decide
whether or not to re-train the ML model.
12\. The MTLF may collect the new data for re-training from data providers,
e.g. OAM, NFs.
13\. The MTLF re-trains the ML model with the data collected in step 9 and
step 12, and notifies the AnLF with the re-trained model and accuracy report
(Accuracy/MAE in Use and/or Accuracy/MAE in re-training).
14-15. The procedures are same as described in step 13-14 of clause 6.3.2.1.
### 6.3.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
The solution has the following impacts:
NWDAF(AnLF):
\- Collects data from corresponding data provider(s) to calculate the Accuracy
in Use and MAE in Use.
\- Sends the notifications to the NWDAF(MTLF) and consumer to inform the
Accuracy in Use or MAE in Use has decreased.
\- Sends data (input data, prediction and its corresponding ground truth data)
to the MTLF or ADRF.
NWDAF(MTLF):
\- Receives the notification that the Accuracy in Use or MAE in Use has
decreased from NWDAF(AnLF) and re-trains the AI/ML Model.
\- Receives data from the AnLF to calculate Accuracy/MAE in Use, which are
notified to NWDAF(AnLF).
NWDAF service Consumer:
\- Receives the notification that the Accuracy in Use or MAE in Use has
decreased from NWDAF(AnLF) and stops using the analytics provided by the
NWDAF(AnLF).
## 6.4 Solution #4: Determining ML model drift for improving analytics
accuracy
### 6.4.1 Description
The accuracy of analytic output from an NWDAF depends very much on the
accuracy of the ML model provided by the MTLF NWDAF.
The training data that are used to train an ML model are usually historical
data (data stored in the ADRF). The validity/accuracy of the ML model depends
on whether the training data used are up to date with the real-time network
configuration/behaviour. For example, compared to when the training data were
collected the network operator may configure additional network resources to a
network slice, or the number of users accessing services via the core network
may considerably increase (e.g. tourist season in the summer). Such use case
may cause a model drift given that ML model was not trained with up-to-date
data.
There are many reasons that ML model drift can occur but the main cause is a
change of the data with time. A simple solution to this problem is to re-train
an ML model periodically. Such approach will ensure that the NWDAF always uses
an up-to-date training data for an ML model. However, such approach requires
considerable resources and is not energy efficient. Hence a solution is
required to allow the network (i.e. NWDAF) to determine when an ML model
requires re-training.
The solution proposed in this paper focuses on the NWDAF to evaluate if an
action taken by a consumer would result in a model drift and then evaluate if
the training data are up-to-date.
A general procedure is provided in the figure below.
Figure 6.4.1-1: Model drift detected at NWDAF MTLF
The general steps followed are:
\- A consumer of analytics determines an action and optionally provides the
action taken to the MTLF
\- The MTLF determines if the action taken would significantly change the
behaviour of one or more NFs and determine if there could be a data drift
\- The MTLF compares the training data with real-time (or near-real time) data
and evaluate if (any) data drift detected would result in an ML model drift
that would reduce the accuracy of the analytics.
NOTE: The MTLF can use statistical methods to determine if there is data
drift. Such approach is out of scope of 3GPP.
### 6.4.2 Procedures
The procedure is shown below:
Figure 6.4.2-1: Model drift determined at MTLF NWDAF
1\. A consumer requests analytics including an Analytics ID as per TS 23.288
[5]. For example, a consumer can request analytics for an Analytics ID for NF
load. The request may include a minimum accuracy may denote a confidence level
of the analytics requested. The consumer may include an indication that it can
provide feedback on an action taken.
2\. The AnLF request an ML model from the MTLF NWDAF to derive analytics for
the Analytics ID requested if the AnLF has no ML model available for the
requested Analytics ID.
3\. The MTLF NWDAF provides the current trained ML model for the Analytics ID.
4\. The MTLF provides the requested ML model to the AnLF NWDAF. Based on the
feedback indication provided by the consumer the MTLF may include in the
request to provide feedback when a consumer determines an action based on
analytics provided by the AnLF. The feedback is used to determine whether
drift detection should be carried out for an ML model (see step 10). The MTLF
includes a notification correlation ID in the request.
5\. The AnLF NWDAF derives analytics.
6\. The AnLF NWDAF provides requested analytics to the consumer. The AnLF also
forwards the feedback request received from the MTLF.
7\. The consumer may determine an action based on the received analytics. For
example, if the analytics indicate a high load at a UPF function the consumer,
i.e. SMF, may select a less loaded UPF.
8\. [CONDITIONAL] Based on the feedback indication the consumer determines to
report a network behaviour change including a time where the action was taken.
NOTE: How the consumer determines that the action taken changes the behaviour
of the network is implementation specific.
9\. [CONDITIONAL] The consumer reports to the AnLF/MTLF that the action t will
change the behaviour of the network.
Editor\'s note: The type of actions that the consumer can provide is FFS.
10\. The MTLF determines based on the received feedback to evaluate the
accuracy of the ML model. Alternatively, the MTLF at regular intervals
initiates an ML model drift detection as described in steps 12-14.
11\. The MTLF NWDAF subscribes to historical data that were used to train the
ML model for the specific Analytic ID from the ADRF.
12\. The MTLF NWDAF subscribes to real-time data (or near real time data) from
the 5GC NFs, AF, OAM that are required to derive analytics for an Analytic ID
(as described for each Analytic ID in TS 23.288 [5].
13\. The MTLF NWDAF determines model drift by comparing historical data with
near real time data. The MTLF NWDAF may use statistical analysis or use AI/ML
procedures to determine data/model drift (out of scope of 3GPP).
14\. If the MTLF NWDAF determines that Model drift exceed a threshold the MTLF
retrains the ML model.
15\. The MTLF NWDAF may notify the AnLF that the ML model drift exceeds a
threshold. The notification may notify the AnLF to stop using the ML model to
provide analytics. The MTLF NWDAF may also provide an indication on when the
updated ML model will be available.
16\. Based on the indication received from the MTLF the AnLF may indicate to
the analytics consumer a pause in the subscription because an ML model
requires retraining. The AnLF may also indicate the time new analytics will be
available.
17\. The MTLF NWDAF provides the re-trained ML model to the AnLF NWDAF.
18\. The AnLF notifies the consumer to resume subscription indicating
analytics are available.
### 6.4.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
\- MTLF: Identifying ML model drift by comparing historical data with real-
time data.
\- Consumer of analytics: Providing feedback to AnLF/MTLF on an action taken.
## 6.5 Solution #5: Enhancements on ML model provision to improve correctness
of NWDAF analytics
### 6.5.1 Description
This is a solution for Key Issue #1: \"How to improve correctness of NWDAF
analytics\".
This solution introduces several options for improving the correctness of
NWDAF analytics by enabling the ability of self-correction on NWDAF based on
closed-loop control.
Specifically, in case of analytics for prediction, the provided analytics
(i.e. desired data and events for prediction) by an NWDAF can be different to
actual data or events occurred in analytics target period and it may become
significant faults on the consumer NF action. In order to address the
potential faults on NF action, this solution proposes that the procedures for
NWDAF: i) to monitor the accuracy of the provided analytics; and ii) to
correct potential errors on analytics; as described in clause 6.5.2.
For details, NWDAF is decomposed into AnLF and MTLF which provide analytics
and ML model, respectively. Since AnLF generates analytics inferred by the
provisioned ML model from MTLF, the error on analytics could be incurred by
inappropriate ML model provision. Thus, MTLF should monitor the error on
analytics for checking accuracy of the provisioned ML model. However, the
current specification does not allow that MTLF monitors the analytics
generated by AnLF as well as the actual data and events during Analytics
target period. To that end, this solution proposes two options: i) AnLF based
error monitoring; and ii) MTLF based error monitoring; as described in clauses
6.5.2.1 and 6.5.2.2, respectively.
Also, in current specification the MTLF provides ML model relying on the
belief that the 5GS will be in similar state during Analytics target period as
the period when the trained data had been sampled. In fact, however, the
configuration updates, policy changes, and various unexpected events on 5GS
would continuously occur during the analytics target period and it could incur
the dynamics that the provisioned ML model have not been trained. In case,
consequently, the accuracy of NWDAF analytics will be significantly degraded.
In order to address the problem, this solution proposes to enable MTLF to
detect the dynamics and to provide a better ML model for the system as
described in clause 6.5.2.3.
### 6.5.2 Procedures
Figure 6.5.2-1 depicts the general procedures for this solution to enhance the
accuracy of NWDAF analytics.

events and data related to the analytics for the ML model during the ML Model
Target Period by triggering the procedures in clause 6.2 of TS 23.288 [5]. If
the NWDAF containing AnLF provides ADRF information at step 0b, the NWDAF
containing MTLF may retrieve the events and data for generating an Analytics
from the ADRF.

#### 6.5.2.3 Procedures for MTLF to detect dynamics on the analytics
Figure 6.5.2.3-1 describes the procedures that NWDAF containing MTLF detect
crucial changes in 5GS which impact on the ML model provision.
Figure 6.5.2.3-1: The procedures for detection of dynamics on the analytics
0a. The NWDAF containing MTLF may have classes of 5GS state, which consist of
e.g. set of configurations related to Target of Analytics Reporting, set of
applied policies related to Target of Analytics Reporting, and set of expected
events related to Target of Analytics Reporting, for ML Model provision, and
may apply it to ML model selection for a certain analytics.
NOTE 1: The classes of 5GS state may be set by operator\'s configuration or
may be determined by the internal logic of NWDAF containing MTLF and it is out
of SA2 scope.
0b. The NWDAF containing AnLF subscribes to a (set of) trained ML model(s)
associated with a (set of) Analytics ID(s) by invoking
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe service operation as described in step 1 of
Figure 6.5.2-1.
1\. The NWDAF containing MTLF provides a (set of) trained ML model(s)
associated with a (set of) Analytics ID(s) to the NWDAF containing AnLF
according to the criteria and the classes of 5GS state by invoking
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation.
2a-2d. The NWDAF containing MTLF subscribes at least one of the services which
provide the notification of changes on 5GS state which was set by the classes
at step 0a (e.g. occurrence of changes on UE subscription data, occurrence of
changed on UE policy, occurrence of changed on access and mobility related
policy, occurrence of changed on session management related policy,
configuration update by OAM, etc.) for the specific targets for analytics
(e.g. the combination of S-NSSAI(s), UE IDs (SUPI), UE group ID(s),
application ID(s), PDU Session ID(s), Serving AMF ID(s), Serving SMF ID(s),
etc.). For details, the NWDAF containing MTLF may subscribe to
Npcf_EventExposure_Subscribe operation with a new Event ID(s), i.e. UE policy
update, AM policy update, and SM policy update. When the PCF invokes
Npcf_UE/AM/SMPolicyControl_Update_response or
Npcf_UE/AM/SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service operation, the new event ID(s)
of PCF notifies the occurrence of UE, AM, and SM policy changes to the NWDAF
containing MTLF, respectively. Also, the NWDAF containing MTLF may further
subscribe to Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service in order to track the occurrence of
the changes in UE subscription data (e.g. Access and Mobility Subscription
data, Session Management Subscription data, Slice Selection Subscription data,
etc.). UDM may subscribe to notifications from UDR for tracking the occurrence
of changes on UE subscription data by Nudr_DM_Subscribe.
3a-3c. According to the subscription at step 2a-2d, the NWDAF containing MTLF
receives the information of the occurrence of changes on 5GS state which was
set by the classes at step 0a.
4\. In order to evaluate the impacts of 5GS state changes at step 3a-3c on the
performance of provisioned ML model, the NWDAF containing MTLF may collect the
event and data related to the ML model and the analytics during ML Model
Target Period by triggering the procedures in clause 6.2 of TS 23.288 [5].
5\. The NWDAF containing MTLF evaluates the inconsistency of the provisioned
ML model for the changed 5GS state at steps 3a-3d with compared to the classes
of 5GS state at step 0a and/or the actual data and events at step 4. According
to the results of evaluation, the NWDAF containing MTLF may update the classes
of 5GS state for ML model provision.
### 6.5.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NWDAF containing AnLF:
\- AnLF can measure the error between the provided analytics and actual
data/events.
\- AnLF is able to store the events and data related to the provided analytics
during the analytics target period in ADRF and to send ADRF information to the
MTLF.
\- AnLF is able to store events and data used for generating an Analytics in
ADRF and to send ADRF information to the MTLF.
NWDAF containing MTLF:

provisioned ML model and the actual data/events.
\- MTLF should consider the errors on analytics, the differences between
actual data/events and the trained data set, and/or the impact of the
configuration updates, policy changes and various unexpected events to improve
ML model provision services.
\- Some additional parameters will be added to
Nnwdaf_MLModel_Provision_Subscribe/Notify service operation to support the
procedure as described in clause 6.5.2.1.
NF:
\- In order to track the occurrence of changes on 5GS state, PCF supports new
event ID (s), i.e. UE policy update, AM policy update, SM policy update for
event exposure.
## 6.6 Solution #6: Correctness improvement of NWDAF by determining ML model
performance
### 6.6.1 Description
This solution addresses Key Issue #1 \"How to improve correctness of NWDAF\".
After the Analytics consumer NF consumes the analytics from the NWDAF
containing AnLF, some network data are generated. The NWDAF shall collect
these network data from the Analytics consumer NF after the Analytics consumer
NF consumed the Analytics results. The network data are used to detect that
improving the correctness of an Analytics ID is needed. And the network data
will be used for the NWDAF to determine the ML model performance and/or re-
train the ML model.
This solution provides the following functionalities:
\- The NWDAF collects network data of consumer NFs to support NWDAF perceive
the correctness and ML model performance.
\- The NWDAF calculates network data to evaluate ML model performance and
trigger further ML model training to improve the accuracy of NWDAF.
\- The NWDAF can reduce the signalling load of data collection through data
collection function NF such as DCCF.
### 6.6.2 Procedures
The following figure presents an example procedure of correctness improvement
of NWDAF by determining ML model performance.
Figure 6.6.2-1: Procedure for correctness improvement of NWDAF by determining
ML model performance
1\. Steps 1 specified in TS 23.288 [5] are reused to perform network data
analytics for the analytics consumer and data collection for the data
consumer.
2-3. After the analytics consumer NF consumes the analytics, the NWDAF
containing AnLF collects the network data by invoking the
Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation or via DCCF by invoking the
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation, the network data may include
the data from analytics consumer NF and/or data source. This step is skipped
if the NWDAF containing AnLF was subscribed to the analytics consumer NF
and/or data source directly or via DCCF in step 1.
4\. The NWDAF containing AnLF determines ML model performance (e.g. accuracy,
precision or recall) by comparing the network data and the analytics provided
to the Analytics consumer NF in step 1.
The NWDAF containing AnLF determines whether further training of the ML Model
is needed based on the ML model performance and internal strategies.
If further training of the ML Model is needed, the NWDAF containing AnLF
subscribes ML model associated with the Analytics ID in step 1 by invoking the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe to get the re-trained ML model, the
subscribe information may include the ML model performance.
The NWDAF containing MTLF determines that further training is needed, this
NWDAF may initiate data collection from NFs, (e.g. AMF/DCCF/ADRF), UE
Application (via AF) or OAM as described in TS 23.288, to re-train the ML
model.
In addition, the NWDAF containing MTLF may collect the network data from the
NWDAF containing AnLF for re-training the ML model.
The NWDAF containing MTLF notifies the NWDAF containing AnLF with the re-
trained ML Model Information (containing a (set of) file address of the
trained ML model) by invoking Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service
operation.
### 6.6.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NWDAF containing AnLF:
\- Supports collecting the network data after the analytics consumer NF
consumes the analytics.
\- Supports determining ML model performance.
\- Supports triggering further training of the ML Model based on the ML model
performance.
NWDAF containing MTLF:
\- Supports further training of the ML Model based on the ML model
performance.
## 6.7 Solution #7: Enhancements to NWDAF analytics services
### 6.7.1 Description
In general, the ability for a service consumer to use a performance score to
select an NWDAF Analytics and/or ML model may help such service consumer to
obtain the desired level of correctness. This solution proposes to associate a
score attribute to NWDAF Analytics and ML models, which, similarly to what
happens with popular recommendation systems, can be used in the selection of
NWDAF Analytics and ML models.
In particular, the solution allows service consumers to rate ML models and/or
NWDAF analytics from different providers (or by the same provider offering
multiple ML models for the same NWDAF analytics). Also, the solution allows
service consumers to retrieve the score associated to the NWDAF Analytics and
ML models. The rating can be used to improve the correctness of analytics,
e.g. an NWDAF with low rating can trigger re-training of the ML models used by
that NWDAF.
Two scenarios are envisioned in this solution:
1\. An analytics consumer rates an analytics service (i.e. Analytics ID) from
an NWDAF (see procedure in clause 6.7.2.1);
2\. an NWDAF containing AnLF rates an ML model provided by an NWDAF containing
MTLF (see procedure in clause 6.7.2.2).
In both scenarios, a consumer from the same vendor of the analytics service or
model provisioning service is allowed to rate the analytics service or the
used ML model, while the entity producing/exposing the analytics service or ML
model is not allowed to self-rate it. For example, an analytics consumer from
the same vendor as the NWDAF containing AnLF producer can rate the analytics
service, while self-ratings from the NWDAF containing AnLF are not accepted.
The rating is based on a metric associated to both the Analytics ID and the
corresponding ML model. Such metric is stored in the NF profile at the NRF.
The solution leverages on the introduction of:
\- A Trusted Rating Logical Function (TRLF) that manages the rating provided
by the service consumers. Furthermore, it ensures that only verified consumers
(i.e. consumers that really have had access to the ML model and/or Analytics
services) can rate the ML model and/or the Analytic service. For example, it
prevents rating (of its own) by the producer of the ML model and/or analytics
service while an analytics consumer from the same vendor is still able to rate
the analytics service. For example, NWDAF(MTLF) that has produced the ML model
is forbidden to rate such ML model, while NWDAF(AnLF) from the same vendor
could rate the ML model if it has used the ML model.
\- A rating format that includes key information regarding the usage of the
Analytics service provided or not by using an ML model and that can be
exploited by other consumers as well as by other producers/vendors.
### 6.7.2 Procedures
#### 6.7.2.1 Analytics consumer rating an NWDAF analytics provided by an NWDAF
containing AnLF
Figure 6.7.2.1-1: Procedure for analytics consumer rating an NWDAF analytics
provided by an NWDAF containing AnLF
Pre-condition: NF profile of the NWDAF in NRF contains a metric that should be
utilized to rate the analytics service. A metric is associated to each
analytics service (i.e. Analytics ID).
1\. An Analytics Consumer sends a discovery request to NRF looking for NWDAFs
providing the Analytics ID(s) and other input parameters as specified in
clause 6.1.3 of TS 23.288 [5].
2\. The NRF returns to the Analytics consumer the list of available NWDAFs
matching the filter parameters along with the metrics to rate the analytics.
3\. The Analytics Consumer requests, for the discovered NWDAFs, the ratings of
the Analytics ID from the Trusted Rating Logical Function (TRLF) through a
Ntrlf_RatingDiscovery service. In the request, the Analytics Consumer
specifies the NWDAF(s) and the Analytics ID(s). The Analytics Consumer sets
the \"rating aggregation level\" request parameter according to its preferred
value: \"Global Average\" to receive an aggregated model rating (i.e. a single
value), \"average per vendor\" to receive a single average value for each
vendor which issued a rating, or \"detailed\" in case it is interested to
receive the rating from each service consumer which casted a rating.
The aggregated rating is a value, e.g. between 0 (very bad performance) to 5
(very good performance) derived by the TRLF by an average over all ratings.
Along with the aggregated rating, the Analytics Consumer receives also the
total number of ratings submitted, so that the consumer can derive the
accuracy of the rating.
The Analytics consumer may also implement a local cache for such ratings, in
order to avoid the need to query TRLF for each NWDAF discovery request. In
this case, steps 2 and 3 may be skipped for future requests.
4\. The TRLF returns to the Analytics Consumer the requested ratings according
to the specified \"rating aggregation level\". Based on the \"average per
vendor\" or \"detailed\" model rating, the analytics consumer can identify how
ratings were casted by each vendor.
5\. The Analytics consumer selects the NWDAF providing the best performance
for the specific use case and scenario. The Analytics consumer requests the
analytics service to the selected NWDAF specifying also its Consumer ID
comprising the NF (instance or Set) ID and Vendor ID.
6\. The NWDAF generates a token that can be used by the Analytics consumer to
rate the analytics service.
NOTE: The normative aspects about token generation, and how it is used for
verification and communicated to other NFs should be carried out in
coordination with SA WG3.
7\. The NWDAF sends through the Ntrlf_AnalyticsServiceConsumed service to the
TRLF information about the Consumer ID, Analytics ID, information on the ML
model used for producing the analytics (if any), its own NWDAF (instance or
Set) ID and the token generated for the Analytics consumer. In this way, the
TRLF can associate the rating from the Consumer to the analytics service
provided by the NWDAF and, implicitly, to the ML model used to generate it in
case the analytics service is based on an ML model.
8\. The TRLF sends an acknowledgement to the NWDAF.
9\. The NWDAF sends the analytics response to the Analytics consumer along
with the token generated for allowing only verified consumers (i.e. only the
ones that really have consumed the service) to evaluate the analytics service.
In case the analytics consumer subscribed to the analytics service, the token
is valid for the entire subscription duration and the consumer may update its
rating by sending another Ntrlf_AnalyticsRating request. Once the subscription
is terminated, the NWDAF shall inform the TRLF about it, such that only a
final rating can be provided by the consumer after which the token is revoked.
10\. The analytics consumer evaluates the performance of the analytics service
utilizing the metric obtained by NRF during the discovery procedure.
11\. The analytics consumer through the Ntrlf_AnalyticsRating service sends
its rating to the TRLF. The request also includes the Consumer ID of the
analytics consumer and the received token.
12\. The TRLF, in case the token matches and the analytics consumer is not the
model producer, accepts and updates the rating. The TRLF stores the rating per
Analytics ID and for each Consumer ID.
13\. The TRLF sends to the analytics consumer a confirmation regarding the
update of the rating.
#### 6.7.2.2 NWDAF containing AnLF rating an ML model provided by an NWDAF
containing MTLF
This procedure, depicted in Figure 6.7.2.2-1, enables an NWDAF containing AnLF
to rate an ML model received by NWDAF containing MTLF.
Figure 6.7.2.2-1: Procedure for NWDAF containing AnLF rating an NWDAF
analytics provided by an NWDAF containing MTLF
1\. The NWDAF containing AnLF requests, for the NWDAFs that support the
Analytics ID for the desired AOI) the rating(s) of the employed ML model(s)
from the Trusted Rating Logical Function (TRLF) through a
Ntrlf_RatingDiscovery service. In the request, the NWDAF containing AnLF
specifies the NWDAF(s) and the Analytics ID(s). The NWDAF containing AnLF sets
the \"rating aggregation level\" request parameter according to its preferred
value: \"Global Average\" to receive an aggregated model rating (i.e. a single
value), \"average per vendor\" to receive a single average value for each
vendor which issued a rating, or \"detailed\" in case it is interested to
receive the rating from each service consumer which casted a rating.
2\. The TRLF returns to the NWDAF containing AnLF the requested ratings per
model ID and per Analytics ID, according to the specified \"rating aggregation
level\". Based on the \"average per vendor\" or \"detailed\" model rating, the
analytics consumer can identify how ratings were casted by each vendor.
3\. The NWDAF containing AnLF selects the NWDAF containing MTLF providing the
required performance of the ML model for the specific use case and scenario.
The NWDAF containing AnLF subscribes to ML model provisioning service to the
selected NWDAF specifying also its Consumer ID comprising the NF (instance or
Set) ID and Vendor ID.
4\. The NWDAF containing MTLF generates a token that can be used by the NWDAF
containing AnLF to rate the ML model.
5\. The NWDAF sends through the Ntrlf_AnalyticsServiceConsumed service to the
TRLF information about the Consumer ID, Model ID and version used for
producing the analytics, its NWDAF ID and version and the token generated for
the NWDAF containing AnLF.
6\. The TRLF sends an acknowledgement to the NWDAF containing MTLF.
7\. The NWDAF containing MTLF sends the subscription notification to the NWDAF
containing AnLF along with the token generated.
8\. The NWDAF containing AnLF evaluates the performance of the ML model
utilizing the metric obtained by NRF during the discovery procedure.
9\. The NWDAF containing AnLF through the Ntrlf_AnalyticsRating service sends
its rating to the TRLF. The request also includes the Consumer ID of the NWDAF
containing AnLF and the received token.
10\. The TRLF, in case the token matches and the NWDAF containing AnLF is not
the model producer, accepts and updates the rating. The TRLF stores the rating
per Analytics ID and for each Consumer ID.
11\. The TRLF sends to the NWDAF containing AnLF a confirmation regarding the
update of the rating.
### 6.7.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
This solution introduces the Trusted Rating Logical Function (TRLF), which
exposes the following services:
\- Ntrlf_RatingDiscovery service.
\- Ntrlf_AnalyticsServiceConsumed service.
\- Ntrlf_AnalyticsRating service.
NRF
\- Support for the metric parameter associated to the Analytics IDs and ML
models in the Nnrf_discovery service.
## 6.8 Solution #8: NWDAF assisted service type detection
### 6.8.1 Description
This solution is for Key Issue#2: NWDAF-assisted application detection.
The application detection is an important mechanism for the operator e.g. to
optimize its user\'s service experience; relieve the load of the network
function; etc.
\- For example, for XR service delivered over HTTPS, it is not able to
leverage DPI to get XR related information to assist smart scheduling as
proposed in XR study and it is interesting to discuss how to leverage AI/ML
e.g. DFI to get some XR related information.
\- Another example, it is useful for the operator to monitor which application
(e.g. a video service which is relatively not urgent) lead to the heavy load
of an NF or a network slice then make decisions to relieve the NF load or NSI
Load e.g. reduce the Session-AMBR for the PDU Session who serves the
application.
Traditionally, the application traffic detection in user plane is depend on
DPI (deep packet inspection) function installed in UPF. However, the DPI in
only suitable for plaintext traffic (i.e. original readable text in the
packet) but not for the encrypted traffic.
To help the encrypted application traffic detection, as defined in clause
6.1.2.3 of TS 23.503 [4], ASP may provide the PFD (packet flow description)
information including Application ID, 3-tuple(s) etc. to the UPF via NEF
(PFDF)/SMF. Then the UPF can determine the Application ID for the encrypted
traffic based on the PFD information and the 5-tuple of the encrypted traffic.
However, it is the ASP who determines if the PFD information is provided or
not, which may be out of control for the Operator.
If no any PFD information from the ASP, it is possible for NWDAF to derive
Service Type analytics (including e.g. Service Type and its corresponding IP
3-tuple and/or Traffic characteristics) to help the traffic detection in UPF.
This solution proposes to define a new terminology i.e. Service Type including
Browsing, Video Streaming, Audio Streaming, File Sharing, Multimedia,
Interactive Messages, Video call over IP, Voice call over IP and so on.
Alternatively, the definition of the current Application ID in clause 3.1 of
TS 23.503 [4] can be enhanced to support these service types.
Editor\'s note: Whether there is a need for a Service Type or the Application
ID can cover is FFS.
As a potential consumer NF, the PFDF may subscribe or request the Service Type
analytics and locally store the analytics as new PFD information, and then the
PFDF pushes the new PFD information to SMF and UPF to identify the Service
Type of the traffic flows based on the new PFD information and the 3-tuple of
traffic in the UPF.
\- For any UE, based on operator policy, PCF may trigger the Service Type
detection in a specific area of interest and requests the NEF(PFDF) to push
the new PFD information (including the Service Type related information) to
the UPFs located in the AoI. Then the UPF may report the service type
detection result for this AoI to PCF for QoS control.
\- For a single UE, PCF may get the service type detection requirement per
UE/per AF session from AF, then SMF may pull the PFD information from the
NEF(PFDF) to the UPF. Then the UPF may report the service type detection
result for this UE to PCF for QoS control.
Editor\'s note: How the new PDR is activated and the reporting from UDR to PCF
is done is FFS.
Editor\'s note: How the Service Type detection and Service Type QoS control
coexist with the existing SDF detection and QoS control define in TS 23.503
[4] is FFS.
The input data for the Service Type analytics is shown in Table 6.8.1-1.
Table 6.8.1-1: Service flow level Data from UPF and/or AF related to a
particular Service Type
+----------------------------+---------+----------------------------+ | Information | Source | Description | +============================+=========+============================+ | Timestamp | UPF, AF | A time stamp associated | | | | with the collected | | | | information. | +----------------------------+---------+----------------------------+ | 3-tuple | UPF, AF | protocol, server side IP | | | | address and port number | | | | for a service flow | +----------------------------+---------+----------------------------+ | Service Type | AF | Service Type of the | | | | service data flow | +----------------------------+---------+----------------------------+ | Duration | UPF, AF | Duration of the service | | | | flow level data | +----------------------------+---------+----------------------------+ | UL/DL Bit Rate | UPF, AF | The observed bit rate for | | | | UL direction; and | | | | | | | | The observed bit rate for | | | | DL direction. | +----------------------------+---------+----------------------------+ | UL/DL Packet Delay | UPF, AF | The observed Packet delay | | | | for UL direction; and | | | | | | | | The observed Packet delay | | | | for the DL direction. | +----------------------------+---------+----------------------------+ | Number of UL/DL packet | UPF, AF | The observed number of | | transmission | | UL/DL packet transmission. | +----------------------------+---------+----------------------------+ | Size of UL/DL packet | UPF, AF | The observed size of UL/DL | | retransmission | | packet transmission. | +----------------------------+---------+----------------------------+
Editor\'s note: Whether the Service Type or the AF-Application ID is reported
by the AF and why a new identifier is needed is FFS.
NOTE 1: How to collect the QoS flow level Network Data from UPF is depend on
the conclusion of FS_UPEAS.
To collect the UL/DL Packet Delay, the current QoS Monitoring Event (including
end to end delay i.e. Uu+N3/N9 delay for specific QoS flow or for specific PDU
session) by UPF as defined in clause 5.2.26.2 of TS 23.502 [3] can be re-used.
NOTE 2: The current Packet delay detection and reporting in R17 is only
supported for URLLC but how NWDAF collects the UL/DL Packet Delay from UPF
will be defined in FS_UPEAS.
Editor\'s note: Extensive reporting of all traffic flows may conflicts with
requirement to avoid extra UPF load in the key issue. How to avoid the
degradation of UPF Load because of the extensive reporting of all traffic
flows should be aligned with the conclusion of KI#2: Support UPF expose
information to other NFs in FS_UPEAS.
With the input data, NWDAF uses the ML algorithm (e.g. K-Means) to cluster the
data set to derive one or more 3-tuple(s) for a Service Type. The statistics
and prediction types of Service Type analytics are shown in Table 6.8.1-2 and
Table 6.8.1-3, respectively.

providing Service Type analytics to NF.
UPF/AF:
\- Report service flow level data to NWDAF.
## 6.9 Solution #9: NWDAF-assisted application detection
### 6.9.1 Description
This solution is proposed to address Key Issue #2: NWDAF-assisted application
detection.
To differentiate an application traffic handling, the first step is to
distinguish application traffic from other traffics. In 5G network, an
application can be distinguished by a set of packet headers (SDFs) or
application IDs. The most common approach to detect traffic is use a set of
packet headers which usually contains source and destination address. The
application ID can be used for referring to the UPF\'s specific application
detection filter, and AF may provide PFDs according to clause 4.18 of TS
23.502 [3] to update application detection filter information associated with
the application ID. A PFD contents could contain flow description (service-
side 3-tuple), URL, and domain name/protocol information. When an AF delivers
PFD to NEF (PFDF), it will be distributed to SMFs and UPFs to enable flow
detection according to clause 5.8.2 of TS 23.501 [2]. The SMF use the
procedure described in clause 4.18.3.1 of TS 23.502 [3] to provision or remove
the PFDs associated to a specific application ID.
However, as indicated by the KI description, the ASP may provide an initial
PFD information but does not update it in time or does not update it anymore,
then it is unknown how the UPF detect the application traffic. As it may
happen when the ASP invokes the Nnef_PFDManagement_Create service to provide
PFDs and then invokes the Nnef_PFDManagement_Delete service with a certain
delay according to clause 4.18 of TS 23.502 [3].
The objective of this solution is to provide analytics on application traffic
based on user consent. The proposed solution provides analytics including new
PFD information or PFD information for known applications by extracting
network traffic signature and inferring application id. The known application
means an application for which the application ID is already known by the 5GC
and can be referenced within PCC rules and for which PFD information (may not
be the latest) is already available, which allows the 5GC to perform the
\"application detection\" analytics in order to get the latest PFD
information.
To realize this solution, one of the main features is 1) collect measurement
of an application to extract statistical characteristics, 2) collect payload
of packets to extract payload characteristics (such as domain name contained
in the payload). The baseline usage of the generated analytics is to store the
captured application characteristics as a PFD, and the PFD is used by SMF and
UPF to detect a known application defined as TS 23.502 [3].
The NWDAF could collect the current PFD information in use (including
Application ID, IP 3-tuple,URL, Domain name information) from the UDR via NEF
(PFDF).
Based on PFD information from NEF/UDR and traffic information from UPF, new
PFD information (including Application ID, new IP 3-tuple, new URL, new Domain
name information) for the existing Application ID could be derived by the
NWDAF. The new PFD information provided by the NWDAF can be used by the NEF
for provisioning SMF/UPF.
The SMF can requests the provision of the PFDs associated to an application
ID, then it translates the PCC rules associated with the applications
identifier to PDRs to install it on the UPF. So, for a full automatize
process, the SMF needs to know the application identifier that contains the
PFDs to assigns it to a PCC rule with the desired traffic policies. Also, the
consumer of the analytic (e.g. NEF) may be interested only in a subset of the
applications found by the NWDAF, so a new Analytics Filter is proposed in this
solution to cover both needs:
\- Filter the applications that the NWDAF shall provision to the consumer.
\- Provide input information to the NWDAF to name the found applications.
The consumer informs the NWDAF about the target applications through the
\"Applications Characteristics\". The \"Application Characteristics\" are
specific well know KPIs between the traffic characteristics i.e. the relations
that will identify each of the application.
The application characteristics are created from the traffic features provided
by the UPF as input of the data collection: Data duration, QoS flow bit rate,
packet transmission, size of packets, data volume, UL/DL Packet Delay, in
combination with an application relation function: min(), application with the
minimum value, max(), application with the maximum value.
Several \"Application Characteristic\" can be used per filter using and/or
operators as on Table 5.2.19.2.1-1 of TS 23.502 [3], e.g.:
Table 5.2.19.2.1-1: Example of Event Filters for NWDAF exposure events
+--------------------------------+------------------------------------+ | Event ID for NWDAF exposure | Event Filter (List of Parameter | | | Values to Match) | +================================+====================================+ | Assisted application detection | \ | | | | | | \ | +--------------------------------+------------------------------------+
The name given to the \"Application Characteristics\" is used by the NWDAF to
name the applications that match the characteristic.
In case the NWDAF receives \"Application Characteristics\" filters in the
subscription/request of the analytic, the NWDAF only retrieve the applications
matching the filters.
The below is the principles of the solution:
\- A consumer (e.g. NEF(PFDF)) requests to the NWDAF to provide PFDs for newly
detected applications.
\- [Optionally] Use the filter \"Application Characteristics\".
\- The NWDAF requests to provide information on SDF that does not match an
installed PDR at the SMF/UPF.
\- The NWDAF analyses the collected data to generate unique traffic patterns,
and provides it to the consumer.
\- The consumer i.e. NEF decides to create/update/delete PFD associated with
an application ID to enable the detection of application traffic in the future
(out of scope).
### 6.9.2 Input Data
NWDAF collects QoS flow related data from SMF for a specific S-NSSAI, DNN, and
UE. The detailed data are described in Table 6.9.2-1.
Table 6.9.2-1: Input data to detect known application from NFs

NOTE 1: Extensive reporting of all traffic flows may conflict with requirement
to avoid extra UPF load in the key issue. An NWDAF may subscribe only for
reporting for some UEs to limit the load.
NOTE 2: The current Packet delay detection and reporting in R17at UPF is only
supported for URLLC.
NOTE 3 _:_ How NWDAF collects the UL/DL Packet Delay from UPF (e.g.
subscription via SMF) will be defined in FS_UPEAS.
### 6.9.3 Output Analytics
The output analytics of NWDAF is defined in Table 6.9.3-1.
The output analysis can be used to provision new PFDs for known applications.
Table 6.9.3-1: Output for known application detection
Information Description
* * *
Application ID Application ID of the application that refers to the
application detection filter (Flow descriptor, URL or Domain name information)
stored in the UDR. S-NSSAI Identifies the Network Slice for which analytics
information is provided. DNN Identifies the data network name (e.g. internet)
for which analytics information is provided. Flow descriptor Flow descriptor
containing 3-tuple, server side (destination address, port, and protocol). URL
the significant parts of the URL to be matched, e.g. host name defined in.
Domain name information a Domain name matching criteria and information about
applicable protocol(s).
### 6.9.4 Procedures
The procedure depicted in 6.9.4-1 shows known application detection analytics.
Figure 6.9.4-1: A procedure to extract application characteristics
1\. The NEF(PFDF) as consumer NF subscribes to the NWDAF to request analytics
for application detection (or via the NEF in untrusted domain). This
subscription maybe is triggered by local configuration or OAM. The Analytics
Filter Information may optionally include the UE ID, S-NSSAI and/or DNN,
Application ID.
2\. NWDAF performs user consent check with UDM to determine if the analytics
procedure is allowed or not.
3\. The NWDAF fetches currently stored PFD information in use from UDR via
NEF(PFDF).
4\. The NWDAF collects session related information from the UPF about URL,
Domain name part, and IP 3-tuples of packets corresponding to Application ID
from the SDF not matching installed PDRs.
5\. The NWDAF derives PFD analytics.
6\. The NWDAF notifies the analytics consumer NF with observed PFD
Information. Based on the observed PFD information provided by the NWDAF, the
consumer determines to create/update/delete PFDs information and if needed
send request to the NEF(PFDF) by invoking the
Nnef_PFDManagement_Create/Update/Delete service containing Application
Identifier and one or more sets of PFDs, and step 1-5 defined in clause 4.18.2
in TS 23.502 [3] are executed.
7\. The NEF (PFDF) fetches the PFD information currently in use from UDR.
8\. The NEF (PFDF) compares the PDF information from UDR with PFD information
from the NWDAF to determine whether to create/update/delete PFD information
corresponding to the application ID.
9\. The NEF (PFDF) invokes the Nudr_DM_Create/Update/Delete (Application
Identifier, one or more sets of PFDs) to the UDR to create/update/delete PFD
information corresponding to the application ID, i.e. steps 3-5 defined in
clause 4.18.2 of TS 23.502 [3] are executed.
### 6.9.5 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NWDAF:
\- Needs to provide a new analytic for application detection information.
\- Needs to process user plane data for extracting traffic characteristics.
\- Needs to be able to filter and name the applications detected based on the
\"Application Characteristics\" filter.
UPF:
\- Needs to report URL, Domain name part, and IP 3-tuples of packets from
unknown application to NWDAF.
\- Needs to provide requested sessions statistics including data volume, data
duration, QoS flow bit rate and packet transmission.
NEF(PFDF):
\- Supports to consume new PFD information from NWDAF.
\- Supports to determine to create/update/delete PFD information and send
request to UDR.
## 6.10 Solution #10: Support for Data and Analytics Exchange in Roaming Case
### 6.10.1 Description
When two VPLMN and HPLMN expose data or analytics to each other, both PLMNs
need the ability to control the amount of data exposed and to abstract or hide
network-internal aspects based on user consent, operator policy, regulatory
constraints and/or roaming agreements.
The solution following the following assumptions and principles:
\- The hPLMN may impose constraints on the type or amount of data collected.
The constraints may differ for different vPLMNs.
\- The vPLMN may impose constraints on the type or amount of data collected.
The constraints may differ for different hPLMNs.
\- The data collection must honour user data consent for user related data
collection.
The solution proposes a Gateway Exposure Function (GEF) in a PLMN, which is
responsible for data/analytics exposure to other PLMNs. The GEF is provisioned
with constraints on the type and amount of data exposed to each PLMN according
to roaming agreement. The GEF is also responsible for enforcing obtaining the
user consent for data collection where applicable.
When a data/analytics consumer in PLMN A (vPLMN/hPLMN) needs to collect
data/analytics from PLMN B (hPLMN/vPLMN), the consumer contacts the GEF in
PLMN A, then GEF in PLMN A contacts GEF in PLMN B, or the consumer contacts
the GEF in PLMN B directly. The GEF in PLMN B discovers the data/analytics
producer in PLMN B and collects the data/analytics. GEF is also responsible
for data/analytics manipulation before sending to the other PLMN according to
the regulatory constraints and agreement.
NOTE: Whether GEF is a standalone NF will be determined as part of the
evaluation.
### 6.10.2 Procedures
Figure 6.10.2-1: Data and Analytics Exposure via GEF when data/analytcis
consumer is in vPLMN
Figure 6.10.2-1 shows the procedure when the data/analytics consumer is in the
visiting PLMN (vPLMN), the NWDAF in the visiting PLMN (vNWDAF) needs to
collect data/analytics from home PLMN (hPLMN) of the UE.
NOTE: The UE can be one single UE, group of UE or any UE roaming to the VPLMN
from the HPLMN.
It is assumed that both vGEF and hGEF have been provisioned, by their
respective operators, with the policies and constraints for exporting data to
or from roaming/home networks.
0\. GEF is registered itself in the NRF. The GEF profile may include a type to
indicate data collection or analytics exposure.
1-2. The analytics consumer in the vPLMN (e.g. an AMF) wants to subscribe an
Analytics for an inbound roaming UE, the vNWDAF determines that it needs to
collect data/analytics from hPLMN of the UE. For example, the data to be
collected might be related to expected UE behaviour. The analytics consumer
and vNWDAF obtain the hPLMN ID from the SUPI of the UE. In the analytics
request in step 1, the analytics consumer may provide indication to the
vNWDAF, that the analytics needs data from hPLMN of the UE, or the vNWDAF can
determine that based on the Analytics ID.
There are 3 options to establish the connection between the vPLMN and HPLMN.
**Option A:**
3\. vNWDAF discovers vGEF via vNRF. vNRF provides the ID of vGEF that is
responsible for collecting data/analytics from that PLMN.
4\. vNWDAF sends data/analytics subscription request to the vGEF. Similar
services as Data management and analytics exposure service of NWDAF (defined
in clauses 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 of TS 23.288 [5]) can be defined as the data and
analytics subscription services provided by the GEF.
5\. vGEF discovers hGEF via vNRF and hNRF. vGEF provides HPLMN ID to vNRF.
vNRF interacts with hNRF via N27 reference point as defined in TS 23.501 [2].
6\. vGEF send data/analytics subscription request to the hGEF which is got in
step 5. hGEF checks roaming agreements, hPLMN policies and regulatory
constraints between hPLMN and the origin vPLMN to determine if the request can
be accepted or must be rejected.
**Option B:**
3\. vNWDAF discovers vGEF via vNRF. vNRF provides the ID of vGEF that is
responsible for collecting data/analytics from that PLMN.
4\. vNWDAF discovers hGEF via vNRF and hNRF taking into account the home PLMN
ID and the request data or analytics exposure. The hNRF returns the ID of hGEF
to the vNWDAF.
5\. vNWDAF sends data/analytics subscription request to the vGEF. The vNWDAF
sends the ID of hGEF to the vGEF.
6\. vGEF send data/analytics subscription request to the hGEF. hGEF checks
roaming agreements, hPLMN policies and regulatory constraints between hPLMN
and the origin vPLMN to determine if the request can be accepted or must be
rejected.
**Option C:**
3\. vNWDAF discovers hGEF via vNRF and hNRF taking into account the home PLMN
ID and the request data or analytics exposure. hNRF provides the ID of hGEF
that is responsible for collecting data/analytics from that PLMN to vNWDAF via
vNRF.
4\. vNWDAF sends data/analytics subscription request to the hGEF. hGEF checks
roaming agreements, hPLMN policies and regulatory constraints between hPLMN
and the origin vPLMN to determine if the request can be accepted or must be
rejected.
NOTE: Which option(s) to be supported will be determined in the conclusion
phase.
7-8. If the checks in step 6 is OK, hGEF enforces user consent (for UE-related
data collection) and collects data/analytics from the data/analytics sources
in the hPLMN.
9\. hGEF manipulates the data/analytics according to the hPLMN policies and
regulatory constraints and roaming agreements, e.g. remove some sensitive
data, changes the granularity of the data, anonymization, formatting, etc.
10-11. hGEF sends the data/analytics to vGEF and vGEF forwards to vNWDAF. vGEF
may also manipulate the data/analytics to the format that the vNWDAF can
understand.
12\. Alternatively, hGEF can send the data/analytics notification directly to
the vNWDAF, if vGEF provides notification endpoint information of the vNWDAF
in step 6.
When the analytics/data consumer is located in hPLMN, and the UE is roaming,
the procedure shown in figure 6.10.2-2 applies instead. The difference from in
figure 6.10.2-1 is step 3, which is now split into steps 3a and 3b. In step 3a
the hNWDAF enforces the user consent with the hUDM. In step 3b the hNWDAF
queries hUDM for retrieving the GUAMI of the AMF that is serving the user.
This GUAMI contains the PLMN ID of the AMF, therefore, it can be used for
determining whether the UE is roaming or not.
Figure 6.10.2-2: Data and Analytics Exposure via GEF when data/analytics
consumer is in hPLMN
### 6.10.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
\- New NF, i.e. GEF, needs to be specified.
## 6.11 Solution #11: PDU session management in roaming scenarios using
network analytics
### 6.11.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #3: \"Data and analytics exchange in roaming
case\".
PDU Session management in roaming scenarios can be improved using the data and
analytics information exchange between HPLMN and VPLMN.
As specified in TS 23.502 [3], in the case of roaming, the AMF in the VPLMN
determines if a PDU Session is to be established in LBO or Home Routing. For
Home Routing, if the UE does not include an S-NSSAI in the PDU Session
request, both a Serving PLMN S-NSSAI (in the Allowed NSSAI) and its
corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAI values are selected by the AMF. Also, the AMF
selects both an SMF in the Serving PLMN using the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN
mapping to the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN used for the PDU Session, and,
additionally an SMF in the HPLMN using the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN used for the
PDU Session. Here the selection of Network Slices (i.e. Serving PLMN S-NSSAI
and its corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAI) and selection of SMFs (i.e. V-SMF and
H-SMF) should take into account the status of Network Slices / NFs in both
VPLMN and HPLMN. Therefore, analytics in HPLMN (i.e. Network Slice load level,
NF load, etc.) can be sent to the VPLMN and used by the AMF in VPLMN for
Network Slice and H-SMF selection for Home Routed PDU Session establishment.
### 6.11.2 Procedures
Figure 6.11.2-1 shows the procedure that V-NWDAF requests the Network Slice
load level analytics in HPLMN from H-NWDAF, upon receiving an analytics
information/subscription request from the AMF.
Figure 6.11.2-1: Procedure for providing HPLMN load level analytics to VPLMN
1\. AMF sends an Analytics request/subscribe (Analytics ID = Load level
information, Analytics Filter Information = (VPLMN S-NSSAI, HPLMN S-NSSAI,
HPLMN ID)) to V-NWDAF by invoking a Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request or a
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe.
2\. V-NWDAF invokes Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request (Expected Service Name =
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo (or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription), NF type of the
expected NF = NWDAF, Analytics ID = Load level information, HPLMN ID, VPLMN
ID, VPLMN S-NSSAI, HPLMN S-NSSAI, NF type of the NF service consumer = NWDAF)
to an appropriate configured NRF in the VPLMN, and discovers the H-NWDAF using
the procedure as described in clause 4.17.5 of TS 23.502 [3]. V-NWDAF sends an
Analytics request/subscribe (Analytics ID = Load level information, Analytics
Filter Information = HPLMN S-NSSAI) to H-NWDAF by invoking a
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request or a Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe,
based on the Analytics request/subscribe received from the AMF.
3-5. H-NWDAF collects data from the NF(s) and/or OAM in HPLMN and derives the
requested Network Slice / Network Slice instance load analytics information
for the Network Slice identified by HPLMN S-NSSAI, as specified in clause 6.3
of TS 23.288 [5].
6\. H-NWDAF sends the HPLMN Network Slice / Network Slice instance load
analytics information to the V-NWDAF using either Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request
response or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify.
7-9. V-NWDAF collects data from the NF(s) and/or OAM in VPLMN and derives the
requested Network Slice / Network Slice instance load analytics information
for the Network Slice identified by VPLMN S-NSSAI, as specified in clause 6.3
of TS 23.288 [5]. These steps can be executed in parallel with step 3-6.
10\. V-NWDAF sends the HPLMN analytics information received in step 6,
together with the VPLMN analytics information derived in step 9, to the AMF
using either Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify.
The AMF can use the HPLMN and VPLMN analytics information for Home Routed PDU
Session establishment, as follows:
\- base on the HPLMN and VPLMN analytics information on Network Slice load,
the AMF selects the Network Slices (i.e. VPLMN S-NSSAI and its mapped HPLMN
S-NSSAI), and also the Network Slice instances in HPLMN and VPLMN if multiple
VPLMN NSI IDs and/or HPLMN NSI IDs are available (e.g. received from the NSSF
previously or configured) in the AMF for the selected Network Slices.
\- further, based on the HPLMN and VPLMN analytics information, e.g. the
resource usage information in the Network Slice load analytics, or NF load
analytics (using procedures similar to the above), the AMF selects an H-SMF in
the selected Network Slice or Network Slice instance (if available) in the
HPLMN, and a V-SMF in the selected Network Slice or Network Slice instance (if
available) in the VPLMN, among the set of the SMF instance(s) returned by the
NRF (as described in clause 4.3.2.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3]) or locally configured
in the AMF.
### 6.11.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
AMF: based on HPLMN and VPLMN analytics information, selects Network Slices
and Network Slice instances (if available) in HPLMN and VPLMN, and selects the
SMFs (i.e. V-SMF and H-SMF), for Home Routed PDU Session establishment in
roaming scenarios.
V-NWDAF: requests HPLMN analytics information from the H-NWDAF.
H-NWDAF: provides HPLMN analytics information to the V-NWDAF.
## 6.12 Solution #12: DCCF and MFAF Relocation
### 6.12.1 Description
In scenarios where multiple DCCF and/or MFAF instances are deployed in the
same network, there are some cases that the serving DCCF and/or MFAF may need
to be changed, such as when a UE moves (e.g. due to idle mode mobility or a
handover), the data or analytics source may change (e.g.: a new NWDAF, a new
AMF, a new SMF). The new data source may not be in the area served by the
current DCCF and/or the current MFAF. This solution proposes a way to change
the DCCF and/or MFAF upon data source or analytics source change so the
serving areas of the DCCF/MFAF and data source remain aligned.
The DCCF and MFAF relocation comprises the following steps:
\- When a DCCF coordinates data or analytics collection for a UE or a group of
UEs, the DCCF subscribes to event notifications for UE mobility to outside of
the serving area of the DCCF (for example area of interest as specified in
clause 4.15.4.2 of TS 23.502 [3]). If an MFAF is used, the DCCF also
subscribes to receive notifications of UE mobility to outside of the serving
area of the selected MFAF.
\- When a DCCF coordinating data or analytics collection receives a mobility
event notification:
\- It determines if the UE is still within the current DCCF serving area. If
not, it determines a new DCCF (e.g. by querying the NRF). It then interacts
with the new DCCF to transfer the UE DCCF context for the UE.
\- If an MFAF is used, the DCCF determines if the UE is within the current
MFAF serving area. If not, it determines a new MFAF (e.g. by querying the
NRF). The DCCF then interacts with the new MFAF to initiate a UE MFAF context
transfer from the old MFAF or to establish a new UE MFAF context.
\- If there is a new MFAF or if there is a new DCCF and an MFAF is not used,
the DCCF updates the Data Source with the new Notification Endpoint address.
Subsequently, the data source sends notifications to the new DCCF or new MFAF.
MFAF UE Context information transferred or setup in the new MFAF may include
information from on-going processing, such as buffered notifications and
processed data, and configuration information such as Formatting Instructions,
Processing Instructions, Data Consumer or Analytics Consumer information and
MFAF notification information as described in clause 9.2.2 of TS 23.288 [5].
DCCF UE Context information transferred to the new DCCF may include
information from on-going processing, such as buffered notifications and
processed data, and configuration information such as Service Operation,
Analytics or Data Specification, Time Window, Formatting Instructions,
Processing Instructions, Data Consumer or Analytics Consumer information and
DCCF notification information as described in clause 8.2.2 of TS 23.288 [5].
### 6.12.2 Procedures
Upon change of a source DCCF and/or MFAF instance, it is required to inform
the related consumer of the event and possibly to update subscriptions between
the DCCF and the consumer. The subscriptions can be renewed between the target
DCCF instance and the consumer.
Figure 6.12.2-1: DCCF and/or MFAF Context Transfer
Figure 6.12.2-1 illustrates the procedure for DCCF and/or MFAF Context
Transfer.
0\. A consumer NF subscribes to DCCF Data Management services. The consumer
NFsets to \"False\" the \"No relocation\" indicator in the subscription
request.
NOTE: The \"No relocation\" indicator is used by DCCF to determine whether to
execute the relocation procedure (No Relocation set to \"False\") or not (No
Relocation set to \"True\").
1\. AMF sends DCCF-1 a notification indicating that the UE is in a new area of
interest.
2\. DCCF-1 determines that the UE is no longer in the area served by the
DCCF-1 or in the area served by the MFAF-1.
3\. DCCF-1 may query the NRF to discover a DCCF and/or MFAF that can serve the
UE in its new location. In the case of data subscriptions from multiple DCCFs,
the DCCF-1 may preferably select a target DCCF that is already serving the
consumer.
4\. If DCCF-1 determined in step 2 that it is no longer in the serving area of
the UE, it selects a new DCCF (DCCF-2) to serve the UE. If the DCCF determined
in step 2 that MFAF-1 is no longer in the serving area of the UE, it selects a
new MFAF (MFAF-2) to serve the UE.
5\. If a new MFAF (MFAF-2) is selected, DCCF-1 sends a message to MFAF-2
requesting MFAF-2 to become the new MFAF and to retrieve the MFAF UE context
from MFAF-1.
6\. If MFAF-2 receives the message in step 5, it retrieves the UE context from
MFAF-1.
7\. MFAF-1 forwards to MFAF-2, notifications related to the UE (where
formatting and processing may be performed by MFAF-2).
8\. MFAF-2 indicates to DCCF-1 that MFAF UE context transfer/setup is complete
and provides MFAF-2 Notification Endpoint information to the DCCF-1.
9\. If a new DCCF (DCCF-2) is selected in step 4, DCCF-1 sends a message to
DCCF-2 requesting DCCF-2 to become the new DCCF. If DCCF-2 accepts the
transfer request:
a. DCCF-2 retrieves the UE Context from DCCF-1.
b. If an MFAF is used, DCCF-1 indicates to DCCF-2 the MFAF (MFAF-1 or MFAF-2).
c. If an MFAF is not used, DCCF-2 provides DCCF-2 Notification Endpoint
information in the response to DCCF-1.
d. DCCF-1 and DCCF-2 determine whether subscriptions to Data Sources need to
be updated.
NOTE 1: As in clause 5A.2, each Data Source NF or Set of Data Source NF should
be associated with only one DCCF instance or DCCF Set. Therefore based on the
subscription information for the UE provided by DCCF-1, DCCF-2 should select a
new Data Source NF and inform DCCF-1.
e. DCCF-2 confirms the context transfer from the DCCF-1.
10\. If a new DCCF (DCCF-2) is selected in step 4, DCCF-2 informs the MFAF
(MFAF-1 or MFAF-2) that DCCF 2 is now the DCCF for the UE.
11\. If the DCCF has not changed, DCCF-1 informs the Data Source of the MFAF
(MFAF-2) notification endpoint information (either via update of a
subscription to the existing data source or via a new subscription to a new
data source if selected by DCCF-1). Notifications are subsequently sent from
the Data Source to MFAF-2.
12\. If the DCCF has changed, DCCF-2 updates/subscribes to the Data Source,

registration and discovery in 5GC
### 6.13.1 Description
This solution addresses KI#5: Enhance trained ML Model sharing.
The solution is based on the existing NWDAF discovery and selection as defined
in TS 23.288 [5].
To discover an NWDAF containing MTLF via NRF by NWDAF containing AnLF
belonging to a different vendor:
\- An NWDAF containing MTLF shall include ML model file serialization format
supported in the ML model filter information for the trained ML model per
Analytics ID(s).
\- During the discovery of NWDAF containing MTLF a consumer (i.e. an NWDAF
containing AnLF) may include in the request ML model file serialization format
supported per Analytics ID(s). The NRF returns one or more candidate for
instances of NWDAF containing MTLF with the ML model file serialization format
supported for the trained ML model per Analytics ID (s) as indicated by the NF
consumer.
### 6.13.2 Procedures
Figure 6.13.2-1: NWDAF containing MTLF discovery and selection via NRF by
NWDAF containing AnLF belonging to different vendors
NOTE: The procedure described in this clause is based on the NWDAF discovery
and selection as defined in TS 23.288 [5].
Editor\'s note: How ML model privacy is supported when NWDAF containing MTLF
and NWDAF containing AnLF belong to different vendors is in scope of SA WG3.
Editor\'s note: Whether any other parameters apart from ML model file
serialization format needs to be considered to support interoperability
between NWDAF containing AnLF and NWDAF containing MTLF belonging to different
vendors is for FFS.
An NWDAF containing MTLF shall send Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister request which
include ML model file serialization format supported in the ML model filter
information for the trained ML model per Analytics ID(s). The ML model file
serialization format(s) included in the ML model Filter information indicates
the supported ML model file serialization format(s) for the trained ML
model(s) available at the NWDAF containing MTLF for the service consumer.
During the discovery of NWDAF containing MTLF a consumer (i.e. an NWDAF
containing AnLF) may include in the request ML model file serialization format
supported per Analytics ID(s) by the NWDAF containing AnLF.
The NRF returns one or more candidate for instances of NWDAF containing MTLF
to the NF consumer and each candidate for instance of NWDAF with the ML model
file serialization format supported for the trained ML model per Analytics ID
(s) as indicated by the NWDAF containing AnLF.
The NWDAF containing AnLF subscribes to a (set of) trained ML Model(s)
associated with a (set of) Analytics ID(s) by invoking the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe service operation. The NWDAF service
consumer includes the ML model file serialization format supported as input in
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe service operation.
The NWDAF containing MTLF notifies the NWDAF service consumer with the trained
ML Model Information (containing (set of) file address of the trained ML
model) by invoking Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation. The
content of trained ML Model Information that can be provided by the NWDAF
containing MTLF is specified in clause 6.2A.2 of TS 23.288 [5].
## 6.14 Solution #14: Enhance trained ML Model sharing via ML Model format
### 6.14.1 Description
This is a solution for the Key Issue#5: Enhance trained ML Model sharing.
#### 6.14.1.1 General
As shown in Figure1, ML model(s) is trained and inferred based on some
specific AI framework (e.g. TensorFlow, Pytorch, Caffe, etc.) and it cannot be
understood and used by other AI frameworks because the properties of each AI
framework (e.g. Network topology, Execution flow, Data format, Supporting
language) are different.
Figure 6.14.1.1-1: Problem of ML model(s) sharing between different AI
Frameworks
As shown in Figure 6.14.1.1-2, it is proposed to enhance ML model sharing
between different AI Frameworks via ML model Format such as ONNX (Open Neuro
Network Exchange), which is an open format built to represent machine learning
models. ONNX defines a common set of operators - the building blocks of
machine learning and deep learning models - and a common file format to enable
AI developers to use models with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and
compilers, for example:
1). For a NWDAF (containing MTLF) with TensorFlow AI framework, it only needs
to convert a TensorFlow specific ML Mode file to an open ONNX ML Model file,
which can be consumed by any NWDAF(AnLF) who supports open ONNX ML Model.
2). For a NWDAF (containing AnLF) who supports open ONNX ML Model, it
interacts with the NWDAF (containing MTLF) to retrieve the open ONNX ML Model
file, which will be converted by NWDAF (containing AnLF) to Caffe specific ML
Model file.
Editor\'s note: ONNX is just an example of format for ML model, and which open
format for ML Model and the associated software support for the ML model is
used is FFS.
Figure 6.14.1.1-2: Open ML model Format to support ML model sharing
NOTE: In addition, MPEG and JVET is studying how to use AI/ML model for video
coding, where AI/ML model sharing between different companies has been
conducted for video coding evaluation and crosscheck purposes:
\- Observations from JVET shows that conversion to/from ONNX can be done from
various framework.
\- It was agreed to use ONNX format for model description for companies\'
evaluation of model performance.
\- Please refer to [https://jvet-experts.org/]{.underline} for detailed
information.
#### 6.14.1.2 Registration and discovery of NWDAF (containing MTLF) with ML
model Format Information
Figure 6.14.1.2-1: Registration and discovery for NWDAF(MTLF) with open ML
model Format
1-3. The NWDAF (containing MTLF) registers its NF profile (Address of NWDAF
(containing MTLF), Supported Analytics ID, Supported ML Model Format
Information, Supported AI Framework Information) into NRF.
The Supported ML Model Format Information indicates which ML Model Format is
supported. For example, the trained ML Mode by the NWDAF (containing MTLF) can
be converted to an ONNX ML Model file.
The Supported AI Framework Information indicates which AI Framework (e.g.
Tensor Flow, Pythorch, Caffe) is used to train the ML Model.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS how to protect the ML model privacy in the MTLF, if
the AnLF and the MTLF belongs to different vendors and coordination with SA3
is needed.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS on what model metadata should be included in the
model sharing procedure.
4-6. The NWDAF (containing AnLF) is to discover multiple NWDAFs (containing
MTLF) via the NRF by invoking the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request (Analytics ID, ML
Model Format Information, AI Framework Information) service operation.
The NRF notifies the NWDAF (containing AnLF) with one or more NWDAF
(containing MTLF) instances.
7\. The NWDAF (containing AnLF) selects a NWDAF (containing MTLF) and then
subscribes to the chosen NWDAF (containing MTLF1) a trained ML Model by
invoking the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision (Analytics ID, ML Model Format
Information, AI Framework Information) service operation.
8\. The chosen NWDAF (containing MTLF1) notifies the NWDAF (containing AnLF)
with the ML model information by invoking Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify
service operation.
The ML model Information includes either an ML Model file (e.g. an open ONNX
ML Model file) or a specific AI Framework ML Model file (e.g. a TensorFlow
specific ML Model file), respectively.
### 6.14.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NWDAF(MTLF):
\- register \"Supported ML Model Format Information, Supported AI Framework
Information\" in NF profile to NRF.
\- provide ML Model Information per Supported ML Model Format
Information/Supported AI Framework Information as indicated in
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision.
NRF:
\- support NWDAF(MTLF) discovery procedure per Supported ML Model Format
Information/Supported AI Framework Information.
## 6.15 Solution #15: ML model sharing with different AnLF providers
### 6.15.1 Description
In Rel-17, NWDAF decomposed into as described in TS 23.288 [5]:
\- Analytics logical function (AnLF): An NWDAF containing the Analytics
logical function can perform inference, derive analytics information and
expose analytics.
\- Model Training logical function (MTLF): An NWDAF containing the Model
Training logical function, trains ML models and exposes new training services.
But, even it has decomposed into two functions, the MTLF provides the ML model
to the AnLF of same provider as MTLF i.e. ML model will be share to the same
vendor AnLF, but not other vendor AnLF, see the below note from clause 5.1 of
TS 23.288 [5].
_NOTE 3: In this Release of the specification an NWDAF containing AnLF is
locally configured with (a set of) IDs of NWDAFs containing MTLF and the
Analytics ID(s) supported by each NWDAF containing MTLF to retrieve trained ML
models. An NWDAF containing AnLF uses NWDAF discovery for NWDAF containing
MTLF within the set of configured IDs of NWDAFs containing MTLF, if necessary.
ML Model provisioning/sharing between multiple MTLFs is not supported in this
Release of the specification._
Therefore, based on the KI#5, in this solution, it is assumed that based on
the business logic of the MTLF, the MTLF will determine whether to expose the
certain ML models to another provider\'s AnLF or not. For example, assume that
MTLF have two set of certain models, model#1 is developed based on publicly
available model and model#2 is develop based on business needs with high
accuracy level. In this case, MTLF provider is only ready to share the
model#1, but not model#2.
Based on the above assumption, this solution proposed that MTLF includes the
support of interoperable indicator in the NF profile for the NRF registration,
and the consumer (AnLF) discovers and selects the MTLF that is interoperable
for an analytic ID. Such Interoperable Indicator encodes the 3GPP-specific
Vendor Id (which is similar to the ViD as described in clause 23.3.2.3.1 of TS
23.003 [10]). Based on the interoperable indicator, the MTLF determine and
select the model, and then MTLF sends the model details to the AnLF. Based on
the local policy, if a MTLF does not support the model or does not want to
share it, the MTLF will send a rejection message, e.g. reject message with
that sharing the model is not possible for the analysis ID.
Thereby, two objectives are achieved:
a) AnLF when discovering MTLFs the returned list of MTLF instances can be
limited to those that allow sharing ML models to the AnLF instance.
b) MTLF when receiving a MLModelProvision request, can verify that the
requesting AnLF instance is allowed to retrieve the ML model. Otherwise, it
can reject the request.
Furthermore, this solution also proposed that MTLF provide the accuracy level
and resource efficiency of the ML model to the AnLF. Similar to preferred
level of accuracy of the analytics, the MTLF determine the accuracy for the
trained model and required resource efficiency (e.g. required resource to run
the model).
### 6.15.2 Procedures
Figure 6.15.2-1: Procedure for sharing of ML model
0\. The MTLF registers its NF profile in the NRF as described in clause
5.2.7.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. Each MTFL NF profile therefore has included the
Interoperable Support Indicator, which indicates that the MTLF supports the
interoperable models and what are the corresponding interoperability
conditions, one of the conditions being a list of AnLF providers (vendors)
that are allowed to retrieve ML models from the MTLF.
1\. The AnLF discovers and selects the MTLF by local information or via from
NRF. During the discovery of MTLF via NRF, the NRF provides MTLF profiles to
the AnLF, the AnLF selects the MTLF that support the interoperability.
NOTE 1: It is possible that AnLF can explicitly query the NRF supporting the
interoperable MTLF by providing an Interoperable Support Indicator in the
discovery request. At a minimum, the NRF discovery allows to query only those
MTLFs where the requesting AnLF provider (vendor) is allowed to retrieve ML
models from.
2\. The AnLF sends the Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request or
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Request to the MTLF with an analytic ID and ML model
filter information.
NOTE 2: It is up to stage 3 and/or SA3 to define how to ensure that MTLF
receives information (e.g. vendor ID) to determine whether the ML model can be
provided to the requesting AnLF. For example, using the Vendor ID data type as
defined in TS 29.510 [11] or completely new format.
NOTE 3: How MTLF verifies that vendor information of AnLF as provided by AnLF
in the Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request or Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Request service
requests is correct, i.e. matching the actual AnLF vendor, is for SA WG3 to
solve.
3\. MTLF determine the AnLF service provider and determine whether to expose
the model or not. If yes, the MTLF selects the ML Model. If not, MTLF will
reject the request and return a corresponding error message.
4\. The MTLF sends the ML models details to the AnLF in the
Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request or Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Request response. In the
response, the MTLF includes the ML model accuracy level and resource
efficiency level to the AnLF.
NOTE 4: It could be that AnLF can explicitly ask preferred level of ML model
accuracy and resource efficiency in step 2. The accuracy and resource
efficiency level can be \"low\", \"medium\" and \"high\".
### 6.15.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
AnLF able to select the MTLF which support the interoperability, i.e. can
provide a ML model to the AnLF. Furthermore, AnLF includes access information
(encoding the 3GPP-specific Vendor Id) in the Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request and
Nwdaf_MLModelProvision_Request.
MTLF registers the support of interoperability with the NRF such as
Interoperable Support Indicator in the NF profile (e.g. NFProfile in NRF is
extended to include a list of AnLF providers (vendors) that can access the
MLModelProvision service).
MTLF when receiving a Nwdaf_MLModelProvision or Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo request
will determine the AnLF vendor information from the request message to
determine if the ML model can be shared with the AnLF.
Furthermore, MTLF can provide the ML model accuracy and resource efficiency
levels. Based on internal policy, the MTLF select the model and provide it to
the AnLF.
NRF stores and filter MTLFs that support interoperability and, as a response
to the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request provide the filtered list of MTLF instances to
the AnLF.
## 6.16 Solution #16: NWDAF assisted URSP determination
### 6.16.1 Description
This solution is proposed to address Key Issue #6: NWDAF-assisted URSP.
A URSP rule consists of traffic descriptor and route selection descriptor.
Traffic descriptor is determined e.g. by application guidance from AF and is
relatively fixed, which may not need analytics from NWDAF. This solution
mainly proposes the existing analytics and enhanced analytics from NWDAF to
assist to adjust the route selection descriptor and the related components of
route selection descriptors can be reflected by Analytics ID(s). And the
mapping between RSD components and output from Analytics IDs are showed in
Table 6.16.1-1.
Table 6.16.1-1: NWDAF assisted URSP determination
Route selection components Analytics ID(s)
* * *
Network Slice Selection \"Service Experience\", \"Load level information\",

validation criteria Analytics ID(s) Time Window Based on the validity period
and spatial validity provided in the Analytics ID used for RSD generation.
Location Criteria Based on the validity period and spatial validity provided
in the Analytics ID used for RSD generation.
The PCF generates a URSP Rule based on the Service Parameters provided by the
AF, or alternatively locally configured in the PCF or both, then the PCF
checks that the RSC of the URSP Rule complies with the UE context Policy
control subscription information for a SUPI. Then, the PCF checks if Analytics
are needed for further refinement of the candidate values.
In this solution, the PCF is configured, depending on operator policies, to
subscribe to those Analytics ID(s) listed in the Table 6.16.1-1, then output
of these Analytics are used to:
\- determine if traffic of the application is to be offloaded outside the PDU
Session.
\- prioritize (or remove some of) the list of candidate values for the Network
Slice Selection component or for the DNN Selection component.
\- allocate the SSC Mode value, and the PDU Session Type.
\- select the preferred Access Type.
\- determine if PDU Session Pair ID and/or RSN needs to be provided.
These are some examples of how the PCF assigns the values of the different
Route Selection Components:
**Network Slice Selection:** PCF can request or subscribe to:
\- Analytics ID \"Service Experience\" for a particular application that is
part of the traffic descriptor, via the candidate network slices by setting
filter information. The PCF may select or prioritize the network slice that
provides the best service experience for the application.
\- Analytics ID \"Load Level Information\" for the candidate network slices
and select the one with lowest load.
\- Analytics ID \"Dispersion Analytics\" to get, e.g. Data volume dispersion
Analytics type. The PCF may calculate the average data rate in the network
slice by subscribing to notifications of network analytics related to Data
Volume Dispersion in the network slice for a duration of interest when it sets
the Target of Analytics Reporting as \"any UE\". The PCF may update URSP on
slice selection policy for the associated UEs based on the data volume
dispersion analytics results provided by the NWDAF for data volume dispersion
statistics at a given slice and/or data volume dispersion predictions at a
given slice.
\- Analytics ID \"Session Management Congestion Control Experience\" for the
PDU Session associated with the candidate S-NSSAI indicated by Analytics
Filter Information, targeting the SUPI as Target of Analytics Reporting. The
PCF may select or prioritize the S-NSSAI that provides the lowest experience
level of Session Management Congestion Control for the SUPI.
\- Both, first the list of candidate slices and the service experience it
provides for the application is provided and then the load level for those
slices are checked.
\- Or just subscribe to Analytics ID \"Service Experience\" for a particular
application, for slices that are not heavy loaded.
\- Or just to subscribe to Analytics ID \"Dispersion Analytics\" as explained
above for certain slice(s).
**DNN Selection:** Similar to the first bullet, The PCF may subscribe to
Analytics ID on \"Service Experience\" for a particular application that is
part of the traffic descriptor, via the candidate DNNs. The PCF may select or
prioritize some of the DNN that provides the best service experience for the
application.
The PCF may also subscribe to notifications of network analytics related to
\"UE Communication\". The PCF may update the URSP on DNN selection policy for
the associated SUPI, group of UEs or UEs associated with the Application
Identifier based on this notification from NWDAF (e.g. considering DNN in
Traffic characterization and associated Traffic Volume, Spatial validity and
inactivity time) . The PCF may subscribe to Analytics ID \"Session Management
Congestion Control Experience\" for the PDU Session associated with the
candidate DNN indicated by Analytics Filter Information, targeting the SUPI as
Target of Analytics Reporting. The PCF may select or prioritize the DNN that
provides the lowest experience level of Session Management Congestion Control
for the SUPI.
**Non-Seamless Offload indication:** PCF can request or subscribe \"UE
Communication\" to get information on the location where UE will use the
application and then get the information about the WLAN performance of this
location by requesting or subscribing the Analytics ID \"WLAN performance\".
If the WLAN performance is good enough, PCF may choose to configure this
indication for the application in that area to reduce the load of 3GPP access.
PCF may subscribe to notifications of network analytics related to \"Network
Performance\". The PCF may update this indication within URSP of the
associated UEs within the area of interest based on this notification from
NWDAF (e.g. on gNB status and gnB resource usage information). PCF may
subscribe to notifications of network analytics related to \"User Data
Congestion\". The PCF may update this indication within URSP of the associated
SUPI based on this notification from NWDAF (e.g. Network Status Indication).
**SSC Mode Selection, PDU Session Type and Access Type preference:** the PCF
may subscribe to Analytics ID on \"Service Experience\" for a particular
application that is part of the traffic descriptor, via the candidate SSC
mode, PDU Session Type and Access Type preference. The PCF may select the SSC
mode, PDU Session Type and Access Type preference that provides the best
service experience for the application. these factors should also be captured
by \"Service Experience\" Analytics. This solution enhanced the \"Service
Experience\" Analytics in clauses 6.16.1.1 and 6.16.1.2. **SSC Mode
Selection:** the PCF may subscribe to Analytics ID on \"Expected UE
behaviour\" for this SUPI. The PCF may select the SSC mode depending on the
mobility pattern (e.g. If no mobility then the SSC mode is not relevant and
can be omitted).
**PDU Session Pair ID and RSN:** PCF can request or subscribe to Analytics ID
\"Redundant Transmission Experience\" to be notified if PDU Session Pair ID
and/or RSN needs to be provided. If the output of the Analytics says
\"redundant transmission shall be performed\", the PCF may provide appropriate
PDU Session Pair ID and/or RSN with the help of local configuration in the
corresponding SMF. Details on how the SMF determines PDU Session Pair ID
and/or RSN can be found in clause 5.33.2.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
**Time Window and Location Criteria:** The Time Window in the RSD Validation
Criteria can be set based on the time validity period and spatial validity in
the Analytics ID(s) used as input in the RSD generation. The PCF may need to
select the validity period and spatial validity out of those provided in the
output of each Analytics ID(s).
The PCF can also subscribe or request analytics of combination of several RSCs
in one RSD in Analytic ID = Service Experience. This design enhances the input
parameters of the \"observed service experience\" analytics, including PDU
session type, SSC mode and etc.
The PCF can adjust the RSD precedence according to the analytic from NWDAF,
and also the PCF can receive the analytic of the whole RSD (if the combination
of RSCs are all of RSCs included in one RSD) or different arbitrary
combination of RSCs in URSP rule.
NOTE: For example, the combination of S-NSSAI + DNN or the combination of PDU
session type + SSC mode and etc. from NWDAF. The NWDAF should support to
provide the analytic of combination of several RSCs to PCF in Analytics ID =
Service Experience.
#### 6.16.1.1 Input Data
Based on input data of Observed Service Experience related network data
Analytics as described in clause 6.4.2 of TS 23.288 [5], table 6.16.1.1-1
provides enhanced input data by adding PDU Session related information and

\- Subscribes or requests Analytics ID (s) on Table 6.16.1-1 to provide the
guidance for URSP determination as described in clause 4.15.6.10 of TS 23.502
[3].
NWDAF:
\- supports enhanced Analytics ID \"Service Experience\" to provide the
analytic of whole RSD or arbitrary combination of RSCs.
SMF:
\- Nsmf_EventExposure, PDU Session Establishment and/or PDU Session Release is
extended to include the SSC mode per PDU Session.
## 6.17 Solution #17: NSSP in roaming scenarios using network analytics
### 6.17.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #3 \"Data and analytics exchange in roaming
case\" and key issue #6 \"NWDAF-assisted URSP\".
When the UE is roaming, the PCF in the HPLMN may update the NSSP as part of
the URSP rules in the UE. To decide the NSSP in roaming scenarios, the H-PCF
may take into account of the Network Slice status in VPLMN. Therefore,
analytics in VPLMN (i.e. Service Experience for an application and/or Network
Slice, Network Slice load level, etc.) can be sent to the HPLMN and used by
the H-PCF for decision of NSSP to be provisioned to the UE, so that the UE can
be instructed to transmit the application data over the PDU Session(s) in the
indicated VPLMN and/or HPLMN Network Slice(s) in roaming scenarios.
NOTE: FS_UEPO, key issue 1, aims to enable the provisioning of URSP rules in
the VPLMN and may thus remove the need for the H-PCF to determine NSSP.
### 6.17.2 Procedures
Figure 6.17.2-1 shows the procedure that H-NWDAF requests the Observed Service
Experience analytics in VPLMN from V-NWDAF, upon receiving an analytics
information/subscription request from the H-PCF.
Figure 6.17.2-1: Procedure for providing VPLMN Service Experience analytics to
HPLMN
1\. H-PCF sends an Analytics request/subscribe (Analytics ID = Service
Experience, Target of Analytics Reporting = a UE or a group of UEs or any UE,
Analytics Filter Information = (Application ID, HPLMN S-NSSAI, VPLMN S-NSSAI,
VPLMN ID)) to H-NWDAF by invoking a Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request or a
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe.
NOTE: Here the VPLMN S-NSSAI is used as an indication of request/subscription
to analytics information of the mapped Network Slice in the VPLMN, and its
value can be set to zero by the H-PCF.
2\. The H-NWDAF determines the VPLMN S-NSSAI, which is mapped to the HPLMN
S-NSSAI, and discovers the V-NWDAF. The H-NWDAF invokes the
Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation to the hNSSF with the HPLMN S-NSSAI
and VPLMN ID received in step 1, and receives the VPLMN S-NSSAI and the
information of appropriate vNRF to be used to select NFs/services within
VPLMN, which may be obtained by the hNSSF from the vNSSF, in the
Nnssf_NSSelection_Get response. The H-NWDAF further invokes the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request (Expected Service Name = Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo (or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription), NF type of the expected NF = NWDAF, Analytics
ID = Service Experience, HPLMN ID, VPLMN ID, VPLMN S-NSSAI, HPLMN S-NSSAI, NF
type of the NF service consumer = NWDAF) to the hNRF, and discovers the
V-NWDAF using the procedure as described in clause 4.17.5 of TS 23.502 [3].
H-NWDAF sends an Analytics request/subscribe (Analytics ID = Service
Experience, Analytics Filter Information = (Application ID, VPLMN S-NSSAI)) to
V-NWDAF by invoking a Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request or a
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe, based on the Analytics
request/subscribe received from the H-PCF.
3-5. V-NWDAF collects data from the NF(s) and/or OAM in VPLMN and derives the
requested Service Experience analytics information, as specified in clause 6.4
of TS 23.288 [5].
6\. V-NWDAF sends the VPLMN Service Experience analytics information to the
H-NWDAF using either Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify.
7-9. H-NWDAF collects data from the NF(s) and/or OAM in HPLMN and derives the
requested Service Experience analytics information, as specified in clause 6.4
of TS 23.288 [5]. These steps can be executed in parallel with step 3-6.
10\. H-NWDAF sends the VPLMN analytics information received in step 6,
together with the HPLMN analytics information derived in step 9, to the H-PCF
using either Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify.
When the UE is roaming, the PCF in the HPLMN may take into account of the
VPLMN Service Experience analytics information to update the NSSP (as part of
the URSP rules) in the UE, i.e. including the VPLMN S-NSSAI and/or HPLMN
S-NSSAI of the Network Slice(s) with better Service Experience for the
application, which instructs the UE to use the PDU Session in the Network
Slice(s) for transmission of the application.
### 6.17.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
PCF: based on HPLMN and VPLMN analytics information, updates the NSSP (as part
of the URSP rules) to the UE for the UE using the PDU Session in the indicated
Network Slice(s) to transmit the application in roaming scenarios.
H-NWDAF: requests VPLMN analytics information from the V-NWDAF.
V-NWDAF: provides VPLMN analytics information to the H-NWDAF.
## 6.18 Solution #18: Integrity KPI for QoS Sustainability Analytics
### 6.18.1 Key Issue mapping
This key issue addresses Key Issue#7 i.e. enhancements on QoS sustainability
analytics.
### 6.18.2 Description
In general, this solution proposes to use QoS sustainability analytics
solution which is defined in clause 6.9 of TS 23.288 [5] as baseline and add
new input and output parameters to meet 5GAA requirement. It is assumed to
reuse the same Analytics ID as defined Rel-17.
The consumer of QoS Sustainability analytics may request the NWDAF analytics
information regarding the QoS change statistics for an Analytics target period
in the past in a certain area or the likelihood of a QoS change for an
analytics target period in the future in a certain area **with finer
granularit** y i.e. below cell level.
The consumer can request either to subscribe to notifications (i.e. a
Subscribe-Notify model) or to a single notification (i.e. a Request-Response
model).
The service consumer may be a NF (e.g. AF).
The request includes the following parameters:
\- Analytics ID = \"QoS Sustainability \";
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: any UE;
\- Analytics Filter Information:
\- QoS requirements (mandatory):
\- 5QI (standardized or pre-configured), and applicable additional QoS
parameters and the corresponding values (conditional, i.e. it is needed for
GBR 5QIs to know the GFBR); or
\- the QoS Characteristics attributes including Resource Type, PDB, PER and
their values;
\- Location information (mandatory): an area or a path of interest. The
location information could reflect a list of waypoints;
NOTE: In this Release, the consumer of the \"QoS Sustainability\" Analytics ID
will provide location information in the area of interest format (TAIs or Cell
IDs) **and also location information below cell level** which are
understandable by NWDAF.
\- S-NSSAI (optional);
\- Optional maximum number of objects;
\- Analytics target period: relative time interval, either in the past or in
the future, that indicates the time period for which the QoS Sustainability
analytics is requested;
\- Reporting Threshold(s), which apply only for subscriptions and indicate
conditions on the level to be reached for the reporting of the analytics, i.e.
to discretize the output analytics and to trigger the notification when the
threshold(s) provided in the analytics subscription are crossed by the
expected QoS KPIs.
\- A matching direction may be provided such as crossed (default value),
below, or above.
\- An acceptable deviation from the threshold level in the non-critical
direction (i.e. in which the QoS is improving) may be set to limit the amount
of signalling.
The level(s) relate to value(s) of the QoS KPIs defined in TS 28.554 [9], for
the relevant 5QI:
\- for a 5QI of GBR resource type, the Reporting Threshold(s) refer to the QoS
flow Retainability KPI;
\- for a 5QI of non-GBR resource type, the Reporting Threshold(s) refer to the
RAN UE Throughput KPI.
**\- for any 5QI, the Reporting Threshold(s) refer to the Integrity KPI which
contains latency and delay of 5G networks as defined in TS 28.554 [9].**
\- In a subscription, the Notification Correlation Id and the Notification
Target Address.
The NWDAF collects the corresponding statistics information on the QoS **and
Integrity** KPI for the relevant 5QI of interests from the OAM, i.e. the QoS
flow retainability or the RAN UE Throughput as defined in TS 28.554 [9].
If the Analytics target period refers to the past:
\- The NWDAF verifies whether the triggering conditions for the notification
of QoS change statistics are met and if so, generates for the consumer one or
more notifications.
\- The analytics feedback contains the information on the location and the
time for the QoS change statistics and the Reporting Threshold(s) that were
crossed.
If the Analytics target period is in the future:
\- The NWDAF detects the need for notification about a potential QoS change
based on comparing the expected values for the KPI of the target 5QI against
the Reporting Threshold(s) provided by the consumer in any cell in the
requested area for the requested Analytics target period. The expected KPI
values are derived from the statistics for the 5QI obtained from OAM. OAM
information may also include planned or unplanned outages detection and other
information that is not in scope for 3GPP to discuss in detail.
\- The analytics feedback contains the information on the location and the
time when a potential QoS change may occur and what Reporting Threshold(s) may
be crossed.
### 6.18.3 Procedures
Figure 6.18.3-1 depicts a procedure for QoS Sustainability analytics provided
by NWDAF.
Figure 6.18.3-1: QoS Sustainability analytics provided by NWDAF
1\. The consumer requests or subscribes to analytics information on \"QoS
Sustainability\" provided by NWDAF. The parameters included in the request are
described in clause 6.9.1 of TS 23.288 [5].
The consumer may include multiple sets of parameters in order to provide
different combinations of \"Location information\" and \"Analytics target
period\" when requesting QoS Sustainability analytics.
2\. The NWDAF collects the data specified in clause 6.9.2 of TS 23.288 [5]
from the OAM, following the procedure captured in clause 6.2.3.2 of TS 23.288
[5].
3\. The NWDAF verifies whether the triggering conditions are met and derives
the requested analytics. The NWDAF can detect the need for notification based
on comparing the requested analytics of the target 5QI against the Reporting
Threshold(s) provided by consumer in any cell over the requested Analytics
target period.
4\. The NWDAF provides response or notification on \"QoS Sustainability\" to
the consumer.

in this solution but use other solutions e.g. based on output of KI#9.
#### 6.18.4.2 Output analytics
The NWDAF outputs the QoS Sustainability analytics. Depending on the Analytics
target period, the output consists of statistics or predictions. The detailed
information provided by the NWDAF is defined in Table 6.9.3-1 for statistics
and Table 6.9.3-2 for predictions.

the location information reflected a list of waypoints.
The number of QoS sustainability analytics entries is limited by the maximum
number of objects provided as part of Analytics Reporting Information.
## 6.19 Solution #19: Enhanced QoS Sustainability Analytics in the finer
granularity area
### 6.19.1 Description
QoS Sustainability analytics is an important analytics service, especially for
V2X-related or safety related applications, since it helps to handle the
impact of a sudden change of the QoS and thus avoid a harsh application
adjustment, which could affect safety and efficiency. However, there is the
need to enhance the granularity and the accuracy of the QoS Sustainability
analytics as well as to extend the QoS parameters that the QoS Sustainability
notification can be provided. The latter will help to increase the usefulness
of the specific analytics ID as well as to support the requirements of various
use cases (e.g. V2X related).
More accurate QoS Sustainability outputs needs QoS and input parameters to be
associated with more accurate location and speed information, when input
information is monitored at RAN. Also, the list of input features of the QoS
Sustainability analytics ID should be extended by adding information on radio
resource utilization and performance measurements for transfer over the UP to
improve the correctness and accuracy of QoS sustainability output. Finally,
NWDAF should also be able to collect - optionally - additional information on
the context that is related to those performance measurements when such
information is available, such as PEI, Subscriber category, Operating system
information, information on the serving UPF node. Different UPF nodes serving
the UE may be responsible for very different QoS, depending on the location of
the UPF node such as in edge deployments. PEI may also be used to retrieve
from services such as the GSMA database, additional information such as device
model, device manufacturer, IMEI or IMEISV or TAC range, supported frequency
bands, equipment type. Such additional information may be used by NWDAF to add
more information to the collected measurements and filter those measurements
that are applicable to the UE and subscription context for which analytics are
requested by the service consumer.
In order to produce more accurate analytics, the service consumer may provide
additional analytics filter information in the request of subscription, in
order to request analytics which better fit the conditions of selected UEs
instead of analytics that generically apply to a large number of UEs with
different context (e.g. type of construction, speed, etc.) . Such additional
analytics filter information may include one or more of the following: device
speed or speed range, serving UPF node information, Subscriber category (as in
clause 6.2.1.3 of TS 23.503 [4]), device model, device manufacturer, IMEI or
IMEISV or TAC range, supported frequency bands, equipment type.
Additional QoS parameters (delay, packet loss rate) should be considered by
the QoS Sustainability analytics and additional inputs for these QoS
parameters are needed as inputs to the QoS Sustainability analytics. Finally,
in the case that an area of interest is provided in the QoS Sustainability
request message by an analytics consumer then the necessary granularity of the
area of interest should be indicated.
The outputs of the QoS Sustainability analytics (statistics and predictions),
should be provided for more granular location, according to the request with
an area or a path of interest.
### 6.19.2 Procedures
#### 6.19.2.1 General
According to the description in clause 6.9 in TS 23.288 [5] the consumer of
QoS Sustainability analytics may request the NWDAF analytics information
regarding the QoS change statistics for an Analytics target period in the past
in a certain area or the likelihood of a QoS change for an Analytics target
period in the future in a certain area or path of interest, which is smaller
than a cell.
NOTE 1: In this Release of the specification, to derive the QoS Sustainability
analytics in a finer granularity AoI smaller than cell, the AF is required to
provide the requested AoI or requested path of interest, which is smaller than
cell.
The area is described in the request message (either of a Subscribe-Notify
model or of a Request-Response model) via Location information (mandatory):
\- a path of interest: The location information could reflect a list of
waypoints;
\- an area: The location information could reflect expected granularity levels
of the requested area.
#### 6.19.2.2 Input data
In order to achieve the intended objectives, this solution proposes two
alternative solutions:
\- Alt#1 updates the table with input data of the QoS Sustainability analytics
(TS 23.288 [5]) by adding information on radio resource utilization and input
related to other QoS parameters (e.g. delay, packet error rate).
\- Alt#2 in addition to the updates of the table with input data additional
input are considered as explained below.
Table 6.19.2.2-1: Data collection for \"QoS Sustainability\" analytics (TS
23.288 [5])
Information Source Description
* * *
RAN UE Throughput OAM TS 28.554 [9] Average UE bitrate in the Area or path of
Interest (Payload data volume on RLC level per elapsed time unit on the air

cell, per 5QI and per S-NSSAI. QoS flow Retainability OAM TS 28.554 [9] Number
of abnormally released QoS flows during the time the QoS Flows were used per
timeslot, per cell, per 5QI and per S-NSSAI. **RAN status, load and

Radio Resource Utilization) and performance in the Area or path of Interest as

packet delay between NG-RAN and PSA UPF in the Area or path of Interest as
defined in TS 28.552 [7] Packet Loss and/or Drop OAM packet loss (UL/DL)
information in the NG-RAN in the Area or path of Interest as defined in TS
28.552 [7]
NOTE 1: The timeslot is the time interval split according to the time unit of
the OAM statistics defined by operator.
NOTE 2: Whether the information listed in Table 6.19.2.2-1 can be collected in
requested Area or path of Interest from AF should be dependent on RAN WG3/SA
WG5.
In Alt#1, with the OAM data per finer granularity area in Table 6.19.2.2-1,
the NWDAF derives the \"QoS Sustainability\" statistics on the finer
granularity area.
In Alt#2, in addition to the information listed in Table 6.19.2.2-1 collected
from the OAM in requested Area or path of Interest, additional input data per
UE within the finer granularity area for the QoS Sustainability analytics is
shown in Table 6.19.2.2-2.
Note that the NWDAF should firstly determine the Cell list or TA list where
requested area or path of Interest is included before the data collection from
LMF, AMF, SMF and PCF.
For a finer granularity area smaller than a cell, the NWDAF can determine the
Cell ID for the cell based on the local configuration of the mapping between
the geo area and the network area. Alternatively, during the QoS
sustainability analytics subscription by the AF via NEF, the NEF can also
determine the Cell ID for the cell based on its local configuration and send
the Cell ID to NWDAF.
To get a UE ID list located in the finer granularity area, the NWDAF can
request the UE location information for all the UEs located in the cell then
determine the UE ID list by itself. Alternatively, the NWDAF can also request
LMF to provide the UE ID list located in the finer granularity area. In this,
the NWDAF should include both the Cell ID and the finer granularity area
information into the request service operation to the LMF.

TS 23.008 [19] UE information GSMA database This external database can provide
additional information for UE identified with PEI, such as: device model,
device manufacturer, supported frequency bands, type of device
NOTE 3: The new input about QoS profile from SMF/PCF corresponding to the QNC
or AQP will not trigger new RAN measurement.
NOTE 4: In order to reduce the amount of information collected per measurement
point, the new input about UPF information, VelocityEstimate, Subscription
Information, PEI, UE Information shall be collected only when a notification
is received for the event =\"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\".
NOTE 5: NWDAF may decide to ignore some of the filters if collected
measurements are not sufficient to derive meaningful analytics. In such
scenario, a warning message is provided in the response or notification to the
NF consumer.
Note that based on the current QNC/AQP notification mechanism, the SMF/PCF
cannot know which parameter of the PER, PDB or GFBR cannot be fulfilled from
the QNC/AQP=\"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" event. On one hand, because
the V2X Application based on the QoS sustainability analytics is quite safety
sensitive, when QNC/AQP=\"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\", the NWDAF can
default assume that all the GFBR/PDB/PER are not fulfilled in RAN and send the
analytics to V2X AF to help application adjustment. Alternatively, the NWDAF
can try to figure the reason out on its own by comparing the RAN notification
(i.e. a new reference for the newly fulfilled QoS profile) with the previously
fulfilled QoS profile, i.e. if only one of the values has changed the reason
is that parameter (if two or three have changed, the NWDAF does not know which
parameter(s) caused the problem).
This solution does not provide any enhancement on the current QNC/QAP
triggering mechanism i.e. NWDAF can only collect the current QNC/AQP events
triggered by the AF. It means that the signalling pressure is not too high
since signalling is not collected for every QoS Sustainability request,
Notification control is enabled when the QoS Notification Control parameter is
set in the PCC rule (received from the PCF) that is bound to the QoS Flow.
NWDAF subscribes to the network data from AMF in the Table 6.19.2.2-2 by
invoking Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe (Event IDs = Location Changes, Area of
Interest=Cell list or TA list).
Editor\'s note: How to collect the UE location and speed from LMF is FFS and
the cooperation with FS_eLCS_Ph3 is needed.
NWDAF subscribes the network data from SMF/PCF in the Table 6.19.2.2-2 by
using the services provided by SMF/PCF together with the Cell list or TA list.
The correlation information in clause 6.2.4 of TS 23.288 [5] are re-used to
correlate the data from LMF, AMF and SMF/PCF.
With the CN data per UE in the finer granularity area in Table 6.19.2.2-2, the
NWDAF derives the \"QoS Sustainability\" statistics on the finer granularity
area. For example, the NWDAF can derives the analytics as follows:
\- how many percent of the UE\'s bit rate/packet delay/packet error rate which
can be or cannot be guaranteed on the finer granularity area (below cell
level); or
\- average bit rate/packet delay/packet error rate can be or cannot be
guaranteed on the finer granularity area (below cell level).
#### 6.19.2.3 Output analytics
The NWDAF outputs the QoS Sustainability analytics, which should be provided
according to the analytics request area of path of interest granularity. The
provided granularity depends also on collected monitoring data (e.g. that the
model has been trained).
Also, the Crossed Reporting Threshold(s) should be indicated for QoS
parameter: Throughput, Delay, Packet loss.

#### 6.19.2.4 Procedures
The procedure in Figure 6.9.4-1 of TS 23.288 [5] is re-used with additional
data collection step from LMF, AMF, UDM, etc.
Editor\'s note: The procedure will be added when the service operation for LMF
data collection is defined.
### 6.19.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NWDAF:
\- Monitor more information by OAM including radio resource utilization and
input related to other QoS parameters or collects QNC/AQP events from SMF/PCF,
UE Location and UE speed from LMF or AMF.
\- The outputs of the QoS Sustainability analytics (statistics and
predictions), should be provide:
\- Crossed Reporting Threshold(s) for QoS parameter: Throughput, Delay, Packet
loss.
\- more granular location, according to the request with an area or a path of
interest.
\- extensions of the NWDAF to support UDM query and optionally GSMA database.
Consumer NFs:
\- In the case that an area of interest is provided in the QoS Sustainability
request message by an analytics consumer then the necessary granularity of the
area of interest should be indicated.
## 6.20 Solution #20: GTP metrics for QoS Sustainability analytics
### 6.20.1 Description
This solution addresses the Key Issue #7: Enhancements on QoS Sustainability
analytics.
In Rel-17, the NWDAF supporting QoS Sustainability analytics collects UE QoS
flow Retainability KPI and RAN UE Throughput KPI from OAM (see clause 6.9.2 of
TS 23.288 [5]).
This solution proposes that the NWDAF additionally collects the following
input (see Table 6.20.2-1) according to existing measurements defined in
clause 5.33.3 of TS 23.501 [2] (QoS Monitoring to Assist URLLC Service).
In order to extend to Network Performance measurements following IP-layer
section capacity and IP-layer available section capacity definition from ITU-T
Y.1540 [8], the NWDAF should also collect capacity metrics based on GTP path
(see Table 6.20.2-2) between UPF, NG-RAN and UE.
NOTE: How OAM can perform capacity measurements is to be determined by SA WG5.

## 6.21 Solution #21: Federated Learning procedure between different NWDAFs
### 6.21.1 Description
This solution is proposed for KI#8 to support the Federated Learning procedure
between different NWDAFs containing MTLF.
### 6.21.2 Procedures
#### 6.21.2.1 NWDAF \"FL Capability\" Registration
During the NWDAF containing MTLF registration in NRF procedure:
\- The NWDAF containing MTLF shall include the \"FL capability\" registered in
its NF Profile registered in the NRF.
\- The \"FL capability\" indicates to support \"FLaggregation\" and / or \"FL
participant\" for the corresponding Analytics ID.
\- \"FLaggregation\" capability means the MTLF is able to manage the FL
operation, select FLparticipants, aggregate the ML models from different ML
clients and send back the trained ML model information to the FL participants.
\- \"FL participant\" capability means the MTLF is able to perform the ML
model training for the ML model that requested by the \"FL aggregation\" by
using the available local database and report the trained ML model information
to the \"FL aggregation\". The local database can be the data that is allowed
to collect by the MTLF from other 5GS or ADRF.
#### 6.21.2.2 NWDAF Selection for FL operation
\"FL Consumer\" NWDAF is either an NWDAF containing AnLF, or an NWDAF
containing MTLF that does not support the \"FL aggregation\" capability for
the specific Analytics ID, but it is able to enable FL for his/her ML model by
requesting FL to \"FL Server\" NWDAF.
\"FL Server\" NWDAF is the NWDAF containing MTLF that supports the \"FL
aggregation\" capability for the specific Analytics ID and selected as the FL
Server.
\"FL Client\" NWDAF is the NWDAF containing MTLF that supports the \"FL
participant\" capability for the specific Analytics ID and selected by the
\"FL Server\" NWDAF as the FL Client.
The \"FL Server\" NWDAF may be selected based on operator\'s local
configuration or by the NWDAF containing AnLF for the analytics ID.
When the \"FL Consumer\" NWDAF is an NWDAF containing AnLF and it discovers an
MTLF for a trained ML model as described in clause 5.2 of TS 23.288 [5]. If
there is no trained ML model for the Analytics ID supported, the NRF will
select the NWDAF containing MTLFs that supports the Analytics ID and the Area
Of Interest to train the ML model. The NRF may take priority to select the
NWDAF(s) containing MTLF that support \"FL aggregation\" capability if
multiple NWDAF containing MTLF profiles registered in the NRF can support the
requested ML model training, NRF returns the candidate for instances of NWDAF
containing MTLF sent to consumer. The NWDAF containing AnLF selects one NWDAF
containing MTLF from the list that received from NRF and initiates the ML
Model Provisioning procedure as described in clause 6.2A of TS 23.288 [5]. If
the NWDAF containing MTLF selected by NWDAF containing AnLF supports the \"FL
aggregation\" capability for the Analytics ID, the NWDAF containing MTLF will
further decide if FL procedure is initiated. If the NWDAF containing MTLF
selected by NWDAF containing AnLF does not support the \"FL aggregation\"
capability, the NWDAF containing MTLF may either performs the ML model
training and provision as defined in clause 6.2A in TS 23.288 [5] or discovers
a NWDAF containing MTLF that supports \"FL aggregation\" capability to trigger
FL operation. When \"FL Consumer\" NWDAF is an NWDAF containing MTLF and it
determines to trigger FL by internal logic (e.g. lack of data to train, heavy
overhead from the existing ML training, etc.), \"FL Consumer\" NWDAF discovers
an NWDAF which supports \"FL aggregation\" capability via NRF and initiates FL
by invoking a Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Subscribe operation with the indication
of enabling FL and initial ML model file address to the selected NWDAF (i.e.
\"FL Sever\" NWDAF).
The \"FL Server\" NWDAF selects the \"FL Client\" NWDAF from NRF as described
in clause 5.2 of TS 23.288 [5]. The \"FL Server\" NWDAF further includes the
\"FL Client\" capability as \"FL participant\" capability and the number of
reported NWDAFs for the Analytics ID in the discovery request message. The NRF
returns the candidates for instances of NWDAF containing MTLF and each
candidate for instance of NWDAF containing MTLF includes the Analytics ID, the
ML Model Filter Information and support of \"FL participant\" for the
Analytics ID.
#### 6.21.2.3 FL operation between NWDAFs containing MTLF
The FL operation procedure between NWDAFs containing MTLF is described in
Figure 6.21.2.3-1.
Figure 6.21.2.3-1: FL operation procedure between NWDAFs
0a. When \"FL Consumer\" NWDAF is an NWDAF containing MTLF without \"FL
aggregation\" capability and it determines to trigger FL from the internal
logic, the \"FL Consumer\" NWDAF discovers and selects \"FL Server\" NWDAF via
NRF, and subscribes Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Subscribe service to the \"FL
Sever\" NWDAF with indication of \"Enabling FL\" and the file address of ML
model to train.
0b. When \"FL Consumer\" NWDAF is an NWDAF containing AnLF, the \"FL
Consumer\" NWDAF discovers and selects \"FL\" Server NWDAF via NRF, and
subscribes Nnwdaf_MLModelProvsion_Subscribe service to the \"FL Server\" as
described in clause 6.2A of TS 23.288 [5].
0c. The FL operation maybe triggered by local configuration in the \"FL
Server\" NWDAF itself or request from \"FL Consumer\" by either step 0a or
step 0b. If the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe operation is triggered at
step 0b, the \"FL Server\" NWDAF will consider whether FL operation is needed
or not by taking into account the Area Of Interest, the ML model Reporting
Information, Expiry time and local operator configuration.
The \"FL Server\" NWDAF is configured the Initial FL parameters corresponding
to the Analytics ID:
\- Number of FL rounds,
\- Total number of FL clients used in the process.
\- The area of interesting for the analytics ID, the area of interesting can
be a PLMN or a registration area list.
For Initial ML model training, the pre-configured Initial FL parameters will
be used.
The ML model maybe re-trained to improve correctness of NWDAF analytics as
discussed in KI#1, the FL parameters used for re-training maybe different to
the pre-configured Initial FL parameters.
NOTE 1: The initiation of ML model re-training and the details of FL parameter
should be aligned with the conclusion of KI#1.
1\. \"FL Server\" NWDAF selects the \"FL Client\" NWDAFs for the specific
Analytics ID within the area of interesting for the FL as described in clause
6.21.2.2. \"FL Server\" NWDAF sends Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Subscribe to the
\"FL Client\" NWDAFs with additional parameters:
\- Indication for \"Enabling Local Training\".
\- the FL ID: For each ML model FL operation, the \"FL Server\" NWDAF will
allocate different FL IDs for different \"FL Client\" NWDAFs. The \"FL
Server\" NWDAF will identify the received the interim ML models from different
\"FL Client\" via Analytics ID + FL ID. The FL ID will not updated during the
FL operation procedure.
\- ML model information (containing a (set of) file address of the trained ML
model) to request the ML model operation.
NOTE 2: The selection of FL Clients and the detail parameters to share the ML
model should be aligned with the conclusion of KI #5.
2\. For each \"FL Client\" NWDAF, if the ML model information is received from
consumer, the \"FL Client\" NWDAF downloads the ML model according to the ML
model information received from step 1.
3\. User consent will be performed by each \"FL Client\" NWDAF if UE related
parameters are required for ML training.
4\. Each \"FL Client\" NWDAF may collect data from other available 5GS (e.g.
AMF, SMF) or DCCF for local ML model training.
5\. Data source sends data to \"FL Client\" NWDAF.
6\. Each \"FL Client\" NWDAF performs local ML model training and sends the
trained interim ML model via Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Notify to the \"FL
Server\" NWDAF. The Analytics ID, FL ID, File address of learning results and
ML Model Filter Information for the trained interim ML model by \"FL Client\"
NWDAF are included in the notify message.
7\. \"FL Server\" NWDAF downloads interim trained ML models Identified by
Analytics ID and FL ID trained by each \"FL Client\" NWDAF according to the ML
model information received in step 6.
8\. \"FL Server\" NWDAF performs aggregation for the ML models for the same
analytics ID.
Step 2 to step 8 in box A may repeated to support iterative learning based on
the FL parameters configured for the Analytics ID expect step 3. For example,
after the step 8 for the first round of learning, the \"FL Server\" NWDAF will
initiate step 1 for the second round of learning.
Use consent check is only performed for in the first round of iterative
learning.
9-10. The \"FL Client\" NWDAF may subscribe the trained ML model for the
Analytics ID from \"FL Server\" NWDAF as described in clause 6.2A.1 of TS
23.288 [5].
11a. \"FL Sever\" provides the trained ML models by FL to the \"FL Consumer\"
NWDAF at step 0a by invoking \"Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Notify\" service
operation.
11b. \"FL Sever\" provides the trained ML models by FL to the \"FL Consumer\"
NWDAF at step 0b by invoking \"Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify\" service
operation.
NOTE 2: The ML model provision between \"FL Server\" NWDAF and \"FL Client\"
NWDAF in this solution should align with the conclusion in KI#5.
### 6.21.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NWDAF containing MTLF:
\- register the \"FL capability\" in NF profile to NRF.
For \"FL Server\" NWDAF:
\- support \"FL Client\" NWDAF discovery procedure.
\- support to send FL request to \"FL Client\" NWDAF.
\- support to aggregate the interim learning results from \"FL Clients\"
NWDAF.
\- support a new service \"Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining\".
For \"FL Client\" NWDAF:
\- support local ML training based on \"FL Server\" NWDAF request.
\- support to report the trained interim ML model to \"FL Server\" NWDAF.
\- support a new service \"Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining\".
## 6.22 Solution #22: Federated learning group creation
### 6.22.1 Description
The solution addresses Key Issue #8: Supporting Federated Learning in 5GC with
proposing a procedure to create Federated Learning group of NWDAFs for a given
analytics request from any NF.
To enable Federated Learning among NWDAFs, it is required to support creation
of a Federated Learning group for a given analytics request. In this regard,
this solution focuses on how to discover proper participant NWDAFs supporting
Federated Learning, create the Federation Learning group, and provision
information required to coordinate the operation among the participant NWDAFs.
This solution is based on the following assumption:
\- A Federated Learning group consists of one central NWDAF and multiple local
NWDAFs. The local NWDAF performs local ML model training and provide local ML
model to the central NWDAF. The central NWDAF aggregates the local ML model
trained by local NWDAFs in the Federated Learning group, calculate and
distribute a global ML model to the local NWDAFs.
\- For a given Federated Learning group, the same ML model is used by all the
participant NWDAF analytics.
### 6.22.2 Procedures
Figure 6.22.2-1: Federated learning group creation procedure
0\. NWDAF(s) respectively invokes an Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister Request
service providing their own NF profile that includes supported Analytics ID,
ML Model Filter Information (e.g. S-NSSAI(s), Area(s) of Interest) and ML
model sharing capability, which is required to send locally trained model to
the Central NWDAF during federation learning operations as local NWDAF, when
becoming operative for the first time.
Editor\'s note: The aspects of model sharing between Central NWDAF and Local
NWDAF should be aligned with in key issue #5 (e.g. including details on ML
model information).
1\. The NF sends Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request to the NWDAF. The request
message includes Analytics ID, Target of Analytics Reporting, Analytics Filter
Information and Analytics Reporting Information.
2\. The NWDAF 1 determines to perform federated learning for the received
Analytics request if it is locally configured to perform federated learning
for the requested Analytics ID (e.g. based on the operator policy). The NWDAF
1 also determines to act as Central NWDAF for federation learning for the
requested analytics in step 1 if it has Federated Learning Model Aggregation
capability (i.e. capability of aggregating local training models and
calculating the global model from then).
NOTE 1: The Central NWDAF in this solution is assumed to host both MTLF and
AnLF logical functions. If NWDAF 1 contains only AnLF, it performs the
discovery of Central NWDAF, which contains MTLF and has Federated Learning
Model Aggregation capability via NRF, and delegates the model training.
NOTE 2: The Central NWDAF decides to initiate FL for the received Analytics
request based on the local configuration.
3\. The NWDAF invokes the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request service operation from the
NRF to find other NWDAFs that are able to perform federated learning as local
NWDAFs for the Analytics request in step 1. The Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request
message includes Analytics ID in step 1, ML Model Filter Information according
to the Analytics Filter Information received in step 1 and ML model sharing
capability that is required to perform Federation Learning.
4\. The NRF returns multiple local NWDAF candidates matching the requested
capabilities and Analytics ID.
5\. The central NWDAF requests the local NWDAF candidates to join the
federated learning group for the Analytics ID received in step 1. The request
message includes Central NWDAF information (e.g. NWDAF ID and address),
S-NSSAI, Analytics ID and ML Model Filter Information for the federated
learning operation, etc.
6\. The local NWDAF candidates reply to the NWDAF with the indication on
whether to accept the federation learning group participation request or not.
7\. Upon receiving the responses from local NWDAF candidates in step 6, the
central NWDAF determines a federated learning group consisting of NWDAFs that
indicate to accept to the federation learning group participation request in
step 6. The central NWDAF creates federated learning group information that
includes Analytics ID, list of local NWDAF information (identifiers and
addresses of NWDAFs), ML Model Filter Information, ML model information (e.g.
the ML model file address, ML model identifier, etc), Central NWDAF address as
target address where local training model is sent, transmission expiration
time information, and local learning processing rule information.
NOTE 3: The details on ML model information will be aligned with the
conclusion of key issue #5 with respect to the aspects of model sharing.
The local learning processing rule information includes either local
processing rule ID or local ML model training rule e.g. how many iterations
for local model training should be performed for one epoch before providing
the local model to the Central NWDAF.
NOTE 4: The local processing rule ID refers to a pre-agreed operation rule for
local ML model training in federated learning operation among NWDAFs.
The transmission expiration time information indicates a deadline before which
the local ML model should be transmitted to the Central NWDAF to generate
global ML model for an epoch. For example, the deadline can be represented by
timestamp and timer value respectively indicating start time of federated
learning operation and expiry time period.
8\. The central NWDAF provides the local NWDAFs (i.e. federated learning group
member local NWDAFs) with federated learning operation information that
includes Analytics ID, ML model information, Central NWDAF address as target
address where local training model is sent, transmission expiration time
information, and local learning processing rule information.
9\. Local NWDAFs acknowledge to the central NWDAF to indicate if the local
NWDAF is able to perform federate learning according to the federated learning
operation information.
### 6.22.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NWDAF:
\- Support creation of federated learning group with acting as NRF service
consumer to discover and select NWDAFs having required capability to perform
federated learning.
\- Support to share ML model with other NWDAFs and, especially for Central
NWDAF, aggregate ML models provided by other NWDAFs.
NRF:
\- Support new parameters in NF profile provided by NWDAF.
\- Support new discovery parameters related to federated learning group
creation.
## 6.23 Solution #23: Support of federated learning for model training
### 6.23.1 Description
Model training using Federated learning is useful in scenarios where data may
not be easily collected from Data Producer NF. For example, there may be data
privacy/data security requirements where data collection from data producer
NFs is not feasible or there can be high signalling load if data is collected
from Data Producer NFs that have limited resources available (e.g. NFs
supporting a local edge network).
Federated learning solves this problem by locally training an ML model using
data that are locally available and distributing local model parameters to a
central model training function that aggregates the model parameters and
generates a central ML model.
The following architecture is proposed to support model training using
federated learning.
Figure 6.23.1-1: Architecture supporting model training using federated
learning
The main functions of the federated learning architecture is as follows:
\- A central MTLF (that supports FL aggregation) that configures one or more
local MTLF(s) (that supports FL participation) with the data that are required
to be collected from one or more (local) Data Producer NFs and generates an
aggregated ML model based on ML model parameters received from an ML model
trained locally from each local MTLF.
\- One or more local MTLF(s) that support ML model training by collecting data
from one or more Data Producer NFs available locally.
\- A central Analytics Logical Function (AnLF) that discovers the Central MTLF
supporting federated learning for model training since not all MTLFs will
support Model Training using federated learning. The AnLF can discover the
central MTLF on per Analytic ID/Analytic Filter information basis. The NRF
includes information in the NF profile whether an MTLF support FL aggregation
or FL participation.
Once the AnLF discovers the Central MTLF that supports FL aggregation, the
AnLF will request an ML model for an Analytic ID including ML model filter
information that can include an S-NSSAI, area of interest, DNAI and other
information. The Central MTLF based on the Analytic ID requested and the ML
model filter information determines that the requested ML model requires
federated learning and discovers one or more local MTLFs for each data (i.e
Event ID) that cannot be collected directly from a Data Producer NF. The
central MTLF discovers the local MTLF(s) from the NRF and configures the local
MTLF to train a local ML model indicating the data required to be collected by
one or more Data Producer NF(s). The central MTLF then retrieves local ML
model parameters from each local MTLF and aggregates gradients/loss factors
generating a central ML model that is sent to the AnLF.
### 6.23.2 Procedures
A detailed procedure is provided below:
Figure 6.23.2-1: Support of model training using federated learning
0\. An AnLF NWDAF receives a request from a consumer NF. The request includes
an Analytics ID and analytic filter information as described in TS 23.288 [5].
1\. [conditional]The AnLF determines the central MTLF. The AnLF may determine
that a Central MTLF supporting federated learning is required.
2\. [conditional]The AnLF discovers the central MTLF from the NRF by invoking
an Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request including the Analytic ID, service area, MTLF that
supports FL aggregation capability.
NOTE 1: The service area may be needed in case in a network deployment a
specific service area, the MTLF is configured to support model training using
federated learning.
3\. [conditional]The AnLF receives from the NRF the NF ID of the central MTLF.
4\. [conditional]The AnLF sends a subscription request to the central MTLF
including Analytic ID and ML model filter information as described in TS
23.288 [5].
5\. The central MTLF determines that federated learning is required. The MTLF
may determine such information if:
\- Data (corresponding to an Event ID) cannot be collected directly from an NF
(based on local configuration)
\- The request for analytics information is for a DNAI where federated
learning is required.
\- The request for analytics information is for a service area where federated
learning is required.
6\. The central MTLF discovers the local MTLF for federated learning. The
determination is based on the training data (i.e. Event ID) required by the
local MTLF to train the local ML Model.
7\. The central MTLF discovers the local MTLF from the NRF by invoking an
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request including the Analytic ID, service area and an
indication that the MTLF supporting FL participation for ML model training.
8\. The AnLF receives from the NRF the NF ID of the local MTLF(s).
9a.-9b. The central MTLF configures the local MTLF(s) to train a local ML
model using data from one or more data producer NFs corresponding to the Event
ID(s) required. The central MTLF includes in the request to the local MTLF the
Analytic ID of the ML model required. The procedure for local configuration is
shown in Figure 6.23.2-2.
10a.10b. Each local MTLF collects data and locally trains an ML model
11a-11b. The central MTLF and local MTLF(s) exchange ML model parameters that
allows aggregation of gradients and loss factors from each local ML model.
Steps 11a and 11b are ML model specific and out of scope of 3GPP.
NOTE 2: Steps 10a through 11b are iterative and continue until the central
MTLF determines that the generated ML model can be used by the AnLF (e.g.
reached the required confidence level).
12\. The MTLF updates its central trained model using the aggregated model
parameters
13\. The MTLF indicates to the AnLF that a trained model is available.
Figure 6.23.2-2: Support of FL between central and local MTLFs
1\. The central MTLF determines if horizontal or vertical FL takes place based
on the analytic ID. The Central MTLF determines the local MTLF(s) for
federated learning as described in steps 6-8 of Figure 6.23.2-1. The central
MTLF determines if horizontal or vertical FL takes place based on the analytic
ID.
2\. The Central MTLF sends a request for federated learning to MTLF 1 where
the request includes, an Analytic ID of the model required, one or more of the
following Event ID(s) needed, service area.
3\. The MTLF aggregator repeats step 2 for MTLF 2.
5\. MTLF 1 performs data collection and provides model parameters to the
Central MTLF aggregator.
6\. MTLF 2 performs data collection and provides model parameters to the
Central MTLF.
7\. The Central MTLF calculates aggregated model parameters.
### 6.23.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
\- Discovery and selection of local MTLF for model training using federated
learning.
## 6.24 Solution #24: Horizontal Federated Learning among Multiple NWDAFs
### 6.24.1 Description
This solution is proposed to address Key Issue #8: Supporting Federated
Learning in 5GC.
Current enablers for network automation architecture by NWDAF still faces some
major challenges as follows:
\- User data privacy and security (protected by e.g. GDPR) has become a
worldwide issue, it is also difficult for NWDAF to collect UE level network
data.
\- With the introduction of MTLF in Rel-17, various data from wide area is
needed to train an ML model for NWDAF containing MTLF. However, it is
difficult for NWDAF containing MTLF to collect all the raw data from
distributed data source in different areas, because heavy signalling load may
exist if it centralized all the data into the NWDAF containing MTLF.
In order to address the challenges, Federated Learning (also called Federated
Machine Learning) technique in NWDAF containing MTLF could be adopted to train
an ML model, in which there is no need for raw data transferring (e.g.
centralized into one NWDAF) but only need for cooperation among multiple
NWDAFs (MTLF) distributed in different areas i.e. sharing of ML model and of
the learning results among multiple NWDAFs (MTLF).
During the FL training process, the Server NWDAF can inform the training
status to the consumer based on the consumer\'s request. The consumer could
modify subscription to NWDAF for new model requirement. The Server NWDAF will
update or terminate the FL training process accordingly.
This solution is mainly focusing on horizontal Federated Learning among
Multiple NWDAFs, whose procedures are illustrated in the following clauses.
### 6.24.2 Procedures
#### 6.24.2.1 General procedure for Federated Learning among Multiple NWDAF
Instances
Figure 6.24.2.1-1: General procedure for Federated Learning among Multiple
NWDAF Instances
1-3. Client NWDAF registers its NF profile (Client NWDAF Type (see clause
5.2.7.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]), Address of Client NWDAF, Support of Federated
Learning capability information, Analytics ID(s) , Service Area) into NRF.
4-6. Server NWDAF discovers one or multiple Client NWDAF instances which could
be used for Federated Learning via the NRF to get IP addresses of Client NWDAF
instances by invoking the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request (Analytics ID, Support of
Federated Learning capability information, Service Area) service operation.
It is assumed an Analytics Id is preconfigured for a type of Federated
Learning. Thus, the NRF can realize the Server NWDAF is requesting to perform
federated learning based on the pre-configuration. And the NRF responds to the
central NWDAF the IP address of multiple NWDAF instances which support the
Analytics Id.
NOTE: The analytic ID(s) supporting Federated Learning can be configured by
operator.
Based on the response from NRF, Server NWDAF selects which NWDAF clients will
participate.
7\. Server NWDAF sends a request to the selected Client NWDAFs that
participate in the Federated learning including some parameters (such as
initial ML model, data type list, maximum response time window, etc.) to help
the local model training for Federated Learning.
NOTE: This step should be aligned with the outcome of KI#5.
8\. Each Client NWDAF collects its local data by using the current mechanism
in clause 6.2 of TS 23.288 [5].
9\. During Federated Learning training procedure, each Client NWDAF further
trains the retrieved ML model from the server NWDAF based on its own data, and
reports the results of ML model training to the Server NWDAF, e.g. the
gradient.
The trained models/parameters are shared/exchanged among the multiple NWDAF
instances during the FL training process by using the Nnwdaf_MLAggregation
service or the extended Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service as defined in clause
6.24.3. Note that only one of the options should be chosen for the normative
phase.
10\. The Server NWDAF aggregates all the local ML model training results
retrieved at step 9 such as the gradient to update the global ML model.
11a. Based on the consumer request, the Server NWDAF updates the training
status (an accuracy level) to the consumer using
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service periodically (one or multiple rounds of
training or every 10 min, etc.) or dynamically when some pre-determined status
(e.g. some accuracy level) is achieved.
11b. [Optional] Consumer decides whether the current model can fulfil the
requirement e.g. accuracy and time. The consumer modifies subscription if the
current model can fulfil the requirement.
11c. According to the request from the consumer, the Server NWDAF updates or
terminates the current FL training process by invoking an
Nnwdaf_MLAggregation_Modify or an Nnwdaf_MLAggregation_Terminate service
operation.
12\. [If the FL procedure continues] The Server NWDAF sends the aggregated ML
model information (updated ML model) to each Client NWDAF for next ground
model training by invoking an
Nnwdaf_MLAggregration_Notify/Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation.
13\. Each Client NWDAF updates its own ML model based on the aggregated model
information (updated ML model) distributed by the Server NWDAF at step 12.
NOTE: The steps 8-13 should be repeated until the training termination
condition (e.g. maximum number of iterations, or the result of loss function
is lower than a threshold) is reached.
After the training procedure is finished, the globally optimal ML model or ML
model parameters could be distributed to the Client NWDAFs for the inference.
#### 6.24.2.2 Procedure for usage of Federated Learning in Abnormal Behaviour
Figure 6.24.2.2-1: Procedure for usage of Federated Learning in Abnormal
Behaviour
1\. A Server NWDAF determines to train an Abnormal Classifier using the input
data defined in Table 6.7.5.2-1 of TS 23.288 [5]). The Server NWDAF discovers
two Client NWDAFs i.e. Client NWDAF 1 in Area A, Client NWDAF 2 in Area B will
participate as defined in figure 6.24.2.1-1.
2\. Client NWDAF 1 and Client NWDAF 2 collect raw data from SMF and AMF,
respectively. The data collection procedures from AMF and SMF are defined in
step 2-3, clause 6.7.5.4 of TS 23.288 [5].
3-4. Client NWDAF 1 and Client NWDAF 2 collect Exception information from AF,
respectively. The Exception information is defined in clause 6.7.5.2 of TS
23.288 [5].
Repeat from step 5-8 until the training termination condition (e.g. maximum
number of iterations) is fulfilled:
5\. During Federated Learning training procedure, based on the local raw data,
Client NWDAF 1 and Client NWDAF 2 further train the retrieved Abnormal
Classifier from the Server NWDAF, respectively.
6\. Client NWDAF 1 and Client NWDAF 2 respectively report the information of
local training results for Abnormal Classifier (e.g. volume of the local
dataset, parameters for update of the Abnormal Classifier) to the Server
NWDAF.
7\. Server NWDAF aggregates all the local training results for Abnormal
Classifier to derive the aggregated Abnormal Classifier information.
8\. Server NWDAF sends the aggregated Abnormal Classifier information to
Client NWDAF 1 and Client NWDAF 2, and then, Client NWDAF 1 and Client NWDAF 2
update the its own Abnormal Classifier based on the aggregated Abnormal
Classifier information distributed by the Server NWDAF.
After the training procedure is finished, the globally optimal Abnormal
Classifier or Abnormal Classifier parameters could be distributed to the
Client NWDAF 1 and Client NWDAF 2 as well as the new Client NWDAFs, if
requested, for the inference.
### 6.24.3 Nnwdaf services used for model sharing/parameter exchanging
#### 6.24.3.1 Nnwdaf_MLAggregation Service (Option 1)
This service enables model sharing/parameter exchanging in the execution phase
of a ML training process among multiple NWDAF instances.
Figure 6.24.3.1-1 illustrates the use of service operations of the
Nnwdaf_MLAggregation service for e.g. trained model sharing/parameter
exchanging among the Server and Client NWDAFs in a ML training process.
Figure 6.24.3.1-1: Service Operations of the Nnwdaf_MLAggregation Service
Figure 6.24.3.1-1 shows the use of service operations of the
Nnwdaf_MLAggregation service, e.g. for trained parameters exchanging/models
sharing in the ML training process. In the very beginning, i.e. the 0th round,
Server NWDAF distributes a container either containing initial model
parameters or a reference to it or to a model (e.g. URL) to the selected
Client NWDAF(s) together with the FL correlation ID, and identity of the
current iteration round (e.g. IR ID=0).
In the 1st round, the Client NWDAF(s) subscribe to the Server NWDAF for global
model/parameter updating, e.g. by invoking an Nnwdaf_MLAggregation_Subscribe
service operation together with the current round trained local
models/parameters, FL correlation ID, and identity of the current iteration
round (e.g. IR ID=1, 2, ...). Server NWDAF sends a container either containing
the parameters of the aggregated global model or a reference to it or to the
aggregated global model (e.g. URL) to the Client NWDAF(s) by invoking an
Nnwdaf_MLAggregation_Notify service operation with FL correlation ID, and
identity of the current iteration round (e.g. IR ID=1, 2, ...).
In the i^th^ round (i>1), the Client NWDAF(s) update its subscription to the
Server NWDAF for global model/parameter updating, e.g. by invoking an
Nnwdaf_MLAggregation_Subscribe/Nnwdaf_MLAggregation_Update service operation
to update the current subscription together with the subscription ID, a
container either containing the local model parameters or a reference to it or
to the local model (e.g. URL), FL correlation ID, and identity of the current
iteration round (e.g. IR ID=2, 3, ...). Server NWDAF sends a container either
containing the parameters of the aggregated global model or a reference to it
or to the aggregated global model (e.g. URL) to the Client NWDAF(s) by
invoking an Nnwdaf_MLAggregation_Notify service operation with FL correlation
ID, and identity of the current iteration round (e.g. IR ID=2, 3, ...).
NOTE: The content of the container is out of scope of 3GPP.
If terminate or update of the ML process is needed, the Server NWDAF terminate
or update the current ML process by invoking an Nnwdaf_MLAggregation_Terminate
or an Nnwdaf_MLAggregation_Modify service operation with FL correlation ID and
IR ID to terminate/update the training at the Client NWDAF(s).
#### 6.24.3.2 Extended Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision Service (Option 2)
This extended service enables the model sharing/parameter exchanging in the
execution phase of a ML training process among multiple NWDAF instances.
Figure 6.24.3.1-1 illustrates the use of service operations of the extended
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service for e.g. trained model sharing/parameter
exchanging among the Server and Client NWDAFs in a ML training process.
Figure 6.24.3.2-1: Service Operations of the Extended Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision
Service
Depending on whether the provision is for trained model sharing or parameter
exchange the wanted output is set accordingly. Beside the existing inputs and
outputs, the new inputs and outputs of the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe
request include:
\- Identity of the current ML process, e.g. FL correlation ID.
\- Identity of the current iteration round, e.g. IR ID = 0, 1, 2, ...
Beside the exist inputs and outputs, the new inputs and outputs of the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify include
\- Identity of the current ML process, e.g. FL correlation ID.
\- Identity of the current iteration round, e.g. IR ID = 1, 2, 3, ...

\- Server NWDAF and Client NWDAF registration and discovery.
## 6.25 Solution #25: Outdoors Advertisement use case with finer granularity
location information
### 6.25.1 Description
This solution addresses Key issue #9: Enhancement of NWDAF with finer
granularity of location information.
In the LCS architecture, the LCS can provide LCS client location information
including geographic location, speed, heading, accuracy, timestamp, and so on.
Such information precisely represents the location status of a single UE or a
group of UE, which can help NWDAF to conduct some valuable statistics and
prediction analyses. Therefore, under the permission of users\' consent and
privacy checking, it is desirable to obtain location information from LCS
architecture in line with consumer requirements to help NWDAF make better
analyses and predictions.
Outdoors advertisements statistics business is a potential scenario combining
NWDAF and LCS architectures. In this scenario, the positioning information of
an uncertain group of UE within a certain area needs to be counted. These
amount of UEs is changing.
In this scenario, the NWDAF consumers can provide clear statistical
requirements including the location of a specific billboard, the period to be
calculated, the counting distance range, the accuracy information, and so on.
Then NWDAF provides billboard location information, statistical period, number
of UE passing by, the proportion of valid viewers, average staying time of
viewers, proportion of UE staying longer than the specified time, etc. Thus, a
new analytic ID needs to be designed.
Two categories of outdoor advertisements will be studied, expressways
advertisements and street advertisements.
For large outdoor advertisements, e.g. roadside advertisements on expressways,
advertising information on the billboard can be seen far away. In this way,
the granularity of UE location information required by NWDAF may be coarser,
such as around 400m near billboards. Therefore, NWDAF only counts the number
of users driving towards a correct and fixed direction. Furtherly, the users
whose staying time reach a threshold are counted as valid viewers of the
advertisement.
For small outdoor advertisements, e.g. street or neighbour advertisements,
people can see the contents shown on ads when they are close to the billboard.
In this way, the UE location information required by NWDAF will be finer
granular, such as around 5m near the billboard. At first, NWDAF conducts
preliminary screening on the speed and heading information with ignoring users
who move at a fast speed. Then, NWDAF determines the duration of the users and
counts the number of people passing by and valid viewers in this certain area.
In order to solve the aforementioned issue, this solution proposes a scheme
for providing statistics/prediction service under the measuring outdoors
advertisements viewers scenario.
### 6.25.2 Input Data
The input data for the analytics is described in Table 6.25.2-1.
Table 6.25.2-1: Input data for measuring the number of outdoors advertisements
viewers usage
Information Source (NOTE) Description

have some coordination with the FS_eLCS_Ph3 study.

### 6.25.4 Procedures
Figure 6.25.4-1 depicts a procedure for the Outdoor Advertisement use case
analytics provided by NWDAF.
Figure 6.25.4-1: Outdoors Advertisement use case analytics provided by NWDAF
1\. The consumer requests or subscribes to analytics information on the
Outdoors Advertisement use case provided by NWDAF. The parameters are carried
in the request including the location of a specific billboard, category of
advertisement, the period to be counted, the counting distance range, the
preferred granularity of the counting distance range, and so on.
\- an Analytics subscription or request (New Analytics ID, Analytics Filter
information = AOI, Analytics Reporting information = Analytics target period 1
or prediction target period 2) to the NWDAF by
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request.
The consumer may include multiple sets of parameters in order to provide
different combinations of \"Location information\" and \"Analytics target
period\" when requesting Outdoors Advertisement analytics.
2\. The NWDAF collects the UE location information data from the LCS
architecture.
NOTE: UE location information collection principles will be coordinated with
FS_eLCS_Ph3 study.
3\. The NWDAF conducts preliminary screening based on the category of
advertisement and then classifies statistics through time stamps and other
information. The UE can be counted only when it enters the counting distance
range and its location information meets the requirements by the rules of the
category of advertisement and NWDAF consumer.
The number of users passing by and the valid viewers can be counted:
\- For the expressway advertisements, users whose geographical location is in
a large range of the requested counting distance can be counted as users
passing by. The users whose speed and heading meet the requirements are
counted as valid viewers of the advertisement. The duration between valid
viewers entering and leaving the range requested in NWDAF consumers will be
regarded as staying time.
\- For the street advertisements, users whose geographical location is in a
smaller range of the requested counting distance can be counted as users
passing by. The users who have a limited speed are counted as valid viewers of
the advertisement. The duration between valid viewers entering and leaving the
range requested in NWDAF consumers will be regarded as staying time.
The NWDAF verifies whether the triggering conditions are met and derives the
requested analytics. The NWDAF can detect the need for notification based on
comparing the requested analytics of the preferred granularity of counting
distance range provided by the consumer over the requested Analytics target
period.
4\. The NWDAF provides a response or notification on the Outdoors
Advertisement use case to the consumer. The details for UE mobility analytics
provided by the NWDAF are defined in the output analytics information.
### 6.25.5 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NWDAF:
\- The NWDAF collects data from LCS architecture and analyses measuring the
number of outdoor advertisements viewers.
\- The new Analytic ID supporting the Outdoors Advertisement use case needs to
be supported.
Editor\'s note: The name of new analytic ID is FFS.
## 6.26 Solution #26: Finer granularity of location information based on cell
sequence
### 6.26.1 Description
Location information with cell/TA granularity is not enough for some vehicle
use cases. For example, while sending warning messages to vehicles running on
the road of traffic jam or traffic accident, we need further location
information of direction to determine whether the vehicles are running on the
up lane or down lane of the same road.
To decide the direction information, we can use the information of cell
sequence that the vehicle has went through. Unlike traditional UEs (e.g.
mobile phones carried by people) moving irregularly, vehicles can only run
forward (cannot run back and forth) along the road so vehicles driving in the
same direction of the road tend to go through the same sequence of cells.
### 6.26.2 Procedures
Firstly, a UE Location order indicator should be added in the Analytics Filter
information when consumer NF would like to request or subscribe the UE
Mobility analytics. The UE Location order indicator indicates the NWDAF should
derives the UE Mobility analytics in a UE Location order.
UE mobility analytics is specified in clause 6.7.2 of TS 23.288 [5]. The
following table is the output analytics of UE mobility statistics. Multiple UE
locations can be provided in the indicated time slot. However, there is no
clear indication about the order of those locations (cells). To determine the
direction of location information using cell sequence, we need to add a new
NOTE 4 as follows to make the multiple locations are in the right order. Other
procedures such as how to subscribe/notify this location information are the
same as clause 6.7.2 of TS 23.288 [5].
Table 6.7.2.3-1: UE mobility statistics
Information Description
* * *
UE group ID or UE ID Identifies a UE or a group of UEs, e.g. internal group ID
defined in TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.9.7, SUPI (see NOTE 1). Time slot entry
(1..max) List of time slots during the Analytics target period > Time slot
start Time slot start within the Analytics target period > Duration Duration
of the time slot > UE location (1..max) Observed location statistics (see NOTE
2, 4) >> UE location TA or cells which the UE stays (see NOTE 3) >> Ratio
Percentage of UEs in the group (in the case of a UE group)
NOTE 1: When target of analytics reporting is an individual UE, one UE ID
(i.e. SUPI) will be included, the NWDAF will provide the analytics mobility
result (i.e. list of (predicted) time slots) to NF service consumer(s) for the
UE.
NOTE 2: If Visited AOI(s) was provided in the analytics request/subscription,
the UE location provides information on the observed location(s) that the UE
or group of UEs had been residing during the Analytics Target Period.
NOTE 3: When possible and applicable to the access type, UE location is
provided according to the preferred granularity of location information.
NOTE 4: If target of analytics reporting is an individual UE or multiple UE
locations are provided, UE locations will be in the order of which the UE
passes through.
To implement the order of the UE locations in the UE Mobility analytics, this
solution proposes two alternative solutions:
\- Alt#1, update the UE Mobility analytics i.e. add a list of timestamps for
each UE location in the \"> UE location (1..max)\" during the current
\"duration\" parameter.
\- Alt#2, does not update the UE Mobility analytics but proposes that NWDAF
does not aggregate the UE locations in a long duration but provides the UE
locations one by one in their own time period, i.e. the \"UE location
(1..max)\" in the UE Mobility analytics has only one UE location which
indicates the UE is located in this UE location in the duration from the time
slot start.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS which alternative will be selected for the normative
standards.
### 6.26.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
Consumer NF (e.g. AMF):
\- Should include a UE Location order indicator into the Analytics Filter when
it would like to request/subscribe the UE Mobility Analytics in a UE Location
order.
NWDAF:
\- When NWDAF receives a UE location order indicator in the Analytics Filter
to request/subscribe the UE Mobility Analytics:
\- Alt#1, the NWDAF adds a list of timestamps or orders for each UE location
in the \"> UE location (1..max)\" during the current \"duration\" parameter.
\- Alt#2, NWDAF does not aggregate the UE locations in a long duration but
provides the UE location one by one in their own time period, i.e. the \"UE
location (1..max)\" in the UE Mobility analytics has only one UE location
which indicates the UE is located in this UE location in the duration from the
time slot start.
## 6.27 Solution #27: Relative Proximity Analytics
### 6.27.1 Description
In Rel-17, NWDAF location analytics are only available with the coarse
resolution of Tracking Area (TA) level or cell level, so KI#9 description in
clause 5.9 requests solutions for location analytics with finer granularity.
Furthermore, location information is mainly related to the absolute
positioning of a UE and relative proximity of a UE versus other UEs is
currently lacking in input data acquired by the NWDAF or the output data
provisioned by the NWDAF. Relative proximity information can thus be leveraged
by NWDAF to provide location information with finer granularity than TA/cell.
In this solution, we propose a set of possible procedures for the NWDAF to
assist a consumer NF to more accurately localize a cluster (or a set) of UEs
via provisioning statistics or prediction information related to their
relative proximity. For example, this analytics type may help the consumer
improve the location estimation accuracy of a UE by using proximity
information from nearby UEs, or it may help the consumer identify UEs in the
vicinity of another UE.
In addition, information on the relative proximity of two or more UEs can be
leveraged by different vertical use cases such as V2X and smart factories to
enhance performance and safety requirements in scenarios with moving physical
objects such as cars, Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) or factory robots equipped
with UE connectivity. This solution proposes the introduction of time to
collision (TTC) information as part of relative proximity analytics,
indicating statistics and predictions of the time it would take for the UE(s)
acting as target of analytics reporting to collide with another UE. Similar to
other analytics described in TS 23.288 [5], this solution describes input data
(see Tables 6.27.1-1 and 6.27.1-2), output analytics in the form of statistics
and predictions (see Tables 6.27.1-3 and 6.27.1-4), and procedures (see clause
6.27.2) to support relative proximity analytics.

### 6.27.2 Procedures
Figure 6.27.2-1: Procedure for delivery of relative proximity analytics
1\. The Consumer NF or AF sends a request to the NWDAF for analytics related
to relative proximity, using either the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription service.
The Analytics ID is set to \"Relative Proximity\". The target for analytics
reporting can be a single UE, group of UEs (e.g. UE1 and UE2 in Figure
6.27.2-1) or any UE. Analytic filters are set to indicate the proximity range
or other criteria to be considered for relative proximity. This can be in the
form of an area of interest, specific directions of interest, a ranging
distance, a predefined geographic area, or other forms of indication. Other
analytics filters can also be set to indicate a minimum or maximum number of
UEs to be accounted for relative positioning. Other attributes can be also
indicated as part of analytics filters, e.g. defining certain velocity,
average speed, orientation or mobility trajectory to be accounted for relative
positioning. Furthermore, analytics filters can be set to indicate S-NSSAI,
DNN, analytics target period or preferred level of accuracy of the analytics.
The Consumer NF can request statistics or predictions or both for a given time
window.
2-5. If the request is authorized, and in order to provide the requested
analytics, the NWDAF may subscribe to OAM services to retrieve relevant
information to proximity analytics. The NWDAF may collect MDT input data per
individual UE from OAM. An example set of information to be provided to the
NWDAF is defined in Table 6.27.1-1.
6-7. For relative proximity information, if the request is authorized, and in
order to provide the requested analytics, NWDAF may follow the UE Input Data
Collection Procedure via the DCAF. DCAF may collect proximity related input
data directly from the UE Application, and determine a list of UEs fulfilling
certain proximity criterion.
NOTE 1: The UE data collection procedure should be based on clause 6.2.8 of TS
23.288 [5].
NOTE 2: Different Application IDs of the same DCAF or different DCAFs may be
selected for different UEs, since each DCAF can only determine the proximity
information for the UEs that have PDU session between UE and DCAF.
The NWDAF subscribes to the AF services as above invoking either
Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe for untrusted DCAF or Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe
service for trusted DCAF with (Event ID = Relative Proximity, Event Filter
information, Target of Event Reporting). The target of event reporting and /
or Event Filter information is set according to the target of analytics
reporting and / or analytics filters set during the step 1 of the procedure.
Event filters can be defined for relative proximity to indicate to DCAF on how
to process the data from individual UEs to determine the set of UEs to be
accounted for relative proximity.
In the case of a trusted DCAF, the NWDAF may provide the Area of Interest,
proximity range, predefined geographical area, or other criteria to the DCAF
on the resolution of TAIs or any other finer resolution recognizable by the
5GC. In the case of an untrusted DCAF, NEF translates the requested criteria
provided as event filter by the NWDAF into geographic zone identifier(s) or
other geographic range identifier(s) or geographic direction identifier(s)
that act as event filter(s) for the DCAF.
The DCAF may process (e.g. anonymize, aggregate and normalize) the data from
individual UEs based on Event Filters indicated by the NWDAF to determine the
set of UEs to be accounted for relative proximity before notifying that
directly (trusted DCAF) or via NEF (for untrusted DCAF) to the NWDAF. An
example set of information to be provided to the NWDAF is defined in Table
6.27.1-2.
NOTE 3: It needs to be confirmed with SA WG4 the feasibility of whether DCAF
can collect the proximity related input data in Table 6.27.1-2 and apply the
required processing described in steps 6-7 for input data delivery to NWDAF.
8\. The NWDAF collects input data from AMF as defined in Table 6.27.1-3 via
the AMF event exposure service.
NOTE 4: Step 8 could be performed before step 6 if DCAF cannot determine the
set of UEs fulfilling a proximity criterion.
9\. The NWDAF collects input data from the LCS system as defined in Table
6.27.1-3.
10\. The NWDAF collects input data from AF as defined in Table 6.27.1-3 via
the SMF event exposure service.
11\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics.
12\. The NWDAF provide requested relative proximity and TTC information to the
consumer NF or AF along with the corresponding Validity Period or any Validity
Area, Validity Direction of interest or ranging distance, using either the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe response, depending on the service used
in step 1. An example set of information to be provided to the consumer NF or
AF from the NWDAF is defined in Table 6.27.1-3 and Table 6.27.1-4.
13-15. If at step 1 the consumer NF or AF has subscribed to receive continuous
reporting of relative proximity information, the NWDAF may generate new
analytics and, when relevant according to the Analytics target period and
Reporting Threshold, provide them along with the corresponding Validity Period
(or any Validity Area, Validity Direction of interest or ranging distance) to
the consumer NF or AF.

## 6.28 Solution #28: Detect and Improve correctness of NWDAF analytics
### 6.28.1 Description
The quality of an NWDAF machine-learning model may affect the NF performance
or status, according to the usage of an NWDAF analytics and the decisions they
make with them. A not reliable (or not well-trained) analytics ID may not help
a NF to make a precise or correct decision, which may has impact on aspects of
network performance. Hence, it is important to identify when an analytics ID
requires improvement. This allows a network the NWDAF inference to keep
providing an analytics ID output to one or more NWDAF consumers, which leads
to a stable network status. In addition, this enables supporting an NWDAF
training to become aware of problems in the configuration and/or generation of
an analytics ID, which could lead to an unstable network status.
NWDAF derives statistics and/or predictions, based on requests by analytics
consumers. The statistics outputs can be considered more accurate than
prediction outputs. Hence, correctness improvement analysis can focus on the
prediction outputs of NWDAF analytics.
For the detection of a need for correctness of an analytics ID it is needed to
introduce Analytics ID performance information, which could be derived by:
a) Comparing the predicted outputs of an Analytic ID with the real value (i.e.
ground truth) of that analytic ID. For instance, the Mean Absolute Error of
the predicted analytics ID could be used as an example Analytics ID
performance information, and/or
b) Measuring the impact of the decision of a NF that uses predicted outputs of
an Analytic ID. The impact can be calculated according to the change of
relevant KPIs of the NF, after the enforcement of a decision that was made,
based on a predicted output of an Analytic ID. For example, the Analytics ID
performance information can be defined per Analytics ID from the NF who
measures the impact of the decision of a NF that uses predicted outputs of the
Analytic ID
Some examples as the following:
\- Analytics ID=\"Service Experience\" used by PCF to adjust the QoS
parameters for an application or NSSF/AMF to control the number of UEs or PDU
Sessions in a network slice: Increased or Decreased service experience value
per UE per Application ID from AF;
\- Analytics ID=\"UE Mobility\" used by AMF to adjust the paging strategy:
Increased or Decreased number of paging signalling per UE from AMF;
\- Analytics ID=\"Network Performance\" used by PCF to determine the BDT
policy: Increased or Decreased Radio Resource Utilization per RAN from OAM.
NOTE 1: In addition to the Analytics ID performance information feedback by
others NF, the NWDAF itself may also evaluate the Analytics ID performance
based on the continuous input data from the data sources e.g. the continuous
service data as defined in Table 6.4.2-1 for the Analytics ID = \"Service
Experience\".
The above-mentioned Analytics ID performance information is to indicate the
execution result of a decided action based on the effect of the analytics ID.
It can be calculated at NWDAF by using the analytics IDs statistics outputs.
For instance, the predictions of an Analytics ID will be become the statistics
of the respective analytics ID in a future point of time. If the relevant KPIs
of the NF are in the statistics outputs of another analytics ID which reflects
the effects of the action taken by the NF based on the prediction, the NF
making decisions may provide the NWDAF the relationship between the above-
mentioned Analytics ID performance information and the statistics outputs of
the analytics ID (i.e. another analytics ID mentioned above). In this case,
the NWDAF calculates the Analytics ID performance information according to the
statistics outputs of the analytics ID specified by the NF making decisions
based on the prediction.
Alternatively or in conjunction with the NWDAF, the above-mentioned Analytics
ID performance information can also be provided by a NF that makes decisions
and/or applies decided actions via a feedback, based on the prediction of the
analytics ID. The feedback can indicate the execution result of a decided
action based on the effect of the predicted analytics ID. For instance,
Analytics ID which reflects the effects of the action taken by the NF based on
the prediction, the NF making decisions may compare the result with the
decision made based on the statistics outputs of the analytics ID and
indicates \"good/hit\" or \"not good/hit\" to the NWDAF.
In detail, the monitoring of network analytics correctness needs to identify
the sources of data collection for the KPIs and/or metrics related to the
Analytics ID performance information. And then to start the data collection
from these data sources. The monitoring functionality in Consumer NF or NWDAF
itself can provide following Analytics ID performance information of each
Analytics ID to the NWDAF with a tracing function:
\- Analytic ID.
\- List of Output analytics (Optional): identification of the analytics output
information for the analytics ID that were consumed in the interval of time
for the following grade information calculation.
\- Analytics ID Grade Information: information resulting from the calculation
of a grade related to the effect of an analytics on the changes in network
status after the consumption of analytics. For example, it can be a real
number between 1 and -1, where:
\- 0 indicates that the consumption of the analytics ID had no significant
effect on the expected network status pattern.
\- 1 indicates \"hit\", i.e. the consumption of the analytics ID had
significant positive effect in the expected network status pattern (e.g.
improved the pattern of the KPIs) or a stable/good network performance. Hence,
there is no need for further improvement/optimisation of the respective
Analytics ID.
\- 1 indicates \"not hit\" i.e. the consumption of the analytics ID had
significant negative effect in the expected network status pattern (e.g.
degraded the pattern of the KPIs) or not good network performance. In that
case the improvement of the respective Analytics ID may be checked.
\- Unstable Analytics ID Information: information resulting from the
calculation of a grade related to the effect of an analytics on the changes in
network status after the consumption of analytics and identifying that this
grade as crossing, deviating from thresholds (e.g. thresholds configured by
operator) that denote an analytics has been identified as leading to unstable
network status.
NOTE 2: Either Analytics ID Grade Information or Unstable Analytics ID
Information is included in the Analytics ID performance information.
The NWDAF with a tracing function can associate information of the quality of
usage of the analytics ID (i.e. Analytics ID performance information), and the
internal configuration (e.g. amount of the collected data to train, the
configuration of machine learning model and so on) for an analytics ID in a
period. The NWADF can keep information about last known Analytics ID
performance information states, which is stable at a given point in time when
using a given analytics with the most appropriated configuration.
The activation of the tracing and the monitoring of an analytics ID can
happen:
\- with the subscription request of the analytics ID by the analytics consumer
that is provided to the NWDAF. The request can include information to indicate
that the tracing of an analytics ID needs to be started, optionally together
with information about the criteria of the correctness of the analytics ID by
the analytics consumer. The criteria of correctness includes the acceptable
threshold of Analytics ID performance information and the corresponding
correctness evaluation. Based on the criteria, the NWDAF can calculate the
Analytics ID Grade Information of the corresponding analytics ID.
\- or by the NWDAF itself.
According to the outputs of tracing and monitoring of an analytics ID, e.g. if
the analytics ID is unstable (i.e. low performance), the NWDAF needs to
refresh the output of the analytic ID and can decide and provide notifications
for actions at the Inference and/or the Training functions. The quality of the
NWDAF analytics is affected by various factors e.g. the quality and amount of
the collected data to train, the configuration of machine learning model etc.
Example actions at the Inference Function (AnLF) include:
\- Changing an inference configuration of an analytics ID.
\- Selecting a new analytics model of an analytics ID.
\- Deactivate an analytics model of an analytics ID.
Example actions at the Training Function (MTLF) include:
\- Changing a training configuration of an analytics ID.
\- Perform retraining or reselection of an analytics model of an analytics ID.
\- Deactivate an analytics model of an analytics ID.
The NWDAF can use stored information during tracing of an analytics ID (e.g.
on successful configurations of MTLF or AnLF) that have led to a stable or
good network status for an analytics consumer, in case that an improvement
decision of an analytics ID has been initiated. This information can help the
NWDAF in its improvement decision and select improvement action.
The Inference Engine (AnLF) can provide Notifications to the analytics
consumers, when it is identified that an analytics ID is unstable or needs
improvement or is stable again:
\- A notification for the analytics ID that is unstable (i.e. low
performance).
\- A status notification that an analytics ID that is stable (i.e. high
performance) and the refreshed output of the Analytic ID.
\- A cooling duration indicates NWDAF needs more time to refresh the output of
the Analytic ID. The consumer NF can re-request the same Analytic ID after the
cooling duration.
This notification can help the NFs to decide whether they can continue
consuming the specific analytics ID (that requires improvement).
### 6.28.2 Procedures
Figure 6.28.2-1: Procedure to monitor and improve the correctness of NWDAF
analytics
1\. The analytics consumer subscribes to the NWDAF service by invoking the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request service
operation and provides an indication that the tracing of an analytics ID needs
to be started, optionally together with information about the criteria of the
correctness of the analytics ID consumed by the analytics consumer. The NWDAF
may indicate the analytics consumer or Decision Enforcement NF (via the
analytics consumer) to provide feedback to the NWDAF (AnLF) about the
performance information of the corresponding analytics ID in the response
message.
2\. The NWDAF (AnLF), generates the analytics output, according to the
requested analytics ID and provides the notifications to analytics consumer,
by invoking Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify service operation (as presented in clause
6.1, TS 23.288 [5])
3\. The analytics consumer (NF) may use the received analytics outputs to make
decisions that can be applied (or executed) either directly by the same NF
(i.e. the analytics consumer) or the analytics consumer (NF) may use the
received analytics outputs to make decisions that can be applied by another NF
(i.e. Decision Enforcement NF) e.g. when the analytics consumer is PCF.
4\. In the case that the monitoring of the correctness of an analytics ID has
been initiated then performance information of the corresponding analytics ID
are calculated within the NWDAF and/or with the support of involved NFs.
4a. The NWDAF can calculate performance information of the analytics ID by
deriving statistics of same (i.e. predicted) analytics ID and/or statistics of
(one or more other) analytics ID that reflect the effects of the action taken
by the NF based on the predicted outputs according to the criteria of the
correctness of the analytics ID. The NWDAF collects data from the analytics
consumer (NF) and/or the Decision Enforcement NF to generate the output of the
tracing Analytics ID.
4b. The analytics consumer (NF) can provide the feedback to the NWDAF (AnLF)
about the performance information of the corresponding analytics ID,
optionally by receiving information by a Decision Enforcement NF (if
involved). The analytics consumer NF or the Decision Enforcement NF, can
provide feedback of the execution result (e.g. based on changes of relevant
KPIs of the NF) of a decided action based on the effect of the predicted
analytics ID.
5\. The NWDAF (AnLF) detects whether there is need for improvement of an
Analytics ID, which is leading to unstable network status. By comparing
monitored analytics ID performance information with the criteria of the
correctness of an analytics ID (i.e. that have been provided by the analytics
consumer or set in the NWDAF), the NWDAF calculate the Analytics ID grade
information. The NWDAF will decide whether the correction is needed according
to the Analytics ID grade information. The unstable Analytics ID information
already known are also taken into account.
The NWDAF (AnLF) can also associate the Analytics ID performance information,
and the internal configuration for an analytics ID, via a tracing function
included in the NWDAF (AnLF). The NWDAF (AnLF) can keep information about last
known stable the Analytics ID performance information, which isstable at a
given point in time when using a given analytics with the most appropriated
configuration. The above can facilitate the decision making of the improvement
process.
6\. In the case that the need for correctness of analytics ID has been
detected then an improvement process should be initiated. The decision for
improvement of the unstable analytics ID at the NWDAF can be made using
analytics ID performance information. The specific improvement action that
will be triggered is an internal decision of the NWDAF and can involve the
AnLF and/or the MTLF.
\- Example actions at the Inference Function (AnLF) could be: change an
inference configuration of an analytics ID, selecting a new analytics model of
an analytics ID, Deactivate an analytics model of an analytics ID.
\- Example actions at the Training Function (MTLF) could be: changing a
training configuration of an analytics ID, perform retraining or reselection
of an analytics model of an analytics ID, deactivate an analytics model of an
analytics ID.
The NWDAF can use stored information during tracing of an analytics ID (e.g.
on successful configurations of MTLF or AnLF) that have led to a stable or
good network status for an analytics consumer to support an improvement
decision for an analytics ID.
7\. A notification to the consumer of the NWDAF analytics ID is provided, when
it is identified that an analytics ID is unstable or needs improvement. The
notification message can include:
\- a notification for the analytics ID that is unstable (i.e. low
performance);
\- a status notification that an analytics ID that is stable (i.e. high
performance) and the refreshed output of the Analytic ID;
\- a cooling duration indicates NWDAF needs more time to refresh the output of
the Analytic ID. The consumer NF can re-request the same Analytic ID after the
cooling duration.
### 6.28.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
NWDAF:
\- Monitor the correctness of an analytics ID, calculating performance
information of an analytics ID.
\- Tracing correctness of an analytics ID and detect whether there is need for
improvement of an Analytics ID.
\- Decide and apply appropriate action for the improvement of an Analytics ID.
\- Provide notification to the consumer of an analytics ID, when it is
identified that an **analytics ID is unstable or needs improvement.**
Consumer NFs:
\- Indicate that the tracing of an analytics ID needs to be started, providing
(optionally) information about the criteria of the correctness of the
analytics ID.
\- Provide feedback to the NWDAF about the performance information of an
analytics ID on the execution result (e.g. based on changes of relevant KPIs
of the NF) of a decided action based on the effect of the predicted analytics
ID.
Decision Enforcement NFs:
\- Provide feedback to the NWDAF or to the Consumer NF about the performance
information of an analytics ID and the execution result (e.g. based on changes
of relevant KPIs of the NF) of a decided action based on the effect of the
predicted analytics ID.
## 6.29 Solution #29: Detection of ML Model degradation and actions
### 6.29.1 Description
This is a solution for KI#1, on how to improve correctness of NWDAF analytics
and addresses the following item in this KI:
\- How and which information is needed to enhance the ML model provisioning to
improve the correctness of NWDAF Analytics.
\- Study mechanisms to detect that degradation on an ML model has happened and
whether and which actions should be triggered.
In current ML model provisioning procedure defined in TS 23.288 [5], an NWDAF
containing MTLF provides a trained ML model to an NWDAF containing AnLF which
invokes the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe towards the NWDAF containing
MTLF.
However, the accuracy of the trained ML model when used for analytics, e.g.
accuracy level or confidence of the predictions using the trained ML model,
may not meet the analytics requirement(s) of the NWDAF containing AnLF
according to the analytics request(s)/subscription(s) from analytics consumer
NF(s). Also the accuracy of the trained ML model may diminish, due to e.g.
changes of network status and changes of UE communication patterns, etc.
This solution considers two aspects of the ML Model degradation problem:
\- Detection of the degradation of an ML model.
\- Triggering of a proper action in case any degradation in an ML model is
observed.
The trained ML model needs to be updated by the NWDAF containing MTLF in order
to guarantee or improve the correctness of analytics by the NWDAF containing
AnLF. Hence, a solution of enhancing existing ML model provisioning procedure
is proposed, so that the NWDAF containing MTLF can detect the degradation of
an ML model, update the ML model towards the NWDAF containing AnLF accordingly
and thus improve the correctness of NWDAF analytics.
### 6.29.2 Procedures
#### 6.29.2.1 General
The proposed solution consists of two main parts:
\- How to detect whether an ML model has been degraded.
\- Trigger proper action in case ML model degradation has been observed.
Each part is discussed in the following (sub)clauses.
#### 6.29.2.2 Detection of ML Model Degradation
Figure 6.29.2.2-1 illustrates an NWDAF containing AnLF registering to an NWDAF
containing MTLF its monitoring capability for the determining the accuracy of
the ML model. Then, the NWDAF containing MTLF subscribes to the NWDAF
containing AnLF for the monitoring of an ML model. If the accuracy of an ML
model is not sufficient, or if degradation in the ML model is detected, the
NWDAF containing AnLF generates a notification to the NWDAF containing MTLF.
In this solution, the NWDAF containing AnLF may start the accuracy monitoring
process when it starts making use of an ML model, and it registers with the
MTLF that is responsible for training/updating this ML model. The NWDAF
containing MTLF, due to the registration of accuracy monitoring from NWDAF
containing AnLF or due to local policies, subscribes to the NWDAF containing
AnLF for receiving notifications of the detection of degradation of the ML
Model.
When the subscription request is received, the NWDAF containing AnLF is
assumed to be in possession of possible ML model\'s associated information,
included in the ML model file, that can be used to support the AnLF performing
the accuracy monitoring of the ML model. The NWDAF containing AnLF may start
the accuracy monitoring process when it starts making use of the ML model.
NWDAF containing AnLF monitors the accuracy of the ML model and notifies NWDAF
containing MTLF if any degradation is detected.
Figure 6.29.2.2-1: Monitoring an ML model and report degradation if detected
#### 6.29.2.3 Act Upon ML Model Degradation
In the case of detecting low accuracy of an ML model which has been monitored,
an NWDAF containing AnLF notifies the subscribed NWDAF containing MTLF. The
NWDAF containing MTLF may not declare an ML model as \"degraded\" until enough
degradation detection notifications have been received. When the NWDAF
containing MTLF determines that an ML model is \"degraded\", it marks it with
an indication in the ML model information (see TS 23.288 [5] clause 6.2A.2 for
existing contents).
It is then up to the NWDAF containing MTLF to determine the actual actions to
be taken. These actions include, e.g.:
\- Trigger a re-training process with an extended data set, including that the
NWDAF containing MTLF may need to collect new data (e.g. statistics) from,
e.g. ADRF.
\- In case of existing more than one ML model for an Analytics ID, based on
the records of ML model accuracy metrics, another ML model might be chosen
without re-training any of the existing ML models.
#### 6.29.2.4 Procedure for the registration of ML model monitoring
Figure 6.29.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure by which an NWDAF containing AnLF
registers with an NWDAF containing MTLF that it is starting to monitor the
accuracy of an ML model. A new Nnwdaf_MLModelMonitor_Register service
operation is used for that purpose.
Figure 6.29.2.4-1: Procedure for ML model monitoring registration
1\. An NWDAF containing AnLF starts monitoring the accuracy of an ML model,
due to start using the ML model for producing analytics.
2-3. The NWDAF containing AnLF sends an Nnwdaf_MLModelMonitor_Register request
to an NWDAF containing MTLF (NWDAF containing AnLF NF ID, unique identifier of
the ML model, optionally subscription endpoint of the ML Monitoring service
operation). The NWDAF containing MTFL is now aware of the NF ID of the NWDAF
containing AnLF that are monitoring the accuracy of that ML model.
When the NWDAF containing AnLF does no longer monitor the accuracy of the ML
model, it sends an Nnwdaf_MLModelMontior_Unregister service operation. The
NWDAF containing MTLF deletes the associated data.
#### 6.29.2.5 Procedure for the detection of ML model degradation
Figure 6.29.2.5-1 illustrates the procedure for the detection of ML model
degradation. A new Nnwdaf_MLModelMonitor_Subscribe and
Nnwdaf_MLModelMonitor_Notify service operations are used for that purpose. An
NWDAF service consumer, i.e. an NWDAF containing MTLF, subscribes at another
NWDAF, i.e. an NWDAF containing AnLF, to be notified when the accuracy of the
previously provisioned trained MT model is not sufficient.
Figure 6.29.2.5-1: Procedure for ML model degradation detection
0\. An NWDAF containing MTLF receives a trigger for subscribing to the ML
model monitor at an NWDAF containing an AnLF. This trigger could be the
reception of an Nnwdaf_MLModelMonitor_Register request, an administrative
action, or determined by local policy. The NWDAF containing MTLF reads the
information registered by the AnLF, such as the NF ID, unique identifier of
the ML model, MLModelMonitor subscription endpoint, etc.
1\. The NWDAF containing MTLF sends an Nnwdaf_MLModelMonitor_Subscribe request
(Analytics ID, unique identifier of the ML model to be monitored, optionally
Reporting Threshold(s)) to an NWDAF containing AnLF subscription endpoint.
2\. The NWDAF containing AnLF sends a response to the NWDAF containing MTLF.
3\. NWDAF containing AnLF starts an internal process for monitoring the
accuracy of the ML model.
NOTE: NWDAF containing AnLF can monitor the accuracy in many ways: e.g. get
ground truth value of the predictions, subscribe to NF events that related to
the analytics ID, or following the instructions embedded in the model from the
MTLF, etc.
4,5 Upon detection of an insufficient accuracy of the ML model, and if
deviation (i.e. deviation of the output analytics using the trained ML model
from the actual network running data) is greater than the Reporting
Threshold(s) if received in the Subscribe, the NWDAF containing AnLF sends an
Nnwdaf_MLModelMonitor_Notify request to the notification endpoint (e.g. the
NWDAF containing MTLF). The Notify request should include a Deviation value.
6\. The NWDAF containing MTLF sends a response indicating that it has received
ML model monitor notification from respective instance of NWDAF containing
AnLF.
7\. The NWDAF containing MTLF adds an indication to the ML Model Information
as \"degraded\".
8\. The NWDAF containing MTLF takes an appropriate action. This can be, e.g.
re-training the ML model with additional data.
#### 6.29.2.6 Procedures for ML Model Provisioning
Model provisioning is affected by the proposed solution in a way that
provisioning can be postponed if an action might be required, in case of
detection of an ML model degradation.
When NWDAF containing MTLF receives a subscription request from a NWDAF\'s
service consumer for ML model provision, upon accepting the subscription, the
NWDAF containing MTLF generates a regular notification request including the
required ML model information including an indication of the \"degraded\"
status.
Figure 6.29.2.6-1 shows an enhanced procedure for signalling whether a model
is degraded.
Figure 6.29.2.6-1: Procedure for enhanced ML model provisioning
1\. An ML Model Provisioning service consumer (i.e. an NWDAF containing AnLF)
sends an Nnwdaf_MLModelProvisioning_Subscribe request for subscribing to a
(set of) ML models associated to a (set of) Analytics ID.
2\. The NWDAF containing MTLF sends a response.
3,4. Prior to sending a notification, the NWDAF containing MTLF determines
whether the model is marked as \"degraded\". Then the NWDAF containing MTLF
sends an Nnwdaf_MLModelProvisioning_Notify request (ML model Information,
including the file address of the trained ML model and its \"degradation\"
indication status).
5,6. The NWDAF containing AnLF sends a response and determines, based on the
\"degraded\" indication in the ML Model information, whether it still wants to
download the ML model or not.
7\. Later, the NWDAF containing MTLF finishes the re-training and a new ML
model becomes available. The MTLF clears the \"degraded\" indication of the ML
Model Information.
8\. The NWDAF containing MTLF sends an Nnwdaf_MLModelProvisioning_Notify
request (ML Model Information, addresses of the file address of the trained ML
model).
9\. The service consumer acknowledges NWDAF containing MTLF by sending back
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify response.
The ML Model Information (including the new \"degraded\" indication) is also
available through the Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request service operation.
### 6.29.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality

actions may include, starting a procedure for re-training the degraded ML
model.

## 6.30 Solution #30: Improve correctness of NWDAF analytics
{#solution-30-improve-correctness-of-nwdaf-analytics .list-paragraph}
### 6.30.1 Description
This is a solution for Key Issue #1: \"How to improve correctness of NWDAF
analytics\".
After MTLF providing one or multiple ML models related to an analytics ID to
the AnLF, based on some specific monitoring mechanism, the analytics
correctness for the one model or multiple models can be evaluated by the AnLF
or MTLF. The analytics correctness evaluation result (e.g. Accuracy in Use or
MAE in Use, etc.) will be obtained or reported to the MTLF meanwhile with the
model usage scope for each model, which indicates the target scope (area, DNN,
S-NSSSAI and target UE(s)) the model is used in the real network.
By updating the model repeatedly, or choosing from the multiple models, the
MTLF will get a model with good enough performance e.g. according to analytics
correctness evaluation result (e.g. Accuracy in Use or MAE in Use, etc.). The
MTLF stores the model information with and its corresponding model usage
scope.
When the same AnLF (e.g. due to abnormal loss of model information) or some
other AnLF subscribes a trained ML model to the MTLF, if the requested
analytics ID and model filter information matches with the model information,
then the MTLF provides it to the requested AnLF.
### 6.30.2 Procedures
#### 6.30.2.1 Procedures for improving model performance based on analytics
correctness evaluation of one candidate model
Figure 6.30.2-1: procedures for improving model performance based on analytics
correctness evaluation of one candidate model
1\. The NWDAF containing AnLF1 subscribes to a trained ML model associated
with an Analytics ID and model filter information by invoking
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe or Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Request service
operation as defined in TS 23.288 [5].
The NWDAF containing MTLF provides a matched ML model information by invoking
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify or Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Response service
operation.
2\. The NWDAF containing AnLF1 retrieves analytics based on the obtained ML
model and provides the analytics result to the analytics NF consumer, which is
described in TS 23.288 [5].
During the analytics inference procedure and analytics usage procedure in the
real network, the analytics correctness can be evaluated by the AnLF1 or MTLF,
e.g. based on monitoring mechanism defined in the solution 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 or
others. The analytics correctness evaluation result (e.g. Accuracy in Use or
MAE in Use, etc.) will be obtained or reported to the MTLF as well with the
model usage scope, which indicates the target scope (area, DNN, S-NSSSAI and
target UE(s)) the model is used in the real network.
NOTE: how does the AnLF and MTLF evaluate analytics correctness should depend
on the conclusion of KI#1.
3\. If the analytics correctness is low and doesn\'t achieves the configured
goal, then the MTLF will reselect a new ML model or retrain the provided ML
model for the corresponding model usage scope.
4\. The NWDAF containing MTLF provides a new model or the updated model to the
NWDAF containing AnLF1, with a corresponding model ID, which uniquely
identifies a model instance.
5\. Similar as the step 2, the analytics correctness for the new model or the
updated model can be re-evaluated. And then steps 3-5 will be repeated until
the analytics correctness is well enough as described in step 6.
6\. If the analytics correctness is good enough e.g. based on configuration in
MTLF, then the NWDAF containing MTLF stores the model information and its
corresponding model usage scope.
7\. The NWDAF containing AnLF1(e.g. due to abnormal loss of model information)
or NWDAF containing AnLF2 subscribes to a trained ML model associated with an
Analytics ID and model filter information, which is similar as step 1.
8\. If NWDAF containing MTLF determines the requested analytics ID and model
filter information matches with model filter information and the model usage
scope, then it will perform step 9 to provide the model information to the
AnLF.
9\. The NWDAF containing MTLF provides the matched ML model information
determined in step 8 by invoking Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify or
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Response service operation.
#### 6.30.2.2 Procedures for improving model performance based on analytics
correctness evaluation of multiple candidate models
Figure 6.30.2-2: procedures for improving model performance based on analytics
correctness evaluation of multiple candidate models
1\. The NWDAF containing AnLF1 subscribes to a trained ML model associated
with an Analytics ID and model filter information by invoking
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe or Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Request service
operation as defined in TS 23.288 [5].
If there are multiple candidate models matching with the model request in the
NWDAF containing MTLF, and optionally NWDAF containing AnLF indicates its
support for multiple ML models, then NWDAF containing MTLF provides multiple
matched ML models IDs and corresponding model information by invoking
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify or Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Response service
operation.
2\. For the multiple obtained ML models, the analytics correctness for each
model can be evaluated by the AnLF1 or MTLF, e.g. based on monitoring
mechanism defined in the solution 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 or others. The analytics
correctness evaluation result for each model (e.g. Accuracy in Use or MAE in
Use, etc.) will be obtained or reported to the MTLF as well with the model
usage scope, which indicates the target scope (area, DNN, S-NSSSAI and target
UE(s)) the model is used in the real network.
3\. Based on the received analytics correctness evaluation result for the
multiple candidate ML models, the NWDAF containing MTLF chooses the one(s)
whose analytics correctness is good enough e.g. based on configuration in
MTLF, and stores the model information and the corresponding model usage
scope.
4\. The NWDAF containing AnLF1(e.g. due to abnormal loss of model information)
or NWDAF containing AnLF2 subscribes to a trained ML model associated with an
Analytics ID and model filter information, which is similar as step 1.
5\. If NWDAF containing MTLF determines the requested analytics ID and model
filter information matches with model filter information and the model usage
scope, then it will perform step 6 to provide the model information to the
AnLF.
6\. The NWDAF containing MTLF provides the matched ML model information
determined in step 8 by invoking Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify or
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Response service operation.
### 6.30.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NWDAF containing MTLF:
\- Obtains by itself or from the AnLF the analytics correctness evaluation
result for each model (e.g. Accuracy in Use or MAE in Use, etc.) and the
corresponding model usage scope.
\- Stores the model information with the good enough performance and its
corresponding model usage scope.
\- Provides the model information with good enough performance to the AnLF,
based on the analytics ID, model filter information and model usage scope.
## 6.31 Solution #31: Multiple Analytics outputs based NF action decision
### 6.31.1 Description
This is a solution for Key Issue #1: \"How to improve correctness of NWDAF
analytics\".
When the consumer NF requests analytics for the prediction and willing to
decide the action based on the prediction, there exists a certain risk on
incorrect prediction by NWDAF. Specifically, the NWDAF provides a single
prediction output for a specific analytics target object as specified in
current TS 23.288 [5], the consumer NF only can determine the action based on
the single prediction, even if the single prediction has low probability to
true (e.g. 0.51) but high probability to fail (e.g. 0.49).
In order to minimize the effect of incorrect analytics on NF action, this
solution proposes that NWDAF provides multiple prediction outputs with the
certain probability for the same analytics target object to the consumer NF,
and then, the consumer NF takes an action which considers all the possible
ground truth from multiple analytics outputs.
### 6.31.2 Procedures
Figure 6.31.2-1 depicts the procedures for providing multiple analytics to
consumer NF.
Figure 6.31.2-1: Procedures for providing multiple Analytics outputs
0\. The NWDAF containing AnLF registers the capability to supports multiple
analytics output for the same target object to NRF.
1a-1b. The analytics consumer NF discovers the NWDAF containing AnLF via NRF
by invoking Nnrf_NFDiscovery Request with the indication of multiple analytics
outputs for the same target object, and selects the serving NWDAF from the
candidate NWDAFs.
2a-2b. The analytic consumer NF requests analytics to the NWDAF by invoking
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_reqeust/Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service
operation with the indication of multiple analytics outputs for the same
target object which includes either \"the number of required analytics
outputs\" or \"the lowest probability of analytics\", and then, the NWDAF
provides the multiple outputs (i.e. prediction results) for the same target
object with the probability (i.e. confidence in output parameter) as indicated
by \"the number of required analytics outputs\" or the outputs which has
larger probability than \"the lowest probability of analytics\" for an
Analytics to the analytics consumer NF.
NOTE: The sum of the probability (i.e. confidence in output parameter) for all
the outputs should be less than or equal to 100.
3\. The analytics consumer NF decides an action which considers all the
possible ground truth from multiple analytics outputs.
### 6.31.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NWDAF:
\- NWDAF registers the capability to provide multiple analytics output for the
same target object to NRF.
\- In case prediction, NWDAF provides multiple analytics outputs for the same
target object with each probability in confidence field.
NF:
\- Analytics consumer NF decides an action based on multiple NWDAF analytics
outputs for the same target object.
## 6.32 Solution #32: Enhanced ML model provisioning
### 6.32.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #1 \"How to improve correctness of NWDAF
analytics\".
In current ML model provisioning procedure defined in TS 23.288 [5], an NWDAF
containing MTLF provides a trained ML model to an NWDAF containing AnLF which
invokes the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe towards the NWDAF containing
MTLF.
However, the performance of the trained ML model when used for analytics, e.g.
accuracy level or confidence of the predictions using the trained ML model,
may not meet the analytics requirement(s) of the NWDAF containing AnLF
according to the analytics request(s)/subscription(s) from analytics consumer
NF(s). Also the performance of the trained ML model may degrade, due to e.g.
change of network status / collected network data.
In those cases, the trained ML model needs to be updated by the NWDAF
containing MTLF in order to guarantee or improve the correctness of analytics
by the NWDAF containing AnLF.
Hence, a solution of enhancing existing ML model provisioning procedure is
proposed, so that the NWDAF containing MTLF can detect the performance
requirements or degradation of an ML model, update the ML model towards the
NWDAF containing AnLF accordingly and thus improve the correctness of NWDAF
analytics.
### 6.32.2 Procedures
The procedure in Figure 6.32.2-1 is used by an NWDAF service consumer, i.e. an
NWDAF containing MTLF, to subscribe at another NWDAF, i.e. an NWDAF containing
AnLF, to be notified when the performance of the previously provisioned
trained MT model does not meet the analytics requirements or degrade.
NOTE 1: The service names in the procedure are descriptive and may be updated
where applicable during the normative phase.
Figure 6.32.2-1: Procedure of enhanced ML model provisioning
1\. NWDAF1 containing MTLF provisions the same ML model to NWDAF2 containing
AnLF, NWDAF3 containing AnLF and NWDAF4 containing AnLF based on the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe service operations from those NWDAFs, using
the procedure described in clause 6.2A.1 of TS 23.288 [5]. The NWDAF2
containing AnLF, as well as NWDAF3 containing AnLF, indicated its capability
of providing ML model performance feedback information in the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe service operation.
2a-2b. NWDAF1 containing MTLF decides to subscribe to notifications on the
trained ML model performance. Based on the indicated capability of providing
ML model performance feedback information in the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe service operation, NWDAF1 containing MTLF
invokes the Nnwdaf_MLModelPerformance_Subscribe service operation towards
NWDAF2 containing AnLF and NWDAF3 containing AnLF respectively. The
Nnwdaf_MLModelPerformance_Subscribe contains the Analytics ID(s) associated
with the trained ML Model(s) and optionally Reporting Threshold(s) for trained
ML model performance. Here the Reporting Threshold(s) refers to the average
and/or variance of the deviation of the predictions (i.e. predicted data)
using the trained ML model from the actual network data, in terms of e.g. Mean
Absolute Error or Accuracy.
3a-3b. NWDAF2 containing AnLF (/NWDAF3 containing AnLF) determines
whether/when to send notifications on the performance of trained ML model to
the NWDAF containing MTLF. When NWDAF2 containing AnLF (/NWDAF3 containing
AnLF) detects that the analytics deviation (i.e. deviation of the predictions
using the trained ML model from the actual network data) is greater than the
Reporting Threshold(s) if received in the Nnwdaf_MLModelPerformance_Subscribe
in Step 2, or greater than the Reporting Threshold(s) which is set according
to local policy, NWDAF2 containing AnLF (/NWDAF3 containing AnLF) invokes an
Nnwdaf_MLModelPerformance_Notify service operation towards NWDAF1 containing
MTLF. The Nnwdaf_MLModelPerformance_Notify indicates the analytics deviation
which is greater than the Reporting Threshold(s), and optionally the data set
for the detected deviation when the deviation occurs. The ML model accuracy
(i.e. level of accuracy of the analytics using the trained ML model) may also
be included in the Nnwdaf_MLModelPerformance_Notify. The information contained
in the Nnwdaf_MLModelPerformance_Notify is shown in Table 6.32.2-1.

set, to reduce the size of the notification.
4\. NWDAF1 containing MTLF decides whether update of the trained ML model is
needed, based on the notifications received in step 3a-3b. NWDAF1 containing
MTLF may, if supports, use the ML model performance data in the notifications
as input data to perform analytics on the trained ML model performance, and
decide whether or not to update the trained ML model based on the statistics
and/or predictions of the ML model performance. The information in ML model
performance statistics and predictions is shown in Table 6.32.2-2 and Table
6.32.2-3.

based on the ML model performance data in the notifications from the NWDAF(s)
containing AnLF, though the NWDAF1 containing MTLF does not support network
analytics as described in TS 23.288 [5].
If update of the trained ML model is needed, NWDAF1 containing MTLF retrains
the ML model using the data set (if provided) in the
Nnwdaf_MLModelPerformance_Notify, or using the data collected from 5GC NF(s),
OAM and/or UE application(s).
5a-5c. NWDAF1 containing MTLF notifies NWDAF2 containing AnLF, NWDAF3
containing AnLF and NWDAF4 containing AnLF with the updated trained ML Model
information by invoking Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation, as
described in clause 6.2A.1 of TS 23.288 [5].
NOTE 4: Here without step 2 and step 3 performed towards/by NWDAF4 containing
AnLF, NWDAF1 containing MTLF also updates the trained ML model towards NWDAF4
containing AnLF based on the subscriptions in step 1.
### 6.32.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
NWDAF containing MTLF:
\- Subscribes to notifications of the trained ML model performance feedback
information.
\- Uses the ML model performance data in the notifications as input data to
perform analytics on the trained ML model performance, and decide whether or
not to update the trained ML model based on the statistics and/or predictions
of the ML model performance.
NWDAF containing AnLF:
\- Provides notifications of the trained ML model performance feedback
information to the NWDAF containing MTLF.
## 6.33 Solution #33: Improving correctness of NWDAF analytics by providing
correction information
### 6.33.1 Description
This solution is proposed to address Key Issue #1: how to improve correctness
of NWDAF analytics.
Analytics consumer may not use the analytics as soon as it receives analytics
from NWDAF, while it may use the analytics only when it needs to make a
decision, or the analytics consumer may use the analytics for a period of time
and make several decisions during this time. In this case, there is a time
period between the analytics received and the analytics actually used by the
analytics consumer. Meanwhile, the NWDAF may improve the accuracy of the
analytics or find the provided analytics is incorrect due to various factors
(e.g. update of ML model, reselection of ML model, parameter adjustment, more
data input, etc.) and the improved analytics may have positive impact to
consumer\'s decision. Therefore, it is useful that NWDAF can provide
correction information for provided analytics to the consumer (e.g.
information to update provided analytics, notification of stopping using
provided analytics, incorrect content of provided analytics, etc.).
As described in TS 23.288 [5], analytics consumer may provide preferred level
of accuracy and output strategy, which means accuracy variation within a
certain range may not influence some consumers, therefore, different analytics
consumer should determine whether it receives the correction information and
the time period during which the correction information can be provided. To
reduce signalling load, the frequency and condition of providing correction
information should also be designated by analytics consumer, for example, the
consumer can give a correction threshold, requiring NWDAF to provide
correction information when NWDAF finds the accuracy improved over the
threshold.
This solution proposes that consumers may provide requirement on correction
information in subscription, and NWDAF maintains provided analytics and
provides correction information for the latest provided analytics to the
consumer.
In this solution, the following functionalities are proposed to take into
consideration:
\- Analytics consumer provides following information in subscription if it
requires to receive correction information:
\- Correction time period: defines the time interval during which the
correction information can be accepted by the consumer. It is a relative time
interval as the gap with respect to analytics is provided.
\- Condition of providing correction information: defines the condition when
the correction information can be provided to the consumer, e.g. correction
threshold (when NWDAF finds the accuracy difference between new analytics and
provided analytics exceeding the specified threshold).
\- Preferred correction information form: defines the information form in
which the consumer requires to receive. It can be set as following values:
\- an incorrectness notification: used to notify the consumer provided
analytics is incorrect;
\- an updated analytics: the NWDAF can provide an updated analytics to replace
provided analytics;
\- an error value: NWDAF can provide a delta compared to the provided
analytics.
\- NWDAF maintains provided analytics during correction time period.
\- NWDAF provides correction information for the latest provided analytics to
consumer according to the preferred correction information form in
subscription.
### 6.33.2 Procedures
Figure 6.33.2-1 illustrates the procedure for NWDAF providing correction
information.
Figure 6.33.2-1: Procedures for improving correctness of NWDAF analytics by
providing correction information
1\. The NF (analytics consumer) sends Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe/
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request. This service operation is enhanced with
providing more parameters which include correction time period, condition of
providing correction information (e.g. correction threshold), preferred
correction information form (e.g. incorrectness notification, updated
analytics, etc.), if the NF requires the correction information for provided
analytics.
2\. The NWDAF collects input data and performs analytics as the procedures in
TS 23.288 [5].
3\. The NWDAF sends the analytics output to NF as the procedures in TS 23.288
[5].
4\. The maintenance of provided analytics will be triggered depending on
various factors (e.g. model updated, reselection of ML model, parameter
adjustment, more input data, etc.).
5\. If step 4 occurs within correction time period, NWDAF maintains provided
analytics.
If condition of providing correction information is met, the NWDAF generates
the correction information in preferred correction information form as the
consumer required.
6\. The NWDAF sends the correction information for the latest provided
analytics to NF.
### 6.33.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
NWDAF:
\- Support on maintaining provided analytics.
\- Support on generating correction information for the latest provided
analytics.
Analytics consumer:
\- Support on providing requirement related to correction information in
subscription information.
## 6.34 Solution #34: Enhancing the accuracy of NWDAF Analytics
### 6.34.1 Description
This solution addresses aspects of key issue #1 on how to improve correctness
of NWDAF analytics.
When NWDAF predicts something for the future, it does not monitor/collect
information about the occurrence of the actual event, so it cannot compare the
true observed event with its corresponding previous predictions.
Similarly, consumers requesting an analytics of type \"prediction\" from an
NWDAF, are provided only analytics output/prediction with a confidence
estimated by NWDAF implementation logic. An analytics consumer does not
retrieve an accuracy report related to the prediction or related to earlier
predictions done for the same analytics type and model used (i.e. an accuracy
indication derived from comparing the actual outcome with a previous predicted
value).
To compute the accuracy of analytics, it is necessary to monitor the
performance of the ML model and in case trigger re-training. Depending on the
use case, such operations may require high computational power and large
storage space, and AnLF might not fulfil such requirements. In particular, it
is proposed to let MLTF to execute the ML model monitoring, leveraging the
ADRF to store the necessary analytics and data, that MTLF uses to compute the
accuracy.
Also, this solution proposes to enable the NWDAF containing MTLF to determine
the actual outcome of a prediction, so that it can either:
\- Report in an accuracy report, the outcome to the consumer so the consumer
can compare the outcome with the previously provided prediction; or
\- Compare the outcome with the previous prediction to generate an accuracy
report which the NWDAF containing MTLF provides to the consumer via AnLF.
This solution proposes to re-use existing services to execute the monitoring
in 2 variants:
\- In variant 1 the monitoring is triggered by AnLF, e.g. after receiving an
analytics request from an Analytics consumer that requires also an accuracy
report. In this variant, AnLF instruments the ADRF to collect analytics and
data after a prediction has been made. AnLT indicate to MTLF to retrieve the
stored data, so that it can learn about actual outcomes, compare them with the
predicted data, and generate an accuracy report. The accuracy report comprises
the accuracy for a given analytics subscription or for a given Analytics ID
(e.g. average over all subscriptions for that Analytics ID). The accuracy
report may provide the actual outcomes, or information on how the outcomes
deviate from the predicted values. When aggregated accuracy is provided (e.g.
for all subscriptions to an analytics ID), the accuracy reports may be
provided as a function of the prediction confidence level (i.e. probability
assertion). If an NWDAF makes a prediction with low confidence, one should
expect lower accuracy compared to when the NWDAF makes a prediction with high
confidence. This is reflected in the accuracy reports.
\- In variant 2 the monitoring is triggered by the MTLF itself, and no
coordination with AnLF is needed.
NOTE: The format of the accuracy report depends on the use case and analytics
ID. In general, an accuracy value in given range, e.g. 1 to 10 may be defined.
\- NWDAF Analytics services are enhanced to enable an analytics consumer to
collect a detailed accuracy report from NWDAF (e.g. how well the NWDAF
performed for a specific Analytics ID, using a specific model, for a specific
area/slice(group of)UE, in a given time window).
\- NWDAF registers its measured accuracy (per Analytics ID) in its NF profile
in NRF/UDM, so that analytics consumers can use this information when
selecting the NWDAF instance/set.
\- NWDAF containing MTLF uses the accuracy information to further fine-tune
the model it is using (e.g. trigger model re-training, adjust data sources for
the model training and the analytics generation).
\- The analytics consumer uses the accuracy report provided by NWDAF to manage
the subscription (e.g. if accuracy is low the analytics consumer may terminate
the subscription, adjust subscription parameters, or change the NWDAF, etc.)
and/or to take the actual accuracy into account into local decision making
(e.g. adjust the weight of the analytics reports in the decision making
compared to other inputs).
### 6.34.2 Procedures
#### 6.34.2.1 AnLF-initiated accuracy monitoring
Figure 6.34.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure for measuring and reporting
accuracy of NWDAF analytics initiated by AnLF.
Figure 6.34.2.1-1: Procedure for measuring and reporting accuracy of NWDAF
analytics initiated by AnLF
1\. The (consumer) NF sends Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe request to
an NWDAF containing AnLF with a flag indicating that it is interested in
receiving an accuracy report along with the analytics (prediction) report. The
NFc also provides a callback URI to receive the accuracy report. The NFc may
also send separate processing and filtering instructions for the accuracy
report(s) (e.g. to club or filter the accuracy reports). The NFc may also send
instructions to NWDAF on how to handle the subscription after having
generating accuracy report. For example, the instructions may specify that if
three consecutive predictions are wrong, the NWDAF subscription must be
terminated, and a termination notification will be sent to the NFc.
2\. The NWDAF containing AnLF requests an ML model from the appropriate NWDAF
containing MTLF, including the MonitoringCorrelationID parameter, needed by
MTLF to execute the accuracy monitoring operations.
3\. The NWDAF containing MLTF provides the ML model to the AnLF as per current
specifications.
4\. The NWDAF containing AnLF requests ADRF to subscribe for the collection of
the analytics and data that correspond to the analytics requested by the NFc
in step 1. AnLF uses the procedures defined in Clause 6.2B.3 of TS 23.288,
including the MonitoringCorrelationID.
5\. The ADRF executes the operations defined in Clause 6.2B.3 of TS 23.288 [5]
to subscribe to the analytics and data that correspond to the analytics
requested by the NFc in step 1. ADRF stores the notifications and tags the
received data using the MonitoringCorrelationID.
6\. The NWDAF containing MLTF subscribes to ADRF to retrieve all data tagged
with the MonitoringCorrelationID received from the AnLF
7\. The NWDAF containing MLTF receives the data from the ADRF.
8a-b. (can be executed after step 3). The NWDAF AnLF generates the predictions
and provides them to the NFc.
9\. Based on the collected analytics and data, the MLTF computes the accuracy
using the predictions and the actual measured data observed at the time for
which the prediction had been made.
10\. An accuracy report is sent to the AnLF after the events have occurred
that were needed for the verification of the predictions. The accuracy report
is sent in an MLModelProvision notification from MTLF.
11-11a. The accuracy report is sent to the consumer. The accuracy report may
be sent in a separate notification from AnLF to NFc or it can be clubbed with
the next analytics notification sending predictions of future events. The
frequency of the accuracy notification may be controlled via the
filtering/reporting instruction(s) given in the subscribe request in step 1.
(optional) If, in step 1, an instruction was received on how to handle the
subscription after having terminated the accuracy report, the NWDAF executes
such instruction. For example, NWDAF terminates the subscription if three
consecutive accuracy reports are below a given threshold (e.g. \"no match\")
by sending a termination request.
12\. Based on the computed accuracy, MLTF may decide to re-train the ML model.
13\. When the newly generated ML model is ready, the MTLF notifies the AnLF
about the new ML model instance.
#### 6.34.2.2 MTLF-initiated accuracy monitoring

specifications.

the analytics and data that correspond to the analytics generated by the ML
model provisioned in step 2. MTLF uses the procedures defined in clause 6.2B.3
of TS 23.288 [5].
4\. The ADRF executes the operations defined in clause 6.2B.3 of TS 23.288 [5]
to subscribe to the analytics and data as requested by MTLF. ADRF stores the
notifications.
5\. The NWDAF containing MLTF subscribes to ADRF to retrieve the analytics and
data that correspond to the analytics generated by the ML model provisioned in
step 2.
6\. The NWDAF containing MLTF receives the analytics and data from the ADRF.
7\. Based on the collected analytics and data, the MLTF computes the accuracy
using the predictions and the actual measured data observed at the time for
which the prediction had been made.
8\. An accuracy report is sent to the AnLF after the events have occurred that
were needed for the verification of the predictions. The accuracy report is
sent in an MLModelProvision notification from MTLF.
9\. Based on the computed accuracy, MLTF may decide to re-train the ML model.
10\. When the newly generated ML model is ready, the MTLF notifies the AnLF
about the new ML model instance.

## 6.35 Solution #35: Improve model training and provisioning exploiting sub-
areas with similar statistical properties
### 6.35.1 Description
This solution addresses aspects of key issue #1 on how to improve correctness
of NWDAF analytics.
Knowing the statistical properties of a data set used in AI/ML is important to
understand the behaviour of an ML model. ML models trained on a specific
training data set can be employed on data with similar statistics without
experiencing performance degradation. Different network areas may exhibit
similar context, (e.g. geographical circumstances, network deployment, etc.),
which leads to similar data statistics (data statistics refer to data
distribution, i.e. the information on values - or intervals - of the data such
as network load, interference, how frequent some data values occur, etc.). So,
an AI/ML model trained using data from one network area could be utilized in a
different network area that exhibits similar data statistics.
Furthermore, if multiple AI/ML models are employed in one area, even employed
for different analytics and/or used by different analytics functions,
information on changes in that area can be used by all analytics functions to,
e.g. update their models given that change in the analytics context.
This solution is based on the ability to divide and characterize the network
into sub-areas based on the environment statistical properties instead of a
purely geographical sub-division. This statistical characterization of network
sub-areas is then used to improve the quality of ML model training which
should in turn improve the correctness of the corresponding NWDAF Analytics.
This solution proposes the introduction of the \"Area monitoring analytics
service\", which provides AOI partitioning based on environment statistical
properties and takes as parameters in the service request (see Table 6.35.1-1)
the area of interest (AOI) to be analyzed, the area granularity attribute and
other analytics parameters (e.g. reporting_threshold indicating the threshold
for receiving the reporting, anomaly_description indicating the desired
reporting content). Environment statistical properties aim at representing how
an area is used, and can include density of UEs per area, UE behaviour in the
area such as UE mobility model and UE communication model, etc.
The resulting AOI partitioning into sub-areas with associated sub-area types
detected (i.e. dividing the AOI in multiple sub-area types and associating to
each of them the respective network elements) along with the description of
their statistical properties are stored in the Analytics Area Type Properties
Function (AATPF), that allows the tracking of the discovered sub-area types
and supports their management. The Sub-Area type ID is an identifier to be
assigned to a sub-area and its properties description (area size specified by
area granularity attribute or according to the data distribution) based on its
data statistics.
NOTE: The AATPF can be a standalone function or co-located with NWDAF.
The Area monitoring service can be consumed by OAM. Furthermore, an NWDAF
containing AnLF can be a consumer too, to know the sub-area types in order for
it to re-use and select appropriate ML models.
Table 6.35.1-1 lists the parameters to be included in the service request of
Area monitoring analytics.

### 6.35.2 Procedures
#### 6.35.2.1 Detecting and managing sub-areas using the Area Monitoring
analytics service
In this procedure the NWDAF service consumer subscribes to the Analytics ID
\"area monitoring\". The NWDAF analyzes the expected environment properties
for a set of sub-areas within the AOI(s) provided in the analytics
request/subscription.
Figure 6.35.2.1-1: Procedure for detecting and managing sub-areas using the
Area Monitoring analytics service
Pre-condition: The Analytics Area Type Properties Function (AATPF) stores the
mapping of AOI in sub-areas along with their Sub-Area type IDs assigned and
properties descriptions.
1\. NWDAF service consumer (NF or OAM) subscribes to analytics information. It
sets, among others input parameters (as detailed in TS 23.288 [5], clause
6.1), the Analytics ID to the \"Area Monitoring\" analytics service ID, the
(list of) AOI(s) and, optionally, the area granularity attribute. In addition,
the service consumer may provide a reporting threshold indicating for which
level of environmental properties changes a notification shall be returned and
an anomaly description indicating if it is interested to receive the \"full\"
description of the environment properties or the \"delta\" or \"none\".
2-3. NWDAF subscribes to the AATPF to receive the AOI partitioning, Sub-Area
type IDs and their properties description using the
Naatpf_AreaTypeInfo_Subscription service and receiving as response the
Naatpf_AreaTypeInfo_Notify service operation.
4-5. NWDAF subscribes to the data sources required for the analytics services.
6\. If \"area granularity\" is provided (see table 6.35.1-1), the
classification of each sub-area of the AOI is performed by the NWDAF and their
properties descriptions are generated. Otherwise, if \"area granularity\" is
not provided, the NWDAF determines the sub-areas based on the data statistics.
NWDAF classifies the sub-areas periodically and/or sporadically (e.g. based on
internal/external triggers) based on new data collected.
7-9. (conditional) Whenever new environment properties are discovered, NWDAF
sends to the AATPF, using the Naatpf_RegisterAreaType_Register service, the
AOI partitioning, and the sub-areas properties descriptions generated at step
6. The AATPF assigns new Sub-Area type IDs to the new environment properties
discovered and stores the updated AOI partitioning along with the properties\'
description. In step 9, the AATPF informs the NWDAF that the operation has
been concluded and provides the Sub-Area type IDs associated with the sub-
areas detected. The AATPF may store the \"Expected environment properties\"
for the monitored AOI(s) in some other entity, e.g. the ADRF. Such copy may,
e.g. be used by another NWDAF instance also providing the \"Area Monitoring\"
service for the same/overlapping AOI(s), to recover the information from the
ADRF in case the NWDAF instance is (re-) started, and/or to allow the NWDAF to
compare the current properties with an older version of the \"expected
environment properties\".
10\. NWDAF periodically and/or based on internal/external triggers, keeps
analysing the AOI. If a change in the environment properties is detected (e.g.
the delta of the current environment properties is above a threshold compared
to the earlier properties description), the following steps 11 to 19 are
executed. The NWDAF may also utilize earlier versions of the \"expected
environment properties\" available locally or in the ADRF to determine whether
abnormal environment properties are observed, or, e.g. whether such
environment properties have already been observed in the past (e.g.
periodically every week).
11\. The NWDAF notifies the consumer that an anomaly in a sub-area has been
detected. The NWDAF sets the flag temporary to True to inform the service
consumer that the sub-area could come back to expected environment properties.
12\. The NWDAF monitors the sub-area(s) where the abnormal environment
properties have been detected.
13\. (optional) If the anomaly is still present, the NWDAF periodically
informs the analytics consumer. The notification may include an indication
about the type of the change, e.g.:
\- \"trend\": indicates that with respect to previous properties the delta
might be small (e.g. might be below the reporting threshold), but comparing
with older data a trend can be observed (e.g. the area is getting more busy).
\- \"pattern\": indicates a repeating change of the environment properties
(e.g. observed difference between working days, Saturdays and
Sundays/holidays).
\- \"abnormal/exception\": change above reporting threshold that is not a
\"trend\" or \"pattern\".
The notification may further include the time value since when this change has
been observed, as well as additional information about the change, e.g. the
expected duration, periodicity, estimated future increase for certain values,
etc. Furthermore, the notification includes the impacted sub-areas, their Sub-
Area Type IDs, and the anomaly description if requested.
14\. The NWDAF utilizing the Naatpf_RegisterAreaType_Update service, sends to
the AATRF the abnormal properties descriptions generated with the flag
temporary set to True.
15\. The AATPF acknowledges to the NWDAF that the request has been received.
16\. (conditional) If environment properties return back to the expected
properties or timer T expires, the NWDAF sends an area type update to the
AATPF setting the temporary flag to False.
17\. (conditional) If the AOI environment properties still differ from the
expected ones, the AATPF updates the Sub-Area type IDs and their properties
description.
18\. The AATPF informs the NWDAF about the new Sub-Area Type ID assigned to
the sub-area.
19\. The NWDAF notifies the analytics service consumer about a permanent
deviation from the previous \"expected environment properties\", i.e. the
temporary flag is set to False. The notification may include an indication
about the type of the change, see step 13. Alternatively, if the environment
properties are back to the earlier state, the NWDAF notifies the service
consumer about the end of the abnormal situation.
#### 6.35.2.2 Usage of sub-areas to improve ML model provisioning
Figure 6.35.2.2-1: Procedure for usage of sub-areas to improve ML model
provisioning
Precondition: NWDAFs update their profiles stored at the NRF to include the
Area types managed. AATPF stores the mapping \ and
respective properties description. AATPF is the function deputed to assign
Area type IDs to sub-areas based on their data properties description. It
avoids the usage of multiple Area type IDs for sub-areas with similar data
properties descriptions as well as the usage of the same Area type ID for
different data properties descriptions. NWDAF (MTLF) registers for each AI/ML
model the Area type for which it has been trained.
1\. NWDAF service consumers send a discovery request for NWDAF to NRF
specifying the AOIs and the Analytics ID. If the NWDAF service consumer is
aware about the Area type for which it is interested, it can specify the Area
type in the discovery request.
2\. The NRF returns the list of NWDAFs matching the parameters specified in
the discovery request. Furthermore, the NRF also returns the Area types
supported by each discovered NWDAF.
3\. NWDAF service consumers subscribe to selected NWDAF(s) serving the AOIs
specifying the Area type if known. In case the Area type is not provided (e.g.
not known), the analytics service is requested for all the Area types included
in the AOI.
4\. NWDAFs request to the NWDAF (MTLF) a trained AI/ML model specifying among
others the novel Area type attribute. In this way, AI/ML models trained for
the same area type, but different geographical location, can be used to
produce analytics in the specified AOI.
5\. NWDAF (MTLF) provides to different NWDAFs (managing different AOIs) the
required trained AI/ML models. For NWDAFs requesting a model for the same
Analytics ID in sub-areas assigned to the same Area type ID, NWDAF (MTLF)
deploys the same AI/ML model trained for that Analytics ID for the specific
Area type ID. This allows to use an existing AI/ML model from another AOI but
trained for the same Area type ID even when there is no specific AI/ML model
trained for that AOI. In the case that there is no availability of the AI/ML
model trained for requested Area type ID, the NWDAF (MTLF) may perform the
model training for missing Area type ID by collecting the data from multiple
AOI with the same Area type or with similar data properties in order to have a
richer training dataset.
6\. The NWDAF(s) run the AI/ML models to produce the requested analytics.
7\. NWDAF(s) notify the NWDAF Service Consumer(s) with the analytics reports
requested.

## 6.36 Solution #36: Enhanced provisioning of ML model based on information
about how inference will be executed
### 6.36.1 Description
This solution addresses aspects of key issue #1 on how to improve correctness
of NWDAF analytics.
When an NWDAF acting as service consumer invokes the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe service of an NWDAF containing an MTLF, the
MTLF may perform one of the following:
a) Select an existing trained ML Model to be provisioned.
b) Trigger further training of an existing trained ML model before it is
provisioned.
c) Generate a new ML model to be trained and provisioned.
In cases b) and c), the NWDAF containing MTLF may initiate data collection
from NFs, AF, DCCF, or OAM, required for the training of the ML model.
Therefore, the decision of the MTLF among options a, b, and c can:
i. lead to very different levels of computational load for the NWDAF
containing MTLF.
ii. increase the networking load on the NWDAF containing MTLF as well as on
other Network Functions (NFs), while this increase might highly vary depending
on how many data sources are used.
The decision of the MTLF among options a, b, and c is currently (i.e.
according to Rel.17 specifications) taken by the MTLF based on local,
unspecified logic. Based on the information currently provided in the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe request, even if the \"required accuracy\"
is provided as well, the MTLF may decide in favour of an option that leads to
high computational and networking overhead without any real benefit (i.e. not
really increasing the achieved accuracy during the inference phase at the
NWDAF containing AnLF) compared to another option, which would put less load
on the system.
More concretely, if an NWDAF service consumer subscribes to an NWDAF
containing MTLF for an ML model for a specific type of analytics, the MTLF may
decide that the best option is to perform further training of an existing
model (i.e. option b) or create a new model because it is expected to lead to
higher accuracy (i.e. option c). However, it can happen that the accuracy
achieved when the ML model is later used by the NWDAF containing AnLF is not
higher than the accuracy that would be achieved by an already trained (i.e.
option a). Further, based on how the NWDAF containing AnLF is using the ML
model, the same accuracy might be achieved by a more lightweight version of
the ML model.
According to clause 6.2.1 of TS 23.288 [5], an NWDAF containing AnLF, may:
\- use only a subset of the parameters and/or data sources specified as
allowed input parameter for the analytics ID.
\- use only data from a reduced extend (e.g. duration, scope) of the data
collection.
\- request different sampling ratios and/or partitioning criteria to the data
source.
For example, an NWDAF containing AnLF, might determine to only use UE mobility
information collected from AMF, but not use UE location information provided
by OAM. Then, the NWDAF containing AnLF could use a potentially more
lightweight ML model that was trained only on AMF data, resulting in the same
accuracy of the analytics as when using an ML model that was trained on data
collected from both AMF and OAM.
This solution proposes to exchange and use information related to how
inference will actually take place at the NWDAF analytics consumer once the ML
model has been received. The solution also proposes enhancing and optimizing
the ML model selection and provisioning (i.e. selection of trained model,
trigger further training of an existing ML model, or generate a new model to
be trained) performed by NWDAF containing MTLF.
In this solution, the ML model provisioning request includes inputs about the
data used for inference, such as the actual data sources that will be used for
inference, the granularity of input data that will be used for inference, and
the target environment capacity requirements. Similarly, to assist the AnLF in
selecting the appropriate ML model for inference, the ML model provisioning
response includes information about the data (parameters and data sources)
that have been actually used for the training of the ML model. The new
parameters are described in table 6.36.1-1.
Table 6.36.1-1: Description of new parameters proposed in this solution
Parameter Description
* * *
Data used for inference This parameter provides information on the actual data
sources that will be/have been used for generating the analytics (i.e. for the
inference at the NWDAF containing AnLF). For the data sources to be used (e.g.
AMF and OAM), further information can be provided in order to indicate
specific instances or sets that will be used during inference, or specific
parameters that will be collected from those data sources (e.g. UE location
from AF and Application ID from AF, while all parameters except UE location
from the AMF). > Granularity of input data The granularity of input data that
will be used for inference may be expressed as minimum sampling ratio, maximum
time interval, and/or total number of input values. Data used for training
This parameter provides information on the actual data and data sources that
have been used for the (re-)training of the ML model. It also provides
information on the granularity of the used input data, the extend (e.g.
duration, scope) of the data, the sampling ratio, and the partitioning
criteria, if applicable. > Granularity of input data The granularity of input
data that will be used for inference may be expressed as minimum sampling
ratio, maximum time interval, and/or total number of input values. Target
environment capacity requirements The information about the target environment
capacity requirements includes, e.g. the computational capacity and the memory
that will be available when performing inference with this model.
### 6.36.2 Procedures
Figure 6.36.2-1 illustrates the procedure for enhancing the provisioning of an
ML model based on information about how inference will be executed. The
procedure includes the request of analytics data from an NF service consumer,
which may be the trigger for the provisioning of an ML model from the NWDAF
containing MTLF to the NWDAF that acts as an NF service consumer for ML model
provisioning (i.e. NWDAF containing AnLF).
Figure 6.36.2-1: Procedure for enhanced provisioning of ML model based on
information about how inference will be executed.
1\. The NF consumer subscribes an Analytics ID to an NWDAF containing AnLF,
using the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation.
2\. The NWDAF containing AnLF requests an NWDAF containing MTLF an ML model
that can be used to support the Analytics ID requested in step 1, either
because it has no ML model for this purpose or because the ML model(s) it has
may not perform sufficiently well. Step 2 may be triggered by step 1, but it
may also have been triggered by a different trigger before the execution of
step 1. The request for the ML model is performed by sending an
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe request to the NWDAF containing MTLF with
the addition of the parameters \"data used for inference\", the \"input data
granularity\", the \"target environment capacity requirements\" and the
\"requested accuracy\".
3\. The NWDAF containing MTLF selects an existing trained ML model or creates
a new ML model to be provisioned and determines the level of further training
of the ML model, based on the \"data used for inference\", the \"input data
granularity\", the \"target environment capacity requirements\" and the
\"requested accuracy\" provided in step 2.
4\. The NWDAF containing MTLF determines the training data and data sources
required for (re-)training the ML model determined in step 3 and collects the
data from the determined data source(s). The NWDAF (re-)trains the ML model
using the collected data.
5\. The NWDAF containing MTLF provides to the NWDAF containing AnLF the ML
model using the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe response, with the
additional parameter \"data used for training\" indicating the data and data
sources including the \"input data granularity\" used for the ML model
training.
6\. The NWDAF containing AnLF uses the information received in step 5 to
determine the ML model to use in order to compute the analytics that were
requested in step 1. Then it executes the inference, e.g. based on the
received ML model.
7\. The NWDAF containing AnLF sends to the NF consumer notifications with the
computed analytics for the requested Analytics ID, adding information about
which data and data sources have been used for inference. This information can
be useful in order to determine the level of trust that the analytics consumer
can have in the results received.
8\. The NWDAF containing AnLF determines that a data source to fulfill the
Analytics subscription received in Step 1 has changed.
9\. The NWDAF containing AnLF determines that it no longer needs to receive
notifications about availability of ML models associated to the previous input
data sources.
10\. [Conditional to step 9.] The NWDAF containing AnLF uses the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Unsubscribe service operation to quit the
subscription to ML models.
If a new ML model is required, the procedure restarts from step 2.
### 6.36.3 Impacts on services, entities, and interfaces
The solution has the following impacts:
\- Additional parameters (\"data used for inference\", \"input data
granularity\", \"target environment capacity requirements\" and \"requested
accuracy\") in the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe and
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operations.
\- Additional parameters (data and data sources used for inference) in the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify service operation.
## 6.37 Solution #37: Analytics Exchange in Home routed roaming case
### 6.37.1 Description
This solution is for the Key Issue#3: Data and analytics exchange in roaming
case.
Some principles for the data and analytics exchange in roaming case are
proposed as follows:
\- No raw data exchange is allowed between the H-PLMN and V-PLMN considering
series of factors e.g. data privacy and security, signalling pressure on the
SEPP.
\- Analytics exchange may be allowed between the H-PLMN and V-PLMN:
\- What direction of the analytics exchange and between the H-PLMN and V-PLMN
and which Analytics ID can be exchanged should be dependent on specific use
cases. For example, this solution proposes that the V-NWDAF provides the
service experience analytics to H-PCF to help determine the QoS parameters for
an application; in Solution#11, the H-NWDAF can provide the slice Load level
information to V-NWDAF to help V-AMF for network slice selection.
\- User consent should be checked before the analytics exchange.
NOTE 1: Before conclusion for this solution, the cooperation with SA3 is
needed on how the user consent is checked in roaming scenario and whether the
V-PLMN is aware of user consent or not.
Editor\'s note: It Is FFS to which extent the VPLMN can provide meaningful
analytics for a new inbound roamer without historical data about the roaming
user and with only limited access to input data sources in the HPLMN.
Depending on the results, allowing collection of raw data from VPLMN may be
indispensable.
Editor\'s note: It Is FFS whether raw data aggregation can be an alternative
to analytics to reduce signalling load.
NOTE 2: Before conclusion for this solution, the cooperation with SA3 is
needed on whether data privacy and security issues exist or not when raw data
or analytics is exchanged between the H-PLMN and V-PLMN, and how to solve
potential issues.
Because this solution assumes that no raw data exchange is allowed, so the
H-NWDAF and the V-NWDAF will respectively take the responsibility for data
analytics in their own network and then further exchange the (subâ€‘)analytics
with each other.
To prevent the access of the raw data, this solution proposes that only the
Nnwdaf_Analytics services are allowed between the H-NWDAF and the V-NWDAF.
Take the use case i.e. \"PCF uses service experience as input to calculate and
update the authorized QoS for an application\" as defined in clause 6.1.1.3 of
TS 23.503 [4] as an example, this solution proposes that the H-PCF can adjust
QoS parameters for the application in home routed roaming case based on the
service experience analytics.
In details, for an Application ID, the V-NWDAF and the H-NWDAF firstly derive
the service experience analytics in visited network and the service experience
analytics in home network, respectively. Based on the H-PCF\'s service
experience analytics subscription, the H-NWDAF further subscribes the service
experience analytics in visited network for the application to V-NWDAF, then
the H-NWDAF derives the (E2E) service experience analytics based on the
service experience analytics in visited network and the service experience
analytics in home network and provides it to H-PCF. Finally, H-PCF may use the
E2E service experience as input to calculate and update the authorized QoS for
the application in HR roaming case.
### 6.37.2 Procedures
#### 6.37.2.1 Procedure for the service experience analytics subscription from
H-NWDAF to V-NWDAF
Figure 6.37.2.1-1: Procedure for the service experience analytics subscription
from H-NWDAF to V-NWDAF
1\. PCF firstly determines one or more UEs for an application are in home
routed roaming case, then the PCF in home network subscribes service
experience analytics of an application for these UEs to the H-NWDAF by
triggering the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation. The
parameters included in the service operation are defined in clause 6.4.1 of TS
23.288 [5]. In addition, optionally, a HR roaming indicator and the V-PLMN ID
should be also included in the service operation to help H-NWDAF know that the
UEs are in HR roaming case. Alternatively, the H-NWDAF can also query the UDM
to know that the UEs are in HR roaming case.
2\. H-NWDAF discovers the V-NWDAF by using the V-PLMN ID via NRF and then
subscribes the service experience analytics in the visited network to the
V-NWDAF by triggering the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service
operation. Before subscribing analytics to the V-NWDAF, the H-NWDAF may check
VPLMN specific user consent information from the HPLMN UDM which indicates
whether the user authorizes HPLMN to consume data collected or analytics
generated in the specific VPLMN. If the VPLMN specific user consent
information is not granted, then the H-NWDAF does not perform the step 2 to
obtain data or analytics from VPLMN.
3\. V-NWDAF collects data in the visited network for the UE by using the
procedures as defined in clause 6.2.2 of TS 23.288 [5].
4\. V-NWDAF derives the service experience analytics in the visited network
based on the collected data in visited network.
5\. V-NWDAF provides the service experience analytics in the visited network
to H-NWDAF by triggering the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify service
operation.
6\. H-NWDAF collects data in the home network for the UE by using the
procedures as defined in clause 6.2.2 of TS 23.288 [5]. In the home routed
remaining case, the AF is located in the home network, so it is the H-NWDAF\'s
responsibility to collect the service data from AF.
7\. H-NWDAF derives the service experience analytics in the home network based
on the collected data in home network.
8\. H-NWDAF derives the E2E service experience analytics based on the service
experience analytics in the visited network and the service experience
analytics in the home network.
9\. H-NWDAF provides the service experience analytics for these UEs to the PCF
in home network.
10\. The PCF may adjust the QoS parameters for the application based on the
E2E service experience analytics.
### 6.37.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
H-NWDAF:
\- Supports to accept the service experience analytics subscription request
for UE in home routed roaming case from H-PCF.

analytics collection in VPLMN from the HPLMN UDM before subscribing analytics
to the V-NWDAF.
V-NWDAF:
\- Supports to accept the service experience analytics in the visited network
subscription from H-NWDAF.
## 6.38 Solution #38: Interactions between VPLMN and HPLMN for restricted data
collection and analytics retrieval
### 6.38.1 Description
#### 6.38.1.1 General
Data or analytics exposed to a peer PLMN need to be restricted based on
operator policies, regulatory requirements, roaming agreements, and user
consent.
It is suggested that the NWDAF serves as central entry point for related
requests and authorizes requests and restricts exposed data and analytical
information. New services at the NWDAF allow to invoke those special
authorization and restriction functionality.
The access to other services of the NWDAF, to DCCF services and to exposure
services at other NFs from peer PLMNs can be restricted based on operator\'s
policy by the NRF: The NRF will not providing related access tokens.
The NWDAF is well suited to handle analytics and data collection requests as
it already performs comparable operations. The NWDAF also has existing
capabilities for user consent checking. Using the NWDAF for data collection
also enables usage of the DCCF.
#### 6.38.1.2 HPLMN collecting data from VPLMN
A UE from HPLMN roams in a VPLMN network. NWDAF of HPLMN collects data from
VPLMN NFs. This enables the NWDAF to collect more complete statistics about a
UE or group of UEs by taking into account also data collected while the UE or
group of UEs is roaming in some VPLMN. Data may for instance relate to
locality, mobility and communication of the UEs while roaming in the VPLMN.
Collected data may also enable the HPLMN to provide statistics taking into
consideration the behaviour of UEs subscribed at the HPLMN while roaming,
which in turn enables a VPLMN to optimize the provided service for an inbound
roaming UE.
The H-NWDAF from the HPLMN contacts the V-NWDAF of the VPLMN and asks it to
retrieve data. The V-NWDAF checks if the HPLMN is authorized to request the
data based on operator polices, interacts with different NFs in the VPLMN to
retrieve the requested data, anonymizing the data if mandated by operator
policies and/or user consent, and returns the requested information to the
H-NWDAF. The V-NWDAF may also store the exposed data for subsequent audits
and/or future use.
Based on operator\'s policy/Oauth2.0 security, NFs from HPLMN are only allowed
to access a specific NWDAF_DataRetrieval service at V-NWDAF (service level
protection is available). Other services (e.g. NF exposure services, DCCF data
collection service) are restricted and the NRF in the VPLMN rejects related
inquiries from the HPLMN and may redirect to the Nnwdaf_DataRetrieval service.
#### 6.38.1.3 VPLMN consuming analytics generated by HPLMN
When UE1 enters a VPLMN network (i.e. it is roaming), the network does not
have any historical data related to UE1 that it can use to create analytics
(statistics and/or predictions). It can only start to collect data after the
UE1 has entered the VLPMN, so the initial accuracy of the analytics reports
would be rather low. However, HPLMN may have such data available for UE1 and
can provide to the VPLMN NWDAF information related to UE1 that can help the
VPLMN to optimize the service for the UE.
The HPLMN therefore creates an analytics profile of a UE subscribed at the
HPLMN and may share it with VPLMNs restricting the contents considering
regulatory requirements and operator policies. The access may be restricted to
specific VPLMNs based on operator policy or user consent restricted specific
VPLMNs, and parts of the UE analytics profile contents may only be accessible
from specific VPLMNs, for instance to satisfy operator or regulatory policies
or user consent restrictions.
The \"VPLMN specific user consent and operator policy for analytics exposure
\" contains information on whether and which information about the UE in the
HPLMN may be shared with a VPLMN, whereby different filter information may be
provided per VPLMN.
The \"UE analytics profile\" is generated by the NWDAF of the HPLMN (H-NWDAF)
and stored in the ADRF of the HPLMN (H-ADRF).
The NWDAF of the VPLMN (V-NWDAF) can retrieve the UE analytics profile from
the H-NWDAF for an inbound roaming UE and use it for determining analytics
related to that UE for consumers NFs in the VPLMN. It may store the profile in
the ADRF of the VPLMN (V-ADRF).
The UE analytics profile may contain:
\- UE Mobility patterns.
\- UE Location patterns.
\- Expected UE behavioural parameters.
\- UE QoS / Congestion Experience patterns.
\- UE Data usage patterns (e.g. indicating where a UE disperses most of its
data volume and session transactions).
\- Data related to the UE that the V-NWDAF can use to generate its own
analytics about the UE.
Based on operator\'s policy/Oauth2.0 security, NFs from VPLMN are only allowed
to access a specific NWDAF_DataRetrieval service at H-NWDAF (service level
protection is available). Other services (e.g. NF exposure services, DCCF data
collection service) are restricted and the NRF in the HPLMN rejects related
inquiries from the VPLMN and may redirect to the Nnwdaf_DataRetrieval service.
### 6.38.2 Procedures
#### 6.38.2.1 HPLMN collecting data from VPLMN
Figure 6.38.2.1-1: HPLMN collecting data from VPLMN
1\. H-NWDAF of HPLMN discovers V-NWDAF of VPLMN. Based on operator\'s
policy/Oauth2.0 security, H NWDAF is allowed to access only a specific
NWDAF_DataRetrieval service at V-NWDAF (service level protection is
available). Other services (e.g. NF exposure services, DCCF data collection
service) are restricted and the NRF in the VPLMN rejects related inquiries
from the HPLMN and may redirect to the Nnwdaf_DataRetrieval service.
H-NWDAF requests data collection via V-NWDAF data retrieval service. It
indicates as reporting target one or several UE(s), a UE group or range, or
all visiting UEs from the HPLMN, and the desired data types or events, and
possibly target NF types from which to collect the data or at which to
subscribe for the events.
2\. V-NWDAF checks if the HPLMN is authorised to request the data based on
VPLMN operator polices (that may depend on the HPLMN and may indicate
permissible or restricted NF types, data types, or events).
3\. V-NWDAF collects the data from different NFs/DCCF and aggregates the
collected data.
4\. V-NWDAF anonymizes or restricts the data based on VPLMN operator polices
(that may depend on the HPLMN).
5\. V-NWDAF sends the processed data to H-NWDAF.
6\. V-NWDAF may store the sent data for subsequent auditing or future use.
To achieve the above-defined behaviour, a new Data retrieval service is
provided by the NWDAF that enables both one-time enquires
(Nnwdaf_DataRetrieval_GET) based on the request/response model and event
subscriptions (Nnwdaf_DataRetrieval_Subscribe) based on the Subscribe/Notify
model.
#### 6.38.2.2 VPLMN consuming analytics generated by HPLMN
Figure 6.38.2.2-1: VPLMN consuming analytics profile generated by HPLMN
1\. UDM stores the VPLMN specific user consent, operator or regulatory
filters.
2\. H-NWDAF generates UE1 analytics or predictions and based on them creates
or updates the \"UE analytics profile\" for UE1 and stores it in the H-ADRF.
The H-NWDAF may send an update whenever it has new data or analytics that
impacts the UE analytics profile.
3-5. When UE1 attaches to the VPLMN, the V-NWDAF contacts H-NWDAF to retrieve
the \"UE analytics profile\" for UE1. The V-NWDAF may retrieve the profile
when the V-NWDAF determines to generate analytics for UE1 (e.g. because of a
request from a VPLMN analytics consumer). The NWDAF in the VPLMN may also
subscribe to notifications about updates of the UE analytics profile at the
H-NWDAF. The NWDAF offers a special roaming analytics exposure service for
this purpose. The H-NWDAF checks if the VPLMN is authorized to request the
analytics profile based on HPLMN operator polices (that may depend on the
VPLMN).
6\. H-NWDAF retrieves \"UE analytics profile\" of UE1 from H-ADRF.
7\. H-NWDAF retrieves VPLMN specific user consent, operator or regulatory
filters from UDM and applies them to the retrieved \"UE analytics profile\" of
UE1 to generate a \"VPLMN UE analytics profile\" with information on the UE1
that can be exposed to the VPLMN.
8\. H-NWDAF provides the \"VPLMN UE analytics profile\" of UE1 to the V-NWDAF.
9\. V-NWDAF uses the obtained \"VPLMN UE analytics profile\" of UE1 to extract
information related to the UE1. V-NWDAF uses this information, as well as data
obtained in the VPLMN related to the UE1, to generate analytics related to the
UE1 and provide analytics reports to its consumers.
10\. (optional) V-NWDAF may store the \"VPLMN UE analytics profile\" of UE1 in
the V-ADRF for future use, e.g. when UE is again served by the VPLMN. The
\"VPLMN UE analytics profile\" stored in the V-ADRF may be an updated version
of the profile obtained from H-ADRF, with updates based on the data the
V-NWDAF VPLMN has collected related to the UE1, while UE1 is residing in the
VPLMN.

policies and the \"VPLMN user consent\" restrictions for the UE.
## 6.39 Solution #39: Architecture enhancements to support Data and analytics
exchange in roaming case
### 6.39.1 Description
This is a solution for the Key Issue#3: Data and analytics exchange in roaming
case, which focuses on possible architecture enhancements.
NOTE: The solution only addresses how home PLMN retrieve data analytics or
data for roaming users in the VPLMN.
#### 6.39.1.1 General
The proposed architecture enhancements solution is composed of the following
two aspects:
\- NWDAF in Home PLMN collects data from Visited PLMN to derives analytics for
roaming UE(s).
\- NWDAF consumer in Home PLMN obtains analytics from the NWDAF in Visited
PLMN for roaming UE(s).
The consumer (NWDAF or NWDAF consumer) in HPLMN requests data or analytics
from Visited PLMN via interworking DCCF in home PLMN and visited PLMN,
respectively.
Figure 6.39.1.1-1: Roaming architectures enhancement to support Data and
analytics exchange in roaming (local breakout scenario)
Figure 6.39.1.1-2: Roaming architectures enhancement to support Data and
analytics exchange in roaming (home routed scenario)
### 6.39.2 Procedure
#### 6.39.2.1 Procedure for NWDAF in HPLMN to collect data from VPLMN
Figure 6.39.2.1-1: Procedure for NWDAF in HPLMN to collect data from VPLMN
1\. The NWDAF service consumer subscribes to analytics information by invoking
the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation. The parameters
that can be provided by the NWDAF service consumer are listed in clause 6.1.3
of TS 23.288 [5].
2\. If the Target of Analytics Reporting is one UE, or a group of UE or any
UE, that is roaming from the HPLMN to the visited PLMN, and the NWDAF in HPLMN
needs the data related to the roaming UE(s) in the visited PLMN to derive the
analytics for the analytics ID, then the NWDAF requests data collection to the
DCCF in VPLMN by invoking Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe, including roaming
indication, VPLMN ID, target area in VPLMN, event ID(s), Target of Event
Reporting (UE ID, UE list, or any UE).
Editor\'s note: How to determine the VPLMN ID by HPLMN NWDAF is FFS.
3\. (Optional)According to data collection request from the HPLMN NWDAF, the
DCCF in HPLMN discovers the DCCF in visited PLMN from NRF based on VPLMN ID.
4\. HPLMN DCCF requests data collection to the VPLMN DCCF by invoking
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe, including roaming indication, HPLMN ID, VPLMN
ID, target area in VPLMN, event ID(s), Target of Event Reporting (UE ID, UE
list, or any UE). Before subscribing data to the VPLMN DCCF, the HPLMN DCCF
may check VPLMN specific user consent information from the HPLMN UDM which
indicates whether the user authorizes HPLMN to consume its data collected or
analytics generated in the specific VPLMN. If the VPLMN specific user consent
information is not granted, then the HPLMN DCCF should not perform the step 4
to collect data from the VPLMN.
5\. VPLMN DCCF determines if the requested data is available at itself. If the
data is available, then the VPLMN DCCF performs step 10 to sends the data to
the HPLMN by invoking Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify. If not, then the VPLMN DCCF
performs step 6.
Before the step 5, by enhancing the existing Ndccf_DataManagement service, the
VPLMN DCCF checks if the consumer from HPLMN is authorized to obtain data from
the VPLMN, taking the VPLMN ID, HPLMN ID, target area in VPLMN, Event ID(s)
into account based on the roaming agreements, VPLMN policies and regulatory
constraints between hPLMN and vPLMN, etc. If not, then VPLMN DCCF rejects
HPLMN DCCF\'s data request by invoking Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify indicating
no authority to obtain roaming data in VPLMN.
NOTE: The merits of enhancing the existing Ndccf_DataManagement service
instead of defining a new service to trigger the special checking by the VPLMN
DCCF needs to be discussed in the evaluation phase.
6\. (Optional) Based on the target AOI in the VPLMN and the requested event
ID(s), the VPLMN DCCF discovers the target data provider(s) in the VPLMN via
NRF.
7\. The VPLMN DCCF subscribes to the data provider(s) the requested data by
invoking, e.g. Nnf_EventExposure_Subscibe, indicating the Target of Event
Reporting is a certain UE or a group of UE or any UE roaming from the HPLMN.
8\. The data providers collect data for the roaming UE(s) from the HPLMN.
9\. The data providers send the collected data to the VPLMN DCCF by invoking,
e.g. Nnf_EventExposure_Notify.
10\. The VPLMN DCCF send the collected data to the HPLMN DCCF by invoking
Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify.
11\. The HPLMN DCCF send the collected data to the HPLMN NWDAF by invoking
Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify.
12\. Based on the collected data from the VPLMN for the roaming UE(s), the
HPLMN NWDAF derives the requested analytics for the roaming UE(s).
13\. The HPLMN NWDAF sends the generated analytics to the NWDAF consumer.
#### 6.39.2.2 Procedure for NWDAF consumer in HPLMN to obtain analytics from
VPLMN NWDAF
Figure 6.39.2.2-1: Procedure for NWDAF consumer in HPLMN to obtain analytics
from VPLMN NWDAF
1\. If the Target of Analytics Reporting is one UE, or a group of UE or any
UE, that is roaming from the HPLMN to the visited PLMN, the HPLMN NWDAF
service consumer subscribes to analytics information by invoking the
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation to the HPLMN DCCF, including
roaming indication, VPLMN ID, target area in VPLMN, analytics ID(s), Target of
Analytics Reporting (UE ID, UE list, or any UE).
2\. (Optional)According to analytics request from the HPLMN NWDAF consumer,
the DCCF in HPLMN discovers the DCCF in visited PLMN from the NRF based on the
VPLMN ID.
3\. HPLMN DCCF requests the analytics to the VPLMN DCCF by invoking
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe including roaming indication, VPLMN ID, target
area in VPLMN, analytics ID(s), Target of Analytics Reporting (UE ID, UE list,
or any UE). Before subscribing analytics to the VPLMN DCCF, the HPLMN DCCF may
check VPLMN specific user consent information from the HPLMN UDM which
indicates whether the user authorizes HPLMN to consume its data collected or
analytics generated in the specific VPLMN. If the VPLMN specific user consent
information is not granted, then the HPLMN DCCF should not perform the step 3
to obtain analytics from the VPLMN.
4\. VPLMN DCCF determines if the requested analytics is available at itself.
If the analytics is available, then the VPLMN DCCF performs step 9 to sends
the analytics to the HPLMN by invoking Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify. If not,
then the VPLMN DCCF performs step 5.
Before the step 4, by enhancing the existing Ndccf_DataManagement service, the
VPLMN DCCF checks if the consumer from HPLMN is authorized to obtain analytics
from the VPLMN, taking the VPLMN ID, HPLMN ID, target area in VPLMN, analytics
ID(s) into account based on the roaming agreements, VPLMN policies and
regulatory constraints between hPLMN and vPLMN and etc. If not, then VPLMN
DCCF rejects HPLMN DCCF\'s data request by invoking
Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify indicating no authority to obtain roaming data in
VPLMN.
5\. (Optional) Based on the target AOI in the VPLMN and the requested
analytics ID(s), the VPLMN DCCF discovers the target NWDAF in the VPLMN via
NRF.
6\. The VPLMN DCCF subscribes to the VPLMN NWDAF the requested analytics by
invoking, Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe, including roaming
indication, VPLMN ID, target area in VPLMN, analytics ID(s), Target of
Analytics Reporting (UE ID, UE list, or any UE).
7\. The VPLMN NWDAF collects data and derives the requested analytics for the
roaming UE(s) from the HPLMN.
8\. The VPLMN NWDAF sends the analytics result to the VPLMN DCCF by invoking,
e.g. Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify.
9\. The VPLMN DCCF send the analytics result to the HPLMN DCCF by invoking
Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify.
10\. The HPLMN DCCF send the analytics result to the HPLMN NWDAF consumer by
invoking Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify.
### 6.39.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
Consumer in HPLMN (e.g. HPLMN NWDAF or HPLMN NF consumer):
\- For UE(s) roaming from the HPLMN to the visited PLMN, subscribes
data/analytics information to the HPLMN DCCF, indicating roaming indication,
VPLMN ID, target area in VPLMN, analytics ID(s), Target of Analytics Reporting
(UE ID, UE list, or any UE).
H-DCCF:
\- Discovers the DCCF in visited PLMN from NRF based on VPLMN ID.
\- Requests data collection to the VPLMN DCCF, indicating roaming indication,
HPLMN ID, VPLMN ID, target area in VPLMN, event ID(s), Target of Event
Reporting (UE ID, UE list, or any UE).
\- Checks VPLMN specific user consent information from the HPLMN UDM before
subscribing data or analytics to the VPLMN DCCF.
V-DCCF:
\- Checks if the consumer from HPLMN is authorized to obtain data/analytics
from the VPLMN taking the VPLMN ID, HPLMN ID, target area in VPLMN, Event
ID(s) into account.
\- Collects data/ analytics from data provider(s) for the roaming UE(s) from
the HPLMN.
\- Sends the collected data/analytics to the VPLMN DCCF.
## 6.40 Solution #40: Data and analytics exchange for roaming UEs
### 6.40.1 Description
In roaming scenario, the HPLMN/VPLMN may cooperate to collect data or to
produce analytics for a particular UE. The level of detailed data to be
collected from the other PLMN or analytics to be exposed by the other PLMN can
be limited based on the user consent, operator policy, regulatory constraints
and/or roaming agreements. For example, an NWDAF in the HPLMN may request
input data for observed service experience of a UE to NFs or NWDAF in the
VPLMN to produce more accurate analytics for a home-routed traffic.
In the solution, the NWDAF in HPLMN/VPLMN accesses the NWDAF in the other PLMN
via NEF for data collection or analytics subscription and behaves as an
untrusted AF for the other PLMN. It is assumed in the solution that the
address of the NEF in the other PLMN is preconfigured at the NWDAF in
HPLMN/VPLMN as part of roaming agreement or can be discovered through the NRF
in HPLMN/VPLMN depending on the operator policy, regulatory constraints and/or
roaming agreements.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether data or analytics collection from the HPLMN
by the VPLMN needs to be supported.
### 6.40.2 Procedures
The procedure for data collection from NFs and/or NWDAFs in VPLMN is depicted
in Figure 6.40.2-1.
Figure 6.40.2-1: Procedure for data collection from VPLMN
1\. A Consumer NF in HPLMN request/subscribe analytics to the NWDAF in HPLMN.
The message includes Target of Analytics Reporting that is set to specific
UEs, a group of UE(s) or any UE. In case that a group of UE(s) or any UE is
used as Target of Analytics Reporting, the message also includes an indication
for roaming UE and the PLMN ID of VPLMN.
2\. The NWDAF in HPLMN decides to collect data and/or analytics from the NF(s)
and/or NWDAF(s) in VPLMN, based on the information received from the Consumer
NF. The NWDAF in HPLMN verifies VPLMN specific user consent by referring to
the UDR in HPLMN which indicates whether the user authorizes HPLMN to consume
its data collected or analytics generated in the specific VPLMN. If the VPLMN
specific user consent is granted that to obtain UE related data and/or
analytics in VPLMN, then NWDAF in HPLMN performs step 4.
3-4. The NWDAF in HPLMN subscribes to NF(s) in VPLMN via NEF in VPLMN for data
collection. The NEF in VPLMN verifies operator policy, regulatory constraints
and/or roaming agreements for access from NWDAF in HPLMN by referring to the
UDR in the VPLMN, and, if the NWDAF in HPLMN is authorized to request the data
form VPLMN, it forwards the subscription request to the relevant NF(s). The
NEF can refer to the NSSF or AMF if the subscription request from the NWDAF in
HPLMN includes HPLMN S-NSSAI(s), and translate HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) to
corresponding VPLMN S-NSSAI(s) before forwarding subscription request to the
NF(s).
5-6. The NWDAF in HPLMN subscribes to NWDAF(s) in VPLMN via NEF in VPLMN for
analytics. The NEF in VPLMN verifies, operator policy, regulatory constraints
and/or roaming agreements for access from NWDAF in HPLMN by referring to the
UDR in the VPLMN, and, if the NWDAF in HPLMN is authorized to request the
analytics form VPLMN, it forwards the subscription request to the relevant
NWDAF(s). The NEF can refer to the NSSF or AMF if the subscription request
from the NWDAF in HPLMN includes HPLMN S-NSSAI(s), and translate HPLMN
S-NSSAI(s) to corresponding VPLMN S-NSSAI(s) before forwarding subscription
request to the NF(s).
7\. The NWDAF in HPLMN receives input data from NF(s) in VPLMN via NEF.
8\. The NWDAF in HPLMN receives analytics form the NWDAF(s) in VPLMN via NEF.
9\. The NWDAF in HPLMN generates the analytics output requested by the
consumer NF.
10\. The NWDAF provides the analytics output to the consumer NF.
The procedure for analytics data collection from NWDAFs in HPLMN by an NWDAF
in VPLMN is depicted in Figure 6.40.2-2.

2\. The NWDAF in VPLMN decides to collect analytics from the NWDAF(s) in
HPLMN, based on the information received from the Consumer NF. The NWDAF in
VPLMN can refer to the NSSF or AMF if the subscription request from the
Consumer NF includes VPLMN S-NSSAI(s), and translate VPLMN S-NSSAI(s) to
corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) before sending subscription request to the NEF
in HPLMN.
3-4. The NWDAF in VPLMN subscribes to NWDAF(s) in HPLMN via NEF in HPLMN for
analytics. The NEF in HPLMN verifies VPLMN specific user consent, operator
policy, regulatory constraints and/or roaming agreements for access from NWDAF
in VPLMN by referring to the UDR in the HPLMN, and, if the NWDAF in VPLMN is
authorized to request the analytics form VPLMN, it forwards the subscription
request to the relevant NWDAF(s).
5\. The NWDAF in VPLMN receives analytics form the NWDAF(s) in HPLMN via NEF.
6\. The NWDAF in VPLMN generates the analytics output requested by the
consumer NF.
7\. The NWDAF provides the analytics output to the consumer NF.
### 6.40.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
Consumer NF:
\- Support to include indication for roaming UE and the PLMN ID.
NWDAF:
\- Support translation of S-NSSAI(s).
NWF:
\- Support translation of S-NSSAI(s).

and/or roaming agreements.
## 6.41 Solution #41: Sending data that is about to be purged
### 6.41.1 Description
This solution is solving the problem with a data producing NF or NWDAF having
heavy load or performance (e.g. due to shortage of memory) to store data or
that it will soon purge data for any other reason. An NF may have light load
or performance (e.g. due to reserved certain amount of memory or low on
memory) for data to be stored for each subscription of data that has been
muted.
### 6.41.2 Procedures
This solution re-use existing procedures.
Figure 6.41.2-1: Procedures of the solution
1\. The data producer (any NF storing data - subject to mute or similar)
determines to soon purge data subscribed to by data consumer NF (NWDAF or
DCCF).
2\. The data producer does the following:
\- In the case of a data producer NF being subscribed to with mute (Deactivate
notification flag is set) it performs an Nnf_EventExposure_Notify service
operation including the data collected and the cause code why sending the
data.
NOTE: In the case of NWDAF, DCCF being subscribed for Data and formatting and
pre-processing instructions is instructed it performs an
Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Notify service operation including fetch instruction,
according as described in TS 23.288 [5].
3\. The data producer purges data.
### 6.41.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
Data producer:
\- Adding a cause (e.g. heavy NF load or performance) in the exposure
explaining why data is sent even when Deactivate notification flag is set.
## 6.42 Solution #42: Storage and retrieval of trained ML models to/from ADRF
### 6.42.1 Description
This solution addresses KI#4: How to Enhance Data collection and Storage.
In addition to ADRF functionalities defined in Rel-17, the ADRF supports the
following functionalities:
\- Trained ML model(s) file and ML model file serialization format stored by
NF consumer i.e. NWDAF containing MTLF.
\- Trained ML model(s) file retrieval by NF consumer i.e. NWDAF containing
AnLF.
The solution specifies how trained ML model(s) are stored by NWDAF containing
MTLF and retrieved by NWDAF containing AnLF as described in clause 6.42.2.1
and clause 6.42.2.2 respectively.
Editor\'s note: The aspects of trained ML model(s) storage/retrieval to/from
ADRF by NWDAF should be aligned with Key Issue #5.
### 6.42.2 Procedures
#### 6.42.2.1 Procedure for trained ML model(s) storage in ADRF
The procedure in Figure 6.42.2.1-1 illustrate the mechanisms to store ML

Figure 6.42.2.1-1: Procedure for trained ML model(s) storage in ADRF
Editor\'s note: How ML model privacy is supported by ADRF to consumers
belonging to different vendors is in scope of SA WG3.
Editor\'s note: ML model storage in ADRF triggered by NWDAF AnLF is for FFS.
If trained ML model(s) storage in ADRF is triggered by NWDAF containing AnLF
then steps 1 and 2 are performed.
1\. The NWDAF containing AnLF sends Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request with the

ML model file, Notification Correlation ID.
5\. The NWDAF containing MTLF sends Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Response with the
following parameters Analytics ID(s), Trained ML model file address, ADRF
storage status which indicates if the ML model storage requested in step 1 was
successful or failed.
If trained ML model(s) storage in ADRF is initiated by ADRF then steps 6 and
7are performed. The trigger to initiate storage of trained ML model(s) from
NWDAF MTLF is followed by steps 6 and 7.
6\. The ADRF sends Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe with the following input
parameters ML model file specific information (ML model file serialization
format).
7\. The NWDAF containing MTLF sends Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify with the
following input parameters Analytics ID, Trained ML model file, Notification
Correlation ID.
#### 6.42.2.2 Procedure for trained ML model(s) retrieval from ADRF
The procedure in Figure 6.42.2.2-1 illustrate the mechanisms to retrieve ML
model(s) from the ADRF by the NF consumer i.e. NWDAF containing AnLF.
Figure 6.42.2.2-1: Procedure for trained ML model(s) retrieval from ADRF
1\. NWDAF containing AnLF sends Nadrf_MLModelManagement_RetrievalRequest which
includes Analytics ID(s), ML Model Filter Info (ML model file specific
information), optionally Target NF (NWDAF containing MTLF) to subscribe for
notifications. The ML model file specific information includes the ML model
file serialization format requested by the NWDAF containing AnLF.
2\. The ADRF determines if the ML model file for the Analytics ID(s) requested
is already stored. If the ML model file for the Analytics ID(s) requested in
not stored in ADRF then step 3, 4, 5, 6 are performed, before these steps, the
ADRF discovers the target MTLF from the NRF optionally if it isn\'t informed
by the AnLF in the step 1. If the ML model file for the Analytics ID(s)
requested in stored in ADRF the steps 3, 4, 5, 6 are skipped.
3\. ADRF sends Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Request with the input parameters
defined in TS 23.288 [5] and additional input parameters ML model file
specific information (ML model file serialization format).
4\. The NWDAF containing MTLF sends a Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Response with
following parameters Analytics ID(s), Trained ML model file(s).
5\. ADRF sends Nnwdaf_MLModelTrainingUpdate_Subscribe with the input
parameters Analytics ID(s), ML model file specific information (ML model file
serialization format).
6\. When the ML model for which the ADRF has subscribed for ML model training
update has been updated, the NWDAF containing MTLF sends
Nnwdaf_MLModelTrainingUpdate_Notify with the following parameters Analytics

format, Trained ML Model ID per Analytics ID).
8\. The NWDAF containing AnLF subscribes to ADRF using
Nadrf_MLModelManagement_RetrievalTrainingUpdate_Subscribe service operation
containing input parameters Trained ML Model ID per Analytics ID.
9\. The ADRF sends a notification to NWDAF containing AnLF using
Nadrf_MLModelManagement_RetrievalTrainingUpdate_Notify service operation
containing following parameters ML Model File Information (Trained ML model(s)
file, ML model file serialization format, Trained ML Model ID per Analytics
ID).
10\. NWDAF containing AnLF determines that the ML model training update is no
longer required.
11\. The NWDAF containing AnLF sends
Nadrf_MLModelManagement_RetrievalTrainingUpdate_Unsubscribe with Subscription
Correlation ID as input parameters.
12\. ADRF determines if any of the NF consumer(s) have subscription for ML
Model training update per Analytics ID. If none of the NF consumer(s) have
subscription for ML model training update per Analytics ID, the ADRF removes
the ML model file and ML model file specific information and proceed to step
9.
13\. ADRF sends Nnwdaf_MLModelTrainingUpdate_Unsubscribe to ADRF with the
Subscription Correlation ID as input parameter.
## 6.43 Solution #43: ML model storage in ADRF and ML model provision from
ADRF
### 6.43.1 Description
This solution addresses Key Issue #4 \"How to Enhance Data collection and
Storage\" and Key Issue #5 \"Enhance trained ML Model sharing\".
An NWDAF containing MTLF may be consumed by multiple ML model consumers at the
same time, resulting in repeated consumption signalling and data traffic of ML
models with the same Analytics ID.
Thus, the NWDAF containing MTLF can store trained ML models into ADRF
directly. Or, When the DCCF/MFAF is deployed in the network, the NWDAF
containing MTLF can store trained ML models into ADRF via DCCF/MFAF.
Meanwhile, the NWDAF containing MTLF can register the trained ML model of the
Analytics ID it supports into NRF or DCCF, the registered ML profile may
include the ID of NWDAF containing MTLF, Analytics ID(s), ML model
information.
The ML model consumers (e.g. NWDAF containing AnLF) can subscribe/request the
needed ML model from ADRF directly or via DCCF.
### 6.43.2 Procedures
Figure 6.43.2-1: Procedure of ML model storage in ADRF and ML model provision
from ADRF
1\. An NWDAF containing MTLF instance has the trained ML Model(s).
2\. The NWDAF containing MTLF requests to store the ML Model to the ADRF by
invoking the Nadrf_MLModelManagement_StorageRequest (containing the trained ML
model(s) and/or ML model(s) information) service operation or the NWDAF
containing MTLF stores the trained ML Model to the ADRF via DCCF.
3\. The ADRF stores the trained ML model(s) and/or the ML model(s) information
sent by the NWDAF containing MTLF. The ADRF may be based on implementation,
determines whether the same trained ML Model is already stored by the NWDAF
containing MTLF. If the trained ML Model is already stored, the ADRF decides
to store again to update the trained ML Model sent by the NWDAF containing
MTLF.
4\. The ADRF sends Nadrf_MLModelManagement_StorageRequest Response message to
the NWDAF containing MTLF indicating that the trained ML Model is stored,
including when the ADRF may have determined at step 3 that the trained ML
Model is already stored.
5\. The NWDAF containing MTLF and/or the ADRF requests to register ML Model
profile to DCCF by invoking the Ndccf_MLModelManagement_Register. Or the NWDAF
containing MTLF and/or the ADRF registers its ML Model profile to the NRF by
invoking the Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister.
The ML Model profile may include one of the following parameters: NWDAF ID,
ADRF ID, Analytics ID(s), model framework, model platform,model type, model
algorithm, model compilation language, model Spatial validity, model validity
period, model accuracy, model space effectiveness, etc.
6\. The DCCF responds to the NWDAF containing MTLF and/or the ADRF with a
Ndccf_MLModelManagement_Register Response. Or The NRF responds to the NWDAF
containing MTLF and/or the ADRF with a Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister Response.
7\. The ML model consumer (i.e. an NWDAF containing AnLF) subscribes or
requests a (set of) trained ML Model(s) associated with a (set of) Analytics
ID(s) to DCCF or ADRF.
NOTE: The procedure of NWDAF discovery and selection for trained ML models via
NRF is defined in TS 23.288 [5].
8\. The ADRF or DCCF notifies the ML model consumer with the trained ML Model
Information (containing a (set of) file address of the trained ML model).
### 6.43.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
NWDAF containing MTLF:
\- Supports sending the trained ML model to ADRF.
\- Supports registering the ML Model profile to DCCF.
ADRF:
\- Supports Nadrf_MLModelManagement service to store the ML models.
\- Supports Nadrf_MLModelProvision or Nadrf_MLModelInfo_Request service to
send the ML models.
DCCF:
\- Supports Ndccf_MLModelManagement service to register the ML models.
## 6.44 Solution #44: DCCF Reselection when multiple instances of DCCF exist
in a network
### 6.44.1 Description
The proposed solution is based on the following principles:
\- Multiple instances of DCCF are operating in one PLMN where each instance
can be configured to collect data from any combination of Serving Area
Information, or NF types/set ID of data sources.
\- The network is configured in a way that service consumers will interact
with data sources through DCCF.
\- Reselection is initiated by service consumers to unsubscribe from source
DCCF and subscribe to target DCCF.
\- A data source NF is bounded to a specific DCCF instance or set as defined
in Rel-17.
\- Source DCCF notifies the service consumer if it cannot serve a UE anymore.
\- Service consumer unsubscribes from the data collection to source DCCF. The
service consumer is capable of receiving such notification and includes an
indication that such capability is supported in the service request to DCCF.
Each instance of DCCF can be identified using a discovery mechanism through
NRF which is specified in TS 23.501 [2]. Moreover, a service consumer NF e.g.
another DCCF, can use information about the Serving Area to query a DCCF.
When a service consumer NF receives notification from the source DCCF about
not being able to serve the UE, it unsubscribes from the source DCCF. Then the
source DCCF will unsubscribe from data sources and ensure all collected data
is sent to the service consumer NF.
NOTE 1: All serving areas are logical areas within one PLMN. Each serving area
will have its own instance of DCCF and optionally other NFs e.g. data
providers, etc.
NOTE 2: At UE mobility, DCCF takes no action for subscriptions on group of UEs
or Any UEs.
### 6.44.2 Procedures
The procedure in Figure 6.44.2-1 is used when a service consumer NF determines
to use a DCCF, known as target DCCF. The procedure is triggered e.g. when a UE
location no longer lies within the serving area of the source DCCF, so that
the source DCCF will notify the service consumer that it cannot serve the UE
anymore, and includes all pending data to be notified. Other internal triggers
that may result in DCCF reselection are handled within NF sets as specified in
TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.502 [3].
Figure 6.44.2-1: DCCF reselection initiated by target DCCF selected by service
consumer
0\. A consumer NF sends a subscription request to the DCCF using
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe request, including the \"No relocation\"
indicator set to \"True\". The indicator enables the DCCF to notify the
service consumer that it can no longer serve the UE.
1\. Source DCCF notifies the service consumer that, e.g. location of UE falls
outside the serving area of the DCCF, so it cannot serve the UE anymore. A
cause code is also added with the notification (e.g. UE moved outside DCCF
serving area, if data source is added in subscription - UE moved outside data
source serving area).
2\. Service consumer for the source DCCF determines to select a new instance
of DCCF and discovers and selects the target DCCF.
3\. The service consumer sends a subscription request to the target DCCF using
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe request.
4\. [OPTIONAL] The service consumer unsubscribes from the source DCCF since it
will be served by the target DCCF from now on.
5\. [OPTIONAL] Target DCCF may subscribe to relevant data source(s), if not
yet subscribed.
### 6.44.3 Impacts on Services, Entities, and Interfaces
DCCF:
\- Notify service consumer that it cannot serve the UE, including a cause
code. If there is any pending data, it is also delivered to the service
consumer NF.
Service consumer NF:
\- Indicates support to receiving notifications when DCCF cannot serve the UE
anymore.
## 6.45 Solution #45: Managing Impact of Muting on NF Producer
### 6.45.1 Description
Clause 6.2.7 of TS 23.288 [5] specifies a muting mechanism whereby a data
source (e.g. AMF, SMF) stores events until the event consumer requests the
data using an \"activate notification\" flag. Variability in the number of
event notifications generated per subscription, the number of subscriptions
requesting muting and the duration of muting among other factors can use up
the limited capacity of data sources to buffer notifications. The only control
currently provided to manage storage space for buffered event notifications is
that the number of stored events may be limited based on NF configuration.
When this number is reached, the NF continues to store new events and deletes
the oldest events (see clause 6.2.7.2 of TS 23.288 [5]), which means the old
events are lost from the perspective of the Event Consumer NF. This solution
proposes enhancements to manage the storing of notifications by data sources
and provides additional recourse to a data source that is approaching its
capacity limit.
In this solution, when an Event Consumer NF (e.g. NWDAF, DCCF) requests
notification muting from an Event Producer NF as described in clause 6.2.7.2
of TS 23.288 [5], the Event Consumer can in addition specify an instruction
that indicates to the Event Producer NF the desired behaviour when an
exception occurs at the Event Producer NF (e.g. full buffer). The instruction
contains information about:
\- Action on buffered notifications (e.g. \'Send All\', \'Discard All\',
\'Drop Old\').
\- Action on subscription (e.g. \'close\', \'continue with muting\',
\'continue without muting\').
According to clause 6.2.7.2 of TS 23.288 [5], the only option now available is
\"drop old\" and \"continue with muting\", in which case the dropped
notifications are lost to the Event Consumer NF.
The Event Producer NF evaluates the request from the Event Consumer NF and
responds to the Event Consumer NF. For example, depending on what the Event
Producer NF supports, the Event Producer NF may accept or reject (with reason
code) the request.
The response from the Event Producer NF may also indicate:
\- The maximum number of notifications that the Event Producer NF will store.
\- An estimate of the duration for which notifications can be buffered (e.g.
it can provide buffering for up to 2 days).
The above may be based on local policy configuration at the Event Producer NF,
and/or an evaluation by the Event Producer NF of its available storage
resources. It can be performed on a per subscription basis or for a group of
subscriptions (all or subset of subscriptions created by an Event Consumer NF
at the Event Producer NF).
### 6.45.2 Procedures
Figure 6.45.2-1: Modifications to Procedure for muting event notification
Figure 6.45.2-1 summarizes the changes to the procedure for muting event
notification specified in TS 23.288 [5] clause 6.2.7.2-1.
0\. Local policies may be configured specifying default actions and handling
of requests from Event Consumers for buffered notifications.
1\. The Event Consumer NF sends a EventExposure_Subscription_Request to the
Event Producer NF, including the deactivation notification flag and optionally
an exception instruction request.
2\. The Event Producer NF may apply local polices to the requested exception
instructions and may evaluates the resources available for buffering of
notifications.
3\. The Event Producer NF sends a subscription response to the Event Consumer
NF indicating the result of the Exception Request. The Event Producer NF
accepts the instructions, or rejects the instructions indicating a reason
(e.g. request for \"continue with muting\" is not allowed). The Event Producer
NF may also provide the Event Consumer NF with an estimate of the number of
notifications it can buffer and the duration for which notifications can be
buffered.
4\. An exception occurs (e.g. Producer NF no longer has sufficient storage
space available for buffering of Notifications, or otherwise determines it is
approaching a resource limitation).
5\. Event Producer NF executes exception instructions and notifies the Event
Consumer NF.
### 6.45.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
\- Event Consumer NFs (DCCF, NWDAF):
\- Support sending exception instructions.
\- Event Producer NFs (AMF, SMF, etc.):
\- Support local configuration of policy for buffered notification exception
handing.
\- Support reception and processing of exception instructions.
## 6.46 Solution #46: ADRF / NWDAF Data Storage Management
### 6.46.1 Description
Clause 6.2.6 of TS 23.288 [5] specifies that data may be stored in an
ADRF/NWDAF based on a request to the DCCF or NWDAF from an NWDAF or DCCF
service consumer. The request may specify \"ADRF Information\" indicating
whether the data are to be stored in an ADRF, and optionally an ADRF ID.
Alternatively, data may be stored in the ADRF/NWDAF based on local
configuration on the DCCF or NWDAF. Once data or analytics is stored in the
ADRF/NWDAF, it remains there permanently unless some action is taken to remove
it when the data or analytics is no longer needed. Over time, this may result
in the ADRF/NWDAF becoming a wasteland containing a huge volume of data or
analytics that serves no purpose and is no longer needed.
This solution enhances storage management through policies that consider both
operator\'s/local configuration and instructions from consumers that request
data storage.
In this solution, consumer requests for data or analytics are enhanced so they
may optionally include storage handling information that indicate how the
consumer would like stored data or analytics to be maintained in the
ADRF/NWDAF. The storage handling information provided by a consumer is used
according to a Storage Policy provisioned (e.g. by an operator) on the DCCF,
NWDAF or ADRF. Specifically:
**\- A Storage Policy** is provisioned on the DCCF, NWDAF or ADRF. The policy
specifies operator rules for storing data. This may include whether Storage
Handling Information from a consumer is allowed, default rules that apply in
the absence of a consumer request containing Storage Handling Information or
when the requested Storage Handling is disallowed, and allowed values or range
for Storage Handing Information. For example, the Storage Policy may specify
that the default duration for storing data gathered from AMFs is 4 months,
Storage Handling Information requests from consumers is allowed and the
allowed values for Storage Handing Information sent by a consumer is 1 month
to 12 months.
**\- Storage Handling Information** is sent by data or analytics consumers. It
specifies storage instructions for data or analytics requested by a Consumer.
This information is added to existing service operations used by consumers to
request data and storage (Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe and
Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe).
The Storage Policy and Storage Handling Information may indicate:
1\. How long data/analytics are to be stored,
2\. What subset of data/analytics are to be stored.
3\. A priority indication of the data so that more important data can be
retained and less important data can be removed when necessary.
4\. Specification for sending (or not sending) an alert to the consumer when
data removal is imminent.
A consumer request containing Storage Handing Information is evaluated in the
context of Storage Policy rules that apply for the requested data/analytics.
Different Storage Policy rules may apply for different data/analytics (e.g.
AMF data may be stored for a longer or shorter duration than SMF data).
One or both of a Storage Policy and Storage Handling Information may be
available for particular data/analytics, for a set of data/analytics or for
all data/analytics to be stored. Storage Policy rules and Storage Handling
Information are considered in determining the Storage Approach to be applied
for requested data. The Storage Approach consists in enforcing the storage
based on the Storage Policy and/or the Storage Handling Information. A
precedence may be specified as part of the Storage Policy to determine whether
a Storage Policy rule supersedes a Storage Handling Request.
\- If only a Storage Policy is specified (e.g. provisioned by the operator),
then a Storage Policy rule applicable to the data to be stored is applied as
the Storage Approach (e.g. store all AMF data for 4 months).
\- If only Storage Handling Information is specified (by a consumer), then the
request is either accepted or rejected as the Storage Approach according to
configuration (e.g. by the operator) for honouring consumer requests in the
absence of a policy (e.g. consumer asks to store requested AMF data for 7
months, and request is accepted or rejected).
\- If both a Storage Policy and a Storage Handling Information is specified,
then the request for Storage Handling is allowed within the scope of Storage
Policy rules and precedence configured by the operator. For example, if a
Storage Policy rule is to store all AMF data for a maximum of 4 months but a
consumer that sent a Storage Handling Request asks that the data be stored for
7 months, then data storage for 4 months or for 7 months is authorized and
applied as the Storage Approach according to operator configuration of Storage
Policy vs Storage Handling Request precedence.
In response to a consumer request containing Storage Handling Information, the
ADRF/NWDAF/DCCF provides the result of the request indicating the Storage
Approach.
To execute a Storage Approach:
\- When a DCCF is used, the DCCF may keep track of the Storage Approach and
the DCCF executes tasks to update the NWDAF or ADRF storage accordingly. For
example, after the 4 months storing AMF data has elapsed, the DCCF sends an
Nadrf_DataManagement_Delete to remove the data that is no longer needed.
\- When a DCCF is not used, the ADRF or NWDAF keeps track of the Storage
Approach and executes tasks to update the NWDAF/ADRF storage.
\- When data is to be removed from the ADRF or NWDAF, the DCCF, ADRF or NWDAF
may send a notification to the Consumer that the data is about to be deleted.
The consumer may acknowledge the notification or send a further request to
extend the data storage period.
In addition, the NWDAF/ADRF/DCCF may provide the consumer with a \"Storage
Transaction Identifier so that the data can be easily fetched by the consumer.
For example, if a consumer has asked to store AMF notifications for 5 months,
the DCCF, ADRF or NWDAF may provide a Storage Transaction Identifier that can
be used by the consumer to retrieve the stored data. This saves the effort at
the DCCF, ADRF or NWDAF to filter out data when a request is received per URI.
### 6.46.2 Procedures
The procedure from TS 23.288 [5] clause 6.2B.3 which is used by consumers
(NWDAF, DCCF) to store received notifications in the ADRF is replicated below.
Changes to support storage management provided by this solution are indicted
in the figure in red and are described in the steps below. Note the step
numbering from the current procedure has been maintained but may be updated in
the normative phase.

according to operator preference.
1a-b. The Data or Analytics Consumer may provide Storage Handling Information
in its request for Data/Analytics to the NWDAF or DCCF.

received Storage Handing Information and the Storage Policy.
7a-c. The NWDAF, DCCF or the ADRF determines that stored data/analytics can be
removed from the ADRF. The determination may be made according to a Storage
Approach from step 3.
7a-1-7c-1. As determined by the Storage Approach, the DCCF, ADRF or NWDAF may
send a notification to the Consumer that stored data/analytics are about to be
deleted. The consumer may acknowledge the notification, or send a further
request to extend the data/analytics storage period.
10a-10b. The DCCF or NWDAF may send an Nadrf_DataManagement_Delete request to
remove the stored data/analytics.
11\. ADRF deletes the stored data/analytics.

\- Support notification to consumer of impending data/analytics deletion and
response from consumer.
## 6.47 Solution #47: Sharing models between NWDAFs
### 6.47.1 Description
A pre-condition to share models between NWDAFs is that business aspects are in
place and interoperability tests are done. When these are done, an
Interoperable Token is known by both NWDAF containing MTLF and NWDAF
containing AnLF. The NWDAF containing MTLF can register into NRF the
Interoperable Token. This Interoperable Token is then used when another NWDAF
as ML model consumer discovers an appropriate NWDAF containing MTLF to
subscribe ML Models from. The Interoperability token implicitly maps to an
interoperable model information, e.g. file format, platform, etc. The encoding
or format of the Interoperability token is up to vendors\' implementation.
Models are software running in the NWDAF\'s model execution environment. A
commonly used such environment is a container-based environment. This solution
builds on such environment but can easily be extended to include any
environment running inside an NWDAF.
NOTE: The definition of an ML model may differ between different NWDAFs. The
Interoperable Token indicates whether an NWDAF can use the model exposed by
another NWDAF.
The MLModelProvision service operation is updated to be able to handle
different formats, according to model serving environments in the NWDAF
containing AnLF. This is done by adding the possibility for the NWDAF
containing AnLF to share what environment it is running and what services it
is using for communicating externally to other NFs (such as data collection),
and what output format it expects.
The model file, which is referred to in the URL the NWDAF containing MTLF
includes in the response to the MLModelProvision service subscription,
includes the model software and optionally a manifest.
### 6.47.2 Procedures
This solution re-use existing procedures.
Figure 6.47.2-1: Existing procedures for ML Model Provisioning
Only subscription is shown above, but the same can apply for request as well.
1\. The NWDAF service consumer subscribes to ML Model (s) according to
existing procedure in TS 23.288 [5].
Information that is added by the NWDAF service consumer:
\- Interoperable Token.
NOTE 1: Format of the token is up to the stage 3 discussion.
\- Representative Ratio: percentage of the related UEs whose data is used in
the Analytics computation, when the Target of ML Model Reporting is a group of
UE(s) or any UE.
NOTE 2: Representative ratio is used when NWDAF trains a Model for a group of
UEs or any UE, where it can only use the data of the related UEs who grant the
User consent. The representative ratio can help the consumer to know if the
model can represent the group of UEs or any UE, thus whether the model is
useful or not.
\- A container for information to the NWDAF containing MTLF may include for
example:
\- Wanted Output format from NWDAF containing MTLF (In this solution an OCI
image).
\- The environment the AnLF is running on (e.g. K8s version).
\- What APIs the model shall have and make use of. Example of such APIs are
API for requesting Analytics from model.
NOTE 3: The parameters listed for the container are only for information and
will not require any 3GPP work. The content of the container is not to be
specified by 3GPP.
2\. NWDAF containing MTLF notifies service consumer according to existing
procedure in TS 23.288 [5].
The ML Model File includes the wanted output (in this solution an OCI image)
and may be a manifest on how to unpack into a runtime and what APIs are
available.
NOTE 4: The content of the manifest is not to be specified by 3GPP. The
manifest e.g. may contain helm chart and API description, when the wanted
output is an OCI image.
No further information is needed from the NWDAF containing MTLF.
Editor\'s note: How ML model privacy is supported when NWDAF containing MTLF
and NWDAF containing AnLF belong to different vendors is in scope of SA WG3.
### 6.47.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
NWDAF containing MTLF:
\- Registration of one or more Interoperable Tokens into NRF per Analytics ID.
NRF:
\- Interoperable Token (May be multiple tokens per Analytics ID).
NWDAF service consumer:
\- Adding Interoperable Token in the subscription for model.
\- Adding Representative Ratio in the subscription for model.
\- Adding a container for information to the NWDAF containing MTLF.
## 6.48 Solution #48: PCF/UE re-evaluates the URSP rules according to NWDAF\'s
analytics
### 6.48.1 Impacts of NWDAF analytics towards URSP rules
In URSP rules, the UE maps the application traffic to a PDU sessions according
to Traffic Descriptor and RSD. In a specific Traffic Descriptor, for example
the IP descriptor or DNN and etc. which of the RSDs will be selected depends
on the RSD precedence and UE implementation.
But now, how to generate or re-evaluate the URSP rules for UE depends on the
PCF internal mechanisms. Also, even if UE receives the URSP rules from PCF,
the real enforcement of URSP rules is unknown to 5GC.
The analytic from NWDAF has influence on URSP rules, as described in
following:
\- The DNN selection. For Analytic ID = DN performance, the NWDAF provides DN
Performance Analytics which provides analytics for user plane performance
(i.e. average/maximum traffic rate, average/maximum packet delay, average
packet loss rate) in the form of statistics or predictions to a service
consumer. And for a specific Traffic Descriptor (for example, the Application
server IP address), the PCF can determine a better DNN.
\- The slice selection. For Analytics ID = \"Load level information\", the
NWDAF provides slice load level information to a consumer NF on a Network
Slice level or a Network Slice instance level or both. For a specific Traffic
Descriptor, the PCF can determine a better slice based on the slice load level
analytics provided by the NWDAF.
\- The access type selection. For Analytics ID = \"WLAN performance\" and
\"Service Experience\", the NWDAF provides Observed Service Experience that
including the 3GPP Access performance and the WLAN performance. According to
these analytics, the PCF can decide the better access technology and provide
the better access type in RSD for a specific Traffic Descriptor.
\- High frequency used RSDs. For a specific Traffic Descriptor, the NWDAF can
provide the statistic and prediction of high frequency used of RSDs. Also, the
NWDAF can provide the high frequency used of DNN, S-NSSAI, Access type and
etc.
\- Modification of Route Selection Validation Criteria in RSD. If some of the
RSD has worse performance under certain UE location or time range, the Route
Selection Validation Criteria should be modified.
With the help of analytic or prediction from NWDAF, the PCF can update the
URSP rules to UE, for example, the access type, DNN selection or slice
selection.
Also, the NWDAF can provide the URSP rules experience to PCF. For example, the
PCF distributes the URSP rules (TD = FQDN = \'ABC.com\', RSD 1 = SSC mode 3,
DNN2) to several of UEs. But the PCF needs to check the RSD enforcement
frequency and application service experience after using the RSD. The NWDAF
can provide the RSD frequency and the application performance after using the
RSD. This may guide the PCF to re-evaluate the URSP rules, for example, some
of the low precedence URSP rules are frequently used and has high performance.
### 6.48.2 PCF updates or generates URSP rules according to NWDAF\'s analytics
According to the analytics from NWDAF, the PCF updates or generates the URSP
rules. The update or generation of URSP rules will take the action are defined
below into account:
\- Updates the RSD precedence in Traffic Descriptor, for example, the Non-3GPP
Access in RSD 2 has better performance than 3GPP Access in RSD 1, so the RSD 2
should have a higher precedence.
\- Updates the elements in RSDs, for example changes the access type, DNN
selection and slice selection. The PCF can also add more elements in RSDs, or
remove the existing parameters in RSDs.
\- Delivery new URSP rules to UE according to NWDAF\'s analytics.
\- Changes the Route Selection Validation Criteria. For example, according to
the analytic, some of the RSD can\'t be used at certain UE location or time
range, because the performance of DN and S-NSSAI are worse.
### 6.48.3 Extensions of Analytic ID = \"Service Experience\"
In the RSD of URSP rules, both the 3GPP access, non-3GPP access and multi-
Access are available for access type of PDU session. There is no performance
of Access type of PDU session in Observed Service Experience. So, it is
reasonable to extend the Analytic ID = \"Service Experience\" to add more
analytics to help to re-evaluate the URSP rules.
In Table 6.48.3-1 and Table 6.48.3-2, extended analytics are listed to extend
the Analytic ID = \"Service Experience\".
The Observed Service Experience are extended to add an Access Type of PDU
session to list the service experience in different access type of PDU session
when UE\'s PDU session is 3GPP access, non-3GPP accessor multi-Access.
When PCF subscribes the extended Analytic ID = \"Service Experience\", it can
receive the performance in 3GPP access, non-3GPP access type and multi-Access
type, and PCF can re-evaluate the access type of PDU session in URSP rules for
UE.

### 6.48.4 Newly introduce Analytic ID = \"URSP rules experience\"
#### 6.48.4.1 General
This clause specifies how NWDAF can provide URSP rules experience (i.e. in a
certain Traffic descriptor the frequency of the RSD enforcement, the
application performance after using the RSD, or the performance of each route
selection component related) analytics, in the form of statistics or
predictions, to a service consumer (for example, the PCF).
The NWDAF collects the QoS related data from SMF, for example, the S-NSSAI,
DNN, SSC mode and etc. These parameters are referred to the RSC in URSP rules
under certain Traffic descriptor.
The URSP rules experience analytics may provide one or more of the following
outputs:
\- RSD enforcement frequency in a certain Traffic Descriptor, URSP rules.
\- Application service experience when using certain RSDs in the Traffic
Descriptor.
\- Performance of the route selection component in certain Traffic Descriptor,
URSP rules.
The service consumer may be PCF.
The consumer of these analytics shall indicate in the request or subscription:
\- Analytics ID = \"URSP rules experience\".
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: one or more SUPI(s) or Internal Group
Identifier(s), or \"any UE\".
\- Analytics Filter Information, including the details of Traffic descriptor,
for example, the Application descriptors or Domain descriptors.
\- optionally, maximum number of objects and maximum number of SUPIs.
\- optionally, preferred level of accuracy of the analytics;
\- optionally, a list of analytics subsets that are requested (see clause
6.48.4-2)
\- optionally, preferred level of accuracy per analytics subset;
\- An Analytics target period that indicates the time window for which the
statistics or predictions are requested;
\- In a subscription, the Notification Correlation Id and the Notification
Target Address;
NWDAF collects the network data from AF (directly or via NEF) and from other
5GC NF(s) in order to calculate and provide statistics and predictions on the
application service experience when using certain Traffic descriptor and RSD.
Also, NWDAF collects the results of URSP rules enforcement from PCF.

The analytic of URSP rules experience provides the combined performance, for
example, the application service experience, of certain RSDs in a Traffic
descriptor. Also, the NWDAF provides the performance under single Route
Selection Component, for example, the DNN performance or Slice performance.
The performance of certain Route Selection Descriptor in URSP rules experience
statistic/prediction, can also be the performance of multiple combination of
RSCs for a Traffic Descriptor.
### 6.48.5 Procedures for URSP rules re-evaluation in PCF and UE
Figure 6.48.5-1: URSP rule re-evaluation for PCF according to NWDAF\'s
analytics
1\. The PCF sends an Analytics request/subscribe (Analytics ID, Target of
Analytics Reporting = single UE, group of UEs or any UE, Analytics Reporting
Information=Analytics target period) to NWDAF by invoking a
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request or a Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe. The
analytics can be requested with the filter information.
The PCF subscribes the following Analytics ID for URSP rules re-evaluating:
\- Subscribes Analytics ID = \"Service Experience\" to receive the both 3GPP
access and non-3GPP access performance. Compare the performance in each access
type and determine the access type in URSP rules. Also, by setting analytics
filter as Traffic Descriptor (for example, the DNN, FQDN, IP descriptor and
etc), the PCF subscribes the Analytics ID = \"Service Experience\" to receive
the statistic or prediction of RSD under this TD, for example, the frequency
of used RSD, or RSD performance.
\- Subscribes Analytic ID = DN performance to receive the DN Performance
Analytics to decide the DNN selection in URSP rules.
\- Subscribes Analytics ID = \"Load level information\" to receive the slice
load level information to determine the network slice selection in URSP rules.
\- Subscribes Analytics ID = \"WLAN performance\" to receive the WLAN
performance to determine the access type in URSP rules.
\- Subscribes Analytics ID = \"URSP rules experience\" to receive RSD
enforcement frequency in a certain Traffic Descriptor, URSP rules; Or to
receive the application service experience when using certain RSDs in the
Traffic Descriptor; Or to receive the performance of the route selection
component in certain Traffic Descriptor, URSP rules.
2\. The NWDAF collects the performance data as Table 6.48.4.2-1 indicated from
SMF or AF via Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe/ Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe. And
the SMF or AF notifies the performance data of PDU session that the
application traffic matched to the NWDAF via
Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify/Nnef_EventExposure_Notify.
3\. The NWDAF derives the analytic.
4\. The NWDAF provides the data analytics, i.e. the observed Service
Experience analytics to the consumer NF (including PCF and UE) by means of
either Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify, depending on the service used in step 1,
indicating the results below:
\- Slice performance analytics: the NWDAF provides slice load level
information to a consumer NF on a Network Slice level or a Network Slice
instance level or both, see clause 6.3.3A of TS 23.288 [5] for detailed
outputs. For a specific Traffic Descriptor, the NWDAF can provide a better
slice which has lower slice load in RSD of this Traffic Descriptor.
\- DN performance analytics: the NWDAF provides DN Performance Analytics which
provides analytics for user plane performance (i.e. average/maximum traffic
rate, average/maximum packet delay, average packet loss rate) in the form of
statistics or predictions to a service consumer, see clause 6.14.3 of TS
23.288 [5] for detailed outputs. And for a specific Application server IP
address (can be the Traffic Descriptor), the PCF can decide a better DNN with
better performance.
\- WLAN performance analytics: the NWDAF provides WLAN performance analytics
to PCF, including the RSSI, RTT, UL/DL data rate of specific SSID. The PCF can
decide the access type by comparing the performance between RAT access and
WLAN.
\- Enhanced Observed Service Experience analytics: the NWDAF provides enhanced
Observed Service Experience that including the 3GPP Access performance, the
non-3GPP performance and the multi-Access performance, see clause 6.48.3 of
this paper for detailed outputs. According to these analytics, the PCF can
decide the better access type (3GPP access or non-3GPP access) in RSD of PDU
session for a specific Traffic Descriptor.
\- URSP rules experience: For a specific Traffic descriptor, the NWDAF also
provides the statistic or prediction of RSD or RSD parameters. For a certain
Traffic descriptor, the NWDAF provides the URSP rules enforcement frequency
and the application service experience corresponding to the RSD. The PCF can
decide to generate or update the URSP rules.
5\. The PCF generates or updates the URSP rules for single UE, a group of UEs
or several UEs. According to the performance and URSP rules enforcement
information provided by NWDAF, the action of URSP rules re-evaluation are
listed below:
\- Updates the RSD precedence in Traffic Descriptor, for example, the Non-3GPP
Access in RSD 2 has better performance than 3GPP Access in RSD 1, so the RSD 2
should have a higher precedence.
\- Updates the elements in RSDs, for example changes the access type, DNN
selection and slice selection. The PCF can also add more elements in RSDs, or
remove the existing parameters in RSDs.
\- Delivery new URSP rules to UE according to NWDAF\'s analytics.
\- Changes the Route Selection Validation Criteria. For example, according to
the analytic, some of the RSD can\'t be used at certain UE location or time
range, because the performance of DN and S-NSSAI are worse.
### 6.48.6 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
NWDAF:
\- Update Extensions of Analytic ID = \"Service Experience\" by adding access
type of PDU session.
\- Introduce new Analytic ID that to provide URSP rules enforcement statistic
or prediction under a specific Traffic Descriptor in Analytic ID = \"URSP
rules experience\".
PCF:
\- PCF re-evaluates URSP rules according to NWDAF\'s analytics.
## 6.49 Solution #49: NWDAF assisted URSP decision for redundant transmission
### 6.49.1 Description
The solution addresses the key issue #6 \"NWDAF-assisted URSP\".
Apart from redundant transmission at transport layer, two redundant mechanisms
are defined to provide redundant transmission for URLLC services since Rel-16:
a) Dual Connectivity based end to end Redundant User Plane Paths; b) Redundant
Transmission on N3/N9 interface. URSP can be applied to support the end to end
Redundant transmission, i.e. the network can provide URSP rules for
applications requiring redundant transmission to the UE, with different
combination of DNN and S-NSSAI. The URSP is further enhanced to include RSN
and PDU Session Pair ID for the redundant transmission in Rel-17. While the
Redundant Transmission on N3/N9 can be initiated by the SMF based the
authorized 5QI, gNB capability and local policies.
As defined in the TS 23.288 [5], Redundant Transmission Experience related
analytics can assist the SMF for decision on Redundant Transmission on N3/N9
interface, by providing the UL/DL packet delay, packet drop rate to the SMF.
However, how the end to end Redundant transmission can benefit from the
Redundant Transmission Experience related analytics is undefined yet.
To achieve this goal, this paper proposes that the NWDAF exposes the Redundant
Transmission Experience analytics to the PCF for the UE, then the PCF for the
UE can determine whether to provision the corresponding URSP rules for
redundant transmission to the UE. Thus, the UE can initiate redundant
transmission for URLLC services. Based on this solution, the redundant E2E
user plane can be triggered as needed, subjected to the network quality.
The Redundant Transmission Experience analytics as defined in TS 23.288 [5] is
to be enhanced:
\- PDU Session ID is involved as new Analytics Filtering Information.
\- The NWDAF is required to collect more input data from UPF or OAM or SMF for
Redundant Transmission Experience Analytics, as described in the following
table, in addition to what is specified in the Table 6.13.2-1 of TS 23.288
[5].

### 6.49.2 Procedures
NOTE 1: The procedure is just for information to show how the PCF requests the
NWDAF to provide analytics to help PCF make decision on URSP regarding E2E
redundant transmission.
Figure 6.49.2-1 shows the procedure how the NWDAF can be triggered to provide
the Redundant Transmission analytics to the PCF for the UE and how the
Redundant Transmission analytics can be utilized by the PCF to trigger the
establishment of Redundant end to end user plane paths.
Figure 6.49.2-1: Procedure for triggering end to end user plane path Redundant
Transmission
1\. The PCF for the UE receives dynamic redundant transmission request from
the AF, either via the Service specific information provisioning procedure as
defined in step 0 to step 5 in figure 4.15.6.7-1 of TS 23.502 [3]. The request
message includes the target AF-Service-Identifier, target UE(s) identified by
the user identity or External Group ID or any UE, dynamic redundant
transmission request indication, and optionally SLA requirements for the
application service.
2\. The PCF for the UE sends a request to the NWDAF for analytics on the
target UE, using either the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service. The type of analytics is set
to Redundant Transmission Experience. Analytics Filter Information optionally
contains DNN, S-NSSAI, PDU Session ID, Area of Interest, etc. The DNN, S-NSSAI
and PDU Session ID can be determined by the PCF based on local configuration
or URSP rules.
3\. If the request is authorized, the NWDAF, in order to provide the requested
analytics, may collect the service data information from OAM, SMF/UPF,
following the procedure captured in clause 6.2.3.2 of TS 23.288 [5].
This step may be skipped when e.g. the NWDAF already has the requested
analytics available.
4\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics.
5\. The NWDAF provides requested Redundant Transmission Experience analytics
to the PCF for the UE, using either the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response
or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify, depending on the service used in step
1.
6\. Based on the received analytics result, the PCF for the UE may decide to
update the URSP rules of the UE to activate E2E Redundant Transmission.
7\. The PCF for the UE provides the updated URSP rules to the UE via UE
Configuration Update procedure as specified in clause 4.2.4.3 of TS 23.502
[3].
8\. Optionally, the PCF for the UE notifies the AF that the E2E Redundant
Transmission can be initiated by sending E2E Redundant Transmission
Availability indication via Npcf_EventExposure_Notify service operation.
NOTE 2: The AF can further instruct the UE to trigger redundant transmission
for the application, via user plane message or Application Triggering
procedure as defined in clause 4.13.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
9\. The application on the UE initiates redundant transmission based on UE\'s
re-evaluation of the updated URSP rules.
10\. The UE initiates Redundant PDU Session Establishment/Modification
procedure to establish E2E Redundant user plane paths for URLLC services:
\- If the PDU Session parameters (e.g. DNN, S-NSSAI, SSC mode) of the existing
PDU Session for URLLC service are not updated and the corresponding URSP rule
contains RSN and/or PDU Session Pair ID, the UE initiates PDU Session
Modification procedure by indicating the RSN/PDU Session Pair ID to the SMF,
and initiates another Redundant PDU Session Establishment procedure by
indicating the corresponding RSN/PDU Session Pair ID to the SMF.
\- If PDU Session parameters of the existing PDU Session for URLLC service are
updated, the UE initiates the PDU Session Establishment procedure for both
Redundant user plane, and may provide the corresponding RSN/PDU Session Pair
ID, if available in the URSP, to the SMF.

evaluation of URSP rules.
## 6.50 Solution #50: Enhancements on QoS Sustainability analytics
### 6.50.1 Description
This solution is proposed to address Key Issue #7: Enhancements on QoS
Sustainability analytics.
The consumer of QoS Sustainability analytics may request the NWDAF analytics
information regarding the QoS change statistics for an analytics target period
in the past in a certain area or the likelihood of a QoS change for an
Analytics target period in the future in a certain area. While in the existing
solution, the certain area can only be TA/cell, a cell level QoS prediction is
not precise enough for any UE within the cell, since in specific parts of a
cell the experienced QoS will be less or higher than the current cell-level
QoS prediction.
Thus, besides TA/cell information, a finer granularity area (e.g. below Cell
level) is also introduced for NWDAF to provide with more accuracy analytics.
The procedure for below cell analytics is illustrated in clause 6.50.2.
#### 6.50.1.1 Input data
The NWDAF collects location, bit rate and delay for the UE from the sources
listed in Table 6.50.1.1-1.
Table 6.50.1.1-1: UE related Network Data from 5GC NF
+-----------------------+----------+----------------------------+ | Information | Source | Description | +=======================+==========+============================+ | Timestamp | 5GC NF | A time stamp associated | | | | with the collected | | | | information. | +-----------------------+----------+----------------------------+ | Location | GMLC/LMF | The UE location | | | | information, e.g. cell ID | | | | or finer granularity below | | | | cell. | +-----------------------+----------+----------------------------+ | UE ID | AMF | (list of) SUPI(s). | +-----------------------+----------+----------------------------+ | SMF info | AMF | SMF address for the SMF | | | | serving the UE | +-----------------------+----------+----------------------------+ | UPF info | SMF | UPF address for the UPF | | | | serving the UE. | +-----------------------+----------+----------------------------+ | QFI | SMF | QoS Flow Identifier. | +-----------------------+----------+----------------------------+ | QoS flow Bit Rate | UPF | The observed bit rate for | | | | UL direction; and | | | | | | | | The observed bit rate for | | | | DL direction. | +-----------------------+----------+----------------------------+ | QoS flow Packet Delay | UPF | The observed Packet delay | | | | for UL direction; and | | | | | | | | The observed Packet delay | | | | for the DL direction. | +-----------------------+----------+----------------------------+
### 6.50.2 Procedures
Figure 6.50.2-1: Procedure for \"QoS Sustainability\" analytics in a finer
granularity
1\. The NF consumer requests or subscribes to analytics information on \"QoS
Sustainability\" provided by the NWDAF. The parameters included in the request
are defined in clause 6.9.1 of TS 23.288 [5]. The NF can request statistics or
predictions or both.
The consumer provides the TAIs or Cell IDs, and/or finer granularity area
(e.g. below cell via longitude/latitude range etc.) in \"Location
information\" when requesting QoS Sustainability analytics. If the AF doesn\'t
provide TAIs or Cell IDs, the NWDAF as an 5GC internal NF is expected to
obtain such information, i.e. to determine which cells are related to the
finer granularity area.
The consumer may optionally provide UE Context or Subscription information
such as one or more of the following: device speed or speed range, serving UPF
node information, Subscriber category (as in TS 23.503 [4] clause 6.2.1.3),
device model, device manufacturer, IMEI or IMEISV or TAC range, supported
frequency bands, equipment type.
2a. If the request is authorized, and in order to provide the requested
analytics, the NWDAF decides the AMF(s) based on the TAIs/Cell IDs, and
obtains the UE list in the TAs/Cells from AMF by invoking
Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation using event ID \"Number of UEs
present in a geographical area\" as described in TS 23.502 [3].
2b. The NWDAF invokes Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation to get
the update of the UE list using event ID \"UE moving in or out of Area of
Interest\" as described in TS 23.502 [3].
3\. The NWDAF initiates the LCS Service Request to the GMLC/LMF to get the
location and optionally the speed of UEs from UE list provided by the AMF in
step 2.
4\. The GMLC/LMF initiates the UE location service procedure and gets the
location of the UEs.
5\. The GMLC/LMF provides location information for each UE in the UE list to
the NWDAF.
6\. From the list of UE locations returned by the GMLC/LMF, the NWDAF
identifies the UEs located in finer granularity area by comparing the UEs\'
locations to the finer granularity area, provided in step 1.
7\. The NWDAF invokes Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation to get
the serving SMF for the UE.
8\. Based on the serving SMF in step 7, the NWDAF invokes
Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation to get the UPF information for
the UE.
9\. The NWDAF may collect QoS information either from the UPF directly, or
subscribe to the UPF via the SMF. The QoS information may include the
bandwidth, packet delay for the UE and the information on the serving UPF node
id.
10\. Optionally, the NWDAF may collect additional information for the UE
Context or UE Subscription from the UDM such as Subscriber category, PEI (if
available). PEI may be used to retrieve, from GSMA database, additional
information such as device model, device manufacturer, IMEI or IMEISV or TAC
range, supported frequency bands, equipment type. Such additional information
may be used by NWDAF to add more information to the collected measurements and
filter those measurements that are applicable to the UE and subscription
context for which analytics are requested by the service consumer.
11\. The NWDAF verifies whether the triggering conditions are met and derives
the requested analytics. The NWDAF can detect the need for notification based
on comparing the requested analytics of the target 5QI against the Reporting
Threshold(s) provided by the consumer in any cell over the requested Analytics
target period.
12\. The NWDAF provides the response or notification on \"QoS Sustainability\"
to the NF consumer.
NOTE 1: NWDAF may decide to ignore some of the filters if collected
measurements are not sufficient to derive meaningful analytics. In such
scenario, a warning message is provided in the response or notification to the
NF consumer.
NOTE 2: In order to reduce the amount of information collected per measurement
point, the additional information from UDM may only be collected for the
events of GBR unfulfillment. In this way the additional analytics filter
information may only be supported for 5QI of resource type GBR and for events
of GBR unfulfillment.
### 6.50.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
NWDAF:
\- Extensions of the NWDAF function to support a finer granularity area (e.g.
below Cell level) analytics of with the NF consumers.
\- Extensions of the NWDAF subscription services to support location and speed
request from the GMLC/LMF.
\- Extensions of the NWDAF to support UDM query and optionally GSMA database
for more accurate analytics.
## 6.51 Solution #51: Selection, Monitoring, and Maintenance of NWDAF(s) for
Federated Learning in 5GC
### 6.51.1 Description
This solution is proposed to address Key Issue #8: Supporting Federated
Learning in 5GC. The study bullets of this Key Issues include:
\- Study how to coordinate multiple NWDAFs including selection of participant
NWDAF instances in the Federated Learning group, e.g. assistance information
(if any) to perform the selection, and decision of role for the participant
NWDAF.
\- Study whether and how to perform performance (e.g. network performance and
model performance) monitoring of the NWDAF Federated Learning operation.
To address the challenges in the above bullets for supporting Federated
Learning in 5GC, this solution focus on the NWDAF(s) selection in Federated
Learning preparation phase, NWDAF(s) monitoring and maintenance in Federated
Learning execution phase.
A lot of factors influence Client NWDAF(s) selection in Federated Learning
preparation phase. For example, the capability of NWDAF(s), the
interoperability and availability of Client NWDAF(s) to join in Federated
Learning.
In Federated Learning execution phase, due to dynamic changes of federation
network, current Client NWDAF(s) may leave or join, the dynamic joining and
leaving of Client NWDAF(s) to a Federated Learning multi-round
learning/training process in 5GC should be considered. In addition, methods
may be applied for Server NWDAF to monitoring the status changes (e.g. changes
of capabilities and availability) of Client NWDAF(s).
### 6.51.2 Procedures
#### 6.51.2.1 Client NWDAF(s) Selection in Federated Learning Preparation
Phase
In Federated Learning preparation phase, Server and (potential) Client NWDAFs
are discovered via NRF, and Client NWDAF(s) are selected by the method for
handshake pattern. The Client NWDAF(s) selection is based on the availability,
capability, etc.
Figure 6.51.2.1-1: Procedure for Client NWDAF(s) selection in Federated
Learning preparation phase
Figure 6.51.2.1-1 illustrates the procedures of Client NWDAF(s) selection in
Federated Learning preparation phase.
The procedure for NWDAFs selection is as follows:
0\. NWDAFs register into NRF with Federated Learning capability. Server NWDAF
discovers Client NWDAFs based on e.g. Federated Learning capability, Analytics
ID, etc.
1\. Server NWDAF sends Federated Learning preparation request to the Client
NWDAF(s) by invoking an Nnwdaf_MLPreparation_Request service operation with
Interoperability information. In the preparation request, indication of the
role for the NWDAF(s), i.e. act as Client NWDAF(s), may be contained.
NOTE 1: The Interoperability information indicates what abilities (e.g. able
to run certain models) are needed for the client NWDAF to support this FL
procedure, e.g. if the server NWDAF and the client NWDAF can share model and
how to share model. The Interoperability information is determined among
different vendors and its content is not to be specified by 3GPP.
2\. Client NWDAF(s) decides whether to join the Federated Learning process
based on its availability, capability and Interoperability information.
3\. Client NWDAF(s) send the response to server NWDAF indicating if it wants
to join the FL procedure.
4\. The Server NWDAF may send test tasks to the Client NWDAF(s) that want to
join the FL procedure. The Client NWDAF(s) run the test tasks and send the
results to the Server NWDAF.
NOTE 2: The test tasks may be micro computation or training tasks, the
requirement for completing the micro tasks is the same as or is similar to the
main tasks. The test task could be a small task to let the client NWDAF
collect local data and sends the local model weights back to the server; or
some test to make sure that the server and client NWDAF can communicate if
they use the same FL framework or library. How to retrieve and run the test
tasks is out of scope of 3GPP.
5\. Server NWDAF selects the Client NWDAF(s), the result of the test tasks may
be taken into account by the Server NWDAF for the selection of Client
NWDAF(s).
#### 6.51.2.2 NWDAFs Monitoring and Re-selection in Federated Learning
Execution Phase
In Federated Learning execution phase, Server NWDAF monitors the status
changes of Client NWDAF(s). Client NWDAF(s) may be re-selected based on the
updated status, availability, and/or capability, etc. of the Client NWDAF(s)
for the FL tasks.
Figure 6.51.2.2-1: Procedure for NWDAFs monitoring and re-selection in
Federated Learning execution phase
Figure 6.51.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure of monitoring and re-selection of
Client NWDAF(s) in Federated Learning execution phase.
The procedure for monitoring and re-selection of Client NWDAF(s) is as
follows:
1\. Server NWDAF monitoring the status of Client NWDAF(s) during the Federated
Learning execution process, receives the updated status of the Client
NWDAF(s).
Server NWDAF may perform monitoring and obtain the updated status of Client
NWDAF(s) directly and/or via NRF.
NOTE 1: The status of client NWDAF could be the NF load, NF availability, its
capability changes, e.g. it does not support FL anymore.
2\. Server NWDAF checks Client NWDAF(s) status based on the received
information, judges whether re-selection of Client NWDAF(s) for the next
round(s) of Federated Learning is needed. The judgement is based on the
updated status of the Client NWDAF(s), including the availability, capability,
etc.
3\. [If re-selection is needed as judged in step 2.] Server NWDAF re-select
Client NWDAF(s) as steps 1-5 in Figure 6.51.2.1-1.
The procedure for discovery of new Client NWDAF(s) in Federated Learning
execution phase is given in clause 6.51.2.3.
4\. Client NWDAF(s) terminates operations for the Federated Learning if it
receives termination request from the Server NWDAF.
#### 6.51.2.3 Dynamic Discovery and Joining of New NWDAF(s) in Federated
Learning Execution Phase
There are two possible cases for Server NWDAF to get the information of the
new Client NWDAF(s), i.e. from the new Client NWDAF(s) directly or via NRF.
##### 6.51.2.3.1 New Client NWDAF(s) Inform Server NWDAF Directly
Figure 6.51.2.3.1-1: Procedure for dynamic discovery of new NWDAFs in
Federated Learning execution phase when the information about the Server NWDAF
is known at the new Client NWDAF(s)
Client NWDAFs 1 to N are selected by Server NWDAF for participating the
current round of Federated Learning. Client NWDAFs N+1 to N+X, which are the
new ones, have the capability to join in the next rounds of training
processes.
New Client NWDAF(s), which are available and/or have the capability to join in
the Federated Learning processes, know the information about the Server NWDAF
and inform Server NWDAF directly. The procedure is the following:
0\. Server NWDAF registers into NRF about the Federated Learning procedure
with the following parameters:
\- Federated Learning (FL) Correlation ID.
\- Analytics ID.
NOTE: FL Correlation ID is used to identify a specific FL procedure. For
example, an Server NWDAF or a Client NWDAF can join different FL procedures at
the same time, then when they receive messages or data from other NWDAF, they
have to know the message or data is for which FL procedure.
When a server NWDAF starts a FL procedure, it registers the FL procedure in
the NRF with FL Correlation ID, Analytics ID. When later a client NWDAF wants
to join a FL dynamically, e.g. it wants to update its local model using global
information, it will query NRF if there is an ongoing FL for the analytics ID.
Then NRF will provide the server NWDAF ID and FL Correlation ID to the client
NWDAF, then the client NWDAF can contact the server NWDAF to join the FL
procedure. With the FL correlation ID, the server NWDAF knows which FL
procedure the client NWDAF wants to join and which model it should provide to
the client.
1\. If the information about the Server NWDAF and the corresponding FL
procedure is known via NRF, new Client NWDAF(s) inform Server NWDAF to the
Client NWDAF(s) by invoking an Nnwdaf_MLPreparation_Request service operation
their interoperability and availability.
2\. Before starting next round of training, Server NWDAF selects Client
NWDAF(s) from NWDAFs 1 to N+X based on the updated information of the Client
NWDAF(s). The procedure is the same as steps 1-5 in figure 6.51.2.1-1.
##### 6.51.2.3.2 Server NWDAF Gets the Information of New Client NWDAF(s) via
NRF
Figure 6.51.2.3.2-1: Procedure for dynamic discovery of new NWDAFs in
Federated Learning execution phase when the information about the Server NWDAF
is unknown at the new Client NWDAF(s)
Client NWDAFs 1 to N are selected by Server NWDAF for participating the
current round of Federated Learning. Client NWDAFs N+1 to N+X, which are the
new ones, have the capability to join in the next rounds of training
processes.
Server NWDAF gets the information of the new Client NWDAF(s) dynamically via
NRF by either subscribing to the event that a new Client NWDAF registers or
discovering NRF when it needs to reselect Client NWDAFs.
### 6.51.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
NWDAF:
\- Register FL procedure information into NRF dynamically during the Federated
Learning processes.
\- Selection of Client NWDAF(s).
\- Monitoring Client NWDAF status updates.
\- Dynamic discovery of new Client NWDAF(s).
\- New Nnwdaf services Nnwdaf_MLPreparation and Nnwdaf_MLJoin. The service
Nnwdaf_MLPreparation is for information/parameter sending in the preparation
phase of a ML training process. The service Nnwdaf_MLJoin is for dynamic
joining of new NWDAF(s) in the execution phase.
NRF:
\- Server NWDAF and Client NWDAF(s) registration for the Federated Learning
procedure.
\- Registers FL procedure information dynamically during the Federated
Learning processes.
\- Receive and notify information about Client NWDAF(s) updates to Server
NWDAF.
## 6.52 Solution #52: FL training update to NWDAF containing AnLF from NWDAF
containing MTLF
### 6.52.1 Description
This solution is proposed for KI#8 to support the Federated Learning procedure
between different NWDAFs containing MTLF and provide Federated Learning
training updates from NWDAF containing MTLF (with FL aggregation capability/
in the role of FL server) to NWDAF containing AnLF.
### 6.52.2 Procedures
Procedure for Federated Learning training updates from NWDAF containing MTLF
to NWDAF containing AnLF is described in Figure 6.52.2-1.
Figure 6.52.2-1: Procedure for FL training update to NWDAF containing AnLF
from NWDAF containing MTLF
Editor\'s note: The aspects related to trained ML model(s) sharing should be
aligned with Key Issue #5.
0\. NWDAF containing AnLF discovers one or more instances of NWDAF containing
MTLF via the NRF as illustrated in steps 0a, 0b, 0c.
1\. FL training between NWDAF containing MTLF (with Federated aggregation
capability) and NWDAF containing MTLF (with Federated participation
capability) is performed as described in Solution 21 Figure 6.21.2.3-1 or
Solution 23 Figure 6.23.2-1. In addition, the NWDAF containing MTLF (with
Federated participation capability) send their local training accuracy metrics
via Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Notify in Figure 6.21.2.3-1 or exchange ML model
parameters procedure (step 11) in Figure 6.23.2-1.
2\. The NWDAF containing MTLF sends Nnwdaf_MLmodelProvision_Notify message
with Analytics ID(s), ML model ID(s), ML model file address, ML model
serialization format, Training Accuracy metric per ML model ID. The training
accuracy metrics indicates the ML model accuracy when the NWDAF containing
MTLF performs training using training dataset. The training accuracy metric is
calculated by the NWDAF containing MTLF (with Federated aggregation
capability) aggregating the received local training accuracy metrics in step
1.
3\. [conditional] NWDAF containing AnLF sends
Nnwdaf_MLModelTrainingUpdate_Subscribe message to the NWDAF containing MTLF
with Analytics ID(s), ML model ID(s), Base Accuracy metric, Notification
Correlation ID. The same ML model ID(s) as provided in step 2 are included.
The Base Accuracy metric is an accuracy metric determined by the NWDAF
containing AnLF using the dataset from live network. The Base Accuracy metric
is provided by the NWDAF containing AnLF to notify the NWDAF containing MTLF,
when the same ML model as in step 2 or a new ML model (for a given Analytics
ID) is available with training accuracy higher than Base Accuracy metric.
NOTE: The Accuracy metric used depends on the conclusion of KI#1, which is
similar to accuracy or MAE.
4\. [conditional] NWDAF containing MTLF sends
Nnwdaf_MLModelTrainingUpdate_Notify message with Analytics ID(s), ML model
ID(s), Training Accuracy metric. The ML model ID(s) included in the message
may be the same re-trained ML model as provided in step 2 with new training
accuracy higher than the Base Accuracy metric provided in step 3 or the ML
model ID(s) may be a new trained ML model available for the Analytics ID(s)
provided in step 3 with training accuracy level higher than the Base Accuracy
metric.
5\. [conditional] NWDAF containing AnLF decides if it wants to use the ML
model ID provided in step 4.
6\. [conditional] NWDAF containing AnLF sends Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Request
with Analytics ID(s), ML model ID(s) provided in step 4.
7\. [conditional] NWDAF containing MTLF sends Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Response
with Analytics ID(s), ML model ID(s), ML model file address, Training Accuracy
metric.
## 6.53 Solution #53: Horizontal Federated Learning with Multiple NWDAF
### 6.53.1 Description
This is a solution for the Key Issue#8: Supporting Federated Learning in 5GC.
As shown in Figure 6.53.1-1, there are several NWDAF (containing MTLF)
distributed in an operator, where each NWDAF (containing MTLF) is responsible
for AI model training based on collected data per certain area.
It looks necessary that various data from wide area is needed to train a
better ML model for operator however it is difficult for NWDAF (containing
MTLF) to collect all the raw data from distributed data source in different
areas. For example, as in shown in figure 1 below, the raw data per serving
area is stored in each local NWDAF (containing MTLF).
Figure 6.53.1-1: Distributed NWDAF(containing MTLF) deployment in a PLMN
It is proposed to utilize Horizontal Federal ML learning to train a ML model
by retrieving the useful information from the raw data from distributed data
source over wide area but not require to collect/store all the raw data from
distributed data source over the wide area.
The main idea of Horizontal Federated Learning is to build machine-learning
models based on data sets that are distributed in different network functions.
As shown in Figure 6.53.1-1, NWDAF (containing MTLF1) is chosen as coordinator
and the other NWDAF (containing MTLF) are chosen as client.
A client NWDAF (containing MTLF) locally trains the local ML model with its
own data and shares it to the coordinator NWDAF (containing MTLF). With local
ML models from different Client NWDAF (containing MTLF):
1) If the coordinator NWDAF (containing MTLF) is with the capability of FL
server, it aggregates the local ML models into a global or optimal ML model or
ML model parameters and send them back to client NWDAF(containing MTLF).
2) If the coordinator NWDAF (containing MTLF) is only with the capability of
FL client, it will find out a NWDAF(containing MTLF) support FL server, who
will be responsible to aggregate the local ML models into a global or optimal
ML model or ML model parameters and send them back to client NWDAF(containing
MTLF).
The proposed solution is composed the following aspects:
\- Registration and discovery of multiple NWDAF (containing MTLF) with
capability of Horizontal Federated Learning.
\- Horizontal Federated Learning training procedure.
### 6.53.2 Procedures
#### 6.53.2.1 Procedure for registration multiple NWDAF (containing MTLF) with
capability of Horizontal Federated Learning
Figure 6.53.2.1-1: Registration and discovery for Horizontal Federated
Learning
1-3. The MTLF with FL capability registers its NF profile (Address of MTLF,
Supported Analytics ID(s), Horizontal Federated Learning Indication(FL client,
FL server), Serving Area, preferred Time Period for FL) into NRF.
The Serving Area indicates the area where MTLF is to collect the raw data.
Preferred Time Period for FL indicates when the MTLF prefers to participate in
Horizontal Federated Learning, e.g. based on local configuration.
#### 6.53.2.2 Horizontal Federated Learning Training triggered by MTLF with FL
Server capability
Figure 6.53.2.2-1: Horizontal Federated Learning Training triggered by MTLF
with FL Server capability
1\. The AnLF subscribes to a trained ML Model associated with a Analytics ID
by invoking the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision(Analytics ID, ML model Filter(S-NSSAI,
Area of Interest)) service operation.
The parameter Area of Interest provided by ANLF (as listed in clause 6.2A.2,
TS 23.288 [5]) requests the MTLF1 with FL server to train the ML model
associated with the Analytics ID based on the collected data over the Area of
Interest.
As the MTLF1 with FL server lacks of data over the Area of Interest requested
by the AnLF, it determines that training based on Horizontal Federated
Learning is needed and is to discover multiple MTLF with FL client which have
the data of the area of interest and could be used for Horizontal Federated
Learning via the NRF.
2-5. The MTLF1 with FL server acting as coordinator is to discover multiple
MTLF with FL client which could be used for Horizontal Federated Learning
clients via the NRF by invoking the Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request (an Analytics ID,
Horizontal Federated Learning Indication, Serving Area, Time Period of
Interest) service operation.
The NRF notifies the MTLF1 with FL server with the information of multiple
MTLF with FL client, which is used to kick off Horizontal Federated Learning
procedure as defined in 6.53.5 in details.
6\. The MTLF1 with FL server notifies the AnLF with the trained ML model
information (a file address of the trained ML model) by invoking
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation.
#### 6.53.2.3 Horizontal Federated Learning Training triggered by MTLF only
with FL Client capability
Figure 6.53.2.3-1: Horizontal Federated Learning Training triggered by MTLF
only with FL Client capability
1\. The AnLF subscribes to a trained ML Model associated with a Analytics ID
by invoking the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision(Analytics ID, ML model Filter(S-NSSAI,
Area of Interest)) service operation.
The parameter Area of Interest provided by ANLF (as listed in clause 6.2A.2,
TS 23.288 [5]) requests the MTLF0 with FL Client to train the ML model
associated with the Analytics ID based on the collected data over the Area of
Interest.
As the MTLF0 with FL Client lack of data over the Area of Interest requested
by the AnLF, it determines that training based on Horizontal Federated
Learning is needed.
In addition, as the MTLF0 with FL Client cannot act as FL server and
consequently query NRF to find out the MTLF1 with FL server, who is requested
by the MTLF0 with FL Client to kick off Horizontal Federated Learning
procedure.
Step 2-5 are same with step2-5 as defined in clause 6.53.3.
6\. The the MTLF1 with FL server notifies the MTLF0 with FL Client with the
trained ML model information (a file address of the trained ML model).
The MTLF0 with FL Client notifies the AnLF with the trained ML model
information (a file address of the trained ML model) by invoking
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation.
#### 6.53.2.4 Horizontal Federated Learning training procedure
Figure 6.53.2.4-1: Horizontal Federated Learning training procedure
1\. Based on the response from NRF as specified in step 7, clause 6.53.1.2,
the MTLF1 with FL server acting as coordinator selects multiple MTLF with FL
client to kick off Horizontal Federated Learning procedure by sending a
request to the selected MTLF with FL client including parameters such as
analytics ID, model instance ID for the FL trained model, initial ML model,
data type list, maximum response time window, model filter information for
each MTLF with FL clients to retrieve local ML model, the number of iterations
for each MTLF with FL client per training round, etc.
2\. Each selected each MTLF with FL client collects its local raw data with
the mechanism defined in clause 6.2, TS 23.288 [5].
3\. During Federated Learning training procedure, the selected MTLF with FL
client trains the retrieved ML model with its local raw data over the its own
serving area and reports the results of ML model training to the MTLF1 with FL
server acting as coordinator.
4\. The MTLF1 with FL server acting as coordinator aggregates all the local ML
model training results retrieved at step 3 to update the ML model.
5-6. The MTLF1 with FL server acting as coordinator sends the aggregated ML
model information (updated ML model) to the selected MTLF with FL client,
which is used by each selected MTLF with FL client to update the local own ML
model in itself).
NOTE 1: The steps 3-6 should be repeated until the training termination
condition is reached e.g. based on maximum number of iterations configured by
the MTLF1 with FL server acting as coordinator.
NOTE 2: The aspects of model sharing between MTLF with FL server and MTLF with
FL client should be aligned with key issue #5.
### 6.53.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
MTLF with FL client:
\- register the \"FL capability, Serving Area, Supported Time Period for FL\"
in NF profile to NRF.
\- support local ML training based on instruction from the MTLF acting as
coordinator.
\- support to report the trained interim ML model to NWDAF(MTLF) acting as
coordinator.
\- support MTLF with FL Server discovery procedure.
MTLF with FL server acting as coordinator:
\- register the \"FL capability, Serving Area, Supported Time Period for FL\"
in NF profile to NRF.
\- support MTLF with FL client discovery procedure.
\- support to send FL request to MTLF with FL client.
\- support to aggregate the interim ML model from MTLF with FL client.
## 6.54 Solution #54: Finer granular location information based on LCS input
data
### 6.54.1 Description
As described in the TS 23.288 [5], currently the preferred granularity of
location information is either on TA level or cell level, however, below use
case demands more precious location information.
\- **Measuring the number of viewers who see outdoor advertisements** : In
order to measure the users who see the advertisement in a specific location,
statistical information of a specific location is required to estimate the
viewers of an advertisement.
\- **Inference of taste and recommendation based on visited places** : It is
important to consider the location information before sending the
recommendation. The exact location is crucial for deriving the analysis for
location-based services (for example, mydaiz service provided by NTT DOCOMO).
NOTE: The use cases based on the finer granularity location information is
reflecting the common characteristics of plenty of users under the user
consent monitoring. However, in some particular cases (i.e. only one user in
the scope of the statistics), the user\'s privacy information is not allowed
to be exposed directly unless the permission of the user.
In this solution, it is defined location granularity and location accuracy
granularity as:
\- Location granularity:
\- TA level;
\- Cell level;
\- Geographic Location and Dispatchable Location as described in clause 4.2 of
TS 22.071 [6].
\- Location accuracy granularity:
\- Horizontal Accuracy, Vertical Accuracy and Dispatchable Location accuracy
as described in clause 4.3 of TS 22.071 [6].
The location information can be UE specific or group of UEs in specific
location, in order for NWDAF to provide analytic, therefore, we propose that
NWDAF will act as an LCS client and extract the location from LCS system
(GMLC). Based on the input data from LCS, the NWDAF determine the finer
granular location statistical or prediction information and provides to the
consumer (such as AF or 5GC NF(s)).
Editor\'s note: More information about input and output data for the finer
granular location statistical or prediction information is required.
### 6.54.2 Procedures
Figure 6.54.2-1: Procedure for a precious location collection from LCS system.
1\. The NF consumer sends the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo to the NWDAF. The Analytics
ID is set to either existing UE location analytic ID (e.g. UE Communication
Analytics) or a new precious location analytic, the Target of Analytics
Reporting is set according to clause 6.5.1 of TS 23.288 [5] and Analytics
Filter Information include Location granularity and Location accuracy
granularity. The NF can request statistics or predictions or both and can
provide a time window.
2-3. NWDAF selects the LCS NF (GMLC) with UE location information as described
in clause 5 of TS 23.273 [13] and collects the UE location information from
LCS system as described in clause 6.1 of TS 23.273 [13].
4\. Based on the collected data, the NWDAF determine the UE location
statistics and/or predictions and provides to the consumers.
### 6.54.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
The NWDAF need to expose the new analytic ID with new filter information, or
enhancements are needed to the existing analytic ID with new filter
information such as Location granularity and Location accuracy granularity.
Furthermore, NWDAF needs to collect the input data from the LCS system e.g.
NWDAF will act as a LCS client and gets the input data.
## 6.55 Solution #55: location information with finer granularity in
horizontal and vertical directions
### 6.55.1 Description
The UE location information provided to NWDAF is only TA/cell granularity.
However, NWDAF needs horizontal accuracy and the vertical accuracy with finer
granularity than TA or cell level. For example, in a large interchange bridge,
the horizontal accuracy and the vertical accuracy with TA/cell granularity of
the UE location information is not enough to produce an accurate analytics or
advice.
For accurate analytics or advice, the granularity of location information
provided to NWDAF should be finer than TA/cell level. This solution proposes a
procedure to enhance the NWDAF with finer granularity of location information
and add extra input data to complete itself.
### 6.55.2 Input Data
This solution helps the consumer NF to obtain UE location analytics also the
NWDAF to obtain location information with finer granularity than TA/cell.
Considering scenarios like high-rise buildings and large interchange bridges,
it is beneficial to distinguish the UE velocity, granularity choice and UE
location in horizontal and vertical directions.
The location related data are defined in Table 6.55.2-1.
Table 6.55.2-1: Input data for location information with finer granularity in
horizontal and vertical directions
+--------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | Information | Source | Description | +==========================+=============+==========================+ | Granularity choice (NOTE | Consumer NF | Location information | | 1) | | with TA/cell granularity | | | | or finer granularity | | | | than TA/cell. | +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | > horizontal direction | | Location information in | | | | horizontal direction | | | | with TA/cell granularity | | | | or finer granularity | | | | than TA/cell. | +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | > vertical direction | | Location information in | | | | vertical direction with | | | | TA/cell granularity or | | | | finer granularity than | | | | TA/cell. | +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | UE velocity | LCS | UE velocities in | | | | horizontal and vertical | | | | directions. | +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | > horizontal direction | | UE velocity in | | | | horizontal direction. | +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | > vertical direction | | UE velocity in vertical | | | | direction. | +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | UE locations | AMF, LCS | UE positions | | | | | | | (NOTE 2) | | +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | > UE location (NOTE 3) | | TA or cells that the UE | | | | enters or UE location | | | | with finer granularity | | | | than TA/cell. | +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | >> horizontal | | TA or cells that the UE | | direction | | enters or UE location | | | | with finer granularity | | | | than TA/cell in | | | | horizontal direction. | +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | >> vertical direction | | TA or cells that the UE | | | | enters or UE location | | | | with finer granularity | | | | than TA/cell in vertical | | | | direction. | +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+ | > Timestamp | | A time stamp when the | | | | AMF detects the UE | | | | enters this location | +--------------------------+-------------+--------------------------+
NOTE 1: After adding location information with finer granularity than TA/cell,
there are 3 different data granularities can be chosen: TA level, cell level
or finer granularity than TA/cell level. Besides, location information in
horizontal and vertical directions can have different granularities.
NOTE 2: If granularity choice is TA/cell level, the source of UE location
related data is AMF; If granularity choice is finer granularity than TA/cell
level, the source of UE location related data is LCS architecture.
NOTE 3: Because there can be different granularities in different directions,
UE location in 2 directions also can have different granularities. If
granularity choices in horizontal and vertical directions are both TA/cell
level, UE locations in horizontal and vertical directions are the same
TA/cell. Otherwise, UE locations in horizontal and vertical directions are
different, for example, UE location in horizontal direction is TA/cell and UE
location in vertical direction is with finer granularity than TA/cell.
### 6.55.3 Output Data

### 6.55.4 Procedures
Figure 6.55.4-1 illustrates the procedure for location information with finer
granularity in horizontal and vertical directions.
Figure 6.55.4-1: Procedure for location information with finer granularity in
horizontal and vertical directions
1\. The consumer NF sends a request (Analytics ID = finer granularity in 2
directions, Target of Analytics Reporting = UE id, Analytics Filter
Information = AOI) to the NWDAF for analytics information using either the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription service. The request
carries what kind of granularities the consumer asks for in horizontal and
vertical directions and two directions can have different granularity demand.
2a. If the granularity of UE location in horizontal or vertical direction is
finer than TA/cell, NWDAF collects input data related to UE location from the
LCS.
2b. If the granularity of UE location in horizontal or vertical direction is
TA/cell level, the UE location data is collected from the AMF.
3\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics.
4\. The NWDAF provides requested finer granularity in 2 directions analytics
to the NF, using either the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify, depending on the service used in step 1.
The details for the analytics provided by NWDAF are defined in output
analytics.
### 6.55.5 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
NWDAF:
\- The NWDAF can collect input data related to UE location with finer
granularity than TA/cell level from the LCS.
\- The NWDAF can support the analytics ID for finer granularity in 2
directions.
## 6.56 Solution #56: PSAP resolution with finer granularity of location
information
### 6.56.1 Description
This solution addresses Key issue #9: Enhancement of NWDAF with finer
granularity of location information. This solution proposes a use case about
PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point) resolution for emergency services with
finer granularity of location information.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS if this use case requires analytics about UE
location or only the UE location when emergency communication was initiated
from that UE. Is it realistic that a UE can start emergency communication, but
the UE location cannot be determined?
### 6.56.2 Functional description
At a high level, the functional description of this solution is as follows:
\- UE initiates an emergency session request with including emergency URI and
Cell Global Identification (CGI) with existing procedure.
\- If required, IMS network access to the NWDAF to retrieve the PSAP
destination with the estimated UE\'s location with finer granularity than
Cell/TA level
\- The IMS network uses the routing information returned by the NWDAF to route
the emergency session request towards the appropriate PSAP.
Input data (example):
\- UE ID
\- Cell Global Identification (CGI)
\- UE location info (if available)
Output data (example):
\- PSAP destination
### 6.56.3 Procedures
Figure 6.56.3-1: Emergency Session Establishment procedure with using NWDAF
### 6.56.4 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
Existing Emergency service procedure will be updated to acquire the PSAP
destination with the finer granularity of location info than Cell ID/TA level.
NWDAF:
\- The NWDAF collects and analysis data from LCS and the other NFs to
determine UE location and routing information.
\- The new Analytic ID supporting the PSAP resolution use case needs to be
supported.
Editor\'s note: The name of new analytic ID is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The existing analytic ID e.g. UE mobility, can be used to
address the PSAP resolution use case.
## 6.57 Solution #57: NWDAF determines granularity when the consumer requests
finer granularity location information
### 6.57.1 Description
This solution mainly addresses Key issue #9: Enhancement of NWDAF with finer
granularity of location information.
In the current eNA specification, the NWDAF consumer delivers its requirement
for data collection, analytics, prediction, and so on. On the one hand, many
existing analytics IDs, such as Service Experience, UE Mobility, and
Dispersion Analytics, support NWDAF consumers by providing the preferred
granularity of location information. Some potentially new analytics IDs may
also need to provide preferred granularity of location information.
On the other hand, the consumers can also request a parameter like LCS QoS to
express a more specific requirement when collecting UE location information.
The NWDAF can in return to reflect QoS level to the consumers, helping
consumers judge the situation of the current interaction link between NWDAF
and LCS architecture.
This solution will introduce more granularity options and LCS QoS and by
taking analytics ID = UE mobility as an example, which can also be applicable
for the analytic ID where the consumer includes the preferred granularity of
location information in the request message.
The consumer of these analytics may indicate in the request:
\- Analytics ID = \"UE Mobility\";
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: a single UE (SUPI) or a group of UEs (an
Internal Group ID);
\- Analytics Filter Information optionally containing:
\- Area of Interest (AOI): restricts the scope of the UE mobility analytics to
the provided area;
\- Visited Area(s) of Interest (visited AOI(s)): additional filter to only
consider UEs that are currently (i.e. now) in the \"AOI\" and had previously
(i.e. in the \"Analytics target period\") been in at least one of the Visited
AOI(s). If this parameter is provided, the Analytics target period shall be in
the past (i.e. supported for statistics only);
NOTE: If finer granularity location information is needed, the detail of the
exact target area (i.e. AOI), which is defined with finer granularity, may be
determined and provided by NWDAF consumers and then delivered by NWDAF to the
LCS architecture, including the shape of the target area and the coordinates
of latitude and longitude and other information related to the target area. In
addition, the NWDAF consumers may provide the coordinates of latitude and
longitude associated with area accuracy to allow the LCS architecture to
report the UE location within the tolerant granularity.
\- An Analytics target period indicates the time period over which the
statistics or predictions are requested;
\- Optionally, maximum number of objects;
\- Preferred level of accuracy of the analytics;
\- Preferred order of results for the time slot entries: ascending or
descending time slot start;
\- Optionally, preferred granularity of location information: TA level, cell
level, or different granularity options. The different granularity may be
mapped into different accuracy requirements in the LCS;
\- Optionally, preferred LCS QoS: This information is included when the
preferred granularity of location information is finer than TA/cell level; and
\- In a subscription, the Notification Correlation Id and the Notification
Target Address are included.
### 6.57.2 Input Data
If the finer granularity location information is required, the NWDAF retrieves
location information from LCS architecture. The preferred granularity can be
mapped into the accuracy of the location operation and the preferred LCS QoS
can be mapped into LCS QoS.
The detailed information collected by the NWDAF could be MDT data from OAM,
network data from 5GC and/or service data from AFs:
\- UE mobility information from OAM is UE location carried in MDT data.
\- Network data related to UE mobility from 5GC is UE location information, UE
location trends or UE access behaviour trends, as defined in the Table
6.57.2-1.

Here are two options to enable the NWDAF only collect or count the valid UE
location data wherein the UE location exactly locates the target area:
**Option A: LCS scheme.** The LCS architecture takes the responsibility to
provide valid UE location data. The LCS architecture only triggers the area
event reporting to the NWDAF when the UE locates in the exact target area
defined by NWDAF or the NWDAF consumer;
NOTE 1: This option will have some coordinates work with the eLCS_Ph3. A
solution addressing this scheme is proposed in eLCS_Ph3(Sol#35).
**Option B: NWDAF scheme.** The NWDAF makes the judgment whether the UE
location is in the exact target area or not. In this scheme, the LCS
architecture still reports the UE location based on the current mechanism to
the NWDAF (e.g. the UE location may not be in the target area.). Then the
NWDAF makes the judgment based on the UE location and the target area. The
judgment means the NWDAF only counts the valid UE location data and discards
the other invalid UE location data. This scheme requires the NWDAF to take one
more step of responsibility to count the valid UE location data.
NOTE 2: This requirement, enabling the NWDAF only collect or count the valid
UE location data wherein the UE location exactly locates the target area, can
also be applicable for the analytic IDs where the consumer includes the AOI
defined with finer granularity in the request message.
### 6.57.4 Procedures
Figure 6.57.4-1 depicts a procedure for finer location information analytics
service provided by NWDAF.
Figure 6.58.4-1: Parameters enhancement when the finer location information is
requested
1\. The consumer requests finer location information statistics or
predictions. The parameters like preferred granularity, preferred LCS QoS, and
other parameters are carried in the request message. The preferred LCS QoS is
included only when the preferred granularity is finer than TA/cell level.
2\. The NWDAF collects mobility information from LCS architecture. The LCS
architecture returns the UE location information and achieved LCS QoS to the
NWDAF.
3\. The NWDAF initiates location information analysis under the preferred
granularity and preferred LCS QoS.
4\. The NWDAF provides the statistics or the prediction to the consumers in
the output analytics. The NWDAF can also predict the achieved LCS QoS in the
future time.
### 6.57.5 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
NWDAF:
\- The NWDAF supports more granularities in the preferred granularity of
location information and preferred LCS QoS when the consumers request finer
location information.
LCS:
\- The LCS architecture supports providing LCS QoS and finer location
information to NWDAF.
## 6.58 Solution #58: Supporting UE mobility analytics with finer granularity
than TA/cell
### 6.58.1 Description
If the NWDAF requires to provide UE mobility analytics with finer granularity
than TA/cell then the NWDAF can interface with the GMLC/AMF to obtain location
information using the LCS procedures. In such scenario the NWDAF interface
with a GMLC to obtain location information for a UE. Another approach is that
the NWDAF acts as a GMLC client and obtain location information directly from
the AMF.
In the LCS procedures as specified in TS 23.273 [13], a consumer may request a
deferred location request requesting to be notified of a location of a UE when
specific events associated to a target UE take place. The following types of
events are defined:
a) UE availability: Any event in which the 5GCN has established a contact with
the UE. This event is considered to be applicable when the UE is temporarily
unavailable due to inaction by the user, or for temporarily loss of radio
connectivity or IMSI detach and so on.
b) Area: An event where the UE enters, leaves or remains within a pre-defined
geographical area.
c) Periodic Location: An event where a defined periodic timer expires in the
UE and activates a location report.
d) Motion: An event where the UE moves by more than some predefined straight
line distance from a previous location. The motion event may be reported one
time only, or multiple times.
The existing UE mobility analytics provided by the NWDAF can be additionally
enhanced to collect location information for one or more UEs (or any UE) using
the deferred location events supported by the eLCS architecture. Such scenario
is useful if the consumer requires to be aware of the UE mobility trends in a
target area. For example, a consumer may require to be aware of mobility
analytics of UEs that are in motion in a target area.
### 6.58.2 Procedures
If a consumer requires UE mobility analytics with finer granularity than
TA/cell then the following apply.
Figure 6.58.2-1: Supporting UE mobility analytics taking into account mobility
trends
1\. A Consumer requires UE mobility analytics taking into account UE mobility
trends or specific pre-defined geographical area of a UE or group of UEs or
UEs in a target area.
2\. Consumer sends a request for analytic including the analytic ID and as
analytic filters.
\- A target area.
\- Motion Event Criteria specifying a threshold linear distance that the UE
must make before the UE provides a location.
3\. The NWDAF requests location reports from the GMLC/AMF using eLCS location
procedures as described in TS 23.273 [13]. The NWDAF includes in the request
to provide location information only if a motion event has been met as
requested by the consumer in step 2. The NWDAF also collect location data from
the AMF as per existing UE mobility analytics specified in TS 23.288 [5].
4\. NWDAF derives UE mobility analytics.
5\. Analytics are reported to the consumer NF.
The following input data are required by the NWDAF to measure UE mobility
analytics for specific UE mobility trends in addition to the input data
defined in clause 6.7.2.2 of TS 23.288 [5].

## 6.59 Solution #59: Enhancement of NWDAF with location accuracy prediction
### 6.59.1 Functional Description
#### 6.59.1.1 General
This solution addresses the KI \"Key Issue #9: Enhancement of NWDAF with finer
granularity of location information\".
Editor\'s note: This paper is only focused on NWDAF enhancement. For LCS
related part coordination with eLCS_ph3 is needed and eNA_ph3 will start work
only if eLCS_ph3 makes progress with stable outcome.\ In eLCS_ph3 KI#4 interim
conclusion relying on the present solution proposal have been agreed:\ _NWDAF
provides new analytics for Location Estimation Accuracy (e.g. horizontal or
vertical accuracy, indoor/outdoor indication). LMF as a consumer of such
analytics uses Location Estimation Accuracy analytics to determine Position
Method in the area where a UE is located_.
TS 23.273 [13] defines LCS QoS to have the following attributes: (1) Location
Accuracy, (2) Response time and (3) QoS Class. Among these, the QoS Class
attribute gives the requirement on the other attributes like accuracy or
response time. It could take as values Best Effort, Multiple QoS Class or
Assured. While the Best Effort class is the least stringent one, the other two
require the LMF to determine how accurate its location estimate is.
For example:
\- in the case of \"Multiple QoS Class\", if the accuracy is less than what is
required, the LMF selects an appropriate localization method (e.g. with more
TRP measurements) and re-runs the location estimate in order to reach the
required accuracy.
\- in the case of \"Assured\" QoS Class, the procedure fails if the accuracy
required is not met.
To provide a real-time estimate of location accuracy without need for
benchmark/ground truth location, we propose a data analytics-based solution
running in the NWDAF with a supervised Machine Learning model (e.g. Neural
Network).
A training should be first performed on the selected ML model with labelled
data, i.e. input data with corresponding output data:
\- Input data: positioning estimate by two positioning methods, one of them
(e.g. GPS information) used as ground truth to evaluate the accuracy of the
other method and optionally: used positioning method, assistance data, UE ID,
Area, see Table 6.59.1-1.
\- Output data: corresponding accuracy (calculated with benchmark method such
as the output of MDT), see Table 6.59.1-2.
Once the model is trained, there is no more need for ground truth (e.g. GPS
information). This model is then subsequently used by the LMF to determine if
its location estimate meets the accuracy required and take appropriate action.
To enable this, the LMF makes use of a Service Based API that is exposed by
the NWDAF.
The input data for the Location Accuracy analytics is shown in Table 6.59.1-1
Table 6.59.1-1: Data collection for \"Location accuracy\" analytics
Information Source Description

region of interest where the UE is located (e.g. could be list of cell IDs).
Indoor/outdoor indication LMF Indication of indoor/outdoor when LMF can
distinguish indoor/outdoor environment.

### 6.59.2 Procedure
Figure 6.59.2-1: Location accuracy prediction and usage
Pre-condition: NWDAF has a trained supervised ML model for predicting location
accuracy.
1\. LCS Client requests to LMF the UE location with QoS Class set as either
\"Multiple QoS Class\" or \"Assured\" along with the location accuracy
required. The expected behaviour from the LMF is as given in clause 6.59.2.
2\. The LMF initiates the LCS session as given in TS 23.273 [13] and derives
the UE location estimate.
3\. The LMF queries the NWDAF for the location accuracy giving as inputs the
corresponding Analytics ID . Other inputs could be - location estimate, UE
positioning method/assistance data and area (cell ID/TAI).
NOTE 1: Both Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription and Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo services
can be used to implement step 3. above. The Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription
service can be used by a service consumer to receive notifications about
location accuracy, e.g. when a change is detected.
4\. The NWDAF uses the corresponding model trained in the precondition and
provides the location accuracy as the output to the LMF.
5\. LMF compares the location accuracy received in step 3 with the required
location accuracy received in step 1 from the LCS Client.
6\. If the required location accuracy is not met, the LMF takes subsequent
actions like re-executing the LCS procedure with more stringent parameters
(for example: higher periodicity measurements).
7\. The LMF returns the location estimate with the required accuracy.
NOTE 2: The offline training gives the ML model the ability to predict the
location accuracy without the need for a reference location estimate. This is
made possible by the extensive training done using various accuracy/reference
values, which result in the computing of weights in the ML model. Such a
trained model can then be used for an inference/prediction of the location
accuracy in this step 3.
### 6.59.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
NWDAF:
\- Supports a new Analytics ID for determining Location Accuracy.
\- Supports subscription from NFs like LMF to make use of this Analytics.
\- Supports data collection from LMF to generate the output of this Analytics.
LMF:
\- provide positioning estimates, preferably estimates (i.e. estaimates for
the same UE at the same time) by several positioning methods.
\- Consume new Analytics ID to derive accuracy etimates for the less precise
poitioning method.
## 6.60 Solution #60: Interactions with MDAF
### 6.60.1 Description
MDAS/MDAF functionality enables a service consumer to obtain management data
analytics, and NWDAF can be one of such service consumers.
For Overserved Service Experience analysis, NWDAF can leverage the service
experience analytics output from MDA defined in clause 8.4.2.1.3 of TS 28.104
[15] in addition to the input as described in clause 6.4.2 of TS 23.288 [5].
And also, analytics output for energy saving analysis, such as
StatisticsOfCellsEsState, is the statistic result of current energy saving
state of the cells at a certain time, which can be used by consumers to make
analysis (e.g. observed service experience analysis made by NWDAF) as
described in clause 8.4.4.3 of TS 28.104 [15].
For Redundant Transmission Experience related analytics, NWDAF can leverage
the E2E latency analysis output from MDA as defined in clause 8.4.2.4.2 of TS

### 6.60.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
## 6.61 Solution #61: Improving correctness by retrieval ML model from ADRF
### 6.61.1 Description
This solution addressed Key Issue #1 \"How to improve correctness of NWDAF
analytics\" and Key Issue #4 \"How to Enhance Data collection and Storage \".
The correctness of NWDAF analytics largely depends on the accuracy of
corresponding ML model. In most scenarios, if the training data and testing
data of a ML model have different model information (e.g. area, time period,
etc.), the accuracy of this ML model will be very low. This is because the
distribution of data with different model information is different. It has
been proved in many papers that using a historical ML model (with different
model information) as Priori Knowledge and train it upon new datasets can
achieve higher accuracy than retrain a new ML model(e.g. transfer learning).
For example, it has been proved that using the historical model \"Xception\"
as baseline model and using only 2000 pictures to conduct some further
training can improve the top-5 accuracy from 94.5% to 99.1%.
When an NWDAF containing MTLF receives ML model request from an NWDAF
containing AnLF, it may have neither directly usable model that match the
filter information, nor existing model that need further traininglocally. In
this scenario, the NWDAF containing MTLF can achieve higher accuracy to do
some further training on a previously stored ML model(may not match the filter
information) than train a new ML model.
First, the ADRF should be able to store ML model and send the ML model with
wider range than the ML model filter information using new services of ADRF
for ML model storage and provisioning. For example, the Area of interest of
NWDAF containing MTLF is TA-1,2, while there are two ML models whose Spatial
validity is TA-1,2,3 and TA-2,3,4 in the ADRF. The ADRF should consider the ML
models whose Spatial validity is TA-1,2,3 can match the filter information.
Then the ADRF should be able to send this ML model to NWDAF containing MTLF.
Second, the NWDAF containing MTLF should be able to modify the ML filter
information received from the NWDAF containing AnLF, and the logic of the
NWDAF containing AnLF are not affected (request/subscribe ML model to the
NWDAF containing MTLF). For example, the Area of Interest in the filter
information is TA-1,2, while the Spatial validity of a ML model is TA-2,3,
which has included features of TA-2 but with extra feature of TA-3. If the
difference between the data distribution of TA-1 and TA-3 is not particularly
large (e.g. TA-1 and TA-2 are geographically adjacent), The NWDAF containing
MTLF will achieve higher accuracy to do further training on the ML model than
train a new ML model. The NWDAF may modify the Area of Interest from TA-1,2 to
TA-2 (The NWDAF containing MTLF do not know the Spatial validity of ML models
in ADRF. The NWDAF containing MTLF modify the filter information based on
internal logic). The filter information mentioned in this solution includes
the model characteristics (e.g. model performance such as model accuracy or
MAE).
The following functionalities should be considered:
\- ADRF should support ML model storage including the Analytics ID, ML model
file, ML model serialization format, Validity period, Spatial validity, model
performance (e.g. model accuracy or MAE) and other related information.
\- ADRF should be able to create an identification (model ID) for each ML
model stored in it.
\- ADRF should be able to send ML model with wider range than the filter
information to NWDAF containing MTLF.
\- NWDAF containing MTLF should be able to change the filter information
received from NWDAF containing AnLF appropriately based on local
configurations.
### 6.61.2 Procedures
#### 6.61.2.1 General
Figure 6.61.2.1-1: Procedure for ML model Retrieval From ADRF
1\. The NWDAF containing AnLF sends Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request to NWDAF
containing MTLF as described in clause 6.2A.3 of TS 23.288 [5].
2\. If the NWDAF containing MTLF determines that no existing ML model can be
used and determines to retrieval ML model(s) from ADRF, the steps 3,4,5 are
performed. If the NWDAF containing MTLF determines that an existing model can
be used for the request or an existing ML model needs further training, the
steps 3,4,5 are skipped.
3\. The NWDAF containing MTLF modify the filter information received from
NWDAF containing AnLF appropriately. The NWDAF containing MTLF may take one of
the following modification:
\- Turn one or some of the filter information(e.g. S-NSSAI, model performance)
received from NWDAF containing AnLF to \"OPTIONAL\" or just remove one or some
of the filter information.
\- Change the range of one or some of the filter information. For example, if
the difference between the data distribution of TA-1 and TA-3 is not
particularly large (e.g. TA-1 and TA-2 are geographically adjacent), the NWDAF
containing MTLF may modify the Area of Interest from TA-1,2 to TA-2 so that it
can retrieval a ML model from ADRF whose Spatial validity is TA-2,3.
NOTE: The NWDAF containing MTLF do not know the Spatial validity, Validity
period and other information of the ML models stored in ADRF in this step. The
specific algorithm to modify the filter information should be determined by
NWDAF containing MTLF based on internal configuration, which is not included
in this solution.
4\. The NWDAF containing MTLF utilize the NRF to discover ADRF instance unless
ADRF information is available by other means, e.g. locally configured in the
NWDAF containing MTLF. The NWDAF containing MTLF may consider the following
factors: S-NSSAI, Analytics ID, ML model information (e.g. Spatial validity ),
etc.
5\. The NWDAF containing MTLF sends ML model request to ADRF using a new ADRF
service (e.g. Nadrf_MLModelManagement_RetrievalRequest, similar to solution#42
but with different contents). The following parameters should be included:
Analytics ID(s), the original filter information (same as the filter
information received from AnLF) and the updated filter information (updated by
the NWDAF containing MTLF), and other information (e.g. a notification target
address, etc.). The ADRF preferentially sends the ML model that match the
original filter information to the NWDAF containing MTLF. If none of the ML
models stored in ADRF can match the original filter information, the ADRF
sends the ML model that match the modified filter information to the NWDAF
containing MTLF. In addition to the parameters defined in TS 23.288 [5] (e.g.
ML model file address, Spatial validity, Validity period), the ML model ID
should be included.
6\. If the retrieved ML model match the original filter information, the NWDAF
containing MTLF sends the ML model to NWDAF containing AnLF directly. If the
ML model do not match the original filter information, the NWDAF containing
MTLF need to do some further training on the ML model until the ML model can
match the original filter information.
7\. NWDAF containing MTLF sends Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request response to NWDAF
containing AnLF as described in clause 6.2A.3 of TS 23.288 [5].
8\. If the NWDAF containing MTLF trained a new ML model or did some further
training on a ML model stored in ADRF, the NWDAF containing MTLF may, send a
request to ADRF to store the new ML model. The following parameters should be
included: Analytics ID, ML model file, ML model serialization format, Spatial
validity, Validity period, model performance and other related information.
The ADRF then assigns a model ID to this ML model. The NWDAF containing MTLF
shall use a new services to store the ML model (e.g.
Nadrf_MLModelManagement_StorageRequest, which is similar to solution#42 and
solution#43).
NOTE: What is provided from MTLF to ADRF should align with KI#5.
The ADRF may register the ML model profile to NRF using
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFRegister. One or more than one of the following parameters
should be included: ADRF ID, ML model ID, Spatial validity, Validity period,
model performance and other related information.
### 6.61.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
ADRF:
\- Support new services for ML model storage and provisioning (e.g.
Nadrf_MLModelManagement_RetrevalRequest,
Nadrf_MLModelManagement_StorageRequest);
\- Support responding ML model with wider range than the filter information to
NWDAF containing MTLF using the new services;
NWDAF containing MTLF:
\- Support filter information modification;
\- Support ML model retrieval from ADRF;
## 6.62 Solution #62: Improving the correctness of analytics based on the
provision of context information
### 6.62.1 Description
In the process of generating analytics reports by NWDAF, there are cases when
more than one ML model is available to choose for an analytics ID.
Meanwhile, NFs using the NWDAF service may have very different analytical
computing needs depending on the use cases. These use cases may depend on the
type of user, specific circumstances, or application. At present time, the
NWDAF service interface allows specifying accuracy and time window parameters,
but they are not explicit enough to guide the NWDAF towards choosing a
relevant analytical model for a use case. The NWDAF has no explicit way to
determine for what (semantic) reason a consuming NF requests its services. An
explicit indication of the use case context that provided by the analytics
consumer can help the NWDAF choose the most relevant model.
The proposed solution consists in guiding the NWDAF by providing it an
additional optional parameter \"use case context\", at the initiative of the
consuming NF, which, by targeting the context of use of the requested
analytics, would allow it to take the appropriate measures (for example, to
select a family of statistical models). The parameter \"use case context\" is
a single string or scalar (to be determined by stage 3). The value of \"use
case context\" to be used in requests to NWDAF is configured in the consuming
NF and is valid in the whole PLMN.
If the NWDAF has been preconfigured for the value of the \"use case context\"
parameter provided by the consuming NF to the NWDAF during a service request,
the NWDAF is immediately able to select a model family. This corresponds to
the case where the operator has decided to use some specific models for this
specific use case, and preconfigured the NWDAF accordingly.
In the opposite case (if the NWDAF does not have a preconfiguration for the
\"use case context\" parameter value provided by the consumer NF), the NWDAF
may refine the choice of the relevant models during the training or re-
training phases, by correlating a given value of the parameter, the chosen
models, and the quality of the obtained results.
Such an optimization of the model by learning can also be implemented by the
NWDAF when the NWDAF has been preconfigured for the value of the parameter
\"use case context\" provided by the consumer NF.
When AnLF and MTLF are contained in different NWDAF instances, the AnLF may
use the \"use case context\" to determine optimal parameters of
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service/Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo service as described above.
In this case, the MTLF does not receive the use case context.
Alternatively, depending on the situation (e.g. the AnLF does not have a
preconfiguration) and implementation, the AnLF may include the \"use case
context\" in the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service/Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo service.
In this case, the MTLF selects the ML model according to a preconfiguration
for the \"use case context\" parameter value provided by the AnLF. If the MTLF
does not have such preconfiguration, the MTLF ignores the \"use case context\"
and provides the ML model matching other parameters.
### 6.62.2 Procedures
This solution uses existing procedures.
The analytics consumer may add the parameter \"use case context\" in the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe and the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request
service operations.
The AnLF may add the parameter \"use case context\" in the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe and the MLModelInfo_Request service
operations.
### 6.62.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
\- Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service: new parameter \"use case context\" for the
Request operation.
\- Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription Service: new parameter \"use case context\"
for the Subscribe operation.
\- Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service: new parameter \"use case context\" for the
Subscribe operation.
\- Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo Service: new parameter \"use case context\" for the
Request operation.
## 6.63 Solution #63: Improving the correctness of NWDAF by rating the quality
of the data sources
### 6.63.1 Description
This solution addresses Key Issue #1 and especially how to detect and improve
correctness of NWDAF analytics by enabling a rating of the data sources.
Such rating can be based on (i) local estimation/calculation between the
predicted and ground-truth data, (ii) the analytics consumer feedback, or
(iii) provided by an AF in the forms of weights.
Hence, NWDAF relates a rating to the data source profiles/reputation, which
can be used as criterion for selecting from which sources to collect data. In
the selection of the appropriate data source, the NWDAF can also use as a
criterion the expected confidence degree, i.e. that relates the outcome result
with the input data sources.
Such solution is more relevant for data sources which are not within the
network operator premises to control and check easily errors and security. For
these types of sources, the quality of the data needs to be checked and shall
not be consumed by the NWDAF MTLF especially if there is a significant change
in the data distribution or if there is a significant drift between
predictions and ground truth data, which impacts the performance of the
accuracy.
The rating process can be performed by AnLF or by a new NF, like TRLF.
We assume here that AnLF is not biased, towards specific data sources (e.g.
same vendor data source).
The proposed solution only applies to the data from 3rd party data sources.
The proposed solution cannot be applied for all types of data sources, but
only for the ones that provide performance measurements or KPIs, which can be
obtained via more than one way.
### 6.63.2 Procedures
#### 6.63.2.1 AnLF enhancements and rating storage at ADRF
This process which is depicted in Figure 6.63.2.1-1 covers the enhancements at
AnLF and the storage of ratings at ADRF
Figure 6.63.2-1: ANLF-based rating and storage at ADRF
**Option 1:**
1a. Once an analytics consumer uses an Analytics ID, NWDAF (AnLF) requests the
consumer on the feedback / evaluation of the analytics service (good or bad,
experience level, success, or failure of prediction, with a possible cause).
1b. NWDAF (AnLF) receives the feedback requested from the analytics consumer.
**Option 2:**
2a. NWDAF (MTLF) evaluates the ML model correctness and notifies NWDAF (AnLF).
2b. NWDAF (AnLF) receives the notification from NWDAF (MTLF), which indicates
possible low performance or correctness, and optionally requesting AnLF to
further check the inference data or data sources.
3a-3b. NWDAF (AnLF) conditionally (i.e. if needed) requests and receives
supplementary data from different data sources (if available) to verify the
data source quality or correctness. Such data can be for example performance
data from the OAM which are supplementary to AF, or data from UPF
supplementary from AF.
4\. NWDAF (AnLF) updates the rating for the sources where data is deviated
from the supplementary data (or in case step 3 is not implemented) the rating
is automatically changed based on the analytics feedbacks in 2b.
5\. NWDAF stores the ratings to ADRF or any other repository function.
6\. A new analytics request arrives from an analytics consumer for analytics
service with a certain Analytics ID = \"xx\".
7\. NWDAF (AnLF) retrieves the rating for the data sources corresponding to
the requested Analytics ID
8\. If the rating of one or more data sources is below a threshold (pre-set),
then NWDAF (AnLF) triggers an action of:
\- selection of an alternative data source with highest rating;
\- require supplementary data from other available data sources and uses them
for verification of the data from low rated data source.
9\. If a new data source is needed (for the supplementary data or to serve as
alternative data source based on step 8), NWDAF (AnLF) subscribes to a new
data source, and requests/receives new data.
10\. NWDAF (AnLF) obtains the data and checks whether the confidence level is
above a request threshold. The derivation of the threshold considers the
rating of data sources (or an aggregated rating of the data sources based on
the individual ratings).
11\. NWDAF (AnLF) provides the analytics output to the analytics consumer.
Editor\'s note: The benefit to keep the data source rating in ARDF is FFS.
### 6.63.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
\- NWDAF allows a consumer to provide rating of analytics service.
\- NWDAF supports the discovery of problematic data sources.
\- Other NF, e.g. TRLF may optionally assist the rating process and supports
the discovery of problematic data sources.
## 6.64 Solution #64: Optimize the collection and reporting of network data
### 6.64.1 Description
This solution addresses Key Issue #4 \"How to Enhance Data collection and
Storage\".
NWDAF collects data from NF for two purposes, one is to obtain training data
during model training, and the other is to obtain inference data during model
inference. Research points for these key Issue therefore include:
\- How to optimize the performance of training data reporting. In the model
training scenario, since most of the model training is offline training, the
real-time data requirements are not high, but the amount of data to be
reported may be large. When the device is busy, it needs to undertake a large
number of data reporting tasks, which may affect normal services. The data
reporting mode is currently defined in clause 4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3]. The
parameters that can be set for reporting include: maximum number of reports,
fixed reporting frequency, and maximum duration of reporting. These parameters
do not consider the data reporting time. How to optimize the performance of
your device.
\- How to optimize the performance and accuracy of data collection in model
inference scenarios. In the model inference scenario, data collection is the
input and basis for model inference, but data collection consumes the
performance of the collection device. According to the existing fixed
collection frequency mechanism, if the collection rate is too high, it will
lead to excessive consumption of network resources. On the contrary, if the
rate is too low, information loss and inaccurate measurement may be caused,
and accurate analysis may not be possible in some key scenarios.
To address the above-mentioned challenges in data collection, the solution
focuses on optimizing the collection and reporting of network data. Mainly
divided into the following two points:
\- Through the reporting mechanism by time period, the impact on the
performance of the collection equipment can be minimized while meeting the
data collection requirements, and the resource capacity of the idle time is
fully utilized.
\- By increasing the data collection method of changing frequency, the
collection period can be defined as needed, which does not increase the burden
on the collection equipment, and at the same time meets the required data
collection frequency requirements.
### 6.64.2 Procedures
#### 6.64.2.1 Training data is reported in time periods in model training
scenario
NWDAF subscribes and requests data services from NF through
Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe. After receiving the subscription request, NF
collects and reports data according to the collection frequency and data
reporting mode defined in the subscription message. The Event Reporting
Information parameter of the Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe message is defined in
clause 4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3].
In order to solve the performance optimization problem of training data
reporting, the solution of this solution is as follows: when NWDAF subscribes
to training data, the time period for data reporting can be configured in the
subscription message of data collection, that is, data reporting is performed
when the device is idle, so that both It can reduce the performance pressure
on the device caused by data reporting during busy hours, and can ensure the
normal collection of data. The specific measures are to add the \"reporting
within time period\" option to the Event reporting mode parameter of the
subscription message, and at the same time add the time period field to set
the time period for data reporting. The new parameters are shown in Table
6.64.2-1 below.
Table 6.64.2-1: New parameters added in event reporting mode parameters in
model training scenario
Event Reporting Information Parameter Description Presence requirement
* * *
Event reporting mode Mode of reporting - e.g. reporting up to a maximum number
of reports, periodic reporting along with periodicity, reporting up to a
maximum duration, reporting within time period. mandatory time period The
specific time period for data reporting, or the idle time period automatically
identified by the device, for data collection that does not require high real-
time performance, the time period can be set to idle time.
Figure 6.64.2-1: Procedure of Training data reporting when the device is idle
1\. NWDAF analyses the NF load to obtain the idle time period of the device.
NOTE: Clause 6.5 of TS 23.288 [5] describes how NWDAF can provide NF load
analytics.
2\. NWDAF sends a subscription message for data collection to NF, carrying
collection parameters. Event reporting mode is reporting within time period.
The reporting period is set to the idle time period obtained by the first step
of analysis, such as time period =0:00-3:00, Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe(Event
reporting mode=reporting within time period, time period=0:00-3:00).
NOTE: When NWDAF sends Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe to NF producer, exception
handling indication in subscription message can be included. This exception
handling indication is used to indicate the handling policy when the buffer is
insufficient. For details, see solution#45.
3\. NF collects and reports information according to the configured collection
requirements. NF reports Nnf_EventExposure_Notify to NWDAF.
#### 6.64.2.2 Data collection with dynamic frequency in model inference
scenario
In order to optimize the performance and accuracy of data collection in the
model inference scenario, the frequency of data collection can be set to the
dynamic change mode. For example, in the application scenario of fault
diagnosis and repair, when the network quality is good, data can be collected
at low frequency and used for NWDAF\'s routine evaluation of the current
situation. When the network quality is not good, if the collected data is
insufficient, the problem may not be located. , at this time, the acquisition
device can increase the acquisition frequency based on preliminary judgment
criteria, such as when the fault index is greater than a certain threshold, so
as to obtain more abundant fault data for root cause location and problem
solving. The new parameters are shown in Table 6.64.2-2 below.
Table 6.64.2-2: New parameters added in event reporting mode parameters in
model inference scenario
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Event Reporting | Description | Presence requirement | | Information | | | | Parameter | | | +======================+======================+======================+ | Event reporting mode | Mode of reporting - | mandatory | | | e.g. reporting up to | | | | a maximum number of | | | | reports, periodic | | | | reporting along with | | | | periodicity, | | | | reporting up to a | | | | maximum duration, | | | | reporting within | | | | time period. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | time period | The time period for | | | | data reporting, for | | | | data collection that | | | | does not require | | | | high real-time | | | | performance, the | | | | time period can be | | | | set to idle time. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Non-fixed sampling | Percentage of | (see NOTE) | | ratio | sampling list: | | | | | | | | Percentage 1 of | | | | sampling (1%..100%) | | | | when condition1, | | | | Percentage 2 of | | | | sampling (1%..100%) | | | | when condition 2,etc | | | | | | | | Condition can be | | | | such as NF load, | | | | service failure | | | | rate, etc. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | NOTE: Two examples | | | | are cited.

Figure 6.64.2-2: Adjust the collection frequency according to the service
failure rate
The above collection frequency is set to the dynamic Non-fixed sampling ratio.
The collection frequency is adjusted according to the service failure rate.
The collection frequency is divided into two levels. The first level is: when
the service failure rate is less than 2%, the collection frequency is once per
second; the second level is: when the service failure rate is >=2%, the
collection frequency is once every 50 milliseconds.
Figure 6.64.2-3: Adjust the acquisition frequency according to the equipment
load
The above sampling frequency is set to the dynamic Non-fixed sampling ratio,
and the sampling frequency is adjusted according to the device load. The
sampling frequency is divided into three levels. The first gear is: when NF
load\90 %, the collection frequency is 0, that is,
no collection. When data producer NF reports events / data, it includes data
sampling ratio in the event / data notification.
### 6.64.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
NWDAF:
\- When NWDAF subscribes to training data, the time period of data reporting
can be configured in the subscription message of data collection to report
data when the equipment is idle.
\- When NWDAF subscribes to training data in the model inference scenario, the
frequency of data collection can be configured in the subscription message of
data collection as a dynamic change mode.
## 6.65 Solution #65: Optimizing data collection and storage by NWDAF
registration in UDM for all Analytics IDs
### 6.65.1 Description
As stated in clause 6.1.C of TS 23.288 [5], NWDAF triggers a registration in
UDM, e.g. based on local configuration in the NWDAF, the reception of a new
Analytics subscription request, start of collection of UE related data or an
OAM configuration action. During NWDAF discovery (clause 5.2) a consumer may
select the same NWDAF.
The procedures in clause 6.1.C of TS 23.288 [5] are applicable to UE-related
analytics (e.g. UE mobility analytics) for some network deployments, e.g. such
with an NWDAF co-located to an AMF or SMF, where the NWDAF is configured to
register in UDM for the UEs that it is serving or collecting data for, and for
the related Analytics ID(s). This enables NWDAF service consumers to discover
the NWDAF instance that is already serving the UE for one or more Analytics
ID(s).
The value of UDM registration is to minimize the multiple NWDAF instances
serving a given UE, and thus reduce the data collection signalling and storage
volume.
However, the principle is limited to cases of UE-related analytics. These
analytics are defined in clause 6.1.7 as UE-mobility, UE-communication,
Abnormal behaviour. However, many other analytics provide data specific to a
UE, and collect data on NFs that serve this UE (e.g. Observed Service
Experience, User Data Congestion).
This solution consists in allowing the NWDAF to register in the UDM for the
served UE (as specified in clause 6.1C.2 of TS 23.288 [5]), also for Analytics
IDs that are not UE-related. The NWDAF may do this when the NWDAF is
collecting data specific to the UE for the indicated Analytics ID. The trigger
to do so is still based on local configuration.
This further reduces signalling due to data collection and storage volume.
### 6.65.2 Procedures
This solution does not require new procedures.
The procedure in clause 6.1C.2 of TS 23.288 [5] is used without modification
but the text introducing this procedure needs to be updated to make the
procedure applicable to all Analytics ID.
### 6.65.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
No impact on services since no restriction is specified on the Analytics ID(s)
that can be indicated in Nudm_UECM_Registration service.
NWDAF is impacted to support UDM registration for all Analytics IDs, triggered
by local configuration.
## 6.66 Solution #66: DCCF relocation initiated by source DCCF or central DCCF
### 6.66.1 Description
This solution addresses Key Issue #4 \"How to Enhance Data collection and
Storage\".
According to the definition of the Rel-17, DCCF is the data acquisition
coordination node of the core network, the data acquisition area of DCCF is
fixed, and the data source NF or data source NF set in the same area should be
associated with only one DCCF instance or DCCF set. As described in TS 23.501
[2], multiple instances of DCCF may be deployed in a network. The NF consumers
shall utilize the NRF to discover DCCF instance(s). NF consumers can select an
available DCCF based on parameters such as DCCF service area information,
S-NSSAI, and NF type of the data source, etc.
In scenarios where multiple DCCF instances are deployed in the same 5G
network, there are some cases that the serving DCCF may need to be changed
during the operation due to, e.g. UE mobility, change in DCCF profile, new
addition or removal of DCCF instances, etc.
When the data consumer subscribes to the source DCCF directly, upon change of
a source DCCF instance, it is required to inform the related data consumer of
the event and possibly to update subscriptions between the DCCF and the data
consumer. If the central DCCF is deployed, data consumer collects UE data via
the central DCCF, thus, data consumer may not need to be notified of the UE
mobility events and DCCF reselection events.
The following figure illustrates the DCCF relocation initiated by source DCCF
or central DCCF.
Figure 6.66.1-1: DCCF relocation initiated by source DCCF or central DCCF
### 6.66.2 Procedures
Figure 6.66.2-1: Procedure for DCCF relocation initiated by source DCCF or
central DCCF
0\. The data consumer subscribes source DCCF. The data consumer sends UE(s)
ID, enabling DCCF to determine whether the UE(s) data subscription transfer
procedure is applicable. If the central DCCF is deployed, the data consumer
subscribes to central DCCF optionally, then central DCCF discovers and selects
a source DCCF. The consumer NF sets to "False" the "No relocation" indicator
in the subscription request.
NOTE: The \"No relocation\" indicator is used by DCCF to determine whether to
execute the relocation procedure (No Relocation set to \"False\") or not (No
Relocation set to \"True\").
1\. Source DCCF or central DCCF subscribes UE(s) mobility events from AMF.
2\. If UE(s) moves out of the service area of the source DCCF, source DCCF or
central DCCF determines UE(s) data subscription to be transferred to target
DCCF(s), e.g. triggered by a UE mobility event notification from AMF.
3\. Source DCCF or central DCCF may query the NRF to perform a DCCF discovers
and selects the target DCCF(s), e.g. based on the UE location information
received from AMF.
4\. Source DCCF requests or central DCCF triggers source DCCF to request,
using Ndccf_DataManagement_Transfer Request service operation, a transfer of
UE(s) data subscription to the target DCCF(s).
5\. Target DCCF(s) accepts the data subscription(s) transfer.
6\. Target DCCF informs the data consumer or central DCCF about the successful
UE(s) data subscription transfer using a Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify message.
And central DCCF may not need to notify data consumer of UE mobility events
and/or DCCF reselection events based on configuration.
7\. [Optional] Target DCCF subscribes to the relevant data source(s), if it is
not yet subscribed to the data source(s) for the data required for the data
subscription.
8\. Target DCCF confirms UE(s) data subscription transfer to the source DCCF.
9\. [Optional] Source DCCF unsubscribes with the data source(s) that are no
longer needed for the remaining UE(s) data subscriptions. And target DCCF may
subscribe to relevant data source(s), if not yet subscribed.
NOTE: At this point, UE(s) data subscription transfer is deemed completed.
10-11. Target DCCF collects data from the data source(s) and notifies the data
consumer using a Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify message or via central DCCF.
### 6.66.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
DCCF:
\- Supports UE(s) data subscription transfer procedure.
\- Supports Ndccf_DataManagemen_Transfer service operation to inform the
target DCCF of handover preparation and handover of data subscriptions.
Data Consumer:
\- Supports subscription renewal with a target DCCF instance.
\- Supports Ndccf_DataManagement_Transfer service operation for DCCF
relocation.
## 6.67 Solution #67: Managing analytics input data from ADRF
### 6.67.1 Description
NWDAF and DCCF can request ADRF to store Analytics and data. ADRF exposes a
retrieval service so that NWDAF and DCCF can fetch analytics and data. Fetched
data might be useful for NWDAF to run analytics or training, but this is part
of the NWDAF internal logic, and an NWDAF service consumer cannot control what
data to use. There are cases in which an NWDAF service consumer requires NWDAF
to use a specific input data set, e.g. because certain characteristics of the
data set are known to the service consumer. Examples include testing,
simulations and performance monitoring, but other use cases may be realized.
To realize the use cases above, this solution proposes to:
\- Add a new attribute to the data records stored by ADRF, named DataSetTag,
which contains, at least, an identifier and a descriptor, as illustrated in
the Table 6.67.1-1.
\- Include the DataSetTag attribute in the Nadrf_DataManagement service
operations, so that a service consumer can request the storage of data records
using the DataSetTag and/or retrieve the corresponding data records by
specifying the DataSetTag.
\- Include other consumers of the ADRF services, such as OAM and AF.
\- Include the DataSetTag attribute in the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo,
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription, Nnwdaf_DataManagement and
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service operations, so that a service consumer can
request NWDAF to execute operations using a certain data set, and the output
of the operations will be similarly tagged with the same attribute.
\- In the cases where DCCF is used, then the DataSetTag attribute should be
included also in the service operations exposed by DCCF.

## 6.68 Solution #68: Using data synthesis and compression for data storage
and transfer
### 6.68.1 Description
With the increasing need in 5G and beyond mobile networks to use AI/ML, a
multiplicity of ML tasks will be executed potentially leading to an explosion
of amount of historical data to be stored. With the ADRF being the 5GC NF
deputed to store historical data and analytics, it is important for it save or
limit resources for historical data storage while maintaining quality of
historical data stored. Also, in today\'s highly regulated environment, it\'s
expected that privacy-preserving technologies will become increasingly
pervasive for applications like NWDAF built around the privacy and security of
using sensitive data.
The above are well-known limitations, which are often overcome by using
techniques focusing on reducing the volume of data to be stored and
anonymizing the data records. Compression is a reduction in the number of bits
needed to represent data. Nevertheless, reduction techniques can bring an
appropriate solution to offer a win-win trade-off between data quality, data
quantity and resource saving or limiting for the Database ADRF. Also, Data
Synthesis (DS) is a privacy-preserving technology that allows to also reduce
the amount of stored data.
This solution proposes that NWDAF and ADRF can employ data synthesis tools and
compression techniques respectively to produce input data for inference and/or
training, and to reduce the volume of transferred and stored data. Few
scenarios are possible:
1\. When NWDAF makes a request to retrieve data from ADRF, it includes the
Data Synthesis and Compression (DSC) indicator which indicates its capability
to use a data compression and/or data generation tool. The DSC indicator may
also contain a list of supported techniques, including compression algorithms
and ML models for data synthesis. Then ADRF provides the requested data along
with a descriptor of the tool used to compress/generate data.
NOTE: The DSC indicator contains an attribute to indicate the support for data
compression/generation which should be defined by 3GPP during stage 3, and a
descriptor of the tool which can be configured by the operator.
2\. When NWDAF requests ADRF to store data, it also includes DSC indicator.
This way, less data can be stored by ADRF, and when subsequent data retrieval
requests are issued by NWDAFs for the same dataset, ADRF sends the data
compression/generation descriptor along with the stored data, which are
expected to be significantly less than the data actually needed by the
requesting NWDAF for its operations.

both. DSC descriptor List of supported tools, algorithms and ML models for

## 6.69 Solution #69: Model performance guarantee during Federated Learning
### 6.69.1 Description
This solution addresses aspects of key issue #8 on the following aspects
related to the key issue #8:
\- How to decide whether Federated Learning is required or not?
\- Whether and how to perform model performance monitoring of the NWDAF
Federated Learning operation?
\- How to coordinate multiple NWDAFs including selection of participant NWDAF
instances in the Federated Learning group?
The service may vary in different network areas, which leads to different data
characteristics (i.e. data distribution) of the local dataset in different
MTLFs for model training. If a MTLF has not enough dataset for training a
model with required accuracy level from the AnLF, horizontal federated
learning is required. An AI/ML model trained using data from network areas
could be utilized in a network area served by the AnLF without experiencing
performance degradation, if the characteristics of data used by the AnLF in
its serving area are same or similar with the characteristics of the dataset
used by the MTLFs joining the Federated Learning.
Before each iteration of Federated Learning, the FL server MTLF will deliver
the common model (i.e. the shared initial model of each iteration of Federated
Learning) to each FL client MTLF. The FL client MTLFs use the training
datasets as the validity datasets to calculate the Accuracy-in-Training of the
common model. The Accuracy-in-Training is to indicate the performance of ML
model by comparing prediction with label data in validation dataset reserved
from training dataset. The Accuracy-in-Use is to indicate the performance of
ML model used in live network by comparing the result of inference with the
observed label data, i.e. ground truth from the live network collected in
history. For example:
\- When the model is a model for classification, the Accuracy-in-Training or
Accuracy-in-Use of the model may be represented by Accuracy, Precision or
Recall rate.
\- When the model is a model for regression, the Accuracy-in-Training or
Accuracy-in-Use of the model may be represented by MAE (Mean Absolute Error),
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), or MSE (Mean Squared Error).
If the Accuracy-in-Training of the common model calculated by the MTLF is much
different from the Accuracy-in-Use calculated by the AnLF, the characteristics
of the local dataset of the MTLF must be different from the characteristics of
data used by the AnLF. The FL server should remove the MTLF from the Federated
Learning group before the iteration of Federated Learning to guarantee the
model performance (i.e. the model can be used by the AnLF without performance
degradation).
### 6.69.2 Procedures
Figure 6.69.2-1: Procedure for model performance guarantee during Federated
Learning
Pre-condition: The NWDAFs containing MTLF register in the NRF with the \"FL
capability\" support information, such as FL Server or FL Client. The MTLFs
may register in the NRF with the information of available model, such as
Analytics ID, Model Filter information and Model Accuracy Level.
1\. The consumer NF requests the NWDAF for analytics subscription. The NWDAF
containing AnLF receives Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe request from
the analytics consumer, in which there is preferred level of accuracy of the
analytics required by the analytics consumer. The AnLF accepts the
subscription and send the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe response to
the analytics consumer.
2\. The AnLF derives the Analytics ID, Model Filter information and Model
Accuracy Level from the Analytics ID, Analytics Filter information and
preferred level of accuracy of the analytics from the analytics consumer.
3\. If the AnLF has no model satisfying the derived Analytics ID, Model Filter
information and Model Accuracy Level, the AnLF try to discover a MTLF with the
required model. If the discovered MTLF can provide or train a model that meets
the Model Accuracy Level, the AnLF can get the model for the analytics and go
to step 12 directly. Federated Learning is not required.
If there is no MTLF can provide the model with the required Model Accuracy
Level, the AnLF discovers a MTLF supporting the FL Server (i.e. a MTLF
registers in the NRF with the \"FL capability\" of FL server). Federated
Learning is required.
4\. The AnLF sends the Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request to the FL Server MTLF, in
which there are Analytics ID, Model Filter information and Model Accuracy
Level. The FL Server MTLF discovers candidate FL Client MTLFs from the NRF and
add them into the Federated Learning group.
5\. The FL Server MTLF delivers the initial/common model to AnLF for accuracy
evaluation before each iteration of Federated Learning by the
Nnwdaf_MLModelEvaluation_Request operation.
6\. The AnLF evaluate the accuracy level of the initial/common model with the
collected data in history as the validation dataset. The AnLF provides the
Accuracy-in-Use of the initial/common model to the FL Server MTLF by
Nnwdaf_MLModelEvaluation_Request Response operation.
7\. The FL Server MTLF delivers the initial/common model to each of the FL
Client MTLF for accuracy evaluation before each iteration of Federated
Learning by the Nnwdaf_MLModelEvaluation_Request operation.
8\. The FL Client MTLFs evaluate the accuracy level of the initial/common
model with the local training data as the validation dataset. The FL Client
MTLFs provide the Accuracy-in-Training value of the initial/common model to
the FL Server MTLF by Nnwdaf_MLModelEvaluation_Request Response operation.
9\. The FL Server MTLF compares the Accuracy-in-Training of the initial/common
model from the FL Client MTLFs with the Accuracy-in-Use of the initial/common
model from the AnLF. If the Accuracy-in-Training calculated by a FL Client
MTLF is much different from the Accuracy-in-Use calculated by the AnLF, it can
be assumed that the characteristics of the local dataset of the MTLF would be
different from the characteristics of the data used by the AnLF. Therefore the
FL server can remove the FL Client MTLF from the FL group.
10\. The FL Server MTLF carries out this iteration of the FL with the FL
Client MTLFs in the FL group and generates the total Accuracy-in-Training by
aggregating the received Accuracy-in-Training.
NOTE: The FL Server MTLF repeat the step 5 to step 10 for each iteration of
Federated Learning, until getting a model with a satisfactory accuracy level.
The FL Server may stop to begin a new iteration of Federated Learning when it
finds that there is no accuracy improvement any more.
11\. The FL Server MTLF provides the model getting from the Federated Learning
to the AnLF.
12\. Using the model getting from the Federated Learning, the AnLF provides
analytics outputs to the analytics consumer.
### 6.69.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
The solution has the following impacts:
NWDAF:
\- Support for additional parameters \"Model Accuracy Level\" in the
Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo service operation.
\- When acting as FL Server MTLF, before each iteration of Federated Learning,
gets the accuracy value of the initial/common model from the FL Client MTLFs
or the AnLF and removes the FL Client MTLF from the FL group if the Accuracy-
in-Training of the initial/common model calculated by the FL Client MTLF is
much different from the Accuracy-in-Use calculated by the AnLF.
\- When acting as FL Client MTLF, uses the local dataset as the validity
datasets to calculate the Accuracy-in-Training of the initial/common model
from the FL Server MTLF.
\- When acting as AnLF, use the network data collected in history as the
validity datasets to calculate the Accuracy-in-Use of the initial/common model
from the FL Server MTLF.
## 6.70 Solution #70: Improved control of location granularity
### 6.70.1 Description
The Analytics IDs that provide location information are: UE mobility, Observed
Service Experience, QoS sustainability, Dispersion analytics. In the results
(predictions or statistics), as currently specified in TS 23.288 [5], the
NWDAF returns time-stamped lists of target areas associated with evaluated KPI
values, whose generic model is given in table 6.70-1.
Table 6.70-1: Generic model of timestamped result list in TS 23.288 [5]
Information Description
* * *
Generic entries (1..max) List of generic entries (depending on the Analytics
ID) > Elementary Time slot start and duration Time slot start within the
Analytics target period > UE Location List of TAs or cells which the UE stays
> KPIs List of KPIs specific to each analytic ID
TS 23.288 [5] clause 6.1.3 already allows the NF consumer to control the
granularity of the location analyses provided by the NWDAF.
[OPTIONAL] Preferred granularity of location information: TA level or cell
level.
This granularity control solution does not appear to be sufficient to
implement the existing use cases:
\- Depending on the use case, it may be necessary to distinguish between use
cases relating to trajectory analysis or presence in a given area. The
specification of a trajectory implicitly assumes a temporal granularity, i.e.
the Analytics target period is divided into time slots during which the UE
changes location.
\- The binary choice between a TA and a cell does not offer a progressive
enough granularity setting. It may be necessary to specify an intermediate
size of target area, for example consisting of a number of cells.
Also, it is proposed to add several optional parameters to specify how
location information is required:
\- \"temporal granularity size\": minimum duration of each elementary time
slot (or maximum number of time slots). When this parameter is provided, the
NWDAF should provide analytics per elementary time slot accordingly.
\- \"spatial granularity size\": maximum number of TA or cells of each
elementary area. When this parameter is provided, the NWDAF should provide
analytics per group of TA of cells accordingly.
NOTE: The choice between TA or cells is provided by the existing parameter
\"Preferred granularity of location information\". This principle can be
extended to other techniques for describing location areas (e.g. geographical
area of a given size).
In this case the results are provided in the table below.
Table 6.70-2: Improved generic model of timestamped result list
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Information | Description | +==================================+==================================+ | Generic entries (1..max) | List of generic entries | | | (depending on the Analytics ID) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > Elementary Time slot start | Time slot start within the | | and duration | Analytics target period | | | | | | Each time slot has a duration | | | greater than or equal to the | | | \"temporal granularity size\". | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > UE Location | List of TAs or cells which the | | | UE stays | | | | | | Each list has a size smaller | | | than or equal to the spatial | | | granularity size. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | > KPIs | List of KPIs specific to each | | | analytic ID | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
Additionally, the Maximal number of objects parameter can be used as an
additional limit to limit the size of the result list, especially if it is
organized in a specific order.
### 6.70.2 Procedures
The parameters \"temporal granularity size\" and \"spatial granularity size\"
are optional in requests or subscriptions.
The procedures described in TS 23.288 [5] are not modified.
### 6.70.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality
Consumer NF:
\- May include those parameters in requests and subscriptions
(Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription service).
AnLF:
\- Should consider these parameters in requests and subscriptions.
## 6.71 Solution #71: Traffic flow statistics use case with finer granularity
location information
### 6.71.1 Description
This solution addresses Key issue #9: Enhancement of NWDAF with finer
granularity of location information.
The traffic flow statistics can help plan the efficient operation of rail and
roadway networks during rush hours. The statistics of traffic flow collects
the hotspot map in a certain region in a certain period of time. It enables
traffic regulators and planners make more reasonable bus routes and road
construction plans. In addition, the user can obtain the congestion situation
on the road through statistics. These are all requirements that helps NWDAF
consumers improve their own experience and optimize traffic conditions.
In this scenario, the NWDAF needs to collect traffic flow information from
LCS, including UE ID, location, velocity, environment indication, etc. Then
the NWDAF conducts calculations and predictions based on such information. For
example, the transport tool may be determined by the speed and orientation
information. Average speed information is used to reflect the current
congestion of a certain transport tool.
As to the environment indication, the UE may be indicated aboveground or
underneath, indoor or outdoor, inside or outside the vehicle, etc. The NWDAF
determines which transport tool the UE is currently using based on the
environment indication and other information it collects from the LCS. For
example, if the indication is underneath and the vertical coordinate of the
location is in a underground position, it can be judged that the current
traffic environment of the terminal is in the subway or the probability of
taking the subway is high. If the indicator is on the ground and outdoors, and
the speed is 2-5km/h, it can judge that the current traffic environment of the
user is walking, and the probability of walking is high.
In order to solve the aforementioned issue, this solution proposes that NWDAF
requires some finer granularity location information of the UEs with location,
velocity, environment indication, and so on, and then provide traffic flow
statistics/prediction services for the NWDAF consumer.
### 6.71.2 Input Data
The input data for the analytics are described in Table 6.71.2-1.
Table 6.71.2-1: Input data for traffic flow statistics use case usage
Information Source (NOTE) Description

for the traffic flow use case to the NWDAF.
## 6.72 Solution #72: Use of MDAS analytics for improving AnLF/MTLF analytics
accuracy and data collection
### 6.72.1 Description
Management Data Analytics (MDA), is an enabler of automation and intelligence
for services management and orchestration. An MDA MnS (also referred to as
MDAS) defined in TS 28.104 [15] enables any authorized consumer to request and
receive analytics. The architecture is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 6.72.1-1: MDA functional overview and service framework (source TS
28.104 [15])
According to TS 28.104 [15], a management function (MDAF) may play the roles
of MDA MnS producer, MDA MnS consumer, other MnS consumer, NWDAF consumer and
LMF service consumer, and may also interact with other non-3GPP management
systems.
The internal business logic related to MDA leverages the current and
historical data related to:
\- Performance Measurements (PM) according to TS 28.552 [7] and Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) according to TS 28.554 [9].
\- Trace data, including MDT/RLF/RCEF, according to TS 32.422 [22] and TS
32.423 [23].
\- QoE and service experience data according to TS 28.405 [24] and TS 28.406
[25].
\- Analytics data offered by NWDAF according to TS 23.288 [5] including 5GC
data and external web/app-based information (e.g. web crawler that provides
online news) from AF.
\- Alarm information and notifications according to TS 28.532 [26].
\- CM information and notifications.
\- UE location information provided by LMF according to TS 23.273 [13].
\- MDA reports from other MDA MnS producers.
\- Management data from non-3GPP systems.
Analytics output from the MDA internal business logic are made available by
the management functions (MDAFs) playing the role of MDA MnS producers to the
authorized consumers, (including but not limited to other management
functions, network functions/entities, NWDAF, SON functions, optimization
tools and human operators).
The analytics provided by MDAS include analytics for fault management
predictions/statistics. The MDA can supervise the status of various network
functions and resources, and predict the running trend of network and
potential failures to intervene in advance. These predictions can be used by
the management system to autonomously maintain the health of the network, e.g.
speedy recovery actions on a network function related to the predicted
potential failure.
As part of the analytic output the following information elements can be
provided by the MDAF.

The performance analytics from MDAS can assist the NWDAF AnLF to improve the
accuracy of analytics or the NWDAF MTLF to determine if an ML model requires
re-training.
### 6.72.2 Procedures
#### 6.72.2.1 AnLF subscribing from the MDAS/MDAF for fault prediction
The following call flow provides a detailed procedure on the NWDAF (AnLF)
subscribing from MDAS/MDAF to receive information about fault predictions.
Figure 6.72.2-1: Improving analytics by interacting with MDAS/MDAF for fault
prediction
1\. A consumer requests analytics including an analytic ID according to TS
23.288 [5]. For example, a consumer can request analytics for an analytic ID
for NF load.
2\. The NWDAF determines the Data Producers to collect data to derive
analytics for the analytic ID requested according to TS 23.288 [5].
3\. The NWDAF collects data from the identified data producers according to TS
23.288 [5].
4\. The NWDAF determines the parameters required when requesting fault
predictions from the MDAS/MDAF. The NWDAF may request fault prediction
targeting a service area or may request fault prediction for a Network
Function acting as a data source in steps 2 and 3.
5\. The NWDAF subscribes to the MDAS/MDAF for fault prediction according to TS
28.104 [15].
6\. The MDAS/MDAF determines data producers and collects data according to TS
28.104 [15].
7\. MDAS/MDAF determines a fault.
8\. MDAS/MDAF report to the NWDAF fault prediction. The analytic output may
include one or more parameters listed in Table 6.72.1-1.
9\. The NWDAF based on the information provided in step 8 determines if the
fault affects the accuracy of the analytics. The NWDAF can determine if the
fault affects the inference model for generating analytics or whether the
analytics predictions that are already provided to a consumer are inaccurate.
For example if the fault prediction from the MDAS/MDAF includes an NF identity
(NF id or NF instance ID) indicating that the network function will be
\"misbehaving\" for a specific period of time the NWDAF can disregard the data
for the time duration where the NF is \"misbehaving\" and collect data from
the NF when the NF is operating at its nominal conditions. Based on the data
disregarded the NWDAF can estimate how the analytics accuracy is affected
(i.e. the NWDAF will have less number of samples to generate analytics) and
indicate to the consumer if the analytics accuracy is affected. If the NWDAF
determines that the analytics are not affected by the fault prediction (e.g.
the NF was at fault only for a small period of time and the NWDAF has enough
samples to generate analytics at a requested accuracy) the NWDAF does not need
to report to the consumer an indication that the analytics are not accurate.
The NWDAF may also use statistical information provided by the MDAS/MDAF (e.g.
MDAS/MDAF can notify the NWDAF of an imminent network failure). If the NWDAF
determines that fault indication will affect the analytics accuracy then the
NWDAF notifies the consumer to stop using the analytics provided by the NWDAF
until the network failure is resolved.
10\. If the NWDAF determines that the fault analytics information affects the
accuracy of the analytics the NWDAF reports to the consumer an indication to
stop making decisions. The NWDAF may include a pause indication to the
consumer.
11\. The NWDAF determines that the analytics accuracy is restored, after the
NWDAF has accumulated enough samples from the Data Producer(s) where faults
were predicted.
12\. The NWDAF indicates to the consumer to resume the analytics subscription.
#### 6.72.2.2 MTLF subscribing from the MDAS/MDAF for fault prediction
The following call flow provides a detailed procedure on the NWDAF (MTLF)
subscribing from MDAS/MDAF to receive information about fault predictions.
Figure 6.72.2-2: Improving trained ML model by interacting with MDAS/MDAF for
fault prediction
1\. A consumer requests a trained ML model including an analytic ID according
to TS 23.288 [5].
2\. The NWDAF determines the Data Producers to collect data to train an ML
model for the analytic ID requested according to TS 23.288 [5].
3\. The NWDAF collects data from the identified data producers according to TS
23.288 [5].
4\. The NWDAF determines the parameters required when requesting fault
predictions from the MDAS/MDAF. The NWDAF may request fault prediction
targeting a service area or may request fault prediction for a Network
Function acting as a data source in steps 2 and 3.
5\. The NWDAF subscribes to the MDAS/MDAF for fault prediction according to TS
28.104 [15].
6\. The MDAS/MDAF determines data producers and collects data according to TS
28.104 [15].
7\. MDAS/MDAF determines a fault
8\. MDAS/MDAF report to the NWDAF fault prediction. The analytic output may
include one or more parameters listed in Table 6.72.1-1.
9\. The NWDAF based on the information provided in step 8 determines if the
fault affects the accuracy of the ML model.
\- The NWDAF MTLF disregards the data collected for training the ML model
based on the information provided in the fault prediction. For example, if the
fault prediction from the MDAS/MDAF indicate that a fault is predicted for an
NF for a specific time period the MTLF will disregard any data collected from
this NF collected at the time period where a fault is predicted.
10\. If the NWDAF MTLF determines that the fault affects the accuracy of the
ML model the NWDAF reports to the consumer an indication to stop making
decisions. The NWDAF may include a pause indication to the consumer.
11\. The NWDAF MTLF re-train the ML model using data from the data producer
where a fault is not predicted.
12\. When the NWDAF determines that the train ML model is valid, i.e. after
the NWDAF has accumulated enough samples from the Data Producer(s) where
faults were predicted .The NWDAF indicates to the consumer to resume the
analytics subscription.

## 6.73 Solution #73: How NWDAF requests analytics from MDA Management
Function
### 6.73.1 Description
This solution addresses the Key Issue#10: Interactions with MDAS/MDAF which
focus on define the framework for analytics feedback by MDAF.
Editor\'s note: The feasibility of this solution should be aligned with SA
WG5.
This solution proposes to re-use the MDA functional overview and service
framework in Figure 6.73.1-1 (i.e. Figure 5.1â€‘1 as defined in TS 28.104 [15]).
As an MDA MnS Consumer, NWDAF can trigger the MDA MnS to request analytics
from the MDA Management Function.
Figure 6.73.1-1: MDA functional overview and service framework, TS 28.104 [15]
Before NWDAF requests analytics from the MDA Management Function, the NWDAF
firstly discover the MDA Management Function via the MnS discovery service
producer as defined in clause 5 of TS 28.537 [28].
### 6.73.2 Procedures
Figure 6.73.2-1: Procedure for data collection from MDA Management Function

producer by sending a MnS producer discovery service operation. The service
operation may include the following parameters:
\- requestedMDAType: indicate a specific MDA capability such as Slice coverage
analysis, Mobility performance analysis as defined in clause 7.2 of TS 28.104
[15];
\- Area of Interest;
\- Network Slice information (i.e. NetworkSliceInfo including a DN
(Distinguished Name) of the NetworkSlice managed object relating to the
network slice instance associated to the S-NSSAI and NSI ID if available as
defined in TS 28.541 [29]).
2\. The MnS discovery service producer feedback the address of the MDA
Management Function.
3\. NWDAF requests analytics from the MDA Management Function by triggering a
MDARequest service operation as defined in clause 9.3.2 of TS 28.104 [15]. The
service operation may include the following parameters:
\- requestedMDAOutputs: MDAOutputPerMDAType;
\- reportingMethod: periodic reporting mode, the periodicity or specified time
of the report, etc.;
\- analyticsScope: Area of Interest, Network Slice information, etc.;
\- startTime;
\- stopTime;
\- analyticsWindow.
4\. The MDA Management Function provides the analytics to the NWDAF by
triggering a MDAReporting service operation.
NOTE: NWDAF and MDA Management Function/MnS discovery service producer, if
from different operators, may interact via the Exposure Governance Management
Function as defined in clause A.3 of TS 28.533 [27].
### 6.73.3 Impacts on Existing Nodes and Functionality

producer.
\- NWDAF requests the OAM related analytics from the MDA Management Function.
## 6.74 Solution #74: Supporting NWDAF interactions with MDAF
### 6.74.1 Description
This solution is based on the MDA functional overview and service framework in
Figure 6.73.1-1 (i.e. Figure 5.1 1 as defined in TS 28.104 [15]) re-using the
existing interfaces, i.e. Nnwdaf and MDAS (MDA MnS).
Figure 6.74.1-1: MDA functional overview and service framework, TS 28.104 [15]
When a consumer issues an NWDAF Analytics ID request that relies on management
data analytics input from an MDAF or MDA MnS producer, this request needs to
trigger once received at a particular NWDAF a subsequent request or
subscription towards the appropriate MDAF. The interfaces that can be used for
this interaction are the Nnwdaf for issuing a request or subscription to MDAF
or MDA MnS producer and the MDAS interface for reporting to the NWDAF, as
documented in clause 5.1 of TS 28.104 [15].
A consumer request needs to be analysed and processed by the recipient NWDAF
to issue the subsequent subscription request, i.e. by deriving the
corresponding subscription attributes, towards the MDAF or MDA MnS producer.
The new subscription request may include the following attributes:
\- **MDA Type:** It refers to the desired analytics capability, as specified
in clause 8.1.1 of TS 28.104 [15], e.g. slice throughput analytics, slice
coverage analysis, considering the use cases and requirements for MDA
capabilities as documented in clause 7.2 of TS 28.104 [15]. The MDA type can
be selected based on a pre-configured mapping between an Analytics ID and the
necessary input that include the MDA type. Multiple MDA types can be
potentially carried in a single request depending on the implementation of
MDAF. For each MDA type the consumer can select specific MDA outputs, i.e. out
of a pre-determined list of potential output results, as specified in clause
9.3.2 of TS 28.104 [15].
\- **Relative time schedule:** Considering the time schedule indicated by the
consumer, the recipient NWDAF can estimate the corresponding time schedule
calculating the upper bound time needed to receive the response from the
respective MDAF or MDA MnS producer that relies upon. To achieve this:
i. each MDAF or MDA MnS producer can register in a MnS discovery service
producer as described clause 5.1 of TS 28.537 [28] its capability in terms of
the upper bound time in preparing an analytics result based on the available
CPU, storage resources and the current workload.
ii. alternatively, an MDAF can respond to the requesting NWDAF its capability
in terms of the upper bound time in preparing an analytics result based on the
available CPU, storage resources and the current workload.
iii. the NWDAF needs to have an estimation of the communications latency in
receiving management data analytics. This can be determined by sending a round
trip probe message to estimate the expected latency.
\- **Start/stop time** : It refers to the time schedule for starting and
stopping an analytics subscription request where multiple MDA reporting may
take place each with a specified reporting time window.
\- **Reporting time window:** It refers to the desired reporting time window
related to the management data analytics output from MDAF.
\- **Reporting analytics samples:** This indicates how the reporting of the
management data analytics samples can be presented, e.g. average value, min-
max value, discrete time-based samples, etc.
\- **Analytics subscription type:** Considering the request type from the
consumer, i.e. on-demand request (immediate) or on-demand/periodic request at
a specified timed, the NWDAF needs to select the appropriate timing related to
the subsequent request towards the MDAF or MDA MnS producer.
\- **Reporting method:** It refers to the way of receiving the result from
MDAF or MDA MnS producer. The NWDAF may request an MDAF or MDA MnS producer to
report in a file format when the result has a relatively bigger size, stream-
based reporting that suits real-time data or notification based where the
consumer receives a notification to fetch the data.
\- **Area of Interest:** Can be explicitly specified by the consumer and in
this case the NWDAF requests the same area capability, i.e. be capable to
produce analytics in the specified area, to MDAF or MDA MnS producer.
\- **Network Slice** : It refers to information (i.e. NetworkSliceInfo
including a DN (Distinguished Name) of the NetworkSlice managed object
relating to the network slice instance associated to the S-NSSAI and NSI ID if
available as defined in TS 28.541 [29]).
\- **Target UE(s):** NWDAF focuses on a particular UE ID (Subscription
Permanent Identifier - SUPI), while the management plane, i.e. MDAF or MDA MnS
producer considers the average UE in a particular location. Specifically, when
NWDAF needs MDAF or MDA MnS producer output, e.g. resource utilization
prediction, in relation to a UE or a group of UE, that reside in a particular
area, it needs to translate the location of UE(s) into an area in the form of
cells or TAs.
\- **Filtering conditions:** Refers to the conditions included in a consumer
request, which indicate the report triggering criteria. The recipient NWDAF
needs to identify where filtering conditions can be applied and include any of
them that relate to the subsequent request towards MDAF or MDA MnS producer.
The NWDAF also needs to perform the discovery of the appropriate MDAF or MDA
MnS producer needed, by contacting the respective MnS discovery service
producer as in clause 5 of TS 28.537 [28]. MDAF or MDA MnS producers need to
register themselves to the respective Service Directory with their management
capabilities described by MnS information or MnS profile.
NOTE: The details for the MDA MnS producer discovery by the NWDAF may be based
on the existing procedure defined in TS 28.537 [28].
### 6.74.2 Procedures
If a consumer requires analytics from NWDAF that rely on input from MDAF the
following apply.
Figure 6.74.2-1: Supporting NWDAF interworking with MDAFrequest and response
Precondition: Initially MDAF(s) or MDA MnS producers register their
capabilities, i.e. MnS information or MnS profile as described in clause 5 of
TS 28.537 [28] to a MnS discovery service producer. The MnS discovery service
producer may contain all or partial information related to the capabilities of
MDA MnS producer.
1 An analytics consumer issues a request using either on-demand request or
subscription method towards the selected NWDAF as described in TS 23.288 [5].
2\. The recipient NWDAF uses the Analytics Request Processing or Analytics
Logic (that resides within the same function or can alternative be a separated
NF) to determine the requirements of the received analytics request to
identify the corresponding attributes (i.e. as mentioned above: Analytics ID,
Relative time schedule, Reporting time window, etc.).
3\. The recipient NWDAF performs the discovery of the corresponding MDAF or
MDA MnS producer. The discovery step can take place in two different ways:
i. the recipient NWDAF requests the Service Directory indicating the desired
capabilities for a target MDAF or MDA MnS producer in step 3a and receives a
reply in step 3b suggesting the set of MDAF or MDA MnS producer including the
corresponding address to select from,
ii. the recipient NWDAF only receives basic profile information, i.e. the
address, from the Service Directory in steps 3a and 3b and needs in step 3c to
request from each suggested MDAF or MDA MnS producer its capabilities before
being able to select the desired one(s).
4\. If the discovery process returns an empty set, i.e. with no results that
can fulfil the desired capabilities, then the NWDAF may optionally negotiate
with the analytics consumer, i.e. to change or downgrade, the requirements of
the analytics request. The requirements that the NWDAF may negotiate with the
consumer if the desired one(s) cannot be fulfilled may include the:
a Reporting time window where the NWDAF can propose a new reporting time
window based on the received MDAF or MDA MnS producer options set provided by
the discovery process.
b Analytics subscription type where the NWDAF can degrade the analytics
subscription type, e.g. from an on-demand immediate response to a response
estimating an additional latency, based on the received set of MDAF or MDA MnS
producer options provided by the discovery process.
If a solution cannot be reached in the negotiation step or if the negotiation
step is not supported, then the process is terminated at this point.
5\. If the suggested set of MDAF or MDA MnS producer that fulfils the desired
capabilities is nonempty or a negation step assisted in reaching a solution,
then the recipient NWDAF selects the desired MDAF or MDA MnS producer out of
the suggested set and then prepares the format the corresponding MDA request,
i.e. by deriving the requirements or corresponding attributes of the MDA
request.
6\. The MDA request is issued automatically towards the selected MDAF or MDA
MnS producer.
7\. The MDAF or MDA MnS producer prepares the MDA result.
8\. The MDAF or MDA MnS producer returns the MDA responds providing the
desired analytics output results.
9\. The recipient NWDAF collects additionally raw data from other data
sources, which may include NFs, MnSs, repository functions, e.g. NRF, UDR,
URM, data collection entities, e.g. DCCF, ADRF, to calculate the requested
analytics result.
10\. The NWDAF prepares the analytics result.
11\. The NWDAF provides the analytics response towards the analytics consumer
that includes the requested result.
### 6.74.3 Impacts on services, entities and interfaces
\- NWDAF contains or interact with the Analytics Request Processing or
Analytics Logic to determine the attributes of the MDAF on-demand request or
subscription.
\- NWDAF discovers of the appropriate MDAF or MDA MnS producer form the MnS
discovery service producer.
\- NWDAF requests or subscribes to the desired OAM related analytics from the
corresponding MDAF or MDA MnS producer.
\- NWDAF may optionally negotiate with the analytics requirements related to a
consumer request.
# 7 Overall Evaluation
## 7.1 Key Issue #1: How to improve correctness of NWDAF analytics
According to the Table 6.0-1, solutions #1-#7, solutions #28-#36, and
solutions #61-#63 are proposed for Key Issue #1. All proposed solutions can be
categorized in the following categories:
\- Support for using multiple ML models (4 solutions).
\- Dataset properties and ML model accuracy management (6 solutions).
\- Detection of drift of an ML model (6 solutions).
\- Receiving feedback from service consumers to NWDAF (3 solutions).
\- Accuracy report from NWDAF to the service consumer (2 solution).
In the following each category will be evaluated separately.
**Support for using multiple ML models**
Solutions #1, #28, #31, #36 and #62 propose multiple ML models for improving
overall accuracy of prediction generated by NWDAF. Having multiple ML models
for a single analytics report helps NWDAF containing MTLF to provide more than
one ML model during provisioning to NWDAF containing AnLF. When a prediction
is being generated, NWDAF containing AnLF has more than one ML model available
to use. This allows the NWDAF containing AnLF to choose a suitable ML model
depending on, e.g. UE location, time of day, network load, or any other filter
of information.
Solution #1 is about using several ML models by NWDAF(AnLF) and them voting
and choosing the best prediction using an internal scoring mechanism. It also
includes enhancing provisioning procedure to provide pairs of unique
identifiers of the ML model and its corresponding ML model information when
multiple ML models are available for an analytics report.
Solution #31 proposes providing several analytics reports to service consumer
and let the service consumer to choose between delivered results for an
analytics report. The service can use for instance confidence level in the
analytics reports and choose the one with the highest value.
Solution #36 enhances ML model provisioning in a way that NWDAF containing
AnLF includes extra information i.e. inputs about the data used for inference
to NWDAF containing MTLF, when ML model provisioning process is triggered.
This allows the NWDAF containing MTLF to select one out of multiple ML models,
or even generate a new one. In this solution, the NWDAF containing AnLF
receives a single ML model as per existing procedures. Only the NWDAF
containing MTLF is assumed to have access to multiple ML Models, from which
one of them is selected and provisioned to the NWDAF containing AnLF.
Solution #62 proposes a method to choose between multiple ML models when
available for a single analytics ID, by introducing an additional optional
parameter called \"use case context\" provided by the consumer. This parameter
is used as a guideline to NWDAF to choose the best ML model that can be
suitable for the context of the usage of the requested analytics report. NWDAF
containing AnLF or NWDAF containing MTLF will use this parameter to choose
between a set of already provisioned ML models or choose an ML model to
provision. Since the new parameter \"use case context\" do not need to be
standardized, a wide variety of use cases can be supported.
Solution #28 proposes that different ML models can be associated with an
analytics ID during the process of improving the Analytics ID performance. It
proposes that upon identification an unstable Analytics ID (i.e. with
performance degradation), MTLF can be triggered by a notification about such
degradation and decide to change training configuration parameters of the ML
model of an analytics ID, re-select a different ML model, or deactivate ML
models, in order to improve the analytics ID performance.
**Dataset properties and ML model accuracy management**
Solutions #2, #3, #33, #35, #61, and #63 propose technics for ML model
accuracy management by providing information about the datasets used to train
ML models.
Solution #2 is applicable to the Service Experience analytics ID. The solution
proposes that when the AF provides Service Experience Information for a group
UEs, the AF also provides a \"Service Experience Contribution Weight\" with
each UE\'s Service Experience value. The \"Service Experience Contribution
Weight\" is determined by the AF and indicates the relative importance of each
UE\'s Service Experience. This information can be used by the NWDAF containing
MTLF to include more important values when predictions are generated.
Solution #3 is about calculation of ML model validation in NWDAF containing
MTLF (Accuracy in Training) and then ML model accuracy measurement in NWDAF
containing AnLF. Then, NWDAF containing AnLF collects the actual data and
reports the measured accuracy (Accuracy in Use) as feedback to NWDAF
containing MTLF. Diverging between these two values is detected by NWDAF
containing AnLF and will be a sign that NWDAF containing MTLF needs to take
action to improve the analysed ML model. This solution can be useful to
increase the quality of ML models trained by NWDAF containing MTLF where a
metric can be used to evaluate the ML model\'s performance dynamically.
However, the usage of Accuracy in Use needs to be elaborated in a clearer way,
for example, it is not clear how to detect that the actions of the NFs based
on predictions modify the result of a prediction, thus, invalidating the input
for the Accuracy in Use.
Solution #33 introduces a way for a service consumer to request corrections,
in time, of analytics predictions NWDAF will then send corrected predictions
within a time window to the service consumer.
Solution #35 discusses a way to further classify a AoI into sub-areas with
different properties. A service consumer subscribes to the area monitoring
analytics service from NWDAF and NWDAF will provide information about expected
environment properties. Also, NWDAF subscribes to a service to receive an
identifier associated to the properties of the monitored area. Areas with
similar properties will be associated to the same ID. The benefits consist in
enabling the re-use of ML models based on similarity of input data sets,
rather than based only on same AOI.
Solution #61 considers further training of an existing ML model instead of
training a new ML model. The solution assumes that previously training ML
models are stored in ADRF which are referred as historical ML models. Such
historical ML models are then trained with extra data to increase the accuracy
and extending the spatial validity of and ML model. A further trained ML model
is then provisioned by NWDAF containing MTLF to NWDAF containing AnLF. A
further training process is initiated if no exact match for an ML model with
respect to the filter information from a service consumer is found in ADRF.
For instance, if filter information limits the analytics report to TA-1,2
NWDAF containing MTLF looks for historical ML models with the same TA, and if
it didn\'t find a match but an ML model with TA-1,3 is found, then the model
will be further trained to cover TA-1,2,3. Furthermore, NWDAF containing MTLF
should be able to modify the ML filter information received from the NWDAF
containing AnLF. When the training is completed, NWDAF containing MTLF will
store the ML model in ADRF which can be provisioned to NWDAF containing AnLF
for inference.
Solution #63 proposes a rating mechanism for 3rd party data sources. It is
proposed that the quality of the data needs to be checked and shall not be
consumed by the NWDAF MTLF especially if there is a significant change in the
data distribution or if there is a significant drift between predictions and
ground truth data. There are two ways to conduct the data source performance
monitoring and report:
Option 1: A service consumer evaluates the quality of an analytics report on
behalf of NWDAF containing AnLF and reports back the result of evaluation to
NWDAF containing AnLF.
Option 2: NWDAF containing MTLF performs an evaluation process on an ML model
and informs NWDAF containing AnLF if any degradation is detected. Finally,
NWDAF containing MTLF asks NWDAF containing AnLF for validation check of data
sources.
**ML model drift detection**
Solutions #4, #5, #7, #28, #29, #30, and #32 propose solutions for ML model
drift detection.
Solution #4 proposes the MTLF to determine model drift by comparing historical
data with real-time data
Solution #5 is about error monitoring of ML models when a model is
provisioned. If any error is detected in an ML model, then proper action e.g.
re-training will be triggered. Two options are presented for detecting the
drift of the ML model. Option #1 is based on detection performed at an NWDAF
containing AnLF. Option #2 is based on detection performed at an NWDAF
containing MTLF.
Option #1 is based on a comparison, performed at an NWDAF containing AnLF,
between the result of a prediction and the actual value.
Option #2 is based on the NWDAF containing MTLF collecting the data and/or
events that have been previously collected by the NWDAF containing AnLF, and a
subsequent computation of the differences between the set of trained data at
step and the collected events/data. This option implies a duplication in the
collection of data, on one side by the NWDAF containing AnLF and in another
side by the NWDAF containing MTLF, which is not efficient, even in cases where
ADRF is used to store the collected data.
Solution #7 introduces the notion of a new Trusted Rating Logical Function,
which delivers to the analytics consumers the rating of each Analytics ID for
a given NWDAF and delivers to AnLF the rating of each ML model for a given
MTLF. Also, the TRLF allows NWDAF service consumers to generate the rating for
the Analytics ID and ML model, depending on the scenario. The ratings are
determined based on metrics which are defined by the provider of the Analytics
ID/ML model, but they can be set by the operator too and they might include
accuracy. This allows the service consumer to select an NWDAF taking into
account such rating. Then NWDAF can generate a token for rating the
correctness of analytics reports, thus ensuring that only real consumers
provide the rating. Despite the solutions may penalize an NWDAF with low
rating, it enables an NWDAF with low rating to trigger re-training of the ML
models used by that NWDAF. The task of evaluating NWDAF performance seems to
be relevant to OAM and NWDAF (e.g. containing AnLF).
Solution #28 proposes that a NWDAF with tracing capability assesses accuracy
of prediction by comparing predicted and ground truth if the analytics
consumer NF does not provide feedback about the quality of the analytics or it
can calculate the impact of the analytics according to the change of relevant
KPIs of the NF. The NWDAF can store the information of previous performance of
Analytics IDs and their internal configuration, such as ML models. Based on
this information, the NWDAF can identify unstable analytics IDs and notify
NWDAF with MTLF that actions to improve the associated ML model to the
unstable analytics ID are required.
Solution #29 is about detecting ML model drift in by NWDAF containing AnLF and
report it back to NWDAF containing MTLF for proper action. The solution
enables the NWDAF containing MTLF to learn about NWDAF containing AnLF using
already provisioned ML Models, and a subsequent subscription from the NWDAF
containing MTLF to those NWDAFs containing AnLF, which send notifications when
they detect the ML model degradation. The NWDAF containing MTLF marks degraded
ML models and takes the proper action (e.g. ML Model retraining, indication of
\"degraded\" ML model in ML Model provisioning service operation, choose
another ML model for the same Analytics ID).
Solution #30 is about a method where either NWDAF containing MTLF or AnLF will
monitor one or multiple ML models for analytics report to evaluate the
accuracy of an ML model. The overall solution is appropriate, but it needs to
be established in a better way. For instance, it should be clear whether it is
NWDAF containing MTLF or AnLF (NWDAF containing AnLF would be preferred) who
is responsible for an ML model evaluation.
Solution #32 proposes that the NWDAF containing MTLF subscribes to the NWDAFs
containing AnLF in order to get the performance of previously provisioned ML
Models. The NWDAF containing AnLF will then detect possible ML model
degradation and will inform the NWDAF containing MTLF accordingly.
**Receiving feedback from service consumers to NWDAF**
Solutions #4, #6, and #28 are improving accuracy of NWDAF using feedback from
the service consumers.
Solution #4 is about feedback from the service consumer to NWDAF containing
AnLF which will be forwarded to NWDAF containing MTLF. The analytics consumer
reports a network behaviour change that may affect the analytics accuracy. The
MTLF uses the information to evaluate the performance of the ML Model.
Solution #6 is about sending feedback from the service consumer to NWDAF
containing AnLF. The feedback which is mentioned in this proposal is simple
and does not carry any extra information about type of the action which is not
relevant to what NWDAF does. The proposed solution seems to be reasonable and
feasible but needs more clarification for instance about how ML model accuracy
parameters are calculated to detect if an ML model is degraded.
Solution #28 proposes a method to assess accuracy of prediction based on
feedback information related to the effect of an analytics on the changes in
network status after the consumption of analytics. The feedback has
information about performance of an analytics ID by monitoring relevant KPIs.
The monitoring process will provide Analytics ID Grade Information and
Unstable Analytics ID information which will be used to measure the
correctness of each analytics ID.
**Accuracy report from NWDAF to the service consumer**
Solution #34 proposes documenting the accuracy of Analytics IDs into an
accuracy report which can be used by a consumer NF to manage the subscription
e.g. terminate the subscription is accuracy is low or take the reported
accuracy into account when a decision is being taken or by OAM. The detailed
accuracy report is meant to scope the measurement of accuracy in the same way
as Analytics requests are scoped, i.e. per Analytics ID, for a specific area,
slice, (group of) UEs, in a given time window. The accuracy report is
instrumental to monitor the accuracy of predictions from NWDAF, which is a
necessary to determine e.g. if training is required. This solution provides a
procedure to monitor accuracy based on MTLF, assisted by AnLF and ADRF
respectively to provide Analytics output data (i.e. predictions) and to store
the data (i.e. output data and the true observed events) labelled by a
MonitorCorrelationID needed by MTLF to fetch the right data. The benefit of
such solution consists in relieving AnLF from executing accuracy monitoring
and posing the burden of the task on MTLF which is designed for heavy tasks.
Solution #28 proposes a method of NWDAF sending the Analytics Consumer the
notifications about the status of Analytics (IDs). These notifications can
indicate an unstable analytics ID, a stable analytics ID, or a cooling
duration time. Additionally Solution #28 proposes that the NWDAF that detected
a degradation of performance of an Analytics (ID) can inform other AnLF and/or
MTLF about such information enabling improvement actions to be taken by NWDAFs
without the capacity to determine by themselves the performance information of
an Analytics ID.

**Similarity:**
Both of the solutions aim at the NWDAF assisted application detection for the
packets which will not introduce any enhancement on PDR activation, SDF
detection, QoS control, etc.
The NWDAF in both Sol#8 and Sol#9 needs to collect the QoS flow level traffic
information in UPF.
**Difference:**
Sol#8 introduces a new terminology, i.e. Service Type, to describe unknown
applications. which leads to some new problems. E.g. how the Service Type
detection and Service Type QoS control can co-exist with the existing SDF
detection and QoS control, which will cause complexity to the existing
mechanism of 5G system. However information omitting a service type would not
be useful to derive policies for unknown applications. So that it is proposed
that the handling of unknown applications is left to next release
Sol#8 assumes some input from the AF although the presumed underlying use case
is to become independent of AF-provided information.
Solution 9 covers only changes of PFDs for known applications (e.g. change of
server address while other characteristics of the flow remain the same)
**Open issues for both solutions:**
Both solutions rely on new UDR reporting mechanism which are supposed to be
introduced by FS_UPEAS and require coordination with the results of that
study.
Both solutions do not answer the question how degradation of UPF performance
due to excessive reporting load at the UDR can be avoided (as required in the
key issue description). This may depend on FS_ UPEAS conclusions.

Solution #10, #38, #39 and #40 all suggest to use a central entry point for
incoming requests for analytics and/or data, e.g. to authorize and filter
those request and responses, to deliver the analytics and/or data. The
differences are in the selection of the entry point:
Solution #10 introduces a new 5GC NF, i.e. Gateway Exposure Function (GEF),
which is responsible for:
\- data/analytics exposure to other PLMNs, by enforcing constraints on the
type and amount of data exposed to each PLMN according to roaming agreement;
\- obtaining the user consent for data collection where applicable.
Solution #38 proposes that the NWDAF serves as central entry point for related
requests, authorizes requests and restricts exposed data and analytical
information. That is, data and analytics information are exchanged between the
H-NWDAF and the V-NWDAF directly.
Solution #39 proposes that the consumer NF (e.g. NWDAF or other 5GC NF) in
HPLMN subscribes to data/analytics information of the VPLMN via the H-DCCF and
V-DCCF. The V-DCCF checks whether the consumer NF from the HPLMN is authorized
to obtain data/analytics from the VPLMN.
Solution #40 proposes that the NWDAF in HPLMN (/VPLMN) behaves as an untrusted
AF to the VPLMN (/HPLMN) and performs data collection or analytics
subscription from the VPLMN (/HPLMN) via the NEF. The NEF is responsible for
authorizing the data collection or analytics subscription request, by checking
user consent, operator policy, regulatory constraints and/or roaming
agreements.

Both Solution #11 and Solution #37 propose analytics information exchange for
PDU Session management in home routed roaming cases:
\- both Solution #11 and Solution #37 proposes that the AMF uses slice load
level analytics of the HPLMN for Network Slice selection, while Solution #11
also proposes that the AMF uses NF load analytics of the HPLMN for SMF
selection;
\- Solution #37 proposes that the H-PCF uses service experience analytics of
the HPLMN to adjust QoS parameters for the PDU Session.
Solution #17 proposes that the H-PCF uses service experience analytics (or
slice load level analytics) of the VPLMN to decide on the NSSP in URSP rules
provisioned to the UE roaming in the VPLMN.
Solution#38 contains the following two aspects:
\- the H-NWDAF collects VPLMN data from the V-NWDAF;
\- the V-NWDAF retrieves the \"UE analytics profile\" from the H-NWDAF for an
inbound roaming UE and use it for determining analytics related to that UE for
consumers NFs in the VPLMN;
where the data collection and \"UE analytics profile\" sharing between the
PLMNs may raise security and privacy issues, and therefore rely on roaming
agreements / operator policy and user consent.

The solution evaluation for Category-1 is the following:
Models are trained and retrieved from NWDAF containing MTLF. ADRF is suggested
as an intermediate storage of models, before NWDAF containing AnLF retrieves
them. Nothing prevents an NWDAF containing AnLF to retrieve the models
directly from an NWDAF containing MTLF, this service is already available in
Rel-17. Adding ADRF as an intermediate storage adds multiple ways to retrieve
models, increase number of NFs included and thereby complexity and increase
signalling between NFs. Models are viewed as business secrets and shall be
protected. Model privacy when storing models in ADRF may be a concern,
therefore, SA3 needs to investigate how to securely store the model without
leaking privacy information.
In Rel-17, MTLF provides the model storage URL and FQDN information to the
AnLF. In other words, the MTLF manages the repository where models are stored,
obviously this repository is standardized in R17. Therefore, since the ADRF
function is built to maintain a centralized repository for AIML operations
across the network, it is logical that ADRF can be reused to store the ML
models. In addition, saving the ML model generates the additional signalling,
in R17 it is hidden under the implementation, now it has been shown due to the
standardization of the procedure.
The solution evaluation for Category-2 is the following:
Solution#12 proposes that the source DCCF initiates the DCCF and MFAF
reselection due to UE mobility. Target DCCF (MFAF) gets the data subscription
and pending outputs from the source DCCF (MFAF). This solution is aligned with
the purpose of deploying a DCCF, which is managing the complexity of
subscriptions on behalf of the data consumer. Indeed, the benefit of the
solution is that the data consumer does not need to resend the data
subscription to the target DCCF and data/notifications are not lost during the
process. Also, the solution provides a procedure to cover MFAF re-location, in
case MFAFs are deployed separately from DCCF. The solution works when the data
subscription is for single UE, not for group UE or any UE.
Solution#44 argues that it is good enough to terminate the data subscription
to the old DCCF and the data consumer does the DCCF selection and subscribes
to the new DCCF due to UE mobility. Ulike NWDAF relocation, where the target
NWDAF may need the same data and ML model from the source NWDAF in order to
have consistent analytics performance, nothing is really needed by the target
DCCF from the source DCCF. Therefore, Solution#44 proposes a simple and clean
solution that the old DCCF terminates the subscription and the data consumer
select and subscribe to a new DCCF, which has no impact to the current
standards.
Solution#66 proposes that when the data consumer subscribes to the source DCCF
directly, upon change of a source DCCF instance, it is required to inform the
related data consumer of the event and possibly to update subscriptions
between the DCCF and the data consumer. If the central DCCF is deployed, data
consumer collects UE data via the central DCCF, data consumer may not need to
be notified of the UE mobility events and DCCF reselection events.
The solution evaluation for Category-3 is the following:
Solution#41 proposes that when the buffer of the data producer is about to
overflow, the data producer informs the data consumer that it cannot keep the
muted notifications and send all the muted notifications to the data consumer.
Solution#45 covers Solution#41 and it also proposes that the data consumer can
provide exception instruction to the data provider and the data provider will
make the final decision on how to treat the muted notifications when its
buffer is overflow.
The solution evaluation for Category-4 is the following:
Solution#46 proposes enhancement for the ADRF/NWDAF data management. In
particular, data consumer can provide Storage Handling Information to
ADRF/NWDAF. In addition, ADRF/NWDAF is also provisioned with the storage
policy of the operator. Note that, despite all the data belongs to the
operator, it may not be enough to only have the storage policy applied at the
data storage. Enabling Storage Handling Information from individual data
consumer allows an operator to deploy flexible rules and to gain more granular
control over the desired policies. Also, it is possible for the data consumer
to be informed if some data is to be deleted.
Furthermore, Solution#46 proposes the option in which DCCF maintains the data
storage information, so that it executes tasks towards the data storage on
behalf of the data consumer and informs the data consumer about the data
deletions on behalf of the data storage.
Solution#64 proposes enhancement for data collection and reporting of network
data for NWDAF. In order to optimize the performance and accuracy of data
collection and reduce the impact on data producers, data can be reported in a
specified idle period of the device and data collection frequency can be set
to the dynamic Non-fixed sampling ratio. However, notifications are generated
when events occur, and it is not clear how the consumer (e.g. NWDAF) will know
the best time for the producer to report events. It appears better to let the
NF decide when it is too busy to send a report immediately and delay sending a
report (which can be done via implementation). The non-fixed sampling ratio,
which adjusts according to NF loading seems a more useful mechanism.
Solution#65 proposes that the NWDAF to register in the UDM for the served UE,
also for Analytics IDs that are not UE-related. The NWDAF may do this when the
NWDAF is collecting data specific to the UE for the indicated Analytics ID.
This further reduces signalling due to data collection and storage volume.
Solution#67 proposes enhancement for the ADRF/NWDAF data management. In
particular, data records stored at ADRF are associated to a DataSetTag which
enables the service consumer to store and retrieve data sets by specifying
such tag in the service request. The advantage of this solution is not only to
group data that should belong together using a quick reference to the data set
as a whole, but it also enables an analytics consumer (respectively an AnLF)
to indicate what exact input data to be used by AnLF (respectively by MTLF)
for inference (respectively for training).
Solution#68 proposes enhancement for the ADRF/NWDAF data management to enable
NWDAF and ADRF to employ data synthesis tools and compression techniques
respectively to produce input data for inference and/or training, and to
reduce the volume of transferred and stored data. In particular, the solution
introduces the DSC Indicator as an attribute included in the
Nadrf_DataManagement service operations which indicates the data processing
executed over the stored/fetched data, let such processing be data synthesis
or compression. The benefit of this solution is that it permits the re-use of
synthetic data for privacy preserving purposes, as well as the re-use
compressed data to reduce the volume of transferred and stored data.
## 7.5 Key Issue #5: Enhance trained ML Model sharing
According to the Table 6.0-1, solution#13, #14, #15, #43 and #47 are proposed
for Key Issue 5.
Solution #13 and #14 supports sharing of model via ML model file format. When
the NWDAF (containing MTLF) registers its NF profile with NRF, the solution
#13 and #14 provide means to include ML model file formats in its NF profile.
In addition, Solution #14 also includes Supported AI Framework in its NF
profile.
Solution #15 introduces Interoperable Indicator indicating what an NWDAF
containing MTLF decides to share based on business needs.
Solution #47 introduces Interoperable Token indicating that a certain model is
agreed to be share based on business agreements and interoperable testing. The
solution supports sharing of models as OCI images and can also support ML
model file serialization format. The solution supports multiple environments
in which models run in different AnLFs. Neither the format nor the environment
is specified in 3GPP, these are rather described in a container which is out
of scope out 3GPP.
Solution #47 supports all functionality specified in solution#13, #14 and #15.
Solution #43 is mainly about storing models in ADRF and in KI#5 aspects to be
studied are how to enhance trained ML Model sharing between NWDAFs from
different vendors. Solution#43 is therefore not evaluated in this KI.
The common characteristics to enable trained ML model sharing between
different vendors includes
a) Interoperability indicator (Solution 15),
b) Interoperable Token (Solution 47),
c) ML model filter information i.e. ML model file format supported including
serialization file formats (Solution 13 and 14), Supported AI Framework
Information (Solution 14).
Both a) and c) parameters are complementary to each other. The interoperable
indicator allows the MTLF to determine whether to expose the certain ML models
to another provider\'s AnLF or not, and then if allowed select the model. For
a selected trained ML model, the ML model filter information (ML model file
format and AI Framework information) indicates the ML environment the ML model
is trained in and associated output file format.
## 7.6 Key Issue #6: NWDAF-assisted URSPs
According to the Table 6.0-1, solution#16, #17, #48 and #49 are proposed for
Key Issue 6.
The solutions are evaluated based on the following criteria, aligned with the
description of the KI.
1\. Whether any and which components of the URSP rules can benefit from
analytics.
2\. Whether and how existing Analytics IDs, or new Analytics ID(s) can be used
to assist in the generation of URSP Rules.
3\. What procedures trigger the subscription to these Analytics IDs.
4\. Whether new (set of) interactions(s) are required to assist in the
generation of URSP Rules as defined in Rel17, and how to define the new
interactions if needed.
5\. What information should be collected (or provided) as input (or output) by
the NWDAF for these Analytics IDs.
The table below shows a summary of the mapping between fields in URSP rules
and the proposal of analytics used for assistance on these fields for the
different solutions:

Location Criteria Based on the validity period and spatial validity provided
in the Analytics ID used for RSD generation. Set restrictions based on New
\"URSP rule experience\"
**Solution #16:**
This solution proposes to use existing analytics to adjust the values of some
fields in the URSP rules according to the table 1 above. It provides examples
about how the analytics should be used by PCF for the adjustment of URSP
fields:
\- S-NSSAI: Select the S-NSSAI that provides best results for an application
for aspects as service experience, network slice load, Session management
congestion control and/or average data rate in the network slice based on
analytics for service experience, network slice load, Session management
Congestion Control Experience and dispersion analytics respectively.
\- DNN: Similar to the first bullet but to obtaining best service experience
for the application and/or session management control experience based on
Service Experience and Session management Congestion Control Experience
analytics.
\- Non-Seamless Offload Indication: The PCF may get first a prediction of the
location where the UE will use an application, by subscribing to \"UE
Communication\", and then get the information about the performance of the
3GPP and WLAN accesses on that location by subscribing to \"Network
Performance\", \"User Data Congestion\" and \"WLAN performance\" analytics
respectively. Then, if the prediction of the performance on the WLAN access is
good enough, the PCF may decide to set the indication to reduce the load on
the 3GPP access if needed.
\- SSC Mode Selection, PDU Session Type and Access Type preference: Select the
combination of these parameters that provides best service experience for the
application, based on the enhancement of \"Service Experience\" analytics,
which considers also these parameters.
\- PDU Session Pair ID and RSN: The PCF decides whether to set these values
based on the result of the analytic \"Redundant Transmission Experience\".
While how the additional redundant PDU Session can be triggered is not
mentioned in this solution.
\- Time Window and Location Criteria: It is proposed to set these values based
on the time validity period and spatial validity in the analytics used as
input for the other URSP fields adjustment.
Similar to other parameters as RAT type and Frequency already included in
existing \"Service Experience\" analytics, this solution proposes to enhance
existing \"Service Experience\" analytic in order to collect additional input
data about the SSC mode, PDU session Type and Access Type used and then extend
the output of the analytic with those parameters.
The PCF can also request analytic of combination of several RSCs in one RSD,
for example the combination of S-NSSAI + DNN or the combination of PDU session
type + SSC mode and etc. to NWDAF. The NWDAF should support to provide the
analytic of combination of several RSCs to PCF. The PCF can adjust the RSD
precedence according to the analytic from NWDAF, and also the PCF can receive
the analytic of the whole RSD (if the combination of RSCs are the RSCs
included in one RSD) or different arbitrary combination of RSCs in URSP rule.
**Solution #17:**
This solution proposes the PCF may adjust the values of S-NSSAIs in URSP rules
for an application in a UE in roaming, based on the result of analytics
(\"Service Experience\", \"Network Slice load level\", etc..) obtained from
the V-PLMN where the UE is roaming.
It proposes a procedure for the H-PCF to obtain the analytics from the V-PLMN,
based on query to the H-NWDAF of the value of those analytics in the V-PLMN
and then H-NWDAF contacting with V-NWDAF in the V-PLMN. It also proposes the
H-NWDAF does the mapping of S-NSSAI values from the Home to the VPLMN and
discovers the V-NWDAF by querying NSSF and v-NRF. However, it is considered
this proposal is more related with KI#3 (\"Data and analytics exchange in
roaming case\") and should be aligned with the conclusions of that KI.
FS_UEPO, key issue 1, aims to enable the provisioning of URSP rules in the
VPLMN and may thus remove the need for the H-PCF to determine NSSP.
Coordination is required.
**Solution #48:**
It proposes to use some existing analytics to adjust following URSP fields,
according to the table 1:
\- S-NSSAI: Similar to solution #16, it proposes to select the values of
S-NSSAI for an application based on the analytics result for \"Slice Load
Level\" for the different candidates S-NSSAI.
\- DNN: Select the DNN which gets better predicted values for the DN
performance for an application based on \"DN Performance\" analytics. The DN
performance also applies to the traffic descriptors with application server IP
address, S-NSSAI and DNN.
\- Access Type: Based on the predictions of the performance/experience for
3GPP and non-3GPP accesses using Enhanced \"Service Experience\" and \"WLAN
Performance\" analytics.
Also similar to solution #16, it is proposed an enhancement of \"Service
Experience\" analytic to provide the service experience information depending
on the access type of PDU session.
The analytic from NWDAF indicates both the single RSC performance and the
combination of RSC in certain RSD under the Traffic Descriptor. For example,
the NWDAF can provide the performance statistic/prediction of combination of
RSC, e.g.: DNN, S-NSSAI, PDU session type, SSC mode and etc. And, also the
NWDAF can provide the performance statistic/prediction of single of RSC to
PCF. The PCF can update or modify the URSP rules for UE according to the
analytic from NWDAF.
For the PCF, it generates the URSP rules according to the data from UDR and
delivers the URSP rules to UE. But due to the URSP rules is a two-layer-
mapping design, that including the Traffic Descriptor and Route Selection
Descriptor, the PCF can benefit from the analytics of both performance and
experience.
**Solution #49:**
Same than for solution#16, this solution proposes the PCF may use existing
analytic \"Redundant Transmission Experience\" to determine whether to
provision an URSP rule for redundant transmission to the UE by setting URSP
fields RSN and PDU Session Pair ID.
In addition, this solution proposes an extension of existing \"Redundant
Transmission Experience\" analytic including:
\- New filter parameter PDU session ID, to indicate the target PDU Session on
which whether redundant transmission is needed or not.
\- New output parameters E2E UL/DL packet drop rate and packet delay.
Last, the solution proposes an extension of the procedure for Service Specific
Information provisioning, defined in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3], to
enable an AF to request the establishment of Redundant end to end user plane
path for an application. This new procedure proposes the PCF may use the
\"Redundant Transmission Experience\" analytic from NWDAF as input information
to assist on the decision to activate E2E Redundant transmission. Further, the
PCF notifies the AF to instruct the UE to trigger redundant transmission for
the application.
## 7.7 Key Issue #7: Enhancements on QoS Sustainability analytics
The solutions in KI#7 can be classified into two categories according to the
issues that they mainly address for achieving improvements on QoS
Sustainability analytics:
a) Enhance the QoS Sustainability analytics with a finer granularity area
(e.g. below Cell level): Sol #18 (without any specific solution provided),
#19, #50.
b) Enhance the QoS Sustainability analytics with additional input data: #18,
#19, #20, #50.
Solutions in group b can be then differentiated according to the type of
change, either introducing new information elements used for data collection
from OAM or adding new sources of information interacting with NWDAF:
\- Additional data from OAM: #18, #19, #20
\- Additional data from SMF: #19 (with PCF), #20 (optional), #50
\- Additional data from UPF: #20 (optional), #50
The evaluation of the solutions in the category \"Enhancements with a finer
granularity area\" is provided as follows:
\- Sol #18 acknowledges the need for \"below cell level location information\"
and modifies accordingly the output analytics with the \"Applicable Area with
finer granularity\" information but does not provide any details on how to
effectively obtain such information.
\- Sol #19 proposes to add interactions with LMF and AMF to get UE positions
located in the Cell or TA where requested area or path of Interest is
included.
\- Sol #50 is also relying on LMF and AMF as well as GMLC to retrieve the UE
location information, e.g. cell ID or finer granularity below cell. This
solution describes more in detail the overall procedure involving LCS Service
and GLMC.
The evaluation of the solutions in the category \"Enhancements with additional
input data\" is provided as follows:
\- Sol #18 introduces the usage of \"Latency and delay of 5G networks\" from
OAM, described more in details in clause 6.3 of TS 28.554 [9] referring to the
Integrity KPI. Among possible specific KPIs, the \"Downlink/Uplink latency in
gNB-DU\", \"Integrated Downlink/Uplink delay in RAN\" or \"E2E delay for
network slice\" could be obtained for example to enhance the data collection
for \"QoS Sustainability\" analytics.
\- Sol #19 proposes also to add similar information from OAM called \"Packet
Delay\", but referring this time more specifically to TS 28.552 [7], where for
instance different performance measurements are described such as the
\"Average delay UL/DL air-interface\", \"Round-trip GTP Data Packet Delay and
packet delay between NG-RAN and PSA UPF\". This solution also introduces new
input data from TS 28.552 [7] called \"RAN status, load and performance
information\" referring at least to the \"Radio resource utilization\"
described in clause 5.1.1.2 and \"Packet Loss and/or Drop\", certainly
referring to clause 5.1.3 \"Performance measurements valid for split gNB
deployment scenario\" describing the \"Packet Loss Rate\" and \"Packet Drop
Rate\" measurements. In addition to OAM source, Sol#19 introduces the usage of
\"QoS Notification Control of the QoS profiles or Alternative QoS Profiles\"
and their corresponding \"QoS profiles\" from SMF and PCF. Additional input
from UDM together with support of UE Context or Subscription information in
the filters provided by the consumer can be used to further improve the
accuracy of the analytics.
\- Sol #20 proposes firstly to add the same \"Packet Delay\" from OAM already
described in TS 28.552 [7] like for Sol#19. In addition, this solution
proposes to extend the measurements related to QoS Monitoring defined in TS
23.501 [2] and TS 28.552 [7], to include the IP-layer section capacity and IP-
layer available section capacity between UE, NG-RAN and UPF at GTP level. In
this way, new data input could be obtained such as \"UL/DL capacity GTP
between UPF and UE\" or \"UL/DL available capacity GTP between UPF and NG-
RAN\" corresponding respectively to the \"IP-layer section capacity\" and
\"IP-layer available section capacity\" definitions from ITU-T Y.1540. How OAM
can perform capacity measurements is to be determined by SA WG5. Optionally,
End-to-End measurements from UE to UPF like \"UL/DL packet delay GTP\" could
be also obtained through SMF or UPF.
\- Sol #50 does not rely on OAM but proposes to collect instead QoS
information from the UPF directly or through the SMF. Such information may
include the \"QoS flow Bit Rate\" representing the observed bit rate for UL
and DL and \"QoS flow Packet Delay\" representing the observed packet delay
for both directions. Additional input from UDM together with support of UE
Context or Subscription information in the filters provided by the consumer
can be used to further improve the accuracy of the analytics.

Based on the above analysis, we get the following observations:
Observation 1: Sever NWDAF and Client NWDAF registers to NRF with their FL
related information, e.g. Analytics ID, ML Filter Information, FL Capability.
Observation 2: FL Consumer or local configuration in Server NWDAF triggers FL
operation, and Server NWDAF selects Client NWDAFs from NRF.
Observation 3: Server NWDAF performs model aggregation and Client NWDAFs
perform local training. Server NWDAF exchanges FL training related information
with Client NWDAFs, e.g. interim model, initial model configuration.
Observation 4: For most solutions, model sharing between NWDAF instances is a
prerequisite for FL operation. And it is a general issue studied in KI #5.
Observation 5: There are solutions that propose to improve the FL model by
providing FL Consumer\'s feedback (e.g. model accuracy in real application) to
NWDAF Server. And this issue is related to KI #1.
Observation 6: There are solutions that propose the maintenance of FL process,
include the procedure which enables NWDAF Server to monitor the status update
of the NWDAF Clients and the dynamic procedure which enables NWDAF Clients to
join or quit the FL operation in execution phase.
Observation 7: There is a solution that proposes model performance monitoring
during federated learning. In order to guarantee model performance of the FL
operation, the Server NWDAF should exclude a Client NWDAF from the FL group if
the Accuracy-in-Training of the initial/common model calculated by the Client
NWDAF is much different from the Accuracy-in-Use calculated by the AnLF.
Observation 8: 7 out of 8 solutions focus on horizontal FL.
## 7.9 Key Issue #9: Enhancement of NWDAF with finer granularity of location
information
There are 11 solutions for KI#9 (Solutions #25, #26, #27, #54, #55, #56, #57,
#58, #59, #70, #71). Table 7.9-1 provides details of how the NWDAF can be
enhanced with finer granularity location information.

Based on the above aspects, the detailed analysis is elaborated as follows:
Solution #54, #55, #57 proposed that the NWDAF will determine from where to
obtain the location information based on the received information from NWDAF
consumer. If the received information indicates the NWDAF consumer needs finer
granularity UE location, NWDAF will query LCS system to obtain it; if the
received information indicates the NWDAF does not need finer granularity UE
location, NWDAF will proceed based on legacy procedures as defined in TS
23.288 [5] (e.g. AMF, OAM, AF) to obtain UE location with TA/cell level.
\- In Solution #54, the received information is new parameters (Location
granularity, Location accuracy granularity as defined in clause 4.3 of TS
22.071 [6]) that is added to Analytics Filter Information. These parameters
are valid for existing analytics IDs and new analytics ID that needs UE
location as input data. However, it is not mentioned how the NWDAF can obtain
UE location in TA, cell or finer granularity from LCS.
\- In Solution #55, the received information is identified from the new
analytics ID named \"finer granularity in 2 directions\". This is only valid
for the new analytics ID.
\- In Solution #57, the received information is identified from preferred
location granularity and preferred LCS QoS analytics in the request. The
following enhancement is needed to fulfil the granularity control purpose:
\- UE finer granularity location level should be added into \"preferred
granularity for location information\". By this addition, NWDAF can clearly
make the decision about from where to obtain the UE location.
\- New preferred LCS QoS parameter is needed. However, how the NWDAF consumer
is aware of this LCS QoS parameter is not discussed.
Solution #26, #27, #55, #70 proposed that the NWDAF can request UE location
information with TA/cell level from 5G NFs as currently specified in TS 23.288
[5].
\- Solution #26 proposed that the NWDAF provides UE locations in order.
\- Solution#27 proposes that the NWDAF consumer can request new analytics
about collision avoidance from NWDAF. With the \"Time To Collision\"
information and UE nearby vehicles (also 3GPP UEs) moving speed, moving
direction and etc. the NWDAF consumer can make the decision to avoid collision
to other UEs in proximity. However, it needs enhancement to current 5G NFs
regarding UE location collection, especially:
\- From OAM, per UE level speed and orientation information is needed.
NOTE 1: Confirmation from SA WG5 about whether and how the OAM can provide the
required UE speed and orientation information with MDT is needed.
\- Solution #55 proposed that the NWDAF provides the UE location in both
horizontal direction and vertical direction with different granularity
(TA/cell or finer granularity).
\- Solution #70 proposed that the NWDAF can provide a more flexible UE
location with time domain and space domain enhancements to enable the
distinguishment of UE trajectory analysis and UE presence in a given area.
Solutions #25, #54, #55, #56, #57, #58, #71 proposed that the NWDAF can
request UE location information with finer granularity from LCS system, where
solution #54, #55, #56, #57 require no enhancement from LCS system regarding
UE location information provision.
\- Solution #25 requires LCS system to provide UE(s) location information
(location estimate, velocity and etc) in a specific geographical area, which
is different from the translated TA/cell level geographical area.
\- Solution #58 enables NWDAF to provide UE location under a specific Motion
Event Criteria, i.e. when the UE moves a threshold linear distance that the UE
makes before providing UE location. This enhancement can be done in NWDAF, or
require the LCS system to provide UE location under such Motion Event
Criteria.
\- Solution #71 requires LCS system to provide UE(s) location information
(location estimate, UE velocity, location accuracy and etc), environment
indication (e.g. indoor/outdoor), in a specific geographical area.
NOTE 2: Whether all the data collected can be provided by LCS needs to be
confirmed in eLCS_Ph3.
Solution #59 proposes a new analytics service in NWDAF that can be used by the
LMF to improve UE location accuracy. The new analytics ID shall take the UE
location estimate as input and provide the predicted UE location accuracy as
output. In the training phase location information determined by two methods
is correlated to derive location accuracy for the less precise method.
NOTE 3: The eLCS_ph3 study agreed an conclusion to use this analytics as
specified in TR 23.700-71 [30].

# 8 Conclusions
## 8.1 Key Issue #1: How to improve correctness of NWDAF
For KI#1, it proposes the following principles:
**General aspects:**
\- Analytics consumers and AnLF may indicate a \"Use case context\" when
subscribing to or requesting analytics or ML model(s), respectively. The
values of this parameter will not be standardized. The actions of the NWDAF
based on the use case context are out of scope of 3GPP/implementation
specific.
\- NWDAF has the accuracy checking capability of analytics IDs and/or ML
models, where NWDAF can store for a period of time the necessary information
to determine the analytics IDs and/or ML model accuracy and provide the
accuracy information to consumers when requested or use it for its internal
processes.
\- An NWDAF containing AnLF with accuracy checking capability is able to
provide or notify the accuracy information of Analytics IDs to the consumers
of such service.
\- An NWDAF containing MTLF with accuracy checking capability is able to
provide or notify the ML model accuracy degradation to the consumers of such
service.
**Input of accuracy check:**
\- ML Model accuracy improvement can be achieved by comparing prediction using
the current trained ML model and its corresponding ground truth data i.e. the
corresponding true observed events.
\- The MTLF is to reselect a new ML model or retrain the existing ML model
that provided to the AnLF when it determines ML model degradation by either:
\- MTLF determining ML model degradation by collecting new test data
(including input data, ground truth data and the corresponding inference) and
testing the ML model accuracy. MTLF can compute accuracy by comparing the
predictions and the corresponding ground truth data.
NOTE 1: Input data is the necessary data which is collected by AnLF to perform
inference to generate prediction and the ground truth data is the actual
measured data which corresponds toa prediction.
\- MTLF can collect data for monitoring purposes from AnLF, ADRF or other NF.
When ADRF is used, the MTLF can retrieve the data by specifying in the request
the DataSetTag.
NOTE 2: The DataSetTag is defined from the conclusions of KI#4.
\- MTLF subscribes to AnLF, that is registered in MTLF with its accuracy
monitoring for a model provided by that MTLF, for getting notifications of the
accuracy degradation of the analytics generated by the model, where the AnLF
determines accuracy information based on any of the following:
\- Comparing predictions and its corresponding ground truth data.
NOTE 3: The ground truth data and the corresponding prediction is to be
defined per Analytics ID.
\- Comparing changes in internal configuration for the analytics ID generation
(e.g. data collection parameters).
\- Previous existent records of analytics accuracy information.
\- The analytics consumer performs action that may consequently affect the
ground truth data and may provide the accuracy feedback information that
indicates whether the analytics consumer NF performs actions to AnLF.
\- In the case of AnLF with accuracy checking capability, the accuracy
feedback information is taken into account by AnLF to improve Accuracy
Calculating.
\- In the case of MTLF with accuracy checking capability, AnLF further forward
the accuracy feedback information to MTLF, which is taken into account by MTLF
to improve Accuracy Calculating.
\- AnLF/MTLF can evaluate the quality of the data from the 3rd party data
sources for input data selection.
**Triggers of performance check:**
\- MTLF with accuracy checking capability of ML models can trigger the
analytics accuracy checking based on its internal logic or configuration which
may require to subscribe events, e.g. a change in the policy and/or a change
in the subscription data for Target of ML Model Reporting, etc.
\- When requesting an ML model via the MLModelProvision service, the AnLF can
specify in the request the additional parameters indicating the need for ML
model accuracy check.
\- When MTLF provides an ML model to an AnLF, the MTLF requests/subscribes
AnLF to determine accuracy of the analytics generated from that model by
comparing predictions and its corresponding ground truth data, if the AnLF
indicates it can provide accuracy feedback.
\- An analytics consumer may request or subscribe to accuracy information
about Analytics ID(s) from the AnLF with the performance checking
capabilities. Accuracy information can be included in an accuracy report,
scoped in the same way as Analytics requests are scoped, i.e. per Analytics
ID, for a specific area, slice, (group of) UEs, in a given time window, etc.
Such request or subscription triggers the monitoring and check of Analytics
ID(s) and generation of analytics accuracy information.
**Actions after accuracy check:**
\- When accuracy information includes an indication that the accuracy of the
analytics does not meet the consumer\'s requirements, the analytics consumer
may stop using analytics for a period of time or obtain new analytics.
In addition, accuracy information may also include updated analytics for the
provided analytics ID, if the updated analytics is able to be generated within
the correction time period.
\- When accuracy information includes indications for the NF to stop or pause
the consumption of the analytics, the NF may unsubscribe to the analytics ID,
or provide an indication to AnLF that it is pausing an existing subscription
of the analytics ID. Once AnLF determines the accuracy of the analytics is
improved to meet the consumer\'s requirements for an analytics ID, the AnLF
may notify the NF consumer with an indication for resuming consumption of
analytics ID.
\- NF consumers of Analytics ID(s) upon receiving an accuracy information from
an AnLF may request a pause or resume of notification from existing
subscriptions.
\- NWDAF can rate untrusted AF data sources based on data source performance
monitoring. Monitoring can be performed by NWDAF containing MTLF considering
the data distribution or data drift, (i.e. between predictions and ground
truth data) or alternatively by the NWDAF containing AnLF considering either
the data drift or the evaluation feedback provided by service consumer.
**Other aspects:**
\- In order to improve correctness of NWDAF Service Experience analytics, the
AF may provide \"Service Experience Contribution Weights\" to the NWDAF as
described in Solution #2.
\- Providing Multiple ML models to AnLF may help improve Analytics accuracy.
In this case, each ML model shall indicate the providing MTLF and is assigned
a unique ML Model identifier (i.e. unique within a PLMN) by the providing
MTLF.
NOTE 4: The structure and format of the ML Model identifier and its uniqueness
are up to stage 3.
\- When requesting an ML model via the MLModelProvision service, the AnLF can
specify in the request the information about input data type to assist MTLF in
the ML model selection. Similarly, to assist the AnLF in selecting the
appropriate ML model for inference, the ML model provisioning response
includes information about the input data type, sources and parameters such as
data granularity and sampling ratio, that have been actually used for the
training of the ML model.
\- In order to enable AnLF to know if a model can represent the group of UEs
which are Target of ML Model Reporting, Representative Ratio may be provided
from MTLF to AnLF as part of the model information. AnLF may provide a
threshold of Representative ratio as part of the input parameters in the Model
Provisioning request.
## 8.2 Key Issue #2: NWDAF-assisted application detection
It is concluded to focus on the use case of PFD updates for known applications
in Solution#9, which is selected as baseline for the normative work.
The known application means an application for which the application ID is
already known by the 5GC and can be referenced within PCC rules and for which
PFD information (may not be the latest) is already available.
It is concluded, that the NEF(PFDF) as a consumer can request NWDAF to get a
new Analytics ID for application detection, following the detail described in
solution#9.
NOTE 1: Extensive reporting related to all traffic flows at the UPF should be
avoided due to the high UPF load. An NWDAF preferably subscribes only for
reporting for some UEs to limit the load..
NOTE 2: Coordination with the FS_UPEAS conclusions is required for procedures
for UPF event exposure and the related subscription.
NOTE 3: Coordination with SA WG3 for possible user consent checking is needed.
## 8.3 Key Issue #3: Data and analytics exchange in roaming case
For KI#3, the following architectural principles are agreed as conclusion:
\- An NWDAF is used as entry point to exchange analytics in roaming scenario
between HPLMN and VPLMN. It authorizes the request according to operator
policies and user consent and it filters the information exposed in reply to
the request.
NOTE 1: How to discover the NWDAF for the roaming case is determined in
normative phase.
\- The NWDAF offers new services to be accessed by the peer PLMN. This allows
the NRF to be configured in such a manner that only access to those services
is authorized from outside the PLMN. The new services will be defined with as
much communality as possible to existing services to ease the implementation.
\- Exposure of input data for analytics is allowed from VPLMN to HPLMN and
vice versa. It may be restricted based on operator policy and user consent.
\- The HPLMN may provide analytics to the VPLMN. The VPLMN may provide
analytics to the HPLMN.
NOTE 2: Analytics that rely on input data from the HPLMN are preferbly not
provided from VPLMN to HPLMN but generated in the HPLMN. Analytics that rely
on input data from the VPLMN are preferbly not provided from HPLMN to VPLMN
but generated in the VPLMN.
NOTE 3: Data and analytics exchange between HPLMN and VPLMN may be furter
updated based on feedback from GSMA during the normative work.
NOTE 4: The user consent check procedure and security aspects will align with
SA WG3\'s conclusion during normative work.
The following use cases are supported:
\- VPLMN may consume analytics generated by HPLMN or request input data and
generate analytics on its own:
NOTE 5: It will be determined during the normative work whether an analytics
profile is required in addition to analytics.
\- In home routed roaming scenarios, HPLMN analytics (i.e. slice load level
analytics, NF load analytics, etc.) can be leveraged by the AMF in the VPLMN
for Network Slice selection and SMF selection for PDU Session management.
\- UE-related analytics provided by the HPLMN (e.g.. service experience
analytics, etc.) can include statistics or predictions for outbound roaming
UEs.
\- HPLMN may consume analytics generated by the VPLMN or request input data
and generate analytics on its own.
\- In home routed roaming scenarios, analytics information with statistics or
predictions for outbound roaming UEs can be leveraged by the H-PCF for QoS
control of the PDU Session.
\- Analytics (i.e. service experience analytics, slice load level analytics,
etc.) can be leveraged by the H-PCF for decision of NSSP in URSP rules
provisioned to the UE roaming in the VPLMN.
## 8.4 Key Issue #4: How to Enhance Data collection and Storage
1\. For Managing Impact of storing data in NFp during muting, Solutions #41
and #45 are adopted for normative work.
2\. For ADRF / NWDAF Data Storage Management, a consumer may request data
deletion alert and provide life time of the data to the ADRF. NWDAF or ADRF
may be configured with operator policies for data storage as defined in
Solution#46.
3\. Data records can be stored at ADRF with an associated DataSetTag. The
DataSetTag can be used to retrieve the whole set of data records associated to
such tag. The DataSetTag may be included in the service requests to AnLF and
MTLF to indicate the data set to be used by the AnLF, respectively by MTLF.
4\. Data can be stored at and retrieved from ADRF using techniques of data
compression and/or data synthesis. The DSC indicator is used to represent the
technique of data compression and/or data synthesis. The value of DSC is up to
vendor agreement and up to implementation. How to support data transportation
using the techniques of data compression and/or data synthesis is out of the
scope of 3GPP.
NOTE 1: How DSC is conveyed in the SBI message is up to Stage-3 design.
5\. To optimize the reporting of network data, data can be reported according
to a non-fixed sampling ratio. Data consumer can indicate the non-fixed sample
ratio in the data subscription request. Data consumer can update the data
sampling ratio dynamically by updating the data subscription. Data provider
can use different sampling ratio according to local configuration and provide
the sampling ratio info in the data notifications to the data consumer.
6\. Normative change (only impacting stage 2) is recommended to allow NWDAF to
register in the UDM for the served UE, also for Analytics IDs that are not UE-
related, as defined in Solution #65.
7\. For storing ML models in ADRF, MTLF can store ML model in ADRF based on
MTLF policy.
8\. MTLF sends the ML model or ML model address to ADRF by using ADRF\'s ML
model storage service.
NOTE 2: How MTLF sends the ML model by using 3GPP defined service-based
interface is determined in normative phase.
9\. NF consumer(s) (MTLF or AnLF) retrieves the ML model or URL (where the
model is stored) from ADRF by using ADRF ML model retrieval service. ADRF
shall not duplicate the functionality as MLModelProvision Service.
NOTE 3: Whether new service operation or re-use existing service operation to
retrieve ML model from the ADRF will be decided during normative phase.
NOTE 4: Whether the ADRF further downloads the ML model based on the ML model
address and locally stores the ML model is left for implementation.
NOTE 5: When storing ML models and retrieving ML models at the ADRF, whether
and which additional security-related parameters need to be sent by MTLF to
ADRF are to be determined with SA WG3.
NOTE 6: The NF consumer(s) may be authorized by the ML model provider (i.e.
provider of MTLF) when retrieving the ML model from ADRF. The details of the
authorization procedure will be discussed in SA3 WG.
10\. When a DCCF and optionally MFAF is no longer able to serve a data
consumer due to data source change, procedures for DCCF and optionally MFAF
re-location (respectively re-selection) are supported according to solutions
12 and 66 (respectively 44). The selection of the appropriate procedure is
determined by the DCCF based on an optional \"No relocation\" indicator
provided by the DCCF service consumer: when the indicator is absent or set to
\"False\", the DCCF executes the relocation procedure, when set to \"True\",
the DCCF does not execute the relocation.
11\. Transfer of Analytics subscription can be aligned to follow principle #9,
i.e. source NWDAF will determine whether to initiate the Analytics
subscription transfer based on a \"No Relocation\" indicator provided by the
Analytics service consumer.
## 8.5 Key Issue #5: Enhance trained ML model sharing
It is recommended to use the following principles and procedures as the basis
for the normative work.
\- The following are the trained ML model sharing parameters to enable ML
model sharing between different vendors - Interoperability indicator as
specified in Sol#15 and optional Interoperability token as specified in
Sol#47.
\- The Interoperability indicator indicates a list of NWDAF providers
(vendors) that are allowed to retrieve ML models from the NWDAF containing
MTLF.
\- The Interoperability indicator indicates that the NWDAF containing MTLF
supports the interoperable ML models requested by the NWDAFs from the vendors
in the list.
NOTE: The vendor list indicated by the Interoperability indicator is
determined by the NWDAF vendor and is configured in the NWDAF.
\- The Interoperability token implicitly maps to an interoperable model
information, e.g. file format, platform, etc. The encoding, format and value
of the Interoperability token is up to vendors\' implementation, thus no
normative work is needed except defining this IE.
\- During registration of NWDAF containing MTLF with NRF, Interoperability
indicator and optional Interoperability token to trained ML model sharing are
provided as part of NF profile to the NRF.
\- During NWDAF containing MTLF discovery procedure, the consumer i.e. NWDAF
may include Interoperability indicator and optional Interoperability token per
Analytics ID(s) in the discovery request.
NOTE: When ML model provider MTLF and ML model consumer NWDAF belong to
different vendors, how the ML model privacy is supported is in scope of SA
WG3.
## 8.6 Key Issue #6: NWDAF-assisted URSPs
It is concluded the PCF may adjust the fields (i.e. RSCs) and even the RSD
preference in URSP rules based on the analytics result from NWDAF according to
the table below (based mainly on proposal from Solution#16 and Solution#48):
Table 8.6-1: Mapping of fields in URSP and analytics
URSP field Analytic ID
* * *
Route Selection Descriptor Components  
S-NSSAI \"Service Experience\", \"Slice Load level information\", \"Dispersion
Analytics\", \"Session Management Congestion Control Experience\" DNN
\"Service Experience\", \"UE Communication\", \"Session Management Congestion
Control Experience\", \"DN Performance\" Non-Seamless Offload Indication \"UE
Communication\", \"WLAN performance\", \"Load level information\", \"Network

Preference Enhanced \"Service Experience\", \"WLAN Performance\" PDU Session
Pair ID \"Redundant Transmission Experience\" RSN \"Redundant Transmission
Experience\" Route Selection Validation Criteria  
Time Window Based on the validity period and spatial validity provided in the
Analytics ID used for RSD generation Location Criteria Based on the validity
period and spatial validity provided in the Analytics ID used for RSD
generation
It is assumed that for every application the PCF first determines (e.g. per
operator configured policies):
\- Whether some fields of the corresponding URSP rule may be adjusted by using
analytics.
\- The list of potential candidate values for every field in the URSP rule to
be adjusted with analytics.
Then the PCF uses analytics results from NWDAF to select the proper value from
the list of candidates, according to the table 1.
NOTE: Care needs to be taken with regards to signalling and processing load
caused when requesting analytics targeting \"Any UE\". A PCF preferably limits
the analytics requests to a smaller UE set to reduce the load.
It is proposed the extension of existing \"Service Experience\" analytic to
include new input and new output information for SSC mode, PDU session Type
and Access type based on proposal from Solution#16 and Solution#48. PDU
Session type and SSC mode (and combinations of those and other RSCs) needs to
be added to the request/subscription for Analytics of Service Experience, the
full list of RSCs and what are the relevant combination will be defined in
normative phase.
It is proposed that as defined in the subscription or request for Analytics,
the PCF can request or subscribe to the analytics from NWDAF of combination of
several URSP fields (i.e. RSCs, for example, the analytics of combination of
PDU session type and SSC mode) or all URSP fields (i.e. the whole RSD, for
example, that the analytics of the combination of all the RSCs in one RSD)
listed in Table 1. Based on the analytics for combination of several RCSs or
the whole RSD, the PCF can adjust the RSD precedence.
Whether a new procedure for an AF to request the establishment of a Redundant
end to end user plane path for an application is considered out of the scope
of this study.
It is proposed that the PCF can update the URSP to the UE to establish the
redundant PDU Session, taking Primary RAN Path Redundant Transmission
Experience and Secondary (Redundant) RAN Path Redundant Transmission
Experience into account to decide if the redundant transmission mechanism is
needed or not for the corresponding application, as described in Sol#49.
## 8.7 Key Issue #7: Enhancements on QoS Sustainability analytics
In addition to the RAN UE Throughput and the QoS flow Retainability,
additional input data should be standardized for the QoS Sustainability
analytics as proposed in Solution #18 and Solution #20, such as average UL or
DL packet delay, average GTP metric (UL/DL packet delay, UL/DL capacity or
UL/DL available capacity), as well as support for additional filter
information related to the UE Context or Subscription in the request or
subscription from the service consumer.
For NWDAF to derive QoS sustainability analytics in a finer granularity area
smaller than cell, Alt#2 of Sol#19 and Sol#50 are selected as the baseline for
the normative work. The selected proposals are as follows:
\- Based on the requested finer granularity area from AF, NWDAF derives the UE
ID list within the finer granularity area based on the UE Location information
from GMLC LMF/AMF, e.g. NWDAF identifies the UEs inside of the finer
granularity area by comparing the UEs\' geographical locations retrieved from
GMLC/LMF with the finer granularity area provided from AF.
NOTE: The method of how to provide UE ID list within a finer geographical area
is studied/concluded in KI#9, which needs coordination work with FS_eLCS_Ph3.
\- NWDAF collects the input data for the UE ID list within the finer
granularity area such as QNC/AQP and QoS profile from SMF/PCF, or MDT data
from OAM, or QoS flow information from UPF. In addition, the input data may
also include QoS flow Bit Rate/QoS flow Packet Delay from UPF and additional
input from UDM in Sol#50.
\- NWDAF derives QoS sustainability statistics or predictions for the finer
granularity area by averaging these input data for the UE list.
\- In order to limit impact on signalling, input data about QNC/AQP and QoS
profile from SMF/PCF shall be collected only in case of GFBR can no longer be
guaranteed.
NOTE: The additional input data required for finer granularity is only
collected after the AF has requested/subscribed to the analytics. The UEs in
the area of interest/UE path to be analysed by the NWDAF may not be the ones
relevant to the analytics request/subscription. Therefore there is no
guarantee that relevant input data for the generation of the analytics can be
collected immediately after AF subscription. AF may need to request/subscribe
to the analytics certain time (e.g. days, weeks, or months) before analytics
are needed. Alternatively, NWDAF can use other mechanisms (e.g. non-standard)
to collect input data prior to application request/subscription.
## 8.8 Key Issue #8: Supporting Federated Learning in 5GC
In conclusion, KI #8 proposes the following principles:
Principle 1: NWDAF containing MTLF as FL server or FL clients register to NRF
with their FL related information, including Analytics ID(s), Address
information, FL capability Type (i.e. FL server or FL clients), and Service
Area, etc.
NOTE 1: The meaning and usage of FL capability type, including FL server and
FL client capability, are left to the normative phase to be determined.
Principle 2: NWDAF containing MTLF determines ML model requires FL based on
Analytic ID, Service Area/DNAI or data not available directly from data
producer NF (e.g. due to privacy reasons).
Principle 3: If NWDAF containing MTLF as FL sever determines ML model requires
FL, the FL Server discovers and selects other NWDAF(s) containing MTLF as FL
Client(s) from NRF. The following criteria are used for discovering a FL
Client:
\- Analytic ID of the ML model required.
\- FL client capability.
\- Service Area.
\- Data available by the FL Client.
\- Time Period of Interest.
Principle 4: If NWDAF containing MTLF without FL server capability determines
ML model requires FL, the MTLF discovers and selects FL sever from NRF. The
following criteria are used for discovering a FL server:
\- Analytic ID of the ML model required.
\- Model filter information as defined in TS 23.288 [5].
\- FL sever capability.
\- If FL server is currently doing a FL for the Analytics ID.
\- Time Period of Interest.
\- Service Area.
Principle 5: NWDAF containing MTLF as FL server may determine the final list
of NWDAF containing MTLF as FL clients via initial FL request to FL clients to
determine the availability and compatibility of the FL clients. During the FL
procedure, the NWDAF containing MTLF as FL server may trigger reselection,
addition or removal of FL clients and may issue a new FL client discovery via
NRF, based on local policy or status of FL clients, e.g. load, availability,
capability, latency, accuracy, etc. FL clients can join or quit FL operation
dynamically in the execution phase.
NOTE 2: NWDAF containing MTLF as FL Server can monitor the accuracy level of
the trained model and exclude a Client NWDAF from the FL group if the Accuracy
feedback of the initial/common model calculated by the Client NWDAF is much
different from the Accuracy calculated from the AnLF, FL clients calculate the
accuracy of the initial/common model using its local dataset. How FL server
receives the accuracy feedback from AnLF is following KI#1. How FL server
receives the accuracy feedback from FL client is following Principle#6. FL
server can also compare the accuracy from the FL clients with the accuracy
calculated by itself, if the FL server has enough data to calculate the
accuracy.
Principle 6: NWDAF containing MTLF as FL Server exchanges FL training related
information with NWDAF containing MTLF as FL Client. The FL training related
information may contain the guideline information for the iterative FL
training procedures between FL Server and FL Clients, the guideline
information includes maximum response time for FL client to provide interim
local ML model information. The FL Server provides to the FL client the
initial ML model information to train the local ML Model, the FL client
provides interim local ML model information back to FL Server during FL
procedure, and the FL Server provides to the FL client the updated ML model
information. Regarding the details information that FL server provides to the
FL client, the conclusion should be aligned with KI #5, when it comes to the
model sharing and interoperability between FL server and FL clients.
NOTE 3: For ML model exchange between NWDAF containing MTLF as FL Server and
NWDAF containing MTLF as FL Client, whether to define new services or to
extend the existing model provisioning service will be determined in the
normative phase.
NOTE 4: The FL training related information exchanged between the FL Server
and the FL client is aligned with the conclusion of KI#5.
Principle 7: The services to enable the FL based ML model training should be
generic enough for all ML model training mechanisms which require service
provider trains the ML model provided by the service consumer.
NOTE 5: In this release of the specification, the service provider and
consumer are limited to NWDAF containing MTLF.
## 8.9 Key Issue #9: Enhancement of NWDAF with finer granularity of location
information
For KI#9, the following conclusions are agreed:
The following use cases will be addressed in normative work:
\- Existing analytics IDs that request UE location (i.e. Observed Service
Experience, UE mobility, and Dispersion Analytics) are enhanced:
\- to provide finer granularity than cell/TA level based on related input data
obtained from the LCS framework of the 5GS. Enhancements shall enable
information on horizontal and vertical accuracy information as part of the
output analytics;
\- to provide information about the order UE traversed the provided locations;
and
\- to support the PSAP resolution use case.
\- NWDAF supports the following new Analytics IDs:
\- Analytics ID that supports collecting UE location when the UE is exactly in
the requested area instead of the translated TA/cell list.
\- Analytics ID \'Relative Proximity\' provides support for finer granularity
of location information at NWDAF via relative proximity information of nearby
UEs. The output analytics contain relative proximity and Time to Collision
information.
\- Analytic ID that supports the traffic flow statistics use case.
\- Analytic ID that supports location accuracy estimate use case.
NOTE 1: That new Analytics IDs to support these use cases are required
(instead of enhancing Analytics IDs) will be confirmed during normative work.
The NWDAF will determine from where to obtain the UE location considering
different UE location granularity based on analytics ID, and/or the
information (e.g. preferred location granularity) from Analytics Reporting
Information.
\- If the required UE location granularity is TA or cell level, the NWDAF may
query with 5G NFs as currently specified in TS 23.288 [5] to obtain the UE
location and related information, e.g. direction.
\- If the required UE location granularity is finer e.g. coordinates, the
NWDAF will query the LCS system to obtain the UE location and related
information.
\- The Analytics Reporting Information provided by NWDAF consumers is to be
enhanced. The consumer can request:
\- the AOI in form of shape and the coordinates of latitude and longitude;
\- the accuracy requirements in horizontal direction and vertical direction of
UE location;
\- Location granularity: finer than cell/TA level, horizontal/vertical
direction, indoor/outdoor;
\- LCS Accuracy, if known by the NWDAF consumer;
\- temporal granularity size and spatial granularity size;
\- Motion Events for UE location reporting (e.g. UE reporting location when UE
has moved a requested linear threshold distance).
NOTE 2: Where to include the preferred granularity of location information and
the NWDAF consumer-provided enhanced information, e.g. in \'Analytics Filter
Information\' or in \'Analytics Reporting Information\', is to be determined
in the normative phase.
If the NWDAF determines to query 5G NFs as currently specified in TS 23.288
[5]:
\- The NWDAF may collect data from AF and 5GC NF other than LCS, as in
previous Releases, to assist with the derivation of output analytics with fine
granularity.
\- The NWDAF may collect data from OAM and DCAF, as in previous Releases, to
derive analytics with fine granularity. New input data consists of per UE
speed and orientation from OAM and UEs fulfilling a proximity criterion from
DCAF, respectively.
NOTE 3: In the normative phase a confirmation from SA WG5 that OAM can provide
UE speed and orientation information is required.
If the NWDAF determines to query the LCS system:
\- From LCS, NWDAF retrieves location data from the GMLC using the Ngmlc
services.
NOTE 4: This is based on FS_eLCS_Ph3 KI#4 conclusion as specified in TR
23.700-71 [30].
\- From LCS, NWDAF can collect finer granularity location data from LCS
including timestamp, age of location, UE location with requested granularity,
velocity (speed and orientation), LCS QoS (e.g. LCS accuracy), the indication
of motion event occurrence, indoor/outdoor indication;
NOTE 5: In normative phase, a confirmation that all those data can be provided
by LCS based on FS_eLCS_Ph3 conclusions is required.
To benefit LCS system, the NWDAF provides a new analytic ID with location
accuracy estimates as required by the conclusions of the eLCS-Ph3 study.
NOTE 6: The FS_eLCS_ph3 in TR 23.700-71 [30] contains a conclusion for Key
Issue 4 to use this analytics.
## 8.10 Key Issue #10: Interactions with MDAS/MDAF
\- NWDAF uses MDAS/MDAF analysis as extra input for generating analytics, e.g.
Observed Service experience analytics and Redundant Transmission Experience
analytics, improving accuracy or re-training ML model, Solutions #60 and #72
are adopted as baseline for normative work.
\- NWDAF, as an MDA MnS Consumer, reuse the MDA functional overview and
service framework as defined in TS 28.104 [15]. NWDAF discover MDAS/MDAF by
MnS Discovery service producer, and subscribes to MDAS/MDAF by MDA Request
service operation, Solutions#73 and Solutions #74 are adopted as baseline for
normative work.
\- NWDAF (MTLF) may leverage analytics for fault management
predictions/statistics to improve data collection and accuracy of analytics as
defined in Solution 72. This will be described in normative work as an example
text.
