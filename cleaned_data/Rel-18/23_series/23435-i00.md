# Introduction
Network slice capability enablement (NSCE) is a service that enables the
network slice related capabilities towards 3^rd^ party on the basis of R17
SEAL. The NSCE service provides additional functionality and exposes slice
capabilities based on 5GS management system services (e.g MnS services) and
5GS network services (e.g. NEF APIs, NWDAF APIs, NSACF APIs). This technical
specification provides architecture and procedures for enabling NSCE service
over 3GPP networks.

VAL Vertical Application Layer
# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Registration
This functionality enables the VAL server to become a recognized user of
CAPIF. VAL server registration procedures are specified in clause 9.2.
## 4.2 Slice API configuration and translation
This functionality is provided to the vertical application specific layer and
configures the exposure of APIs in a slice-tailored manner. It is assumed that
the VAL server is not initially aware of the all the API exposure capabilities
and information which will be needed for the given slice based on the SLA, and
NSCE plays a vital role in configuring and translating the slice API based on
the per slice requirements to service APIs. Slice API configuration and
translation procedures are specified in clause 9.3.
## 4.3 Application layer network slice lifecycle management
Application layer network slice lifecycle management is provided to the VAL to
better meet consumer\'s requirement without having to interact with 5GS
frequently, based on network slice status collected from 5GS and QoE collected
from application layer. Application layer network slice lifecycle management
procedures are specified in clause 9.4.
## 4.4 Network slice optimization based on VAL server policy
Network slice optimization based on VAL server policy optimizes the network
slice for the vertical applications by triggering the network slice
modification exposed by EGMF defined in SA5. Network slice optimization based
on VAL server policy procedures are specified in clause 9.5.
## 4.5 Discovery of management service exposure
This network slice capability enablement feature supports the initial
discovery of MnS for a given slice based on VAL server request, and the
discovery of new/modified MnS with the required exposure (for example the
permissions of the VAL server over the target MnS, e.g. read, write
operations). This feature consists of two procedures, which are specified in
clause 9.6:
\- Discovery of management service capabilities and related permissions (e.g.
permitted CRUD operations) based on VAL server request;
\- Discovery and exposure of new or modified management service capabilities
based on changes at OAM.
## 4.6 Network slice performance and analytics monitoring
This functionality is provided to the VAL to get end to end network slice
related performance and analytic monitoring. The NSCE server identifies which
data are needed, collects the data from different data sources (e.g., the OAM
system, the 5GC Network, etc.), performs data processing and abstraction,
exposes the processed data to VAL servers. **Network slice performance and
analytics monitoring** procedures are specified in clause 9.7.
## 4.7 Information collection from NSCE server(s)
The network slice status collected by the NSCE server could be exposed to
other NSCE server(s) if some agreement has been made. **Information collection
from NSCE server(s)** procedures are specified in clause 9.8.
## **4.8 Predictive slice modification in edge based NSCE deployments**
This feature addresses scenarios where the NSCE server is deployed at the edge
and the migration to different Data Network will require that the ongoing
slice is supported at the target area to ensure meeting the application
session requirements. The slice parameters monitoring at the target area (e.g.
for per NSI/NSSI resource situation) need to be known at the server NSCE
server to allow for pro-active slice (or slice subnet) modification trigger to
avoid degradation of the application service performance. **Predictive slice
modification** procedures are specified in clause 9.9.
## 4.9 Multiple slices coordinated resource optimization
This functionality is provided to the VAL to monitor the slice usage status of
multiple slices (PNI-NPN slice(s) and its private slice in the PLMN) of the
PNI-NPN owner in a combined manner. It makes resource adjustment between
different slices in one PLMN to realize optimized and efficient resource usage
among multiple slices sharing common network resources. Coordinated PLMN and
PNI-NPN slice resource optimization procedures are specified in clause 9.10.
## 4.10 Network slice adaptation for VAL application
This functionality is provided to the VAL to adapt the network slice for the
VAL application. Such adaptation assumes that the UE is subscribed to more
than one slice and is done via providing a guidance to update the URSP rules
at the 5GS. The network slice adaptation request can be triggered by VAL
server or VAL UE. Network slice adaptation for VAL application procedures are
specified in clause 9.11.
## 4.11 Slice related communication service lifecycle management
This functionality is provided to the VAL server to make slice related
communication service lifecycle management. The NSCE server can acquire the
application services related requirements for a specific VAL service from the
vertical industry perspective, evaluate these requirements and then determines
the network slice by pre-configured industry mapping relations or by KQI-KPI
translation algorithms. After the network slice requirements are determined,
the NSCE server allocates proper network slice resources to support the
application services. **Slice related communication service lifecycle
management exposure** procedures are specified in clause 9.12.
## 4.12 Predictive slice modification in Inter-PLMN based slice service
continuity
This functionality is provided to the VAL to make predictive slice
modification where NSCE service provider provides its services when connected
to two PLMNs and has SLA with them. The NSCE server checks with 5GS (OAM, 5GC)
whether the serving slice is available and can offer the same performance at
the target PLMN and make slice modification decision if needed. Predictive
slice modification in Inter-PLMN based slice service continuity procedures are
specified in clause 9.13.
## 4.13 **Network slice diagnostics**
Network slice diagnostics provides possibility for the vertical/ASP using VAL
server to receive information about the specific event(s) related to service
experience. The vertical/ASP using the VAL server has estimated bad QoE for a
mobile user or service -- either reported from a mobile user or service or
detected by application, can initiate a check with NSCE. The NSCE server can
provide **Network slice diagnostics** details related to the identified event
as specified in clause 9.14.
## 4.14 **Network slice fault management** capability exposure
**Network slice fault management** capability exposure gathers data from
different sources (e.g., OAM, VAL server, NSCE client) and provides fault data
that characterize the quality of the network connections and services to
ensure a quick reaction to identify network connectivity, performance related
problems. The **Network slice fault management** capability exposure is
specified in clause 9.15.
## 4.15 Slice requirements verification and alignment capability exposure
Slice requirements verification and alignment capability exposure provides the
capability of comparing the QoS achievement status together with the OAM QoS
data versus real customer QoS data (e.g., Mean Opinion Score) collected from
VAL client by checking whether the existing QoS/Slice related data is able to
satisfy the VAL clients. Periodically alignment notifications are sent to VAL
server for the slice requirements alignment. The Slice requirements
verification and alignment capability exposure is specified in clause 9.16.
## 4.16 Network Slice Information delivery
The Network Slice information delivery sends the Network Slice information to
VAL server and NSCE client. With that information, the VAL server is able to
manage the network slice for their service such as preparation, creation,
activation and termination (tear-down) of network slice. The Network Slice
Information delivery is specified in clause 9.17.
## 4.17 Network Slice Allocation
The NSCE server performs the Network Slice allocation operation on behalf of
the VAL server if non-trusted 3^rd^ party application (i.e., VAL server)
cannot access to the 5GS management system directly. The specific service is
specified in clause 9.18.
# 5 Business models and relationships for NSCE
NSCE layer provides value added services to VAL customers, based on consuming
5GS services related to slicing (from OAM, 5GC) and based on interacting with
the VAL UE side. The variety of services and the deployment aspects depend on
the different assumptions for the slice owner / provider, the slice customer
and the SEAL service provider. With respect to NSCE, the NSCE server belongs
to the SEAL provider (as stated in TS 23.434 [2] clause 5) who can be either
the MNO itself, or the vertical customer (e.g. factory owner, automaker X) or
the edge/cloud provider (e.g. hyperscaler) who provides such platform services
related to slice capability exposure to the vertical customer on top of the
MNO. Thus, NSCE can play different roles based on the business models. For
example, NSCE server can be:
\- deployed by NOP / MNO.
\- deployed by an Edge / Cloud Provider. In this case, it is assumed that the
NSCE server is acting as an authorized AF/AS.
\- deployed by a vertical industry, which can be the end slice customer.
From business perspective, the following business model applies. In Figure
5-1, the different interactions among all the involved entities are provided.
More specifically, in this model the end user is the consumer of the
applications provided by the vertical/ASP and can have app-level service
agreement with vertical/ASP(s).
The end user/UE also has a PLMN subscription arrangement with the MNO. The UE
used by the end user is allowed to be registered on the MNO\'s network. MNO
(via OAM) can have a slice SLA with the vertical / ASP, which is optional when
vertical customer is the NSC. In addition, due to the involvement of a NSCE
service provider, additional agreements can be possible between the NSCE
server and VAL/ASP layer and the NOP/MNO(s):
\- the enablement service agreement between VAL/ASP layer and the NSCE service
provider include the agreement on the value-added services, which in case on
NSaaS these are services related to the consumed slice from NOP. So, the end
customer (VAL) subscribes to NSCE server for receiving additional services for
optimizing the slice utilization. In case that the NSCE server is a NSP
towards VAL customer, then such agreement can relate to slice SLA (for the
slice provided by the NSCE server). When the NSCE server is part of the
vertical, the service agreement between VAL/ASP layer and the NSCE service
provider is internal to a single organization.
\- the service agreement between MNO and NSCE service provider is for
consuming 5GS services (and being also authorized to provide additional
services on top). Such agreement could be also a slice SLA for the scenarios
when NSCE server is the NSC of the MNO (in NSaaS model).

Figure 5-1: Business relationships
In case of shared RAN between operators, one NSCE service provider (slice
service provider) can use NSCE to offer slice services using resources of
these operators to end customer (VAL) using the shared RAN via one or both
operators.
In case of national roaming between operators, one NSCE service provider
(slice service provider) can use NSCE to offer slice services using resources
of these operators to end customer (VAL).

# 7 Application architecture for NSCE
## **7.1 General**
The architecture for the network slice capability enablement is based on the
generic functional model specified in clause 6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [2]. It is
organized into functional entities to describe a functional architecture which
addresses the support for network slice capability enablement aspects for
vertical applications. Since the slicing is a feature which considers the Uu
interfaces, only the on-network functional model is specified in this clause.
## **7.2 Architecture description**
Figure 7.2-1 depicts the network slice capability enablement architecture in
the non-roaming case, using the reference point representation showing how
various entities interact with each other.
{width="6.09375in" height="2.4555555555555557in"}
Figure 7.2-1: Architecture for network slice capability enablement --
reference points representation
The network slice capability enablement client communicates with the network
slice capability enablement server over the NSCE-UU reference point. The
network slice capability enablement client provides the support for network
slice capability enablement functions to the VAL client(s) over NSCE-C
reference point. The VAL server(s) communicates with the network slice
capability enablement server over the NSCE-S reference point. It is assumed
that the network slice capability enablement server is deployed at the 5G
system domain. The network slice capability enablement server, acting as AF,
may communicate with the 5G Core Network functions via NEF (N33) reference
point (for interactions with PCF, NSACF, etc.). The network slice capability
enablement server may interact with OAM system over NSCE-OAM reference point,
as consumer in both NSaaS and NoP model defined in the clause 4.1.6 and clause
4.1.7 of 3GPP TS 28.530 [15] (for Network Slice Provisioning capabilities,
Performance Assurance, Fault Supervision etc.).
NOTE: OAM interfaces and/or network slice information can be exposed to an
authorized (trusted) third-party (NSCE) only after a contract has been signed
between the MNO and this third-party. Whether and how CAPIF/EGMF can be used
to expose management services (MnS) is up to SA5 decision.
Figure 7.2-2 illustrates the architecture for interconnection between NSCE
servers.

server
The NSCE server interacts with another SEAL server for inter-service
communication over SEAL-X reference point.
## **7.3 Functional entities description**
### **7.3.1 General**
The functional entities for network slice capability enablement SEAL service
are described in the following subclauses.
### **7.3.2 Network slice capability enablement server**
The network slice capability enablement server functional entity provides the
application layer enablement of the network slicing aspects to support the VAL
applications. The network slice capability enablement server acts as CAPIF\'s
API exposing function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [3].
### **7.3.3 Network slice capability enablement client**
The network slice capability enablement client functional entity acts as the
application client for the slice enablement. The network slice capability
enablement client interacts with the network slice capability enablement
server to trigger network slice related operations such as adaptation due to
an application requirement change. This trigger may be due to an application
QoS requirement change, a service operation change. The NSCE client may
receive a network slice / DNN re-mapping notification from the NSCE server.
The NSCE client may optionally notify the VAL client on the network slice /
DNN re-mapping.
## **7.4 Reference points description**
### **7.4.1 General**
The reference points for the functional model for network slice capability
enablement are described in the following subclauses.
### **7.4.2 NSCE-UU**
The interactions related to network slice capability enablement functions
between the network slice capability enablement server and the network slice
capability enablement client are supported by NSCE-UU reference point. This
reference point utilizes Uu reference point as described in 3GPP TS 23.501
[14].
### **7.4.3 NSCE-C**
The interactions related to network slice capability enablement functions
between the VAL client(s) and the network slice capability enablement client
within a VAL UE are supported by the NSCE-C reference point. The NSCE client
may receive application requirement change, application client information
(such as its KQI) over NSCE-C. Further, the NSCE client may provide a
notification on the network slice adaptation upon successful adaptation of the
slice to application mapping.
### **7.4.4 NSCE-S**
The interactions related to network slice capability enablement functions
between the VAL server(s) and the network slice capability enablement server
are supported by the NSCE-S reference point. This reference point is an
instance of CAPIF-2 reference point as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [3].
### **7.4.5 N33**
The reference point N33 supports the interactions between the network slice
capability enablement server and the NEF and is specified in 3GPP TS 23.501
[14]. N33 is used for the network-based mechanism for slice re-mapping, where
NSCE server acting as AF influences the URSP rules for the application traffic
per UE by providing a guidance on the route selection parameters (including
the S-NSSAI and DNN mapping), as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [12] clause
4.15.6.10, 3GPP TS 23.503 [17] clause 6.6.2.2, 3GPP TS 23.548 [18] clause
6.2.4.
### **7.4.6 NSCE-E**
The interactions between the NSCE servers are generically referred to as
NSCE-E reference point. This reference point supports information collection
from other NSCE servers as defined in clause 9.8, **Service continuity
negotiation as defined in clause 9.9.2**.
### **7.4.7 NSCE-OAM**
The interface between the NSCE server and the OAM system are generically
referred to as NSCE-OAM reference point. This reference point supports
provisioning of management service as defined in clause 6.1, 3GPP TS 28.531
[8].
NOTE: The NSCE-OAM reference point is out of scope of this specification, and
is defined by SA5.
### **7.4.8 SEAL-X**
The interactions between the NSCE servers and other SEAL servers are
generically referred to as SEAL‑X reference point. The specific SEAL server
interactions corresponding to SEAL-X are described in 3GPP TS 23.434 [2].

The common identities for SEAL refer to TS 23.434[2]. The following clauses
list the additional identities and commonly used values for Network Slice
Capability Enablement.
## 8.2 NSCE server ID
The NSCE server ID uniquely identifies the Network Slice Capability enablement
server.
## 8.3 NSCE client ID
The Network Slice Capability enablement client ID identifies a particular NSCE
client.
## **8.4 Network Slice related Identifier**
The network slice related identifier identifies the network slice, which is
mapped to the VAL application.
The identifier of the network slice is either S-NSSAI defined in 5.15.2.1 TS
23.501[16], or External Network Slice Information (ENSI) defined in TS
33.501[14].
Based on the operator's policy, if the service applies for a certain network
slice instance, the identifier of Network Slice instance is used, i.e. NSI ID
as defined in TS 23.501 or ENSI. If used, the NSI ID is associated with
S-NSSAI.
## 8.5 Slice coverage area
The slice coverage area is the area where the network slice is available in
the whole PLMN or in one or more Tracking Areas of the PLMN. The slice
coverage area can be expressed as a Topological Service Area (e.g. a list of
TA), a Geographical Service Area (e.g. geographical coordinates) or both.
## 8.6 NSCE service area
The NSCE service area is the area where the Network Slice Capability
Enablement server owner provides its services. It is equal to the collection
of coverage area of slices it can enable.
The NSCE service area can be expressed as a Topological Service Area (e.g. a
list of TA), a Geographical Service Area (e.g. geographical coordinates) or
both.
NOTE: The NSCE server service area shall not smaller than the collection of
slice(s) coverage area(s) the NSCE server can enable.
# 9 Procedures and information flows
## 9.1 General
### **9.1.1 Common Information Elements**
**9.1.1.1 General**
This clause provides descriptions for Information Elements which are commonly
used in several procedures.
#### **9.1.1.2 Service requirement**
The service requirement indicates the VAL application requirements pertaining
to the slice(s).
Table 9.1.1.2-1: Service requirement
Information element Status Description
* * *
VAL service ID M The identification of the application ID related with the
service requirement. VAL service KPIs O KPIs including application QoS
requirements (latency, error rates, throughput, jitter,..) Network slice
related identifier(s) M Identifier of network slice for which the request
applies Application layer Service Profile O The properties of network slice
related requirement. If Service Profile is known by the VAL server, it can be
provided to the NSCE server. The GST defined by GSMA (see clause 2.2 in [5])
and the performance requirements defined in clause 7 TS 22.261 [6] are all
considered as input for it. Area of interest O The geographical or service
area for which the requirement applies
## **9.2 Registration**
For registration of the VAL server to be a recognized user of the CAPIF, the
VAL server triggers the CAPIF Onboarding the API invoker procedure defined in
3GPP TS 23.222[3] clause 8.1. The NSCE server could be deployed with CAPIF
core function.
Editor\'s note: What additional information is needed (e.g. the mapping of
slice ids to a VAL service) in onboarding request, and if needed, whether it
is specific for NSCE service or generally applicable for CAPIF are FFS
For de-registration of the VAL server, the VAL server triggers the CAPIF
Offboarding the API invoker procedure defined in 3GPP TS 23.222[3] clause 8.2.
## 9.3 Slice API configuration and translation
### 9.3.1 General
This functionality is a service related to the translation of the service API
as invoked by the end applications to slice APIs based on the API
configuration and application to slice mapping. **Slice APIs can be defined as
customized/tailored sets of service APIs (which can be either NEF northbound
APIs or OAM provided APIs or enabler layer/SEAL provided APIs) and can be
mapped to particular slice instances. The slice APIs can be a bundled or
combined API comprising of different types of APIs, which will be used to
expose the telco (5GS/SEAL)-provided services as needed by the applications of
the slice customer. Each slice API may be configured per network slice
instance.**
### 9.3.2 Procedure
#### 9.3.2.1 Procedures on slice API configuration
##### 9.3.2.1.1 General
In the Initial Configuration procedure, the VAL server initially provides an
application requirement to enabler server including the service KPIs and the
subscribed/preferred slices. Then, the slice enabler configures the mapping of
the VAL application to a slice API which is a combination/bundling of
northbound APIs (from both management and control plane). In particular, a
slice API consists of telco-provided/platform dependent service APIs (e.g.,
NEF, OAM, SEAL, etc), and provides an abstraction/simplification on top of
them. The VAL server-initiated Configuration Update procedure covers the
scenario where a trigger event occurs (e.g., QoS degradation, slice load) and
the mapping configuration or the slice API configuration needed to be changed.
In this scenario, the slice enabler updates the configuration of the API and
provides a notification to the VAL server.
These two procedures for the initial configuration and the configuration
update are covered in 9.3.2.1 and 9.3.2.2 respectively.
##### 9.3.2.1.2 Initial Configuration
Figure 9.3.2.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure of **the initial slice API
configuration.**
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL server has registered to receive NSCE services.
Figure 9.3.2.1.2-1: Initial Slice API configuration
1\. The VAL server sends a VAL application requirement request to the NSCE
server.
2\. The NSCE server maps the VAL application requirement to a slice API which
includes a list of APIs which is needed to be consumed as part of this service
capability exposure.
The NSCE server may also store the mapping of the slice API to the service API
list and per service API information (e.g. data encoding, transport
technology, API protocol and versions)
3\. The NSCE server registers to consume the corresponding APIs from the 5GS
(NEF and OAM) and SEAL service producers. The NSCE server registers to the
following:
\- to consume NEF monitoring events as specified in 3GPP TS 29.522 clause 5
e.g., network monitoring, slice status, analytics exposure, etc
\- to consume PM services and KPI monitoring from OAM
\- to consume SEAL services based on 3GPP TS 23.434
4\. The NSCE server sends a VAL application requirement response to notify on
the result of the request and indicate whether the configuration of slice API
is possible or not.
5\. The NSCE server sends the slice API information notification to the VAL
server.
##### 9.3.2.1.3 VAL server-initiated Configuration Update
Figure 9.3.2.1.3-1 illustrates the procedure of **the slice API configuration
updated based on a trigger event.**
Pre-conditions:
1\. Initial configuration of the slice API has been completed successfully.
2\. A trigger event, which may result the need of a slice configuration
change, is captured by the VAL server (application server relocation to
different EDN/DN, UE mobility to different EDN, application change of
behaviour).
Figure 9.3.2.1.3-1: Slice API configuration update
1\. The VAL server sends a VAL server-initiated configuration update request
to the NSCE server.
2\. The NSCE server processes the trigger event and checks the feasibility of
such change and updates the mapping of service APIs to the slice APIs. One
criterion for the update of the mapping is, if possible, to avoid changing the
slice API configuration, which can be achieved by the re-mapping of the
underlying service APIs
3\. The NSCE server updates the subscription/registration to the underlying
5GS and SEAL service producers, if an update on the service APIs (e.g., NEF
APIs, SEAL APIs, OAM provided APIs) is needed.
4\. The NSCE server sends a VAL server-initiated configuration update
response, containing the new slice API information, if an update has been
carried out by the NSCE server.
#### 9.3.2.2 Procedure on slice API translation
This procedure follows the 9.3.2.1 and aims to describe how the slice API
invocation request is translated to service API invocations after the slice
API configuration mapping. In this procedure, the NSCE server initially
receives a slice API invocation request from the vertical application. Then,
the NSCE server fetches the service APIs to be invoked based on the slice API
configuration and performs invocation requests to the corresponding service
API providers.
Figure 9.3.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure of the slice API translation based
on the initial configuration.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL server has registered to receive NSCE services.
2\. The slice API mapping to the VAL server has been performed based on
9.3.2.1.2 step 2 and the slice API information is provided to the VAL server
based on 9.3.2.1.2 step 5.
Figure 9.3.2.2-1: Slice API translation
1\. The VAL server sends a slice API invocation request to the NSCE server
2\. The NSCE server checks that the user is authenticated and authorized to
perform the slice API invocation and maps the requested slice API to a service
APIs. If CAPIF is used, the NSCE server acts as AEF, and the authorization is
obtained by CCF.
3\. The NSCE server generates a trigger for service API invocation requests to
all the service APIs within the slice API.
4\. The NSCE server performs the corresponding service API invocation
procedures based on CAPIF or via performing requests to the corresponding
service API providers, which are mapped to the slice API. If CAPIF is used,
the requests are sent to the corresponding AEFs of the API provider\'s domain,
and the authorization is obtained by CCF.
5\. The NSCE server sends a slice API invocation response to the VAL server,
based on the result of the service API invocation response(s) of step 4.

## 9.4 Application layer network slice lifecycle management
### 9.4.1 General
When NSCE receives a request for application layer network slice lifecycle
management (AppLayer_NS_LCM) from VAL server, the NSCE server performs the
service operations including subscribing the event which may trigger the
management system to do the network slice lifecycle management, making the
network slice lifecycle management recommendation/decision, triggering the
network slice lifecycle management operations, notifying the consumer about
the network slice information.
### 9.4.2 Procedure
#### 9.4.2.1 Procedures on slice lifecycle management
Figure 9.4.2.1-1 illustrates a procedure of application layer network slice
lifecycle management based on network slice related data and QoE collected
from application layer.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NSCE server has authenticated and authorized to the capabilities to
collect current network slice from 5GS.
2\. The NSCE server has authenticated and authorized to the capabilities
trigger the network slice LCM operations.
3\. There is signed contract for LCM between the entities using VAL server and
entities using NSCE.
Figure 9.4.2.1-1: Application layer network slice lifecycle management
1\. The VAL server sends the application layer network slice lifecycle
management (AppLayer-NS-LCM) subscribe request to NSCE server, with network
slice requirements from VAL server/consumer (e.g. delay, throughput, load, the
maximum number of users supported, etc.). The request can indicate whether the
notification is needed before performing the AppLayer-NS-LCM. The request can
also indicate the trigger conditions, such as by providing the monitored
parameters and the corresponding thresholds as described in clause 9.4.3.2.
2\. After receiving the request, the NSCE server checks that the user is
authenticated and authorized to perform the corresponding AppLayer-NS-LCM
operations, and filters the unauthorized requests, if any.
3\. According to network slice requirements and/or the trigger conditions,
NSCE server triggers the provision of network slice status and QoE metrics. If
the trigger conditions are not indicated in the subscription, the NSCE server
can help to configure an appropriate trigger condition, such as report period
or thresholds.
3a. The network slice status could be collected through subscribing or
requesting to 5GS. List of network slice status parameters to be collected
are:
\- Network Slice load statistics information, and/or Network Slice load
predictions information from NWDAF/NEF as defined in TS 23.288 Table 6.3.3A.
\- Performance metric in the performance data file from OAM as defined in
clause 11.3 of TS 28.532 [7].
3b. Also, the NSCE server could get the information of QoE metrics from the
application layer domain by QoE metric subscribe as described in clause
9.4.3.5.
4\. Once authenticated and authorized, the NSCE server sends the AppLayer-NS-
LCM response to the VAL server.
5\. The NSCE server may process and combine the collected network slice status
and QoE metrics, if needed. The NSCE server may process and combine the
parameters in the trigger conditions, if multiple trigger conditions were
provided. Once the trigger condition or the combination of trigger conditions
are met which indicating the network slice requirements from VAL server is not
satisfied, the NSCE server determines whether and what network slice LCM
operations should be taken based on requirements from VAL server/consumer and
network slice status and QoE metrics, and makes the
decision(s)/recommendation(s), such as modifyNsi/AllocateNsi/DeallocateNsi
request as specified in TS 28.531 [8].
6\. Optionally, if it is indicated in the request to notify the VAL
server/consumer before performing the AppLayer-NS-LCM, the NSCE sends the
network slice LCM recommendation(s) with network slice information to VAL
server, to see whether takes the recommendation(s) or not.
7\. Optionally, the VAL server sends the response to NSCE server.
8\. Based on decision made by VAL server or NSCE server, the NSCE server sends
the network slice LCM request to the OAM.
9\. According to the corresponding operation(s) result, the NSCE server sends
the response to the VAL server.
### 9.4.3 Information flows

## 9.5 Network slice optimization based on VAL server policy
### 9.5.1 General
Based on policy from the vertical applications (e.g., to trigger some network
slice operations when the pre-configured thresholds are met), the network
slice parameters for the vertical applications could be optimized by
triggering the slice modification. The slice optimization can be triggered by
OAM, data/prediction retrieved from NWDAF via NEF, and NSCE server itself as
describe in 9.5.2.2.
### 9.5.2 Procedure
#### 9.5.2.1 VAL server policy management
##### 9.5.2.1.1 VAL server policy provisioning
Figure 9.5.2.1.1 illustrates **the procedure of** VAL server policy
provisioning from the VAL server to the NSCE server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NSCE server has information about the existing slice/slice
profile/slice services which VAL server is using.
Figure 9.5.2.1.1: VAL server policy provisioning
1\. VAL server sends VAL server policy provisioning request to NSCE server.
The request contains the policy, VAL server ID, Default policy indication, and
S-NSSAI. Optionally, the request contains the indicator of policy
harmonization.
The VAL server can request the NSCE server to mark the provisioned policy as
the default policy using the Default policy indication. The default policy
should serve as a VAL server policy for the slices provisioned without any
policy. Either the policy or default policy indication can be provided by the
VAL server.
The VAL server policy is in form of a policy profile which contains list of
trigger events associated with the parameters and expected actions. It
contains priority and scheduling information with pre-emption capability for
the policies. The scheduling information schedules the policy by defining the
schedule (start and end time) for the policy. The pre-emption capability
provides another, already successfully provisioned policy to pre-empt the
scheduled policy in the scheduled period.
> The supported policies are:
\- Based on monitored performance metric from OAM, when the max number of PDU
sessions or max number of UE is reached, trigger the slice modification with
expected parameters.
\- Based on monitored Network Slice load from NSACF, when the number of PDU
sessions or number of UE exceeds the threshold, trigger the slice modification
with expected parameters.
\- Based on monitored Network Slice load predictions from NWDAF, when Network
Slice load predictions (Predicted Number of PDU Session establishments at the
Network Slice) exceeds the threshold with high confidence, trigger the slice
modification with expected parameters.
\- Based on the monitored the time period, when getting to a certain time
period (e.g. summer vacation, spring festival etc.), trigger the slice
modification with expected parameters.
\- Based on the monitored time period, when getting to a certain time period,
trigger the slice modification based on the expected QoS per UE. QoS is
mapped/calculated by NSCE to specific parameters of the slice such as the
dLThptPerUE, uLThptPerUE, dLThptPerSliceSubnet, uLThptPerSliceSubnet,
delayTolerance, dLLatency, uLLatency.
2\. The NSCE server checks whether the policy is conflict with the MNO
policies or NSPP. One criterion is to translate the network slice parameters
in the service profile to see whether it is conflict with that in the VAL
provided policy. If policy harmonization is not requested and policies
conflict then the request could be rejected. The NSCE server also checks the
validity of the policy (policy is valid for the specified time period or until
the specified threshold count of trigger events is achieved) to avoid a ping-
pong effect of slice modification. If the policy is invalid, the request could
be rejected.
3\. If the policy harmonization is requested, the NSCE server can harmonize
the policy as per clause 9.5.2.1.4 and this may result in the changes to the
current VAL server policy under provisioning.
4\. NSCE server sends the VAL server policy provisioning response to the VAL
server to indicate whether the request is successful or not. If it is
successful, policy ID is provided to VAL server.
##### 9.5.2.1.2 VAL server policy Update
Figure 9.5.2.1.2-1 illustrates the VAL server policy update procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NSCE server has information about the existing slice/slice
profile/slice services that the VAL server is using.
2\. The VAL server has created policies in NSCE server using the procedure
defined in clause 9.5.2.1.1.
Figure 9.5.2.1.2-1: VAL server policy update
1\. VAL server sends VAL server policy update request to NSCE server. The
request shall contain the policy ID and policy modification details for
updating the policy in the NSCE server. The request can update the existing
default policy or specify a new default policy for the mentioned slice in the
request. The policy update procedure can update the scheduling and pre-emption
information for the policy.
> 2\. The NSCE server checks whether the policy is conflict with the MNO
> policies or NSPP.
>
> 3\. If authorized, the NSCE server can harmonize the policy as per clause
> 9.5.2.1.4 and this may result in the changes to the current VAL server
> policy under update process.
4\. If the VAL server is authorized to update the VAL server policy, the NSCE
server checks the modification with existing policies to avoid conflict and
provides the response to the VAL server.
##### 9.5.2.1.3 VAL server policy Delete
Figure 9.5.2.1.3-1 illustrates the VAL server policy delete procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NSCE server has information about the existing slice/slice
profile/slice services that the VAL server is using.
2\. The VAL server has created one or more policies in NSCE server using the
procedure defined in clause 9.5.2.1.1.
Figure 9.5.2.1.3-1: VAL server policy delete
1\. VAL server sends VAL server policy delete request to NSCE server. The
request contains the policy ID, and optionally default policy indication. The
default policy indicates the update of the default policy in the case of a
delete request for the default policy. The policy delete procedure can be used
to delete one or more policies.
2\. If the VAL server is authorized to delete the VAL server policy, the NSCE
server deletes the policy. In the case of a default policy delete request, the
NSCE server first updates the default policy with the policy mentioned in the
delete request and then deletes the old default policy. The NSCE server
reports the outcome of the deletion of the requested policy with policy ID and
priority for the new default policy.
##### 9.5.2.1.4 Policy harmonization
Policy harmonization is to make sure the VAL server Policy (from VAL Provider/
slice customer/ASP) is compatible with the MNO policies and NSCE service
provider policy for the same service or slice. The policy harmonization could
be requested through the policy provisioning/update service.
Figure 9.5.2.1.4-1 illustrates **the procedure for policy harmonization.**
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NSCE service provider policy (NSPP) and MNO policy is available at the
NSCE Server.
2\. The VAL server is authorized to receive NSCE services.
Figure 9.5.2.1.4-1: Policy harmonization
1\. When receiving the policy provisioning, or policy update request, and the
result of policy check turn out the policy is conflict, the policy
harmonization is triggered.
2\. The NSCE server determines parameters harmonizing the policy, if
previously authorized.
3\. NSCE server sends the VAL server a notification providing parameters
values that allow the policies to be harmonized. Then the VAL server would
decide whether to accept the provided optional parameters values. If they are
accepted, the VAL server may invoke VAL server policy provisioning/ VAL server
policy update procedure defined in clause 9.5.2.1.1, 9.5.2.1.2 with harmonized
parameters values.
##### **9.5.2.1.5** **VAL server policy Usage Reporting data**
Figure 9.5.2.1.5-1 illustrates the VAL server policy usage reporting data
procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NSCE server has information about the existing slice/slice
profile/slice services which VAL server is using.
2\. The VAL server has created one or more policies using in the NSCE server
the procedure defined in clause 9.5.2.1.1.
Figure 9.5.2.1.5-1: VAL server policy usage reporting data
1\. VAL server sends VAL server policy usage reporting data subscribe request
to NSCE server. The request contains the policy ID, reporting interval, and
the required duration of the data.
2\. The NSCE server responds with a VAL server policy usage reporting data
subscribe response message indicating the success or failure of the
subscription.
3\. The NSCE server reports the policy reporting data containing the number of
times the policy has been used and the duration for which the policy was
active in the requested duration and details of the preemption of policies.
The reporting interval enables the periodic reporting of the requested report.
#### 9.5.2.2 Network slice optimization based on VAL server policy
Figure 9.5.2.2-1 illustrates **the procedure of** network slice optimization
based on VAL server policy.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NSCE server is authorized to get network slice management data
notification from OAM, and/or NWDAF via NEF.
2\. The VAL server is authorized to the NSCE server for network slice
optimization.
3\. There is enough network capacity when the expected action is to expand the
network slice.
4\. The VAL server policy has been pre-configured on the VAL server.
5\. The VAL server policy has been provided to the NSCE server as specified in
clause 9.5.2.1.
Figure 9.5.2.2-1: Network slice optimization based on VAL server policy
1\. VAL server sends network slice optimization subscription request to NSCE
server. The request contains the policy ID indicating the different policies.
Optionally the request contains the Secondary policy ID indicating the
fallback policy to be used for the failed network slice optimization. The NSCE
server retries the network slice optimization using a Secondary policy in the
case of a failed optimization.
2\. The NSCE server translates the trigger event to service API(s) with
necessary parameters, and subscribe to the related service if needed.
\- To get the monitored performance metric from OAM, the
notifyThresholdCrossing as defined in TS 28.532[7] clause 11.3.1.3 which is
filled in with corresponding S-NSSAI in objectInstance could be used.
\- To obtain the Network Slice load predictions from NWDAF, the NSCE server
**subscribes to** the NWDAF prediction by invoking
Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Subscribe or Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Fetch as defined in
TS 23.288[4] clauses 6.1.1.2, and 6.1.1.2.
\- To monitor the Network Slice load (e.g. the number of UEs or the number of
PDU Sessions) from NSACF, the NSCE server **subscribes to** the NSACF by using
the Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe Request or
Nnsacf_SliceEventExposure_Subscribe_Request as defined in clause 4.15.3.2.10
of TS 23.502 [12], and the APIs defined in clause 6.2 of TS 29.536 [13] can be
utilized.
\- To monitor the time period, the NSCE server setup the timer.
3\. NSCE server sends the network slice optimization subscription response to
the VAL server to confirm the subscription of network slice optimization.
4\. Upon receiving the notification which indicating the trigger event is met,
i.e., the monitored information reaches the threshold or specific time period
is arrived, the NSCE server performs the expected action by triggering the
slice modification as specified in the VAL server policy. The network slice
modification could be triggered by consuming the Network Slice Provisioning
service with the modifyMOIAttributes operation as specified in TS 28.531 [8].
The OAM responds back to NSCE server that the requested slice modification was
successful or not. The slice modification requests contain the parameters need
to be updated to fit the requirement of network slice (e.g., scale in or scale
out the network slice capability), including at least one of the following,
uLThptPerSlice, dLThptPerSlice, dLThptPerUE, uLThptPerUE,
dLThptPerSliceSubnet, uLThptPerSliceSubnet, delayTolerance, dLLatency,
uLLatency, maximum number of UEs, maximum number of PDU session as specified
in TS 28.541 [10].
NOTE 1: The slice modification could be done by application layer network
slice lifecycle management as defined in clause 9.4.
5\. The NSCE server provides a network slice optimization notification to the
VAL server. The successful response optionally includes the Optimization time
and the Enforced policy ID. The optimization time indicates the time the NSCE
server has taken to optimize the slice. The Enforced policy ID indicates which
secondary policy is used by the NSCE server for slice optimization in the case
of a failed attempt for network slice optimization.
NOTE 2: There is no expectation to have constant and exact mapping between
slice configuration parameters and actual traffic load of the same slice.
#### 9.5.2.3 Network slice optimization report retrieval
Figure 9.5.2.3-1 illustrates the Network slice optimization report retrieval
procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NSCE server has information about the existing slice/slice
profile/slice services that the VAL server is using.
2\. The VAL server has the created policies using the procedure defined in
clause 9.5.2.1.1.
3\. The VAL server has subscribed for the network slice optimization using the
procedure defined in clause 9.5.2.2.
Figure 9.5.2.3-1: Network slice optimization report retrieval
1\. The VAL server sends a Network slice optimization report request to the
NSCE server. The request shall contain the subscription ID, optimization
result window, and optional elements like optimization result filters, sorting
rules, and result size. The VAL server creates a filter using the optimization
result filter for the NSCE server requesting filtered successful or failed
responses. The VAL server can create additional sorting rules for the NSCE
server to request sorted results based on optimization time or policy ID or
slice optimization event time in ascending or descending order. The result
size indicates the number of results or responses for the report.
2\. The NSCE server provides the report to the VAL server as per the request
of the VAL server containing optimization response, optimization time, policy
ID, and Enforced Policy information.

## **9.6 Discovery of management service exposure**
### **9.6.1 General**
A Management Domain (MD) feature/capability is anything of use offered by the
management system to the 3^rd^ party application. Therefore, a new feature
could be a managed entity, a MnS or management API, any software, hardware, or
other functionality -- for example, new technology support, new coverage area,
new network slice type or instance, new NFs or new network slice subnet type
or instance. To be able to utilise capabilities/features of the management
system the applications must be made aware of existence of such features and
capabilities. All MD features/capabilities come with a pre-configured
exposure, where this can be configured by the operator for a given slice. This
exposure is used to decide which application can see which information
regarding the capability/feature. Exposure refers to the permissions that the
3^rd^ party entity has gained over its use of the management service, e.g.,
the ability to read, or execute or modify or delete can be considered as
different sorts of exposure.
The first procedure (9.6.2.1) provides the NSCE server support for translating
the VAL server request to a MnS requirement and the exposure of
service/management data related to his request. The second procedure (9.6.2.2)
supports the notification to the VAL server, based on a new/modified MnS /
capability for a target slice.
### **9.6.2 Procedure**
#### 9.6.2.1 VAL-triggered MnS discovery procedure
In this procedure, the VAL server initially requests the new MnS which are
supported by a target slice and based on this request the NSCE server requests
from the OAM/MnS registry the MnS discovery. Then, the OAM/MnS registry
derives the details to be exposed based on the NSCE server/VAL server
permissions and provides the list of MnS for the given slice and the access
details via the NSCE server to the VAL server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL server has registered to receive NSCE services.
2\. The NSCE server is trusted by the OAM, and a contract has been signed
between the MNO and NSCE server provider to allow OAM interfaces and/or
network slice information exposure.
3\. MnS registry at OAM is aware of the allowed MnS and the permissions for a
given slice.
Figure 9.6.2.1-1 illustrates **a solution for the MnS discovery support.**
Figure 9.6.2.1-1: MnS discovery support
**The steps of this procedure are as follows:**
1\. The VAL server sends a Management Service Discovery subscribe request
message to NSCE server to indicate a requirement for receiving the expected
exposure capability type and the related permissions for a target slice or for
a given VAL application.
2\. The NSCE server sends a response to the subscription request, indicating a
success or failure of the subscription request.
NOTE 1: If CAPIF is used, the API interactions for the MnS discovery
subscription shall be compliant with CAPIF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222.
3\. The NSCE server translates the requirement based on the subscription, and
in particular identifies the needed exposure capability type and translates it
to a MnS exposure requirement. Such translation of the requirement includes
the mapping to a list of MnSs (specified in TS 28.532) which are needed for
the given slice and VAL server permissions.
4\. The NSCE server coordinates with the 5GS and discovers the related network
service(s), by triggering the MnS service discovery as specified in TS
28.537[9], clause 5.2.1.3. In particular, NSCE server acts as MnS discovery
service consumer (for all MnS needed for a target slice based on VAL
requirement) requests from MnS discovery service producer(s) at OAM the
discovery of MnS information for the MnS related to the target slice or VAL
application. The 5GS, MnS discovery service producer(s) sends the discovery
result including related exposure information such as management service
identifier, management service information and management service producer
information to the NSCE server.
NOTE 2: The actual connectivity in step 4 (e.g., exposure of MnS via CAPIF or
EGMF) follows the mechanism defined in SA5.
5\. The NSCE server sends a management service discovery subscription notify
message to provide the service/management data based on step 4, including the
list of MnS and the corresponding exposure details to the VAL server.
#### 9.6.2.2 OAM-triggered new/modified MnS discovery
This procedure includes the case when a new/modified MnS is deployed at the MD
for the given slice, and the OAM/MnS registry provides this information
directly to VAL server (assuming that VAL server has registered to the MD).
Pre-conditions:
1\. VAL server is registered to NSCE server based on clause 9.2.
2\. NSCE server has subscribed to OAM / MnS discovery service registry.
Figure 9.6.2.2-1: OAM-triggered new/modified MnS discovery
1\. The MnS registry may discover new or modified MnS in the 3GPP MD. Such
changes may be due to new/modified management service producers, new managed
entities (such as new radio, new technology or new NFs), new/modified
technical support (such as support in a new geography or coverage area),
availability of new management data, e.g., related to slice performance. An
example procedure related to the addition of a new MnS producer is provided in
TS 28.537 clause 5.2.1.1.
The MnS discovery service producer when capturing new or modified capability
(e.g. new MnS producer) related to the target slice or VAL application
identifies the NSCE server which needs to be informed (based on the
subscription) on the new/modified capability and derives the details to be
exposed to the VAL server (via the NSCE server). Then, the MnS registry sends
to the NSCE server the new / modified MnS.
NOTE: The actual connectivity in step 4 (e.g., exposure of MnS via CAPIF or
EGMF) follows the mechanism defined in SA5.
2\. The NSCE server determines the VAL server(s) that needs to be notified on
the new or modified MnS / MD capability based on their registrations. Then,
NSCE server generates and sends a notification with the required information
to be provided to the VAL server.
3\. The information on the discovered new/modified MnS is sent as a management
service discovery notification message from the NSCE server to VAL server.
### **9.6.3 Information flows**

## **9.7 Network slice related performance and analytics monitoring**
### **9.7.1 General**
The NSCE server supports the end to end network slice related performance and
analytic monitoring capability exposure. The NSCE server identifies which data
are needed, collects the data from different data sources (e.g., the OAM
system, the Core Network or the VAL end users), performs the data
organizations and aggregations and expose the processed data to VAL servers
for monitoring. Following clauses are for the procedures, information flows
and APIs for Network slice related performance and analytics monitoring
request and Network slice related performance and analytics reporting
respectively. The procedure in clause 9.7.2.1 is for task creation of the
network slice performance and analytics monitoring. The procedure in clause
9.7.2.2 is for the performance and analytics data retrieving when the data is
available. The procedure in clause 9.7.2.3 is for multiple network slices
performance and analytics consolidated report.
### **9.7.2 Procedure**
#### **9.7.2.1 Network slice related performance and analytics monitoring job
creation request**
For network slice related performance and analytics monitoring **job
creation** capabilities exposed to the VAL server, the VAL server triggers the
procedure by sending the network slice related performance and analytics
monitoring **job creation** reques**t** to NSCE server as Figure **9.7.2.2-1**
shows:
Figure 9.7.2.1-1: Request Network slice related performance and analytics job
creation monitoring
1\. The VAL server sends a request to NSCE server to create the Network slice
related performance and analytics monitoring job to collect the desired
service/VAL service specific performance and analytics data, the detailed
content of the reported data depends on the type of the VAL services. The
required end-to-end network slice related data performance data are indicated
by _Perflist_ IE as described in table 9.7.3.2-1.
2\. The NSCE server shall check if the VAL server is authorized to request the
network slice performance and analytics data monitoring job creation.
3\. NSCE server determines the requested data needed to collect from network
side and collects the performance measurements and analytics data of network
slice from 5GS. For OAM system, the APIs defined in clause 11.3, TS 28.532[7]
is utilized, e.g., packet delay, radio resource utilization. For CN functions,
the APIs of Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service defined in clause 7.3, TS 23.288 [4]
is utilized, e.g., slice load level related network data analytics, slice load
level related network data analytics.
4\. Optionally, NSCE server retrieves the KQI data of services, the QoE data
and the end user's information from NSCE client.
NOTE 1: The Data collection from NSCE client follows the mechanism defined in
SA4 EVEX in TS 26.531 clause 5.6.
NOTE 2: How the collected data is stored in the NSCE server is implementation
based.
5\. NSCE server responds to VAL server to inform the VAL server if the
monitoring request is succeed.
#### **9.7.2.2 Network slice related performance and analytics report
subscription and report**
For network slice related performance and analytics result subscription and
report, the VAL server triggers the procedure by sending the network slice
related performance and analytics report subscription to NSCE server, the NSCE
server reports the performance and analytics report after the subscription is
succeed, as Figure **9.7.2.2-1** shows:
Figure 9.7.2.2-1: Network slice related performance and analytics report
subscription and report
1\. The VAL server subscribes to the required performance and analytics
report.
2\. The NSCE server response to the VAL server to indicate whether the report
is successfully generated and ready.
3\. NSCE server correlates the performance data of network slice instance, the
analytics data of group of UEs and the KQI/QoE data to generate the
performance data and analytics data report as required by VAL server.
4\. NSCE server sends the performance report Notify to VAL server if the
report is ready.
#### **9.7.2.3 Multiple slices related performance and analytics**
consolidated **report request**
Based on preferred performance report request from the vertical applications,
the consolidated performance report for dedicated service from multiple slices
(PNI-NPN slice and PLMN slice of one network) can be offered to trusted third-
party AF.
Figure 9.7.2.3-1 illustrates **the procedur** e of multiple slices coordinated
**performance and analytics report** service from VAL server to NSCE server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The network slice enabler layer is capable to interact with PLMN 5GC or
OAM system to handle slices of PLMN and its PNI-NPNs.
2\. PNI-NPNs are deployed as network slices of the PLMN.
3\. NSCE server has subscribed for MDE and NWDAF analytics for the managed
slices of PLMN and PNI-NPN.
Figure 9.7.2.3 -1: Multiple slices performance and analytics consolidated
report process
1\. The VAL server initiates **multiple slices related performance and
analytics** consolidated **report** request towards the NSCE server. The
request includes VAL server ID, VAL service ID. The message also includes
application key performance indicator (such as end-to-end delay, throughput,
etc.) list and monitoring period.
2\. Upon receiving the request from the VAL server to manage the network slice
QoS monitoring report, the NSCE server makes authentication and authorization
of the VAL server and if VAL server is not authorized, the NSCE server replies
with failure response.
3\. The NSCE server makes mapping from application ID that received from VAL
server to slice identities (S-NSSAIs allocated in each network) and retrieves
the PNI-NPN slice related status information from MDE/NWDAF, i.e. analytics
data specified in 3GPP TS 28.104 [21] and TS 23.288 [4].
4\. The NSCE server retrieves the PLMN slice related performance information
from MDE/NWDAF. The services of Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service defined in clause
7.3 of TS 23.288 [4] and analytics data as specified in 3GPP TS 28.104 [21]
can be utilized.
5\. The NSCE server verifies and analyses analytics data of network slice
instances that is received from MDE/NWDAF about both PNI-NPN and PLMN slices,
then NSCE server makes consolidated performance report among different kinds
of network slices in specific period of time/location zone.
6\. The NSCE server sends the **multiple slices related performance and
analytics** consolidated **report response** towards VAL server including
application key performance indicator (such as end-to-end delay, throughput,
etc. ) list and monitoring period.

## **9.8 Information collection from NSCE server(s)**
### **9.8.1 General**
The collected information by NSCE server could be exposed to other NSCE
server(s) to optimize network resource allocation, based on the agreement
among the NSCE servers. Then the NSCE server providing network slice related
information acts as the producer, while the NSCE server obtaining network
slice related information is the consumer.
### **9.8.2 Procedure**
#### **9.8.2.1 Information collection from NSCE server(s) subscribe request
and response**
Pre-condition:
1\. The producer NSCE server #2 has agreement with consumer NSCE server #1 to
provide the collected slice information.
Figure 9.8.2.1-1: Information collection from NSCE server(s) subscribe request
and response
1\. The NSCE server#1 sends out the information collection subscribe request
with expected period and interested slice ID, e.g., List of SNSSAI. This step
could be done by pre-configuration.
2\. The NSCE server #2 shall check if the NSCE server #1 is authorized to get
the network slice information.
3\. After authentication, the NSCE server #2 collects slice information as
defined in clause **9.7.2.1** step3, step4.
NOTE: When the producer NCSE server is edge NSCE server, only local
information is collected and provided.
4\. The NSCE server #2 sends collected slice information to NSCE server #1.
5\. The NSCE server #1 may process the collected slice information (such as
information aggregation), if needed.
#### **9.8.2.2 Information collection from NSCE server(s) Notify**

## **9.9 Predictive slice modification in edge based NSCE deployments**
### **9.9.1 General**
In this feature, the NSCE server initially receives an expected/predicted UE
location/mobility change request outside an EDN service area for one or more
UEs within the VAL application session (e.g. such session can be an indirect
V2V session or a multiplayer gaming session). Then, the source NSCE server
checks with 5GS (OAM, 5GC) whether the serving slice is available and can
offer the same performance at the target EDN. Thereafter, NSCE server
evaluates the need for a slice modification (e.g. a slice lifecycle related
trigger change) e.g. a slice subnet resource adaptation to allow for
optimizing the application performance at the target area. Based on this
decision/recommendation, it provides the action to the OAM and supports the
re-mapping of NSCE server for the NSCE client proactively, before UE mobility
happens.
### **9.9.2 Procedure**
#### 9.9.2.1 Procedures on slice API configuration
In the procedure shown in Figure 9.9.2.1-1, a mechanism is provided to allow
for slice modification when a vertical application of single or group of VAL
UEs migrates (or is expected/predicted to migrate) to a different EDN
supported by different NSCE server**.**
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL server has subscribed to the network slice capability enablement
server
2\. The VAL client of VAL UE is mapped to Slice#1, and NSCE client of VAL UE
has established a connection to NSCE server#1 (S-NSCE server).
3\. The S-NSCE server has already discovered the T-NSCE server and its area of
coverage.
4\. The VAL server is subscribed to and received prediction of UE location
change
Figure 9.9.2.1-1: Support for predictive slice modification in distributed
NSCE server deployments
1\. The VAL server sends to S-NSCE server an application service continuity
requirement request due to predicted/expected UE or group UE mobility to a
target service area covered by a different EDN.
NOTE: Such UE predicted mobility at the VAL server can be based on UE mobility
analytics received by NWDAF or can be predicted by the VAL layer (VAL server
or VAL UE).
2\. S-NSCE server sends an application service continuity requirement response
to the VAL server as positive or negative acknowledgement.
3\. S-NSCE server determines to query the underlying 3GPP system on the slice
availability and conditions at the target service area (based on step 1
requirement). Such query may be in form of a request/response and include:
a. S-NSCE server interacting with 5GC to query the UE specific information
(location, UE connection capabilities) as well as network conditions (network
monitoring from NEF) and/or slice related analytics on the slice load (from
NWDAF as specified in TS 23.288 [4]).
b. S-NSCE server may also interact with OAM to query on the target slice
availability and the up-to-date configured slice parameters e.g. slice RRM
policies, modification of the NSI/NSSI resources (see TS 28.531 [8], 5.1.12)
at the target service area and measurements for the slice at the target area.
4\. S-NSCE server evaluates whether new NSCE service area supports slice #1
and if slice #1 offers similar performance in target area.
5\. If the current slice doesn\'t fulfil these requirements, S-NSCE sends to
the T-NSCE server (covering the target area) a service continuity negotiation
request (including the VAL application service continuity requirement and
optionally a proposed action) to negotiate on the trigger action.
6\. T-NSCE server determines the need for a slice lifecycle change at the
target area and translates this to a trigger action. This trigger action can
be based on the proposed action in step 5 and can be a requested slice
modification or the slice #1 creation/instantiation at the target area (this
may happen if a group of UEs are moving to the target area and use slice #1,
so it may be beneficial to create slice #1 at the target area).
7\. T-NSCE server sends to the S-NSCE server a service continuity negotiation
response including the determined trigger action.
8\. The S- or T-NSCE server may send the trigger action as a slice
modification trigger request to the slice provisioning MnS producer at OAM
(e.g. slice modification for network slice) to extend slice availability to
the target service area based on the expected/predicted VAL UE or VAL group
mobility. As response to the trigger action, the provisioning MnS producer
provides a slice modification trigger response to the corresponding NSCE
server with a positive or negative result.
9\. After the slice lifecycle change execution (based on the indication in
step 5), the S-NSCE server sends a notification to the VAL server and
optionally to the VAL client via S-NSCE client
10\. If the NSCE client needs to be remapped to different NSCE server (due to
the expected change of UE location), the NSCE client establishes a new
connection with T-NSCE and terminates the one with S-NSCE (in case of
subscription-based interaction), or in case of request-based interaction, it
updates the mapping at the client side, and maintains the new NSCE server
address / ID for the target NSCE area.

## **9.10 Multiple slices coordinated resource optimization**
### 9.10.1 General
Based on preferred QoS request from the vertical applications, the performance
monitoring of multiple slices of one network (PNI-NPN slice and PLMN slice)
and resource adjustment between different slices can be made to realize
optimized and efficient resource usage.
### **9.10.2 Procedure**
#### 9.10.2.1 Procedure on multiple slices coordinated resource optimization
Figure 9.10.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure of multiple slices coordinated
resource optimization service from VAL server to NSCE server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The network slice enabler layer is capable to interact with PLMN 5GC or
OAM system to handle slices of PLMN and its PNI-NPNs.
2\. PNI-NPNs are deployed as network slices of the PLMN.
Figure 9.10.2.1-1: Multiple slices coordinated resource optimization process
1\. The VAL server initiates multiple slices coordinated resource optimization
request towards the NSCE server. The request includes VAL server ID, VAL
service ID. The message also includes preferred optimization zone.
2\. Upon receiving the request from the VAL server to make the network slice
resource optimization, the NSCE server makes authentication and authorization
of the VAL server and if VAL server is not authorized to send multiple slices
coordinated resource optimization request, the NSCE server replies with
failure response.
3\. The NSCE server makes mapping from VAL service ID that received from VAL
server to slice identities (S-NSSAIs allocated in multiple networks) and

## 9.11 Network slice adaptation for VAL application
### 9.11.1 General
This subclause describes the procedure for network slice adaptation at the
Network Slice Capability Enablement (NSCE) server, based on a request from a
VAL server to adapt the network slice for the VAL application. This request is
handled between the NSCE server and the NSCE client per each VAL UE of the VAL
application. Such adaptation assumes that the UE is subscribed to more than
one slice and is done via providing a guidance to update the URSP rules at the
5GS (denoted in clause 9.11.2.1 as network-based mechanism).
### **9.11.2 Procedures**
#### **9.11.2.1 Procedure for VAL server-triggered and network-based network
slice adaptation for VAL application**
Figure 9.11.2.1-1 illustrates the VAL server-triggered and network-based
procedure where the NSCE server supports the network slice adaptation with the
underlying 3GPP system for the VAL UEs of the VAL application.
Figure 9.11.2.1-1: Network slice adaptation for VAL application
1\. The VAL server sends a network slice adaptation request to the NSCE server
for the VAL application (and the VAL UEs within the VAL application). This
request may be in the form of exact requested network slice (and optionally
DNN) for all the VAL UEs of the VAL application; or indication that the VAL
application needs to be remapped to a different network slice (and optionally
DNN). The request optionally includes the adaptation threshold of network
slice adaptation as defined in Table 9.11.3.1-1.
2\. [Optional]NSCE server collects the network slice status information,
including network slice performance measurements in clause 5.1.1.1, clause
5.1.1.2, clause 5.1.1.3, in 3GPP TS 28.552 [19] and key performance indicators
in clause 6.3, in 3GPP TS 28.554 [20], and network slice related E2E latency
analytics report in clause 8.4.2.4.3, in 3GPP TS 28.104 [21] from network
slice management functions by utilizing MnS of create MOI operation defined in
clause 11.1 and MnS of streaming data reporting service or file data reporting
service defined in clause 11.5 and 11.6, 3GPP TS 28.532 [7].
3\. The NSCE server processes the request and triggers the network slice
configuration per VAL UE within the VAL Application. If network slice status
from step 2 is considered, the NSCE server analyses the network slice status
information before triggering the network slice configuration. If the
threshold is crossed for the current network slice of adaptation and the
objective network slice satisfy the requests, NSCE server triggers the network
slice configuration per VAL UE within the VAL Application.
4\. The NSCE server acting as AF provides the updated S-NSSAI and DNN per VAL
UE. In particular, NSCE server sends this information to the PCF via NEF as
part of the AF-driven guidance for URSP determination to 5G system (as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [12] clause 4.15.6.10, 3GPP TS 23.503 [17] clause
6.6.2.2, 3GPP TS 23.548 [18] clause 6.2.4). This guidance may update the route
selection parameters to indicate different sets of PDU Session information
(DNN, S-NSSAI) that can be associated with applications matching the
application traffic.
NOTE: NSCE server provides the updated S-NSSAI/DNN as a suggestion/guidance to
PCF; however it is up to PCF to decide whether to perform the slice/DNN re-
mapping
> 5\. Upon successful adaptation of the route selection parameters, the NSCE
> server provides a network slice adaptation response to the VAL server,
> providing information on the fulfilment of the network slice adaptation
> request per VAL application.
#### 9.11.2.2 Procedure for VAL UE-triggered and network-based network slice
adaptation for VAL application
Figure 9.11.2.2-1 illustrates the VAL UE-triggered and network-based procedure
where the NSCE server supports the network slice adaptation with the
underlying 3GPP system for the VAL UEs of the VAL application.
Pre-condition:
\- The NSCE client has connected to the NSCE server;
{width="5.395833333333333in" height="2.4555555555555557in"}
Figure 9.11.2.2-1: Network slice adaptation for VAL application
1\. The VAL client provides a new application requirement to the NSCE client,
indicating a new service profile for the VAL application. This may be in the
form of a change at the application QoS requirements, location requirements,
time window requirement, access type preference (e.g., 3GPP, non-3GPP or multi
access) service operation change, or other application-related parameters.
2\. The NSCE client sends a network slice adaptation trigger to the NSCE
server for the VAL application. This trigger may be in the form of exact
requested network slice (and optionally DNN) for the VAL UE of the VAL
application; or indication that the VAL application needs to be remapped to a
different network slice (and optionally DNN). The trigger may also include
additional application requirements based on step1, e.g., the requested
location criteria, time window.
NOTE 1：How the requested network slice is known by the NSCE client is out of
scope of this release.
3\. The NSCE server processes the request and triggers the network slice
configuration per VAL UE within the VAL Application.
NOTE 2：Whether and how the NSCE server triggers the network slice adaptation
for all the VAL UEs within the VAL Application is out of scope of this
release.
NOTE 3: How the NSCE server decides to trigger the network slice configuration
is implementation dependent.
4\. The NSCE server acting as AF provides the updated S-NSSAI, application
requirements and DNN per VAL UE. In particular, NSCE server sends this
information to the PCF via NEF as part of the AF-driven guidance for URSP
determination to 5G system (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [12] clause
4.15.6.10, 3GPP TS 23.503 [17] clause 6.6.2.2, 3GPP TS 23.548 [18] clause
6.2.4). This guidance may update the route selection parameters to indicate
different sets of PDU Session information (DNN, S-NSSAI, application
requirements) that can be associated with applications matching the
application traffic. 5GC uses this information to update the URSP to the
affected UE(s).
NOTE 4: NSCE server provides the updated S-NSSAI/DNN as a suggestion/guidance
to PCF; however it is up to PCF to decide whether to perform the slice/DNN re-
mapping
5\. The NSCE server sends the response to the NSCE client indicating success
or failure.

## **9.12 Slice related communication service lifecycle management exposure**
### **9.12.1 General**
The NSCE server supports the slice related communication service lifecycle
management exposure to VAL server. The NSCE server acquires the application
services related requirements for a specific VAL service from the vertical
industry perspective, evaluates these requirements and then determines the
network slice by pre-configured industry mapping relations or by KQI-KPI
translation algorithms. After the network slice requirements are determined
the NSCE server allocate proper network slice resources to support the
application services. The NSCE server also enables the VAL server to
reconfigure or disengage the slice related communication services for the
application. The procedures in clause 9.12.2 are for creation, reconfiguration
and disengagement of slice related communication service respectively.
### **9.12.2 Procedure**
#### **9.12.2.1 Procedures on slice related communication service lifecycle
management exposure**
##### **9.12.2.1.1 Slice related Communication Service Creation**
Figure 9.12.2.1.1-1 illustrates the procedure of slice related
**communication** service creation**. The NSCE helps to allocate network slice
resources to support the application service required by the verticals.**
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL server has registered to receive NSCE services.
Figure 9.12.2.1.1-1: Slice related communication service creation
1\. The VAL server sends a request to NSCE server to create a slice related
communication service to support a specific application service, e.g., the VAL
server wants to create a video streaming service in a future factory, the
slice related communication service creation request carries the identifier of
the video streaming service and the corresponding service attributes.
2\. NSCE server translates the application service requirements (e.g., for a
video streaming service, the service location and the resolution of the video)
and then perform slice determination (e.g., dLtThptPerSlice, uLtThptPerSlice,
latency as defined in serviceProfile TS 28.541[14]). The NSCE may perform the
translation by pre-configured industry profiles or by KQI-KPI translation
algorithms which are out scope of standard. The procedures of APIs translation
defined in clause 9.3 are referred to.
3\. NSCE server initiates the Slice Service subscription procedures by
utilizing the management service of network slice creation as defined in
clause 6.1, TS 28.531[5] exposed by EGMF defined in SA5. The slice creation
request may fail due to the shortage of network resources or other causes.
4\. NCSE server sends the slice related communication service creation
response to VAL server. If the slice creation is succeeded in step3, then the
response from NSCE server should include the attributes and the values of
network slice determined by NSCE server. If the slice creation failed in
step3, the NSCE server shall indicate the cause of the creation failure, e.g.
the shortage of network slice resources.
##### **9.12.2.1.2 Slice related Communication Service Reconfiguration**
Figure 9.12.2.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure of **slice related
communication** service reconfiguration to support the application service**.

application service related requirements in case the current application
service is not satisfied or** application service is adjusted.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL server has registered to receive NSCE services.
2\. The VAL server has requested the NSCE server to create a slice related
communication service to support the application service.
Figure 9.12.2.1.2-1: Slice related communication service reconfiguration
1\. VAL server sends the slice related communication service reconfiguration
request to the NSCE server to reconfigure the properties of the application
service (e.g., In case there is a downgrade/upgrade of the application service
where the application service profile is changed).
2\. NSCE server translates the application requirements according to the
reconfigured application properties then updates the requested network slice.
3\. NSCE server initiates the Slice Service update procedures by utilize the
management service of network slice modification as defined in clause 6.1, TS
28.531[5] exposed by EGMF defined in SA5.
4\. NCSE server sends the slice related communication service modification
response to VAL server.
##### **9.12.2.1.3 Slice related Communication Service disengagement**

## **9.13 Predictive slice modification in Inter-PLMN based slice service
continuity**
### **9.13.1 General**
This feature applies to the specific deployment where NSCE service provider
provides its services when connected to two PLMNs and has SLA with them. In
this feature, the NSCE server initially receives an expected/predicted UE
location/mobility change request outside a PLMN1 slice service area for one or
more UEs within the VAL application session (e.g. such session can be a V2X
session). Then, the NSCE server checks with 5GS (OAM, 5GC) whether the serving
slice is available and can offer the same performance at the target PLMN. The
NSCE server evaluates the need for a slice modification (e.g. a slice
lifecycle related trigger change). Based on this decision/recommendation, it
provides the action to the OAM of PLMN2 proactively, before UE mobility
happens.
### **9.13.2 Procedure**
In the procedure shown in Figure 9.13.2-1, a mechanism is provided to allow
for slice modification when a vertical application of single or group of VAL
UEs migrates (or is expected/predicted to migrate) to a different PLMN
supported by the same NSCE server**.**
Pre-conditions:
1\. Enterprise hosting the VAL server has SLA for slice services with NSCE
service provider.
2\. The VAL server has subscribed to the network slice capability enablement
server managing slice services from PLMN1 and PLMN2.
3\. The VAL client of VAL UE is mapped to Slice#1, and NSCE client of VAL UE
has established a connection to PLMN1.
4\. The NSCE server is connected to OAMs of PLMN1 and PLMN2.
5\. The VAL server is subscribed to and received prediction of UE location
change from PLMN1 to PLMN2 in advance before the actual event.
Figure 9.13.2-1: Predictive Inter-PLMN slice service continuity
1\. The VAL server sends to NSCE server an Inter-PLMN application service
continuity requirement request due to predicted/expected UE or group UE
mobility from source service area of slice1 in PLMN1 to a target service area
covered by a different slice service area in slice#2/PLMN2.
NOTE: Such UE predicted mobility at the VAL server can be available before the
event based on UE mobility analytics received by NWDAF or can be predicted by
the VAL layer (VAL server or VAL UE).
2\. NSCE server sends an Inter-PLMN application service continuity requirement
response to the VAL server as positive or negative acknowledgement depending
on its capability to provide such service serving both areas/slices in both
PLMNs and available resources.
3\. NSCE server determines to query the underlying 5G system on the slice
availability and conditions at the target service area/slice2/PLMN2 (based on
step 1 requirement). Such query may be in form of a request/response and
include:
a. NSCE server interacting with 5GC/PLMN2 to query the UEs specific
information (location, UEs connection capabilities) as well as network
conditions (network monitoring from NEF) and/or slice related analytics on the
slice load (from NWDAF as specified in TS 23.288 [4]).
b. NSCE server may also interact with OAM/PLMN2 to query on the target slice
availability and the up-to-date configured slice parameters e.g. slice RRM
policies, modification of the NSI/NSSI resources (see TS 28.531 [8], 5.1.12)
at the target service area and measurements for the slice at the target area.
4\. NSCE server determines the need for a slice lifecycle change at the slice
target area and translates this to a trigger action. This trigger action can
be based on the outcome of step 3 and can be a requested slice modification
(slice2/PLMN2) or creation/instantiation of new slice at the target area (this
may happen if a group of UEs are moving to the target area and the requested
slice2 is missing in the target area).
5\. The NSCE server may send the trigger action as a slice modification
trigger request to the slice provisioning MnS producer at OAM/PLMN2 (e.g.
slice modification for network slice) to extend slice availability to the
target service area based on the expected/predicted VAL UE or VAL group
mobility. As response to the trigger action, the provisioning MnS producer
provides a slice modification trigger response with a positive or negative
result.
6\. After the slice lifecycle change execution (based on the indication in
step 5), the NSCE server sends a notification to the VAL server and optionally
to the VAL client containing the positive or negative result from step5.
7\. If big number of UEs is migrating from PLMN1 to PLMN2, there might be a
need to further modify/reduce the respective slice resources of PLMN1. NSCE
sends trigger request to the slice provisioning MnS producer at OAM/PLMN1
(e.g. slice modification for network slice) to decrease slice availability to
the source area after the UEs have migrated.

## **9.14 Network slice diagnostics**
### **9.14.1 General**
Network slice diagnostics provides possibility for the vertical/ASP using VAL
server to receive information about the specific event(s) related to service
experience. The vertical/ASP using the VAL server has estimated bad QoE for a
mobile user or service -- either reported from a mobile user or service or
detected by application and can initiate a check with NSCE. The NSCE server
can provide details related to the identified event.
### **9.14.2 Procedure**
#### 9.14.2.1 Network slice diagnostics procedure
In the procedure shown in Figure 9.14.2.1-1, a mechanism is provided to allow

## **9.15 Network slice fault management** capability exposure
### **9.15.1 General**
5GS is required to provide suitable APIs to allow a trusted third-party to
monitor the network slice used for the third-party according to operator
policies. And network diagnostics is of key importance that helps with
scanning, diagnosing and identifying problems within a network. Diagnostics
includes gathering data and continuously providing sufficient fault diagnosis
results that characterize the quality of the network connections and services.
Exposure of relevant (and possibly aggregated) performance parameters ensures
a quick reaction in case of failure as well as identifying network
connectivity, performance and other related problems. Also, the alarm data
from different sources (e.g., OAM, VAL server, NSCE client) can be used to
help the third-party to diagnose the fault problem of the services, locate the
fault causes, and to be aware of the potential fault. In TS 28.545 [23], the
fault supervision management services are standardized by which the alarm of
the network slice instance from network resource aspects can be subscribed and
reported. This alarm information together with the application function\'s
fault report and communication service related knowledge can be utilized by
the NSCE to diagnose the cause of the service performance deterioration,
locate the fault of the communication services, and expose the fault report to
the third-party.
For example, if the status of the required communication is not correct, the
SEAL/NSCE derives this alarm information from application functions. In this
case, it is the SEAL/NSCE\'s responsibility to detect whether this fault is
caused by the 5GS network or not and exposed the fault report to the third-
party. If it is, then the SEAL/NSCE may inform the management functions the
location of the fault and ask for the maintenance of the managed functions to
clear the fault.
This service provides a possible procedure to illustrate the network slice
fault management capability exposed by NSCE server. The performance data and
alarm data from multiple sources is helpful to characterize the quality of the
network connection.
### **9.15.2 Procedure**
#### 9.15.2.1 Procedures on network slice fault management capability exposure
Figure 9.15.2.1-1 illustrates the network slice fault management process to
address the key issue 4 of network slice fault management.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The network slice enabler layer is capable to interact with NEF and OAM
system.
2\. The VAL server has checked the status of application layer.
Figure 9.15.2.1-1: Support for predictive slice modification in distributed
NSCE server deployments
1\. The VAL server sends a subscription to NSCE server to subscribe the fault
diagnosis of the applications and networks. This request may be triggered by
the errors of the applications detected by the VAL server itself, or the VAL
server may periodically collect the fault diagnostic report subscribing to the
NSCE.
2\. NSCE server sends the response of the subscription to VAL server.
3\. Optionally, on receiving the request from VAL server, NSCE server
subscribes the performance data of network slice from 5GS. For OAM system, the
APIs defined in clause 11.3, TS 28.532[7] is utilized. For CN functions, the
APIs of Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service defined in clause 7.3, TS 23.288[4] can
be utilized.
> The analytics data defined in clause 6.3 to clause 6.14, TS 23.288[4],
> network slice instance related performance data defined in clause 5, TS
> 28.552[19] and network analytics data in clause 8.3 and clause 8.4 TS
> 28.104[21] exposed by OAM system may be acquired. Also, the analytics result
> of slice-specific performance and slice usage analytics defined in TS
> 23.436[26] can be utilized.
4\. NSCE server subscribes the alarms of network slice instances from OAM
system via the procedures defined in clause 6.1, TS 28.545[23], and the alarms
are defined in clause 4.1.1.1, TS 32.111-1 [24], e.g., the fault of
communication, environmental, equipment, processing error, QoS for
device/resource/file/functionality/smallest.
5\. NSCE server may subscribe the alarm information (e.g., the 5GS network is
not work or the required performance is under the threshold which leads the
service\'s problem) collected by NSCE client if possible. The information
collected by the NSCE client depends on the third-parties\' requirements and
implementation.
6\. NSCE client report the requested fault information to NSCE server.
Note: The collection of fault data from NSCE client follows the mechanism
defined in EVEX in SA4.
7\. Every time the notifications from the OAM, NSCE client or ADAEs are
received, NSCE server correlates this data, diagnoses the causes of the fault
of the applications or services by analysing the fault information from
different sources and prepares report for the VAL to be notified about the
respective fault event. For example, the RAN function of the slice instance
which is utilized to support the service of the smart grid application, for a
certain time duration, the smart grid suffered the bad experience caused by
Service Availability Failure Events, and in the RAN function is detected
continuously to report an alarm of environmental fault in the same time
duration, then the environment fault may be the root cause of the Service
Availability Failure and should be prioritized to be solved. The fault may be
identified with \"critical\", \"major\", \"minor\", \"ignore\" to show its
prioritization.
8\. If the NSCE server detects that the application/service error (reported
from NSCE client) is caused by the 5GS, the VAL server may send the fault
diagnosis report to OAM system to indicate the server fault which causes the
application/service failure by utilizing the NSCE-OAM interface.
NOTE: The APIs utilized to send the fault diagnosis report to OAM will re-
utilize the fault management services in TS 28.532[7] exposed by EGMF as
defined in TS 28.533[25].
9\. NSCE server send a notification to VAL server with the fault diagnostics
report prepared in step 7.

## **9.16 S** lice requirements verification and alignment capability exposure
### **9.16.1 General**
Verticals can compare the QoS achieved by the provider with the QoS/slice
requirements and its own experience of the QoS to verify if the QoS/Slice
requirements are reasonably configured. To order a slice with certain slice
requirements parameters and their values, the verticals will put their best
effort into slice requirements translation. However, they are not able to
guarantee that all the potential factors will be considered to generate the
optimal slice requirements parameters on the first try.
In some cases, there may be some unforeseen exceptions (e.g., unexpected
traffic changes) and the current configured slice requirements parameters are
not able to fulfil the verticals requirements (e.g., more resources are
required to address the exceptions), the VAL client may also suffer
unsatisfied experience. Or in some other cases, when the service is executed
on the required slice, the slice may not fully match the service real-time
running conditions, for example, maybe only 60% of the slice resource is used
to support the service, and rest of the slice resource is always idle, or the
slice resource is insufficient due to under-provisioning.
Hence, NSCE is able to provide the capability of comparing the QoS achievement
status together with the OAM QoS data versus real customer QoS data (e.g.,
Mean Opinion Score) collected from VAL client to check whether the existing
QoS/Slice related data is able to satisfy the VAL clients and send
periodically alignment notifications to VAL server for the slice requirements.
### **9.16.2 Procedure**
#### 9.16.2.1 Procedures on slice requirements verification and alignment
capability exposure
Figure 9.16.2.1-1 provides a possible procedure of slice requirements
verification and alignment capability exposure.
> Pre-conditions:
>
> 1\. The NSCE Server has subscribed to the service of network slice
> performance management provided by EGMF.
Figure 9.16.2.1-1: Slice requirements verification and alignment process
1\. The VAL server sends slice requirements verification and alignment
subscription NSCE server to require the NSCE server to check whether the slice
requirements (by configuring the attributes of _serviceProfile_) matches the
real network slice usage status, the request may include the S-NSSAI, the ID
of the VAL server, the slice requirements parameters (attributes of
_serviceProfile_) which is requested to be aligned.
2\. The NSCE server checks if the VAL server is authorized to trigger the
service of slice requirements alignment.
3\. The NSCE server response to VAL server with the result of slice
requirements verification and alignment request, e.g., the slice requirements
alignment request is accepted.
4\. The NSCE server may optionally subscribe the QoE data from the NSCE
client. The QoE data can refer to the data defined in clause 16, TS
26.114[27]. Note: The QoE data collection from NSCE client follows the
mechanism defined in EVEX work in SA4.
5\. The NSCE server subscribes the network slice related performance data and
KPIs (e.g., the average PRB usage, the distribution of the PRB usage) defined
in TS 28.552[19]. The NSCE server can aslo subscribe the analytics data (both
statistics and predictions) from MDAS and ADAEs.
6\. NSCE server periodically receives the subscribed data (from steps 4 and 5)
and compares the slice requirement parameters of network slice (the values of
attributes of _serviceProfile,_ e.g., radioSpectrum, the maxNumberofUEs) with
network slice performance statistics (e.g., active number of users, the
average PRB usage, the distribution of the PRB usage of the S-NSSAI) to
generate the optimal slice requirements for the required service (represented
by S-NSSAI) of the vertical. This step depends on implementation (e.g., if in
implementation specific time window the VAL client experience is satisfied
while the network slice resources are with low utilization, the resources
required in the slice requirements could be reduced based on predictions and
statistics).
7\. Based on the analysis in step 6, the NSCE server periodically sends
notifications to VAL server to inform the recommended changes of the slice
requirements parameters.

## 9.17 Network Slice Information delivery
### 9.17.1 General
The NSCE layer provides the feature of Network Slice information delivery. The
Network Slice information is necessary for the VAL server to manage the
network slice for their service such as preparation, creation, activation and
termination (tear-down) of network slice.
The Network Slice information that is delivered to the VAL server depends upon
network operator policy. The network slice capabilities and management options
offered to the customer are determined by a business agreement prior to and
outside of the scope of 3GPP standards.
The NSCE server performs the below.
\- Retrieval of Network Slice ServiceProfile in 5GS (e.g., NSMF) as specified
in 3GPP TS 28.532 [7]
\- Conversion of Network Slice ServiceProfile (specified in 3GPP TS 28.541
[10]) to Network Slice Information
\- Creation of Network Slice Information
\- Storing of Network Slice Information
\- Delivery of Network Slice Information to VAL server that the Network Slice
Customer is authorized to use.
NOTE: The Network Slice Information provided to the VAL server depends on
service agreements.
The VAL server as a Network Slice consumer makes use of the delivered Network
Slice information for the Network Slice Lifecycle management for its service.
### 9.17.2 Procedure
#### 9.17.2.1 Network Slice Information delivery request
This subclause depicts the procedure of the Network Slice Information delivery
to the VAL server via NSCE server, when the VAL server requests the Network
Slice Information after registration.
Pre-condition:
1\. The NSCE server should have the agreement with MNO (NOP) for retrieval of
ServiceProfile, if the NSCE server is the external entity.
Figure 9.17.2.1-1: Network Slice Information delivery request
1\. The NSCE server retrieves the Network Slice ServiceProfile from 5GS (e.g.,
NSMF) when the NSCE server acting as a NSP prepares a Network Slice to be
provided. The NSCE server follows the procedure to request/receive the Network
Slice Service Profile with \'getMOIAttributes\' operation as specified in 3GPP
TS 28.532[7].
NOTE: If NSCE server and NSMF are in same operator, then the NSCE server gets
access directly to NSMF. The delivered Network Slice Service Profile contains
the values of attributes such as PLMN, S-NSSAI, SST, maximum number of UEs,
maximum number of PDU sessions, Slice Coverage Area, Latency, and, Data
volume, which specify the Network Slice characteristics, as specified in
clause of ServiceProfile in 3GPP TS 28.541 [10].
2\. The NSCE server, as Network Slice as a Service, creates and stores the
Network Slice information. When NSCE server retrieves the Network Slice
Information, it is necessary for NSCE server to convert the attributes in
Network Slice ServiceProfile to the Network Slice information for readable
information and to compose the Network Slice information, according to the
NSP\'s policy.
In order to reduce to request often the Network Slice Information Retrieval,
the NSCE server stores the Network Slice information.
3\. The VAL server requests the Network Slice Information to the NSCE server.
If the VAL server needs to know the specific attribute value for its service,
then the attribute name of Network Slice Information (e.g., S-NSSAI, SST,
Slice Coverage Area, etc.) can be added in the Request message.
4\. The NSCE server performs to check whether the requesting VAL server is
registered or not. The NSCE server identifies which the Network Slice Customer
is authorized to use.
5\. The NSCE server sends the Network Slice Information, if the VAL server is
registered and authorized. The NSCE server rejects to the request of the
Network Slice Information, if not registered.
#### 9.17.2.2 Network Slice Information delivery to NSCE client request
This subclause depicts the procedure of the Network Slice Information delivery
to the NSCE client via NSCE server.
Pre-condition:
1\. The network slice has been allocated/created to VAL server.
Figure 9.17.2.2-1: Network Slice Information delivery to NSCE client
> 1\. The VAL server sends a request to NSCE server to deliver the Network
> Slice Information to the NSCE Clients. The request includes the network
> slice information and indication of the UE notification with VAL UE\'s ID
> List.
2\. The NSCE server delivers the Network Slice Information to the NSCE Clients
of VAL UEs based on the VAL UE\'s ID list from step 1, in case the Network
Slice Allocation is successful, if the NSCE server does not perform AF-driven
guidance for URSP determination to 5GS.
The Network Slice Information contains the VAL service ID, S-NSSAI, and DNN.
3\. The NSCE client stores and applies the Network Slice Information.
> NOTE: If the UE is provisioned with URSP rules by the network operator, the
> UE handles the precedence between the delivered network slice info via NSCE
> layer info and URSP rules as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.503
> [17]. How the UE uses the Network Slice info delivered via NSCE layer in
> relation to the URSP is implementation dependent.
4\. The NSCE client sends the Network Slice Allocation Information response to
the NSCE server.
> 5\. The NSCE server sends the response to the Network Slice Information
> delivery to NSCE client request.

## 9.18 Network Slice Allocation in NSaaS model
### 9.18.1 General
When in NSaaS model, the NSCE server performs the Network Slice allocation
operation on behalf of the VAL server. The non-trusted 3^rd^ party application
(i.e., VAL server) cannot access to the 5GS management system directly. So,
the NSCE server needs to perform the authentication and authorization for the
registration of VAL server on behalf of 5G MnS.
The Network Slice creation that is triggered by the VAL server depends upon
network operator policy. The network slice capabilities and management options
offered to the customer are determined by a business agreement prior to and
outside of the scope of 3GPP standards.
The VAL server can identify the Network slice in Network Slice creation
request with the Network Slice indicator (e.g., S-NSSAI).
Upon network slice allocation, the NSCE server acts as the network slice
provisioning MnS consumer. The NSCE server requests \'AllocacatedNsi\'
operation to the network slice provisioning MnS producer as specified in 3GPP
TS 28.531 [8]. When the \'AllocatedNsi\' operation is received, the network
slice provisioning MnS Producer in 5GS performs charging mechanism as
specified in 3GPP TS 28.202 [28].
The NSCE server sends the allocated Network Slice information (e.g., S-NSSAI)
to the NSCE Client, after the Network Slice allocation to the VAL server is
successful.
With the above regards, the NSCE server performs the below for the Network
Slice Allocation for the VAL server.
\- Network Slice Allocation operation on behalf of VAL Server as specified in
TS 28.531 [8]
\- Delivery of the Network Slice Allocation result
\- Delivery of the allocated Network Slice Information to NSCE client
The VAL server as a Network Slice consumer makes use of the APIs provided from
NSCE server to allocate the Network Slice for the Network Slice Lifecycle
management for its service.
### 9.18.2 Procedure
#### 9.18.2.1 Network Slice Allocation in NSaaS model
This subclause depicts the procedure of the Network Slice Allocation in NSaaS
model, when the VAL server needs to allocate the Network Slice, interaction
with 5GS via the NSCE server.
Figure 9.18.2.1-1: Network Slice Allocation in NSaaS model
1\. The VAL server makes a request to order the Network Slice. The VAL server
specifies the Network Slice requirements for the VAL service. The Network
Slice requirement at the VAL server may be specified with the attributes of
GST (which results in NEST) as specified in GSMA NG.116.
2\. The VAL server requests the Network Slice allocation with the Network
Slice requirements. The Network Slice allocation request includes the VAL
Service ID, VAL UE\'s ID List, and S-NSSAI.
3\. The NSCE server performs the Network Slice Allocation. If the NSCE server
act as NSaaS provider, and the existing allocated network slice could
satisfied the Network Slice requirements, the NSCE server allocates the
existing network slice to the VAL. Otherwise, the NSCE server as network slice
provisioning MnS consumer requests of \'AllocacatedNsi\' operation as
specified in 3GPP TS 28.531 [8].
When the \'AllocatedNsi\' operation is received, the network slice
provisioning MnS Producer performs charging mechanism as specified in 3GPP TS
28.202 [28].
The NSCE server performs AF-driven guidance for URSP determination to 5GS per
VAL UE.
NOTE 1: According to the network operator policy, the NSCE server acting as AF
may send the created network slice information to the PCF via NEF as part of
the AF-driven guidance for URSP determination to 5G system (as specified in TS
23.501 [16]). This guidance may create the new route selection parameters to
indicate sets of PDU Session information (DNN, S-NSSAI) that can be associated
with applications matching the application traffic.
4\. The NSCE server sends the result of Network Slice Allocation to the VAL
server.
5\. The NSCE server delivers the Network Slice Allocation Information to the
NSCE Clients of VAL UEs based on the VAL UE\'s ID list from step 2, using the
procedure defined in 9.17.2.2 step 2 -- step 4, in case the Network Slice
Allocation is successful, if the NSCE server does not perform AF-driven
guidance for URSP determination to 5GS in step 3. The Network Slice Allocation
Information contains the VAL service ID, S-NSSAI, and DNN.
NOTE 2: If the UE is provisioned with URSP rules by the network operator, the
UE handles the precedence between the delivered network slice info via NSCE
layer info and URSP rules as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.503
[17]. How the UE uses the Network Slice info delivered via NSCE layer in
relation to the URSP is implementation dependent.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Deployment models
# A.1 Deployment scenarios
## A.1.1 General
Based on the network slicing capability of the S-NSSAI granularity provided by
SA2 and the network slicing capability of the NSI/S-NSSAI granularity provided
by SA5, the NSCE service is provides network slicing management and control
capabilities in the S-NSSAI granularity for vertical industries.
A network slice can have only one owner and one NSCE service provider. NSCE
service provider and slice owner can be different. For example the slice owner
is VAL server, but the NSCE service provider is MNO.
This clause describes examples of deployment models with respect to different
deployment scenarios as follows.
## A.1.2 Centralized NSCE deployment
Figure A.1.2 provides a example of centralized deployment of NSCE server whose
service area covering the whole PLMN. It is also possible slice coverage area
to be smaller than the NSCE service area.
The network slice capability enablement service is provided with the view of
whole PLMN in this scenario.
Figure A.1.2: Illustration of centralized NSCE deployment
## A.1.3 Distributed NSCE deployment
The distributed deployment refers to the deployment model in which multiple
NSCE servers are deployed by same provider, whose service area only covers
some specific areas as shown below (based on geographical coordinates or TA
list(s)).
Figure A.1.3: Illustration of distributed NSCE deployment
When there are multiple NSCE servers managed by same provider, NSCE server(s)
can be subscribed for providing the network slice statistics to another NSCE
server to provide a global view.
There can be two use cases to provide the NSCE service in the distributed
deployment:
One use case is that the distributed deployed NSCE is about a slice service
area which is equivalent to the edge/NPN's service area. For this scenario, if
the distributed deployed NSCE wants to access the NEF/NWDAF/NSACF services or
to receive policies from OAM, it needs to interact to the global NSCE.
A further use case could be that some NSCE services (e.g. MnS discovery) are
locally provided to VAL servers (for example as a micro-service), whereas
other capabilities are provided for the whole PLMN area. So, the distributed
NSCE includes a subset of capabilities which are edge native. The local
deployment of such capabilities can allow for more efficient services to the
VAL servers (e.g. for QoS verification, the edge deployed NSCE can receive
more timely KQI/QoE measurements and can process them locally before
triggering an event).
## A.1.4 NPN NSCE deployment
The NSCE architecture supports the deployment that NSCE server is deployed in
NPN.
Figure A.1.4 shows a deployment example of NSCE server deployment in the NPN.
This case is valid if a geographical match between slice coverage area, NPN
coverage area and NSCE service area is pre-configured. The matching may be
pre-configured in the NSCE server by network operator based on the TA list or
geographical coordinates. The NSCE server is deployed in Non-public network to
provide the network slice capabilities exposure application service based on
the interaction with NPN-5GC and NPN management system.

## A.1.5 Edge NSCE deployment
The NSCE architecture supports the depolyment that the NSCE server is deployed
in EDN as an EAS to provide the network slice capabilities exposure
application service, based on the interaction with 5GS pertaining the network
slice, and edge computing management system.
Figure A.1.5 shows the edge NSCE deployment cases when the NSCE server is
deployed in the EDN using LADNs as described in Annex A.2.4 of TS 23.558 [22].
This case is valid if a geographical match between slice coverage area, LADN
service area (which is EDN service area) and NSCE service area is pre-
configured in the NSCE server. The matching can based on the TA list or
geographical coordinates.

# A.2 Deployment of NSCE server(s) in relation to VAL server and 3GPP system
To support the centralized/distributed deployment, the NSCE server(s) will
have different deployment models and different relation with VAL server and
3GPP system.
## A.2.1 Centralized NSCE deployment
The NSCE server can be deployed in single PLMN operator domain (as a SEAL
server as specified in Figure 8.2.1-1 TS 23.434), deployed in VAL service
provider domain by vertical (as a SEAL server as specified in Figure 8.2.2-1
TS 23.434), or deployed outside of both the VAL service provider domain and
PLMN operator domain i.e. in 3^rd^ party domain (as a SEAL server as specified
in Figure 8.2.3-1 TS 23.434).
The deployment of NSCE server(s), with connections to 3GPP network systems in
multiple PLMN operator domains (as a SEAL server as specified in Figure
8.2.2-2) is also supported. When the vertical consumer wants to get NSCE
services in two countries which are operated by two different MNOs, the NSCE
service provider has to interact with two 3GPP network systems. The NSCE
server is either deployed in the VAL service provider domain or deployed
separately in the 3^rd^ party domain.
## A.2.2 Distributed NSCE deployment
The NSCE servers can be distributed in multiple PLMN domains (as a SEAL server
as specified in TS 23.434 Figure 8.2.1-2, Figure 8.2.1-3), or distributed in
single PLMN operator domain (as a SEAL server as specified in TS 23.434 Figure
8.2.1-4). The NSCE servers can also distributed in VAL service provider domain
by vertical (as a SEAL server as specified in TS 23.434 Figure 8.2.2-3), or
distributed deployed in 3^rd^ party domain by 3^rd^ party. The VAL server can
communicate with multiple NSCE servers via NSCE-S as long as other NSCE
servers are discovered and accessible. Or, the VAL server can communicate with
other NSCE servers via NSCE-E if needed.
# A.3 Deployment of NSCE server(s) in relation to SEAL
The NSCE server(s) supports standalone deployment independent with other SEAL
services, it can interact with other SEAL service(s) via SEAL-X interface as
specified in Clause 6.2 TS 23.434, .
The NSCE service(s) supports combined deployment with other SEAL services, it
can interact with other SEAL service via service API as specified in clause 15
TS 23.434.
