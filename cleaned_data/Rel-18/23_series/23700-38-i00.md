# 4 Scenarios
## 4.1 General
3GPP TR 22.881 [3] identified some use cases under which the administrative
configurations exchange between interconnected MC systems (2 or more MC
systems) would typically take place. This will help to identify and specify
the solutions aspects in this study, in order to serve these use cases
properly.
## 4.2 Relationship between MC systems
Figure 4.2-1 describes the relationship between the interconnected MC systems
involved in exchanging the administrative configurations.
Figure 4.2-1: Relationship between interconnected MC systems
An authorized user can trigger the exchange of administrative configurations
or/and information with one or more interconnected partner MC system at the
same time, which should be regulated through the service agreements with the
partner MC systems. The interconnected partner MC systems shall have service
agreements to the primary MC system, this is mandatory for this setup. The MC
partner systems could potentially have service agreement between them, but
this is not relevant for this study.
Processing the configuration data might require the involvement of an
authorized user (manually or automatically), who can decide whether to accept,
modify or reject the configuration data.
# 5 Key issues
## 5.1 Key issue 1: functional architecture
The support of sharing administrative configurations mechanism in MC service
Systems would imply the need to provide new functions and/or sub-functions to
the existing MC functional architecture. Defining the overall architecture
would help to enhance and develop proper mechanisms, information flows and
procedures.
This key issue will:
\- Identify the functional architecture enhancements to support this
mechanism,
\- Describe the details of the single elements from that enhanced
architecture.
## 5.2 Key issue 2 -- Identification
Performing an ACMX transaction requires to identify the authorized users
managing the ACMX in the primary and the partner MC systems, as well as the MC
service user(s), i.e. the users require configuration data for migration
and/or interconnection.
List of key issues:
\- Investigate and clarify, how the authorized users in the primary and the
partner MC system are identified, as well the MC service user(s), which are
subject of configuration and information exchange between interconnected MC
systems.
\- Identify the impact on existing solutions.
## 5.3 Key issue 3 -- Change user configuration
Migration of MC service users between MC systems may require that their user
configuration data to be used in the target partner MC system has been settled
prior to attempting requesting MC service there.
List of key issues:
\- Investigate and define how to negotiate and agree user profiles (user
configuration data) that enable the owner to migrate into a partner MC system.
\- Investigate and define methods or mechanisms how an authorised MC service
user can request changes for MC service user configuration data in a partner
MC system.
## 5.4 Key issue 4 -- Group configuration data
The exchange of administrative group configuration data between interconnected
MC systems, i.e. between a primary MC system and one or more partner MC
systems needs specifying.
Solutions are required that enable the exchange of administrative group
configuration data between interconnected MC systems.
List of key issues:
\- Investigate and develop solutions, if required, which enable the exchange
of administrative group configuration data between interconnected MC systems,
which are not yet currently available.
\- Investigate and develop solutions, if required, which enable requesting
changes, such as adding or deleting group configuration data for MC service
users located in one or more partner MC systems.
Investigate and develop solutions, if required, which enable the
exchange/request of information relating to group configuration for MC service
users located in one or more partner MC systems.
## 5.5 Key issue 5 -- Service configuration data
The exchange of administrative service configuration data between
interconnected MC systems, i.e. between a primary MC system and one or more
partner MC systems needs specifying.
Solutions are required that enable the exchange of administrative service
configuration data between interconnected MC systems.
List of key issues:
\- Investigate and develop solutions, if required, which enable the exchange
of administrative service configuration data between interconnected MC
systems, which are not yet currently available.
\- Investigate and develop solutions, if required, which enable requesting
changes, such as adding or deleting service configuration data for MC service
users located in one or more partner MC systems.
\- Investigate and develop solutions, if required, which enable the
exchange/request of information relating to service configuration for MC
service users located in one or more partner MC systems.
## 5.6 Key issue 6: authorization
For sharing administrative configurations, an authorized user in the primary
MC system should be enabled to use this service; where this user should have
the corresponding/sufficient access rights to perform the required actions to
serve a certain use case.
For providing different access permissions to different authorized users, some
access control components could be used to determine the level of
authorization of each user. In addition, access control components could help
to manage requests and information exchange and to track the access activities
for user(s) to ensure their accountability for the performed actions under
different circumstances.
The involved MC systems operate independently, using control entities for
connecting and exchanging the administrative data, where these control
entities manage the parameters exchange at their own MC system
entities/servers.
This key issue will:
\- Clarify how to reuse or enhance available methods to authorize an
administrator or authorized user at primary system and;
\- clarify how to authorize the exchange between MC systems.
\- Investigate whether and how the different scenarios/use cases could
influence the authorization level for that user(s).
NOTE 1: The authorized user is not a migrated MC service user in partner MC
system, and is not changing the configurations directly in partner MC system
NOTE 2: Procedures for authentication/authorization for MC service user(s) in
inter-domain and/or migrating are defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [4].
## 5.7 Key issue 7: Secure exchange and topology hiding
Administrative configurations exchange is performed between MC systems,
sharing the same security domain, or are located in different security
domains. This would imply the need to ensure a secure exchange between MC
systems, and at the same time without exposing the network topology of
involved MC systems.
This key issue will:
\- Investigate and clarify how to perform administrative configuration
exchange without compromising the integrity and security of the involved MC
systems.
\- Investigate and clarify how to perform administrative configuration
exchange without exposing the network topology of either MC systems.

##### 7.1.1.1.3 Procedure
Upon receiving an ACM request the ACM server should forward the request to the
authorized user at its MC system. Performing this process might require
considerable waiting time if the target authorized user is not logged on.
In addition, when an ACM server receives a response to a previously sent ACM
request, where the authorized user is not logged on, the ACM server should
store the response and notify the authorized user when the user logs on again.
The common procedure for pending ACM request/response is shown in figure
7.1.1.1.3-1
Pre-conditions
> \- The ACM server has received an ACM request, or a response, and has stored
> it.
>
> \- The ACM server has received an ACM request that should be validated by an
> authorized user
>
> \- The targeted ACM authorized user is currently not logged on.
Figure 7.1.1.1.3-1: Pending requests Procedure
> 1\. An authorized MC service user of the MC system logs on to the ACM
> client.
>
> 2\. The ACM server notifies the ACM client of the pending ACM data.
>
> 3\. The ACM client requests the ACM server to send the pending ACM data.
>
> 4\. The ACM server sends the stored ACM data to the ACM client.
NOTE: when this procedure referenced in other solutions, the individual ACM
request/response information flows are provided by the related procedures in
details.

## 7.3 Solution #1: Functional architecture
### 7.3.1 Solution description
#### 7.3.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue 1 defined in clause 5.1.
To allow required exchange of configuration data with a partner MC system, an
ACM server and ACM client are added to the functional model of the MC system.
This solution uses the interconnection interface and reference points as
specified in TS 23.280 [5] for the transfer of administrative configuration
information between two MC systems.
#### 7.3.1.2 Functional model
Figure 7.3.1.2-1 illustrates the generic functional model for Administrative
Configuration Management eXchange (ACMX).
Figure
An authorized user/administrator as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] in clause
8.1.2 has granted special privileges and is able to use ACMC to communicate
with the ACMS in the primary MC system to perform an administrative
configuration exchange with a partner MC system.
The ACMS controls the administrative configuration exchange with partner MC
system(s) and manages at the same time the interaction with the relevant MC
service server entities within the primary MC system.
#### 7.3.1.3 Functional entities description
The Administrative Configuration Management Server (ACMS) is an MC system
entity that provides the necessary functionalities to control and perform
required transactions to exchange administrative configurations and/or
information between partner MC system(s). ACMS has the following functions:
\- Supports requests from the ACMC that result in exchanges with the partner
MC system to share administrative configurations and information.
\- Controls, processes, validates, accepts, forwards or rejects administrative
configuration exchange based on a set of pre-defined rules and policies.
The Administrative Configuration Management Client (ACMC) is a functional
entity that acts as user client that controls and performs required
transactions of administrative configurations and/or information exchange with
an Administrative Configuration Management Server.
### 7.3.2 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a generic ACMX functional model allowing the exchange
of configuration data between MC systems. It defines for this purpose the new
entities ACM server and ACM client to be used in both primary and partner MC
systems.
## 7.4 Solution #2: Enhancement to the MC service functional architecture
### 7.4.1 Solution description
This solution builds upon what is already contained in TS 23.280 functional
model for the MC services architecture.
### 7.4.2 Functional model description
### 7.4.3 On-network functional model
Each MC service can be represented by an application plane functional model.
The functional model across MC services may be similar but is described by the
individual functional entities and reference points that belong to that MC
service. Within the application plane for an MC service there is a common set
of functions and reference points. The common set is shared across services.
This common set of functions and reference points is known as the common
services core.
Figure 7.4.3.1-1 shows the functional model for the application plane for an
MC system.
Figure 7.4.3.1-1: Functional model for application plane for an MC system
The common services core functions and reference points are described in TS
23.280. The new common services core functions and interfaces are described
below.
In the model shown in figure 7.4.3.1-1, the following apply:
> \- The administrative configuration management client is an integrated
> functional entity of the configuration management client. The administrative
> configuration management client is described below.
>
> \- The administrative configuration management server is an integrated
> functional entity of the configuration management server. The administrative
> configuration management server is described below.
### 7.4.4 Administrative configuration management client
The administrative configuration management (ACM) client functional entity
acts as the application user agent for an authorized user that is responsible
for requesting, approving, and applying configurations between a primary MC
system and partner MC system. These configurations include MC service user
profile, group management configuration, and associated system parameters. The
administrative configuration management client interacts with the
administrative configuration management server.
The administrative configuration management client functional entity is
supported by the signalling user agent and by the HTTP client functional
entities of the signalling control plane.
### 7.4.5 Administrative configuration management server
The administrative configuration management (ACM) server functional entity
provides the temporary storage of configuration changes when requests are
received from a partner MC system. These configuration changes include MC
service user profile, group management configuration, and associated system
parameters. The administrative configuration management server validates
requests from the administrative configuration management (ACM) client. The
ACM client in the partner system is responsible for applying any changes in
the MC system once the configurations changes have been validated and
approved.
The administrative configuration management server functional entity is
supported by the SIP AS and by the HTTP server functional entities of the
signalling control plane.
### 7.4.6 Administrative configuration management server and client in a
primary MC system and partner MC system
The diagram in Figure 7.4.6-1-1 shows how an administrative configuration
management client in the primary MC system communicates with and
administrative configuration management client in a partner MC system.
Figure 7.4.6.1-1: Administrative configuration management between a primary
and partner MC system
### 7.4.7 Solution evaluation
This solution provides an enhancement to the existing functional architecture
to allow for the administrative configuration exchange between interconnected
MC systems by re-using existing communications constructs for interfaces and
functional entities.
## 7.5 Solution #3: ACMC authorisation
### 7.5.1 Solution description
#### 7.5.1.1 Overview
This solution addresses key issue 6 defined in clause 5.6. It describes the
general authorisation concept, triggered by an authorised user via ACMC to
enable performing administrative configuration management exchange (ACMX) with
partner MC system(s).
An authorised user (i.e. administrator) has the required privileges to use the
ACM client to communicate with the primary ACM server for performing an ACMX
with a partner MC system(s). The ACM server is in charge of control, process,
validate, accept, forward or reject administrative configuration exchange
based on a set of pre-defined rules and policies. The primary and the partner
ACM servers authorise the exchange between their MC systems.
NOTE: Security aspects including specification of the authorisation procedures
are to be decided in SA3.
#### 7.5.1.1a User profile configurations for using ACMX
Table 7.5.1.1a-1 describes the necessary ACM configuration data in the MC
service user profile to enable an authorised user to perform ACM transactions
with a partner MC system. Configuration and download of the MC service user
profile data, which is used by the ACM client and the ACM server, is defined
in TS 23.280[5].

Figure 7.5.1.2-1: ACMX authorisation for an authorised user (ACMC)
Procedure:
1\. The ACMC of an authorised user requires authorisation from primary ACMS,
prior to any exchange with the partner MC system.
NOTE 2: The ACM server will check whether the user of the ACM client is
authorised at each transaction.
2\. Upon successful authorisation check, the ACMC can start the ACMX session,
3\. The partner ACMS verifies the received ACMX requests to decide whether to
continue the process.
### 7.5.2 Solution evaluation
This solution provides the authorisation mechanism to control and to enable an
authorised user to perform administrative configurations exchange with one or
more MC partner systems. The authorisation check of an ACMC is performed by
the primary ACMS for each transaction. The primary ACMS is responsible to
perform the exchange with the ACMS in the partner MC system.
## 7.6 Solution #4: Group configuration change
### 7.6.1 Solution description
#### 7.6.1.1 General
This solution addresses the following aspects:
\- Key issue 4 - change group configuration
\- The second precondition in 3GPP TS 23.280, clause 10.2.7.2:
\- One or more MC service group members are defined in the partner MC system.
#### 7.6.1.2 Procedure
##### 7.6.1.2.1 Group membership update by authorized user from a partner MC
system
The procedure for an authorized MC service user in a partner MC system to
request the primary MC system of the MC service group to modify group
membership to an interconnection group is shown in figure 7.6.1.2.1-1.
Pre-conditions
\- MC system A and MC system B are interconnected
\- MC system A and MC system B have implemented an ACMS
\- MC system B is the primary MC system of an interconnection group
\- The authorized MC service user of MC system A (the partner MC system) wants
to modify the membership of MC users of system A in the interconnection group
for which MC system B is the primary MC system.
\- When a functional alias is used as the target of the request by an ACM
client in the MC system A, it is required that the ACM server of MC system A
has subscribed to the MC service functional alias controlling server within
the MC system A, and that the ACM server of MC system B has subscribed to the
MC service functional alias controlling server within the MC system B.
Figure 7.6.1.2.1-1: Group membership update by authorized user from a partner
MC system
1\. The ACM client in MC system A sends a group membership update request to
the ACM server in MC system A, requesting to modify the membership of users
from MC system A in an interconnection group for which MC system B is the
primary MC system.
2\. The ACM server of system A checks whether the MC service user at ACM
client A is authorized for the request.
3\. The ACM server of MC system A sends the group membership update request to
the ACM server of MC system B, the primary MC system of the interconnection
group.
> 4\. The ACMS of MC system B sends a process indication to MC system A, and
> stores, verifies and assesses the incoming request.

\- if the functional alias is not currently active, the ACM server stores the
request.
5\. The ACM server of MC system B sends the stored group membership update
request to the ACM client of MC system B.
6\. The authorized MC service user of MC system B (manually) screens the
content of the group membership update request and decides to approve it or
not. The authorized user in the MC system B takes whatever actions are needed
to apply the group membership update. The actions within the MC system B to
apply this configurations are outside the scope of the 3GPP specifications.
7\. The ACM client of MC system B sends a group membership update response to
the ACM server of MC system B.
8\. The ACM server of MC system B sends the group membership update response
to the ACM server of MC system A.
9\. The ACM server of MC system A stores the group membership update response.
If the ACMC of MC system A is not logged on the ACMS of MC system A will
follow the pending request procedure as described in clause 7.1.1.
10\. The ACM server of MC system A sends the group membership update response
to the ACM client of MC system A.

#### 7.7.1.3 Procedure
The procedure for an authorized MC service user in a primary MC system to
request a partner MC system to authorize a list of MC user IDs from its MC
System to migrate to that partner MC System is shown in figure 7.7.1.3-1.
Pre-conditions
\- The primary and partner MC system(s) are configured to accept connections
from relevant ACMCs via the respective ACMSs in each of the connected MC
service system(s) and have been configured and authorized successfully to
allow exchange of administrative configuration information
\- The relevant ACMC(s) and ACMS connection authorizations have been
established successfully
\- The primary ACMC(s) have access to the MC service user database in the
primary MC system -- not shown in the procedure below for simplicity reasons
\- When a functional alias is used as the target of the request by an ACM
client in the primary MC system, it is required that the primary ACM server
has subscribed to the MC service functional alias controlling server within
the primary MC system, and that the partner ACM server has subscribed to the
MC service functional alias controlling server within the partner MC system.
Figure 7.7.1.3-1: User configuration request in partner MC system
1\. The primary ACMC sends user configuration request to the primary ACMS,
requesting to authorize a list of MC users from the primary MC System to
migrate to the partner MC System.
2\. The primary ACMS performs an authorization check to verify that the MC
service user is authorized to perform this action. A successful authorization
check results in the user configuration request being forwarded to the
relevant partner ACMS.
3\. The primary ACMS sends the user configuration request to the partner ACMS.
NOTE 1: Step 3 is not followed if the authorization was unsuccessful.

5\. The partner ACMS sends the stored user configuration request to the
partner ACMC.
6\. The authorized MC service user of partner MC system checks the content of
the user configuration request and decides whether to approve it or not. The
authorized user in the partner MC system takes whatever actions are needed to
apply the configurations. The actions within the partner MC system to apply
the configurations are outside the scope of the 3GPP specifications.
7\. The partner ACMC sends user configuration response to the partner ACMS.
8\. The partner ACMS sends user configuration response to the primary ACMS.
9\. The primary ACMS stores the user configuration response. If the primary
ACMC is not logged on the primary ACMS will follow the pending request
procedure as described in clause 7.1.1.
10\. The primary ACM S sends the user configuration response to the primary
ACMC.
### 7.7.2 Solution evaluation
This solution introduces a solution to request to add users for migration to a
partner MC system. The solution returns to the primary system the status of
the request, and all necessary information that is needed in the primary MC
system to configure the migrating users.
## 7.8 Solution #6: Request to remove users for migration from a partner MC
system
### 7.8.1 Solution description
7.8.1.1 General
This solution addresses the following aspects of Key issue 3 -- Change user
configuration.
When certain users no longer are needed for migration to a partner system,
there should be a means for an authorized user in the primary MC system to
request that certain users be removed from migration access in the partner MC
system. This maintenance activity is necessary, as once users are added for
migration, it cannot be assumed that their migration access will be
indefinite.

### 7.8.2 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a means for an authorized user in the primary MC system
to request that certain users be removed from migration access in the partner
MC system. Such a solution is needed because once users are added for
migration, it cannot be assumed that their migration access to the partner MC
system will be indefinite.

### 7.9.1 Solution description
#### 7.9.1.1 General
This solution addresses the following aspects:
\- Key issue 3 - change user configuration
\- Key issue 5 -- Service configuration data
This solution enables an authorized user to provide configuration data to a
partner MC system needed to update the initial MC service UE configuration
data to be stored in an MC service UE enabling migration to a partner MC
system. The initial MC service configuration is a pre-condition for
authentication and authorization for MC services in a partner MC system.
Initial MC service UE configuration data can be exchanged between the MC
systems using ACMX entities as described in the following procedure. This
solution allows to keep a partner MC system up to date with regard to the
required initial MC service UE configuration date needed for migration.

configuration.
#### 7.9.1.3 Procedure
The procedure for an authorized MC service user in a primary MC system to
update the partner MC system with the initial MC service UE configuration data
information is shown in figure 7.9.1.3-1.
Pre-conditions
\- The primary and partner MC system(s) are configured to accept connections
from relevant ACMCs via the respective ACMSs in each of the connected MC
service system(s) and have been configured and authorized successfully to
allow exchange of administrative configuration information
\- The relevant ACMC(s) and ACMS connection authorizations have been
established successfully
\- The set of MC service IDs and the MC service UE initial configuration of
the migrating MC service users have been already sent by the primary MC system
to the partner MC system, as specified in solution #5.
\- When a functional alias is used as the target of the request by an ACM
client in the primary MC system, it is required that the primary ACM server
has subscribed to the MC service functional alias controlling server within
the primary MC system, and that the partner ACM server has subscribed to the
MC service functional alias controlling server within the partner MC system.
Figure 7.9.1.3-1: Update MC service UE initial configuration
1\. The primary ACMC sends an update MC service UE initial configuration to
the primary ACMS, providing the initial MC service UE configuration data as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5], Annex 6 to the primary MC System.
2\. The primary ACMS performs an authorization check to verify that the MC
service user is authorized to perform this action. A successful authorization
check results in the Update MC service UE initial configuration being
forwarded to the relevant partner ACMS. If the authorization check is failed
the next steps are not followed
3\. The primary ACMS sends the update MC service UE initial configuration to
the partner ACMS.
4\. The partner ACMS processes the incoming update. Based on local policy, the
partner ACMS may automatically handle the request and send an update MC
service UE initial configuration response to the primary ACMS. Otherwise the
ACM server should request verification by an ACM client.
If the request targets a functional alias the ACM server resolves the
functional alias (based on the current state of the functional alias) and
proceeds as follows:
> \- if the functional alias is active for one ACM client, the request is sent
> to the ACM client;
>
> \- if the functional alias is active for more than one ACM client, the ACM
> server sends the request to one of these ACM clients based on the local
> policy;
>
> \- if the functional alias is not currently active, the ACM server stores
> the request.
5\. The partner ACMS may send a process pending indication to the primary MC
system.
NOTE 1: There may be a considerable pause between step 4 and 7.
6\. The partner ACMS forwards the stored update MC service UE initial
configuration to the partner ACMC.
7\. The authorized MC service user of partner MC system processes the received
update MC service UE initial configuration.
NOTE 2: It is out of the scope of this document how the received initial MC
service UE configuration data is applied to MC service UEs (before migration).

#### 7.10.1.1 General
This solution addresses the following aspects:
\- Key issue 5 -- Service configuration data
For an MC service user, when migrating and receiving MC service from a partner
MC system, it will use the user profile resulted from profile exchange between
the primary and partner MC systems as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280, clause
10.1.4.3.2. This solution enables an authorized user in primary MC system to
request changes to MC service user profile, while these user(s) are migrated
to a partner MC system.
The update of MC service user profile can be done between the MC systems using
ACMX entities as described in the following procedure.

#### 7.10.1.3 Procedure
The procedure for an authorized MC service user in a primary MC system to
request MC service user profile update from a partner MC system is shown in
figure 7.10.1.3-1.
Pre-conditions
\- The primary and partner MC system(s) are configured to accept connections
from relevant ACMCs via the respective ACMSs in each of the connected MC
service system(s) and have been configured and authorized successfully to
allow exchange of administrative configuration information
\- The relevant ACMC(s) and ACMS connection authorizations have been
established successfully
\- The authorized user at the primary MC system needs to update the MC service
user profile, for an MC service user already migrated and receiving services
in a partner MC system.
\- When a functional alias is used as the target of the request by an ACM
client in the primary MC system, it is required that the primary ACM server
has subscribed to the MC service functional alias controlling server within
the primary MC system, and that the partner ACM server has subscribed to the
MC service functional alias controlling server within the partner MC system.
Figure 7.10.1.3-1: MC service user profile update
1\. The primary ACMC sends MC service user profile update request to the
primary ACMS providing the required changes for the MC service user that is
migrated to the partner MC System.
2\. The primary ACMS performs an authorization check to verify that the MC
service user is authorized to perform this action. A successful authorization
check results in the MC user profile update request being forwarded to the
relevant partner ACMS. If the authorization was unsuccessful, step 3 is not
followed and the procedure is stopped.
3\. The primary ACMS sends the MC service user profile update request to the
partner ACMS.
> 4\. The partner ACMS sends a process indication to the primary MC system,
> and stores, verifies and assesses the incoming request.
>
> 4a. Based on local policy, the partner ACMS may automatically handle the
> request as described in clause 7.1.2 and send a response to the primary ACMS
> (i.e. perform step 8).
>
> 4b. Otherwise, the ACM server requests verification by an ACM client,
> following the pending request procedure in clause 7.1.1 if the user is not
> logged on, and steps 5, 6 and 7. If the request targets a functional alias
> the ACM server resolves the functional alias (based on the current state of
> the functional alias) and proceeds as follows:
>
> \- if the functional alias is active for one ACM client, the request is sent
> to the ACM client;
>
> \- if the functional alias is active for more than one ACM client, the ACM
> server sends the request to one of these ACM clients based on the local
> policy;
\- if the functional alias is not currently active, the ACM server stores the
request.
5\. The partner ACMS forwards the stored MC service user profile update
request to the partner ACMC.
6\. The authorized MC service user of partner MC system checks the content of
the MC service user profile update request and decides whether to approve it
or not. The authorized user in the partner MC system takes whatever actions
are needed to apply the MC service user profile update. The actions within the
partner MC system to apply this configuration are outside the scope of the
3GPP specifications.
7\. The partner ACMC sends MC service user profile update response to the
partner ACMS.
8\. The partner ACMS sends MC service user profile update response to the
primary ACMS.
9\. The primary ACMS stores the MC service user profile update response. If
the primary ACMC is not logged on the primary ACMS will follow the pending
request procedure as described in clause 7.1.1.
10\. The primary ACMS forwards the MC service user profile update response to
the primary ACMC.
### 7.10.2 Solution evaluation
This solution enables an authorized user in the primary MC system to request
an update to the MC service user profile while the MC user is migrated and
served by the partner MC system. This solution addresses key issue 5.
## 7.11 Solution #9: Provide Interconnection Group IDs
### 7.11.1 Solution description
#### 7.11.1.1 General
This solution addresses the following aspects:
\- Key issue 4 -- Group configuration data
"The MC service group is configured in the MC service user profiles ... "
This solutions enables an authorized user to provide a list of interconnection
group ID(s) to a selected authorized user of a partner MC system.
#### 7.11.1.2 Information flows
##### 7.11.1.2.1 Group information provision request
Table 7.11.1.2.1-1 describes the information flow of the Group information
provision request sent from the primary ACMC to the partner ACMS(s) and
partner ACMC(s).
