# Introduction
This document specifies a functional architecture for service enabler
architecture layer (SEAL) over 3GPP networks to support vertical applications
(e.g. V2X applications). This functional architecture will include common
application plane and signalling plane entities. A set of common services
(e.g. group management, configuration management, location management)
specified in this document can be shared across vertical applications.
The SEAL functional architecture takes into consideration the common
capabilities to support mission critical and other vertical applications.
# 1 Scope

operator\'s own SIP database or the VAL service provider\'s SIP database, and
optionally using the PLMN operator\'s internal information e.g. network
topology, registrar availability.
1) Registrar finder and registrar in the VAL service provider domain:
registrar finder in the VAL service provider\'s domain uses the information
from the VAL service provider\'s SIP database to identify the serving
registrar in the VAL service provider domain.
2) Registrar finder and registrar in the PLMN operator domain: registrar
finder uses information from PLMN operator\'s SIP database to identify the
serving registrar in the PLMN operator domain.
3) Registrar finder in PLMN operator domain and registrar in VAL service
provider domain: registrar finder uses information from the VAL service
provider\'s SIP database to identify the serving registrar in the VAL service
provider domain.
NOTE 1: The need for the registrar finder is deployment specific e.g. a
deployment that has only one registrar does not need the registrar finder and
the related SIP database information.
b) Providing discovery and address resolution, including E.164 numbers.
NOTE 2: In the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the I-CSCF as defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [15].
###### 6.4.3.1.3.4 Registrar / application service selection
The registrar / application service selection functional entity provides the
following functions:
\- Registrar function (with integral provision of a location server) and also
acts as an inbound proxy (with access to the integral location server), and
outbound proxy for all SIP transactions where application service selection is
required. It registers the user and maintains the association of the location
and identity of the user in a location service. It provides notifications of
the registration states.
\- Supports authentication for identities provided within SIP signalling. Both
the registrar (with integral location server) and authentication functions are
supported by access either to the public network\'s own SIP database or the
VAL service provider\'s SIP database.
\- Can provide the application service selection for all SIP transactions,
possibly based on application service selection information stored by either
the public network\'s own SIP database or the VAL service provider\'s SIP
database.
\- Performs SIP signalling security.
NOTE: In the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the S-CSCF as defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [15].
##### 6.4.3.1.4 Diameter proxy
This functional entity acts as a proxy agent for Diameter messaging as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [24].
The Diameter proxy, when used on the AAA-2 interface, is collocated with the
migration management server.
Other instances of the Diameter proxy may also be present in the SIP core /
IMS.
NOTE: The number of instances of the Diameter proxy is deployment specific.
#### 6.4.3.2 SIP database
##### 6.4.3.2.1 General
The SIP database contains information concerning the SIP subscriptions and
corresponding identity and authentication information required by the SIP
core, and such information as application service selection.
In deployment scenarios where the PLMN operator provides the SIP core, this
database is provided by the HSS.
In deployment scenarios where the VAL service provider provides the SIP core,
the SIP database may be provided by the VAL service provider.
Access to the data residing in the SIP database is restricted to the SIP core
entities that are specifically serving the subscriber/user whose data are
stored, i.e. registrars and registrar finders can access SIP databases only
when they are part of the same trust domain for the data being provided.
NOTE: The SIP database can be in a different network than the registrar finder
since the trust domain for the criteria for registrar selection can be
different than the trust domain for the signalling plane user identities.
The SIP database is responsible for storing the following user related
information:
\- signalling plane user identities: Numbering and addressing information;
\- signalling plane security information: SIP core access control information
for authentication and authorization;
\- VAL UE Location information at inter-system level: the SIP database
supports the user registration, and stores inter-system location information,
etc.; and
\- signalling plane subscription profile (including initial filter criteria).
The SIP database also generates signalling plane security information for
mutual authentication, communication integrity check and ciphering.
Based on this information, the SIP database is also responsible to support the
call control and session management entities of the SIP core.
The SIP database consists of the following functionalities:
\- support for control functions of the SIP core such as the Registrar and
Registrar finder. This is needed to enable subscriber usage of the SIP core
services. This functionality is independent of the access network used to
access the SIP core; and
\- authentication functionality required by the SIP core to authenticate the
VAL UE.
##### 6.4.3.2.2 SIP database logical functions
The SIP database provides the following logical functions:
a) mobility management;
\- provides the UE mobility through the SIP core.
b) registrar assignment support;
\- provides to the registrar finder the required capabilities for VAL services
based on VAL service provider requirements on a per-user basis, (e.g. whether
a particular registrar within the PLMN operator\'s network (e.g. a registrar
reserved for VAL service use or a registrar in a secure location) or a
registrar within the VAL service provider network is assigned.
c) call and/or session establishment support;
\- provides the call and/or session establishment procedures in the SIP core.
For terminating traffic, it provides information on which registrar currently
hosts the user.
d) user security information generation;
\- provides generation of user authentication, integrity and ciphering data
for the SIP core.
e) signalling plane security support;
\- provides authentication procedures to access VAL services by storing the
generated data for authentication, integrity and ciphering at the signalling
plane and by providing these data to the appropriate registrar.
f) user identification handling;
\- provides the appropriate relations among all the identifiers uniquely
determining the signalling plane identities in the SIP core e.g. IMS public
identities.
g) access authorisation; and
\- provides authorisation of the user for mobile access when requested by the
registrar e.g. by checking that the user is allowed to roam to that visited
network.
h) service authorisation support.
\- provides basic authorisation for terminating call/session establishment and
service invocation. The SIP database may update the registrar with filter
criteria to trigger the VAL server(s).
#### 6.4.3.3 HTTP entities
##### 6.4.3.3.1 HTTP client
This functional entity acts as the client for all hypertext transactions.
##### 6.4.3.3.2 HTTP proxy
This functional entity acts as a proxy for hypertext transactions between the
HTTP client and one or more HTTP servers. The HTTP proxy terminates a TLS
session on HTTP-1 with the HTTP client of the VAL UE allowing the HTTP client
to establish a single TLS session for hypertext transactions with multiple
HTTP servers that are reachable by the HTTP proxy.
The HTTP proxy terminates the HTTP-3 reference point that lies between
different HTTP proxies. It may provide a topology hiding function from HTTP
entities outside the trust domain of the VAL system.
The HTTP proxy shall be in the same trust domain as the HTTP clients and HTTP
servers that are located within a VAL service provider\'s network. There can
be multiple instances of an HTTP proxy e.g. one per trust domain.
NOTE: The number of instances of the HTTP proxy is deployment specific.
##### 6.4.3.3.3 HTTP server
This functional entity acts as the HTTP server for all hypertext transactions.
#### 6.4.3.4 LWP entities
##### 6.4.3.4.1 LWP client
This functional entity acts as the light-weight protocol client for all
transactions of the SEAL client executing in a constrained UE. A SEAL client
executing in an unconstrained UE may choose to use the LWP client if it is
available.
##### 6.4.3.4.2 LWP proxy
This functional entity acts as a proxy for transactions between the LWP client
and one or more LWP servers. The LWP proxy typically terminates a secure
transport protocol (e.g. DTLS, TLS or secure WebSocket) session on LWP-1
reference point with the LWP client of the VAL UE allowing the LWP client to
establish a single secure session for transactions with multiple LWP servers
that are reachable by the LWP proxy.
The LWP proxy can act as a cross-protocol LWP-HTTP proxy to enable LWP clients
to access resources on HTTP servers via the LWP-HTTP-2 reference point.
The LWP proxy terminates LWP-3 reference point that lies between different LWP
proxies. It may provide a topology hiding function from LWP entities outside
the trust domain of the VAL system.
The LWP proxy can also terminate LWP-HTTP-3 reference point for interworking
with another HTTP proxy. In this role it provides cross-protocol mapping and
may provide a topology hiding function from HTTP entities outside the trust
domain of the VAL system.
The LWP proxy shall be in the same trust domain as the LWP clients and LWP
servers that are located within a VAL service provider\'s network. There can
be multiple instances of a LWP proxy e.g. one per trust domain.
##### 6.4.3.4.3 LWP server
This functional entity acts as the LWP server for all LWP transactions of the
SEAL server.
NOTE: A SEAL client can act as LWP server for certain transactions as required
by the SEAL service.
#### 6.4.3.5 LWP usage
LWP is a generic representation of a light-weight protocol for use in
constrained environments. Realizations of the light-weight protocol (LWP)
functional entities and reference points to a particular protocol are defined
in the annexes of this specification.
LWP is a representation of a protocol to be used by the SEAL service enablers
on their respective SEAL-UU reference points when the SEAL client is executing
in a constrained UE. In this case the SEAL client should use the LWP-1
reference point with the LWP proxy and should use either the LWP-2 or the LWP-
HTTP-2 reference point for transport and routing of the related signalling
with the SEAL server.
Editor\'s note: Which procedures of a SEAL service enabler are not necessary
to be supported for a constrained UE is FFS.
A SEAL client executing in a non-constrained UE may choose to use the LWP-1
reference point with the LWP proxy and may use either the LWP-2 or the LWP-
HTTP-2 reference point for transport and routing of the related signalling
with the SEAL server.
LWP may be used for interactions between SEAL servers on their respective
SEAL-E reference points. For this usage the SEAL-E reference point shall use
the LWP-1 and either the LWP-2 or the LWP-3 reference point depending on the
trust relationship between the interacting SEAL servers.

# 7 Identities
## 7.1 User identity (User ID)
The VAL user presents the user identity to the identity management server
during a user authentication transaction, to provide the identity management
client a means for VAL service authentication. In general, since identity
management is a common SEAL service, it uses a set of credentials (e.g.
biometrics, secureID, username/password) that may not necessarily be tied to a
single VAL service. The user credentials uniquely identifies the VAL user to
the identity management server.
NOTE: The specific security and authentication mechanisms required in order to
use the user ID is specified in 3GPP TS 33.434 [29].
Editor\'s note: The naming and definition of the identities in subclause 7 may
require further study (e.g. renaming user identity to VAL user identity, and
renaming VAL user identity to VAL service user identity).
## 7.2 VAL user identity (VAL user ID)
The VAL user ID is a unique identifier within the VAL service that represents
the VAL user. For example, the VAL user ID may be a URI. The VAL user ID is
used for authentication and authorization purposes for providing the VAL
service towards the VAL user via the VAL UE. The VAL user ID also indicates
the VAL service provider with whom the VAL user has a VAL service agreement.
The VAL user may have VAL service agreement with several VAL service providers
and thus will have obtained unique VAL user ID per VAL service provider. The
VAL user ID can be used to access any SEAL service.
Based on the service agreement, VAL user ID may be mapped to a VAL UE ID.
## 7.3 VAL UE identity (VAL UE ID)
The VAL UE ID is a unique identifier within the VAL service that represents
the VAL UE. For example, the VAL UE ID for V2X service is mapped to the
StationID as specified in ETSI TS 102 894-2 [25]. The VAL UE ID is used to
address the VAL UE in order to send VAL messages or to access SEAL services.
Based on the service agreement, GPSI (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [38]) may
be used as VAL UE identity.
## 7.4 VAL service identity (VAL service ID)
The VAL service ID is a unique identifier that represents the VAL service. A
VAL server provides a list of VAL services towards the VAL users or VAL UE.
Each VAL service is uniquely identified by a VAL service ID, which is an
identifier of the VAL application providing that VAL service. The VAL service
ID can be used for policy mapping, QoS handling for VAL communication and VAL
message distribution. For example, an identifier of a V2X service, e.g. ITS-
AID or PSID specified in ETSI TS 102 965 [26] and ISO TS 17419 [27], can be
used as a V2X service ID.
## 7.5 VAL group identity (VAL group ID)
The VAL group ID is a unique identifier within the VAL service that represents
a set of VAL users or VAL UE according to the VAL service. The set of VAL
users may belong to the same or different VAL service providers. It indicates
the VAL application server where the group is defined.
## 7.6 VAL system identity (VAL system ID)
The VAL system ID is a globally unique identifier representing a VAL system.
## 7.7 VAL Stream ID
> **A VAL Stream ID is an identity used by the VAL server to identify a VAL
> stream.**

# 9 Location management
## 9.1 General
The location management is a SEAL service that offers the location management
related capabilities to one or more vertical applications.
## 9.2 Functional model for location management
### 9.2.1 General
The functional model for the location management is based on the generic
functional model specified in clause 6. It is organized into functional
entities to describe a functional architecture which addresses the support for
location management aspects for vertical applications. The on-network and off-
network functional model is specified in this clause.
### 9.2.2 On-network functional model description
Figure 9.2.2-1 illustrates the generic on-network functional model for
location management.
Figure 9.2.2-1: On-network functional model for location management
The location management client communicates with the location management
server over the LM-UU reference point. The location management client provides
the support for location management functions to the VAL client(s) over LM‑C
reference point. The VAL server(s) communicate with the location management
server over the LM-S reference point. The VAL client communicates with the VAL
server over the VAL-UU reference point which is outside the scope of this
document.
The location management server communicates with the SCEF via T8 reference
point to obtain location information from the underlying 3GPP network system.
The location management server obtains location information from the NEF via
N33 reference point by mechanism defined in clause 5.2.6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502
[11]. The location management server may obtain location information from the
GMLC via Le reference point defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 23.273 [50].
The location management server may optionally obtains location information
from the 3rd party location server via LM-3P reference point.
When the fused location function is present, the location management server,
may use the location information from multiple sources to determine a more
accurate UE location. The fused location function may select one or more
location sources and location methods based on the requested location QoS
which obtained from the location management server.
NOTE 1: Location information from LCS of 4G system is not exposed by SCEF.
NOTE 2: Non-3GPP access used by the UE is out of scope of the present
document.
Figure 9.2.2-2 exhibits the service-based interfaces for providing and
consuming location management services. The location management server could
provide service to VAL server and location management client through interface
Slm.

services from the Core Network (5GC, EPC) northbound API entities like SCEF,
NEF, SCEF+NEF which act as API Exposing Function as specified in 3GPP TS
23.222 [6].
### 9.2.3 Off-network functional model description

#### 9.2.4.1 General
The functional entities for location management SEAL service are described in
the following subclauses.
#### 9.2.4.2 Location management client
The location management client functional entity acts as the application
client for location management functions. It interacts with the location
management server and may provide UE-based positioning and location-related
information. The location management client also supports interactions with
the corresponding location management client between the two UEs.
#### 9.2.4.3 Location management server
The location management server is a functional entity that receives and stores
user location information and provides user location information to the
vertical application server. The location management server may also acquire
location information provided by PLMN operator via T8, N33, or Le reference
points _._ The location management service may optionally obtain location
information from 3^rd^ party location servers via LM-3P reference point. The
LM-3P reference point is out of scope of this specification _._
The location management server acts as CAPIF\'s API exposing function as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8]. The location management server also supports
interactions with the corresponding location management server in distributed
SEAL deployments. The location management server, with the fused location
function, may combine/aggregate location information from multiple sources to
provide a more accurate UE location.
NOTE: The accuracy of location information acquired from 4G system via T8
reference point is not higher than cell level (ECGI) for E-UTRAN.

### 9.3.3 Event-triggered location reporting procedure
#### 9.3.3.1 General
The location management server provides location reporting configuration to
the location management clients, indicating what information the location
management server expects and what events will trigger the sending of this
information to the location management server. The decision to report location
information can be triggered at the location management client by different
conditions, e.g., the reception of the location reporting configuration,
initial registration, distance travelled, elapsed time, cell change, MBMS SAI
change, MBMS session change, leaving a specific MBMS bearer service area,
tracking area change, PLMN change, call initiation, or other types of events
such as emergency. The location report can include information described as
ECGI, MBMS SAIs, geographic coordinates and other location information.
#### 9.3.3.2 Fetching location reporting configuration
Figure 9.3.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for fetching location reporting
configuration.
Pre-condition:
\- If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is activated
by the location management server.
\- The location management client is aware that the location reporting
configuration is available at the location management server.
Figure 9.3.3.2-1: Fetching location reporting configuration procedure
1\. The location management client sends location reporting configuration
request message to the location management server.
2\. The location management server sends location reporting configuration
message to the location management client(s) containing the initial location
reporting event triggers configuration (or a subsequent update) , e.g. minimum
time between consecutive reports, SAI changes, access RAT changes, or ECGI
changes for reporting the location of the VAL UE. This message can be sent
over a unicast bearer to a specific location management client or as a group
message over an MBMS bearer to update the location reporting configuration for
multiple location management clients at the same time.
NOTE 1: The location reporting configuration information can be made part of
the user profile, in which case the sending of the message is not necessary.
NOTE 2: Different location management clients may be given different location
reporting criteria.
3\. The location management client stores or updates the location reporting
event triggers configuration. A location reporting event occurs, triggering
step 3.
#### 9.3.3.3 Location reporting
Figure 9.3.3.3-1 illustrates the procedure for location reporting.
Figure 9.3.3.3-1: Location reporting procedure
1\. The location management client sends a location information report to the
location management server, containing location information identified by the
location management server and available to the location management client.
2\. Upon receiving the report, the location management server updates location
of the reporting location management client. If the location management server
does not have location information of the reporting location management client
before, then just stores the reporting location information for that location
management client.
#### 9.3.3.4 Update Location reporting configuration
The location management server may update the location reporting configuration
information and inform the location management client of the update ones at
any time by triggering the location reporting configuration update procedure.
Figure 9.3.3.4-1 illustrates the procedure for location reporting
configuration update.
Figure 9.3.3.4-1: Location reporting configuration update procedure
1\. Based on the local configurations or the location information request from
other entities (e.g., another location management client, VAL server) or if
the VAL server updates the geographical location information of the existing
VAL service area ID and there is triggering criteria corresponding to the
updated VAL service area ID, the location management server decides to update
the location reporting configuration and informs the updated information to
the location management client.
2\. The location management server sends location reporting configuration
update request message to the location management client(s) which may contain
the updated location reporting configuration, e.g. the event triggers, the
minimum time between consecutive reports, the requested location access type
and positioning methods when VAL UE fetches the UE location report. This
message can be sent over a unicast bearer to a specific location management
client or as a group message over an MBMS bearer to update the location
reporting configuration for multiple location management clients at the same
time. If the location reporting trigger from VAL server contains the
triggering criteria based on the VAL service area ID, then the location
management server converts those triggers into geographical area based
triggers while sending it to the location management client.
NOTE: Different location management clients may be given different location
reporting criteria.
3\. The location management client(s) reply with location reporting
configuration update response to the location management server with the
update result.
4\. The location management client stores or updates the new location
reporting configuration received in step 2.
### 9.3.4 On-demand location reporting procedure
The location management server can request UE location information at any time
by sending a location information request to the location management client,
which may trigger location management client to immediately send the location
report.
Figure 9.3.4-1: On-demand location information reporting procedure
1\. Based on configurations such as periodical location information timer, or
location information request from other entities (e.g., another location
management client, VAL server), location management server initiates the
immediately request location information from the location management client.
2\. The location management server sends a location information request to the
location management client.
3\. VAL user or VAL UE is notified and asked about the permission to share its
location. VAL user can accept or deny the request
4\. The location management client immediately responds to the location
management server with a report containing location information identified by
the location management server and available to the location management
client.
5\. Upon receiving the report, the location management server updates location
of the reporting location management client. If the location management server
does not have location information of the reporting location management client
before, then just stores the reporting location information for that location
management client.
### 9.3.5 Client-triggered or VAL server-triggered location reporting
procedure
Figure 9.3.5-1 illustrates the high level procedure of client-triggered or VAL
server-triggered location reporting.
Figure 9.3.5-1: Client-triggered location reporting procedure
1\. Location management client 2 (authorized VAL user or VAL UE) or VAL server
sends a location reporting trigger to the location management server to
activate a location reporting procedure for obtaining the location information
of location management client 1. The location reporting event triggers e.g.
minimum time between consecutive reports, SAI changes, access RAT changes, or
ECGI changes for reporting the location of the VAL UE, are included.
NOTE: Step 1 can be performed when Location management client 2 or VAL server
require to update the location reporting trigger.
2\. Location management server checks whether location management client 2 or
VAL server is authorized to send a location reporting trigger. Depending on
the information specified by the location reporting trigger, location
management server initiates an on-demand location reporting procedure or an
event-triggered location reporting procedure for the location of location
management client 1.
3\. Once the location information of the location management client 1 is
available in the location management server by the on-demand location
reporting procedure, a location information report is sent to the location
management client 2 or VAL server.
### 9.3.6 Location reporting triggers configuration cancel
Figure 9.3.6-1 illustrates the procedure used for cancelling the location
reporting triggers configuration at the target Location management client.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The location management server has subscribed the location management
client 2 location with the location reporting event triggers.
2\. If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is
activated by the location management server.
Figure 9.3.6-1: Location reporting triggers configuration cancel
1\. The location management client 1 (authorized VAL user or VAL UE) or VAL
server sends a location reporting configuration cancel request to the location
management server (1a). The location management server sends the location
reporting configuration cancel request to the location management client 2 to
stop receiving the UE location information (1b). This message can be sent via
unicast or multicast.
NOTE: Step 1b can be initiated without step 1a.
2\. The location management client invalidates the location reporting triggers
configuration and no longer reports its location to the location management
server.
3\. The location management client 2 sends the location reporting
configuration cancel response to the location management server (3a) as an
acknowledgement. The location management server sends the location reporting
configuration cancel response to the location management client 1 (3b) as an
acknowledgement.
### 9.3.7 Location information subscription procedure
Figure 9.3.7-1 illustrates the high level procedure of location information
subscription request. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to VAL user
or VAL UE location information. This procedure is also used for initiating
tracking a UE\'s location.
Figure 9.3.7-1: Location information subscription request procedure
1\. The VAL server sends a location information subscription request to the
location management server to subscribe location information of one or more
VAL users or VAL UEs. The request may include an indication for supplementary
location information and the location QoS which contains the location
accuracy, response Time and QoS class as defined in clause 4.1b of TS 23.273
[50].
2\. The location management server shall check if the VAL server is authorized
to initiate the location information subscription request and may retrieve the
available and proper location access type and positioning methods (e.g. as
described in TS 23.273 [50] and TS 29.572 [51]) for the target VAL UE based on
the received location QoS. Further, the location management server may
initiate location reporting configuration optionally including the retrieved
location access type and positioning methods with the location management
client of the UE for immediate reporting.
3\. The location management server may optionally subscribe for UE location
information from 3GPP core network for the UE. If the indication for
supplementary location information is included in step 1, then UE location
information is obtained from the 3GPP core network and/or the 3rd party
location management server.
NOTE: How the location management server obtains the UE location from the
3^rd^ party location management server is out of scope of this specification.
4\. The location management server determines the UE location information of
the UE as received in steps 2 and 3 and checks if it meets the location QoS
requirements (if any) or not.
5\. The location management server replies with a location information
subscription response indicating the subscription status and if immediate
reporting was requested, the location information of the VAL UE(s).
### 9.3.8 Event-trigger location information notification procedure
Figure 9.3.8-1 illustrates the high level procedure of event-trigger usage of
location information. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to location
information of VAL user or VAL UE. This procedure is also used for obtaining
latest UE\'s location for tracking purpose.
Figure 9.3.8-1: Event-trigger usage of location information procedure
1\. The location management server receives the latest location information of
the UE as per the location report procedure described in clause 9.3.3.3.
2\. The location management server may optionally receive the location
information of the UE from 3GPP core and/or the 3rd party location management
server network. If the indication for supplementary location information is
included in the subscription, then UE location information is obtained from
the 3GPP core network and/or the 3rd party location management server.
3\. Based on the configurations, e.g., subscription, periodical location
information timer, location management server is triggered to report the
latest user location information to VAL server. The location management server
determines the location information of UE as received in steps 1 and 2,
including the supplementary location information (if indicated). The Location
management server may report the location to the VAL server considering the
location information received via non-3GPP positioning technologies (e.g.
GNSS, Bluetooth), for instance, to improve the location accuracy.
4\. The location management server sends the location information report
including the latest location information of one or more VAL users or VAL UEs
to the VAL server or to the location management client that has previously
configured.
5\. VAL server may further share this location information to a group or to
another VAL user or VAL UE.
NOTE: For other entities, the step 5 can be skipped if not needed.
### 9.3.9 On-demand usage of location information procedure
The VAL server can request UE location information at any time by sending a
location information request to the location management server, which may
trigger location management server to immediately send the location report.
Figure 9.3.9-1 illustrates the high level procedure of on demand usage of
location information. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to location
information of VAL user or VAL UE.
Figure 9.3.9-1: On-demand usage of location information procedure
1\. VAL server sends a location information request to the location management
server which may include the location QoS that contains the location accuracy,
response Time and QoS class as defined in clause 4.1b of TS 23.273 [50].
2\. The location management server acquires the latest location of the UEs
being requested, by triggering an on-demand location report procedure as
described in subclause 9.3.4, or from PLMN operator, and checks if the
obtained location of the VAL UE could meet the location QoS requirements (if
any).
3\. Then, location management server immediately sends the location
information report including the latest location information acquired of one
or more VAL users or VAL UEs. The Location management server may report the
location to the VAL server considering the location information received via
non-3GPP positioning technologies (e.g. GNSS, Bluetooth), for instance, to
improve the location accuracy.
4\. VAL server may further share this location information to a group or to
another VAL user or VAL UE.
NOTE: For other entities, the step 4 can be skipped if not needed.
### 9.3.10 Obtaining UE(s) information at a location
Figure 9.3.10-1 describes the procedure for obtaining UE(s) information at a
location.
Pre-condition:
\- The VAL server has a jurisdiction over a geographical area for which the
location management server is configured to operate.
\- The UE(s) in the geographical area have provided its location information
to the location management server.
Figure 9.3.10-1: Obtaining UE(s) information at a location
1\. The VAL server sends get UE information request to the location management
server. The request contains a location information or VAL service area
identified by the VAL service area ID and application defined proximity range.
2\. The location management server determines the UE(s) whose location are
within the application defined proximity range of the location information or
VAL service area identified by the VAL service area ID provided in step 1.
3\. The location management server sends get UE information response to the
VAL server with a list of UE(s) and its corresponding location information as
determined in step 1.
### 9.3.11 Monitoring Location Deviation
#### 9.3.11.1 General
The VAL server requests the Location Management Server to monitor the location
of the VAL UE in relation to an area of interest. The LMS fetches the VAL
UE\'s location information periodically from 3GPP core network as specified in
3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and also, using the Location Information procedures
specified in clause 9.3.7 and clause 9.3.10. With the periodic location
information of the UE from 3GPP core network and SEAL procedures, the LMS
server evaluates the current location of the VAL UE in relation to the area of
interest configured by the VAL server. If subscribed, the VAL server is
notified by the LMS server when the VAL UE relationship (e.g. inside or
outside) to the area of interest changes along with current location
information of the VAL UE.
#### 9.3.11.2 Monitoring Location Deviation procedure
Figure 9.3.11.2-1 describes the procedure for monitoring the VAL UE\'s
location in a given area of interest.
Pre-condition:
\- The LM server authorized to consume the 3GPP core network service
(Monitoring events provided by NEF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11]).
Figure 9.3.11.2-1: Monitoring VAL UE\'s location at a given location
1\. The VAL server sends Monitor Location Subscription Request to LM server
including VAL UE Identifier, predetermined area of interest information,
notification interval and notification URI where the VAL server intends to
receive the notifications from LM server regarding VAL UE\'s presence in a
given area.
\- \"Area of interest\" is the location information, which the VAL server
wishes to monitor the VAL UE\'s location adherence. This parameter can include
an area of interest information and other relevant parameters.
\- \"Notify_Interval\" represents the periodic interval in which the LM server
needs to notify VAL UE\'s location information to the VAL server. When the VAL
UE moves away from the \"Area of interest\", then the LM server ignores the
\"Notify_Interval\" and sends the location notification to the VAL server
immediately.
2\. LM server processes the Area of interest information in the request, and
then subscribes to UE location monitoring as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11]
with appropriate parameters mapping. Based on the subscription, the LM server
receives the VAL UE location information periodically from the 3GPP core
network. The LM server also invokes NEF service for Area of Interest
monitoring as specified in clause 5.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.256 [52] to know whether
the VAL UE is in the VAL server's predetermined area of interest.
3\. LM server shall use the Location information procedures as specified in
clause 9.3.7 and clause 9.3.10, to periodically obtain the VAL UE location
information. Based on the geographic information from the VAL server, the LM
server may determine to additionally include the positioning methods in SEAL
LMS procedures to obtain location information.
4\. LMS may periodically obtain the VAL UE location information from the 3^rd^
party location management server based on the geographic information from the
VAL server.
NOTE 1: How the LMS obtains the UE location from the 3^rd^ party location
management server is out of scope of this specification.
5\. LM server, after successful subscription according to steps 2\~4, sends
Monitor Location Subscription response, indicating that the LM server accepts
VAL server\'s request and will monitor the location of the VAL UE to verify if
the VAL UE is in the area of interest.
6a and 6b. LM server processes the location information received from SEAL
Location Information procedures, the 3GPP core network and/or the 3rd party
location management server, and validates the information. If the location
information is matching, then the LM server shall check if the VAL UE\'s
current location is within the predetermined area of interest received in step
1.
NOTE 2: The location information received from the 3GPP core network and from
LM client does not necessarily be exactly the same, the LM server can
aggregate the location information if there is no big deviation.
6c. LM server verifies its determined VAL UE location status (i.e. presence or
absence with regard to the predetermined area of interest) with the retrieved
3GPP core network result from the NEF monitoring service for Area of Interest.
The LM server will continue with step 7, step 8 and step 9 as applicable.
7\. If the location information received from Location management client, the
3GPP core network and/or the 3rd party location management server do not match
or the NEF reported Area of Interest monitoring result does not match with the
determined VAL UE location status (present/absence) in LM server, then the LM
server shall consider the VAL UE as outside from its specified area of
interest and shall notify (\"Notify Mismatch Location\" message) the VAL
server of the same, including VAL UE ID and the location information from LM
server,the 3GPP core network and/or the 3rd party location management server
in the notification message.
8\. If the VAL UE\'s current location is from Location management client, the
3GPP core network and/or the 3rd party location management server matches, and
not in the area of interest received from VAL server in Monitor Location
Subscription Request message, and such out of area of interest result is also
aligned with the NEF reported area of interest monitoring result, then the LM
server considers the VAL UE as outside from its specified area of interest and
shall notify the VAL server that the VAL UE\'s current location is outside of
area of interest and VAL UE ID in \"Notify Absence\" message.
9\. When the VAL UE\'s current location is in area of interest, and such in
area of interest result is also aligned with the NEF reported area of interest
monitoring result, then the LM server shall notify (\"Notify Presence\"
message) the VAL server periodically, according to the \"Notify_Interval\"
value in \"Monitor Location Subscription Request\" message, indicating the VAL
server that the VAL UE is within the area of interest, along with VAL UE\'s
current location information.

The VAL service area refers to the geographical area served by a VAL server.
The VAL server may have more than one VAL service area defined. These VAL
service areas are configured by the VAL server to the location management
server and and are assigned with the unique identifier. When the VAL service
area configurations in place the VAL server may use the VAL service area ID as
part of the location information in the SEAL APIs requiring location
information. These configurations can be updated by the VAL server in-order to
modify the geographical area associated with the VAL service area ID and when
is updated, the SEAL internally manage the updates without requiring the VAL
server to re-invoke the APIs where the updated VAL service area ID are being
used.

# 10 Group management
## 10.1 General
The group management is a SEAL service that offers the group management
related capabilities to one or more vertical applications.
## 10.2 Functional model for group management
### 10.2.1 General
The functional model for the group management is based on the generic
functional model specified in clause 6. It is organized into functional
entities to describe a functional architecture which addresses the support for
group management aspects for vertical applications. The on-network and off-
network functional model is specified in this clause.
### 10.2.2 On-network functional model description
Figure 10.2.2-1 illustrates the generic on-network functional model for group
management.
Figure 10.2.2-1: On-network functional model for group management
The group management client communicates with the group management server over
the GM-UU reference point. The group management client provides the support
for group management functions to the VAL client(s) over GM‑C reference point.
The VAL server(s) communicate with the group management server over the GM-S
reference point.
The group management server interacts with the NEF of the underlying 3GPP
network system via N33 reference point to perform group management procedures
for 5G Virtual Network (5GVN) groups.
Figure 10.2.2-2 exhibits the service-based interfaces for providing and
consuming group management services. The group management server could provide
service to VAL server and group management client through interface Sgm.
Figure 10.2.2-2: Architecture for group management -- Service based
representation

client of the UE2 over the GM‑PC5 reference point.
### 10.2.4 Functional entities description
#### 10.2.4.1 General
The functional entities for group management SEAL service are described in the
following subclauses.
#### 10.2.4.2 Group management client
The group management client functional entity acts as the application client
for management of groups. A VAL system maintains groups corresponding to one
or more vertical applications. The group management client interacts with the
group management server. The group management client also supports
interactions with the corresponding group management client between the two
UEs.
The group management client functional entity is supported by the signalling
user agent and HTTP client functional entities of the signalling control
plane.
#### 10.2.4.3 Group management server
The group management server functional entity provides for management of
groups supported within the vertical application layer. The group management
server acts as CAPIF\'s API exposing function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222
[8]. The group management server also supports interactions with the
corresponding group management server in distributed SEAL deployments.
The group management server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS and
HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.
All the group management clients supporting users belonging to a single group
are required to use the same group management server for that group. A group
management client supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have
relationships with multiple group management servers.
### 10.2.5 Reference points description
#### 10.2.5.1 General
The reference points for the functional model for group management are
described in the following subclauses.
#### 10.2.5.2 GM-UU
The interactions related to group management functions between the group
management client and the group management server are supported by GM-UU
reference point. This reference point utilizes Uu reference point as described
in 3GPP TS 23.401 [9] and 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
GM-UU reference point is used for VAL service signalling for VAL service data
management of the VAL service. The GM-UU reference point supports:
\- Configuration of group related data at the group management client by the
group management server; and
\- Configuration of group related data at the group management server by the
group management client.
The GM-UU reference point uses the HTTP-1/HTTP-2 reference points for
transport and routing of group management related signalling. The GM-UU
reference point uses the SIP-1/SIP-2 reference points for
subscription/notification related signalling.
#### 10.2.5.3 GM-PC5
The interactions related to group management functions between the group
management clients located in different VAL UEs are supported by GM-PC5
reference point. This reference point utilizes PC5 reference point as
described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [12].
#### 10.2.5.4 GM-C
The interactions related to group management functions between the VAL
client(s) and the group management client within a VAL UE are supported by
GM-C reference point.
#### 10.2.5.5 GM-S
The interactions related to group management functions between the VAL
server(s) and the group management server are supported by GM-S reference
point. This reference point is an instance of CAPIF-2 reference point as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8].
GM-S reference point supports the VAL server to obtain group information
corresponding to the VAL service. The GM-S reference point uses HTTP-1/HTTP-2
reference points for transport and routing of group management related
signalling. The GM-S reference point uses SIP-2 reference point for
subscription/notification related signalling.
#### 10.2.5.6 GM-E
The interactions related to group management functions between the group
management servers in a distributed deployment are supported by GM-E reference
point.
#### 10.2.5.7 N33
For group management procedures pertaining to a 5GVN group the group
management server interacts with the NEF of the underlying 3GPP network using
the dynamic 5G Virtual Network group management procedures exposed by the NEF
via the N33 reference point, as specified in TS 23.501 [10] and in TS 23.502
[11].
## 10.3 Procedures and information flows for group management
### 10.3.1 General
Group management procedures apply to on-network VAL service only.
Group creation provides a dedicated VAL group to individual VAL users to
enable the required communication for one or multiple VAL services. This
includes the normal group creation by administrators or by authorized user/UE.
The group management server supports the external group identifier within the
VAL group document to enable the SEAL servers to consume the NEF services for
the member UEs of the VAL group.
NOTE: If an authorized VAL user/UE wants to participate in a new group created
by the authorized VAL user/UE, then the authorized VAL user/UE needs to have
been included in the new group as a member.

requests group create operation to the group management server. The identities
of the users or UEs being combined and the information of the VAL services
that are enabled on the group shall be included in this message.
2\. During the group creation, the group management server creates and stores
the information of the group. The group management server performs the check
on the policies e.g. maximum limit of the total number of VAL group members
for the VAL group(s). The external group identifier, identifying the member
UEs of the VAL group at the 3GPP core network, is stored in the newly created
VAL group\'s configuration information.
NOTE: The exact policies are out of scope of the present document.
3\. The group management server may conditionally notify the VAL server
regarding the group creation with the information of the group members.
4\. The VAL group members of the VAL group are notified about the newly
created VAL group configuration data.
5\. The group management server provides a group creation response to the
group management client of the administrator/authorized VAL user/UE.
### 10.3.4 Group information query

obtaining the users or UEs corresponding to the location information or the
VAL service area identified by the VAL service area ID.
3\. The location management server composes the list of users or UEs within
the requested location.
4\. The group management server receives the composed list of users or UEs
from the location management server. The location management server may
include VAL service IDs associated with the list of users or UEs.
5\. During the group creation, the group management server creates and stores
the information of the location-based group. The group management server
performs the check on the policies e.g. maximum limit of the total number of
VAL group members for the VAL group(s). If an external group identifier,
identifying the member UEs of the VAL group at the 3GPP core network is
available, then the external group ID is stored in the newly created VAL
group\'s configuration information. If VAL service ID list was received in
step 1 as part of group formation criteria and not in step 4 for the composed
list of users or UEs, the group management server shall retrieve the VAL
service data from the configuration management server as described in clause
11.3.2.13 and form the group with relevant users or UEs.

### 10.3.8 Group announcement and join
#### 10.3.8.1 General
This subclause describes the procedures for establishing group communication
from the group management server to the group management clients.
#### 10.3.8.2 Procedure
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management client, group management server, VAL server and the
VAL clients belong to the same VAL system.
2\. The VAL server is aware of the users\' identities and is authorized to
form a VAL group.
Figure 10.3.8.2-1: Procedure for establishing VAL group communication between
the group management server and group management client1.
1\. The VAL server determines group information and the identity list to which
the group announcement shall be sent. The decision can be based on the list of
authorized UEs and other criteria (e.g. user consent, service, or vehicle
driving profile).
2\. The VAL server configures VAL group for Uu communication defined by VAL
Group ID for one or more VAL services with list of VAL Service ID with the
group management server.
3\. The group management server creates an empty group based on the
information provided in the Configure VAL group request. The group management
server stores the mapping between the VAL group ID and the external Group Id
in the VAL group document, along with a list of GPSIs corresponding to the
identity list provided by the VAL server. The group management server also
determines whether the group is for 5G LAN-Type communication and whether
Ethernet or IP (IPv4 and/or IPv6) transport shall be used for the 5G LAN-Type
communication.
4\. If 5G LAN-Type communication is to be used, the group management server
creates a 5GVN group in the 5GS via N33 using the create group procedure
specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10] clause 5.29.2 and 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause
4.15.6. The group management server creates the 5GVN group data and the 5GVN
group membership data defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.15.6.3b to be
configured in the 5GS. To create the 5GVN group data the group management
server uses the 5G LAN-Type communication type information provided by the VAL
server to set the PDU session type (Ethernet or IP) and maps the VAL service
IDs to Application descriptors. To create the 5GVN group membership data the
group management server maps the VAL group ID to the External Group ID and
makes a list of GPSIs corresponding to the identity list provided by the VAL
server.
NOTE 1: This step is skipped for the case that a 5G LAN-Type communication is
not being used.
NOTE 2: The PDU session type, DNN, S-NSSAI provided within 5GVN group data
cannot be modified in the 5GS after the create procedure.
NOTE 3: The 5GS supports only a 1:1 mapping between DNN/S-NSSAI combination
and 5GVN group.
NOTE 4: The group management server maintains a mapping between DNN and
S-NSSAI of the 5GVN group and the VAL server requester identity based on
operator policy. How such mapping is configured is implementation specific and
out of the scope of this specification.
5\. The group management server announces the VAL group to the group
management clients. For a 5GVN group the announcement includes the
communication type (IP or Ethernet), DNN, and S-NSSAI corresponding to the
5GVN group.
6\. The group management client registers to VAL group communication using the
VAL Group ID.
7\. The group management server records the users who have registered to be
the members of the group.
8\. The group management server sends a VAL group registration response to the
group management client.
9\. The group management server sends a configure VAL group response to the
VAL server.
NOTE 5: Step 9 may occur any time after step 5.
10\. The group management server sends identity list notification about the
newly registered users to the other members of the group and VAL server, whose
subscription to receive notifications of newly registered VAL UE IDs is
successful in step 8 and step 9 respectively.
11\. The group management client may inform VAL client about the updated
identity list.
### 10.3.9 Group member leave
#### 10.3.9.1 General

de-registering.
#### 10.3.9.2 Procedure
Pre-conditions:
1\. Group is previously defined on the group management server including the
list of registered users and each member of the group and VAL server is aware
of it.
Figure 10.3.9.2-1: Procedure for group member leaving the group.
1\. The VAL client determines to de-register member from the group and group
management client is aware of it.
2\. The group management client initiates the group de-registration request
towards the group management server.
3\. The group management server checks the authorization of group de-
registration request and updates the group member list.
4\. The group management server sends a group de-registration response to the
group management client.
5\. The group management server sends identity list notification about the
leaving registered user to the other members of the group and the VAL server,
whose subscription to receive notifications of de-registered VAL UE IDs is
successful in step 7 and step 8 of the procedure in clause 10.3.8.2
respectively.
### 10.3.10 Temporary groups
#### 10.3.10.1 Temporary group formation within a VAL system
Figure 10.3.10.1-1 below illustrates the temporary group formation within a
VAL system.
Temporary groups are formed by combining two or more groups. The temporary
group formation is applicable only for groups configured with at least one
common VAL service. The temporary group formation shall be rejected if any of
the requested VAL services are not common to all the constituent VAL service
groups.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management client, group management server, VAL server and the
VAL group members belong to the same VAL system.
2\. The group management client has retrieved the group configurations of the
groups.
3\. The VAL server has subscribed to receive group management event

Figure 10.3.10.1-1: Temporary group formation within a VAL system
1\. The group management client of the VAL user requests temporary group
formation operation to the group management server, which is the group
management server of one of the groups to be regrouped. The identities of the
groups being combined shall be included in this message. The group management
client may indicate the security level required for the temporary group. The
group management client may indicate the priority level required for the
temporary group.
2\. The group management server checks whether temporary group formation
operation is performed by an authorized VAL user, based on group policy. The
group management server checks whether group1 or group2 is a temporary group.
If group 1 or group2 is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be
rejected, otherwise the group regrouping can proceed.
3\. The group management server creates and stores the information of the
temporary group, including the temporary VAL group ID, the VAL group ID of the
groups being combined, the priority level of the temporary group and the
security level of the temporary group. If the authorized VAL user does not
specify the security level and the priority level, the group management server
shall set the lowest security level and the highest priority of the
constituent groups. If VAL service types of the groups being combined are not
identical, group management server determines the overlapping part and stores
the VAL service list for the temporary group.
4\. The group management server notifies the VAL server regarding the
temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups, i.e.
temporary VAL group ID, group1\'s VAL group ID and group2\'s VAL group ID. If
VAL service list is included, VAL server stores it and provides VAL service
types accordingly.
5\. The group management server notifies the VAL group members of the
constituent VAL groups by sending temporary group formation notification
messages.
6\. The VAL group members of the constituent VAL groups send individual
temporary group formation notification response messages.
7\. The group management server provides a temporary group formation response
to the group management client of the authorized VAL user. If VAL service list
is included, group management client stores it and initiates VAL service types
accordingly.
8\. The VAL group members of the constituent VAL groups individually request
group configuration data from the group management server for the temporary
group. The group configuration data includes security, priority, and other
parameters.

# 11 Configuration management
## 11.1 General
The configuration management is a SEAL service that offers the configuration
management related capabilities to one or more vertical applications.
## 11.2 Functional model for configuration management
### 11.2.1 General
The functional model for the configuration management is based on the generic
functional model specified in clause 6. It is organized into functional
entities to describe a functional architecture which addresses the support for
configuration management aspects for vertical applications. The on-network and
off-network functional model is specified in this clause.
### 11.2.2 On-network functional model description
Figure 11.2.2-1 illustrates the generic on-network functional model for
configuration management.
Figure 11.2.2-1: On-network functional model for configuration management
The configuration management client communicates with the configuration
management server over the CM-UU reference point. The configuration management
client provides the support for configuration management functions to the VAL
client(s) over CM‑C reference point. The VAL server(s) communicate with the
configuration management server over the CM-S reference point. The
configuration management server communicates with the VAL user database over
the CM-VAL-UDB reference point.
### 11.2.3 Off-network functional model description
Figure 11.2.3-1 illustrates the off-network functional model for configuration
management.
Figure 11.2.3-1: Off-network functional model for configuration management
The configuration management client of the UE1 communicates with the
configuration management client of the UE2 over the CM-PC5 reference point.
### 11.2.4 Functional entities description
#### 11.2.4.1 General
The functional entities for configuration management SEAL service are
described in the following subclauses.
#### 11.2.4.2 Configuration management client
The configuration management client functional entity acts as the application
client for configuration related transactions. The configuration management
client interacts with the configuration management server and provides and
receives configuration data. The configuration management client also supports
interactions with the corresponding configuration management client between
the two UEs.
The configuration management client functional entity is supported by the
signalling user agent and HTTP client functional entities of the signalling
control plane.
#### 11.2.4.3 Configuration management server
The configuration management server is a functional entity used to configure
one or more vertical applications with 3GPP system related vertical
applications provisioning information and configure data on the configuration
management client. The configuration management server manages vertical
application configuration supported within the vertical\'s service provider.
The configuration management server acts as CAPIF\'s API exposing function as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8]. The configuration management server also
supports interactions with the corresponding configuration management server
in distributed SEAL deployments.
The configuration management server functional entity is supported by the SIP
AS and HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.
### 11.2.5 Reference points description
#### 11.2.5.1 General
The reference points for the functional model for configuration management are
described in the following subclauses.
#### 11.2.5.2 CM-UU
The interactions related to configuration management functions between the
configuration management client and the configuration management server are
supported by CM-UU reference point. This reference point utilizes Uu reference
point as described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [9] and 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
The CM-UU reference point provides the configuration information required for
VAL services and supports:
\- configuration of the VAL UE by the VAL service; and
\- configuration of the VAL application with the VAL service related
information e.g. policy information by the VAL UE.

### 12.3.3 General user authentication and authorization for VAL services
#### 12.3.3.1 General
The high level user authentication and authorization procedure is described in
the following subclause.
#### 12.3.3.2 Primary VAL system
Figure 12.3.3.2-1 is a high level user authentication and authorization flow.
NOTE: The specific user authentication and authorization architecture required
by the VAL services in order to realize the VAL user authentication and
authorization is specified in subclauses 5.2.3, 5.2.4 and 5.2.5 of 3GPP TS
33.434 [29].
The user authentication process shown in figure 12.3.3.2-1 may take place in
some scenarios as a separate step independently from a SIP registration phase,
for example if the SIP core is outside the domain of the VAL server.
Editor\'s note: The procedure described in this subclause as shown in Figure
12.3.3.2-1 may require further study.
A procedure for user authentication is illustrated in figure 12.3.3.2-1. Other
alternatives may be possible, such as authenticating the user within the SIP
registration phase.
Figure 12.3.3.2-1: VAL user authentication and registration with Primary VAL
system, single domain
1\. In this step the identity management client begins the user authorization
procedure. The VAL user supplies the user credentials (e.g. biometrics,
secureID, username/password) for verification with the identity management
server. This step may occur before or after step 3. In a VAL system with
multiple VAL services, a single user authentication as in step 1 can be used
for multiple VAL service authorizations for the user.
2\. The signalling user agent establishes a secure connection to the SIP core
for the purpose of SIP level authentication and registration.
3\. The signalling user agent completes the SIP level registration with the
SIP core (and an optional third-party registration with the VAL service
server(s)).
NOTE 1: The VAL client(s) perform the corresponding VAL service authorization
for the user by utilizing the result of this procedure.
NOTE 2: Steps 2 and 3 are not required to be performed if the VAL service does
not use SIP.
#### 12.3.3.3 Interconnection partner VAL system
Where communications with a partner VAL system using interconnection are
required, user authorization takes place in the serving VAL system of the VAL
service user, using the VAL user service authorization procedure specified in
subclauses 5.2.5 and 5.2.6 of 3GPP TS 33.434 [29].
### 12.3.4 VAL server provisioning for identity management service
#### 12.3.4.1 General
The high level procedure for VAL server to provision required information to
SEAL identity management server in order to support VAL user authentication is
described in the following subclause.
#### 12.3.4.2 Procedure
The procedure for VAL server to provision required information to SEAL
identity management server in order to support VAL user authentication is
illustrated in figure 12.3.4.2-1.
Figure 12.3.4.2-1: VAL Server provisioning to SEAL Identity Management Server
1\. The VAL server sends a request message to identity management server to
provision required information. The request message includes identity of the
VAL server, security credentials of the VAL server, and service provider
specific information like identity list per VAL service.
2\. Upon receiving the request, the identity management server authorizes the
request based on the security credentials provided in the request and
considering the service level agreement between VAL service provider and SEAL
service provider. If VAL server is authorized to use the SEAL service, then
the identity management server stores the details about the VAL server
including the list of VAL user IDs per VAL service. The identity management
server sends the response message to the VAL server.
Editor\'s note: Whether the VAL server registers with Identity Management
Server is FFS.

# 14 Network resource management
## 14.1 General
The network resource management is a SEAL service that offers the network
resource management (e.g. unicast and multicast network resources) and
monitoring related capabilities to one or more vertical applications.
## 14.2 Functional model for network resource management
### 14.2.1 General
The functional model for the network resource management is based on the
generic functional model specified in clause 6. It is organized into
functional entities to describe a functional architecture which addresses the
support for network resource management aspects for vertical applications. The
on-network and off-network functional model is specified in this clause.
### 14.2.2 On-network functional model description
#### 14.2.2.1 Generic on-network functional model for network resource
management
Figure 14.2.2-1 illustrates the generic on-network functional model for
network resource management.
{width="6.134650043744532in" height="3.99950021872266in"}
Figure 14.2.2.1-1: On-network functional model for network resource management
The network resource management client communicates with the network resource
management server over the NRM-UU reference point. The network resource
management client provides the support for network resource management
functions to the VAL client(s) over NRM‑C reference point. The VAL server(s)
communicate with the network resource management server over the NRM-S
reference point.
The network resource management server obtains and controls the
multicast/broadcast resource from the underlaying 3GPP network system by
communicating with the BM-SC via MB2-C and xMB-C reference points towards LTE
eMBMS and with the 5G MBS control plane functions via Nmb13, Nmb10 or N33
towards the 5GS. The network resource management server communicates with the
PCRF via Rx reference point or communicates with the PCF via N5 reference
point to control the unicast resources from the underlying 3GPP network
system. The network resource management server communicates with the SCEF via
T8 reference point or communicates with the NEF via N33 reference point to
perform event monitoring procedures from the underlying 3GPP network system.
The network resource management server interacts with NEF via N33 to obtain
QoS monitoring information from the 5GS.
Figure 14.2.2.1-2 exhibits the service-based interfaces for providing and
consuming group management services. The network resource management server
could provide service to VAL server and network resource management client
through interface Snrm.
Figure 14.2.2.1-2: Architecture for network resource management -- Service
based representation
Figure 14.2.2.1-3 illustrates the service-based representation for utilization
of the 5GS network services based on the 5GS SBA specified in 3GPP TS 23.501
[10].

The Network resource management server and VAL server act as authorized API
invoker to consume services from the Core Network northbound API entities like
NEF which act as API Exposing Function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].
#### 14.2.2.2 On-network functional model for network resource management for
TSN
The architecture for integration of the 5G with TSN [36] is depicted in Figure
14.2.2.2-1. The SEAL Network Resource Management (NRM) server acts as a TSN AF
(defined in [10] in clause 5.28.1). TSN CNC (defined in [35]) via the NRM-S
reference point configures the TSN flows in the 5GS. In this case the NRM-S
supports the IEEE 802.1Qcc management protocol. As a TSN AF the SEAL NRM
server interacts with the 5GS PCF over the N5 reference point to configure the
5G QoS and TSCAI parameters in the 5GS.
Figure 14.2.2.2-1: On-network functional model for network resource management
for TSN
NOTE: Whether DS-TT and UE are combined or are separate is up to
implementation.
Acting as the TSN AF the NRM server collects 5GS TSN Bridge information by
interaction with the 5GS via the N5 reference point, as described in in TS
23.502 [11] Annex F.1.
NRM server triggers via N5 the AF request procedure as described in 3GPP TS
23.502 [11] Annex F.2.
#### 14.2.2.3 On-network functional model for network resource management for
5G TSC
5G TSC refers to time sensitive communication service offered within the 5G
system (i.e. without integration with a TSN system) by the 5GS for the UEs
connected to the 5GS. The architecture for the 5G TSC is depicted in Figure
14.2.2.3-1. The SEAL NRM server acts as an AF towards the 5G Core Network and
performs coordination of QoS flows to fulfill the end-to-end QoS requirements
for the UEs involved in the TSC communication. It combines the roles of TSCTSF
and TSC CNC (similar to the TSN CNC in the TSN integration case), which means
that it controls the allocation of resources of TSC communication within the
boundaries of the 5G domain.
Upon request from a VAL server via the NRM-S reference point it configures the
TSC end-to-end QoS flows in the 5GS. In line with other SEAL service enablers
the SEAL NRM server provides a RESTful interface on the NRM-S reference point.
As a TSCTSF the SEAL NRM server interacts with the 5GS PCF over the N84
reference point to configure the 5G QoS and TSCAI parameters in the 5GS.
Figure 14.2.2.3-1: On-network functional model for network resource management
for 5G TSC
### 14.2.3 Off-network functional model description
Figure 14.2.3-1 illustrates the off-network functional model for network
resource management.

management is FFS.
### 14.2.4 Functional entities description
#### 14.2.4.1 General
The functional entities for network resource management SEAL service are
described in the following subclauses.
#### 14.2.4.2 Network resource management client
The network resource management client functional entity acts as the
application client for the management of network resources. The network
resource management client interacts with the network resource management
server.
#### 14.2.4.3 Network resource management server
The network resource management server functional entity provides for
management of 3GPP system network resources (e.g. unicast, multicast) and
monitoring events to support the VAL applications. The network resource
management server acts as CAPIF\'s API exposing function as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.222 [8]. The network resource management server also supports
interactions with the corresponding network resource management server in
distributed SEAL deployments. The NRM server\'s role may be assumed by the VAL
server in some deployments, in which case, the VAL server performs the
procedures for network resource management of the NRM server.

### 14.3.3 Unicast resource management
#### 14.3.3.1 General
The following subclauses specify the procedures for unicast resource
management for vertical application layer. The NRM server sets up bearers and
may need to modify the bearers for an already established VAL service
communication.
Characteristics that may need to be modified include:
\- activation and deactivation of the bearer;
\- modification of the QoS characteristics of the bearer (e.g. bearer priority
adjustment); and
\- modification of GBR due to application requirement
NOTE: A VAL service communication can consist of both unicast and multicast
bearers which can all need modification due to the same event.
Vertical application layer specific pre-requisites and resultant behaviour by
functional entities in performing these procedures are specified in the
respective vertical application layer TS (e.g. for V2X application layer, see
3GPP TS 23.286 [7]).
Unicast resource management is supported with PCC interactions with SIP core
and PCC interactions with NRM server. The PCC procedures for EPS are specified
in 3GPP TS 23.203 [18] and the PCC procedures for 5GS are specified in 3GPP TS
23.503 [19].
#### 14.3.3.2 Unicast resource management with SIP core
##### 14.3.3.2.1 Request for unicast resources at VAL service communication
establishment
###### 14.3.3.2.1.1 General
The procedure defined in this subclause specifies how network resources are
requested at VAL service communication establishment. If concurrent sessions
are used the NRM server may utilize the capability of resource sharing
specified for underlying network policy and charging functions. The request
for resources includes application type, bandwidth, priority, application
identifier and resource sharing information.
###### 14.3.3.2.1.2 Procedure
The procedure is generic to any type of session establishment that requires
requests for network resources.
Procedures in figure 14.3.3.2.1.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the
requesting resource at session establishment.
Pre-condition:
\- The VAL client has requested VAL service communication with the VAL server.
Figure 14.3.3.2.1.2-1: Resource request at VAL service communication
establishment
1\. The VAL server sends request for resources to the NRM server.
2\. The NRM server evaluates the need for network resources and use of
resource sharing.
3\. The NRM server sends a session progress request containing request for
resources.
4\. PCC procedures are initiated from SIP core local inbound/outbound proxy.
5\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy sends a OK message to the NRM
server.
6\. The NRM server sends a resource response to the VAL server.
7\. The VAL service communication is established, and resources have been
allocated.
##### 14.3.3.2.2 Request for modification of unicast resources
###### 14.3.3.2.2.1 General
To modify unicast bearers, the NRM server shall send a resource modification
request containing the parameters to be modified for the UE.
Possible scenarios when this procedure may be used are:
> \- Modify the allocation and retention priority for unicast resources;
>
> \- Release and resume resources in-between VAL service communications; or
>
> \- Release and resume resources when a UE is able to receive the VAL service
> communications over multicast transmission
###### 14.3.3.2.2.2 Procedure
Procedures in figure 14.3.3.2.2.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the
modification of a unicast:

##### 14.3.3.3.1 Network resource adaptation
###### 14.3.3.3.1.1 General
This subclause describes the procedure for network resource adaptation using
PCC procedures. This procedure satisfies the requirements for requesting
unicast resources and modification to already allocated unicast resources to
VAL communications.
###### 14.3.3.3.1.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.3.3.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the network resource
adaptation.
Figure 14.3.3.3.1.2-1: Network resource adaptation
1\. The VAL server sends a network resource adaptation request to the NRM
server for one or more users belonging to one or more VAL services, and may
comprise one or more VAL UEs that will have updated resource requirement. This
requirement may be in the form of exact resources /resource pools to be used
or indication of bandwidth increase/decrease for the corresponding VAL UEs or
set of VAL UEs.
2\. The NRM server processes the request and applies / enforces the resource
adaptation per VAL UE.
3\. The NRM server retrieves UE IP address by using event monitoring
capability for PDU session status (or PDN connectivity status) and initiates
the PCC procedures for each VAL UE.
4\. The NRM server provides a network resource adaptation response to the VAL
server, providing information on the fulfilment of the network resource
adaptation request. This will include information either per VAL UE or per set
of VAL UEs, as indicated by the request of the VAL server in step 1.

establishment
###### 14.3.3.3.2.1 General
The procedure defined in this subclause specifies how network resources are
requested at VAL service communication establishment. If concurrent sessions
are used the NRM server may utilize the capability of resource sharing
specified for underlying network policy and charging functions. The request
for resources includes application type, bandwidth, priority, application
identifier and resource sharing information.
###### 14.3.3.3.2.2 Procedure
The procedure is generic to any type of session establishment that requires
requests for network resources.
Procedures in figure 14.3.3.3.2.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the
requesting resource at session establishment.

allocated.
##### 14.3.3.3.3 Request for modification of unicast resources
###### 14.3.3.3.3.1 General
To modify unicast resources, the NRM server shall send a resource modification
request containing the parameters to be modified for the UE.
Possible scenarios when this procedure may be used are:
> \- Modify the allocation and retention priority for unicast resources;
>
> \- Release and resume resources in-between VAL service communications; or
>
> \- Release and resume resources when a UE is able to receive the VAL service
> communications over multicast transmission

#### 14.3.3.4 Unicast QoS monitoring
##### 14.3.3.4.1 Unicast QoS monitoring subscription procedure
###### 14.3.3.4.1.1 General
This subclause describes the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring
subscription. This procedure satisfies the requirements for monitoring of
unicast QoS for already allocated unicast resources to VAL communications.
###### 14.3.3.4.1.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.3.4.1.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure for unicast QoS
monitoring subscription.
Pre-conditions:
\- The VAL UE has an established connection in the 5GS
Figure 14.3.3.4.1.2-1: Unicast QoS monitoring subscription
1\. The VAL server sends a unicast QoS monitoring subscription request to the
NRM server either in conjunction with a request for unicast network resources
requiring QoS or when the unicast QoS connection is already established. The
NRM server checks if the VAL server is authorized to initiate the unicast QoS
monitoring request for the requested target VAL UEs, VAL group ID, or VAL
stream IDs.
NOTE: It is left for stage 3 to decide whether to combine the QoS monitoring
subscription request with the request for unicast resources.
2\. The NRM server interacts with the NEF to establish relevant QoS monitoring
subscriptions. The NRM server uses the NEF procedures for the AFsessionWithQoS
described in clause 5.2.6.9 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and the NEF procedures for
the AnalyticsExposure described in clause 5.2.6.16 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and
in particular the UE Communication Analytics described in clause 6.7.3 of 3GPP
TS 23.288 [34] and DN Performance Analytics described in clause 6.14 of 3GPP
TS 23.288 [34]. Based on the input received from the VAL server in step 1, the
NRM server determines the relevant NEF subscription procedures and the
parameters for these subscriptions, such as the QoS parameters to be measured
(e.g. packet delay, data rate, traffic volume), the frequency of reporting
etc. For the frequency of reporting which can be event triggered, periodic, or
when the PDU Session is released, the NRM server determines the following:
a) if the reporting frequency is event triggered:
> i) the corresponding reporting threshold to each QoS parameter;
>
> ii) minimum waiting time between subsequent reports;
b) if the reporting frequency is periodic, the reporting period.
3\. The NRM server responds with a unicast QoS monitoring subscription
response indicating the subscription status.
##### 14.3.3.4.2 Unicast QoS monitoring notification procedure
###### 14.3.3.4.2.1 General
This subclause describes the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring
notification.
###### 14.3.3.4.2.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.3.4.2.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure of unicast QoS
monitoring notification event.
Pre-conditions:
\- The VAL server has an active unicast QoS monitoring subscription with the
NRM server
Figure 14.3.3.4.2.2-1: Unicast QoS monitoring notification procedure
1\. The NRM server receives QoS monitoring data by means of notifications
provided by the NEF. The NRM server coordinates and combines the information
from the NEF notifications and determines whether to send a notification to
the VAL server based on the VAL server subscription\'s frequency of reporting.
For a VAL group or a list of VAL UEs, the NRM server aggregates QoS monitoring
data for each UE belonging to the group or the list; for a VAL stream, the NRM
server aggregates the QoS monitoring data for the stream. The NRM server
stores the QoS monitoring data as needed for later retrieval.
2\. The NRM server sends a unicast QoS monitoring notification including the
measured QoS data to the VAL server. If the reporting termination criteria is
met (e.g. number of reports reached, threshold reached), NRM server shall also
terminate the subscription.
##### 14.3.3.4.3 Unicast QoS monitoring subscription termination procedure
###### 14.3.3.4.3.1 General
This subclause describes the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring
subscription termination.
###### 14.3.3.4.3.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.3.4.3.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure of unicast QoS
monitoring subscription termination.
Pre-conditions:
\- The VAL server has an active unicast QoS monitoring subscription with the
NRM server
Figure 14.3.3.4.3.2-1: Unicast QoS monitoring subscription termination
procedure
1\. When the VAL server decides to terminate a unicast QoS monitoring
subscription, it sends a QoS monitoring unsubscribe request to the NRM server.
2\. The NRM server interacts with the NEF to terminate the related QoS
monitoring subscriptions.
3\. The NRM server sends a QoS monitoring unsubscribe response to the VAL
server.
##### 14.3.3.4.4 Unicast QoS monitoring data retrieval procedure
###### 14.3.3.4.4.1 General
This subclause describes the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring
data retrieval.
###### 14.3.3.4.4.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.3.4.4.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure of unicast QoS
monitoring data retrieval.
Figure 14.3.3.4.4.2-1: Retrieval of unicast QoS monitoring data
1\. The VAL server sends a unicast QoS monitoring data request to the NRM
server specifying the details of the requested data and the time period of
interest. The NRM server checks if the VAL server is authorized to initiate
the unicast QoS monitoring data request for the requested target VAL UEs, VAL
group ID, or VAL stream IDs.
2\. The NRM server determines if it has the requested data stored internally
or whether it needs to interact with the NEF to fetch the data using the
AnalyticsExposure described in clause 5.2.6.16 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and in
particular the UE Communication Analytics described in clause 6.7.3 of 3GPP TS
23.288 [34] and DN Performance Analytics described in clause 6.14 of 3GPP TS
23.288 [34]. The NRM server collects and processes the collected data to match
the measurement data requirement provided in the VAL server request.
3\. The NRM server responds with a unicast QoS monitoring data response with
the requested data or with a failure indication, and optionally the cause of
the failure, in case the requested data is not available.
##### 14.3.3.4.5 Unicast QoS monitoring subscription update procedure
###### 14.3.3.4.5.1 General
This subclause describes the high-level procedure to update unicast QoS
monitoring subscription. This procedure updates the parameters to be monitored
of an already existing unicast QoS monitoring subscription.
###### 14.3.3.4.5.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.3.4.5.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure for unicast QoS
monitoring subscription update.
Pre-conditions:
\- The VAL UE has an established connection in the 5GS
\- Unicast QoS monitoring subscription has successfully been ~~invoked~~
established for the VAL UE
Figure 14.3.3.4.5.2-1: Unicast QoS monitoring subscription update
1\. The VAL server sends a unicast QoS monitoring subscription update request
to the NRM server. It shall refer to an existing subscription, identified by
the list of VAL UEs, VAL UE group or VAL stream IDs included into the message.
2\. The NRM server interacts with the NEF to update the relevant QoS
monitoring subscription parameters and reporting frequency as specified in
step 2 of clause 14.3.3.4.1.2 of this document.
3\. The NRM server responds with a unicast QoS monitoring subscription update
response indicating the subscription status.
### 14.3.4 Multicast resource management for EPS
#### 14.3.4.1 General
The VAL server utilizes the NRM server for multicast resource management.
To activate the multicast bearers in the EPS, the NRM server shall use the
Activate MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16] with the NRM
server performing the GCS AS function.
To deactivate the multicast bearers in the EPS, the NRM server shall use the
Deactivate MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16] with the NRM
server performing the GCS AS function.
To modify multicast bearers in the EPS, the NRM server shall use the Modify
MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16] with the NRM server
performing the GCS AS function.
Editor\'s note: To support other modes of MBMS is FFS.
#### 14.3.4.2 Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
##### 14.3.4.2.1 General
In this scenario, upon triggered by VAL server, the NRM server pre-establishes
MBMS bearer(s) in certain pre-configured areas before the initiation of the
VAL service group communication session. When a user originates a request for
a VAL service group communication session for one of these areas, the pre-
established MBMS bearer(s) is used for the DL VAL service communication.
The following steps need to be performed prior to the start of the VAL service
group communication session over pre-established MBMS bearer:
\- Pre-establish MBMS bearer(s)
\- Announce the pre-established MBMS bearer to the NRM clients
When these preparation steps have been done the VAL service group
communication session using MBMS bearer can start.
The vertical application level communications are sent on the MBMS bearer.
Optionally a separate MBMS bearer could be used for the application level
control messages, due to different bearer characteristic requirements.
##### 14.3.4.2.2 Procedure
The procedure figure 14.3.4.2.2-1 shows only one of the receiving VAL clients
using an MBMS bearer. There might also be VAL clients in the same VAL service
group communication session that receive the communication on unicast bearers.
Figure 14.3.4.2.2-1: Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
1\. The VAL server sends a MBMS bearers request to the NRM server including
service description(s) for which the MBMS bearers are requested.
2a. The NRM server determines to activate MBMS bearer. The activation of the
MBMS bearer in EPS is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP
TS 23.468 [16]. This bearer will be used for the VAL service communication.
**_If local MBMS is requested in step 1, the NRM server uses the local MBMS
information provided by VAL server in step 1 or the local MBMS information
configured locally in the NRM server to activate the MBMS bearers. The NRM
server performs local MBMS procedures in line with the procedure of L.MBMS
based MBMS data delivery defined in 3GPP TS 23.285 [31]._**
2b. Optionally, the NRM server may also activate an MBMS bearer dedicated for
application level control signalling. The activation of the MBMS bearer is
done on MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16]. **_If
local MBMS is requested in step 1, the NRM server uses the local MBMS
information provided by VAL server in step 1 or the local MBMS information
configured locally in the NRM server to activate the MBMS bearers. The NRM
server performs local MBMS procedures in line with the procedure of L.MBMS
based MBMS data delivery defined in 3GPP TS 23.285 [31]._**
NOTE 1: The procedure to determine the activation of MBMS bearers is
implementation specific.
3a. The NRM server passes the MBMS bearer info for the service description
associated with the pre-established MBMS bearer to the NRM client. The NRM
client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service
description.
3b. The NRM server may pass the MBMS bearer info for the service description
associated with the application control MBMS bearer to the NRM client. The NRM
client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service
description.
NOTE 2: Step 3a and step 3b can be done in one MBMS bearer announcement
message.
4\. The NRM client stores the information associated with the TMGI(s). The NRM
service client uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information to
activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer by the VAL UE. The NRM client
shares the MBMS bearer related information with the VAL client.
5\. The NRM client that enters or is in the service area of at least one
announced TMGI indicates to the NRM server that the VAL UE is able to receive
VAL service communication over MBMS, whereby the NRM server may decide to use
the MBMS bearer instead of unicast bearer for VAL service communication
sessions based on available information at the NRM server including the MBMS
listening status report as described in clause 14.3.4.5.
NOTE 3: Step 5 is optional for the VAL UE on subsequent MBMS bearer
announcements.
6\. The NRM server provides a MBMS bearers response to the VAL server.
7\. A VAL service group communication session is established.
8\. As the VAL server transmits the VAL service communication over the MBMS
bearer, the VAL service communication packets are detected and delivered to
the VAL client.
#### 14.3.4.3 Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
##### 14.3.4.3.1 General
In this scenario, the VAL server uses a unicast bearer for communication with
the UE on the DL at the start of the group communication session. When the VAL
server triggers to use an MBMS bearer in EPS for the DL VAL service
communication, the NRM server decides to establish an MBMS bearer in EPS using
the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16]. The NRM server provides MBMS
service description information associated with MBMS bearer(s), obtained from
the BM-SC, to the UE. The UE starts using the MBMS bearer(s) to receive DL VAL
service and stops using the unicast bearer for the DL VAL service
communication.
##### 14.3.4.3.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.4.3.2-1 illustrates the use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment.
Figure 14.3.4.3.2-1: Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
1\. A VAL service group communication session is established.
2\. The downlink data is sent by unicast delivery.
3\. The VAL server sends MBMS bearers request to the NRM server.
4\. The NRM server establishes the MBMS bearer(s) for the VAL service group
communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468
[16]. Service description associated with the MBMS bearer(s) is returned from
the BM-SC. **_If local MBMS is requested in step 3, the NRM server uses the
local MBMS information provided by VAL server in step 3 or the local MBMS
information configured locally in the NRM server to activate the MBMS bearers.
The NRM server performs local MBMS procedures in line with the procedure of
L.MBMS based MBMS data delivery defined in 3GPP TS 23.285 [31]._**
5\. The NRM server provides service description information associated with
the MBMS bearer to the UE. The VAL UE obtains the TMGI from the announcement
message. This message may be sent on an application level control signalling
bearer.
6\. The VAL UE starts monitoring data over MBMS associated with the TMGI,
while in the service area associated with the TMGI.
7\. The VAL UE detects that it is able to receive data over MBMS associated
with the TMGI.
8\. The NRM client notifies the NRM server the MBMS listening status
associated to the monitored TMGI, (e.g. that it is successfully receiving the
TMGI). The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of the
TMGI. The NRM server may decide to use the MBMS bearer instead of unicast
bearer for VAL service communication sessions based on available information
at the NRM server including the MBMS listening status report as described in
clause 14.3.4.5.
9\. The NRM server provides an MBMS bearer response to the VAL server with the
dynamic MBMS bearer(s) information. The VAL server stops sending VAL service
communication data over unicast way to the VAL client.
NOTE: The MBMS reception quality level may be used by the NRM server to make
an efficient decision to switch again to a unicast transmission or to take
measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level indicates that
the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or reaching an
insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services).
10\. A VAL service group communication session via dynamic MBMS bearer(s) is
established.
11\. The VAL server sends the downlink VAL service communication for the VAL
service group communication session over the MBMS.
#### 14.3.4.4 MBMS bearer announcement over MBMS bearer
##### 14.3.4.4.1 General
The MBMS announcement may be done on either a unicast bearer or a MBMS bearer.
Using a unicast bearer for MBMS bearer announcement provides an interactive
way of doing announcement. The NRM server will send the MBMS bearer
announcement message to the NRM client regardless if there is an MBMS bearer
active or the VAL client can receive the data on the MBMS bearer with
sufficient quality. The benefit of the existing procedure is that it gives a
secure way to inform the NRM client about the MBMS bearer and how to retrieve
the data on the MBMS bearer.
When there is more than one MBMS bearer active in the same service area for
VAL service, there are not the same reasons to use unicast bearer for
additional MBMS bearer announcement. Instead a MBMS bearer for application
level control signalling can be used to announce additional MBMS bearers.
The MBMS bearer announcement messages are sent on an MBMS bearer used for
application control messages. This bearer will have a different QoS setting
compared to an MBMS bearer used for VAL service communication, since
application signalling messages are more sensitive to packet loss.
##### 14.3.4.4.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.4.4.2-1 illustrates a procedure that enables the NRM server to
announce a new MBMS bearer.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An MBMS bearer used for VAL service application control messages must have
been pre-established and announced to the NRM client.
2\. Additional MBMS bearer information may have already been announced to the
NRM client.
Figure 14.3.4.4.2-1: MBMS bearer announcement over an MBMS bearer used for
application control messages
1\. The NRM client monitors an MBMS bearer that is used for VAL service
application signalling messages, such as bearer announcement messages.
2\. The NRM server activates a new MBMS bearer.
3\. The NRM server announces the MBMS bearer to the NRM client. The bearer may
have just been activated or may have already been running for some time. The
step may be repeated as needed.
4\. The NRM server sends a MBMS bearer announcement on the MBMS bearer used
for VAL application control messages. The MBMS bearer announcement contains
the identity of the MBMS bearer (i.e. the TMGI) and may optionally include
additional information about the newly announced bearer. Required and optional
MBMS bearer announcement details may have already been provided. In this case
the MBMS bearer identity could be used as a key for such MBMS bearer details.
5\. The NRM client start to monitor the newly announced MBMS bearer.
6\. If requested by the NRM server, the NRM client sends an acknowledgement of
the MBMS bearer to the NRM server.
7\. The NRM server de-announce the MBMS bearer.
8\. The NRM server sends a MBMS bearer de-announcement message that contains
the identity of the MBMS bearer.
9\. The NRM client stops monitoring the de-announced MBMS bearer.
The same procedure can also be used to modify existing MBMS bearer
announcement information. Example of such modification could be addition of
UDP ports or modification of codec in the SDP.
#### 14.3.4.5 MBMS bearer quality detection
##### 14.3.4.5.1 General
The NRM client and NRM server use this procedure to report and take action on
the MBMS bearer quality towards VAL service communications. A NRM client
monitors an MBMS bearer to enable receiving VAL service communication. Based
on the received quality (e.g. radio level quality, transport level quality),
the NRM client needs to inform the NRM server that the VAL UE is able to
receive the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer with sufficient
quality or not able to receive the VAL service communication on the MBMS
bearer with sufficient quality. Furthermore, based on the received quality,
the NRM client may notify the NRM server at which MBMS reception quality level
it has received the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer.
The issue can be more complex since the NRM client needs to estimate the
quality of the bearer even in the scenario when there are no data currently
transmitted on the MBMS bearer. The reason for this is that an NRM client that
has entered an area with significantly degraded MBMS quality, might not even
notice that a VAL service communication is ongoing, meanwhile the NRM server
still assumes that the VAL UE can receive the VAL service communication being
broadcasted.
To estimate the MBMS bearer quality, for example as an equivalent BLER (Block
Error Rate), when no data is sent is implementation specific. This estimation
can be dependent on for example the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and
measurements from the reference signals from the eNB(s). Other metrics (e.g.
RTP packet loss) may be used to estimate the MBMS bearer quality.
Based on the MBMS bearer quality reported from the NRM clients, the NRM server
may decide to use the MBMS bearer for a group communication if a certain
number of NRM clients located in the MBMS service area are able to receive the
VAL service communication. And if a NRM client is not able to receive the VAL
service communication on the MBMS bearer, the NRM server may decide to switch
the user plane deliver mode for the NRM client from MBMS bearer to unicast
bearer.
##### 14.3.4.5.2 Procedure
The NRM client shall indicate the ability of the NRM client to receive the
MBMS bearer.
Pre-conditions:
1\. There is an MBMS bearer activated and the MBMS bearer information is
announced to the NRM client
2\. The NRM client is located in the MBMS broadcasting area
3\. The VAL UE monitors SIB-13 (or SIB-20) and (SC-)MCCH to receive the
modulation and coding scheme
4\. The VAL UE monitors the cell specific reference signal and when MBSFN
transmission is used, the MBSFN specific reference signals
Figure 14.3.4.5.2-1: MBMS bearer quality detection
1\. The NRM client determines that the MBMS bearer quality shall be reported
to the NRM server. The NRM client may determine the MBMS bearer quality by
using the BLER of the received data. When no data is received, the quality
estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding
scheme (MCS). The UE may also use predictive methods to estimate the expected
MBMS bearer quality (e.g. speed and direction) to proactively inform the NRM
server of an expected loss of the MBMS bearer quality. The NRM client may also
map the determined MBMS bearer quality to a MBMS reception quality level. The
MBMS reception quality level indicates at which specific MBMS bearer quality
level the VAL service communication has been received.
Editor\'s note: The set of MBMS reception quality levels and the mapping of
the determined MBMS bearer quality to those levels are FFS.
NOTE 1: When MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN reference signal needs to
be used and when SC-PTM is used the cell specific reference signal needs to be
used. With the measured reference signal, the reference signal received
quality (RSRQ) can be calculated.
2\. If the MBMS bearer quality reaches a certain threshold, the NRM client
sends an MBMS listening status report. The threshold is used to define the
MBMS listening status, which indicates if the MBMS bearer quality has been
acceptable or not to receive a specific VAL service communication. If the MBMS
bearer quality is mapped to a different MBMS reception quality level, the NRM
client may send an MBMS listening status report including the MBMS reception
quality level. Based on the MBMS listening status, if MBMS reception quality
level is received, then the NRM server may efficiently decide to switch to
another bearer (e.g., MBMS bearer or unicast bearer) or to take measures to
prepare such a switch and further notify the VAL server.
NOTE 2: Prior sending the MBMS listening status report, it could be beneficial
to also include information for different alternatives e.g. another MBMS
bearer might have better quality and could be a better option than a transfer
of the communication to unicast.
NOTE 3: The threshold used to indicate MBMS bearer quality depends on VAL
service type (i.e. V2X, MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData) and the metrics used. The
metrics used and the associated thresholds are out of scope of this
specification.
3\. The NRM server may send additional proposal for measurements e.g.
information about neighbouring MBMS bearers. This message may be an MBMS
bearer announcement message.
4\. The NRM server may send user plane delivery mode to VAL server based on
the MBMS listening status to preserve the service continuity as described in
clause 14.3.4.6 and clause 14.3.4.9.
#### 14.3.4.6 Service continuity in MBMS scenarios
##### 14.3.4.6.1 General
This subclause specifies service continuity scenarios when MBMS bearers are
used. There are different solutions for different scenarios.
##### 14.3.4.6.2 Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another
The service continuity solution described in this subclause is suitable in the
scenario when multiple MBMS bearers are used with the purpose to cover a
larger area. In VAL communications several VAL service communication streams
may be multiplexed in one MBMS bearer. Furthermore, one VAL service
communication stream may be sent on more than one MBMS bearer if the receiving
users are distributed over more than one MBMS service area. A VAL UE that is
interested in receiving a VAL service communication stream that is broadcasted
in both MBMS bearers is a candidate for this service continuity procedure.
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-1 illustrates a deployment scenario that provides service
continuity between two MBSFN areas. Two different MBMS bearers are activated
(TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), the activation of the bearers is done in the two MBSFN
areas (MBSFN 1 and MBSFN 2). The MBSFN areas 1 and 2 are partially
overlapping, meaning that some transmitting cells belong to both MBSFN area 1
and MBSFN area 2.
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-1: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-2 illustrates the procedure:
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-2: Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another
1\. The VAL UE is located in MBSFN 1 and can listen to TMGI 1. No additional
MBMS bearers that the NRM client is interested in are active in the current
cell.
2a. The NRM client notifies the NRM server that the VAL UE is successfully
receiving the VAL service communication over TMGI 1. The NRM client may also
notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 1.
2b. The NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
NOTE: The MBMS reception quality level may be used by the NRM server to make
an efficient decision to switch to another MBMS bearer or to a unicast bearer,
or to take measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level
indicates that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or
reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services).
3\. The VAL UE moves into a new cell in which both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 are
active. This cell is part of both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2, and broadcast
the same service on both TMGIs.
4\. The NRM client sends a location information report to the NRM server. For
that, the UE uses the SAI information found in the system information block
(SIB) transmitted by the radio cells.
5\. The NRM server sends to the NRM client a MBMS bearer announcement with
information related to TMGI 2 (if the NRM server had not done it before).
Hence, the NRM client knows that TMGI 2 transmits the same VAL service
communication.
6a. The NRM client notifies the NRM server that it is successfully receiving
TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality
level per TMGI.
6b. The NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
7\. The VAL UE may receive the VAL service communication over both MBMS
bearers, i.e. TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The VAL UE may also verify that it is the
same content sent on both bearers. The duplicated packets may also be used to
perform error corrections.
8\. The VAL UE moves into a new cell in MBSFN area 2, where only TMGI 2 is
active.
9a. The NRM client notifies the NRM server that the VAL UE is successfully
receiving the VAL service communication over TMGI 2. The NRM client may also
notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 2.
9b. The NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
10\. The VAL UE receives the VAL service communication only over TMGI 2.
This service continuity procedure mitigates the risk of packet loss that may
occur if the VAL UE would request to transfer the VAL service communication
stream to a unicast bearer when moving into the new area and then back to a
multicast bearer when the UE can listen to TMGI 2. However, it is still
required that the NRM client sends a location report (and MBMS listening
report), as described in steps 4-6 above. To send the location report and the
MBMS listening report by the NRM client to the NRM server a unicast bearer is
needed. The location report from the NRM client is required, since the NRM
server must know that the VAL UE has entered a new area and can only listen to
MBMS bearer active in that area. If this is not done the VAL server might send
a VAL service communication stream that the VAL UE is required to listen to on
the MBMS bearer 1, since the NRM server still assumes that the VAL:UE is
located in the MBSFN area 1.
The solution can be improved as illustrated in figure 14.3.4.6.2-3. In this
case two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), these MBMS
bearers are used only for VAL service communication. An application level
signalling bearer is activated (TMGI 9), in both MBSFN areas. This bearer is
used for application level signalling messages that are sent on the MBMS
bearer TMGI 9. By using an application level signalling bearer (e.g. TMGI 9)
the VAL UEs can receive application control messages for all VAL service
communication going on in the areas of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. A VAL UE that
is located in the area of TMGI 2 and is interested in a VAL service group
transmission (e.g. V2X) only going on in TMGI 1, can with the information
received in TMGI 9 initiate a unicast bearer and request to receive that
specific VAL service communication over a unicast instead. Without the
information received over TMGI 9 the NRM client must immediately report that
the VAL UE has left the broadcast area that the NRM server assumes that the
VAL UE is located in. With the use of TMGI 9 there is no immediate need for
the NRM client to inform the NRM server of a location change.
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-3: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas with a
separate application signalling bearer
The procedural steps in this scenario will be the same as described above in
this subclause. However, in this scenario the NRM client is not required to
initiate a unicast bearer to send location report (or MBMS listening report).
The VAL UE may move between the two MBMS bearers (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2) without
the need to report an area change. A condition for this to work is that there
is an application level signalling bearer (TMGI 9) activated in the full area
(i.e. the area of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2). The TMGI 9 will broadcast all
application control messages for all VAL service communications ongoing in
both areas. If the VAL UE is in coverage of one of the two MBMS bearers that
does not transmit the VAL service communication of interest the VAL UE can
report to the NRM server that it is not able to listen to the VAL service
communication over the MBMS bearer, which triggers the NRM server to switch to
a unicast bearer instead.
#### 14.3.4.7 MBMS suspension notification
##### 14.3.4.7.1 General
In this procedure the NRM client is requested by the NRM server to send a MBMS
suspension report. This request for MBMS suspension report can be included in
the MBMS bearer announcement and the NRM server may choose to only send this
request for MBMS suspension report to a subset of all NRM clients.
##### 14.3.4.7.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.4.7.2.-1 illustrates a procedure in which the NRM client notifies
the NRM server about an MBMS suspension decision in RAN.
The NRM server can decide on a subset of all VAL UEs in the MBMS broadcast
area that shall report on MBMS bearer suspension. When the NRM server makes
the decision of the VAL UE subset, consideration shall be taken to the
location of the VAL UEs, since VAL UEs\' location is dynamically changed. This
means that the MBMS suspension reporting instruction may need to be updated
regularly based on the VAL UEs mobility.
Pre-condition:
\- It is assumed that there is at least one active MBMS bearer
Figure 14.3.4.7.2-1: MBMS suspension notification
1\. The NRM server sends an MBMS suspension reporting instruction to the NRM
client.
NOTE: This message may be included in the MBMS bearer announcement message and
may be sent both on a unicast bearer and a multicast bearer.
2\. RAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer, according to existing procedures
in 3GPP TS 36.300 [23].
3\. An MBMS suspension indication is sent in the MSI (MCH Scheduling
Information), according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300 [23].
4\. The NRM client detect the MBMS suspension and sends an MBMS suspension
report.
5\. Based on the MBMS suspsension report received, the NRM server determines
whether to switch to a new bearer (unicast or MBMS). If NRM server determines
to switch to unicast bearer, then the NRM server sends the user plane delivery
mode message to VAL server , and the VAL server sends the downlink data over
the new bearer.
The NRM client that is not instructed to send an MBMS suspension report shall
still detect the MBMS suspension indication from RAN (step 3). A NRM client
shall in this case not send other types of report (e.g. MBMS listening
reports).
The same procedure can be applied at MBMS resumption or other MBMS events that
may be detected by the NRM client.
#### 14.3.4.8 MBMS bearer event notification
##### 14.3.4.8.1 General
The NRM server is an instantiation of a GCS AS. For the NRM server to know the
status of the MBMS bearer, and thus know the network\'s ability to deliver the
VAL service, it is required that the network provides MBMS bearer event
notifications to the NRM server. The different events notified to the NRM
server include the MBMS bearer start result (e.g. when the first cell
successfully allocated MBMS resources), including information if any cells
fail to allocate MBMS resources to a specific MBMS bearer, the current status
of the MBMS bearer, MBMS bearer suspension/resume or overload scenarios.
Editor\'s note: The procedure defined in this sub clause requires an
enhancement to GCSE and RAN and is therefore subject to implementation in EPC
and RAN.
##### 14.3.4.8.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 14.3.4.8.2-1 shows notification information flows from
NRM server to BM-SC.
Figure 14.3.4.8.2-1: MBMS bearer event notification
1\. The NRM server activates an MBMS bearer. The activation of the MBMS bearer
is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16].
2\. The BMSC will respond to the activation with an Activate MBMS bearer
response message, according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16].
3\. The EPC and RAN will initiate the MBMS session start procedure according
to 3GPP TS 23.246 [17]. This procedure is outside the scope of this
specification.
4a. At the first indication of a successful MBMS session start procedure, the
BM-SC sends a MBMS bearer event notification, indicating that the MBMS bearer
is ready to use.
4b. The NRM server notifies user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
5\. The VAL server starts to use the MBMS bearer according to the MBMS
procedures in this specification.
6\. An event from RAN related to the MBMS session is received by the BM-SC.
7a. The BM-SC notifies the NRM server of certain MBMS related events including
references to affected MBMS services areas or list of cells. Example of such
events may be radio resources not available, overload, MBMS suspension.
7b. The NRM server notifies user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
8\. The NRM server may decide, based on the received events, to switch to
unicast transmission for relevant VAL UEs.
NOTE: Steps 6-8 should be seen as example events from the network that may
occur and possible actions taken by the NRM server. These steps may be done at
any time and repeatedly during the life time of an MBMS bearer.
#### 14.3.4.9 Switching between MBMS bearer and unicast bearer
##### 14.3.4.9.1 General
The NRM server monitors the bearers used for VAL service communications and
decides to switch between MBMS and unicast bearers.
##### 14.3.4.9.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.4.9.2-1 shows the procedure for service continuity when a UE is
about to move out of MBMS coverage or getting into good MBMS coverage by
switching between MBMS bearer and unicast bearer.
Pre-condition:
\- It is assumed that a bearer (unicast or MBMS) has been activated by the VAL
server for downlink delivery.
Figure 14.3.4.9.2-1: Switching between MBMS delivery and unicast delivery
1\. The VAL UE detects changing MBMS bearer condition (good or bad MBMS
coverage) for the corresponding MBMS service. The method to detect is
implementation specific.
2\. The NRM client notifies the NRM server about the MBMS bearer condition for
the corresponding MBMS service by sending the MBMS listening status report.
NOTE 1: To efficiently notify the NRM server, e.g., when the NRM client
detects that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or
reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services, the
NRM client proactively may send to the NRM server a MBMS listening status
report including the MBMS reception quality level.
3\. The NRM server makes the decision to switch between MBMS delivery and
unicast delivery based on available information at the NRM server including
the MBMS listening status report as described in clause 14.3.4.5. The NRM
server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
4\. The VAL server sends the downlink data over the new bearer (unicast or
MBMS) to the VAL client as per step 3.
NOTE 2: The new bearer (unicast or MBMS) may be set up on demand after step 3
or before.
5\. During the switching, the VAL client simultaneously receives downlink data
through both bearers (unicast bearer and MBMS bearer). If there is no downlink
data to the VAL client, this step can be skipped.
6\. The VAL client ceases to receive the downlink data through previous bearer
but continues receiving data through new bearer.
### 14.3.4A Multicast resource management for 5GS
#### 14.3.4A.1 General
This subclause defines information flows and procedures for 5G MBS usage that
applies to VAL services. 5G MBS session can be used by any VAL service for any
VAL service group.
The main purpose of using 5G Multicast-Broadcast Service (MBS) by verticals is
to provide efficient downlink delivery of user traffic in VAL service group
communications or in a certain area.
Multicast and broadcast communication services in 5G for vertical
applicationsrely on the creation and establishment of MBS sessions to deliver
user data in downlink. Shared and individual delivery from the VAL server to
multiple VAL users is supported either as point-to-point or point-to-
multipoint over the radio. The MBS session which consist of one or multiple
QoS flows for different service requirements are either broadcast or multicast
type. For the broadcast MBS session or local MBS session, the MBS service area
is configured with the MBS session.
NOTE 1: Support of MBS and specific session types is an implementation choice.
Within this arrangement, the VAL server decides whether to create broadcast or
multicast MBS sessions to be associated with certain VAL service groups or
area. The 5GC adaptively decides whether to deliver the MBS traffic from the
MB-UPF in the form of shared delivery or individual delivery, where the latter
is applicable to multicast MBS sessions. The NG-RAN decides to utilize point-
to-point or point-to-multipoint delivery methods applicable for shared
delivery only. MBS provides reliability enhancements and minimizes loss of
information, e.g., due to mobility and handover.
MBS group scheduling mechanism enables simultaneous reception of MBS and
unicast user traffic by the VAL UEs. The UEs can receive broadcast MBS
sessions irrespective of their RRC state (i.e., connected, inactive or idle)
and multicast sessions only in RRC‑CONNECTED state.
The following capabilities (non-exhaustive list) provided by MBS could be used
by NRM server:
\- MBS session creation;
\- MBS session update;
\- MBS session release;
\- MBS session ID allocation;
\- Dynamic PCC control for MBS session.
The first phase to utilize MBS sessions for VAL media transmission is to
reserve the network resource by creating a MBS sessions. The MBS session
creation is initiated by the VAL server towards the NRM server, and the NRM
server further interacts with the 5GS to complete the whole process. The UE's
capabilities and service related information e.g., UE's MBS capabilities,
location, MBS listening status report, UE session join notification sent by
group members are considered when deciding to create or use MBS sessions.
During the interaction with NRM server, the necessary information related to
the requested session is determined, e.g., MBS session mode (either a
broadcast or a multicast session) and the required service profile. This
interaction between the NRM server and the 5GS depends on the configuration
option under consideration, i.e., whether the NRM server is in trusted domain
(limited operations), and whether the session creation is done with or without
a dynamic PCC rule.
NOTE 1: It is implementation specific whether the VAL server decides to use
multicast or broadcast MBS sessions.
NOTE 2: It is implementation specific whether the VAL decides to create (one
or multiple) MBS sessions for VAL media for VAL group communications
associated to a certain VAL group or create (one or multiple) dynamic MBS
sessions once the need has emerged, e.g., dynamic MBS sessions to be
associated for an ad hoc group.
NOTE 3: It is implementation specific whether an MBS session is associated to
one or multiple VAL service groups, and whether it is re-assigned to other VAL
service groups.
NOTE 4: How the NRM server uses the UE's capabilities and service related
information in order to create and use the MBS session is implementation
specific.
The information elements describing the MBS session under consideration is
then sent to the NRM clients via MBS session announcement, where the latter
need to react according to the announced session mode.
If eMBMS and 5G MBS co-exist for VAL services, the NRM service server may
decide to trigger the establishment of an eMBMS bearer to deliver the VAL
media associated to the VAL service group communications, if the target VAL
service group(s) consists of members with MBMS capable RAT. As a result, the
NRM server subsequently needs to send an eMBMS bearer announcement towards the
clients camping on LTE.
NOTE 5: It is implementation specific whether the NRM server triggers an eMBMS
bearer or a unicast bearer to serve VAL clients camping on LTE.
#### 14.3.4A.2 MBS session creation and MBS session announcement
##### 14.3.4A.2.1 General
The procedures in this clause describe how MBS session creation and MBS
session announcement can be used for the transmission of VAL service group
communication data over either broadcast or multicast MBS sessions. The MBS
session can either be created with or without dynamic PCC rule, where the
latter requires less interaction done by the NRM server towards the 5GC
(either directly or via NEF).
##### 14.3.4A.2.2 Procedure for pre-created MBS session and MBS session
announcement
Pre-conditions:
\- The NRM server has decided to use an MBS session for VAL service group
communications associated to a certain VAL servive group based on transport
only mode.
\- The NRM server has performed MB-SMF discovery and selection either directly
or indirectly via NEF/MBSF, unless the corresponding information is locally
configured.
\- NRM clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and belong to the
same VAL service group X.
\- The NRM server is aware whether to request the creation of the MBS service
server with or without dynamic PCC rule.
{width="6.69375in" height="4.513194444444444in"}
Figure 14.3.4A.1.2-1: Use of pre-created MBS session.
1\. The VAL server sends a multicast/broadcast resource request towards the
NRM server including the VAL server identity, service description(s),
multicast resource type (e.g,. multicast type or broadcast type), service
announcement mode (i.e., service announcement is sent by NRM or the VAL
itself), Endpoint of the VAL server.
2\. The NRM server initiates an MBS session creation procedure towards the 5GC
as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39]. The procedure starts once the NRM server
initiates a TMGI allocation request (either directly to MB-SMF or indirectly
via NEF). Upon the reception of the TMGI allocation response, the NRM server
sends an MBS session creation request, including further information related
to the MBS session, e.g., MBS session ID, MBS session mode and the QoS
requirements if dynamic PCC rule is not considered. However, if dynamic PCC
rule is considered, the NRM server defines these requirements at a later step,
namely it sends an MBS authorization/policy create request towards PCF (either
directly or to the NEF) indicating the QoS requirements.
NOTE 1: In case of LTE eMBMS and 5G MBS co-existence, the NRM server may
trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearers as described in clause 14.3.4 (or
it may establish a unicast bearer) based on the RAT capabilities supported by
the VAL service group members in the VAL service group X. If MBSF and BM-SC
are co-located, TMGI used by 4G eMBMS can be the same as the MBS session ID.
NOTE 2: For the case of multi carrier support for broadcast MBS sessions, the
NRM server may indicate the frequencies within a broadcast MBS service area by
providing the MBS frequency selection area ID(s) (MBS FSA ID(s)) to the MB-SMF
or indirectly via NEF.
3\. The NRM server provides the NRM clients of the VAL service group X with
the information related to the created MBS session via the MBS session
announcement. The MBS session announcement includes information such as the
MBS session ID, MBS session mode (broadcast or multicast service type) and SDP
information related to the MBS session under consideration.
NOTE 3: The NRM server may send an MBS session announcement at an earlier step
during the MBS session creation procedure towards the NRM clients once the VAL
service group associated to the MBS session is known.
Optionally, the NRM server includes the information elements related to the
established eMBMS bearer, as indicated in table 7.3.2.2-1. The NRM clients
which camp on LTE will subsequently react to the information elements related
to the eMBMS bearer as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].
4\. NRM clients store and process the received MBS session information.
5\. NRM clients may provide an MBS session announcement acknowledgment to the
NRM server to indicate the reception of the corresponding MBS session
announcement.
6\. Based on the MBS session mode (either multicast or broadcast), the
following actions take place;
6a. For multicast MBS sessions, NRM clients initiate a UE session join request
towards the 5GC using the information provided via the MBS session
announcement. Hence, upon the first successful UE session join request, the
multicast is then established, and the radio resources are reserved, if the
session is in an active state. The established session can either be in active
or inactive state as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39]. The NRM clients sends a
UE session join notification towards the server as indicated in the MBS
session announcement. If indicated in the MBS session announcement
information, NRM clients report the monitoring state (i.e. the reception
quality of the MBS session) back to the NRM server; or
6b. For broadcast MBS sessions, if the NRM client is accessing over 5G, the
session is established as part of the session creation procedures as described
in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39], and the network resources are reserved both in 5GC and
NG-RAN. The NRM clients start monitoring the reception quality of the
broadcast MBS session. If indicated in the MBS session announcement
information, NRM clients report the monitoring state (i.e. the reception
quality of the MBS session) back to the NRM server.
NOTE 4: It is implementation specific whether the MBS session reception
quality level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS
flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signals, such as the
reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), or packet loss.
7\. The NRM clients provide a listening status notification related to the
announced session (multicast or broadcast session) in the form of an MBS
listening status report.
8\. The NRM server provides a multicast/broadcast resource response to the VAL
server.
9\. An VAL service group communication setup takes place and uses the pre-
created MBS session for this group communication packet DL delivery.
##### 14.3.4A.2.3 Procedure for dynamic MBS sessions
In this scenario, the VAL service group communication is already taken place
and a unicast PDU session is utilized for DL transmission. When the NRM server
decides to use an MBS session for the transmission under consideration, the
NRM server interacts with 5GC to reserve the necessary network resources.
NOTE 1: The NRM server logic for determining when to create a dynamic MBS
session is implementation specific.
The procedure in figure 14.3.4A.2.3-1 shows one NRM client receiving the DL
media. There might also be NRM clients in the same VAL service group
communication session that receive the communication on a PDU session.
Pre-conditions:
\- NRM client is attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to a certain
VAL service group X.
\- The NRM server is aware whether to request the creation of the MBS session
with or without dynamic PCC rule.
\- The NRM server has performed MB-SMF discovery and selection either directly
or indirectly via NEF/MBSF, unless the corresponding information is locally
configured.
\- No MBS session exists, or the existing multicast MBS session fails to
satisfy the QoS requirements.

Figure 14.3.4A.2.3-1: Use of dynamic MBS session.
1\. An VAL service group communication session is established and the DL media
packet is delivered to the VAL client via unicast.
2\. The VAL server sends a multicast/broadcast resource request towards the
NRM server including the VAL server identity, service description(s),
multicast resource type (e.g,. multicast type or broadcast type), service
announcement mode (i.e., service announcement is sent by NRM or the VAL
itself), Endpoint of the VAL server.
3\. The NRM server decides to create an MBS session. The MBS session creation
procedure takes place as described in clause 14.3.4A.1.
NOTE 2: In case of LTE eMBMS and 5G MBS co-existence, the NRM server may
trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearers as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3]
(or it may establish a unicast bearer) based on the RAT capabilities supported
by the affiliated members in the VAL service group X. If MBSF and BM-SC are
co-located, TMGI used by 4G eMBMS can be the same as the MBS session ID.
NOTE 3: For the case of multi carrier support for broadcast MBS sessions, the
NRM server may indicate the frequencies within a broadcast MBS service area by
providing the MBS frequency selection area ID(s) (MBS FSA ID(s)) to the MB-SMF
or indirectly via NEF.
4\. The NRM server provides the NRM client with the information related to the
created MBS session via an MBS session announcement. As described in table
7.3.2.2-1, the session announcement includes information such as the MBS
session ID, MBS session mode (broadcast or multicast service type), and SDP
information related to the MBS session.

5\. The NRM client stores the MBS session ID and other associated information.
6\. The NRM client may send an MBS session announcement ack back to the NRM
server.
7\. Based on the MBS session mode (either multicast or broadcast), the
following actions take place:

NOTE 4: It is implementation specific whether the MBS session reception
quality level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS
flow level via e.g., measurements of radio level signaling such as the
reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.
8\. The NRM clients provide a listening status notification related to the
announced session (multicast or broadcast session) in the form of an MBS
listening status report.
9\. The NRM server provides a multicast/broadcast resource response to the VAL
server.
10\. An VAL service group communication via dynamic MBS session is
established. The VAL server sends the downlink packet for the VAL service
group communication session over the MBS session.
#### 14.3.4A.3 MBS resources update
##### 14.3.4A.3.1 General
The VAL server can create one or several MBS sessions via the NRM server,
based on certain service requirements, a certain service area, or the activity
status of multicast MBS sessions. However, during the life cycle of the MBS
sessions, the VAL server may need to trigger the update of the sessions via
the NRM server to meet emerging needs, including the service requirements,
service area related parameters.
##### 14.3.4A.3.2 Procedure for updating MBS resources without dynamic PCC
rule
The procedure shown in figure 14.3.4A.3.2-1 presents an MBS session update
procedure triggered by the VAL server via the NRM server (either directly
interacting with the MB-SMF, or indirectly with NEF/MBSF). Within the update
request, either the service requirements, MBS service area, activity status of
multicast MBS session, or all three are done, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247
[39].
Pre-conditions:
\- The NRM clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and belong to
the same active VAL service group.
\- The NRM server has obtained the required information related to the MB-SMF,
either locally configured or during initial session configuration.
\- The MBS session is created with certain service requirements and optionally
with a certain broadcast/multicast service area. The MBS session is announced
to be associated with the VAL service group for group communication purposes.

Figure 14.3.4A.3.2-1: MBS session update without dynamic PCC
1\. An MBS session is established as described in in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39]
(either a multicast or a broadcast session), and associated with a certain
active VAL service group for group communication purposes. In the case of a
multicast MBS session, the NRM clients have already joined the session.
2\. The VAL server invoke the multicast resource update request to the NRM
server once the need has emerged to modify some aspects for the given MBS
session under consideration. The updated parameters are included, e.g.,
service requirements, service area or both. In case of multicast MBS sessions,
the VAL server may as well include the status (active or inactive) of the
multicast MBS session to be set.
3\. The NRM server performs an MBS session update procedure with the 5GC as
described in 3GPP 23.247 [39]. Based on the needed requirements, the
corresponding MBS session is accordingly modified at the 5GS. The update may
lead to QoS Flow(s) addition, modification, or removal. The NRM server
receives an MBS session update response once the requested modifications are
performed, and the indicated MBS session is updated accordingly.
4\. The NRM server may initiate a session announcement towards the NRM clients
associated with the ongoing session in order to announce the updated
information, if required, e.g., the updated service area or SDP information.
5\. The NRM server sends an MapGroupToSessionStream over the configured MBS
session providing the required information to receive the media related to the
established VAL service group communication.
6\. The NRM clients process the received information over the
MapGroupToSessionStream in order to receive the associated VAL media over the
specific MBS session stream.
7\. The NRM server returns the multicast resource update resonse to the VAL
server.
8\. VAL client 1 sends media to the VAL server over unicast to be distributed
for the established group communication.
9\. The VAL server distributes the VAL media to the VAL clients 2 to n over
the indicated streams.
##### 14.3.4A.3.3 Procedure for updating MBS resources with dynamic PCC rule
The procedure shown in figure 14.3.4A.3.3-1 presents an MBS session update
procedure triggered by the NRM server to the 5GC, either directly or via
NEF/MBSF. Based on the required updates to be done, the NRM server needs to
interact with the MB-SMF to update the MBS service area and multicast activity
status, with the PCF to update the required QoS requirements, or sequentially
both to update all the above, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].
Pre-conditions:
\- The NRM clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and belong to
the same active VAL service group.
\- The NRM server has obtained the required information related to the MB-SMF,
either locally configured or during initial session configuration.
\- The MBS session is created with certain service requirements and optionally
with a certain broadcast/multicast service area. The MBS session is announced
to be associated with the VAL service group for group communication purposes.
Figure 14.3.4A.3.3-1: MBS session update with dynamic PCC
1\. An MBS session is established as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [29] (either
a multicast or a broadcast session), and associated with a certain active VAL
service group for group communication purposes. In the case of a multicast MBS
session, the NRM clients have already joined the session.
2\. The VAL server invoke the multicast resource update request to the NRM
server once the need has emerged to modify some aspects for the given MBS
session under consideration. The updated parameters are included, e.g.,
service requirements, service area or both.
NOTE 1: The updated service area information is required for local MBS and for
broadcast MBS services.
3\. The NRM server, based on the update requirements from step 2, perform the
MBS session update with PCC procedure towards the 5GS as described in 3GPP TS
23.247 [29].
4\. The NRM server may initiate a session announcement towards the NRM clients
associated with the ongoing session in order to announce the updated
information if required, e.g., the updated service area or SDP information.
NOTE 2: The updated service area information is required for local MBS and for
broadcast MBS services.
5\. The NRM server sends an MapGroupToSessionStream over the MBS session
providing the required information to receive the media related to the
established VAL service group communication.
6\. The NRM server returns the multicast resource update resonse to the VAL
server.
7\. The NRM clients process the received information over the
MapGroupToSessionStream in order to receive the associated VAL media over the
specific MBS session stream.
8\. VAL client 1 sends media to the VAL server over unicast to be distributed
for the established group communication.
9\. The VAL server distributes the VAL media to the VAL clients 2 to n over
the indicated streams.
#### 14.3.4A.4 MBS resource deletion
##### 14.3.4A.4.1 General
The VAL server can decide to release a certain MBS session once it is no
longer further utilized for the associated VAL service group communication,
e.g., the VAL service group is no longer active, the VAL media transmission is
over and no further VAL media to be delivered, group communication is
terminated. The MBS session deletion procedure leads to releasing the network
resources associated to that MBS session.
NOTE: It is up to implementation of VALserver to decide whether to release the
MBS session or re-use it for subsequent group operations.
To delete the MBS session, the VAL server invokes the multicast/broadcast
resource release service of NRM server which further triggers the NRM server
to send an MBS session deletion request to the 5GS providing the corresponding
MBS session ID. The MBS session deletion request is sent to the MB-SMF
(directly or via NEF/MBSF) when PCC is not used. However, if dynamic PCC rule
is utilized, a policy authorization deletion request is initially sent to the
PCF. Further details of the MBS session deletion are provided in 3GPP TS
23.247 [39].
NRM server further informs the NRM client with the MBS session de-
announcement, so that the VAL UE stops monitoring the broadcast MBS session or
leaves the multicast MBS session. This procedure is applied for both broadcast
MBS session and multicast MBS session.
##### 14.3.4A.4.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 14.3.4A.4.2-1 describes the MBS session deletion
aspects for group communication.
Pre-conditions:
\- NRM clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to
the same active VAL service group.
\- An MBS session is configured to address the corresponding VAL service group
with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain
broadcast/multicast service area. The session is announced and established for
group communication purposes for the VAL service group.
{width="6.395033902012249in" height="3.84326990376203in"}
Figure 14.3.4A.4.2-1: MBS session deletion procedure.
1\. The VAL server decides to delete the MBS session for the associated VAL
group communication, either multicast or broadcast session.
2\. The VAL server invokes the multicast/broadcast resource release service of
the NRM server by sending the multicast/broadcast resource release request.
3\. Upon receiving the multicast/broadcast resource release request, the NRM
server sends an MBS session de-announcement message with the MBS session ID
towards the NRM client(s). Upon receiving the MBS session de-announcement
message, either 4a or 4b is performed.
4a. If the MBS session identified by MBS session ID is a broadcast MBS
session, the UE(s) stops monitoring the broadcast MBS session and removes the
broadcast MBS session related information.
4b. If the MBS session identified by MBS session ID is a multicast MBS
session, the joined UE(s) initiate an MBS session leave procedure to leave the
indicated MBS session in order to release the respective network resources, as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].
5\. Subsequently, the NRM clients may send an MBS session de-announcement
acknowledgement message to the NRM server indicating the status of MBS
session.
6\. The NRM server initiates the MBS session deletion procedure with the 5GC
(either directly or through NEF/MBSF) in order to stop using the configured
MBS session and release the corresponding network resources. The NRM server
indicates within the MBS session release request the corresponding MBS session
ID. The MBS session deletion procedure can either be with or without a dynamic
PCC rule, as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39].
7\. The NRM server returns the multicast/broadcast resource release response
to the VAL server indicating the result.
#### 14.3.4A.5 Request to activate / de-activate multicast MBS sessions
##### 14.3.4A.5.1 General
In case of multicast MBS sessions, the members affiliated to a certain VAL
service group need to initiate a UE session join request towards the 5GC in
order to receive the VAL media sent via the associated MBS session. The UE
session join request enables the reservation of NG-RAN resources for the
members of the VAL group. However, it is not necessary that the VAL media is
delivered over the whole time the multicast MBS session is associated to the
group under consideration. Therefore, the VAL server is able to efficiently
utilize and control the reservation of radio resources based on the
availability of VAL data to be delivered via the activation and de-activation
procedure with NRM server. This presents more flexibility and efficient use of
resources different from LTE.
The most suitable scenario to activate/de-activate a certain multicast MBS
session is based on whether there is a VAL group communication, taking place
over that associated session to the VAL service group. In this manner, the VAL
server can activate the associated multicast session once a VAL group
communication takes place, then deactivate it once the VAL group communication
is over. Whether the multicast session is activated (i.e., in an active
state), or de-activated (in an inactive state), the VAL group is associated to
the multicast session and its members are within a UE session join.
The activation or de-activation request is initiated by the VAL server towards
the NRM server which further interacts either directly with the MB-SMF or
indirectly with NEF/MBSF.
NOTE: The activation of de-activation procedure may also be triggered by MB-
SMF based on receiving notification from MB-UPF based on the availability of
VAL data to be transmitted.
##### 14.3.4A.5.2 Multicast MBS session activation procedure
The procedure shown in figure 14.3.4A.5.2-1 presents the multicast MBS session
activation procedure initiated by the VAL server.
Pre-conditions:
\- NRM clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same
VAL service group X.
\- The NRM server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF discovery
and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.
\- The multicast MBS session for NRM group communications associated to VAL
service group X.
\- The MBS session is created and announced to address VAL group communication
related to the associated VAL service group X with certain service
requirements and optionally with a certain service area.
{width="6.217972440944882in" height="3.45790135608049in"}
Figure 14.3.4A.5.2-1: Multicast MBS session activation procedure.
1\. The multicast MBS session is established as the first UE session join
request, which is initiated by the first VAL UE towards 5GC, is granted. At
this stage, the multicast MBS session is established with an inactive state.
2\. The VAL server decides to activate the multicast MBS session as VAL data
is needed to be transmitted over the session to the VAL service group X, as a
VAL group communication is to take place over the associated MBS session.
3\. The VAL server invokes the multicast resource activation request provided
by NRM server, the MBS session ID is included.
4\. Upon receiving the request in step 3, the NRM server sends an MBS session
activation request towards the 5GC, either directly to the MB-SMF or via
NEF/MBSF, indicating the TMGI to be activated.
5\. The 5GC changes the session status to \"active\" and finds the list of
joined VAL UEs associated with the session and activates the NG- RAN resources
for VAL data delivery.
6\. The 5GC may send an MBS session activation response to the NRM server
indicating that the requested multicast MBS session has been activated.
7\. The NRM server returns the multicast resource activation response to the
VAL server.
##### 14.3.4A.5.3 Multicast MBS session de-activation procedure
The procedure shown in figure 14.3.4A.5.3-1 presents the multicast MBS session
activation procedure initiated by the VAL server.
Pre-conditions:
\- NRM clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same
VAL service group X.
\- The NRM server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF discovery
and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally configured.
\- A multicast MBS session is created and announced to address the
corresponding VAL service group with certain service requirements and
optionally with a certain multicast service area.
\- The VAL UE have already joined the multicast MBS session and are able to
receive the VAL data over the associated MBS session.
{width="6.217972440944882in" height="3.45790135608049in"}
Figure 14.3.4A.5.3-1: Multicast MBS session deactivation procedure.
1\. The group communication associated with VAL service group X takes place,
and the corresponding VAL data is delivered over the associated multicast MBS
session, hence the MBS session has an active state.
2\. The VAL server decides to deactivate the multicast MBS session, as no
further VAL data to be delivered to the associated group, or the VAL group
communication is over, and no further VAL media is to be delivered.
3\. The VAL server invokes the multicast resource deactivation request
provided by NRM server, the MBS session ID is included.
4\. Upon receiving the request in step 3, the NRM server sends an MBS session
deactivation request towards the 5GC, either directly to the MB-SMF or via
NEF/MBSF, indicating the TMGI to be deactivated.
4\. The 5GC changes the session state to \"inactive\" and deactivates the
radio resources associated with the joined VAL UEs.
5\. The 5GC may send an MBS deactivation response to the server indicating
that the requested multicast MBS session has been inactivated.
7\. The NRM server may return the multicast resource deactivation response to
the VAL server.
#### 14.3.4A.6 VAL service group media transmissions over 5G MBS sessions
##### 14.3.4A.6.1 General
The VAL server can decide to configure an MBS session per VAL service group to
transmit the media related to the corresponding VAL group communications. Such
group communications can comprise different service requirements. For that,
multicast and broadcast MBS sessions need to be configured with multiple MBS
QoS flows to address different service requirements, e.g., different required
QoS, provided by the NRM server. For instance, application-level control
messages or media associated to a group communication can comprise different
QoS requirements. Also, different type of group communications can comprise
different QoS requirements, e.g., emergency group communication should be
handled with a higher priority than normal group communication.
The configuration of multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service
requirements is associated to the assignment of different streams (e.g.,
different ports) within an MBS session.
The established multicast MBS session can either be in active or inactive
state, where the former indicates the activation of radio resources hence
transmitting the VAL media to the associated VAL service group, and the latter
indicates their deactivation as no VAL media is being transmitted. The VAL
server may initiate the activation of multicast MBS sessions once the VAL
service group is established and active, as well as once the VAL media is
available for transmission. For this purpose, the VAL server sends a multicast
MBS session activation request towards the NRM indicating the MBS session ID
to be activated, and the NRM server further interacts with the 5GS to complete
the MBS session activation.
Similar to the use of eMBMS, the NRM server shall provide the associated
information between a specific group communication and the stream to be used
within an MBS session to the UE. This information could be sent in advance in
an MBS session announcement or could be provided on demand in an additional
signalling message for the MBS session, e.g., MapGroupToSessionStream (similar
to the MapGroupToBearer in eMBMS).
##### 14.3.4A.6.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 14.3.4A.6.2-1 describes how media related to a
specific group communication can be distributed over a configured MBS session
which consist of multiple QoS flows, i.e. addressing different service
requirements. The procedure is applicable for both the pre-created MBS session
case as described in 14.3.4A.2.2 and the dynamic MBS session case as described
in 14.3.4A.2.3. For simplicity, the figure 14.3.4A.6.2-1 shows that the MBS
session is pre-created prior to the group communication establishment.
Pre-conditions:
\- VAL UE 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and belong to the same
VAL service group X.
\- The VAL server has decided to use an MBS session for VAL service group
communications associated to VAL service group X.

NOTE: The VAL server can stop the unicast delivery (if ongoing) towards the
VAL clients considering the UE session join notification or the MBS listening
status report.
10\. The VAL server may initiate the multicast MBS session deactivation
towards the NRM as described in clause 14.3.4A.5, in order to deactivate the
multicast MBS session.
11\. The NRM server may further trigger the UE to leave multicast MBS session.
#### 14.3.4A.7 Aplication level control signalling over 5G MBS sessions
##### 14.3.4A.7.1 Description
The VAL server may use an 5G MBS session for application level control
signalling. An 5G MBS session for application level control signalling is
typically used for the purposes beyond the benefit for using 5G for resource
efficiency, e.g. for improved MC service performance (KPIs), handling of high
load scenarios.
Similar to the usage of eMBMS, both broadcast and multicast 5MBS session for
application level control signalling may be used to transmit the following
messages, for example:
\- MBS session announcement for media sessions
\- Group application paging
\- Group dynamic data (e.g. status of the group)
5G MBS session for application level control signalling is created in a
service area that is larger than the estimated service for media MBS session.
The service area for the media sessions is mainly based on counting of group
members in each defined service area. The MBS session for application level
control signalling is also created with a QoS that is better than MBS media
session since the packet loss requirements are much stricter.
The NRM client shall not send responses to group-addressed application level
control signalling unless instructed or configured to respond.
##### 14.3.4A.7.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 14.3.4A.7.2-1 shows only one of the receiving VAL UE
using a 5G MBS session.
{width="5.655543525809274in" height="3.4370702099737533in"}
Figure 14.3.4A.7.2-1: Use of 5G MBS for application-level control signalling
1\. The VAL server determines to create MBS session for application-level
control signalling, the VAL server initiated the 5G MBS session establishment
via the NRM is done according to clause 14.3.4A.2.
2\. The NRM server passes the 5G MBS session info for the service description
associated with the 5G MBS session to the NRM client. The NRM client obtains
the MBS session ID, from the service description.
NOTE: For 5G MBS and 4G MBMS co-existence, the MBMS bearers activation and MBS
session announcement are performed as specified in the procedure for pre-
created MBS session and session announcement.
3\. The NRM client stores the information associated with the MBS session ID.
The NRM client uses the MBS session ID and other 5G MBS session related
information to enable monitoring of the 5G MBS session by the VAL UE.
4\. Steps 4 to 6 defined in clause 14.3.4A.2 are performed.
5\. The VAL server transmits MC application control messages over the MBS
session.
#### 14.3.4A.8 Service continuity between 5G MBS delivery and unicast delivery
##### 14.3.4A.8.1 General
This clause addresses the issue of VAL data delivery over MBS session,
specifically, to maintain the service continuity when switching between 5G MBS
delivery and unicast delivery.
##### 14.3.4A.8.2 Service continuity for broadcast MBS session
###### 14.3.4A.8.2.1 General
This solution provides the procedure which allows the NRM client to report the
broadcast reception quality to the NRM server which is used to make the
decision whether to use the unicast delivery to the VAL UE(s) which are
suffering bad broadcast reception quality due to e.g., move out of the
broadcast service area.
An NRM client monitors the broadcast MBS session to receive VAL data. Based on
the received quality (e.g., radio level quality, RTP packet loss), the NRM
client needs to inform the NRM server that the NRM client is able to receive
the VAL data on the broadcast MBS session with sufficient quality or not.
This estimation of the broadcast reception quality may be dependent on, for
example, the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and measurements from the
reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), RTP packet loss, BLER of the
received VAL data.
###### 14.3.4A.8.2.2 Procedures
###### # 14.3.4A.8.2.2.1 Service continuity from broadcast to unicast
The procedure in figure 14.3.4A.8.2.2.1-1 illustrates the VAL UE which is
receiving VAL data via broadcast MBS session is switched to unicast delivery
because the VAL UE suffers from bad broadcast reception quality due to e.g.,
moving out of the broadcast service area. It shows only one of the receiving
VAL UEs receiving the broadcast MBS session.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL group communication is ongoing and the VAL data (e.g., DL media,
application layer control signalling) is transmitted via broadcast MBS
session.
2\. The NRM client is receiving the VAL data (e.g., DL media, application
layer control signalling) via the broadcast MBS session.
3\. The NRM client(s) already have the associated information (e.g., SDP) to
receive the unicast delivery during the group communication establishment
phase.
4\. An VAL group communication session is ongoing and the DL VAL data is
transmitted over broadcast MBS session.
Figure 14.3.4A.8.2.2.1-1: Service continuity from broadcast to unicast
1\. The NRM client detects that it suffers bad broadcast reception due to
e.g., moving out of the broadcast service area of the announced MBS session
ID. The NRM client may determine the broadcast reception quality by using the
BLER of the received media. When no media is received, the quality estimation
can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS).
2\. The NRM client sends MBS listening status report which indicates the
broadcast reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is not
sufficient to receive media. The NRM client may also map the determined
broadcast reception quality to a broadcast reception quality level. The
broadcast reception quality level indicates at which specific broadcast
reception quality level the VAL data has been received.
NOTE 1: It is implementation that the broadcast reception quality level can be
determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via
e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals
from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.
NOTE 2: The set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the
determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are implementation.
NOTE 3: The frequency of VAL UE sending listening reports can be limited to
prevent signalling congestion. E.g., the VAL UE can stop monitoring the
broadcast reception quality and send the MBS listening status report only once
when it moves outside of the broadcast service area.
3\. The NRM server based on the report from the participant, determines that
the UE is not able to receive the media or the QoS requirements is not
satisfied. The NRM server determines the VAL media (e.g., DL media,
application layer control signalling) needs to be delivered via the unicast
delivery to the reported NRM client.
4\. If the unicast QoS flow is not satisfied, the NRM server interacts with
the 5GC to update the QoS requirements.
5\. The NRM server informs the VAL server to send the VAL data via the unicast
delivery towards the reported NRM client by sending a user plane delivery mode
message.
6\. The NRM server sends the VAL media via the unicast delivery towards the
NRM client which suffers bad broadcast reception quality.
7\. The NRM client then receives the DL VAL data via both broadcast MBS
session and unicast delivery.
###### # 14.3.4A.8.2.2.2 Service continuity from unicast to broadcast
The procedure in figure 14.3.4A.8.2.2.2-1 illustrates the VAL UE receiving VAL
data via unicast delivery being switched to broadcast MBS session as the UE
enters the broadcast service area where the NG-RAN is broadcasting the VAL
media of the ongoing group communication. The VAL UE now is able to receive
the VAL data via the broadcast MBS session. Only one of the receiving VAL UEs
receiving the broadcast MBS session is shown.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL group communication is ongoing and the VAL data (e.g., DL media,
application layer control signalling) is transmitted via broadcast MBS session
in the broadcast service areas.
2\. The VAL UE is receiving the VAL data (e.g., DL media, application layer
control signalling) via the unicast delivery.
3\. The NRM client has already received the broadcast MBS session
announcement, MapVALGroupToSessionStream information and enters the broadcast
service area.
4\. A VAL group communication session is ongoing and the broadcast MBS session
is used by the VAL server to deliver the VAL data of the group communication.
The VAL UE is receiving the VAL data via the unicast delivery.
Figure 14.3.4A.8.2.2.2-1: Service continuity from unicast to broadcast
1\. The NRM client detects that it is able to receive the broadcast media due
to e.g., moving into the broadcast service area of the announced MBS session
ID. The NRM client may determine the broadcast reception quality by using the
BLER of the received media. When no media is received, the quality estimation
can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS).
2\. The NRM client sends MBS listening status report which indicates the
broadcast reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is sufficient
to receive VAL data. The NRM client may also map the determined broadcast
reception quality to a broadcast reception quality level. The broadcast
reception quality level indicates at which specific broadcast reception
quality level the VAL data has been received.
NOTE 1: The set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the
determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are up to
implementation.
NOTE 2: It is up to implementation that the broadcast reception quality level
can be determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level
via e.g., measurements of radio level signals, such as the reference signals
from the NG-RAN node(s), or packet loss.
3\. The NRM server determines the VAL UE is able to receive the VAL data via
the the broadcast MBS session, and the NRM server sends a user plane delivery
mode to the VAL server indicating to stop the unicast delivery.
4\. Based on the MapVALGroupToSessionStream received before, the NRM client
receives the DL VAL data via both the broadcast MBS session and the unicast
delivery.
NOTE 3: If any information about the broadcast MBS session stream has changed,
the NRM server provides the MapVALGroupToSessionStream again.
5\. The VAL server, based on the user plane delivery mode message, determines
to stop sending the VAL data (e.g., DL media, application layer control
signalling) via the unicast delivery to the reporting NRM client. After then,
the NRM client receives the VAL data only via the broadcast MBS session.
##### 14.3.4A.8.3 Service continuity for multicast MBS session
##### 14.3.4A.8.3.1 General {#a.8.3.1-general .H6}
The NRM server may also switch between multicast and unicast by utilizing
application layer mechanisms similar to switching between broadcast and
unicast as specified in clause 14.3.4A.8.2. If indicated in the MBS session
announcement information, the NRM client reports the monitoring state (i.e.,
the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the NRM server.
NOTE: Once the VAL UE has successfully joined the multicast MBS session and
started to receive the VAL data via the multicast MBS session, then the
network mechanism specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39] will deliver the media from
the NRM server via the 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method or the 5GC
Shared MBS traffic delivery method towards the VAL UE(s). The usage of 5GC
Individual MBS traffic delivery method or the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery
method is transparent to the NRM server and VAL server.
#### 14.3.4A.9 Service continuity between 5G MBS delivery and unicast delivery
##### 14.3.4A.9.1 General
This clause addresses the issue of VAL data delivery over MBS session,
specifically, to maintain the service continuity when switching between 5G MBS
delivery and unicast delivery.
##### 14.3.4A.9.2 Service continuity for broadcast MBS session
###### 14.3.4A.9.2.1 General
This solution provides the procedure which allows the NRM client to report the
broadcast reception quality to the NRM server which is used to make the
decision whether to use the unicast delivery to the VAL UE(s) which are
suffering bad broadcast reception quality due to e.g., move out of the
broadcast service area.
An NRM client monitors the broadcast MBS session to receive VAL data. Based on
the received quality (e.g., radio level quality, RTP packet loss), the NRM
client needs to inform the NRM server that the NRM client is able to receive
the VAL data on the broadcast MBS session with sufficient quality or not.
This estimation of the broadcast reception quality may be dependent on, for
example, the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and measurements from the
reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), RTP packet loss, BLER of the
received VAL data.
###### 14.3.4A.9.2.2 Procedures
###### # 14.3.4A.9.2.2.1 Service continuity from broadcast to unicast
The procedure in figure 14.3.4A.9.2.2.1-1 illustrates the VAL UE which is
receiving VAL data via broadcast MBS session is switched to unicast delivery
because the VAL UE suffers from bad broadcast reception quality due to e.g.,
moving out of the broadcast service area. It shows only one of the receiving
VAL UEs receiving the broadcast MBS session.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL group communication is ongoing and the VAL data (e.g., DL media,
application layer control signalling) is transmitted via broadcast MBS
session.
2\. The NRM client is receiving the VAL data (e.g., DL media, application
layer control signalling) via the broadcast MBS session.
3\. The NRM client(s) already have the associated information (e.g., SDP) to
receive the unicast delivery during the group communication establishment
phase.
4\. An VAL group communication session is ongoing and the DL VAL data is
transmitted over broadcast MBS session.
Figure 14.3.4A.9.2.2.1-1: Service continuity from broadcast to unicast
1\. The NRM client detects that it suffers bad broadcast reception due to
e.g., moving out of the broadcast service area of the announced MBS session
ID. The NRM client may determine the broadcast reception quality by using the
BLER of the received media. When no media is received, the quality estimation
can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS).
2\. The NRM client sends MBS listening status report which indicates the
broadcast reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is not
sufficient to receive media. The NRM client may also map the determined
broadcast reception quality to a broadcast reception quality level. The
broadcast reception quality level indicates at which specific broadcast
reception quality level the VAL data has been received.
NOTE 1: It is implementation that the broadcast reception quality level can be
determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via
e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals
from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.
NOTE 2: The set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the
determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are implementation.
NOTE 3: The frequency of VAL UE sending listening reports can be limited to
prevent signalling congestion. E.g., the VAL UE can stop monitoring the
broadcast reception quality and send the MBS listening status report only once
when it moves outside of the broadcast service area.
3\. The NRM server based on the report from the participant, determines that
the UE is not able to receive the media or the QoS requirements is not
satisfied. The NRM server determines the VAL media (e.g., DL media,
application layer control signalling) needs to be delivered via the unicast
delivery to the reported NRM client.
4\. If the unicast QoS flow is not satisfied, the NRM server interacts with
the 5GC to update the QoS requirements.
5\. The NRM server informs the VAL server to send the VAL data via the unicast
delivery towards the reported NRM client by sending a user plane delivery mode
message.
6\. The NRM server sends the VAL media via the unicast delivery towards the
NRM client which suffers bad broadcast reception quality.
7\. The NRM client then receives the DL VAL data via both broadcast MBS
session and unicast delivery.
###### # 14.3.4A.9.2.2.2 Service continuity from unicast to broadcast
The procedure in figure 14.3.4A.8.2.2.2-1 illustrates the VAL UE receiving VAL
data via unicast delivery being switched to broadcast MBS session as the UE
enters the broadcast service area where the NG-RAN is broadcasting the VAL
media of the ongoing group communication. The VAL UE now is able to receive
the VAL data via the broadcast MBS session. Only one of the receiving VAL UEs
receiving the broadcast MBS session is shown.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL group communication is ongoing and the VAL data (e.g., DL media,
application layer control signalling) is transmitted via broadcast MBS session
in the broadcast service areas.
2\. The VAL UE is receiving the VAL data (e.g., DL media, application layer
control signalling) via the unicast delivery.
3\. The NRM client has already received the broadcast MBS session
announcement, MapVALGroupToSessionStream information and enters the broadcast
service area.
4\. A VAL group communication session is ongoing and the broadcast MBS session
is used by the VAL server to deliver the VAL data of the group communication.
The VAL UE is receiving the VAL data via the unicast delivery.
Figure 14.3.4A.9.2.2.2-1: Service continuity from unicast to broadcast
1\. The NRM client detects that it is able to receive the broadcast media due
to e.g., moving into the broadcast service area of the announced MBS session
ID. The NRM client may determine the broadcast reception quality by using the
BLER of the received media. When no media is received, the quality estimation
can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS).
2\. The NRM client sends MBS listening status report which indicates the
broadcast reception quality associated with the MBS session ID is sufficient
to receive VAL data. The NRM client may also map the determined broadcast
reception quality to a broadcast reception quality level. The broadcast
reception quality level indicates at which specific broadcast reception
quality level the VAL data has been received.
NOTE 1: The set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the
determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are up to
implementation.
NOTE 2: It is up to implementation that the broadcast reception quality level
can be determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level
via e.g., measurements of radio level signals, such as the reference signals
from the NG-RAN node(s), or packet loss.
3\. The NRM server determines the VAL UE is able to receive the VAL data via
the the broadcast MBS session, and the NRM server sends a user plane delivery
mode to the VAL server indicating to stop the unicast delivery.
4\. Based on the MapVALGroupToSessionStream received before, the NRM client
receives the DL VAL data via both the broadcast MBS session and the unicast
delivery.
NOTE 3: If any information about the broadcast MBS session stream has changed,
the NRM server provides the MapVALGroupToSessionStream again.
5\. The VAL server, based on the user plane delivery mode message, determines
to stop sending the VAL data (e.g., DL media, application layer control
signalling) via the unicast delivery to the reporting NRM client. After then,
the NRM client receives the VAL data only via the broadcast MBS session.
##### 14.3.4A.9.3 Service continuity for multicast MBS session
##### 14.3.4A.9.3.1 General {#a.9.3.1-general .H6}
The NRM server may also switch between multicast and unicast by utilizing
application layer mechanisms similar to switching between broadcast and
unicast as specified in clause 14.3.4A.9.2. If indicated in the MBS session
announcement information, the NRM client reports the monitoring state (i.e.,
the reception quality of the MBS session) back to the NRM server.
NOTE: Once the VAL UE has successfully joined the multicast MBS session and
started to receive the VAL data via the multicast MBS session, then the
network mechanism specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [39] will deliver the media from
the NRM server via the 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery method or the 5GC
Shared MBS traffic delivery method towards the VAL UE(s). The usage of 5GC
Individual MBS traffic delivery method or the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery
method is transparent to the NRM server and VAL server.
#### 14.3.4A.10 VAL service inter-system switching between 5G and LTE
##### 14.3.4A.10.1 General
The VAL server delivers the VAL data to the VAL UE(s) without being aware of
the mobility of the VAL UE with the assistance and guidance of the NRM server.
When working in transport only mode, the NRM server guides the NRM clients
throughout the VAL data transmission for switching between the LTE and 5G
systems. For this purpose, the location management client may send location
related information to the location management server, similar to the one
defined in clause 9, which is triggered due to its location change -- in this
case due to Radio Access Technology (RAT) change, to inform the NRM server
hence the latter provides guidance related to how to receive the VAL data
after the location update.
The procedures cover both the deployment scenarios with/without MBSF/MBSTF.
The procedures specify four inter-system switching related scenarios as
follows:
1\. Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS bearer, as in
14.3.4A.10.2
2\. Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast bearer, as in
14.3.4A.10.3
3\. Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G MBS session, as in
14.3.4A.10.4
4\. Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G unicast PDU session, as in
14.3.4A.10.5
In all the inter-system switching related scenario described in 14.3.4A.10.2,
14.3.4A.10.3, 14.3.4A.10.4 and 14.3.4A.10.5, the functional entity that
resides in 5GS may be NEF, or MBSF, or MB-SMF for session creation and
together with PCF or PCC related interaction.
NOTE: There will be a service interruption when the VAL server performs path
switch between 5G and LTE bearers or sessions.
##### 14.3.4A.10.2 Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS
bearer
The procedure provided in figure 14.3.4A.10.2-1 describes how the NRM server
handles inter-system switching when the VAL UE switches from 5G to LTE
network, where the NRM server is able to provide the VAL data to the clients
over eMBMS bearer(s).
Pre-conditions:
\- NRM clients are attached to the 5GS, registered.
\- The VAL service can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.
\- The NRM client(s) is within the eMBMS service area.
\- It is assumed that the NRM client(s) has not received the eMBMS bearer
announcement while camping in 5GS.
Figure 14.3.4A.10.2-1: Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS
bearer.
1\. An VAL group communication takes place, and the VAL data is delivered over
5G MBS session (either broadcast or multicast session mode), which is
associated to the VAL group X.
2\. The VAL UE performs handover to EPS.
3\. Location information indicating the RAT change from the VAL UE is provided
to the NRM server. VAL UE`s location information is provided via the location
management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server,
where the latter provides the location information to the NRM server. Also,
location information handling can be based on notifications provided from the
network to the NRM server related to 5GS supporting EPS interworking, as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10], 3GPP TS 23.502 [11], and 3GPP TS 23.503
[12]. For that, the NRM server can subscribe to receive notifications of
specific events from the network. For instance, the NRM server can subscribe
to PCF related notifications (via N5 or Rx) for specific events, e.g., access
network information notification and change of access type. Also, when
SCEF+NEF is deployed, the NRM server can subscribe to SCEF+NEF related
notifications for specific events, e.g., core network (CN) type change.
4\. The NRM server analyses the RAT change and decides how to deliver the DL
VAL data. If the NRM server decides to serve the client via eMBMS bearer, it
may send an eMBMS bearer announcement. This step is optional as the bearer
announcement related information could be sent in advance (implementation
specific).
5\. If not already available, the NRM client stores the announced TMGI(s),
service area, and any relevant information to the eMBMS, which is delivered
via the bearer announcement. As a result, the NRM client starts monitoring the
bearer.
6\. The NRM server may inform the VAL server to stop sending DL VAL data via
the MBS by sending the user plane delivery mode message, e.g., when the last
UE leaves the MBS session or move out of the MBS service area.
7\. The NRM client sends an eMBMS listening status report to inform the server
of its ability of receiving DL VAK data over the specified bearer.
8\. The NRM server sends the necessary information related to receiving the DL
VAL data in the form of the MapGroupToBearer.
9\. The NRM server may inform the VAL server to start sending DL VAL data via
the eMBMS by sending the user plane delivery mode message, e.g., the first
UE(s) enters the eMBMS service area.
10\. The VAL group communication takes place over EPS, and the VAL data is
transmitted over an eMBMS bearer.
##### 14.3.4A.10.3 Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast
bearer
The procedure provided in figure 14.3.4A.10.3-1 describes how the NRM server
handles inter-system switching when the VAL UE switches from 5G to LTE
network, where the VAL server is unable to provide the VAL services to the VAL
UE over eMBMS bearer.
Pre-conditions:
\- NRM clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to the same
VAL group X.
\- The VAL services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.
Figure 14.3.4A.10.3-1: Inter-system switching from 5G MBS session to LTE
unicast bearer.
1\. An VAL group communication takes place, and the VAL data is delivered over
5G MBS session (either broadcast or multicast session mode), which is
associated to the VAL group X.
2\. The VAL UE performs handover to EPS.
3\. Location information indicating the RAT change from the VAL UE is provided
to the NRM server. VAL UE`s location information is provided via the location
management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server,
where the latter provides the location information to the NRM server.
Also, location information handling can be based on notifications provided
from the network to the NRM server related to 5GS supporting EPS interworking,
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10], 3GPP TS 23.502 [11], and 3GPP TS 23.503
[12]. For that, the NRM server can subscribe to receive notifications of
specific events from the network. For instance, the NRM server can subscribe
to PCF related notifications (via N5 or Rx) for specific events, e.g. access
network information notification and change of access type. Also, when
SCEF+NEF is deployed, the NRM server can subscribe to SCEF+NEF related
notifications for specific events, e.g. core network (CN) type change.
4\. The NRM server may inform the VAL server to stop sending DL VAL data via
the MBS by sending the user plane delivery mode message, e.g., when the last
UE leaves the MBS session or move out of the MBS service area.
5\. The NRM server may interact with the EPC for providing the required media
resources over the unicast bearer, if not already allocated.
6\. The NRM server informs the VAL server to send DL VAL data to the VAL UE
via the LTE unicast bearer by sending the user plane delivery mode message.
7\. The VAL group communication takes place over EPS, and the DL VAL data is
transmitted over a LTE unicast bearer.
##### 14.3.4A.10.4 Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G MBS session
The procedure provided in figure 14.3.4A.10.4-1 describes how the NRM server
handles inter-system switching when the VAL UE switches from LTE network to
5G, where the NRM server is able to provide the VAL services to the client
over 5G MBS sessions (either broadcast or multicast).
Pre-conditions:
\- NRM clients are attached to the EPC.
\- The VAL services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.
\- The NRM client(s) is within the service area (if the session is limited to
an area), where the MBS session is configured.
\- It is assumed that the NRM client(s) has not received the 5G MBS session
announcement while camping in EPS.
Figure 14.3.4A.10.4-1: Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS bearer to 5G MBS
sessions (either broadcast or multicast).
1\. An VAL group communication takes place, and the DL VAL data is delivered
over eMBMS bearer, which is associated to the VAL group X.
2\. The VAL UE performs handover to 5GS.
3\. Location information indicating the RAT change from the VAL UE is provided
to the NRM server. VAL UE`s location information is provided via the location
management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server,
where the latter provides the location information to the NRM server.
Also, location information handling can be based on notifications provided
from the network to the NRM server related to 5GS supporting EPS interworking,

SCEF+NEF is deployed, the NRM server can subscribe to SCEF+NEF related
notifications for specific events, e.g., core network (CN) type change.
4\. The NRM server analyses the RAT change and decides how to deliver the DL
VAL data. If the NRM server decides to serve the client via 5G MBS session, it
may send an MBS session announcement indicating information among others the
session mode to serve the NRM client and the corresponding MBS session ID.
This step is optional as the session announcement related information could be
sent in advance (implementation specific).
5\. The VAL UE acts according to the MBS session mode provided to receive the
DL media.
5a. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the VAL UE performs a UE session join
towards the 5GC indicating the MBS session ID to join. It may as well send a
UE session join acknowledgement to the NRM server.
5b. In case of broadcast MBS sessions, the VAL UE starts monitoring the
broadcast MBS session. 6. The NRM server may inform the VAL server to stop
sending DL VAL data via the eMBMS bearer by sending the user plane delivery
mode message, e.g., when the last UE moves out of the MBMS service area.
7\. The NRM client sends an MBS listening status report to the server
indicating its ability to receive media over the indicated MBS session.
8\. The NRM server sends a MapVALGroupToSessionStream over the MBS session
providing the required stream information to receive the media related to the
group communication.
9\. The NRM client processes the received information related to the DL VAL
data over the MBS session.
10\. The NRM server may inform the VAL server to start sending DL VAL data via
the 5G MBS session by sending the user plane delivery mode message, e.g., the
first UE(s) enters the MBS service area or joins the multicast MBS session.
11\. The VAL group communication takes place over 5GS, and the DL VAL data is
delivered over the broadcast or multicast MBS session.
14.3.4A.10.5 Inter-system switching from LTE eMBMS to 5G unicast PDU session
The procedure provided in figure 14.3.4A.10.5-1 describes how the NRM server

the eMBMS bearer by sending the user plane delivery mode message, e.g., when
the last UE moves out of the LTE MBMS service area.
5\. The NRM server may interact with the 5GC to request media resources (if
not already allocated) with specific requirements over unicast PDU session, as
it is able to serve the NRM client via unicast PDU session.
6\. The NRM server informs the VAL server to send DL VAL data to the VAL UE
via the PDU session by sending the user plane delivery mode message.
7\. The VAL group communication takes place over 5GS, and the VAL data is
delivered over unicast PDU session.
### 14.3.5 QoS/resource management for network-assisted UE-to-UE/VN group
communications
#### 14.3.5.1 General
This feature provides the SEAL NRM support for coordinated QoS/resource
management for network assisted UE-to-UE communications. Such capability may
be required for guaranteeing end-to-end QoS fulfilment (primarily for meeting
end-to-end latency requirements) in network assisted UE to UE communications
and may accommodate various vertical-specific application services, e.g.:
\- Network-assisted Command and Control (C2) communications in UASAPP [TS
23.255], where the UAV controller navigates its UAV over the 5GS;
\- Teleoperated Driving (ToD) in eV2XAPP [TS 23.286], where the a V2X UE
acting as server may remotely control a further V2X UE over the 5GS;
\- Network-assisted Device-to-Device communications in Factory of the Future
(FF) use cases, such as control-to-control communications.
\- 5G LAN-Type communication within a 5G VN group as specified in 3GPP TS
23.501 [10].
#### 14.3.5.2 QoS/resource management capability initiation in network
assisted UE-to-UE communications
This procedure provides a mechanism for initiating the capability at the NRM
server for managing the end-to-end application QoS requirement fulfilment for
a network-assisted VAL UE to VAL UE session (comprising a PDU session for each
of the constituent links, e.g. VAL UE 1 to PLMN, and PLMN to VAL UE 2). **The
request may come from NRM client of either of the VAL UEs within the service
and will trigger the end-to-end QoS/resource management by the NRM server. The
triggering the end-to-end QoS management request can be initiated by the VAL
application at the VAL UE, and the conditions may depend on the requirements
of the VAL service, e.g. for UAS such triggering may be needed when a UAV is
in-flight, or for V2X such trigger may be initiated when a controlled VAL UE
enters an urban area, or for 5G LAN-type service such trigger may be initiated
by the AF (e.g. on VAL UE1) that manages the corresponding 5G VN group.**
The clause 14.3.5.2.1 describes the end-to-end QoS/resource management
capability for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications for a single pair of
UEs.
The clause 14.3.5.2.2 describes the end-to-end QoS/resource management
capability for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications for a group of UEs.
##### 14.3.5.2.1 Procedure for a single pair of UEs
Figure 14.3.5.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure where the NRM server is
initiating the end-to-end QoS/resource management capability for network-
assisted UE-to-UE communications for a single pair of UEs.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NRM client is connected to the NRM server.
2\. The VAL UEs involved in the end-to-end session (VAL UE 1 and VAL UE 2) are
connected to one or more PLMNs and have ongoing PDU sessions.
3\. NRM server has used the \"Setting up an AF session with required QoS
procedure\" (clause 4.15.6.6 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [11]).
Figure 14.3.5.2.1-1 end-to-end QoS management request / response
1\. The NRM client 1 (of VAL UE 1) sends to the NRM server an end-to-end QoS
management request for managing the QoS for the end-to-end application
session.
2\. The NRM server configures the application QoS parameters by decomposing
the end-to-end QoS requirements (VAL UE 1 to VAL UE 2) to application QoS
parameters for each individual session (e.g. network session for VAL UE 1 -and
network session for VAL UE 2) which are part of the end-to-end application
session.
3\. The NRM server sends to the NRM client 1 an end-to-end QoS management
response with a positive or negative acknowledgement of the request.
4\. The NRM server may also send a notification to NRM client 2 (of VAL UE 2)
to inform about the end-to-end QoS management initiation by the NRM server.
##### 14.3.5.2.2 Procedure for a group of UEs
Figure 14.3.5.2.2 illustrates the procedure where the NRM server is initiating
the end-to-end QoS/resource management capability for network-assisted UE-to-
UE communications for a group of UEs.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NRM client is connected to the NRM server.
2\. The VAL UEs involved in the end-to-end session (VAL UE 1 and a group of
VAL UEs) are connected to one or more PLMNs and have ongoing PDU sessions.
Note : The NRM client2 (of VAL UE 2) can be any VAL UEs in the group of VAL
UEs.
Figure 14.3.5.2.2 end-to-end QoS management request / response for a group of
UEs
1\. The NRM server receives from the AF on NRM client 1 (of VAL UE 1) the end-
to-end QoS management request for managing the QoS on UE-to-UE traffic for a
group of UEs.
2\. The NRM server retrieves from 5GC or subscribe to 5GC to obtain additional
VAL-UE associated information for each member in the group identified by the
VAL group ID, which is account for decomposition**. The** VAL-UE associated
information **could be** from the 5GC (**NEF Monitoring Events as in 3GPP TS
23.502 [11], QoS sustainability analytics as in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34]) or SEAL
LMS (on demand location reporting).**
3\. The NRM server configures the application QoS parameters by decomposing
the end-to-end QoS requirements (UE-to-UE traffic for any two UEs in a group)
to application QoS parameters for each individual session (uplink network
session for ingress group member and downlink network session for egress group
member). The NRM server needs to take the additional VAL-UE associated
information into account for evaluation during such decomposition.
4\. The NRM/SEAL server, acting as AF, sends to the 5GC a \"Procedures for AF
requested QoS for a UE or group of UEs not identified by a UE address\" to set
the application QoS parameters respectively for uplink network session for
each ingress group member in the group and for downlink network session for
egress group member.
Additionally, the NRM/SEAL server may activate monitoring of the performance
to receive QoS monitoring event notifications from 5GC by setting the
(optionally with Alternative QoS Profiles) in the request, in this case the AF
may receive the QoS downgrade notification for e.g. latency thus to initiate
the NRM-assisted coordinated QoS provisioning for 5G LAN-Type communication in
clause 14.3.5.3.x
5\. The NRM server sends to the NRM client 1an end-to-end QoS management
response with a positive or negative acknowledgement of the request.
6\. If the NRF server receives the end-to-end QoS management request including
VAL UE2 as any of the List of VAL UEs, then the NRM server may also send a
notification to NRM client 2 (of VAL UE 2) to inform about the end-to-end QoS
management initiation by the NRM server.
#### 14.3.5.3 Procedure for coordinated QoS provisioning operation in network
assisted UE-to-UE communications
This procedure provides a mechanism for ensuring the end-to-end application
QoS requirement fulfilment for the application service (which is between two
or more VAL UEs), considering that the QoS of one of the links may downgrade.
**It is assumed that the application session is ongoing, and both the source
and target VAL UEs are connected to 3GPP network (the same or different). The
communication between the VAL UEs is assumed to be in-direct / network-
assisted; hence two PDU sessions are established respectively (one per VAL
UE).**
The clause 14.3.5.2.1 describes the end-to-end QoS/resource management
capability for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications for a single pair of
UEs.
The clause 14.3.5.2.2 describes the end-to-end QoS/resource management
capability for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications for a group of UEs.
##### 14.3.5.3.1 Procedure for a single pair of UEs
Figure 14.3.5.3.1-1 illustrates the procedure where the NRM server supports
the coordinated QoS provisioning for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications
for a single pair of UEs.
Pre-conditions:
1\. NRM server has activated the end-to-end QoS/resource management
capability, as described in 14.3.5.2.1
2\. NRM server, acting as AF, has registered to receive QoS monitoring event
notifications from 5GC and notifications from VAL UEs (from both UEs), as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
Figure 14.3.5.3.1-1: NRM-assisted coordinated QoS provisioning for C2
communication
1a. A QoS downgrade trigger event is sent from the NRM client of the VAL UE 1
to the NRM server, denoting an application QoS degradation (experienced or
expected) e.g. based on the experienced packet delay or packet loss for the Uu
link (e.g. packet loss great than threshold value). **The conditions for
triggering the QoS downgrade indication from the NRM client is based on the
threshold that may be provided in advance by the NRM server (at the** end-to-
end QoS management response **by the NRM server in** 14.3.5.2.1**).**
1b. Alternatively, the NRM server receives a trigger event from the 5GC
(SMF/NEF), denoting a QoS downgrade notification for the VAL UE 1 session.
(described in clause 5.7.2.4.1b of 3GPP TS 23.501 [10]).
2\. The NRM server evaluates the fulfilment/non-fulfilment of the end-to-end
QoS based on the trigger event. NRM server may retrieve additional information
**based on subscription to support its evaluation. This could be** from the
5GC (**NEF Monitoring Events as in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11], QoS sustainability
analytics as in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34]) or SEAL LMS (on demand location reporting
for one or both VAL UEs 1 and 2).**
Then, the NRM server, determines an action, which is the QoS parameter
adaptation of one or both links (QoS profile downgrade for the link receive
QoS notification control, and QoS upgrade for the link which can be upgraded).
3\. The NRM/SEAL server, acting as AF, sends to the 5GC (to SMF via NEF or to
PCF via N5) a request for a change of the QoS profile mapped to the one or
both network sessions (for VAL UE 1 and UE 2) or the update of the PCC rules
to apply the new traffic policy (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] in clause
4.15.6.6a: AF session with required QoS update procedure).
4\. The NRM server sends an application QoS change notification to the
affected NRM clients, to inform on the adaptation of the QoS requirements for
the individual session.
##### 14.3.5.3.2 Procedure for a group of UEs
Figure 14.3.5.3.2 illustrates the procedure where the NRM server supports the
coordinated QoS provisioning for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications.
Pre-conditions:
1\. NRM server has activated the end-to-end QoS/resource management
capability, as described in 14.3.5.2.1
2\. NRM server, acting as AF, has registered to receive QoS monitoring event
notifications from 5GC and notifications from VAL UEs (from any UEs in a
group), as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
Figure 14.3.5.3.2-1: NRM-assisted coordinated QoS provisioning for 5G LAN-Type
communication
1\. The NRM server receives a trigger event from the 5GC (SMF/NEF), denoting a
QoS downgrade notification for the network session of any group member in a
group. (described in clause 5.7.2.4.1b of 3GPP TS 23.501 [10]).
2\. The NRM server evaluates the fulfilment/non-fulfilment of the end-to-end
QoS based on the trigger event. NRM server may retrieve additional information
based on subscription to support its evaluation. This could be from the 5GC
(NEF Monitoring Events as in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11], QoS sustainability analytics
as in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34]) or SEAL LMS (on demand location reporting for one
or both VAL UEs 1 and 2).
Then, the NRM server, determines an action, which is the QoS parameter
adaptation of only uplink/downlink network session or both uplink and downlink
network sessions for each ingress group member in the group.
3\. The NRM/SEAL server, acting as AF, sends to the 5GC (to SMF via NEF or to
PCF via N5) a request for a change of the QoS profile mapped to the impacted
network sessions or the update of the PCC rules to apply the new traffic
policy (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] in clause 4.15.6.14: AF requested
QoS for a UE or group of UEs not identified by a UE address procedure).
4\. The NRM server sends an application QoS change notification to the
affected NRM clients, to inform on the adaptation of the QoS requirements for
the individual session.
### 14.3.6 Event Monitoring
#### 14.3.6.1 General
The VAL server utilizes the NRM server for monitoring the events related to
its VAL UEs and receive the event reports. The NRM server shall subscribe to
multiple core network services to fetch all the required events related to the
multiple VAL UEs served by the VAL server and report the same to the VAL
server with the event details.
To monitor and report the events related to the VAL UE from the 3GPP core
network, the NRM server shall use the Monitoring Events procedures as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11].
To monitor and report the analytics events related to the VAL UE, the NRM
server shall use the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34].
#### 14.3.6.2 Monitoring Events Subscription Procedure
##### 14.3.6.2.1 General
The VAL server subscribes to the NRM server to monitor the events related to
VAL UE(s). Based on the VAL server request, the NRM server consumes the
relevant core network services to receive the events related to the VAL UE(s).
The related procedure is illustrated in the next clause.
##### 14.3.6.2.2 Procedure
The procedure for VAL server subscribing to the NRM server, to monitor the VAL
UE(s) related events is described in figure 14.3.6.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The NRM server is authorized to consume the core network services
(Monitoring events as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and Analytics services
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34]);
Figure 14.3.6.2.2-1: Monitoring Events Subscription Procedure
1\. The VAL server sends Monitoring Events Subscription request to the NRM
server, requesting the NRM server to monitor the events related to the VAL
UE(s) as per the subscription request, and shall include the information
related to the events that the VAL server is interested in.
2\. The NRM server shall check if the VAL server is authorized to initiate the
Monitoring Events Subscription request and if authorized, shall respond with
Monitoring Events Subscription Response message, indicating the successful
subscription status along with subscription information to the VAL server. The
VAL service ID may be used by the NRM server to derive event specific
information in 3GPP core network services (e.g. QoS requirement in analytics
event subscription), based on e.g. local configuration. The NRM server maps
the VAL group ID (if received) to the External Group ID known to the 3GPP core
network.
NOTE: The mapping between Monitoring profile ID and event details in the NRM
server can be pre-configured and/or dynamically built based on VAL server
request with explicitly sent event details, which is implementation specific.
3\. Based on the events of interest information in the subscription request
message, if applicable, the NRM server shall subscribe to the UE monitoring
events (LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY, COMMUNICATION_FAILURE, etc.) for the set of UEs
(VAL UEs) in the subscription request, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11].
4\. Based on the events of interest information in the subscription request
message, if applicable, the NRM server shall subscribe to the UE analytics
events (like ABNORMAL_BEHAVIOUR etc.) for the set of UEs (VAL UEs) in the
subscription request, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34].
#### 14.3.6.3 Monitoring Events Notification Procedure
##### 14.3.6.3.1 General
The NRM server receives the events related to VAL UE(s) from the 3GPP core
network. The NRM server reports the monitoring events information to the VAL
server.
##### 14.3.6.3.2 Procedure
The procedure for NRM server notifying the VAL server with VAL UE(s) related
events is described in figure 14.3.6.3.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The VAL server has subscribed with NRM server using Monitoring Events
Subscription Procedure as specified in clause 14.3.6.2;
Figure 14.3.6.3.2-1: Monitoring Events Notification Procedure
1\. If applicable, the NRM server receives the VAL UE related monitoring event
notifications from the 3GPP core network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11].
2\. If applicable, the NRM server receives the VAL UE related Analytics event
notifications from the 3GPP core network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34].
3\. The NRM server notifies the VAL server about the events related to the VAL
UE in Notify Monitorng Events message. If multiple events are to be notified,
then the NRM server may aggregate the notifications and send to the VAL
server.
### 14.3.7 5G TSC resource management procedures
#### 14.3.7.1 General
The procedures related to the 5G TSC network resource management are described
in the following subclauses.
#### 14.3.7.2 TSC stream availability discovery procedure
The TSC stream availability discovery procedure is used by the VAL server to
discover the availability of resources for TSC communication for the given
stream specification (i.e., between the target UEs) prior to creating the
stream.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Each UE has an established Ethernet PDU session and DS-TTs are connected
to the 5GS TSC bridge. The traffic classes are configured on each DS-TT.
2\. The NRM server has collected the 5GS TSC bridge management and port
management information. The latter is related to the Ethernet ports located in
the DS-TTs including bridge delay per DS-TT Ethernet port pair per traffic
class.
3\. NRM server has calculated the bridge delay for each port pair, i.e.
composed of (ingress DS-TT Ethernet port, egress DS-TT Ethernet port)
including the UE-DS-TT residence time, packet delay budget (PDB) and
propagation delay for both UL from sender UE and DL to receiver UE.
Figure 14.3.7.2-1: TSC stream availability discovery procedure
1\. The NRM server receives a request from a VAL server on NRM-S reference
point to discover the connectivity and available QoS characteristics between
DS-TTs identified by the stream specification.
2\. The NRM server validates the connectivity between the DS-TTs connected in
the same 5GS TSC bridge based on the collected 5GS TSC bridge management and
port management information, identifies the traffic classes supported by the
DS-TTs and determines the end-to-end latency (including the UE-DS-TT residence
times, PDBs and propagation delay).
3\. NRM server responds to the VAL server with the stream specification and a
list of traffic specifications with the available end-to-end latency and the
traffic classes supported by the DS-TTs.
#### 14.3.7.3 TSC stream creation procedure
This procedure allows the VAL server to create a TSC stream. The TSC stream
creation procedure enables the VAL server to establish TSC connectivity with
the required QoS between the UEs connected to the 5GS after the stream
discovery procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Each UE has an established Ethernet PDU session for its DS-TT port MAC
address.
2\. Connectivity between the DS-TTs has been validated by the TSC stream
availability discovery procedure specified in clause 14.3.7.2.
3\. The NRM server maintains mapping from the traffic class to TSC QoS.
Figure 14.3.7.3-1: TSC stream creation procedure
1\. The NRM server receives a TSC stream creation request from a VAL server to
create a TSC stream identified by a VAL Stream ID, between DS-TT ports in the
stream specification and for the traffic class in the traffic specification.
2\. The NRM server calculates the schedule for the VAL Stream ID based on the
information collected earlier from the 5GS via N5. It provides per-stream
filtering and policing parameters (e.g. as defined in IEEE 802.1Q [36]) used
to derive the TSC QoS information and related flow information. NRM server
also provides the forwarding rule (e.g. as defined in IEEE 802.1Q [36]) used
to identify the DS-TT MAC address of the corresponding PDU session. Based on
the 5GS bridge delay information it determines the TSC QoS information and TSC
Assistance information for the stream.
3\. Based on the Traffic specification (from the TSC stream creation request
in step 1), the SEAL NRM server determines whether time synchronization needs
to be activated for the TSC stream on the DS-TTs. If the DS-TTs are time
synchronized, then the NRM does not activate the time synchronization for the
corresponding DS-TT.
4\. As a TSCTSF, the NRM server triggers via N84 the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation as described in 3GPP TS
23.502 [11] for the TSC stream for both UL QoS flow (sender UE to UPF/bridge)
and DL QoS flow (UPF/bridge to receiver UE). The Policy Authorization request
includes the DS-TT port MAC address, TSC QoS information, TSC Assistance
Information (3GPP TS 23.501 [1], cl.5.27.2.3), flow bit rate, priority,
Service Data Flow Filter containing flow description including Ethernet Packet
Filters. The QoS flow will be assigned for the PDU session for the source MAC
address for the UL direction and for the PDU session for the destination MAC
address for the DL direction. This information is delivered to the DS-TT by
the 5GS.
If time synchronization is determined to be needed for the TSC stream on the
DS-TTs in step 3, the NRM server uses the procedures in clause K.2.2 of 3GPP
TS 23.501 [10] to activate the time synchronization via the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation. The procedure includes the
configuration and initialization of the PTP instance in the DS-TTs, the
construction of PMICs to each DS-TT/UE to activate the time synchronization
service in the DS-TT and to subscribe for the port management information
changes in the DS-TTs.
Editor\'s note: Using gate control parameters for hold and forward buffering
is FFS.
5\. The NRM server sends TSC stream creation response to the VAL server with
the result of TSC stream creation for the VAL Stream ID.
#### 14.3.7.4 TSC stream deletion procedure
This procedure allows the VAL server to delete a TSC stream.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The TSC stream is configured in the 5GS and the DS-TTs.
Figure 14.3.7.4-1: TSC stream deletion procedure
1\. The NRM server receives a request from VAL server to delete a TSC stream
for with a VAL Stream ID.
2\. The NRM server identifies the MAC addresses of the DS-TTs involved in the
stream based on the stored information for the VAL Stream ID. If none of the
streams require to keep the time synchronization activated, the NRM server
deactivates the time synchronization for the corresponding DS-TTs, otherwise
keeps the time synchronization activated if the time synchronization for the
DS-TTs was activated by the NRM server.
3\. As a TSCTSF, the NRM server triggers via N84 the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation defined in 3GPP TS 23.502
[11] for MAC addresses referred to by the VAL Stream ID. The NRM server uses
the procedure to delete both UL QoS flow (sender UE to UPF/bridge) and DL QoS
flows (UPF/bridge to receiver UE) from the PDU sessions of the UEs referred to
by the VAL Stream ID. Before invoking the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete
procedure, if the time synchronization service for the DS-TTs needs
deactivation, the NRM server deactivates the time synchronization for the DS-
TTs as described in clause K.2.2 3GPP TS 23.501 [10] via the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation.
4\. The NRM server sends TSC stream deletion response to the VAL server with
the result of TSC stream deletion for the VAL Stream ID.
### 14.3.8 TSN resource management procedures
#### 14.3.8.1 General
The procedures related to the TSN network resource management are described in
the following subclauses.
#### 14.3.8.2 5GS TSN Bridge information reporting
Pre-conditions:
1\. There is already an established session between the TSN CNC and the NRM
server acting as TSN-AF.
Figure 14.3.8.2-1: TSN Bridge information reporting procedure
1\. Acting as the TSN AF the NRM server collects 5GS TSN Bridge information by
interaction with the 5GS via the N5 reference point, as described in in TS
23.502 [11] Annex F.1. The NRM server stores the binding relationship between
5GS Bridge ID, MAC address of the DS-TT Ethernet port and also updates 5GS
bridge delay as defined in clause 5.27.5 of TS 23.501 [10]. The NRM server
retrieves txPropagationDelay and Traffic Class table from DS-TT and it also
retrieves txPropagationDelay and Traffic Class table from NW-TT.
2\. Whenever there is a new or updated bridge information the NRM server
interacts with the TSN CNC and reports the TSN Bridge information to register
a new TSN Bridge or update an existing TSN Bridge. The TSN CNC stores the TSN
Bridge information and confirms to the NRM server.
#### 14.3.8.3 5GS TSN Bridge configuration procedure
Pre-conditions:
1\. The TSN CNC has stored the 5GS TSN Bridge information received from the
NRM server acting as TSN AF.
2\. The NRM server acting as TSN AF has stored the 5GS TSN Bridge information
collected from the 5GS, as described in clause 14.3.8.2.
Figure 14.3.8.3-1: TSN Bridge configuration procedure
1\. The NRM server receives from the TSN CNC per-stream filtering, policing
parameters and related flow information according to IEEE 802.1Q [36] and it
uses them to derive TSN QoS information and related flow information. The TSN
AF uses this information to identify the DS-TT MAC address of the
corresponding PDU session.
2\. NRM server triggers via N5 the AF request procedure as described in 3GPP
TS 23.502 [11] Annex F.2. The AF request includes the DS-TT port MAC address,
TSC QoS information, TSC Assistance Information, flow bit rate, priority,
Service Data Flow Filter containing flow description including Ethernet Packet
Filters.
> 3\. NRM server responds with a TSN Bridge configuration.
### 14.3.9 Establishing communication with application service requirements
#### 14.3.9.1 General
The NRM client and the NRM server (acting as an AS) are involved in the
exchange and analysis of the desired service requirements (e.g. packet size,
packet transmission interval, reliability, packet error rate) for the E2E
communication amongst the Vertical UEs. The NRM server triggers the
establishment of application-level direct service connectivity between two UEs
via Uu, based on the information provided by the UEs and static configuration
information available to the NRM server prior to the UE interaction. Note that
service connectivity among VAL clients is established over the Uu, without
device-to-device direct radio connectivity (e.g. PC5) requirement.
#### 14.3.9.2 Procedures
##### 14.3.9.2.1 Procedure triggered by correlated source and destination
requests
The procedure for establishing Uu-based application-level direct
communications between two UEs, with application service requirements is as
illustrated in figure 14.3.9.2.1‑1. In this procedure the source and
destination VAL clients correlate their triggering of the procedure
establishment before the NRM Server provides the service.
Pre-conditions:
\- NRM client 1 and NRM client 2 are provided configuration information for
the VAL clients served e.g. connectivity requirements, which destination UEs
to connect to over Uu, etc.
\- The NRM client 1 and NRM client 2 are configured with the information of
the NRM server and have connectivity enabled to communicate with the NRM
server. The information is provided via pre-configuration.
\- The NRM server is configured with policies and information of the UEs to
determine authorization of the UEs requesting connectivity via Uu.
\- The VAL clients associated with NRM client 1 and NRM client 2 have
triggered the establishment of connectivity.
Figure 14.3.9.2.1-1: Establishing communication with application service
requirements
1a. The NRM client 1 sends the application connectivity request (source
identity and IP address, destination identities, service requirements) to the
NRM Server. The service requirement from the source includes packet size,
packet transmission interval, packet E2E latency, allowed packet loss
rate/packet loss amount/packet error rate, etc. The destination may be
multiple UEs (devices). The identity of source and destination may be the
application user identity or the MAC address.
1b. The NRM server determines whether the UE of NRM client 1 is authorized to
connect to the destination UEs for direct service communications via Uu. If UE
of NRM client 1 is authorized to connect to the destination UEs, then a
response is provided to the NRM client 1 indicating acceptance of the request.
2a. The NRM client 2 sends the application connectivity request (destination
identity and IP address, source identity, service requirements) to the NRM
server. The service requirements from the destination includes the service
requirements as described in step 1a.
2b. The NRM server determines whether the UE of NRM client 2 is authorized to
connect to the destination UEs for direct service communications via Uu. If UE
of NRM client 2 is authorized to connect to the destination UEs, then a
response is provided to the NRM client 2 indicating acceptance of the request.
3\. Based on the service requirements received in step 1 and step 2, the NRM
server determines the parameters and patterns for direct service connectivity
between the UEs via Uu and also the transport requirements, i.e., QoS
requirements for the 3GPP system (e.g. 5GS). This step may also include
retrieving the direct link status of the UEs (e.g. PDU Session Status, UE
reachability). If the NRM server determines that direct service connectivity
via Uu is not authorized or not possible with the given connectivity
requirements, it skips step 4 and proceeds to steps 5 and 6, informing each
NRM client accordingly.
NRM server will process E2E connectivity establishment between NRM client 1
and NRM client 2 only after it receives the request from NRM client 2. There
can be several NRM clients (destinations) which will perform step 2 and NRM
server will process their E2E connectivity with NRM client 1 (source) as and
when the requests are received by the NRM server.
4\. The NRM server triggers 3GPP system to establish Uu connectivity between
the UE of NRM client 1 and UE of NRM client 2 with required QoS as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
5\. The NRM server sends the application connectivity notification
(connectivity/session information) to NRM client 1 indicating successful
establishment of the connectivity. The connectivity/session information may
contain the accepted destination identities.
6\. The NRM server sends the application connectivity notification
(connectivity/session information) to NRM client 2 indicating successful
establishment of the connectivity.
##### 14.3.9.2.2 Procedure triggered by source request and coordinated with
destination
This procedure is used for establishing Uu-based application-level direct
communications between two UEs, based on a single client initiating and
providing application requirements. The procedure is as illustrated in figure
14.3.9.2.2‑1. The NRM Server provides the service by coordinating with the
destination client.
Pre-conditions:
\- NRM client 1 and NRM client 2 are provided configuration information for
the VAL clients served e.g. connectivity requirements, etc.
\- Pre-processing determines that network assisted UE-to-UE communications is
required. VAL application policies and destination information for NRM clients
are available at the NRM server.
\- The VAL client associated with NRM client 1 triggers the establishment of
connectivity and provides information about (one or more) destination VAL
client(s).
Figure 14.3.9.2.2-1: Coordination UE-to-UE communications with VAL application
requirements
1\. The NRM client 1 sends the application connectivity request (source
identity and IP address, destination identities, application requirements) to
the NRM server to establish connectivity for VAL client 1 on UE 1. The
destination VAL client(s) may be hosted on one or multiple UEs (devices).
> 2\. The NRM server determines whether VAL client 1 is authorized to connect
> to VAL client 2 for application-level direct UE-to-UE communications. If VAL
> client 1 is authorized to connect to VAL client 2, the NRM server performs

> This step can be skipped if the NRM server is already aware of VAL client
> 2\'s context information.
>
> NOTE: The signaling and functionality for handling the cases when NRM client
> 2 will be temporarily unavailable for establishing the direct service
> connection are implementation dependent.
3\. The NRM client 2 sends the get application connectivity context response
to the NRM server, 2. Using the request information and local policies, the
NRM client 2 determines whether context information is to be provided for
establishing application-level direct connectivity to the counterpart UE for
the VAL application indicated. If the NRM client determines that context
information is to be provided, it responds to the NRM server and provides the
VAL connection coordination context data for the VAL client served.

> 1.
>
> 5\. The NRM server uses VAL client 1\'s and VAL client 2\'s context

>
> If the NRM server determines that UE-to-UE application-level direct

>
> 6\. The NRM server may request the 3GPP system to establish or modify the
> 3GPP system level connectivity that enables the application-level direct UE-

>
> 7\. a. The NRM server notifies NRM client 1 of the established UE-to-UE

Each NRM client notifies the corresponding VAL client of the established
application-level direct UE-to-UE connection.
### 14.3.10 AF influence URSP procedures for reliable transmission
#### 14.3.10.1 General
The procedures related to the AF influence URSP forreliable transmission are
described in the following subclauses.
#### 14.3.10.2 AF influence URSP procedure for reliable transmission
Pre-conditions:
1\. The SEALDD server (or VAL server) has decided to use reliable transmission
for a specific SEALDD client (or VAL client) and has got the UE address or UE
ID.
Figure 14.3.10.2-1: AF influence URSP procedure
1\. The NRM server receives from the SEALDD server (or VAL server) about the
request for reliable transmission service with the application descriptors for
the two redundant transmission paths. The SEALDD client's current UE address
or UE ID is also provided to identify the affected UE.
2\. After receiving the request from SEALDD server (or VAL server), the NRM
server allocates the available DNN and S-NSSAI information for the two
application descriptors. NRM server triggers via N5/N33 with the AF guidance
for URSP procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.15.6.10. The
AF request includes the application traffic descriptors and the allocated DNN,
S-NSSAI, and also includes UE address or UE ID received in step 1.
3\. NRM serversends notification about reliable transmission service.
### 14.3.11 VAL services over 5GS supporting EPS interworking
The VAL server consumes the network resource management services from the NRM
server. As specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10], a dedicated user plane anchor
point, i.e. UPF + PGW-U function, is defined for interworking between 5GS and
EPS. This enables that the network can directly handle PDU sessions (in 5GS)
and PDN connections (in EPS) associated to VAL service sessions of a VAL UE
during inter-system mobility.
The inter-system mobility of a VAL UE will be transparent to the NRM server
and VAL server. The NRM server will continue interacting with the same control
plane functions, e.g. PCF, and the VAL server will continue interacting with
the same user plane function, e.g. UPF + PGW-U.
NOTE: For the case that seamless session continuity is required for VAL
services, EPS interworking with N26 (interface between AMF in 5GC and MME in
EPC) is required for inter-system change, as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
### 14.3.12 UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring management
#### 14.3.12.1 General
UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring management procedures allow NRM to
offer services leveraging CN exposure APIs for network parameter values
configuration and UE monitoring event management.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS whether and how NRM supports the functionality
described in this clause as service to other SEAL servers, or only to VAL
servers, as currently specified. Providing the functionality as service to
other SEAL servers (as well as to VAL servers) has been studied in TR
23.700-97.
14.3.12.2 UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring management subscription
procedure
VAL servers can indicate to the NRM server interest in receiving UE unified
traffic patterns and monitoring management services by sending the UE unified
traffic pattern and monitoring management subscription requests.
The subscription requests from each VAL server also include the traffic
pattern configuration of the requester, which refers to application-level
patterns of data traffic. The NRM server aggregates the traffic patterns
obtained from the requestors (and described in Table 14.3.2.53-2) to determine
the UE unified traffic patterns per UE. The UE unified traffic patterns are
described via Table 14.3.2.55-1 for the UE unified traffic pattern update
notification. These aggregated traffic patterns per UE (termed UE unified
traffic pattern) are updated/adjusted by the NRM Server based on information
obtained from UE monitoring.
Figure 14.3.12.2-1: UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring management
subscription procedure
1\. In order to subscribe to the NRM Server services, the VAL server sends the
UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring management subscription request, as
detailed in clause 14.3.2.53. The subscription request may include traffic
pattern configuration, which provides the traffic patterns of the specific VAL
Server. The request may also include Management subscription indications which
indicate to the NRM Server which management and 5GC exposure procedures the
VAL server allows the NRM Server to perform on its behalf.
2\. Upon receipt of the request, the NRM server sends a UE unified traffic
pattern and monitoring management subscription response as detailed in clause
14.3.2.54.
3\. The NRM Server aggregates UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring
management subscription requests from different VAL servers and determines the
UE unified traffic pattern per UE (using the traffic patterns of all the
communicating with the UE).
4\. Depending on the subscription requests received and local policies, the
NRM Server executes one or more management and 5GC exposure procedure (per
UE). Management and 5GC exposure procedures are detailed in clause 14.3.12.4.
The NRM Server determines the management procedures required to be executed on
behalf of the VAL Servers based on the received management subscription
indications as follows:
\- If the UE unified traffic pattern monitoring management indication is
provided, the NRM Server executes steps 1-3 of the UE unified traffic pattern
monitoring procedure detailed in clause 14.3.12.4.2.
\- If the UE unified traffic pattern monitoring update notification indication
is provided, the NRM Server executes the steps 1-4 of the UE unified traffic
pattern monitoring procedure detailed in clause 14.3.12.4.2.
\- If the Network parameter coordination indication is provided, the NRM
executes the network parameter coordination procedure detailed in clause
14.3.12.4.3.
NOTE: The NRM Server translates the management subscription indications
received from different VAL Servers into per-UE management indications based
on local policies and configurations. For example, an NRM Server may be
configured to execute a management procedure for a UE if at least one VAL
Server indicates it. Another NRM Server may be configured to provide all the
management procedures for the UEs using the platform independent of VAL Server
subscription indications.
#### 14.3.12.3 UE unified traffic pattern update notification procedure
An NRM Server can provide updated UE unified traffic pattern information to
VAL servers by sending UE unified traffic pattern update notifications as
shown in figure 14.3.12.3-1. The UE unified traffic pattern management
procedure detailed in clause 14.3.12.4.2. is an example of procedure which may
result in UE unified traffic pattern updates at the NRM server, based on which
UE unified traffic pattern update notifications are provided.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The VAL server has subscribed for UE unified traffic pattern and
monitoring management services, requesting to receive UE unified traffic
pattern update notifications
Figure 14.3.12.3-1: UE unified traffic pattern update notification procedure
1\. The NRM server sends the UE unified traffic pattern update notification
when either of the following occurs:
\- Monitoring events lead to updates in the UE unified traffic pattern (e.g.,
to schedule elements in Table 14.3.2.55-1) the NRM server sends a
corresponding notification to the VAL server. Other notifications may be
provided, e.g., if the stationary indication changes.
\- An NP Configuration Notification is received with a new set of applied
network parameters and if the NRM Server determines that the new configuration
is incompatible with the current UE unified traffic pattern (see also clause
14.3.12.4.2 step 3).
#### 14.3.12.4 Management and 5GC exposure procedures
##### 14.3.12.4.1 General
The management and 5GC exposure procedures in this clause show NRM processing
and its interactions with 5GC in support of the functionality described in
clause 14.3.12.2
##### 14.3.12.4.2 UE unified traffic pattern management procedure
The UE unified traffic pattern management procedure is used to determine and
manage a unified traffic pattern applicable to a specified UE. The NRM Server
then uses the 5GC exposure of UE monitoring events to update the UE unified
traffic pattern.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NRM Server determines to provide the service for a specific UE if
either of the following conditions is true:
a) It receives UE unified traffic pattern monitoring management indications in
UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring management subscription requests; or
b) It determines to provide Network parameter coordination services for the
UE.
Figure 14.3.12.4.2-1: UE unified traffic pattern and monitoring management
subscription procedure
1\. The NRM Server determines an initial UE unified traffic pattern, e.g. by
using all Traffic pattern configurations received for the UE .
2\. The NRM Server determines, based on local policy that UE monitoring events
are to be configured and executes the corresponding Monitoring procedure as
described in 3GPP TS 29.122 [54] clause 4.4.2.
3\. The NRM Server updates the UE unified traffic pattern based on the
received monitoring events as follows:
\- If a Monitoring Notification report for UE_REACHABILITY is received, and
_idleStatusInfo_ information is provided in the report, the NRM Server changes
the _schedule element_ of the UE unified traffic pattern such that the
duration of activity is set to the value of the _activeTime_ parameter
configured in the _idleStatusInfo_.
\- If a Monitoring Notification report for AVAILABILITY_AFTER_DDN_FAILURE is
received after UEs transition to idle mode, the NRM Server updates the
_schedule element_ of the UE unified traffic pattern such that: the start of
an activity window is based on the Idle Timestamp, with a periodicity equal to
the TAU/RAU Timer; the duration of the activity window indicates the Active
Time value.
\- If a Monitoring Notification report for COMMUNICATION_FAILURE is received
The NRM updates the schedule element of the UE unified traffic pattern to
indicate that no communications are currently available (e.g. by using a
keyword such as \"NULL\"). Local policies may specify events/ thresholds
further defining when the NRM may provide a UE unified traffic pattern update
based on monitoring events. For example, the update may be provided only after
repeated communication failures are received within a timespan, or only if
high reliability communications are expected. It is recommended that UE
Reachability monitoring is also enabled in conjunction with the Communication
Failure monitoring. This enables the NRM to provide updated timing information
once the UE becomes reachable again.
\- If a Monitoring Notification report for LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY is received,
the NRM Server changes the _schedule element_ of the UE unified traffic
pattern to indicate that no communications are currently available
4\. Conditional: The NRM Server notifies subscribers of the UE unified traffic
pattern updates, as described in clause 14.3.2.55
##### 14.3.12.4.3 Network parameter coordination procedure
The network parameter coordination procedure uses UE unified traffic pattern
information to influence aspects of UE/network behaviour such as the UE\'s PSM
and extended idle mode DR14. For this purpose, parameter values may be
suggested for Maximum Latency and Maximum Response Time for a UE. 5GC may
choose to accept, reject or modify the suggested configuration parameter
value.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NRM Server determines to provide the service for a specific UE after
receiving Network parameter coordination indications in UE unified traffic
pattern and monitoring management subscription requests, subject to policy.
2\. The NRM Server determines and manages UE unified traffic patterns as
described in clause 14.3.12.4.2.
Figure 14.3.12.4.3-1: Network parameter coordination procedure
1\. The NRM Server determines to provide Network parameter configuration to
5GC. This determination can be based on updates to the UE unified traffic
patterns resulting from interactions with VAL Servers (e.g. Traffic pattern
configuration updates), on local policies, etc.
The NRM Server determines parameters the needed for NpConfiguration data
structure as specified in 3GPP TS 29.122 [54] from the UE unified traffic
patterns as follows:
_\- maximumLatency_ \-- This value tells the network how long the UE is
allowed to sleep. Setting it to 0 will disable PSM, extended idle mode DRX,
and extended buffering. The NRM Server can extract the periodicity derived
from the UE unified traffic pattern, which includes the schedule elements for
the UEs communications with all VAL servers. The _NRM Server_ sets _Maximum
Latency_ to be approximately the periodicity of the active periods derived
from the _schedule element_ of the UE unified traffic pattern.
_\- maximumResponseTime_ \-- When the UE uses PSM, Maximum Response Time tells
the network how long the UE should stay reachable after a transition to idle.
When the UE uses eDRX, Maximum Response Time is used by the network to
determine when to send a reachability notification before a UE\'s paging
occasion. The NRM Server extracts a duration of activity from the _schedule
element_ of the UE unified traffic pattern and sets _Maximum Response Time_ to
reflect the duration of activity, indicating how long the UE should stay
reachable for downlink communications.
2\. The NRM Server performs the Network Parameter Configuration procedure as
described in 3GPP TS 29.122 [54] clause 4.4.12.
NOTE: The values provided by NRM Server to 5GC in the Network parameter
configuration procedure may or may not be accepted by the network. If they are
not accepted, 5GC responds accordingly and the previous values apply, or new
values are provided. The new values are used by NRM Server as described in
this clause when they were provided via monitoring event notifications.
### 14.3.13 Background Data Transfer configuration
#### 14.3.13.1 General
The Background Data Transfer (BDT) feature requires an initial step in which
policies are requested and negotiated. BDT Policy requests to the 3GPP network
are based on an expected time window and UE set, with additional optional
information e.g., expected data volume per UE. The UE set may be indicated as
an expected number of UEs, a group ID or geographical area.
The feature allows for the server involved to negotiate the policies proposed
by the network. It also allows the server to enable notifications to be sent,
should network conditions affect future BDT policies.
Based on the BDT policies obtained using the procedures detailed in this
clause, a VAL server can initiate a data transfer to the client at the
negotiated time and with the negotiated charging rates. The data transfer
between the VAL Server and the VAL Client is performed without NRM Server
enablement. Service layer functionality for the purpose of facilitating the
data transfer with the negotiated policy is not in scope of this
specification.
#### 14.3.13.2 Request and Select Background Data Transfer Policy
Figure 14.3.13.2-1 depicts a general procedure for the request and
configuration of traffic policies for BDT initiated by a request from a VAL
Server.
Figure 14.3.13.2-1: General Procedure for configuration of Background Data
Transfer
1\. A VAL Server requests the NRM Server to negotiate with the 3GPP network a
background data transfer policy using the BDT_Configuration_request (see
clause 14.4.2.15).
The request includes expected data volume, expected number of UEs, expected
time window for the background data transfer. The request may also include
group ID, geographic information for the UEs, a request expiration time,
guidance for policy selection. If guidance for policy selection is not
included, the VAL Server indicates if the NRM Server may choose independently
from among multiple transfer policies.
2\. Based on the request expiration time and Service Provider policies, NRM
Server may determine to delay interactions with the 3GPP network in order to
negotiate on behalf of multiple VAL Servers.
The NRM Server performs the resource management of background data transfer
procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.16.7.2. The procedure
requires that expected data volume, expected number of UEs, and expected time
window are provided by the NRM Server. If the NRM Server determined to
negotiate on behalf of multiple VAL Servers, the parameters included reflects
a superset of the individual VAL Server requests.
> NOTE 1: The NRM Server determines to negotiate on behalf of multiple VAL
> Servers based on implementation options and local policies. For example, if
> the request expiration time and expected time window are sufficiently large
> and, respectively, far away in time, the NRM Server may be allowed to delay
> the negotiations with the 3GPP network in case another request is received,
> targeting the same group of UEs. If another request is received with
> expected time windows sufficiently close and if the guidance for policy
> selection allows, a single policy/time window may be negotiated instead.
> This allows the UE group to wake up only once for multiple background data
> transfers.
>
> The 3GPP network determines one or more applicable transfer policies based
> on the requesting Background Data Transfer parameters. A list of transfer
> policies is provided to the NRM Server. Each transfer policy includes
> mandatory Reference ID, charging rating group reference and allocated time
> window and optional maximum UL and DL bandwidth. The NRM Server uses ASP
> policies and the transfer selection guidance (if available) to select a
> policy. The NRM Server informs the 3GPP Network of the selected transfer
> policy.
>
> NOTE 2: Based on 3GPP TS 23.503 [12] clause 6.1.2.4. it is assumed that the
> NRM server is configured to understand the charging rating group reference
> based on agreements with the operator.
>
> NOTE 3: The NRM server sets the warning notification based on local
> policies.
3\. The NRM Server responds to the VAL Server, providing the Reference ID and
allocated time window of the background data transfer policy.
#### 14.3.13.3 Reselect Background Data Transfer Policy
Figure 14.3.13.3-1 depicts a general procedure for reselecting BDT policies
after BDT warning.
Figure 14.3.13.3-1: General Procedure for reselecting BDT policies after
warning
1\. The 3GPP Network, via NEF, sends the BDT warning (BDT Policy negotiate)
notification to the NRM server. The notification includes the affected BDT
policy Reference ID and list of candidate BDT policies.
Each of the BDT policies in the candidate BDT list includes mandatory
Reference ID, charging rating group reference and time window, as well as
optional maximum UL and DL bandwidth.
2\. The NRM Server checks the new BDT policies included in the candidate list
of the BDT warning notification. The NRM Server determines whether the
notification affects multiple VAL Servers or not. The NRM Server uses ASP
policies and the transfer selection guidance (if available) provided with the
initial VAL Server request to select a policy.
The NRM Server informs the 3GPP Network of the selected transfer policy or
that no new policy has been selected by using steps 11-16 of the procedure for
BDT warning notification in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.16.7.3.
3 The NRM Server ends a new response to the VAL Server via the
BDT_Negotiation_notification (see clause 14.4.2.16), providing information
about the new policy, or that no policy is available. If a new BDT policy is
available, the information provided to the VAL Server includes the ID of the
applicable policy and the time window.

# 15 Service-based interface representation of the functional model for SEAL
services
## 15.1 General
The functional models for SEAL services is represented using functional
entities and reference points between the functional entities as specified in
subclause 6. The vertical applications consume the SEAL services in the form
of APIs. Each SEAL service offers these APIs on a service-based interface to
all its consumer entities.
## 15.2 Functional model representation
Figure 15.2-1 illustrates the service-based interface representation of the
functional model for SEAL services.
Figure 15.2-1: SEAL generic functional model representation using service-
based interfaces
The SEAL function(s) exhibit the service-based interfaces which are used for
providing and consuming SEAL services. The service APIs are specified for each
SEAL function enabled over the service-based interface. The service-based
interfaces of specific SEAL services are specified in this document. All the
interactions with SEAL are governed based on the reference point interactions
of the functional models specified in subclause 6. VAL function represents the
functionalities of the VAL server.
NOTE: The service-based interface Sval for the VAL function is out of scope of
the present document.
The service APIs offered by the SEAL function(s) are published and discovered
on the CAPIF core function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8].
Editor\'s note: Refinement of the SEAL services in service-based interface
representation is FFS.
Editor\'s note: Representation of OAM services consumption via EGMF/CAPIF is
FFS

# 17 Notification Management
## 17.1 General
The notification management is a SEAL service that offers the notification
functionality to one or more verticals. This service enables VAL clients to
subscribe and receive notifications from the VAL servers and thereby
offloading the complexity of delivery and reception of notifications to the
enabler layer. It provides common notification delivery service to vertical
applications.
## 17.2 Functional model
### 17.2.1 General
The functional model for the notification management is based on the generic
functional model specified in clause 6.2. It is organized into functional
entities to describe a functional architecture which addresses the
notification management aspects required for vertical applications. Since the
notification management is a feature which considers the Uu interfaces, only
the on-network functional model is specified in this clause.
### 17.2.2 Functional model description
Figure 17.2.2-1 illustrates the generic functional model for notification
management.
Figure 17.2.2-1: Functional model for notification management
The notification management client communicates with the notification
management server over the NM-UU reference point. The notification management
client provides the support for notification management functions to the VAL
client(s) over NM‑C reference point. The VAL server(s) communicates with the
notification management server over the NM-S reference point for delivering
the notification messages which is targeted for the VAL client(s).
Notification management server sends these notification messages to the
notification management client either through NM-UU interface for direct
delivery (e.g. Long-polling, WebSocket) or through the OEM PUSH server for
indirect delivery (e.g. FCM, APNS, OMA PUSH) which is implementation specific
and outside the scope of this specification.
NOTE: Notification messages from PUSH notification server to the PUSH
notification client are delivered either through 3GPP network system or
through any non-3GPP system, which is implementation specific.
### 17.2.3 Functional entities description
#### 17.2.3.1 General
The functional entities for notification management service are described in
the following subclauses.
#### 17.2.3.2 Notification Management client
The notification management client functional entity acts as the application
client for notification management aspects. It interacts with the notification
management server. It handles the notification messages received from the
notification management server and deliver it to the corresponding VAL clients
residing on the VAL UE.
The notification management client functional entity is supported by the HTTP
client functional entities of the signalling control plane.
#### 17.2.3.3 Notification Management server
The notification management server is a functional entity that handles the
notification management aspects by interacting with the notification
management client and the VAL servers. The notification management server
receives the notification messages from the vertical application layer and
delivers it to the notification management client.
Editor\'s note: Notification management server acting as CAPIF's API exposing
function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8] is FFS.
### 17.2.4 Reference points description
#### 17.2.4.1 General
The reference points for the functional model for notification management are
described in the following subclauses.
#### 17.2.4.2 NM-UU
The interactions related to notification management functions between the
notification management client and the notification management server are
supported by NM-UU reference point. This reference point utilizes Uu reference
point as described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [9] and 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
#### 17.2.4.3 NM-C
The interactions related to notification management functions between the VAL
client(s) and the notification management client within a VAL UE are supported
by NM-C reference point.
#### 17.2.4.4 NM-S
The interactions related to notification management functions between the VAL
server(s) and the notification management server are supported by NM-S
reference point.
Editor\'s note: NM-S reference point using CAPIF-2 reference point as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8] is FFS.

### 17.3.3 Procedure for creating notification channel to receive
notifications
Figure 17.3.3-1 below illustrates the procedure for receiving notifications
from the notification management server by the notification management client.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The notification management client does not have any notification channel
open with the notification management server.
Figure 17.3.3-1: Receiving notifications from notification management server
1\. The VAL client requests the notification management client to subscribe to
and receive notifications from the VAL server.
2\. The notification management client creates notification channels (i.e.
endpoint URLs), if not created already, to be used by the VAL server to send
notification messages. To create notification channel, the notification
management client sends a create notification channel request to the
notification management server. The desired validity duration for the channels
to be used and the notification channel type (PUSH or PULL) are included in
the request. The notification management client decides which type of the
notification channel to be used based on the UE capability.
3\. The notification management server authenticates the notification
management client and authorizes its request.
4\. The notification management server sends the notification management
client the Create notification channel response with the endpoint URLs that
will be used by the VAL server to send the notification messages and the
notification management client to receive the notification messages. The
notification management server also includes what is the valid duration for
these endpoint URLs to be used and the channel ID to uniquely identify the
channel created in the response.
5\. If the notification type is PULL method, the notification management
client sends the Open notification channel to the notification management
server to start receiving the notification message. For certain PUSH method
notification type (such as WebSockets) the notification management client
requests the notification management server to start the PUSH notification
service with its specific protocol that is outside the scope of this
specification.
NOTE 1: This step is not required if the notification client wants to receive
the notification messages via PUSH notification server.
6\. The notification management client responds to the VAL client the status
of its request as in step 1 to receive notifications from the VAL server. It
also includes the callback URL which needs to be used by the VAL client while
subscribing to the VAL server for receiving notifications.
7\. The VAL client subscribes to the VAL server for receiving notifications.
This request includes the subscription data and the callback URL returned from
the notification management server in step 4.
NOTE 2: This step is outside the scope of this specification.
8\. The VAL server generates the notification message for the subscription
request from the VAL client.
9\. The VAL server sends the notification message to the notification
management server containing the VAL UE or VAL user ID, VAL service ID, VAL
application ID and the notification data.
10\. If the delivery method is PULL, the notification management server sends
the notification message to the notification management client over the opened
notification channel.
NOTE 3: If the delivery method is PUSH via PUSH notification server, the
notification management server sends the notification message to the OEM Push
server (not shown in the figure and is outside the scope of this
specification) to deliver to the notification management client.
11\. The notification management client delivers the received notification
message to the appropriate VAL client based on the details as received in the
notification message from the notification management server.
Editor\'s note: How to support different types of PULL and PUSH mechanisms for
delivery of notification data is FFS.
### 17.3.4 Procedure for deleting notification channel
Figure 17.3.4-1 below illustrates the procedure for deleting notification
channel by the notification management client.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The notification management client has notification channel open with the
notification management server.
Figure 17.3.4-1: Deletion of notification channel by the notification
management client
1\. The VAL client decides to stop receiving notifications from the VAL server
and deletes the subscription with the VAL server.
NOTE: Step 1 is outside the scope of 3GPP but triggers step 2.
2\. The VAL client requests the notification management client to stop
receiving the notifications.
3\. If the same notification channel is being used for other VAL clients in
the UE, the notification management client sends the delete notification
channel request with request type as de-register otherwise the notification
management client sends the delete notification channel request with request
type as delete to the notification management server. The delete notification
channel request carries the channel ID of the notification channel.
4\. The notification management server acknowledges the request and sends the
delete notification channel response to the notification management client.
5\. The notification management client indicates to the VAL client about the
status (de-registered or channel deleted or failure) of its request to stop
receiving the notification.
### 17.3.5 Procedure for updating notification channel
Figure 17.3.5-1 below illustrates the procedure for updating the notification
channel by the notification management client.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The notification management client has notification channel open with the
notification management server.
Figure 17.3.5-1: Updating notification channel by the notification management
client
1\. The notification management client detects the expiry timer of the active
notification channel being approached and a need for updating the new expiry
time on notification management server.
2\. To update notification channel, the notification management client sends
an update notification channel request to the notification management server
with the proposed new validity duration for the active channel.
3\. The notification management server authenticates the notification
management client and authorizes its request.
4\. The notification management server checks whether the new proposed expiry
timer is valid or not. The NMS may accept the proposed validity duration from
the request or assign a different validity duration based on the local policy.
5\. The notification management server sends the notification management
client the Update notification channel response with the valid duration for
this active notification channel. The notification management client shall
store the new valid duration of the notification management channel.
# 18 Data Delivery
## 18.1 General
With increasing demand of applications consumption over mobile networks, more
and more application content is transmitted over the mobile networks. Vertical
applications have diverse requirements for the application content
distribution and delivery. To ease the various data delivery demands for
vertical applications, a data delivery enabler offers the data delivery and
storage capabilities to one or more vertical applications. The detailed
specification of SEAL Data Delivery is provided in 3GPP TS 23.433 [48]
# 19 Application Data Analytics Enablement
## 19.1 General
The application data analytics enablement is a SEAL service that offers value-
add application data analytics capabilities which cover stats/predictions for
the end-to-end application service. Considering vertical-specific applications
and edge applications as the major consumers of 3GPP-provided data analytics
services, the application enablement layer can play role on the exposure of
data analytics services from different 3GPP domains to the vertical/ASP in a
unified manner; and on defining, at an overarching layer, value-add
application data analytics services which cover stats/predictions for the end-
to-end application service. The detailed specification of ADAE is provided in
3GPP TS 23.436 [49].

###### ### Annex C (normative): Protocol realizations of LWP in the signalling
control plane
# C.1 General
This annex specifies protocol realizations of the light-weight protocol in the
signalling control plane.
# C.2 Usage of CoAP as LWP
This clause specifies how the CoAP protocol shall be used to realize the
generic light-weight protocol in the signalling control plane.
The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a light-weight protocol defined
by IETF in RFC 7252 [32] and designed specifically for application layer
communication for constrained devices. CoAP provides a request/response
interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery
of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs
and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for
integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as
multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained
environments. RFC 7252 [32] specifies bindings to UDP and DTLS. IETF RFC 8323
[33] specifies bindings to TCP, WebSocket and TLS.
Figure C.2-1 illustrates the functional model for the LWP signalling control
plane when CoAP is used as the LWP.
Figure C.2-1: Functional model for LWP signalling control plane when CoAP is
used as LWP
When CoAP is used to realize the generic light-weight protocol defined in
clause 6.2, then,
1\. CoAP client is a realization of the LWP client
2\. CoAP proxy is a realization of the LWP proxy, with the following
clarifications:
a. CoAP proxy shall be able to terminate a DTLS, TLS or secure WebSocket
session on LWP-1 reference point;
b. CoAP proxy shall be able to act as a cross-protocol CoAP-HTTP proxy to
support LWP-HTTP-2 and LWP-HTTP-3 reference points;
3\. CoAP server is a realization of the LWP server
4\. CoAP supports the interactions over LWP-1, LWP-2 and LWP-3 reference
points
5\. The usage of CoAP by the SEAL service enablers shall follow the rules set
out in clause 6.4.3.5.
