# 4 Introduction
The MCVideo service supports video media communication between several users
(i.e. group call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the
permission to stream video in an arbitrated manner. The MCVideo service also
supports private calls between two users.
The MCVideo architecture is based on the functional architecture for mission
critical communication services defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
# 5 Architectural requirements
## 5.1 Media routing requirements
The video media flow for a private call shall be routed according to one of
the following two options:
a) Option 1:
1) Through the primary MCVideo system if both users in the call belong to the
same organisation; or
2) Through the primary MCVideo system of each users, if the users in the call
do not belong to the same organisation.
b) Option 2: The video media flow may be routed locally, under the control of
the primary MCVideo system, through an entity allowing the duplication of the
media flow to the primary MCVideo system of each user.
The video media flow for a group call shall be routed to the group home
MCVideo system.
## 5.2 MCVideo group affiliation and MCVideo group de-affiliation
MCVideo group affiliation shall be as specified in clause 5.2.5 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [6]. In addition, the following requirements shall be fulfilled by the
MCVideo service for MCVideo users affiliated to MCVideo groups:
\- MCVideo users receive notifications for MCVideo group call setup and
invitations for their affiliated MCVideo group(s).
\- MCVideo users select an affiliated MCVideo group to initiate a new group
MCVideo call or transmit media in an existing MCVideo group call.
\- MCVideo users receive media and events from their affiliated MCVideo
group(s).
## 5.3 Device inventory requirements
The MCVideo service shall provide device inventory capabilities for MCVideo
UEs. The device inventory capabilities shall include:
\- device information registration;
\- device information storage; and
\- device information query.
## 5.4 Device discovery requirements (off-network)
The MCVideo service shall provide device discovery for devices as requested by
the MCVideo user according to the MC service provider policy for off-network
operations.
## 5.5 Bearer management
### 5.5.1 General
The MCVideo UE shall use the APNs as defined in subclause 5.2.7.0 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [6]. The MCVideo UE shall use the MC services APN as defined in
subclause 5.2.7.0 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6] for the SIP-1 reference point.
### 5.5.2 EPS bearer considerations
The EPS bearer considerations specified in subclause 5.2.7.2 of 3GPP TS 23.280
[6] shall apply.
### 5.5.3 EPS unicast bearer considerations for MCVideo
For an MCVideo call session request, resources shall be requested utilising
interaction with dynamic PCC. The MCVideo system shall request resources over
Rx to a PCRF. It is recommended that the dedicated bearer(s) for video media
and control of the video media (i.e. MCVideo‑4 and MCVideo‑7) utilise the QCI
values depending on the MCVideo mode of the MCVideo call/session, as per table
5.5.3-1. For transmission and reception control signalling, the QCI value of
69 is recommended as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [11]. The request of
resources over Rx shall include an application identifier for MCVideo in order
for the PCRF to evaluate the correct QCI.
Table 5.5.3-1: QCI values to use for EPS unicast bearers for each MCVideo mode
* * *
MCVideo mode QCI value utilised\ (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [11])
* * *
Urgent real-time mode 67
Non-urgent real-time mode 67
Non real-time mode 4
* * *
The MCVideo audio media and video media may transmit over separate EPS
bearers, in which case the priority for each bearer is determined by the
operator policy. Depending on operator policy, the MCVideo system may be able
to request modification of the priority (ARP) of an existing bearer without
the need to initiate a new dedicated GBR bearer.
NOTE: Operator policy takes into account regional/national requirements.
When MCVideo audio media and video media are multiplexed into one EPS bearer,
then different QCI and/or ARP values are not possible for video and audio
media.
### 5.5.4 MBMS bearer management
The MBMS bearer management for MC services is specified in subclause 5.2.7.1
of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
# 5A Involved business relationships
The description of the involved business relationships for the MCVideo service
is contained in clause 6 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].

physical entity.
### 6.2.2 MCVideo service application plane
#### 6.2.2.1 General
Entities within the application plane of MCVideo service provide application
control, media transmission control and distribution functions.
#### 6.2.2.2 Common services core
The description of the common services core entities are contained in common
functional architecture for MC services over LTE in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
#### 6.2.2.3 MCVideo application service
##### 6.2.2.3.1 MCVideo client
The MCVideo client functional entity acts as the user agent for all MCVideo
application transactions.
The MCVideo client is responsible for remote device control. This functional
entity is located in the UE for both on-network and off-network operations.
##### 6.2.2.3.2 MCVideo server
The MCVideo server functional entity provides centralised support for MCVideo
services.
All the MCVideo clients supporting users belonging to a single group are
required to use the same MCVideo server for that group. An MCVideo client
supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have relationships with
multiple MCVideo servers.
The MCVideo server is an instantiation of a MC service server in accordance
with 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
The MCVideo server functional entity represents a specific instantiation of
the GCS AS described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [9] to control multicast and unicast
operations for group communications.
The MCVideo server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS, HTTP client
and HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.
This MCVideo server provides support for centralised media transmission
control for on-network and distributed media transmission control for off-
network operation.
The MCVideo server is responsible for managing and providing the device
information that can participate in MCVideo communications. The device
information is further associated to MCVideo users to manage remote device
control authorization. The device information is provisioned to the MCVideo
server by the MCVideo service provider, mission critical organization and the
MCVideo user.
The MCVideo server performing the functional alias controlling role is
responsible for:
\- interfacing with the functional alias management server for functional
alias policy;
\- functional alias activation, deactivation, take over and interrogation
support for MCVideo user.
The controlling roles for group call, private call and functional alias are
independent with each other.
##### 6.2.2.3.3 Media distribution function
The media distribution function is responsible for the distribution of media
to MCVideo clients. By means of information provided by the MCVideo server
(e.g. IP addresses, transport layer ports), it will provide the following
functionality:
\- provide for the reception of uplink MCVideo UE media transmission by means
of the MCVideo-7 reference point;
\- storing the received media stream as MCVideo content files;
\- replicate the media as needed for distribution to those participants using
unicast transport;
\- distribute downlink media to MCVideo UEs by IP unicast transmission to
those participants utilizing unicast transport by means of the MCVideo-7
reference point;
\- distribute downlink media to MCVideo UEs using multicast downlink transport
of media for the call by means of the MCVideo-8 reference point; and
\- provide a media mixing function where multiple media streams are combined
into a single media stream for transmission to the MCVideo UE.
NOTE 1: If media mixing function occurs within the media distribution
function, it operates independently of the media mixer in the UE.
NOTE 2: A media mixing function within the media distribution function is not
possible where the media is end to end encrypted.
##### 6.2.2.3.4 Media mixer
This functional entity exists on the UE and provides support for sending and
receiving one or multiple media streams. It also provides support for
combining multiple media streams into one media stream through the enforcement
of media policy information. It supports the storing of a media stream as
MCVideo content files.
##### 6.2.2.3.5 MCVideo user database
This functional entity contains information of the MCVideo user profile
associated with an MCVideo ID that is held by the MCVideo service provider at
the application plane. The MCVideo user profile is determined by the mission
critical organization, the MCVideo service provider, and potentially the
MCVideo user.
The MCVideo ID is a MC service ID as described in clause 8 of 3GPP TS 23.280
[6]. The MCVideo user profile is a MC service user profile as described in
clause 10.1.4 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
The MCVideo user profile can be co-located with other MC service user profiles
and stored in a common MC service user database.
##### 6.2.2.3.6 Transmission control server
This functional entity provides support for centralised transmission control
for on-network and distributed transmission control for off-network operation.
It may schedule transmission requests according to uplink criteria from
different transmission control participants, send an notification to all
transmission control participants to allow them to receive the video according
to downlink criteria if the transmission request is granted, and provide
queuing in cases of contention. Transmission control applies to all MCVideo
communications including group call and private call. For on-network
operation, this functional entity is located with the MCVideo server. For off-
network operation, this functional entity is located in the UE.
##### 6.2.2.3.7 Transmission control participant
The transmission control participant functional entity is responsible for
handling outgoing transmission requests and the incoming video stream
invitations and notifications. This functional entity is located in the UE for
both on-network and off-network operations.
##### 6.2.2.3.8 MC gateway server
The MC gateway server provides support for MCVideo interconnection services
with a partner MCVideo system in a different trust domain whilst providing
topology hiding. It acts as a proxy for one or more MCVideo servers in the
partner MCVideo system without needing to expose the MCVideo servers in the
primary MCVideo system outside the trusted domain of the primary MCVideo
system. It may be a role of the MCVideo server described in subclause
6.2.2.3.2 of the present document.
The MC gateway server is responsible for relaying call control and floor
control signalling messages, and media between MCVideo servers within the
MCVideo system and the interconnected MCVideo system.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether the gateway MC server can act as a
signalling proxy as defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [14]

##### 7.1.2.3.1 Group call models
###### 7.1.2.3.1.1 Pre-arranged group call
##### 7.1.2.3.1.1.1 General {#general-5 .H6}
A pre-arranged group call is initiated by one of the affiliated group members.
The initiation of a pre-arranged group call results in all other affiliated
group members being invited. Media plane resources are reserved (on-demand) or
a pre-established session is associated during the group call setup procedure
and released (if on-demand session) or de-associated (if pre-established
session) when the call is released. SIP signalling is used to setup and
release pre-arranged group calls.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.1.2 Pre-arranged group call setup {#pre-arranged-group-call-
setup .H6}
The procedure enables the scenario where an MCVideo client is initiating an
MCVideo group call with unicast signalling for communicating with the
affiliated members of that group.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of an MCVideo group
call with a pre-arranged group i.e., MCVideo users on client 1, client 2 and
client 3 belong to the same group which is defined in the group management
server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. A pre-arranged group is an MCVideo group that is pre-defined with MCVideo
group ID and member list in the group management server. All members of the
group belong to the same MC system.
2\. It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and
MCVideo client 3 are already registered for receiving MCVideo service and
affiliated.
3\. The MCVideo client 1 may have an activated functional alias to be used.
4\. The MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
5\. The MCVideo user on MCVideo client 1 may have bound a functional alias to
the MCVideo group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [6]).
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.2-1: Pre-arranged group call setup
1\. User at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an MCVideo group call with
a selected group (identified by MCVideo group ID). The MCVideo user at MCVideo
client 1 may include a functional alias used within the MCVideo group call.
NOTE 1: The selected functional alias is not changed during the group call,
i.e. a MCVideo client uses the same functional alias until the group call is
released or the MCVideo client has left the group call.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends a group call request towards the MCVideo server via
the SIP core, which hosts the group selected by the user and identified by
MCVideo group ID. The group call request also contains the MCVideo group ID
and an SDP offer containing the MCVideo client media parameters. If the MC
service user of MCVideo client 1 has selected a functional alias, then the
group call request contains that functional alias. If there is a transmit
media request, then the group call request contains an indication for the
implicit transmit media request. If the group call request contains an
implicit transmit media request it may also include location information.
3\. MCVideo server checks whether the user of MCVideo client 1 is authorized
to initiate a group call for the selected group. If a functional alias is
present, the MCVideo server checks whether it is allowed to be used and if it
has been activated for the user. If authorized and the group call is ongoing
for that MCVideo group ID, the MCVideo server adds the requesting MCVideo
client 1 to the existing MCVideo group call and notifies the MCVideo client 1
that the MCVideo group call is already in progress. Otherwise, MCVideo server
resolves the MCVideo group ID to determine the members of that group and their
affiliation status, based on the information from the group management server.
If the functional alias is provided only in the group call request, or via
binding, the MCVideo server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the
functional alias is provided in both the group call request and via binding,
it is up to the MCVideo server implementation to determine a value for the
functional alias to be used.
NOTE 2: MCVideo server can have already retrieved the user/group configuration
data and locally cached. If the user/group configuration data is not locally
cached on the MCVideo server then MCVideo server requests the user/group
configuration data from the MCVideo user database/group management server.
4\. MCVideo server includes information that it communicates using MCVideo
service, offers the same media parameters or a subset of the media parameters
contained in the initial received request and sends the corresponding group
call request via the SIP core towards the MCVideo clients of each of those
affiliated group members. MCVideo users are notified about the incoming group
call and, if present, the functional alias of the initiating MC service user
is displayed. The MCVideo server indicates whether acknowledgement is required
for the call.
5\. The receiving MCVideo clients accept the group call request, and a group
call response is sent to the group host MCVideo server. This response may
contain an acknowledgement. The conditions for sending acknowledgement may be
based on configuration.
6\. MCVideo server sends the group call response including the selected media
parameters to the MCVideo client 1 through the signalling path to inform about
successful call establishment.
NOTE 3: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4b, and prior to step 7
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
7\. If the initiating MCVideo user requires the acknowledgement from
affiliated MCVideo group members, and the required MCVideo group members do
not acknowledge the call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged
call setup timeout\"), then the MCVideo server may proceed with or abandon the
call and then notify the initiating MCVideo user that the acknowledgements did
not include all required members according to group policy. This notification
may be sent to the initiating MCVideo user by the MCVideo server more than
once during the call when MCVideo users join or leave the MCVideo group call.
8\. MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully established
media plane and transmission control for communication.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.1.3 Release pre-arranged group call {#release-pre-arranged-
group-call .H6}
The procedure enables the scenario where an MCVideo server initiates the
termination of an ongoing MCVideo group call for all the participants of that
group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met e.g.,
last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving,
or minimum number of affiliated MCVideo group members are not present.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo server initiating termination of an ongoing MCVideo
group call.
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.3-1: Release pre-arranged group call
1\. It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client
3 are already part of the ongoing group call (e.g., as a result of pre-
arranged group call setup).
2\. MCVideo server would like to release the MCVideo group call which is
ongoing e.g., last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number
of affiliated group members are not present.
3\. MCVideo server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and
generates group call release request to release ongoing session.
4\. MCVideo server sends a group call release request via SIP core towards
each participant of the ongoing group call.
5\. MCVideo users are notified about the release of the group call.
6\. MCVideo client(s) receiving group call release request, acknowledge
towards the MCVideo server by sending a group call release response.
7\. MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the
media transmission control and media plane resources associated with the group
call that is terminated.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.1.4 Late entry pre-arranged group call {#late-entry-pre-
arranged-group-call .H6}
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.4-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo server requesting a newly affiliated member or a
member coming back from out of coverage to join an ongoing MCVideo group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCVideo users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MC system.
2\. It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 2 to MCVideo client n
are on an ongoing call.
3\. Optionally, the MCVideo client 1 may have activated functional alias to be
used.
4\. The MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.4-1: Late entry pre-arranged group call
1\. MCVideo server determines that MCVideo client 1 which is newly affiliated
or coming back from out of coverage has to be invited to join an ongoing group
call (late entry).
2\. MCVideo server generates group call request including the information such
as MCVideo service identifier (possible for the SIP core to route the request
to the MCVideo server), MC service group ID of the group invited to join,
offer one or more media types and sends towards the MCVideo client 1 via SIP
core.
3\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is notified about the incoming group
call.
4\. Upon MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 accepting the incoming group call
request, MCVideo client 1 sends the group call response including the selected
media types to the MCVideo server through the signalling path. If the incoming
group call request is rejected by the MCVideo client 1, the MCVideo server
should not resend the group call request
5\. MCVideo client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and
MCVideo users at MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client n may be notified about
the MCVIDEO client 1 joining the group call.
6\. A notification with the information of media transmissions in the group
call is sent to MCVideo client1.
Editor\'s Note: Checking of functional alias of MCVideo client 1 by the
MCVideo server is FFS.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.1.5 Rejoining call {#rejoining-call .H6}
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.5-1 are the signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo client to rejoin an ongoing MCVideo group call
(e.g. coming back from out of coverage).
Pre-condition:
1 It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 2 to MCVideo client n are
on an ongoing call.
2\. Optionally, the MCVideo client 1 may have activated functional alias to be
used.
3\. The MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.1.5-1: Rejoin call
1\. MCVideo client 1 has necessary information for rejoining an ongoing group
call, then the MCVideo client 1 initiates group call rejoin request including
the ongoing group call information. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may
include a functional alias used within the MCVideo rejoin request.
2\. MCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo client 1 can rejoin the ongoing
call (e.g. based upon affiliation status) and checks the functional alias, if
present.
3\. MCVideo client 1 is informed that the group call rejoin is successful by
sending a group call rejoin response.
4\. MCVideo client 1 is successfully added to the ongoing group call and
MCVideo users at MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client n may be notified about
the MCVideo client 1 joining the group call and the functional alias of
MCVideo client 1 may be displayed.
5\. A notification with the information of media transmissions in the group
call is sent to MCVideo client 1.
###### 7.1.2.3.1.2 Chat group call
##### 7.1.2.3.1.2.1 General {#general-6 .H6}
In a chat group (restricted) call model, the MCVideo user individually joins a
group call without being explicitly invited by the MCVideo server. The
establishment of a chat group (restricted) call does not result in other group
members being invited.
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCVideo client
initiating an MCVideo group call which uses the chat group (restricted) call
model. The chat group (restricted) call model can be used to realize the video
conferencing service where only users that have been configured as
participants for the video conferencing group are allowed to join the group
communications for the given group.
Chat group join mechanism:
\- Each MCVideo client sends a group join request when the MCVideo user wants
to participate in the group communication for the group. (This message does
not impact the MCVideo user\'s membership in the group; the MCVideo server
will verify that the MCVideo user is an authorized member of the group.)
\- The group join request may include a transmit media request. If the group
join request includes a request to transmit media it may also include location
information. It is assumed that the group join request will be delivered from
MCVideo client to MCVideo server using SIP.
\- If location information was included in the group join request, the MCVideo
server checks the privacy policy of the MCVideo user to decide if the location
information of MCVideo client 1 can be provided to other users on the call.
\- The group join request is used to indicate to the MCVideo server that the
MCVideo user associated with the given MCVideo client wishes to participate
(begin to receive notifications for media transmissions) from the group.
\- The group join request shall cause the MCVideo server to generate an
implicit affiliation for the MCVideo user to the group, if the user is not
already affiliated to the group.
\- The group join request contains the information needed to negotiate media
parameters (on demand) or to associate a pre-established session between
MCVideo server and MCVideo client for the group call. The group join request
can take the form of a SIP invite.
\- A selected functional alias is not changed by a MCVideo client during the
whole participation within a chat group call, i.e. a MCVideo client uses the
same functional alias selected when joining the chat group call until the chat
group call is released or the MCVideo client leaves the chat group call.
Subsequent participation in a group call when the group is using the chat
model:
\- Once an MCVideo client successfully joins a group call which is using the
chat model, the MCVideo client connects to the media plane for the media
transmission if the media transmission is currently ongoing.
\- If the MCVideo group call is not currently ongoing (i.e.: when MCVideo
clients on the group call are not sending or receiving media, and the time out
between transmission control exchanges has expired) then the newly joined
MCVideo client will only have pre-established its media parameters for the
call.
\- If the newly joined MCVideo user wishes to transmit media to the other
joined users of the group using the chat model, then the MCVideo client shall
use a normal transmission control procedure for transmitting the media.
\- Subsequent group call media transmissions are controlled using transmission
control signalling.
\- The MCVideo server may tear down the media plane between successive group
calls using the chat model, or the MCVideo server may allow the media plane to
remain up between successive group calls using the chat model depending on
resources.
Leaving and releasing a chat group:
\- When a user wants to leave a chat group call, the client shall send a group
call leave request to the server and release the media plane.
\- The server can release a chat group call by sending a group call release to
all joined clients. A server initiated release also releases the media plane
for all joined clients.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.2.2 Chat group call setup {#chat-group-call-setup .H6}
MCVideo client 1, client 2, and client 3 are served by the home MCVideo
service provider in figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo user 2 and MCVideo user 3 have previously joined (affiliated) to
the group call. MCVideo client 1, client 2, and client 3 are registered and
all users (MCVideo user 1, user 2, and user 3) have been authenticated and
authorized to use the MCVideo service.
2\. MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 may have activated
functional alias(es) configured to be used during the group call
communication. No call is currently in progress for the group.
3\. The MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
4\. The MCVideo user on MCVideo client 1 may have bound a functional alias to
the MCVideo group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [6]).
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.2-1: MCVideo chat group call
1\. MCVideo user 1 indicates to join the group communication for the group.
This may include a transmit media request.
1a. MCVideo client 1 sends a group join request with the MCVideo group ID of
the desired group. It contains the MCVideo user\'s MCVideo ID and the MCVideo
client media parameters. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a
functional alias used within the MCVideo group join request. If there is a
request for media transmission, then the group join request contains an
indication of an implicit transmit media request. If the group join request
includes an implicit transmit media request it may also include location
information.
1b. The MCVideo server receives the group join request. MCVideo server
generates an implicit affiliation (if the MCVideo user is not already
affiliated to the group) and verifies that MCVideo user 1 is authorized to
affiliate to the group by following the affiliation procedure for MCVideo. If
a functional alias is present, the MCVideo server checks whether it is allowed
to be used and if it has been activated for the user.
If the functional alias is provided only in the group join request, or via
binding, the MCVideo server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the
functional alias is provided in both the group join request and via binding,
it is up to the MCVideo server implementation to determine a value for the
functional alias to be used.
If location information was included in the group join request, the MCVideo
server checks the privacy policy of the MCVideo user to decide if the location
information of MCVideo client 1 can be provided to other users on the call.
1c. The MCVideo server replies with a group join response indicating the
acceptance of the group join request and also returns the MCVideo server
selected media parameters for the group call in the group join response.
2\. If MCVideo user 1 requests to transmit media by sending transmit media
request to MCVideo server, the MCVideo server establishes the media plane (if
not already established) for the call.
3\. Transmission control will continue to be used by the transmission control
participants associated with MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo
client 3 for the duration of the call. .If present, the functional alias of
MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 are displayed where
appropriate.
##### 7.1.2.3.1.2.3 Release chat group call {#release-chat-group-call .H6}
The procedure describes the case where the MCVideo server releases an ongoing
MCVideo group call for all the participants of that group call, since at least
one of the conditions for release are met e.g. due to chat duration expiry,
last participant leaving or initiator leaving.
NOTE 1: The procedure for an MCVideo user leaving the group call is a
different procedure.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.3-1 are the procedures for the MCVideo server
initiating the release of an ongoing MCVideo group call.
The following precondition applies:
\- A group call is ongoing between MCVideo clients 1, 2 and 3
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.3-1: Release chat group call
1\. MCVideo server would like to release the MCVideo group call which is
ongoing e.g., due to chat duration expiry, last participant leaving, or
initiator leaving.
2\. MCVideo server identifies the participants of the ongoing group call and
generates group call release request to release the ongoing session.
3\. MCVideo server sends a group call release request towards each participant
of the ongoing group call.
NOTE 2: The group call release request can also be sent over SIP signalling on
the signalling plane.
4\. MCVideo users are notified about the release of the group call.
5\. Optionally the MCVideo client(s) receiving group call release request, may
send a group call release response to the MCVideo server.
NOTE 3: The MCVideo client can send group call release response when the group
call release request is sent using a unicast bearer.
6\. MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 release the transmission control
and media plane resources associated with the group call that is released.
Successful release of the group call does not affect the status of affiliation
of any of the clients.

5\. The MCVideo user on MCVideo client 1 may have bound a functional alias to
the MCVideo group ID (3GPP TS 23.280 [6]).
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.5-1: Late entry of a newly joined group member
1\. MCVideo client 1 sends a group join request with the MCVideo group ID of
the desired group. It contains the MCVideo user\'s MCVideo ID and the MCVideo
client media parameters. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a
functional alias used within the MCVideo group join request. If there is a
request to transmit, then the group join request contains an indication of an
implicit transmit media request.
2\. The MCVideo server receives the group join request. MCVideo server
generates an implicit affiliation (if the MCVideo user is not already
affiliated to the group) and verifies that MCVideo user 1 is authorized to
affiliate to the group. If a functional alias is present, the MCVideo server
checks whether it is allowed to be used and if it has been activated for the
user.
If the functional alias is provided only in the group join request, or via
binding, the MCVideo server proceeds with the value that is provided. If the
functional alias is provided in both the group join request and via binding,
it is up to the MCVideo server implementation to determine a value for the
functional alias to be used.
3\. The MCVideo server replies with a group join response indicating the
acceptance of the group join request.
4\. Media plane between MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo server is established
using media plane control signalling.
> 5\. MCVideo users at MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 may be notified
> about the MCVideo client 1 joining the group call, and the functional alias
> of MCVideo client 1 may be displayed.
6\. The MCVideo server may send (6a) Media transmission notification to
MCVideo client 1, indicating the current transmitter. Alternatively the
MCVideo server may send (6b) Transmit media granted, (6b) Transmit media
rejected or (6d) Queue position info.
7\. Transmission control will continue to be used by the transmission control
participants associated with MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo
client 3. If present, the functional alias of MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client
2 and MCVideo client 3 are displayed where appropriate.

4\. The MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.1.2.3.1.2.6-1: Late entry of an MCVideo client returning from out of
coverage
1\. MCVideo client 1 or MCVideo server detects that MCVideo client 1 has
returned from out of coverage.
NOTE 1: How the MCVideo client or MCVideo server detects that the client has
returned from out of coverage is out of scope of the present document.
2\. Media plane between MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo server is re-established
using media plane control signalling.
NOTE 2: Depending on how long MCVideo client 1 was out of coverage, this step
can include signalling from MCVideo client 1 to rejoin the chat group.
3\. The MCVideo server may send (3a) Media transmission notification to
MCVideo client 1, indicating the current transmitter. Alternatively, the
MCVideo server may send (3b) Transmit media granted, (3c) Transmit media
rejected or (3d) Queue position info.
4\. MCVideo users at MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 may be notified
about the MCVideo client 1 returning to the group call, and the functional
alias of MCVideo client 1 may be displayed.
5\. Transmission control will continue to be used by the transmission control
participants associated with MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo
client 3. If present, the functional alias of MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client
2 and MCVideo client 3 are displayed where appropriate.
##### 7.1.2.3.2 Exiting group call due to de-affiliation
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCVideo server requesting a newly de-affiliated member to leave an
ongoing MCVideo group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCVideo users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MC system.
2\. MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client n are on an ongoing
call.
3\. MCVideo client 1 has been de-affiliated from the MCVideo group.

users at MCVideo client 2 to MCVideo client n may be notified that MCVideo
client 1 has left the group call.
##### 7.1.2.3.3 MCVideo user leaving a group call
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.3.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCVideo user leaving an ongoing MCVideo group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server with
MCVideo users affiliated to that group. All members of the group belong to the
same MC system.
2\. MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client n are on an ongoing
call.
3\. MCVideo user 1 indicates to leave the group call
Figure 7.1.2.3.3-1: MCVideo user leaving a group call
1\. MCVideo client 1 sends a group call leave request to the MCVideo server.
2\. MCVideo server sends a group call leave response to MCVideo client 1.
3\. Release of transmission control and media plane resources associated with
the group call for MCVideo client 1.
NOTE 1: MCVideo server checks if group call termination conditions are met,
e.g. last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator
leaving, minimum number of affiliated MCVideo group members are not present .
If at least one of the group call termination conditions is met, the MCVideo
server releases the group call for all participants (see subclauses
7.1.2.3.1.1.3 Release pre-arranged group call and 7.1.2.3.1.2.3 Release chat
group call).
4\. MCVideo users at MCVideo client 2 to MCVideo client n may be notified that
the MCVideo user of client 1 has left the group call.
NOTE 2: The MCVideo server does not perform late entry for MCVideo users that
have left the group call.
#### 7.1.2.4 Broadcast group call
##### 7.1.2.4.1 General
A broadcast group call is a special group call where the initiating MCVideo
user expects no response from the other MCVideo users, i.e. no response from
the recipients is required to start media transmission and the call ends when
the media transmission is complete.
##### 7.1.2.4.2 Common broadcast group call procedure
Only the call originator can transmit media during the broadcast group call
and the broadcast group call is released when the transmission is complete.
Figure 7.1.2.4.2-1 illustrates the common procedure both for group-broadcast
group call and user-broadcast group call.
Pre-condition:
1\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 are members of a group-broadcast
group/user-broadcast group.
Figure 7.1.2.4.2-1: Broadcast group call
1\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates the broadcast group call setup
procedure with the indication of broadcast group call. The signalling
procedure is identical to the group call setup as described in subclause
7.1.2.3.1.1 with the inclusion of the parameter for broadcast group call
indicator.
2\. MCVideo client 1 starts to transmit media.
NOTE 1: Only the call originating MCVideo user is allowed to transmit media on
broadcast group call.
NOTE 2: A broadcast group call transmitted on a user-broadcast group has
priority over group calls involving users within the user hierarchy. A
broadcast group call transmitted on a group-broadcast group has priority over
group calls on its subordinate groups.
3\. If the media transmission from call originating MCVideo user is complete,
the broadcast group call is released.
#### 7.1.2.5 Emergency and imminent peril procedures
##### 7.1.2.5.1 MCVideo emergency group call
###### 7.1.2.5.1.1 MCVideo emergency group call commencement
The procedure describes the case where an MCVideo client is initiating an
MCVideo emergency group call with the affiliated MCVideo group members of that
MCVideo group. An MCVideo client in the MCVideo emergency state gains elevated
access privilege for all of the MCVideo user\'s mission critical applications.
Initiating an MCVideo emergency group call puts the MCVideo group into the in-
progress emergency state. While in the in-progress emergency state, all
MCVideo group calls in the MCVideo group are processed as MCVideo emergency
group calls by the MCVideo server until the emergency state of the MCVideo
group is cancelled.
Figure 7.1.2.5.1.1-1 shows the procedures for the MCVideo client initiating
establishment of an MCVideo emergency group call with an MCVideo group i.e.,
MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3
belong to the same MCVideo group which is defined on group management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCVideo server is shown in place of a user
home MCVideo server and a group hosting MCVideo server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server
with MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 affiliated to that MCVideo group.
2\. All members of the MCVideo group belong to the same MC system.
3\. The initiating MCVideo client 1 has been provisioned with an MCVideo group
that has been designated via provisioning as the MCVideo emergency group.
4 MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 may have an
activated functional alias to be used during the emergency group
communication.
5\. The MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
NOTE 2: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the selected group.
Figure 7.1.2.5.1.1-1: MCVideo emergency group call
1\. The user at the MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo emergency group
call. MCVideo client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. The MCVideo emergency
state of MCVideo client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user
of MCVideo client 1.
NOTE 3: While MCVideo client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCVideo group
and private calls initiated by MCVideo client 1 are initiated as MCVideo
emergency calls.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo emergency group call request towards the
MCVideo server. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a functional
alias used within the MCVideo emergency group call request. The request
contains an indication of the MCVideo emergency. The MCVideo server records
the identity of the MCVideo user that initiated the MCVideo emergency group
call until the MCVideo emergency state of the group is cancelled. Once an
MCVideo emergency call has been initiated, the MCVideo group is considered to
be in an in-progress emergency state until the emergency state of the group
cancelled. If configured to send an MCVideo emergency alert when initiating an
MCVideo emergency group call, the request also contains an indication that an
MCVideo emergency alert is to be initiated. The request may contain an
indication of an implicit transmit media request.
NOTE 4: While the MCVideo group is in the in-progress emergency state, all
MCVideo group calls within the group are processed as emergency group calls by
the MCVideo server. MCVideo group members that are not in the emergency state
do not indicate emergency in group call requests but can set the requested
priority of all group call requests to high priority.
3\. The MCVideo server implicitly affiliates MCVideo client 1 to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. MCVideo server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to
be used and has been activated for the MCVideo user, and whether the MCVideo
user of MCVideo client 1 is authorized for initiation of MCVideo emergency
calls on the indicated MCVideo group, and if authorized, it resolves the
MCVideo group ID to determine the members of that MCVideo group and their
affiliation status, based on the information from group management server.
5\. The MCVideo server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for
all participants in the MCVideo group.
NOTE 5: Successive calls during the MCVideo group\'s in-progress emergency
state will all receive the adjusted bearer priority.
6\. MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call request towards the
MCVideo clients of each of those affiliated MCVideo group members. The request
contains an indication of the in-progress emergency. The request contains an
indication of an MCVideo emergency alert if the request from the originator
indicated MCVideo emergency alert.
7\. MCVideo users are notified of the incoming MCVideo group call, and, if
available, the functional alias of the initiating user is displayed.
8\. The receiving MCVideo clients send the MCVideo emergency group call
response to the MCVideo server to acknowledge the MCVideo emergency group call
request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
9\. The MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call response to the
MCVideo user 1 to inform the successful MCVideo emergency call establishment.
NOTE 6: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 10
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 have successfully
established media plane for communication. MCVideo transmission control
participant 1, transmission control participant 2 and transmission control
participant 3 exchange transmission control information e.g., MCVideo client 1
receives the transmit media granted information over the established media
plane, while the other MCVideo client\'s receive media available notification
with forced reception information. MCVideo client 1 indicates to the MCVideo
user that the permission is granted to transmit media, while the other MCVideo
clients in the MCVideo emergency group call will be receiving that media.
MCVideo client 1 can override other clients in the call except those that are
also in the MCVideo emergency state.
###### 7.1.2.5.1.2 MCVideo group call upgraded to an MCVideo emergency group
call
The procedure describes the case where an authorized MCVideo user is upgrading
an MCVideo group call to an MCVideo emergency group call while the MCVideo
group call is already in progress.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.5.1.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCVideo client upgrading an MCVideo group call on an MCVideo group to
an MCVideo emergency group call.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MCVideo server is shown in place of a user
home MCVideo server and a group hosting MCVideo server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server
with MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 affiliated to that MCVideo group.
2\. All members of the MCVideo group belong to the same MC system.
3\. An MCVideo group call is already in progress.
4\. The initiating MCVideo client 1 has been configured to send an MCVideo
emergency alert when upgrading an MCVideo emergency group call.
Figure 7.1.2.5.1.2-1: MCVideo group call upgraded to an MCVideo emergency
group call
1\. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates a group emergency. MCVideo
client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. The MCVideo emergency state of
MCVideo client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCVideo
client 1.
NOTE 2: While MCVideo client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCVideo group
and private calls initiated by MCVideo client 1 are initiated as MCVideo
emergency calls.
2\. MCVideo client 1 requests the MCVideo server to upgrade the MCVideo group
to an in-progress emergency state by sending an MCVideo emergency group call
request. If configured to send an MCVideo alert when initiating an MCVideo
emergency upgrade, the request also contains an indication that an MCVideo
alert is to be initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit
transmit media request.
NOTE 3: While the MCVideo group is in the in-progress emergency state, all
MCVideo group calls within the group are processed as emergency group calls by
the MCVideo server. MCVideo group members that are not in the emergency state
do not indicate emergency in group call requests but can set the requested
priority of all group call requests to high priority.
3\. The MCVideo server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for all
participants in the MCVideo group.
4\. MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call request towards the
MCVideo clients of each of those affiliated MCVideo group members. The request
contains an indication of an MCVideo emergency alert if the request from the
originator indicated MCVideo emergency alert.
5\. MCVideo users are notified of the in-progress emergency state of the
MCVideo group.
6\. The receiving MCVideo clients send the MCVideo emergency group call
response to the MCVideo server to acknowledge the MCVideo group emergency
request. For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not sent.
7\. The MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency group call response to the
MCVideo user 1 to confirm the upgrade request. If the MCVideo emergency
request contained an implicit transmit media request, the OK message contains
the result of the implicit transmit media request.
NOTE 4: Step 7 can occur at any time following step 3, and prior to step 8
depending on the conditions to proceed with the call.
MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 continue with the
MCVideo group call, which has been transformed into an MCVideo emergency group
call. MCVideo client 1 can override other clients in the call except those
that are also in the MCVideo emergency state.
###### 7.1.2.5.1.3 MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel
NOTE 1: In Rel-14 and Rel-13 versions of this specification the title of this
subclause is \"MCVideo emergency group call cancel\".
The procedure describes the case where an MCVideo client cancels an MCVideo
group\'s in-progress emergency state. The emergency state of the group may
alternatively be cancelled by the emergency alert cancellation procedure
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16], subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.5.1.3-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCVideo client cancelling an in-progress emergency of a group.
NOTE 2: For simplicity, a single MCVideo server is shown in place of a user
home MCVideo server and a group hosting MCVideo server.
NOTE 3: The end of the MCVideo emergency group call does not cancel the
MCVideo group\'s in-progress emergency state. It is explicitly cancelled by an
authorized user using this procedure, or by the emergency alert cancellation
procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5], subclause 10.10.1.2.2.2.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server
with MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 affiliated to that MCVideo group.
2\. All members of the MCVideo group belong to the same MC system.
3\. MCVideo group members have been notified about the in-progress emergency.
4\. The MCVideo group is in the in-progress emergency state and has
prioritized bearer support.
5\. MCVideo client 1 previously initiated the in-progress emergency for the
group.
Figure 7.1.2.5.1.3-1: MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel
1\. The user at the MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo in-progress
emergency group state cancel.
NOTE 4: An MCVideo user authorized to cancel in-progress emergencies on the
MCVideo group can also be authorised to cancel the MCVideo emergency alert in
addition to the initiator. However, only the initiator can cancel the
initiator\'s local MCVideo emergency state.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel
request to the MCVideo server.
NOTE 5: If an MCVideo emergency alert relating to MCVideo client 1 is in
effect together with an MCVideo in-progress emergency group state on the
MCVideo group, the MCVideo emergency alert of MCVideo client 1 can be
cancelled at the same time. In that case, the MCVideo in-progress emergency
group state request carries an indication that the emergency alert of MCVideo
client 1 is also being cancelled.
NOTE 6: If an MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel request is
received by the MCVideo server while a group member that is in the emergency
state is transmitting, the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state cancel
request is rejected by the MCVideo server.
3\. MCVideo server resolves the MCVideo group ID to determine the members of
that MCVideo group and their affiliation status, based upon the information
from group management server.
4\. The MCVideo server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer; priority
treatment is no longer required. The MCVideo server cancels/resets the
emergency in-progress state of the MCVideo group.
5\. The MCVideo server sends an MCVideo in-progress emergency group state
cancel request to the MCVideo group members.
6\. MCVideo group members are notified of the MCVideo in-progress emergency
group state cancel.
7\. The receiving MCVideo clients send the MCVideo in-progress emergency group
state cancel response to the MCVideo server to acknowledge the MCVideo in-
progress emergency group state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these
acknowledgements are not sent.
8\. The MCVideo server sends the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state
cancel response to the MCVideo user 1 to confirm the MCVideo in-progress
emergency group state cancel. If the MCVideo in-progress emergency group state
cancel request (in step 2) contained the \"Alert indicator\" IE, the MCVideo
client 1 resets its local emergency status.
NOTE 7: Step 8 can occur at any time following step 4, depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
##### 7.1.2.5.2 MCVideo imminent peril group call
###### 7.1.2.5.2.1 MCVideo imminent peril group call commencement
The procedure focuses on the case where an authorized MCVideo user is
initiating an imminent peril group call for communicating with the affiliated
MCVideo members of that MCVideo group. This procedure will gain elevated
access privilege for the MCVideo client if it is not already in that state.
The access privilege for other applications will not necessarily be affected.
Procedures in figure 7.1.2.5.2.1-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of an imminent peril group
call with an MCVideo group i.e., MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, MCVideo
client 2 and MCVideo client 3 belong to the same MCVideo group which is
defined on MCVideo group management server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCVideo group is previously defined on the group management server
with MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 affiliated to that MCVideo group.
2\. All members of the MCVideo group belong to the same MC system.
3\. The initiating MCVideo client 1 has been provisioned with an MCVideo group
that has been designated in the provisioning to be used for imminent peril
communications.
4\. MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 may have an
activated functional alias to be used during the emergency group
communication.
5\. The MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
NOTE 1: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for imminent
peril behaviour on the selected group.
Figure 7.1.2.5.2.1-1: MCVideo imminent peril group call
1\. The user at the MCVideo client 1 initiates an imminent peril group call.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo imminent peril group call request
towards the MCVideo server. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a
functional alias used within the MCVideo imminent peril group call request.
The request contains an indication of the in-progress imminent peril. The
MCVideo server records the identity of the MCVideo user that initiated the
imminent peril group call until the in-progress imminent peril state is
cancelled. Once an imminent peril group call has been initiated, the MCVideo
group is considered to be in an in-progress imminent peril state until
cancelled. The request may contain an indication of an implicit transmit media
request.
3\. The MCVideo server implicitly affiliates MCVideo client 1 to the imminent
peril group if the client is not already affiliated.
4\. MCVideo server checks whether the provided functional alias is allowed to
be used and has been activated for the MCVideo user, and whether the MCVideo
user of MCVideo client 1 is authorized for initiation of imminent peril group
calls on the indicated MCVideo group, and if authorized, it resolves the
MCVideo group ID to determine the members of that MCVideo group and their
affiliation status, based on the information from group management server.
5\. The MCVideo server configures the priority of the underlying bearers for
all participants in the MCVideo group.
NOTE 2: Successive calls during the in-progress imminent peril state will all
receive the adjusted bearer priority.
6\. MCVideo server sends the imminent peril group call request towards the
MCVideo clients of each of those affiliated MCVideo group members. The request
contains an indication of the in-progress imminent peril.
7\. MCVideo users are notified of the incoming imminent peril call, and, if
available, the functional alias of the initiating user is displayed.
8\. The receiving MCVideo clients send the MCVideo imminent peril group call
response to the MCVideo server to acknowledge the imminent peril call request.
For a multicast call, these acknowledgements are not set.
9\. The MCVideo server sends the MCVideo imminent peril group call response to
the MCVideo user 1 to inform the successful imminent peril call establishment.
If the MCVideo imminent peril request contained an implicit transmit media
request, the OK message contains the result of the implicit transmit media
request.
NOTE 3: Step 9 can occur at any time following step 5, and prior to step 10
depending on the conditions to proceed with the imminent peril call.
MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 have successfully
established media plane for communication. MCVideo transmission control
participant 1, transmission control participant 2 and transmission control
participant 3 exchange transmission control information e.g., MCVideo client 1
receives the transmit media granted information over the established media
plane, while the other MCVideo clients receive media available notification
with forced reception mode information. MCVideo client 1 indicates to the
MCVideo user that the permission is granted to transmit media, while the other
MCVideo clients in the imminent peril call will be receiving that media.
###### 7.1.2.5.2.2 Imminent peril group call upgrade

#### 7.1.3.3 Group communication setup
##### 7.1.3.3.1 General
A group communication setup is initiated by one member of a pre-configured
MCVideo group and ends up with an established MCVideo group between multiple
MCVideo clients ready for video sharing.
##### 7.1.3.3.2 Procedure
Figure 7.1.3.3.2-1 describes procedures to establish a MCVideo group
communication with other MCVideo clients.
Once the MCVideo group communication is established the MCVideo clients send
Group communication announcement periodically.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCVideo
group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MCVideo
client 1 to client N.
2\. MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N are members of the same MCVideo
group.
3\. MCVideo user 1 has initiated MCVideo group communication.
Figure 7.1.3.3.2-1: MCVideo group communication setup
1\. MCVideo client 1 sends a Group communication announcement message to the
MCVideo group.
2\. Upon receiving the Group communication announcement message, all MCVideo
clients that are not part of an ongoing group communication for the MCVideo
group indicated in the Group communication announcement message set parameters
for the media plane as described in the Group communication announcement
message.
3\. The MCVideo clients send a group communication answer response to the
MCVideo group confirming the participation in the MCVideo group communication.
On receiving a group communication answer response message from at least one
MCVideo client, other MCVideo clients need not send a group communication
answer response message. If the Group communication announcement message
included a confirm mode indication, then the MCVideo clients should send a
group communication answer response message.
NOTE 1: MCVideo client 1 should wait for at least one group communication
answer response message before transmitting video to the MCVideo group.
4\. MCVideo client 1 checks the participants of the MCVideo group
communication through the received group communication answer response
messages.
NOTE 2: Due to the movement of the participants (in and out of the radio
coverage) during the off-network group communication, the Group communication
announcement message, including parameters for media delivery, is periodically
sent.
NOTE 3: Group communication announcement may include user ID, group ID, media
type codec, control port for transmission video, video resolution and video
frame rate, video mode, last chage time of video mode etc.
5\. MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 have successfully
established the media plane and transmission control for communication.
#### 7.1.3.4 Passive join to group communication
##### 7.1.3.4.1 General
There is ongoing group communication between multiple MCVideo clients. Another
MCVideo client, after becoming aware of that group communication and after it
has received periodically sent communication parameters, joins the group with
or without sending an indication to other group members.
##### 7.1.3.4.2 Procedure
Figure 7.1.3.4.2-1 describes procedures to join a MCVideo group communication
passively.
The MCVideo client X passively waits for a Group communication announcement
message. Upon receiving a periodic Group communication announcement message,
MCVideo client X establishes media plane and joins the MCVideo group
communication.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCVideo
group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MCVideo
client 1 to client N and client X.
2\. MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N and MCVideo client X are members of
the same MCVideo group.
3\. MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N are part of an ongoing MCVideo group
communication.
Figure 7.1.3.4.2-1: Passive join to MCVideo group communication
1\. Another MCVideo client X enters in the communication range after the
MCVideo group communication establishment. The MCVideo client X does not do
anything and passively waits for a periodic Group communication announcement
message.
2\. An MCVideo client which is part of the ongoing MCVideo group communication
eventually sends a periodic Group communication announcement message.
3\. Upon receiving the periodic Group communication announcement message
MCVideo client X sets the parameters for media plane as described in the Group
communication announcement message.
4\. If the Group communication announcement message included a confirm mode
indication, MCVideo client X may sends a group communication answer response
towards MCVideo group to inform all MCVideo group members of its participation
the MCVideo group communication.
5\. MCVideo group communication continues with the MCVideo client X.
#### 7.1.3.5 Active join to group communication
##### 7.1.3.5.1 General
There is ongoing group communication between multiple MCVideo clients. Another
MCVideo client, after becoming aware of that group communication, sends a
request to get the required communication parameters and after feedback joins
the group with or without sending an indication to other group members.
##### 7.1.3.5.2 Procedure
Figure 7.1.3.5.2-1 describes procedures to join a MCVideo group communication
actively.
The MCVideo client X sends a Group communication announcement message towards
the MCVideo group.
Upon receiving a Group communication announcement message with new
communication parameters, such as communication identifier, a MCVideo client
participating in the on-going group communication for the MCVideo group sends
a Group communication announcement message.
The Group communication announcement message contains parameters for the on-
going MCVideo group communication. MCVideo client X upon receiving such a
Group communication announcement message establishes the media plane as
described in the message and joins the MCVideo group communication.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MCVideo
group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in MCVideo
client 1 to client N and client X.
2\. MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N and MCVideo client X are members of
the same MCVideo group.
3\. MCVideo client 1 to MCVideo client N are part of an ongoing MCVideo group
communication.
Figure 7.1.3.5.2-1: Active join to MCVideo group communication
1\. Another MCVideo client X enters in the communication range after the
MCVideo group communication establishment. The MCVideo client X sends a Group
communication announcement message to start a newMCVideo group communication.
2\. Upon receiving a Group communication announcement message with new
communication parameters, such as communication identifier, another MCVideo
client, which is part of the ongoing MCVideo group communication sends a Group
communication announcement message.
3\. Upon receiving the Group communication announcement message MCVideo client
X sets parameters for the media plane as described in the Group communication
announcement message.
4\. If the Group communication announcement message included a confirm mode
indication, MCVideo client X may send a group communication answer response
towards MCVideo group to inform all MCVideo group members of its participation
the MCVideo group communication.
5\. MCVideo group communication continues with the MCVideo client X.
#### 7.1.3.6 Broadcast group communication
Figure 7.1.3.6-1 describes procedures for broadcast group communication.
Broadcast group communication over group-broadcast group and over user-
broadcast group are handled without distinction in off-network.
Figure 7.1.3.6-1: Broadcast group communication
1\. MCVideo client 1 initiates group communication setup as described in
subclause 7.1.3.3. The group communication announcement message includes the
indication of broadcast group communication.
2\. MCVideo client 1 initiating broadcast group communication starts to
transmit video.
NOTE: Other clients of the group member are not allowed to transmit media in
broadcast group communication.
3\. The broadcast group communication is released as described in subclause
7.1.3.7.
#### 7.1.3.7 Group communication release due to inactivity
If the on-going MCVideo group communication is inactive for a specific
duration, the participating MCVideo clients release the MCVideo group
communication. Inactivity is defined as absence of any transmission to or from
other communication participants.
NOTE: Inactivity time can be set according to the policy of MC service
provider.
#### 7.1.3.8 Emergency and imminent peril procedures
##### 7.1.3.8.1 Emergency group communication
The off-network emergency group communication is a special case of off-network
(non-emergency) group communication as defined in subclause 7.1.3.2, subclause
7.1.3.3, subclause 7.1.3.4, subclause 7.1.3.5, subclause 7.1.3.6 and subclause
7.1.3.7. The following are modifications to the aforementioned subclauses to
support MCVideo emergency group communications:
\- As a pre-condition, the client initiating the emergency communication has
previously been provisioned with an MCVideo group designated as the MCVideo
emergency group. The MCVideo client initiates MCVideo emergency group
communications on this group. Alternatively, the MCVideo client could have
been provisioned for emergency behaviour on the selected MCVideo group.
\- The group communication announcement contains an indication that the
MCVideo group communication is to be an MCVideo emergency communication
regardless of whether or not the MCVideo client is in communication. Group
communication participants learn of the MCVideo group\'s in-progress emergency
state from the indication.
\- Every communication initiated by the MCVideo client will be an emergency
communication while the MCVideo client is in MCVideo emergency state.
\- The MCVideo client enters the MCVideo emergency state when initiating an
MCVideo emergency communication or emergency alert. Only the MCVideo user of
the MCVideo client can clear the client\'s local MCVideo emergency state.
\- The MCVideo group in-progress emergency state is cancelled when the
communication ends.
\- The MCVideo user who initiated the emergency communication, or upgraded the
group communication to emergency group communication, or an authorized user,
may cancel the in-progress emergency state with an MCVideo emergency group
communication cancel message. The message is sent to the MCVideo group.
\- When the MCVideo group is no longer in the in-progress emergency state,
every client returns the value of ProSe Per Packet Priority to its default
value.
\- An in-progress MCVideo group communication is upgraded to an emergency
group communication when the periodic group communication announcement
contains the emergency indicator.
\- The value of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to emergency
state of MCVideo group communication.
\- An MCVideo group communication upgraded to emergency group communication
does not affect the state of other MCVideo communication(s) in the client.
\- The MCVideo group remains in the in-progress emergency state until the
emergency group communication ends or the in-progress emergency state is
cancelled.
##### 7.1.3.8.2 MCVideo imminent peril
The off-network imminent peril group communication is a special case of off-
network (non-imminent peril) group communication as defined in subclause
7.1.3.2, subclause 7.1.3.3, subclause 7.1.3.4, subclause 7.1.3.5, subclause
7.1.3.6 and subclause 7.1.3.7. The following are modifications to the
aforementioned subclauses to support MCVideo imminent peril communications:
\- As a pre-condition, the user initiating the imminent peril communication
has previously been provisioned with an MCVideo group to be used as the
MCVideo imminent peril group. The MCVideo client initiates MCVideo imminent
peril group communications on this group. Alternatively, the MCVideo client
could have been provisioned for imminent peril behaviour on the selected
MCVideo group.
\- The group communication announcement contains an indication that the
MCVideo group communication is to be an MCVideo imminent peril communication.
Group communication participants learn of the MCVideo group\'s in-progress
imminent peril condition from the indication.
\- The MCVideo group in-progress imminent peril state is considered cancelled
when the communication ends.
\- The MCVideo user who initiated the in-progress imminent peril communication
or upgraded the group communication to imminent peril group communication, or
an authorized user may cancel the in-progress imminent peril state with an
MCVideo imminent peril group communication cancel message. The message is sent
to the communication participants.
\- When the MCVideo group is no longer in the in-progress imminent peril
state, every MCVideo client returns the value of ProSe Per Packet Priority to
its default value.
\- An in-progress MCVideo group communication is upgraded to an imminent peril
group communication when the periodic group communication announcement
contains the imminent peril indicator.
\- The value of ProSe Per Packet Priority is upgraded according to imminent
peril state of MCVideo group communication.
\- The MCVideo group remains in the in-progress imminent peril state until the
imminent peril group communication ends or the in-progress imminent peril
state is cancelled.
#### 7.1.3.9 MCVideo emergency alert
##### 7.1.3.9.1 General
The MCVideo client use emergency alert initiation and emergency alert cancel
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6], with the following clarifications:
\- The MC service ID is the MCVideo ID; and
\- The MC service group ID is the MCVideo group ID.

#### 7.2.2.3 Private call within one MC system
##### 7.2.2.3.1 Private call setup in automatic commencement mode
The procedure describes the scenario where an MCVideo user is initiating an
MCVideo private call for communicating with another MCVideo user, with or
without transmission control enabled, in an automatic commencement mode.
Procedures in figure 7.2.2.3.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo client initiating establishment of MCVideo private
call with the chosen MCVideo user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 are already
registered for receiving MCVideo service.
2\. The calling MCVideo user has selected automatic commencement mode for the
call; or
3\. The called MCVideo client is set to automatic commencement mode.
4\. Optionally, the MCVideo client 1 may have a functional alias activated to
be used.
5\. The MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.2.2.3.1-1: Private call setup in automatic commencement mode--
MCVideo users in the same MC system
1\. User at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an MCVideo private call
for the chosen MCVideo user. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include
a functional alias used within the MCVideo private call.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo private call request towards the MCVideo
server (via SIP core) using a service identifier as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228
[5] for MCVideo, for establishing a private call with the chosen MCVideo user.
The MCVideo private call request contains the MCVideo ID or the functional
alias of invited user, an SDP offer containing one or more media types. The
MCVideo client 1 may include a Requested commencement mode that indicates that
the call is to be established in automatic commencement mode if automatic
commencement mode is requested by the initiating user.
NOTE 1: As part of this step, MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 set up a
security association (when no functional alias is present), if end-to-end
encryption is used for this call.
3\. MCVideo server checks whether the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is
authorized to initiate the private call, and that MCVideo user at MCVideo
client 2 is authorized to receive the private call. MCVideo server verifies
whether the provided functional alias, if present, can be used and has been
activated for the user. If the MCVideo private call request contains a
functional alias instead of an MCVideo ID as called party, the MCVideo server
shall resolve the functional alias to the corresponding MCVideo ID(s) for
which the functional alias is active. The MCVideo server shall also check
whether MCVideo client 1 is allowed to use the functional alias of MCVideo
client 2 to setup a private call and whether MCVideo client 2 is allowed to
receive a private call from MCVideo client 1 using the functional alias. If
the MCVideo private call request requested automatic commencement mode then
the MCVideo server also checks whether the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is
authorized to initiate a private call in automatic commencement mode.
NOTE 2: When a functional alias is shared among multiple MCVideo users, only
one target MCVideo user can be target of the private call request. The MCVideo
server resolves the associated MCVideo IDs of the functional alias and
determines a MCVideo ID by help of criteria not defined here (e.g. location,
time etc). This determination can include rejection of the call, if no
suitable MCVideo ID is selected.
4a. If the MCVideo private call request contains only the functional alias
instead of an MCVideo ID for the called party, the MCVideo server responds
with a functional alias resolution response message that contains the resolved
MCVideo ID back to MCVideo client 1.
4b. If the MCVideo server replies with a MCVideo functional alias resolution
response message, the MCVideo client 1 abandons the first MCVideo private call
request in step 2 and sends a new MCVideo private call request towards the
resolved MCVideo ID.
NOTE 3: MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 set up a security association
for the media, if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.
5\. MCVideo server may provide a progress indication to MCVideo client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE 4: Step 5 can occur at any time following step 4b, and prior to step 9.
6\. If authorized, MCVideo server includes information that it communicates
using MCVideo service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media
types contained in the initial received request, includes the requested
automatic commencement mode indication based on a requested automatic
commencement mode by the calling user or based upon the setting of the called
MCVideo client and sends the corresponding MCVideo private call request
towards the MCVideo client 2, including the MC service ID and, if available
the functional alias of the calling MCVideo user 1. If the called MCVideo user
has registered to the MCVideo service with multiple MCVideo UEs and has
designated the MCVideo UE for receiving the private calls, then the incoming
MCVideo private call request is delivered only to the designated MCVideo UE.
7\. The receiving MCVideo client 2 notifies the user about the incoming
private call. If the functional alias of the calling user is included, it is
displayed.
8\. The receiving MCVideo client 2 accepts the private call automatically, and
an MCVideo private call response is sent to the MCVideo server (via SIP core).
9\. Upon receiving the MCVideo private call response from MCVideo client 2
accepting the private call request, the MCVideo server informs the MCVideo
client 1 about successful call establishment.
10\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 have successfully established media
plane and transmission control for communication and both users can transmit
media.
##### 7.2.2.3.2 Private call setup in manual commencement mode
###### 7.2.2.3.2.1 Description
Figure 7.2.2.3.2.2-1 describes the basic procedure for the MCVideo client
initiating an MCVideo private call that uses manual commencement mode. The
flow may use a transmit media request in the MCVideo private call request
indicating that the originator will be granted permission to transmit when the
call starts and eliminates the need for a separate initial transmit media
request message during media plane establishment. Alternatively, the call
initiation may be sent without the transmit media request, which allows the
called party to transmit media request first.
###### 7.2.2.3.2.2 Procedure
Both clients are served by the primary MC service provider in figure
7.2.2.3.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 are both registered and their
respective users, MCVideo user 1 and MCVideo user 2, are authenticated and
authorized to use the MCVideo service.
2\. The calling MCVideo user has selected manual commencement mode or has not
specified a commencement mode for the call; and
3\. The called MCVideo client is set to manual commencement mode.
4\. Optionally, the MCVideo client 1 may have a functional alias activated to
be used.
5\. The MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.2.2.3.2.2-1: MCVideo private call in manual commencement mode--
MCVideo users in the same MC system
1\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an MCVideo private
call for the selected MCVideo user. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may
include a functional alias used within the MCVideo private call.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo private call request addressed to the MC
service ID of MCVideo user 2 using an MCVideo service identifier as defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [5] (possible for the SIP core to route the request to the
MCVideo server). The MCVideo private call request contains the MC service ID
or the functional alias of invited user and an SDP offer containing one or
more media types. The MCVideo client 1 may include a requested commencement
mode that indicates that the call is to be established in manual commencement
mode if manual commencement mode is requested by the initiating user.
NOTE 1: As part of this step, MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 set up a
security association (when no functional alias is present), if end-to-end
encryption is used for this call.
3\. The MCVideo server confirms that both MCVideo users are authorized for the
private call. MCVideo server verifies whether the provided functional alias,
if present, can be used and has been activated for the user. If the MCVideo
private call request contains a functional alias instead of an MCVideo ID as
called party, the MCVideo server shall resolve the functional alias to the
corresponding MCVideo ID(s) for which the functional alias is active. The
MCVideo server shall also check whether MCVideo client 1 is allowed to use the
functional alias of MCVideo client 2 to setup a private call and whether
MCVideo client 2 is allowed to receive a private call from MCVideo client 1
using the functional alias. The MCVideo server checks the commencement mode
setting of the called MCVideo client and also checks whether the MCVideo user
at MCVideo client 1 is authorized to initiate a call in manual commencement
mode.
NOTE 2: When a functional alias is shared among multiple MCVideo users, only
one target MCVideo user can be target of the private call request. The MCVideo
server resolves the associated MCVideo IDs of the functional alias and
determines a MCVideo ID by help of criteria not defined here (e.g. location,
time etc). This determination can include rejection of the call, if no
suitable MCVideo ID is selected.
4a. If the MCVideo private call request contains only the functional alias
instead of an MCVideo ID for the called party, the MCVideo server responds
with a functional alias resolution response message that contains the resolved
MCVideo ID back to MCVideo client 1.
4b. If the MCVideo server provided the corresponding MCVideo ID, the MCVideo
client 1 abandons the first MCVideo private call request in step 2 and sends a
new MCVideo private call request containing the resolved MCVideo ID.
NOTE 3: MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 set up a security association
for the media, if end-to-end encryption is used for this call.
5\. The MCVideo server includes information that it communicates using MCVideo
service, offers the same media types or a subset of the media types contained
in the initial received request and sends an MCVideo private call request for
the call to MCVideo client 2, including the MC service ID, and, if available
the functional alias of the calling MCVideo user 1. If the called MCVideo user
has registered to the MCVideo service with multiple MCVideo UEs and has
designated the MCVideo UE for receiving the private calls, then the incoming
MCVideo private call request is delivered only to the designated MCVideo UE.
6\. MCVideo server may provide a progress indication to MCVideo client 1 to
indicate progress in the call setup process.
NOTE 4: Step 6 can occur at any time following step 4b, and prior to step 7b.
7a. The MCVideo user is alerted. MCVideo client 2 sends an MCVideo ringing to
the MCVideo server.
7b. The MCVideo server sends an MCVideo ringing to MCVideo client 1,
indicating that MCVideo client 2 is being alerted. If the functional alias of
the calling user is included, it is displayed.
8\. MCVideo user 2 is notified and has accepted the call using manual
commencement mode (i.e., has taken some action to accept via the user
interface).
9\. The MCVideo client 2 sends an MCVideo private call response to the MCVideo
server. If MCVideo user 2 has not accepted the incoming call, the MCVideo
client 2 sends a call failure response to the MCVideo server without adding
reason for call failure.
10\. The MCVideo server sends an MCVideo private call response to MCVideo
client 1 indicating that MCVideo user 2 has accepted the call, including the
accepted media parameters.
11\. The media plane and transmission control for communication is
established.
##### 7.2.2.3.3 Private call release
###### 7.2.2.3.3.1 Client initiated
The procedure describes the scenario where an MCVideo client is requesting to
release an ongoing MCVideo private call (with or without transmission control)
and the call established in either of the two commencement modes (manual or
automatic).
Procedures in figure 7.2.2.3.3.1-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo client initiating the release of an ongoing MCVideo
private call.
Pre-condition:
1\. It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2
are already registered for receiving MCVideo service and are involved in
private call as described in subclause 7.2.2.3.1 and subclause 7.2.2.3.2.
Figure 7.2.2.3.3.1-1: Private call release -- client initiated
1\. User at MCVideo client 1 would like to release an ongoing MCVideo private
call with MCVideo client 2.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo call end request towards the MCVideo
server (via SIP core), for tearing down the private call with the other
client.
3\. MCVideo server sends the corresponding MCVideo call end request towards
the MCVideo client specified in the original MCVideo call end request.
4\. MCVideo user is notified about the release of the private call.
5\. The receiving MCVideo client 2 acknowledges the MCVideo call end request
with a MCVideo call end response.
6\. After receiving the MCVideo call end response from MCVideo client 2, the
MCVideo server generates an MCVideo call end response for the MCVideo client
1\'s MCVideo call end request.
7\. MCVideo clients release all the media plane resources used for the private
call. Further, if the private call was established with transmission control,
transmission control resources are released.
###### 7.2.2.3.3.2 Server initiated
The procedure describes the scenario where an MCVideo server is terminating an
ongoing MCVideo private call and the call established in either of the two
commencement modes (manual or automatic), upon conditions to terminate call
e.g., MCVideo administrator configured maximum duration for MCVideo private
calls has expired or timed out due to MCVideo private call without
transmission/reception.
Procedures in figure 7.2.2.3.3.2-1 are the basic signalling control plane
procedures for the MCVideo server initiating termination of an ongoing MCVideo
private call.
Pre-condition:
1\. It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2
are already registered for receiving MCVideo service and are involved in
private call established either in manual or automatic commencement mode.
Figure 7.2.2.3.3.2-1: End private call -- server initiated
1\. Upon conditions to terminate call e.g., MCVideo administrator configured
maximum duration for MCVideo private calls has expired or timed out due to
MCVideo private call without transmission/reception, the MCVideo server
decides to initiate termination of an ongoing MCVideo private call between
MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2.
2\. MCVideo server sends an MCVideo call end request towards the MCVideo
clients 1 and 2 (via SIP core), for tearing down the private call between
them.
3\. MCVideo users at client 1 and client 2 are notified about the termination
of the private call.
4\. The MCVideo call end request receiving MCVideo clients 1 and 2 acknowledge
the request with MCVideo call end response.
5\. MCVideo clients release all the media plane resources used for the private
call. Further, if the private call was established with transmission control,
transmission control resources are released.
#### 7.2.2.4 MCVideo emergency private call
##### 7.2.2.4.1 MCVideo emergency private call commencement
This procedure describes the case where an authorized MCVideo user is
initiating an MCVideo emergency private call with unicast signalling for
communicating with another MCVideo user. An MCVideo client in the MCVideo
emergency state gains elevated access privilege for all of the MCVideo user\'s
mission critical applications.
Procedures in figure 7.2.2.4.1-1 are the procedures for the MCVideo client
initiating establishment of an MCVideo emergency private call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Both members of the MCVideo private call belong to the same MCVideo
system.
2\. The initiating MCVideo client 1 has been configured to send an MCVideo
emergency alert prior to initiating an MCVideo emergency private call.
3\. Optionally, the MCVideo client 1 may have a functional alias activated to
be used.
4\. The MCVideo server may have subscribed to the MCVideo functional alias
controlling server within the MC system for functional alias activation/de-
activation updates.
Figure 7.2.2.4.1-1 MCVideo emergency private call
1\. The user at the MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo emergency private
call. MCVideo client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. MCVideo client 1
retains the MCVideo emergency state until explicitly cancelled by the user of
MCVideo client 1.
NOTE 1: While MCVideo client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCVideo group
and private calls initiated by MCVideo client 1 are initiated as MCVideo
emergency calls.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends an MCVideo emergency private call request towards
the MCVideo server. The request contains an indication of the MCVideo
emergency. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 may include a functional alias
used within the MCVideo emergency private call. The MCVideo server verifies
whether the provided functional alias can be used. The MCVideo server records
the identity of the MCVideo user that initiated the MCVideo emergency private
call until the MCVideo emergency is cancelled. If the MCVideo client is
configured to send an MCVideo emergency alert when initiating an MCVideo
emergency private call, the request also contains an indication that an
MCVideo emergency alert is to be initiated.
3\. MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency private call request towards
the target MCVideo client. The request contains an indication of the in-
progress emergency. The request contains an indication of an MCVideo emergency
alert if the request from the originator indicated MCVideo emergency alert. If
available the request contains the functional alias of the calling MCVideo
user 1.
4\. The MCVideo user on MCVideo client 2 is notified of the incoming MCVideo
emergency private call. If the functional alias of the calling user is
included it is displayed.
NOTE 2: MCVideo client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of
receiving the MCVideo emergency private call.
5\. The receiving MCVideo client acknowledges the MCVideo emergency private
call request to the MCVideo server via a MCVideo emergency private call
response.
6\. The MCVideo server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer.
7\. The MCVideo server informs MCVideo client 1 about the successful MCVideo
emergency private call establishment via a MCVideo emergency private call
response.
8\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 establish the media plane and
transmission control for video communication.
NOTE 3: The priority for the MCVideo emergency private call is retained until
cancelled according to system policy (e.g. call end) or cancelled by an
authorized MCVideo user.
NOTE 4: The initiating MCVideo user\'s MCVideo emergency state is retained by
the system until cancelled as in subclause 7.1.2.6, or by the emergency alert
cancellation procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] subclause
10.10.1.2.2.2. The initiating MCVideo user\'s MCVideo emergency state is also
retained locally by the MCVideo client until explicitly cancelled by the
MCVideo user.
##### 7.2.2.4.2 MCVideo private call emergency upgrade
This procedure describes the case where an authorized MCVideo user is
upgrading a private call to an MCVideo emergency private call while the
private call is already in progress.

1\. Both members of the private call belong to the same MCVideo system.
2\. A private call is already in progress.
Figure 7.2.2.4.2-1: MCVideo private call upgrade
1\. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates an emergency. MCVideo
client 1 sets its MCVideo emergency state. MCVideo client 1 retains the
MCVideo emergency state until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCVideo
client 1.
NOTE 1: While MCVideo client 1 is in the emergency state, all MCVideo group
and private calls initiated by MCVideo client 1 are initiated as MCVideo
emergency calls.
2\. MCVideo client 1 requests the MCVideo server to upgrade the private call
to in-progress emergency by sending an MCVideo emergency private call request.
If configured to send an MCVideo alert when initiating an MCVideo emergency
upgrade, the request also contains an indication that an MCVideo alert is to
be initiated. The request may contain an indication of an implicit transmit
media request.
3\. MCVideo server sends the MCVideo emergency request towards MCVideo client
2, the MCVideo client of the other participant.
4\. The MCVideo user of MCVideo client 2 is notified of the in-progress
emergency of the MCVideo emergency private call.
NOTE 2: MCVideo client 2 does not set its emergency state as a result of
receiving the MCVideo emergency private call upgrade.
5\. The receiving MCVideo client acknowledges the MCVideo emergency request to
the MCVideo server.
6\. The MCVideo server adjusts the priority of the underlying bearer for both
participants in the private call. The priority is retained until the call
ends.
7\. The MCVideo server confirms the upgrade request to MCVideo client 1. If
the MCVideo emergency request contained an implicit transmit media request,
the MCVideo emergency private call response message contains the result of the
implicit transmit media request.
8\. MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 continue with the private call,
which has been transformed into an MCVideo emergency private call. MCVideo
client 1 can override MCVideo client 2 unless MCVideo client 2 is also in the
MCVideo emergency state.

## 7.6 Ambient viewing call
### 7.6.1 General
The ambient viewing call is a type of a private MCVideo call that only allows
a \"viewed to\" user to transmit media to a \"viewing\" user such that there
is no indication on the MCVideo UE of the \"viewed to\" user about the call
and the media transmission.
NOTE 1: \"viewed to\" user refers to the user who is transmitting media in an
ambient viewing call.
NOTE 2: \"viewing\" user refers to the user who is receiving media in an
ambient viewing call.
There are two types of ambient viewing call as below:
\- Remotely initiated ambient viewing is initiated by the authorized user
(e.g., dispatcher) who wants to view to another user. In this case, the
\"viewed to\" user is the called party, and shall automatically accept the
call without causing any indication about the call and transmit the media to
the \"viewing\" user.
\- Locally initiated ambient viewing is initiated by an authorized user who
wants another user to view to the MCVideo UE communication. In this case, the
\"viewed to\" user is the calling party and shall automatically transmit the
media to the \"viewing\" user without causing any indication about the call
processing and media transmission.

## 7.7 Transmission control
### 7.7.1 Transmission control for on-network MCVideo service
#### 7.7.1.1 General
The procedure is for providing a transmission control to MCVideo UE in an on-
network case and applies for both private call and group call. Transmission
control is performed by using transmission control information flows between
the transmission control participant and the transmission control server.
#### 7.7.1.2 Information flows for transmission control for on-network
##### 7.7.1.2.1 General
When the transmission control server receives a transmit media request from
the transmission control participant, it decides whether to give a grant or
not. The result is informed to the requesting transmission control
participant. When the transmission control participant receives a transmit
media granted message, it can send video media over the uplink bearer
established beforehand. The transmit media revoked message can be used as part
of revoke. The transmit media queue status request can be used to know current
position in the queue for media transmission.
Some transmission control information flows can also piggyback call control
information flows to provide efficient call setup and clearing:
\- Call setup request is optionally carried in transmit media request
(uplink); and
\- Call release request is optionally carried in media transmission release
(uplink).

request(s) of other participant(s), the target participant(s)\' MCVideo ID
should be included in this message.
3\. The transmission control server shall check whether the requesting
transmission control participant has authorization to cancel the transmit
media request(s). If authorized, the transmit media request(s) will be removed
from the video transmission queue. When the on-going transmissions are
completed and are within the limit of the maximum simultaneous transmissions,
the transmission control server will process the transmit media request from
the updated video transmission queue.
4\. If the transmit media cancel request in step 3 is sent by an authorized
user (e.g., dispatcher) to cancel the transmit media request(s) of other
participant(s) from the video transmission queue, the transmit media cancel

### 7.7.2 Off-network transmission control
#### 7.7.2.1 General
The procedure is for providing transmission control to MCVideo UE in an off-
network case. Transmission control is performed by using transmission control
information flows between the transmission control participant and the
transmission control arbitrator. The transmission control arbitrator is a
member MCVideo UE of the MCVideo group where the transmission rules are
applied.
Off-network transmission control is based on ProSe capabilities as described
in clause 7.18.
Transmission control in off-network can be performed in two ways:
\- Single arbitrator: transmission participants rely on a single participant
designated as transmission arbitrator for the arbitraton of transmission
requests.
\- Self arbitration: each transmsission participant arbitrates its own
transmission based on its view of the topology.
Both of the approaches, as appropriate for the deployment model, can be
adopted for MCVideo group using a configurable parameter (as defined in Annex
A.4).
In the single arbitrator approach, one MCVideo client assumes the
responsibility for arbitration of transmission requests for all group members
within range. All requests for transmission are directed to the arbitrator,
and the arbitrator checks the configured limits on the simultaneous
transmissions, and grants or denies the request. If an MCVideo client is out
of range of the current arbitrator, the MCVideo client is allowed to transmit
and also become a transmission arbitrator. If there is insufficient capacity
to carry an extra transmission i.e. the configured limit for simultaneous
transmissions is reached, the MCVideo client may request that an existing
transmitting MCVideo client is pre-empted; the pre-emption request is sent to
the transmission arbitrator.
In the self arbitration approach, each MCVideo client decides for itself
whether there is sufficient capacity to carry the transmission. If it
determines that there is insufficient capacity i.e. the configured limit for
simultaneous transmissions is reached, and from its perspective another
transmitting MCVideo client has a lower priority, the requesting MCVideo
client may send an override request directly to this other transmitting
MCVideo client, which will either accept the override request and give way, or
deny the override request.
In both the single arbitrator approach and the self arbitration approach, if
there is insufficient capacity to carry the communication i.e. the configured
limit on the simultaneous transmissions is reached, the MCVideo client may
report this to the MCVideo user. The MCVideo user may decide to transmit
anyway, and instruct the MCVideo client to proceed with the transmission.
NOTE: The ProSe function within the MCVideo client could determine that there
is insufficient capacity to carry an MCVideo call requested by the MCVideo
client, however interactions between the MCVideo client and the ProSe function
are outside the scope of the present document.
Further subclauses apply to one or both of the single arbitrator approach and
the self arbitration approach. Applicability is explicitly indicated in each

#### 7.7.2.3 Initializing transmission control -- single arbitrator approach
This subclause is applicable only in single arbitrator approach.
Figure 7.7.2.3-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an
MCVideo client initializes transmission control. The MCVideo client sends a
transmission request to detect presence of a transmission arbitrator. If the
MCVideo client does not receive a response to the transmission request, it
sends a transmission arbitration taken message and becomes the transmission
arbitrator. The MCVideo client may now transmit a video. This procedure
applies when either there have been no recent MCVideo transmissions within the
MCVideo group and therefore no arbitrator has been selected, or where there
have been recent MCVideo transmissions which may still be ongoing, but the
arbitrator cannot be reached, e.g. where MCVideo client that wants to transmit
video has gone out of range of the arbitrator.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group communication has been established.
2\. MCVideo client 1 wishes to transmit video, and has determined that the
pre-configured limit on the number of transmissions within the MCVideo group
has not been reached.
Figure 7.7.2.3-1: Initializing transmission control, single arbitrator case

#### 7.7.2.3A Initializing transmission control -- self arbitration approach
This subclause is applicable only in self arbitration approach.
Figure 7.7.2.3a-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an
MCVideo client initializes transmission control.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group communication has been established.
2\. MCVideo client 1 wishes to transmit video.
Figure 7.7.2.3a-1: Initializing transmission control, self arbitration case
1\. The MCVideo client checks whether the pre-configured limit on the number
of transmissions within the MCVideo group has been reached and informs the
user. If the pre-configured limit on the number of transmissions within the
MCVideo group has been reached, the MCVideo user may defer the transmission,
or request an override as specified in subclause 7.7.2.8, or decide to
continue with the transmission anyway.
NOTE: If the MCVideo user decides to transmit even if the pre-configured limit
on the number of transmissions within the MCVideo group has been reached, the
MCVideo user decides to accept any consequences of interference.
2\. MCVideo client 1 sends a transmission arbitration taken message to the
MCVideo group.
3\. MCVideo client 1 transmits video to the MCVideo group.
#### 7.7.2.4 Transmission permission granted
This subclause is applicable only in single arbitrator approach.
Figure 7.7.2.4-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an
MCVideo client requests for transmission permission.
The MCVideo client has detected presence of a transmission arbitrator e.g., by
receiving responses to transmission arbitration control message. The MCVideo
client sends a transmission request and waits for a response. The MCVideo
client upon receiving a transmission granted message may transmit a video.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group communication has been established.
2\. At least one participant is currently transmitting video.

1\. MCVideo client 2 sends a transmission request message to the MCVideo
group.
2\. MCVideo client 1, being the transmission arbitrator, checks if the
configured limit of maximum simultaneous transmissions is already reached.
3\. If the maximum simultaneous transmissions limit is not reached, MCVideo
client 1 sends a transmission granted message to the MCVideo group.
Transmission granted message indicates MCVideo client 2 as the intended
recipient.
4\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 may be notified that the video can now be
transmitted.
5\. MCVideo client 2 transmits video to the MCVideo group.
#### 7.7.2.5 Transmission permission rejected
This subclause is applicable only in single arbitrator approach.
Figure 7.7.2.5-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an
MCVideo client requests for transmission permission.
The MCVideo client has detected presence of a transmission arbitrator e.g., by
receiving responses to transmission arbitration control message. The MCVideo
client sends a transmission request and waits for a response.

2\. At least one participant is currently transmitting video.
Figure 7.7.2.5-1: Requesting transmission permission
1\. MCVideo client 2 sends a transmission request message to the MCVideo
group.
2\. MCVideo client 1, being the transmission arbitrator, checks if the
configured limit of maximum simultaneous transmissions is already reached.
3\. If the maximum simultaneous transmissions limit has reached, MCVideo
client 1 sends a transmission rejected message to the MCVideo group.
Transmission denied message indicates MCVideo client 2 as the intended
recipient. The transmission rejected message may include a rejection cause
which indicates that the configured maximum transmissions limit has been
reached.
4\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 may be notified that the video cannot be
transmitted right now.
Following step 4, the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 may decide to transmit
anyway, for example if the user knows the topology of the off-network MCVideo
group and locations of the MCVideo group members and needs to transmit video
to other local MCVideo group members despite causing a potential conflict with
one or more other existing MCVideo transmissions within the MCVideo group. In
this case, the MCVideo client follows the procedure in subclause 7.7.2.3.
#### 7.7.2.6 Releasing transmission permission
This subclause is applicable in both the single arbitrator and self
arbitration approaches.
Figure 7.7.2.6-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an
MCVideo client releases transmission permission.
The MCVideo client has detected presence of a transmission arbitrator e.g., by
receiving responses to transmission arbitration control message. The MCVideo
client stops the video transmission and sends a transmission release request.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An off-network group communication has been established.

reached, MCVideo client 1, being the transmission arbitrator, checks the
override policy.
3\. If MCVideo client 2 is authorized to override (based on e.g., transmission
priority), MCVideo client 1 sends a transmission revoked message to the
MCVideo group. Transmission revoked message indicates the MCVideo client from
which the permission is revoked, as the intended recipient.
4\. MCVideo client 3 stops transmission of video and MCVideo user at MCVideo
client 3 may be notified that the transmission permission has been revoked.
5\. MCVideo client 1 sends a transmission granted message to the MCVideo
group. Transmission granted message indicates MCVideo client 2 as the intended
recipient.
6\. MCVideo user at MCVideo client 2 may be notified that the video can now be
transmitted.
7\. MCVideo client 2 transmits video to the MCVideo group.
#### 7.7.2.8 Transmission override (revoke self)
This subclause is applicable in the single arbitrator approach.
Editor\'s note: transmission override in the self arbitration approach is FFS.
Figure 7.7.2.8-1 describes procedures for transmission participants when an
MCVideo client authorized to override, requests for transmission permission.
The MCVideo client has detected presence of a transmission arbitrator e.g., by
receiving responses to transmission arbitration control message. The MCVideo
client sends a transmission request and waits for a response.
Pre-conditions:

clarifications:
\- The MC service client is the MCVideo client;
\- The MC service server is the MCVideo server;
\- The MC service group is the MCVideo group;
\- The MC service ID is the MCVideo ID; and
\- The MC service group ID is the MCVideo group ID.
When an MCVideo user has affiliated to an MCVideo group then the MCVideo user
can send and receive MCVideo related media for that MCVideo group. When an
MCVideo user has de‑affiliated from an MCVideo group then the MCVideo user
cannot send and receive MCVideo related media to and from that MCVideo group.
## 7.9a Functional alias management
The MCVideo service shall support the functional alias activation, de-
activation, taken over, subscription and notification and functional alias to
group binding procedures and related information flows as specified in
subclause 10.13 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].

## 7.10 Use of MBMS transmission (on-network)
### 7.10.1 Information flows for MBMS Transmission
#### 7.10.1.1 General
Information flows for generic MBMS procedures are defined in 3GPP TS 23.280
[6].
#### 7.10.1.2 MapGroupToBearer
Table 7.10.1.2-1 describes the information flow to associate a MCVideo group
call to a MBMS bearer. It is sent from the MCVideo server to the MCVideo
client.
Table 7.10.1.2-1: MapGroupToBearer
Information element Status Description
* * *
MCVideo group ID M This element identifies the MCVideo group, in which the
call is started. Media stream identifier (video) M This element identifies the
media stream of the SDP used for the Video group call (e.g. MBMS subchannel).
Media stream identifier (audio) O This element identifies the audio media
stream of the SDP used for the Video group call (e.g. MBMS subchannel). This
is used if separate codecs are used for video and audio. TMGI (see NOTE) O The
MBMS bearer identifier if the media of the MCVideo group call is not sent on
the same MBMS bearer as this MapGroupToBearer message. Call acknowledgement
indicator O Indication that the MCVideo group call requires acknowledgement
from receiving MCVideo clients. NOTE: TMGI shall be present if this message is
sent over a different MBMS bearer than the media of the group call; TMGI may
be present if this message is sent over the same MBMS bearer as the media of
the group call.
#### 7.10.1.3 UnmapGroupFromBearer
Table 7.10.1.3-1 describes the information flow to disconnect a MCVideo group
call from a MBMS bearer. It is sent from the MCVideo server to the MCVideo
client.
Table 7.10.1.3-1: UnmapGroupFromBearer
Information element Status Description
* * *
MCVideo group ID M This element identifies the MCVideo group which will no
longer use the MBMS bearer.
### 7.10.2 Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
The MCVideo service shall support the procedure for using pre-established MBMS
bearers as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [6] with the following clarifications:
\- The MC service client is the MCVideo client;
\- The MC service server is the MCVideo server; and
\- The MC service ID is the MCVideo ID.
The MCVideo service shall use the MCVideo-1, MCVideo‑8 and MCVideo-9 reference
points for this procedure.
MCVideo may use pre-established MBMS bearer for the different types of MCVideo
group calls. Both pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls can use the
pre-established MBMS bearer for distributing the media. The MBMS bearer can be
used by any group. Depending on the capacity of the MBMS bearer, the bearer
can be used to broadcast one or more group calls in parallel.
Both the media packets as well as the transmission control messages to the
receiving MCVideo clients are sent on the MBMS bearer. Optionally a separate
MBMS bearer could be used for the transmission control messages, due to
different bearer characteristic requirements.
When using the pre-established MBMS bearer for MCVideo, the MCVideo server
perform the procedure of call connect and disconnect over MBMS as defined in
subclause 7.10.4 at the group communication session establishment step.
### 7.10.3 Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
The MCVideo service shall support the procedure for using dynamic MBMS bearers
as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [6] with the following clarifications:
\- The MC service client is the MCVideo client;
\- The MC service server is the MCVideo server; and
\- The MC service ID is the MCVideo ID.
The MCVideo service shall use the MCVideo-1, MCVideo-4, MCVideo-7, MCVideo-8
and MCVideo-9 reference points for this procedure.
MCVideo may use dynamic MBMS bearer establishment for the different types of
MCVideo group calls. Both pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls can
use the dynamic MBMS bearer for distributing the media.
Both the media packets as well as the transmission control messages to the
receiving MCVideo clients are sent on the MBMS bearer.
When using the procedures for dynamic MBMS bearer establishment for MCVideo,
the MCVideo server perform the procedure of mapping group communication to
MBMS bearer as defined in subclause 7.10.4 at the group communication session
establishment step.
### 7.10.4 Video call connect and disconnect over MBMS
#### 7.10.4.1 General
MBMS bearer can be used for MCVideo group calls. One MBMS bearer is not
permanently associated to one specific group or group call. Before sending
media packets of a group call over MBMS bearer, the MCVideo server shall send
the association information between group call and the MBMS bearer. The group
call setup procedure indicates the media stream or media streams within one
MBMS bearer that is used for the specific MCVideo group call. When the group
call over the MBMS bearer is finished, this temporary association information
of an MCVideo group call to specific resources on a MBMS bearer is undone. The
procedure in figure 7.10.4.2.1-1 requires that the group session is setup
before the call start. This eliminates the need for the receiving clients to
continuously use a unicast bearer. Prior to this the MBMS bearer is activated
and announced to the MCVideo clients.
#### 7.10.4.2 Procedure
##### 7.10.4.2.1 Call connect over MBMS
In figure 7.10.4.2.1-1 the MCVideo client 1 is the client that initiate an
MCVideo chat group call and also the transmitting client. MCVideo client 1
may, but does not have to be in an MBMS service area. The MCVideo client 2 and
MCVideo client 3 represents MCVideo clients receiving the MCVideo call over an
MBMS bearer. There may be other receiving clients both over unicast bearers
and over this or other MBMS bearer(s), however they are not illustrated in
this figure.
The same procedure as for chat group call can also be applied for pre-arranged
calls.
Pre-conditions:
\- All users participating in the MCVideo group call are already affiliated to
the group.
\- All participating users have joined the group session.
Figure 7.10.4.2.1-1: Chat group call connect on MBMS bearer
1\. Activation and announcement of MBMS bearer availability.
NOTE 1: The procedure does not include the steps for MCVideo client location
reporting, or for MBMS capability information exchange.
2\. MCVideo client 1 initiate the MCVideo group call by sending an initial
transmit media request over a unicast bearer to the MCVideo server (reference
point MCVideo-4).
3\. The MCVideo server will send a MapGroupToBearer message over a previously
activated MBMS bearer to all users that will receive the call over an MBMS
bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes association information between
the group call and MBMS bearer. The MapGroupToBearer message includes MCVideo
group ID and information about the media stream identifier or media stream
identifiers of the activated MBMS bearer and may include the identifier (i.e.
the TMGI) of the MBMS bearer broadcasting the call. The message is sent over
reference point MCVideo-9.
NOTE 2: Step 3 can be deferred until step 5 and the MapGroupToBearer message
can then be included in the transmission arbitration taken message.
4\. The MCVideo server grants the right to transmit for MCVideo client 1 and
by that sends a transmit media granted message to the MCVideo client 1\. This
message is sent over a unicast bearer (reference point MCVideo-4).
5\. A media transmission notification message is sent from the MCVideo server
to all receiving users. This message includes the MCVideo ID of the
transmitting MCVideo client as well as the MCVideo group ID. The message is
sent over a MBMS bearer to all users that have previously been setup to
receive calls over the MBMS bearer. The message is sent over reference point
MCVideo-9.
6\. The users of MCVideo clients are informed about the details of video
tranmission and the video transmitter.
7\. The MCVideo clients may send a receive media request to the MCVideo
server, to indicate the reception of media over the MBMS bearer.
8\. MCVideo server accepts the media receive request and sends a receive media
response message to MCVideo clients over a MBMS bearer by using reference
point MCVideo-9.
NOTE 3: The receive media response can also be sent by unicast to the MCVideo
clients that request to receive media over the MBMS bearer.
NOTE 4: Step 7 and 8 may be omitted when auto-receive (i.e. forced reception
mode) transmission mode is used based on configurations (e.g. for emergency
group calls, imminent peril calls etc) as described in Annex A.
9\. The media is sent from MCVideo client 1 to the MCVideo server over unicast
bearer and from the MCVideo server to the MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client
3 over MBMS bearer.
NOTE 5: Additional transmission request messages in the same call will not
trigger the MapGroupToBearer message to be sent.
##### 7.10.4.2.2 Call disconnect over MBMS
Figure 7.10.4.2.2-1 shows the high level procedure where an
UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCVideo server to the MCVideo
clients to indicate that the MCVideo group call is being dissociated from the
MBMS bearer.
Figure 7.10.4.2.2-1: Chat group call disconnect on MBMS bearer
1\. An MCVideo group call is ongoing; the media is broadcasted over MBMS
bearer to MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3.
2\. MCVideo server has determined to disconnect the call over the MBMS bearer
for the MCVideo clients
3\. An UnmapGroupFromBearer message is sent by the MCVideo server to MCVideo
client 2, MCVideo client 3 and possibly to MCVideo client 1 (if in MBMS
coverage area) on MBMS bearer(s).
NOTE 1: The UnmapGroupFromBearer message can be sent as part of other
messages.
NOTE 2: The UnmapGroupFromBearer message and the MapGroupToBearer message can
be combined, to facilitate switching bearers in one signalling step, as
necessary.
### 7.10.5 Switching from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer
The MCVideo service shall support the procedure for switching from MBMS bearer
to unicast bearer as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [6] with the following
clarifications:
\- The MC service client is the MCVideo client;
\- The MC service server is the MCVideo server; and
\- The MC service ID is the MCVideo ID.
The MCVideo service shall use the MCVideo-1, MCVideo-4, MCVideo‑7, MCVideo-8
and MCVideo‑9 reference points for this procedure.
## 7.11 Simultaneous session for MCVideo calls (on-network)
An MCVideo client and MCVideo server may use a simultaneous session as defined
in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6] for MCVideo calls. The MCVideo client becomes involved
in a simultaneous session for MCVideo calls by inviting, joining or accepting
more than one MCVideo call, or affiliating to a group.
NOTE: An MCVideo client affiliating to multiple MCVideo groups with active
calls will result in the MCVideo client being invited simultaneously to
multiple MCVideo calls.
The MCVideo client can also still handle multiple MCVideo calls in parallel at
the same time i.e. using multiple dialogs.
The simultaneous session is established during either an originating on-demand
call establishment or during pre-established session establishment or a
modification of an already established pre-established session or on-demand
call.
It is possible to change the prioritisation while the MCVideo client is
engaged in multiple MCVideo calls. The setting of the priority can be made at
MCVideo call setup or by performing a modification after the MCVideo call is
established. This may result in more than one media bearer.
## 7.12 User authentication and authorization for MCVideo service
NOTE: Flow 7.12-1 is a high level user authentication and authorization flow.
3GPP TS 33.180 [14] defines the specific user authentication and authorization
architecture required by the MCVideo service in order to realize the MCVideo
user authentication and authorization requirements as defined in 3GPP TS
22.280 [2].
A procedure for user authentication is illustrated in figure 7.12-1. The user
authentication is performed based on the procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280
[6].
Figure 7.12-1: MCVideo user authentication and registration, single domain
1\. The user authentication is performed as per the general user
authentication procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
2\. MCVideo client performs the MCVideo service authorization for the user.
Step 2 utilizes the results of step 1.
## 7.13 Support for multiple devices
An MCVideo user may be authorized to use the MCVideo service from multiple
MCVideo UEs as per the procedure in subclause 7.12.
If an MCVideo server receives a service authorization request for an MCVideo
user who is previously MCVideo service authorized on another MCVideo UE, then
the MCVideo server shall process this service authorization request as
described in subclause 7.12. In the MCVideo service authorization response to
the MCVideo user, the MCVideo server shall also indicate that the MCVideo user
is already MCVideo service authorized from another MCVideo UE.
## 7.14 Location information (on-network)
The MCVideo system makes use of all of the procedures for location management
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6], utilising the CSC-14 reference point
between the location management client and location management server and the
CSC‑15 reference point between the MCVideo server and location management
server.
\- The MC service client is the MCVideo client;
\- The MC service server is the MCVideo server;
\- The MC service group is the MCVideo group;
\- The MC service ID is the MCVideo ID; and
\- The MC service group ID is the MCVideo group ID.
## 7.15 MCVideo resource management (on-network)
Procedures for resource management are defined in subclause 10.11 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [6].

## 7.18 Use of ProSe capabilities in off-network MCVideo communications
### 7.18.1 General
When an MCVideo user using a ProSe-enabled UE wants to communicate with a
specific MCVideo group or MCVideo user using ProSe capabilities, the MCVideo
client enables the use of the ProSe layer procedures for public safety, as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].
For an off-network MCVideo group communication, the MCVideo client obtains
configuration data such as the user info ID of the calling MCVideo user and
the ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID associated to
the target MCVideo group (as described in clause 8.1.3.2 in 3GPP TS 23.280
[6]), and provides it to the ProSe layer. The ProSe Layer-2 Group ID of the
target MCVideo group may be used by the ProSe layer as the target group info
and the discovery group ID (defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]).
Prior to initiating an off-network MCVideo group communication, a group member
discovery procedure may be initiated to identify whether other members of the
target MCVideo group are in the proximity of the calling MCVideo user, as
described in the ProSe direct discovery for public safety use procedure in
3GPP TS 23.303 [7]. The off-network MCVideo group communication using the
ProSe capability is based on the one-to-many ProSe direct communication
procedure for public safety use described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].
For an off-network one-to-one MCVideo communication, the MCVideo client
obtains configuration data such as the ProSe discovery group ID and user info
ID of the target MCVideo user from the \"List of user(s) who can be called in
MCVideo private call\" in the MCVideo user profile and requests the IP address
of the MCVideo UE associated with the target MCVideo user from the ProSe
layer.
The MCVideo client enables the ProSe layer to determine the IP address for the
communication with the target MCVideo UE by providing the ProSe discovery
group ID and user info ID (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) associated to the
target MCVideo user. This may trigger the ProSe direct discovery for public
safety use procedure to identify whether the target MCVideo user is in the
proximity of the calling MCVideo user. The user info ID of the target MCVideo
user is used by the ProSe layer as the target info (as defined in 3GPP TS
23.303 [7]).
The ProSe layer can then provide the IP address related to the target MCVideo
user to the MCVideo client to initiate the off-network one-to-one MCVideo
communication based on the one-to-one ProSe direct communication procedure
described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7].
### 7.18.2 Procedures
The off-network MCVideo communication procedures using the ProSe capabilities
are described within the corresponding clauses of each MCVideo capability,
e.g. group communication procedures for off-network are described in clause
7.1.3 and private communication procedures for off-network are described in
clause 7.2.3.
## 7.19 Ad hoc group call
### 7.19.1 General
This subclause contains procedures for ad hoc group call across one or more
MCVideo systems, and associated functions such as emergency call, Imminent
peril call, broadcast call and others.
The ad hoc group calls can use the participants list provided by either an
initiator of the call or MCVideo server. The MCVideo server can use the
criteria provided by the initiator of the call to determine the participants
list along with its own criteria or local policies. The resulting ad hoc group
uses the configuration of a separate preconfigured MCVideo group.
NOTE 1: A preconfigured group which is intended only to provide configuration
for the ad hoc group is identified by a parameter in the group configuration
described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
The preconfigured MCVideo group that provides the configuration is not used
for the MCVideo group communication, it only provides configuration for one or
more adhoc group calls. The MCVideo group ID of the ad hoc group call is
provided by the MCVideo server when the ad hoc group call is originated. In
order to establish security context for the end-to-end secured ad hoc group
call, the security related information is used from this preconfigured group.
NOTE 2: The configurations defined for the adhoc group call in user profile
and service configuration document as described in the Annex A.3 and A.5 is
applicable only for single MCVideo system.

### 7.19.3 Procedures
#### 7.19.3.1 Ad hoc group call procedures in single MCVideo system
##### 7.19.3.1.1 Ad hoc group call setup
Figure 7.19.3.1.1-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group call setup procedure
initiated by an authorized user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The authorized user at MCVideo client 1 wants to invite MCVideo users at
MCVideo client 2, MCVideo client 3 and MCVideo client 4 for the ad hoc group
call and is aware of the MCVideo IDs of the participants or to invite the ad
hoc group member if the ad hoc group call follows an ad hoc group emergency
alert, the MCVideo client 1 is aware of the ad hoc group ID.
2\. Number of participants being invited for the ad hoc group call is within
the limit.
3\. End-to-End encryption is supported for this ad hoc group call.
4\. The pre-configured group identity and pre-configured group configuration
to be used for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in MCVideo client and
other participants of ad hoc group have also received the relevant security
related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group
communication.
NOTE 1: Selection of MCVideo IDs of the participants can be manual or from the
user profile configuration data or by any other means. This is left for the
implementation.
Figure 7.19.3.1.1-1: Ad hoc group call setup
1\. User at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group call. The
MCVideo client 1 initiates the ad hoc group call by sending the ad hoc group
call request containing the list of participants or an ad hoc group ID from an
ad hoc group emergency alert to the MCVideo server. Encryption supported
information element shall be set to true since end-to-end encryption is
supported. An SDP offer containing the MCVideo client media parameters is
included. If there is a transmit media request to transmit media, then the ad
hoc group call request contains an indication of an implicit transmit media
request. If the MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1 has selected a functional
alias, then the ad hoc group call request contains that functional alias. If
the ad hoc group call request contains an implicit transmit media request it
may also include location information.
If the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo emergency ad hoc
group call or the MCVideo emergency state is already set for the MCVideo
client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCVideo emergency alert):
i. the MCVideo ad hoc group call request shall contain an emergency indicator;
ii. if the MCVideo emergency state is not set already, MCVideo client 1 sets
its MCVideo emergency state. The MCVideo emergency state of MCVideo client 1
is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCVideo client 1.
2\. The MCVideo server accepts the ad hoc group call request if the ad hoc
group call is supported and authorized. Otherwise reject the ad hoc group call
request and do not continue with the rest of the steps. If authorised, it
validates whether the number of invited participants is within the configured
limit before proceeding with the call setup.
If functional alias is present, the MCVideo server checks whether the provided
functional alias allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
If location information was included in the ad hoc group call request, the
MCVideo server checks the privacy policy of the MCVideo user to decide if the
location information of MCVideo client 1 can be provided to other users on the
call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to
other MCVideo users on a call when talking\").
If an emergency indicator is present in the received MCVideo ad hoc group call
request, the MCVideo ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress
emergency state until this ad hoc group call is terminated; and
If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCVideo ad hoc group
call request, the MCVideo ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress
imminent peril state until this ad hoc group call is terminated.
If the the MC service users\' information received in step 1 does not contain
an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCVideo server
forms the ad hoc group by using MCVideo users\' information received in step
1, determines the preconfigured group to be used for the configuration of the
ad hoc group and assigns a MCVideo group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group.
The MCVideo server considers the ad hoc group call participants as implicitly
affiliated to the ad hoc group.
3\. The MCVideo server shall send the ad hoc group call request return message
to MCVideo client 1 containing the below:
i. The MCVideo ad hoc group ID either generated by the MCVideo server or
provided by the MCVideo client 1 if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc
group emergency alert (only included when the ad hoc group call is
authorized);
ii. The group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group
call (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized); and
iii. Result of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not.
If the ad hoc group call request is not authorized, MCVideo client 1 shall not
proceed with the rest of the steps.
4a-4c. The MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call requests towards the
MCVideo clients of the invited users based on step 1. While sending the ad hoc
group call requests, the MCVideo server shall remove the information elements
that are not required to be conveyed to the target MCVideo clients (e.g.
MCVideo ID list of the users who are required to acknowledge)
5a-5c. The receiving MCVideo clients are notified about the incoming ad hoc
group call.
6a-6c. The receiving MCVideo clients accept the ad hoc group call requests and
send ad hoc group call responses to the MCVideo server. The response may also
contain a functional alias of the responding MCVideo user, which is verified
(valid and activated for the user) by the MCVideo server.
7\. The MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call response to MCVideo client
1 through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment.
NOTE 2: Steps 5 to step 7 can start to occur before all of step 4 is completed
since the MCVideo server do not require to wait for the previous ad hoc group
call request to complete before sending the ad hoc group request to another
participant.
8\. If the initiating MCVideo user requires the acknowledgement from the
invited MCVideo users, and the required MCVideo users do not acknowledge the
call setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged call setup timeout\"),
then the MCVideo server may proceed with or abandon the call and then notify
the initiating MCVideo user that the acknowledgements did not include all
required members according to ad hoc group call policy from the user profile
configuration. The MCVideo server may notify the initiating MCVideo user of
all MCVideo users who did not acknowledge the ad hoc group call request within
the configured time. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCVideo
user by the MCVideo server more than once during the call when MCVideo users
join or leave the MCVideo ad hoc group call.
9\. MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2, MCVideo client 3 and MCVideo client 4
establish media plane and transmission control resources.
NOTE 2: Step 9 can occur any time following step 7 if the conditions to
proceed with the call are met.
##### 7.19.3.1.2 Release ad hoc group call
The procedure focuses on the case where the MCVideo server releases an ongoing
MCVideo ad hoc group call for all the participants of that ad hoc group call,
since at least one of the release conditions are met e.g., due to hang time
expiry, last participant leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator
leaving.
Figure 7.19.3.1.2-1 below illustrates the signalling control plane procedure
for the MCVideo server initiating termination an ongoing ad hoc group call.
Figure 7.19.3.1.2-1: Release ad hoc group call
1\. It is assumed that MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client
3 are already part of the ongoing ad hoc group call.
2\. MCVideo server would like to release the MCVideo ad hoc group call which
is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second
last participant leaving, initiator leaving.
3\. MCVideo server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc group
call and generates ad hoc group call release request to release ongoing
session. The MCVideo server cancels the in-progress emergency state or in-
progress imminent peril state of the ad hoc group if the ad hoc group call is
an emergency or imminent peril call respectively.
4\. MCVideo server sends ad hoc group call release request via SIP core
towards each participant of the ongoing ad hoc group call.
5\. MCVideo users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group call.
6\. MCVideo client(s) receiving ad hoc group call release request, acknowledge
towards the MCVideo server by sending an ad hoc group call release response.
NOTE: If the initiator of the ad hoc group call does not supply the
participants list, the MCVideo client(s) may choose to store the list of
participants for easy re-initiation of another ad hoc group call with the same
participants.
7\. MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the
transmission control and media plane resources associated with the ad hoc
group call that is terminated and the ad hoc group ceases to exist (i.e.,
further call is not possible over the same ad hoc group, otherwise if the ad
hoc group call follows an ad hoc group emergency alert the ad hoc group
continues to exist (i.e., further calls over the same ad hoc group are
possible).
##### 7.19.3.1.3 Ad hoc group call setup with MCVideo server determining the
participants lists
Figure 7.19.3.1.3-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group call setup procedure
initiated by the MCVideo user and MCVideo client 1 wherein the list of
participants is determined by the MCVideo server based on the citeria received
from the MCVideo client.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 is authorized to initate ad hoc group
call.
2\. The MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 wants to invite MCVideo users who are
satisying certain criteria for the ad hoc group call.
Figure 7.19.3.1.3-1: Ad hoc group call participants determined by MCVideo
server
1\. User at MCVideo client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group call in-
order to invite the participants satisfying specific criteria. The MCVideo
client 1 initiates the ad hoc group call by sending the ad hoc group call
request containing the details of the criteria to be applied by the MCVideo
server for determining the participants list. If end-to-end encryption is
supported, the Encryption supported information element shall be set to true
and pre-configured MCVideo group whose configuration is to be applied is
included. An SDP offer containing the MCVideo client media parameters is
included. If there is a transmission request to transmit, then the ad hoc
group call request contains an indication of an implicit transmit media
request. If the MCVideo user of MCVideo client 1 has selected a functional
alias, then the ad hoc group call request contains that functional alias. If
the ad hoc group call request contains an implicit transmit media request it
may also include location information.
If the MCVideo user at MCVideo client 1 initiates an MCVideo emergency ad hoc
group call or the MCVideo emergency state is already set for the MCVideo
client 1 (due to a previously triggered MCVideo emergency alert):
i. the MCVideo ad hoc group call request shall contain an emergency indicator;
ii. if the MCVideo emergency state is not set already, MCVideo client 1 sets
its MCVideo emergency state. The MCVideo emergency state of MCVideo client 1
is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MCVideo client 1.
2\. The MCVideo server accepts the ad hoc group call request if the ad hoc
group call is supported and authorized. Otherwise reject the ad hoc group call
request and do not continue with the rest of the steps.
If functional alias is present, the MCVideo server checks whether the provided
functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the user.
If location information was included in the ad hoc group call request, the
MCVideo server checks the privacy policy of the MCVideo user to decide if the
location information of MCVideo client 1 can be provided to other users on the
call (refer to Annex A.3 \"Authorisation to provide location information to
other MCVideo users on a call when talking\").
If an emergency indicator is present in the received MCVideo ad hoc group call
request, the MCVideo ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress
emergency state until this ad hoc group call is terminated; and
If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MCVideo ad hoc group
call request, the MCVideo ad hoc group is considered to be in the in-progress
imminent peril state until this ad hoc group call is terminated.
If the information received in the request in step 1 does not contain an ad
hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCVideo server forms
the ad hoc group by using received information, and determines the
preconfigured group to be used for the configuration of the ad hoc group. The
MCVideo server assigns a MCVideo group ID for the newly formed ad hoc group.
Further, the ad hoc group participants are included to ad hoc group once
determined as specified in the step 4.
3\. The MCVideo server shall send the ad hoc group call request return message
to MCVideo client 1 containing the below:
i. The MCVideo ad hoc group ID, either generated by the MCVideo server, if not
included in the ad hoc group call request of step 1, or if the provided
MCVideo ad hoc group ID is not accepted by the MCVideo server, or provided by
the MCVideo client 1 if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group emergency
alert;
ii. The group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group
communication (only included when the ad hoc group data session is
authorized); and
iii. Result of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not
If the ad hoc group call request is not authorized, MCVideo server and client
1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.
4\. The MCVideo server determines the list of participants to be invited for
the ad hoc group call based on the information present in the information
element Criteria for determining the participants. This information element
could carry either criteria or indicator identifying pre-defined criteria or a
combination of both.
NOTE 1: The content of the Criteria information element, the details of the
pre-defined criteria, and the way how their MCVideo server determines the list
of participants are left to implementation.
5\. The MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call requests towards the
MCVideo clients 2 and 3. While sending the ad hoc group call requests, the
MCVideo server shall remove the information elements that are not required to
be conveyed to the target MCVideo clients. This request carries the pre-
configured group ID whose configuration is to be applied for this ad hoc group
call if end-to-end encryption is requested. The MCVideo server considers the
ad hoc group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.
6\. The receiving MCVideo clients are notified about the incoming ad hoc group
call.
7\. The receiving MCVideo clients accept the ad hoc group call requests and
send ad hoc group call responses to the MCVideo server. The response may also
contain a functional alias of the responding MCVideo user, which is verified
(valid and activated for the user) by the MCVideo server.
8\. The MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call response to MCVideo client
1 through the signalling path to inform about successful call establishment.
9\. The MCVideo server may notify the initiating MCVideo user of all MCVideo
users who acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad hoc
group call. This notification may be sent to the initiating MCVideo user by
the MCVideo server more than once during the call when MCVideo users join or
leave the MCVideo ad hoc group call. If the authorized users (not shown in
figure) are configured to receive the participants information of ad hoc group
call, the MCVideo server provides ad hoc group call notify about all MCVideo
users who acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad hoc
group call, and when MCVideo users join or leave the MCVideo ad hoc group
call.
NOTE 2: The authorized user can learn who is currently affiliated to the
current adhoc group call.
Editor\'s note: How an authroized user determine the currently affiliated
status of adhoc group is FFS.
10\. MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client 3 establish media
plane and transmission control resources.
##### 7.19.3.1.4 Modification of ad hoc group call participants by the
initiator
Figure 7.19.3.1.4-1 below illustrates the modification of ad hoc group call
participants procedure by the initiator of the ad hoc group call.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MCVideo client 1 is the initiator of the ad hoc group call.
2\. The MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 3 to MCVideo client
n are on an ongoing ad hoc group call.
3\. The MCVideo user 1 requests to remove the user of MCVideo client 3 from
the ad hoc group call and add user of MCVideo client 2 into the on-going ad

Figure 7.19.3.1.4-1: Modification of ad hoc group call participants by the
initiator
1\. The MCVideo client 1 sends the modify ad hoc group call participants
request to the MCVideo server in order to remove MCVideo client 3 from the
ongoing ad hoc group call and add MCVideo client 2 into it.
2\. The MCVideo server verifies whether the MCVideo client 1 is authorized to
add or remove (modify) the participants of the on-going ad hoc group call.
3\. The MCVideo server sends modify ad hoc group call participants response to
the MCVideo client 1.
4\. The MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call leave request to the
MCVideo client 3 in order to remove it from the on-going ad hoc group call.
5\. The MCVideo client 3 notifies the user of the ad hoc group call leave
request.
6\. The MCVideo client 3 sends the ad hoc group call leave response to the
MCVideo server.
7\. The MCVideo server removes the MCVideo client 3 from the ongoing ad hoc
group call.
8\. The MCVideo server sends the ad hoc group call request towards MCVideo
client 2.
NOTE: Steps 8 to 10 can occur at any time following step 3.
9\. The receiving MCVideo client 2 notifies the user about the incoming ad hoc
group call.
10\. The MCVideo client 2 accepts the ad hoc group call request and send ad

#### 7.19.3.2 Ad hoc group call involving multiple MC systems
##### 7.19.3.2.1 Ad hoc group call setup -- Participants list determined by
the MCVideo server
Figure 7.19.3.2.1-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group call setup procedure
initiated by an authorized user wherein the list of participants is determined
by the MCVideo server based on the criteria received from the MCVideo client
and determined MCVideo users are from multiple MCVideo systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, it is considered that the partner MC system share
their users\' information to the primary MC system.
2\. The authorized MCVideo user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MC system.
3\. The MCVideo server 1 of the primary MC system is where the authorized
MCVideo user/dispatcher creates the ad hoc group.
4\. Some users of the ad hoc group belong to MCVideo server 2 of the partner
MC systems.
5\. The pre-configured group identity and pre-configured group configuration
to be used for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in MCVideo client and

related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group
communication.
Figure 7.19.3.2.1-1: Ad hoc group call setup involving multiple MCVideo
systems
1-3. Same as described in subclause 7.19.3.1.3.
4\. The MCVideo server 1 determines the list of participants from the primary
MC system and determines the partner MC system to be involved in the ad hoc
group call based on the information present in the information element
Criteria for determining the participants. This information element carries
the criteria, indicator identifying pre-defined criteria, or a combination of
both.
NOTE 1: The content of the Criteria information element, the details of the
pre-defined criteria, and the way how their MCVideo server determines the list
of participants are left to implementation.
5\. If the MCVideo server 1 needs to involve the partner system based on the
agreement and based on the criteria for determining the participants list, it
sends the ad hoc group call get userlist request to the MCVideo server 2. This
request carries the criteria specified in the step 1.
6\. MCVideo server 2 evaluates the criteria and determines the participants
satisfying the criteria (i.e. MCVideo client 3 and MCVideo client 4) and sends
the response containing the list of MCVideo users satisfying the criteria. The
partner MCVideo server may apply local policies if any while determining the
participants satisfying the criteria.
7\. The MCVideo server 1 compiles the list of participants to be invited for
the ad hoc group call including the participants from both primary and partner
MC system.
8a-8b. The MCVideo server 1 sends the ad hoc group call request towards the
MCVideo client 3 and MCVideo client 4. While sending the ad hoc group call
request, the MCVideo server shall remove the information elements that are not
required to be conveyed to the target MCVideo clients. This request carries
the pre-configured group ID whose configuration is to be applied for this ad
hoc group call if end-to-end encryption is requested. The MCVideo server 1
considers the ad hoc group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the
ad hoc group.
9\. The MCVideo server 1 sends the ad hoc group call requests towards the
MCVideo client 2. While sending the ad hoc group call request, the MCVideo
server shall remove the information elements that are not required to be
conveyed to the target MCVideo clients. This request carries the pre-
configured group ID whose configuration is to be applied for this ad hoc group
call if end-to-end encryption is requested. The MCVideo server 1 considers the
ad hoc group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.
10a-10c. The receiving MCVideo clients are notified about the incoming ad hoc
group call.
11\. The MCVideo client 2 accept the ad hoc group call request and send ad hoc
group call response to the MCVideo server 1.
12\. The MCVideo client 3 accepts the ad hoc group call request, and sends ad
hoc group call response to the MCVideo server 1.
13\. The MCVideo client 4 accepts the ad hoc group call request, and sends ad
hoc group call response to the MCVideo server 1.
14\. The MCVideo server 1 sends the ad hoc group call response to MCVideo
client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful call
establishment.
15\. The MCVideo server 1 may notify the initiating MCVideo user of all
MCVideo users who acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad
hoc group call. The MCVideo server 1 more than once during the call may send
this notification to the initiating MCVideo user whenever an MCVideo user
joins or leaves the MCVideo ad hoc group call. If the authorized users (not
shown in figure) are configured to receive the participants information of ad
hoc group call, the MCVideo server provides ad hoc group call notify about all
MCVideo users who acknowledged the ad hoc group call request and joined the ad
hoc group call, and when MCVideo users join or leave the MCVideo ad hoc group
call.
16\. The MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2, MCVideo client 3 and MCVideo
client 4 establish media plane and transmission control resources.
NOTE 2: The ad hoc group call request and response exchanged between MCVideo
server 1 of primary MC system and MCVideo client 3/MCVideo client 4 will
always traversal through the MCVideo server 2.

Figure 7.19.3.2.3-1: MCVideo server releases an ad hoc group call and stops
the determination of ad hoc group call participants involving multiple MCVideo
systems
1\. The ad hoc group call is established and on-going with the participants
MCVideo client 1, MCVideo client 2, MCVideo client 3, and MCVideo client 4.
The participants list is determined by both primary and partner systems
MCVideo server based on the criteria specified by the MCVideo client 1 while
initiating the call.
2\. The MCVideo server 1 detects that the ad hoc group call which is ongoing
is to be released e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving,
second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of
affiliated MCVideo group members are not present.

group call.
6a-6d. All the participants of the ad hoc group call receives the ad hoc group
call release request and sends the ad hoc group call release response to the
MCVideo server 1 of the primary MCVideo server.
NOTE: The ad hoc group call request and response exchanged between MCVideo
server 1 of primary MC system and MCVideo client 3/MCVideo client 4 will
always traversal through the MCVideo server 2.
##### 7.19.3.2.4 Procedure for ad hoc group call setup -- Participants list
provided by the Initiator
Figure 7.19.3.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure for ad hoc group call setup
procedure initiated by an authorized user wherein either a list of
participants or an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert is
provided by the authorised user and the determined MCVideo users are from
multiple MCVideo systems.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, it is considered that the partner MC system shares
their users\' information to the primary MC system.
2\. The authorized MCVideo user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MC system.
3\. The MCVideo server of the primary MC system is where the authorized
MCVideo user/dispatcher controls the ad hoc group.
4\. Some users of the ad hoc group belong to partner MC systems.
5\. The preconfigured group identity and preconfigured group configuration to
be used for an ad hoc group have been preconfigured in the MCVideo client and
other participants of ad hoc group have also received the relevant security
related information to allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group
communication.
6\. If an ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert is used to
invite the ad hoc group members, MCVideo client is aware of the ad hoc group
ID.
Figure 7.19.3.2.4-1: Ad hoc group call setup
1\. The MCVideo client of the authorized user initiates an ad hoc group call
with multiple users from primary and partner MC systems. An ad hoc group call
request message with the information of the MCVideo IDs or an ad hoc group ID
if the ad hoc group call follows an ad hoc group emergency alert is routed to
the MCVideo server of the primary MC system.
2\. If the ad hoc group call is supported, the MCVideo server of the primary
MC system verifies whether the user at MCVideo client is authorized to
initiate an ad hoc group call. If not authorized, the MCVideo server of the
primary MC system rejects the ad hoc group call request as specified in the
step 3.
If the information received in the request in step 1 does not contain an ad
hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCVideo server of the
primary MC system forms the ad hoc group by using received information. The
MCData server further determines the preconfigured group to be used for the
configuration and assigns an MCVideo group ID for the newly formed ad hoc
group.
If no MCVideo ad hoc group ID was included in the ad hoc group call request of
step 1, or if the provided MCVideo ad hoc group ID is not accepted by the
MCVideo server, the MCVideo server assigns a MCVideo group ID for the newly
formed ad hoc group
If the the MC service users\' information received in step 1 does not contain
an MCVideo ad hoc group ID from an ad hoc group emergency alert, the MCVideo
server of the primary MC system forms the ad hoc group by using MCVideo
users\' information received in step 1, determines the preconfigured group to
be used for the configuration of the ad hoc and assigns a MCVideo group ID for
the newly formed ad hoc group.
The MCVideo server identifies the appropriate MCVideo server responsible for
the MCVideo users of the ad hoc group. The MCVideo server considers the ad hoc
group call participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.
NOTE 1: The ad hoc group information including the MCVideo group ID and the
list of users is held in dynamic data in the MCVideo server.
3\. The MCVideo server shall send the ad hoc group call request return message
to the MCVideo client containing the below:
i. The MCVideo ad hoc group ID either generated by the MCVideo server or
provided by the MCVideo client if the ad hoc group ID is from an ad hoc group
emergency alert (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized);
ii. The group ID of the pre-configured group to be used for the ad hoc group
call (only included when the ad hoc group call is authorized); and
iii. Result of whether the ad hoc group call is authorized or not.
If the ad hoc group call request is not authorized, the MCVideo client shall
not proceed with the rest of the steps.
4\. The MCVideo server of the primary MC system sends the ad hoc group call
request to the affiliated group members of the ad hoc group belonging to the
primary MC system.
5\. The MCVideo clients receive in the ad hoc group call request the
information of the MCVideo group ID for the ad hoc group and further notify
their corresponding MCVideo user. The affiliated group members of the ad hoc
group of the primary MC system may accept or reject the call and respond with
the group call response.
6\. The primary MCVideo server further initiates an ad hoc group call request
message to the MCVideo users of the partner MC system. The ad hoc group call
request message is routed to the MCVideo users via the MCVideo server of the
partner MC system.
7\. The MCVideo clients receive in the ad hoc group call request the
information of the MCVideo group ID for the ad hoc group and further notify
their corresponding MCVideo user. The MCVideo users upon receipt of the
invitation may accept or reject the call, and respond with the ad hoc group
call response. The ad hoc group call response message is routed to the MCVideo
server of the primary MC system via the MCVideo server of the partner MC
system.
8\. The MCVideo server of the primary MC system provides an ad hoc group call
response message to the MCVideo client of the authorized MCVideo user upon
receiving response to the corresponding ad hoc group call request in step 1.
The ad hoc group call response will consist of the success or failure result
and/or detailed reason information in case of failure.
NOTE 2: The ad hoc group call response message is triggered depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
9\. Upon successful ad hoc group call setup, a group call is established
amongst the multiple group members from primary and partner MC systems. The
media plane and transmission control resources are established.
##### 7.19.3.2.5 Procedure for ad hoc group call release by MCVideo server --
Participants list provided by the Initiator
This procedure focuses on the case where an MCVideo server initiates the
termination of an ongoing MCVideo ad hoc group call for all the participants
of that group call, since at least one of the termination conditions are met
e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated
MCVideo group members are not present.
Procedures in figure 7.19.3.2.5-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MCVideo server initiating termination of an ongoing MCVideo ad hoc
group call.
Pre-condition:
\- The MCVideo client 1 and MCVideo client 2 belong to primary MC system. The
MCVideo client 3 belongs to partner MC system.
Figure 7.19.3.2.5-1: Ad hoc group call release
1\. The MCVideo users on MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 are already
part of the ongoing ad hoc group call (e.g. as a result of ad hoc group call
setup as specified in clause 7.19.3.2.4).
2\. The MCVideo server would like to release the ad hoc group call which is
ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of affiliated
MCVideo group members are not present.
3\. The MCVideo server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc group
call and generates ad hoc group call release request to release ongoing
session.
4\. The MCVideo server sends a ad hoc group call release request via SIP core
towards each participant of the ongoing group call. If the participants belong
to partner MC system, then ad hoc group call release request is routed to the
MCVideo clients of the partner MC system via the partner MCVideo server.
5\. The MCVideo users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group call.
6\. The MCVideo client(s) receiving ad hoc group call release request, send
acknowledgement towards the MCVideo server by sending a ad hoc group call
release response.
7\. The MCVideo client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the
transmission control and media plane resources associated with the ad hoc
group call that is terminated. The MCVideo servers remove the ad hoc group
information from the dynamic data held in the MCVideo servers and the ad hoc
group ceases to exist, otherwise if the ad hoc group call follows an ad hoc
group emergency alert the MCVideo servers keep the dynamic data and the ad hoc
group continues to exist.
###### ## Annex A (normative): MCVideo related configuration data
# A.1 General
This Annex provides information about the static data needed for configuration
for the MCVideo service, which belongs to one of the following categories:
\- MCVideo UE configuration data (see subclause A.2);
\- MCVideo user profile configuration data (see subclause A.3);
\- MCVideo related group configuration data (see subclause A.4); and
\- MCVideo service configuration data (see subclause A.5).
For each configuration category, data is split between configuration data that
is applicable to both on network and off network, configuration data that is
applicable to on-network only, and configuration data that is applicable to
off-network only. The configuration data in each configuration category
corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MCVideo UE,
MCVideo group, MCVideo user and MCVideo service configuration data refers to
the information that will be stored against each MCVideo UE, MCVideo group,
MCVideo user and MCVideo service. This means that the three separate tables
(on-network and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for each
configuration category represent the complete set of data for each
configuration data category element.
The columns in the tables have the following meanings:
\- Reference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.281
[3] or 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] or the corresponding subclause from either the
present document or the referenced document.
\- Parameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the
corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter
in the configuration hierarchy.
\- When it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is
configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the
following nomenclature is used:
\- \"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be
configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
\- \"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need
to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
Parameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy
that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the
configuration data is common across all three tables of on-network and off-
network, on network only and off network only. The level of a parameter within
the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character
\">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level.
Parameters that are at the top most level within the hierarchy have no \">\"
character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child
parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\"
character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child
parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child
parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they
are just containers for their child parameters.
Each parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through
one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline
shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent
configuration data made available to the MCVideo UE shall always overwrite
previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data
was provided via the online or offline mechanism.
# A.2 MCVideo UE configuration data
The general aspects of UE configuration are specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
Data in tables A.2-1 and A.2-2 have to be known by the MCVideo UE after
MCVideo authorization.
Data in table A.2-1 can be configured offline using the CSC-11 reference
point. Table A.2-1 contains the UE configuration required to support the use
of off-network MCVideo service.
Table A.2-1: UE configuration data (on and off network)
Reference Parameter description
* * *

group calls (Nc4) [R-5.4.2-003] of 3GPP TS 22.280 [2] Maximum number of video
transmissions (Nc5) in a group
Table A.2-2: UE configuration data (on network)
Reference Parameter description

service code (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7]) (optional) (see NOTE) >
MCVideo group ID > Relay service code (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7])
NOTE: When the value of the parameter Relay service is N, this parameter and
its child parameters are not needed.
# A.3 MCVideo user profile configuration data
The general aspects of MC service user profile configuration data are
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6]. The MCVideo user profile configuration data
is stored in the MCVideo user database. The MCVideo server obtains the MCVideo
user profile configuration data from the MCVideo user database (MCVideo-2).
Tables A.3-1 and A.3-2 contain the MCVideo user profile configuration required
to support the use of on-network MCVideo service. Tables A.3-1 and A.3-3
contain the MCVideo user profile configuration required to support the use of
off-network MCVideo service. Data in table A.3-1 and table A.3-3 can be
configured offline using the CSC-11 reference point.
