when a UAV is moving towards BVLOS or has poor direct link conditions, etc.)
as described in clause 7.4.2.4.
\- Support the switch between the Network-Assisted/Direct C2 communication and
UTM-Navigated C2 communication (e.g. for air traffic control, the UAV is
approaching a No Drone Zone, and detected potential security threats, etc.) as
described in clause 7.4.2.5.
\- Support the selection of the communication mode between: utilizing more
than one C2 communication links, and among applicable C2 communication links,
selecting a mode as the primary one as described in clause 7.4.2.3.

1\. UAE Clients (UAV and UAV-C) select a primary and secondary C2
communication mode based on C2 communication mode configuration.
2\. The UAE Client sends a C2 communication mode notification to the UAE
Server indicating the selected primary and secondary C2 communication modes
and associated C2 link information which may include UAE Client and peer
address information (e.g., IP/MAC address).
3\. The UAE Server stores the C2 communication modes and links information.
4a-4b. The UAE Server forwards the C2 communication mode and links information
to the UAS application specific server and receives a C2 communication mode
notification acknowledgement from the UAS application specific server.
5\. The UAE Server may forward the C2 communication mode notification
acknowledgement to the UAE Client.
6\. The UAV and UAV-C start C2 communication using the selected C2
communication mode.
NOTE: The details of step 6 are outside the scope of the present
specification.
#### 7.4.2.4 UAE-layer assisted dynamic C2 mode switching
This procedure provides a mechanism for supporting dynamic switching between
direct and network assisted C2 communications, which may be required while the
UAV flight is ongoing, due to possible change of network conditions, expected
location/mobility of the UAV, unpredictable events etc.
Figure 7.4.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure where the UAE server supports the
dynamic C2 mode switching for network-assisted C2 communications.
Pre-conditions:
1\. UAE Server has activated the dynamic C2 mode switching capability, as
described in clause 7.4.2.1
2\. UAE Server has subscribed for using SEAL/LMS services and has configured
the location event reporting, based on 3GPP TS 23.434 [5].
3\. UAE Client has selected a C2 communication mode as described in clause
7.4.2.3, and UAV and UAV-C are engaged in C2 communication.
Figure 7.4.2.4-1: UAE-assisted dynamic C2 mode switching
1\. The UAE Client detects a condition for switching C2 communication mode
based on local conditions (e.g. using the C2 communication mode switching
policy) or based on a command from the UAS application specific server (as
described in clause 7.4.2.5). A C2-related trigger event report is sent from
the UAE Client of the UAV and/or the UAV-C to the UAE Server, denoting a
command from the UAS application specific server or an application QoS
attribute change (experienced or expected) e.g. based on the experienced
packet delay or packet loss for the Uu or direct link (e.g. packet loss
greater than a pre-defined threshold).
> If a C2 direct mode availability reporting requirement exists based on
> clause 7.4.2.1 step 1, the detection of UAV/UAV-C(s) can be based on the PC5
> discovery due to the configurations received due procedures in clause
> 7.4.2.1 and clause 7.4.2.2. In this case, the C2-related trigger event
> report message can include also a C2 direct mode availability report
> including PC5 related configuration information.
2\. Additionally, the UAE Server receives a location report for the UAV/UAV-C
by the SEAL\'s LM server. The report can be either periodical or event-based
(e.g. UAV moving towards an area covered by a different cell or different
operator), as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [5] SEAL\'s LM server procedures
(UAE Server acting as a VAL server).
3\. The UAE Server determines the switching of the C2 mode from direct to
network assisted or vice versa or to UTM-Navigated**. If the switching is**
from direct to network assisted or vice versa, this is done by calculating the
relative actual or expected UAV-to-UAV-C location, as well as other factors
like QoS fulfilment/unfulfilment, augmented location, mobility/speed,
direction, topography, weather conditions.
4\. The UAE Server sends a C2 mode switching confirmation request to the UAS
application specific server, which includes the UAS identifier as well as the
cause for switching and the switching option (direct to network-assisted or
network-assisted to direct or to UTM-Navigated). The UAE Server sends this
request to obtain confirmation from the UAS application specific server before
proceeding with switching to UTM-Navigated. This step is optional in the case
of switching from direct to network assisted or vice versa.
5\. Conditional on Step 3, the UAE Server receives from the UAS application
specific server a C2 mode switching confirmation response indicating a
positive or negative result for the requested change.
6\. The UAE Server sends to the involved UAE Clients, a C2 operation mode
switching message which provides an instruction to the UAV and UAV-C to switch
to network-assisted mode or to direct mode or to UTM-Navigated. The UAV and
UAV-C start C2 communication using the indicated C2 communication mode (e.g.,
direct, network assisted, UTM-Navigated).
7\. If an emergency switch of the C2 communication is deemed necessary by the
UAE Client (e.g. sudden loss of the active C2 link), the UAE Client changes
the link prior to the steps 1-6, which are skipped. The UAE Clients send a C2
operation mode switching performed message to the UAE Server to confirm the
switching of the C2 communication mode.
#### 7.4.2.5 UAS application specific server triggered C2 communication mode
switching
This procedure provides a mechanism for supporting dynamic switching between
direct or network assisted C2 communications to UTM-Navigated, initiated by
the UAS application specific server (which can be the USS/UTM) after detecting
a C2 switching condition which may be required while the UAV enters a no-fly
zone. For example, the UAS application specific server needs to take over the
control of UAV and fly it to safety (see 3GPP TS 22.125 [2] clause 4.2).
Figure 7.4.2.5-1 illustrates a UAS application specific server triggered C2
communication mode switching.
Pre-conditions:
1\. UAE Server has activated the dynamic C2 mode switching capability, as
described in clause 7.4.2.1.
2\. UAE Client has selected a primary C2 communication mode as described in
clause 7.4.2.3, and UAV and UAV-C are engaged in (e.g., direct or network
assisted) C2 communication.
Figure 7.4.2.5-1: UAS application specific server triggered C2 communication
mode switching
1\. The UAS application specific client is instructed directly by a command
from the UAS application specific server to switch to UTM-Navigated mode.
NOTE: This procedure between the UAS application specific server and the UAS
application specific client is out of scope of the present document.
2\. The UAE Client initiates the procedure described in clause 7.4.2.4.

change of UAS application specific server. In particular, the UAE layer
provides support for the following operations:
\- Support of the registration of the UAE clients multi-USS capability to the
UAE server as described in clause 7.1a.
\- Support the distribution of the for multi-USS policies from the UAS
application specific server to the UAE server and the UAE client, as described
in clause 7.6.2.1 and clause 7.6.2.2.
\- Support the change of UAS application specific server, as described in
clause 7.6.2.3.
\- Support the UAE server triggered change of USS, as described in clause
7.6.2.5.
NOTE: The functions of the USS are out of scope of the present specification.
### 7.6.2 Procedures
#### 7.6.2.1 Management of multi-USS configuration
This procedure manages the multi-USS policies at the UAE server, based on an
application request from UAS application specific server to support the change
of USS for a UAS.
Figure 7.6.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure where the UAE server receives an
application request for managing the multi-USS policies for a UAS from the UAS
application specific server.
Pre-condition:
\- The UAV has received its UAS ID from the UAS application specific server.
\- The UAV has performed the UAS UE registration procedure.
Figure 7.6.2.1-1: Multi-USS management procedure
1\. The UAS application specific server sends to the UAE server a Multi-USS
management request. The request includes the UAV (UAE client) identifier and
the Multi-USS policies. A Multi-USS policy contains: allowed target USSes
(identified by e.g. FQDN), serving USS information, and additional information
for change of USS (USS change constraints parameter geo location/area
threshold for change of USS by UAV). The UAE server stores the Multi-USS
policies corresponding to the UAV ID. In case of removal of a Multi-USS policy
for a USS from the UAE server, the request shall include the UAV identifier
and a USS identifier (e.g. FQDN) for the USS that will be removed.
2\. The UAE server sends to the UAS application specific server a Multi-USS
management response with a positive or negative acknowledgement of the
request.
3\. UAE server executes the multi-USS configuration according to clause
7.6.2.2.
4\. After execution of USS management configuration, the UAE server notifies
the UAS application specific server with a Multi-USS management complete based
on the configured capabilities of the UAE client.
#### 7.6.2.2 Multi-USS configuration
This procedure enables the configuration of the UAE client, based on a request
from UAS application specific server to configure multi-USS policies to the
UAE client.
Figure 7.6.2.2-1 illustrates the Multi-USS configuration procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The UAS UEs are connected to 5GS and authenticated and authorized by UAS
application specific server as specified in clause 5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.256 [4].
2\. UAE server has established a UAE session with the respective UAE clients
as the UAE clients are successfully registered to the UAE server.
3\. UAE server has performed the Multi-USS management procedure according to
clause 7.6.2.1.
Figure 7.6.2.2-1: Multi-USS configuration
1\. The UAE server sends a Multi-USS configuration request to the UAE client.
The UAE client receives a Multi-USS configuration request that includes the
Multi-USS policies from the UAE server. In case of removal of one or more
Multi-USS policies for a USS from the UAE client, then the request shall only
include a USS identifier (e.g. FQDN) for the USSes that will be removed.
2\. The UAE client stores or removes the Multi-USS policies as per the
information received in step 1.
3\. The UAE client sends a Multi-USS configuration response to the UAE server.
#### 7.6.2.3 UAE layer assisted change of USS
This procedure provides a mechanism for supporting dynamic change of USS which
may be performed while the UAV flight is ongoing, due to expected
location/mobility of the UAV, emergency events, etc.
Figure 7.6.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure where the UAE server supports the
change of USS.
Pre-conditions:
1\. UAE client has indicated support of change of USS by the Multi-USS
capability.
2\. UAS application specific server has provided Multi-USS policies to the UAE
client and the UAE server.
Figure 7.6.2.3-1: UAE layer assisted change of USS
1\. The UAE server receives a USS change request from a serving USS (UAS
application specific server #1), indicating that a target USS (UAS application
specific server #2) an take over the communication. The request includes the
UAV (UAE client) identification information, target USS information and USS
change authorization information (e.g. authorization token). Optionally,
updated Multi-USS policies for one or more USSes can be included. The UAE
server verifies that the request is authorized (e.g., Multi-USS capability is
enabled, new USS part of the allowed USS information).
2\. If required, the UAE server translates this to a UP path change and
interacts with NEF as AF for influence UP path (switching to target DNAI). In
particular UAE server (acting as AF) checks whether it can serve the target
DNAI corresponding to the target USS based on the mapping of USS to DNAI which
was performed in step 2 of clause 7.6.2.5. Interaction with 5GC is performed
according to functionality for application function influence on traffic
routing, see 3GPP TS 23.502 [13] clause 4.3.6.3.
3\. The UAE server forwards the USS change request to the UAE client including
target USS information and updated Multi-USS policies.
4\. Perform change of USS.
> The UAE client initiates communication with the target USS based on the USS
> change request and the Multi-USS policies.
5\. The UAE client sends a USS change response indicating to what USS the
change of USS has been performed.
6\. The UAE server sends a USS change response to the UAS application specific
server indicating that a change of USS has been performed.
#### 7.6.2.4 UAE client assisted change of USS
This procedure enables the UAE client to provide a dynamic change of USS while
the UAV flight is ongoing, due to an emergency change of USS deemed necessary
by the UAE client. The UAE client initiates the change of USS on behalf of the
USS based on previously provided Multi-USS policy.
Figure 7.6.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure where the UAE server supports the
change of USS.
Pre-conditions:
1\. UAE client has indicated support of change of USS by the Multi-USS
capability.
2\. UAS application specific server has provided Multi-USS policies to the UAE
client and the UAE server.
Figure 7.6.2.4-1: UAE client assisted change of USS
1\. An emergency change of USS is deemed necessary by the UAE Client, and the
UAE client initiates the change of USS on behalf of the USS based on
previously provided Multi-USS policy.
2\. Perform change of USS. The UAE client initiates communication with the
target USS (UAS application specific server #2) based on the previously
provided Multi-USS policies.
3\. The UAE client sends a USS change notification indicating to what USS the
change of USS has been performed. The identity of the target USS (UAS
application specific server #2) is included. The USS change notification is
only sent if the UAE client has a connection to the UAE server.
4\. The UAE server sends a USS change notification to the UAS application
specific server #1 indicating that a change of USS has been performed.
#### 7.6.2.5 UAE server triggered change of USS
In multi-USS scenarios, each USS can be physically located in different
clouds, and it is also possible that a USS is deployed at the edge.
Figure 7.6.2.5-1 illustrates the procedure where the UAE server supports
change of USS for a multi-USS/LUN scenario, where the interaction with the
communication network for supporting a UAS session requires the interaction to
more than one USS e.g., due to UAV mobility to different geographical area
covered by different edge clouds.
Pre-conditions:
\- The UAV has performed the UAS UE registration procedure.
\- UAE client and UAE server have indicated multi-USS support.
Figure 7.6.2.5-1: UAE server triggered change of USS
1\. The UAE server has performed the USS management procedure of clause
7.6.3.1; however, at the multi-USS management request, UAE server also
receives from UAS application specific server the USS service areas
(geographical) for all allowed USSs, and optionally the USS to DNAI mapping
and a USS list per given Local USS network (LUN).
2\. The UAE server maps each USS with different topological areas based on the
USS to DNAI mapping (based on step 1), for all USSs which are allowed for a
target area where the UAV is allowed to fly (e.g. within the LUN). Then it
also maps and stores all pairs of \ per LUN or for the areas of
interest for the UAV (e.g., based on the allowable routes).
3\. The UAE server tracks the location of the UAV, by requesting on-demand
location monitoring from SEAL LMS (acting as VAL server in procedure of clause
9.3.4 or clause 9.3.5 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [5]) or via subscribing for monitoring
the UAV location deviation (specified in clause 9.3.11 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [5]).
4\. The UAE server detects an expected UAV location change to an area covered
by a different USS (based on SEAL LMS monitoring subscription/request as in
step 3), it generates a trigger event indicating that the UE moves to an area
where the USS is overlapping with other USS, or another overlapping USS within
LUN area is not available.
> If it is an overlap, the UAE server checks whether the performance of
> serving USS is expected to get impacted (e.g., by requesting DN performance
> analytics for the target area) or if the serving USS is not supported at
> target area, checks what is the best available USS and whether this can
> provide the same services. The criteria for the best available USS may
> relate to the location of the UAV, but it can also be the priorities of the
> USS (based on the policies received) at the target area and the capabilities
> (services) provided by the target USS.
5\. The UAE server sends to the UAS application specific server a USS change
trigger notify indicating the recommendation for a USS change for the UAS and
provides the target USS ID. Alternatively, the trigger message indicates a UAV
mobility event, based on steps 3/4.
6\. The UAS change procedure follows as specified in 7.6.2.3.

## 7.8 Tracking dynamic UAVs in an application defined area relative to a host
UAV
### 7.8.1 General
The UAE server can be responsible for tracking a host UAV's dynamic
information (i.e., information of other dynamic UAVs in an application defined
area relative to a host UAV). As per a proximity range set by the application
layer (e.g. UAS Application Specific Server), the UAE layer supports providing
the dynamic information (i.e. other UAVs' location information) to the UAS
Application Specific Server (UTM/USS) and/or to the host UAV. This feature can
be utilized by UAS applications (e.g. DAA, Dynamic maps).
This feature utilizes the following procedures:
\- UAS Application Specific Server or the host UAV subscription for host UAV's
dynamic information with UAE server.
\- UAE server tracking host UAV's UE location with support from SEAL's
location management server.
\- UAE server management of dynamic UE location based group.
\- UAE server obtaining dynamic information from the UAVs in application
defined proximity range of the host UAV.
\- UAE server notification of host UAV's dynamic information to the UAS
Application Specific Server and/or to the host UAV.
NOTE: The details of the usage of dynamic information of host UAV by UAS
Application Specific Server or by the host UAV is out of scope of this
specification.
### 7.8.2 Procedures
#### 7.8.2.1 Subscription for host UAV dynamic information
Figure 7.8.2.1-1 describes the procedure for subscription for host UAV's
dynamic information.
Pre-condition:
\- UAS Application Specific Server has registered with UAE server 1 which is
responsible for the host UAV.
\- The UAV ID and application defined proximity range information are
configured on the host UAV.
Figure 7.8.2.1-1: Subscription for host UAV dynamic information
1\. The UAS Application Specific Server or UAE client of host UAV sends a
subscribe host UAV dynamic information request to the UAE server 1. The
request includes the UAV ID of the host UAV, application defined proximity
range information.
2\. The UAE server 1 stores the subscription information.
3\. The UAE server 1 sends subscription response to the UAS Application
Specific Server.
4\. The UAE server 1 obtains and initiates tracking the host UAV location from
the location management server 1 as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [5].
#### 7.8.2.2 Management of dynamic UE location based group
Figure 7.8.2.2-1 describes the procedure for management of dynamic UE location
based group.
Pre-condition:
\- UAE server 1 has received an updated location of the host UAV as per
procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [5].
\- UAE server 1 is configured with UAE server 2..N information of other UAS
operator and their supported region of operation.
Figure 7.8.2.2-1: Management of dynamic UE location group
1\. Dynamic UE location based group creation or update is triggered (e.g.
notified of the UE location of host UAV) via the step 4 in clause 7.8.2.1 for
the UAV ID of the host UAV.
2\. UAE server 1 uses its associated LMS 1 to obtain the dynamic UE list and
the corresponding location information in the proximity area of the host UAV
by providing the application defined proximity range and the UE location of
the host UAV as specified in clause 9.3.10 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [5].
3\. UAE server 1 determines the list of other UAE servers 2..N operating in
the same location.
4\. For each UAE server determined in step 3, UAE server 1 requests the
dynamic UE list and its corresponding location information for the application
defined proximity range by providing the UE location of the host UAV.
5\. The UAE server(s) 2..N obtain UE information corresponding to the UE
location and application defined proximity range from its corresponding LMS
2..N as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [5].
6\. The UAE server(s) 2..N sends get response with UE list in the UE location
and application defined proximity range to UAE server 1.
7\. If UAE server 1 has no dynamic UE location group for the UAV ID, the UAE
server 1 creates a dynamic UE location based group with the UE list received
from its LMS and other UAE server(s) 2..N. Further UAE server 1 stores the
dynamic UE location based group. Otherwise, the UAE server 1 updates the
dynamic UE location group with the latest UE information. The UAVs whose
locations are no more within the application defined proximity range are
removed from the dynamic UE location group.
#### 7.8.2.3 Obtaining dynamic information of the UEs in application defined
proximity range
##### 7.8.2.3.1 Subscription procedure within UAS operator
Figure 7.8.2.3.1-1 describes the subscription procedure within UAS operator to
obtain dynamic information from the UEs in application defined proximity
range.
Pre-condition:
\- UAE server 1 is tracking the host UAV and has created the dynamic UE
location based group as per procedure in clause 7.8.2.2.
Figure 7.8.2.3.1-1: Subscription procedure within UAS operator
1\. The UAE server 1 managing the dynamic UE location group sends subscribe
dynamic information request to the UAE clients who are part of the dynamic UE
location group. These UAE clients (UAVs) belong to the same UAS operator as
the host UAV. The request consists of reporting configuration (e.g. frequency
of reporting, event based).
2\. The UAE client(s) store the subscription information.
3\. The UAE client(s) send a subscription response to the UAE server 1.
##### 7.8.2.3.2 Subscription procedure across UAS operators
Figure 7.8.2.3.2-1 describes the subscription procedure across UAS operators
to obtain dynamic information from the UEs in application defined proximity
range.
Pre-condition:
\- UAE server 1 has created the dynamic UE location based group as per
procedure in clause 7.8.2.2.
Figure 7.8.2.3.2-1: Subscription procedure across UAS operators

###### ## Annex A (informative): Support for edge deployments
The application architecture for supporting edge applications are specified in
3GPP TS 23.558 [7]. The UAS application layer as specified in clause 5 can be
deployed in edge computing environment.
Figure A-1 illustrates a UAS application layer deployment in edge computing
environments.
Figure A-1: UAS application layer deployment in edge computing environment
Figure A-1 illustrates how the UAS application architecture with EDGEAPP
support for edge deployments can be deployed. In a UE, the UAS application
specific client(s), UAE client and SEAL clients interact with the Edge Enabler
Client (EEC) via EDGE-5 reference point in order to consume edge services. In
an Edge Data Network (EDN), the UAS application specific server(s), UAE server
and SEAL servers acting as Edge Application Server (EAS), interacts with the
Edge Enabler Server (EES) via EDGE-3 reference point. The service provisioning
and EAS discovery enable the UAS application layer entities in the UE to
communicate with the application layer entities in the EDN. The interactions
between the entities and 5GS are not shown for the sake of simplicity.
NOTE: This clause illustrates an example edge deployment using edge enabler
layer. There can be other valid edge deployments enabled for UAS application
layer.
###### ## Annex B (Informative): Deployment models
# B.1 General
This clause describes deployments of the functional model specified in clause
5. The reference points utilized from underlying 3GPP network as specified in
clause 5.5 is represented as 3GPP interfaces in the deployment models.
NOTE: The representation of SEAL functionalities in the vertical deployment is
specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [5].
# B.2 Deployment of UAE server
The UAE server deployments can be centralized and distributed.
## B.2.1 Centralized deployments
A centralized deployment is where a single UAE server offers the UAE
capabilities to one or more UAS application specific servers (e.g. USS/UTM).
The UAE server and the UAS application specific server can be co-located in a
single physical entity. The UAE server can be deployed either in the PLMN
operator domain or deployed in the UAS operator domain. The UAE server
connects with the 3GPP network systems (EPS, 5GS) in one or more PLMN operator
domain. When UAE server and UAS application specific server are co-located in
a single physical entity, the Us reference point between the UAE server and
the UAS application specific server is not used.
Figure B.2.1-1 illustrates a deployment of the UAE server and the UAS
application specific server in a single physical entity and deployed in UAS
operator domain. The UAE server can be deployed in a separate physical entity
from the UAS application specific server in the UAS operator domain. In such
deployments, the Us reference point is used for the communication between the
UAE server and the UAS application specific server.
Figure B.2.1-1: UAE server co-located with UAS application specific server in
a single physical entity
Figure B.2.1-2 illustrates a deployment of the UAE server in the PLMN operator
domain and the UAS application specific server in the UAS operator domain. The
Us reference point is used for the communication between UAS application
specific server and the UAE server. The UAE server can support multiple UAS
application specific servers.
Figure B.2.1-2: UAE server deployed in the PLMN operator domain
Figure B.2.1â€‘3 illustrates a deployment of the UAE server which connects to
the 3GPP network systems (EPS, 5GS) in multiple PLMN operator domain. The UAE
server can be co-located with the UAS application specific server in a single
physical entity or deployed in different physical entities.
Figure B.2.1-3: Deployment of UAE server with connections to 3GPP network
systems in multiple PLMN operator domains
Figure B.2.1â€‘4 illustrates a deployment of the UAE server which provides UAE
capabilities to multiple UAS application specific servers over Us reference
point and connects to the 3GPP network systems (EPS, 5GS) in multiple PLMN
operator domain.
Figure B.2.1-4: Deployment of UAE server with connections to multiple UAS
application specific servers
## B.2.2 Distributed deployment
The distributed deployment is where multiple UAE servers are deployed either
in the UAS operator domain or in the PLMN operator domain. The distributed
deployment of the UAE servers provide geographical coverage or support
multiple PLMN operator domains in a geographical location. The UAE servers
interconnect via UAE-E and the Us reference point is used for interaction
between UAS application specific server and the UAE server.
Figure B.2.2-1 illustrates the deployment of UAE servers in multiple PLMN
operator domain and provides UAE capabilities to the UAS application specific
server deployed in the UAS operator domain. The UAS application specific
server connects via Us to the UAE servers.
Figure B.2.2-1: Distributed deployment of UAE servers in multiple PLMN
operator domain without interconnection between UAE servers
Figure B.2.2-2 illustrates the deployment of multiple UAE servers deployed in
multiple PLMN operator domains. The UAS application specific server connects
via Us to the UAE server. The interconnection between UAE servers is via UAE-E
and supports the UAS applications for the UAS UEs connected to the UAE servers
in multiple PLMN operator domains.
Figure B.2.2-2: Distributed deployment of UAE servers in multiple PLMN
operator domain with interconnection between UAE servers
Figure B.2.2-3 illustrates the deployment of multiple UAE servers in PLMN
operator domain based on geographical coverage. The UAS application specific
server connects via Us to the UAE server 1. The UAE servers interconnect via
UAE-E and support the UAS communications to the UAS UEs (i.e., UAV, UAV-C)
connected to the UAE servers.
Figure B.2.2-3: Distributed deployment of UAE servers in PLMN operator domain
Figure B.2.2-4 illustrates the deployment of multiple UAE servers in the UAS
operator domain where UAE server 1 and UAE server 2 connect with 3GPP network
system of PLMN operator domain 1 and PLMN operator domain 2 respectively. The
UAS application specific server connects via Us to the UAE server 1. The UAE
servers interconnect via UAE-E and support the UAS applications for the UAS
UEs connected via both the PLMN operator domains.
Figure B.2.2-4: Distributed deployment of UAE servers in UAS operator domain
###### ## Annex C (informative): Examples of usage of SEAL by UAS application
specific server
All procedures of SEAL services (e.g. GMS, LMS) are available directly for
usage by UAS application specific server. Some examples of the usage of SEAL
by the UAS application specific server is illustrated below:
\- Group creation procedures of Group Management server provides support for
the UAS applications (e.g. paired UAV and UAV-C are grouped) to provide a
dedicated group for the UAV and UAV-C to communicate with each other.
\- The UAS application specific server (e.g. USS/UTM) monitors the presence of
UAVs in a given geographic area by using the Monitoring Location Deviation
procedure of the LM server.
\- The UAS application specific server (e.g. USS/UTM) can directly fetch the
multiple UAV related events from NRM server (e.g. to detect any events related
to the UAV, the UAS application specific server can need multiple events
related to the UAV (UE) from the 3GPP core network).
\- The UAS application specific client and UAS application specific server can
utilize the resource management procedures of the NRM server to manage unicast
resources associated to SIP sessions.
