# Introduction
The ad hoc group call allows authorised users to combine a set of MCX users
based on implementation-specific criteria into a group call. The main
characteristics of this ad hoc group call are:
a) The ad hoc group does not exist until it is spontaneously created during
the call.
b) The ad hoc group ceases to exist when the call terminates.
c) The ad hoc group does not support \'persistent state\' communication, e.g.
emergency state.
MCX users that are combined in an ad hoc group call can be served by the same
or different MCX systems. The ad hoc group call uses a common security level,
priority level, floor control method, and set of operational characteristics
for the participants during the call. As with any group call, the priority
level can change dynamically.
The ad hoc group is used for a single call and it does not persist when the
call is terminated. Authorized users can recreate the ad hoc group for
subsequent calls, or request creation of a permanent MCX group from the
participants in the ad hoc group call.
This technical report identifies the key issues and corresponding solutions
with recommendations for the normative work.
# 1 Scope
The present document studies solutions to satisfy the requirements identified
to support Ad hoc group communication for MCX services. It identifies
enhancements to be included in the technical specifications for MCPTT,
MCVideo, MCData and in the common functional architecture to support Ad hoc
group communications. Requirements for this study are taken from 3GPP TS
22.280 [3].

# 4 Key issues
## 4.1 Key issue 1 -- Ad hoc group communication
The requirements for MCX service Ad hoc group communication are captured in
3GPP TS 22.280 [3] clause 6.15.5.
Ad hoc group communication enables authorized MCX users to combine a random
set of MCX Users into a group communication. The ad hoc group does not exist
until it is spontaneously created during the communication and it ceases to
exist once the communication is terminated. The participants of the ad hoc
group communication may be served by the same or different MC systems.
Hence it is required to study the following:
\- Procedures for establishing and release of the ad hoc group communication.
\- Procedures for establishing the ad hoc group communication with end-to-end
encryption support.
\- Identify whether new information flows are required or existing information
flows can be enhanced to support the ad hoc group communication set up.
\- How to support different mechanisms for determining the participants list
for the ad hoc group communication. It could be supplied by the initiator of
the ad hoc group call or determined by the MCX system based on some pre-
defined criteria.
\- How to support a mechanism for the initiator of an MCX Service ad hoc group
communication to request that the list of participants be determined and
updated by the MCX Service system using a specific pre-defined criteria.
\- Identify whether any changes are required to the existing MCX functional
architecture for supporting the ad hoc group communication.
## 4.2 Key issue 2 -- Network topology hiding from MC service client while
establishing Ad hoc group communication
Ad hoc group communication enables authorized MCX users to combine a random
set of MCX Users into a group communication. To best utilize the network
resources, achieve best network performance and provide service resilience, a
network operator normally deploys more than one MC service servers to serve
its customers. This is applicable for all types of group communication and
especially true in ad hoc group communications when it enables authorized
users to combine a random set of MCX users into a group communication. This
kind of deployment topology cannot be exposed and learned by the third party
and only be controlled by the network operator. Ad hoc group is created
spontaneously by the initiating client during the communication set up and
therefore it leaves no choice for the network operators to decide on where to
host the communication beforehand.
Hence it is required to study the following:
\- How the group ID used for the ad hoc group communication can be created by
MC service client and managed when establishing the ad hoc group
communication.
\- Whether and how to support the ad hoc group communication without exposing
the network topology.
\- Whether and how to support the ad hoc group communication with dynamically
allocated network resources (such as the MC service server that will host the
communication).
NOTE: This key issue also applies to existing specification of temporary
groups creation by MC service client (e.g user regroup)
## 4.3 Key issue 3 -- Configuration parameters for Ad hoc group communication
3GPP TS 22.280[3] has defined several requirements related to configuration of
parameters required for ad hoc group communication by the administrator and
initiator of the ad hoc group communication. Hence it is required to study the
following :
\- Identify the required system or service level configuration parameters and
document them.
\- Identify the user level configuration parameters and document them.
\- Identify the default parameters to be configured which will be applied when
these parameters are not supplied as part of the ad hoc group communication
request by the initiator.
\- How the MCX server shall be able to determine whether the user is
authorized to initiate ad hoc group communication.
## 4.4 Key issue 4 -- Modifying participants list of on-going ad hoc group
communication
During the course of an on-going ad hoc group communication, the initiator of
the ad hoc group communication can be able to add or remove particpants from
the communication or the MCX system can add or remove participants based on
some pre-defined criteria. This key issue is to identify the information flows
and procedures required between the MCX client and MCX server to add/remove
particpants to/from an on-going ad hoc group communication.
## 4.5 Key issue 5 -- Ad hoc group emergency alert
Ad hoc group emergency alert enables MC service users to send an MC service
emergency alert also to an ad hoc group. The participants of the ad hoc
emergency alert group may be served by multiple MC systems.
It is required to study the following:
\- How the solution for the ad hoc group communication can be reused for the
ad hoc group emergency alert.
\- Procedures for initiating and cancelling an ad hoc group emergency alert.
\- Support of a functional alias as target for sending an alert notification.
\- Whether any new information flows are required or whether existing ad hoc
group information flows can be enhanced to support ad hoc group emergency
alerts.
\- Whether the participants list for the ad hoc group emergency alert needs
any modification compared to an ad hoc group communication.
\- Whether any changes are required to the existing MC functional model to
support the ad hoc group emergency alert.
\- Clarify whether and which additional information along with the alert
indication is useful.

### 7.1.3 Procedure
#### 7.1.3.1 Ad hoc group communication within one MC system
##### 7.1.3.1.1 Ad hoc group communication setup
Figure 7.1.3.1.1-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group communication setup
procedure initiated by an authorized user.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The authorized user at MC service client 1 wants to invite MC service
users at MC service client 2, MC service client 3 and MC service client 4 for
the ad hoc group communication.
2\. Number of participants being invited for the communication is within the
limit for non pre-configured approach.
3\. End-to-End encryption is supported for this ad hoc group communication.
4\. MC service client 1 is aware of the MC service IDs of the participants and
has all the security related information required to communicate with the
participants of the ad hoc group communication.
NOTE: Selection of MC service IDs of the participants can be manual or from
the user profile configuration data or by any other means. This is left for
the implementation.
Figure 7.1.3.1.1-1: Ad hoc group communication setup
1\. User at MC service client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group
communication. MC service client 1 initiates the ad hoc group communication by
sending the ad hoc group communication request containing the list of
participants to the MC service server. Encryption supported information
element shall be set to true since end-to -end encryption is supported. The ad
hoc group communication request may also contain block sharing participants
list indicator information element set to true if the originating user want to
suppress sharing of the participants list to other users. The ad hoc group
communication request may include the MC service group ID that is created by
the MC service client 1 or not include the MC service group ID that allow the
MC service server to assign one for use. An SDP offer containing the MC
service client media parameters is included. If there is a floor request to
transmit, then the ad hoc group communication request contains an indication
of an implicit floor request. If the MC service user of MC service client 1
has selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group communication request
contains that functional alias. If the ad hoc group communication request
contains an implicit floor request it may also include location information.
If the MC service user at MC service client 1 initiates an MC service
emergency ad hoc group communication or the MC service emergency state is
already set for the MC service client 1 (due to a previously triggered MC
service emergency alert):
i. the MC service ad hoc group communication request shall contain an
emergency indicator;
ii. if the MC service emergency state is not set already, MC service client 1
sets its MC service emergency state. The MC service emergency state of MC
service client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MC
service client 1.
2\. The MC service server accepts the ad hoc group communication request if
the ad hoc group communication is supported and authorized. Otherwise reject
the ad hoc group communication request and do not continue with the rest of
the steps. If authorised, it validates whether the number of invited
participants is within the configured limit before proceeding with the
communication setup.
If functional alias is present, the MC service server checks whether the
provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the
user.
If location information was included in the ad hoc group communication
request, the MC service server checks the privacy policy of the MC service
user to decide if the location information of MC service client 1 can be
provided to other users on the communication (refer to Annex A.3
\"Authorisation to provide location information to other MC service users on a
communication when talking\").
> If an emergency indicator is present in the received MC service ad hoc group
> communication request, the MC service ad hoc group is considered to be in
> the in-progress emergency state until this ad hoc group communication is
> terminated; and
>
> If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MC service ad hoc
> group communication request, the MC service ad hoc group is considered to be
> in the in-progress imminent peril state until this ad hoc group
> communication is terminated.
>
> The MC service server considers the ad hoc group communication participants
> as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.
>
> 3\. The MC service server shall send the ad hoc group communication request
> return message to MC service client 1 containing the below:
i. The MC service ad hoc group ID (e.g. either provided by MC service client 1
which is acceptable to the MC service server or generated by the MC service
server in the case where the MC service ad hoc group ID created by the MC
service client 1 is not acceptable or the case where the MC service ad hoc
group ID was not provided by MC service client 1); and
ii. Result of whether the ad hoc group communication is authorized or not
> If the ad hoc group communication request is not authorized, MC service
> client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.
4a-4c. MC service client 1 sends AHGC share security material command
targeting each of the participants containing the security material to be
shared with the participants for use in this ad hoc group communication.
NOTE 1: If end-to-end encryption is not supported, then the ad hoc group
communication security material requests are not sent.
5a-5c. The MC service server sends the ad hoc group communication requests
towards the MC service clients of the invited users based on step 1. While
sending the ad hoc group communication requests, the MC service server shall
remove the information elements that are not required to be conveyed to the
target MC service clients (e.g. Block sharing participants list indicator, MC
service ID list of the users who are required to acknowledge)
6a-6c. The receiving MC service clients are notified about the incoming ad hoc
group communication.
7a-7c. The receiving MC service clients accept the ad hoc group communication
requests and send ad hoc group communication responses to the MC service
server. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MC
service user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MC
service server.
8\. The MC service server sends the ad hoc group communication response to MC
service client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful
communication establishment.
NOTE 2: Steps 5 to step 7 can start to occur before all of step 4 is completed
since the MC service server do not require to wait for the previous ad hoc
group communication request to complete before sending the ad hoc group
request to another participant.
9\. If the initiating MC service user requires the acknowledgement from the
invited MC service users, and the required MC service users do not acknowledge
the communication setup within a configured time (the \"acknowledged
communication setup timeout\"), then the MC service server may proceed with or
abandon the communication and then notify the initiating MC service user that
the acknowledgements did not include all required members according to ad hoc
group communication policy from the user profile configuration. The MC service
server may notify the initiating MC service user of all MC service users who
did not acknowledge the ad hoc group communication request within the
configured time. This notification may be sent to the initiating MC service
user by the MC service server more than once during the communication when MC
service users join or leave the MC service ad hoc group communication.
10\. MC service client 1, MC service client 2, MC service client 3 and MC
service client 4 establish media plane and floor control resources.
NOTE 3: Step 10 can occur any time following step 8 if the conditions to
proceed with the communication are met.
##### 7.1.3.1.2 Release ad hoc group communication
The procedure focuses on the case where the MC service server releases an
ongoing MC service ad hoc group communication for all the participants of that
ad hoc group communication, since at least one of the release conditions are
met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving, second last
participant leaving, initiator leaving.
Figure 7.1.3.1.2-1 below illustrates the signalling control plane procedure
for the MC service server initiating termination an ongoing ad hoc group
communication.
Figure 7.1.3.1.2-1: Release ad hoc group communication
1\. It is assumed that MC service users on MC service client 1, client 2 and
client 3 are already part of the ongoing ad hoc group communication.
2\. MC service server would like to release the MC service ad hoc group
communication which is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant
leaving, second last participant leaving, initiator leaving.
3\. MC service server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc group
communication and generates ad hoc group communication release request to
release ongoing session. The MC service server cancels the in-progress
emergency state or in-progress imminent peril state of the ad hoc group if the
ad hoc group communication is an emergency or imminent peril communication
respectively.
4\. MC service server sends ad hoc group communication release request via SIP
core towards each participant of the ongoing ad hoc group communication.
5\. MC service users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group
communication.
6\. MC service client(s) receiving ad hoc group communication release request,
acknowledge towards the MC service server by sending an ad hoc group
communication release response.
NOTE: If the participants list is not suppressed by the initiator of the ad
hoc group communication, the MC service client(s) may choose to store the list
of participants for easy re-initiation of another ad hoc group communication
with the same participants.
7\. MC service client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released the
floor control and media plane resources associated with the ad hoc group
communication that is terminated and the ad hoc group ceases to exist (i.e.,
further communication is not possible over the same ad hoc group.
##### 7.1.3.1.3 MC service server determining the participants list for the Ad
hoc group communication setup
Figure 7.1.3.1.3-1 below illustrates the ad hoc group communication setup
procedure initiated by the MC service user and MC service client 1 wherein the
list of participants is determined by the MC service server based on the
citeria received from the MC service client.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service user at MC service client 1 is authorized to initate ad hoc
group communication.
2\. The MC service user at MC service client 1 wants to invite MC service
users who are satisying certain criteria for the ad hoc group communication.
Figure 7.1.3.1.3-1: Ad hoc group communication participants determined by MC
service server
1\. User at MC service client 1 would like to initiate an ad hoc group
communication in-order to invite the participants satisfying specific
criteria. MC service client 1 initiates the ad hoc group communication by
sending the ad hoc group communication request containing the details of the
criteria to be applied by the MC service server for determining the
participants list. If end-to-end encryption is supported Encryption supported
information element shall be set to true and pre-configured ad hoc group
identity whose configuration is to be applied is included. The ad hoc group
communication request may include the MC service group ID that is created by
the MC service client 1 or not include the MC service group ID that allow the
MC service server to assign one for use. An SDP offer containing the MC
service client media parameters is included. If there is a floor request to
transmit, then the ad hoc group communication request contains an indication
of an implicit floor request. If the MC service user of MC service client 1
has selected a functional alias, then the ad hoc group communication request
contains that functional alias. If the ad hoc group communication request
contains an implicit floor request it may also include location information.
If the MC service user at MC service client 1 initiates an MC service
emergency ad hoc group communication or the MC service emergency state is
already set for the MC service client 1 (due to a previously triggered MC
service emergency alert):
i. the MC service ad hoc group communication request shall contain an
emergency indicator;
ii. if the MC service emergency state is not set already, MC service client 1
sets its MC service emergency state. The MC service emergency state of MC
service client 1 is retained until explicitly cancelled by the user of MC
service client 1.
2\. The MC service server accepts the ad hoc group communication request if
the ad hoc group communication is supported and authorized. Otherwise reject
the ad hoc group communication request and do not continue with the rest of
the steps.
If functional alias is present, the MC service server checks whether the
provided functional alias is allowed to be used and has been activated for the
user.
If location information was included in the ad hoc group communication
request, the MC service server checks the privacy policy of the MC service
user to decide if the location information of MC service client 1 can be
provided to other users on the communication (refer to Annex A.3
\"Authorisation to provide location information to other MC service users on a
communication when talking\").
If an emergency indicator is present in the received MC service ad hoc group
communication request, the MC service ad hoc group is considered to be in the
in-progress emergency state until this ad hoc group communication is
terminated; and
If an imminent peril indicator is present in the received MC service ad hoc
group communication request, the MC service ad hoc group is considered to be
in the in-progress imminent peril state until this ad hoc group communication
is terminated.
3\. The MC service server shall send the ad hoc group communication request
return message to MC service client 1 containing the below:
i. The MC service ad hoc group ID (e.g. either provided by MC service client 1
which is acceptable to the MC service server or generated by the MC service
server in the case where the MC service ad hoc group ID created by the MC
service client 1 is not acceptable or the case where the MC service ad hoc
group ID was not provided by MC service client 1); and
ii. Result of whether the ad hoc group communication is authorized or not
If the ad hoc group communication request is not authorized, MC service server
and client 1 shall not proceed with the rest of the steps.
4\. The MC service server determines the list of participants to be invited
for the ad hoc group communication based on the information present in the
information element Criteria for determining the participants. This
information element could carry either criteria or indicator identifying the
criteria or combination of both.
5\. The MC service server sends the ad hoc group communication requests
towards the MC service clients 2 and 3. While sending the ad hoc group
communication requests, the MC service server shall remove the information
elements that are not required to be conveyed to the target MC service
clients. This request carries the pre-configured group ID whose configuration
is to be applied for this ad hoc group communication if end-to-end encryption
is requested. The MC service server considers the ad hoc group communication
participants as implicitly affiliated to the ad hoc group.
6\. The receiving MC service clients are notified about the incoming ad hoc
group communication.
7\. The receiving MC service clients accept the ad hoc group communication
requests and send ad hoc group communication responses to the MC service
server. The response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MC
service user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MC
service server.
8\. The MC service server sends the ad hoc group communication response to MC
service client 1 through the signalling path to inform about successful
communication establishment.
9\. The MC service server may notify the initiating MC service user of all MC
service users who acknowledged the ad hoc group communication request and
joined the ad hoc group communication. This notification may be sent to the
initiating MC service user by the MC service server more than once during the
communication when MC service users join or leave the MC service ad hoc group
communication.
10\. MC service client 1, MC service client 2 and MC service client 3
establish media plane and floor control resources.

### 7.1.4 Solution Evaluation
The procedures proposed as part of this solution handles the ad hoc group
communication setup and release as per the key issue 1. It also achieves the
end-to-end security as per the stage-1 requirements. This solution introduces
a new set of information flows required for ad hoc group communication. It
also proposes a mechanism for the ad hoc group communication setup wherein the
particpants of the communication is determined by the MC service server based
on the criteria which is either pre-defined or supplied by the initiator of
the communication.
Further the proposed solutions provide flexibility for the deployments to use
the ad hoc group ID provided by the MC service client or the MC service server
can generate and share the same to the initiator of the ad hoc group
communication. This solution may require additional deployment considerations
e.g. to configure the maximum number of participants allowed to participate in
an ad hoc group communication, to meet the Stage 1 group call KPIs.
The procedures proposed as part of this solution implicitly handles the Key
issue #2 related to network topology hiding from MC service client while
establishing Ad hoc group communication by having the ad hoc group ID
generated by the MC service server.
## 7.2 Solution 2: Ad hoc group call involving multiple MC systems
### 7.2.1 General
This solution pertains to key issue#1. The key characteristics of ad hoc group
call are the following:
\- The ad hoc group does not exist until it is spontaneously created during
the ad hoc group call setup.
\- The ad hoc group ceases to exist when the communication terminates with the
ad hoc group call release.
### 7.2.2 Solution description
#### 7.2.2.1 Procedures
##### 7.2.2.1.1 Procedure for ad hoc group call setup
Figure 7.2.2.1.1-1 illustrates the procedure for ad hoc group call setup
procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MC system does not share
their users\' information to the primary MC system.
2\. The authorized MC service user/dispatcher belongs to the primary MC
system.
3\. The MC service server of the primary MC system is where the authorized MC
service user/dispatcher creates the ad hoc group.
4\. Some users of the ad hoc group may belong to partner MC systems.
5\. The ad hoc group identity and ad hoc group configuration for an ad hoc
group have been preconfigured in MC service client and other participants of
ad hoc group have also received the relevant security related information to
allow them to communicate in an ad hoc group communication.
6\. The call initiating MC service client is aware of a suitable preconfigured
ad hoc group whose configuration has been preconfigured in the MC service UEs
who are the participants of the ad hoc group.
Figure 7.2.2.1.1-1: Ad hoc group call setup
1\. The MC service client of authorized user initiates a group call with
multiple users from primary and partner MC systems. A group call request
message with the information of the MC service IDs and the pre-configured ad
hoc group is routed to the MC service server of the primary MC system.
2\. The MC service server of the primary MC system forms the ad hoc group by
using MC service users\' information and the configuration of the
preconfigured ad hoc group received in step 1 and assigns a MC service group
ID for the newly formed ad hoc group. It identifies the appropriate MC service
server responsible for the MC service users of the ad hoc group. The MC
service users are automatically affiliated to the ad hoc group.
NOTE 1: The newly formed ad hoc group information including the MC service
group ID and the list of users is held in dynamic data in the MC service
server.
3\. The MC service server of the primary MC system sends the group call
request to the affiliated group members of the ad hoc group belonging to the
primary MC system.
4\. The MC service clients receive in the group call request the information
of the MC service group ID for the ad hoc group and further notify their
corresponding MC service user. The affiliated group members of the ad hoc
group of the primary MC system may accept or reject the call and respond with
the group call response.
5\. The primary MC service server further initiates a group call request
message to the MC service server of the partner MC system for the ad hoc
group\'s MC service users\' belonging to partner MC system.
6\. Upon receiving the group call request message from the MC service server
of the primary MC system, the MC service server of the partner MC system
initiates a call invitation to its MC service users and sends the group call
request to the MC service users of the partner MC system.
7\. The MC service clients receive in the group call request the information
of the MC service group ID for the ad hoc group and further notify their
corresponding MC service user. The MC service users upon receipt of the
invitation may accept or reject the call, and respond with the group call
response.
8\. The MC service server of the partner MC system provides a group call
response message to the MC service server of the primary MC system with
success or failure result and/or detailed reason information in case of
failure.
9\. The MC service server of the primary MC system provides a group call
response message to the MC service client of the authorized MC service user
upon receiving response to the corresponding group call request with the MC
service server of the partner MC system. The group call response will consist
of the success or failure result and/or detailed reason information in case of
failure. The MC service client 1 receives the MC service group ID assigned for
the ad hoc group via this step.
NOTE 2: The group call response message is triggered depending on the
conditions to proceed with the call.
10\. Upon successful group call setup, a group call is established amongst the
multiple group members from primary and partner MC systems. The media plane
and floor control resources are established.
##### 7.2.2.1.2 Procedure for ad hoc group call release
This procedure focuses on the case where an MC service server initiates the
termination of an ongoing MC service ad hoc group call for all the
participants of that group call, since at least one of the termination
conditions are met e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving,
second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of
affiliated MC service group members are not present.
Procedures in figure 7.2.2.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures for
the MC service server initiating termination of an ongoing MC service ad hoc
group call.
Figure 7.2.2.2-1: Ad hoc group call release
1\. It is assumed that MC service users on MC service client 1, client 2
belonging to primary MC system and client 3 belonging to partner MC system are
already part of the ongoing ad hoc group call (e.g. as a result of ad hoc
group call setup as specified in clause 7.2.2.1.1).
2\. The MC service server would like to release the MC service group call
which is ongoing e.g., due to hang time expiry, last participant leaving,
second last participant leaving, initiator leaving, or minimum number of
affiliated MC service group members are not present.
3\. The MC service server identifies the participants of the ongoing ad hoc
group call and generates group call release request to release ongoing
session.
4\. The MC service server sends a group call release request via SIP core
towards each participant of the ongoing group call. If the participants belong
to partner MC system, then group call release request is sent to the partner
MC service server, which further sends the group call release request to the
MC service clients.
5\. The MC service users are notified about the release of the ad hoc group
call.
6\. The MC service client(s) receiving group call release request, send
acknowledgement towards the MC service server by sending a group call release
response.
7\. The MC service client 1, client 2 and client 3 have successfully released
the floor control and media plane resources associated with the group call
that is terminated. The MC service servers remove the ad hoc group information
from the dynamic data held in the MC service servers and thus the ad hoc group
ceases to exist.

### 7.3.3 Solution Evaluation
This is a viable solution to setup and release an ad hoc group call where the
ad hoc group is created during the group call setup and the ad hoc group is
removed when the group call is released thus the ad hoc group ceases to exist.
This procedure achieves the required performance and security as per the stage
1 requirements for a group call. The group call security is achieved via the
use of a preconfigured ad hoc group information and its group security
information is applied on the ad hoc group call.

### 7.4.3 Procedure
#### 7.4.3.1 Modification of ad hoc group communication participants by the
initiator
Figure 7.4.3.1-1 below illustrates the modification of ad hoc group
communication participants procedure by the initiator of the ad hoc group
communication.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client 1 is the initiator of the ad hoc group
communication.
2\. The MC service users on MC service client 1, MC service client 3 to MC
service client n are on an ongoing ad hoc group communication.
3\. The MC service user 1 requests to remove the user of MC service client 3
from the ad hoc group communication and add user of MC service client 2 into
the on-going ad hoc group communication.
Figure 7.4.3.1-1: Modification of ad hoc group communication participants by
the initiator
1\. The MC service client 1 sends the modify ad hoc group call participants
request to the MC service server inorder to remove MC service client 3 from
the ongoing ad hoc group communication and add MC service client 2 into it.
2\. The MC service server verifies whether the MC service client 1 is
authorized to add or remove(modify) the participants of the on-going ad hoc
group communication.
3\. The MC service server sends the modify ad hoc group communication
participants response to the MC service client 1.
4\. The MC service server sends the ad hoc group call leave request to the MC
service client 3 in order to remove it from the on-going ad hoc group
communication.
5\. The MC service client 3 notifies the user of the ad hoc group call leave
request.
6\. The MC service client 3 sends the ad hoc group call leave response to the
MC service server.
7\. The MC service server removes the MC service client 3 from the ongoing ad
hoc group communication.
8\. MC service client 1 sends AHGC share security material command to the MC
service targeting MC service client 2 containing the security material to be
shared with the MC service client 2 for use in this ad hoc group
communication.
NOTE: Steps 8 to 11 can occur at any time following step 3.
9\. The MC service server sends the ad hoc group communication request towards
MC service client 2.
10\. The receiving MC service client 2 notifies the user about the incoming ad
hoc group communication.
11\. The MC service client 2 accepts the ad hoc group communication request
and send ad hoc group communication responses to the MC service server. The
response may also contain a functional alias of the responding MC service
user, which is verified (valid and activated for the user) by the MC service
server.
12\. The MC service server may notify the initiating MC service user of all
the users who are added to the on-going ad hoc group communication. This
notification may be sent to the initiating MC service user by the MC service
server more than once during the call when MC service users join or leave the
ad hoc group communication.
13\. The MC service server may notify the participants about the change in the
participants list of on-going ad hoc group communication.
#### 7.4.3.2 Modification of ad hoc group communication participants by the MC
service server
Figure 7.4.3.2-1 below illustrates the modification of ad hoc group
communication participants procedure by the MC service server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client 1 is the initiator of the ad hoc group
communication.
2\. MC service server determined the participants for the ad hoc group
communication based on the criteria specified by the MC service client 1 while
initiating the ad hoc group communication.
3\. MC service server continuously evaluates the criteria to monitor the list
of users who meets or not meets the criteria for participating in the on-going
ad hoc group communication.
4\. The MC service server detects that the MC service client 5 satisfies the
criteria and MC service client 4 stops to meet the criteria specified by the
MC service client 1.
Figure 7.4.3.2-1: Modification of ad hoc group communication participants by
the MC service server
1\. The ad hoc group communication is established and on-going with the
participants MC service client 1, MC service client 2, MC service client 3 and
MC service client 4. The participants list is determined by the MC service
server based on the criteria specified by the MC service client 1 while
initiating the communication
2\. The MC service server detects that the MC service client 5 satisfies the
criteria specified by the MC service client.
3\. The MC service server sends the ad hoc group communication request to the
MC service client 5.
4\. The MC service client 5 notifies the user about the incoming ad hoc group
communication.
5\. The MC service client 5 accepts the ad hoc group communication request and
sends the ad hoc group communication response to the MC service server.
6\. The on-going ad hoc group communication is updated by adding MC service
client 5 which satisfies the criteria specified by the MC service client 1.
7\. The MC service server detects that the MC service client 4 is no more
satisfying the criteria to be the participant of the ad hoc group
communication.
8\. The MC service server sends the ad hoc group communication leave request
to the MC service client 4 and removes it from the on-going ad hoc group
communication.
9\. The MC service client 4 notifies the user of the ad hoc group call leave
request.
10\. The MC service client 4 sends the ad hoc group communication leave
response to the MC service server.
11\. The on-going ad hoc group communication is updated by removing MC service
client 4 which no more satisfies the criteria specified by the MC service
client 1.
### 7.4.4 Solution evaluation
The procedures proposed as part of this solution handle the modification of
participants list of the on-going ad hoc group communication. Participants can
either be added to or removed from the on-going ad hoc group communication.
This solution provides a mechanism for the initiator of the ad hoc group
communication to modify the participants list if the list of participants is
provided by the initiator and for the MC service server if the list of
participants for the on-going ad hoc group communication is determined by the
MC service server.
# 8 Overall evaluation
## 8.1 Key issue and solution evaluation
### 8.1.1 Introduction
All the key issues and solutions specified in this technical report are listed
in table 8.1.2-1. It includes the mapping of the key issues (clause 4) to the
solutions (clause 7) and corresponding solution evaluations.
In addition, table 8.1.2-1 lists the impacts to other working groups that will
need consideration during the normative phase.
### 8.1.2 Results

### 8.1.3 Overall evaluation of key issue #1
Key issue #1 is about the Ad hoc group communication, which enables authorized
MCX users to combine a random set of MCX Users into a group communication.
Following open issues are considered during the study :
1\. Procedures for establishing and release of the ad hoc group communication.
2\. Procedures for establishing the ad hoc group communication with end-to-end
encryption support.
3\. Identify whether new information flows are required or existing
information flows can be enhanced to support the ad hoc group communication
set up.
4\. How to support different mechanisms for determining the participants list
for the ad hoc group communication. It could be supplied by the initiator of
the ad hoc group call or determined by the MCX system based on some pre-
defined criteria.
5\. How to support a mechanism for the initiator of an MCX Service ad hoc
group communication to request that the list of participants are updated by
the MCX Service system using a specific pre-defined criteria.
6\. Identify whether any changes are required to the existing MCX functional
architecture for supporting the ad hoc group communication.
Both solution#1 and solution#2 addresses the open issues described above.
Based on solution#1 and solution#2, a harmonized procedure is required to
address the key issue#1. End-to-end encryption support is mandatory for the
AHGC and usage of pre-configured group to achieve end-to-end encryption as
specified in solution #2 will be adapted. New information flows except the
AHGC share security material command described as part of solution #1 will be
used. No architectural updates as specified in open issue 7 are required to
support AHGC.
### 8.1.4 Overall evaluation of key issue #2
Key issue #2 is about the network topology hiding while establishing the ad
hoc group communication. Following open issues are considered :
\- How the group ID used for the ad hoc group communication can be created by
MC service client and managed when establishing the ad hoc group
communication.
\- Whether and how to support the ad hoc group communication without exposing
the network topology.
\- Whether and how to support the ad hoc group communication with dynamically
allocated network resources (such as the MC service server that will host the
communication).
Solution #1 with the option that the network creates the ad hoc group ID for
the AHGC addresses the open issues listed above. This solution provides a
procedure for the MC service server to create the ad hoc group ID and share it
to the MC service clients that needs to be used for the ad hoc group
communication. MC service client is not allowed to create AHGC group ID in
solution #1.This way the MC service client is totally transparent of the
network topology of the MC system domain and no need to create the ad hoc
group ID by itself. As the network is the one selecting which MC service
server to host the AHGC, network resources (the MC service server that hosts
this group communication) can be dynamically allocated based on real-time
information of network resources such as availability and traffic load balance
that can be further specified in the normative work. The mechanism provided in
Solution #1 can serve as basis for the normative work when topology hiding is
required.
### 8.1.5 Overall evaluation of key issue #3
Key issue #3 is about the configuration parameters that are required to be
applied while establishing the ad hoc group communication. Following open
issues are considered :
\- Identify the required system or service level configuration parameters and
document them.
\- Identify the user level configuration parameters and document them.
\- Identify the default parameters to be configured which will be applied when
these parameters are not supplied as part of the ad hoc group communication
request by the initiator.
\- How the MCX server shall be able to determine whether the user is
authorized to initiate ad hoc group communication.
Solution #3 identifies the configuration parameters that are required to
address the open issues listed above and it can serve as basis for the
normative work. There were no default parameters identified which needs to be
configured. These configuration parameters are applied by MC service server
handling AHGC as described in the below table:
Parameter description Details
* * *
Support of ad hoc group call Value of this parameter determines whether ad hoc
group communication is supported or not. MC service server rejects the ad hoc
group communication if the value of this parameter is set to false. Maximum
number of participants allowed to participate in an ad hoc group communication
MC service server rejects the ad hoc group communication request if the number
of participants invited for the call is exceeding the value of this parameter.
Hang timer for ad hoc group communication MC service server terminates the ad
hoc group call if there is no traffic for the time duration specified by this
parameter. Maximum duration for ad hoc group communication This parameter
value determines maximum allowed time duration for the ad hoc group
communication to remain active after which the MC service server will
terminate it. List of preferred voice codecs for ad hoc group call List of
codecs, which can be used by the MC service client in the SDP offer.
Authorised to initiate ad hoc group call MC service server uses this parameter
to check whether the MC service user is authorized to initiate the ad hoc
group call Authorised to participate in ad hoc group call MC service server
uses this parameter to check whether the MC service user is authorized to
participate the ad hoc group call Authorised to initiate emergency ad hoc
group call MC service server uses this parameter to check whether the MC
service user is authorized to initiate the emergency ad hoc group call
Authorised to initiate imminent peril ad hoc group call MC service server uses
this parameter to check whether the MC service user is authorized to initiate
the imminent peril ad hoc group call
Editor\'s note: Any additional parameters related to MCVideo and MCData
services applicable for AHGC is FFS.
### 8.1.6 Overall evaluation of key issue #4
Key issue #4 is related to modification of participants list of on going ad
hoc group communication. Following open issues are considered :
\- Modifying the participants list by the initiator of the ad hoc group
communication when the participants list is provided by the initiator while
establishing the ad hoc group communication.
\- Modifying the participants list by the MC service server when the
participants list is determined by the MC service server.
Solution #4 identifies the information flows and procedures required to
address the open issues listed above and it can service as basis for the
normative work.
