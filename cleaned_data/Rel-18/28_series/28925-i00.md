# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document studies on the potential enhancement of service based
management architecture based on the existing 5G service based management
architecture.
# 2 References

# 4 Issue investigations and potential issue solutions
## 4.1 Issue #1: Scope of specifications
### 4.1.1 Description
#### 4.1.1.1 3GPP TS 28.533
_**3GPP TS 28.533 [2]** (the TS is only valid for 5G and exists in Rel-15, 16
and 17):_
Scope:
There is no limitation in the scope that the TS is only valid for 5G (or
rather not valid for 2G, 3G and legacy 4G.
There are no borders for where the SBMA is valid, which gives some problems
when dealing with external entities governed by other fora, e.g. interfaces
with MANO, towards verticals, other operators etc. All that control is left to
access control, which is not (yet) specified. There is a link with the studies
FS_MNSAC and FS_NSCE.

[21] and 3GPP TS 28.528 [22] are referred, but those TSs are not valid for 5G,
They are used in clause A.4, which is informative.
#### 4.1.1.2 3GPP TS 28.621
_**3GPP TS 28.621 [43]** (the TS is valid for 3G, 4G and 5G and_ is valid for
IRPs only while up to and including Rel-14 but from and including Rel-15 to
and including the current release (Rel-18) it is valid for both IRP and SBMA.
The current 3GPP TS 28.621 [43] has a title which is IRP only while the
content is valid for IRP architecture as well as SBMA. It is not clear which
Stage 1 requirements are applicable for SBMA.
#### 4.1.1.3 3GPP TS 28.622
_**3GPP TS 28.622 [23]** (The TS is valid for 3G, 4G and 5G and is valid for
IRPs only while up to and including Rel‑14 but from and including Rel-15 to
and including the current release (Rel-18) it is valid for both IRP and
SBMA)._
> **The current 3GPP TS 28.622 [23] has following issues** :
A. The current 3GPP TS 28.622 [23] has an IRP only title: \"3rd Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects
Telecommunication management; Generic Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration
Reference Point (IRP) Information Service (IS) (Release 18)\". However, the
specification is applied also for Service Based Management Architecture
(SBMA).
B. Clause 1 Scope: The scope is covering IRP architecture only. No SBMA
description. This is issue is covered in clause 4.1 issue #1.
C. Clause 2 References:
a) A few references are not used. This is issue is covered in clause 4.3 issue
#3.
b) Some referred TSs are IRP only which is not applicable for SBMA
architecture.
D. Clause 3.1 Definitions: There are definitions covering IRP architecture.
However, which definitions are applicable for IRP or SBMA or both are unclear.
E. Clause 4.2 Class diagrams: This clause has mixed IRP and SBMA information.
Some of the information are only applicable for IRP. Some are only applicable
to SBMA. Some are applicable for both SBMA and IRP. The text in this clause is
not clear which part is applicable for which architecture.
F. Clause 4.3 Class definitions:
a) This clause has the same issue as \"Class diagrams\" section. It mixes
class definitions for IPR architecture only, SBMA architecture only, or both.
It is not clear which part is applicable to which architecture.
b) Some classes applicability is not clear enough. The follows are a few
examples only, other classes are not list here:
i) \'EP_RP\' is applicable for both IRP architecture and SBMA architecture.
But it has an SBMA only attribute \"supportedPerfMetricGroups\". The attribute
list becomes very confused.
ii) Another example is that \'ThresholdMonitor\' is defined for SBMA
architecture. But the text does not make it clear if it is (or not) also
applicable for IRP architecture.
G. Clause 4.4 Attribute definitions: This clause has the same issue as \"Class
diagrams\" section. It contains mixed information for IRP only, SBMA only, or
both. It is not clear which part is applicable to which architecture. One
example is in above bullet F.b.
H. Clause 4.5 Common notifications: The description text is applicable for
SBMA only. However, the notifications shall be applicable for both IRP and
SBMA architecture.
#### 4.1.1.4 3GPP TS 28.623
_**3GPP TS 28.623 [44]** (The TS is valid for 3G, 4G and 5G and_ is valid for
IRPs only while up to and including Rel-14 but from and including Rel-15 to
and including the current release (Rel-18) it is valid for both IRP and SBMA
_):_
The title, the scope, the definition, and the Solution Set (SS) definitions of
current 3GPP TS 28.623 [44] are all IRP architecture. However, 3GPP TS 28.623
[44] also contains SBMA IOCs descriptions. It is very hard to understand which
part is applicable to which architecture.
Different solution sets are not consistent among themselves.
#### 4.1.1.5 3GPP TS 28.662
_**3GPP TS 28.662 [52]** (The TS is valid for 3G, 4G and 5G and exists in
Rel-15, 16 and 17):_
_3GPP TS 28.662 [52] is made for IRP architecture, but is applied also for
Service Based Management Architecture, SBMA._
_This NRM would be beneficial to be included in SBMA, but an update is
needed._
### 4.1.2 Potential solutions
#### 4.1.2.1 Solution #1-1 scope of 3GPP TS 28.533
a) Introduce the limitation that the TS is not valid for 2G, 3G and 4G in the
Scope clause.
b) Introduce text that 3GPP TS 28.533 [2] is valid for SBMA.
c) Introduce text that access rights for interfaces are outside the scope for
3GPP TS 28.533 [2] (this is be replaced with a TS number when such a TS is
published).
Also to be discussed whether access rights per external (and internal)
interfaces are to be documented in some way.

## 4.2 Issue #2: Content errors
### 4.2.1 Description
**_3GPP TS 28.533 [2]:_**
Content error:
3GPP TS 32.103 [24] claims that 3GPP TS 28.533 [2] is a \"generic\" TS (in
contrast to \"5G specific\"), yet clause 4.6 is using 5G entities, clauses 5.2
and 5.4 are specifying 3GPP management system interactions with NFV MANO and
NWDAF.
Clause 4.2.2: MnS component type A is said to be generic with regards to
operations and notifications. But is really PM notifications etc. generic?
Clause 6 contains use cases and requirements, which should not be included in
a stage 2 TS.
3GPP TS 28.533 [2] clams to be the architecture TS for SBMA, but it does not
have any boundaries for where it is valid (e.g. is service management and BSS
included?).
Implementation errors:
Clause 6: The requirement tag **REQ-MnSD-FUN-X** has not been given a number.
### 4.2.2 Potential solutions

## 4.4 Issue #4: SBMA supporting management of 5G SA and NSA scenarios
### 4.4.1 Description
#### 4.4.1.1 Analysis of the existing specification capabilities
Service based management architecture (SBMA) and corresponding MnS are
introduced in 5G management architecture in 3GPP TS 28.533 [2], and a
different management reference model (i.e. IRP) had been used to manage the
network before 5G era in 3GPP TS 32.101 [3].
The analysis is based on the following understanding of the existing
specification capabilities:
\- The management mechanism of LTE supports interface IRP and NRM IRP models.
\- The management mechanism of 5G supports MnS which includes MnS component
type A (Operation/Notification), MnS component type B (NRM models) and MnS
component type C (Alarm/Performance information).
\- LTE NRM (with enhancement of YAML or YANG solution set) can be used as MnS
component type B and work together with MnS component type A.
#### 4.4.1.2 Management support for NG-RAN Overall Architecture
As description in 3GPP TS 38.300 [4], an NG-RAN node is either a gNB or an ng-
eNB which are interconnected with each other by means of the Xn interface and
connected with 5GC by means of the NG interface, more specifically to the AMF
by means of the NG-C interface and to the UPF by means of the NG-U interface.
The NG-RAN architecture is introduced in 3GPP TS 38.300 [4], as follows.
Figure 4.4.1.2-1: NG-RAN Overall Architecture
NOTE: The ng-eNB node provides E-UTRA user plane and control plane protocol
terminations towards the UE, and connects via the NG interface to the 5GC.
In order to provide management support for NG-RAN, the 3GPP management system
needs to support the management for gNB, ng-eNB and 5GC. There are potential 2
management options to support, as follows.
##### NG-RAN management Option#1 {#ng-ran-management-option1 .H6}
{width="4.236805555555556in" height="1.1541666666666666in"}
Figure 4.4.1.2-2: NG-RAN management Option#1
In the NG-RAN management Option#1:
\- The gNB management domain provides MnS (including MnS component type A, B
and C) for the management of gNB.
\- The ng-eNB management domain provides IRP (including interface IRP and NRM
IRP) for the management of ng-eNB.
\- The 5GC management domain provides MnS (including MnS component type A, B
and C) for the management of 5GC.
##### NG-RAN management Option#2 {#ng-ran-management-option2 .H6}
{width="4.5055555555555555in" height="1.2291666666666667in"}
Figure 4.4.1.2-3: NG-RAN management Option#2
In the NG-RAN management Option#2:
\- The gNB management domain provides MnS(including MnS component type A, B
and C) for the management of gNB
\- The ng-eNB management domain provides MnS ((including MnS component type A,
B and C) for the management of ng-eNB. In this case, ng-eNB NRM used as MnS
component type B, which means the YAML/YANG solution set for ng-eNB needs to
be provided.
\- The 5GC management domain provides MnS (including MnS component type A, B
and C) for the management of 5GC.
#### 4.4.1.3 Management support for EN-DC Overall Architecture
NG-RAN supports Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity (MR-DC) operation whereby a UE
in RRC_CONNECTED is connected to two different nodes, one providing NR access
and the other one providing either E-UTRA or NR access. One node acts as the
MN and the other as the SN. The MN and SN are connected via a network
interface and at least the MN is connected to the core network (e.g. EPC).
The following figure illustrates the MR-DC with EPC (i.e. EN-DC) architecture
in 3GPP TS 37.340 [5].
Figure 4.4.1.3-1: EN-DC Overall Architecture
NOTE: The en-gNB node provides NR user plane and control plane protocol
terminations towards the UE, and acts as Secondary Node in EN-DC.
In order to provide management support for EN-DC, 3GPP management system needs
to provide the management for en-gNB, eNB and EPC. There are also potential 2
management options to support, as follows.
##### EN-DC management Option#1 {#en-dc-management-option1 .H6}
{width="3.8694444444444445in" height="1.101388888888889in"}
Figure 4.4.1.3-2: EN-DC management option#1
In EN-DC management option#1:
\- The en-gNB management domain provides MnS (including component type A, B
and C) for management of en-gNB.
\- The eNB management domain provides IRP (including interface IRP and NRM
IRP) for the management of eNB.
\- The EPC management domain provides IRP (including interface IRP and NRM
IRP) for the management of EPC.
{width="4.241666666666666in" height="1.1895833333333334in"}
Figure 4.4.1.3-3: EN-DC management Option#2
##### EN-DC management Option#2 {#en-dc-management-option2 .H6}
In EN-DC management option#2:
\- The en-gNB management domain provides MnS (including component type A, B
and C) for management of en-gNB.
\- The eNB management domain provides MnS (including component type A, B and
C) for management of eNB. In this case, eNB NRM used as MnS component type B,
which means the YAML/YANG solution set for eNB NRM needs to be provided.
\- The EPC management domain provides MnS (including component type A, B and
C) for management of EPC. In this case, EPC NRM used as MnS component type B,
which means the YAML/YANG solution set for EPC NRM needs to be provided.
### 4.4.2 Potential solutions #4-1
The above potential 4 management mechanism options described in clause 4.4.1
could be classified as two management options, as follows.
{width="5.5159722222222225in" height="1.2041666666666666in"}
Figure 4.4.2-1: Management Option A and B for 5G SA and NSA
**Option#A (including above NG-RAN management Option#1 and EN-DC management
Option#1)**
\- The legacy nodes (e.g. eNB, ng-eNB and EPC) management domain provides IRP
(including interface IRP and NRM IRP) for the management of legacy nodes.
\- The 5G nodes (e.g. gNB, en-gNB and 5GC) provides MnS (including MnS
component type A, B and C) for the management of 5G nodes.
**Option#B (including above NG-RAN management Option#2 and EN-DC management
Option#2)**
\- The legacy nodes (e.g. eNB, ng-eNB and EPC) management domain provides MnS
(including MnS component type A, B and C) for the management of legacy node.
In this case, legacy node NRM used as MnS component type B, which means the
YAML/YANG solution set for legacy node NRM needs to be provided.
\- The 5G nodes (e.g. gNB, en-gNB and 5GC) provides MnS (including MnS
component type A, B and C) for the management of 5G nodes.
## 4.5 Issue #5: SBMA supporting management architecture and frameworks in
other SDOs
### 4.5.1 Description
There are some relevant works on the architectures and frameworks for
automation of management and orchestration in other Standards Developing
Organizations (SDOs) in industry. This clause provides a brief overview on the
works in the related SDOs.
### 4.5.2 Potential solutions
#### 4.5.2.1 ETSI ISG ZSM
##### 4.5.2.1.1 Introduction
The goal of ETSI ZSM is to enable zero-touch automated network and service
management in a multivendor environment.
As documented in ETSI GS ZSM 002 [6], it provides the ZSM framework reference
architecture as shown in figure 4.5.2.1.1-1 and distributed management and
data services, organized into management domains and integrated via an
integration fabric. The integration fabric is used to enable management
service consumption, communication, and integration with 3rd party management
systems. The cross-domain data service allows data sharing across domains. All
management services provide a set of capabilities for their consumption.
{width="4.740277777777778in" height="5.038194444444445in"}
Figure 4.5.2.1.1-1: ZSM framework reference architecture
In figure 4.5.2.1.1-1, every management domain, as well as the E2E service
management domain, provides a set of ZSM service capabilities by management
functions that expose and/or consume a set of service end-points. The cross-
domain integration fabric facilitates providing capabilities and accessing
end-points cross-domain. Some services are only provided and consumed locally
inside the management domain.
##### 4.5.2.1.2 Potential solutions #5-1
3GPP management service deployment framework based on ZSM framework reference
architecture is captured in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 28.533 [2]. 3GPP SBMA is
aligned with ZSM framework reference architecture.
## 4.6 Issue #6: Software management feature in SBMA for 5G
### 4.6.1 Description
3GPP TS 32.531 [31], 3GPP TS 32.532 [32], 3GPP TS 32.53 3[33] define the
requirements, Information Solution and CORBA solution set for software
management which includes Automated software management and non-automated
software management. 3GPP TS 28.525 [19] and 3GPP TS 28.526 [20] describes the
management aspects for VNF application software (i.e. 3GPP network function
software), which includes reusing the software Management IRP [32] for the
interaction between NM and EM. The management of software for VNF itself is
not defined in 3GPP, which is in the scope of ETSI NFV. Software Management
IRP [32] is applicable for the deployments using IRP Framework, which is not
applicable for the deployments using SBMA.
The 5G management is using the SBMA, so corresponding software management
solution is missing.
### 4.6.2 Potential solutions
Introduce a software management feature in SBMA which can be applicable for 5G
and future network is needed. The management of software for VNF itself is not
included, which is defined by ETSI NFV.
## 4.7 Issue #7: Inventory missing in 5G
### 4.7.1 Description
LTE has specifications about inventory: 3GPP TS 28.631 [34], 3GPP TS 28.632
[35] and 3GPP TS 28.633 [36] that define the requirements, Network Resource
Model Information Service (IS) and Solution Set. 5G does not have anything
similar, even though 5G also consist of software, hardware, network functions
and licences.
The attribute table is not follow the latest template documented in 3GPP TS
32.156 [37], for example, the legal value for \"isReadable\", \"isWritable\",
\"invariant\" and \"isNotifyable\" should be True or False.
### 4.7.2 Potential solutions
_Replace_ 3GPP TS 28.631 [34], 3GPP TS 28.632 [35] and 3GPP TS 28.633 [36]
_with a new 5G TSs for SBMA:_
\- Provide the YANG and YAML solution sets for inventory management NRM in
SBMA.
## 4.8 Issue #8: Use of Models in SBMA
### 4.8.1 Description
**The following existing concepts are related to SBMA:**
\- 3GPP TS 28.533 [2] Management Function: A Management Function (MnF) is a
logical entity playing the roles of MnS consumer and/or MnS producer.
Management Function can be deployed as a separate entity or embedded in
Network Function to provide MnS(s).
{width="3.375in" height="1.6597222222222223in"}
Figure 4.8.1-1: Examples of MnS deployment scenario
\- 3GPP TR 21.905 Network Element: A discrete telecommunications entity which
can be managed over a specific interface e.g. the RNC.
\- 3GPP TS 28.533 [2]/3GPP TS 23.501 [53] Network Function: A 3GPP adopted or
3GPP defined processing function in a network, which has defined functional
behaviour and 3GPP defined interfaces.
**The following IOCs are specified to represent Network Element and Network
Function:**
\- 3GPP TS 28.622 [23] ManagedElement IOC: This IOC represents
telecommunications equipment or TMN entities within the telecommunications
network providing support and/or service to the subscriber. A ManagedElement
IOC is used to represent a Network Element defined in 3GPP TS 32.101 [3]
including virtualization or non-virtualization scenario.
\- 3GPP TS 28.622 [23] ManagedFunction IOC: This IOC is provided for sub-
classing only. It provides attribute(s) that are common to functional IOCs.
Note that a ManagedElement may contain several managed functions, a managed
function may contain other managed functions as specified for the specific
subclass. This IOC can represent a telecommunication function either realized
by software running on dedicated hardware or realized by software running on
NFVI.
**The following IOCs as specified in 3GPP TS 28.622 [23] are used to represent
Management Function provided by MnS Producer:**
\- 3GPP TS 28.622 [23] MnsAgent IOC: The MnsAgent represents the MnS
producers, incl. the supporting hardware and software, available for a certain
management scope that is related to the object name-containing the MnS Agent.
\- 3GPP TS 28.622 [23] ManagementNode IOC: This IOC represents a
telecommunications management system (EM) within the TMN that contains
functionality for managing a number of ManagedElements (MEs).
NOTE: This description is to be updated to replace use of EM.
### 4.8.2 Potential solutions
**This clause provides the description of using NRM to represent management of
management function, network function, and network element.**
**Management Function could be deployed in following different deployment
scenarios:**
\- The Management Function can be deployed in management system, including:
\- The Management Function deployed in domain management system.
\- The Management Function deployed in cross domain management system.
\- The Management Function deployed in Network Element.
**From the three deployment scenarios of Management Functions above.
Management Functions deployed in domain management system and Management
Function deployed in Network Element need to be managed as managing network
node in 3GPP management system. The way of managing the Management Function
are modelled in corresponding management function IOC.**
**ManagementNode IOC represents a telecommunications management system**
within the TMN **provided by vendor** that contains management functionalities
for managing a number of ManagedElements (MEs).
**The Management Functions are managed by corresponding management function
IOC as defined in 3GPP TS 28.541 [46], 3GPP TS 28.104 [47], 3GPP TS 28.105**

## 4.9 Issue #9: Improvement on the management function description
### 4.9.1 Description
The following information is documented in 3GPP TS 32.101 [3] to describe the
TMN architecture aspects and the management functions.
{width="4.604166666666667in" height="3.78125in"}
Analysis:
\- 3GPP TS 32.101 [3] defines the management principles and high-level
requirements for the management of PLMNs. Some descriptions in corresponding
area in clause 7 of 3GPP TS 32.101 [3] can be improved and used for SBMA.
The following management features are captured in annex of 3GPP TS 28.533 [2],
as follows.
{width="6.533125546806649in" height="3.721745406824147in"}
Figure 4.9.1-1: Overview of 5G management specifications
The related management features description in 3GPP TS 28.533 [2] are limited
compared with the management functions description in 3GPP TS 32.101 [3].
### 4.9.2 Potential solutions
#### 4.9.2.1 Management function description
Elaborate the management functional overviews in 3GPP TS 28.533 [2] with
taking into account of the management function description information in 3GPP
TS 32.101 [3] clause 7.
#### 4.9.2.2 Usage of CRUD operations and NRM fragment in SBMA
Following is the overview of usage of CRUD operations and NRM fragments in
SBMA.
If CRUD operations are supported, it is not needed to support the equivalent
non-CRUD operations. (e.g. if CRUD operations for NtfSubscriptionControl IOC
are supported, it is not needed to support subscribe/unsubscribe operations).
NOTE: The usage of non-CRUD operations in the SBMA are not listed in table
4.9.2.2-1 (e.g. Streaming management operations, defined in 3GPP TS 28.532
[45] clause 11.5.1, by Streaming Data Reporting MnS are not-CRUD operations).

#### 4.9.2.3 Notifications supported by management sets in SBMA
TBD
## 4.10 Issue #10: Use of 32.401 in SBMA
### 4.10.1 Description
Concepts and definitions in 3GPP TS 32.401 [38] are used in 3GPP TS 28.552
[27], Therefore 3GPP TS 32.401 [38] is referred to in 3GPP TS 28.552 [27].
3GPP TS 32.401 [38] is written for an IRP architecture, for which it is still
needed. To include SBMA in 3GPP TS 32.401 [38] will be almost duplicating the
specification.
### 4.10.2 Potential solutions
It is proposed to make:
1) a new TS for Performance Management (PM); Concept and requirements; or
2) to include changes into 3GPP TS 28.550 [55];
in a new work item in Rel-18.
## 4.11 Issue #11: Use of 32.404 in SBMA
### 4.11.1 Description
Major issues found:
1) Concepts, definitions and the template in 3GPP TS 32.404 [39] are used in
3GPP TS 28.552 [27], therefore 3GPP TS 32.404 [39] is referred to in 3GPP TS
28.552 [27].
2) Some terms (e.g. IRP and NE) used are not valid in SBMA.
3) Some normative references are only to IRP TSs, e.g. references to 3GPP TS
25.331 [40] and 3GPP TS 25.433 [41].
4) The PM LCM in clause B.5 is different than the CM LCM. It should be
investigated whether they should be aligned/changed.
### 4.11.2 Potential solutions
It is proposed to update 3GPP TS 32.404 [39] in a new work item in Rel-18.
## 4.12 Issue#12: illustration of using MnS in management reference model in
TS 32.101
### 4.12.1 Description
In 3GPP TS 32.101 [3], Clause 5.1 illustrates the management reference model
which shows the Operations Systems interfacing with other systems. An
Operations System supports management interfaces to other systems.
Figure 4.12.1-1: Management reference model
A number of management interfaces in a PLMN are identified in figure 4.12.1-1,
namely:
> 1) between the Network Elements (NEs) and the Element Manager (EM) of a
> single PLMN Organization;
>
> 2) between the Element Manager (EM) and the Network Manager (NM) of a single
> PLMN Organization;
NOTE: In certain cases, the Element Manager functionality may reside in the NE
in which case this interface is directly from NE to Network Manager). These
management interfaces are given the reference name Itf-N and are the primary
target for standardization.
> 3) between the Network Managers and the Enterprise Systems of a single PLMN
> Organization;
>
> 4) between the Network Managers (NMs) of a single PLMN Organization;
>
> 4a) between the Domain Managers (DMs) of a single PLMN Organization;
>
> 5) between Enterprise Systems & Network Managers of different PLMN
> Organizations;
>
> 5a) between the Domain Managers (DMs) of different PLMN Organizations;
>
> 6) between Network Elements (NEs);
>
> 7) between the Network Management Layer Service (NMLS) and the Network
> Manager (NM).
IRPs may be implemented at interfaces 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7.
3GPP TS 28.533 [2] introduces the Service Based Management Architecture
(SBMA). The fundamental building block of the Service Based Management
Architecture (SBMA) is the Management Service (MnS). A MnS is a set of offered
capabilities for management and orchestration of network and services. An MnS
producer offers its services via a standardized service interface composed of
individually specified MnS components (MnS component type A, B, C).
Analysis:
1) In 3GPP TS 32.101 [3], there is clearly showing the entities and the
corresponding interfaces in the management reference model.
2) In 3GPP TS 28.533 [2], the interaction of paradigm of MnS producer and MnS
Consumer is defined without indicating the entities.
3) The entities in 3GPP TS 32.101 [3] can be illustrated using the MnS
consumer and MnS producer according to the way of using interface IRPs.
### 4.12.2 Potential solutions
There are the following aspects to be considered in the solution of using MnS:
1) The management services may be used to support the interoperability in
different management scenarios:
a) Interoperability within Operation system of a single PLMN Organization.
b) Interoperability between BSS and Operation systems within a single PLMN
Organization.
c) Interoperability between BSS of different PLMN Organizations.
d) Interoperability between Operation Systems of different PLMN Organizations.
2) Different set of management services may be used for the interoperability
between different entities.
3) Figure 4.12.2-1 illustrates an example of using management services for
supporting interoperability in a multiple players scenario:

## 4.13 Issue #13: Analysis on IRP specification needs to support SBMA
### 4.13.1 Description
The overview of interface IRP and NRM IRP are illustrated in clause 5 and
clause 6 in 3GPP TS 32.103 [24] as follows:
Figure 4.13.1-1: 3GPP Interface IRPs
Figure 4.13.1-2: 3GPP NRM IRPs
Some interface IPR specifications (e.g. Basic CM IRP, Alarm IRP) have been
developed to corresponding SBMA specifications (e.g. provision MnS, fault
supervision MnS), some NRM IRP specifications (e.g. Generic NRM IRP) are
reused for SBMA, there are still some IRP specifications have note produced
corresponding SBMA specifications.

## 4.14 Issue #14: Providing a usage guide for SBMA series of specifications
### 4.14.1 Description
3GPP TS 32.103 [24] has captured the Telecommunication management; Integration
Reference Point (IRP) overview and usage guide for managing of 2G, UMTS and
LTE network. The usage guide in 3GPP TS 32.1032 [24] is very useful for
external readers to get an overview of how IRP series of specifications.
### 4.14.2 Potential solutions
It is recommended to create a new specification to capture the overview and
usage guide information for SBMA series of specifications.
## 4.15 Issue# 15: Extend 3GPP TS 32.300 to support SBMA
### 4.15.1 Description
3GPP TS 32.300 [42] is written for IRP based architecture, the same level
information is also needed for 5G/SBMA. To extend the support to SBMA, there
are issues which need to be resolved:
1) The scope of the present document is set to IRP, e.g. in clause 1 scope.
2) There are specific references to IRP specifications, e.g. in the
definitions, abbreviations, and clause 7.4 refers to 3GPP TS 32.103 [24] for
IRP, etc.
3) Some contents are limited to IRP scope, e.g. some statements are prefixed
with IRP.
4) There are references to IRP SS, XML.
### 4.15.2 Potential solutions
The following changes are needed to support SBMA:
\- Update the scope to be generic applicable to both IRP and SBMA.
\- Complement the existing reference to IRP specifications, the same level
information shall be extended for SBMA, e.g. clause 7.4 of 3GPP TS 32.103
[24].
\- For the content and statement that are limited to IRP scope, they shall be
lifted to support SBMA. e.g. clauses 4, 5 and 6 of 3GPP TS 32.300 [42].
\- For those specific references to IRP SS, make them to be generic applicable
to both IRP and SBMA. e.g. clauses 6 and 7 of 3GPP TS 32.300 [42].

_As a maintenance CR._
## 5.4 Issue #4 SBMA supporting management of 5G SA and NSA scenarios
Two management options are identified for 5G SA and NSA in clause 4.4.2.
It is recommended that the NG-RAN management Option#2 is to be supported by
specifying YANG and YAML solution sets in a new TS. It may be an own stage 3
TS or included in the stage 2 TS.
## 5.5 Issue #5: SBMA supporting management architecture and frameworks in
other SDOs
3GPP SBMA is aligned with ZSM framework reference architecture, and related
description is captured in 3GPP TS 28.533 [2]. No further modification is
needed to existing specifications.
## 5.6 Issue #6: Software management feature in SBMA for 5G
The SBMA software management solution is not addressed in the present document
due to lack of requirements.
## 5.7 Issue #7 Inventory missing in 5G

3GPP TS 32.101
A MnS is a set of offered capabilities for management and orchestration of
network and services, SBMA provides the following flexibility:
1) SBMA does not limit who can play the role of an MnS consumer. Any entities
consume SA5 defined MnS are called MnF.
2) Depending on different scenarios, an entity either plays the role as MnS
producers or as MnS consumers.
_It is recommended to add examples of using MnS in different scenarios to
illustrate the flexibility of Service Based Management Architecture (SBMA)._
