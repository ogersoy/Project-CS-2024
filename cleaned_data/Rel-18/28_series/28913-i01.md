# 4 Key Issues and potential solutions
## 4.1 Key Issue #1: Considering additional virtual resources usage to
estimate VNF energy consumption
### 4.1.1 Description
In Release 17 (see [2] clause 6.7.3.1), the Energy Consumption (EC) of VNFs is
obtained by summing up the estimated energy consumption of its constituent
Virtualized Network Function Components (VNFC), where the estimated energy
consumption of a VNFC is obtained by taking the estimated energy consumption
of the virtual compute resource instance on which the VNFC runs. The energy
consumption of a virtual compute resource instance X is estimated as a
proportion of the energy consumption of the NFVI node on which the virtual
compute resource instance X runs. This proportion is obtained by dividing the
vCPU mean usage of the virtual compute resource instance X, by the sum of the
vCPU mean usage of all virtual compute resource instances running on the same
NFVI Node as X, during the same observation period.
This key issue investigates how additional performance measurements of virtual
compute resources, also provided by NFV MANO, can be considered in the
estimation of the energy consumption of VNFCs, and consequently of VNFs.
### 4.1.2 Potential solutions
#### 4.1.2.1 Potential solution #1: Estimated virtual compute resource
instance energy consumption based on mean vCPU and vDisk usage
##### 4.1.2.1.1 Introduction {#introduction-1}
In this potential solution #1, it is proposed to consider the mean virtual
disk usage of the virtualised compute resource instance, in addition to the
mean vCPU usage, to estimate the energy consumed by the virtual compute
resource instance. Thus, the definition of the estimated energy consumption of
a virtual compute resource instance combines both virtual CPU mean usage and
virtual disk mean usage.
##### 4.1.2.1.2 Description
In this potential solution #1, the energy consumption of a virtual compute
resource instance X is estimated as a proportion of the energy consumption of
the NFVI node on which the virtual compute resource runs. This proportion is
obtained by multiplying relative mean virtual CPU usage and virtual disk usage
of the virtual compute resource instance X. The relative mean virtual CPU
usage of the virtual compute resource instance X is obtained by dividing the
vCPU mean usage of the virtual compute resource instance X, by the sum of the
vCPU mean usage of all virtual compute resource instances running on the same
NFVI Node as X, The relative mean virtual disk usage of the virtual compute
resource instance X is obtained by dividing the vDisk mean usage of the
virtual compute resource instance X, by the sum of the vDisk mean usage of all
virtual compute resource instances running on the same NFVI Node as X. This is
defined by the equation below:
{width="6.695138888888889in" height="0.5189971566054243in"}
where:
\- VCpuUsageMean is the mean virtual CPU usage of the virtual compute resource
instance during the observation period, provided by NFV MANO;
\- {width="1.9166666666666667in" height="0.4166666666666667in"} is the sum of
the mean virtual CPU usage of all virtual compute resource instances running
on the same NFVI Node during the same observation period, all separately
provided by NFV MANO (see clause 7.1.2 of [3];
\- VDiskUsageMean is the mean virtual disk usage of the virtual compute
resource instance during the observation period, provided by NFV MANO;
\- {width="1.9270833333333333in" height="0.40625in"}is the sum of the mean
virtual disk usage of all virtual compute resource instances running on the
same NFVI Node during the same observation period, all separately provided by
NFV MANO (see clause 7.1.6 of [3];
\- EC~NFVINode,measured~ is the measured energy consumption of the NFVI node
on which the virtual compute resource instance runs, during the same
observation period, as per ETSI ES 202 336-12 [4];
#### 4.1.2.2 Potential solution #2: Estimated virtual compute resource
instance energy consumption based on mean vDisk usage
##### 4.1.2.2.1 Introduction {#introduction-2}
In this potential solution #2, it is proposed to consider the mean virtual
disk usage of the virtualised compute resource instance only.
##### 4.1.2.2.2 Description
In this potential solution, the energy consumption of a virtual compute
resource X is estimated as a proportion of the energy consumption of the NFVI
node on which the virtual compute resource runs, this proportion being
obtained by dividing the vDisk mean usage of the virtual compute resource X,
by the sum of the vDisk mean usage of all virtual compute resources running on
the same NFVI Node as X, as defined by the equation below:
{width="5.038888888888889in" height="0.548584864391951in"}
where:
\- VDiskUsageMean is the mean vDisk usage of the virtual compute resource
during the observation period, provided by NFV MANO;
\- {width="1.8055555555555556in" height="0.26540463692038496in"} is the sum of
the vDisk mean usage of all virtual compute resources running on the same NFVI
Node during the same observation period, all separately provided by NFV MANO
(see clause 7.1.6 of [3];
\- EC~NFVINode,measured~ is the measured energy consumption of the NFVI node
on which the virtual compute resource runs, during the same observation
period, as per ETSI ES 202 336-12 [4].
#### 4.1.2.3 Potential solution #3: Consideration of four types of metrics
provided by NFV MANO
##### 4.1.2.3.1 Introduction {#introduction-3}
In this potential solution #3, it is proposed to consider four types of
metrics related to virtualized compute resources which can be provided by ETSI
NFV MANO:
# Mean virtual CPU usage of the virtualized compute resource (see clause 7.1.2
of [3]);
# Mean memory usage of the virtualized compute resource (see clause 7.1.4 of
[3]);
# Mean disk usage of the virtualized compute resource (see clause 7.1.6 of
[3]);
# I/O traffic of the virtualized compute resource, measured by the sum of the
number of incoming bytes on virtual compute (see clause 7.1.8 of [3]) and the
number of outgoing bytes on virtual compute (see clause 7.1.9 of [3]).
Thus, four separate definitions of the estimated energy consumption of a
virtualized compute resource are proposed, based on the four aforementioned
measurements.
Which of these four KPIs is to be used for estimating the energy consumed by
different virtualized compute resources is not subject to standardization and
is left to operators\' decision.
##### 4.1.2.3.2 Description
##### 4.1.2.3.2.0 General {#general .H6}
In this potential solution #3, the energy consumption of a virtualized compute
resource X is estimated as a proportion of the energy consumption of the NFVI
node on which the virtualized compute resource runs.
This proportion is obtained by considering either:
\- the relative mean virtual CPU usage, or
\- the relative mean virtual memory usage, or
\- the relative mean virtual disk usage, or
\- the relative incoming/outgoing traffic volume of the virtual compute
resource instance X.
The relative mean virtual CPU usage of a virtual compute resource instance X
is obtained by dividing the vCPU mean usage of the virtual compute resource
instance X, by the sum of the vCPU mean usage of all virtual compute resource
instances running on the same NFVI node as X.
The relative mean memory usage of a virtual compute resource instance X is
obtained by dividing the mean memory usage of the virtual compute resource
instance X, by the sum of the mean memory usage of all virtual compute
resource instances running on the same NFVI node as X.
The relative mean disk usage of a virtual compute resource instance X is
obtained by dividing the mean disk usage of the virtual compute resource
instance X, by the sum of the mean disk usage of all virtual compute resource
instances running on the same NFVI node as X.
The relative incoming/outgoing traffic volume of a virtual compute resource
instance X is obtained by dividing the incoming/outgoing traffic volume of the
virtual compute resource instance X, by the sum of the incoming/outgoing
traffic volume of all virtual compute resource instances running on the same
NFVI node as X.

### 4.1.3 Conclusion - Recommendation
The potential solution #3 for considering additional virtual resources usage
to estimate virtual compute resource instance energy consumption is proposed
to be introduced in the normative specification TS 28.554 [2].
## 4.2 Key Issue #2: Energy Consumption of containerized VNF/VNFCs
### 4.2.1 Description
The Rel-17 definition of the Energy Consumption (EC) of VNF/VNFCs (see TS
28.554 [2] -- clauses 6.7.3.1.2 and 6.7.3.1.3) is valid for VM-based VNFs,
i.e. when VNF/VNFC(s) are implemented on Virtual Machine(s) (VM).
ETSI ISG NFV started considering that VNF/VNFCs can be implemented using OS
container technology (see e.g. [5] and [6]).
In the context of this key issue, a VNF (respectively VNFC) running using OS
container technology is called a \'containerized VNF\' (resp. \'containerized
VNFC\'), as per ETSI GR NFV-IFA 029 [6] clause 5.3.1.
This key issue aims at investigating on potential definition(s) of EC for
containerized VNF/VNFCs.
### 4.2.2 Conclusion
There is no potential solution to key issue #2 in this version of the present
document.
## 4.3 Key Issue #3: Energy Consumption of RAN nodes
### 4.3.1 Description
In TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.7.3.4.2, the Energy Consumption (EC) of a gNB is
defined as the sum of the Energy Consumption of all the Network Functions (NF)
that constitute the gNB, with no definition of what these NFs can be.
Therefore, the definition of the EC of a gNB, as specified in TS 28.554 [2]
clause 6.7.3.4.2, can lead to different interpretations, especially in case of
gNB split architecture.
This key issue investigates how to apply the definition of the EC of a gNB as
specified in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.7.3.4.2 to various gNB split
architectures. The case of non-split gNB is already covered by the existing
definition in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.7.3.4.2.
### 4.3.2 Potential solutions
#### 4.3.2.1 Potential solution #1: Consider that \'one logical node = one
Network Function\'
##### 4.3.2.1.1 Introduction {#introduction-4}
In this potential solution #1, it is proposed to consider every single
\'logical node\' (cf. TS 38.401 [8] clause 3.1) within gNBs as a Network
Function (NF) and that, therefore, the EC of the gNB is the sum of the EC of
all its contained logical nodes / NFs, as per TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.7.3.4.2.
##### 4.3.2.1.2 Description
In TS 38.300 [7] clause 3.2, a gNB is defined as a \'node\' providing NR user
plane and control plane protocol terminations towards the UE, and connected
via the NG interface to the 5GC.
In TS 38.401 [8] clause 3.1, gNB-CU, gNB-DU, gNB-CU-CP and gNB-CU-UP are
defined as \'logical nodes\' within the gNB.
In this potential solution #1, considering every single \'logical node\' (cf.
TS 38.401 [8] clause 3.1) within split-gNBs as a Network Function (NF), the EC
of a split-gNB is equal to the sum of the EC of all contained gNB-CU(s), gNB-
DU(s), gNB-CU-CP(s) (if any), gNB-CU-UP(s) (if any). As any other NFs, gNB-
CU(s), gNB-DU(s), gNB-CU-CP(s) and gNB-CU-UP(s) can be composed of PNFs and/or
VNFs.
### 4.3.3 Conclusion
In case of split gNBs, the potential solution #1 is not completely described
in this version of the present document.
## 4.4 Key Issue #4: EE KPI for V2X network slice
### 4.4.1 Description
TS 28.554 [2] -- clause 6.7.2 provides definitions of EE KPIs for networks
slices of the following types: eMBB, URLLC and MIoT. There is no EE KPI
definition for V2X network slices.
This key issue aims at investigating on potential definition(s) of the EE of
V2X network slices.
As stated in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.7.2.1, the generic network slice EE KPI is
defined by the \'Performance of the network slice\' (P~ns~) divided by the
\'Energy Consumption of the network slice\' (EC~ns~). Potential solutions in
the following sub-clause(s) have to concentrate on definition(s) of P~ns~ for
V2X network slices.
### 4.4.2 Potential solutions
#### 4.4.2.1 Potential solution #1: Consider V2X as a sub-case of URLLC
##### 4.4.2.1.1 Introduction {#introduction-5}
TS 22.186 [17] clause 4.1 states that different V2X scenarios require the
transport of V2X messages with different performance requirements for the 3GPP
system.
TS 22.186 [17] clause 5 specifies service requirements for V2X scenarios in
the six following areas:
# General Aspects: interworking, communication-related requirements valid for
all V2X scenarios
# Vehicles Platooning
# Advanced Driving
# Extended Sensors
# Remote Driving
# Vehicle quality of service Support.
Though not all V2X scenarios have exactly the same performance requirements,
they all have stringent requirements with regard to latency and reliability,
similarly to URLLC scenarios. For this reason, in this potential solution #1,
it is proposed to consider V2X as a sub-case of URLLC.
##### 4.4.2.1.2 Description
In this potential solution #1, given that:
\- V2X scenarios have performance requirements with regard to latency and
reliability in the same range as URLLC,
\- EE KPIs for URLLC network slices are already defined in TS 28.554 [2]
clause 6.7.2.3,
It is proposed to consider that already defined EE KPIs for URLLC network
slices (cf. TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.7.2.3) may also apply to V2X network
slices.
Therefore, there is no need to define additional EE KPI(s) for V2X network
slices.
### 4.4.3 Conclusion
There is one potential solution in this version of the present document,
proposing to consider that already defined EE KPIs for URLLC network slices
(cf. TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.7.2.3) may also apply to V2X network slices.
## 4.5 Key Issue #5: Customer accepts QoS degradation to save energy
### 4.5.1 Description
Nowadays, most companies are expecting to reduce their Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
emissions. GHG emissions are categorized into Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3
emissions (see [9]). In a nutshell:
# Scope 1 - Direct GHG emissions, i.e. direct GHG emissions occurring from
sources that are owned or controlled by the company; for example, emissions
produced by the company\'s own facilities and vehicles
# Scope 2 - Electricity indirect GHG emissions, i.e. GHG emissions from the
generation of purchased electricity consumed by the company
# Scope 3 - Other indirect GHG emissions, i.e. emissions which are a
consequence of the activities of the company, but occur from sources not owned
or controlled by the company.
Some companies, like e.g. large IT or consulting companies, have relatively
little Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Most of their emissions would come from
Scope 3. Part of their Scope 3 emissions could come from the telecommunication
services they use.
Sometimes, under the pressure of their stakeholders, these companies (playing,
in the context of this key issue, the role of NSC) may be willing to cooperate
with their providers (in general) to reduce their Scope 3 emissions. In the
context of the network slice(s) they get from their Network Slice Provider(s)
(NSP), they could decide to accept some limited QoS degradation from their
NSP(s), provided:
a) they can specify which QoS limitation they are ready to accept
b) related energy savings can be measured and reported to them.
Optionally, price reductions may also be negotiated between NSCs and NSPs,
corresponding to the commonly agreed limited QoS degradation. This is out of
scope of SA5.
In TS 28.541, the ServiceProfile data type contains the attribute
\'energyEfficiency\', enabling the NSC to express his requirement with respect
to the energy efficiency level of the network slice being ordered. However,
there is no means for the NSC to mention that he would accept some limited QoS
degradation. Limited QoS degradation could be expressed according to various
dimensions:
# The \'what\': the NSC may be capable and willing to express that he accepts
e.g. degraded bandwidth and/or latency and/or number of simultaneously
connected UEs, etc.;
# The \'how much\': the NSC may be capable and willing to express that he
accepts e.g. a 10 % QoS degradation, a 50 % QoS degradation, etc.;
# The \'when\': the NSC may be willing to express when he accepts some time-
limited QoS degradation, e.g. dates, time slots, punctual (e.g. on identified
labour days) / recurrent (e.g. all Saturdays and Sundays of the year), etc.;
# The \'where\': the NSC may be willing to express where he accepts some
space-limited QoS degradation, e.g. in country X, in city Y, etc.
This key issue aims at investigating how NSCs could express their requirements
for acceptable QoS degradation, for sake of reduction of their Scope 3
emissions via network energy savings.
In return, such NSCs should be able to receive, from their NSPs, information
about actual Energy Consumption (EC) savings attributable to their decision to
accept limited QoS degradation.

present document.
## 4.6 Key Issue #6: Energy Efficiency KPI of URLLC Network Slice based on its
Reliability
### 4.6.1 Description
#### 4.6.1.1 Introduction {#introduction-6}
Performance of a URLLC network slice can be its latency and reliability. The
lower the latency or higher the reliability of a URLLC network slice is, the
higher its performance is. However, existing standardised solution (TS 28.554
[2], clause 6.7.2.3), determines Energy Efficiency (EE) for a URLLC slice only
based on Latency performance, reliability performance is not considered.
Reliability performance is also an integral part of URLLC slice by nature.
A CSP/NOP may want to assess Energy Efficiency (EE) KPI with respect to
\"reliability\" of a URLLC Network Slice (NS) that is being used for
communication services requiring very high reliability, such as
Cloud/Edge/Split Rendering, Gaming or Interactive Data Exchanging, wireless
road-side infrastructure backhaul etc. Reliability is a very important
performance metric for such use cases.
A CSP/NOP providing such crucial services, would like to check its URLLC
slice\'s EE with respect to reliability in addition to latency so that a more
comprehensive and useful energy efficiency KPI can be determined.
Hence, it is important that a variant of Energy Efficiency KPI should also
consider reliability performance of a URLLC slice for comprehensive assessment
of EE.
#### 4.6.1.2 Potential requirements
**REQ-EURLC-FUN-y1** The 3GPP management system should have the capability to
determine Energy Efficiency KPI of a URLLC Network Slice based on its
reliability.
### 4.6.2 Potential Solutions
#### 4.6.2.1 Potential solution #1: Energy Efficiency KPI of URLLC Network
Slice based on its Reliability when Reliability is in terms of PSR%
##### 4.6.2.1.1 Introduction {#introduction-7}
This potential solution focuses on the \'Ultra Reliable\' (UR) characteristic
of the URLLC network slice. The solution considers reliability of Network
Slice as \"percentage of successfully delivered packets within a time
constraint\" as defined in TS 22.261 [15] and TS 22.289 [16]. This enables
CSPs/NOPs to have a robust and complete view of its URLLC slice\'s EE KPI. The
solution involves dividing the Reliability Performance of URLLC slice (based
on percentage of successfully delivered packets within a time constraint) by
the total amount of energy consumption of the URLLC slice in same time period.
##### 4.6.2.1.2 Description
Energy Efficiency KPI of a URLLC network slice based on its reliability
performance is represented as EE~URLLC,Reliability~. Since generic EE KPI
formula of a slice is the ratio of Performance of network slice to the Energy
Consumption of network slice hence EE~URLLC,Reliability~ is given as below:
{width="4.160416666666666in" height="0.4465277777777778in"}
Equation 1
where P~NS~ is the performance of a network slice. For a URLLC slice it can be
both latency and reliability. Since the proposed solution is to establish EE
KPI with respect to its reliability, thus here, performance of Network Slice
is in terms of its reliability and hence P~NS~ is actually denoted as
P~URLLC,Reliability~. EC~NS~ is the Energy Consumption of the whole slice as
specified in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.7.3.3.
Reliability performance of URLLC slice i.e. P~URLLC,Reliability~ can be judged
by \"Packet Success Rate percentage\" (PSR%). The definition of reliability in
TS 22.261 [15] says \"Reliability is defined in the context of network layer
packet transmissions, as percentage value of the packets successfully
delivered to a given system entity within the time constraint required by the
targeted service out of all the packets transmitted.\".
So, in this case, P~URLLC,Reliability~ is denoted by P~URLLC,Reliability,PSR~
and is defined as:
{width="2.5625in" height="0.4583333333333333in"}
Equation 2
where:
# PSR% is Packet Success Rate percentage and is calculated over different
interfaces and direction (UL/DL) as explained below;
# X is the total number of bits of packets sent over an interface in a URLLC
slice, within the considered time frame T~1~.
It can be obtained by the measurements defined in clauses 5.4.1.4 &
5.1.2.1.2.1 of TS 28.552 for DL and UL respectively.
Note: Measurement from clause 5.4.1.4 needs to be multiplied by 8.
If P~URLLC,Reliability,PSR~ is divided by Energy Consumption of network slice
(EC~NS~), then EE KPI i.e. EE~URLLC,Reliability~ is obtained~.~ It tells that
\"with an evaluated reliability (PSR%), how many packets can be successfully
sent per Joule of energy in a URLLC slice in a given time frame constraint\".
So, in this case, EE KPI is given by:
{width="3.0138090551181103in" height="0.5707742782152231in"}
Equation 3
Specifically, EE KPI in DL and UL is given by equations 4 and 5 as below:
{width="2.8341754155730534in" height="0.36911964129483815in"}
Equation 4
{width="2.7434120734908136in" height="0.3657534995625547in"}
Equation 5
P~URLLC,Reliability,PSR~ can be calculated independently for DL and UL
directions. With PSR% based approach the EE~URLLC,Reliability~ of a URLLC
slice has the unit of bits per Joule. EE~URLLC,Reliability~ can be calculated
per interface and per DL and UL direction.
Throughout the slice, the same or different PSR% might exist on different
interfaces.
# If it is same, the PSR % (reliability) of a slice can be calculated at any
one segment of network i.e. between UE and gNB or between gNB and UPF.
# In case, if it is not same, the implementations may choose to calculate the
PSR% of a URLLC slice at any interface deemed appropriate for the operator
e.g. N3 or if end to end PSR% reliability is required, then it can consider
combined (multiplied) PSR% reliability of all the interfaces together.
Following are the possible options and related calculations:
# **Reliability calculation for uplink over Uu interface** \--
P~URLLC,Reliability,PSR~ is obtained for Uu interface by using PSR% calculated
in equation below:
PSR~UL,Uu~ = ULRelPSR_Uu.SNSSAI
Equation 6
where PSR~UL,Uu~ is equal to ULRelPSR_Uu.SNSSAI which is PSR% in UL for Uu
interface per SNSSAI as defined in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.8.1.2.
**# Reliability calculation for downlink over Uu interface** :
P~URLLC,Reliability,PSR~ is obtained for Uu interface by using corresponding
PSR% as calculated in equation below.
PSR~DL,Uu~ = DLRelPSR_Uu.SNSSAI
Equation 7
$S\left( T1,drbid \right)\text{.SNSSAI~}$
where PSR~DL,Uu~ is equal to DLRelPSR_Uu.SNSSAI which is PSR% in DL for Uu
interface per SNSSAI as defined in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.8.1.1.
**# Reliability calculation over N3 interface in uplink** :
P~URLLC,Reliability,PSR~ is obtained for N3 interface by using PSR% calculated
in equation below. It is based on number of GTP data packets measurement.
PSR~UL,N3~ = ULRelPSR_N3.SNSSAI
Equation 8
where PSR~UL,N3~ is equal to ULRelPSR_N3.SNSSAI which is PSR% in UL for N3
interface per SNSSAI as defined in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.8.1.4.
**# Reliability calculation over N3 interface in downlink** :
P~URLLC,Reliability,PSR~ is obtained for N3 interface by using PSR% calculated
in equation below. It is based on number of GTP data packets measurement.
PSR~DL,N3~ = DLRelPSR_N3.SNSSAI
Equation 9
where PSR~DL,N3~ is equal to DLRelPSR_N3.SNSSAI which is PSR% in DL for N3
interface per SNSSAI as defined in TS 28.554 [2] clause 6.8.1.3.
So,
# end to end PSR% Reliability in UL = PSR~UL,Uu~ × PSR~UL,N3~
# end to end PSR% Reliability in DL = PSR~DL,Uu~ × PSR~DL,N3~
These end to end PSR% values in DL and UL will be fed in equation 2.
Accordingly, equations 4 and 5 will provide Energy efficiency value for URLLC
network slice in DL and UL respectively.
#### 4.6.2.2 Potential solution #2: Energy Efficiency KPI of URLLC Network
Slice based on reliability
##### 4.6.2.2.1 Introduction {#introduction-8}
In this potential solution #2, it is proposed to define a variant of Energy
Efficiency KPI that considers reliability performance of a URLLC slice for
comprehensive assessment of EE. Specifically, some of KPI and parameters refer
to definitions in TS 28.554 [2].
##### 4.6.2.2.2 Description
a) A KPI that shows the energy efficiency of network slices of type URLLC
based on reliability. The P~ns~ for a network slice of type URLLC is the
multiplication of downlink packet transmission reliability and uplink packet
transmission reliability of the network slice [2]. In this KPI variant,
reliability is the factor considered for evaluating the performance of network
slice.
b)
$$P_{\text{URLLC},\ \text{Reliability}} = \text{Network}\ \text{slice}\
\text{DL}\ \text{reliabili}ty*\text{Network}\ \text{slice}\ \text{UL}\
\text{reliability}$$
where
# \'Network slice DL reliability\' is defined as the downlink packet
transmission reliability of the network slice, and where the downlink packet
transmission reliability of the network slice for one S-NSSAI is defined by:
$$Network\ slice\ DL\ reliability = \frac{DLRelPSR_
Uu.SNSSAI}{100}*\frac{DLRelPSR_ N3.SNSSAI}{100}$$
where $DLRelPSR_ Uu.SNSSAI$ and $DLRelPSR_ N3.SNSSAI$ are defined according to
clause 6.8.1 in TS 28.554 [2].
# \'Network slice UL reliability\' is defined as the uplink packet
transmission reliability of the network slice, and where the uplink packet
transmission reliability of the network slice for one S-NSSAI is defined by:
$$Network\ slice\ UL\ reliability = \frac{ULRelPSR_
Uu.SNSSAI}{100}*\frac{ULRelPSR_ N3.SNSSAI}{100}$$
where $ULRelPSR_ Uu.SNSSAI$ and $ULRelPSR_ N3.SNSSAI$ are defined according to
clause 6.8.1 in TS 28.554[2].
Besides, URLLC Performance management on reliability in RAN has been discussed
in the Study on management aspects of URLLC, and the discussion results would
be considered if needed.
The unit of this KPI is percentage per Joule.
c)
$$\text{EE}_{\text{URLLC},\text{Reliability}} = \frac{\text{Network}\
\text{slice}\ \text{DL}\ \text{reliability}*\text{Network}\ \text{slice}\
\text{UL}\ \text{reliability}}{EC_{\text{ns}}}$$
d) The KPI object is network slice.
### 4.6.3 Conclusion
The solutions are feasible as they are based on the generic Network Slice
Energy Efficiency (EE) KPI formula defined in TS 28.554 [2]. For this, they
determine performance of URLLC slice in terms of reliability by using already
defined Reliability KPI of TS 28.554 [2] and for Energy consumption of network
slice they use already defined formula in TS 28.554 [2]. Solutions provide
Energy Efficiency of URLLC network slice based on reliability.
### 4.6.4 Recommendation
Based on the conclusion in clause 4.6.3, it is proposed to introduce one
single solution based on the potential solutions #1 and #2 into normative
specification TS 28.554 [2].
## 4.7 Issue #7: Roles involved in EE KPI building
### 4.7.1 Description
Building EE KPIs (see TS 28.554 [2] -- clause 6.7 requires collecting
measurements from various entities. These entities may be or not under the
responsibility of various stakeholders.\ TS 28.530 [10] clause 4.8 describes
roles, and interactions between them, involved in 5G networks and network
slicing management.
This issue aims at investigating, based on different use cases, which roles
are involved in the collection of required measurements and in building EE
KPIs, and the interactions between them.
In all use cases, the Network Operator (NOP) is involved.

on which the VNF/VNFCs supporting the NOP 5GC NFs run. These PEE parameters
are defined in TS 28.552 [11] clause 5.1.1.19;
2) sends them to the VISP via the interface between the VISP and the DCSP.
### 4.7.3 Conclusion
The above use cases illustrate situations in which different roles, i.e. not
only the NOP, are involved in the collection of required measurements and in
building EE KPIs, and show the interactions between these roles.
Further investigations on these use cases may be needed.
## 4.8 Key Issue #8: Energy Saving compensation procedure
### 4.8.1 Description
#### 4.8.1.1 Introduction {#introduction-14}
_The energy saving procedures described in TS 28.310 [13] clause 6.2 do not
specify the impact on the candidate cell(s) when energy saving is activated in
the_ capacity booster cell in 5G. The concept of ES compensation and
compensating for energy saving state are described in TS 32.551 [14] for the
legacy technologies. This key issue is to study potential solutions for the
concepts of ES compensation for 5G.
#### 4.8.1.2 Potential requirements
**REQ-ESCOL-FUN-y1** The Domain-centralized ES shall support a capability to
initiate energy saving compensation activation to one or multiple cells.
**REQ-ESCOL-FUN-y2** The Domain-centralized ES shall support a capability to
initiate energy saving compensation deactivation to one or multiple cells.
**REQ-ESCOL-FUN-y3** The distributed ES function shall support a capability to
initiate energy saving compensation activation to one or multiple cells.
**REQ-ESCOL-FUN-y4** The distributed ES function shall support a capability to
initiate energy saving compensation deactivation to one or multiple cells.
### 4.8.2 Potential solutions
#### 4.8.2.1 Potential solution #1: Energy saving compensation activation and
deactivation procedures
##### 4.8.2.1.1 Introduction {#introduction-15}
The MnS producer for Domain-centralized ES or the distributed ES function,
that makes a decision for the NR capacity booster cell to enter or exit
energySaving state, should be able to initiate energy saving compensation
activation and/or deactivation on one or multiple cells.
##### 4.8.2.1.2 Description
For the energy saving use cases (refer to TS 28.310 [13], clause 5.1.3), when
a NR capacity booster cell enters energySaving state, then the _candidate
cell(s)_ may transition to the:
\- compensatingForEnergySaving.
Correspondingly, the use cases support the following procedures:
\- Energy saving compensation activation: the procedure to increase the
coverage area for the candidate cell(s).
\- Energy saving compensation deactivation: the procedure to decrease a
previously increased coverage area.
### 4.8.3 Conclusion - Impact on normative work
The potential requirements and solution proposed by potential solution #1 for
Energy saving compensation procedure for the 5G are proposed to be introduced
in the normative specification TS 28.310 [13].
## 4.9 Key Issue #9: RAN energy saving when using backup batteries
### 4.9.1 Description
#### 4.9.1.1 Introduction {#introduction-16}
When RAN faces main power failure, it is supported by backup batteries to
prolong the service. However, due to cost and deployment space considerations,
batteries may have insufficient lifespan. As a result, the period of service
time supported by backup batteries may not meet demand, but may be extended by
RAN energy saving actions.
RAN energy saving achieved by executing energy saving actions is especially
crucial when using backup batteries, and satisfy the following requirements:
# energy saving requirement: the period of time batteries can provide service
needs to be maximized, which needs the help of RAN energy saving;
# QoS requirement: the influence on QoS should also be considered when taking
energy saving actions.
Hence, when using backup batteries, it is much important to manage energy
saving actions to balance the energy saving requirement and the QoS
requirement. For example, 3GPP Management System could manage the energy
saving actions sent to gNB according to the backup batteries situation and the
QoS requirement.

Figure 4.9.1-1: gNB and backup batteries
#### 4.9.1.2 Potential requirements
REQ-ES_BB-1: The 3GPP management system should be able to monitor the state of
charge and discharge of backup batteries of gNBs, i.e. it should be able to
know the UPS battery capacity at any time.
REQ-ES_BB-2: The 3GPP management system should be able to monitor the state of
the main power supply of gNBs.
### 4.9.2 Potential solutions
#### 4.9.2.1 Potential solution #1: based on information of backup batteries
as per ETSI ES 202 336-11 [18]
##### 4.9.2.1.1 Introduction {#introduction-17}
This potential solution relies partly on ETSI ES 202 336-11 [18] which
defines:
# monitored and controlled battery system architectures;
# the information exchanged between a battery system (in a telecom site) and a
remote management application.
##### 4.9.2.1.2 Description
Clause 4 of ETSI ES 202 336-11 [18] lists the information that can be
monitored and controlled via the interface between the battery system and the
remote management application:
\- State of Charge (SoC) for each Integrated Battery System (IBS -- see
definition in ETSI ES 202 336-11 [18] clause 3.1).
Annex A (respectively annex B) of ETSI ES 202 336-11 [18] provides the list of
mandatory (resp. non-mandatory) monitoring / supervision information, amongst
which the following two attributes can be extracted:
\- Operating mode: it represents the working status of backup batteries. The
enumeration value of operating mode could be charge, discharge, float charge,
sleep, and safe. The change of operating mode is a monitored event and can be
sent out from the on-site battery system to a remote management application.
\- Estimated remaining battery autonomy (time): it is an information which may
be consulted from a remote management application to know the remaining
battery autonomy time.
Clause C.1 of ETSI ES 202 336-11 [18] provides the structure of an XML
document which can be used to control and monitor battery systems from a
remote management application.
Where (i.e. in which SDO) and when the aforementioned information and data
models are specified is FFS.
### 4.9.3 Conclusion
To fulfil the requirement REQ-ES_BB-1 from clause 4.9.1.2, this potential
solution #1 should be complemented with:
# an information model (Stage 2) specifying the backup battery information
(based on ETSI ES 202 336-11 [18]) that can be monitored for the NG-RAN in the
3GPP management system;
# data model(s) (Stage 3), in YAML and/or in YANG.
## 4.10 Key Issue #10: Digital sobriety
### 4.10.1 Description
It should be clear that the efforts requested by 3GPP are to be made when
specifying new features, by the integration of environmental aspects into the
3GPP Technical Specifications (TS) development process, by balancing
ecological and functional, performance, QoS, etc. requirements.
Digital sobriety, in the context of this study, encompasses all design
principles enabling to optimize the volume of information to be:
\- processed;
\- stored;
\- transported;
by the 3GPP system.
Optimizing the volume of information processed, stored, carried by 3GPP
networks can be addressed at:
# user plane;
# control plane;
# management plane.
When it comes to \'consider EE as a guiding principle when developing new
solutions and evolving the 3GPP systems specification\', only the management
plane (i.e. OA&M) is in the scope of the present document.
Though it is well known that the management plane traffic volumes are far less
than e.g. user plane ones, it is 3GPP\'s responsibility to try to optimize
them anyway, from the specification phase to the operation phase.
This key issue focuses on the specification phase in 3GPP, and aims at
studying where and when it is possible to minimize OA&M traffic volumes
processed and/or transported and/or stored by the managed elements / functions
and management functions, so as to render the 3GPP system more digitally
sober.
As said above, the energy consumed by managed elements, managed functions and
management functions highly depends on the volumes of information that they:
\- process; and/or
\- store; and/or
\- carry.
Based on the above, this key issue aims at studying how 3GPP can consider
digital sobriety when specifying OA&M concepts, architectures, interfaces,
APIs, Network Resource Models (NRM), etc.
NOTE: This key issue and its potential solution(s) do not aim at deriving any
potential requirements for the 3GPP management system. Instead, they aim at
proposing recommendations to be considered by 3GPP when developing new, or
evolving existing, specifications.
### 4.10.2 Conclusion
There is no potential solution in the present document.
