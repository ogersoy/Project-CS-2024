# 4 Background
## 4.1 General
For 5GS, there are several charging specifications focus on the charging
aspects about wholesale and business to business for Industry verticals.
Corresponding charging specifications needs to be studied on how it could be
documented, including but not limited to the charging aspect of Network Slice,
Non-Public Network, Time Sensitive Network, Edge Computing, and 5G LAN etc.
The charging architecture and principles of vertical scenarios are different
from those of subscriber charging scenarios which specified in the TS 32.240
[2].
## 4.2 Charging specifications reference considerations
A set of charging specific TSs covers the 5GS domains and 5G service levels
(e.g. Network slice, 5G LAN and TSN, etc.) respectively, in the TS 32.2xx and
TS 28.2xx TS number ranges. These TSs describe the mapping of the common
charging architecture, charging requirements and charging principles onto the
specific services, scenarios, for converged online and offline charging. They
are commonly referred to as the middle tier charging TSs.
The following charging technical specifications reference for vertical
charging are:
\- NEF Charging is specified in the TS 32.254 [3].
\- 5G LAN Charging is specified in the TS 32.254 [3].
\- Edge Computing is specified in the TS 32.257 [4].
\- Network Slicing is specified in the TS 28.201 [5], TS 28.202 [6] and TS
28.203 [7].
\- Data connectivity charging is specified in the TS 32.255 [15].
The following charging technical report reference for vertical charging are:
\- NPN Charging is studied in the TR 28.828 [8].
\- TSN Charging is studied in the TR 28.839 [9].
\- Network slice charging is studied in the TR 32.847 [10].
\- Wholesale charging is studied in the TR 28.827 [11].
A set of TSs in the TS 32.29x range covers common aspects, such as CDR
parameter and syntax descriptions, online and offline charging applications,
and the charging interactions within the network (CDR transfer) as well as
between the network and the Billing Domain (CDR file transfer).
## 4.3 The concept clarification
The **vertical** domain is an industry or group of enterprises in which
similar products or services are developed, produced, and provided, specified
in the TS 22.104 [12]. For example, the typical vertical domains can be the
factories of the future; electric-power distribution and central power
generation; and connected hospitals or medical facilities.
The **enterprise** is an [organization]{.underline}, a [company]{.underline},
or a [business]{.underline}. For example, the typical enterprises can be the
[manufacturing]{.underline}/[catering]{.underline}/[farming]{.underline}
enterprise, a [large]{.underline}/[small]{.underline}/medium-sized enterprise.
The **Tenant** in 3GPP management system is a group of 3GPP management system
users associated with the management capabilities they are allowed to access
and consume, described in clause 4.8 the TS 28.533 [13]. The tenant in
charging aspect can be the network slice subscriber, i.e. the party for which
the network slice instance(s) is(are) created, satisfying the requirements of
subscribed-to service(s), specified in the TS 28.202 [6].
The **Subscriber** is used to identify the enterprise based on the
subscription relationship between enterprise and MNO, for example, which can
be the Tenant id for the network slice charging.
# 5 Business Roles
## 5.1 General
To support the 5G and further service charging, the business roles for the
current supported special service charging in the specifications which is
related with the vertical charging are listed:
Network Slicing:
  * Communication Service Provider (CSP): who provides the Provides communication services to **Communication Service Customer (** CSC). e.g. tenant, vertical.
  * **Network Slice Provider (NSP):** The CSP or NOP who provides Network Slice as a Service.
Edge Computing:
  * ECSP (Edge Computing Service Provider) who provides edge data network environment.
Network Exposure Charging:
  * External 3^rd^ party service provider: Who hosting an Application(s) and consumers the services provided by 3GPP network via Network Capability Exposure, such as the 5G LAN.
NPN Charging:
  * NPN Service Provider (NPN-SP): a Communication Service Provider (CSP) which provides communication services for non-public use, e.g. vertical, tenant, NOP.
TSN Charging:
  * TSN Service Provider (TSN-SP): provides communication services for TSN Bridge use, e.g. enterprise.
  * TS Service Provider (TS-SP): provides communication services for time-sensitive communication and time synchronization, e.g. enterprise.
Wholesale charging:
  * Additional actor: This is a retailer or a wholesaler of mobile services but does not own licensed radio spectrum, an additional actor that is a retailer is often referred to as Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO).
## 5.2 High level business roles
Based on the investigation of business roles and charging scenarios for
existing 5G and further service charging in the clause 5.1, the high-level
business roles can be categorized to the B2B (Business to Business), B2C
(Business to Customer) and B2B2X:
\- The B2B (Business to Business) describes a type of business relationship in
which businesses provide goods or services to other businesses.
\- The B2C (Business to Consumer) describes a type of business relationship in
which businesses provide goods or services to consumer. e.g. individual
subscriber.
\- The B2B2X is the combinations of the B2B and B2C which will not be
described in more details.
The first Letters in the \"**B** \"2B and \"**B** \"2C is the charging party,
the MNO.
The second letters in the B2\"**B** \" and B2\"**C** \" is the charged party,
e.g. the network slice tenant or the individual subscriber.
## 5.3 Business relationship based on business roles
To support the 5G services charging, the relationship based on business roles
for example is described as the following. The following examples are
targeting a particular business model in order to describe the business
relationship based on whether inter-providers or end user as charged party.
Potential business relationship may be involved multiple business models at
the same time, both B2B and B2B2C, which is not described in the document.

The charging principles on the basis of the charging architecture and
framework and charging requirements are present.
#### 6.2.1.1 Use Case #1.1 Charging Principle Applicability
The common charging principle specified in the TS 32.240 [2] is designed for
legacy charging system, i.e. online charging system and offline charging
system in 2G/3G/4G, and is also used for the enhanced charging system, i.e.
converged online and offline charging system in 5G or future). With the
development of the 5G or future advanced network, the B2B and B2C charging
scenarios focus on the special requirements from the vertical (various
industries) in the charging principle, for example, the CHF selection options.
The consistent charging principle template which is applicable to the
different 5G or future services charging should be investigated, based on the
all the existing charging principles in the separated charging service TSs
(e.g. TS 28.201 [5], TS 28.202 [6]) and common.
Describe the charging principles template to apply to B2B and B2C separately
and structure the document outline to understand the reference the of charging
principle in the multiple services TSs and common, that will help internal and
external stakeholder to find the information about the charging principle they
need in the common and special.

## 7.4 Solution #4: Network slice tenant charging architecture
### 7.4.1 Solution description
#### 7.4.1.1 General
This solution #4 resolves the key issues #2. Based on the network slice tenant
charging, the separated UE converged charging and network slice tenant
converged charging are present.
#### 7.4.1.2 Solution
Figure 7.4.1.2-1: Network slice tenant charging architecture option
Two types of subscribers are considered in the context of network slice tenant
charging:
\- The Tenant the Network Slice is assigned to, which is referred to as \"NS-
Tenant\", which can be considered as the charged party of B2B.
\- The individual end-user \"UE\" served under the Network Slice, which can be
considered as the charged party of B2C.
Each type of subscriber is handled under a separated Converged Charging System
(CCS): \"Tenant CCS\" and \"UE CCS\" respectively.
\"UE CCS\" performs charging functionalities for individual UEs (i.e. B2C),
see the clause 6.3.2.1 General description in TR 32.847 [10].
\"Tenant CCS\" performs charging functionalities for NS-Tenant (i.e. B2B), see
the clause 6.3.2.1 General description and clause 6.6 in TR 32.847 [10].
The Nchf exposed by the CHF (Tenant CCS) is defined for enabling two cases:
\- Association between individual UE charging and NS tenant charging. This
association is achieved by UE CCS responsible for individual UE charging
consuming the Nchf exposed by the Tenant CCS.
\- Charging for the NS Tenant charging only.
## 7.5 Solution #5: Converged tenant charging architecture
### 7.5.1 Solution description
#### 7.5.1.1 General
This solution #5 resolves the key issues #2. Based on the possible solutions
#4 network slice tenant charging architecture in clause 7.4, NF(CTF) interacts
with the UE CCS and NF (CTF) interacts with the Tenant CCS separately, and the
UE CCS interacts with the Tenant CCS solution #3 Converged charging
architecture in the clause 7.3, CEF and NF (CTF) interact with the UE CCS, the
converged tenant charging architecture is present to combined all the
architectures into one in figure 7.5.1.2-1.
#### 7.5.1.2 Solution
Figure 7.5.1.2-1: Converged tenant charging architecture option in reference
point representation
Two types of charging are considered in the context of converged vertical
charging architecture:
\- The subscriber-based charging (i.e. B2C) via NF(CTF), e.g. SMF.
\- The inter-provider charging (i.e. B2B) via NF(CTF)/MnS and/or CEF, e.g.
EES.
\- Interaction between UE CCS and CCS supports the B2B charging scenarios,
which provides the interaction between CHFs, including but not limited to
support the UE converged charging impacted by vertical charging.
The Tenant CCS supports the B2B charging scenarios can be applicable in the
following different charging scenarios:
\- Network slice charging: The CCS is the Network slice Tenant CCS.
\- NPN Charging: The CCS is the NPI-NPN/SNPN Tenant CCS.
\- 5G LAN Charging: The CCS is the LAN Tenant CCS.
\- Edge Computing Charging: The CCS is the ECSP Tenant CCS.
\- TSN Charging: The CCS is the TSN Tenant CCS.
## 7.6 Solution #6: CHF-to-CHF Communication
### 7.6.1 Solution description
#### 7.6.1.1 General
This solution #6 resolves the key issues #2. Based on the study about
wholesale and roaming charging, CHF-to-CHF communication is supported.
#### 7.6.1.2 Solution
Figure 7.6.1.2-1: CHF to CHF communication for MVNO Charging
Two types of charging are considered in the context of vertical charging:
\- the retail charging (i.e.B2C) by A-CHF is out of 3GPP SA5 scope, the Ny
reference point is in the scope;
\- the wholesale charging (i.e.B2B) by CHF for MVNO, see the details of
solution #4.3 in the TR 28.827 [11].
## 7.7 Solution #7: NF to CHFs communication
### 7.7.1 Solution description
#### 7.7.1.1 General
This solution #7 resolves the key issues #2. Based on the MVNO (owning a CHF
referred to as A-CHF) non-roaming scenario, the N40 reference point is defined
for the interactions between SMF and CHF owned by MNO, the N47 reference point
is used for the interactions between SMF owned by the MNO and A-CHF owned by
the MVNO, NFâ€‘to-CHF communication for MVNO charging.
#### 7.7.1.2 Solution
Figure 7.7.1.2-1: NF(V-SMF) to CHF communication for MVNO Charging
N47 used by A-CHF owned by an additional actor (i.e. MVNO) to perform retail
charging for its own subscribers is operator specific, specified in the TS
32.255 [15].
## 7.8 Solution #8: Separated charging architecture
### 7.8.1 Solution description
#### 7.8.1.1 General
This solution #8 solves the key issues #2. The separated charging architecture
for B2B, B2C and the internal relationship are described in the different
causes.
In the charging architecture for B2C, the interaction for the NF and UE CCS is
present, and the related NF (e.g. SMF) and the corresponding reference (i.e.
TS 32.255 [15]) will be detailed.
In the charging architecture for the B2B, the interaction for the NF and
Tenant CCS is present, and the related NF (e.g. NWDAF) and the corresponding
reference (i.e. TS 28.201 [5]) will be detailed.
In the charging architecture for the internal relationship, the interaction
for the UE CCS and Tenant CCS is present, and the related scenarios (e.g. SMF
for the volume based charging impacted by the tenant charging) and the
corresponding reference (i.e. TS 32.255 [15]) will be detailed.
#### 7.8.1.2 Solution
The suggested separated charging architecture and document structure for
charging principle is present.
Add the new chapter for the charging principle template and charging
architecture in the TS 32.240 [2].

## 7.9 Solution Evaluation
The Solution #1 and #2 solve the key issue #1:
\- Solution #1 proposed to create the new TS for the business to business
charging scenarios which can provide the umbrella clearly for the vertical
charging. In that way, B2B and B2C are separated which brings some trouble for
the internal and external stakeholder to search required information and the
internal relationship between B2B and B2C is difficult to covered.
\- Solution #2 proposed to add the new clause in the existing TS 32.240 [2],
which can present the charging principle for the B2C and B2B in the same TS.
In that way, understand the common charging principle as the whole charging
system and the special charging principle for the certain services in the
charging service specifications.
The new annex also can include the charging architecture applicability for
B2B, B2C.
The Solution #3, #4, #5, #6 #7 and #8 solve the key issue #2:
\- Solution #3 about existing converged charging architecture is applicable
for the general charging capabilities and B2B charging scenarios, which
distributed in the different charging service TSs.
\- Solution #4 about existing network slice tenant charging architecture is
applicable for the network slice charging, can support the B2B, B2C charging,
\- Solution #5 about existing converged tenant charging architecture merged
the solution #x for network slice tenant charging and solution #x converged
charging architecture is applicable for all the charging scenarios, can
support B2B and B2C charging.
\- Solution #6 about the existing NF to CHFs communication is applicable for
roaming and MVNO charging, can support B2B and B2C charging, which distributed
in the different charging service TSs.
\- Solution #7 about the existing CHF to CHF communication is applicable for
roaming and MVNO charging, can support B2B and B2C charging, which distributed
in the different charging service TSs.
\- Solution #8 about existing separated charging architecture describes the
different business relationship for B2B, B2C, which can clearly present the
charging architecture applicability in the different charging scenarios via
the different NF referred to the different special charging service
specifications. In that way, the internal and external stakeholder can
understand the charging scenarios and reference for the NF charging in the
common way, which is easy to find the required information distributed in the
multiple TSs.
# 8 Conclusions and recommendations
For key issue #1, the solution #2 proposed to add the Annex (Normative) in the
existing TS 32.240 [2] should be selected to the normative work.
For key issues #2, the solution #8 proposed to add the Annex (Normative) in
