# 4 Concepts and overview
## 4.1 Concept of edge computing management
The edge computing services are provided by edge computing service providers
(ECSP), application service providers (ASP), and PLMN operators (see annex B
in TS 23.558 [1]), where ASP is responsible for the creation of edge
application servers (EAS) and application clients (AC), ECSP is responsible
for the deployment of edge data networks (EDN) that contain EAS and EES, and
PLMN operator is responsible for the deployment of 5G network functions, such
as 5GC and 5G NR.
Figure 4.1-1 describes the edge computing management framework that contains
PLMN management system and ECSP management system. ECSP management system, as
the producer, provides management services enabling ASP and ECSP consumers to
orchestrate and manage EDN NFs (e.g., EAS, EES, and ECS). PLMN management
system, as the producer, provides management services enabling ECSP management
system to interconnect EDN NFs with 5GC NFs (e.g., PCF, UPF, NEF). Both ECSP
management system and PLMN management system communicate with ETSI NFV MANO to
perform lifecycle management functions.
Figure 4.1-1: Edge computing management framework
# 5 Edge Computing Management (ECM) capabilities
## 5.1 Lifecycle management
### 5.1.1 Description
The lifecycle management of the edge components is to be enabled by the 3GPP
Management System. The lifecycle management includes instantiation,
termination, modification and query of the edge components.
### 5.1.2 EAS deployment
The goal of this use case is to enable ASP to deploy the EAS in the EDN, by
requesting the provisioning MnS producer with the deployment requirements
(e.g. the topological or geographical service areas, software image
information, QoS, affinity/anti-affinity with other EAS, etc.) to deploy the
EAS. The provisioning MnS producer returns a response indicating the operation
is in progress to prevent the consumer from waiting, as the deployment in the
edge cloud may take a while. Since, there can be multiple Edge Data Network
(EDN) present/serving a particular edge location. This makes it critical for
application service provider to have their EAS deployed at appropriate EDN(s)
to provide high performance services for the UE. Therefore, provisioning MnS
producer analyses the deployment requirements to determine where (i.e. on
which EDN) and how many EAS VNF instance(s) should be instantiated, and
requests the NFVO in ETSI NFV MANO to instantiate the EAS VNF instance(s). The
provisioning MnS producer sends a notification to ASP indicating the result of
instantiation (e.g. success, failure) when a notification is received from
NFVO indicating the result of instantiation operation.
### 5.1.3 EAS termination
The goal of this use case is to enable ASP to terminate the EAS in the EDN, by
requesting the provisioning MnS producer to terminate the EAS VNF instance.
The provisioning MnS producer requests the NFVO in ETSI NFV MANO to terminate
the EAS VNF instances. The provisioning MnS producer sends a notification to
ASP indicating the termination is in progress when a notification is received
from NFVO indicating the start of termination operation. The provisioning MnS
producer sends another notification to ASP indicating the result of
termination (e.g. success, failure) when a notification is received from NFVO
indicating the result of termination operation.
### 5.1.4 Query EAS information
The goal of this use case is to enable ASP to query the EAS information in the
EDN, by requesting the provisioning MnS producer to query the EAS instance.
Upon receiving the query request, the provisioning MnS producer sends the EAS
instance information to ASP.
### 5.1.5 EAS modification
The goal of this use case is to enable ASP to modify the EAS in the EDN, by
requesting the provisioning MnS producer to modify the EAS instance. If the
modification requires the change (e.g. scale) for the virtualized resource of
the EAS VNF instance, the provisioning MnS producer requests the NFVO in ETSI
NFV MANO for the appropriate operation of the EAS VNF instances. The
provisioning MnS producer sends a notification to ASP indicating the
attribute(s) change of the EAS instance.
### 5.1.6 EES Deployment
The provisioning MnS producer is requested to instantiate the EES, as 3GPP
network functions, aiming to server the particular location. The instantiated
EES may serve one or multiple EAS.
A consumer request for EES(s) instantiation providing EES deployment
requirements. The provisioning MnS producer determines the EDN where the
EES(s) will be instantiated, instantiate the EES VNF and establish the
connection with 5GC network functions. The provisioning MnS producer will
accept the request and notify the consumer about the instantiation in-
progress. Thereafter, the notification will be sent to indicate the successful
EES instantiation.
### 5.1.7 EES Termination
The goal is to enable the termination of one or more EES(s) on the EDN. A
consumer consumes the provisioning MnS to terminate the EES with the EES
identifier. The provisioning MnS producer terminates the EES VNF based on the
EES identifier, and disconnects the EES from the 5GC network functions. The
provisioning MnS producer will accept the request and notify the consumer
about the termination in-progress. Thereafter, the notification will be sent
to indicate that the EES has been terminated successfully.
### 5.1.8 Query EES information
The goal of this use case is to enable a consumer to query the EES information
in the EDN, by requesting the provisioning MnS producer to query the EES
instance. Upon receiving the query request, the provisioning MnS producer
sends the EES instance information to the consumer.
### 5.1.9 EES Modification
The goal of this use case is to enable a consumer to modify the EES in the
EDN, by requesting the provisioning MnS producer to modify the EES instance.
If the modification requires the change (e.g. scale) for the virtualized
resource of the EES VNF instance, the provisioning MnS producer requests the
NFVO in ETSI NFV MANO for the appropriate operation of the EES VNF instances.
The provisioning MnS producer sends a notification to the consumer indicating
the attribute(s) change of the EES instance.
### 5.1.10 ECS Deployment
_The goal is to_ enable the instantiation of one or more ECS. To support
deployed EDN, operator will deploy ECS serving one or multiple EES. A consumer
request for ECS(s) instantiation providing ECS deployment requirements. The
provisioning MnS producer instantiate the ECS VNF and establish the required
connection with 5GC network functions. The notifications will be sent to
indicate that the ECS has been instantiated successfully.
### 5.1.11 ECS Termination
_The goal is to_ enable the termination of one or more ECS. A consumer
consumes the provisioning service to terminate the ECS with the ECS
identifier. The provisioning MnS producer terminates the ECS VNF based on the
ECS identifier, and disconnects the ECS from the 5GC network functions. The
notification will be sent to indicate that the ECS has been terminated
successfully.
### 5.1.12 Query ECS information
The goal of this use case is to enable a consumer to query the ECS instance
information, by requesting the provisioning MnS producer to query the ECS
instance. Upon receiving the query request, the provisioning MnS producer
sends the ECS instance information to the consumer.
### 5.1.13 ECS Modification
The goal of this use case is to enable a consumer to modify the ECS instance,
by requesting the provisioning MnS producer to modify the ECS instance. If the
modification requires the change (e.g. scale) for the virtualized resource of
the ECS VNF instance, the provisioning MnS producer requests the NFVO in ETSI
NFV MANO for the appropriate operation of the ECS VNF instances. The
provisioning MnS producer sends a notification to the consumer indicating the
attribute(s) change of the ECS instance.
### 5.1.13a Instantiation triggered by EAS discovery failure
EES may need to trigger dynamic EAS instantiation when EES fails to discover
and select the EAS that matches the UE location and the requesting application
characteristics EAS (see table 8.5.3.2-2 in TS 23.558 [2]) due to no available
EAS during the EAS discovery (see clause 8.5 in TS 23.558 [2]).
A consumer would consume performance assurance MnS to request the ECSP
management system to collect EAS discovery failure measurement that will be
used to determine whether an EAS needs to be initiated, based on performance
information, such as UE locations, application characteristics, and number of
UEs that have failed in the EAS discovery.

### 5.1.15 EAS Relocation
The ESCP Management System may decide that a different EDN can better host the
EAS. The EAS relocation trigger from ESCP Management System are related with
lifecycle management of its edge compute resources. The ASP provides its
policy indication regarding change of the edge compute resource hosting the
Edge Application. There ESCP Management System considers these policy while
relocating EAS within the ED or from one EDN to another.
The ASP indicates the following policies:
\- Its Edge Application cannot be moved from one edge compute resource to
another;
\- Its Edge Application can be moved from one edge compute resource to
another, without any notification;
\- Its Edge Application can be moved from one edge compute resource to another
with prior notification.
When the policy is that a change of edge compute resource can be done with
prior notification, the ESCP Management System decides that a change of edge
compute resource is needed and selects the new edge compute resource. In this
case, the ASP chooses the exact timing of the move. If the ASP indicates that
the EAS is not able to handle relocation, the ESCP Management System shall not
initiate relocation procedure.
## 5.2 Performance assurance
### 5.2.1 Description
The clause contains use cases associated with performance assurance.
### 5.2.2 EAS performance assurance
_The goal of this use case is to provide a mechanism for EAS to publish KPIs
or measurements, as per requirements shown in Table 5.2.2-1 (see clause
5.2.10.2_ in TS 23.558 [2]).
Table 5.2.2-1: Edge Application Server Service KPIs
* * *
Information element Status Description Maximum Request rate O Maximum request

* * *
A consumer, such as ASP, would consume performance assurance MnS to request
the ECSP management system to collect EAS KPIs and measurements. The
performance assurance MnS producer at ECSP management system will report the
measurements to the consumer.
### 5.2.3 5GC NF measurements to evaluate EAS performance
_The goal is to_ enable ECSP management system to collect the measurements of
5GC NFs (e.g. UPF, PCF, ...) that are needed to evaluate the EAS performance.
For example, the ECSP management system can correlate the 5GC NF and EAS
measurements to determine the root cause of poor EAS performance. ECSP
management system, as the consumer would consume performance assurance MnS to
request the PLMN management system to collect 5GC NF measurements that are
related to EAS performance. The performance assurance MnS producer at PLMN
management system will report the measurements to the consumer.
Since an PLMN operator may not want to expose certain measurements (e.g.
measurements for 5GC NF(s) not relevant to EAS) to 3^rd^ party operators, like
ECSP, the PLMN management system should be able to select specific
measurements to be reported to the consumer.
### 5.2.4 ECS performance assurance
_The goal of this use case is to provide a mechanism for ECS performance
assurance. ECS performance can be based on various functionalities defined for
ECS in (see clause 6.3.4 of [2])._ The measurement/KPI should be defined for
each functionality, that can be collected as and when required.
A consumer, such as ECSP Management system, would consume performance
assurance MnS to request the PLMN management system to collect ECS KPIs and
measurements. The performance assurance MnS producer at PLMN management system
will report the measurements to the consumer.
### 5.2.5 EES performance assurance
_The goal of this use case is to provide a mechanism for EES performance
assurance. EES performance can be based on various functionalities defined for
EES in (see clause 6.3.4 of [2])._ The measurement/KPI should be defined for

## 5.3 Fault supervision
### 5.3.1 Description
The clause contains use cases associated with fault supervision.
### 5.3.2 EDN NF performance impacted by 5GC NF alarms
_The goal is to_ enable ECSP management system to receive 5GC NFs (e.g. UPF,
PCF, NEF, SCEF, ...) alarms that may impact the EDN NFs (e.g. EAS, EES)
performance from PLMN management system. ECSP management system can correlate
the 5GC NF alarms to determine the root causes for poor EDN NF performance.
ECSP management system subscribes to receive 5GC NF alarms from PLMN
management system. PLMN management system sends the NF alarm notification to
ECSP management system when it detects 5GC NF alarms.
### 5.3.3 5GC NF issues resulted from EDN NF alarms
_The goal is to_ enable PLMN management system to receive EDN NFs (e.g. EAS,
EES, ECS) alarms that may generate issues in 5GC NFs (e.g. UPF, PCF, NEF,
SCEF, ...) that are supporting EDN from ECSP management system. PLMN
management system can correlate the EDN NF alarms to determine the root causes
for 5GC NF issues. PLMN management system subscribes to receive EDN NF alarms
from ECSP management system. ECSP management system sends the NF alarm
notification to PLMN management system when it detects EDN NF alarms.

## 5.4 5GC NF Provisioning
### 5.4.1 Description
The clause contains use cases associated with provisioning.
### 5.4.2 EDN NF 5GC connection provisioning
_The goal is to_ enable ECSP management system to request PLMN management
system to query the connection information of EDN NFs (i.e., EAS, EES, ECS) to
5GC NFs, as specified in c _lauses 6.3.2, 6.3.4, 6.4.6 in TS 23.558 [2],_
where EES, ECS, and EAS are interacting with 3GPP Core Network for accessing
the capabilities of network functions either directly (e.g. via PCF) or
indirectly (e.g. via SCEF/NEF/SCEF+NEF).
Figure 5.4.2-1 shows an example of edge computing networks. EDN #1 is trusted
by PLMN operators; therefore, EAS #1 and EES #1 are acting as the trusted AF,
and are authorized to interfaces to PCF directly in via the N5 reference point
(see clause 4.2.3 in TS 23.501 [11]), or via Edge-7 and Edge-2 interfaces (see
clause 6.2 in TS 23.558). EDN #2 is not trusted by PLMN operators; therefore,
EAS #2 and EES #2 are acting as the untrusted AF, and are not authorized to
interfaces to PCF directly (See clause 5.6.7.1 TS 23.501 [11]), and need to
interface to NEF / SCEF via the N33 reference point (see Figure 4.2.3-5 in TS
23.501), or via Edge-7 and Edge-2 interfaces. ECS should be able to connect to
NEF / SCEF via the edge-8 interface (see clause 6.3.4 in TS 23.558 [2]).
Figure 5.4.2-1: Edge computing networks
ECSP management system requests PLMN management system to identify the PCF,
NEF, or SCEF to which the EDN NFs need to interface. The request should
include the EDN identifier and the service area requirements (i.e., EDN
service area, EES service area, and EAS service area (see clause 7.3.3 in TS
23.558 [2])). PLMN management system finds and returns the connection
information (i.e., the IP addresses and DN of PCF, NEF, SCEF) to ECSP
management system, based on the requirements. ECSP management system then
connects EAS, ECS, and EES to 5GC NFs via the connection information given by
PLMN management system, according to Figure 5.4.2-1.
### 5.4.3 Configuration needed for EAS registration
_The goal is to_ enable a consumer to configure EASID and EES address for the
EAS that are required as the pre-conditions of EAS registration procedure (see
clause 8.4.3.2.1 in TS 23.558 [2]). A consumer (e.g. ASP, ECSP) requests ECSP
management system to configure the EASID and EES address attributes in
EASFunction IOC. ECSP management system configures the EASID and EES address
attributes in EASFunction MOI, and returns the attribute change notification
to the consumer.
### 5.4.4 EAS to connect with UPF
_The goal is to_ enable ECSP management system to connect a newly deployed EAS
to a UPF. Figure 5.4.4-1 shows that EASs are deployed in the local part of the
Data Network (DN) that are connected to UPF to carry the user traffic via the
N6 interface (see clause 6.3.3 in TS 23.501 [11]). ECSP management system
requests PLMN management system to connect a newly deployed EAS to a UPF with
_EAS IP address,_ EAS service area requirements (see clause 7.3.3.6 in TS
23.558 [2])), and list of DNAI and N6 traffic routing requirements ((see Table
8.2.4.1 in TS 23.558 [2])). PLMN management system finds a UPF among the
UPF(s) being deployed that meets the service area requirements (e.g. UPF #2 is
found to connect to EAS #2). In the case that no UPF can be found (e.g. EAS
#3), PLMN management system will deploy a new UPF (e.g. UPF #3) and then
configure the SMF to add the UPF to the list of available UPF(s) (see clause
6.3.3.2 in TS 23.501 [11]). PLMN management system connects the UPF to the
EAS, and return the UPF information (e.g. IP addresses and DN of the UPF) to
the ECSP management system.

## 5.5 Edge Federation Management
### 5.5.1 Description
This clause contains use cases associated with federation management.
### 5.5.2 Federated EAS deployment and termination
Federation enables operator to control the launch and termination of
applications on a PO. This will be used by a LO to instantiate an application
on EDN of PO as requested by ASP over NBI. A LO makes the application
instantiation result available on the NBI interface. PO also provide the
application instance status to LO which LO may expose to application providers
on NBI.

## 5.6 Edge Federation Management
### 5.6.1 Description
This clause contains use cases associated with federation management.
### 5.6.2 Federation Management
The federation management functionality within the operator enables it to
interact with other operator instances, often in different geographies,
thereby providing access for the ASP to a larger footprint of EDN, a more
extensive set of subscribers and multiple Operator capabilities. An operator
initiates the establishment of federation relationship with another operator
sharing available location(s) at which the edge services are provided,
resource available at each location, federation expiry etc. The operator which
initiates federation relationship is called Leading Operator (LO). The
operator which receives federation relationship request is called Partner
Operator (PO).
The federation relationship enables the following functionalities.
\- Federated EAS resource reservation management: This is intended for an LO
to reserve resources for an application provider, with the PO, when the
application provider initiate the reservation using NBI.
\- Federated EAS deployment and termination: This will be used by an LO to
instantiate an EAS deployment on EDN of LO as requested by application
provider over NBI.
\- EDN sharing: This is intended for operator to share EDN among each other.

# 7 Procedural Flows
## 7.1 Lifecycle management
### 7.1.1 Description
The clause contains procedures associated with lifecycle management.
### 7.1.2 EAS lifecycle management
#### 7.1.2.1 EAS deployment
Figure 7.1.2.1-1 depicts a procedure that describes how an ASP can consume
provisioning MnS to instantiate the EAS. It is assumed that both ASP and ECSP
consumers have subscribed to the producer of provisioning MnS to receive
notifications.
Figure 7.1.2.1-1: EAS deployment
1\. ASP consumes the provisioning MnS with _createMOI_ operation (see clause
11.1.1.1. in TS 28.532 [w]) for EASRequirements IOC to request ECSP
provisioning MnS producer to start the EAS VNF instantiation, where the
EASRequirements IOC contains the deployment requirements, including (but not
limited to) the following attributes:
\- the service areas (i.e., geographical, or topological) where the UEs can
access the edge computing service (see clause 7.3.3 in TS 28.558 [2]).
\- Software image information and virtual resource information (e.g. software
image location, minimum RAM, disk requirements) (see clause 7.1.6.5 and 7.1.9
in ETSI NFV IFA-011 [7]).
\- QoS requirements (e.g. bandwidth, end-to-end latency).
\- service continuity requirements (e.g. whether service continuity is
required).
\- Affinity/Anti-affinity: The affinity and ant-affinity requirements for the
EAS with other existing EAS on the target EDN.
2\. ECSP provisioning MnS producer sends a response to the ASP indicating that
the instantiation operation is in progress.
3\. ECSP provisioning MnS producer analyses the deployment requirements to
determine which EDN and how many EAS instance(s) should be instantiated to
satisfy the deployment requirements, and downloads the EAS VNF software image
from the software image location. The EDN can be selected either by
considering the individual requirement or by grouping the multiple
requirements as single selection criteria.
4\. ECSP provisioning MnS producer invokes the _InstantiateNsRequest_ or
UpdateNsRequest operation (see clause 7.3.3 and 7.3.5 in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013
[6]) to request NFVO via the Os-Ma-nfvo interface to instantiate a NS instance
including the EAS VNF instance.
Editor\'s note: which entity is responsible for creating VNFD based on the
deployment requirement (e.g., softwareImageInfo and virtualResource) is FFS.
5\. NFVO sends **a** notification to ECSP provisioning MnS producer indicating
the result of instantiation procedure (see clause 7.3.3.4 and 7.3.5.4 of ETSI
GS NFV-IFA 013 [6]).
6\. If the VNF instantiation has been successful, ECSP provisioning MnS
producer creates the MOI for EASFunction IOC.
7\. If all VNF instance(s) have been successfully instantiated, then:
7.1. ECSP provisioning MnS producer creates the MOI for EASRequirements IOC.
7.2. ECSP provisioning MnS producer notifies ASP about the successful
instantiation of EAS with the creation of MOIs for the EASRequirement IOC and
EASFunction(s) IOC.
> Otherwise:

### 7.4.4 EAS to connect to UPF
Figure 7.4.4-1 depicts a procedure to describe how ECSP management system can
consume provisioning MnS to request PLMN management system to connect EAS to
UPF for transporting the user traffic via the N6 interface (see clause (see c
_lause 4.2.3 in TS 23.501 [11]). To support the connection of EAS NF to UPF
NF,_ EcmConnectionInfo IOC should include the following attributes:
\- EAS IP address: indicate the UPF IP address.
\- EAS and EDN service area requirements: EAS service area (see clause 7.3.3
in TS 23.558 [2]).
\- ECM connection type: indicate the user plane connection
\- N6 traffic routing list: each entry in the list should contain the
following attributes (see clause 8.2.4 in TS 23.558 [2]):
\- DNAI: DNAI(s) associated with the EAS.
\- N6 traffic routing requirements: N6 traffic routing information
corresponding to each EAS DNAI.
\- UPF Connection information: contains the following attributes:
\- UPF IP address: the IP address of the accessing NF.
\- UPF DN: the UPF DN to be configured in EASFunction IOC to indicate where
the UPF is connected.
Figure 7.4.4-1: EAS to connect to UPF
1\. ECSP management system consumes the provisioning MnS with _createMOI_
operation (see clause 11.1.1.1. in TS 28.532 [5]) for EcmConnectionInfo IOC to
request PLMN management system to connect the EAS to an UPF. EcmConnectionInfo
includes EAS IP address, EAS service area , EDN service area, N6 traffic
routing requiremments and ecmConnectionType with value USERPLANE.
2\. PLMN management system finds a UPF based on the EAS and EDN service
areas.and N6 traffic routing requirements.
> If an UPF can be found, then performs the following steps:
3\. PLMN management system creates the EcmConnectionInfo MOI with
uPFConnectionInfo, including UPF IP address and UPF DN.
4\. PLMN management system create EP_N6 MOI with UPF IP address in
localAddress, and EAS IP address in remoteAddress to connect UPF to EAS.
5\. PLMN management system returns the UPF connection information in the
attributeListOut of the output parameter in _createMOI_ operation to ECSP
management system.
6\. ECSP management system create EP_N6 MOI with EAS IP address in
localAddress, and UPF IP address in remoteAddress.
> If an UPF cannot be found, then performs the following steps:
7\. PLMN management system returns the output parameters for _createMOI_
operation to indicate the UPF instantiation is in progress.
8\. PLMN management system invokes the _InstantiateNsRequest_ operation (see
clause 7.3.3 in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [6]) to request NFVO via the Os-Ma-nfvo
interface to instantiate a NS instance including the UPF VNF instance.
9\. NFVO sends **a** notification to PLMN management system indicating the
result of instantiation procedure (see clause 7.3.3.4 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013
[6]).
10\. If the UPF has been instantiated, then performs the following steps:
10.1. PLMN management system creates the EcmConnectionInfo MOI with UPF
connection information, including UPF IP address and UPF DN.
10.2. PLMN management system create EP_N6 MOI with UPF IP address in
localAddress, and EAS IP address in remoteAddress to connect UPF to EAS.
10.3 PLMN management system sends _notifyMOICreation_ with UPF connection
information in attributeList.
10.4. ECSP management system create EP_N6 MOI with EAS IP address in
localAddress, and UPF IP address in remoteAddress.
11\. If the UPF has not been instantiated, then performs the following step:
11.1 PLMN management system sends _notifyMOICreation_ to ECSP management
system to indicate no UPF can be found.

###### ## Annex B (normative): Availability Zone
# B.1 General
An Availability Zone [14] is the lowest level of abstraction exposed to a
developer who wants to deploy an application on the edge network. It is
defined in terms of a geographical area. A Cloudlet [14] is a point of
presence for the edge cloud. It is the point where edge applications are
deployed. The ECSP do not expose physical location of the cloudlets to the
application service providers. The application service provider is not allowed
to request deployment of its application on a specific edge cloud. There can
be multiple Cloudlet in an Availability Zone. The application service provider
can query for the QoS (latency, jitter etc.) available in a particular
Availability Zone. The OP requires application service provider to specify
target Availability Zone, when requesting for an Application deployment. The
virtual resources can be reserved in a particular Availability Zone on request
from the application service provider.
As ASP queries the available Availability Zones. The ECSP respond with all the
available zone and their characteristics including the QoS supported in each
of them. The ASP choose one of the Availability Zone to deploy an application
on. ASP request ECSP to deploy an application in the selected Availability
Zone. ECSP deploy the given application as part of the AZ.
# B.2 Example of Availability Zone implementation
The following figure shows the relation between AZ and EDN.
Figure B.2-1 Example of Availability Zone
###### ## Annex C (Informative): GSMA OP introduction and concept mapping
The Operator Platform (OP) is defined by GSMA OPG [2], it facilitates access
to the Edge Cloud capability of an Operator or federation of operators and
their partners.
The architecture scope under definition is shown below,
Figure C-1: OP Roles and Interfaces Reference Architecture
The NBI is the interface between the application provider and the Capabilities
Exposure Role in the Operator Platform, it allows an OP to advertise the above
cloud capabilities that it can provide to application providers. In addition,
the NBI allows an application provider to reserve a set of resources or
request an Edge Cloud service with the resources and features that they
require and for the OP to accept or reject the request.
The following table provides the mapping of concepts (not exhaustive) defined
in TS 28.538[6] with the concepts defined in GSMA OPG [14].

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | GSMA[14] | ECM(TS 28.538) | Comment/Observations | +======================+======================+======================+ | Application Instance | EAS VNF Instance | Application Instance | | | | and EAS VNF Instance | | Edge Application | EAS | are both referring | | | | to the application | | | | instances running in | | | | the edge. | | | | | | | | Edge Application and | | | | EAS are both | | | | referring to the | | | | application running | | | | in the edge. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Application Provider | Application Service | Application Provider | | | Provider | and Application | | | | Service Provider | | | | both referring to | | | | the application | | | | providers producing | | | | and requesting for | | | | the deployment of | | | | the applications. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Region | FFS | The higher construct | | | | in the hierarchy | | | | exposed to a | | | | developer who wishes | | | | to deploy an | | | | Application on the | | | | Edge Cloud and | | | | broadly represents a | | | | geography. A Region | | | | typically contains | | | | one or multiple | | | | Availability Zones. | | | | | | | | An OP Region is | | | | equivalent to a | | | | Region on a public | | | | cloud | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Availability Zone | FFS | An Availability Zone | | | | is the lowest level | | | | of abstraction | | | | exposed to a | | | | developer who wants | | | | to deploy an | | | | Application on the | | | | edge network. The | | | | capability to create | | | | Cloudlets within an | | | | Availability Zone is | | | | to be provide by the | | | | OP. | | | | | | | | An OP Availability | | | | Zone is the | | | | equivalent of an | | | | Availability Zone on | | | | Public Cloud | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Cloudlet | FFS | A cloudlet is a | | | | point of presence | | | | for the Edge Cloud. | | | | It is the point | | | | where Edge | | | | Applications are | | | | deployed. | | | | | | | | While EAS | | | | deployment, | | | | appropriate EDN is | | | | selected to deploy | | | | the EAS on. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Capabilities | ECSP Management | Both Capabilities | | Exposure Role in OP | System | Exposure Role in | | | | Operator Platform | | | | and the ECSP | | | | Management System | | | | are the entities | | | | which exposes | | | | interface and | | | | management service | | | | towards ASP. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Northbound Interface | Management services | NBI maps to | | | for Edge Computing | management service, | | | lifecycle management | enabling LCM for | | | | EAS, exposed towards | | | | ASP. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
