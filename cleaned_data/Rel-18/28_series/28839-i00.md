# 5 Charging scenarios and potential requirements
## 5.1 Exposure of Time Synchronization
### 5.1.1 General
5G system supports time synchronization service that can be activated and
deactivated by AF. In order to enable Time Sensitive Communication AF
requested time sensitive communication and time synchronization services, The
TSCTSF/NEF exposes 5GS capability to support Time Synchronization service. The
TSCTSF (directly or via NEF) exposes the 5GS and/or UE availability and
capabilities for synchronization service to the AF as described in TS 23.502
[4].
Exposure of time synchronization comprises the following capabilities:
\- The AF may learn 5GS and/or UE availability and capabilities for time
synchronization service.
\- The AF controls activation and deactivation of the time synchronization
service for the target UE(s).
### 5.1.2 Use Case
#### 5.1.2.1 Use Case #1.1 Exposure of Time Synchronization Service
TS-SC actives the time synchronization service via AF and the AF provides
request to the NEF and the NEF forwards the parameters to the TSCTSF. The AF
trusted by the operator provides these parameters to the TSCTSF directly.
TS-SC de-actives the time synchronization service via AF and the AF provides
request to the NEF and the NEF forwards the parameters to the TSCTSF or
directly to TSCTSF.
The 5GS provides the requested 5GS and/or UE availability and capabilities for
TS-SC.
The MNO may charge the TS-SC based on the exposure events for Time
Synchronization Service.

## 5.2 Enablers for Time Sensitive Communications and Time Synchronization
### 5.2.1 General
5G System features can be used independently or in combination to enable time-
sensitive communication and time synchronization as specified in TS 23.501
[3], including the following:
\- Delay-critical GBR.
\- A hold and forward mechanism to schedule traffic.
\- TSC Assistance Information: describes TSC flow traffic characteristics.
\- Time Synchronization: describes how 5GS can operate as a PTP Relay.
### 5.2.2 Use Case

Synchronization
If the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the AF could interact
directly with TSCTSF, using the same service as the NEF for Time Sensitive
Communications and Time Synchronization. The TSCTSF (directly or via NEF)
exposes the 5GS and/or UE availability and capabilities for synchronization
service to the AF as described in clause 4.15.9.2 of TS 23.502 [4].
For supporting time synchronization service requested by TS-SC, the 5GS is
configured to operate in one or multiple PTP instances, including the support
for derivation of Uu time synchronization error budget.
For supporting transmission gate schedules requested by TS-SC, the 5GS Bridge
is required to provide Bridge Delays for each port pair and traffic class of
the 5GS bridge to an TSN system.
For supporting the TSC traffic characteristics requested by TS-SC, TSC QoS
Flows use a Delay-critical GBR resource type and TSC Assistance Information.

the port on NW-TT support the connectivity to the TSN network, the ports on
DS-TT side are associated to the PDU Session providing connectivity to the TSN
network. The TSN End station/TSN Bridge support the Time Sensitive
Communication over the 5GS bridge, via the DS-TT, UE, UPF, NW-TT based on the
PDU session.
The granularity of the 5GS TSN bridge is per UPF for each network instance or
DNN/S-NSSAI.
### 5.3.2 Use Case
#### 5.3.2.1 Use Case #3.1 Time Sensitive Communication via TSN 5GS Bridge
During the PDU session, Time sensitive communication between the TSN End

If the TSN AF determines that the TSN stream is for UE-Network communication.
The UE1/DS-TT sends the traffic data from TSN stations via UPF/NW-TT to TSN
network for the Time Sensitive Communication over TSN 5GS Bridge.
If the TSN AF determines that the TSN stream is for UE-UE communication (i.e.
ingress and egress ports are in DSâ€‘TTs), the TSN AF divides the stream into
one uplink stream and one or more downlink streams and provides the streams on
AF Session basis to the PCF(s). The SMF applies local switching in order to
enable UPF locally forward uplink stream from one PDU session as downlink
stream in another PDU session.

## 7.4 Solution #4: Time Sensitive Communications charging from TSN station to
TSN station
### 7.4.1 General
The solution #4, addresses the Key Issue #3a and #3b, covering the **REQ-
CH_TSC-01, REQ-CH_TSC-02** and **REQâ€‘CH_TSC-03**.
Based on the clause 5.28.1 of TS 23.501[3], 5.28.1 5GS bridge management,
there is only one PDU Session per DS-TT port for a given UPF. All PDU Sessions
which connect to the same TSN network via a specific UPF are grouped into a
single 5GS bridge.
For time sensitive communications, the following options are present in figure
7.4.1-1:
\- TSN Bridge/End station to TSN Bridge/End station: based on the PDU session
1B, UE1-DS_TT interact with the UPF-B/NW-TT. based on the PDU session 2B,
UE2-DS-TT interact with the UPF-B/NW-TT. The UPF-B/NW-TT is responsible for
the traffic communication between TSN Bridget/End stations. The SMF applies
local switching in order to enable UPF locally forward uplink stream from one
PDU session as downlink stream in another PDU session.

session establishment, PDU session modification, PDU session release of 5G
data connectivity charging would be the same as in clauses 5.2.2.13.2.1,
5.2.2.13.3.1 and 5.2.2.13.4.1 of TS 32.255 [10].
TSN CCS or billing domain aggregates the volume usage per 5GS bridge via 5GS
bridge Id for TSC based on the accumulation of usage reporting via the 5GS
bridge.

### 7.5.1 General
The solution #5, addresses the Key Issue #3a and #3b, covering the **REQ-
CH_TSC-01, REQ-CH_TSC-02** and **REQ-CH_TSC-03**.

## 7.6 Solution #6: Enablers for TSC and TS Charging
### 7.6.1 General
The solution #6, addresses the Key Issue #2a and #2b, covering the **REQ-
CH_ETS-01**.
Based on the clause 5.2.27 TSCTSF Services in TS 23.502 [4], TSCTSF Services
and Service Operations are present in table 7.6.1-1.
The NF consumer AF invokes the TSCTSF service directly or via NEF based on the
whether the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator or not.
Table 7.6.1-1: NF Services provided by the TSCTSF
+----------------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+ | Service Name | Operation Semantics | Example Consumer(s) | +==================================+=====================+=====================+ | **Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization** | Request/Response | AF, NEF | | | | | | | Subscribe/Notify | | +----------------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+ | **Ntsctsf_ASTI** | Request/Response | AF, NEF | +----------------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+ | **Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance** | Request/Response | AF, NEF | | | | | | | Subscribe/Notify | | +----------------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+
For the Time Synchronization service charging, if the NEF charging described
in clause 7.1 solution #1 is supported, TSCTSF(CTF) charging is not required.
If the AF is trusted party, interacting with TSCTSF without NEF, the
TSCTSF(CTF) charging may be supported.
### 7.6.2 Architecture description

### 7.6.3 Flow description
#### 7.6.3.1 TSCTSF directly interact with the AF
If the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the TSCTSF sends the
Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization message directly to the AF. Figure 7.6.3.1-1
describes the high-level charging procedure for enablers for TSC and TS
Charging based on TSCTSF.

## 7.7 Solution #7: Exposure of Time Synchronization Service with trusted AF
### 7.7.1 General
The solution #7, addresses the Key Issue #1a and #1b, covering the REQ-
CH_ETS-02.
The TS 23.501 [3] clause 4.4.8.3 states that if the AF is considered to be
trusted by the operator, the AF could interact directly with TSCTSF. The TS
23.502 [4], clause 5.2.27, describes the TSCTSF services that either the AF or
NEF can consume:
\- Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_: create update and delete time synchronization
configuration and to activate and deactivate the time synchronization service,
further described in TS 23.501 [3], clause 5.27.1.8.
\- Ntsctsf_ASTI_: control the 5G access stratum time distribution
configuration, further described in TS 23.501 [3], clause 5.27.1.8.
\- Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_: specific QoS and provide assistance for
handling traffic characterized by TSC QoS parameters, further described in TS
23.503 [5], clause 6.1.3.22.

## 7.8 Solution Evaluation
The solution #1, solution #6 and solution #7 solve the key issue #1a, #1b, #2a
and #2b.
\- Solution #1 proposed to reuse the NEF functionality to support the time
synchronization service exposure charging. The AF invokes the TSC and TS
services via NEF when the AF is considered to not be trusted by the operator.
For the trusted AF, the NEF cannot trigger the charging because the service
interactions are directly from trusted AF to the TSCTSF.
\- Solution #6 proposed to add a new TSCTSF(CTF). The AF invokes the TSCTSF
service directly or via NEF based on the whether the AF is considered to be
trusted by the operator or not. The TSCTSF(CTF) charging can be supported for
the enabler of TSC and TS charging when the AF is trusted party or not-trusted
party.
\- Solution #7 proposed to trusted AF to support the times sensitive
communication and time synchronization service invocation charging. If the AF
is considered to not be trusted by the operator, the AF(CTF) does not work.
The solution #4 and solution #5 solve the key issue #3a and #3b.
\- Solution #4 proposed to reuse the SMF to identify TSC traffic and support
data connectivity charging for TSN Station to TSN station
\- Solution #5 proposed to reuse the SMF to identify TSC traffic and support
data connectivity charging for TSN Station to TSN system.
The solution #2 and solution #3 solve the key issue #4a, #4b, #4c and #4d.
\- Solution #2 proposed to reuse the SMF for the 5GS bridge information and
configuration reporting, which is different from the SMF current supported
functionality, data connectivity. The SMF should distinguish the 5GS bridge
management and configuration charging information from the usage reporting.
\- Solution #3 proposed to add a new TSN AF (CTF) for the 5GS bridge
management and configuration charging reporting.
## 7.9 Solution conclusions
For key issue #1a, #1b, #2a and #2b, the solution #1 and solution #6 proposed
to be selected for normative work. The enhancement of NEF charging specified
in TS 32.254 [9] for solution #1 is required.
For key issue #3a and #3b, the solution # 4 and #5 proposed to be selected for
normative work. The enhancement of SMF charging specified in TS 32.255 [10]
for solution #4 and #5 is required.
For key issue #4a, #4b, #4c and #4d, the solution #3 proposed to be selected
for normative work.
A new charging specification is concluded to specify the new consumer
TSCTSF(CTF).
