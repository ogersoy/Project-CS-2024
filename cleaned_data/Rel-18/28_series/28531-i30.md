# 4 General
## 4.1 Overview
A 5G system consists of a 5G Access Network (AN), and a 5G Core Network (5GC).
Network slicing is one of the key 5G features.
The management aspects of a Network Slice Instance (NSI) are described by the
four phases shown in Figure 4.3.1.1 of TS 28.530 [4].
The provisioning of network slicing includes the four phases which are
preparation, commissioning, operation and decommissioning:
\- In the preparation phase the NSI does not exist. The preparation phase
includes network slice design, on-boarding, evaluation of the network slice
requirements, preparing the network environment and other necessary
preparations required to be done before the creation of an NSI.
\- During the NSI lifecycle stage which include commissioning phase, operation
phase and decommissioning phase, the NSI provisioning operations include:
\- Create an NSI;
\- Activate an NSI;
\- Deactivate an NSI;
\- Modify an NSI;
\- Terminate an NSI.
The operations of the provisioning of an NSI occurs during different phases of
a NSI:
a) During the commissioning phase:
\- Create an NSI.
> During NSI creation all resources to the NSI have been created and
> configured to satisfy the network slice requirements. NSI creation may
> trigger NSSI(s) creation or using existing NSSI(s) and setting up the
> corresponding associations.
b) During the operation phase:
\- Activate an NSI;
\- Modify an NSI;
\- Deactivate an NSI.
NSI activation includes any actions that make the NSI active to provide
communication services. NSI activation may trigger NSSI activation.
NSI modification in operation phase could map to several workflows, e.g.
changes of NSI capacity, changes of NSI topology, NSI reconfiguration. NSI
modification can be triggered by receiving new network slice related
requirements, new communication service requirements, or the result of NSI
supervision automatically. NSI modification may trigger NSSI modification.
The NSI deactivation operation may be needed before NSI modification operation
and the NSI activation operation may be needed after the NSI modification
operation. NSI deactivation includes any actions that make the NSI inactive
and not providing any communication services. NSI deactivation trigger NSSI
deactivation to deactivate constituent NSSI(s) which is not used by other
NSI(s). Operator may decide to keep the NSI without termination after
deactivation and reactivate it when receives new communication service
request.
c) During the decommissioning phase:
\- Terminate an NSI.
> NSI termination step includes any action that make the NSI does not exist
> anymore and release resources that are not used by other NSI(s). NSI
> termination may trigger NSSI termination to terminate constituent NSSI(s)
> which is not used by other NSI(s).
Similarly, provisioning for network slice subnet instance includes the
following operations:
\- Create an NSSI;
\- Activate an NSSI and associate it with certain NSI to be used by the NSI;
\- Disassociate the NSSI with certain NSI and deactivate the NSSI if it's not
associated with any NSI;
\- Modify an NSSI;
\- Terminate an NSSI.
## 4.2 Configuration information for the constituents of an NSI
To use network slice to support communication service or deliver a network
slice as a service, the 3GPP defined constituents of the NSI should be
configured by 3GPP management system according to the types and requirements
of the network slice so that the NSI can be operated and maintained.
The configuration information of these components may include:
_\- Information on the requirements to be applied to every NSI constituent to
satisfy the requirements of multiple NSIs_ if the constituent is shared by
multiple NSIs;
_\- Network function selection information:_ Information on the selection of
the NFs (e.g., AMF) according to the requirements of this NSI;
_\- Connection information_ : _The information of the logical links to carry
the NSI's CP and UP data between the component and other NFs and NSSIs
belonging to the NSI._
NOTE 1: The list of information above is not exhaustive.
NOTE 2: The list of information above is not all necessary for an NSI.
## 4.3 General information for network slice instance
The general information used to describe a network slice instance may include:
\- Resource model information, which describes the static parameters and
functional components of network slice, includes service profile, network
slice type (e.g. eMBB), additional system feature (e.g. multicast, Edge
Computing), priority.
\- Management model information, which describes the information model that is
used for network slice lifecycle management, includes configuration profile
(e.g. application configuration parameters).
\- Capability model information, which describes the capability including
supported communication service characteristic information (e.g. service type,
UE mobility level, density of users, traffic density), QoS attributes (e.g.
bandwidth, latency, throughput and so on) and capacity (e.g. maximum number of
UEs), can be exposed to CSC .
## 4.4 General information for network slice subnet instance
The general information used to describe a network slice subnet instance may
include:
\- Resource model information, which describes the static parameters and
functional component of network slice subnet, includes slice profile, network
slice subnet type (e.g. RAN eMBB, CN eMBB), additional system feature (e.g.
multicast, Edge Computing), priority, QoS attributes (e.g. bandwidth, latency,
number of subscribers and so on), NSD ID.
\- Management model information, which describes the information model that is
used for network slice subnet lifecycle management, includes configuration
profile (e.g. application configuration parameters).
\- Capability model information, which describes the capability including
supported communication service characteristic information (e.g. service type,
UE mobility level, density of users, traffic density), QoS attributes (e.g.
bandwidth, latency, throughput and so on) and capacity (e.g. maximum number of
UEs).

A network slice provisioning management service provider.\  
A network slice subnet provisioning management service provider.
**Assumptions** N/A
**Pre-conditions** N/A
**Begins when** The network slice provisioning management service provider
receives the request indicating that an existing NSI is no longer needed to
support a particular service. (identified by service profile Id) The NSI
identification is included in the request.
**Step 1 (M)** Based on the request, the network slice provisioning management
service provider deletes the corresponding slice profile and checks if there
are other services to be supported by the NSI. If there are none the network
slice provisioning management service provider may decide to terminate the
NSI; then proceed to Step 2.\ NSI modification use case Otherwise, the network
slice provisioning management service provider may decide to trigger to modify
the NSI or to do nothing.\  
The use case is completed; go to step 5.
**Step 2 (M)** If the NSI to be terminated is active, the network slice
provisioning management service provider de-activates the NSI. Then, the NSI
to be terminated is inactive. NSI de-activation use case
**Step 3 (M)** The network slice provisioning management service provider
identifies the network slice subnet instances used by the NSI, and for every
such NSSI sends the request to the corresponding network slice subnet
provisioning management service provider (s) indicating that the NSSI(s) are
no longer needed for the NSI. The network slice subnet provisioning management
service provider (s) may decide to terminate or modify the NSSI(s) based on
the request and disassociates them with the NSI.
**Step 4 (M)** The network slice provisioning management service provider
receives the response from the network slice subnet provisioning management
service provider (s) and terminates the NSI.
**Step 5 (M)** The network slice provisioning management service provider
notifies its consumer of the NSI deallocation.

subnet provisioning management service provider activates the NSSI constituent
directly.
**Step 3 (M)** If an NSSI constituent is managed by other network slice subnet
provisioning management service provider, the network slice subnet
provisioning management service provider requests other network slice subnet
provisioning management service provider to activate the constituent NSSI.
**Step 4 (M)** If an NSSI constituent is an NF managed by NF related
provisioning management service provider, the network slice subnet
provisioning management service provider request the NF related provisioning
management service provider to activate the NF (e.g., activate the NF in sleep
mode, turn on the ports).
**Step 5 (M)** The network slice subnet provisioning management service
provider receives response indicating that NSSI constituents are all

* * *
Use case stage Evolution/Specification \>\ Related use
**Goal** To check the feasibility of provisioning a network slice subnet to
determine whether network slice subnet requirements can be satisfied at a
particular point of time (e.g., in terms of resources)
**Actors and Roles** Network slice subnet management service consumer. For
example, when a network slice subnet instance is to be provided as a
constituent of a network slice instance.
**Telecom resources** Network slice subnet instance\  
Network slice management service provider. For example, a management function
that plays the role of network slice management service provider.
**Assumptions** Network slice subnet management service consumer has decided
to check the feasibility of provisioning a network slice subnet based on, for
example, internal decision or to facilitate an external service requests.
**Pre-conditions** Network slice subnet requirements have been derived or
received by network slice subnet management service consumer.
**Begins when** Network slice subnet management service provider receives the
request to evaluate the feasibility of provisioning a network slice subnet
according to the network slice requirements at a particular point in time.
**Step 1 (M)** Network slice subnet management service provider identifies the
network slice subnets constituents according to the requirements, e.g.,
network services to be requested from MANO.
**Step 2 (O)** For the purpose of checking the feasibility of provisioning a
network slice subnet(s) of the network slice instance, network slice subnet
management service provider(s) may obtain information from the network (e.g.,
current or predicted load level information, current or predicted resource
usage information from management data analytics services).
**Step 3 (M)** Network slice subnet management service provider sends
enquiries with reservation requests to other management providers (e.g., MANO)
to determine availability of network constituents, e.g., network services,
network functions. If some of the responses are negative, network slice subnet
management service provider may send enquiries to different management
providers.
**Ends when** Feasibility check results have been provided to network slice
subnet management service consumer.
**Exceptions** One of the mandatory steps fails.
**Post-conditions** N/A

# 7 Provisioning procedures of networks and network slicing
## 7.1 General
The procedures of provisioning of 5G networks are listed in this following
subclauses.
## 7.2 Procedure of Network Slice Instance Allocation
The Figure 7.2-1 illustrates the procedure of creating a new NSI or using an
existing NSI to satisfy the required network slice related requirements.
{width="6.242361111111111in" height="9.92361111111111in"}
Figure 7.2-1: Network Slice Instance Allocation Request procedure
1a-1) Network Slice Management Service Provider (NSMS_P) receives an
AllocateNsi request (see AllocateNsi operation defined in clause 6.5.1) from
Network Slice Management Service Consumer (NSMS_C) with network slice related
requirements (the network slice related requirements are defined as the
attributes in the ServiceProfile see clause 6.3.3 in TS 28.541 [6]).
1a-2) The NSMS_P creates an NetworkSliceController MOI and configures
attribute serviceProfileId to control and monitor network slice allocation
process. NSMS_P starts to perform the network slice allocation process.
1a-3) The NSMS_P sends AllocateNsi response to the NSMS_C. The
serviceProfileId is included in the AllocateNsi response.
1a-4) NSMS_P sends notification (see notfyMOICreation defined in TS 28.532
[8]) to NSMS_C to notify the DN of the created NetworkSliceController
instance.
1b-1) NSMS_P receives a createMOI request (see createMOI operation defined in
TS 28.532 [8]) from NSMS_C with network slice controller (see
NetworkSliceController IOC and its attribute defined in TS 28.541[6])
including the network slice related requirements in attribute
inputServiceProfile.
1b-2) The NSMS_P creates an MOI of NetworkSliceController.
1b-3) The NSMS_P sends the response to NSMS_C for the createMOI request.
NOTE: Network slice allocation may be initiated using AllocateNsi operation as
described in steps 1a or createMOI operation as described in 1b.
2) Based on the network slice related requirements and the knowledge of the
capabilities of existing deployed network slices, the NSMS_P may compare/match
_the provided requirements against all the candidate_ NetworkSlice _MOIs, and_
then decides whether to use an existing NetworkSlice _MOI_ or create a new
NetworkSlice _MOI_. If the network slice related requirements allow the
requested NetworkSlice _MOI_ to be shared and if an existing suitable
NetworkSlice _MOI_ can be reused, the NSMS_P may decide to use the existing
NetworkSlice _MOI_.
3a-1) If using an existing NetworkSlice MOI, _the NSMS__ P _identifies the_
NetworkSlice MOI _to be re-used._
3a-2) The NSMS_P configures NetworkSlice MOI with the DN of
NetworkSliceController MOI.
3a-3) NSMS_P configures the NetworkSliceController MOI attribute
networkSliceRef with DN of NetworkSlice MOI (identified in step 3a-1).
3a-4) If the existing NetworkSlice MOI needs to be modified to satisfy the
network slice related requirements, the NSMS_P invokes the procedure of
network slice instance modification as described in clause 7.6.
3b-1) If creating a new NetworkSlice MOI, the NSMS_P derives the network slice
subnet related requirements from the received network slice related
requirements. Before NSMS_P derives the network slice subnet related
requirements, NSMS_P may invoke corresponding network slice subnet capability
information querying procedure as described in clause 7.8.
3b-2) The NSMS_P invokes the procedure of network slice subnet instance
allocation as described in clause 7.3. Before NSMS_P invokes the procedure,
NSMS_P may invoke corresponding procedure of feasibility check and reservation
of network slice subnet as described in clause 7.14.
3b-3) The NSMS_P creates the NetworkSlice MOI and configures the DN of
NetworkSliceSubnet MOI and DN of NetworkSliceController MOI, other
configuration information may be configured for the created NetworkSlice MOI.
Note: The detailed configuration information is described in network slice NRM
(see NetworkSlice IOC defined in clause 6.3.1 in TS 28.541 [6]).
3a-5) NSMS_P configures the NetworkSliceController MOI attribute
networkSliceRef with DN of NetworkSlice MOI (created in step 5b-1).
4) NSMS_P configures NetworkSliceController MOI attributes operationalState,
administrativeState, availabilityStatus and processMonitor to indicate
completion of the procedure.
The NSMS_C may check the status and completion of the network slice allocation
procedure any time by monitoring the values of NetworkSliceController MOI
attributes operationalState, administrativeState, availabilityStatus and
processMonitor by querying the values or by subscribing to notifications.
The following step 5 describes the procedures for NSMS_C to monitor network
slice allocation progress and result. These steps can happen anytime after the
NetworkSliceController MOI is created and its DN is notified to the NSMS_C
(step 1a-1 or step 1b-3).
5a) The NSMS_P sends notification (see notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges defined
in TS 28.532 [8]) to NSMS_C to notify the progress and result for network
slice allocation process (see attributes in NetworkSliceController IOC).
5b) The NSMS_P sends query request to NSMS_P to query the attribute values of
NetworkSliceController MOI (see getMOIAttributes operation defined in TS
28.532 [8]) to obtain the progress and result (including DN of the
NetworkSlice MOI) for network slice allocation process.
## 7.3 Procedure of Network Slice Subnet Instance Allocation
The Figure 7.3-1 illustrates the procedure of creating a new network slice
subnet instance or using an existing network slice subnet instance to satisfy
the required network slice subnet related requirements.
{width="5.340277777777778in" height="9.915972222222223in"}
Figure 7.3-1: Network Slice Subnet Instance Allocation Request procedure
1a-1) Network Slice Subnet Management Service Provider (NSSMS_P) receives an
AllocateNssi request (see AllocateNssi operation defined in clause 6.5.2) from
Network Slice Subnet Management Service Consumer NSSMS_C with network slice
subnet related requirements (network slice subnet related requirements defined
in SliceProfile see clause 6.3.4 in TS 28.541 [6]).
1a-2) The NSSMS_P creates an MOI of NetworkSliceSubnetController and
configures attribute sliceProfileId to control and monitor network slice
subnetallocation process. NSSMS_P starts to perform the network slice subnet
allocation process.
1a-3) The NSSMS_P sends AllocateNssi response to the NSSMS_C. The
sliceProfileId is included in the AllocateNssi response.
1a-4) NSSMS_P sends notification (see notfyMOICreation defined in TS 28.532
[8]) to NSSMS_C to notify the DN of the created NetworkSliceSubnetController
instance.
1b-1) NSSMS_P receives a createMOI request (see createMOI operation defined in
TS 28.532 [8]) from NSSMS_C with network slice subnet controller (see
NetworkSliceSubnetController IOC and its attribute defined in TS 28.541[6]))
including the network slice subnet related requirements in attribute
inputSliceProfile.
1b-2) The NSSMS_P creates an MOI of NetworkSliceSubnetController.
1b-3) The NSSMS_P sends the response to NSSMS_C for the createMOI request.
NOTE: Network slice subnet allocation may be initiated using AllocateNssi
operation as described in steps 1a or createMOI operation as described in 1b.
2) NSSMS_P may invoke corresponding procedure of feasibility check and
reservation of network slice subnet as described in clause 7.14. If the
network slice subnet related requirements can be satisfied, the following step
3) to step 5) are needed, else go to step 6).
3) Based on the network slice subnet related requirements and the existing
NetworkSliceSubnet MOI capabilities, NSSMS_P decides whether to use an
existing NetworkSliceSubnet MOI or create a new NetworkSliceSubnet MOI. If the
network slice subnet related requirements allow the requested
NetworkSliceSubnet MOI to be shared and if an existing suitable
NetworkSliceSubnet MOI can be reused, the NSSMS_P decides to use the existing
NetworkSliceSubnet MOI.
4a-1) If using an existing NetworkSliceSubnet MOI, _the NSSMS__ P _identifies
the_ NetworkSliceSubnet MOI _to be re-used._
4a-2) The _NSSMS_ _P configures NetworkSliceSubnet MOI (attribute
networkSliceSubnetControllerRef) with the DN of NetworkSliceSubnetController
MOI.
4a-3) NSSMS_P configures the NetworkSliceSubnetController MOI (attribute
networkSliceSubnetRef) with DN of NetworkSliceSubnet MOI (identified in step
4a-1).
4a-4) If the existing NetworkSliceSubnet MOI needs to be modified to satisfy
the network slice subnet related requirements, the NSSMS_P invokes the
procedure of network slice subnet instance modification as described in clause
7.7.
4b-1) If using a new NetworkSliceSubnet MOI, the _NSSMS_ _P creates an MOI of
NetworkSliceSubnet. The _NSSMS_ _P configures NetworkSlice MOI (attribute
networkSliceSubnetControllerRef) with DN of NetworkSliceSubnetController MOI.
4b-2) NSSMS_P configures the NetworkSliceSubnetController MOI (attribute
networkSliceSubnetRef) with DN of NetworkSliceSubnet MOI (identified in step
4b-1).
4b-3) NSSMS_P derives the corresponding network slice subnet constituent
(i.e., NF constituent NetworkSliceSubnet) related requirements and transport
network related requirements (e.g., 3GPP endpoint information, latency
requirements, bandwidth requirements and isolation requirements) from the
received network slice subnet related requirements. Part of these requirements
may be referenced by attribute epTransportRef as defined in clause 6.3.2.2 in
TS 28.541[6]. Before NSSMS_P derives the constituent network slice subnet
related requirements, NSSMS_Provider may invoke corresponding network slice
subnet capability information querying procedure as described in clause 7.8.2.
4b-4) If the NetworkSliceSubnet MOI contains virtualisation part (i.e. VNF or
VL), NSSMS_P derives the NS instance instantiation information (the NS
instance instantiation information is described in clause 7.3.2.2 and clause
7.3.3.2 [3]) based on network slice subnet related requirements. NSSMS_P
determines new VNF instance(s) that need to be deployed and the existing VNF
instance(s) that need to be reused according to the necessary network
function(s) and then derives the profile of virtual link(s) according to the
connection requirements between the network functions. NSSMS_P chooses a
proper NSD deployment flavour and creates data concerning the SAPs of the NS
instance. NSSMS_P invokes the NS instantiation procedures to create a NS
instance.
Note: NS instantiation procedure is described in TS 28.526 [7].
4b-5) NSSMS_P configures NetworkSliceSubnet MOI attribute nsInfo with NS
instance information.
4b-6) For each required constituent network slice subnet (NetworkSliceSubnet
MOIs), the following step 4b-6a) and 4b-6b) are needed:
4b-6a) NSSMS_P invokes procedure of network slice subnet instance allocation.
4b-6b) NSSMS_P configures NetworkSliceSubnet MOI attribute
networkSliceSubnetRef with DN of NetworkSliceSubnet MOI.
4b-7) For each required constituent NF instance (ManagedFunction MOI), the
following step 4b-7a) and 4b-7b) are needed:
4b-7a) NSSMS_P invokes procedure of NF instance creation described in clause
7.10 or procedure of NF instance modification described in clause 7.11.
4b-7b) NSSMS_P configures NetworkSliceSubnet MOI attribute managedFunctionRef
with DN of ManagedFunction MOI.
4b-8) For each required transport network related requirements, NSSMS_P
invokes corresponding procedure of coordination with relevant TN Manager to
handle the TN part as described in clause 7.9.
5) NSSMS_P configures NetworkSliceSubnetController MOI attributes
operationalState, administrativeState, availabilityStatus and processMonitor
to indicate completion of the procedure.
The NSSMS_C may check the status and completion of the network slice subnet
allocation procedure any time by monitoring the values of
NetworkSliceSubnetController MOI attributes operationalState,
administrativeState, availabilityStatus and processMonitor by querying the
values or by subscribing to notifications.
Following step 6) describes the procedures for NSSMS_C to monitor network
slice allocation progress and result. These steps can happen anytime after the
NetworkSliceSubnetController MOI is created and its DN is notified to the
NSSMS_C (step 1a-4 or step 1b-3).
6a) The NSMS_P sends notification (see notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges defined
in TS 28.532 [8]) to NSMS_C to notify the progress and result for network
slice allocation process (see attributes in NetworkSliceController IOC).
6b) The NSMS_Provider sends query request to NSMS_Provider to query the
attribute value of NetworkSliceController instance to obtain the progress and
result (including DN of the NetworkSlice instance) for network slice
allocation process.

## 7.9.1 Introduction
This clause describes procedures of coordination with TN Manager to handle TN
part supporting network slicing.
NOTE: The present document: addresses interactions with NFVO as TN manager,.
interactions with other types of TN Manager (e.g. Optical, IP bearer transport
network, etc.) have not been addressed.
## 7.9.2 Interaction with NFVO as TN Manager
This clause considers the procedure of interaction between the 3GPP management
system and the NFVO, which behaves as TN Manager, to satisfy the TN related
requirements for the virtual links used in NSSI. The procedure is applicable
to creation and modification of the NSSI.
{width="3.59375in" height="2.0833333333333335in"}

1) Network Slice Management Service Provider (NS MnS Provider) receives a
feasibility check with or without reservation job creation request (see
createMOI operation defined in TS 28.532 [8]) from Network Slice Management
Service Consumer (NS MnS Consumer) with feasibility check and reservation
requirements (including serviceProfile, resourceReservation and
requestedReservationExpiration of FeasibilityCheckAndReservationJob IOC
defined in TS 28.541 [6]). The request is to check whether the network slice
related requirements (i.e., ServiceProfile) can be satisfied and optionally be
requested to be reserved. The resourceReservation attribute in the request may
indicate whether reservation is also requested or not.
2) NS MnS Provider creates the FeasibilityCheckAndReservationJob instance and
configures the attribute \"ServiceProfile\" and other attributes received from
the request and NS MnS Provider starts executing the feasibility check
process.
3) NS MnS Provider sends the feasibility check and reservation job creation
response with the DN of the FeasibilityCheckAndReservationJob instance (see
createMOI operation defined in TS 28.532 [8]) to NS MnS Consumer.
4) NS MnS Provider performs feasibility check locally on whether the resources
are available.
NS MnS Provider may invoke the feasibility check and reservation procedure for
the constituent network slice subnet as described in clause 7.14
5) NS MnS Provider performs resource reservation process when
resourceReservation is True and feasibilityResult is feasible.
6) The NS MnS Consumer may subscribe for the attribute value change
notifications for this specific job or for any of the job(s) created by it to
receive any asynchronous job progress notifications for those job(s). NS MnS
Provider then sends the asynchronous job progress notification for feasibility
check and reservation process with processMonitor attributes.
7) NS MnS Provider sends the final notification with the feasibility check and
reservation status (including feasibilityResult, inFeasibleReason,
resourceReservationStatus, reservationFailureReason, reservationExpiration and
recommendedRequirements of FeasibilityCheckAndReservationJob IOC in TS 28.541
[6]).

Provider any time, to know the feasibility check and reservation job status
and receive the feasibility check and reservation job status.
11-13) NS MnS consumer can request to delete the feasibility check and
reservation job any time and the NS MnS Provider deletes the Job and sends the
Job deletion response. NS MnS Provider will cancel the resource reservation
when the feasibility check and reservation job is deleted.

(see createMOI operation defined in TS 28.532 [8]) from Network Slice Subnet
Management Service Consumer (NSS MnS Consumer) with feasibility check and
reservation requirements (including sliceProfile, resourceReservation and
requestedReservationExpiration defined in FeasibilityCheckAndReservationJob
IOC defined in TS 28.541 [6]). The request is to check whether the network
slice subnet related requirements (i.e. SliceProfile) can be satisfied and
optionally be requested to be reserved. The resourceReservation attribute in
the request may indicate whether reservation is also requested or not.
2) NSS MnS Provider creates the FeasibilityCheckAndReservationJob instance and
configures the attribute \"SliceProfile\" and other attributes received from
the request and NSS MnS Provider starts executing the feasibility check
process.
3) NSS MnS Provider sends the feasibility check and reservation job creation
response for the received DN of theFeasibilityCheckAndReservationJob (see
createMOI operation defined in TS 28.532 [8]) requests to NSS MnS Consumer.
4) NSS MnS Provider performs feasibility check locally (e.g 3GPP MnFs) on
whether the resources are available.
NSS MnS Provider may optionally perform feasibility check with other entities
in control of the network slice subnet constituents (e.g., MANO, TN Manager)
of the network slice subnet.
5) NSS MnS Provider performs resource reservation process when
resourceReservation is True and feasibilityResult is feasible.
6) The NSS MnS Consumer may subscribe for the attribute value change
notifications for this specific job or for any of the job(s) created by it to
receive any asynchronous job progress notifications for those job(s). NSS MnS
Provider then sends the asynchronous job progress notification for feasibility
check and reservation process with processMonitor attributes.
7) NSS MnS Provider sends the final notification with the feasibility check
and reservation status (including feasibilityResult, inFeasibleReason,
resourceReservationStatus, reservationFailureReason, reservationExpiration and
recommendedRequirements defined in FeasibilityCheckAndReservationJob IOC in TS
28.541 [6]).
8-10) Once after step 3, NSS MnS Consumer can send query request to NSS MnS
Provider any time, to know the feasibility check and reservation job status
and receive the feasibility check and reservation job status.
11-13) NSS MnS consumer can request to delete the feasibility check and
reservation job any time and the NSS MnS Provider deletes the Job and sends
the Job deletion response. NSS MnS Provider will cancel the resource
reservation when the feasibility check and reservation job is deleted.

###### ## Annex A (informative): A network slice journey example
The Generic Slice Template (GST) ([9]) provides a standardized list of
attributes that can be used to characterise different types of network slice.
GST is generic and is not tied to any:
\- Type of network slice
\- Agreement between a Network Slice Customer (NSC) and a Network Slice
Provider (NSP).
A Network Slice Type (NEST) is a GST filled with (ranges of) values. There may
be two kinds of NESTs:
\- Standardized NESTs (S-NEST), i.e. NESTs which character attributes are
assigned (ranges of) values by SDOs, working groups, foras, etc. such as e.g.
3GPP, GSMA, 5GAA, 5G-ACIA, etc.;
\- Private NESTs (P-NEST), i.e. NESTs which character attributes are assigned
(ranges of) values by the Network Slice Providers, which are different from
those assigned in S-NESTs.
Network Slice Providers can build their network slice product offering based
on S-NESTs and/or their P-NESTs. For example, a Standardized Network Slice
Type (S-NEST) NST-A, for which the attribute 'Packet delay budget' (see [x] --
clause 3.4.26) value range is between 1 ms and 100 ms, is specified by 3GPP.
Netwok Slice Provider Y may offer e.g. 3 products based on NST-A:
\- Platinum NST-A based network slice product, where the attribute 'Packet
delay budget' (see [x] -- clause 3.4.26) value range is between 1 ms and 10
ms;
\- Gold NST-A based network slice product, where the attribute 'Packet delay
budget' (see [x] -- clause 3.4.26) value range is between 11 ms and 50 ms;
\- Silver NST-A based network slice product, where the attribute 'Packet delay
budget' (see [x] -- clause 3.4.26) value range is between 51 ms and 100 ms.
NSP Y's customers can then order network slice instances from Y's product
catalog, as depicted by Figure A.1.
{width="5.357638888888889in" height="3.061111111111111in"}
Figure A.1: From GST to S-(/P-)NEST based product ordering
1) A Network Slice Customer orders network slice instance to a Network Slice
Provider, based on NSP's product offering, by sending a request to NSP' BSS
2) NSP's BSS receives the request from NSC and translates NSC requirements
into NSP technical parameter values
3) NSP's BSS sends a request to NSP's OSS to provide a network slice instance
which fits NSC's requirements (see Table 6.1-1)
4) NSP's Network Slice Provisioning MnS either creates a new network slice
instance or assigns an already existing network slice instance to NSC's
request
5) NSP's Network Slice Provisioning MnS may have to request the Network Slice
Subnet Provisioning MnS to provide a network slice subnet instance
corresponding to the network slice instance (see Table 6.2-1)
6) NSP's Network Slice Subnet Provisioning MnS may have to create one or more
inner network slice subnet instances
7) NSP's Network Function Provisioning MnS configures VNFs and/or PNFs (see
Table 6.3-1).

Depending on NSP's product offering, NSC can order network slice instances
spanning one or more network domains, e.g.:

instance

###### ## Annex B (informative): General information for network slice related
identifiers
The following network slice related identifiers serve different purposes:
* * *
Identifier Description Identifiers for network slice management purpose  
NetworkSlice identifier To identify a NetworkSlice instance defined in TS
28.530 (see [4]), it is DN of a managed object instance of NetworkSlice IOC,
see TS 28.541 [6] NetworkSliceSubnet identifier To identify a
NetworkSliceSubnet instance defined in TS 28.530 (see [4]), it is DN of a
managed object instance of NetworkSliceSubnet IOC, see TS 28.541 [6]
**Identifiers for network slice signaling purpose**  
NSI ID NSI ID is only for 5GC signaling use, i.e. to identify Core Network
part of a Network Slice instance when multiple Network Slice instances of the
same Network Slice are deployed, and there is a need to differentiate between
them in the 5GC, see clause 3.1 of TS 23.501 [10]. The NRM attribute
cNSIIdList of NRFFunction and NSSFFunction, see TS 28.541 [6], is a list for
NSI ID(s). S-NSSAI To identify Network Slice defined in TS 23.501. Referred to
