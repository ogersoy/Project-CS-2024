# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the stage 3 protocol and data model for common
data types that are used or may be expected to be used by multiple Service
Based Interface APIs supported by the same or different Network Function(s).
The Principles and Guidelines for Services Definition are specified in 3GPP TS
29.501 [2].
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

For example, if only the first feature defined in the feature list is set to
1, the corresponding SupportedFeatures attribute would have a hexadecimal
character value of \"1\", or a string of hexadecimal characters with value of
\"001\" (any amount of 0\'s to the left of the 1 would result into an
equivalent feature list). If we have 32 features defined, and only the last
feature in a feature list is set to 1, the corresponding SupportedFeatures
attribute would have a string of hexadecimal characters with value of
\"80000000\"(see the description of the SupportedFeatures encoding in Table
5.2.2-1).

Table 5.2.3.3-1: Enumeration ChangeType
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | Enumeration value | Description | +===================+=================================================+ | \"ADD\" | This value indicates new attribute has been | | | added to the resourceThe \"ADD\" operation | | | performs one of the following functions, | | | depending upon what the target location | | | references: | | | | | | -If the target location specifies an array | | | index, a new value is inserted into the array | | | at the specified index. | | | | | | -If the target location specifies an object | | | member that does not already exist, a new | | | member is added to the object. | | | | | | -If the target location specifies an object | | | member that does exist, that member\'s value is | | | replaced. | | | | | | The operation object shall contain a \"value\" | | | member whose content specifies the value to be | | | added. For example: | | | | | | { \"op\": \"ADD\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\", | | | \"value\": [ \"foo\", \"bar\" ] } | | | | | | When the operation is applied, the target | | | location shall reference one of: | | | | | | -The root of the target document - whereupon | | | the specified value becomes the entire content | | | of the target document. | | | | | | -A member to add to an existing object - | | | whereupon the supplied value is added to that | | | object at the indicated location. If the member | | | already exists, it is replaced by the specified | | | value. | | | | | | -An element to add to an existing array - | | | whereupon the supplied value is added to the | | | array at the indicated location. Any elements | | | at or above the specified index are shifted one | | | position to the right. The specified index | | | shall not be greater than the number of | | | elements in the array. If the \"-\" character | | | is used to index the end of the array (see | | | IETF RFC 6901 [12]), this has the effect of | | | appending the value to the array. | | | | | | Because this operation is designed to add to | | | existing objects and arrays, its target | | | location will often not exist. Although the | | | pointer\'s error handling algorithm will thus | | | be invoked, this specification defines the | | | error handling behavior for \"ADD\" pointers to | | | ignore that error and add the value as | | | specified. | | | | | | However, the object itself or an array | | | containing it does need to exist, and it | | | remains an error for that not to be the case. | | | For example, an \"ADD\" with a target location | | | of \"/a/b\" starting with this document: | | | | | | { \"a\": { \"foo\": 1 } } | | | | | | is not an error, because \"a\" exists, and | | | \"b\" will be added to its value. It is an | | | error in this document: | | | | | | { \"q\": { \"bar\": 2 } } | | | | | | because \"a\" does not exist. | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | \"MOVE\" | This value indicates existing attribute has | | | been moved to a different path in the resource. | | | | | | The \"MOVE\" operation removes the value at a | | | specified location and adds it to the target | | | location. | | | | | | The operation object shall contain a \"from\" | | | member, which is a string containing a JSON | | | Pointer value that references the location in | | | the target document to move the value from. | | | | | | The \"from\" location shall exist for the | | | operation to be successful. | | | | | | For example: | | | | | | { \"op\": \"MOVE\", \"from\": \"/a/b/c\", | | | \"path\": \"/a/b/d\" } | | | | | | This operation is functionally identical to a | | | \"REMOVE\" operation on the \"from\" location, | | | followed immediately by an \"ADD\" operation at | | | the target location with the value that was | | | just removed. | | | | | | The \"from\" location shall not be a proper | | | prefix of the \"path\" location; i.e., a | | | location cannot be moved into one of its | | | children. | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | \"REMOVE\" | This value indicates existing attribute has | | | been deleted from the resource. | | | | | | The \"REMOVE\" operation removes the value at | | | the target location. | | | | | | The target location shall exist for the | | | operation to be successful. | | | | | | For example: | | | | | | { \"op\": \"REMOVE\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\" } | | | | | | If removing an element from an array, any | | | elements above the specified index are shifted | | | one position to the left. | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | \"REPLACE\" | This value indicates existing attribute has | | | been updated with new value. | | | | | | The \"REPLACE\" operation replaces the value at | | | the target location with a new value. The | | | operation object shall contain a \"value\" | | | member whose content specifies the replacement | | | value. | | | | | | The target location shall exist for the | | | operation to be successful. | | | | | | For example: | | | | | | { \"op\": \"REPLACE\", \"path\": \"/a/b/c\", | | | \"value\": 42 } | | | | | | This operation is functionally identical to a | | | \"REMOVE\" operation for a value, followed | | | immediately by an \"ADD\" operation at the same | | | location with the replacement value. | +-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
