## 5.2 Nnssf_NSSelection Service
### 5.2.1 Service Description
The Nnssf_NSSelection service is used by an NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF or
NSSF in a different PLMN) to retrieve the information related to network slice
in the non-roaming and roaming case.
It also enables the NSSF to provide to the AMF the Allowed NSSAI and the
Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN.
It also enables the NSSF to provide to the AMF the NSAG information associated
with the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN.
The NF service consumer discovers the NSSF based on the local configuration.
The NSSF in a different PLMN is discovered based on the self-constructed FQDN
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [9].

NSSFs of a PLMN that implement AMF reallocation via RAN by supporting the NGAP
REROUTE NAS REQUEST procedure (see clause 8.6.5 of 3GPP TS 38.413 [21]) should
return the target AMF set ID in its response. The NSSF may query the NRF to
discover target AMF Set if this information is not known by other means (e.g.
if not provided by AMF during Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability_Update service
operation).
If subscribed NSSRG list is provided, the NSSF shall provide the compatible
S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI as defined in clause 5.15.12 of 3GPP TS 23.501
[2] and compatible S-NSSAIs in the Target NSSAI (if provided).
If the request indicated that UE does not support subscription-based
restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slice feature, and UDM
has requested to provide all subscribed S-NSSAIs for such UEs, Configured
NSSAI, if included, shall be provided ignoring the NSSRG restrictions.
If the AMF has indicated the support of NSAG by the UE, the NSSF shall include
the \"nsagInfoList\" attribute with NSAG information if available.
2b If no slice instances can be found for the requested slice selection
information or the requested slice mapping information, then the NSSF shall
return a 403 Forbidden response with the \"ProblemDetails\" IE containing the
Application Error \"SNSSAI_NOT_SUPPORTED\" (cf. Table 6.1.7.3-1).
On failure or redirection, the NSSF shall return one of the HTTP status codes
together with the response body listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3.
##### 5.2.2.2.3 Get service operation of Nnssf_NSSelection service during the
PDU session establishment
In this procedure, the NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF) retrieves the NRF and
the optionally the NSI ID of the network slice instance:
Figure 5.2.2.2.3-1: Retrieve the network slice information during the PDU
session establishment procedure
1 The NF Service consumer (e.g. AMF or NSSF in the different PLMN) shall send
a GET request to the NSSF.
The request shall include query parameters, contain at least the following
parameters:
\- S-NSSAI;
\- S-NSSAI from the HPLMN that maps to the S-NSSAI from the Allowed NSSAI of
the Serving PLMN;
\- the NF type of the NF service consumer;
\- Requester ID and;
\- non-roaming/LBO roaming/HR roaming indication.
For the request towards an NSSF in the Serving PLMN, the query parameters
shall also contain the PLMN ID of the SUPI and TAI.
2a On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned when the NSSF is able to find
network slice instance information for the requested network slice selection
information, the response body shall include a payload body containing at
least the NRF to be used to select NFs/services within the selected Network
Slice instance;
2b If no slice instances can be found for the requested slice selection
information, then the NSSF shall return a 403 Forbidden response with the
\"ProblemDetails\" IE containing the Application Error
\"SNSSAI_NOT_SUPPORTED\" (cf. Table 6.1.7.3-1).
On failure or redirection, the NSSF shall return one of the HTTP status codes
together with the response body listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3.
##### 5.2.2.2.4 Get service operation of Nnssf_NSSelection service during UE
configuration update procedure
In this procedure, the NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF) retrieves network slice
configuration information (e.g. the Allowed NSSAI and the Configured NSSAI)
during the UE configuration update procedure.
Figure 5.2.2.2.4-1: Retrieve the network slice information during UE
configuration update procedure
1 The NF Service consumer (e.g. AMF) shall send a GET request to the NSSF. The
request shall include query parameters:
\- Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) with the indication if the S-NSSAI is marked as
default S-NSSAI and the associated subscribed NSSRG information;
\- optionally UE support of subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous
registration of network slice feature Indication;
\- UDM indication to provide all subscribed S-NSSAIs for UEs not indicating
support of subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of
network slices feature;
\- Rejected S-NSSAI(s) for the Registration Area;
\- PLMN ID of the SUPI;
\- TAI;
\- Indication of the support of NSAG by the UE;
\- NF type of the NF service consumer and;

Target NSSAI to redirect the UE to the dedicated frequency band(s) for an
S-NSSAI (as specified in clause 5.3.4.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]), the AMF
provides the Allowed NSSAI and the rejected S-NSSAI(s) for the current
Registration Area to the NSSF; the Allowed NSSAI and Rejected S-NSSAI(s) for
the RA does not include any S-NSSAI that failed for Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization. The AMF does not include the Requested NSSAI
to the NSSF in this procedure, thus the NSSF will not provide Allowed NSSAI
again to the AMF in the response.
2a On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned when the NSSF is able to find
authorized network slice information for the requested network slice selection
information, the response body shall include a payload body containing at
least the following parameters:
\- Allowed NSSAI;
\- Configured NSSAI and;
\- optionally Target NSSAI.
If subscribed NSSRG list is provided, the NSSF shall provide the compatible
S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI as defined in the clause 5.15.12 of 3GPP TS
23.501 [2] and compatible S-NSSAIs in the Target NSSAI(if provided).
If the request indicated that UE does not support subscription-based
restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slice feature, and UDM
has requested to provide all subscribed S-NSSAIs for such UEs, the NSSF shall
provide Configured NSSAI ignoring the NSSRG restrictions.
If the AMF has indicated the support of NSAG by the UE, the NSSF shall include
the \"nsagInfoList\" attribute with NSAG information if available.
2b If no slice instances can be found for the requested slice selection
information, then the NSSF shall return a 403 Forbidden response with the
\"ProblemDetails\" IE containing the Application Error
\"SNSSAI_NOT_SUPPORTED\" (cf. Table 6.1.7.3-1).
On failure or redirection, the NSSF shall return one of the HTTP status codes
together with the response body listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3.
## 5.3 Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability Service
### 5.3.1 Service Description
The Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability service is used by the NF service consumer (e.g
AMF) to update the S-NSSAI(s) the AMF supports on a per TA basis on the NSSF,
subscribe and unsubscribe the notification of any changes to the NSSAI
availability information on a per TA basis, of the S-NSSAIs available per TA
(unrestricted) and the restricted S-NSSAI(s) per PLMN in that TA in the
serving PLMN of the UE.
It also enables the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) to update the NSAG(s)
associated with the S-NSSAI(s) supported by the AMF on a per TA basis.
It also enables the NF service consumer (e.g., AMF, V-NSSF) to receive updates
for Network Slice Replacement and Network Slice Instance Replacement.

\- Subscribe;
\- Unsubscribe;
\- Notify;
\- Delete;
\- Options.
#### 5.3.2.2 Update Service Operation
##### 5.3.2.2.1 General
The Update operation shall be used by an NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF) to
update the NSSF with the S-NSSAIs the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) supports
per TA, and get the availability of the S-NSSAIs per TA for the S-NSSAIs the
NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) supports.
The Update operation may also be used by an NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF) to
update the NSSF with the NSAG(s) associated with the S-NSSAI(s) supported by
the NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF) on per TA basis, and to get the
availability of the NSAG(s) per TA for the NSAG(s) supported by the NF Service
Consumer (e.g. AMF).
Figure 5.3.2.2.1-1: Update the S-NSSAIs the AMF supports per TA
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) shall send a PUT request to the
resource representing the NSSAI Availability information of the individual NF,
identified by the {nfId}, to replace or create the NSSAI Availability
information of the NF.
The payload of the body shall contain the NssaiAvailabilityInfo which contains
one or more representations of the individual supportedSnssai information to
be replaced.
The NssaiAvailabilityInfo in the payload of the body may contain NSAG
information.
The NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) shall send a PATCH request to the resource
representing the NSSAI Availability information of the individual NF,
identified by the {nfId}, to update the NSSAI Availability information of the
NF.
The payload of the body shall contain the PatchDocument which contains one or
more PatchItem instructions for updating the individual supportedSnssai
resources.
The payload of the body may contain the PatchDocument which contains one or
more PatchItem instructions for updating the NSAG information.
2\. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned if Authorized NSSAI
Availability is empty after the update; otherwise, \"200 OK\" shall be
returned, the payload body of the PUT/PATCH response shall contain the
representation describing the status of the request and the complete
AuthorizedNssaiAvailabilityData information representing the current state of
the AuthorizedNssaiAvailabilityInfo.
If there is no supported S-NSSAIs authorized by the NSSF for the TA, the NSSF
shall not return the AuthorizedNssaiAvailabilityData for the corresponding TA
in the response.
On failure or redirection, the NSSF shall return one of the HTTP status code
together with the response body listed in Table 6.2.3.2.3.1-2 / Table
6.2.3.2.3.2-2.
#### 5.3.2.3 Subscribe Service Operation
##### 5.3.2.3.1 Creation of a subscription
The Subscribe Operation is used by a NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF, V-NSSF) to
subscribe to a notification of Network Slice Replacement, Network Slice
Instance Replacement and/or of any changes in status of the NSSAI availability
information (e.g. S-NSSAIs available per TA and the restricted S-NSSAI(s) per
PLMN in that TA in the serving PLMN of the UE) upon this is updated by another
AMF.
Figure 5.3.2.3.1-1 Create a subscription
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to create a subscription
resource in the NSSF. The payload body of the POST request shall contain a
representation of the individual event subscription resource to be created in
the NssfEventSubscriptionCreateData.
The request shall indicate the type(s) of events for which the subscription is
created, i.e., Network Slice Replacement, Network Slice Instance Replacement
and/or of any changes in status of the NSSAI availability information.
The request may contain an expiry time, suggested by the NF Service Consumer
as a hint, representing the time upto during which the subscription is desired
to be kept active and describes the maximum duration after which the
subscribed event shall stop generating report.
The request may also indicate a specific AMF Set to restrict the subscriptions
to notifications applicable to the AMF Set (i.e. notifications related to
S-NSSAIs supported by the AMF Set). If the AMF Set is provided and the NSSF
support the \"SATAS\" feature (see clause 6.2.8), the NF Service Consumer may
also indicate that the subscription is for all TAI(s) associated with the AMF
Set.
If the service operation is invoked for subscription to Network Slice
Replacement notification, then the request shall contain:
\- for VPLMN S-NSSAI: the list of S-NSSAIs in the VPLMN served by the NF
Service Consumer that may be replaced with, the NF type of the NF Service
Consumer (e.g., AMF) and the NF instance ID of the requester NF.
\- for HPLMN S-NSSAI: the list of S-NSSAIs in the HPLMN that the S-NSSAI may
be replaced with, the NF type of the NF Service Consumer (e.g., AMF, V-NSSF),
the NF instance ID of the requester NF and the HPLMN ID.
If the service operation is invoked for subscription to Network Slice Instance
Replacement notification, then the request shall contain:
\- the list of S-NSSAIs and/or the list of NSI IDs that may become congested
or no longer available.
2\. On success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned, and the payload body of the
POST response shall contain the representation describing the status of the
created subscription in NssfEventSubscriptionCreatedData.
For a subscription to any changes in status of the NSSAI availability
information, the NssfEventSubscriptionCreatedData may contain the
AuthorizedNssaiAvailabilityData information, if available.
If there is no supported S-NSSAIs authorized by the NSSF for the TA, the NSSF
shall not return the AuthorizedNssaiAvailabilityData for the corresponding TA
in the response.
The Location header shall contain the location (URI) of the created
subscription resource.
The response, based on operator policy and taking into account the expiry time
included in the request, may contain the expiry time, as determined by the
NSSF, after which the subscription becomes invalid. Once the subscription
expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, it
shall create a new subscription in the NSSF. The NSSF shall not provide the
same expiry time for many subscriptions in order to avoid all of them expiring
and recreating the subscription at the same time. If the expiry time is not
included in the response, the NF Service Consumer shall consider the
subscription to be valid without an expiry time.
On failure or redirection, the NSSF shall return one of the HTTP status code
together with the response body listed in Table 6.2.3.3.3.1-2.
##### 5.3.2.3.2 Modification of a subscription
The Subscribe Operation may be used by a NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF,
V-NSSF) towards an NSSF supporting the SUMOD feature, when it needs to modify
an existing subscription previously created by itself.
The NF Service Consumer shall modify the subscription by using HTTP method
PATCH with the URI of the individual subscription resource to be modified.
Figure 5.3.2.3.2-1 Modify a subscription
1\. The NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF, V-NSSF) shall send a PATCH request to
the resource URI identifying the individual subscription resource. The payload
of the body shall contain the PatchDocument which contains one or more
PatchItem instructions for updating the subscription data.
The NF Service Consumer shall not change the event IE included in the
NssfEventSubscriptionCreateData by invoking the PATCH request message.
For a subscription to any changes in status of the NSSAI availability
information, the taiList IE may only be set to an empty array in PATCH request
if the NF service consumer and NSSF support the ONSSAI feature.
2\. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned, the payload body of the PATCH
response shall contain the representation describing the updated subscription
in NssfEventSubscriptionCreatedData.
For a subscription to any changes in status of the NSSAI availability
information, if there is no supported S-NSSAIs authorized by the NSSF for the
TA, the NSSF shall not return the AuthorizedNssaiAvailabilityData for the
corresponding TA in the response.
On failure or redirection, the NSSF shall return one of the HTTP status code
together with the response body listed in Table 6.2.3.4.3.2-2.
#### 5.3.2.4 Unsubscribe Service Operation
##### 5.3.2.4.1 General
The Unsubscribe Operation is used by a NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF, V-NSSF)
to unsubscribe to a notification of any previously subscribed changes to the
NSSAI availability information, Network Slice Replacement and/or Network Slice
Instance Replacement.
Figure 5.3.2.4.1-1 Unsubscribe a subscription
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request to delete an existing
subscription resource in the NSSF.
2\. If the request is accepted, the NSSF shall respond with the status code
204 indicating the resource identified by subscription ID is successfully
deleted.
On failure or redirection, the NSSF shall return one of the HTTP status code
together with the response body listed in Table 6.2.3.4.3.1-2.
#### 5.3.2.5 Notify Service Operation
##### 5.3.2.5.1 General
The Notify Service operation shall be used by the NSSF to update the NF
Service Consumer (e.g. AMF) with any change in status, on a per TA basis, of
the S-NSSAIs available per TA (unrestricted) and the S-NSSAIs restricted per
PLMN in that TA in the serving PLMN of the UE. The service operation is also
used to notify the NF Service Consumer (e.g., AMF, V-NSSF) of Network Slice
Replacement and/or Network Slice Instance Replacement.
Figure 5.3.2.5.1-1: Update the AMF with any S-NSSAIs restricted per TA
1\. The NSSF shall send a POST request to the resource representing the NSSF
availability resource in the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF, V-NSSF). The
payload body of the POST request shall contain the one representations of the
individual NssfEventNotification resource.
For a subscription to any changes in status of the NSSAI availability
information:
\- If there is no supported S-NSSAIs authorized by the NSSF for the TA, the
NSSF shall not return the AuthorizedNssaiAvailabilityData for the
corresponding TA in the notification.
\- If there is no supported S-NSSAIs authorized by the NSSF for all TAs and
the NF Service Consumer has indicated support of \"EANAN\" feature, the NSSF
shall set authorizedNssaiAvailabilityData attribute to an empty array.
For a subscription to Network Slice Instance Replacement:
\- If the NSSF supports the NSIUN feature (see clause 6.2.8) and if the
Network Slice instance becomes no longer available, the NSSF shall notify the
NF Service Consumer (e.g., AMF, V-NSSF) having subscribed to this event for
the related S-NSSAI and/or NSI ID that the NSI is no longer available. In that
case, the POST request from the NSSF shall contain the list of S-NSSAIs and
the associated NSI IDs for which the status is changed (e.g., which become
congested or no longer available). The request may also contain congestion
mitigation information.
For a subscription to Netwok Slice Replacement:
\- If the NSSF supports the NSRP feature (see clause 6.2.8) and if the NSSF
detects that an S-NSSAI becomes unavailable (e.g., based on OAM or NWDAF
analytics output), the NSSF shall send Network Slice Replacement for the
S-NSSAI to the NF service consumer if the NF service consumer has subscribed
to this event for the related S-NSSAI. The notification shall include an
alternative S-NSSAI which can be used by the NF service consumer to replace
the unavailable S-NSSAI. In case of roaming, the notification shall include:
\- for VPLMN S-NSSAI replacement: the alternative VPLMN S-NSSAI for the
S-NSSAI and the corresponding mapping to the S-NSSAI to be replaced.
\- for HPLMN S-NSSAI replacement: the alternative HPLMN S-NSSAI for the
S-NSSAI and the corresponding mapping to the HPLMN S-NSSAI to be replaced and
the HPLMN ID.
\- The NSSF shall notify the NF service consumer when the S-NSSAI becomes
available again. The notification shall contain:
\- an indication to stop Network Slice replacement for new UEs; or
\- an indication to terminate Network Slice Replacement for all the UEs and
move back the PDU sessions from the alternative S-NSSAI to the S-NSSAI.
If the notification is triggered by the AMF that updates the supported
S-NSSAIs per TA by using the Update operation, the NSSF shall not send the
notification to the same AMF.
2\. On success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned and the payload body of
the POST response shall be empty.
On failure or redirection, the NF service consumer shall return one of the
HTTP status code together with the response body listed in Table
6.2.5.2.3.1-2.
#### 5.3.2.6 Delete Service Operation
##### 5.3.2.6.1 General
The Delete Service operation shall be used by the NF service consumer (e.g.
AMF) to delete the NSSAI availability information stored for the NF service
consumer in the NSSF.
Figure 5.3.2.6.1-1: Delete the NSSAI Availability Information at NSSF
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) shall send a DELETE request to remove
the NSSAI availability information for the NF service consumer represented by
the {nfId} (e.g. AMF ID).
2\. The NSSF shall delete the NSSAI Availability information for the
individual AMF and shall return the 204 No Content status code.
On failure or redirection, the NSSF shall return one of the HTTP status code
together with the response body listed in Table 6.2.3.2.3.3-2.
#### 5.3.2.7 Options Service Operation
##### 5.3.2.7.1 General
The Options service operation is used by a NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF) to
discover the communication options supported by the NSSF for the resource.

### 6.1.8 Feature negotiation
The feature negotiation mechanism specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] shall be used to negotiate the optional features applicable between the
NSSF and the NF Service Consumer, for the Nnssf_NSSelection service, if any.
The NF Service Consumer shall indicate the optional features it supports for
the Nnssf_NSSelection service, if any, by including the supportedFeatures
attribute in the HTTP GET request when requesting the NSSF to provide the
Allowed NSSAI information.
The NSSF shall determine the supported features for the requested network
slice information resource as specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]
and shall indicate the supported features by including the supportedFeatures
attribute in the Allowed NSSAI information it returns in the HTTP response.
The syntax of the supportedFeatures attribute is defined in clause 5.2.2 of
3GPP TS 29.571 [7].
The following features are defined for the Nnssf_NSSelection service.
Table 6.1.8-1: Features of supportedFeatures attribute used by

An NF | | | | | Service Consumer that | | | | | does not support this | | | | | feature does only | | | | | support HTTP | | | | | redirection as | | | | | specified for 3GPP | | | | | Release 15. | +-----------------------+-------------+-----+-----------------------+ | 2 | TargetNssai | O | Target NSSAI | | | | | | | | | | An NF Service | | | | | Consumer (e.g. AMF) | | | | | and NSSF that | | | | | supports this feature | | | | | shall support | | | | | handling of Target | | | | | NSSAI as specified in | | | | | clause 5.3.4.3.3 and | | | | | clause 5.15.5.2.1 of | | | | | 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. | +-----------------------+-------------+-----+-----------------------+ | Feature number: The | | | | | order number of the | | | | | feature within the | | | | | s**upportedFeatures | | | | | attribute (starting | | | | | with 1).** | | | | | | | | | | **Feature: A short | | | | | name that can be used | | | | | to refer to the bit | | | | | and to the feature.** | | | | | | | | | | **M/O: Defines if the | | | | | implementation of the | | | | | feature is mandatory | | | | | (** \"**M** \"**) or | | | | | optional | | | | | (** \"**O** \"**).** | | | | | | | | | | Description: A clear | | | | | textual description | | | | | of the feature. | | | | +-----------------------+-------------+-----+-----------------------+
### 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [11] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nnssf_NSSelection API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see
IETF RFC 6749 [12]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [13])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nnssf_NSSelection API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS
29.510 [13], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nnssf_NSSelection service.
The Nnssf_NSSelection API does not define any scopes for OAuth2 authorization.
### 6.1.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different NSSF service instance, within
the same NSSF or a different NSSF of an NSSF set, e.g. when an NSSF service
instance is part of an NSSF (service) set or when using indirect
communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See the ES3XX feature in clause
6.1.8.
An SCP that reselects a different NSSF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new NSSF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an NSSF within an NSSF set redirects a service request to a different NSSF
of the set using a 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status
code, the identity of the new NSSF towards which the service request is
redirected shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause
6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
## 6.2 Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability Service API
### 6.2.1 API URI
The Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability service shall use the Nnssf_ NSSAIAvailability
API.
The API URI of the Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/nnssf-** **nssaiavailability/\ **
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards
the NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in
clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/nnssf-** **nssaiavailability/\
/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The **\ ** shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.2.3.
### 6.2.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.2.2.1 General
HTTP/2, IETF RFC 7540 [10], shall be used as specified in clause 5 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
An OpenAPI [6] specification of HTTP messages and content bodies for the
Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability service is specified in Annex A.
#### 6.2.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.2.2.2.1 General
See clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] for the usage of HTTP standard headers.
##### 6.2.2.2.2 Content type
The JSON format shall be supported. The use of JSON format shall be as
specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
The following content types shall be supported:
\- JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [14], shall be used as content type of
the HTTP bodies specified in the present specification as indicated in clause
5.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
\- The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 [15]). The use of the
Problem Details JSON object in a HTTP response body shall be signalled by the
content type \"application/problem+json\".
\- JSON Patch (IETF RFC 6902 [8]). The use of the JSON Patch format in a HTTP
request body shall be signalled by the content type \"application/json-
patch+json\".
##### 6.2.2.2.3 Accept-Encoding
The NSSF should support gzip coding (see IETF RFC 1952 [16]) in HTTP requests
and responses and indicate so in the Accept-Encoding header, as described in
clause 6.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 6.2.2.3 HTTP custom headers
##### 6.2.2.3.1 General
In this release of this specification, no custom headers specific to the
Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability service are defined. For 3GPP specific HTTP custom
headers used across all service based interfaces, see clause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].

RESOURCE_CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND 400 Bad Request Indicates that the NF Service
Consumer (e.g. AMF) received a notification request from NSSF on an existing
callback URI, but the corresponding context does not exist at the NF Service
Consumer. SNSSAI_NOT_SUPPORTED 403 Forbidden The request is rejected due to
the SNSSAI provided in the request is not supported in the PLMN.
NOT_AUTHORIZED 403 Forbidden The request is rejected due to the NF service
consumer is not authorized to update the NSSAI availability information, or
subscribe for the NSSAI availability information notification.
RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found The request is rejected due to the NF service
consumer is authorized, but the resource related to the NF Id for which the
NSSAI availability information is updated or deleted is unavailable.
SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found Indicates the modification of
subscription has failed due to an application error when the subscription is
not found in the NSSF. RESOURCE_URI_STRUCTURE_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found
Indicates that the NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF) received a notification
request from NSSF on a callback URI that is not known to the NF Service
Consumer.
### 6.2.8 Feature negotiation
The feature negotiation mechanism specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] shall be used to negotiate the optional features applicable between the
NSSF and the NF Service Consumer, for the Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability service, if
any.
The NF Service Consumer shall indicate the optional features it supports for
the Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability service, if any, by including the
supportedFeatures attribute in the HTTP PUT request when requesting the NSSF
to update the NSSAI Availability information.
The NSSF shall determine the supported features for the updated NSSAI
Availability information resource as specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] and shall indicate the supported features by including the
supportedFeatures attribute in the authorized NSSAI availability information
it returns in the HTTP response.
The syntax of the supportedFeatures attribute is defined in clause 5.2.2 of
3GPP TS 29.571 [7].
The following features are defined for the Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability service.

### 6.2.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [11] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [12]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [13])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [13], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability service.
The Nnssf_NSSAIAvailability API does not define any scopes for OAuth2
authorization.
### 6.2.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different NSSF service instance, within
the same NSSF or a different NSSF of an NSSF set, e.g. when an NSSF service
instance is part of an NSSF (service) set or when using indirect
communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See the ES3XX feature in clause
6.2.8.
An SCP that reselects a different NSSF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new NSSF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an NSSF within an NSSF set redirects a service request to a different NSSF
of the set using a 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status
code, the identity of the new NSSF towards which the service request is
redirected shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause
6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the Nnssf_NSSelection service.
It consists of OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications, in YAML format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1
and 3GPP TR 21.900 [7] clause 5B).
