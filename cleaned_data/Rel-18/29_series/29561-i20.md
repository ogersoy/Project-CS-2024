# 4 Network Characteristics
## 4.1 Key characteristics of PLMN
The PLMN is fully defined in the 3GPP technical specifications. The 5G Network
related key characteristics are defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
## 4.2 Key characteristics of IP Networks
The Internet is a conglomeration of networks utilising a common set of
protocols. IP protocols are defined in the relevant IETF RFCs. The networks
topologies may be based on LANs (e.g. Ethernet), Point to Point leased lines,
PSTN, ISDN, X.25 or WANs using switched technology (e.g. SMDS, ATM).
## 4.3 Key characteristics of Ethernet
The Ethernet is a family of computer networking technologies commonly used in
LAN and is often used to refer to all Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision
Detection (CSMA/CD) LANs that generally conform to Ethernet Specifications,
including IEEE 802.3 [36]. The key characteristics for Ethernet are defined in
IEEE 802.3 [36].
# 5 Interworking Classifications
## 5.1 Service Interworking
Service interworking is required when the Teleservice at the calling and
called terminals are different. No service interworking is specified in this
specification.
## 5.2 Network Interworking
Network interworking is required whenever a PLMN is involved in communications
with another network to provide end-to-end communications. The PLMN shall
interconnect in a manner consistent with that of a normal Data Network (type
defined by the requirements e.g. IP). Interworking appears exactly like that
of Data Networks.
# 6 Reference Architecture
Figure 6-1 shows the access interfaces for the 5G Network. Figure 6-2 shows
the access interfaces for the 5G and EPC interworking network.
The 5G Network includes both the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access.
The NSS-AAA may belong to the H-PLMN in the 5G Network (without AAA-P
interworking) or a 3rd party (with AAA-P interworking).
Figure 6-1: Reference Architecture for 5G Network Interworking
Figure 6-2: Reference Architecture for 5G and EPC Interworking
NOTE 1: The SMF represents the H-SMF and the SMF+PGW-C represents the H-SMF+
H-PGW-C in the home routed scenario.
NOTE 2: If the DN-AAA server or the DHCP server located in 5GC or in the
external PDN is reachable directly, then the SMF or SMF+PGW-C can communicate
with the DN-AAA server directly without involving the UPF or UPF+PGW-U,
applicable to all the message flows on N6 interface in clause 11 and clause 12
in this specification.
NOTE 3: In the follow clauses, the description on SMF also apples to
SMF+PGW-C, the description on UPF also applies to UPF+PGW-U, unless otherwise
specified.
# 7 Interface to 5G Network services (User Plane)
The user plane for 5G Network services is defined in clause 8.3 of 3GPP TS
23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 29.281 [4].
# 8 Interworking with DN (IP)
## 8.1 General
5GS shall support interworking with DNs based on the Internet Protocol (IP).
These interworked networks may be either intranets or the Internet.
## 8.2 DN Interworking Model
### 8.2.1 General
When interworking with the IP networks, the 5GS can operate IPv4 and/or IPv6.
The interworking point is shown in clause 6.
The UPF for interworking with the IP network is the 5GS access point (see
figure 8.2.1-1).
Figure 8.2.1-1: The protocol stacks of UPF for the IP network interworking
Typically, in the IP networks, the interworking with subnetworks is done via
IP routers. The N6 reference point is between the UPF and the external IP
network. From the external IP network\'s point of view, the UPF is seen as a
normal IP router. The L2 and L1 layers are operator specific.
It is out of the scope of the present document to standardise the router
functions and the used protocols in the N6 reference point.
Interworking with user defined ISPs and private/public IP networks is subject
to interconnect agreements between the network operators.
### 8.2.2 Access to DN through 5G Network
#### 8.2.2.1 Transparent access to DN
Figure 8.2.2.1-1: Example of the DN Interworking Model, transparent case
In figure 8.2.2.1-1, an example DN interworking model for transparent access
to the Internet is provided for an UPF in the 5GS and its N6 reference point.
In transparent access to the Internet case:
\- the UE is given an IPv4 address and/or an IPv6 prefix belonging to the
operator addressing space. The IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix is assigned
either at subscription in which case it is a static address or at PDU session
establishment in which case it is a dynamic address. This IPv4 address and/or
IPv6 prefix if applicable is used for packet forwarding between the Internet
and the UPF and within the 5GS. With IPv6, Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
shall be used to assign an IPv6 address to the UE. These procedures are as
described in the IPv6 non-transparent access case except that the addresses
belong to the operator addressing space.
\- the UE need not send any authentication request at PDU session
establishment procedure and the SMF/UPF need not take any part in the user
authentication/authorization process.
The transparent case provides at least a basic ISP service. As a consequence
of this it may therefore provide a QoS flow service for a tunnel to a private
Intranet. The user level configuration may be carried out between the UE and
the intranet, the 5GS is transparent to this procedure. The used protocol
stack is depicted in figure 8.2.2.1-2.
Figure 8.2.2.1-2: Transparent access to an Intranet
The communication between the PLMN and the Intranet may be performed over any
network, even an insecure network e.g. the Internet. There is no specific
security protocol between the UPF and the Intranet because security is ensured
on an end to end basis between the UE and the intranet by the \"Intranet
Protocol\".
User authentication and encryption of user data are done within the \"Intranet
Protocol\" if either of them is needed. This \"Intranet Protocol\" may also
carry private (IP) addresses belonging to the address space of the Intranet.
An example of an \"Intranet Protocol\" is IPsec (see IETF RFC 1825 [29]). If
IPsec is used for this purpose, then IPsec authentication header or security
header may be used for user (data) authentication and for the confidentiality
of user data (see IETF RFC 1826 [30] and IETF RFC 1827 [31]). In this case
private IP tunnelling within public IP takes place.
#### 8.2.2.2 IPv4 Non-transparent access to DN
In this case:
\- a static or a dynamic IPv4 address belonging to the Intranet/ISP addressing
space is allocated to a UE at PDU session establishment. The methods of
allocating IP address to the UE are specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The
allocated IPv4 address is used for packet forwarding within the UPF or
UPF+PGW-U and for packet forwarding on the Intranet/ISP;
\- as a part of the PDU session establishment, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C may
request user authentication from an external DN-AAA server (i.e. RADIUS,
Diameter) belonging to the Intranet/ISP;
\- the IPv4 address allocation to the UE may be performed based on the
subscription or a local address pool, which belongs to the Intranet/ISP
addressing space, provisioned in the SMF or SMF+PGW-C; provisioned in the UPF
or UPF+PGW-U or via the address allocation servers (i.e. DHCPv4, RADIUS DN-
AAA, Diameter DN-AAA) belonging to the Intranet/ISP;
\- if requested by the UE at PDU session establishment, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C
may retrieve the Protocol Configuration Options or IPv4 configuration
parameters from a locally provisioned database in SMF or SMF+PGW-C and/or from
some external server (i.e. DHCPv4, RADIUS DN-AAA, Diameter DN-AAA) belonging
to the Intranet/ISP;
\- the communication between the 5GS and the Intranet/ISP may be performed
over any network, even an insecure network, e.g. the Internet. In case of an
insecure connection between the UPF or UPF+PGW-U and the Intranet/ISP, there
may be a specific security protocol in between. This security protocol is
defined by mutual agreement between PLMN operator and Intranet/ISP
administrator.
Table 8.2.2.2-1 summarizes the IPv4 address allocation and parameter
configuration use cases between the UE and the SMF or SMF+PGW-C that may lead
the SMF or SMF+PGW-C to interwork with the external DHCPv4, DN-AAA servers.
For detailed description of the signalling flows between the UE and the SMF or
SMF+PGW-C, see the references in the table.

NOTE: External network operators intending to use PAP/CHAP without proper
underlying protection for authentication are warned about the respective
vulnerabilities of PAP and CHAP protocols from a security point of view. It\'s
up to the external network operator to perform the risk assessment if PAP/CHAP
is used for authentication.
#### 8.2.2.3 IPv6 Non-transparent access to DN
When using IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration, the process of setting up the
access to an Intranet or ISP involves two signalling phases. The first
signalling phase is done in the control plane and consists of the PDU session
establishment for 5GS 3GPP or non-3GPP based access, followed by a second
signalling phase done in the user plane.
The user plane signalling phase shall be stateless. The stateless procedure,
which involves only the UE and the SMF or SMF+PGW-C, is described in clause
10.2. 3.
For DNNs that are configured for IPv6 address allocation, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C
shall only use the Prefix part of the IPv6 address for forwarding of mobile
terminated IP packets. The size of the prefix shall be according to the
maximum prefix length for a global IPv6 address as specified in the IPv6
Addressing Architecture, see IETF RFC 4291 [32].
The SMF or SMF+PGW-C indicates to the UE that Stateless Autoconfiguration
shall be performed by sending Router Advertisements as described in clause
10.2.3 and according to the principles defined in IETF RFC 4861 [33] and IETF
RFC 4862 [34].
For UE supporting IPv6, IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration is mandatory.
In this case, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C provides the UE with an IPv6 Prefix
belonging to the Intranet/ISP addressing space. A dynamic IPv6 address is
given using stateless address autoconfiguration. This IPv6 address is used for
packet forwarding within the UPF and for packet forwarding on the
Intranet/ISP.
When an SMFor SMF+PGW-C receives an initial access request (i.e.
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext) message, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C deduces from
local configuration data associated with the DNN:
\- The source of IPv6 Prefixes (SMF or SMF+PGW-C internal prefix pool, or
external address allocation server);
\- Any server(s) to be used for address allocation, authentication and/or
protocol configuration options retrieval (e.g. IMS related configuration, see
3GPP TS 24.229 [13]);
\- The protocol, i.e. RADIUS, Diameter or DHCPv6, to be used with the
server(s);
\- The communication and security feature needed to communicate with the
server(s).
As an example, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C may use one of the following options:
\- SMF or SMF+PGW-C internal Prefix pool for IPv6 prefixes allocation and no
authentication;
\- SMF or SMF+PGW-C internal Prefix pool for IPv6 prefixes allocation and
RADIUS for authentication. The RADIUS DN-AAA server responds with either an
Access-Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS client in the SMF or
SMF+PGW-C;
\- RADIUS for authentication and IPv6 prefix allocation. The RADIUS DN-AAA
server responds with either an Accessâ€‘Accept or an Access-Reject to the RADIUS
client in the SMF or SMF+PGW-C.
\- RADIUS for authentication. DHCPv6 for IPv6 prefix allocation and may
support IPv6 prefix delegation for allocating additional IPv6 prefix(es). The
details of IPv6 prefix delegation are described in clause 10.2.5.
The SMF or SMF+PGW-C includes the IPv6 address composed of a Prefix and an
Interface-Identifier in the initial access response
(Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer). The Interface-Identifier may have
any value and it does not need to be unique within or across DNNs. It shall
however not conflict with the Interface-Identifier that the SMF or SMF+PGW-C
has selected for its own side of the UE-SMF link. The Prefix assigned by the
SMF or SMF+PGW-C or the external DN-AAA server shall be globally or site-local
unique (see the Note in clause 11.3 of this document regarding the usage of
site-local addresses).
Table 8.2.2.3-1 summarizes the IPv6 prefix allocation and parameter
configuration use cases between the UE and the SMF or SMF+PGW-C that may lead
the SMF or SMF+PGW-C to interwork with the external RADIUS DN-AAA, Diameter
DN-AAA and DHCPv6 servers. For detailed description of the signalling flows

NOTE: External network operators intending to use PAP/CHAP without proper
underlying protection for authentication are warned about the respective
vulnerabilities of PAP and CHAP protocols from a security point of view. It\'s
up to the external network operator to perform the risk assessment if PAP/CHAP
is used for authentication.
For IPv6 the PDU session establishment phase is followed by an address
autoconfiguration phase. IPv6 prefix is delivered to UE in Router
Advertisement message from the SMF or SMF+PGW-C which acts as an access
router, in the process of IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration as
described in clause 10.2.2. Besides DHCPv6 protocol, the SMF or PGW-C may also
use RADIUS or Diameter protocol for the retrieval of an IPv6 prefix from
external DN.
## 8.3 Transport Level Marking
Based on operator policy, the transport level packet marking (e.g. setting the
DiffServ Code Point) by the SMF/UPF in the uplink may be based on the 5QI, the
Priority Level (if explicitly signalled), and optionally the ARP priority
level, of the associated QoS flow.
# 9 Interworking with DN (Unstructured)
## 9.1 General
When support of unstructured PDU type data is provided at the N6 interface,
different Point-to-Point (PtP) tunneling techniques may be used. When using
PtP tunneling by UDP/IPv6 encapsulation clause 9.2 below shall be followed.
Other techniques as described in clause 9.3 below may be used.
In the following clauses, the AS is used as an example for the destination in
the external DN.
## 9.2 N6 PtP tunnelling based on UDP/IP
N6 PtP tunnelling based on UDP/IPv6 may be used to deliver unstructured PDU
type data to the AS.
The PtP tunnel is set up by configuration of tunnel parameters in both end of
the tunnel. The following parameters are pre-configured in the UPF per DNN:
\- the UDP destination port number to use when sending unstructured PDU type
data;
\- the UDP port number it wants to receive unstructured PDU type data;
\- the destination IP address to be used for sending unstructured PDU type
data.
The following is pre-configured in the AS:
\- the UDP destination port number to use when sending unstructured PDU type
data;
\- the UDP port number it wants to receive unstructured PDU type data.
NOTE 1: The UPF as well as the AS can use any UDP port numbers not assigned by
IANA. The port numbers used need to be aligned between peers.
IP address allocation procedures for the UE (i.e. PDU session) are performed
by the SMF as described in clause 6.3.2, but the IPv6 prefix is not provided
to the UE, i.e. Router Advertisements and DHCPv6 are not performed. The SMF
assigns a suffix (i.e. IPv6 Interface Identifier) for the PDU session. For the
N6 PtP tunnel, the IPv6 prefix allocated for the PDU session plus suffix
assigned for the PtP tunnel is used as source address for the uplink data and
as destination address for the downlink data.
During the PDU session establishment, the UPF associates the GTP-U tunnel for
the PDU session with the N6 PtP tunnel.
The UPF acts as a transparent forwarding node between the UE and the AS.
For uplink delivery, if the uplink data is received from the GTP-U tunnel, the
UPF shall forward the received data to the AS over the N6 PtP tunnel
associated with the GTP-U tunnel with the destination address of the AS and
the configured UDP destination port number for unstructured PDU type data.
For downlink delivery, the AS shall send the data using UDP/IP encapsulation
with the IPv6 prefix plus suffix as destination address and the configured UDP
destination port number for unstructured PDU type data.
NOTE 2: The UPF decapsulates the received data (i.e. removes the UDP/IPv6
headers) and forwards the data on the GTP-U tunnel identified by the IPv6
prefix of the UE (i.e. PDU session) for delivery to the UE.
Figure 9.2-1: Protocol configuration for unstructured PDU type data (user
plane) using N6 UDP/IPv6 PtP tunneling
## 9.3 Other N6 tunnelling mechanism
N6 PtP tunnelling mechanisms such as PMIPv6/GRE, L2TP, etc, may be used to
deliver unstructured PDU type data to AS. The general handling of such
delivery mechanisms is as described below.
A PtP tunnel is established by the UPF towards the AS. Depending on the type
of protocol employed on the N6 PtP tunnel, the N6 PtP tunnel setup may be done
at the time of PDU Session establishment or at the time of first MO datagram
being sent by the UE. The UPF selects the AS based on its configuration (e.g.
per DNN, or per PtP tunnel type, etc). However, IP address allocation
procedures for the UE (according to clause 6.3.2) are not performed by the
SMF.
NOTE: An AS can be dedicated for handling a specific protocol for unstructured
PDU type data.
The UPF acts as a transparent forwarding node between the UE and the AS.
For uplink delivery, the UPF forwards the received data to the AS over the
established N6 PtP tunnel.
For downlink delivery, the AS locates the right N6 PtP tunnel for the UE
(using information such as UE identifiers in the unstructured PDU type
protocol itself, etc) to forward the data. The AS sends the data to UPF over
the established N6 PtP tunnel. The UPF in turn sends the data on the GTP-U
tunnel identified by the associated N6 PtP tunnel for delivery to the UE.
# 10 Interworking with DN (DHCP)
## 10.1 General
In current LAN environments the most commonly used configuration protocol is
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, IETF RFC 2131 [18]) and DHCPv6
(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6, IETF RFC 3315 [21]). It
provides a mechanism for passing a large set of configuration parameters to
hosts connected to a TCP/IP network (IP address, sub-net mask, domain name,
MTU, etc.) in an automatic manner. Moreover, DHCP may assign IP addresses to
clients for a finite lease time, allowing for sequential reassignment of
addresses to different users.
The lease time is chosen by the administrator of the DHCP server (in the
external network), and is therefore out of the scope of the present document.
The 3GPP network may obtain IP address via external DHCP server during the PDU
establishment procedure, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C acts a DHCP server towards the
UE and it acts as a DHCP client towards the external DHCP server.
In the following cases the PDU session associated with the allocated IPv4
address or IPv6 prefix shall be released:
\- if the DHCP lease expires;
\- if the DHCP renewal is rejected by the DHCP server;
\- if the IP address is changed during the renewal process. Usually when the
lease is renewed, the IP address remains unchanged. However, if for any reason
(e.g. poor configuration of the DHCP server), a different IP address is
allocated during the lease renewal process the associated PDU session shall be
released.
A RG may request DHCP singalling for a UE behind the RG as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.316 [43].When handling DHCP signalling coming from the wireline BBF
access, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C shall support the DHCP signalling as described in
BBF TR-456 [54].
## 10.2 DN interworking Model of SMF or SMF+PGW-C for DHCP
A DHCP client shall be located in the SMF or SMF+PGW-C used for interworking
with the IP network as illustrated in figure 10.2.1-1.
Figure 10.2.1-1: The protocol stacks for the N6 reference point for DHCP
The DHCP client function in the SMF or SMF+PGW-C shall be used to allocate
IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix to the UE and/or to configure associated
parameters via external DHCP servers. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C shall have both
DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 client functions.
The procedures where the DHCP client function in the SMF or SMF+PGW-C is used
are further described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The procedures are IPv4 address
allocation and IPv4 parameter configuration via an external DHCPv4 server;
IPv6 Prefix allocation via stateless address autoconfiguration; and IPv6
parameter configuration via stateless DHCPv6. These procedures are detailed in
the clauses below.
### 10.2.2 IPv4 Address allocation and IPv4 parameter configuration via DHCPv4
The UE may obtain the IPv4 address and/or its configuration parameters at or
after the initial access signalling (i.e. Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext) to
the 3GPP network. The request for IPv4 address and/or configuration parameters
from the UE may trigger the SMF or SMF+PGW-C acting as a DHCPv4 client to
request the IPv4 address and/or configuration parameters from an external
DHCPv4 server and deliver them to the UE. The DHCPv4 functions in the SMF or
SMF+PGW-C, the UE and the external DHCPv4 server shall be compliant to IETF
RFC 2131 [18], IETF RFC 1542 [19] and IETF RFC 4039 [20].
The following system procedure describes the successful IPv4 address
allocation and parameter configuration signalling flow between the SMF or
SMF+PGW-C and the external DHCPv4 server as depicted in figure 10.2.2-1. For a
detailed description of the DHCPv4 messages, refer to IETF RFC 2131 [18], IETF
RFC 1542 [19] and IETF RFC 4039 [20].
1) The DHCPv4 client function in the SMF or SMF+PGW-C sends a DHCPDISCOVER as
an IP limited broadcast message, i.e. the destination address 255.255.255.255,
towards the external DN. If the SMF or SMF+PGW-C has the DHCPv4 server IP
addresses configured for the DNN, the DHCPDISCOVER shall be send as unicast
(or even multicast) to the external DHCPv4 servers.
2) Upon receiving the DHCPDISCOVER request message, the external DHCPv4
servers reply by sending a DHCPOFFER message including an offered IP address.
Several DHCPOFFER messages may be received by the SMF or SMF+PGW-C if multiple
DHCPv4 servers respond to the DHCPDISCOVER.
3) The DHCPv4 client function in the SMF or SMF+PGW-C processes the messages
and sends a DHCPREQUEST towards the selected external DHCPv4 server.
NOTE: If the optimized signalling (Rapid Commit Option) is used as per IETF
RFC 4039 [20], the messages 2-3 can be eliminated.
4) Upon receiving the DHCPREQUEST message, the selected external DHCPv4 server
acknowledges the address allocation by sending a DHCPACK containing the lease
period (T1), the time-out time (T2) and the configuration information
requested in DHCPREQUEST. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C stores the allocated IPv4
address, the lease timers and the configuration parameters. The SMF or
SMF+PGW-C shall further deliver the IPv4 address and the configuration
parameters to the UE by SM NAS message.
Figure 10.2.2-1: The signalling flow for IPv4 address allocation and parameter
configuration using DHCPv4
Figure 10.2.2-2 is a signalling flow for IPv4 address lease renew by using
DHCPv4 protocol as specified in IETF RFC 2131 [18].
1) The DHCPv4 client function in the SMF or SMF+PGW-C sends a unicast
DHCPREQUEST towards the external DHCPv4 server to extend the lease period of
the allocated IPv4 address.
2) The external DHCPv4 server replies with a DHCPACK message confirming the
renewed lease and the T1 and T2 timers are restarted.
Figure 10.2.2-2: The signalling flow for IPv4 address lease renew using DHCPv4
### 10.2.3 IPv6 Prefix allocation via IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration
via DHCPv6
When the IPv6 prefix is allocated from the external DN, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C
is responsible to obtain the IPv6 prefix for external DN, allocate and release
the IPv6 prefix. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C may use DHCPv6 to obtain the IPv6 prefix
from the external DN. In this context, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C shall act as a
DHCP client as per IETF RFC 3315 [21] towards the external DHCPv6 server.
The SMF or SMF+PGW-C may allocate a second IPv6 prefix for routing traffic via
a second UPF or UPF+PGW-U to enable simultaneous access via remote and local
networks or to enable SSC mode 3 (i.e. make-before-break) mobility, as
described in clause 4.3.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
The following system procedure describes the signalling flows for the IPv6
Stateless Address Autoconfiguration procedures for 5G system. The procedures
are based on the descriptions in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
1\. UE initiates the PDU Session Establishment procedure, indicating IPv6
address is required.
2\. The AMF sends PDU Session Establishment Request in
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext to the SMF or SMF+PGW-C.
3\. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C may retrieve IPv6 prefix using DHCPv6 mechanism. This
procedure is performed when an external DN allocates an IPv6 prefix, the
signaling between the SMF or SMF+PGW-C and external DN is exchanged via UPF or
UPF+PGW-U which is omitted in the figure 10.2.3-1.
4\. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C sends PDU Session Establishment Accept included in
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer to the AMF. It includes the IPv6
prefix.
5\. The AMF sends PDU Session Establishment Accept message to the UE without
the IPv6 prefix. The UE shall ignore the IPv6 prefix if it receives it in the
message.
6\. The UE may send a Router Solicitation to the SMF or SMF+PGW-C via the UPF
or UPF+PGW-U to solicit a Router Advertisement message.
7\. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C sends a Router Advertisement message to the UE via
the UPF or UPF+PGW-U, solicited or unsolicited. It shall include an IPv6
prefix in Prefix Information option field of the message. The prefix is the
same as the one in the PDU Session Establishment Accept message, if it is
provided during the previous PDU Session Establishment procedure.
8\. At any time after PDU session establishment, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C may
trigger the establishment on an alternative route via UPF2 or UPF+PGW-U2 for
access to a local data network or for SSC mode 3 mobility.
9\. Like step 3, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C may retrieve a second IPv6 prefix using
DHCPv6 mechanism.
10\. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C sends a Router Advertisement to the UE via UPF2 or
UPF+PGW-U2 to update the UE. Note that this will occur without a Router
Solicitation since the UE is unaware of the network\'s decision to form an
alternative Route.
11\. Specific to the case of SSC mode 3 mobility, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C sends a
Router Advertisement to the UE via UPF1 or UPF+PGW-U1 with zero value in the
preferred lifetime field and a value in the valid lifetime field according to
IETF RFC 4862 [34]. The UE shall update the valid lifetime of the old IPv6
prefix to the signalled value, regardless of the remaining lifetime. The
signalled lifetime value indicates how long the SMF or SMF+PGW-C is willing to
keep the old IPv6 prefix.
NOTE: Alternative routes can be established repeatedly through additional UPFs
or UPF+PGW-Us and old routes can be terminated when required by the SMF or
SMF+PGW-C. More complex scenarios are not described here for the sake of
simplicity.
Figure 10.2.3-1: IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
### 10.2.4 IPv6 parameter configuration via stateless DHCPv6
A UE that has obtained an IPv6 address may use stateless DHCP to request other
configuration information such as a list of DNS recursive name servers or SIP
servers.
For 3GPP networks, when an external DHCPv6 server in a DN is used to obtain
the requested parameters, the SMF acts as a DHCPv6 client towards the external
DHCPv6 server while acting a DHCPv6 server towards the UE.
The IPv6 parameter configuration via stateless DHCPv6 function in the UE, the
SMF and the external DHCPv6 Server shall be compliant to IETF RFC 3736 [22].
The following system procedure describes the signalling flows for the IPv6
parameter configuration via stateless DHCPv6 procedures for 5G system. All
messages in the following steps between the UE and the SMF are sent via the
UPF.
1) A Router Advertisement with the O-flag set, is sent from SMF to UE to
indicate to it to retrieve other configuration information.
2) The UE sends an INFORMATION-REQUEST message with the IP destination address
set to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address defined in the
DHCPv6 IETF RFC 3315 [21]. The source address shall be the link-local address
of the UE. The DHCP relay agent in the SMF shall forward the message.
3) DHCP servers receiving the forwarded INFORMATION-REQUEST message, reply by
sending a RELAYâ€‘REPLY message, with the \"Relay Message\" option including a
REPLY message with the requested configuration parameters.
The UE chooses one of the possibly several REPLY messages and extracts the
configuration information.

Figure 10.2.4-1: DHCPv6 Other configuration signal flow
### 10.2.5 IPv6 Prefix Delegation via DHCPv6
#### 10.2.5.1 General requirement
SMF or SMF+PGW-C may (depending on the configuration for the DNN/S-NSSAI)
assign a single network prefix shorter than the default /64 prefix to a PDU
Session from the internal IPv6 Prefix pool or via DHCPv6. In this case, the
/64 default prefix used for IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration shall be
allocated from this network prefix, except for RG may have different shorter
IPv6 prefix(es) delegated via DHCPv6 not including the allocated /64 default
prefix; the remaining address space from the network prefix may be delegated
to the PDU Session using prefix delegation after the PDU Session establishment
and IPv6 prefix allocation via IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration as
defined in clause 10.2.3.
Depending on configuration, the SMF may obtain the prefix from a locally
provisioned pool, from the PSA UPF or from the external DN.
If the UE had indicated that it supports prefix exclusion and the prefix to be
delegated to the UE includes the /64 prefix that was allocated to the PDU
Session, the SMF or SMF+PGW shall utilize the prefix exclusion feature as
specified for DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation in RFC 6603 [62].
The UE uses DHCPv6 to request additional IPv6 prefix (i.e.: prefix in addition
to the default prefix) from the SMF or SMF+PGW-C after completing stateless
IPv6 address autoconfiguration procedures. The UE acts as a \"Requesting
Router\" as described in RFC 8415 [49] and inserts one or more IA_PD option(s)
into a DHCPv6 Solicit message sent from the UE to the SMF or SMF+PGW-C via the
user plane and the UPF or UPF+PGW-U. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C acts as the DHCP
server and fulfils the role of a \"Delegating Router\" according to RFC 8415
[49]. The UE optionally includes the RAPID_COMMIT option in the DHCPv6 Solicit
message to trigger two-message DHCPv6 procedure instead of the four-message
DHCPv6 procedure. The UE shall include OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE option code in an
OPTION_ORO option to indicate support for prefix exclusion. In response to the
DHCPv6 Solicit message, the UE receives a DHCPv6 Reply message with one or
more IA_PD prefix(es) for every IA_PD option that it sent in the DHCPv6
Solicit message. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C delegates a prefix excluding the default
prefix with help of OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE, except for RG as UE when different
shorter IPv6 prefix(es) is delegated via DHCPv6. Prefix exclusion procedures
shall follow RFC 6603 [62].
The additional requirement for RG connecting to 5GC with IPv6 Prefix
Delegation via DHCPv6 is defined in clause 10.2.5.2.
#### 10.2.5.2 Additional requirement to support RG
Besides the general support to IPv6 prefix delegation as described in clause
10.2.5.1, a RG may request IPv6 prefix allocation for UE behind the RG as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.316 [43]. A SMF or SMF+PGW-C may receive both DHCP
options for IA_NA and IA_PD together in a single DHCPv6 message, the SMF or
SMF+PGW-C may provide a reply to both IA_NA and IA_PD in the same message or
alternatively process the DHCPv6 IA_NA before the DHCPv6 IA_PD.
For the detailed description of the RG uses DHCPv6 to request additional IPv6
prefix(es) refer to clause 4.6.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.316 [43]. The prefix exclude
option is optionally used to exclude the default /64 prefix allocated to the
PDU Session within the same shorter prefix of the DHCPv6 delegated prefix, and
it is possible for SMF or SMF+PGW-C to assign a /64 prefix using stateless
address autoconfiguration and one or more completely different shorter
prefix(es) using DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation without use of prefix exclude
option.
## 10.3 3GPP Vendor-Specific Options
This clause describes 3GPP Vender-Specific Options that will be included in
DHCP messages exchanged between SMF or SMF+PGW-C and DHCP Server. Other DHCP
options may be used as defined in DHCP RFC(s). Unless otherwise stated, when
the encoding scheme of an attribute is specified as UTF-8 encoding, this shall
be interpreted as UTF-8 hexadecimal encoding.
The DHCPv4 vendor specific option is encoded as per IETF RFC 2132 [47] or IETF
RFC 3925 [48]. The DHCPv6 vendor specific option is encoded as per IETF RFC
8415 [49]. For DHCP vendor specific option code 17 or 125, the Enterprise
Number shall be set to value 10415.
The table 10.3-1 lists the encapsulated 3GPP Vendor-Specific Options in DHCP
vendor specific option (17/43/125).

S-NSSAI, DNN, and IP version as described in clause 5.8.2.2.1 in 3GPP TS
23.501 [2] and includes the IP address pool ID within 3GPP Vendor-Specific-
Option and send it to the DHCP server. The DHCP server assigns IPv6 prefix or
IPv4 address from the requested IP address pool. Multiple 3GPP-IP-Pool-Info
sub-options may be sent in a DHCP request message. The DHCP server shall
return the selected IP address pool ID within 3GPP Vendor-Specific-Option to
the SMF or SMF+PGW-C in the DHCP successful response message (e.g. DHCPACK).
# 11 Interworking with DN-AAA (RADIUS)
## 11.1 RADIUS procedures
### 11.1.1 RADIUS Authentication and Authorization in 5GC
The SMF also represents the H-SMF in the home routed scenario in this clause
unless specified otherwise.
RADIUS Authentication and Authorization shall be used according to IETF RFC
2865 [8], IETF RFC 3162 [9] and IETF RFC 4818 [10]. In 5G, multiple
authentication methods using Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) may be
used such as EAP-TLS (see IETF RFC 5216 [11]), EAP-TTLS (see IETF RFC 5281
[37]). The SMF shall implement the RADIUS extension to support EAP as
specified in IETF RFC 3579 [7].
The RADIUS client function may reside in an SMF. When the SMF receives an
initial access request (i.e. the SMF receives the
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext request with type \"Initial request\" for non-
roaming case or local breakout case, or the H-SMF receives the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request with type \"Initial request\" for home routed
case), the RADIUS client function may send the authentication information to a
DN-AAA server, which is identified during the DNN provisioning.
When the legacy applications require PAP/CHAP authentication with the UE
accessing to the 5GS and the legacy DN-AAA server does not support EAP,
PAP/CHAP may be used as the authentication protocol, with the external network
performing the risk assessment.
The DN-AAA server performs authentication and authorization. The response
(when positive) may contain network information, such as an IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix for the user when the SMF is interworking with the DN-AAA
server.
The information delivered during the RADIUS authentication can be used to
automatically correlate the user identity (e.g. SUPI) to the IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix, if applicable, assigned/confirmed by the SMF or the DN-AAA
server respectively. The same procedure applies, in case of sending the
authentication to a \'proxy\' DN-AAA server.
For 5G, RADIUS Authentication is applicable to the initial access request.
When the SMF receives an Access-Accept message from the DN-AAA server it shall
complete the initial access procedure. If Access-Reject or no response is
received, the SMF shall reject the initial access procedure with a suitable
cause code.
When DN-AAA server authorizes the PDU Session Establishment, it may send DN
authorization data for the established PDU Session to the SMF. The DN
authorization data for the established PDU Session may include one or more of
the following:
\- a reference to authorization data for policy and charging control locally
configured in the SMF or PCF;
\- a list of allowed MAC addresses (maximum 16) for the Ethernet PDU Session;
\- a list of allowed VLAN Ids (maximum 16) for the Ethernet PDU Session;
\- Session-AMBR for the PDU Session;
\- L2TP information, such as LNS IP address and/or LNS host name; and
\- Framed Route information for the PDU Session.
NOTE: If the DN-AAA server send L2TP information to SMF, the L2PT information
can e.g. be provisioned per DNN/S-NSSAI or per SUPI or GPSI by configuration
which is out of the scope of 3GPP specifications.
SMF policies may require DN authorization without DN authentication. In that
case, when contacting the DN-AAA server for authorization, the SMF shall
provide the GPSI of the UE if available.
The SMF may also use the RADIUS re-authorization procedure for the purpose of
IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation to the UE. The use cases that may
lead this procedure are:
\- IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation after UPF selection during PDU
session establishment procedure.
\- IPv6 prefix allocation during adding additional PDU Session Anchor
procedure for IPv6 multi-homing.
\- IPv4 address allocation via DHCPv4 procedure after successful PDU session
establishment procedure.
The SMF may also trigger request for DN authentication/authorization and/or IP
address/prefix allocation based on UE subscription data retrieve from the UDM
as defined in clause 5.2.2.2.5 of 3GPP TS 29.503.
When an IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix (including any additional IPv6 prefix
of IPv6 multi-homing) is (re-)allocated or de-allocated (not causing the PDU
session to be released) by using a method not via the DN-AAA server and if the
SMF was required by the DN-AAA server to report such change during
authentication procedure or by local configuration, the SMF shall, if
applicable, use the authentication session that was established before to
inform the DN-AAA server by sending RADIUS Access-Request with the latest list
of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix(es).
When the SMF is notified by the UPF regarding the UE MAC address change (a new
one is detected or a used one is inactive), if the SMF was required by the DN-
AAA server to report such change during authentication procedure or by local
configuration, the SMF shall, if applicable, use the authentication session
that was established before to inform the DN-AAA server by sending RADIUS
Access-Request with the latest list of UE MAC addresses in use.
DN-AAA may initiate QoS flow termination, re-authorization and re-
authentication, see details in clause 11.2.3, clause 11.2.4 and clause 11.2.5.
### 11.1.1a RADIUS Authentication and Authorization in EPC Interworking
RADIUS Authentication and Authorization shall be used according to IETF RFC
2865 [8], IETF RFC 3162 [9] and IETF RFC 4818 [10]. The SMF+PGW-C shall
implement the RADIUS extension to support EAP as specified in IETF RFC 3579
[7].
When the SMF+PGW-C receives a new Create Session Request and the Session
Management Subscription Data from the UDM or local configuration indicate the
need for EAP-based secondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA, the
RADIUS client function may send the authentication information to a DN-AAA
server, which is identified during the DNN provisioning.
When the legacy applications require PAP/CHAP authentication with the UE
accessing the 5GC and EPC interworking scenario and the legacy DN-AAA server
does not support EAP, PAP/CHAP may be used as the authentication protocol,
with the external network performing the risk assessment.
The DN-AAA server performs authentication and authorization. The response
(when positive) may contain network information, such as an IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix for the user when the SMF+PGW-C is interworking with the
DN-AAA server.
The information delivered during the RADIUS authentication can be used to
automatically correlate the user identity (e.g. SUPI) to the IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix, if applicable, assigned/confirmed by the SMF+PGW-C or the
DN-AAA server respectively. The same procedure applies, in case of sending the
authentication to a \'proxy\' DN-AAA server.
When the SMF+PGW-C receives an Access-Accept message from the DN-AAA server it
shall complete the initial access procedure. If Access-Reject or no response
is received, the SMF+PGW-C shall reject the PDN Connection procedure with a
suitable cause code.
When DN-AAA server authorizes the PDN Connection Establishment, it may send DN
authorization data for the established PDN Connection to the SMF+PGW-C. The DN
authorization data for the established PDN Connection may include one or more
of the following:
\- a reference to authorization data for policy and charging control locally
configured in the SMF+PGW-C or PCF;
\- a list of allowed MAC addresses (maximum 16) for the Ethernet PDN
Connection;
\- a list of allowed VLAN Ids (maximum 16) for the Ethernet PDN Connection;
\- Session-AMBR for the PDN Connection;
\- L2TP information, such as LNS IP address and/or LNS host name; and
\- Framed Route information for the PDN Connection.
NOTE: If the DN-AAA server send L2TP information to SMF+PGW-C, the L2PT
information can e.g. be provisioned per DNN/S-NSSAI or per SUPI or GPSI by
configuration which is out of the scope of 3GPP specifications.
SMF+PGW-C policies may require DN authorization without DN authentication. In
that case, when contacting the DN-AAA server for authorization, the SMF+PGW-C
shall provide the GPSI of the UE if available.
The SMF may also use the RADIUS re-authorization procedure for the purpose of
IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation to the UE. The use cases that may
lead this procedure are:
\- IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation after UPF+PGW-U selection during
PDN connection establishment procedure.
\- IPv6 prefix allocation during adding additional PDN Connection Anchor
procedure for IPv6 multi-homing.
\- IPv4 address allocation via DHCPv4 procedure after successful PDN
connection establishment procedure.
The SMF+PGW-C may also trigger request for DN authentication/authorization
and/or IP address/prefix allocation based on UE subscription data retrieve
from the UDM as defined in clause 5.2.2.2.5 of 3GPP TS 29.503.
When an IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix (including any additional IPv6 prefix
of IPv6 multi-homing) is (re-)allocated or de-allocated (not causing the PDN
connection to be released) by using a method not via the DN-AAA server and if
the SMF+PGW-C was required by the DN-AAA server to report such change during
authentication procedure or by local configuration, the SMF+PGW-C shall, if
applicable, use the authentication session that was established before to
inform the DN-AAA server by sending RADIUS Access-Request with the latest list
of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix(es).
When the SMF+PGW-C is notified by the UPF+PGW-U regarding the UE MAC address
change (a new one is detected or a used one is inactive), if the SMF+PGW-C was
required by the DN-AAA server to report such change during authentication
procedure or by local configuration, the SMF+PGW-C shall, if applicable, use
the authentication session that was established before to inform the DN-AAA
server by sending RADIUS Access-Request with the latest list of UE MAC
addresses in use.
DN-AAA may initiate QoS flow termination, re-authorization and re-
authentication, see details in clause 11.2.3, clause 11.2.4 and clause 11.2.5.
In case EAP based authentication and authorization has been performed for the
PDU Session while the UE was in 5GS, and if SMF+PGW-C determines that the UE
has moved to the EPS (i.e. the SMF+PGW-C receives the modify bearer request or
create session request from the S-GW), the following applies:
\- the SMF+PGW-C may initiate RADIUS re-authorization procedure without re-
authentication with the DN-AAA server based on local policy.
\- DN-AAA initiated re-authorization without re-authentication may be
performed.
### 11.1.2 RADIUS Accounting
RADIUS Accounting shall be used according to IETF RFC 2866 [26], IETF RFC 3162
[9] and IETF RFC 4818 [10].
The RADIUS accounting client function may reside in an SMF. The RADIUS
accounting client may send information to a DN-AAA server, which is identified
during the DNN provisioning. The DN-AAA server may store this information and
use it to automatically identify the user. This information can be trusted
because the 3GPP network has authenticated the subscriber (i.e. USIM card and
possibly other authentication methods).
The SMF may use the RADIUS Accounting-Request Start and Stop messages during
QoS flow (e.g. QoS flow associated with the default QoS rule) establishment
and termination procedures, respectively.
The use of Accounting-Request STOP and in addition the Accounting ON and
Accounting OFF messages may be used to ensure that information stored in the
DN-AAA server is synchronised with the SMF information.
If the DN-AAA server is used for IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix assignment,
then, upon reception of a RADIUS Accounting-Request STOP message for all QoS
flows associated to a PDU session defined by DNN and SUPI or GPSI, the DN-AAA
server may make the associated IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix available for
assignment.
When an IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix (including any additional IPv6 prefix
of IPv6 multi-homing) is (re-)allocated or de-allocated (not causing the PDU
session to be released) by using a method not via the DN-AAA server and if the
SMF was required by the DN-AAA server to report such change during
authentication procedure or by local configuration, the SMF shall, if
applicable, use the accounting session that was established before to inform
the DN-AAA server by sending RADIUS Accounting-Request Interim-Update with the
latest list of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix(es).
When the SMF is notified by the UPF regarding the UE MAC address change (a new
one is detected or a used one is inactive), if the SMF was required by the DN-
AAA server to report such change during authentication procedure or by local
configuration, the SMF shall, if applicable, use the accounting session that
was established before to inform the DN-AAA server by sending RADIUS
Accounting-Request Interim-Update with the latest list of UE MAC addresses in
use.
In order to avoid race conditions, the SMF shall include a 3GPP Vendor-
Specific sub-attribute \"Session Stop indicator\" when it sends the
Accounting-Request STOP for the last QoS flow of a PDU session and the PDU
session is terminated (i.e. the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix and any
associated GTP tunnel can be released). The DN-AAA server shall not assume the
PDU session terminated until an Accounting-Request STOP with the Session Stop
indicator is received.
## 11.2 Message flows on N6 interface
### 11.2.1 Authentication, Authorization and Accounting procedures in 5GC
The SMF also represents the H-SMF in the home routed scenario in this clause
unless specified otherwise.
When an SMF receives an initial access request (i.e. the SMF receives the
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext request with type \"Initial request\" for non-
roaming case or local breakout case, or the H-SMF receives the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request with type \"Initial request\" for home routed
case) message for a given DNN, the SMF may (depending on the configuration for
this DNN) send a RADIUS Access-Request message with EAP extension to a DN-AAA
server. The SMF may also (depending on the configuration for this DNN) send
the S-NSSAI and the PDU Session ID that are associated with the PDU Session,
respectively in the 3GPP-Session-S-NSSAI VSA and the 3GPP-Session-Id VSA, to a
DN-AAA server. Upon receipt of the Access-Request message, the DN-AAA server
shall respond with an Access-Challenge message. Multi-round authentication
using the Access-Challenge (sent by DN-AAA) and Access-Request messages may be
used. The DN-AAA server finally authenticates and authorizes the user by
replying with an Access Accept message. If the DN-AAA server is also
responsible for IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation, the DN-AAA server
shall return the allocated IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix in the Access-
Accept message.
For re-authentication and re-authorization, the SMF shall send a RADIUS
Access-Request message with EAP extension and the DN-AAA shall respond with an
Access-Challenge message. Multi-round authentication using the Access-
Challenge (sent by DN-AAA) and Access-Request messages may be used. The DN-AAA
server finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with an
Access Accept message.
The SMF may initiate RADIUS re-authorization procedures for the purpose of
IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation (or renew the lease). In this case,
the SMF shall set the Service-Type attribute to \"Authorize Only\" and the
3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type subattribute to the type of IP address to be allocated
in the Access-Request message sent to the DN-AAA server. If the SMF is using
DHCP signalling towards the UE and the DN-AAA server includes the Session-
Timeout attribute in the Access-Accept, the SMF may use the Session-Timeout
value as the DHCP lease time. The SMF shall not set the DHCP lease time value
higher than the Session-Timeout value. The SMF may renew the DHCP lease to the
UE without re-authorization towards the DN-AAA server providing that the new
lease expiry is no later than the Session-Timeout timer expiry. If the SMF
wishes to extend the lease time beyond the current Session-Timeout expiry, it
shall initiate a new AAA re-authorization.
Even if the SMF was not involved in user authentication, it may send a RADIUS
Accounting-Request (START) message to a DN-AAA server. This message may
contain parameters, e.g. the tuple which includes the user ID and IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix, to be used by application servers (e.g. WAP gateway) in
order to identify the user, the 3GPP-Charging-Id VSA or 3GPP-Charging-Id-v2
VSA according to the length of the Charging Id for the user session. This
message may also (depending on the configuration for the DNN) contains the
S-NSSAI and the PDU Session ID that are associated with the PDU Session,
respectively in the 3GPP-Session-S-NSSAI VSA and the 3GPP-Session-Id VSA,
and/or AF traffic influence PCC rule provisioned and then SMF used DNAI in the
3GPP-DNAI VSA, to a DN-AAA server. This message also indicates to the AAA
server that the user session has started. The user session is uniquely
identified by the Acct-Session-Id that is composed of the Charging ID and the
SMF IP address.
NOTE: If the accounting session is required by the DN-AAA server to be created
per QoS flow, how to identify the different accounting sessions is
implementation specific. The SMF can include the Acct-Session-Id which is
extended to include the QFI of the QoS flow or the Acct-Session-Id without QFI
extension and with 3GPP-NSAPI combination in the RADIUS Accounting-Request
(START).
If some external applications require RADIUS Accounting-Request (START)
information before they can process user packets, then the selected DNN (SMF)
may be configured in such a way that the UPF is instructed to drop user data
until the Accounting-Response (START) is received from the AAA server. The SMF
may wait for the Accounting-Response (START) before sending the final
authentication response message in Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
service operation. The SMF may reject the initial access request if the
Accounting-Response (START) is not received. The authentication and accounting
servers may be separately configured for each DNN.
For IPv4 PDU type, if IPv4 address is allocated via DHCPv4 signalling between
the UE and the DN-AAA after PDU session establishment, the SMF may wait to
send the Accounting-Request (START) message until the UE receives its IPv4
address in a DHCPACK.
When the SMF receives a message indicating a QoS flow or PDU session release
request and providing a RADIUS Accounting-Request (START) message was sent
previously, the SMF shall send a RADIUS Accounting-Request (STOP) message to
the DN-AAA server, which indicates the termination of this particular QoS flow
or PDU session. The SMF shall immediately send the corresponding response
(e.g. Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response) to the AMF, without waiting
for an Accounting-Response (STOP) message from the DN-AAA server.
The DN-AAA server shall deallocate the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix
initially allocated to the subscriber, if there is no session for the
subscriber.
Accounting-Request (ON) and Accounting-Request (OFF) messages may be sent from
the SMF to the DN-AAA server to ensure the correct synchronization of the
session information in the SMF and the DN-AAA server.
The SMF may send an Accounting-Request (ON) message to the DN-AAA server to
indicate that a restart has occurred. The DN-AAA server may then release the
associated resources.
Prior to a scheduled restart, the SMF may send Accounting-Request (OFF)
message to the DN-AAA server. The DN-AAA server may then release the
associated resources.
The following figure 11.2.1-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure
of RADIUS Authentication and Accounting between an SMF and a DN-AAA server:
1\. UE initiates the PDU Session Establishment procedure, including
authentication/authorization information.
2\. The AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request including the
authentication/authorization information to the SMF and the SMF responds to
the service operation.
According to the configuration in the SMF, step 6 to step 9 are executed
before step 3 if the SMF needs to send an EAP-Request message to the UE.
In the case of home routed, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext
Request including the authentication/authorization information to the V-SMF
and the V-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request including the
authentication/authorization information to the H-SMF.
3\. If the N4 session has not been established before, the SMF triggers the N4
Session Establishment procedure to the UPF.
In the case of home routed, the V-SMF triggers the N4 Session Establishment
procedure to the V-UPF and the H-SMF triggers the N4 Session Establishment
procedure to the H-UPF.
4\. The SMF sends the Access-Request message to the DN-AAA via the UPF, the
message is forwarded from the SMF to the DN-AAA by the UPF in N4 user plane
message.
In the case of home routed, the H-SMF sends the Access-Request message to the
DN-AAA via the H-UPF, the message is forwarded from the H-SMF to the DN-AAA by
the H-UPF in N4 user plane message.
5-10. The DN-AAA responds with the Access-Challenge message to the SMF via the
UPF, the message is forwarded from the DN-AAA to the SMF by the UPF in N4 user
plane message. The authentication/authorization information is further
transferred to UE via Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service and NAS
SM Transport message. UE responds to the received authentication/authorization
data and such information is transferred in NAS SM Transport message and
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service, then finally sent to the DN-AAA by
the SMF, via the UPF, in the Access-Request message.
In the case of home routed, the DN-AAA responds with the Access-Challenge
message to the H-SMF via the H-UPF, the message is forwarded from the DN-AAA
to the H-SMF by the H-UPF in N4 user plane message. The
authentication/authorization information is transferred to V-SMF via
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service and is further transferred to UE via
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service and NAS SM Transport message.
UE responds to the received authentication/authorization data and such
information is transferred in NAS SM Transport message,
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service and Nsmf_PDUSession_Update servic,
then finally sent to the DN-AAA by the H-SMF, via the H-UPF, in the Access-
Request message.
NOTE: Step 5 to step 10 can be repeated depending on the
authentication/authorization mechanism used (e.g. EAP-TLS).
11\. The SMF receives the final result of authentication/authorization from
the DN-AAA in the Access-Accept message, via the UPF.
12\. The SMF requests to start accounting by sending the Accounting-Request
(START) message to the DN-AAA via the UPF.
13\. The SMF proceeds with the PDU session establishment procedure and
includes the authentication/authorization information in
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service.
In the case of home routed, the H-SMF proceeds with the PDU session
establishment procedure and includes the authentication/authorization
information is transferred to V-SMF via Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service and is
further transferred to the AMF via Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
service.
14\. The DN-AAA responds with the Accounting-Response (START) message. The SMF
may wait for the Accounting-Response (START) before sending the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer request in step 13.
In the case of home routed, the H-SMF may wait for the Accounting-Response
(START) before sending the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service in step 13.
15\. The AMF sends the NAS PDU Session Establishment Request with the
authentication/authorization information to the UE.
16\. The UE sends a NAS message Deregistration Request to the AMF.
17\. The AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request to the SMF and the
SMF responds to the service operation.
In the case of home routed, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext
Request to the V-SMF and the V-SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_Release Request
to the H-SMF.
18-19. The SMF requests to stop accounting by sending the Accounting-Request
(STOP) message to the DN-AAA via the UPF and the DN-AAA responds with the
Accounting-Response (STOP) message.
Figure 11.2.1-1: RADIUS Authentication and Accounting example (successful
case)
When PAP/CHAP is used as the authentication protocol with the external DN-AAA
server which does not support EAP for the 5GS or for the 5GC, the RADIUS
Authentication procedures refer to the non transparent access procedures in
clause 11.2.1 and the related RADIUS Authentication description in clause
16.3a.1 in 3GPP TS 29.061 [5] are reused with the following differences:
\- the SMF performs the actions specified for the P-GW;
\- the external DN-AAA server performs the actions specified for AAA;
\- PDU Session Establishment request is sent from the UE to the SMF instead of
the Activate PDN connection request being sent from the UE to the S-GW and the
Create Session request being sent from S-GW to P-GW;
\- PDU Session Establishment accept is sent from the SMF to the UE instead of
the Create Session Response message being sent from the P-GW to S-GW and the
Activate PDN Connection Accept being sent from S-GW to the UE; and
\- PDU Session Establishment reject is sent from the SMF to the UE instead of
the Create Session Response message being sent from the P-GW to the S-GW and
the Activate PDN Connection Reject being sent from S-GW to the UE.
### 11.2.1a Authentication and Authorization procedures in EPC Interworking
When an SMF+PGW-C receives a Create Session Request message for a given DNN
from the MME, the SMF+PGW-C may (depending on the configuration for this DNN)
send a RADIUS Access-Request message with EAP extension to a DN-AAA server.
Upon receipt of the Access-Request message, the DN-AAA server shall respond
with an Access-Challenge message. Multi-round authentication using the Access-
Challenge (sent by DN-AAA) and Access-Request messages may be used. The DN-AAA
server finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with an
Access Accept message. If the DN-AAA server is also responsible for IPv4
address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation, the DN-AAA server shall return the
allocated IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix in the Access-Accept message.
For re-authentication and re-authorization, the SMF+PGW-C shall send a RADIUS
Access-Request message with EAP extension and the DN-AAA shall respond with an
Access-Challenge message. Multi-round authentication using the Access-
Challenge (sent by DN-AAA) and Access-Request messages may be used. The DN-AAA
server finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with an
Access Accept message.
The SMF+PGW-C may initiate RADIUS re-authorization procedures for the purpose
of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation (or renew the lease). In this
case, the SMF+PGW-C shall set the Service-Type attribute to \"Authorize Only\"
and the 3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type attribute to the type of IP address to be
allocated in the Access-Request message sent to the DN-AAA server. If the
SMF+PGW-C is using DHCP signalling towards the UE and the DN-AAA server
includes the Session-Timeout attribute in the Access-Accept, the SMF+PGW-C may
use the Session-Timeout value as the DHCP lease time. The SMF+PGW-C shall not
set the DHCP lease time value higher than the Session-Timeout value. The
SMF+PGW-C may renew the DHCP lease to the UE without re-authorization towards
the DN-AAA server providing that the new lease expiry is no later than the
Session-Timeout timer expiry. If the SMF+PGW-C wishes to extend the lease time
beyond the current Session-Timeout expiry, it shall initiate a new AAA re-
authorization.
When the SMF+PGW-C receives a message indicating a QoS flow or PDN connection
release request, the SMF+PGW-C shall send a RADIUS Accounting-Request (STOP)
message to the DN-AAA server, which indicates the termination of this
particular QoS flow or PDN connection. The SMF+PGW-C shall immediately send
the corresponding response to the MME, without waiting for an Accounting-
Response (STOP) message from the DN-AAA server.
The DN-AAA server shall deallocate the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix
initially allocated to the subscriber, if there is no session for the
subscriber.
Accounting-Request (ON) and Accounting-Request (OFF) messages may be sent from
the SMF+PGW-C to the DN-AAA server to ensure the correct synchronization of
the session information in the SMF+PGW-C and the DN-AAA server.
The SMF+PGW-C may send an Accounting-Request (ON) message to the DN-AAA server
to indicate that a restart has occurred. The DN-AAA server may then release
the associated resources.
Prior to a scheduled restart, the SMF+PGW-C may send Accounting-Request (OFF)
message to the DN-AAA server. The DN-AAA server may then release the
associated resources.
Figure 11.2.1a-1: RADIUS Authentication and Accounting example (successful
case)
The above figure 11.2.1a-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of
RADIUS Authentication and Accounting between an SMF+PGW-C and a DN-AAA server:
1\. UE initiates the PDN Connection Establishment procedure, including
authentication/authorization information.
2\. The MME sends Create Session Request including the
authentication/authorization information to the SMF+PGW-C.
According to the configuration in the SMF+PGW-C, step 6 to step 10 are
executed before step 3 if the SMF+PGW-C needs to send an EAP-Request message
to the UE.
3\. If the N4 session has not been established before, the SMF+PGW-C triggers
the N4 Session Establishment procedure to the UPF+PGW-U and sets the N4 rules
to block any UE traffic over the PDN Connection (until the Secondary DN
authentication and authorization has been completed successfully).
4\. The SMF+PGW-C sends the Access-Request message to the DN-AAA via the
UPF+PGW-U in the N4 user plane.
5-11. The DN-AAA responds with the Access-Challenge message to the SMF+PGW-C
via the UPF+PGW-U in the N4 use plane message. The
authentication/authorization information is further transferred to UE via
Create Session Response and Downlink NAS Transport message, along with uplink
data not allowed indication within the PCO attribute. UE responds to the
received authentication/authorization data and such information is transferred
in Uplink NAS Transport message and Modify Bearer Request, then finally sent
to the DN-AAA by the SMF+PGW-C, via the UPF+PGW-U, in the Access-Request
message.
12-17. The DN-AAA responds with the Access-Challenge message to the SMF+PGW-C
via the UPF+PGW-U in the N4 use plane message. The
authentication/authorization information is further transferred to UE via
Update bearer Response and Downlink NAS Transport message. UE responds to the
received authentication/authorization data and such information is transferred
in Uplink NAS Transport message and Update Bearer Response, then finally sent
to the DN-AAA by the SMF+PGW-C, via the UPF+PGW-U, in the Access-Request
message.
NOTE: Step 12 to step 17 can be repeated depending on the
authentication/authorization mechanism used (e.g. EAP-TLS).
18\. The SMF+PGW-C receives the final result of authentication/authorization
from the DN-AAA in the Access-Accept message, via the UPF+PGW-U.
19\. The SMF+PGW-C updates the N4 rules to allow UE traffic over the PDN
connection.
20\. The SMF+PGW-C requests to start accounting by sending the Accounting-
Request (START) message to the DN-AAA via the UPF+PGW-U.
21\. The SMF+PGW-C proceeds with PDN connection establishment procedure and
includes the authentication/authorization information in the Update Bearer
Request message with uplink data allowed indication within the PCO attribute,
sent to the MME.
22\. The DN-AAA responds with the Accounting-Response (START) message. The
SMF+PGW-C may wait for the Accounting-Response (START) before sending the
Update Bearer Request in step 21.
23\. The MME sends the Downlink NAS Transport message with Session Management
Request with the authentication/authorization information to the UE.
24\. The UE sends a Uplink NAS Transport message with Session Management
Response to the MME.
25\. The MME sends Update Bearer Response to the SMF+PGW-C, after which user
data is allowed over the PDN connection.
26-30. At any point, if the UE triggers Detach procedure and send Detech
request to the MME then MME sends Delete Session Request message to the
SMF+PGW-C, which responds with Delete Session Response message. The SMF+PGW-C
requests to stop accounting by sending the Accounting-Request (STOP) message
to the DN-AAA via the UPF+PGW-U and the DN-AAA responds with the Accounting-
Response (STOP) message.
### 11.2.2 Accounting Update
During the life of a QoS flow some information related to this QoS flow may
change. The SMF may send RADIUS Accounting Request Interim-Update to the DN-
AAA server upon occurrence of a chargeable event, e.g. RAT change, DNAI change
or QoS change. Interim updates are also used when the IPv4 address and/or IPv6
prefix is allocated/released/re-allocated.
NOTE: DNAI change is only applicable when application relocation possible
indicated in the AF traffic influenced PCC rule as described in clause 5.6.7
of TS 23.501 [2], align with the DNAI change in UP path management events as
described in clause 4.3.6.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. Only the target DNAI is provided
in the ACR message. The change from the UP path status where a DNAI applies to
a status where no DNAI applies indicating the de-activation of the AF request
for AF influence on traffic routing is not supported in this release.
When the SMF receives a signalling request (i.e.
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext) that indicates the occurrence of one of these
chargeable events, the SMF may send an Accounting Request Interim-Update to
the DN-AAA server to update the necessary information related to this QoS
flow. It is not necessary for the SMF to wait for the RADIUS
AccountingResponse message from the DN-AAA server before sending the response
for the triggering signalling message (i.e.
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer). The SMF may delete the QoS flow if
the AccountingResponse is not received from the DN-AAA server.
The SMF may also send interim updates at the expiry of an operator configured
time limit.
Figure 11.2.2-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of RADIUS
accounting update, messages between the SMF and DN-AAA are forwarded by the
UPF in N4 user plane message.
Figure 11.2.2-1: RADIUS accounting update
For the 5GC and EPC interworking scenario without authentication,
authorization, re-authentication and/or re-authorization impacts, if the UE
establishes the PDU session through the 5GC and initiates the accounting
session, when the SMF+PGW-C determines that the UE has moved to the EPS (i.e.
the SMF+PGW-C receives the modify bearer request or create session request
from the S-GW), the SMF+PGW-C may perform the accounting session update with
the following modifications:
\- for the case that the accounting session is initiated per PDU session, the
SMF+PGW-C may update the accounting session by including the identifier of the
accounting session within the Acct-Session-Id, the \"EUTRA\" within the 3GPP-
RAT-Type, the IPv4 address of S-GW within the 3GPP-SGSN-Address, the default
EPS bearer id within the 3GPP-NSAPI, the user location in the EPC within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info if available and the new QoS profile within the 3GPP-
GPRS-Negotiated-QoS-Profile if changed.
\- for the case that the accounting session is initiated per QoS flow:
\- if the SMF+PGW-C mapped a QoS flow to an EPS bearer, the SMF may update the
accounting session corresponding to the QoS flow with the information of the
EPS bearer by including the identifier of the accounting session within the
Acct-Session-Id, the \"EUTRA\" within the 3GPP-RAT-Type, the IPv4 address of
S-GW within the 3GPP-SGSN-Address, the EPS bearer id within the 3GPP-NSAPI,
the user location in the EPC within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info if available,
the new QoS profile within the 3GPP-GPRS-Negotiated-QoS-Profile if changed,
the new charging id within the 3GPP-Charging-Id VSA or 3GPP-Charging-Id-v2 VSA
according to the length of the Charging Id if allocated and the new packet
filters within the 3GPP-Packet-Filter if changed;
\- if the SMF+PGW-C mapped multiple QoS flows to one EPS bearer, the SMF shall
select one of the accouting sessions corresponding to these QoS flows to
update it as above and terminate the accounting session(s) corresponding to
the other QoS flow(s).
\- if the SMF+PGW-C did not map a QoS flow to any EPS bearer, the SMF may
decide to associate the corresponding account session to the default EPS
bearer or terminate the corresponding accounting session.
### 11.2.3 DN-AAA initiated QoS flow termination
RADIUS is used as the protocol between the SMF and the DN-AAA server or proxy
for applications (e.g. MMS) to deliver information related to user session.
However some IP applications could need to interwork with the SMF to release
the corresponding resource (e.g. terminate a particular QoS flow). For this
purpose, the DN-AAA server or proxy may send a RADIUS Disconnect-Request to
the SMF. On receipt of the Disconnect-Request from the DN-AAA server, the SMF
shall release the corresponding resources and reply with a Disconnect-ACK. If
the SMF is unable to release the corresponding resources, it shall reply to
the DN-AAA server with a Disconnect-NAK. For more information on RADIUS
Disconnect, see IETF RFC 5176 [27]. If the SMF deletes the corresponding QoS
flow, it is not necessary for the SMF to wait for the response (i.e.
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext) from the AMF before sending the RADIUS
Disconnect-ACK to the DN-AAA server. The DN-AAA shall include the
identification of the QoS flow to be disconnected within the Disconnect-
Request. How to identify the QoS flow to be deleted is implementation
specific.
NOTE: The QoS flow can be identified by the Acct-Session-Id which is extended
to include QFI or by the Acct-Session-Id and 3GPP-NSAPI combination if
provided by the SMF.
The Teardown-Indicator in the RADIUS Disconnect Request message indicates to
the SMF that all QoS flows for this particular user and sharing the same user
session shall be deleted. The QoS flows that belong to the same PDU session
can be are identified by the Acct-Session-Id. The SMF is able to find out all
the related QoS flows sharing the same user session once it has found the
exact QoS flow from the Acct-Session-Id. If a user has the same user IP
address for different sets of QoS flows towards different networks, only the
QoS flows linked to the one identified by the Acct-Session-Id shall be
deleted. If the value of Teardown-Indicator is set to \"0\" or if TI is
missing, and if the Acct-Session-Id and 3GPP-NSAPI if provided identifies the
QoS flow associated with the default QoS rule, the SMF shall tear down all the
QoS flows that share the same user session identified by the Acct-Session-Id.
Figure 11.2.3-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of DN-AAA
initiated QoS flow termination, messages between the SMF and DN-AAA are
forwarded by the UPF in N4 user plane message.
Figure 11.2.3-1: DN-AAA initiated QoS flow termination with RADIUS
For the 5GC and EPC interworking scenario, when the DN-AAA server initiates
the QoS flow termination, the SMF+PGW-C shall send the delete bearer request
to the S-GW as defined in clause 5.4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [53] to delete the
EPS bearer corresponding to the accounting session if the UE has moved to the
EPS.
### 11.2.4 DN-AAA initiated re-authorization in 5GC
Some IP applications could need to interwork with the SMF to update the PDU
session authorization attributes. For this purpose, the DN-AAA server or proxy
may send a RADIUS CoA-Request to the SMF. On receipt of the CoA-Request from
the DN-AAA server, if the service-type value of \"Authorize Only\" is not
included, the SMF shall update the corresponding PDU session authorization
attributes and reply with a CoA-ACK; otherwise it shall follow the procedure
described in IETF RFC 5176 [27]. DN-AAA may also use CoA procedure to revoke
the authorization of a PDU session, or to update the authorization data (e.g.
allowed UE MAC addresses).
If the SMF updates/deletes the corresponding PDU session, it is not necessary
for the SMF to wait for Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext from the AMF before
sending the RADIUS CoA-ACK to the DN-AAA server.
Figure 11.2.4-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of DN-AAA
initiated re-authorization, messages between the SMF and DN-AAA are forwarded
by the UPF in N4 user plane message.
Figure 11.2.4-1: DN-AAA initiated re-authorization with RADIUS
NOTE: The DN-AAA initiated re-authorization procedure is not applicable for
legacy DN-AAA supporting the RADIUS procedures over SGi interface as specified
in 3GPP TS 29.061 [5].
### 11.2.4a DN-AAA initiated re-authorization in EPC Interworking
Some IP applications could need to interwork with the SMF+PGW-C to update the
PDN connection authorization attributes. For this purpose, the DN-AAA server
or proxy may send a RADIUS CoA-Request to the SMF+PGW-C. On receipt of the
CoA-Request from the DN-AAA server, if the service-type value of \"Authorize
Only\" is not included, the SMF shall update the corresponding PDN connection
authorization attributes and reply with a CoA-ACK; otherwise it shall follow
the procedure described in IETF RFC 5176 [27]. DN-AAA may also use CoA
procedure to revoke the authorization of a PDN connection, or to update the
authorization data (e.g. allowed UE MAC addresses).
If the SMF+PGW-C updates/deletes the corresponding PDN connection, it is not
necessary for the SMF+PGW-C to wait for Update Bearer Response from the MME
before sending the RADIUS CoA-ACK to the DN-AAA server.
Figure 11.2.4-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of DN-AAA
initiated re-authorization, messages between the SMF+PGW-C and DN-AAA are
forwarded by the UPF+PGW-U in N4 user plane message.

NOTE: The DN-AAA initiated re-authorization procedure is not applicable for
legacy DN-AAA supporting the RADIUS procedures over SGi interface as specified
in 3GPP TS 29.061 [5].

# 12 Interworking with DN-AAA (Diameter)
## 12.1 Diameter Procedures
### 12.1.1 Diameter Authentication and Authorization
The SMF also represents the H-SMF in the home routed scenario in this clause
unless specified otherwise.
Diameter Authentication and Authorization shall be used according to IETF RFC
7155 [23]. In 5G, multiple authentication methods using Extensible
Authentication Protocol (EAP) may be used such as EAP-TLS (see IETF RFC 5216
[11]), EAP-TTLS (see IETF RFC 5281 [37]). The SMF shall support Diameter EAP
application as specified in IETF RFC 4072 [25].
The SMF and the DN-AAA shall advertise the support of the Diameter NASREQ and
EAP applications by including the value (1 and 5) of the application
identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP (as specified in IETF RFC 4072 [25])
and the value of the 3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Capabilities-
Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands as specified in
IETF RFC 6733 [24], i.e. as part of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP.
The Diameter client function may reside in an SMF. When the SMF receives an
initial access request (i.e. the SMF receives the
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext request with type \"Initial request\" for non-
roaming case or local breakout case, or the H-SMF receives the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request with type \"Initial request\" for home routed
case), the Diameter client function may send the authentication information to
a DN-AAA server, which is identified during the DNN provisioning.
When the legacy applications require PAP/CHAP authentication with the UE
accessing to the 5GS and the legacy DN-AAA server does not support EAP,
PAP/CHAP may be used as the authentication protocol, with the external network
performing the risk assessment.
The DN-AAA server performs authentication and authorization. The response
(when positive) may contain network information, such as an IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix for the user when the SMF is interworking with the DN-AAA
server.
The information delivered during the Diameter authentication can be used to
automatically correlate the user identity (e.g. SUPI) to the IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix, if applicable, assigned/confirmed by the SMF or the DN-AAA
server respectively. The same procedure applies, in case of sending the
authentication to a \'proxy\' DN-AAA server.
For 5G, Diameter Authentication is applicable to the initial access request.
When the SMF receives a positive response from the DN-AAA server it shall
complete the initial access procedure. If DEA with Result-Code set to
DIAMETER_AUTHENTICATION_REJECTED or no response is received, the SMF shall
reject the initial access procedure with a suitable cause code.
When DN-AAA server authorizes the PDU Session Establishment, it may send DN
authorization data for the established PDU Session to the SMF. The DN
authorization data for the established PDU Session may include one or more of
the following:
\- a reference to authorization data for policy and charging control locally
configured in the SMF;
\- a list of allowed MAC addresses (maximum 16) for the Ethernet PDU Session;
\- a list of allowed VLAN Ids (maximum 16) for the Ethernet PDU Session;
\- Session-AMBR for the PDU Session;
\- L2TP information, such as LNS IP address and/or LNS host name; and
\- Framed Route information for the PDU Session.
> NOTE 1: If the DN-AAA server send L2TP information to SMF, the L2PT
> information can e.g. be provisioned per DNN/S-NSSAI or per SUPI or GPSI by
> configuration which is out of the scope of 3GPP specifications.
SMF policies may require DN authorization without DN authentication. In that
case, when contacting the DN-AAA server for authorization, the SMF shall
provide the GPSI of the UE if available.
The SMF may also use the Diameter re-authorization procedure for the purpose
of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation to the UE. The use cases that
may lead this procedure are:
\- IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation after UPF selection during PDU
session establishment procedure.
\- IPv6 prefix allocation during adding additional PDU Session Anchor
procedure for IPv6 multi-homing.
\- IPv4 address allocation via DHCPv4 procedure after successful PDU session
establishment procedure.
The SMF may also trigger request for DN authentication/authorization and/or IP
address/prefix allocation based on UE subscription data retrieve from the UDM
as defined in clause 5.2.2.2.5 of 3GPP TS 29.503.
When an IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix (including any additional IPv6 prefix
of IPv6 multi-homing) is (re-)allocated or de-allocated (not causing the PDU
session to be released) by using a method not via the DN-AAA server and if the
SMF was required by the DN-AAA server to report such change during
authentication procedure or by local configuration, the SMF shall, if
applicable, use the authentication session that was established before to
inform the DN-AAA server by sending Diameter DER or AAR with the latest list
of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix(es).
When the SMF is notified by the UPF regarding the UE MAC address change (a new
one is detected or a used one is inactive), if the SMF was required by the DN-
AAA server to report such change during authentication procedure or by local
configuration, the SMF shall, if applicable, use the authentication session
that was established before to inform the DN-AAA server by sending Diameter
DER or AAR with the latest list of UE MAC addresses in use.
DN-AAA may initiate QoS flow termination, see details in clause 12.2.3. DN-AAA
may initiate re-authorization and optional re-authentication, see details in
clause 12.2.4 and 12.2.5.
### 12.1.1a Diameter Authentication and Authorization in EPC Interworking
Diameter Authentication and Authorization shall be used according to IETF RFC
7155 [23]. Multiple authentication methods using Extensible Authentication
Protocol (EAP) may be used such as EAP-TLS (see IETF RFC 5216 [11]), EAP-TTLS
(see IETF RFC 5281 [37]). The SMF+PGW-C shall support Diameter EAP application
as specified in IETF RFC 4072 [25].
The SMF+PGW-C and the DN-AAA shall advertise the support of the Diameter
NASREQ and EAP applications by including the value (1 and 5) of the
application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP (as specified in IETF
RFC 4072 [25]) and the value of the 3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the
Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [24], i.e. as part of the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVP.
The Diameter client function may reside in an SMF+PGW-C. When the SMF+PGW-C
receives new Create Session Request and the Session Management Subscription
Data from the UDM or local configuration indicate the need for EAP-based
secondary authentication and authorization by DN-AAA, the Diameter client
function may send the authentication information to a DN-AAA server, which is
identified during the DNN provisioning.
When the legacy applications require PAP/CHAP authentication with the UE
accessing the 5GC and EPC interworking scenario and the legacy DN-AAA server
does not support EAP, PAP/CHAP may be used as the authentication protocol,
with the external network performing the risk assessment.
The DN-AAA server performs authentication and authorization. The response
(when positive) may contain network information, such as an IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix for the user when the SMF+PGW-C is interworking with the
DN-AAA server.
The information delivered during the Diameter authentication can be used to
automatically correlate the user identity (e.g. SUPI) to the IPv4 address
and/or IPv6 prefix, if applicable, assigned/confirmed by the SMF+PGW-C or the
DN-AAA server respectively. The same procedure applies, in case of sending the
authentication to a \'proxy\' DN-AAA server.
When the SMF+PGW-C receives a positive response from the DN-AAA server it
shall complete the initial access procedure. If Access-Reject or no response
is received, the SMF+PGW-C shall reject the initial access procedure with a
suitable cause code.
When DN-AAA server authorizes the PDN Connection Establishment, it may send DN
authorization data for the established PDN Connection to the SMF+PGW-C. The DN
authorization data for the established PDN Connection may include one or more
of the following:
\- a reference to authorization data for policy and charging control locally
configured in the SMF+PGW-C;
\- a list of allowed MAC addresses (maximum 16) for the Ethernet PDN
Connection;
\- a list of allowed VLAN Ids (maximum 16) for the Ethernet PDN Connection;
\- Session-AMBR for the PDU Connection;
\- L2TP information, such as LNS IP address and/or LNS host name; and
\- Framed Route information for the PDU Connection.
> NOTE 1: If the DN-AAA server send L2TP information to SMF+PGW-C, the L2PT
> information can e.g. be provisioned per DNN/S-NSSAI or per SUPI or GPSI by
> configuration which is out of the scope of 3GPP specifications.
SMF+PGW-C policies may require DN authorization without DN authentication. In
that case, when contacting the DN-AAA server for authorization, the SMF+PGW-C
shall provide the GPSI of the UE if available.
The SMF may also use the Diameter re-authorization procedure for the purpose
of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation to the UE. The use cases that
may lead this procedure are:
\- IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation after UPF selection during PDU
connection establishment procedure.
\- IPv6 prefix allocation during adding additional PDN connection Anchor
procedure for IPv6 multi-homing.
\- IPv4 address allocation via DHCPv4 procedure after successful PDN
connection establishment procedure.
The SMF+PGW-C may also trigger request for DN authentication/authorization
and/or IP address/prefix allocation based on UE subscription data retrieve
from the UDM as defined in clause 5.2.2.2.5 of 3GPP TS 29.503.
When an IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix (including any additional IPv6 prefix
of IPv6 multi-homing) is (re-)allocated or de-allocated (not causing the PDN
connection to be released) by using a method not via the DN-AAA server and if
the SMF+PGW-C was required by the DN-AAA server to report such change during
authentication procedure or by local configuration, the SMF+PGW-C shall, if
applicable, use the authentication session that was established before to
inform the DN-AAA server by sending Diameter DER or AAR with the latest list
of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix(es).
When the SMF+PGW-C is notified by the UPF+PGW-U regarding the UE MAC address
change (a new one is detected or a used one is inactive), if the SMF+PGW-C was
required by the DN-AAA server to report such change during authentication
procedure or by local configuration, the SMF+PGW-C shall, if applicable, use
the authentication session that was established before to inform the DN-AAA
server by sending Diameter DER or AAR with the latest list of UE MAC addresses
in use.
DN-AAA may initiate QoS flow termination, see details in clause 12.2.3. DN-AAA
may initiate re-authorization and optional re-authentication, see details in
clause 12.2.4 and 12.2.5.
In case EAP based authentication and authorization has been performed for the
PDU Session while the UE was in 5GS, and if SMF+PGW-C determines that the UE
has moved to the EPS (i.e. the SMF+PGW-C receives the modify bearer request or
create session request from the S-GW), the following applies:
\- the SMF+PGW-C may initiate Diameter re-authorization procedure without re-
authentication with the DN-AAA server based on local policy.
\- DN-AAA initiated re-authorization without re-authentication may be
performed.
\- when the SMF+PGW-C receives a re-authentication request from the DN-AAA
server, the SMF+PGW-C shall execute the procedure as described in clause
12.2.5.
NOTE 2: The DN-AAA server decided actions to take (e.g. to request another re-
authorization without the association with EAP based re-authentication or
release the session) are out of 3GPP scope.
### 12.1.2 Diameter Accounting
Diameter Accounting shall be used according to IETF RFC 7155 [23].
The SMF and the DN-AAA may advertise the support of the Diameter base
accounting application by including the value (3) of the application
identifier in the Acct-Application-Id AVP and the value of the 3GPP (10415) in
the Vendor-Id AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-
Exchange-Answer commands as specified in IETF RFC 6733 [24], i.e. as part of
the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP.
The Diameter accounting client function may reside in an SMF. The Diameter
accounting client may send information to a DN-AAA server, which is identified
during the DNN provisioning. The DN-AAA server may store this information and
use it to automatically identify the user. This information can be trusted
because the 3GPP network has authenticated the subscriber (i.e. USIM card and
possibly other authentication methods).
The SMF may use the Diameter Accounting messages during QoS flow (e.g. QoS
flow associated with the default QoS rule) establishment and termination
procedures, respectively.
If the DN-AAA server is used for IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix assignment,
then, upon reception of a Diameter Accounting-Request STOP message for all QoS
flows associated to a PDU session defined by DNN and SUPI or GPSI, the DN-AAA
server may make the associated IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix available for
assignment.
When an IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix (including any additional IPv6 prefix
of IPv6 multi-homing) is (re-)allocated or de-allocated (not causing the PDU
session to be released) by using a method not via the DN-AAA server and if the
SMF was required by the DN-AAA server to report such change during
authentication procedure or by local configuration, the SMF shall, if
applicable, use the accounting session that was established before to inform
the DN-AAA server by sending Diameter Accounting-Request Interim-Update with
the latest list of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix(es).
When the SMF is notified by the UPF regarding the UE MAC address change (a new
one is detected or a used one is inactive), if the SMF was required by the DN-
AAA server to report such change during authentication procedure or by local
configuration, the SMF shall, if applicable, use the accounting session that
was established before to inform the DN-AAA server by sending Diameter
Accounting-Request Interim-Update with the latest list of UE MAC addresses in
use.
## 12.2 Message flows on N6 interface
### 12.2.1 Authentication, Authorization and Accounting procedures
The SMF also represents the H-SMF in the home routed scenario in this clause
unless specified otherwise.
When an SMF receives an initial access request (i.e. the SMF receives the
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext request with type \"Initial request\" for non-
roaming case or local breakout case, or the H-SMF receives the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request with type \"Initial request\" for home routed
case) message for a given DNN, the SMF may (depending on the configuration for
this DNN) send a Diameter DER message to a DN-AAA server. The SMF may also
(depending on the configuration for this DNN) send the S-NSSAI and the PDU
Session ID that are associated with the PDU Session, respectively in the 3GPP-
Session-S-NSSAI AVP and the 3GPP-Session-Id AVP, to a DN-AAA server. Upon
receipt of the DER message, the DN-AAA server shall respond with an DEA
message. Multi-round authentication using the DEA DEA (with Result-Code set to
DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH) and DER messages may be used. The DN-AAA server
finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with the DEA message
with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. If the DN-AAA server is also
responsible for IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation, the DN-AAA server
shall return the allocated IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix in the DEA message.
For re-authentication and re-authorization, the SMF shall send a DER message
to the DN-AAA server and the DN-AAA server shall respond with a DEA message.
Multi-round authentication using the DEA (with Result-Code set to
DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH) and DER messages may be used. The DN-AAA server
finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with the DEA message
with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
The SMF may initiate Diameter re-authorization procedures for the purpose of
IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation (or renew the lease). In this case,
the SMF shall set the Session-Id to the value used in the initial request, the
Auth-Request-Type AVP to \"AUTHORIZE_ONLY\" and the 3GPP-Allocate-IP-Type AVP
to the type of IP address to be allocated in the AA-Request message sent to
the AAA server. If the SMF is using DHCP signalling towards the UE and the DN-
AAA server includes the Session-Timeout attribute in the DEA, the SMF may use
the Session-Timeout value as the DHCP lease time. The SMF shall not set the
DHCPv4 lease time value higher than the Session-Timeout value. The SMF may
renew the DHCP lease to the UE without re-authorization towards the DN-AAA
server providing that the new lease expiry is no later than the Session-
Timeout timer expiry. If the SMF wishes to extend the lease time beyond the
current Session-Timeout expiry, it shall initiate a new AAA re-authorization.
Even if the SMF was not involved in user authentication, it may send a
Diameter Accounting-Request (START) message to a DN-AAA server. If no Diameter
session is already open for the same PDU session a Diameter session needs to
be activated, otherwise the existing Diameter session is used to send the
Accounting-Request (START). If accounting is used per QoS flow, the QFI will
identify the particular bearer this accounting message refers to. This message
contains parameters, e.g. the tuple which includes the user ID and IPv4
address and/or IPv6 prefix, to be used by application servers (e.g. WAP
gateway) in order to identify the user, the 3GPP-Charging-Id AVP or 3GPP-
Charging-Id-v2 AVP according to the length of the Charging Id for the user
session. This message may also (depending on the configuration for the DNN)
contains the S-NSSAI and the PDU Session ID that are associated with the PDU
Session, respectively in the 3GPP-Session-S-NSSAI AVP and the 3GPP-Session-Id
AVP, and/or AF traffic influence PCC rule provisioned and then SMF used DNAI
in the 3GPP-DNAI AVP, to a DN-AAA server. This message also indicates to the
DN-AAA server that the user session has started.
If some external applications require Diameter Accounting-Request (START)
information before they can process user packets, then the selected DNN (SMF)
may be configured in such a way that the SMF drops user data until an
Accounting-Answer (START) indicating success is received from the DN-AAA
server. The SMF may wait for the Accounting-Answer (START) before sending the
final authentication response message in
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation. The SMF may reject
the initial access request if the Accounting-Answer (START) is not received.
The authentication and accounting servers may be separately configured for
each DNN.
For IPv4 PDU type, if IPv4 address is allocated via DHCPv4 signalling between
the UE and the DN-AAA after PDU session establishment, the SMF may wait to
send the Accounting-Request START message until the UE receives its IPv4
address in a DHCPACK.
When the SMF receives a message indicating a QoS flow or PDU session release
request and providing a Diameter Accounting-Request START message was sent
previously, the SMF shall send a Diameter Accounting-Request (STOP) message to
the DN-AAA server, which indicates the termination of this particular QoS flow
or PDU session. The SMF shall immediately send the corresponding response
(e.g. Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext response) to the AMF, without waiting
for an Accounting-Answer (STOP) message from the DN-AAA server.
If the last QoS flow of a PDU session is deactivated, the SMF shall
additionally send an STR message to the DN-AAA server. The DN-AAA server shall
reply with an STA message and shall deallocate the IPv4 address and/or IPv6
prefix initially allocated to the subscriber.
The following figure 12.2.1-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure
of Diameter Authentication and Accounting between an SMF and a DN-AAA server:
1\. UE initiates the PDU Session Establishment procedure, including
authentication/authorization information.
2\. The AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request including the
authentication/authorization information to the SMF and the SMF responds to
the service operation.
According to the configuration in the SMF, step 6 to step 9 are executed
before step 3 if the SMF needs to send an EAP-Request message to the UE.
In the case of home routed, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext
Request including the authentication/authorization information to the V-SMF
and the V-SMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request including the
authentication/authorization information to the H-SMF.
3\. If the N4 session has not been established before, the SMF triggers the N4
Session Establishment procedure to the UPF.
In the case of home routed, the V-SMF triggers the N4 Session Establishment
procedure to the V-UPF and the H-SMF triggers the N4 Session Establishment
procedure to the H-UPF.
4\. The SMF sends the DER message to the DN-AAA via the UPF, the message is
forwarded from the SMF to the DN-AAA by the UPF in N4 user plane message.
In the case of home routed, the H-SMF sends the DER message to the DN-AAA via
the H-UPF, the message is forwarded from the H-SMF to the DN-AAA by the H-UPF
in N4 user plane message.
5-10. The DN-AAA responds with the DEA message to the SMF via the UPF, the
message is forwarded from the DN-AAA to the SMF by the UPF in N4 user plane
message. The authentication/authorization information is further transferred
to UE via Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service and NAS SM Transport
message. UE responds to the received authentication/authorization data and
such information is transferred in NAS SM Transport message and
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service, then finally sent to the DN-AAA by
the SMF, via the UPF, in the DER message.
In the case of home routed, the DN-AAA responds with the DEA message to the
H-SMF via the H-UPF, the message is forwarded from the DN-AAA to the H-SMF by
the H-UPF in N4 user plane message. The authentication/authorization
information is transferred to V-SMF via Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service and is
further transferred to UE via Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service
and NAS SM Transport message. UE responds to the received
authentication/authorization data and such information is transferred in NAS
SM Transport message, Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext service and
Nsmf_PDUSession_Update servic, then finally sent to the DN-AAA by the H-SMF,
via the H-UPF, in the DER message.
NOTE: Step 5 to step 10 can be repeated depending on the
authentication/authorization mechanism used (e.g. EAP-TLS).
11\. The SMF receives final result of authentication/authorization from the
DN-AAA in the DEA message, via the UPF.
12\. The SMF requests to start accounting by sending the Accounting-Request
(START) message to the DN-AAA via the UPF.
13\. The SMF proceeds with the PDU session establishment procedure and
includes the authentication/authorization information in
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service.
In the case of home routed, the H-SMF proceeds with the PDU session
establishment procedure and includes the authentication/authorization
information is transferred to V-SMF via Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service and is
further transferred to the AMF via Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
service.
14\. The DN-AAA responds with the Accounting-Response (START) message. The SMF
may wait for the Accounting-Response (START) before sending the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer request in step 13.
In the case of home routed, the H-SMF may wait for the Accounting-Response
(START) before sending the Nsmf_PDUSession_Update service in step 13.
15\. The AMF sends the NAS PDU Session Establishment Request with the
authentication/authorization information to the UE.
16\. The UE sends a NAS message Deregistration Request to the AMF.
17\. The AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Request to the SMF and the
SMF responds to the service operation.
In the case of home routed, the AMF sends Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext
Request to the V-SMF and the V-SMF sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_Release Request
to the H-SMF.
18-19. The SMF requests to stop accounting by sending the Accounting-Request
(STOP) message to the DN-AAA via the UPF and the DN-AAA responds with the
Accounting-Response (STOP) message.
Figure 12.2.1-1: Diameter Authentication and Accounting example (successful
case)
When PAP/CHAP is used as the authentication protocol with the external DN-AAA
server which does not support EAP for the 5GS, the Diameter Authentication
procedures refer to the non transparent access procedures in clause 11.2.1 and
related Diameter Authentication descriptions in clause 16a.3a.1 in 3GPP TS
29.061 [5] are reused with the following differences:
\- the SMF performs the actions specified for the P-GW;
\- the external DN-AAA server performs the actions specified for AAA;
\- PDU Session Establishment request is sent from the UE to the SMF instead of
or the Activate PDN connection request being sent from the UE to the S-GW and
the Create Session request being sent from S-GW to P-GW;
\- PDU Session Establishment accept is sent from the SMF to the UE instead of
the Create Session Response message being sent from the P-GW to S-GW and the
Activate PDN Connection Accept being sent from S-GW to the UE; and
\- PDU Session Establishment reject is sent from the SMF to the UE instead of
the Create Session Response message being sent from the P-GW to the S-GW and
the Activate PDN Connection Reject being sent from S-GW to the UE.
### 12.2.1a Authentication and Authorization procedures in EPC Interworking
When an SMF+PGW-C receives a Create Session Request message for a given DNN
from the MME, the SMF+PGW-C may (depending on the configuration for this DNN)
send a Diameter DER message to a DN-AAA server. Upon receipt of the DER
message, the DN-AAA server shall respond with an Diameter DEA message. Multi-
round authentication using the DEA (with Result-Code set to
DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH) and DER messages may be used. The DN-AAA server
finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with a DEA message
with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS. If the DN-AAA server is also
responsible for IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation, the DN-AAA server
shall return the allocated IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix in the DEA message.
For re-authentication and re-authorization, the SMF+PGW-C shall send a
Diameter DER message and the DN-AAA shall respond with an DEA message. Multi-
round authentication using the DEA (with Result-Code set to
DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH) and DER messages may be used. The DN-AAA server
finally authenticates and authorizes the user by replying with an DEA message
with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS.
The SMF+PGW-C may initiate Diameter re-authorization procedures for the
purpose of IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix allocation (or renew the lease). In
this case, the SMF+PGW-C shall set the Session-Id to the value used in the
initial request, the Auth-Request-Type AVP to \"AUTHORIZE_ONLY\" and the 3GPP-
Allocate-IP-Type AVP to the type of IP address to be allocated in the AA-
Request message sent to the AAA server. If the SMF+PGW-C is using DHCP
signalling towards the UE and the DN-AAA server includes the Session-Timeout
attribute in the Access-Accept, the SMF+PGW-C may use the Session-Timeout
value as the DHCP lease time. The SMF+PGW-C shall not set the DHCP lease time
value higher than the Session-Timeout value. The SMF+PGW-C may renew the DHCP
lease to the UE without re-authorization towards the DN-AAA server providing
that the new lease expiry is no later than the Session-Timeout timer expiry.
If the SMF+PGW-C wishes to extend the lease time beyond the current Session-
Timeout expiry, it shall initiate a new AAA re-authorization.
When the SMF+PGW-C receives a message indicating a QoS flow or PDN connection
release request, the SMF+PGW-C shall send a Diameter Accounting-Request (STOP)
message to the DN-AAA server, which indicates the termination of this
particular QoS flow or PDN connection. The SMF+PGW-C shall immediately send
the corresponding response to the MME, without waiting for an Accounting-
Response (STOP) message from the DN-AAA server.
The DN-AAA server shall deallocate the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix
initially allocated to the subscriber, if there is no session for the
subscriber.
Accounting-Request (ON) and Accounting-Request (OFF) messages may be sent from
the SMF+PGW-C to the DN-AAA server to ensure the correct synchronization of
the session information in the SMF+PGW-C and the DN-AAA server.
The SMF+PGW-C may send an Accounting-Request (ON) message to the DN-AAA server
to indicate that a restart has occurred. The DN-AAA server may then release
the associated resources.
Prior to a scheduled restart, the SMF+PGW-C may send Accounting-Request (OFF)
message to the DN-AAA server. The DN-AAA server may then release the
associated resources.
Figure 11.2.1a-1: RADIUS Authentication and Accounting example (successful
case)
The above figure 11.2.1a-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of
RADIUS Authentication and Accounting between an SMF+PGW-C and a DN-AAA server:
1\. UE initiates the PDN Connection Establishment procedure, including
authentication/authorization information.
2\. The MME sends Create Session Request including the
authentication/authorization information to the SMF+PGW-C.
According to the configuration in the SMF+PGW-C, step 6 to step 10 are
executed before step 3 if the SMF+PGW-C needs to send an EAP-Request message
to the UE.
3\. If the N4 session has not been established before, the SMF+PGW-C triggers
the N4 Session Establishment procedure to the UPF+PGW-U and sets the N4 rules
to block any UE traffic over the PDN Connection (until the Secondary DN
authentication and authorization has been completed successfully).
4\. The SMF+PGW-C sends the Diameter DER message to the DN-AAA via the
UPF+PGW-U in the N4 user plane.
5-11. The DN-AAA responds with the Diameter DEA message to the SMF+PGW-C via
the UPF+PGW-U in the N4 use plane message. The authentication/authorization
information is further transferred to UE via Create Session Response and
Downlink NAS Transport message, along with uplink data not allowed indication
within the PCO attribute. UE responds to the received
authentication/authorization data and such information is transferred in
Uplink NAS Transport message and Modify Bearer Request, then finally sent to
the DN-AAA by the SMF+PGW-C, via the UPF+PGW-U, in the DER message.
12-17. The DN-AAA responds with the DEA message to the SMF+PGW-C via the
UPF+PGW-U in the N4 use plane message. The authentication/authorization
information is further transferred to UE via Update bearer Response and
Downlink NAS Transport message. UE responds to the received
authentication/authorization data and such information is transferred in
Uplink NAS Transport message and Update Bearer Response, then finally sent to
the DN-AAA by the SMF+PGW-C, via the UPF+PGW-U, in the DER message.
NOTE: Step 12 to step 17 can be repeated depending on the
authentication/authorization mechanism used (e.g. EAP-TLS with Result-Code set
to DIAMETER_MULTI_ROUND_AUTH in DEA message).
18\. The SMF+PGW-C receives the final result of authentication/authorization
from the DN-AAA in the DEA with Result-Code set to DIAMETER_SUCCESS message,
via the UPF+PGW-U.
19\. The SMF+PGW-C updates the N4 rules to allow UE traffic over the PDN
connection.
20\. The SMF+PGW-C requests to start accounting by sending the Accounting-
Request (START) message to the DN-AAA via the UPF+PGW-U.
21\. The SMF+PGW-C proceeds with PDN connection establishment procedure and
includes the authentication/authorization information in the Update Bearer
Request message with uplink data allowed indication within the PCO attribute,
sent to the MME.
22\. The DN-AAA responds with the Accounting-Response (START) message. The
SMF+PGW-C may wait for the Accounting-Response (START) before sending the
Update Bearer Request in step 21.
23\. The MME sends the Downlink NAS Transport message with Session Management
Request with the authentication/authorization information to the UE.
24\. The UE sends a Uplink NAS Transport message with Session Management
Response to the MME.
25\. The MME sends Update Bearer Response to the SMF+PGW-C, after which user
data is allowed over the PDN connection.
26-30. At any point, if the UE triggers Detach procedure and send Detech
request to the MME then MME sends Delete Session Request message to the
SMF+PGW-C, which responds with Delete Session Response message. The SMF+PGW-C
requests to stop accounting by sending the Accounting-Request (STOP) message
to the DN-AAA via the UPF+PGW-U and the DN-AAA responds with the Accounting-
Response (STOP) message.
### 12.2.2 Accounting Update
During the life of a QoS flow some information related to this QoS flow may
change. The SMF may send an Accounting Request (Interim) to the DN-AAA server
upon occurrence of a chargeable event, e.g. RAT change, DNAI change or QoS
change. Interim updates are also used when the IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix
is allocated/released/re-allocated.
NOTE: DNAI change is only applicable when application relocation possible
indicated in the AF traffic influenced PCC rule as described in clause 5.6.7
of TS 23.501 [2], align with the DNAI change in UP path management events as
described in clause 4.3.6.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. Only the target DNAI is provided
in the ACR message. The change from the UP path status where a DNAI applies to
a status where no DNAI applies indicating the de-activation of the AF request
for AF influence on traffic routing is not supported in this release.
When the SMF receives a signalling request (i.e.
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext) that indicates the occurrence of one of these
chargeable events, the SMF may send an Accounting Request Interim-Update to
the DN-AAA server to update the necessary information related to this QoS
flow. It is not necessary for the SMF to wait for the Diameter Accounting
Answer message from the DN-AAA server before sending the response for the
triggering signalling message (i.e. Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer).
The SMF may delete the QoS flow if the Accounting Answer is not received from
the DN-AAA server.
The SMF may also send interim updates at the expiry of an operator configured
time limit.
Figure 12.2.2-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of Diameter
accounting update, messages between the SMF and DN-AAA are forwarded by the
UPF in N4 user plane message.
Figure 12.2.2-1: Diameter accounting update
For the 5GC and EPC interworking scenario without authentication,
authorization, re-authentication and/or re-authorization impacts, if the UE
establishes the PDU session through the 5GC and initiates the accounting
session, when the SMF+PGW-C determines that the UE has moved to the EPS (i.e.
the SMF+PGW-C receives the modify bearer request or create session request
from the S-GW), the SMF+PGW-C may perform the accounting session update with
the following modifications:
\- for the case that the accounting session is initiated per PDU session, the
SMF+PGW-C may update the accounting session by including the identifier of the
accounting session within the Session-Id AVP, the \"EUTRA\" within the 3GPP-
RAT-Type AVP, the IPv4 address of S-GW within the 3GPP-SGSN-Address AVP or
IPv6 address of S-GW within the 3GPP-SGSN-IPv6-Address AVP, the default EPS
bearer id within the 3GPP-NSAPI AVP, the user location in the EPC within the
3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP if available and the new QoS profile within the
3GPP-GPRS-Negotiated-QoS-Profile AVP if changed.
\- for the case that the accounting session is initiated per QoS flow:
\- if the SMF+PGW-C mapped a QoS flow to an EPS bearer, the SMF may update the
accounting session corresponding to the QoS flow with the information of the
EPS bearer by including the identifier of the accounting session within the
Session-Id AVP, the \"EUTRA\" within the 3GPP-RAT-Type AVP, the IPv4 address
of S-GW within the 3GPP-SGSN-Address AVP or IPv6 address of S-GW within the
3GPP-SGSN-IPv6-Address AVP, the default EPS bearer id within the 3GPP-NSAPI
AVP, the user location in the EPC within the 3GPP-User-Location-Info AVP if
available and the new QoS profile within the 3GPP-GPRS-Negotiated-QoS-Profile
AVP if changed, the new charging id within the 3GPP-Charging-Id AVP or 3GPP-
Charging-Id-v2 AVP according to the length of the Charging Id if allocated and
the new packet filters within the 3GPP-Packet-Filter AVP if changed;
\- if the SMF+PGW-C mapped multiple QoS flows to one EPS bearer, the SMF shall
select one of the accounting sessions corresponding to these QoS flows to
update it as above and terminate the accounting session(s) corresponding to
the other QoS flow(s).
\- if the SMF+PGW-C did not map a QoS flow to any EPS bearer, the SMF may
decide to associate the corresponding account session to the default EPS
bearer or terminate the corresponding accounting session.
### 12.2.3 DN-AAA initiated QoS flow termination
Diameter is used as the protocol between the SMF and the DN-AAA server or
proxy for applications (e.g. MMS) to deliver information related to user
session. However some IP applications could need to interwork with the SMF to
release the corresponding resource (e.g. terminate a particular QoS flow). For
this purpose, the DN-AAA server or proxy may send a Diameter ASR along with
the QoS flow Identifier in 3GPP-NSAPI, if available, to identify the
particular QoS flow to be terminated to the SMF. The SMF should react by
deleting the corresponding QoS flow and reply with ASA. If the SMF deletes the
corresponding QoS flow, it is not necessary for the SMF to wait for the
response (i.e. Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext) from the AMF before sending
the ASA to the DN-AAA server.
The absence of the QoS flow Identifier in the Diameter ASR message indicates
to the SMF that all QoS flows for this particular user and sharing the same
user session shall be deleted. The QoS flows belonging to the same PDU session
are identified by the Diameter Session-Id. If a user has the same user IP
address for different sets of QoS flows towards different networks, only the
QoS flows linked to the one identified by the Diameter Session-Id shall be
deleted.
Figure 12.2.3-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of DN-AAA
initiated QoS flow termination, messages between the SMF and DN-AAA are
forwarded by the UPF in N4 user plane message.
Figure 12.2.3-1: DN-AAA initiated QoS flow termination with Diameter
For the 5GC and EPC interworking scenario, when the DN-AAA initiates the QoS
flow termination, the SMF+PGW-C shall send the delete bearer request to the
S-GW as defined in clause 5.4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [53] to delete the EPS
bearer corresponding to the if the UE has moved to the EPS.
### 12.2.4 DN-AAA initiated re-authorization in 5GC
Some IP applications could need to interwork with the SMF to update the PDU
session authorization attributes. For this purpose, the DN-AAA server or proxy
may send a Diameter RAR with Re-Auth-Request-Type value \"AUTHORIZE_ONLY\" to
the SMF. On receipt of the RAR from the DN-AAA server, the SMF shall update
the corresponding PDU session authorization attributes and reply with RAA. DN-
AAA may also use such procedure to revoke the authorization of a PDU session,
or to update the authorization data (e.g. allowed UE MAC addresses).
If the SMF updates/deletes the corresponding PDU session, it is not necessary
for the SMF to wait for Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext from the AMF before
sending the RAA to the DN-AAA server.
Figure 12.2.4-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of DN-AAA
initiated re-authorization, messages between the SMF and DN-AAA are forwarded
by the UPF in N4 user plane message.
Figure 12.2.4-1: DN-AAA initiated re-authorization with Diameter
NOTE: The DN-AAA initiated re-authorization procedure is not applicable for
legacy DN-AAA supporting the Diameter procedures over SGi interface as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.061 [5].
### 12.2.4a DN-AAA initiated re-authorization in EPC Interworking
Some IP applications could need to interwork with the SMF+PGW-C to update the
PDD connection authorization attributes. For this purpose, the DN-AAA server
or proxy may send a Diameter RAR with Re-Auth-Request-Type value
\"AUTHORIZE_ONLY\" to the SMF+PGW-C. On receipt of the RAR from the DN-AAA
server, the SMF+PGW-C shall update the corresponding PDN connection
authorization attributes and reply with RAA. DN-AAA may also use such
procedure to revoke the authorization of a PDN connection, or to update the
authorization data (e.g. allowed UE MAC addresses).
If the SMF+PGW-C updates/deletes the corresponding PDN connection, it is not
necessary for the SMF+PGW-C to wait for Update Bearer Response from the MME
before sending the RAA to the DN-AAA server.
Figure 12.2.4-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of DN-AAA
initiated re-authorization, messages between the SMF+PGW-C and DN-AAA are
forwarded by the UPF+PGW-U in N4 user plane message.
Figure 12.2.4a-1: DN-AAA initiated re-authorization with Diameter
NOTE: The DN-AAA initiated re-authorization procedure is not applicable for
legacy DN-AAA supporting the Diameter procedures over SGi interface as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.061 [5].
### 12.2.5 DN-AAA initiated re-authentication and re-authorization in 5GC
Some IP applications could need to interwork with the SMF to request re-
authentication and re-authorization for the PDU session. For this purpose, the
DN-AAA server or proxy may send a Diameter RAR with Re-Auth-Request-Type value
\"AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE\" to the SMF. The RAR should not include any
authorization attribute.
NOTE: Since the SMF will initiate authentication procedure upon receipt of the
RAR and in the end the DN-AAA will authorize the session, the DN-AAA does not
have to apply authorization change immediately.
On receipt of the RAR from the DN-AAA server, the SMF shall reply with RAA and
start authentication and authorization procedure as described in figure
12.2.1-1, from step 4 to step 11, step 13 and with PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION
RESULT message (successful case) sent from the AMF to the UE. The Auth-
Request-Type in the DER is set to \"AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE\".
Figure 12.2.5-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of DN-AAA
initiated re-authentication and re-authorization, messages between the SMF and
DN-AAA are forwarded by the UPF in N4 user plane message.
Based on the result from the SMF, the DN-AAA server may decide to keep the PDU
session or request to release the PDU session.
NOTE: As an implementation option, when the UE becomes unreachable, the SMF
can mark the re-authentication result as pending and initiate re-
authentication at the next uplink activity.
When the SMF receives a re-authentication request from the DN-AAA server, the
SMF shall inform the DN-AAA server that the re-authentication is not possible
with error code 3002 and optionaly the \"NR\" within the 3GPP-RAT-Type to
indicated the UE is in 5GS not reachable for re-authentication. The SMF should
not initiate PDU session release.
Figure 12.2.5-1: DN-AAA initiated re-authentication and re-authorization with
Diameter
When PAP/CHAP is used as the authentication protocol with the external DN-AAA
server which does not support EAP, the Diameter DN-AAA initiated re-
authentication and re-authorization procedures are not applicable.
### 12.2.5a DN-AAA initiated re-authentication and re-authorization in EPC
Interworking
Some IP applications could need to interwork with the SMF+PGW-C to request re-
authentication and re-authorization for the PDN connection. For this purpose,
the DN-AAA server or proxy may send a Diameter RAR with Re-Auth-Request-Type
value \"AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE\" to the SMF+PGW-C. The RAR should not include
any authorization attribute.
NOTE: Since the SMF+PGW-C will initiate authentication procedure upon receipt
of the RAR and in the end the DN-AAA will authorize the session, the DN-AAA
does not have to apply authorization change immediately.
On receipt of the RAR from the DN-AAA server, the SMF shall reply with RAA and
start authentication and authorization procedure as described in figure
12.2.1a-1, from step 11 to step 18. The Auth-Request-Type in the DER is set to
\"AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE\".
Figure 12.2.5-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of DN-AAA
initiated re-authentication and re-authorization, messages between the
SMF+PGW-C and DN-AAA are forwarded by the UPF+PGW-U in N4 user plane message.
When the SMF+PGW-C receives a re-authentication request from the DN-AAA
server, the SMF+PGW-C shall inform the DN-AAA server that the re-
authentication is not supported with error code 3002 and optionaly the
\"EUTRA\" within the 3GPP-RAT-Type to indicated the UE is in EPS not available
for re-authentication. The SMF+PGW-C should not initiate PDN connection
release. Based on the result from the SMF+PGW-C, the DN-AAA server may decide
to keep the PDN connection or request to release the PDN connection.
NOTE: As an implementation option, when the UE becomes unreachable, the
SMF+PGW-C can mark the re-authentication result as pending and initiate re-
authentication at the next uplink activity.
Figure 12.2.5a-1: DN-AAA initiated re-authentication and re-authorization with
Diameter
When PAP/CHAP is used as the authentication protocol with the external DN-AAA
server which does not support EAP, the Diameter DN-AAA initiated re-
authentication and re-authorization procedures are not applicable.

NOTE 1: Attribute 3GPP-CAMEL-Charging-Info (24) is not applicable for 5G in
the present specification.

and the VSAs defined in clause 16.4.7 of 3GPP TS 29.061 [5].
### 12.4.1 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the N6 reference point
The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the
destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host
supports. The client shall, in the first request in a Diameter session
indicate the set of supported features. The server shall, in the first answer
within the Diameter session indicate the set of features that it has in common
with the client and that the server shall support within the same Diameter
session. Any further command messages shall always be compliant with the list
of supported features indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session
establishment. Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used
to construct the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise
stated, the use of the Supported-Features AVP on the N6 reference point shall
be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported features
and associated error handling on the Cx reference point as defined in clause
7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [41].
The base functionality for the N6 reference point is the 3GPP Rel-15 standard
and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does
not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features
AVP may be absent from the N6 commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS
29.229 [41], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature,
the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined
mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [41], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the N6 reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the N6 reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [41].
Once the SMF and DN-AAA have negotiated the set of supported features during
session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the
lifetime of the Diameter session.
The table below defines the features applicable to the N6 interfaces for the
feature lists with a Feature-List-ID of 1.
Table 12.4.1-1: Features of Feature-List-ID 1 used in N6
+----------------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+ | Feature bit | Feature | M/O | Description | +----------------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+ | 0 | eSessionAMBR | M | This feature | | | | | indicates the | | | | | support of enhanced | | | | | Session AMBR | | | | | function. If | | | | | supported, the | | | | | DN-AAA authorizes DL | | | | | and/or UL Session | | | | | AMBR separately. | +----------------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+ | Feature bit: The | | | | | order number of the | | | | | bit within the | | | | | Feature-List AVP | | | | | where the least | | | | | significant bit is | | | | | assigned number | | | | | \"0\". | | | | | | | | | | Feature: A short | | | | | name that can be | | | | | used to refer to the | | | | | bit and to the | | | | | feature, e.g. | | | | | \"5GC\". | | | | | | | | | | M/O: Defines if the | | | | | implementation of | | | | | the feature is | | | | | mandatory (\"M\") or | | | | | optional (\"O\") in | | | | | this 3GPP Release. | | | | | | | | | | Description: A clear | | | | | textual description | | | | | of the feature. | | | | +----------------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+
## 12.5 N6 specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP
Diameter Base IETF RFC 6733 [24] defines a number of Result-Code AVP values
that are used to report protocol errors and how those are used. Those
procedures and values apply for the present specification.
Due to the N6 specific AVPs, new application results can occur and the
Experimental-Result AVP is used to transfer the 3GPP-specific result codes.
The Experimental-Result AVP is a grouped AVP containing the Vendor-Id AVP set
to the value of 3GPP\'s vendor identifier (10415) and an Experimental-Result-
Code AVP.
The following N6 specific Experimental-Result-Code value is defined:
DIAMETER_QOS_FLOW_DELETION_INDICATION (2421)
For SMF this is an indication to the server that the requested 5G QoS flow or
PDU session has been deleted.
## 12.6 N6 Diameter messages
### 12.6.1 General
This clause describes the N6 Diameter messages.
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the N6 interface are detailed in this
clause. Other Diameter AVPs as defined in IETF RFC 4072 [25] and IETF RFC 7155
[23], even if their AVP flag rules are marked with \"M\", are not required for
being compliant with the current specification.
Diameter messages as defined in clause 16a.4 of 3GPP TS 29.061 [5] are re-used
in 5G with the following differences:
\- SMF or SMF+PGW-C replaces P-GW, and GGSN related description are not
applicable for 5G.
\- 5G QoS flow replaces IP-CAN/EPS bearer and PDU session replaces IP-CAN
session.
\- N6 replaces Gi/Sgi.
NOTE: N6 re-used and specific AVPs are specified in clause 12.3 and clause
12.4.
\- 3GPP-NAI AVP may be included in the AAR and ACR command.
\- 3GPP-NID AVP may be included together with 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP in the AAR
and ACR command.
\- 3GPP-Session-S-NSSAI AVP and/or 3GPP-Session-Id AVP may be included in the
AAR and ACR command.
\- 3GPP-DNAI AVP, 3GPP-RSN AVP and/or 3GPP-Session-Pair-Id AVP may be included
in the ACR command.
\- Multiple 3GPP-IP-Address-Pool-Info AVPs may be included in the AAR command
and one or two 3GPP-IP-Address-Pool-Info AVPs may be included in the AAA and
ACR command.
\- Multiple 3GPP-UE-MAC-Address AVPs may be included in the AAR and ACR
command.
\- For indicating user location, TWAN-Identifier AVP, 3GPP-TNAP-Identifier
AVP, 3GPP-HFC-NodeId AVP, 3GPP-GLI AVP, 3GPP-Line-Type AVP, 3GPP-UE-Local-IP-
Address and optionally UDP or TCP source port number (if NAT is detected) may
be included in the AAR and ACR command.
\- Acct-Application-Id AVP shall be included in the ACR and ACA command as
specified in IETF RFC 7155 [23].
\- Additional Diameter messages needed for 5G compared to the **3GPP TS 29.061
[5]** are described in the following clauses.
\- Multiple Supported-Features AVPs may be included in the ACR and ACA
command.
### 12.6.2 DER Command
The DER command, defined in IETF RFC 4072 [25], is indicated by the Command-
Code field set to 268 and the \'R\' bit set in the Command Flags field. It is
sent by the SMF to the DN-AAA server upon reception of an initial access
request (e.g. Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext) message for a given DNN to
request user authentication and authorization.
The relevant AVPs that are of use for the N6 interface are detailed in the
ABNF description below. Other valid AVPs for this command are not used for N6
purposes and should be ignored by the receiver or processed according to the
relevant specifications.
The bold marked AVPs in the message format indicate new optional AVPs for N6,
or modified existing AVPs.

# 13 Interworking with IMS
## 13.1 General
Interworking with the IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS) puts specific
requirements on the SMF.
The SMF shall use the following mechanisms to support the interworking with
the IMS:
\- the P-CSCF discovery;
\- N7 interface for the policy and charging control of QoS flows for IMS media
flows; and
\- the P-CSCF restoration.
These mechanisms are however not restricted only to the interworking with the
IMS and may be used for other services that could benefit from these
mechanisms.
If the PDU Session is used for IMS (identified by DNN), the SMF/UPF shall not
modify the fields Type of Service (IPv4) and Traffic Class (IPv6) of the
received downlink packets..
NOTE: The P-CSCF can support paging policy differentiation for different
traffic or service types over NG-RAN by marking the fields Type of Service
(IPv4) and Traffic Class (IPv6) (see clause L.3.2.4 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [13]).
## 13.2 IMS interworking Model
### 13.2.1 Introduction
The signalling interface between the UE and the P-CSCF is a logical interface,
i.e. it uses 5GC as a QoS flow. The Npcf_SMPolicyControl services, offered via
N7 interface, are used for network communication between the SMF and the PCF.
For a description of the IMS architecture, refer to 3GPP TS 23.228 [12].
### 13.2.2 IMS specific configuration in the SMF
The SMF shall have a list of preconfigured addresses of signalling servers
(the P-CSCF servers). This list shall be provided to the UE at PDU session
establishment. It shall be possible to preconfigure the list of preconfigured
addresses of signalling servers per DNN.
The SMF/UPF may have the locally preconfigured packet filters, and/or the
applicable PCC rules, to be applied on the QoS flow. The packet filters shall
filter up-link and down-link packets, and shall only allow traffic to/from the
signalling servers and to the DNS and the DHCP servers. It shall be possible
to locally preconfigure the packet filters per DNN.
It shall be possible to enable/disable the use of the services offered via N7
interface per DNN.
The SMF shall support IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses and protocol for IMS
signalling and IMS QoS flows.
The methods for the UE to discover the P-CSCF address(es) may vary depending
on the access technology that the UE is on. The details of the P-CSCF
discovery mechanisms for various accesses are specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [12]
and 3GPP TS 24.229 [13]. The P-CSCF discovery mechanisms are:
\- a 5GC procedure for the P-CSCF discovery;
\- via DHCP servers i.e. the SMF shall provide the functionality of a DHCP
relay agent; and
\- if the UE has a P-CSCF FQDN locally configured and request the DNS IP
address(es) from the SMF (via 5GC mechanism or DHCP procedures), the SMF shall
be able to provide DNS IP address(es) to the UE.
The SMF shall have similar functional support depending on the P-CSCF
discovery methods supported by the UE on the access technology. For example,
for the UE in 3GPP 5G access network the SMF shall have DHCP server function
towards the UE while acting as a DHCP client towards external DHCP server, if
the SMF is configured to request DNS and/or P-CSCF IP addresses from the
external DHCP servers.
The SMF shall be able to deliver DNS and/or P-CSCF addresses to the UE if
requested by the UE via the 5G network or via DHCP procedures using the
relevant DHCP options for IPv4/IPv6 DNS and SIP servers (see IETF RFC 2132
[14], IETF RFC 3361 [15], IETF RFC 3646 [16] and IETF RFC 3319 [17]).
On DNNs providing IMS services, the information advertised in Router
Advertisements from the SMF to the UEs shall be configured in the same manner
as for other DNNs providing IPv6 services except that the \"Oâ€‘flag\" shall be
set.
The \"O-flag\" shall be set in IPv6 Router Advertisement messages sent by the
SMF for DNNs used for IMS services. This will trigger a DHCP capable UE to
start a DHCPv6 session to retrieve server addresses and other configuration
parameters. The UE which doesn\'t support DHCP shall ignore the \"O-flag\" and
shall request the IMS specific configuration (e.g. the P-CSCF address) via
other discovery methods supported in the UE (i.e. via locally configured
P-CSCF address/FQDN in the UE or via 5G procedure, if applicable).
The SMF shall have configurable policy rules for controlling QoS flows used
for signalling.
### 13.2.3 IMS specific procedures in the SMF
#### 13.2.3.1 Provisioning of Signalling Server Address
At a PDU Session establishment procedure related to the IMS, the SMF shall
support the capability to send the P-CSCF address(es) to the UE. The P-CSCF
address information is sent by the visited SMF if LBO is used. For Home
routed, the P-CSCF address information is sent by the SMF in the HPLMN. The
P-CSCF address(es) shall be sent transparently through the AMF, and in case of
Home Routed also through the SMF in the VPLMN.
NOTE 1: The SMF is located in the VPLMN if LBO is used.
NOTE 2: Other options to provide the P-CSCF address(es) to the UE as defined
in 3GPP TS 23.228 [12] is not excluded.
NOTE 3: A PDU session for IMS is identified by \"APN\" or \"DNN\".
#### 13.2.3.2 Failure of Signalling Server Address
If the SMF detects a failure:
\- upon receiving the N4 session report from the UPF for the monitored P-CSCF
address being used by the UE (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.380 [38], clause
5.8.3); or
\- upon receiving a P-CSCF restoration indication from the UDM or the PCF,
then the SMF shall act as specified in 3GPP TS 23.380 [38], clause 5.8.
# 14 Interworking with DN (Ethernet)
When support of Ethernet PDU type data is provided at the N6 interface, the
SMF and UPF may support ARP proxying as specified in IETF RFC 1027 [35] and/or
IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation Proxying as specified in IETF RFC 4861 [33]
functionality. Based on operator configuration, during the PDU session
establishment, the SMF may request the UPF acting as the PDU Session Anchor to
proxy ARP/IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation or to forward the ARP/IPv6 Neighbour
Solicitation traffic from the UPF to the SMF.
Ethernet Preamble, Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) and Frame Check Sequence (FCS)
are not sent over 5GS:
\- For UL traffic the UE strips the Preamble, SFD and FCS from the Ethernet
frame, those fields shall be added by the UPF acting as the PDU Session
Anchor.
\- For DL traffic the UPF acting as the PDU Session Anchor shall strip the
Preamble, SFD and FCS from the Ethernet frame.
IP address is not allocated by the SMF to the UE for this PDU Session. The UPF
shall store the MAC addresses, received from the UE, and associate those with
the appropriate PDU Session.
NOTE 1: The UE can operate in bridge mode with regard to a LAN it is
connecting to the 5GS, thus different MAC addresses can be used as source
address of different frames sent UL over a single PDU Session (and destination
MAC address of different frames sent DL over the same PDU Session)
NOTE 2: Entities on the LAN connected to the 5GS by the UE can have an IP
address allocated by the external DN, but the IP layer is considered as an
application layer which is not part of the Ethernet PDU Session.
NOTE 3: In this Release of the specification, only the UE connected to the 5GS
is authenticated, not the devices behind such UE.
When a PDU Session of Ethernet PDU type is authorized by a DN, the DN-AAA
server may, as part of authorization data, provide the SMF with a list of
allowed MAC addresses (maximum 16) for this PDU Session. When such a list has
been provided for a PDU Session, the SMF sets corresponding filtering rules in
the UPF(s) acting as PDU Session Anchor for the PDU Session and the UPF
discards any UL traffic that does not contain any of these MAC addresses as a
source address.
Figure 14-1: Protocol stacks for Ethernet PDU type data (user plane) for N6
reference point
# 15 Interworking with DN (Multicast Routing Protocol)
## 15.1 General
The 3GPP network support IPTV multicast packets transmission over PDU Session
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.316 [43] clause 7.7.1. When support of multicast
routing protocol is provided at the N6 interface, different techniques may be
used.
## 15.2 DN interworking Model of UPF for PIM
If PIM (Protocol-Independent Multicast) is used as Multicast Routing Protocol,
including PIM-SM (Protocol-Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode, IETF RFC 7761
[44]) and PIM-DM (Protocol-Independent Multicast- Dense Mode, IETF RFC 3973
[45]), are commonly used to efficiently routing multicast groups that may span
wide-area (and inter-domain) internets.
UPF acts as the PIM router which is clostest to UE and receive multicast
packets originated from multicast source via perform PIM function. Based on
local policy, UPF support either PIM-SM or PIM-DM or both.
UPF shall acts as PIM router used for interworking with the IP network as
illustrated in figure 15.2-1.
Figure 15.2-1: The protocol stacks for the N6 reference point for PIM
PIM function in UPF shall interacts with PIM routers in IP network.
\- In case of PIM-SM, PIM router in UPF acts as DR (Designated Router) which
is clostest to UE and send register message to RP (Rendezvous Point). It
receive multicast packets over shared tree from RP. Refer to IETF RFC 7761
[44] for more details.
\- In case of PIM-DM, PIM router in UPF sends Upstream Prune Messages to
indicate that designated multicast traffic is not desired, It sends Upstream
Graft message to re-join a previously pruned branch to the delivery tree.
Refer to IETF RFC 3973 [45] for more details.
# 16 Interworking with NSS-AAA (RADIUS)
## 16.1 RADIUS procedures
### 16.1.1 General
The Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure is
triggered for a network slice requiring Network Slice Specific Authentication
and Authorization with an NSS-AAA server which may be hosted by the H-PLMN
operator or by a third party which has a business relationship with the
H-PLMN. An AAA Proxy (AAA-P) in the HPLMN may be involved e.g. if the NSS-AAA
Server belongs to a third party.
### 16.1.2 RADIUS Authentication and Authorization
RADIUS Authentication and Authorization shall be used according to IETF RFC
2865 [8], IETF RFC 3162 [9] and IETF RFC 4818 [10]. In 5G, multiple
authentication methods using Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) may be
used such as EAP-TLS (see IETF RFC 5216 [11]), EAP-TTLS (see IETF RFC 5281
[37]). The NSSAAF or AAA-P shall implement the RADIUS extension to support EAP
as specified in IETF RFC 3579 [7].
The RADIUS client function may reside in an NSSAAF. When the NSSAAF receives
Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate request from AMF, the RADIUS client function shall
send the authentication information with network slice information to a NSS-
AAA server directly or via an AAA-P.
The NSS-AAA server performs authentication and authorization for the user and
requested network slice information. When the NSSAAF receives an Access-Accept
message from the NSS-AAA server or AAA-P, it shall complete the network slice
specific authentication procedure. If Access-Reject or no response is
received, the NSSAAF shall reject the network slice specific authentication
procedure with a suitable cause code.
The NSS-AAA may revoke the authorization for the network slice, see details in
clause 16.2.2. In the present release, the NSS-AAA initiated re-authentication
is not supported.
## 16.2 Message flows for network slice specific authentication
### 16.2.1 Authentication and Authorization procedures
When the NSSAAF receives Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate request from AMF, it shall
send a RADIUS Access-Request message with EAP extension to an NSS-AAA server
directly or via an AAA-P if AAA-P is involved. The Access-Request message
shall include GPSI in Calling-Station-Id or External-Identifier attribute and
network slice information in 3GPP-S-NSSAI attribute. Upon receipt of the
Access-Request message, the NSS-AAA server shall respond with an Access-
Challenge message. Multi-round authentication using the Access-Challenge (sent
by NSS-AAA) and Access-Request messages may be used. The NSS-AAA server
finally authenticates and authorizes the user and the network slice by
replying with an Access Accept message.
For re-authentication and re-authorization, the NSSAAF shall send a RADIUS
Access-Request message with EAP extension to the NSS-AAA server directly or
via the AAA-P if AAA-P is used and the NSS-AAA shall respond with an Access-
Challenge message. Multi-round authentication using the Access-Challenge (sent
by NSS-AAA) and Access-Request messages may be used. The NSS-AAA server
finally authenticates and authorizes the user and the network slice by
replying with an Access Accept message.
The following figure 16.2.1-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure
of RADIUS Authentication and Authorization between an AMF and a NSS-AAA
server:
1\. AMF decides to trigger the start of the Network Slice Specific
Authentication and Authorization procedure.
2\. The AMF may send an EAP Identity Request in a NAS Network Slice-Specific
Authentication Command message.
3\. The UE provides the EAP Identity Response in a NAS Network Slice-Specific
Authentication Complete message towards the AMF.
4\. The AMF sends Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate Request to the NSSAAF including
the authentication/authorization information.
5-6. If the AAA-P is present (e.g. because the NSS-AAA belongs to a third
party and the operator deploys a proxy towards third parties), the NSSAAF
sends the Access-Request message to the NSS-AAA via the AAA-P to forward the
authentication/authorization information, otherwise the NSSAAF sends the
Access-Request message directly to the NSS-AAA.
7-14. The NSS-AAA responds with the Access-Challenge message to the NSSAAF
directly or via the AAA-P. The authentication/authorization information is
further transferred to UE via AMF by Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate service and
NAS Network Slice-Specific Authentication Command message. UE responds to the
received authentication/authorization data and such information is transferred
in NAS Network Slice-Specific Authentication Complete message and
Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate service, then finally sent to the NSS-AAA by the
NSSAAF, via the AAA-P if the AAA-P is used, in the Access-Request message.
NOTE: Step 7 to step 14 can be repeated depending on the
authentication/authorization mechanism used (e.g. EAP-TLS).
15-16. If the AAA-P is used, the NSS-AAA sends a Access-Accept message with
the final result of authentication/authorization to the NSSAAF via the AAA-P,
otherwise the NSS-AAA sends the Access-Accept message directly to the NSSAAF.
17\. The NSSAAF sends a Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate Response with the final
result of authentication/authorization information to the AMF.
18\. The AMF transfers the final result of authentication/authorization
information in a NAS Network Slice-Specific Authentication Result message to
the UE.
Figure 16.2.1-1: Network slice specific authentication and Authorization
procedure (RADIUS)
### 16.2.2 NSS-AAA initiated revocation of network slice authorization
The NSS-AAA server may send a RADIUS Disconnect-Request to the NSSAAF directly
or via AAA-P (if AAA-P is used) asking for revocation of network slice
authorization. On receipt of the Disconnect-Request from the NSS-AAA server,
the NSSAAF shall check whether the NSS-AAA server is authorized to request the
revocation by verifying the local configuration of the address of the NSS-AAA
server per S-NSSAI, if successful, the NSSAAF shall release the resources,
interact with its succeeding Network Function AMF which is got from the UDM by
Nudm_UECM_GET service operation with GPSI and reply with a Disconnect-ACK. If
the NSSAAF is unable to release the corresponding resources, it shall reply to
the NSS-AAA server with a Disconnect-NAK. For more information on RADIUS
Disconnect, see IETF RFC 5176 [27]. It is not necessary for the NSSAAF to wait
for the response (i.e. Nudm_UECM_GET or Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Notify response) from
the succeeding Network Function before sending the RADIUS Disconnect-ACK to
the NSS-AAA server or AAA-P (if AAA-P is used).
> Editor\'s Note: It is FFS whether the RADIUS is applicable.
Figure 16.2.2-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of NSS-AAA
initiated revocation of network slice authorization. If the AAA-P is not used,
the Disconnect Request and Response messages are exchanged between the NSS-AAA
and the NSSAAF.

# 17 Interworking with NSS-AAA (Diameter)
## 17.1 Diameter procedures
### 17.1.1 General
The Network Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure is
triggered for a network slice requiring Network Slice Specific Authentication
and Authorization with an NSS-AAA server which may be hosted by the H-PLMN
operator or a third party which has a business relationship with the H-PLMN.
An AAA Proxy (AAA-P) in the HPLMN may be involved e.g. if the NSS-AAA Server
belongs to a third party.
### 17.1.2 Diameter Authentication and Authorization
Diameter Authentication and Authorization shall be used according to IETF RFC
7155 [23]. In 5G, multiple authentication methods using Extensible
Authentication Protocol (EAP) may be used such as EAP-TLS (see IETF RFC 5216
[11]), EAP-TTLS (see IETF RFC 5281 [37]). The NSSAAF or AAA-P shall support
Diameter EAP application as specified in IETF RFC 4072 [25].
The NSSAAF or AAA-P and the NSS-AAA shall advertise the support of the
Diameter NASREQ and EAP applications by including the value (1 and 5) of the
application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP (as specified in IETF
RFC 4072 [25]) and the value of the 3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the
Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [24], i.e. as part of the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVP.
The Diameter client function may reside in an NSSAAF. When the NSSAAF receives
Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate request from AMF, the Diameter client function
shall send the authentication information with network slice information to a
NSS-AAA server directly or via an AAA-P (if AAA-P is used).
The NSS-AAA server performs authentication and authorization for the requested
network slice information. When the Nnssaaf receives a positive response from
the NSS-AAA server or AAA-P (if AAA-P is used), it shall complete the network
slice specific authentication procedure. If negative response or no response
is received, the NSSAAF shall reject the network slice specific authentication
procedure with a suitable cause code.
The NSS-AAA may revoke the authorization for the network slice, see details in
clause 17.2.2. NSS-AAA may initiate re-authentication and re-authorization,
see details in clause 17.2.3.
## 17.2 Message flows for network slice specific authentication
### 17.2.1 Authentication and Authorization procedures
For network slice specific authentication and authorization, when the NSSAAF
receives Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate request from AMF, it shall send a Diameter
DER message with GPSI in Calling-Station-Id or External-Identifier attribute
and network slice information in 3GPP-S-NSSAI attribute to a NSS-AAA server
directly or via AAA-P if AAA-P is involved. Upon receipt of the DER message,
the DN-AAA server shall respond with an DEA message. Multi-round
authentication using the DEA and DER messages may be used. The NSS-AAA server
finally authenticates and authorizes the user and the network slice by
replying with a Diameter DEA message.
For re-authentication and re-authorization, the NSSAAF shall send a DER
message to the NSS-AAA server directly or via AAA-P if AAA-P is used and the
NSS-AAA server shall respond with a DEA message. Multi-round authentication
using the DEA and DER messages may be used. The NSS-AAA server finally
authenticates and authorizes the user and the network slice by replying with a
Diameter DEA message.
If the network slice specific authentication is not required, the NSSAAF shall
send a Diameter STR message to the NSS-AAA server directly or via AAA-P if
AAA-P is involved. The NSS-AAA server shall reply with a Diameter STA
message.The following figure 17.2.1-1 is an example message flow to show the
procedure of Diameter Authentication and Authorization between an AMF and a
NSS-AAA server:
1\. AMF decides to trigger the start of the Network Slice Specific
Authentication and Authorization procedure.
2\. The AMF may send an EAP Identity Request in a NAS Network Slice-Specific
Authentication Command message.
3\. The UE provides the EAP Identity Response in a NAS Network Slice-Specific
Authentication Complete message towards the AMF.
4\. The AMF sends Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate Request to the NSSAAF including
the authentication/authorization information.
5-6. If the AAA-P is present (e.g. because the NSS-AAA belongs to a third
party and the operator deploys a proxy towards third parties), the NSSAAF
sends the DER message to the NSS-AAA via the AAA-P to forward the
authentication/authorization information, otherwise the NSSAAF sends the DER
message directly to the NSS-AAA.
7-14. The NSS-AAA responds with the DEA message to the NSSAAF directly or via
the AAA-P. The authentication/authorization information is further transferred
to UE via AMF by Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate service and NAS MM Transport
message. UE responds to the received authentication/authorization data and
such information is transferred in NAS Network Slice-Specific Authentication
Complete message and Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate service, then finally sent to
the NSS-AAA by the NSSAAF, via the AAA-P if the AAA-P is used, in the DER
message.
NOTE: Step 7 to step 14 can be repeated depending on the
authentication/authorization mechanism used (e.g. EAP-TLS).
15-16. If the AAA-P is used, the NSS-AAA sends a DEA message with the final
result of authentication/authorization to the NSSAAF via the AAA-P, otherwise
the NSS-AAA sends the DEA message directly to the NSSAAF.
17\. The NSSAAF sends a Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Authenticate Response with the final
result of authentication/authorization information to the AMF.
18\. The AMF transfers the final result of authentication/authorization
information in a NAS Network Slice-Specific Authentication Result message to
the UE.
Figure 17.2.1-1: Network slice specific authentication and Authorization
procedure (Diameter)
### 17.2.2 NSS-AAA initiated revocation of network slice authorization
The NSS-AAA server may send a Diameter ASR message to the NSSAAF directly or
via AAA-P (if AAA-P is used) asking for revocation of network slice
authorization. On receipt of the ASR message from the NSS-AAA server, the
NSSAAF shall check whether the NSS-AAA server is authorized to request the
revocation by verifying the local configuration of the address of the NSS-AAA
server per S-NSSAI, if successful, the NSSAAF shall release the corresponding
resources, interact with its succeeding Network Function AMF which is got from
the UDM by Nudm_UECM_GET service operation with GPSI and reply with a Diameter
ASA message. It is not necessary for the NSSAAF to wait for the response (i.e.
Nudm_UECM_GET or Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Notify response) from its succeeding Network
Function before sending the ASA message to the NSS-AAA server or AAA-P.
NOTE: In the Diameter ASR request, the Origin-Host AVP with the FQDN/domain
format indicates the address of the NSS-AAA server for NSSAAF check.
Figure 17.2.2-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of NSS-AAA
initiated revocation of network slice authorization. If the AAA-P is not used,
the ASR and ASA messages are exchanged between the NSS-AAA and the NSSAAF.

with Diameter
### 17.2.3 NSS-AAA initiated re-authentication and re-authorization
The NSS-AAA server may send a Diameter RAR message to the NSSAAF directly or
via AAA-P (if AAA-P is used) asking for re-authentication and re-
authorization. On receipt of the RAR message from the NSS-AAA server, the
NSSAAF shall check whether the NSS-AAA server is authorized to request the re-
authentication and re-authorization by verifying the local configuration of
the address of the NSS-AAA server per S-NSSAI, if successful, the NSSAAF shall
interact with its succeeding Network Function AMF which is got from the UDM by
Nudm_UECM_GET service operation with GPSI and reply with a Diameter RAA
message. It is not necessary for the NSSAAF to wait for the response (i.e.
Nudm_UECM_GET or Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Notify response) from its succeeding Network
Function before sending the RAA message to the NSS-AAA server or AAA-P.
NOTE: In the Diameter RAR request, the Origin-Host AVP with the FQDN/domain
format indicates the address of the NSS-AAA server for NSSAAF check.
After replying Nnssaaf_NSSAA_Notify response, the AMF shall start
authentication and authorization procedure as described in clause 17.2.1. The
Auth-Request-Type in the DER is set to \"AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE\".
Figure 17.2.3-1 is an example message flow to show the procedure of NSS-AAA
initiated re-authentication and re-authorization. If the AAA-P is not used,
the RAR and RAA messages are exchanged between the NSS-AAA and the NSSAAF.

### 17.4.1 General
Information defined in clause 12.4.0 are re-used for network slice specific
authentication with the following differences:
\- NSSAAF replaces SMF.
\- IP, Ethernet and PDU session related descriptions and AVPs are not
applicable.
\- Additional detailed information needed for network slice specific
authentication are described below.

### 17.4.2 Use of the Supported-Features AVP
The Supported-Features AVP is used during the network slice specific
authentication procedure to inform the destination host about the required and
optional features that the origin host supports. The client shall, in the
first request in a Diameter session indicate the set of supported features.
The server shall, in the first answer within the Diameter session indicate the
set of features that it has in common with the client and that the server
shall support within the same Diameter session. Any further command messages
shall always be compliant with the list of supported features indicated in the
Supported-Features AVPs during session establishment. Features that are not
advertised as supported shall not be used to construct the command messages
for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise stated, the use of the Supported-
Features AVP shall be compliant with the requirements for dynamic discovery of
supported features and associated error handling on the Cx reference point as
defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [41].
The base functionality is the 3GPP Rel-16 standard and a feature is an
extension to that functionality. If the origin host does not support any
features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features AVP may be
absent in the DER command. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [41],
when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature, the new AVPs
shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined mandatory in the
command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [41], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. The
Supported-Features AVP is used to identify features that have been defined by
3GPP and hence, for features defined in this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall
contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415). If there are multiple feature lists
defined, the Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one
another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [41].
Once the NSSAAF or AAA-P and NSS-AAA have negotiated the set of supported
features during session establishment, the set of common features shall be
used during the lifetime of the Diameter session.
The table below defines the features applicable for the network slice specific

# 18 Interworking with DN (L2TP tunnel)
## 18.1 Support L2TP for CUPS across N6
L2TP (described in IETF RFC 2661 [57]) is a standard method for tunneling
encapsulated Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) frames over an IP network. L2TP
operates between two L2TP endpoints (LAC and LNS), and tunnels PPP-
encapsulated IP traffic between these endpoints. L2TP runs over UDP/IP and was
originally defined for systems where PPP is used by an end-device to connect
to a network (e.g. via DSL connections, or 2G/3G PPP PDP context). In these
cases, a LAC could be deployed in the network (e.g. in a BNG or GGSN/PGW) to
tunnel the PPP traffic to a server (LNS) over an IP network.
For 5GC with the UE using IP PDU Session, the PPP functionality that is
required to use L2TP is instead supported by the UPF or UPF+PGW-U, as
illustrated in below figure. Upon receiving a PDU Session/PDN Connection
establishment request from the UE via AMF or MME, SMF or SMF+PGW-C may depend
on local L2TP configuration per DNN or the received L2TP information from a DN
AAA server in Access-Accept message, request the UPF or UPF+PGW-U to setup
L2TP tunnel towards an L2TP network server (LNS) in the external DN and tunnel
the PDU Session user plane traffic in this L2TP tunnel. In this case the UPF
or UPF+PGW-U acts as a L2TP access concentrator (LAC).
To enable this, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C may provide L2TP information to the UPF
or UPF+PGW-U as LAC, such as LNS IP address or FQDN, as described in 3GPP TS
29.244 [58]. This L2TP information may be configured on the SMF or SMF+PGW-C
as part of the DNN configuration or received from the DN-AAA server.
Alternatively, the L2TP tunnel parameters may be configured in the UPF or
UPF+PGW-U. The L2TP tunnel parameters include necessary parameters for setting
up L2TP tunnel towards the LNS (e.g. LNS address, tunnel password).
In addition, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C may provide PAP/CHAP authentication
information to the UPF or UPF+PGW-U, for use in L2TP session establishment, in
case it was received from the UE in the ePCO IE of the PDU Session
Establishment Request.
When L2TP is to be used for a PDU Session, the SMF or SMF+PGW-C may select a
UPF or UPF+PGW-U and requests the UE IP address to be allocated by LNS
according to 3GPP TS 29.244 [58], the UPF (LAC) may retrieve this IP address
from the LNS.
Figure 18.1-1: L2TP Tunnel between 5GC and external DN
Below figure describes the L2TP connection procedures between 5GC and external
DN, upon the UE is accessed in 5GC and the SMF or SMF+PGW-C and UPF or
UPF+PGW-U has been negotiated supporting L2TP feature.
Figure 18.1-2: L2TP connection procedures between 5GC and external DN
0\. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C and the UPF or UPF+PGW-U negotiated supporting L2TP
feature as specified in 3GPP TS 29.244 [114].
1\. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C receives a PDU Session or PDN Connection
establishment request from the UE via AMF or MME and SGW.
The UE may include the authentication information for PAP and/or CHAP in ePCO
IE. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C may locally configure the UE authentication
information for a given DNN.
The SMF or SMF+PGW-C may determine that an L2TP session is required for the
PDU Session based on local configured L2TP parameters per DNN.
2\. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C may receive the L2TP Tunnel parameters (e.g. LNS IP
address or FQDN, tunnel password) from the DN-AAA server in Access-Accept
message or Diameter AAA message, or local configured.
> NOTE: If EAP based secondary authentication is used (e.g. DER/DEA), L2TP
> Proxy Authenticate Extensions for EAP is not supported in this release of
> the specification.
3\. If L2TP protocol is determined to support the PDU Session, the SMF or
SMF+PGW-C selects a UPF or UPF+PGW-U supporting L2TP and be configured with
the LAC name/addresses and then requests the UPF or UPF+PGW-U to setup an L2TP
tunnel if needed and/or L2TP session towards the L2TP network server (LNS).
The SMF or SMF+PGW-C sends PFCP Session Establishment Request to the UPF or
UPF+PGW-U, which may include L2TP Tunnel Information for setting up a L2TP
tunnel and L2TP session information to setup a L2TP session, together with the
information for authentication used during L2TP Tunnel setup, as well as for
L2TP session.
The L2TP Tunnel Information includes LNS IPv4 address or IPv6 address of LNS,
Tunnel Password.
The L2TP Session Information includes specific information related to the PDU
Session, e.g. a Calling Number which may be set to UE\'s GPSI, an indication
to instruct that the UPF or UPF+PGW-U shall request the LNS to allocate an IP
address for the PDU Session, indications to instruct that the UPF or UPF+PGW-U
shall request the LNS to provide DNS server addresses or NBNS server addresses
etc. as specified in 3GPP TS 29.244 [114].
4\. The UPF or UPF+PGW-U checks if any existing L2TP tunnel can be used to
serve the PDU Session according to the information provided in the L2TP Tunnel
Information.
If the UPF or UPF+PGW-U decides to setup a new L2TP tunnel, it initiates L2TP
Tunnel establishment by sending an SCCRQ (Start-Control-Connection-Request)
message towards the LNS, the UPF or UPF+PGW-U will allocate a Tunnel ID, and
it may include a CHAP Challenge to authenticate the LNS. The Challenge and
Challenge Response (to be included in SCCCN) is produced by the UPF or
UPF+PGW-U using the Tunnel Password received from the SMF or SMF+PGW-C.
The LNS responds with an SCCRP (Start-Control-Connection-Reply) message,
containing its allocated Tunnel ID and a CHAP Challenge Response to the
Challenge in SCCRQ.
The UPF or UPF+PGW-U then responds with a Challenge response for tunnel
authentication in the SCCCN (Start-Control-Connection-Connected) message. An
L2TP tunnel is established after the tunnel authentication is successful, with
the reception of the SCCCN message sent by the LAC to the LNS.
If the UPF or UPF+PGW-U decides to use an already existing L2TP tunnel for the
requested PDU Session from the UPF or UPF+PGW-C, it proceeds with step 5 below
directly without current step.
5\. If the L2TP tunnel is not successfully established, then the UPF or
UPF+PGW-U may respond to the SMF or SMF+PGW-C with PFCP Session Establishment
Response with error cause IE value set to either 87 or 89 as specified in
clause 8.2.1 of TS 29.244 [114]. The SMF, SMF+PGW-C may decide how to handle
the failure associated with the received cause code based on local policy
and/or O&M procedures.
6\. SMF or SMF+PGW-C may reject the PDU Session/PDN Connection Establishment
Request according to step 5.
7\. Once the L2TP Tunnel is established (or already present) between the LAC
and the LNS for the PDU Session/PDN Connection requested by the UE, the UPF or
UPF+PGW-U proceeds with L2TP session setup towards the LNS.
The UPF or UPF+PGW-U sends an ICRQ (Incoming-Call-Request) message towards the
LNS, which contains the Tunnel ID assigned by the LNS, its assigned Session
ID, and optionally, the Calling Number and Called Number. The LNS responds
with an ICRP (Incoming-Call-Reply) message and provides the Session ID
assigned by it to the LAC.
The LAC then sends an ICCN (Incoming-Call-Connected) message. If proxy LCP and
authentication are employed, the ICCN message includes link control parameters
(e.g. MRU) and the UE authentication information sent from the SMF or
SMF+PGW-C which was received via ePCO IE in step 1. In addition, the UPF or
UPF+PGW-U (LAC) will act as a PPP endpoint to use IPCP to request UE IP
Address, DNS server address and/or NBNS server address(es).
The LCP renegotiation may by triggered by the LNS after receiving the ICCN
message. If so, the LAC and LNS will use PPP LCP to communicate link specific
control parameter, and indicate authentication type, then either PPP PAP/CHAP
takes place. The PPP IPCP transactions takes places to retrieve UE IP Address,
DNS server address and/or NBNS server address.
8\. The status of the L2TP session setup is sent by the UPF or UPF+PGW-U to
the SMF or SMF+PGW-C in a PFCP Session Establishment Response.
9\. The SMF or SMF+PGW-C sends a PDU Session Establishment Response to the UE
and the user data session is initiated, which may contain the DNS and NBNS
Server information.
# 19 Interworking with Credentials Holder using AAA server
## 19.1 Credentials Holder using AAA server for primary authentication and
authorization
The AUSF and the UDM in SNPN may support primary authentication and
authorization of UEs using credentials from an AAA Server in a Credentials
Holder (CH).
\- Upon the UDM decides that the primary authentication is performed by AAA
Server with credentials holder and inform the AUSF that primary authentication
by a AAA server in a CH is required, the AUSF shall discover and select the
NSSAAF, and then forward EAP messages to the NSSAAF.
\- The NSSAAF selects AAA Server based on the domain name corresponds to the
realm part of the SUPI, relays EAP messages between AUSF and AAA Server (or
AAA proxy) and performs related protocol conversion. The AAA server acts as
the EAP Server for the purpose of primary authentication.
NOTE: The UDM in SNPN, based on SLA between Credentials Holder and SNPN, is
pre-configured with information indicating whether the UE needs primary
authentication from AAA server.
5G System architecture with access to SNPN using credentials from Credentials
Holder using AAA Server and related functions are defined in clause 5.30.2.9
of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
## 19.2 Credentials Holder using AAA server for primary authentication
procedure
The procedures described in this clause enables UEs to access an SNPN which
makes use of a credential management system managed by a credential provider
external to the SNPN.
In this scenario the authentication server role is taken by the AAA Server.
The AUSF acts as EAP authenticator and interacts with the AAA Server to
execute the primary authentication procedure.
Figure 19.2-1: Primary authentication with external domain
The detail procedures description is defined in clause I.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS
33.501 [59].
# 20 Interworking with MBS Application Provider (AF/AS)
## 20.1 General
For MBS user plane, the MB-UPF is used for interworking with the MBS AF/AS
(i.e. MBS Application Provider) either directly via the N6mb reference point
or via the MBSTF. In the latter case, the MB-UPF is interworking with the
MBSTF via the Nmb9 reference point and the MBSTF is interworking with the MBS
AF/AS via the Nmb8 reference point.
For MBS Group Message Delivery user plane, the MB-UPF is used for interworking
with the NEF via the MBSTF. The MB-UPF is interworking with the MBSTF via the
Nmb9 reference point and the MBSTF is interworking with the NEF (which plays
the role of the MBS AF/AS) via the Nmb14 reference point.
## 20.2 MBS interworking user plane reference point architecture
Figure 20.2-1 depicts the reference point representation of the MBS user plane
interworking architecture.
Figure 20.2-1: MBS user plane interworking architecture -- Reference point
representation
NOTE 1: From functionality point of view, Nmb9 and N6mb are identical, as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [60].
For MBS group message delivery, the NEF (playing the role of an MBS AF/AS)
shall be responsible for user plane delivery of MBS group message content to
the MBSTF over the Nmb14 interface, as specified in clauses 6.15 and 7.5 of
3GPP TS 23.247 [60].
When MBS is used to support VAL services provisioning as specified in clauses
14.2.2.1 and 14.3.4A of 3GPP TS 23.434 [63], the SEAL NRM Server shall play
the role of the MBS AF/AS for MBS user plane management over the Nmb8 and Nmb9
interfaces or the N6mb interface.
## 20.3 User Plane Protocol between MB-UPF and MBS AF/AS or MBSTF
The MBS user plane interworking protocol stack in the case of shared MBS
delivery is described in Figure 20.3-1 and Figure 20.3-2. In Figure 20.3-1,
the UDP tunnel applies to N6mb and Nmb9, while in Figure 20.3-2, the plain IP
multicast applies to N6mb.
Figure 20.3-1: User Plane Protocol Stack for N6mb/Nmb9 (UDP Tunnel)

## 20.4 User Plane Protocol between MBSTF and MBS AF/AS or NEF
The MBS user plane interworking protocol stack used over the Nmb8 reference
point is described in Figure 20.4-1 for the case of TCP/IP for the Object
Distribution Method, and in Figure 20.4-2 for the case of UDP/IP for the
Packet Distribution Method with Proxy mode or Forward-only mode . The MBS user
plane interworking protocol stack over the Nmb14 reference point shall be the
same as the MBS user plane interworking protocol stack over the Nmb8 interface
described in Figures 20.4-1 and 20.4-2 with the NEF playing the role of the
AF/AS.

# 21 Interworking with AAA server in DCS for UE onboarding in SNPNs
## 21.0 General
A UE configured with Default UE credentials shall consist of the credentials
for primary authentication and may optionally consist of the credentials for
secondary authentication, may register with an ON-SNPN for the provisioning of
SO-SNPN credentials, for the purpose of provisioning the UE with SNPN
credentials for primary authentication and other information to enable access
to a desired SNPN, i.e. (re-)select and (re-)register with SNPN.
The architectures for Onboarding of UEs in an ON-SNPN are defined in clause
5.30.2.10.2. of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
## 21.1 Primary authentication using AAA server in DCS
The AUSF in SNPN may support primary authentication and authorization of UEs
using default UE credentials meant only for primary authentication from a
Default Credentials Server (DCS) for Onboarding of UEs in an ON-SNPN. In case
of primary authentication and authorization with an AAA server in DCS the
procedures defined in clause 19.1 and clause 19.2 shall apply with the AAA
server in DCS taking the role of the AAA server in a CH. When AAA server in
DCS is used for primary authentication, the AUSF directly selects the NSSAAF
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. In this case, the UDM is not involved in
the procedure defined in Figure 19.2-1, and the step 3 to step 5 shall be
skipped.
## 21.2 Secondary authentication using AAA server in DCS
The SMF in SNPN may support secondary authentication with a Default
Credentials Server (DCS) using default UE credentials meant only for secondary
authentication upon establishment of an Onboarding PDU Session when the UE has
registered successfully with primary authentication without using DCS. In case
of secondary authentication with AAA server in DCS the procedures defined in
clause 11 and clause 12 shall apply with the AAA server in DCS taking the role
of the DN-AAA server. When AAA server in DCS is used for secondary
authentication, the SMF selects the AAA server based on its configuration or
using the DN-specific identity provided by the UE inside the EAP message in
the PDU Session Authentication Complete message as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501
[8].
###### ## Annex A (normative): Rate control related to 5G Cellular Internet of
Things (CIoT) optimisations
# A.1 General
The present annex defines specific requirements for rate control related to 5G
CIoT optimisations.
# A.2 Support of rate control of user data
## A.2.1 General
The rate of user data sent to and from a UE (e.g. a UE using 5G CIoT
Optimizations) can be controlled in two different ways:
\- Serving PLMN rate control
\- Small data rate control
Serving PLMN rate control is further described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
Small data rate control allows HPLMN operators on per user to control the
amount of user data sent DL and UL.\ This is done with help of policing user
data on a maximum number of user data packets per time unit both DL and UL.
Small data DL rate control policing is done in the UPF or the NEF and the
small data UL rate control policing is done in the UE. The UPF or NEF can also
do small data UL rate control policing.
For further information on small data rate control in the UE, see 3GPP TS
24.501 [42].
NOTE 1: Existing Session-AMBR mechanisms are not suitable for such a service
since, for radio efficiency and UE battery life reasons, an AMBR of e.g. >
100kbit/s is desirable and such an AMBR translates to a potentially large
daily data volume.
NOTE 2: For serving PLMN rate control and small data rate control, whether the
UPF or the NEF is used for data policing depends on the CIoT Optimizations
mode that UE and network support (CP or UP Optimizations) and the UE
subscription data.
## A.2.2 Small Data Rate Control
The small data rate control is configured in the (H-)SMF.
The small data rate control parameters, if configured, shall consist of:
\- the maximum number of DL user data packets per time unit,
\- the maximum number of UL user data packets per time unit, and
\- the maximum number of additional UL exception reports per time unit.
Possible time units shall be, minute, hour, day or week.
If the small data rate control is supported by the UE as indicated in the
Extended Protocol Configuration Options (ePCO) IE included in the PDU session
establishment request and if the (H-)SMF is configured to use small data rate
control, the (H-)SMF shall include the configured small data UL rate control
parameters in the ePCO IE of the PDU session establishment reply, and send the
configured small data DL rate control parameters and optionally the UL rate
control parameters to the UPF or the NEF. The small data rate control
parameters sent to UE, UPF or NEF may include a remaining small data rate
control with validity time information that shall be applied first before
applying the configured small data rate control parameters.
NOTE 1: The (H-)SMF can receive small data rate control parameters from the
AMF.
See 3GPP TS 24.501 [42] for ePCO IE definition.
If the small data UL rate control parameters are modified, the (H-)SMF shall
initiate a PDU session modification procedure and include the small data UL
rate control parameters in the ePCO IE. The (H-)SMF may also send the updated
small data UL rate control parameters to the UPF or the NEF.
If the small data DL rate control parameters are modified, the (H-)SMF shall
send the updated small data DL rate control parameters to the UPF or the NEF.
The UPF or the NEF shall enforce the small data DL rate control and may
enforce the small data UL rate control per UE.
NOTE 2: The UE locally enforces this uplink small data rate control
instruction. The UE considers this small data rate control instruction as
valid until it receives a new one from the (H-)SMF.
## A.2.3 Serving PLMN Rate Control information handling
The serving PLMN rate control is configured in the (V-)SMF and it applies per
PDU session.
This rate control is operator configurable and expressed as \"X NAS Data PDUs
per deci hour\" where X is an integer that shall not be less than 10\. There
are separate limits for uplink and downlink NAS Data PDUs:
If serving PLMN rate control information is received from the SMF, the UPF or
the NEF shall store this information and use that for DL rate control
enforcement for this UE.
The UE shall enforce the serving PLMN UL rate control based on the rate
control information received from the (V-)SMF.
The (V-)SMF may also enforce the serving PLMN UL and/or DL rate control.
If the UPF or the NEF previously have received Serving PLMN rate control
information, it shall behave as follows:
\- If the UPF or the NEF receives new Serving PLMN rate control information
from the SMF, it shall replace the old Serving PLMN rate control information
with the new Serving PLMN rate control information and use that for DL rate
control enforcement for this UE.
\- If the UPF or the NEF receives no Serving PLMN rate control information
from the SMF, it shall still consider the latest received Serving PLMN rate
control information from the SMF as valid.
\- If UPF or the NEF receives an indication that Serving PLMN rate control
does not apply from the SMF, it shall remove the rate control information
based on Serving PLMN rate control information.
Small data rate control, if configured, also applies for the same PDU session,
see clause A.2.2.
