## 4.1 Introduction
The Ntsctsf services are offered by the TSCTSF to support the Time Sensitive
Communications and Time Synchronization.
The following Ntsctsf services are specified:
\- Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization service;
\- Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance service.
\- Ntsctsf_ASTI service.
To enable the reporting of 5GS DetNet node configuration and the provisioning
and configuration data for DetNet flows, the TSCTSF offers RESTCONF (IETF RFC
8040 [30]) and/or NETCONF (IETF RFC 6241 [29]) interfaces to the DetNet
controller to access the 3GPP extended Deterministic Networking (DetNet) YANG
Model as specified in Annex B.
## 4.2 Service Architecture
The 5G System Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
The known NF service consumers of the Ntsctsf services are the Application
Function (AF) within the operator\'s trust domain and the Network Exposure
Function (NEF).
The Ntsctsf services are provided by the TSCTSF and consumed by the NF service
consumers (e.g. AF, NEF), as shown in figure 4.2-1 for the SBI representation
model and in figure 4.2-2 for the reference point representation model.
Figure 4.2-1: Ntsctsf services architecture, SBI representation
Figure 4.2-2: Ntsctsf services architecture, reference point representation
The DetNet controller, as specified in clause 4.4.8.4 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2],
is the TSCTSF\'s consumer that accesses the 3GPP extended DetNet YANG model,
as specified in Annex B, clause B.1.1.

## 5.2 Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization Service
### 5.2.1 Service Description
#### 5.2.1.1 Overview
This service provides:
\- Authorization of NF Service Consumer requests for the subscription to the
notification of the capability of time synchronization service.
\- Authorization of NF Service Consumer requests to create and update time
synchronization configuration, and to activate and deactivate the time
synchronization service as described in clause 5.27.1.8 of TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE: The AF can use either the procedure specified in bullet2) for
configuring the (g)PTP instance in 5GS or the procedure specified in clause
5.4.2.2 for controlling the 5G access stratum time distribution for a
particular UE. The procedures are not intended to be used in conjunction with
each other by the AF. However, the (g)PTP instance activation, modification,
and deactivation can influence the 5G access stratum time distribution for the
UEs that are part of the impacted PTP instance.
\- Detection and reporting of time synchronization service status based on gNB
and/or UPF/NW-TT timing synchronization status information and reporting
status updates.

capability information received from the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT and notify the NEF
or AF of the capability;
\- receive the request to create or modify the time synchronization
configuration from the NEF or AF, configure and initialize the PTP instance(s)
by constructing a PMIC to each DS-TT/UE to activate the time synchronization
service in DS-TT and PMIC(s) and UMIC to NW-TT to activate the time
synchronization service in NW-TT and provision them to the PCF;
\- determine whether the UE is inside/outside the requested time
synchronization coverage area and enforce the time synchronization service
accordingly;
\- notify the NEF or AF of the current state of the time synchronization
service configuration;
\- receive the request of time synchronization deactivation from the NEF or AF
and disable the corresponding PTP instance(s) in the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT.

same way.
#### 5.2.2.2 Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to subscribe to
notification of capability of time synchronization service for a list of UEs,
a group of UEs or any UE using a DNN/S-NSSAI combination.
The following procedures using the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsSubscribe
service operation are supported:
\- creating a new subscription;
\- modifying an existing subscription.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Creating a new subscription
Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1 illustrates the creation of a subscription.
Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1: Creation of a subscription
To subscribe the notification of the capability of time synchronization
service, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST message to the TSCTSF
to the URI \"{apiRoot}/ntsctsf-time-sync/\/subscriptions\". The
HTTP POST message shall include the TimeSyncExposureSubsc data structure as
request body. The TimeSyncExposureSubsc data structure shall include:
\- the indication of the UEs to which the time synchronization capabilities is
requested via:
\- identification of a list of individual UEs within a \"supis\" attribute;
\- identification of a list of individual UEs within a \"gpsis\" attribute;
\- indication of any UE within the \"anyUeInd\" attribute; or
\- identification of a group of UE(s) within the \"interGroupId\" attribute;
or
\- identification of a group of UE(s) within the \"exterGroupId\" attribute.
\- subscription to event(s) notification as \"subscribedEvents\" attribute;
\- notification URI within the \"subsNotifUri\" attribute;
\- notification correlation Id within the \"subsNotifId\" attribute;
\- DNN with the \"dnn\" attribute; and
\- S-NSSAI with the \"snssai\" attribute;
and may include:
\- the conditions to match for notifying the event within the \"eventFilters\"
attribute;
\- notification methods within the \"notifMethods\" attribute
\- maximum number of reports within the \"maxReportNbr\" attribute;
\- expiry time within the \"expiry\" attribute; and
\- report period within the \"repPeriod\" attribute.
Upon receipt of the HTTP request from the NF service consumer, if the request
is authorized, the TSCTSF shall:
\- create a new subscription;
\- assign a subscription correlation ID;
\- select an expiry time that is equal to or less than the expiry time
potentially received in the request;
\- store the subscription;
\- if the \"interGroupId\" attribute or \"exterGroupId\" attribute is received
from the NF service consumer, interact with the UDM to retrieve the SUPI list
that belong to the group using the Nudm_SDM service as defined in 3GPP TS
29.503 [24];
\- if the \"gpsi\" attribute is received from the NF service consumer,
interact with the UDM to retrieve the SUPI that corresponds to the GPSI using
the Nudm_SDM service as defined in 3GPP TS 29.503 [24];
\- use the parameters received from the NF service consumer (i.e. DNN, S-NSSAI
and, if available, the list of UEs or UEs that belong to the group of UEs) and
the time synchronization subscription data retrieved from UDM to determine the
matching AF-session(s) that are authorized by subscription, and for any such
AF-session for which the SUPI interact with the PCF by triggering
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create/Update request message as defined in 3GPP TS
29.514 [20].
NOTE 1: If the PCF determines an existing PDU Session is potentially impacted
by time synchronization service (based on local configuration or SM Policy
Association), the PCF invokes Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service
operation to the TSCTSF as defined in clause 4.2.5.16 of 3GPP TS 29.514 [20]
to send the received TSC User Plane Node information. At that time, the TSCTSF
retrieves from the BSF the PCF binding information (including the UE
Identities for the notified PDU session), as specified in 3GPP TS 29.521 [23],
and can create the AF-session by sending to the PCF the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation.
\- send an HTTP \"201 Created\" response with TimeSyncExposureSubsc data
structure as response body and a Location header field containing the URI of
the created individual subscription resource, i.e. \"{apiRoot}/ntsctsf-time-
sync/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\".
The TSCTSF shall handle the AF session(s) associated with the \"Individual
Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource as follows:
\- For the association of AF sessions to \"Individual Time Synchronization
Exposure Subscription\" resources:
\- Upon PDU Session establishment, i.e. when the TSCTSF receives the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation for the establishment of a
new PDU session, the TSCTSF shall retrieve from the BSF, as specified in 3GPP
TS 29.521 [23], the PCF binding information to complete the necessary AF-
Session information and triggers the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request
message to the PCF to create an AF-session to subscribe to TSC user plane node
related events. The TSCTSF, shall use the parameters of existing \"Individual
Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resources to determine whether
they shall be associated to this newly created AF sessionThe TSCTSF associates
the new AF session to the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure
Subscription\" resources for which these parameters match. The TSCTSF shall
read time synchronization capabilities from the DS-TT and NW-TT, if not
available in the AF session, from the PCF by triggering
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request message as defined in 3GPP TS 29.514
[20] and determine the (g)PTP capabilities from the DS-TT and the NW-TT as
described in clause K.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The TSCTSF shall update the
time synchronization service capability for this new DS-TT as defined in
clause 5.2.2.4.2.
\- Upon AF sessions establishment, i.e. when the TSCTSF receives the AF
request for the time synchronization service, the TSCTSF shall retrieve Time
Synchronization Subscription data from UDM. The TSCTSF, shall use the
parameters of existing \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure
Subscription\" resources to determine whether they shall be associated to this
newly created AF session. The TSCTSF associates the new AF session to the
\"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resources for which
these parameters match if the AF-session (i.e., the SUPI) is authorized by UDM
subscription, otherwise the AF-session is excluded.
\- Upon \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource
creation, the TSCTSF uses the parameters of the created resource to determine
which existing and authorized AF sessions it matches. The TSCTSF associates
the new \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource to
the authorized AF sessionsfor which these parameters match.
\- To remove an AF session from the associated ones to the \"Individual Time
Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource, when the TSCTSF receives the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation indicating the termination
of an existing PDU session, the TSCTSF triggers the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete request message to the PCF and determines if
the corresponding AF session is associated with the \"Individual Time
Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource. If it is so, the TSCTSF
shall remove the AF session from the list of AF session(s) associated with the
\"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource. The TSCTSF
shall update the time synchronization service capability for this removed DS-
TT as defined in clause 5.2.2.4.2.
NOTE 2: After the TSCTSF retrieves from the BSF the PCF binding information
(including the UE Identities for the notified PDU session), as specified in
3GPP TS 29.521 [23], the TSCTSF can store internally the information required
to invoke Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation and delay the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation (the creation of the AF
session) till the subscription to notification of the capability of time
synchronization service is received for the concerned UE. In this case, when
the TSCTSF receives the subscription request, the TSCTSF interacts with the
PCF by triggering Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create message as defined in 3GPP
TS 29.514 [20].
NOTE 3: When the TSCTSF receives the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service
operation indicating the termination of an existing PDU session associated to
an AF session that it is not associated with any \"Individual Time
Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource, the TSCTSF removes the AF-
session and triggers the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete request message to
the PCF.
If the TSCTSF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to
the internal TSCTSF error or due to the error in the HTTP POST request, the
TSCTSF shall send the HTTP error response as specified in clause 6.1.7.
##### 5.2.2.2.3 Modifying an existing subscription
Figure 5.2.2.2.3-1 illustrates the modification of a subscription.
Figure 5.2.2.2.3-1: Modification of a subscription
To modify the subscription to the notification of the capability of time
synchronization service, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT
message to the TSCTSF to the URI \"{apiRoot}/ntsctsf-time-
sync/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" representing an existing
\"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource, as shown
in figure 5.2.2.2.3-1, step 1. The HTTP PUT message shall include the
TimeSyncExposureSubsc data structure as request body. The
TimeSyncExposureSubsc data structure shall include the parameters as defined
in clause 5.2.2.2.2.
Upon receipt of the HTTP request from the NF service consumer, if the request
is authorized, the TSCTSF shall:
\- update the existing \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure
Subscription\" resource;
\- identify the affected AF session(s) based on the parameters received from
the NF service consumer and interact with the PCF by triggering
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request message as defined in 3GPP TS 29.514
[20] for the new added UE(s), by triggering Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete
request message as defined in 3GPP TS 29.514 [20] for the removed UE(s) or by
triggering Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request message as defined in 3GPP
TS 29.514 [20] for the existing UE(s) if necessary.
NOTE 1: If the PCF determines an existing PDU Session is potentially impacted
by time synchronization service (based on local configuration or SM Policy
Association), the PCF invokes Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service
operation to the TSCTSF as defined in clause 4.2.5.16 of 3GPP TS 29.514 [20]
to send the received TSC User Plane Node information. At that time, the TSCTSF
retrieves from the BSF the PCF binding information (including the UE
Identities for the notified PDU session), as specified in 3GPP TS 29.521 [23],
and can create the AF-session by sending to the PCF the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation.
NOTE 2: After the TSCTSF retrieves from the BSF the PCF binding information
(including the UE Identities for the notified PDU session), as specified in
3GPP TS 29.521 [23], the TSCTSF can store internally the information required
to invoke Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation and delay the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation (the creation of the AF-
session) till the subscription to notification of the capability of time
synchronization service is received for the concerned UE. In this case, when
the TSCTSF receives the subscription request, the TSCTSF interacts with the
PCF by triggering Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create message as defined in in
3GPP TS 29.514 [20].
\- update the list of AF sessions that are associated to the \"Individual Time
Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource (i.e. add or remove AF
sessions as associated to this resource) based on if the parameters of the AF
sessions match the updated parameters of the \"Individual Time Synchronization
Exposure Subscription\" resource.
\- send a HTTP response including \"200 OK\" status code with
TimeSyncExposureSubsc data structure or \"204 No Content\" status code, as
shown in figure 5.2.2.2.3-1, step 2.
If the HTTP PUT request from the NF service consumer is not accepted, the
TSCTSF shall indicate in the response to HTTP PUT request the cause for the
rejection as specified in clause 6.1.7.
If the TSCTSF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected,
the TSCTSF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 5.2.2.3 Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsUnsubscribe
##### 5.2.2.3.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to unsubscribe from
the notifications.
The following procedure using the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsUnsubscribe
service operation is supported:
\- unsubscription from capability notifications.
##### 5.2.2.3.2 Unsubscription from capability notifications
Figure 5.2.2.3.2-1 illustrates the unsubscription from event notifications.
Figure 5.2.2.3.2-1: Unsubscription from capability notifications
To unsubscribe from event notifications, the NF service consumer shall send an
HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/ntsctsf-time-
sync/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI, where
\"{**subscriptionId**}\" is the subscription correlation ID of the existing
subscription that is to be deleted.
Upon the reception of the HTTP DELETE request, if the received HTTP request is
successfully processed and accepted, the TSCTSF shall:
\- remove the corresponding subscription;
\- identify the affected AF session(s) and, for each AF session, interact with
the PCF by triggering Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete request message as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.514 [20]; and
\- send an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response.
If the HTTP DELETE request from the NF service consumer is not accepted, the
TSCTSF shall indicate in the response to HTTP DELETE request the cause for the
rejection as specified in clause 6.1.7.
If the TSCTSF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be
redirected, the TSCTSF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in
clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 5.2.2.4 Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsNotify
##### 5.2.2.4.1 General
This service operation is used by the TSCTSF to send notifications to NF
service consumers upon the detection of the capability of the time
synchronization service for a list of UEs.
The following procedure using the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_CapsNotify
service operation is supported:
\- notification about the capability of time synchronization service.
##### 5.2.2.4.2 Notification about the capability of time synchronization
service
Figure 5.2.2.4.2-1 illustrates the notification about the capability of time
synchronization service.
Figure 5.2.2.4.2-1: Notification about the capability of time synchronization
service
The TSCTSF maintains the association between the AF session(s) and the
Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Subscription resource as defined in
clause 5.2.2.2.2 and detects the capability of time synchronization service
(for a list of UEs, a group of UEs or any UE in a DNN and S-NSSAI), by
composing the time synchronization capabilities for the DS-TT/UE(s) connected
to the NW-TT based on the capability information received from the DS-TT(s)
and NW-TT via the PCF. If the NF service consumer includes an Event Filter
with one or more of the requested PTP instance type, requested transport
protocol for PTP, or requested PTP Profile, the TSCTSF considers only the DS-
TT(s) and NW-TT(s) with these capabilities as part of the time synchronization
capability set that is reported to the NF service consumer. If necessary, when
the list of AF session(s) associated to the Individual Time Synchronization
Exposure Subscription resource changes, e.g. upon PDU Session establishment or
termination, the TSCTSF may notify the update of the capability of time
synchronization service for the DS-TT/UE(s) connected to the NW-TT(s). In
order to send the capability of time synchronization service to the NF service
consumer, the TSCTSF shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{subsNotifUri}\",
as previously provided by the NF service consumer within the corresponding
subscription, as request URI and TimeSyncExposureSubsNotif data structure as
request body that shall include:
\- Notification correlation ID provided by the NF service consumer during the
subscription within \"subsNotifId\" attribute; and
\- information about the observed event(s) within the \"eventNotifs\"
attribute that shall contain for each observed event an
\"SubsEventNotification\" data structure that shall include:
1\. the detected event within the \"event\" attribute;
> 2\. when the event is \"AVAILABILITY_FOR_TIME_SYNC_SERVICE\", the
> capabilities of time synchronization service for one or more user plane
> nodes with the \"timeSyncCapas\" attribute. Within each instance of
> TimeSyncCapability data structure, the TSCTSF shall include the identifier
> of the applicable NW-TT within the \"upNodeId\" attribute, the
> \"gmCapables\" attribute indicating if the user plane node supports acting
> as a gPTP and/or PTP grandmaster, the supported 5G clock quality within the
> \"asTimeRes\" attribute, if applicable, and the PTP capabilities for each UE
> within the \"ptpCapForUes\" attribute, when the UEs are identified with a
> SUPI, or within \"ptpCapForGpsis\" attribute, when the UEs are identified
> with a GPSI.
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP
\"204 No Content\" response for a successful processing.
If the HTTP POST request from the TSCTSF is not accepted, the NF service
consumer shall indicate in the response to HTTP POST request the cause for the
rejection as specified in clause 6.1.7.
If the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to
be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as
specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 5.2.2.5 Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate
##### 5.2.2.5.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to create a time
synchronization configuration and activate the time synchronization service
with the configuration.
The following procedures using the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigCreate
service operation are supported:
\- creating a new configuration; and
\- creating a subscription for notification for the changes in the time
synchronization service configuration.
##### 5.2.2.5.2 Creating a new configuration
Figure 5.2.2.5.2-1 illustrates the creation of a configuration.
Figure 5.2.2.5.2-1: Creation of a configuration
To create a configuration, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST
message to the TSCTSF to the URI \"{apiRoot}/ntsctsf-time-
sync/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/configurations\". The HTTP
POST message shall include the TimeSyncExposureConfig data structure as
request body, as shown in figure 5.2.2.5.2-1, step 1. The
TimeSyncExposureConfig data structure shall include:
\- the user plane node Id within the \"upNodeId\" attribute;
\- the requested PTP instance within the \"reqPtpIns\" attribute;
\- the time domain within the \"timeDom\" attribute;
\- the notification URI within the \"configNotifUri\" attribute;
\- the notification correlation Id within the \"configNotifId\" attribute;
and may include:
\- the \"gmEnable\" attribute set to true if the AF requests 5GS to act as a
grandmaster for PTP or gPTP;
\- the time synchronization error budget within the \"timeSyncErrBdgt\"
attribute;
\- the gandmaster priority with the \"gmPrio\" attribute;
\- the temporal validity condition within the \"tempValidity\" attribute;
\- if the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported, the time
synchronization coverage area encoded as \"covReq\" attribute, that contains a
list of Tracking Area codes per serving network where the requested PTP
instance applies; and
\- if the \"NetTimeSyncStatus\" feature is supported, the clock quality detail
level in the \"clkQltDetLvl\" attribute and the clock quality acceptance
criteria for the affected UE(s) in the \"clkQltAcptCri\" attribute within the
\"timeSyncStatusParam\" attribute if the NF service consumer to subscribe to
receiving network time synchronization status report(s).
Upon receipt of the HTTP request from the NF service consumer, if the request
is authorized, the TSCTSF shall:
\- create a new resource, which represents a new \"Individual Time
Synchronization Exposure Configuration\" instance, addressed by a URI as
defined in clause 6.1.3.5 and containing a TSCTSF created resource identifier;
\- send an HTTP \"201 Created\" response with TimeSyncExposureConfig data
structure as response body and a Location header field containing the URI of
the created Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Configuration resource,
i.e. \"{apiRoot}/ntsctsf-time-
sync/\/subscriptions/{subcriptionId}/configuration/{configurationId}\",
as shown in figure 5.2.2.5.2-1, step 2;
\- use the {subscriptionId} within the requested URI and user plane node ID
within the \"upNodeId\" attribute in the request to determine the target UEs
and corresponding authorized AF sessions, then use the parameters (e.g.
requested PTP instance type, transport protocol, and PTP profile) in the
request to determine suitable DS-TT(s) and AF session(s) among all the AF
session(s) and:
a. if the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported and a time
synchronization coverage area is provided within the \"covReq\" attribute, the
TSCTSF perform the following operations:
1\. if the UE\'s Time Synchronization Subscription data from the UDM contains
the list of TA(s) that comprise the authorized time synchronization coverage
area. If the requested time synchronization coverage area within the
\"covReq\" attribute is within the subscribed time synchronization coverage
area, the TSCTSF determines that the time synchronization coverage area is
fulfilled, and the UE is authorized for the requested time synchronization
service. If the Authorized Time Synchronization Coverage Area is inside of the
requested Coverage Area, the TSCTSF uses the Authorized Time Synchronization
Coverage Area. If the requested Coverage Area partly overlaps with the
Authorized Time Synchronization Coverage Area, the TSCTSF uses the
intersection of them. If there is no overlap between them, the TSCTSF shall
reject the AF request as described in clause 5.27.1.11 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
2\. The TSCTSF discovers the list of AMF(s) serving the list of TA(s) that
comprise the authorized time synchronization coverage area using the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery service operation as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [10], if
they are not available, and, for each UE with matched AF-sessions, subscribes
with the discovered AMF(s) to receive notifications about presence of the UE
in an Area of Interest events using the Namf_EventExposure service as
described in 3GPP TS 29.518 [27], where the Area of Interest is the provided
time synchronization coverage area.
3\. Based on the outcome provided by the AMF about the UE's presence in the
Area of Interest and the authorized time synchronization coverage area, the
TSCTSF determines if the time synchronization service is activated or
deactivated:
i. If the UE presence is within any of the TAs from the authorized time
synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines that the time
synchronization coverage area condition is fulfilled, and the UE is authorized
for the activation of the received PTP instance configuration.
ii. If the UE presence is not within any of the TAs from the authorized time
synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines that the time
synchronization coverage area condition is not fulfilled, and the UE is not
authorized for the activation of the received PTP instance configuration;
b If the UE\'s Time Synchronization Subscription data contains the authorized
Uu time synchronization error budget, and the requested time synchronization
error budget within the \"timeSyncErrBdgt\" attribute is within the authorized
time synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines that the UE is
authorized for the requested time synchronization service.
c. If the UE\'s Time Synchronization Subscription data contains the periods of
authorized start and stop times, and the requested temporal validity condition
within the \"tempValidity\" attribute is within any of the subscribed periods
of authorized start and stop times, the TSCTSF determines that the UE is
authorized for the requested time synchronization service.
> \- for each authorized UE and matched AF-session, contact with the each
> corresponding PCF for the PDU session to configure and initialize the PTP
> instance in the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause
> 4.15.9.3.2, step 5-6;
\- for each authorized UE with matched AF-session(s), calculate the Uu time
synchronization error budget as specified in clauses 5.27.1.9 and 5.27.1.11 of
3GPP TS 23.501 [2], subscribe to event notifications of newly registered PCF
for the UE for the affected UEs by invoking Nbsf_Management_Subscribe Service
Operation as defined in clause 4.2.6 of 3GPP TS 29.521 [23] if not yet done,
and send a request to the PCF for the UE for AM policy authorization by
invoking Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Create service operation as defined in
clause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.534 [14] providing the appropriate values in the
\"asTimeDisParam\" attribute in order to activate the access stratum time
distribution and provide the calculated Uu time synchronization error budget.
\- if the \"NetTimeSyncStatus\" feature is supported and upon the reception of
the clock quality acceptance criteria in the \"clkQltAcptCri\" attribute, then
TSCTSF subscribes to UPF/NW-TT time synchronization status reports via UMIC as
described in clause 4.2.2.31 of 3GPP TS 29.514 [20], if the UPF/NW-TT is
involved in providing time synchronization information to DS-TT. In case NG-
RAN is involved in providing time synchronization status information to DS-TT,
then TSCTSF sends the time synchronization status reporting control
information to the NG-RAN via AMF using the Namf_Communication
_NonUeN2MessageTransfer service operation and then initiates the subscriotion
to the NG-RAN time synchronization status via AMF using
Namf_Communication_NonUeN2InfoSubscribe service operation, if not previously
done for the involved NG-RAN node, as described in 3GPP TS 29.518 [27].
If the temporal validity condition is provided and if the start-time is in the
future, the TSCTSF shall maintain the time synchronization configuration and
then proceed as described above when the start-time is reached; otherwise, if
the start-time is in the past, the TSCTSF shall proceed as described above
immediately. When the stop-time is reached for active time synchronization
service configuration, the TSCTSF shall proceed as
Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigDelete was received as described in clause
5.2.2.7.2 without interacting with the AF.
The TSCTSF shall associate the affected UEs and matched AF sessions to the
\"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Configuration\". When the
\"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported, the TSCTSF also associates
whether the UE fulfills the time synchronization coverage area condition, if
provided. When receiving the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation
indicating the termination of an existing PDU session and the corresponding AF
session is associated with the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure
Configuration\" resource, the TSCTSF shall remove the AF session from the list
of AF sessions associated with the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure
Configuration\" resource and invoke Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Delete service
operation as defined in clause 4.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.534 [14] to remove the
access stratum time distribution parameters for the UE if they were provided.
If for all the affected UEs the provided parameters are not allowed by
subscription, the TSCTSF shall indicate in an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response
message the \"cause\" attribute set to \"UE_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\".
If the HTTP POST request from the NF service consumer is not accepted, the
TSCTSF shall indicate in the response to HTTP POST request the cause for the
rejection as specified in clause 6.1.7.
If the TSCTSF determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be
redirected, the TSCTSF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in
clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 5.2.2.6 Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdate
##### 5.2.2.6.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to update a time
synchronization configuration.
The following procedures using the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdate
service operation are supported:
\- Updating an existing configuration;
\- Creating the subscription for notification for the changes in the time
synchronization service configuration in case the subscription was not created
before.
##### 5.2.2.6.2 Updating an existing configuration
Figure 5.2.2.6.2-1 illustrates the updating of an existing configuration.
Figure 5.2.2.6.2-1: Update of a configuration
To update a configuration, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT
request to the resource \"{apiRoot}/ntsctsf-time-
sync/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/configurations/{configurationId}\"
representing an existing \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure
Configuration\" resource, as shown in figure 5.2.2.6.2-1, step 1, to modify
the configuration.
The TimeSyncExposureConfig data structure provided in the request body shall
include:
\- the user plane node Id within the \"upNodeId\" attribute;
NOTE 1: The user plane node Id cannot be changed during the modification.
\- the requested PTP instance within the \"reqPtpIns\" attribute;
\- the time domain within the \"timeDom\" attribute;
NOTE 2: The user plane node Id, the requested PTP instance and the time domain
cannot be changed during the modification.
\- the notification URI within the \"configNotifUri\" attribute;
\- the notification correlation Id within the \"configNotifId\" attribute;
NOTE 2: If the notification URI or notification correlation Id is not changed
the previously value is included.
and may include:
\- the \"gmEnable\" attribute set to true if the AF requests 5GS to act as a
grandmaster for PTP or gPTP;
\- the time synchronization error budget within the \"timeSyncErrBdgt\"
attribute;
\- the gandmaster priority with the \"gmPrio\" attribute;
\- the temporal validity condition within the \"tempValidity\" attribute;
\- if the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported, the spatial validity
condition encoded as \"covReq\" attribute, that contains a list of Tracking
Area codes per serving network where the requested PTP instance applies; and
\- if the \"NetTimeSyncStatus\" feature is supported, the clock quality detail
level in the \"clkQltDetLvl\" attribute and the clock quality acceptance
criteria for the affected UE(s) in the \"clkQltAcptCri\" attribute within the
\"timeSyncStatusParam\" attribute.
Upon receipt of the corresponding HTTP PUT message, if the request is
authorized, theTSCTSF shall:
\- update the existing \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure
Configuration\" resource;
\- send a HTTP response including \"200 OK\" status code with
TimeSyncExposureConfig data structure or \"204 No Content\" status code, as
shown in figure 5.2.2.6.2-1, step 2;
\- use the {subscriptionId} within the requested URI and user plane node ID
within the \"upNodeId\" attribute in the request to determine the target UEs
and corresponding AF-sessions, then use the updated parameters (e.g. requested
PTP instance type, transport protocol, and PTP profile) in the request to
determine suitable DS-TT(s) and AF session(s) among all AF session:
a. If the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported and a requested
coveragea area is provided or updated within the \"covReq\" attribute, the
TSCTSF perform the following operations:
1\. the TSCTSF, based on the time synchronization coverage area retrieved from
UDM determines whether the UE is authorized for the request again as described
in clause 5.2.2.5.2.
2\. The TSCTSF discovers the list of AMF(s) serving the list of TA(s) that
comprise the authorized time synchronization coverage area using the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery service operation as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [10], if
they are not available, and for each UE with matched AF-sessions,
subscribes/updates the subscription, if applicable, with the discovered AMF(s)
to receive notifications about presence of the UE in an Area of Interest
events using the Namf_EventExposure service as described in 3GPP TS 29.518
[27], where the Area of Interest is the requested/applicable spatial validity
condition.
3\. Based on the outcome provided by the AMF or available in the TSCTSF about
the UE's presence in the Area of Interest, the TSCTSF determines if the time
synchronization service is activated or deactivated:
i. If the UE presence is within any of the TAs from the authorized time
synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines that the spatial validity
condition is fulfilled, and the UE is authorized for the activation of the
received PTP instance configuration.
\- If the UE presence is within any of the TAs from the authorized time
synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines that the spatial validity
condition is not fulfilled, and the UE is not authorized for the activation of
the received PTP instance configuration;
b. If the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported and a requested
coverage area previously provided is removed, the TSCTSF perform the following
operations:
1\. For each UE with matched AF-sessions, the TSCTSF terminates the
subscriptions to notifications about presence of the UE in an Area of Interest
events using the Namf_EventExposure service as described in 3GPP TS 29.518
[27].
2\. For each UE with matched AF-sessions that did not fulfil the removed
spatial validity condition, the TSCTSF determines the UE is authorized for the
activation of the received PTP instance configuration
c. If the time synchronization error budget within the \"timeSyncErrBdgt\"
attribute and/or the temporal validity condition within the \"tempValidity\"
attribute from the NF service consumer is provided, updated, or removed, the
TSCTSF based on the Time Synchronization Subscription data retrieved from the
UDM determines whether the UE is authorized for the request again as described
in clause 5.2.2.5.2
\- for each authorized UE and matched AF-session, and contact with each
correspondingPCF for the PDU session to configure and initialize the PTP
instance in the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause
4.15.9.3.3, step 5-6. The TSCTSF associates the new affected AF session(s)
with the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Configuration\" resource.
\- for each authorized UE with matched AF-session(s), if the time
synchronization error budget is provided, updated, or removed, calculate the
Uu time synchronization error budget as specified in clause 5.27.1.9 of 3GPP
TS 23.501 [2]and send a request to the PCF for the UE for AM policy
authorization by invoking Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Update service operation
as defined in clause 4.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.534 [14] in order to update the Uu
time synchronization error budget.
\- if the \"NetTimeSyncStatus\" feature is supported and upon the reception of
the updated clock quality acceptance criteria within the \"clkQltAcptCri\"
attribute, then TSCTSF determines the clock acceptance criteria results as
specified in clause 5.2.2.8.2. In case the updated clock quality acceptance
criteria within the \"clkQltAcptCri\" attribute is received and the clock
acceptance criteria results is not available, then TSCTSF subscribes to
UPF/NW-TT time synchronization status reports via UMIC as described in clause
4.2.3.34 of 3GPP TS 29.514 [20], if the UPF/NW-TT is involved in provoding
time information to DS-TT. In case NG-RAN is involved in providing time
synchronization status information to DS-TT, then TSCTSF sends the updated
confiugration of time synchronization status reporting to the NG-RAN via AMF
using the Namf_Communication_NonUeN2MessageTransfer service operation and then
initiates the subscription to the NG-RAN time synchronization status via AMF
using Namf_Communication_NonUeN2InfoSubscribe service operation, as described
in 3GPP TS 29.518 [27]
If the temporal validity condition was provided but it is removed during the
update of time synchronization configuration, the TSCTSF shall perform the
time synchronization configuration as described above without considering the
temporal validity condition.
If the temporal validity condition was not provided and the temporal validity
condition is provided during the update of configuration, the TSCTSF shall
perform as follows:
\- if the start-time is in the future, the TSCTSF shall maintain the time
synchronization configuration and then proceeds as described above when the
start-time is reached; otherwise, if the start-time is in the past, the TSCTSF
shall proceed as described above immediately;
\- When the stop-time is reached for active time synchronization service
configuration, the TSCTSF shall proceed as
Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigDelete was received as described in clause
5.2.2.7.2 without interacting with the AF.
If the temporal validity condition was provided and the temporal validity
condition is updated during the update of configuration, the TSCTSF shall
perform as follows:
\- if the previously provided time configuration is being applied but the new
start-time is in the future, the TSCTSF shall proceed as
Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigDelete was received as described in clause
5.2.2.7.2 without interacting with the AF firstly and then proceeds as
described above when the new start-time is reached; otherwise if the time
synchronization configuration has been created but the new start-time is in
the past, the TSCTSF keep the existing configuration;
\- when the new stop-time is reached for active time synchronization service
configuration, the TSCTSF shall proceed as
Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigDelete was received as described in clause
5.2.2.7.2 without interacting with the AF;
\- if the previously provided time configuration is not being applied because
the previously provided start-time is in the future, the TSCTSF shall perform
as the case that the temporal validity condition was not provided previously.
The TSCTSF shall associate the affected UEs and matched AF session to the
\"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Configuration\". When the
\"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported, the TSCTSF also associates
whether the UE fulfills the spatial validity condition, if provided. When
receiving the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation indicating the
termination of an existing PDU session and the corresponding AF session is
associated with the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Configuration\"
resource, the TSCTSF shall remove the AF session from the list of AF sessions
associated with the \"Individual Time Synchronization Exposure Configuration\"
resource and invoke Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation as
defined in clause 4.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.534 [14] to remove the access stratum
time distribution parameters for the UE if they were provided.
If for all the affected UEs the provided parameters are not allowed by
subscription, the TSCTSF shall indicate in an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response
message the \"cause\" attribute set to \"UE_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\".
If the HTTP PUT request from the NF service consumer is not accepted, the
TSCTSF shall indicate in the response to HTTP PUT request the cause for the
rejection as specified in clause 6.1.7.
If the TSCTSF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected,
the TSCTSF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

This service operation is used by an TSCTSF to notify the NF Service Consumer
of the current state of the time synchronization configuration.
The following procedures using the
Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization_ConfigUpdateNotify service operation are
supported:
\- notification about the current state of the time synchronization
configuration.
##### 5.2.2.8.2 Notifying the current state of an existing configuration
Figure 5.2.2.8.2-1 illustrates the notification about the current state of the
time synchronization configuration.
Figure 5.2.2.8.2-1: Notification about the current state of the time
synchronization configuration
When the TSCTSF receives the notification of the change in the PTP instance
for each DS-TT and/or NW-TT from the PCF as defined in clause 4.2.5.13 of 3GPP
TS 29.514 [20] or when the TSCTSF receives the NG-RAN time synchronization
status update related to clock quality acceptance criteria via AMF as
described in clause 5.2.2.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [27] and determines the
affected PTP instance(s), the TSCTSF shall determine the current state of the
time synchronization configuration and sends an HTTP POST request with
\"{configNotifUri}\", as previously provided by the NF service consumer within
the corresponding configuration, as URI and the TimeSyncExposureConfigNotif
data structure as request body, as shown in figure 5.2.2.8.2-1, step 1.
The TimeSyncExposureConfigNotif data structure as request body that shall
include:

in clauses 5.2.2.5.2 and 5.2.2.6.2, when the TSCTSF receives a change in the
UE presence in Area of Interest notification as described in 3GPP TS 29.518
[27], the TSCTSF checks the activation or deactivation of the time
synchronization service and adds/removes the UE/DS-TT port to/from the PTP
instance and configures the Grandmaster functionality, as applicable, as
specified in clause K.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. For the added/removed UE/DS-
TT port to/from the PTP instance, the TSCTSF triggers the notification to the
NF service consumer where the \"stateOfDstts\" attribute within the
\"stateOfConfig\" attribute shall include the state of the added/removed
UE/DS-TT port.
If the HTTP POST request from the TSCTSF is not accepted, the NF service
consumer shall indicate in the response to HTTP POST request the cause for the
rejection as specified in clause 6.1.7.
If the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to
be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as
specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

##### 5.3.2.2.2 Initial provisioning of TSC related service information
This procedure is used to set up a TSC AF application session context for the
service as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS
23.503 [19].
Figure 5.3.2.2.2-1 illustrates the initial provisioning of TSC related service
information.
Figure 5.3.2.2.2-1: Initial provisioning of TSC related service information
When a new TSC AF application session context needs to be established, the NF
service consumer shall invoke the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Create service
operation by sending the HTTP POST request to the resource URI representing
the \"TSC Application Sessions\" collection resource of the TSCTSF, as shown
in figure 5.3.2.2.2-1, step 1.
The NF service consumer shall include the \"TscAppSessionContextData\" data
type in the payload body of the HTTP POST request in order to request the
creation of the \"Individual TSC Application Session Context\" resource. The
\"Individual TSC Application Session Context\" resource and the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource are created as described below.
The NF service consumer shall include in the \"TscAppSessionContextData\" data
structure:
\- the AF identifier within the \"afId\" attribute;
\- when the \"GMEC\" feature is not supported, either the IP address (IPv4 or
IPv6) of the PDU session within the \"ueIpAddr\" attribute for IP type PDU
session or the MAC address of the DS-TT port within the \"ueMac\" attribute
for Ethernet type PDU sessions;
\- when the \"GMEC\" feature is supported, either the targeted UE within the
\"ueId\" attribute or the targeted group of UE(s) within the
\"externalGroupId\" attribute as defined in clause 5.3.2.2.8;
\- either the Application Id within the \"appId\" attribute or the flow
information within:
a. for IP flows, the \"flowInfo\" attribute; or
b. for Ethernet flows, either the \"ethFlowInfo\" attribute or, if the
Ethernet_UL/DL_Flows feature is supported, the \"enEthFlowInfo\" attribute;
\- the QoS reference within the \"qosReference\" attribute or the individual
QoS parameter set (i.e. requested GBR, requested MBR, requested maximum burst
size, requested priority if received and requested 5GS delay if received, and
requested packet error rate if received) within the \"tscQosReq\" attribute;
\- the input information to construct the TSC Assistance Container within the
\"tscaiInputUl\" attribute and/or \"tscaiInputDl\" attribute of the
\"tscQosReq\" attribute and the (g)PTP domain that the AF is located in within
the \"tscaiTimeDom\" attribute of the \"tscQosReq\" attribute, if available;
and
\- the URI where the TSCTSF can request to the NF service consumer to delete
the \"Individual TSC Application Session Context\" resource within the
\"notifUri\" attribute;
and may include:
\- the DNN within the \"dnn\" attribute;
\- the S-NSSAI within the \"snssai\" attribute;
\- the domain identity in the \"ipDomain\" attribute;
\- if the \"EnTSCAC\" feature is supported, the capability for BAT adaptation
in the \"capBatAdaptation\" attribute;
\- an ordered list of alternative QoS references within the
\"altQosReferences\" attribute if the QoS reference is provided or an ordered
list of requested alternative QoS parameters set(s) within the \"altQosReqs\"
attribute if the individual QoS parameter set is provided. When the NF service
consumer provides the \"altQosReferences\" attribute or the \"altQosReqs\"
attribute, the NF service consumer shall also subscribe to receive
notifications from the TSCTSF when the resources associated to the
corresponding service information have been allocated as described in clause
5.3.2.2.5 and when the GBR QoS targets for one or more service data flows can
no longer (or can again) be guaranteed, as described in clause 5.3.2.2.3;
and
\- the request of the notification of certain user plane events within the
\"evSubsc\" attribute. Within the EventsSubscReqData data structure, the NF
service consumer shall include:
a) the URI where the TSCTSF sends the event notification to the NF service
consumer within the \"notifUri\" attribute;
b) a Notification Correlation Identifier for the requested notifications
within the \"notifCorreId\" attribute;
c) the subscribed events within the \"events\" attribute;
d) the usage threshold within the \"usgThres\" attribute if the
\"USAGE_REPORT\" event is subscribed; and
e) QoS monitoring information within the \"qosMon\" attribute if the
\"QOS_MONITORING\" event is subscribed.
Upon the reception of this HTTP POST request, the TSCTSF shall:
\- construct the TSC Assistance Container based on information provided by the
NF service consumer;
\- if the Requested 5GS delay including the requested 5GS delay within the
individual QoS parameter set or within the requested alternative QoS
parameters set(s) is received from NF service consumer, calculate a Requested
PDB by subtracting the UE-DS-TT residence time either provided by the PCF or
pre-configured at TSCTSF from the Requested 5GS delay;
\- if the time domain information is not received with the Burst Arrival Time
or Periodicity within the \"tscQosReq\" attribute from the NF service
consumer, the TSCTSF may indicate Time Domain = \"5GS\" within the
\"tscaiTimeDom\" attribute within the \"tscQosReq\" attribute to indicate that
the NF service consumer does not provide the time domain information;
NOTE 1: The Time Domain value corresponding to \"5GS\" is locally configured
in the SMF and in the TSCTSF, and indicates that the AF does not provide a
Time Domain and the provided TSCAI input information will be used without
adjustments.
\- if the feature EnTSCAC is supported and if the NF service consumer includes
the capability for BAT adaptation within the \"capBatAdaptation\" attribute or
a BAT window within the \"burstArrivalTimeWnd\" attribute within the
\"tscaiInputUl\" attribute and/or \"tscaiInputDl\" attribute of the
\"tscQosReq\" attribute or the periodicity range in the \"periodicityRange\"
attribute in the request, then the TSCTSF shall subscribe to the notification
on BAT offset by using the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type including an event
within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"BAT_OFFSET_INFO;
\- interact with the PCF for the received UE address:
a) if the TSCTSF has an AF-session with the PCF for the received UE address,
the TSCTSF shall interact with the PCF by triggering a
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request to provision the related parameters to
the PCF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.514 [20]; or
b) if the TSCTSF does not have an AF-Session with the PCF for the received UE
address, the TSCTSF shall discover the PCF for the PDU session as specified in
3GPP TS 29.521 [23], and shall interact with the PCF by triggering a
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create to provision the related parameters to the PCF
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.514 [20]; and
NOTE 2: If the PCF determines an existing PDU Session is related with TSC
traffic (based on local configuration or SM Policy Association), the PCF
invokes Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation to the TSCTSF as
defined in clause 4.2.5.16 of 3GPP TS 29.514 [20] to send the received TSC
User Plane Node information. At that time, the TSCTSF retrieves from the BSF
the PCF binding information, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.521 [23], and can
create the AF-session by sending to the PCF the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation, if TSC related information,
as e.g. QoS requirements, and/or subscription to PMIC(s)/UMIC updates need to
be provided to the PCF.
NOTE 3: After the TSCTSF retrieves from the BSF the PCF binding information
(including the UE Identities for the notified PDU session), as specified in
3GPP TS 29.521 [23], the TSCTSF can store internally the received information
and delay the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation (the creation
of the AF-session). In this case, when the TSCTSF receives the QoS request,
the TSCTSF interacts with the PCF by triggering a
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request to provision the related parameters to
the PCF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.514 [20].
\- if receiving a successful response from the PCF, the TSCSTF shall create an
\"Individual TSC Application Session Context\" resource and send to the NF
service consumer a \"201 Created\" response to the HTTP POST request, as shown
in figure 5.3.2.2.2-1, step 2. If the \"evSubsc\" attribute is received, the
\"Events Subscription\" sub-resource shall be created within the \"Individual
TSC Application Session Context\" resource. The TSCTSF shall include in the
\"201 Created\" response:
a) a Location header field; and
b) a \"TscAppSessionContextData\" data type in the payload body.
The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created \"Individual
TSC Application Session Context\" i.e. \"{apiRoot}/ntsctsf-qos-
tscai/\/tsc-app-sessions/{appSessionId}\".
When \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource is created in this procedure, the NF
service consumer shall build the sub-resource URI by adding the path segment
\"/events-subscription\" at the end of the URI path received in the Location
header field.
If the TSCTSF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to
the internal TSCTSF error or due to the error in the HTTP POST request, the
TSCTSF shall send the HTTP error response as specified in clause 6.2.7.
The TSCTSF may send the following error responses based on failed AF-session
creation/update request responses received from the PCF as specified in 3GPP
TS 29.514 [20]:
a. If the TSCSTSF receives the indication that the PCF failed in executing
session binding, the TSCTSF shall reject the HTTP POST request with an HTTP
\"500 Internal Server Error\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set
to \"PDU_SESSION_NOT_AVAILABLE\".
b. If the service information provided in the body of the HTTP POST request is
rejected by the PCF (e.g. the subscribed guaranteed bandwidth for a particular
user is exceeded or the authorized data rate in that slice for a UE is
exceeded), the TSCTSF shall indicate in an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response
message the cause for the rejection including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\", as received.
c. If the service information provided in the body of the HTTP POST request is
rejected due to a temporary condition in the network, the TSCTSF may include
in the \"403 Forbidden\" response the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"REQUESTED_SERVICE_TEMPORARILY_NOT_AUTHORIZED\". The TSCTSF may also provide
a received retry interval within the \"Retry-After\" HTTP header field. When
the NF service consumer receives the retry interval within the \"Retry-After\"
HTTP header field, the NF service consumer shall not send the same service
information to the TSCTSF again (for the same application session context)
until the retry interval has elapsed. The \"Retry-After\" HTTP header is
described in 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] clause 5.2.2.2.
The TSCTSF may additionally provide the received acceptable bandwidth within
the attribute \"acceptableServInfo\" included in the
\"ProblemDetailsTsctsfQosTscac\" data structure returned in the rejection
response message.
##### 5.3.2.2.3 Subscriptions to Service Data Flow QoS notification control
The NF service consumer shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as
described in clause 5.3.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request
message an event within the \"evSubsc\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute
set to \"QOS_GUARANTEED\" and an event within the \"evSubsc\" attribute with
the \"event\" attribute set to \"QOS_NOT_GUARANTEED\".
The TSCTSF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause
5.3.2.2.2.
As result of this action, the TSCTSF shall set the appropriate subscription to
QoS notification control as described in in 3GPP TS 29.514 [20].
##### 5.3.2.2.4 Subscription to Service Data Flow Deactivation
The NF service consumer shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as
described in clause 5.3.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request
message an event entry within the \"evSubsc\" attribute with the \"event\"

5.3.2.2.2.
As result of this action, the TSCTSF shall set the appropriate subscription to
service data flow deactivation as described in in 3GPP TS 29.514 [20].
##### 5.3.2.2.5 Subscription to resources allocation outcome
The NF service consumer shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as
described in clause 5.3.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request
message:
\- if the NF service consumer requests the TSCTSF to provide a notification
when the resources associated to the service information have been allocated,
an event entry within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute
set to \"SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\"; and/or
\- if the NF service consumer requests the TSCTSF to provide a notification
when the resources associated to the service information cannot be allocated,
an event entry within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute
set to \"FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\".
The TSCTSF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause
5.3.2.2.2.
As result of this action, the TSCTSF shall set the appropriate subscription to
notification of resources allocation outcome as described in in 3GPP TS 29.514
[20].
##### 5.3.2.2.6 Subscriptions to Service Data Flow QoS Monitoring Information
The NF service consumer shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as
described in clause 5.3.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request
message an event within the \"evSubsc\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute
set to \"QOS_MONITORING\" and include the QoS monitoring information with the
\"qosMon\" attribute. Within the QosMonitoringInformation data structure, the
AF shall include:
\- one or more requested QoS Monitoring Parameter(s) within the
\"reqQosMonParams\"; and
\- one or more report frequency within the \"repFreqs\" attribute; and
\- when the \"repFreqs\" attribute includes the value \"PERIODIC\", the
periodic time for reporting and, if the feature \"PacketDelayFailureReport\"
is supported, the maximum period with no QoS measurement results reported
within the \"repPeriod\" attribute; and
\- when the \"repFreqs\" attribute includes the value \"EVENT_TRIGGERED\", the
AF shall include:
\- the minimum waiting time between subsequent reports within the \"waitTime\"
attribute; and
for QoS monitoring for packet delay:
\- the delay threshold for downlink with the \"repThreshDl\" attribute;
\- the delay threshold for uplink with the \"repThreshUl\" attribute; and/or
\- the delay threshold for round trip with the \"repThreshRp\" attribute; and
\- if the feature \"PacketDelayFailureReport\" is supported, the maximum
period with no QoS measurement results reported within the\"repPeriod\"
attribute.
The TSCTSF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause
5.3.2.2.2.
As result of this action, the TSCTSF shall set the appropriate subscription to
service data flow QoS monitoring information as described in in 3GPP TS 29.514
[20].
##### 5.3.2.2.7 Initial provisioning of sponsored connectivity information
The NF service consumer may include in the HTTP POST request message described
in clause 5.3.2.2.2 an application service provider identity and a sponsor
identity within the \"aspId\" attribute and \"sponId\" attribute.
Additionally, the NF service consumer may provide an indication to the TSCTSF
of sponsored data connectivity not enabled by including the \"sponStatus\"
attribute set to \"SPONSOR_DISABLED\".
To support the usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity, the NF service
consumer may subscribe with the TSCTSF to the notification of usage threshold
reached. The NF service consumer may also include the \"evSubsc\" attribute
with:
\- the usage thresholds to apply in the \"usgThres\" attribute; and
\- an entry of the \"events\" attribute set to \"USAGE_REPORT\".
The TSCTSF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause
5.3.2.2.2.
As result of this action, the TSCTSF shall provision the sponsored data
connectivity information to the PCF as described in 3GPP TS 29.514 [20].
The TSCTSF may send the following error responses based on the response to the
provisioning of sponsored data connectivity information received from the PCF,
as described in 3GPP TS 29.514 [20], as follows:
\- HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message with the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY\", when received from the PCF.
\- HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\", when received from the PCF.
5.3.2.2.8 Initial provisioning of AF requested QoS for a UE or group of UE(s)
not identified by UE address
When the \"GMEC\" feature is supported, if the NF service consumer includes in
the HTTP POST request message described in clause 5.3.2.2.2 the targeted UE
identified by its GPSI, within the \"ueId\" attribute, or the targeted group
of UE(s) identified by its External Group ID, within the \"externalGroupId\"
attribute, the provisions of clause 5.3.2.2.2 shall apply with the following
differences:
\- the AF request information may include:
a. the Temporal invalidity conditions, within the \"tempInValidity\"
attribute;
b. the traffic characteristics information, within the \"evSubsc\" attribute;
c. the QoS parameters for monitoring, within the \"tscQosReq\" attribute;
d. the QoS parameters, within either the \"qosReference\" attribute, the
\"altQosReferences\" attribute or the \"altQosReqs\" attribute; and/or
e. the flow description, within either the \"flowInfo\" attribute or the
\"enEthFlowInfo\" attribute.
The TSCTSF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause
5.3.2.2.2 with the following differences:
\- upon reception of the HTTP request from the NF service consumer, and if the
request is authorized, the TSCTSF shall:
\- create a new \"Individual TSC Application Session Context\" resource;
\- if the \"externalGroupId\" attribute is received from the NF service
consumer, interact with the UDM to retrieve the list of SUPI(s) identifying
the UE(s) constituting the targeted group of UE(s) using the Nudm_SDM service
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.503 [24];
\- if the \"ueId\" attribute is received from the NF service consumer,
interact with the UDM to retrieve the SUPI that corresponds to the targeted
GPSI using the Nudm_SDM service as defined in 3GPP TS 29.503 [24];
\- use the parameters received from the NF service consumer (i.e., DNN,
S-NSSAI and, if available, the identifier of the targeted UE or group of UE(s)
to determine the corresponding AF-session(s) (i.e., to which they macth); and
\- for each matching AF-session interact with the PCF by invoking the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create/Update service operation as defined in 3GPP TS
29.514 [20] to create/update the AF session based on the provided requested
QoS parameters; and
NOTE 1: If the PCF determines that an existing PDU Session is potentially
impacted by the time synchronization service (based on local configuration or
SM Policy Association), the PCF invokes Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify
service operation towards the TSCTSF as defined in clause 4.2.5.16 of 3GPP TS
29.514 [20] to send the received TSC User Plane Node information. The TSCTSF
then retrieves from the BSF the PCF binding information (including the UE
Identities for the notified PDU session), as specified in 3GPP TS 29.521 [23],
and can create the AF-session by invoking the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create
service operation towards the PCF.
\- the TSCTSF shall handle the AF session(s) associated with a given
\"Individual TSC Application Session Context\" resource as follows:
\- For the association of the AF session(s) at the PCF to the \"Individual TSC
Application Session Context\" resource:
a. Upon PDU Session establishment, i.e. when the TSCTSF receives a
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation following the establishment
of a new PDU session, the TSCTSF shall retrieve from the BSF, as specified in
3GPP TS 29.521 [23], the PCF binding information to complete the necessary AF-
Session information. The TSCTSF shall then trigger the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation towards the PCF to create an
AF-session to subscribe to TSC user plane node related events. The TSCTSF
shall use the parameters of the existing \"Individual TSC Application Session
Context\" resources to determine whether they shall be associated to this
newly created AF session. The TSCTSF associates the new AF session to the
\"Individual TSC Application Session Context\" resource to which these
parameters match.
b. Upon \"Individual TSC Application Session Context\" resource creation, the
TSCTSF uses the parameters of the created resource to determine which existing
AF session(s) it matches. The TSCTSF then associates the new \"Individual TSC
Application Session Context\" resource to the corresponding AF session(s).
\- To remove an AF session from the list of AF session(s) associated to an
\"Individual TSC Application Session Context\" resource, when the TSCTSF
receives the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation from the PCF
indicating the termination of the corresponding existing PDU session, the
TSCTSF triggers the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation towards
the PCF and determines if the corresponding AF session is associated with the
\"Individual TSC Application Session Context\" resource. If it is so, the
TSCTSF shall remove the AF session from the list of AF session(s) associated
with the \"Individual TSC Application Session Context\" resource.
NOTE 2: After the TSCTSF retrieves from the BSF the PCF binding information
(including the UE Identities for the notified PDU session), as specified in
3GPP TS 29.521 [23], the TSCTSF can store internally the information required
to invoke Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation and delay the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation (the creation of the AF
session) till a request is received for the concerned UE (time synchronization
capability exposure or QoS provisioning request). In this case, when the
TSCTSF receives the request, the TSCTSF interacts with the PCF by triggering
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation as defined in 3GPP TS 29.514
[20].
NOTE 3: When the TSCTSF receives the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service
operation indicating the termination of an existing PDU session associated to
an AF session that it is not associated with any \"Individual Time
Synchronization Exposure Subscription\" resource and \"Individual TSC
Application Session Context resource\" resource, the TSCTSF removes the AF-
session and triggers the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation
towards the PCF.
5.3.2.2.9 Subscription to BAT offset notification
When the \"EnTSCAC\" feature is supported, The NF service consumer shall use
the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type and shall include in the HTTP POST
request message an event entry within the \"evSubsc\" attribute with the
\"event\" attribute set to \"BAT_OFFSET_INFO\" to subscribe to receive a
notification when AF provides the Capability for BAT adaptation or BAT Window
as defined in clause 5.3.2.2.2.
The TSCTSF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause
5.3.2.2.2.
As result of this action, the TSCTSF shall set the appropriate subscription to
BAT offset notification as described in 3GPP TS 29.514 [20].
#### 5.3.2.3 Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Update
##### 5.3.2.3.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to request the
network to update the QoS and/or additional Alternative QoS for an AF session.
The following procedures using the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Update service
operation are supported:
\- Modification of TSC related service information.
\- Modification of Subscription to Service Data Flow QoS notification control.
\- Modification of Subscription to Service Data Flow Deactivation.
\- Modification of subscription to resources allocation outcome.
\- Modification of Subscription to Service Data Flow QoS Monitoring
Information.
\- Modification of sponsored connectivity information.
\- Modification of AF the requested QoS for a UE or a group of UE(s) not
identified by UE address.
\- Modification of subscription to BAT offset notification.
##### 5.3.2.3.2 Modification of TSC related service information
This procedure is used to modify an existing TSC application session context
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [19].
Figure 5.3.2.3.2-1 illustrates the modification of TSC related service
information using HTTP PATCH method.
Figure 5.3.2.3.2-1: Modification of TSC related service information using HTTP
PATCH
The NF service consumer may modify the TSC application session context
information at any time and invoke the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance_Update
service operation by sending the HTTP PATCH request message to the resource
URI representing the \"Individual TSC Application Session Context\" resource,
as shown in figure 5.3.2.3.2-1, step 1, with the modifications to apply.
The JSON body within the PATCH request shall include the
\"TscAppSessionContextUpdateData\" data type and shall be encoded according to
\"JSON Merge Patch\", as defined in IETF RFC 7396 [22].
The NF service consumer may include in the \"TscAppSessionContextUpdateData\"
data structure:

> to the \"USAGE_REPORT\" event), the additional information within the
> corresponding attribute(s).
NOTE 2: Note that when the NF service consumer requests to remove an event,
this event is not included in the \"events\" attribute.
NOTE 3: When an event is included in the \"events\" attribute and its related
additional information is set to null, the TSCTSF considers the subscription
to this event is active, but the related procedures stop applying.
NOTE 4: When an event is removed from the \"events\" attribute but its related
information is not set to null, the TSCTSF considers the subscription to this
event is terminated, the related additional information is removed, and the
related procedures stop applying.
The NF service consumer shall remove existing event subscription information
by setting to null the \"evSubsc\" attribute included in
\"TscAppSessionContextUpdateData\".
NOTE 5: The \"notifUri\" attribute within the EventsSubscReqData data
structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are sent to
a new NF service consumer.
Upon the reception of this HTTP PATCH request, the TSCTSF shall

#### 5.4.2.2 Ntsctsf_ASTI_Create
##### 5.4.2.2.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to create a 5G access
stratum time distribution configuration.
The following procedures using the Ntsctsf_ASTI_Create service operation are
supported:
\- creating a new configuration.
##### 5.4.2.2.2 Creating a new configuration
Figure 5.4.2.2.2-1 illustrates the creation of a configuration.
Figure 5.4.2.2.2-1: Creation of a configuration
To create a configuration, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP POST
message to the TSCTSF to the URI \"{apiRoot}/ntsctsf-
asti/\/configurations\". The HTTP POST message shall include the
AccessTimeDistributionData data structure as request body, as shown in figure
5.4.2.2.2-1, step 1. The AccessTimeDistributionData data structure shall
include:
\- one of the indication of the UEs to which the 5G access stratum time
distribution configuration is requested via:
\- identification of a list of individual UEs within the \"supis\" attribute;
or
\- identification of a group of UE(s) within the \"interGrpId\" attribute;
\- identification of a list of individual UEs within the \"gpsis\" attribute;
\- identification of a group of UE(s) within the \"exterGrpId\" attribute; and
\- 5G access stratum time distribution parameters within the
\"asTimeDisParam\" attribute.
Within the \"asTimeDisParam\" attribute inside the AccessTimeDistributionData
data structure, the NF service consumer:
\- shall include the \"asTimeDisEnabled\" attribute set to true if the access
stratum time distribution via Uu reference point should be activated
(otherwise, if the access stratum time distribution via Uu reference point
should be inactive, the \"asTimeDisEnabled\" attribute may either be omitted
or included and set to \"false\");
\- may include the time synchronization error budget within the
\"timeSyncErrBdgt\" attribute;
\- may include the temporal validity condition within the \"tempValidity\"
attribute.
When the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported, the
AccessTimeDistributionData data structure may include the time
synchorinization coverage area encoded as \"covReq\" attribute, that contains
a list of Tracking Area codes per serving network where the provided access
stratum time distribution data applies.
When the \"ASTIConfigReport\" feature is supported, to receive notifications
about changes in the 5G access stratum time distribution configuration, the NF
service consumer shall also provide the notification URI within the
\"astiNotifUri\" attribute and the notification correlation Id within the
\"astiNotifId\" attribute; and/or, when the \"NetTimeSyncStatus\" feature is
supported, to request the notification of the access stratum time distribution
status information, the NF service consumer shall also provide the clock
quality detail level in the \"clkQltDetLvl\" attribute and optionally the
clock quality accpetance criteria in the \"clkQltAcptCri\" attribute if
applicable.
Upon receipt of the HTTP request from the NF service consumer, if the request
is authorized, the TSCTSF shall:
\- if the 5G access stratum time distribution configuration applies to an
internal group of UEs indicated in the \"interGrpId\" attribute or to an
external group of UEs indicated in the \"exterGrpId\" attribute, interact with
the UDM to retrieve the list of individual UEs that belong to the group using
the Nudm_SDM service as defined in 3GPP TS 29.503 [24];
\- if the 5G access stratum time distribution configuration applies to a list
of individual UEs within the \"gpsis\" attribute, interact with the UDM to
retrieve the SUPI(s) that corresponds to each of the GPSI(s) using the
Nudm_SDM service as defined in 3GPP TS 29.503 [24];
\- The TSCTSF retrieves the UE\'s Time Synchronization Subscription data from
the UDM for each individual UE. If the UE\'s Time Synchronization Subscription
data contains the authorized Uu time synchronization error budget, and the
requested time synchronization error budget within the \"timeSyncErrBdgt\"
attribute is within the authorized time synchronization error budget, the
TSCTSF determines that the UE is authorized for the requested time
synchronization service.
\- if the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported and a time
synchronization coverage area is provided within the \"covReq\" attribute,
perform the following operations:
a. if the Authorized Time Synchronization Coverage Area is inside of the
requested Coverage Area, the TSCTSF uses the Authorized Time Synchronization
Coverage Area. If the requested Coverage Area partly overlaps with the
Authorized Time Synchronization Coverage Area, the TSCTSF uses the
intersection of them. If there is no overlap between them, the TSCTSF shall
reject the AF request as described in clause 5.27.1.11 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
b. the TSCTSF shall discover the list of AMF(s) serving the list of TA(s) that
comprise the time synchronization coverage area using the Nnrf_NFDiscovery
service operation as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [10], if they were not
previously retrieved, and:
c. subscribe with the discovered AMF(s):
1\. for each UE, e.g. when the 5G access stratum time distribution
configuration applies to a list of individual UEs, and the UE time
synchronization coverage area within the \"covReq\" attribute is within the
authorized time synchronization coverage area; or
2\. for the group of UEs, when the 5G access stratum time distribution
configuration applies to a group of UEs.
To receive notifications about presence of the UE in an Area of Interest
events using the Namf_EventExposure service as described in 3GPP TS 29.518
[27], where the Area of Interest is the provided time synchronization coverage
area.
d. Based on the outcome provided by the AMF about the UE's presence in the
Area of Interest and the authorized time synchronization coverage area, the
TSCTSF shall determine if the 5G access stratum time distribution
configuration is enabled for the UE:
i. If the UE presence is within any of the TAs from the authorized time
synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines that the time
synchronization coverage area condition is fulfilled, and the provided 5G
access stratum time distribution configuration is enabled for the UE.
ii. If the UE presence is not within any of the TAs from the time
synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines that the time
synchronization coveragae area condition is not fulfilled, and the provided 5G
access stratum time distribution configuration is not enabled for the UE.
\- The TSCTSF retrieves the UE\'s Time Synchronization Subscription data from
the UDM for each individual UE. If the UE\'s Time Synchronization Subscription
data contains the periods of authorized start and stop times, and the
requested temporal validity condition within the \"tempValidity\" attribute is
within any of the authorized periods of authorized start and stop times, the
TSCTSF determines that the UE is authorized for the requested time
synchronization service.
\- for each authorized UE, subscribe to event notifications of newly
registered PCF for the UE by invoking Nbsf_Management_Subscribe Service
Operation as defined in 3GPP TS 29.521 [23], if not yet subscribed;
\- for each authorized UE, if the access stratum time distribution via Uu
reference point is being activated (i.e. the \"asTimeDisEnabled\" attribute
within the \"asTimeDisParam\" attribute was received and set to true),
calculate the Uu time synchronization error budget as specified in clauses
5.27.1.9 and 5.27.1.11 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2];
\- for each authorized UE, interact with the PCF for a UE to provide the
configuration information for each target UE using the
Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Create service operation as defined in 3GPP TS
29.534 [14];
\- create a new resource, which represents a new \"Individual ASTI
Configuration\" resource, addressed by a URI as defined in clause 6.1.3.7 and
containing a TSCTSF created resource identifier; and
\- send an HTTP \"201 Created\" response with AccessTimeDistributionData data
structure as response body and a Location header field containing the URI of
the created Individual ASTI Configuration resource, i.e. \"{apiRoot}/ntsctsf-
asti/\/configurations/{configId}\", as shown in figure
5.4.2.2.2-1, step 2.
If for all the affected UEs the provided parameters are not allowed by
subscription, the TSCTSF shall indicate in an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response
message the \"cause\" attribute set to \"UE_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\".
If the TSCTSF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to
the internal TSCTSF error or due to the error in the HTTP POST request, the
TSCTSF shall send the HTTP error response as specified in clause 6.3.7.
#### 5.4.2.3 Ntsctsf_ASTI_Update
##### 5.4.2.3.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to update a 5G access
stratum time distribution configuration.
The following procedures using the Ntsctsf_ASTI_Update service operation are

##### 5.4.2.3.2 Updating an existing configuration
Figure 5.4.2.3.2-1 illustrates the updating of an existing configuration.
Figure 5.4.2.3.2-1: Update of a configuration
To update a configuration, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT
request to the resource \"{apiRoot}/ntsctsf-
asti/\/configurations/{configId}\" representing an existing
\"Individual ASTI Configuration\" resource, as shown in figure 5.4.2.3.2-1,
step 1, to modify the configuration.
The AccessTimeDistributionData data structure provided in the request body
shall include an updated representation of the \"Individual ASTI
Configuration\" resource with the updated 5G access stratum time distribution
configuration information as defined in clause 5.4.2.2.2.
When the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported, the
AccessTimeDistributionData data structure may include the time synchronization
coverage area encoded as \"covReq\" attribute, that may contain an updated
list of Tracking Area codes per serving network where the provided access
stratum time distribution data applies.
When the \"ASTIConfigReport\" feature is supported, to receive notifications
about changes in the 5G access stratum time distribution configuration, the NF
service consumer shall also provide the notification URI within the
\"astiNotifUri\" attribute and the notification correlation Id within the
\"astiNotifId\" attribute; and/or, when the \"NetTimeSyncStatus\" feature is
supported, to update the existing event subscription information, the NF
service consumer may also provide the clock quality detail level in the
\"clkQltDetLvl\" attribute and optionally the clock quality accpetance
criteria in the \"clkQltAcptCri\" attribute if applicable.
Upon receipt of the corresponding HTTP PUT message, if the request is
authorized, theTSCTSF shall:
\- If the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported and an updated time
synchronization coverage area is provided within the \"covReq\" attribute:
i. discover the list of AMF(s) serving the list of TA(s) that comprise the
time synchronization coverage area using the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service
operation as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [10], if they were not previously
retrieved, and:
ii. update the subscription with the discovered AMF(s), if applicable:
a. for each affected UE, e.g. when the 5G access stratum time distribution
configuration applies to a list of individual UEs and the UE time
synchronization coverage area within the \"covReq\" attribute is within the
subscribed time synchronization coverage area; or
b. for the group of UEs, when the 5G access stratum time distribution
configuration applies to a group of UEs.
to receive notifications about presence of the UE in an Area of Interest
events using the Namf_EventExposure service as described in 3GPP TS 29.518
[27], where the Area of Interest is the provided time synchronization coverage
area.
iii. Based on the outcome provided by the AMF or the local available
information about the UE's presence in the Area of Interest and the authorized
time synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF shall determine if the 5G
access stratum time distribution configuration is enabled for the UE:
i. If the UE presence is within any of the TAs from the authorized time
synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines that the time
synchronization coverage area condition is fulfilled, and the provided 5G
access stratum time distribution configuration is enabled for the UE.
ii. If the UE presence is not within any of the TAs from the authorized time
synchronization coverage area, the TSCTSF determines that the time
synchronization coverage area condition is not fulfilled, and the provided 5G
access stratum time distribution configuration is not enabled for the UE.
\- if the \"CoverageAreaSupport\" feature is supported and a time
synchronization coverage area previously provided is removed:
1\. terminate the related subscriptions to notifications about presence of the
UE in an Area of Interest events using the Namf_EventExposure service as
described in 3GPP TS 29.518 [27].
2\. for each UE that did not fulfil the removed time synchronization coverage
area, authorize the UE for the 5GS access stratum time distribution
configuration.
\- if the time synchronization error budget within the \"timeSyncErrBdgt\"
attribute and/or the temporal validity condition within the \"tempValidity\"
attribute from the NF service consumer is provided, updated, or removed, the
TSCTSF based on the Time Synchronization Subscription data retrieved from the
UDM determines whether the UE is authorized for the request again as described
in clause 5.4.2.2.2.
\- for each authorized UE, if the access stratum time distribution via Uu
reference point is being activated (i.e. the \"asTimeDisEnabled\" attribute
within the \"asTimeDisParam\" attribute was received and set to true) or a
time synchronization error budget for an active access stratum time
distribution is provided or updated by the AF, calculate the Uu time
synchronization error budget as specified in clause 5.27.1.9 of 3GPP TS 23.501
[2];
\- for each authorized UE, interact with the PCF for a UE to provide the
updated configuration information using the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Update
service operation as defined in 3GPP TS 29.534 [14]; and
\- update the existing \"Individual ASTI Configuration\" resource. Then the
TSCTSF shall send a HTTP response including \"200 OK\" status code with
AccessTimeDistributionData data structure or \"204 No Content\" status code,
as shown in figure 5.4.2.3.2-1, step 2.
If for all the affected UEs the provided parameters are not allowed by
subscription, the TSCTSF shall indicate in an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response
message the \"cause\" attribute set to \"UE_SERIVCE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\".
If the TSCTSF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP PUT request due to
the internal TSCTSF error or due to the error in the HTTP PUT request, the
TSCTSF shall send the HTTP error response as specified in clause 6.3.7.
If the TSCTSF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected,
the TSCTSF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 5.4.2.4 Ntsctsf_ASTI_Delete

Figure 5.4.2.5.2-1: Retrieval of the status of access stratum time
distribution
To retrieve the status of access stratum time distribution, the NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the resource \"{apiRoot}/ntsctsf-
asti/\/configurations/retrieve\". The HTTP POST message shall
include the StatusRequestData data structure as request body, as shown in
figure 5.4.2.5.2-1, step 1. The StatusRequestData data structure shall
include:
\- identification of a list of individual UEs within the \"supis\" attribute;
or
\- identification of a list of individual UEs within the \"gpsis\" attribute;
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request and if the HTTP POST request is
accepted by the TSCTSF, the TSCTSF determines the status of the access stratum
time distribution is active for a UE if there is a 5G access stratum time
distribution configuration applicable to the UE, i.e., it applies according to
the temporal validity, if present, and the access time distribution via Uu
reference point is activated; otherwise, the status of the access stratum time
distribution is inactive for the UE.
The TSCTSF shall send an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the StatusResponseData
data structure as response body, as shown in figure 5.4.2.5.2-1, step 2 to
notify of the status.
Within the StatusResponseData data structure, TSCTSF may include:
\- a list of SUPI(s) whose status of the access stratum time distribution is
inactive within the \"inactiveUes\" attribute or a list of GPSI(s) whose
status of the access stratum time distribution is inactive within the
\"inactiveGpsis\" attribute;
\- the \"activeUes\" attribute containing one or more the ActiveUe instances
which includes the UE identifier whose status of the access stratum time
distribution is active within the \"supi\" attribute or \"gpsi\" attribute and
the requested time synchronization error budget, if available, within the
\"timeSyncErrBdgt\" attribute.
If the TSCTSF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to
the internal TSCTSF error or due to the error in the HTTP POST request, the
TSCTSF shall send the HTTP error response as specified in clause 6.3.7.
#### 5.4.2.6 Ntsctsf_ASTI_UpdateNotify

event
The TSCTSF shall invoke the Ntsctsf_ASTI_UpdateNotify to report a 5G access
stratum time distribution event by sending an HTTP POST request (as shown in
figure 5.4.2.6.2-1, step 1) to the NF service consumer using as request URI
the notification URI received in the creation (as specified in clause
5.4.2.2.2) or modification (as specified in clause 5.4.2.3.2) of the
Individual ASTI Configuration resource, and the AstiConfigNotification data
structure as request body.
The AstiConfigNotification data structure shall include:
\- the notification correlation ID provided by the NF service consumer during
the provisioning of 5G access stratum time distribution configuration within
the \"astiNotifId\" attribute;
\- the update of the 5G access stratum configuration for the indicated UE(s)
within the \"stateOfAstiConfigs\" attribute.
Editor's note: It is FFS the parameters the AstiConfigNotification data type
sent within the Ntsctsf_ASTI_UpdateNotify service operation may include. E.g.,
an event indicating the notification reason (e.g time synch coverage area
outcome, time synch status update), the affected UE(s), etc.
If the HTTP POST request from the TSCTSF is not accepted, the NF service
consumer shall indicate in the response to HTTP POST request the cause for the
rejection as specified in clause 6.3.7.
If the HTTP POST request from the TSCTSF is accepted, the NF service consumer
shall acknowledge the receipt of the event notification with a \"204 No
Content\" response, as shown in figure 5.4.2.6.2-1, step 2.
If the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to
be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as
specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
##### 5.4.2.6.3 Notification about the change of state of 5G access stratum
time distribution configuration
If the TSCTSF received time synchronization coverage area as part of the
Ntsctsf_ASTI_Create/Update service operation as described in clauses 5.4.2.2.2
and 5.4.2.3.2, when the TSCTSF receives a change in the UE presence in Area of
Interest notification as described in 3GPP TS 29.518 [27], the TSCTSF shall
determine if the re-evaluation of the time synchronization coverage area shall
trigger an activation or deactivation of the access stratum time distribution:
\- If the notification of change of UE presence in Area of Interest indicates
that the UE is within any TAs from the time synchronization coverage area,
then the TSCTSF shall enable access stratum time distribution for the UE. The
TSCTSF shall provide the 5G access stratum time distribution configuration to
the UE using the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Create service operation as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.534 [14].
\- If the notification of change of UE presence in Area of Interest indicates
that the UE is not within any TAs from the time synchronization coverage area,
then the TSCTSF shall disable access stratum time distribution for the UE. The
TSCTSF shall disable the 5G access stratum time distribution to the UE using
the Npcf_AMPolicyAuthorization_Update service operation as defined in 3GPP TS
29.534 [14].
The TSCTSF shall invoke the Ntsctsf_ASTI_UpdateNotify to report the change of
5G access stratum time distribution configuration as specified in clause

### 6.1.7 Error Handling
#### 6.1.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [5].
For the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization API, HTTP error responses shall be
supported as specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors
and application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]
shall be supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes
are specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization API.
#### 6.1.7.2 Protocol Errors
No specific procedures for the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization service are
specified.
#### 6.1.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization service are
listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1.
Table 6.1.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
UE_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED 403 Forbidden The requested service for the target
UE is not authorized.
### 6.1.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 6.1.8-1 are defined for the
Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization API. They shall be negotiated using the
extensibility mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.1.8-1: Supported Features
Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
1 CoverageAreaSupport Indicates the support of spatial validity conditions for
the activation/deactivation of the time synchronization service. 2
NetTimeSyncStatus Indicates the time synchronization service status.
### 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2
protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510
[10]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization service.
The Ntsctsf_TimeSynchronization API defines a single scope \"ntsctsf-time-
sync\" for the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
## 6.2 Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance Service API
### 6.2.1 Introduction
The Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance service shall use the
Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance API.
The API URI of the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards
the NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in
clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [4], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"ntsctsf-qos-tscai\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.2.3.
### 6.2.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.2.2.1 General
HTTP/2, IETF RFC 7540 [11], shall be used as specified in clause 5 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
The OpenAPI [6] specification of HTTP messages and content bodies for the
Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance API is contained in Annex A.
#### 6.2.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.2.2.2.1 General
See clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] for the usage of HTTP standard headers.
##### 6.2.2.2.2 Content type
JSON, IETF RFC 8259 [12], shall be used as content type of the HTTP bodies
specified in the present specification as specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4]. The use of the JSON format shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
JSON object used in the HTTP PATCH request shall be encoded according to
\"JSON Merge Patch\" and shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/merge-patch+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7396 [22].
\"Problem Details\" JSON object shall be used to indicate additional details
of the error in a HTTP response body and shall be signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 [13].
#### 6.2.2.3 HTTP custom headers
The mandatory HTTP custom header fields specified in clause 5.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4] shall be supported, and the optional HTTP custom header fields
specified in clause 5.2.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] may be supported.
In this Release of the specification, no specific custom headers are defined
for the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance API.
### 6.2.3 Resources

### 6.2.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2
protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510
[10]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance service.
The Ntsctsf_QoSandTSCAssistance API defines a single scope \"ntsctsf-qos-
tscai\" for the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes
at resource or operation level.
## 6.3 Ntsctsf_ASTI Service API
### 6.3.1 Introduction
The Ntsctsf_ASTI service shall use the Ntsctsf_ASTI API.
The API URI of the Ntsctsf_ASTI API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards
the NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in
clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"ntsctsf-asti\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.3.3.
### 6.3.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.3.2.1 General
HTTP/2, IETF RFC 7540 [11], shall be used as specified in clause 5 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
The OpenAPI [6] specification of HTTP messages and content bodies for the
Ntsctsf_ASTI API is contained in Annex A.
#### 6.3.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.3.2.2.1 General
See clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] for the usage of HTTP standard headers.

JSON, IETF RFC 8259 [12], shall be used as content type of the HTTP bodies
specified in the present specification as specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4]. The use of the JSON format shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
\"Problem Details\" JSON object shall be used to indicate additional details
of the error in a HTTP response body and shall be signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 [13].
#### 6.3.2.3 HTTP custom headers
The mandatory HTTP custom header fields specified in clause 5.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4] shall be supported, and the optional HTTP custom header fields
specified in clause 5.2.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] may be supported.

### 6.3.7 Error Handling
#### 6.3.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [5].
For the Ntsctsf_ASTI API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as specified
in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors and application errors
specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] shall be supported for an
HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as mandatory
for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Ntsctsf_ASTI API.
#### 6.3.7.2 Protocol Errors
No specific procedures for the Ntsctsf_ASTI service are specified.
#### 6.3.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Ntsctsf_ASTI service are listed in
Table 6.3.7.3-1.
Table 6.3.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
UE_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED 403 Forbidden The request service for the target UE
is not authorized.
### 6.3.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 6.3.8-1 are defined for the Ntsctsf_ASTI API.
They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in clause
6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.3.8-1: Supported Features
+----------------+---------------------+-----------------------------+ | Feature number | Feature Name | Description | +================+=====================+=============================+ | 1 | CoverageAreaSupport | Indicates the support of | | | | time synchronization | | | | coverage area conditions | | | | for the | | | | activation/deactivation of | | | | the time synchronization | | | | service. | | | | | | | | It requires the support of | | | | ASTIConfigReport feature. | +----------------+---------------------+-----------------------------+ | 2 | ASTIConfigReport | Indicates the support of | | | | the report of ASTI service | | | | status information and/or | | | | ASTI configuration changes. | +----------------+---------------------+-----------------------------+ | 3 | NetTimeSyncStatus | Indicates the time | | | | synchronization service | | | | status | +----------------+---------------------+-----------------------------+
### 6.3.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Ntsctsf_ASTI API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF
RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [10]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Ntsctsf_ASTI API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS
29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Ntsctsf_ASTI service.
The Ntsctsf_ASTI API defines a single scope \"ntsctsf-asti\" for the entire
service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation
level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the
present specification. It consists of OpenAPI specifications in YAML format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE 1: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1
and 3GPP TR 21.900 [7] clause 5B).

###### ## Annex B (normative): 3GPP extensions for DetNet integration with 5GS
# B.1 3GPP extensions for DetNet integration with 5GS
## B.1.1 Introduction
The 5G System is integrated with the Deterministic Networking as defined in
IETF RFC 8655[63] as a logical DetNet transit node as specified in 3GPP TS
23.501 [2], clause 4.4.8.4.
The support of deterministic networking is achieved by reusing the TSC
framework for deterministic QoS and time synchronization services. To enable
deterministic networking in 5GS, the DetNet controller collects interface
information from the 5GS DetNet node via the TSCTSF using the 5GS DetNet node
information reporting procedure described in clause 5.5.12.2 of 3GPP TS 23.513
[31] and provides DetNet Yang configurations for DetNet flow(s) as described
in clause 5.5.12.3 of 3GPP TS 23.513 [31].
The TSCTSF offers to the DetNet controller RESTCONF (IETF RFC 8040 [30])
and/or NETCONF (IETF RFC 6241 [29]) interfaces and the data schema defined by
the 3GPP Extended Deterministic Networking (DetNet) YANG model. The 3GPP
Extended DetNet YANG model is based on the DetNet YANG model specified in IETF
draft-ietf-detnet-yang [28] and extended by 3GPP Extensions described in table
B.1.1-1.
The 3GPP Extended DetNet YANG Model offered by the TSCTSF is accessed by the
DetNet controller as shown in figure B.1.1-1
Figure B.1.1-1: Representation of the access to 3GPP Extended DetNet YANG
Model.
Table B.1.1-1 summarizes the 3GPP extensions to the DetNet YANG model defined
in this specification.

information and the provisioning and configuration of data for the DetNet
flows. 3gpp-5gs-detnet-node.yang 3gpp-5gs-detnet-node C.2
## B.1.2 3GPP Extension 3gpp-5gs-detnet-node
### B.1.2.1 Description
Deterministic Networking parameter provisioning allows a DetNet controller to
configure deterministic networking parameters in 5GS and provide time-
sensitive features that guarantee almost zero packet loss rates and bounded
latency.
The DetNet controller communicates with the 5GS system through the TSCTSF as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 [31] to collect 5GS DetNet node interface
information and to provide DetNet flow-related parameters to configure the
DetNet traffic in 5GS.
The TSCTSF may receive DetNet YANG configuration for DetNet flows as described
in IETF draft-ietf-detnet-yang [28], that describes the traffic
characteristics and QoS requirements for the DetNet flows. Additionally, when
both, the TSCTSF and the DetNet controller support the 3GPP Extension
3gpp-5gs-detnet-node, the configuration of the DetNet traffic in 5GS also
enable that:
\- The DetNet controller may provide the maximum latency and/or maximum loss
requirements the 5GS system needs to apply, as specified in clause B.1.2.2.
\- The TSCTSF may provide to the DetNet controller 5GS specific status code
information on the status of the configuration requested by the DetNet
controller for the DetNet flow(s), as specified in clause B.1.2.3.
To enable the DetNet controller builds up network topology information, the
5GS DetNet node exposes interface information to the DetNet controller through
the TSCTSF. When both, the TSCTSF and the DetNet controller support the 3GPP
Extension 3gpp-5gs-detnet-node, the TSCTSF may provide to the DetNet
controller 5GS DetNet node identification as specified in clause B.1.2.4.
### B.1.2.2 Provisioning of 5GS specific traffic characteristics and
requirements
When both, the DetNet controller and the TSCTSF support the 3GPP Extension
3gpp-5gs-detnet-node, the DetNet controller may provide the following 5GS
specific traffic characteristics and requirements within the \"5gs-node-
requirements\" YANG container:
\- the maximum latency from 5GS node ingress to 5GS node egress(es) of a
DetNet flow by providing the \"5gs-node-max-latency\" attribute; and/or
\- the maximum packet loss ratio parameter for the DetNet service between the
5G node ingress and the 5GS node egress(es) by providing the \"5gs-node-max-
latency\" attribute; and
\- a reference to the DetNet flow identification within the \"forwarding-sub-
layer\" attribute.
When the DetNet controller does not provide the \"5gs-node-max-latency\"
attribute and/or the \"5gs-node-max-latency\" attribute but instead provides
the IETF draft-ietf-detnet-yang [28] \"Max-latency\" and/or \"Max-loss\"
attributes for the end-to-end flow, the TSCTSF may determine the corresponding
maximum latency and/or maximum packet loss values based on a preconfigured
mapping and applicable to the 5GS specific deployment.
NOTE: If the DetNet controller does not include the 5GS specific \"5gs-node-
max-latency\" nor the end-to-end \"Max-latency\", the TSCTSF can derive the
Requested 5GS Delay or, alternatively, the PCF can derive the PDB. Similarly,
if the DetNet YANG configuration does not include the 5GS specific \"5gs-node-
max-loss\" nor the end-to-end \"Max-loss\", the TSCTSF can derive the
Requested Packet Error Rate or, alternatively, the PCF can derive the PER.
### B.1.2.3 Report of 5GS DetNet flow(s) status
The DetNet controller may be informed about the following 5GS specific events
about status change of the configured DetNet flows:
\- Notification about DetNet flow(s) deactivation in 5GS node. To notify the
DetNet controller about DetNet flow deactivation in 5GS, the TSCTSF shall
subscribe with the PCF to service data flow deactivation as specified in 3GPP
TS 29.514 [20].
\- Notification about resource allocation outcome in 5GS node. The TSCTSF
shall subscribe with the PCF to notifications about the unsuccessful resource
allocation outcome as specified in 3GPP TS 29.514 [20].
\- Notification about PDU session release.
When the TSCTSF receives from the PCF the notification about service data flow
deactivation, or the notification about unsuccessful resource allocation, or
the notification about PDU session release and both, the DetNet controller and
the TSCTSF support the 3GPP Extension 3gpp-5gs-detnet-node, the TSCTSF shall
notify the DetNet controller about the failed resources allocation in the 5G
System by including the 3GPP 5GS specific failure reason \"5gs-node-resource-
allocation-failure\".
When the TSCTSF or the DetNet controller do not support the 3GPP Extension
3gpp-5gs-detnet-node, the TSCTSF provides an IETF draft-ietf-detnet-yang [28]
defined failure-reason, e.g. \"resource-unavailable\".
Editor\'s note: Whether other elements of the detnet-failure-notification
(e.g. failure-type) need to be extended to report about 5GS node status per
DetNet flow is FFS.
### B.1.2.4 Exposure of 5GS DetNet Node Identification
The TSCTSF collects 5GS DetNet node interface information from the NW-TT/UPF
using Time Synchronization procedures as described in 3GPP TS 29.513[31]. When
both, the TSCTSF and the DetNet controller support the 3GPP Extension
3gpp-5gs-detnet-node, the TSCTSF may provide to the DetNet controller 5GS
DetNet node identification.
During PDU session establishment, i.e., when the TSCTSF receives the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation defined in clause 4.2.5.16
of 3GPP TS 29.514 [20], the TSCTSF may use the received user-plane node Id to
generate an identifier of the 5GS DetNet node and provide it to the DetNet
controller within the \"5GS-node-id\" attribute.
Editor\'s note: The extension definition to report about the 5GS DetNet node
identification is FFS.
# B.2 YANG Module Definitions
## B.2.1 Introduction
### B.2.1.1 General
As specified in IETF RFC 7590 [33], a YANG model is defined in a YANG module
and is stored in a file with file extension \".yang\". An extension to an
existing YANG model is done via the definition of a new YANG module that
contains the definitions of the new components.
A YANG module typically has the following layout:
> module \ {
>
> // header information
>
> \
>
> \
>
> \
>
> // linkage statements
>
> \
>
> \
>
> // meta-information
>
> \
>
> \
>
> \
>
> \
>
> // revision history
>
> \
>
> // module definitions
>
> \
>
> }
The YANG module with the 3GPP extensions for the DetNet YANG model shall
follow the YANG model layout defined in clause 7.1 of IETF RFC 7590 [33] and
represented above, where the linkage and module definitions statements contain
the definition of the new components that represent the 5GS specifics.

name as specified in section 5.2 of IETF RFC 6020 [35].
\- The YANG data nodes (leaf, leaf-list, container, list) shall be used for
data modelling of the new YANG components.
\- The style used for the specification of the YANG module shall be \"PL\"
(Programming Language).
\- Comments may be added by following the standard YANG 1.1 syntax (\"//\" or
\"/*\" and \"*/\").
\- Tabs shall not be used (e.g. within description fields).
\- \"Unbreakable\" spaces (UTF-8 \'NO-BREAK SPACE\' (U+00A0)) shall not be
used (e.g. within description fields). Only \"normal\" spaces (UTF-8 \'SPACE\'
(U+0020)) shall be allowed.
\- Trailing spaces (i.e. white spaces at the end of a line) should not be
used.
