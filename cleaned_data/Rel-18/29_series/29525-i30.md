# 4 UE Policy Control Service
## 4.1 Service Description
### 4.1.1 Overview
The UE Policy Control Service, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS
23.503 [4], is provided by the Policy Control Function (PCF).
This service is used as part of the provisioning of UE policies (e.g. ANDSP,
URSP, V2XP, A2XP, ProSeP) determined by the PCF to the UE via the AMF and as
part of the provisioning of N2 PC5 policy for V2X communications and/or A2X
communications and/or 5G ProSe determined by the PCF to the NG-RAN via the
AMF. In case of URSP provisioning in EPS this service may be used as part of
the provisioning of URSP determined by the PCF to the UE via a PCF for a PDU
session. This service hence offers the following functionalities:
\- creation of a UE Policy Association as requested by the NF service consumer
(e.g. AMF);
\- provisioning of policy control request trigger(s) to the NF service
consumer (e.g. AMF);
\- provisioning of the UE policy (e.g. ANDSP, URSP, V2XP, A2XP,ProSeP) to the
V-PCF by the H-PCF in the roaming case;
\- provisioning of the N2 PC5 policy for V2X communications and/or and/or A2X
communications 5G ProSe to the V-PCF by the H-PCF in the roaming case;
\- update of a UE Policy Association as requested by the NF service consumer
(e.g. AMF);
\- reporting of the met policy control request trigger(s) by the NF service
consumer;
\- update of policy control request trigger(s) by the PCF to the NF service
consumer (e.g. AMF);
\- deletion of a UE Policy Association as requested by the NF service consumer
(e.g. AMF);
\- enable the PCF to request the termination of a UE Policy Association to the
NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) ; and
> \- provisioning of the URSP to a PCF for a PDU session in case of URSP
> provisioning in EPS.
>
> \- support of N3IWF/TNGF selection based on the UE requested NSSAI.
### 4.1.2 Service Architecture
The 5G System Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The Policy and
Charging related 5G architecture is also described in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7].
The UE Policy Control Service (Npcf_UEPolicyControl) is part of the Npcf
service-based interface exhibited by the Policy Control Function (PCF).
The known NF service consumers of the Npcf_UEPolicyControl service are the
Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) and the Visited Policy Control
Function (V-PCF).
The AMF accesses the UE Policy Control Service at the PCF via the N15
reference point. In case of URSP delivery in EPS, when the PCF for the PDU
session and the PCF for the UE are different, the PCF for the PDU session
accesses the UE Policy Control Service at the PCF via the N43 reference point,
In the roaming scenario, the N15 reference point is located between the V-PCF
in the visited network and the AMF. The V-PCF accesses the UE Policy Control
Service at the Home Policy Control Function (H-PCF) via the N24 Reference
point.
Figure 4.1.2-1: Reference Architecture for the Npcf_UEPolicyControl Service;
SBI representation
Figure 4.1.2-2: Non-roaming Reference Architecture for the
Npcf_UEPolicyControlService; reference point representation
NOTE 1: When the N43 reference point exists, i.e. when the PCF is a NF service
consumer of the Npcf_UEPolicyControl service, the PCF for the PDU session
interacts with the PCF for the UE, and the non-roaming and home routed roaming
architecture are the same.
Figure 4.1.3-2: Roaming reference Architecture for the
Npcf_UEPolicyControlService; reference point representation
NOTE 2: In LBO roaming scenarios, the V-PCF for the PDU session interacts with
the V-PCF for the UE (i.e., the V-PCF for the PDU session is a NF service
consumer of the Npcf_UEPolicyControl service offered by the V-PCF of the UE).
### 4.1.3 Network Functions
#### 4.1.3.1 Policy Control Function (PCF)
For non-roaming scenarios, the Policy Control Function (PCF):
\- supports unified policy framework to govern network behaviour;
\- provides UE policy, including Access Network Discovery and Selection Policy
(ANDSP), UE Route Selection Policy (URSP), Vehicle-to-Everything Policy
(V2XP), Aircraft-to-Everything Policy (A2XP) and/or 5G ProSe Policy (ProSeP)
via the AMF transparently to the UE;
\- provides policy control request trigger(s) to the AMF;
NOTE 1: The PCF invokes the Namf_Communication service specified in 3GPP TS
29.518 [14] to provide the UE Policy.
\- provides N2 PC5 policy, containing the PC5 QoS parameters used by NG-RAN
for V2X communications and/or A2X communications and/or 5G ProSe via the AMF
to the NG-RAN;
NOTE 2: The PCF invokes the Namf_Communication service specified in 3GPP TS
29.518 [14] to provide the N2 PC5 Policy for V2X communications and/or A2X
communications and/or 5G ProSe.
\- provides URSP via a PCF for a PDU session transparently to the UE in case
of URSP provisioning in EPS; and
> \- provides policy control request trigger(s) to a PCF for a PDU session in
> case of URSP provisioning in EPS.
\- support of N3IWF/TNGF selection based on the UE requested NSSAI.
For roaming scenarios, the Visited Policy Control Function (V-PCF):
\- provides policy control request trigger(s) to the AMF;
\- provides the ANDSP of the VPLMN via the AMF transparently to the UE;
\- forwards the ANDSP, URSP, V2XP, A2XP and/or ProSeP received from the H-PCF
via the AMF to the UE;
NOTE 3: The V-PCF invokes the Namf_Communication service specified in 3GPP TS
29.518 [14] to provide the UE Policy.
\- forwards the N2 PC5 policy for V2X communications and/or and/or A2X
communications 5G ProSe received from the H-PCF via the AMF to the NG-RAN;
NOTE 4: The V-PCF invokes the Namf_Communication service specified in 3GPP TS
29.518 [14] to provide the N2 PC5 Policy for V2X communications and/or and/or
A2X communications 5G ProSe.
\- for the LBO roaming scenarios, provides policy control request trigger(s)
to a V-PCF for a PDU session in case of URSP provisioning in EPS; and
\- for the LBO roaming scenarios, forwards the URSP received from the H-PCF
via a V-PCF for a PDU session to the UE in case of URSP provisioning in EPS.
For roaming scenarios, the Home Policy Control Function (H-PCF):
\- provides policy control request trigger(s) to the V-PCF;
\- provides the UE policy (e.g. ANDSP, URSP, V2XP, A2XP or ProSeP) of the
HPLMN to the V-PCF for forwarding to the UE via the the AMF;
\- provides the N2 PC5 policy for V2X communications and/or A2X communications
and/or 5G ProSe to the V-PCF for forwarding to the NG-RAN via the AMF; and
\- in case of URSP provisioning in EPS:
a. for the LBO roaming scenarios, provides URSP to the V-PCF for forwarding to
the UE via a V-PCF for a PDU session.
b. for the Home Routed scenarios, provides URSP to the PCF for the PDU session
in the HPLMN, for forwarding to the UE via the H-SMF.
The policy decisions made by the PCF may also be based on one or more of the
following:
\- Information obtained from the UDR (e.g., UE Policy Subscription data and/or
Service Parameter Data provided by the AF/NEF via the UDR);
\- Information obtained from the AMF, e.g. UE related and access related
information;
\- Information obtained from the NWDAF;
\- Information from the CHF about spending limits control; and
NOTE 5: In this release of the specification, policy decisions based on
spending limits control apply to URSP only.
\- PCF pre-configured policy context.
#### 4.1.3.2 NF Service Consumers
The known NF service consumers of the Npcf_UEPolicyControl are the AMF, the
V-PCF in the roaming case, and a PCF for a PDU session in case of URSP
provisioning in EPS.
The Access and Mobility Management function (AMF) performs:
\- registration management;
\- connection management;
\- reachability management;
\- mobility Management;
\- forwarding of UE Policy towards the served UE;
\- reporting of the UE state to the (V-)PCF;
\- forwarding of the UE policy enforcement result received from the UE to the
(V-)PCF; and
NOTE: The AMF invokes the Namf_Communication service specified in 3GPP TS
29.518 [14] to report the UE policy enforcement result.
\- forwarding of the N2 PC5 policy for V2X communications and/or A2X
communications and/or 5G ProSe towards the NG-RAN.
The Visited Policy Control Function (V-PCF) provides the functions described
in clause 4.1.3.1 towards the visited network as NF service producer and acts
as NF Service consumer toward the H-PCF, performing the following functions:
\- receiving policy control request trigger(s) and/or UE policy (e.g. ANDSP,
URSP, V2XP, A2XP, ProSeP) from the H-PCF;
\- receiving the N2 PC5 policy for V2X communications and/or A2X
communications and/or 5G ProSe from the H-PCF; and
\- reporting of the UE state and UE policy enforcement result to the H-PCF.
The V-PCF may also provide the URSP enforcement report received from the UE,
if requested by the H-PCF as described in clause 4.2.2.2.3.
The PCF for a PDU session in case of URSP provisioning in EPS performs:
\- forwarding of URSP towards the served UE.

### 4.2.2 Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create Service Operation
#### 4.2.2.1 General
The procedure in the present clause is applicable when the NF service consumer
creates a UE policy association in the following cases:
\- UE performs initial registration to the network, as defined in clause
5.5.1.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15];
\- UE performs a mobility registration, if the UE operating in single-
registration mode performs inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, as
defined in clause 5.5.1.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15], and there is no existing
UE Policy Association between AMF and PCF for this UE; and
\- the AMF is relocated (between the different AMF sets) and the new AMF
selects a new PCF. The procedure for the case where the AMF is relocated and
the new AMF selects the old PCF is defined in clause 4.2.3.1.
To support the delivery of URSP in EPC, the procedure in the present clause is
also applicable when:
\- When the UE triggers a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message with a
UE policy container IE after the UE performs ePCO capability negotiation
during PDN connection establishment (during the Initial Attach with default
PDN connection establishment or the first PDN connection establishment)
procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 [33], and both, the UE and the network
support URSP provisioning in EPS PCO; and
\- 5GS to EPS handover or 5GS to EPS Idle Mode mobility (both referred as 5GS
to EPS mobility in the present document) as defined in 3GPP TS 24.501 [15].
The creation of a UE policy association only applies for normally registered
UEs, i.e. it does not apply for emergency-registered UEs.
Figure 4.2.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure used for the creation of a policy
association.
Figure 4.2.2.1-1: Creation of a UE policy association
NOTE 1: For the roaming scenario, the PCF represents the V-PCF, if the NF
service consumer is an AMF, and the PCF represents the H-PCF, if the NF
service consumer is a V-PCF.
When a UE registers to the network and a UE context is being established, if
the AMF obtains from the UE a UE policy delivery protocol message as defined
in Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15] and/or the authorized PC5 capability for 5G
ProSe, and/or the authorized PC5 capability for V2X communications and/or A2X
communications, the AMF shall establish a UE policy association with the
(V-)PCF, in case there is no existing UE policy association for the UE;
otherwise, the AMF may establish a UE Policy Association with the (V-)PCF
based on AMF local configuration.
NOTE 2: In the roaming scenario, the visited AMF\'s local configuration can
indicate whether UE Policy delivery is needed based on the roaming agreement
with the home PLMN of the UE.
During UE Initial Attach with default PDN connection or the etablishment of
the first PDN connection in EPS, if the UE and the SMF+PGW support URSP
provisioning in EPS PCO, and the \"EpsUrsp\" feature is supported between the
SMF+PGW-C and the PCF for the PDU session, the PCF for a PDU session
associated with the SMF+PGW-C serving the PDN connection obtains from the UE a
UE policy container in a Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Update procedure triggered by a
bearer resource modification procedure as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [31].
Then, if the \"EpsUrsp\" feature described in clause 5.8 is supported, the PCF
for a PDU session shall establish a UE policy association with the (V-)PCF for
the UE for the delivery of URSP only.
During 5GS to EPS mobility with N26, and if the \"EpsUrsp\" feature described
in clause 5.8 is supported, the PCF for the PDU session determines whether 5GS
to EPS mobility applies based on the received RAT and/or Access-Type change
event as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [31]. Then, for non-roaming and Home
Routed roaming scenarios, the PCF for a PDU session shall determine whether
the UE supports URSP provisioning in EPS by checking the UE Policy Set
information in UDR as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [17], and if supported,
shall establish a UE policy association with the PCF for the UE that is
handling the UE policy association with the source AMF. For LBO roaming
scenarios, the V-PCF for the PDU session determines based on local
configuration whether to establish a UE Policy Association towards the V-PCF
for the UE.
NOTE 3: The PCF for the PDU session discovers the address of the PCF for the
UE handling the UE policy association with the source AMF by querying the BSF
as described in 3GPP TS 29.521 [22].
To establish a UE policy association with the PCF, the NF service consumer
(e.g. AMF) shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/npcf-ue-policy-
control/v1/policies\" as Resource URI and the PolicyAssociationRequest data
structure as request body, which shall include:
\- the Notification URI encoded as \"notificationUri\" attribute;
\- the SUPI encoded as \"supi\" attribute; and
\- the features supported by the NF service consumer encoded as \"suppFeat\"
attribute,
shall also include, when available:
\- the GPSI encoded as \"gpsi\" attribute;
\- the Access type encoded as \"accessType\" attribute;
\- the Permanent Equipment Identifier (PEI) encoded as \"pei\" attribute;
\- the User Location Information encoded as \"userLoc\" attribute;
\- the UE Time Zone encoded as \"timeZone\" attribute;
\- the identifier of the serving network (the PLMN Identifier or the SNPN
Identifier), encoded as \"servingPlmn\" attribute;
NOTE 4: The SNPN Identifier consists of the PLMN Identifier and the NID.
\- the RAT type encoded as \"ratType\" attribute;
\- the received UE policy delivery protocol message defined in Annex D of 3GPP
TS 24.501 [15] encoded as \"uePolReq\" attribute;
\- for the roaming scenario, if the NF service consumer is an AMF, the H-PCF
ID encoded as \"hPcfId\" attribute;
\- the Internal Group Identifier(s) encoded as \"groupIds\" attribute;
> \- the PC5 capability for V2X encoded as \"pc5Capab\" attribute if the
> \"V2X\" feature defined in clause 5.8 is supported;
\- the 5G ProSe capability within the \"proSeCapab\" attribute, if the
\"ProSe\" feature defined in clause 5.8 is supported;
\- if the NF service consumer is an AMF, the GUAMI encoded as \"guami\"
attribute;
> \- if the NF service consumer is an AMF, the serving AMF Id encoded as
> \"servingNfId\" attribute;
NOTE 5: If the PCF received the \"servingNfId\" attribute, the PCF can use the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery Service specified in 3GPP TS 29.510 [13] to retrieve the NF
profile of the Namf_Communication service available in the indicated AMF
instance Id.
> \- if the NF service consumer is an AMF, the \"SliceAwareANDSP\" feature is
> supported, and the AMF has determined that the UE has selected a non-3gpp

#### 4.2.2.2 UE Policy
##### 4.2.2.2.1 Overview
###### 4.2.2.2.1.0 General
The UE policy consists of
\- UE Access Network discovery and selection policies (ANDSP). It is used by
the UE for selecting non-3GPP accesses networks. The encoding of ANDSP is
defined in 3GPP TS 24.526 [16];
\- UE Route Selection Policy (URSP). This UE policy is used by the UE to
determine how to route outgoing traffic. Traffic can be routed to an
established PDU Session, offloaded to non-3GPP access outside a PDU Session,
can be routed via a ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay outside a PDU session or
trigger the establishment of a new PDU Session. The encoding of URSP is
defined in 3GPP TS 24.526 [16];
\- UE Vehicle-to-Everything Policy (V2XP). This UE policy provides
configuration information to the UE for V2X communications over PC5 reference
point or over Uu reference point or both. The encoding of V2XP is defined in
3GPP TS 24.588 [25];
\- UE 5G Proximity based Services Policy (ProSeP). This UE policy provides
configuration information to the UE for 5G ProSe direct discovery, 5G ProSe
direct communications, 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay, 5G ProSe usage reporting
configuration and rules and/or 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay; and
\- UE Aircraft-to-Everything Policy (A2XP). This UE policy provides
configuration information to the UE for A2X communications over PC5 reference
point or A2X communications over Uu reference point or both. The encoding of
A2XP is defined in 3GPP TS 24.578 [33];
The UE Policy is transferred to the UE using the UE policy delivery protocol
defined in Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15]. The (V-)(H-)PCF shall send UE
policy using the \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" message and will receive the
\"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\"or the \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT\"
messages in the response. Those messages are transparently forwarded by the
AMF.
The (V-)PCF shall use the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service
operation defined in clause 5.2.2.3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [14] to send \"MANAGE
UE POLICY COMMAND\" messages to the UE and use the
Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify service operation defined in clause
5.2.2.3.5 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [14] to receive \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\" and
\"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT\" messages from the UE. The (V-)PCF shall
only send \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" messages below a predefined size limit.
The H-PCF shall use service operations as defined in the present specification
to receive \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\" and \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND
REJECT\" messages from the V-PCF and to send MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\"
messages to the V-PCF. The H-PCF shall encode the \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\"
message in a \"uePolicy\" attribute. The H-PCF shall only send \"MANAGE UE
POLICY COMMAND\" messages below a predefined size limit.
The (V-)(H-)PCF may deliver the UE policy to the UE in several \"MANAGE UE
POLICY COMMAND\" messages.
For the purpose of such fragmented delivery and subsequent partial updates of
UE policies, the UE policy is divided into policy sections. Such policy
sections may be predefined in the (V-)(H-)PCF, may be retrieved by the
(V-)(H-)PCF from the UDR as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [17], or may be
dynamically generated by the (V-)(H-)PCF, but shall comply to the rules
detailed below. The (V-)(H-)PCF may combine several policy sections into one
\"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" message, if the predefined size limit is
observed.
The following rules apply to policy sections:
\- The size shall be below the predefined size limit.
\- The policy section shall only contain complete URSP rule(s), WLANSP
rule(s), N3AN node configuration information, V2XP, A2XP and/or ProSeP info
content, but no fractions of such rules, configuration information, or info
contents.
\- To ease a subsequent partial update of UE policies, policy sections should
only contain a small number of policies, e.g. URSP rule(s), and/or WLANSP
rule(s).
\- The entire content of a policy section shall be provided by a single PLMN.
A PCF shall only determine policy sections of its own PLMN. However, a V-PCF
may forward UE policy sections received from the H-PCF to the UE.
Each UE policy section is identified by a UE policy section identifier (UPSI).
The UPSI is composed of two parts:
a) a PLMN ID part containing the PLMN ID of the PLMN or SNPN of the PCF which
provides the UE policies; and
b) a UE policy section code (UPSC) containing a unique value within the PLMN
or SNPN selected by the PCF.
NOTE 1: When the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode, the UE
associates the PLMN ID with the NID of the SNPN to differentiate between PLMN
UPSI(s) and SNPN UPSI(s).
The (V-)(H-)PCF provides an UPSI when providing a new UE policy section and
may then identify that policy section using that UPSI when requesting that
that UE policy section is modified or deleted, as specified in Annex D of 3GPP
TS 24.501 [15].
If the (V-)(H-)PCF determines that changes are required and/or the V-PCF
receives possible new or modified policy sections determined by the H-PCF in
the roaming case, it shall send the determined new, updated or deleted policy
sections using one or several \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" messages towards
the NF service consumer. In the roaming case, the V-PCF may either combine
policy sections received from the H-PCF and policy sections the V-PCF selected
in the same \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" (as long as the predefined size limit
is observed), or use separate \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" messages; however,
the V-PCF shall not distribute the policy sections received in one \"MANAGE UE
POLICY COMMAND\" from the H-PCF into several \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\"
messages as long as the predefined size limit is observed for the policy
sections received from the H-PCF. The V-PCF shall allocate a new PTI for the
\"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" sent by the V-PCF and store the mapping between
the new PTI and the PTI within the \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" received from
the H-PCF.
After sending a \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" messages, the (V-)(H-)PCF shall
wait for a related confirmation in a \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\" messages or
failure indication in a \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT\" message. When
receiving no such message until the expiry of a supervision timer specified in
Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15], or when receiving a failure indication, the
PCF should re-send related instructions for the policy sections. In the
roaming case, the H-PCF and the V-PCF shall each be responsible for resending
those policy sections that it originally supplied. In the case that the V-PCF
combined policy sections received from the H-PCF and policy sections the V-PCF
selected in the same \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" described below, the V-PCF
shall wait for the H-PCF to resend the policy sections of HPLMN, and then
resend the combined policy sections. The (V-)(H-)PCF shall always include the
initially supplied policy sections when resending the UE policy.
The (V-)(H-)PCF shall determine that a received \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\"
message or \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT\" message is related to the
result of a \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" based on the PTI within that message.
In the roaming case, the V-PCF shall determine that the received message is
related to the result of the UE policy provided by the H-PCF if the PTI within
the message belongs to one of the stored PTI mapping(s).
If the V-PCF combined policy sections received from the H-PCF and policy
sections the V-PCF selected in the same \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\", upon
reception of a \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\" message or \"MANAGE UE POLICY
COMMAND REJECT\" message the V-PCF shall:
\- forward the corresponding \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\" message to the
H-PCF;
\- if a \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT\" message with UPSI(s) of the HPLMN
is received, forward the parts of the \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT\"
message that relate to the UPSI(s) of the HPLMN to the H-PCF;
\- if a \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT\" message without UPSI(s) of the
HPLMN is received, send a \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\" message to the H-PCF;
and
\- provide the stored PTI received from the HPLMN in the corresponding
\"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" within the \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\" message
or \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT\" message towards the H-PCF.
If the V-PCF sent a separate \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" containing only the
policy sections received from the H-PCF, the V-PCF shall forward the
corresponding \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\" or \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND
REJECT\" message to the H-PCF and provide the stored PTI received from the
HPLMN in the corresponding \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" within the \"MANAGE UE
POLICY COMPLETE\" message or \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT\" message
towards the H-PCF.If the V-PCF distributed the policy sections received in one
\"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" from the H-PCF into several \"MANAGE UE POLICY
COMMAND\" messages to the UE (because the predefined size limit of the VPLMN
was exceeded), the V-PCF shall aggregate all corresponding \"MANAGE UE POLICY
COMPLETE\" or \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT\" messages received from the
UE into one \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\" or \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND
REJECT\" message towards the H-PCF.
When the (V-)PCF receives an Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer failure
response as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.1.2 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [14], or an N1N2
Transfer Failure Notification as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.518
[14], the (V-)PCF shall stop the supervision timer specified in Annex D of
3GPP TS 24.501 [15] corresponding to the affected PTIs. For the N1N2 Transfer
Failure Notification case, the (V-)PCF determines the affected PTIs allocated
by the V-PCF based on the resource URI within the \"n1n2MsgDataUri\" attribute
of the N1N2MsgTxfrFailureNotification data structure as defined in clause
6.1.6.2.30 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [14].
NOTE 2: The (V-)PCF correlates the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
request and the corresponding N1N2 Transfer Failure Notification based on the
resource URI within the \"Location\" header included in the response HTTP
status code \"202 Accepted\" of the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
response and the resource URI within the \"n1n2MsgDataUri\" attribute of and
N1N2 Transfer Failure Notification. And then the V-PCF determines the affected
PTIs related with the resource URI.
For the roaming case and if the V-PCF determines that the affected UE policy
is related with the UE policy delivered by the H-PCF, the V-PCF shall send a
POST message as defined in clause 4.2.3.1 to notify the H-PCF of the failure
of UE policy transfer by including the \"uePolTransFailNotif\" attribute
within the PolicyAssociationUpdateRequest data structure. Within the
UePolicyTransferFailureNotification data structure, the V-PCF shall include
the cause of the UE Policy Transfer Failure within the \"cause\" attribute and
the PTI(s) allocated by the H-PCF corresponding to the PTI(s) allocated by the
V-PCF within the \"ptis\" attribute. The H-PCF shall stop the supervision
timer corresponding to the affected PTIs.
In the failure case described above, the (H-)(V-)PCF may provision the policy
control request trigger \"CON_STATE_CH\" if not provisioned yet. Upon
receiving the notification of UE connectivity state change indicating that the
UE enters the CM-Connected state, the (H-)(V-)PCF may retry to deliver the UE
Policy.
When the (H-)PCF receives the \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\" or the \"MANAGE UE
POLICY COMMAND REJECT\" message and determines that this message indicates a
UE Policy Delivery outcome to which an NF service consumer has subscribed via
a request for service specific parameters, the (H-)PCF shall invoke the
Npcf_EventExposure_Notify service operation as defined in clause 4.2.4.2 of
3GPP TS 29.523 [30].
###### 4.2.2.2.1.1 Provisioning of the UE Access Network discovery and
selection policies and UE Route Selection Policy
During Initial Registration and 5GS Registration during UE mobility from EPS
to 5GS, and when:
a) the UE has one or more stored UE policy sections corresponding to the
serving PLMN/SNPN or HPLMN;or
b) the UE does not have any stored UE policy section corresponding to the
serving PLMN/SNPN or HPLMN and the UE needs to send a UE policy container to
the network;
then the UE includes the \"UE STATE INDICATION\" message as defined in clause
D.5.4.1 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15], which is transferred transparently by the AMF
within the \"uePolReq\" attribute during the creation of a policy association,
as described in clause 4.2.2.1.
The (H-)PCF, or the PCF of the SNPN for the UEs subscribed to the SNPN, may
store in the UDR, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [17]:
a) UPSCs and related UE policy sections of the own PLMN or SNPN it provided to
a UE;
b) the PEI received from the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF), if available;
c) the OSId(s) received from the UE within the \"UE STATE INDICATION\" message
as described in the Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15], if available;
d) the indication of UE\'s support for ANDSP included in the \"UE STATE
INDICATION\" message as described in the Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15], if
available;
e) if the \"EpsUrsp\" feature defined in 3GPP TS 29.519 [17] is supported, the
indication of UE\'s support for URSP provisioning in EPS included in the \"UE
STATE INDICATION\" message as described in the Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15],
if available; and
f) if the \"URSPEnforcement\" feature defined in 3GPP TS 29.519 [17] is
supported, the indication of UE\'s support for reporting URSP rule enforcement
included in the \"UE STATE INDICATION\" message as described in the Annex D of
3GPP TS 24.501 [15], if available.; and
g) if the \"VPLMNSpecificURSP\" feature defined 3GPP TS 29.519 [17] is
supported, the indication of UE\'s support for VPLM-Specific URSP included in
the \"UE STATE INDICATION\" message as described in the Annex D of 3GPP TS
24.501 [15], if available.
The PCF shall retrieve from UDR the information previously stored in UDR, if
not locally available, for URSP/ANDSP rule determination as specified in 3GPP
TS 29.519 [17].
The V-PCF may retrieve UPSCs and related UE policy sections applicable for all
UEs from a HPLMN from the V-UDR, using the HPLMN ID as key as specified in
3GPP TS 29.519 [17]. The PCF of the serving SNPN has locally configured the
UPSCs and related UE policy sections applicable for all UEs other than the UEs
subscribed to the SNPN.
When receiving the \"UE STATE INDICATION\" message, the (V-)(H-)PCF or the PCF
of the serving SNPN, shall determine, based on the UPSIs indicated in that
message, if available, the ANDSP support indication and the OSId(s) indicated
in that message, if available, the reporting URSP rule enforcement support in
that message, if available, the UE Policy Sections and UPSCs stored in the
UDR, if available, the policy subscription data, if available, application
data, if available, inputs received from the NF service consumer,and local
policy, as specified in clauses 4.2.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.2.3, whether any new UE
policy section(s) need to be installed and whether any existing UE policy
section(s) need to be updated or deleted. Based on local configuration, the
(H-)PCF or the PCF of the serving SNPN (for the SNPN-subscribed UEs), may
indicate to the UE to accept/not accept URSP rules signalled by non-subscribed
SNPNs within the UE policy network classmark IE in a MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND
message as described in Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15].
NOTE 1: When an SNPN-enabled UE registers in a SNPN using credentials from a
Credentials Holder (CH) but the UE is not subscribed in that SNPN, the PCF of
the non-subscribed SNPN, based on local policies, can provision the UE with
URSP rules for the SNPN.
When the received \"UE STATE INDICATION\" message indicated that the UE
supports VPLMN-specific URSP rules as specified in Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501
[15], the (H-)PCF may determine URSP rules specific per VPLMN as specified in
clauses 4.2.2.2.3.2. In this case, the (H-)PCF shall provide to the UE within
the \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" the UE policy sections containing the VPLMN-
specific URSP rules within the VPS URSP configuration IE as specified in
subclause D.6.8 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15].
NOTE 2: The VPS URSP configuration IE includes zero or more tuples, each tuple
containing a tuple Id, VPLMN ID(s) and a list of UPSC(s) (of HPLMN\'s UE
policy sections) with UE policies with URSP rules applicable to the VPLMN(s)
and its equivalent PLMN(s).
###### 4.2.2.2.1.1a Provisioning of URSP in EPS
When the UE initially attaches in EPS and establishes the default PDN
connection or establishes the first PDN connection in EPS, the \"EpsUrsp\"
feature is supported as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [31], both the UE and the
network support URSP provisioning in EPS PCO,, the UE includes the UE policy
container IE with the \"UE STATE INDICATION\" message as defined in clause
D.5.4.1 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15] in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 [36]. The UE policy container is then
transferred transparently by the PCF for the PDU session within the
\"uePolReq\" attribute during the creation of a UE policy association, as
described in clause 4.2.2.1.
The (H-)PCF, may store in the UDR, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [17]:
a) UPSCs and related URSP sections of the own PLMN it provided to a UE;
b) the PEI received from the NF service consumer, if available; and
c) the OSId(s) received from the UE within the \"UE STATE INDICATION\" message
as described in the Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15], if available.
d) if the \"EpsUrsp\" feature defined in 3GPP TS 29.519 [17] is supported, the
indication of UE\'s support for URSP provisioning in EPS included in the \"UE
STATE INDICATION\" message as described in the Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15],
if available.
The PCF shall retrieve from UDR the information previously stored in UDR, if
not locally available, for URSP rule determination as specified in 3GPP TS
29.519 [17].
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS how URSP provisionng in EPS is supported in Home
Routed roaming scenarios.
When receiving the \"UE STATE INDICATION\" message, the (H-)PCF, shall
determine, based on the UPSIs indicated in that message, if available, the
OSId(s) indicated in that message, if available, the UE Policy Sections and
UPSCs stored in the UDR, if available, the policy subscription data, if
available, application data, if available, and local policy, as specified in
clauses 4.2.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.2.3, whether any new URSP section(s) need to be
installed and whether any existing URSP section(s) need to be updated or
deleted.
During 5GS to EPS mobility with N26, when the \"EpsUrsp\" feature is supported
and PCF for the PDU session establishes a UE Policy Association with the PCF
for the UE as described in clause 4.2.2.1, the PCF for the UE shall determine
whether the 5GS to EPS mobility with N26 scenario applies based on the
\"5gsToEpsMob\" attribute. If it applies, the PCF for the UE shall recover
from the UE Policy Association previously established with the AMF:
\- UE Policy Section related information, i.e.:
a) UPSCs and related URSP sections of the own PLMN it provided to the UE; and
b) the OSId(s) received from the UE within the \"UE STATE INDICATION\" message
as described in the Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15], if available; and
\- the subscribed Policy Control Triggers with the AMF, if available.
NOTE: At 5GS to EPS mobility with N26, the guard timer in the AMF (as
specified in clause 4.11.1.2.1 and clause 4.11.1.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]) ensures
that the UE Policy Association remains until the PCF for the UE detects that a
UE Policy Association establishment is received from a PCF for the PDU Session
indicating 5GS to EPS mobility.
When receiving the 5GS to EPS mobility indication, the PCF for the UE, shall
determine, based on the UE Policy Sections and the OSId(s) recovered from the
former UE Policy Association in 5GS, if available, the policy subscription
data, if available, application data, if available, and local policy, as
specified in clauses 4.2.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.2.3, whether any new UE Policy
section(s) with URSP need to be installed and whether any existing UE Policy
section(s) with URSP need to be updated or deleted.
In both scenarios above, initial attach and/or first PDN connection
establishmet in EPS scenario and 5GS to EPS mobility scenario, the determined
URSP is transferred to the UE as specified in 4.2.2.2.1.0 with the following
differences:
\- the messages of the UE policy delivery protocol defined in Annex D of 3GPP
TS 24.501 [15] are transparently forwarded to the UE by a PCF for a PDU
session; and
\- the (V-)(H-)PCF shall use the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Create/Update response
and the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify request to send \"MANAGE UE POLICY
COMMAND\" messages to the UE in a \"uePolicy\" attribute and use the
Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Update service operation to receive \"MANAGE UE POLICY
COMPLETE\" and \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT\" messages from the UE via a
PCF for a PDU session in a \"uePolDelResult\" attribute.
###### 4.2.2.2.1.2 Provisioning of Vehicle-to-Everything Policy
When the UE registers to the network, if the AMF receives from the UE the PC5
capability for V2X communications in the Registration Request message, the UE
is authorized to use V2X service based on the UE\'s subscription information
and the \"V2X\" feature is supported, the AMF further reports to the PCF the
PC5 capability for V2X communications within the \"pc5Capab\" attribute as
defined in clause 4.2.2.1. The PCF may determine the V2XP over PC5 interface
based on the received UE\'s PC5 capability for V2X, the Service specific
parameter information retrieved from UE\'s Application Data in the UDR as
defined in clause 6.2.15 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [17] and the operator\'s policy.
After UE registration, if the UE supports V2X communication and it does not
have valid V2XP, the UE includes the \"UE POLICY PROVISIONING REQUEST\"
message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.587 [24] during the NAS transport procedure.
The PCF may reject the request by sending back a \"UE POLICY PROVISIONING
REJECT\" message as defined in clause 7.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.587 [24] or
provision the policy, as defined in clause 4.2.2.2.1, based on the service
specific parameter information retrieved from UE\'s Application Data in the
UDR as defined in clause 6.2.15 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [17] and the operator\'s
policy.
For both scenarios mentioned above, in the roaming case, the H-PCF may include
the V2XP within the \"uePolicy\" attribute in the policy association create or
update response to the V-PCF and in the policy association update request
initiated by the H-PCF.
In the roaming or non-roaming case, the (V-)PCF shall use the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation defined in clause
5.2.2.3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [14] to send the V2XP to the UE.
###### 4.2.2.2.1.3 Provisioning of ProSe Policy
When the UE registers to the network and the UE supports 5G ProSe, if the AMF
receives from the UE the 5G ProSe Capability in the Registration Request
message, the UE is authorized to use 5G ProSe service based on the UE\'s
subscription information and the \"ProSe\" feature defined in clause 5.8 is
supported, the AMF further reports to the PCF this 5G ProSe Capability of the
UE within the \"proSeCapab\" attribute, as per the procedures defined in
clause 4.2.2.1. When the UE disables/enables a 5G ProSe capability, the AMF
further reports to the PCF the updated 5G ProSe capabilities of the UE within
the \"proSeCapab\" attribute, as per the procedures defined in clause 4.2.3.1.
The PCF may determine the support of 5G ProSe based on the received UE\'s 5G
ProSe Capability, the service specific parameter information retrieved from
the UE\'s Application Data in the UDR as defined in clause 6.2.15 of 3GPP TS
29.519 [17] and the operator\'s policy.
After UE registration, if the UE does not have valid ProSeP, the UE includes a
\"UE POLICY PROVISIONING REQUEST\" message defined in clause 7.2.1.1 of 3GPP
TS 24.554 [28] during theNAS transport procedure. The PCF may either reject
the request by sending back a \"UE POLICY PROVISIONING REJECT\" message
defined in clause 7.2.2.1 of 3GPP TS 24.587 [24] or provision the policy, as
defined in clause 4.2.2.2.1, based on the service specific parameter
information retrieved from the UE\'s Application Data in the UDR as defined in
clause 6.2.15 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [17] and the operator\'s policy.
For both scenarios mentioned above, in the roaming case, the H-PCF may include
the ProSeP within the \"uePolicy\" attribute in the policy association create
and update response to the V-PCF and in the policy association update request
initiated by the H-PCF.
In the roaming or non-roaming case, the (V-)PCF shall use the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation defined in clause
5.2.2.3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [14] to send the ProSeP to the UE.
###### 4.2.2.2.1.4 Provisioning of Aircraft-to-Everything Policy
When the UE registers to the network, if the AMF receives from the UE the PC5
capability for A2X communications in the Registration Request message, the UE
is authorized to use A2X service based on the UE\'s subscription information
and the \"A2X\" feature is supported, the AMF further reports to the PCF the
PC5 capability for A2X communications within the \"pc5CapA2x\" attribute as
defined in clause 4.2.2.1. The PCF may determine the A2XP over PC5 interface
based on the received UE\'s PC5 capability for A2X, the Service specific
parameter information retrieved from UE\'s Application Data in the UDR as
defined in clause 6.2.15 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [17] and the operator\'s policy.
After UE registration, if the UE supports A2X communication and it does not
have valid A2XP, the UE includes the \"UE POLICY PROVISIONING REQUEST\"
message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.577 [32] during the NAS transport procedure.
The PCF may reject the request by sending back a \"UE POLICY PROVISIONING
REJECT\" message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.577 [32] or provision the policy, as
defined in clause 4.2.2.2.1, based on the service specific parameter
information retrieved from UE\'s Application Data in the UDR as defined in
clause 6.2.15 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [17] and the operator\'s policy.
Editor\'s Note: The reference to CT1 specification for A2XP related UE
messages to be updated.
For both scenarios mentioned above, in the roaming case, the H-PCF may include
the A2XP within the \"uePolicy\" attribute in the policy association create or
update response to the V-PCF and in the policy association update request
initiated by the H-PCF.
In the roaming or non-roaming case, the (V-)PCF shall use the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation defined in clause
5.2.2.3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [14] to send the A2XP to the UE.
##### 4.2.2.2.2 UE Access Network discovery and selection policies (ANDSP)
UE Access Network discovery and selection policies are used by the UE to
select non-3GPP accesses and to decide how to route traffic between the
selected 3GPP and non 3GPP accesses.
In this release of the specification, the Access Network Discovery & Selection
policy shall contain only rules that aid the UE in selecting a WLAN access
network. Rules for selecting other types of non-3GPP access networks are not
specified.
The WLAN access network selected by the UE with the use of Access Network
Discovery & Selection policy may be used for direct traffic offload (i.e.
sending traffic to the WLAN outside of a PDU Session) and for registering to
5GC using the non-3GPP access network selection information.
The Access Network Discovery & Selection policy shall contain one or more WLAN
Selection Policy (WLANSP) rules and and may contain Non-3GPP access network
(N3AN) node selection information and configuration information.
N3AN node selection information and configuration information is used to
control UE behaviour related to selection of N3IWF, or ePDG for accessing 5GC
via untrusted non-3GPP access, or to support TNGF selection based on the
S-NSSAI(s) needed by the UE for accessing 5GC via trusted 3GPP access.
UE Access Network discovery and selection policies are encoded as defined in
3GPP TS 24.526 [16].
UE Access Network discovery and selection policies may be provided by a V-PCF
and/or a H-PCF.
If the UE has indicated in the \"UE STATE INDICATION\" message it does not
support ANDSP, or, when the feature \"UECapabilityIndication\" is supported,
the V-PCF receives from the H-PCF the \"andspInd\" attribute to false, i.e.
the UE does not support non-3GPP access, the (V-)(H-)PCF shall not send any
Access Network discovery and selection policies to the UE.
##### 4.2.2.2.3 UE Route Selection Policy (URSP)
###### 4.2.2.2.3.1 General
The UE Route Selection Policy is used by the UE to determine how to route
outgoing traffic.
The UE Route Selection Policy shall consist of one or several URSP rules. The
PCF determines whether URSP rule(s) have to be provisioned based on input
parameters received from the NF service consumer, the received list of UPSIs
from the UE, if available, the UE Policy Sections stored in the UDR, if
available, other received UE parameters, if available, the policy subscription
and application data retrieved from UDR, if available, analytics information
received from NWDAF, if available, and local policies.
URSP rules are encoded as defined in 3GPP TS 24.526 [16].
UE Route Selection Policy may only be provided by a H-PCF or the PCF of the
SNPN, but shall not be provided by a V-PCF. However, UE Route Selection Policy
determined and provided by the H-PCF may be retrieved by a V-PCF from the
H-PCF and forwarded to a UE.
The (H-)PCF shall use the UE policy subscription data stored in UDR as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [17] to ensure the values included in the Route
Selection Descriptor of the generated URSP rules are always supported by
subscription.
For the received list of internal group Ids, the (H-)PCF retrieves the
corresponding 5G VN group configuration data stored from the UDR as specified
in 3GPP TS 29.504[27] and 3GPP TS 29.505 [26], if available. For each
available 5G VN group, the (H-)PCF may use the retrieved 5G VN group
configuration values to encode the values for the Route Selection Descriptor
and the values for the Traffic Descriptor of the generated URSP rules.
If the \"EnhancedBackgroundDataTransfer\" feature is supported, the (H-)PCF
may retrieve the Background Data Transfer Reference ID(s) by retrieving the
UE\'s Application Data from the UDR as defined in clause 6.2.9 of 3GPP TS
29.519 [17]. In this case, the PCF shall retrieve the transfer policy
corresponding to the Background Data Transfer Reference ID(s) as defined in
clause 5.2.8 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [17] and then may create the URSP rules
including the Route Selection Validation Criteria for the UE as defined in
clause 6.6.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [4]. If the (H-)PCF provisions the URSP rules
including the Route Selection Validation Criteria for the UE, it shall use the
associated S-NSSAI and DNN to store in the UDR the Background Data Transfer
Reference ID(s) in the UE\'s session management policy data as specified in
3GPP TS 29.519 [17].
If the (H-)PCF retrieves the BDT policy and corresponding related information
(e.g. network area information, the volume of data to be transferred per UE,
etc.) within the BdtData data type, and the \"bdtpStatus\" attribute within
the BdtData data type is set to value \"INVALID\", the (H-)PCF shall not
provision the URSP rules based on the invalid BDT policy. When the BDT policy
re-negotiation is completed the PCF may:
\- if the new BDT Policy is determined, create or update the applicable URSP
rules based on the new BDT policy; or
\- if the invalid BDT policy is removed, remove applicable URSP rules.
If the \"AfGuideURSP\" feature is supported by the Nudr_DataRepository
service, the (H-)PCF may receive Service specific parameter information that
contains data for AF guidance information on the URSP determination as defined
in clause 6.4.2.15 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [17]. In this case, the (H-)PCF may also
use this AF guidance information as input to determine the URSP that will be
provisioned to the UE. If the received AF guidance information is not
consistent with the UE subscription data, or the local operator policy does
not allow the specific S-NSSAI and DNN provided by the AF guidance
information, the corresponding AF guidance information shall not be used to
determine the URSP rules. The PCF may also determine not to use AF guidance
based on the analytics info received from the NWDAF.
When the (H-)PCF decides to provide URSP rules based on the AF guidance
information, it shall derive the information as follows:
\- Application traffic descriptor within the \"trafficDesc\" attribute is used
to set the Traffic Descriptor of URSP rule (defined in Figure 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS
24.526 [16]).
\- Each route selection parameter set within the \"routeSelParamSets\"
attribute of the UrspRuleRequest data type is used to determine a Route
selection descriptor (defined in Figure 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 24.526 [16]) as
follows:
\- DNN (within the \"dnn\" attribute of the RouteSelectionParameterSet data
type) and S-NSSAI (within the \"snssai\" attribute of the
RouteSelectionParameterSet data type) from the route selection parameter set
are used to set the Route selection descriptor contents (defined in Figure
5.2.4 of 3GPP TS 24.526 [16]);
\- Route selection precedence (within the \"precedence\" attribute of the
RouteSelectionParameterSet data type) is used to set the Precedence value of
route selection descriptor (defined in Figure 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS 24.526 [16]);
and
\- the spatial validity condition (within the \"spatialValidityTais\"
attribute of the RouteSelectionParameterSet data type) is used to set the
Location criteria of the route selection descriptor (defined in Figure 5.2.5
of 3GPP TS 24.526 [16]).
\- The precedence for the generated URSP rule is determined by the (H-)PCF.
The (H-)PCF may use the \"relatPrecedence\" attribute within the
\"UrspRuleRequest\" data type to derive the relative precedence of the URSP
rule for a request coming from the same AF.
URSP rules based on AF guidance should not be set as the URSP rules with the
\"match all\" application traffic descriptor.
The (H-)PCF may obtain the information about the UE\'s OS from the UE as
described in the Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15] or it may derive the
information about the UE\'s OS from the PEI provided by the NF service
consumer (e.g. AMF).
If the (H-)PCF is required to provide UE policies to the UE that includes
application descriptors then:
a) If the (H-)PCF has been provided with one UE\'s OS Id by the UE, the
(H-)PCF shall use either the traffic descriptor \"OS App Id type\" or the
traffic descriptor \"OS Id + OS App Id type\" as defined in 3GPP TS 24.526
[16].
NOTE 1: The (H-)PCF uses the traffic descriptor \"OS Id + OS App Id type\"
when the (H-)PCF does not take the received UE\'s OS Id into account.
b) If the (H-)PCF has been provided with more than one UE\'s OS Id by the UE,
\- the (H-)PCF shall use the traffic descriptor \"OS Id + OS App Id type\" for
the UE\'s OS Id provided by the UE as defined in 3GPP TS 24.526 [16]; and
\- the (H-)PCF shall not use the traffic descriptor \"OS App Id type\" as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.526 [16].
c) If the (H-)PCF has not been provided with the UE\'s OS Id by the UE,
\- the (H-)PCF shall use the traffic descriptor \"OS Id + OS App Id type\" as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.526 [16]; and
\- the (H-)PCF shall not use the traffic descriptor \"OS App Id type\" as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.526 [16].
d) If the (H-)PCF has been provided with the UE\'s OS Id by the UE and the
(H-)PCF has derived the UE\'s OS Id from the PEI and if there is an
inconsistency between the OS Id provided by the UE and the OS Id derived from
the PEI, the (H-)PCF shall use the OS Id provided by the UE for providing UE
policies to the UE that include application descriptors.
URSP rules may be used to support end to end redundant user plane paths by
establishing two redundant PDU sessions. PCF configuration based on e.g.
deployment, terminal implementation or policies per group of UE(s) may be used
by the PCF to determine whether the URSP Rules shall include PDU Session Pair
ID and RSN to indicate that they refer to redundant PDU sessions or whether
the UE will determine these values instead.
If the AF provided the (H-)PCF with Personal IoT Network identifier (PIN ID)
associated with a DNN and S-NSSAI, and the received DNN and S-NSSAI
corresponds to a subscribed DNN and S-NSSAI combination in the UE Policy
Context as described in 3GPP TS 29.519 [17], the (H-)PCF shall include the PIN
ID within the traffic descriptor of the URSP Rule attribute as defined in 3GPP
TS 24.526 [16] for UE to choose an appropriate PIN to establish the PDU
session.NOTE 2: The PCF can provide two distinct URSP rules to support end to
end redundant user plane paths using Dual Connectivity for the duplicated
traffic of an application. Duplicated traffic from the UE application is
differentiated by two distinct traffic descriptors (different DNNs, and for IP
traffic, different IP descriptors or non-IP descriptors), each one defined in
a different URSP rule, so that the two redundant PDU sessions are matched to
the specific Route Selection Descriptors of distinct URSP rules. These Route
Selection Descriptors of distinct URSP rules may include corresponding RSNs
and PDU Session Pair IDs as defined in 3GPP TS 24.526 [16]. The Route
Selection Descriptors share the same PDU Session Pair ID, if included, to
denote the two traffic are redundant with each other.
NOTE 3: For backward compatibility, PCF can provide a Route Selection
Descriptor with PDU Session Pair ID and RSN and a Route Selection Descriptor
without PDU Session Pair ID and RSN in the URSP rule. In this case, the Route
Selection Descriptor with PDU Session Pair ID and RSN has a lower precedence
value (i.e. higher prioritised) than the one without PDU Session Pair ID. It
allows that if a non-supporting UE receives the Route Selection Descriptor
containing PDU Session Pair ID, it ignores this Route Selection Descriptor.
NOTE 4: PIN ID and other traffic descriptor components are mutually exclusive,
i.e., if PIN ID is included in a URSP rule, then no other traffic descriptor
components are supported in the same URSP rule.
The PCF may adjust the URSP rules when needed, based on awareness of URSP rule
enforcement for an application by using the following mechanisms:
A. Awareness of URSP rule enforcement with UE assistance:
Based on operator policies, and if the UE included in the UE STATE INDICATION
message the indication of UE\'s support of reporting URSP rule enforcement as
specified in the Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15], the PCF may indicate in a
URSP rule sent to the UE to send reporting of URSP rule enforcement, as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.526 [16]. For this URSP rule, the UE reports URSP rule
enforcement to the SMF if Connection Capabilities are included in the traffic
descriptor, as specified in the Annex D of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15] and in 3GPP TS
24.526 [16]. The SMF reports URSP rule enforcement information to the PCF as
specifed in 3GPP TS 29.512 [31].
For LBO roaming session case, if the feature \"URSPEnforcement\" is supported,
the H-PCF for the UE may send the URSP enforcement information Policy Control
Request Trigger to the V-PCF for the UE during the UE Policy Association
Establishment or Modification procedures. When the V-PCF receives URSP rule
enforcement information as described above, the V-PCF shall invoke the UE
Policy Association Update Modification procedure as described in clause
4.2.3.1.
If the (V-)(H-)PCF for a UE and the PCF for a PDU session are different, then
the (V-)(H-)PCF for a UE may obtain UE reporting of URSP rule enforcement
information from the PCF for a PDU session as defined in 3GPP TS 29.514 [37],
where the V-PCF for a UE interacts with the PCF for a PDU session in the VPLMN
and the H-PCF for a UE interacts with the PCF for a PDU session in the HPLMN.
Based on the received URSP rule enforcement information, the (H-)PCF may
adjust the URSP rules e.g. when the (H-)PCF determines that the UE does not
have up-to-date URSP rules.
In this release of the specification, the received URSP rule enforcement
report shall contain one or more connection capabilities. If the URSP rule
enforcement report does not include connection capabilities, based on local
policies, the (H-)PCF for the UE may ignore the received report.
B. Awareness of URSP rule enforcement without UE assistance: The PCF may
subscribe to statistics for traffic monitoring of known traffic according to
provisioned URSP rule(s) at the NWDAF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.520 [38]. If
the PCF is notified with traffic which is not expected according to a URSP
rule, the PCF may adjust the URSP rules when unexpected application traffic is
detected.
Editor's note: The details that the PCF receives the report of URSP rule
enforcement info from NWDAF is FFS.
NOTE 5: The PCF can combine UE reporting of URSP rule enforcement with
analytics information.
###### 4.2.2.2.3.2 Provisioning of VPLMN-specific URSP Rules
When the UE supports VPLMN-specific URSP rules, the H-PCF may provision VPLMN
specific URSP rules to the UE for the purpose to route traffic to the VPLMN as
described in clause 4.2.2.2.1.1. The H-PCF provides VPLMN specific URSP rules
that contains HPLMN values.
NOTE 1: For network slice information, the VPLMN-specific URSP rule contains
HPLMN NSSAI values. For DNN information, the VPLMN-specific URSP rule contains
DNN values according to the subscribed DNNs for which LBO roaming is allowed,
as specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [17].
The (H-)PCF may use AF guidance on URSP determination as input for VPLMN-
specific URSP rule determination as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.3.1. The
(H-)PCF retrieves from the UDR at the HPLMN the AF guidance for the VPLMN-
specific URSP rules for a UE, group of UEs or any UE as specified in 3GPP TS
29.519 [17].
In case of roaming and if the feature \"VPLMNSpecificURSP\" is supported, the
H-PCF may receive from the V-PCF the AF-guidance on VPLMN specific URSP rules
within the \"vpsUrspGuidance\" attribute as specified in clauses 4.2.2.1, and
4.2.3.1. The V-PCF receives from the UDR at the VPLMN the V-AF guidance for
the VPLMN specific URSP rules for all roaming UEs of a HPLMN as specified in
3GPP TS 29.519 [17]. The V-PCF determines based on LBO information received
from the AMF whether the received V-AF-guidance on VPLMN specific URSP rules
may apply for this UE, and if it is so, the V-PCF forwards the related
information to the H-PCF within the \"vpsUePolGuidance\" attribute as
specified in clause 4.2.2.1.
For a UE for which AF guidance on VPLMN specific URSP rules is forwarded to
the H-PCF within the \"vpsUePolGuidance\" attribute, the V-PCF maps the
S-NSSAI of the VPLMN (indicated by the AF and retrieved from the UDR, if
available) into the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN. The V-PCF uses the Configured NSSAI
for the Serving PLMN and mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Configured NSSAI to
corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAI values provided by the AMF within the
\"confSnssais\" attribute as specified in clauses 4.2.2.1, and 4.2.3.1. The
V-PCF shall subscribe to the \"CONF_NSSAI_CH\" policy control request trigger.
Then, for each URSP rule included within the \"urspGuidance\" attribute, the
V-PCF sends the mapped application guidance on URSP determination including
the HPLMN S-NSSAI values to the H-PCF within the \"snssai\" attribute included
within the corresponding \"routeSelParamSets\" entry.
The H-PCF generates new or updated VPLMN-specific URSP rules using the
received application guidance on the URSP rule determination, where the VPLMN
ID(s) included in the (H-)AF and/or V-PCF request is used to indicate to the
UE that this URSP rule applies when the UE is registered in the VPLMN ID. The
H-PCF provides URSP rules for the received AF-guidance parameter values that
are within the subscribed values defined in the UE Policy Data Set, as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.519 [17]. The VPLMN ID(s) received in the (H-)(V-)AF
request, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.522[39], and/or received in the V-PCF
request, and provided by the H-PCF within the VPLMN-specific URSP rule, as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [15], may contain one or more specific values for
the MCC and MNC and/or may indicate any MNC for a MCC. The H-PCF, based on
operator policies, may set the precedence in the URSP Rules to ensure that the
UE checks the VPLMN ID(s) that contain one or more specific values for the MCC
and MNC. The H-PCF should also set the precedence in the URSP rules to ensure
that the UE checks any VPLMN-specific URSP rule related to the serving PLMN
before any non-VPLMN specific URSP rules.
If the UE does not indicate the support for VPLMN specific URSP rules, the
H-PCF generates new or updated URSP rules using the VPLMN ID related
information retrieved from the UDR and/or received from the V-PCF.
NOTE 2: To avoid the UE stores obsolete information about VPLMN-specific URSP
rules, the H-PCF could delete those determined based on V-AF guidance and once
the UE has left the VPLMN.

### 4.2.3 Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Update Service Operation
#### 4.2.3.1 General
The procedure in the present clause is applicable when the NF service consumer
modifies an existing UE policy association (including the case where the AMF
is relocated and the new AMF selects to maintain the policy association with
the old PCF and to update the Notification URI).
Figure 4.2.3.1-1 illustrates the update of a policy association.
Figure 4.2.3.1-1: Update of a UE policy association
NOTE 1: For the roaming case, the PCF represents the V-PCF if the NF service
consumer is an AMF and the PCF represents the H-PCF if the NF service consumer
is a V-PCF.
The AMF, as NF service consumer, invokes this procedure when a subscribed
policy control request trigger (see clause 4.2.3.2) occurs. When a policy
control request trigger that requires the subscription as defined in table
5.6.3.3-1 (e.g. LOC_CH trigger) occurs, the NF service consumer (AMF) shall
only invoke this procedure if the PCF has explicitly subscribed to that event
trigger. When a policy control request trigger that does not require the
subscription as defined in table 5.6.3.3-1 (e.g. GROUP_ID_LIST_CHG trigger)
occurs, the NF service consumer (AMF) shall always invoke the procedure.
NOTE 2: The AMF uses the Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify service operation
specified in 3GPP TS 29.518 [14] to send to the V-PCF a \"MANAGE UE POLICY
COMPLETE\" message or a \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT\" message, as
defined in Annex D.5 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [15] or a \"UE POLICY PROVISIONING
REQUEST\" message as defined in clause 7.2.1.1 of 3GPP TS 24.587 [24].
If an AMF as NF service consumer knows by implementation specific means that
the UE context has been transferred to an AMF with another GUAMI within the
AMF set, it may also invoke this procedure to update the Notification URI.
NOTE 3: Either the old or the new AMF can invoke this procedure.
During the AMF relocation, if the new AMF received the resource URI of the
individual UE Policy from the old AMF and selects the old PCF, the new AMF
shall also invoke this procedure to update the Notification URI. The new AMF
may also update the alternate or backup IP addresses, and if service discovery
via NRF applies, the AMF Id. If the feature \"FeatureRenegotation\" is
supported, the new AMF may perform feature renegotiation, as described in
clause 4.2.3.4.
NOTE 4: During inter-AMF mobility, the N1N2 Individual Subscription context is
transferred from the source AMF to the target AMF as specified in 3GPP TS
29.518 [14]. When the target AMF determines to reuse the UE Policy Association
indicated by the source AMF, the PCF can keep the N1N2 Individual Subscription
context and, for subsequent interactions, replace in the request URI the
{apiRoot} of the N1N2 Individual Subscription resource with the one of the
target AMF.
The V-PCF, as NF service consumer, invokes this procedure when a policy
control request trigger (see clause 4.2.3.2) occurs. When a policy control
request trigger that does not require the subscription as defined in table
5.6.3.3-1 (e.g. UE_POLICY trigger) occurs, the V-PCF shall always invoke the
procedure. When a policy control request trigger that requires the
subscription as defined in table 5.6.3.3-1 (e.g. LOC_CH trigger) occurs, the
V-PCF shall only invoke this procedure if the Hâ€‘PCF has subscribed to that
event trigger.
To request policies (e.g. policy control request trigger(s) is/are met) from
the PCF, to update the Notification URI, to renegotiate features, to update
the trace control configuration or to request the termination of trace, the NF
Service Consumer shall request the update of the associated UE Policy
Association by providing the relevant parameters about the UE context in an
HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/npcf-ue-policy-
control/v1/policies/{polAssoId}/update\" as Resource URI and the
PolicyAssociationUpdateRequest data structure as request body that shall
include:
\- at least one of the following:
1\. a new Notification URI encoded in the \"notificationUri\" attribute;
2\. observed Policy Control Request Trigger(s) (see clause 4.2.3.2) encoded as
\"triggers\" attribute;
3\. if a UE location change occurred, the UE location encoded as \"userLoc\"
attribute;
4\. if a \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\" message or a \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND
REJECT\" message of the UE policy delivery protocol defined in Annex D of 3GPP
TS 24.501 [15] has been received by the V-PCF as NF service consumer, and at
least parts of the contents relate to UPSIs of the HPLMN, the parts of that

changed encoded as \"praStatuses\" attribute;
NOTE 5: If the PCF included the identifer of a Core Network predefined
Presence Reporting Area Set within the \"praId\" attribute during the
subscription to changes of UE presence in PRA, the AMF only provides the
presence reporting area information corresponding to the concerned individual
Presence Reporting Area Identifier(s) within the Set. The \"praId\" attribute
within each returned \"PresenceInfo\" data type hence includes the identifier
of the concerned individual Presence Reporting Area.
6\. if the NF service consumer is an AMF, for AMF relocation scenarios, if
available, alternate or backup IPv4 Address(es) where to send Notifications
encoded as \"altNotifIpv4Addrs\" attribute;
7\. if the NF service consumer is an AMF, for AMF relocation scenarios, if
available, alternate or backup IPv6 Address(es) where to send Notifications
encoded as \"altNotifIpv6Addrs\" attribute;
8\. if the NF service consumer is an AMF, for AMF relocation scenarios, if
available, alternate or backup FQDN(s) where to send Notifications encoded as
\"altNotifFqdns\" attribute;
9\. for AMF relocation scenarios, the GUAMI encoded as \"guami\" attribute;
NOTE 6: An alternate NF service consumer than the one that requested the
generation of the subscription resource can send the request. For instance, an
AMF as service consumer can change.
10\. if the NF service consumer is an AMF, for AMF relocation scenarios, the
new serving AMF Id encoded in the \"servingNfId\" attribute;
NOTE 7: If the PCF received the \"servingNfId\" attribute, the PCF can use the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery Service specified in 3GPP TS 29.510 [13] to retrieve the NF
profile of the Namf_Communication service available in the indicated AMF
instance Id.
11\. if a UE PLMN change occurred and the \"PlmnChange\" feature defined in
clause 5.8 is supported, the PLMN Identifier or the SNPN Identifier of the new
serving network encoded as \"plmnId\" attribute;
NOTE 8: The SNPN Identifier consists of the PLMN Identifier and the NID.
NOTE 9: When the UE moves between PLMNs, the trigger reports changes of
equivalent PLMNs.
NOTE 10: Mobility between non-equivalent SNPNs, and between SNPN and PLMN is
not supported. When the UE is operating in SNPN access mode, the trigger
reports changes of equivalent SNPNs.
12\. if a \"UE POLICY PROVISIONING REQUEST\" message defined in clause 7.2.1.1
of 3GPP TS 24.587 [24] has been received by the V-PCF as NF service consumer
and respectively the \"V2X\" feature , and/or the \"A2X\" feature and/or the
\"ProSe\" feature defined in clause 5.8 is/are supported, the message encoded
as \"uePolReq\" attribute;
13\. if a UE Internal Group Identifier(s) change occurred and the
\"GroupIdListChange\" feature defined in clause 5.8 is supported, the Internal
Group Identifier(s) of the served UE encoded as \"groupIds\" attribute; and/or
14\. if a change of PC5 capablity for 5G ProSe occurred and the \"ProSe\"
feature defined in clause 5.8 is supported, the PC5 capability for 5G ProSe
encoded as \"proSeCapab\" attribute.
15\. if a change of the connectivity state of the UE occurred and the
\"ConnectivityStateChange\" feature defined in clause 5.8 is supported, the
connectivity state of the served UE encoded as \"connectState\" attribute;
and/or
16\. when a response with HTTP status code 4xx or 5xx as defined in clause
5.2.2.3.1.2 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [14] or a N1N2 Transfer Failure Notification as
defined in clause 5.2.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [14] is received by the V-PCF
after provisioning the UE policy by invoking the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation to the AMF, this UE
policy transfer failure notification encoded as \"uePolTransFailNotif\"
attribute;
17\. if the NF service consumer is an AMF, the \"SliceAwareANDSP\" feature is
supported, and the \"NON_3GPP_NODE_RESELECTION\" trigger is reported within
the \"triggers\" attribute, the wrongly selected non-3gpp access node encoded
as \"n3gNodeReSel\" attribute, and, in the roaming case, also the Configured
NSSAI for the serving PLMN encoded as \"confSnssais\" attribute;
18\. if satellite backhaul category change occurred and the
\"EnSatBackhaulCategoryChg\" feature defined in clause 5.8 is supported, the
satellite backhaul category or non-satellite backhaul encoded as
\"satBackhaulCategory\" attribute.
19\. for the roaming scenario, if the NF service consumer is an AMF,
Configured NSSAI change occurred and the \"NssaiChange\" feature is supported,
the configured NSSAI for the serving PLMN encoded as \"confSnssais\" attribute
and optionally the mapped each S-NSSAI value of home network corresponding to
the configured S-NSSAI values in the serving PLMN encoded as
\"mappedHomeSnssai\" attribute within the \"confSnssais\" attribute;
20 for the roaming scenario, if the NF service consumer is a V-PCF, the
\"URSPEnforcement\" feature is supported, and the URSP enforcement information
policy control request trigger is met, the URSP enforcement information within
the \"urspEnfReport\" attribute.
21\. for the roaming scenario, if the NF service consumer is a V-PCF the
\"VPLMNSpecificURSP\" feature is supported, the VPLMN AF guidance on VPLMN-

\"lboRoamingInfo\" attribute.
Upon the reception of the HTTP POST request:
\- if the PCF is a V-PCF and the V-PCF has an established policy association
with the H-PCF, the V-PCF shall determine based on the contents of a
potentially received \"uePolDelResult\" attribute to be sent to the H-PCF (see

received URSP enforcement information for one or more URSP rules.
NOTE 10: The \"URSP_ENF_INFO\" trigger only applies to the V-PCF in LBO
roaming scenarios and if the \"URSPEnforcement\" feature is supported.
\- \"LBO_INFO_CH\", i.e. LBO information change: The AMF reports LBO roaming
allowed or not allowed for the requested DNN(s) and S-NSSAI(s).
NOTE 11: The \"LBO_INFO_CH\" trigger only applies to the AMF and when the
\"VPLMNSpecificURSP\" feature is supported.
#### 4.2.3.3 Encoding of updated policy
Updated policies shall be encoded within the PolicyUpdate data type that may
include:
\- only when the updated policy is supplied by the H-PCF in the roaming
scenario, UE policy (see clause 4.2.2.2) encoded as \"uePolicy\" attribute,
and N2 PC5 policy for V2X communications (see clause 4.2.2.3) encoded as
\"n2Pc5Pol\" attribute and/or the N2 PC5 policy for A2X communications (see
clause 4.2.2.5) encoded as \"n2Pc5PolA2x\" attribute and/or the N2 PC5 policy
for 5G ProSe (see clause 4.2.2.4) encoded as \"n2Pc5ProSePo\" attribute;
\- when the updated policy is supplied via PCF of a PDU session by the (V-)PCF
in case of URSP provisioning in EPS, UE policy (see clause 4.2.2.2) encoded as
\"uePolicy\" attribute;
\- updated Policy Control Request Trigger(s) (see clause 4.2.3.2) encoded as
\"triggers\" attribute, i.e.:
1) either a new complete list of applicable Policy Control Request Trigger(s)
including one or several of the following:
a) Location change (tracking area);
b) Change of UE presence in PRA;
c) Change of PLMN, if the \"PlmnChange\" feature is supported;
d) Change of UE connectivity state, if the \"ConnectivityStateChange\" feature
is supported;
e) Change of Satellite Backhaul Category, if the \"EnSatBackhaulCategoryChg\"
feature is supported;
f) Change of configured NSSAI, in roaming scenarios, if the \"NssaiChange\"
feature is supported and the NF service consumer is the AMF; or
g) LBO information change, applicable to roaming scenarios, if the
\"VPLMNSpecificURSP\" feature is supported and the NF service consumer is an
AMF;
2) a \"NULL\" value to request the removal of all previously installed Policy
Control Request Trigger(s); and
\- if the Policy Control Request Trigger \"Change of UE presence in PRA\" is
provided or if that trigger was already set but the requested presence
reporting areas need to be changed, the presence reporting areas for which
reporting is required encoded as \"pras\" attribute encoded as follows:
a) A new entry shall be added by supplying a new identifier as key and the
corresponding PresenceInfo data type instance with complete contents as value
as an entry within the map.
b) An existing entry shall be modified by supplying the existing identifier as
key and the PresenceInfo data type instance with complete contents as value as
an entry within the map.
c) An existing entry shall be deleted by supplying the existing identifier as
key and \"NULL\" as value as an entry within the map.
d) For an unmodified entry, no entry needs to be provided within the map.
\- if the Policy Control Request Trigger \"LBO information change\" is
provided or if that trigger was already set but the requested LBO information
needs to be changed, the requested LBO information encoded in the
\"pduSessions\" attribute, a list of DNN and S-NSSAI combinations previously
provided is updated by providing either a new complete list within
the\"pduSessions\" attribute or by setting it to \"NULL\". If the
\"pduSessions\" attribute is not provided or the previously provided
\"pduSessions\" attribute is deleted, the LBO information change policy
control request trigger applies to any S-NSSAI and DNN combination.
#### 4.2.3.4 Feature renegotiation during AMF relocation
During the AMF relocation, if the new AMF received the resource URI of the
individual UE Policy from the old AMF and selects the old (V-)PCF, and the
feature \"FeatureRenegotation\" is supported, the new AMF shall invoke the
update of the UE policy association as described in clause 4.2.3.1 with the
following differences:
\- The new AMF shall include in the PolicyAssociationUpdateRequest data
structure sent in the HTTP POST request:
a. the \"FEAT_RENEG\" policy control request trigger within the \"triggers\"
attribute;
b. the \"suppFeat\" attribute with the AMF supported features; and
c. for each supported feature, the required feature information elements as
specified in clause 4.2.2.1, if applicable.
NOTE 1: When the new AMF received from the old AMF the subscription to policy
control request trigger(s) that depend on feature control, and a policy
control request trigger is met, the required feature information included in
the update request contains the report of the met policy control request
trigger within the \"triggers\" attribute and the associated information in
the corresponding attribute, when applicable.
\- Upon reception of the HTTP POST request, the (V-)PCF shall update the
\"Individual UE Policy Association\" resource, determine the applicable policy
and include in the PolicyUpdate data structure sent in the HTTP POST response:
NOTE 2: The determination of the applicable policy can consider the features
supported by the new AMF.
a. the \"suppFeat\" attribute with the negotiated supported features; and
b. the complete \"Individual UE Policy Association\" resource representation,
as specified in clause 4.2.2.1.
### 4.2.4 Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify Service Operation
#### 4.2.4.1 General
The (V-)(H)-PCF may decide to update policy control request triggers, and in
the roaming case, the H-PCF may decide to update the UE Policy, the V2X N2 PC5
policy, if the \"V2X\" feature is supported, and/or the A2X N2 PC5 policy, if
the \"A2X\" feature is supported and/or the 5G ProSe N2 PC5 policy, if the
\"ProSe\" feature is supported. The PCF (H-PCF in the roaming case) may decide
to request the termination of the policy association.
IIf the \"EpsUrsp\" feature is supported and the NF consumer is a PCF for a
PDU session the PCF (H-PCF in the LBO roaming scenario) may decide to update
policy control request triggers and/or to update the URSP. The PCF (H-PCF in
the LBO roaming scenario) may decide to request the termination of the policy
association.
The(V-)(H-)PCF shall then use an Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service
operation.
The following procedures using the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service
operation are supported:
\- Policy update notification.
\- Request the termination of the UE policy association.
\- URSP provisioning for background Data Transfer policy.
\- UE policy provisioning for V2X communications over PC5 and Uu reference
points.
\- UE policy provisioning for 5G ProSe.
\- N2 PC5 Policy (e.g. for V2X communications, for A2X communications, for 5G
ProSe) provisioning.
\- UE policy provisioning for A2X communications over PC5 reference point or
A2X communications over Uu reference point or both.
NOTE: The PCF derives the URSP and invokes the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation to provision it to
the UE.
\- URSP provisioning in EPS.
#### 4.2.4.2 Policy update notification
Figure 4.2.4.2-1 illustrates the policy update notification.
Figure 4.2.4.2-1: policy update notification
NOTE: For the roaming case, the PCF represents the V-PCF if the NF service
consumer is an AMF and the PCF represents the H-PCF if the NF service consumer
is a V-PCF.
The (V-)(H)-PCF may decide to update, based on external triggers (e.g.
notifications received from UDR about new or updated service parameter data as
described in 3GPP TS 29.519 [17]) or internal triggers (e.g., the activation
of a pending policy counter provided via the Nchf_SpendingLimitControl Service
as described in 3GPP TS 29.594 [33]) policy control request trigger(s) and in
the roaming case, the H-PCF may also decide to update the UE Policy, the N2
PC5 policy for V2X communications if the \"V2X\" feature is supported and/or
the N2 PC5 policy for A2X communications if the \"A2X\" feature is supported
and/or the N2 PC5 policy for 5G ProSe if the \"ProSe\" feature is supported.
NOTE: In this release of the specification, policy decisions based on policy
counters provided via Nchf_SpendingLimitControl service apply only for non-
roaming cases and UE policies refer to URSP only.
If the \"EpsUrsp\" feature is supported and the NF consumer is a PCF for a PDU
session the PCF (H-PCF in the LBO roaming scenario) may decide to update
policy control request triggers and/or to update the URSP.
If the SliceAwareANDSP feature is supported and the PCF has successfully
delivered the updated ANDSP/WLANSP to the UE with the slice information for
the corresponding non-3gpp node, the PCF may decide to notify the NF service
consumer about this successful delivery.
The (V-)(H-)PCF shall then send an HTTP POST request with
\"{notificationUri}/update\" as URI (where the Notification URI was previously
supplied by the NF service consumer) to the NF service consumer and the
PolicyUpdate data structure as request body encoded as described in clause
4.2.3.3.
Upon the reception of the HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer:
\- if the V-PCF is the NF service consumer, shall use the Namf_Communication
Service defined in 3GPP TS 29.518 [14] to send \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\"
message(s) with the received UE policy to the UE via the AMF and/or with the
received N2 PC5 policy for V2X communications and/or A2X communications and/or
5G ProSe to the NG-RAN via the AMF;
\- if the V-PCF is the NF service consumer, shall provision the received
policy control requested trigger(s) to the AMF, if applicable, using the
Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service operation according to the present
clause;
\- if the AMF is the NF service consumer, shall enforce the received policy
control request trigger(s);
\- if the \"EpsUrsp\" feature is supported and a PCF for a PDU session is the
NF service consumer, shall behave as specified in clause 4.2.4.8;
\- shall either send a successful response indicating the success of the
enforcement or an appropriate failure response, for the V-PCF as the NF
service consumer taking into consideration a reply received from the possible
Namf_Communication Service service operation and from the possible
Npcf_UEPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service operation according to the previous
bullets. In case of a successful response:
a. if the feature \"ImmediateReport\" is supported and the PCF provisioned the
policy control request triggers related to PLMN change, PRA change,
connectivity state change or location change, and/or the feature
\"EnSatBackhaulCategoryChg\" is supported and the PCF provisioned the policy
control request trigger related to change of satellite backhaul category,
and/or the feature \"URSPEnforcement\" is supported and the PCF provisioned
the policy control request trigger related to URSP enforcement information, a
\"200 OK\" response code and a response body with the corresponding available
information in the \"UeRequestedValueRep\" data structure shall be returned in
the response;
b.- otherwise, a \"204 No Content\" response code shall be returned in the
response; and
\- if errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, shall send an HTTP
error response as specified in clause 5.7; or
\- if the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NF service consumer
determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF
service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause
6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
If the feature \"ErrorResponse\" is supported and if the AMF as NF service
consumer is not able to handle the notification but another unknown AMF could
possibly handle the notification, it shall reply with an HTTP \"404 Not
found\" error response.
If the (V-)PCF receives a \"307 Temporary Redirect\" response, the (V-)PCF
shall resend the failed policy update notification request using the received
URI in the Location header field as Notification URI. Subsequent policy update
notifications, triggered after the failed one, shall be sent to the
Notification URI provided by the NF service consumer during the corresponding
policy association creation/update.
If the (V-)PCF becomes aware that a new AMF is requiring notifications (e.g.
via the \"404 Not found\" response or via Namf_Communication service
AMFStatusChange Notifications, see 3GPP TS 29.518 [14], or via link level
failures), and the (V-)PCF knows alternate or backup IPv4, Ipv6 Addess(es) or
FQDN(s) where to send Notifications (e.g. via \"altNotifIpv4Addrs\",
\"altNotifIpv6Addrs\" or \"altNotifFqdns\" attributes received when the policy
association was created or via AMFStatusChange Notifications, or via the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery Service specified in 3GPP TS 29.510 [13] (using the service
name and GUAMI obtained during the creation of the subscription) to query the
other AMFs within the AMF set), the (V-)PCF shall exchange the authority part
of the corresponding Notification URI with one of those addresses and shall
use that URI in any subsequent communication.
If the (V-)PCF received a \"404 Not found\" response, the (V-)PCF should
resend the failed policy update notification request to that URI.
#### 4.2.4.3 Request for termination of the policy association
Figure 4.2.4.3-1 illustrates the request for a termination of the policy
association.
Figure 4.2.4.3-1: request for a termination of the UE policy association
NOTE: For the roaming case, the PCF represents the V-PCF if the NF service
consumer is an AMF and the PCF represents the H-PCF if the NF service consumer
is a V-PCF.
The (V-)(H-)PCF may request the termination of the UE policy association and
shall then send an HTTP POST request with \"{notificationUri}/terminate\" as
URI (where the Notification URI was previously supplied by the NF service
consumer) and the TerminationNotification data structure as request body that
shall include:
\- the resource URI of the concerned individual UE policy association
(including the policy association ID) encoded as \"resourceUri\" attribute;
and
\- the cause why the (V-)(H-)PCF requests the termination of the policy
association encoded as \"cause\" attribute.
Upon the reception of the HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer:
\- if the V-PCF is the NF service consumer, shall send as NF service producer
for the corresponding policy association (towards the AMF as NF service
consumer) a request for a termination of the policy association according to
the present clause;
\- shall either send an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response for the succesfull
processing of the HTTP POST request or an appropriate failure response, for
the V-PCF as the NF service consumer taking into consideration a reply
received for the possible corresponding policy association termination request
according to the previous bullet; and
\- if errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, shall send an HTTP
error response as specified in clause 5.7; or
\- if the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NF service consumer
determines that the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF
service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause
6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
After the succesfull processing of the HTTP POST request, any NF service
consumer except for the V-PCF shall invoke the Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Delete
Service Operation defined in clause 4.2.5 to terminate the policy association.
If the AMF as NF service consumer is not able to handle the notification but
knows by implementation specific means that another AMF is able to handle the
notification, it shall reply with an HTTP \"307 Temporary Redirect\" response
pointing to the URI of the new AMF. If the AMF as NF service consumer is not
able to handle the notification but another unknown AMF could possibly handle
the notification, it shall reply with an HTTP \"404 Not found\" error
response.
If the (V-)PCF receives a \"307 Temporary Redirect\" response, the PCF shall
resend the failed request for termination of the policy association using the
received URI in the Location header field as Notification URI.
If the (V-)PCF becomes aware that a new NF service consumer (AMF) is requiring
notifications (e.g. via the \"404 Not found\" response or via
Namf_Communication service AMFStatusChange Notifications, see 3GPP TS TS
29.518 [14], or via link level failures), and the (V-)PCF knows alternate or
backup Ipv4, Ipv6 Addess(es) or FQDN(s) where to send Notifications (e.g. via
\"altNotifIpv4Addrs\", \"altNotifIpv6Addrs\" or \"altNotifFqdns\" attributes
received when the policy association was created or via AMFStatusChange
Notifications, or via the Nnrf_NFDiscovery Service specified in 3GPP TS 29.510
[13] (using the service name and GUAMI obtained during the creation of the
subscription) to query the other AMFs within the AMF set), the (V-)PCF shall
exchange the authority part of the corresponding Notification URI with one of
those addresses and shall resend the failed request for termination of the
policy association to that URI.
If the (V-)PCF received a \"404 Not found\" response, the (V-)PCF should
resend the failed request for termination of the policy association to that
URI.
#### 4.2.4.4 URSP provisioning for Background Data Transfer policy
If the \"EnhancedBackgroundDataTransfer\" feature is supported, after the UE
policy association establishment, the (Hâ€‘)PCF may receive the Background Data
Transfer Reference ID(s) notified by the UDR for the change of UE\'s
Application Data as defined in clause 6.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [17]. In this
case, the (H-)PCF shall retrieve the transfer policy corresponding to the
Background Data Transfer Reference ID(s) as defined in clause 5.2.8 of 3GPP TS
29.519 [17] and derive the URSP including the Route Selection Validation
Criteria for the UE as defined in clause 6.2.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.503 [40]. The
H-PCF shall provision the URSP to the V-PCF as defined in clause 4.2.4.2 and
then the V-PCF shall invoke the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service
operation to provision it to the UE. The (H-)PCF shall use the associated
S-NSSAI and DNN to store in the UDR the Background Data Transfer Reference
ID(s) in the UE\'s session management policy data as specified in 3GPP TS
29.519 [17].
#### 4.2.4.5 UE policy provisioning for V2X communication over PC5 and Uu
reference points
After the UE policy association establishment and if the \"V2X\" feature is
supported, the (H-)PCF may receive the service specific parameter information
notified by the UDR for the change of UE\'s Application Data as defined in
clause 6.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [17]. In this case:
\- for the roaming case, the H-PCF shall derive the V2XP and provision it to
the V-PCF as defined in clause 4.2.4.2; and/or
\- for the roaming and non-roaming case, the (V-)PCF shall use the
Namf_Communication Service defined in 3GPP TS 29.518 [14] to send \"MANAGE UE
POLICY COMMAND\" message(s) with the V2XP to the UE via the AMF.
#### 4.2.4.6 UE policy provisioning for 5G ProSe
After the UE policy association establishment and if the \"ProSe\" feature is
supported, the (H-)PCF may receive the service specific parameter information
via a notification on the change of UE\'s Application Data from the UDR, as
defined in clause 6.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [17]. In this case:
\- for the roaming case, the H-PCF shall derive the ProSeP and provision it to
the V-PCF as defined in clause 4.2.4.2; and/or
\- for the roaming and non-roaming case, the (H-)PCF shall derive the ProSeP
and the (V-)PCF shall use the Namf_Communication Service defined in 3GPP TS
29.518 [14] to convey it to the UE via the AMF by sending \"MANAGE UE POLICY
COMMAND\" message(s) as defined in 3GPP TS 24.554 [28].
#### 4.2.4.7 UE policy provisioning for AF-influenced URSP
If the \"AfGuideURSP\" feature is supported by the Nudr_DataRepository
service, after the UE policy association establishment, the (H-)PCF may be
informed that service specific parameter information that contains data for AF
guidance on the URSP determination has been created, modified or removed via a
notification by the UDR for the change or removal of UE\'s Application Data as
defined in clause 6.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [17]. In this case, the H-PCF may
derive new URSP(s), modify existing URSP(s) or remove existing URSP(s) by
using the information received from the UDR (see clause 4.2.2.2.1.1 and
4.2.2.2.3 for the description of how the (H-)PCF may use this information,
stored UPSC(s), policy subscription information, analytics information
received from NWDAF and local operator policy to determine the URSP that will
be provisioned to the UE), and it shall:
\- for the roaming case, provision the derived new UE Policy Sections, and/or
update and/or remove existing UE Policy Sections to the V-PCF as defined in
clause 4.2.4.2 and then the V-PCF shall invoke the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer service operation to provision the
received UE Policy Sections to the UE; or
\- for the non-roaming case, use the Namf_Communication Service defined in
3GPP TS 29.518 [14] to convey the derived new UE Policy Sections and/or to
update and/or remove existing UE Policy Sections to the UE via the AMF within
\"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" message(s).
When the (H-)PCF receives the \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMPLETE\" or the \"MANAGE UE
POLICY COMMAND REJECT\" message or deducts that the UE is temporarily
unreachable and determines that this message or the internal deduction
indicates a UE Policy Delivery outcome to which an NF service consumer has
subscribed via a request for service specific parameters, the (H-)PCF shall
invoke the Npcf_EventExposure_Notify service operation as defined in clause
4.2.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.523 [30].
When the AMF informs the (V-)PCF that the UE is temporarily unreachable (see
3GPP TS 29.518 [18]), the (V-) PCF may subscribe to \"CON_STATE_CH\" trigger
if not done before and reattempt the provisioning of URSP(s) when the UE
becomes reachable.
#### 4.2.4.8 UE policy provisioning for A2X communication over PC5 and A2X
communication over Uu reference point
After the UE policy association establishment and if the \"A2X\" feature is
supported, the (H-)PCF may receive the service specific parameter information
notified by the UDR for the change of UE\'s Application Data as defined in
clause 6.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.519 [17]. In this case:
\- for the roaming case, the H-PCF shall derive the A2XP and provision it to
the V-PCF as defined in clause 4.2.4.2; and/or
\- for the roaming and non-roaming case, the (V-)PCF shall use the
Namf_Communication Service defined in 3GPP TS 29.518 [14] to send \"MANAGE UE
POLICY COMMAND\" message(s) with the A2XP to the UE via the AMF.
#### 4.2.4.9 URSP provisioning in EPS.
When the \"EpsUrsp\" feature is supported and a PCF for a PDU session is the
NF service consumer, the PCF for the UE may provide a UE Policy Container
(with a \"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" message(s) with the UE policy to send to
the UE via the PCF for the PDU session) and/or an update in the Policy Control
Triggers applicable to the UE as described in clause 4.2.42.
1)- When the PCF for the PDU session receives a UE Policy Container from the
PCF for the UE, the PCF for the PDU session first shall select one of the
ongoing PDU sessions for the related UE in EPC, and shall use the
Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service operation defined in 3GPP TS 29.512
[31] to forward to the UE via SMF+PGW-C the UE Policy Container with the
\"MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND\" message(s) with the received UE policy.
2) When the PCF for the PDU session receives an update in the Policy Control
Request Triggers applicable to the UE, the PCF for the PDU session shall
determine whether an update on the current Policy Control Triggers need to be
sent to the SMF+PGW-C. In that case, the PCF for the PDU session shall select
one of the ongoing PDU sessions for the related UE in EPC, and shall provision
the received policy control requested trigger(s) to the SMF+PGW-C using the
Npcf_SMPolicyControl_UpdateNotify service operation according to 3GPP TS
29.512 [31].
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS how the PCF for the PDU session selects one of the
ongoing PDU sessions.
### 4.2.5 Npcf_UEPolicyControl_Delete Service Operation
Figure 4.2.5-1 illustrates the deletion of a policy association.
Figure 4.2.5-1: Deletion of a policy association
NOTE: For the roaming case, the PCF represents the V-PCF if the NF service
consumer is an AMF and the PCF represents the H-PCF if the NF service consumer
is a V-PCF.
The AMF as NF service consumer requests that the policy association is deleted
when the corresponding UE context is terminated, e.g. during UE de-
registration from the network.
During the AMF relocation, the old AMF shall invoke this procedure when:
\- the resource URI of the individual UE Policy Association resource is not
transferred to the new AMF; or
\- the new AMF informs the old AMF that the individual UE Policy Association
resource is not being reused.
The PCF for the PDU session as NF service consumer requests that the UE policy
association is deleted when:
\- all the PDU sessions related with the UE policy association are terminated;
or
\- the PCF for the PDU session receives an indication of RAT type change from
the SMF+PGW-C (from any of the related PDU sessions) and determines the EPS to
5GS mobility scenario applies.
To request that the UE policy association is deleted, the NF service consumer
(e.g. AMF) shall send an HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/npcf-ue-policy-
control/v1/policies/{polAssoId}\" as Resource URI.
Upon the reception of the HTTP DELETE request,
\- the (V-)(H-)PCF shall delete the policy association;
\- if the PCF is a V-PCF and has an established corresponding policy
association towards the H-PCF, the V-PCF shall send as the NF service consumer
towards the H-PCF a request for the deletion of that policy association as
described in the present clause;
\- the (V-)(H-)PCF shall send either an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response
indicating the success of the deletion or an appropriate failure response, for
the V-PCF as PCF taking into consideration a reply received for the possible
policy association deletion request according to the previous bullet; and
\- the (V-)(H-)PCF shall if errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE
request, send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7; or
\- if the feature ES3XX is supported, and the (V-)(H-)PCF determines the
received HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the (V-)(H-)PCF shall
send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[5].
Once the UE policy association is deleted, to unsubscribe to notifications of
N1 message for UE Policy Delivery Result, the (V-)PCF shall trigger the
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageUnsubscribe service operation towards the N1N2
Individual Subscription resource as specified in 3GPP TS 29.518 [14].
# 5 Npcf_UEPolicyControl API
## 5.1 Introduction
The Access and Mobility Policy Control Service shall use the
Npcf_UEPolicyControl API.
The API URI of the Npcf_UEPolicyControl API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards
the PCF shall have the Resource URI structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [6], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [6].

## 5.7 Error handling
### 5.7.1 General
For the Npcf_UEPolicyControl API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [6].
Protocol errors and application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [5] shall be supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP
status codes are specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table
5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Npcf_UEPolicyControl API.
### 5.7.2 Protocol Errors
No specific protocol errorsfor the Npcf_UEPolicyControl API are specified.
### 5.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Npcf_UEPolicyControl service are listed
in Table 5.7.3-1 and Table 5.7.3-2.
Table 5.7.3-1: Application errors when PCF acts as a server
* * *
Application Error HTTP status code Description USER_UNKNOWN 400 Bad Request
The HTTP request is rejected because the end user specified in the request is
unknown to the PCF. ERROR_REQUEST_PARAMETERS 400 Bad Request The HTTP request
is rejected because the set of information needed by the PCF for UE Policy
selection is incomplete or erroneous or not available for the decision to be
made. PENDING_TRANSACTION 400 Bad Request This error shall be used when the
PendingTransaction feature is supported and the PCF receives an incoming
request on a policy association while it has an ongoing transaction on the
same policy association and cannot handle the request as described in clause
9.2 of 3GPP TS 29.513 [7]. POLICY_ASSOCIATION_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found The HTTP
request is rejected because no UE policy association corresponding to the
request exists in the PCF. NOTE: Including a \"ProblemDetails\" data structure
with the \"cause\" attribute in the HTTP response is optional unless
explicitly mandated in the service operation clauses.

## 5.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [19] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [5], the access to the
Npcf_UEPolicyControl API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [20]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [13])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF service consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Npcf_UEPolicyControl API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [13], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF service consumer used for
discovering the Npcf_UEPolicyControl service.
The Npcf_UEPolicyControl API defines a single scope \"npcf-ue-policy-control\"
for the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
The present Annex contains an OpenAPI [10] specification of HTTP messages and
content bodies used by the Npcf_UEPolicyControl API.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API.
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification file contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900
[22] and clause 5.3.1 of the 3GPP TS 29.501 [6] for further information).
