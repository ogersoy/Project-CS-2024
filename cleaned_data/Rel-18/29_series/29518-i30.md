Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

#### 5.2.2.2 UE Context Operations
##### 5.2.2.2.1 UEContextTransfer
###### 5.2.2.2.1.1 General
The UEContextTransfer service operation is used during the following
procedure:
\- General Registration procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.2.2.2.2)
\- Registration with Onboarding SNPN (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause
4.2.2.2.4)
The UEContextTransfer service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer,
e.g. a target AMF, towards the AMF (acting as source AMF), when the target AMF
receives a Registration Request with the UE\'s 5G-GUTI included and the
serving AMF has changed since last registration, to retrieve the UE Context,
e.g. the UE\'s SUPI and MM Context, in the source AMF.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the target AMF) shall retrieve the UE Context by
invoking the \"transfer\" custom method on the URI of an \"Individual
ueContext\" resource identified by UE\'s 5G-GUTI, see clause 6.1.3.2.4. See
also Figure 5.2.2.2.1.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.1.1-1 UE Context Transfer
1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. target AMF, shall send a HTTP POST request
to invoke \"transfer\" custom method on an \"Individual ueContext\" resource
URI. The payload of the request shall be an object of
\"UeContextTransferReqData\" data type.
If UE Context Transfer is triggered by UE initial registration, mobility
registration, disaster roaming initial registration or disaster roaming
mobility registration, the NF Service Consumer, e.g. target AMF, shall set the
reason attribute to \"INIT_REG\" or \"MOBI_REG\" and include the integrity
protected registration request message which triggers the UE context transfer
in the payload.
2a. On success:
\- if the reason attribute is \"INIT_REG\" and integrity check is successful,
the (source) AMF shall respond with the status code \"200 OK\". The payload of
the response shall be an object of \"UeContextTransferRspData\" data type,
containing:
case a) the representation of the requested UE Context as follows:
\- without PDU Session Contexts associated to the access type indicated in the
request by the NF Service Consumer (e.g. target AMF); and
\- with PDU Session Contexts associated to the other access type, if the UE is
registered for the other access type in the (source) AMF, unless the source
AMF determines based on the PLMN ID or SNPN ID of the (target) AMF that there
is no possibility for relocating the N2 interface for non-3GPP access to the
(target) AMF;
or
case b) the representation of the requested UE Context only containing the
\"supi\" attribute, if the UE is registered in a different access type in the
(source) AMF and the source AMF determines based on the PLMN ID of the
(target) AMF that there is no possibility for relocating the N2 interface to
the (target) AMF.
\- If the reason attribute is \"MOBI_REG\" and integrity check is successful,
the (source) AMF shall respond with the status code \"200 OK\". The payload of
the response shall be an object of \"UeContextTransferRspData\" data type,
containing:
a) the representation of the complete UE Context including available MM and
PDU Session Contexts. The source AMF shall transfer the complete UE context
including both access types if the UE is registered for both 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses and if the target PLMN is the same as the source PLMN; or
b) the representation of the requested UE Context including the available MM
and PDU Session Contexts for the 3GPP access type, if the UE is registered for
both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in the (source) AMF and the source AMF
determines based on the PLMN ID or SNPN ID of the (target) AMF that there is
no possibility for relocating the N2 interface for non-3GPP access to the
(target) AMF.
NOTE: The source AMF can determine that it is not possible to relocate the N2
interface to the target AMF when both AMFs pertain to different PLMNs or
SNPNs.
The UE context shall contain trace control and configuration parameters, if
signalling based trace has been activated (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [30]).\ \ The NF
Service Consumer, e.g. target AMF, starts tracing according to the received
trace control and configuration parameters, if trace data is received in the
UE context indicating that signalling based trace has been activated. Once the
NF Service Consumer receives subscription data, trace requirements received
from the UDM supersedes the trace requirements received from the AMF.
The UE context shall contain analytics subscription parameters, if the
(source) AMF has created analytics subscription(s) towards NWDAF related to
the UE (see clause 5.2.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]). The NF Service Consumer,
e.g. target AMF, may take over the analytics subscription(s).
The UE context shall contain event subscriptions information in the following
cases:
a) Any NF Service Consumer has subscribed for UE specific event; and/or
b) Any NF Service Consumer has subscribed for UE group specific events to
which the UE belongs. In this case the event subscriptions provided in the UE
context shall contain the event details applicable to this specific UE in the
group (e.g maxReports in options IE).
The NF Service Consumer, e.g. target AMF, shall:
\- in case a) create event subscriptions for the UE specific events;
\- in case b) create event subscriptions for the group Id if there are no
existing event subscriptions for that group Id, subscription change
notification URI (subsChangeNotifyUri) and the subscription change
notification correlation Id (subsChangeNotifyCorrelationId). If there is
already an existing event subscription for the group Id, and for the given
subscription change notification URI (subsChangeNotifyUri) and subscription
change notification correlation Id (subsChangeNotifyCorrelationId), then an
event subscription shall not be created at the NF Service Consumer. The
individual UE specific event details (e.g maxReports in options IE) within
that group shall be taken into account.
\- for both the cases, for each created event subscription, allocate a new
subscription Id, if necessary (see clause 6.5.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]), and if
allocated, send the new subscription Id to the notification endpoint for
informing the subscription Id creation, along with the notification
correlation Id for the subscription Id change. If the UEContextTransfer
service operation is performed towards the old AMF as part of the EPS to 5GS
mobility registration procedure using N26 interface (see clause 4.11.1.3.3 of
3GPP TS 23.502 [3]), the target AMF may also initiate event subscription
synchronization procedure with UDM, as specified in clause 5.3.2.4.2, when
both the target AMF and the UDM support the \"ESSYNC\" feature.
NOTE: Subscription Id can be reused if the mobility is between AMFs of same
AMF Set.
If the UE context being transferred from the source AMF is the last UE context
that belongs to a UE group Id related subscription, then the source AMF shall
not delete the UE group Id related subscription until the expiry of that event
subscription (see clause 5.3.2.2.2).
The source AMF shall not transfer those PDU sessions which are not supported
by the target AMF, e.g. the MA-PDU sessions shall not be transferred if the
target AMF does not support ATSSS.
The UE context shall contain SNPN Onboarding indication, if the UE is
registered for onboarding in an SNPN as described in clause 4.2.2.2.4 of 3GPP
TS 23.502 [3]. The NF Service Consumer, i.e. target AMF, may start an
implementation specific timer to deregister the onboarding registered UE, i.e.
if the received UE context contains SNPN Onboarding indication.2b. On failure
or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.4.2-2
shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body shall contain a
ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the
application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.4.2-2.
###### 5.2.2.2.1.2 Retrieve UE Context after successful UE authentication
When a successful UE authentication has been performed after a previous
integrity check failure, the NF service consumer (e.g. the target AMF) shall
retrieve the UE context by invoking \"transfer\" service operation on the URI
of the \"Individual ueContext\" resource identified by UE\'s SUPI. The same
requirements in clause 5.2.2.2.1.1 shall be applied with following
modifications:
1\. Same as step 1 of figure 5.2.2.2.1.1-1, with following differences:
\- The {ueContextId} in the URI shall be composed using UE\'s SUPI, and
\- The \"reason\" attribute in request body shall be set to
\"MOBI_REG_UE_VALIDATED\", and
\- The request body shall not include registration request message from UE.
2\. Same as step 2a of figure 5.2.2.2.1.1-1, with following differences:
\- The (source) AMF shall skip integrity check and shall respond with the
status code \"200 OK \"with the UE Context excluding SeafData and including
available PDU Session Contexts
##### 5.2.2.2.2 RegistrationStatusUpdate
###### 5.2.2.2.2.1 General
The RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation is used during the following
procedure:
\- General Registration procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.2.2.2.2)
\- Registration with AMF re-allocation procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3],
clause 4.2.2.2.3)
The RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation is invoked by a NF Service
Consumer, e.g. the target AMF, towards the NF Service Producer, i.e. the
source AMF, to update the status of UE registration at the target AMF, thereby
indicating the result of previous UE Context transfer for a given UE (see
clause 5.2.2.2.1.1).
The target AMF shall update the NF Service Producer (i.e. source AMF) with the
status of the UE registration at the target AMF due to a previous UE Context
transfer. The NF Service Consumer (e.g. target AMF) shall use the HTTP method
POST to invoke the \"transfer-update\" custom operation on the URI of an
\"Individual ueContext\" resource, see clause 6.1.3.2.4. See also Figure
5.2.2.2.2.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.2.1-1 Registration Status Update

NOTE: AMF selects the same PCF instance for AM policy and for UE policy, as
described in clause 6.3.7.1, 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
> The NF service consumer shall include the smfChangeInfoList attribute
> including the UE\'s PDU Session ID(s) for which the I-SMF or V-SMF has been

> subscriptions included in analyticsNotUsedList IE for the UE.
>
> Once the update is received, the source AMF shall:
\- remove the individual ueContext resource and release any PDU session(s) in
the toReleaseSessionList attribute, if the transferStatus attribute included
in the POST request body is set to \"TRANSFERRED\" and if the source AMF
transferred the complete UE Context including all MM contexts and PDU Session
Contexts. The source AMF may choose to start a timer to supervise the release
of the UE context resource and may keep the individual ueContext resource
until the timer expires. If the pcfReselectedInd is set to true, the source
AMF shall terminate the AM Policy Association and/or the UE Policy Association
that the source AMF has to the old PCF.
\- keep the UE context only including the MM context and PDU session(s)
associated to the non-3GPP access, if the transferStatus attribute included in
the POST request body is set to \" TRANSFERRED\" and if the source AMF did not
transfer the MM context and PDU Session Contexts for the non-3GPP access type;
the AMF shall release any PDU session(s) in the toReleaseSessionList
attribute. The source AMF may choose to start a timer and keep the MM context
and PDU session(s) associated to the 3GPP access until the timer expires.
\- keep the UE Context as if the context transfer procedure had not happened
if the transferStatus attribute included in the POST request body is set to
\"NOT_TRANSFERRED\".
2a. On Success: The source AMF shall respond with the status code \"200 OK\"
if the request is accepted. If the smfChangeInfoList attribute was received in
the request, the source AMF shall release the SM context at the I-SMF or V-SMF
only, for all the PDU sessions listed in the smfChangeInfoList attribute with
the smfChangeIndication attribute set to \"CHANGED\" or \"REMOVED\".
If some PDU sessions are not supported by the target AMF and thus not
transferred to the target AMF, the source AMF shall release these PDU sessions
after this step.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.5.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.5.2-2, where
applicable.
##### 5.2.2.2.3 CreateUEContext
###### 5.2.2.2.3.1 General
The CreateUEContext service operation is used during the following procedure:
\- Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause
4.9.1.3, and clause 4.23.7)
The CreateUEContext service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer,
e.g. a source AMF, towards the AMF (acting as target AMF), when the source AMF
_can\'t serve the UE and selects the target AMF during the handover procedure_
, to create the UE Context in the target AMF.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the source AMF) shall create the UE Context by
using the HTTP PUT method with the URI of the \"Individual UeContext\"
resource (See clause 6.1.3.2.3.1). See also Figure 5.2.2.2.3.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.3.1-1 Create UE Context
1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. source AMF, shall send a PUT request, to
create the ueContext in the target AMF. The payload body of the PUT request
shall contain a UeContextCreateData structure, including a N2 Information
Notification callback URI.
The UE context shall contain trace control and configuration parameters, if
signalling based trace has been activated (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [30]).
The source AMF shall transfer the complete UE context including both access
types if the UE is registered for both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses and if the
target PLMN is the same as the source PLMN.
The source AMF shall transfer only UE context for 3GPP access if the source
AMF determines there is no possibility for relocating the N2 interface for
non-3GPP access to the (target) AMF, e.g. when the target AMF is in another
PLMN.
For a UE supporting 5G-SRVCC, the NF Service Consumer (i.e. AMF) shall include
the Mobile Station Classmark 2, STN-SR, C-MSISDN and Supported Codec List in
the request, if available, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
The UE context shall contain analytics subscription parameters, if the
(source) AMF has created analytics subscription(s) towards NWDAF related to
the UE (see clause 5.2.2.2.11 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]). The NF service producer,
e.g. target AMF, may take over the analytics subscription(s).
The UE context shall contain SNPN Onboarding indication and the target AMF
shall support SNPN Onboarding, if the UE is registered for onboarding in an
SNPN as described in clause 4.2.2.2.4 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
2a. On success, the target AMF shall respond with the status code \"201
Created\" if the request is accepted, together with a HTTP Location header to
provide the location of a newly created resource. The payload body of the PUT
response shall contain the representation of the created UE Context. If the
target AMF selects a new PCF for AM Policy other than the one which was
included in the UeContext by the old AMF, the target AMF shall set
pcfReselectedInd to true. If the pcfReselectedInd is set to true, the source
AMF shall terminate the AM Policy Association to the old PCF.
The target AMF starts tracing according to the received trace control and
configuration parameters, if trace data is received in the UE context
indicating that signalling based trace has been activated. Once the AMF
receives subscription data, trace requirements received from the UDM
supersedes the trace requirements received from the NF Service Consumer.
If the target AMF receives analytics subscription parameters from the source
AMF, and one or more analytics subscription(s) are not taken over by the
target AMF, the target AMF shall include these analytics subscription(s) in
the analyticsNotUsedList IE. The source AMF may unsubscribe the analytics
subscriptions included in analyticsNotUsedList IE for the UE.
The UE context shall contain event subscriptions information in the following
cases:
a) Any NF Service Consumer has subscribed for UE specific event; and/or
b) Any NF Service Consumer has subscribed for UE group specific events to
which the UE belongs. In this case the event subscriptions provided in the UE
context shall contain the event details applicable to this specific UE in the
group (e.g maxReports in options IE).
The target AMF shall:
\- in case a) create event subscriptions for the UE specific events;
\- in case b) create event subscriptions for the group Id if there are no
existing event subscriptions for that group Id, subscription change
notification URI (subsChangeNotifyUri) and the subscription change
notification correlation Id (subsChangeNotifyCorrelationId). If there is
already an existing event subscription for the group Id and for the given
subscription change notification URI (subsChangeNotifyUri) and subscription Id
change notification correlation Id (subsChangeNotifyCorrelationId), then an
event subscription shall not be created at the target AMF. The individual UE
specific event details (e.g maxReports in options IE) within that group shall
be taken into account.
\- for both the cases, for each created event subscription, allocate a new
subscription Id, if necessary (see clause 6.5.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]), and if
allocated send the new subscription Id to the notification endpoint for
informing the subscription Id creation, along with the notification
correlation Id for the subscription Id change.
NOTE: Subscription Id can be reused if the mobility is between AMFs of same
AMF Set.
If the UE context being transferred from the NF service consumer (e.g. source
AMF) is the last UE context that belongs to a UE group Id related
subscription, then the NF service consumer (e.g. source AMF) shall not delete
the UE group Id related subscription until the expiry of that event
subscription (see clause 5.3.2.2.2).
If the target AMF receives SNPN Onboarding indication from the source AMF, the
target AMF may start an implementation specific timer to deregister the
onboarding registered UE, i.e. if the received UE context contains SNPN
Onboarding indication.
The source AMF shall:release those PDU sessions not supported by the target
AMF and thus not transferred to the target AMF.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a UeContextCreateError structure, including:
\- a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the
application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3. The cause in the error
attribute shall be set to HANDOVER_FAILURE, if all of the PDU sessions are
failed, e.g. no response from the SMF within a maximum wait timer;
\- NgAPCause, if available;
\- N2 information carrying the Target to Source Failure Transparent Container,
if this information has been received from the target NG-RAN and if the source
AMF supports the NPN feature.
###### 5.2.2.2.3.2 Create UE Context with AMF Relocation
During inter-PLMN N2 Handover, the initial AMF may relocate the UE context to
a target AMF (e.g. due to slices cannot be served by initial AMF). This clause
describes the procedure for this scenario.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the source AMF) shall create the UE Context by
using the HTTP PUT method with the URI of the \"Individual UeContext\"
resource (See clause 6.1.3.2.3.1). See also Figure 5.2.2.2.3.2-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.3.2-1 Create UE Context with AMF Relocation
Same requirement of clause 5.2.2.2.3.1 applies, with following modifications:
1\. Same as step 1 of clause 5.2.2.2.3.1.
2\. The initial AMF selects a target AMF and perform CreateUeContext procedure
(see clause 5.2.2.2.3.1).
\- the request body shall include the information received from the source AMF
in step 1, including the serving network, the supported features, etc.
\- if the received serving network (from the source AMF) is different from the
PLMN of the target AMF, the resource URI in the Location header in 201 Create
response shall contain the inter-PLMN API Root.
3a. Same as step 2a of clause 5.2.2.2.3.1, with following modifications:
\- the request body shall contain the UE Context and other information
received from the target AMF in step 2.
\- the Location header shall contain the resource URI received in the \"201
Created\" response from target AMF in step 2.
\- the initial AMF shall insert a 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id header indicating the
target AMF.
3b. Same as step 2b of clause 5.2.2.2.3.1.
##### 5.2.2.2.4 ReleaseUEContext
###### 5.2.2.2.4.1 General
The ReleaseUEContext service operation is used during the following procedure:
\- Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover, Cancel procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502
[3], clause 4.9.1.4)
The ReleaseUEContext service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer,
e.g. a source AMF, towards the AMF (acting as target AMF), when the source AMF
_receives the Handover Cancel from the 5G-AN during the handover procedure_ ,
to release the UE Context in the target AMF.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the source AMF) shall release the UE Context by
using the HTTP \"release\" custom operation with the URI of the \"Individual
UeContext\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.2.4.2). See also Figure 5.2.2.2.4.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.4.1-1 Release UE Context
1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. source AMF, shall send a POST request, to
release the ueContext in the target AMF. The payload body of the POST request
shall contain the UEContextRelease.
2a. On success, the target AMF shall return \"204 No Content\" with an empty
payload body in the POST response.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.2.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.2.2-2.
##### 5.2.2.2.5 RelocateUEContext
###### 5.2.2.2.5.1 General
The RelocateUEContext service operation is used during the following
procedure:
\- EPS to 5GS handover using N26 interface with AMF re-allocation (see 3GPP TS
23.502 [3], clause 4.11.1.2.2).
The RelocateUEContext service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer,
e.g. an initial AMF, towards the AMF (acting as target AMF), during an EPS to
5GS handover with AMF re-allocation, to relocate the UE Context in the target
AMF.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the initial AMF) shall relocate the UE Context
in the target AMF by invoking the \"relocate\" custom method on the URI of an
\"Individual ueContext\" resource (see clause 6.1.3.2.4). See also Figure
5.2.2.2.5.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.5.1-1 Relocate UE Context
1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. initial AMF, shall send a POST request to
relocate the UE context in the target AMF. The payload body of the POST
request shall contain a UeContextRelocateData structure.
The UE context shall contain trace control and configuration parameters, if
signalling based trace has been activated (see 3GPP TS 32.422 [30]).
For an EPS to 5GS handover procedure, the NF Service Consumer shall carry per
PDU session the S-NSSAI for serving PLMN, the MME Control Plane Address and
the TEID in the request. If S-NSSAI for interworking is configured and used in
initial AMF for the PDU session, the initial AMF shall also carry the
configured S-NSSAI for interworking to the target AMF, as specified in clause
4.11.1.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]. In Home Routed roaming case, the S-NSSAI for
serving PLMN is derived by the initial AMF based on the S-NSSAI for home PLMN
retrieved from SMF+PGW-C, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
2a. On success, the target AMF shall respond with the status code \"201
Created\" if the request is accepted, together with a HTTP Location header to
provide the location of the newly created resource. The payload body of the
POST response shall contain the representation of the created UE Context.
The target AMF starts tracing according to the received trace control and
configuration parameters, if trace data is received in the UE context
indicating that signalling based trace has been activated. Once the AMF
receives subscription data, trace requirements received from the UDM
supersedes the trace requirements received from the NF Service Consumer.
2b. On failure to relocate the UE context or redirection, one of the HTTP
status code listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.6.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx
response, the message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the
\"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.6.2-2.\ \ If the target RAN rejects the Handover Request, the target
AMF shall send Forward Relocation Response message directly to the source MME
over the N26 interface, carrying the appropriate cause value.
##### 5.2.2.2.6 CancelRelocateUEContext
###### 5.2.2.2.6.1 General
The CancelRelocateUEContext service operation is used during the following
procedure:
\- EPS to 5GS Handover with AMF re-allocation, Handover Cancel procedure (see
3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.11.1.2.3)
The CancelRelocateUEContext service operation is invoked by a NF Service
Consumer (i.e. initial AMF), towards the AMF (acting as target AMF), when the
initial AMF _receives Forward Cancel Request from the source MME during EPS to
5GS Handover with AMF re-allocation porceudre, to trigger the target AMF to
release_ the UE Context.
The NF Service Consumer (i.e. the initial AMF) shall cancel the UE Context
Relocation by using the HTTP \"cancel-relocate\" custom operation with the URI
of the \"Individual UeContext\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.2.4.2). See also
Figure 5.2.2.2.6.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.6.1-1 Cancel Relocate UE Context
1\. The NF Service Consumer, i.e. initial AMF, shall send a POST request, to
release the ueContext in the target AMF. The payload body of the POST request
shall contain the UeContextCancelRelocateData that needs to be passed to the
target AMF.
2a. On success, the target AMF shall return \"204 No Content\" with an empty
payload body in the POST response.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.7.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.7.2-2.

which the LMF requests to transfer an LPP message to the UE.
During an intra-AMF handover between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, the SMF shall
include the targetAccess IE set to the old access type in the HTTP Request
message body, when releasing the N2 PDU session resources in the old access
(see step 3 of Figure 4.9.2.1-1 and step 3 of Figure 4.9.2.2-1 of 3GPP TS
23.502 [3]).
Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1 N1N2MessageTransfer for UE related signalling
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to transfer N1 and N2
information. The NF Service Consumer may include a N1N2MessageTransfer
Notification URI to AMF in the request message.
2a. On success, i.e. if the request is accepted and the AMF is able to
transfer the N1/N2 message to the UE and/or the AN, the AMF shall respond with
a \"200 OK\" status code. The AMF shall set the cause IE in the
N1N2MessageTransferRspData as \"N1_N2_TRANSFER_INITIATED\" in this case.
The AMF shall respond with a \"200 OK\" status code and set the cause IE in
the N1N2MessageTransferRspData to \"N2_MSG_NOT_TRANSFERRED\", if the
N1N2MessageTransfer request included an area of validity for the N2 SM
Information, the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state and outside of the area of
validity.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.5.3.1-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a N1N2MessageTransferError structure, including:
\- a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the
application error listed in Table 6.1.3.5.3.1-2;
###### 5.2.2.3.1.2 Detailed behaviour of the AMF
When an NF service consumer is requesting to send N1 and/or N2 information and
the UE is in CM-IDLE state for the access type for which the N1 and/or N2
information is related (called \"associated access type\" hereafter in this
clause), the requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.1.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:
NOTE: N1 and/or N2 Session Management information is related to the access
type of the targeted PDU session for a single access PDU session, or to the
Target Access received in the request for a MA PDU session; LCS related N2
(NRPPa) information is related to 3GPP access in this release of
specification.
4xx and 5xx response cases shall also apply to UEs in CM-CONNECTED state, when
applicable.
**2xx Response Cases:**
**Case A: When UE is CM-IDLE in 3GPP access and the associated access type is
3GPP access:**
a) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF should respond with the
status code \"200 OK\", if \"skipInd\" attribute is set to \"true\" in the
request body, with a response body that carries the cause
\"N1_MSG_NOT_TRANSFERRED\".
b) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"202 Accepted\", if the asynchronous type communication is
invoked and hence the UE is not paged, update the UE context and store N1
and/or N2 information and initiate communication with the UE and/or 5G-AN when
the UE becomes reachable. In this case the AMF shall provide the URI of the
resource in the AMF in the \"Location\" header of the response. In this
release, the URI shall only be used by NF Service consumer to correlate the
possible N1/N2 Message Transfer Failure Notification with the related N1/N2
Message Transfer Operation. The NF service consumer shall not send any service
requests towards the URI received in the Location header.
The AMF shall also provide a response body containing the cause,
\"WAITING_FOR_ASYNCHRONOUS_TRANSFER\" that represents the current status of
the N1/N2 message transfer;
c) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"202 Accepted\", if paging is issued when the UE is in CM-IDLE
and reachable for 3GPP access, with a response body that carries a cause
\"ATTEMPTING_TO_REACH_UE\" as specified in clause 4.2.3.3 and 5.2.2.2.7 of
3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
**Case B: When UE is CM-IDLE in Non-3GPP access but CM-CONNECTED in 3GPP
access and the associated access type is Non-3GPP access:**
a) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"200 OK\" with cause \"N1_N2_TRANSFER_INITIATED\" and initiate N1
NAS SM message transfer via 3GPP access, if the NF service consumer (i.e. SMF)
requests to send only N1 NAS SM message without any associated N2 SM
information, and the current access type related to the PDU session is
Non-3GPP access and the UE is CM-CONNECTED in 3GPP access.
b) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"202 Accepted\", if NAS Notification procedure is issued when the
UE is in CM-CONNECTED in 3GPP access, with a response body that carries a
cause \"ATTEMPTING_TO_REACH_UE\" as specified in step 4c of clause 4.2.3.3 and
5.2.2.2.7 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
**Case C: When UE is CM-IDLE in both Non-3GPP access and 3GPP access and the
associated access type is Non-3GPP access:**
All the bullets specified in Case A are applicable.
The NF Service Consumer shall not send any further signalling for the UE if it
receives a POST response body with a cause \"ATTEMPTING_TO_REACH_UE\" unless
it has higher priority signalling. In such a case the response shall include
the \"Location\" header containing the URI of the resource created in the AMF,
e.g. \".../n1-n2-messages/{n1N2MessageId}\". In this release, the URI shall
only be used by NF Service consumer to correlate the possible N1/N2 Message
Transfer Failure Notification with the related N1/N2 Message Transfer
Operation. The NF service consumer shall not send any service requests towards
the URI received in the Location header. The AMF shall:
\- store the N1 and/or N2 information related to 3GPP access and, when the UE
responds with a Service Request, shall initiate communication with the UE
and/or 5G-AN using the stored N1 and/or N2 information;
\- store the N1 NAS SM information related to Non-3GPP access if no N2
information was received and the AMF initiated paging towards the UE. Later
when the UE responds with a Service Request, the AMF shall initiate
communication with the UE using the stored N1 information via 3GPP access;
\- inform the SMF which invoked the service operation, that the access type of
the PDU Session can be changed from Non-3GPP access to 3GPP access as
specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.502 [16], when the UE responds
with a \"List Of Allowed PDU Sessions\" and the indicated non-3GPP PDU session
of the N2 (and N1 if received) information is included in the list; or
\- notify the NF which invoked the service operation, as specified in clause
5.2.2.3.2, if the Notification URI is provided, when the AMF determines that
the paging or NAS Notification has failed or when the UE responds with a
\"List Of Allowed PDU Sessions\" and the indicated Non-3GPP PDU session of the
N2 (and N1 if received) information is not included in the list.
**4xx Response Cases:**
\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with status
code \"409 Conflict\" in the following cases:
\- if the UE is in 3GPP access and there is already an ongoing paging
procedure with higher or same priority, the AMF shall set the application
error as \"HIGHER_PRIORITY_REQUEST_ONGOING\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
ProblemDetails structure of the POST response body. The AMF may provide a
retryAfter IE to the NF Service Consumer in order for the NF Service Consumer
to retry the request after the expiry of the timer. When the retryAfter IE is
provided, the NF Service Consumer shall not initiate the downlink messaging
until the timer expires. The AMF may also provide the ARP value of the QoS
flow that has triggered the currently ongoing highest priority paging, so that
the NF Service Consumer (e.g. SMF) knows that if any subsequent trigger
initiating downlink messaging for a QoS flow with the same or lower priority
happens.
\- if there is an ongoing registration procedure (see clause 4.2.3.3 of 3GPP
TS 23.502 [3]) the AMF shall set the application error as
\"TEMPORARY_REJECT_REGISTRATION_ONGOING\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
ProblemDetails structure in the POST response body; The AMF may provide a
retryAfter IE to the NF Service Consumer in order for the NF Service Consumer
to retry the request after a short period. When the retryAfter IE is provided,
the NF Service Consumer should not initiate new N1/N2 Message Transfer request
until the timer expires.
\- if this is a request to transfer a N2 PDU Session Resource Modify Request
or a N2 PDU Session Resource Release Command to a 5G-AN and if the UE is in
CM-IDLE state at the AMF for the Access Network Type associated to the PDU
session (see clauses 4.3.3 and 4.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and clause 5.3.2.1
of 3GPP TS 23.527 [33]), the AMF shall set the application error
\"UE_IN_CM_IDLE_STATE\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the ProblemDetails
structure in the POST response body.
\- if there is an ongoing Xn or N2 handover procedure (see clause 4.9.1.2.1
and 4.9.1.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]) the AMF shall set the application error
as \"TEMPORARY_REJECT_HANDOVER_ONGOING\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
ProblemDetails structure in the POST response body, if the AMF rejects the
request due to the on-going handover.
\- if the RAT Type is NB-IoT, and the UE already has 2 PDU Sessions with
active user plane resources, the AMF shall set the application error as
\"MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS_EXCEEDED\" in POST response body.
\- if Paging Restrictions information restricts the N1N2MessageTransfer
request from causing paging (see clause 4.2.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]) the AMF
shall set the application error as \"REJECTION_DUE_TO_PAGING_RESTRICTION\" in
the \"cause\" attribute of the ProblemDetails structure in the POST response
body.
\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"403 Forbidden\", if the UE is in a Non-Allowed Area and the
service request is not for regulatory prioritized service. The AMF shall set
the application error as \"UE_IN_NON_ALLOWED_AREA\" in POST response body.
\- The NF service consumer (i.e. the SMF) that receives this application error
may supress subsequent message (e.g. N1N2MessageTransfer) to the AMF for non
regulatory prioritized service. In this case, the NF service consumer (i.e.
the SMF) should subscribe the Reachability-Report event for \"UE Reachability
Status Change\" from the AMF, so as to get notified by the AMF when the UE
becomes reachable again.
\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"403 Forbidden \", if the NF service consumer (e.g. an LMF) is
requesting to send N1 LPP message to the UE and the UE has indicated that it
does not support LPP in N1 mode during registration procedure (see clause
5.5.1.2.2 and 5.5.1.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [11]). The AMF shall set the
application error to \"UE_WITHOUT_N1_LPP_SUPPORT\" in POST response body.
\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"403 Forbidden\", if the request body includes an nfId IE
indicating an SMF instance which is different from the stored SMF instance
hosting the SM Context of the PDU session. The AMF shall set the application
error to \"INVALID_SM_CONTEXT\" in POST response body. During procedures with
SM Context relocation, e.g. UE mobility procedures with I-SMF
insertion/change/removal, the AMF shall allow N1N2MessageTransfer from both
SMF instances holding the old and new SM Contexts.
The NF service consumer (i.e. the SMF) that receives this application error
shall remove the SM Context for the PDU session and release the PDU session
resource in (H-)SMF if available. The SMF shall not send a
SMContextStatusNotification to the AMF for the PDU session release.
\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"403 Forbidden \", if the NF service consumer (e.g. an LMF) is
requesting to initiate a positioning procedure towards a PRU (see clause
6.11.2 of 3GPP TS 23.273 [42]), i.e. the pruInd IE with the value true was
included in the request, but the UE is not a valid PRU. The AMF shall set the
application error to \"INVALID_PRU\" in POST response body.
**5xx Response Cases:**
\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with the
status code \"504 Gateway Timeout\", if the UE is currently unreachable (e.g.,
due to the UE in MICO mode, the UE using extended idle mode DRX or the UE is
only registered over Non-3GPP access and its state is CM-IDLE). The AMF shall
set the application error as \"UE_NOT_REACHABLE\" in POST response body. If
Extended Buffering Support Indication is received in the request, the AMF
shall include the Estimated Maximum Waiting time in the response body when the
message is rejected due to the UE in MICO mode or the UE using extended idle
mode DRX.
\- step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF may respond with the status code
\"504 Gateway Timeout\", if the UE is temporarily not responding (e.g., not
responding to the paging). The AMF shall set the application error as
\"UE_NOT_RESPONDING\" in POST response body. The AMF may provide a retryAfter
IE to the NF Service Consumer in order for the NF Service Consumer to throttle
sending further N1/N2 Message Transfer request for a short period. When the
retryAfter IE is provided, the NF Service Consumer should not initiate new
N1/N2 Message Transfer request until the timer expires.
##### 5.2.2.3.2 N1N2Transfer Failure Notification
The AMF uses this notification to inform the NF service consumer that
initiated an earlier
Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer, that the AMF failed to deliver the N1
and/or N2 message. The HTTP POST method shall be used on the notification
callback URI provided by the NF service consumer as specified in clause
5.2.2.3.1.2.
Figure 5.2.2.3.2-1 N1N2Transfer Failure Notification for UE related signalling
1\. If the NF service consumer had provided a notification URI (see clause
5.2.2.3.1.2), the AMF shall send a POST request to the NF Service Consumer on
that Notification URI when the AMF determines that:
\- the paging or NAS Notification has failed;
\- the indicated non-3GPP PDU session is not allowed to move to 3GPP access;
\- the UE has rejected the page as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] clause
5.38.4;
\- the delivery of the N1 message fails, e.g. in case the UE is in RRC
Inactive and NG-RAN paging was not successful or in case an Xn or N2 handover
is being triggered at the NG-RAN
The AMF shall include the N1N2MessageTransfer request resource URI returned
earlier in the N1N2MessageTransfer response if any (see clause 5.2.2.3.1.2),
otherwise a dummy URI (see clause 6.1.6.2.30), in the POST request body. The
AMF shall also include a N1/N2 message transfer cause information in the POST
request body and set the value as specified in clause 6.1.5.6.3.1.
The NF Service Consumer shall delete any stored representation of the
N1N2MessageTransfer request resource URI upon receiving this notification.
The AMF may also include a \"retryAfter\" IE in the POST request body in order
for the NF consumer to throttle sending further N1/N2 Message Transfer request
for a short period, e.g. to reduce unnecessary paging to an unresponding UE
for a period of time to save the RAN resources.
2\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a response with \"204 No Content\"
status code.
On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status codes together with the
response body listed Table 6.1.5.6.3.1-2 shall be returned.
##### 5.2.2.3.3 N1N2MessageSubscribe
###### 5.2.2.3.3.1 General
The N1N2MessageSubscribe service operation is used by a NF Service Consumer
(e.g. PCF) to subscribe to the AMF for notifying N1 messages of a specific
type (e.g. UPDP) or N2 information of a specific type. For the N1 message
class UPDP, a PCF shall subscribe for the N1 message notification with the AMF
to receive the N1 messages from UE that are related to UE Policy.
NOTE: Step 0 of clause 4.2.4.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] specifies that the PCF
can split the UPDP transfer towards UE into multiple units. One UE specific
callback URI is registered with the AMF by the PCF for the AMF to notify all
UPDP message responses from the UE to the same callback URI. As a result, an
explicit subscription per UE policy association is defined in stage 3 for this
purpose.
An NF Service Consumer (e.g. PCF) may subscribe to notifications of specific
N1 message type (e.g. LPP or UPDP) or N2 information type. In this case the NF
Service Consumer shall subscribe by using the HTTP POST method with the URI of
the \"N1N2 Subscriptions Collection for Individual UE Contexts\" resource (See
clause 6.1.3.3). See also Figure 5.2.2.3.3.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.3.3.1-1 N1N2 Message Subscribe
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to create a subscription
resource in the AMF for a UE specific N1/N2 message notification. The payload
body of the POST request shall contain:
\- N1 and/or N2 Message Type, identifying the type of N1 and/or N2 message to
be notified
\- A callback URI for the notification
2\. If the request is accepted, the AMF shall include a HTTP Location header
to provide the location of a newly created resource (subscription) together
with the status code 201 indicating the requested resource is created in the
response message.
On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status codes together with the
response body listed Table 6.1.3.3.3.1-3 shall be returned.
##### 5.2.2.3.4 N1N2MessageUnSubscribe
###### 5.2.2.3.4.1 General
The N1N2MessageUnSubscribe service operation is used by a NF Service Consumer
(e.g. PCF) to unsubscribe to the AMF to stop notifying N1 messages of a
specific type (e.g. LPP or UPDP).
The NF Service Consumer shall use the HTTP method DELETE with the URI of the
\"N1N2 Individual Subscription\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.7.3.1), to request
the deletion of the subscription for the N1 / N2 message towards the AMF. See
also Figure 5.2.2.3.4.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.3.4.1-1 N1N2 Message UnSubscribe
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request to delete an existing
subscription resource in the AMF.
2\. If the request is accepted, the AMF shall reply with the status code 204
indicating the resource identified by subscription ID is successfully deleted,
in the response message.
On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status codes together with the
response body listed Table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3 shall be returned.
##### 5.2.2.3.5 N1MessageNotify
###### 5.2.2.3.5.1 General
The N1MessageNotify service operation is used by an AMF notifying the N1
message received from the UE to a destination CN NF, and it is used in the
following procedures:
\- Registration with AMF re-allocation (see clause 4.2.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502
[3])
\- UE assisted and UE based positioning procedure (see clause 6.11.1 of 3GPP
TS 23.273 [42])
\- LCS Event Report, Event Reporting in RRC INACTIVE state procedures, LCS
Cancel Location and LCS Periodic-Triggered Invoke procedures (see clause 6.3
and clause 6.7 of 3GPP TS 23.273 [42])
\- UE configuration update procedure for transparent UE policy delivery (See
clause 4.2.4.3 in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3])
\- UE triggered policy provisioning procedure to request UE policies. (See
clause 6.2.4 in 3GPP TS 23.287 [47] and clause 6.2.4 in 3GPP TS 23.304 [51])
\- Procedures applicable to a PRU (see clause 6.17 of 3GPP TS 23.273
[42])NOTE: Though in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] the procedure is called \"UE
configuration update procedure for transparent UE policy delivery\", as per
3GPP TS 24.501 [11] clause 5.4.5.2.1, the UE initiated NAS transport procedure
is used.
The AMF shall use HTTP POST method to the N1 Notification URI provided by the
NF Service Consumer via N1N2MessageSubscribe service operation (See clause
5.2.2.3.3). See also figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1 N1 Message Notify
1\. The AMF shall send a HTTP POST request to the N1 Notification URI, and the
payload body of the POST request shall contain an N1MessageNotification data
structure with the subscribed N1 message.
2a. On success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned and the payload body of
the POST response shall be empty.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.5.4.3.1-3 shall be returned. The message body shall contain a
ProblemDetails object with \"cause\" set to one of the corresponding
application errors listed in Table 6.1.5.4.3.1-3.
###### 5.2.2.3.5.2 Using N1MessageNotify in the Registration with AMF Re-
allocation Procedure
In the Registration with AMF re-allocation procedure, the N1MessageNotify
service operation is invoked by a NF Service Producer, i.e. an Initial AMF,
towards a NF Service Consumer, e.g. the target AMF, which is selected to serve
the UE, by the initial AMF.
The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.5.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:
1\. The initial AMF discovers the NF Service Consumer (e.g. the target AMF)
from the NRF, and fetch N1 Notification URI from the default notification
subscription registered with \"N1_MESSAGE\" notification type and \"5GMM\" N1
message class (See Table 6.2.6.2.3-1 and Table 6.2.6.2.4-1 of 3GPP TS 29.510
[29].
NOTE: The alternate AMF is expected to have registered a callback URI with the
NRF.
2\. Same as step 1 of Figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1, the request payload shall include
the following information in the HTTP POST Request message body:
\- RAN NGAP ID and initial AMF name (the information enabling (R)AN to
identify the N2 terminating point);
\- RAN identity, e.g. RAN Node Id, RAN N2 IPv4/v6 address;
\- Information from RAN, e.g. User Location, RRC Establishment Cause and UE
Context Request;
\- the N1 message, which shall be the complete Registration Request message in
clear text if the UE has a valid NAS security context, or as the one contained
in the NAS message container IE in the Security Mode Complete message as
specified in clause 4.2.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [2];
\- the UE\'s SUPI and MM Context;
\- the Allowed NSSAI and if available the partially Allowed NSSAI, together
with the corresponding NSI IDs (if network slicing is used and the initial AMF
has obtained).
###### 5.2.2.3.5.3 Using N1MessageNotify in the UE Assisted and UE Based
Positioning Procedure
In the UE assisted and UE based positioning procedure, the N1MessageNotify
service operation is invoked by the AMF, towards the LMF, to notify the N1 UE
positioning messages received from the UE.
The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.5.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:
1\. If the corresponding N1 notification URI is not available, the AMF shall
retrieve the NF profile of the NF Service Consumer (e.g. the LMF) from the NRF
using the NF Instance Identifier received during corresponding
N1N2MessageTransfer service operation (see clause 5.2.2.3.1), and further
identify the corresponding service instance if Service Instance Identifier was
also received, and fetch N1 Notification URI from the default notification
subscription registered with \"N1_MESSAGE\" notification type and \"LPP\" N1
message class (See Table 6.2.6.2.3-1 and Table 6.2.6.2.4-1 of 3GPP TS 29.510
[29]).
2\. Same as step 1 of Figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1, the request payload shall include
the following information:
\- the N1 Uplink Positioning Message;
\- LCS correlation identifier.
###### 5.2.2.3.5.4 Using N1MessageNotify in the UE Configuration Update for
transparent UE Policy delivery
In the UE Configuration Update for transparent UE Policy delivery procedure,
the N1MessageNotify service operation is invoked by the AMF, towards the PCF
which subscribed to be notified with UPDP messages received from the UE.
The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.5.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:
1\. Same as step 1 of Figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1. The request payload shall include
the following information:
\- the UPDP message.
###### 5.2.2.3.5.5 Using N1MessageNotify in the LCS Event Report, Event
Reporting in RRC INACTIVE state procedures, LCS Cancel Location and LCS
Periodic-Triggered Invoke Procedures
In the LCS Event Report, Event Reporting in RRC INACTIVE state procedures, LCS
Cancel Location and LCS Periodic-Triggered Invoke procedure, the
N1MessageNotify service operation is invoked by the AMF, towards the LMF, to
notify the N1 UE LCS messages received from the UE.
The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.5.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:
1\. If the corresponding N1 notification URI is not available, the AMF shall
retrieve the NF profile of the NF Service Consumer (e.g. the LMF) from the NRF
using the NF Instance Identifier received during corresponding
N1N2MessageTransfer service operation (see clause 5.2.2.3.1), and further
identify the corresponding service instance if Service Instance Identifier was
also received, and fetch N1 Notification URI from the default notification
subscription registered with \"N1_MESSAGE\" notification type and \"LCS\" N1
message class (See Table 6.2.6.2.3-1 and Table 6.2.6.2.4-1 of 3GPP TS 29.510
[29]).
2\. Same as step 1 of Figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1, the request payload shall include
the following information:
\- the N1 Uplink LCS Message;
\- LCS correlation identifier;
\- indication of Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation if Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation is being used.
and may include serving cell ID if it is available;
NOTE: For the EventReport message and UE initiated CancelDeferredLocation
message, the AMF includes the deferred routing identifier received from UE in
N1 UL NAS TRANSPORT message as LCS correlation identifier. The LCS correlation
identifier can assist a serving LMF in identifying the periodic or triggered
location session if the same LMF had assigned the deferred routing identifier
or can indicate to the LMF that it is acting as a default LMF.
###### 5.2.2.3.5.6 Using N1MessageNotify in the UE triggered policy
provisioning procedure to request UE policies
In the UE triggered policy provisioning procedure, the N1MessageNotify service
operation is invoked by the AMF, towards the PCF which subscribed to be
notified with UPDP messages received from the UE.
The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.5.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:
1\. Same as step 1 of Figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1. The request payload shall include
the following information:
\- the UPDP message.
###### 5.2.2.3.5.7 Using N1MessageNotify in the procedures applicable to a PRU
In the PRU Association Procedure, LMF Initiated PRU Disassociation Procedure
or PRU Initiated PRU Disassociation Procedure, the N1MessageNotify service
operation is invoked by the AMF, towards the LMF, to notify the N1 PRU
messages received from the PRU.
The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.5.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:

for which the I-SMF or V-SMF has been changed or removed, if any, with for
each such PDU session, the related \"smfChangeIndication\" attribute set to
\"CHANGED\" or \"REMOVED\", if the I-SMF or the V-SMF is changed or removed
respectively.
\- the \"notifySourceNgRan\" attribute set to \"true\" during an Inter NG-RAN
node N2 based DAPS handover procedure, if the target AMF receives this
indication in the Handover Notify from the target NG-RAN node (see clause
4.9.1.3.3a of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]).
If any network slice(s) become no longer available and there are PDU
Session(s) associated with them, the target AMF shall include these PDU
session(s) in the toReleaseSessionList attribute in the payload. The
n2NotifySubscriptionId included in the notification payload shall be the UE
context Id.

6.1.3.7.3.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.7.3.2-3.
##### 5.2.2.5.2 AMFStatusChangeUnSubscribe
###### 5.2.2.5.2.1 General
This service operation removes an existing subscription to notifications.
The AMFStatusChangeUnSubscribe service operation is used during the following
procedure:
\- AMF planned removal procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.21.2.2)
It is executed by deleting a given resource identified by a
\"subscriptionId\". The operation is invoked by issuing a DELETE request on
the URI of the specific \" individual subscription\" resource (See clause
6.1.3.7.3.1).
Figure 5.2.2.5.2.1-1: NF Service Consumer Unsubscription to Notifications
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request to the resource URI
representing the individual subscription. The request body shall be empty.
2a. On success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned. The response body shall
be empty.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.7.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.7.3.1-3.
##### 5.2.2.5.3 AMFStatusChangeNotify
###### 5.2.2.5.3.1 General
This service operation notifies each NF Service Consumer that was previously
subscribed to receiving notifications of the status change of the AMF (e.g.
AMF unavailable). The notification is sent to a callback URI that each NF
Service Consumer provided during the subscription (see
AMFStatusChangeSubscribe operation in 5.2.2.5.1).
The AMFStatusChangeNotify service operation is used during the following
procedure:
\- AMF planned removal procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.21.2.2)
The operation is invoked by issuing a POST request to each callback URI of the
different NF Service Consumer.
Figure 5.2.2.5.3.1-1: AMF Notifications
1\. The AMF shall send a POST request to the callback URI. The request body
shall include the GUAMI(s) and the related status change, GUAMI(s) is
indicated by the NF Service Consumer during the subscription operation. For
network deployment without UDSF case, the target AMF Name which is to serve
the user of the indicated GUAMI(s) is also included.
2a. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the NF Service
Consumer.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.5.2.3.1-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.1.5.2.3.1-2.
#### 5.2.2.6 EBIAssignment
##### 5.2.2.6.1 General
The EBIAssignment service operation is used during the following procedures
(see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.11.1.4):
\- UE requested PDU Session Establishment including Request Types \"Initial
Request\", \"Existing PDU Session\", \"Initial emergency request\" and
\"Existing emergency PDU session\" (Non-roaming and Roaming with Local
Breakout (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.3.2.2.1).
\- UE requested PDU Session Establishment including Request Types \"Initial
Request\" and \"Existing PDU Session\" (Home-routed Roaming (see 3GPP TS
23.502 [3], clause 4.3.2.2.2).
\- UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (non-roaming and roaming
with local breakout) (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.3.3.2).
\- UE or network requested PDU Session Modification (home-routed roaming) (see
3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.3.3.3).
\- UE Triggered Service Request (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.2.3.2) to
move PDU Session(s) from untrusted non-3GPP access to 3GPP access.
\- Network requested PDU Session Modification, when the SMF needs to release
the assigned EBI from a QoS flow (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.11.1.4.3).
The EBIAssignment service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer, e.g.
a SMF, towards the NF Service Producer, i.e. the AMF, to request the AMF to
allocate EPS bearer ID(s) towards EPS bearer(s) mapped from QoS flow(s) for an
existing PDU Session for a given UE.
EBI allocation shall apply only to:
\- QoS flows of Single Access PDU Session(s) via 3GPP access supporting EPS
interworking with N26;
\- Qos flows of Multi-Access PDU Session(s) supporting EPS interworking with
N26, that are not only allowed over non-3GPP access.
EBI allocation shall not apply to:
\- PDU Session(s) via 3GPP access supporting EPS interworking without N26, or;
\- PDU Session(s) via non-3GPP access supporting EPS interworking;
\- GBR QoS flow(s) that are only allowed over non-3GPP access in Multi-Access
PDU Session(s) supporting EPS interworking.
The EBIAssignment service operation is also invoked by an NF Service Consumer,
e.g. an SMF, towards the NF Service Producer supporting the EAEA feature, i.e.
the AMF, to request the AMF to update the mapping of EBI and ARP, if the ARP
for a QoS flow that has already been allocated an EBI is changed during the
network requested PDU Session Modification.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the SMF) shall perform EBIAssignment service
operation by invoking \"assign-ebi\" custom operation on the \"individual
ueContext\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.2.4.3). See also Figure 5.2.2.6.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.6.1-1 EBI Assignment
1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. the SMF, shall invoke \"assign-ebi\" custom
method on individual ueContext resource, which is identified by the UE\'s SUPI
or PEI in the AMF. The NF Service consumer shall provide PDU Session ID and
ARP list as input for the service operation. If the NF Service Consumer
invokes this service operation to update the mapping of EBI and ARP for a QoS
flow to which an EBI is already allocated in the AMF, the NF Service Consumer
shall provide the PDU Session ID and modifiedEbiList.
2a. On success, the AMF shall assign EBI for each ARP in received ARP list, if
enough EBI(s) are available. If there is not enough EBI(s) available, the AMF
may revoke already assigned EBI(s) based on the ARP(s) and the S-NSSAI of the
PDU session for which the request was received, EBIs information in the UE
context and local policies. The AMF may only assign a subset of the requested
EPS Bearer ID(s), e.g. when other PDU Sessions with higher ARP have occupied
other available EPS Bearer IDs. If AMF has successfully assigned all or part
of the requested EBI(s), the AMF shall respond with the status code 200 OK,
together with the assigned EBI to ARP mapping(s), the list of ARPs for which
the AMF failed to allocate an EBI (if any) and the list of EBI(s) released for
this PDU session due to revocation based on ARP(s) and the S-NSSAI (if any).
If the request contains \"releasedEbiList\", the AMF shall release the
requested EBI(s). The AMF shall respond with the status code 200 OK and shall
include the EBI(s) released in the \"releasedEbiList\" IE of the POST response
body. The \"releasedEbiList\" in the request shall be handled before the EBI
assignment in AMF.
If the same EBI(s) are both in the \"releasedEbiList\"and \"assignedEbiList\",
the NF sevice consumer considers that EBI(s) have been released and
reassigned.
If the request contains \"modifiedEbiList\", the AMF shall store the
association of the assigned EBI and ARP pair to the corresponding PDU Session
ID. The AMF shall respond with the status code 200 OK and shall include the
EBI(s) with ARP updated in the \"modifiedEbiList\" IE of the POST response
body.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.3.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain an AssignEbiError structure, including:
\- a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the
application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.3.2-2;
\- a failureDetails which describes the details of the failure including the
list of ARPs for which the EBI assignment failed.
## 5.3 Namf_EventExposure Service
### 5.3.1 Service Description
The AMF may offer this service as a Service Producer to enable an NF to
subscribe to event notifications on its own or on behalf of another NF and get
notified about an event. The known Service Consumers are NEF, SMF, UDM, NWDAF,
DCCF, LMF, TSCTSF and GMLC. See also clause 5.34.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and
clauses 4.15.1, 4.15.3.2, 4.15.4.2 and 5.2.2.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause
6.2.2 in 3GPP TS 23.288 [38].
The following events are provided by Namf_EventExposure Service:
Event: Location-Report
A NF subscribes to this event to receive the Last Known Location or the
Current Location of a UE or a group of UEs or any UE, and Updated Location of
any of these UEs when AMF becomes aware of a location change of any of these
UEs with the granularity as requested.
This event implements the \"Location Reporting\" event in table 4.15.3.1-1 of
3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
[UE Type]{.underline}: One UE, Group of UEs, any UE
[Report Type:]{.underline} One-Time Report, Continuous Report (See NOTE 1),
Periodic Report (See NOTE 1 and 2)
[Input:]{.underline} UE-ID(s), \"ANY_UE\", optional filters: TAI, Cell-ID,
N3IWF, UE-IP, UDP-PORT, TNAP ID, TWAP ID, Global Line Id

3GPP access, most recent N3IWF node, UE local IP address and UDP source port
number for non-3GPP access, TNAP ID, TWAP ID, Global Line Id).
NOTE 1: Support of Continuous Report or Periodic Report should be controlled
by operator policy.
NOTE 2: For Periodic Report, UE Last Known Location is reported if the UE is
in CM-IDLE state when the report is being generated.
Event: Presence-In-AOI-Report
A NF subscribe to this event to receive the current present state of a UE or a
group of UEs or any UE in a specific Area of Interest (AOI), and notification
when a specified UE enters or leaves the specified area. The area could be
identified by a TA list, a NG-RAN node ID list, a cell ID list, an area ID or
specific interested area name like \"LADN\".
For one-time reporting or for the first notification of Continuously
reporting, the AMF shall generate the notification as following:
\- when the event subscription is targeting a UE or a group of UEs, the AMF
shall report the current presence status of the target UE(s);
\- when the event subscription is targeting any UE, the AMF shall only report
the UEs that are \"IN\" the Area of Interest (AOI); if no UE is currently
\"IN\" the Area of Interest (AOI), the AMF shall generate a report only
including the AnyUe indication (without any UE ID) and the subscribed AOI with
the presence status set to \"IN\". The NF consumer should consider other UEs
served by the AMF are \"OUT\" of the AOI or with \"UNKNOWN\" state.
In subsequent notifications, the AMF shall only report the UE(s) whose
presence status has changed compared to the previous notification sent by the
AMF.
If the event subscription indicates that the AoI may be adjusted based on the
UE\'s Registration Area, the AMF shall report that the UE is IN the AoI if the
UE is inside a Registration Area which contains at least one Tracking Area
that is contained within the Area of Interest (see clause 5.3.4.4 of 3GPP TS
23.501 [2] and clauses 4.15.9.3.2, 4.15.9.4, 5.2.2.3.1 and Annex D.1 of 3GPP
TS 23.502 [3]).
If the subscription to the Presence-In-AOI-Report event includes the \"RAN
timing synchronization status change event\" indication and the UE indicated
support for network reconnection due to RAN timing synchronization status
change, the AMF shall report the UE presence in AoI based on the most recent
N2 connection as described in clause 5.3.4.4 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and Annex
D.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].

Event: Reachability-Report
A NF subscribes to this event for \"UE Reachability Status Change\" to receive
the current reachability state of a UE or a group of UEs in the AMF, and
report for updated reachability state of a UE or any UE in the group when AMF
becomes aware of a reachability state change of the UEs between REACHABLE,
UNREACHABLE, REGULATORY_ONLY. The following conditions apply:
\- the AMF shall send a Reachability Report (\"UNREACHABLE\") if the Mobile
Reachable Timer expires (see clause 5.4.1.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]) or the UE
enters CM-IDLE when it is only registered over the Non-3GPP access (see clause
5.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]);
\- the AMF shall send a Reachability Report (\"REGULATORY_ONLY\") if the UE
becomes reachable only for regulatory prioritized service (see clause 4.15.4.2
of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]);
\- the AMF shall send a Reachability Report (\"REACHABLE\") when the UE
reachability state changes from any of the two above states to REACHABLE.
NOTE 3: The AMF does not send a Reachability Report (\"UNREACHABLE\") in
particular when the UE enters extended DRX cycle (see clause 5.31.7.2.2.3 of
3GPP TS 23.501 [2]), the UE enters power saving state (see clause 5.31.8 of
3GPP TS 23.501 [2]), the UE enters CM IDLE in MICO mode (see clause 5.4.1.3 of
3GPP TS 23.501 [2]), or when the UE does not respond to a paging request.
An NF subscribes to this event for \"UE Reachable for DL Traffic\" to receive
reports of a UE or a group of UEs when the UE becomes reachable for sending
downlink data. In this case, the event is detected when the UE transitions to
CM-CONNECTED mode or when the UE will become reachable for paging, as
specified in table 4.15.3.1-1, clauses 4.2.5 and 4.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
When reporting the \"UE Reachable for DL Traffic\", the AMF shall also
indicate the access types through which the UE is reachable.
NOTE 4: The AMF does not send an event report for \"UE Reachable for DL
Traffic\" immediately after an UECM Registration in UDM, if the AMF has
previously been indicated that reachability event will be detected at UDM. The
UDM will detect the UE reachability from the UECM Registration and send a
notification to the NF consumer (unless the UDM is indicated that the UE is
currently not reachable, as specified in clause 5.3.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.503
[35]), thus the notification report from AMF is omitted.
[UE Type]{.underline}: One UE, Group of UEs
[Report Type:]{.underline} One-Time Report, Continuous Report
[Input:]{.underline} UE ID(s), (optional) Reachability Filter
[Notification:]{.underline} UE ID, AMF Id, most recent reachability state
(REACHABLE/UNRACHABLE/REGULATORY_ONLY), access type(s) through which the UE is
reachable.
Event: Communication-Failure-Report
A NF subscribes to this event to receive the Communication failure report of a
UE or group of UEs or any UE, when the AMF becomes aware of a RAN or NAS
failure event.
This event implements the \"Communication failure\" event in table 4.15.3.1-1
of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], which is an unexpected termination of the
communication.
[UE Type]{.underline}: One UE, Group of UEs, any UE
[Report Type:]{.underline} One-Time Report, Continuous Report
[Input:]{.underline} UE ID(s), \"ANY_UE\", optionally filters: Area identifier
(a TA list, an area Id or \"LADN\")
[Notification:]{.underline} UE ID, RAN/NAS release code.
Event: UEs-In-Area-Report
A NF subscribes to this event to receive the number of UEs in a specific area.
A NF may ask AMF for the UEs within the area based on Last Known Location or
it may request AMF to actively look for the UEs within the area based on
Current Location.
This event implements the \"Number of UEs present in a geographical area\"
event in table 4.15.3.1-1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
[UE Type]{.underline}: any UE
[ Input:]{.underline} \"ANY_UE\", Area identified in a TA List or cell ID
list, optionally Ue in Area filters: UE Aerial Indication, Indication of PDU
session established for DNN(s) subject to aerial service, indication to omit
UE IDs in the event reports

(See NOTE 4), Periodic Report (See NOTE 4)
[Notification]{.underline}: Number of UEs in the area, and if eNA is supported
also the UE IDs
NOTE 5: For an Immediate Report, UE Last Known Location is used to count the
UEs within the area.
NOTE 6: Support of Continuous Report or Periodic Report should be controlled
by operator.
Event: Loss-of-Connectivity
An NF subscribes to this event to receive the event report of a UE or group of
UEs when AMF detects that a target UE is no longer reachable for either
signalling or user plane communication. Such condition is identified when
Mobile Reachable timer expires in the AMF (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]), when the
UE detaches, when AMF deregisters from UDM for an active UE and when UE
indicates Unavailability Period by including Unavailability Period Duration
during Mobility Registration or Deregistration procedure. If the UE is already
not reachable for either signalling or user plane communication when the event
is subscribed, the AMF reports the event directly, and shall include, when
applicable, the remaining value of Unavailability Period Duration to determine
the foreseen Loss of Connectivity time.
This event implements the \"Loss of Connectivity\" event in table 4.15.3.1-1
of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].

\- Notification URI, indicates the address to deliver the event notifications
generated by the subscription;
\- Notification Correlation ID, indicates the correlation identity to be
carried in the event notifications generated by the subscription;
\- List of events to be subscribed;
\- Event Types per event, as specified in clause 5.3.1.
The NF Service Consumer may include the following information in the HTTP
message body:
\- Immediate Report Flag per event, indicates an immediate report to be
generated with current event status;
\- Event Trigger, indicates how the events shall be reported (One-time
Reporting or Continuously Reporting).

to exist;
\- Sampling ratio, defines the random subset of UEs among target UEs, and AMF
only report the event(s) related to the selected subset of UEs;
\- partitioning criteria, that defines Criteria for partitioning UEs before
applying sampling ratio;
\- Periodic Report Flag per event, indicates the report to be generated
periodically;
\- Repetition Period, defines the period for periodic reporting;
\- Variable reporting periodicity information, defines the list of conditions
related to Reporting periodicity and the period per condition.
\- Event Filter per applicable event, defines further options on how the event
shall be reported;
\- Reference Id per event, indicates the value of the Reference Id associated
with the event to be monitored. If provided, the Reference Id shall be
included in the reports triggered by the event;
\- a notification flag as \"notifFlag\" attribute if the EneNA feature is
supported; and/or

1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to create a subscription
resource in the AMF. The payload body of the POST request shall contain a
representation of the individual subscription resource to be created. The
request may contain an expiry time, suggested by the NF Service Consumer as a
hint, representing the time upto which the subscription is desired to be kept
active and the time after which the subscribed event(s) shall stop generating
report.
2a. On success, the request is accepted, the AMF shall include a HTTP Location
header to provide the location of a newly created resource (subscription)
together with the status code 201 indicating the requested resource is created
in the response message. If the NF Service Consumer has included more than one
events in the event subscription and some of the events are failed to be
subscribed, the AMF shall accept the message and provide the successfully
subscribed event(s) in AmfEventSubscription. If the NF Service Consumer has
included the immediateFlag with value as \"true\" in the event subscription,
the AMF shall include the current status of the events subscribed, if
available (e.g. last known location information is included if the subscribed
event is LOCATION_REPORT). If the events with immediateFlag set to \"true\"
are subscribed by an NF service consumer on behalf of a third NF and the NF
service consumer has not indicated supporting of IERSR feature (see 6.2.8),
the notification will be sent to the third NF directly, i.e.
subsChangeNotifyUri is included in the event subscription, the current status
of the events subscribed shall not be included in response. The AMF shall
subsequently send a notification to the third NF including the current status
of the events subscribed.
If the NF Service Consumer has set the event reporting option as ONE_TIME and
if the AMF has included the current status of the events subscribed in the
response, then the AMF shall not do any subsequent event notification for the
events given in the AmfCreateEventSubscription parameter. If the NF Service
Consumer has set the event reporting option as ONE_TIME, the subscribed event
as LOCATION_REPORT and the immediateFlag is set to false or absent, the AMF
shall send an event notification to notify the current location of the UE
after the subscription; if the UE is in RM-REGISTERED and CM-IDLE state over
3GPP access and the UE does not respond to the paging, or if the UE is in RM-
REGISTERED over non-3GPP access, the event notification shall include the last
known location and the ageOfLocationInformation IE set to a value other than
\"0\", which indicates to the NF service consumer that the AMF returned the
last known location.
If the NF Service Consumer has set the CONTINUOUS or PERIODIC event reporting
option, the subscribed event as LOCATION_REPORT and the immediateFlag is set
to false or absent, the AMF shall send a first event notification to notify
the current location of the UE after the subscription is created and then
subsequent event notifications when the user location changes or according to
the requested period respectively; if at the time of the subscription creation
the UE is in RM-REGISTERED and CM-IDLE state over 3GPP access and the UE does
not respond to the paging, or if the UE is in RM-REGISTERED over non-3GPP
access, the AMF shall send the first event notification including the last
known location and the ageOfLocationInformation IE set to a value other than
\"0\", which indicates to the NF service consumer that the AMF returned the
last known location.
The response, based on operator policy and taking into account the expiry time
included in the request, may contain the expiry time, as determined by the
AMF, after which the subscription becomes invalid. Once the subscription
expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, it
shall create a new subscription in the AMF. The AMF shall not provide the same
expiry time for many subscriptions in order to avoid all of them expiring and
recreating the subscription at the same time. If the expiry time is not
included in the response, the NF Service Consumer shall consider the
subscription to be valid without an expiry time.
If the sampling ratio (\"sampRatio\") attribute is included in the
subscription without a partitioningCriteria, the AMF shall select a random
subset of UEs among target UEs according to the sampling ratio and only report
the event(s) related to the selected subset of UEs. If the
partitioningCriteria attribute is also included along with sampling ratio, the
AMF shall apply the sampling ratio on the group of UEs determined according to
the partitioning criteria.
If the AMF supports the EneNA feature and the \"notifFlag\" attribute is
included and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the request, the AMF shall mute the
event notification and store the available events. Additionally, if the AMF
also supports the ENAPH3 feature (see clause 6.2.8) and the NF service
consumer also included event muting instructions in the request, the AMF
should evaluate the received event muting instructions against to local
actions (if configured) and, if the subscription creation request is accepted,
the AMF may indicate the following information to the NF service consumer in
the response:
\- the maximum number of notifications that the AMF expects to be able to
store for the subscription;
\- an estimate of the duration for which notifications can be buffered.
If the NF service consumer is a UDM, the AMF and the UDM both support the
\"ESSYNC\" feature and the subscription is targeting a specific UE with
Reference Id(s) included in the subscription, the AMF shall locally store the
information that the event subscription is subject to the Event Subscription
Synchronization with UDM during EPS to 5GS mobility as specified in clause
5.3.2.4.2. During inter-AMF mobility procedures, the source AMF shall include
the \"eventSyncInd\" IE (in AmfEventSubscriptionAddInfo data type) with the
value \"true\" in the UE Context for the event subscriptions that are subject
to Event Subscription Synchronization with UDM.
If the subscription creation request targets a group of UE or any UE, the AMF
shall accept the request and create a subscription even if the AMF does not
currently serve any UE of the group or any UE respectively, unless other
reasons exist to reject the request.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.2.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.2.3.2.3.1-3.
If the subscription creation request targets a specific UE and this UE is not
served by the AMF (i.e. it is not known to the AMF), the AMF shall reject the
request with a 403 Forbidden response and the application error
\"UE_NOT_SERVED_BY_AMF\", unless the request can be redirected to another AMF
known to serve the UE (e.g. another AMF of the same AMF set).
If the AMF supports the EneNA and ENAPH3 features (see clause 6.2.8), the NF
service consumer sets the \"notifFlag\" attribute to \"DEACTIVATE\" and event
muting instructions in the request, but the AMF cannot accept the received
instructions, the AMF may reject the request with a 403 Forbidden response and
the application error \"MUTING_EXC_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".
##### 5.3.2.2.3 Modification of a subscription
The Subscribe service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer, e.g. NEF,
towards the AMF, when it needs to modify an existing subscription previously
created by itself at the AMF.
The NF Service Consumer shall modify the subscription by using HTTP method
PATCH with the URI of the individual subscription resource (see clause
6.2.3.3) to be modified.
See also Figure 5.3.2.2.3-1 below.
Figure 5.3.2.2.3-1 Modification of a Subscription
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a PATCH request to modify a
subscription resource in the AMF. The modification may be for the events
subscribed or for updating the event options.
2a. On success, the request is accepted, the AMF shall return the
representation of the modified subscription resource or its sub-resource
together with the status code 200 OK. When the PATCH request is for modifying
the expiry attribute of the options IE of the subscription, then the AMF based
on operator policies and taking into account the expiry time included in the
request, shall include an expiry time, after which the subscription becomes
invalid. Once the subscription expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to
keep receiving notifications, it shall create a new subscription in the AMF,
as specified in clause 5.3.2.2.2. The AMF shall not provide the same expiry
time for many subscriptions in order to avoid all of them expiring and
recreating the subscription at the same time.
The PATCH request may be used to modify the \"notifFlag\" attribute of the
options IE of the subscription, when both the AMF and NF Service Consumer
support the EneNA feature as defined in clause 6.2.8:
\- if the \"notifFlag\" attribute is set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the request and
the event notification is currently not muted, the AMF shall mute the event
notification and store the available events, or
\- if the \"notifFlag\" is set to \"RETRIEVAL\" in the request and the event
notification is currently muted, the AMF shall send the stored events to the
NF service consumer, mute the event notification again and store available
events; or
\- if the \"notifFlag\" is set to \"ACTIVATE\" in the request and the event
notification is currently muted, the AMF shall send the stored events to the
NF service consumer and stop muting the event notification.
In addition, if both the AMF and the NF service consumer also support the
ENAPH3 feature (see clause 6.2.8), the PATCH request modifies the
\"notifFlag\" attribute to \"DEACTIVATE\" and contains muting exception
instructions, the AMF should evaluate the received event muting instructions
against to local actions (if configured) and, if the subscription modification
request is accepted, the AMF may indicate the following information to the NF
service consumer in the response:
\- the maximum number of notifications that the AMF expects to be able to
store;
\- an estimate of the duration for which notifications can be buffered.
If the subscription requested to be modified targets a group of UE or any UE,
the AMF shall accept the request and modify the subscription even if the AMF
does not currently serve any UE of the group or any UE respectively, unless
other reasons exist to reject the request.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status codes listed in Table
6.2.3.3.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application errors listed in Table 6.2.3.3.3.1-3.
If the AMF cannot accept the received muting exception instructions, the AMF
may reject the request with a 403 Forbidden response and the application error
\"MUTING_EXC_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".
##### 5.3.2.2.4 Remove or add group member UE(s) for a group subscription
The Subscribe service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer, e.g. UDM,
towards the AMF, to remove or add group member UE(s) for an existing group
subscription.
The NF Service Consumer shall modify the subscription by using HTTP method
PATCH with the URI of the individual subscription resource (see clause
6.2.3.3) to be modified.
See also Figure 5.3.2.2.4-1 below.
Figure 5.3.2.2.4-1 Remove or add group member UE(s) for a group subscription
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a PATCH request to modify a
subscription resource targeting a group of UEs in the AMF. The modification
shall indicate the group member UE(s) to be excluded or added for the group
subscription.
2a. On success, the request is accepted, the AMF shall return the
representation of the modified subscription resource with the status code 200
OK.\ \ The AMF shall stop monitoring events for excluded member UE(s). If
Maximum number of Reports is applied, the AMF shall set the number of reports
of the indicated UE(s) to Maximum Number of Reports.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.2.3.3.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.2.3.3.3.1-3.
#### 5.3.2.3 Unsubscribe
##### 5.3.2.3.1 General
The Unsubscribe service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer, e.g.
NEF, towards the AMF, to remove an existing subscription previously created by
itself at the AMF.
The NF Service Consumer shall unsubscribe to the subscription by using HTTP
method DELETE with the URI of the individual subscription resource (see clause
6.2.3.3) to be deleted.
Figure 5.3.2.3.1-1 Unsubscribe a subscription
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request to delete an existing
subscription resource in the AMF.
2a. On success, the request is accepted, the AMF shall reply with the status
code 204 indicating the resource identified by subscription ID is successfully
deleted in the response message.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.2.3.3.3.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.2.3.3.3.2-3.
#### 5.3.2.4 Notify
##### 5.3.2.4.1 General
The Notify service operation is invoked by the AMF, to send a notification,
towards the notification URI, when certain event included in the subscription
has taken place.
The AMF shall use the HTTP method POST, using the notification URI received in
the subscription creation as specified in clause 5.3.2.2.2, including e.g. the
subscription ID, Event ID(s) for which event has happened, notification
correlation ID provided by the NF service consumer at the time of event
subscription, to send a notification. See Figure 5.3.2.4.1-1.
Additionally, the Notify service operation shall also be invoked by the AMF,
when:
\- there is a change of AMF during UE mobility procedures, if the subscription
Id changes (i.e. Registration procedures and Handover procedures), or
\- the subscription is terminated by the AMF, if event subscription
termination notification is requested by the NF consumer.
Figure 5.3.2.4.1-1 Notify
1\. The AMF shall send a POST request to send a notification.
2a. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the NF Service
Consumer.
2b. On failure or redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"403
Forbidden\") indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional
error information should be returned.
When the AMF received the following response code (and application error), the
AMF should consider the subscription is no longer valid and terminate the
subscription:
\- \"400 Bad Request\" with application error \"RESOURCE_CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND\"
\- \"404 Not Found\"
When AMF terminates the subscription in above scenarios, if the subscription
is created by the NF consumer on behalf of another NF (e.g. the UDM subscribes
to the AMF on behalf of the NEF) and notification of event subscription
termination is requested by the NF consumer, the AMF supporting the \'STEN\"
feature shall send a notification to the NF consumer (e.g. the UDM) to report
the termination of the subscription.
##### 5.3.2.4.2 Event Subscription Synchronization for specific UE
When the AMF and the UDM both support the \"ESSYNC\" feature, the AMF may
initiate synchronization for event subscriptions with the UDM for the specific
UE during EPS to 5GS mobility registration procedure (see clause 4.11.5.2 of
3GPP TS 23.502 [3]), if UE specific event subscriptions from the UDM are
available in UE Context.
To initiate event subscription synchronization, when sending notification for
subscription change to the UDM, the AMF shall include the event subscription
information in the notification request. If subscription change notification
is not needed, e.g. when UE registers to the same AMF after moving from EPS,
the AMF may send a notification to the subscription change notification URI.
The notification request in this case only includes the event subscription
information but no event report list.
The AMF shall only include active event subscriptions that are subject to
Event Subscription Synchronization with UDM (determined as defined in clause
5.3.2.2.2) in the event subscription information.
For each active subscription, the following information shall include:
\- URI of the subscription resource in the AMF; and
\- Notification Correlation Id of the subscription; and
\- list of Reference Ids, one per event in the subscription; and
\- optionally, the URI of old subscription resource on the source AMF, if the
subscription Id is changed during the mobility procedure.
When the UDM receives event subscription information from AMF, the UDM shall
compare the active event subscriptions in AMF with the active UDM Event
Exposure subscriptions using Reference Id(s) and Notification Correlation Id,
and perform the following:
\- if an event is to be detected by AMF but not existing in the AMF, the UDM
shall subscribe the event in AMF by creating a new AMF event subscription or
updating an existing AMF event subscription;
\- if an event exists in AMF but does not exist in UDM, the UDM shall
unsubscribe the event from AMF by removing or update an AMF event
subscription.
When the AMF identified that event synchronization with UDM is required, but
either the UDM or the AMF or both do not support the \"ESSYNC\" feature, the
AMF may require the UDM to re-subscribe the stored event exposure
subscriptions to the AMF, see clause 5.3.2.2.2 and 5.3.2.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.503
[35].
## 5.4 Namf_MT Service
### 5.4.1 Service Description

send MT signalling or data to a target UE. The following are the key
functionalities of this NF service:
\- enabling UE reachability by:
\- paging the UE if the UE is in CM-IDLE state and responding to the requester
NF after the UE enters CM-CONNECTED state, or
\- responding to the requester NF if UE is in CM-CONNECTED state.
\- providing the terminating domain selection information for IMS voice to the
consumer NF.
\- enabling reachability of a list of UEs by:
\- paging UEs for an MBS session if the UEs are in CM-IDLE state, and
\- responding to the requester NF, including the list of UEs that are already
in CM-CONNECTED state if any, and
\- sending notification with the UE reachability information and user location
information to NF consumers.
### 5.4.2 Service Operations
#### 5.4.2.1 Introduction
For the Namf_MT Service the following service operations are defined:
\- EnableUEReachability
\- ProvideDomainSelectionInfo
\- EnableGroupReachability
\- UEReachabilityInfoNotify
#### 5.4.2.2 EnableUEReachability
##### 5.4.2.2.1 General
The EnableUEReachability service operation is used in the following procedure:
\- MT SMS over NAS in CM-IDLE state (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], clause 4.13.3.6),

Optimisation (see clause 4.24.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]).
\- Network Triggered Connection Resume in RRC Inactive with CN based MT
communication handling (see clause 4.8.2.2b of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]).
The EnableUEReachability service operation shall be invoked by the NF Service
Consumer (e.g. SMSF, SMF) to enable the reachability of the UE.
The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service by using the HTTP method PUT,
towards the URI of a \"ueReachInd\" resource as specified in clause 6.3.3.2.
See also figure 5.4.2.2.1-1.
Figure 5.4.2.2.1-1: NF Service Consumer enables the reachability of the UE
1\. The NF Service Consumer sends a PUT request to the resource representing
the ueReachInd resource of the AMF. The payload body of the PUT request shall
contain an \"EnableUeReachabilityReqData\" object.
During the Network Triggered Connection Resume in RRC Inactive with CN based
MT communication handling (see clause 4.8.2.2.b of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]), the
SMF may include the ppi, the arp, the qfi and the 5qi of the QoS flow of the
PDU session for which DL packets are received, together with the PDU session
identifier, to enable NG-RAN to take this information into account when paging
the UE.
The SMF shall send a new Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability request with a higher
priority or a different Paging Policy Indicator to the AMF if the SMF receives
any additional Data Notification from the UPF for data packets pertaining to
another QoS Flow associated with a higher priority (i.e. ARP priority level)
than the priority indicated to the AMF in the previous
Namf_MT_EnableUEReachability request, or if the SMF derives a different Paging
Policy Indicator according to the additional Data Notification, while waiting
for the response from the AMF.
2a. On success:
\- if the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF shall immediately respond using
\"200 OK\" status code, with payload containing an
\"EnableUeReachabilityRspData\" object.
\- if the UE is in CM-IDLE state and the NAS message is to be sent over via
3GPP access and paging is not restricted as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]
clause 5.38.5, the AMF shall page the UE. When UE becomes CM-CONNECTED and the
UE has not rejected the page as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.38.4,
\"200 OK\" shall be returned with payload containing an
\"EnableUeReachabilityRspData\" object.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table

a Non-Allowed Area and the service request is not for regulatory prioritized
service. The AMF shall set the application error as \"UE_IN_NON_ALLOWED_AREA\"
in POST response body.
The AMF shall respond with the status code \"409 Conflict\", if Paging
Restriction Information restrict the EnableUEReachability request from causing
paging as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.38.5 or if the UE rejects the
paging as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.38.4. The AMF shall set the
application error as \"REJECTION_DUE_TO_PAGING_RESTRICTION\" in POST response
body.
The AMF shall respond with the status code \"504 Gateway Timeout\" and set the
application error as \"UE_NOT_REACHABLE\" and include an Estimated Maximum
Wait time in POST response body when the AMF determines the UE is unreachable
(e.g. if the UE is in MICO mode or the UE has entered Extended DRX in CM-IDLE
or Extended DRX for RRC-INACTIVE state) as specified in clauses 4.24.2 and
4.8.2.2b of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]).
#### 5.4.2.3 ProvideDomainSelectionInfo
##### 5.4.2.3.1 General
The ProvideDomainSelectionInfo service operation shall be invoked by the NF
Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) to get the UE information for terminating domain
selection of IMS voice, including following information:
\- Indication of supporting IMS voice over PS Session;
\- Time stamp of the last radio contact with the UE;
\- Current Access type and RAT type
The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service by using the HTTP GET towards
the URI of the \"UeContext\" resource (See clause 6.3.3.3.3.1). See also
figure 5.4.2.3.1-1.
Figure 5.4.2.3.1-1: Provide UE Information for Terminating Domain Selection
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a GET request to the URI of the
\"UeContext\" resource on the AMF, with query parameter \"info-class\" set to
value \"TADS\".
2a. On success, the AMF shall return \"200 OK\" status code with payload
containing an \"UeContextInfo\" data structure including UE information for
terminating domain selection for IMS voice.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.3.3.3.3.1-3 shall be returned. The message body shall contain a
ProblemDetails object with \"detail\" set to one of the corresponding
application errors listed in Table 6.3.3.3.3.1-3.
If the request cannot be completed due to a Registration procedure going-on
for the target UE, the AMF shall reject the request with a 409 Conflict
response and with the TEMPORARY_REJECT_REGISTRATION_ONGOING application error.
The NF Service Consumer should repeat the request after a suitable delay.
If the request cannot be completed due to the target UE being in RM-
DEREGISTERED state, the AMF shall reject the request with a 403 Forbidden
response and with the UE_DEREGISTERED application error.
#### 5.4.2.4 EnableGroupReachability
##### 5.4.2.4.1 General
The EnableGroupReachability service operation is used in the following
procedure:

The ProvidePositioningInfo service operation shall be invoked by the NF
Service Consumer (e.g. GMLC) to request the current or deferred geodetic and
optionally local and/or civic location of the UE. The service operation
triggers the AMF to invoke the service towards the LMF.
The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service operation by sending POST to
the URI of the \"provide-pos-info\" custom operation on the \"Individual UE
Context\" resource (See clause 6.4.3.2.4.2). See also figure 5.5.2.2.1-1.
Figure 5.5.2.2.1-1: NF Service Consumer requests the positioning information
of the UE
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the resource URI of
\"provide-pos-info\" custom operation of the \"_Individual UE context\"_
resource of the AMF. The payload body of the POST request may contain:
\- an indication of a positioning request from emergency services or
commercial services client,
\- the required QoS,
\- Supported GAD shapes,
\- scheduled location time,
\- reliable UE Location Request,
\- UE unaware indication,
\- the LMF ID that should be used for selecting the LMF,
\- the reporting indication,
\- the integrity requirements
\- the requested ranging_SL location results, including absolute locations,
relative locations or ranges and directions related to the UEs for ranging and
sidelink positioning, and/or- the information of the related UEs, including
application layer ID(s) and the related UE type for each related UE for
ranging and sidelink positioning.
If the NF service consumer wants the location change information or deferred
location information to be notified (e.g. during a handover procedure or for
activation or completion of deferred location), it also provides a callback
URI on which the EventNotify service operation is executed (see clause
5.5.2.3).
During 5GC-MT-LR multiple location procedure for regulatory location service,
the request body may also include the indication of acceptance for
intermediate response and the maximum response time, the GMLC callback address
and the LIR reference number.
2a. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned. The payload body may contain the
LCS correlation identifier, the location estimate, its age and accuracy, the
information about the positioning method. If the request is invoked during a
handover the response body shall also include the target AMF node identifier
as specified in clause 6.10.3 of 3GPP TS 23.273 [42].
If the location determination will be sent by LMF to GMLC directly, the
payload body shall include the directReportInd and supportedFeatures
attributes.
2b. On accept, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned to acknowledge that AMF
supports a deferred location request and a deferred location is accepted as
specified in step 6 of clause 6.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.273 [42];
2c. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.4.3.2.4.2.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in Table 6.4.3.2.4.2.2-2.
If the AMF received the LMF ID from the NF service consumer and the AMF does
not find an LMF with the LMF ID received from GMLC, the AMF should return a
403 Forbidden response with the cause attribute set to
\"REQUESTED_LMF_NOT_AVAILABLE\" to the NF service consumer, if no other LMF is
configured as backup selection. Otherwise, the ProblemDetails structure with
the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table
6.4.3.2.4.2.2-2 shall be applied.
#### 5.5.2.3 EventNotify
##### 5.5.2.3.1 General
The EventNotify service operation is used in the following procedure:
\- 5GC-NI-LR Procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.273 [42], clause 6.10.1)
\- Location Continuity for Handover of an Emergency session from NG-RAN (see
3GPP TS 23.273 [42], clause 6.10.3)
\- Completion of a deferred location for the UE available event or activation
of deferred location for periodic location, area event triggered location or
motion event triggered location (see 3GPP TS 23.273 [42], clause 6.3.1)
The EventNotify service operation notifies the NF Service Consumer (i.e. GMLC)
about a UE location related event information related to emergency sessions or
deferred location, i.e. the initiation, handover or termination of an
emergency session or the completion or activation of deferred location. The
notification is delivered to:
\- the callback URI received from the GMLC during an earlier
ProvidePositioningInfo service operation, if any;
Otherwise (if not available),
\- the callback URI registered in the NRF, if the GMLC registered to the NRF
with notification endpoints for location notifications (see clauses 6.1.6.2.4
and 6.1.6.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.510 [29]);
Otherwise (if not available),
\- GMLC URI locally provisioned in the AMF.
NOTE: During a handover procedure, both the source AMF and the target AMF can
invoke the EventNotify service operation, based on the local configuration.
The operation is invoked by issuing a POST request to the callback URI of the
NF Service Consumer (See clause 6.4.5.2.2). See also figure 5.5.2.3.1-1.
Figure 5.5.2.3.1-1: UE Location Notification
1\. The AMF shall send a POST request to the callback URI provided by the NF
service consumer determined as described above. The request body shall include
the type of location related event and UE Identification (SUPI or PEI), and
may include the GPSI, Geodetic Location, Local Location, Civic Location, MSC
server identity, the Position methods used or a serving LMF identification for
activation of periodic or triggered location.
2a. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the NF Service
Consumer.
2b. On failure or redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g. \"403
Forbidden\") indicating the error shall be returned and appropriate additional
error information should be returned.
#### 5.5.2.4 ProvideLocationInfo
##### 5.5.2.4.1 General
The ProvideLocationInfo service operation allows an NF Service Consumer (e.g.
UDM) to request the Network Provided Location Information (NPLI) of a target
UE.
The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service operation by sending POST
request to the URI of the \"provide-loc-info\" custom operation on the
\"Individual UE Context\" resource (see clause 6.4.3.2.4.3), as shown in
figure 5.5.2.4.1-1.
Figure 5.5.2.4.1-1: NF Service Consumer requests the Location Information of
the UE
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the resource URI of
\"provide-loc-info\" custom operation of the \"_Individual UE context\"_
resource on the AMF. The payload body of the POST request shall contain a
\"requestLocInfo\" data structure indicating the desired type of location
information.
If the NF Service Consumer desires the current location information of the
target UE, it shall set \"reqCurrentLoc\" attribute to \"true\".
2a. On success, \"200 OK\" response shall be returned. The payload body of the
response shall contain a \"ProvideLocInfo\" data structure including the
Network Provide Location Information (NPLI) of the target UE.
If \"reqCurrentLoc\" attribute is set to \"true\" and the UE is in RM-
REGISTERED and CM-IDLE state over 3GPP access, the AMF shall initiate a paging
procedure to the UE. If the paging procedure is successful, the AMF shall
return the current location information and set \"currentLoc\" attribute to
\"true\" in the response; if the UE does not respond to the paging, the AMF
shall provide the last known location and set \"currentLoc\" attribute to
\"false\" in the response.
If \"reqCurrentLoc\" attribute is set to \"true\" and the UE is in RM-
REGISTERED and CM-CONNECTED state over 3GPP access, the AMF shall follow NG-
RAN Location reporting procedure, as specified in clause 4.10 of 3GPP TS
23.502 [3], to trigger a single standalone report by setting \"direct\" event
type in **Location Reporting Control message. If NG-RAN reports current
location of the UE, the AMF shall** set \"currentLoc\" attribute to \"true\"
in the response; if NG-RAN reports last known location of the UE with
timestamp, the AMF shall set \"currentLoc\" attribute to \"false\" in the
response.
If the UE is in RM-REGISTERED over non-3GPP access, the AMF shall include the
latest non-3GPP access location information.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.4.3.2.4.3.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application error listed in table 6.4.3.2.4.3.2-2.
#### 5.5.2.5 CancelLocation
##### 5.5.2.5.1 General
This service operation is used in the following procedure:
\- Cancellation of Reporting of Location Events by an AF or External LCS
Client (see 3GPP TS 23.273 [42], clause 6.3.3)
The CancelLocation service operation shall be invoked by the NF Service
Consumer (e.g. GMLC) to cancel reporting periodic or events triggered
location.
The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service operation by sending a POST
request to the URI of the \"cancel-pos-info\" custom operation on the
\"Individual UE Context\" resource (See clause 6.4.3.2.4.4). See also figure
5.5.2.5.1-1.
Figure 5.5.2.5.1-1: Cancellation of reporting periodic or events triggered
location of the UE
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the resource URI of
\"cancel-pos-info\" custom operation of the \"_Individual UE context\"_
resource of the AMF. The payload body of the POST request shall contain a
\"CancelLocInfo\" data structure indicating the desired cancellation of
reporting periodic or events triggered location of the UE.
2a. On success, AMF responds with \"204 No Content\".
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.4.3.2.4.4-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to
one of the application errors.
## 5.6 Namf_MBSBroadcast Service
### 5.6.1 Service Description
This service enables the NF Service Consumer (e.g. MB-SMF) to create, update
or release a broadcast MBS session context in the AMF and to be notified about
status change of the MBS broadcast context.
### 5.6.2 Service Operations
#### 5.6.2.1 Introduction
The Namf_MBSBroadcast service supports following service operations:
\- ContextCreate
\- ContextUpdate
\- ContextRelease
\- ContextStatusNotify
#### 5.6.2.2 ContextCreate
The ContextCreate service operation shall be used by the NF Service Consumer
(e.g. MB-SMF) to request the AMF to create a broadcast MBS session context.
NOTE: For a location dependent MBS service, one single ContextCreate service
operation is performed per MBS session (for a given AMF).
It is used in the following procedures:
\- MBS Session Start for Broadcast (see clause 7.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.247 [55]);
\- MBS Session Update for Broadcast (see clause 7.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.247 [55]);
\- Support for Local Broadcast Service (see clause 7.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.247
[55]).
There shall be only one broadcast MBS session context per MBS session, or per
MBS session and Area Session ID for an MBS session with Location dependent
Broadcast service.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. MB-SMF) shall create a broadcast MBS session
context by using the HTTP POST method as shown in Figure 5.6.2.2-1.
Figure 5.6.2.2-1: Broadcast MBS session context creation
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request targeting the Broadcast
MBS session contexts collection resource of the AMF. The payload body of the
POST request shall contain the following information:
\- MBS Session ID (i.e. TMGI, or TMGI and NID for an MBS session in an SNPN);
\- list of Area Session ID and related MBS service area, for a Location
dependent broadcast MBS service;
\- MBS service area, for a Local broadcast MBS session;
\- N2 MBS Session Management container (see MBS Session Setup or Modification
Request Transfer IE in 3GPP TS 38.413 [12]);
\- Notification URI where to be notified about the status change of the
broadcast MBS session context; and
\- SNSSAI.
The NF Service Consumer may also include the maxResponseTime IE in the request
to indicate the maximum response time to receive information about the
completion of the Broadcast MBS session establishment.
The NF Service Consumer may also include the MB-SMF instance ID and MB-SMF
service instance ID to enable the AMF subscribing to the MB-SMF status
notifications.
2a. On success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned. The AMF should respond
success when it receives the first successful response from the NG-RAN(s). The
201 Created response shall contain MBS session identifier and may contain one
or more N2 MBS Session Management containers, if additional information (e.g.
MBS Session Setup or Modification Response Transfer IE or MBS Session Setup or
Modification Failure Transfer IE in 3GPP TS 38.413 [12]) needs to be
transferred to the MB-SMF. If the AMF received the NG-RAN responses from all
involved NG-RAN(s), e.g. if the broadccast MBS session involves only one NG-
RAN, the AMF shall include an indication of completion of the operation in all
NG-RANs in the 201 Created response.
Upon receipt of subsequent responses from other NG-RANs after sending the 201
Created response, if additional information (e.g. MBS Session Setup or
Modification Response Transfer IE or MBS Session Setup or Modification Failure
Transfer IE in 3GPP TS 38.413 [12]) needs to be transferred to the MB-SMF, the
AMF shall transfer such information by sending one or more
Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify requests to the MB-SMF. A
Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify request may include a list of N2 MBS
Session Management containers received from different NG-RANs. When the AMF
receives the response from all NG-RANs, the AMF shall include an indication of
the completion of the operation in the Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify
request.
If the AMF does not receive responses from all NG-RAN nodes before the maximum
response time elapses since the reception of the
Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextCreate Request, then the AMF should send one
Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify request indicating the incompletion of
the Broadcast MBS session establishment.
For each N2 MBS Session Management container sent towards the MB-SMF, the AMF
shall insert the identifier of the NG-RAN node that generated it in the
corresponding entry of the n2MbsSmInfoList attribute.
The AMF may send one or more Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify request
including an operationEvents attribute to report the MB-SMF about failure to
reach one or more NG-RANs.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.5.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application errors listed in Table 6.5.3.2.3.1-3.
#### 5.6.2.3 ContextUpdate
The ContextUpdate service operation shall be used by the NF Service Consumer
(e.g. MB-SMF) to request the AMF to update a broadcast MBS session context.
It is used in the following procedures:
\- MBS Session Update for Broadcast (see clause 7.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.247 [55]).
\- Broadcast MBS session restoration by MB-SMF (see clause 8.3.2.3 of 3GPP TS
23.527 [33].
\- Selecting an alternative AMF for a Broadcast MBS Session at AMF failure
(see clause 8.3.2.4 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [33]).
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. MB-SMF) shall update a broadcast MBS session
context by using the HTTP POST method as shown in Figure 5.6.2.3-1.
Figure 5.6.2.3-1: Broadcast MBS session context update
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request targeting the individual
Broadcast MBS session context resource to be updated in the AMF. The payload
body of the POST request may contain the following information:
\- N2 MBS Session Management container (see MBS Session Setup or Modification
Request Transfer IE in 3GPP TS 38.413 [12]);
\- Notification URI, if the NF Service Consumer wishes to modify the
notification URI where to be notified about the status change of the broadcast
MBS session context;
\- updated MBS service area, for a Local broadcast MBS session;
\- updated list of Area Session ID and related MBS service area, for a
Location dependent broadcast MBS session.
\- the n2MbsInfoChangeInd IE set to \"true\" or \"false\" to indicate to the
AMF whether the information within the N2 MBS Session Management container has
changed or not for the MBS session
The NF Service Consumer may also include the maxResponseTime IE in the request
to indicate the maximum response time to receive information about the
completion of the Broadcast MBS session update.
During a broadcast MBS session restoration procedure for an NG-RAN failure
with restart, the MB-SMF may include one or more ranIds attibutes to request
the AMF to setup the Broadcast MBS session in a list of NG-RANs as identified
by the NG-RAN ID(s), as specified in clause 8.3.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [33].
During a restoration procedure upon an AMF failure without restart, for an AMF
deployed in an AMF set, the MB-SMF may set the noNgapSignallingInd IE to
\"true\" when the MB-SMF detects the original AMF has failed and then selects
an alternative AMF to take over the MBS session but without a need to trigger
any NGAP signalling towards NG-RANs, as specified in clause 8.3.2.4 of 3GPP TS
23.527 [33].
2a. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned if additional information needs
to be returned in the response. The 200 OK response may contain one or more N2
MBS Session Management containers, if such information (e.g. MBS Session Setup
or Modification Response Transfer IE, MBS Session Setup or Modification
Failure Transfer IE or MBS Session Release Response Transfer IE in 3GPP TS
38.413 [12]) needs to be transferred to the MB-SMF. If the AMF received the
NG-RAN responses from all involved NG-RAN(s), the AMF shall include an
indication of completion of the operation in all NG-RANs.
2b. On success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned if no additional
information needs to be returned in the response.
In both 2a and 2b cases, upon receipt of subsequent responses from other NG-
RANs after sending the 200 OK response or the 204 No Content response, if
additional information (e.g. MBS Session Setup or Modification Response
Transfer IE MBS Session Setup or Modification Failure Transfer IE or MBS
Session Release Response Transfer IE in 3GPP TS 38.413 [12]) needs to be
transferred to the MB-SMF, the AMF shall transfer such information by sending
one or more Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify requests to the MB-SMF. A
Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify request may include a list of N2 MBS
Session Management containers received from different NG-RANs. When the AMF
receives the response from all NG-RANs, the AMF shall include an indication of
the completion of the operation in the Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify
request.
If the AMF does not receive responses from all NG-RAN nodes before the maximum
response time elapses since the reception of the
Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextUpdate Request, then the AMF should send one
Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify request indicating the incompletion of
the Broadcast MBS session update.
If the n2MbsInfoChangeInd IE is present in the request and set to \"false\",
the AMF does not need to contact NG-RAN nodes unaffected by the MBS service
area change.
For each N2 MBS Session Management container sent towards the MB-SMF, the AMF
shall insert the identifier of the NG-RAN node that generated it in the
corresponding entry of the n2MbsSmInfoList attribute.
The AMF may send one or more Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify request
including an operationEvents attribute to report the MB-SMF about failure to
reach one or more NG-RANs.
2c. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.5.3.2.4.2.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one
of the application errors listed in Table 6.5.3.2.4.2.2-2.
#### 5.6.2.4 ContextRelease
The ContextRelease service operation shall be used by the NF Service Consumer
(e.g. MB-SMF) to request the AMF to release a broadcast MBS session context.
It is used in the following procedures:
\- MBS Session Release for Broadcast (see clause 7.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.247
[55]).
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. MB-SMF) shall release a broadcast MBS session
context by using the HTTP DELETE method as shown in Figure 5.6.2.4-1.
Figure 5.6.2.4-1: Broadcast MBS session context release
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request targeting the
individual Broadcast MBS session context resource to be released in the AMF.
2a. On success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.5.3.3.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application errors listed in Table 6.5.3.3.3.1-3.
The AMF may send one or more Namf_MBSBroadcast_ContextStatusNotify request
including an operationEvents attribute to report the MB-SMF about failure to
reach one or more NG-RANs.
#### 5.6.2.5 ContextStatusNotify
The ContextStatusNotify service operation shall be used by the AMF to notify
status change of a broadcast MBS session context to the NF Service Consumer
(e.g. MB-SMF).
It is used in the following procedures:
\- MBS Session Start for Broadcast (see clause 7.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.247 [55]);
\- MBS Session Update for Broadcast (see clause 7.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.247 [55]);
\- Broadcast MBS Session Release Require (see clause 7.3.6 of 3GPP TS 23.247
[55]).
\- Broadcast MBS session restoration by MB-SMF (see clause 8.3.2.3 of 3GPP TS
23.527 [33]).
\- Selecting an alternative AMF for a Broadcast MBS Session at AMF failure
(see clause 8.3.2.4 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [33]).
\- Transport change for resource sharing across broadcast MBS Sessions in
network sharing (see clause 7.3.x of 3GPP TS 23.247 [55]).
The AMF shall notify status change of a broadcast MBS session context to the
NF Service Consumer (e.g. MB-SMF) by using the HTTP POST method as shown in
Figure 5.6.2.5-1.
Figure 5.6.2.5-1: Broadcast MBS session context status change notification
1\. The AMF shall send a POST request targeting the notification URI received
from the NF Service Consumer. The payload body of the POST request shall
contain the following information:
\- MBS Session ID (i.e. TMGI, or TMGI and NID for an MBS session in an SNPN);
\- Area Session ID, if this is a Location dependent broadcast MBS service;
\- one or more N2 MBS Session Management containers, if N2 MBS Session
Management information (e.g. MBS Session Setup or Modification Response
Transfer IE, MBS Session Setup or Modification Failure Transfer IE or MBS
Session Release Response Transfer IE or Boardcast Session Transport Request
Transfer IE in 3GPP TS 38.413 [12]) has been received from one or more NG-RANs
that needs to be transferred to the NF Service Consumer; for each N2 MBS
Session Management container sent towards the MB-SMF, the AMF shall insert the
identifier of the NG-RAN node that generated it in the corresponding entry of
the n2MbsSmInfoList attribute.
Editor\'s Note: The NGAP message name and IE type need to be aligned with 3GPP
TS 38.413.
\- the operationStatus IE indicating the completion of the Broadcast MBS
session establishment or update, if the NF Service Consumer has requested to
establish or update the Broadcast MBS session context and a response has been
received from all NG-RANs; and
\- the operationStatus IE indicating the incompletion of the Broadcast MBS
session establishment or update, if the NF Service Consumer has requested to
establish or update the Broadcast MBS session context including a maximum
response time and the AMF has not received responses from all NG-RANs before
the maximum response time elapses.
During a Broadcast MBS Session Release Require procedure (see clause 7.3.6 of
3GPP TS 23.247 [55]), one or more NG-RANs may request the AMF to release the
Broadcast MBS session. In this case, based on operator\'s policy, the AMF may:
\- report the Broadcast MBS Session release to the MB-SMF by including the
operationEvent attribute in the MBS Context Status Notification request with
the opEventType set to \"NG_RAN_EVENT\" together with a list of
\"ngranFailureEvent\" for each NG-RAN that requested to release the Broadcast
MBS Session. Upon receiving such a notification, per local policies, the MB-
SMF may attempt to re-establish the MBS session after some operator
configurable time in these NG-RANs by performing the Broadcast MBS session
restoration by MB-SMF procedure specified in clause 8.3.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.527
[33]; or
\- attempt to re-establish the MBS session after some operator configurable
time in these NG-RANs by performing the Broadcast MBS session restoration by
AMF procedure specified in clause 8.3.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [33].
If all the NG-RANs serving the Broadcast MBS session requested the AMF to
release the Broadcast MBS session, the AMF shall release the Broadcast MBS
session context and send a notification with the releaseInd attribute set to
true to report to the MB-SMF that the Broadcast MBS session (context) is
released at the AMF and NG-RANs.
The AMF may include an operationEvents attribute in the MBS Context Status
Notification request to report the MB-SMF:
\- a NG-RAN failure event, e.g. the NG-RAN failure with or without restart, as
specified in clause 8.3.2.3 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [33]);
\- that a new AMF has taken over the control of the broadcast MBS session upon
an AMF failure as specified in clause 8.3.2.4 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [33]).
2a. On success, the NF Service Consumer shall return a \"204 No Content\"
response. If the NF Service Consumer has received a ContextStatusNotification
with a N2 MBS Session Management container containing ngapData for Broadcast
Session Transport Request Transfer IE, it shall return a \"200 OK\" with the
ContextStatusNotificationResponse which includes the ngapData for Broadcast
Session Transport Response Transfer IE.
Editor's Note: Whether it is required to introduce \"200 OK\" as Acknowledge
to ContextStatusNotify request is FFS.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.5.5.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails attribute with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application errors listed in Table 6.5.5.2.3.1-3.
## 5.7 Namf_MBSCommunication Service
### 5.7.1 Service Description
This service enables an NF Service Consumer (e.g. MB-SMF) to request the AMF
to transfer MBS multicast related N2 message towards NG-RAN(s) serving a
multicast MBS session, during a multicast MBS session activation, deactivation
or update.
### 5.7.2 Service Operations
#### 5.7.2.1 Introduction
The Namf_MBSCommunication service supports the following service operations:
\- N2MessageTransfer
#### 5.7.2.2 N2MessageTransfer
The N2MessageTransfer service operation shall be used by the NF Service
Consumer (e.g. MB-SMF) to request the AMF to transfer an MBS related N2
message to the NG-RAN nodes serving the multicast MBS session. It is used
during the following procedures:
\- MBS session activation procedure (see clause 7.2.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.247
[55]);
\- MBS session deactivation procedure (see clause 7.2.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.247
[55]); and
\- Multicast session update procedure (see clause 7.2.6 of 3GPP TS 23.247
[55]).
The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service operation by sending a POST
request to the URI of the \"transfer\" custom operation (see clause 6.6.3.1)
of the AMF. See Figure 5.7.2.2-1.
Figure 5.7.2.2-1 N2 Message Transfer for a multicast MBS session
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the custom operation for N2 message
transfer by sending a HTTP POST request and the request body shall carry the
MbsN2MessageTransferReqData data structure which contains the N2 MBS Session
Management information to be transferred. The MbsN2MessageTransferReqData may
also contain:
\- the Area Session ID, if this is a location dependent multicast MBS session;
and/or
\- a notification URI where to be notified about any failure of the MBS
related N2 procedure for an NG RAN node in this list; and
\- an optional notification correlation ID to be sent within notifications.
If the AMF supports the RAN-ID-LIST feature, the AMF shall distribute the MBS
related N2 message to the list of NG-RAN nodes indicated by the MB-SMF, if
any, otherwise to the list of NG-RAN nodes having established shared delivery
that the AMF stores locally, if any.
NOTE: An AMF which does not support the the RAN-ID-LIST feature distributes
the MBS related N2 message to the list of NG-RAN nodes having established
shared delivery that the AMF stores locally.
2a. On success, the AMF shall respond with a \"200 OK\" status code with
MbsN2MessageTransferRspData data structure. The AMF should respond success
when it receives the first successful response from the NG-RAN(s).
If the AMF supports the RAN-ID-LIST feature (see clause 6.6.8), and if the
request included a list of NG RAN node IDs and a notification URI where to be
notified about failures, the AMF shall report failure(s) of the N2 MBS related
N2 procedure with an NG RAN node in this list by including the failureList IE
in the \"200 OK\" response or in a subsequent Notify request towards the
notification URI received in the request. See clause 8.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 23.527
[33].
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.6.3.1.4.2.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
may contain a ProblemDetails attribute with the \"cause\" attribute set to one
of the application errors listed in Table 6.6.4.2.2-2 if any.
#### 5.7.2.3 Notify
The Notify service operation shall be used by the AMF to notify the NF Service
Consumer about a failure of an MBS related N2 procedure with an NG RAN node
(see clause 5.7.2.2).
It is used in the following procedure:
\- N2 MBS session request distribution with list of NG RAN Node IDs provided
by MB-SMF to AMF (see clause 8.4.1.2 of 3GPP TS 23.527 [33]).
The AMF shall notify a failure of an MBS related N2 procedure with an NG RAN
node to the NF Service Consumer (e.g. MB-SMF) by using the HTTP POST method as
shown in Figure 5.7.2.3-1.
Figure 5.7.2.3-1: Notification
1\. The AMF shall send a POST request targeting the notification URI received
from the NF Service Consumer. The payload body of the POST request shall
contain the following information:
\- MBS Session ID (i.e. TMGI, or TMGI and NID for an MBS session in an SNPN);
\- the Area Session ID, if this is a location dependent multicast MBS session;
and
\- one or more failures including, for each failure, the related NG-RAN Node
ID and failure cause.
2a. On success, the NF Service Consumer shall return a \"204 No Content\"
response.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.6.5.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails attribute with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application errors listed in Table 6.6.5.2.3.1-3.
# 6 API Definitions
## 6.1 Namf_Communication Service API
### 6.1.1 API URI
The Namf_Communication shall use the Namf_Communication API.
The API URI of the Namf_Communication API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/**
The request URI used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in clause
4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"namf-comm\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.1.3.
### 6.1.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.1.2.1 General
HTTP/2, as defined in IETF RFC 7540 [19], shall be used as specified in clause
5 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP messages and bodies for the Namf_Communication service shall comply with
the OpenAPI [23] specification contained in Annex A.
#### 6.1.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.1.2.2.1 General
The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in clause
5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
##### 6.1.2.2.2 Content type
The following content types shall be supported:
\- JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [8], shall be used as content type of the
HTTP bodies specified in the present specification as indicated in clause 5.4
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
\- The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 [36]). The use of the
Problem Details JSON object in a HTTP response body shall be signalled by the
content type \"application/problem+json\".
Multipart messages shall also be supported (see clause 6.1.2.4) using the
content type \"multipart/related\", comprising:
\- one JSON body part with the \"application/json\" content type; and
\- one or more binary body parts with 3gpp vendor specific content subtypes.
The 3gpp vendor specific content subtypes defined in Table 6.1.2.2.2-1 shall
be supported.
Table 6.1.2.2.2-1: 3GPP vendor specific content subtypes
* * *
content subtype Description vnd.3gpp.ngap Binary encoded payload, encoding NG
Application Protocol (NGAP) IEs, as specified in clause 9.4 of 3GPP TS 38.413
[12] (ASN.1 encoded). vnd.3gpp.5gnas Binary encoded payload, encoding a 5GS
NAS message, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [11]. NOTE: Using 3GPP vendor
content subtypes allows to describe the nature of the opaque payload (e.g.
NGAP or 5GS NAS information) without having to rely on metadata in the JSON
payload.
* * *
See clause 6.1.2.4 for the binary payloads supported in the binary body part
of multipart messages.
#### 6.1.2.3 HTTP custom headers
##### 6.1.2.3.1 General
In this release of this specification, no custom headers specific to the
Namf_Communication service are defined. For 3GPP specific HTTP custom headers
used across all service based interfaces, see clause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4].
#### 6.1.2.4 HTTP multipart messages
HTTP multipart messages shall be supported, to transfer opaque N1 Information
(e.g. SM, LPP) and/or N2 Information (e.g. SM, NRPPa, PWS), in the following
service operations (and HTTP messages):
\- N1N2MessageTransfer Request and Response (POST);
\- NonUeN2MessageTransfer Request and Response (POST);
\- N1MessageNotify (POST);
\- N2InfoNotify (POST);
\- NonUeN2InfoNotify (POST);
\- UEContextTransfer (POST);
\- CreateUEContext (PUT)
HTTP multipart messages shall include one JSON body part and one or more
binary body parts comprising:
\- N1payload, and/or N2 payload (see clause 6.1.6.4).
The JSON body part shall be the \"root\" body part of the multipart message.
It shall be encoded as the first body part of the multipart message. The
\"Start\" parameter does not need to be included.
The multipart message shall include a \"type\" parameter (see IETF RFC 2387
[9]) specifying the media type of the root body part, i.e.
\"application/json\".
NOTE: The \"root\" body part (or \"root\" object) is the first body part the
application processes when receiving a multipart/related message, see IETF RFC
2387 [9]. The default root is the first body within the multipart/related
message. The \"Start\" parameter indicates the root body part, e.g. when this
is not the first body part in the message.
For each binary body part in a HTTP multipart message, the binary body part
shall include a Content-ID header (see IETF RFC 2045 [10]), and the JSON body
part shall include an attribute, defined with the RefToBinaryData type, that
contains the value of the Content-ID header field of the referenced binary
body part.

Editor\'s note: It is FFS whether and how to address a partially allowed
S-NSSAI upon inter-AMF mobility in a same PLMN when the source AMF would
support partially allowed S-NSSAIs but the target AMF would not, e.g. whether
the Source AMF should in such a case send the partially allowed S-NSSAI in the
allowedNssai IE.

N2 Information received by the AMF for PWS may be processed by the AMF before
re-encoding and transferring to the Service Consumer.
If a subscription exists for N2InformationClass \"PWS-BCAL\" and the received
N2 Message Type is a WRITE-REPLACE-WARNING-RESPONSE, then the AMF may
aggregate the Broadcast Completed Area Lists it has received from the NG-RAN
nodes for a message identified by its Serial Number and Message Identifier
(see table 6.1.6.4.3.3-1) and transfer the ASN.1 (re-)encoded Message Type,
Message Identifier, Serial Number and the (aggregated) Broadcast Completed
Area List IE in the N2 Info Container in the N2InfoNotify, and the
\"bcEmptyAreaList\" attribute if the Broadcast Completed Area List IE is not
present in the PWS N2 information.
If a subscription exists for N2InformationClass \"PWS-BCAL\" and the received
N2 Message Type is a PWS-CANCEL-RESPONSE, then the AMF may aggregate the
Broadcast Cancelled Area Lists IE it has received from the NG-RAN nodes for a
message identified by its Serial Number and Message Identifier (see table
6.1.6.4.3.3-1) and transfer the ASN.1 (re-)encoded the Message Type, Message
Identifier, Serial Number, the (aggregated) Broadcast Cancelled Area List IE
in the N2 Info Container in the N2InfoNotify, and the \"bcEmptyAreaList\"
attribute if the PWS-CANCEL-RESPONSE does not contain a Broadcast Cancelled
Area List, in the PWS N2 information.
For the ASN.1 definition for encoding the WRITE-REPLACE-WARNING-RESPONSE and
the PWS-CANCEL-RESPONSE, see clause 9.4 of 3GPP TS 38.413 [12].
If a subscription exists for N2InformationClass \"PWS-RF\" and the received N2
Message Type is a PWS-RESTART-INDICATION, then the AMF may transfer the ASN.1
encoded string from the PWS-RESTART-INDICATION (see table 6.1.6.4.3.3-3) in
the N2 Info Container in the N2InfoNotify.
If a subscription exists for N2InformationClass \"PWS-RF\" and the received N2
Message Type is a PWS-FAILURE-INDICATION (see table 6.1.6.4.3.3-3), then the
AMF may transfer the ASN1 encoded string from the PWS-FAILURE-INDICATION in
the N2 Info Container in the N2InfoNotify.

### 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27], the access to the Namf_Communication API
may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [28]),
using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP
TS 29.510 [29]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Namf_Communication API, shall obtain a \"token\" from
the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [29], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Namf_Communication service.
The Namf_Communication API defines the following scopes for OAuth2
authorization as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27].
Table 6.1.9-1: OAuth2 scopes defined in Namf_Communications API
Scope Description
* * *
\"namf-comm\" Access to the Namf_Communications API. \"namf-comm:ue-
contexts:mobility\" Access to service operations applying to UE context
resources for inter-AMF mobility, i.e., UEContextTransfer,
RegistrationStatusUpdate, CreateUEContext, ReleaseUEContext, RelocateUEContext
and CancelRelocateUEContext. \"namf-comm:ue-contexts:assign-ebi\" Access to
service operations applying to UE context resources for EBI assignment, i.e.,
EBIAssignment. \"namf-comm:n1-n2-messages\" Access to service operations
applying to the n1-n2-messages resource, i.e., N1N2MessageSubscribe,
N1N2MessageUnSubscribe, N1N2MessageTransfer, N1MessageNotify, and
N2InfoNotify. \"namf-comm:non-ue-n2-messages\" Access to service operations
applying to the non-ue-n2-messages resource, i.e., NonUeN2MessageTransfer,
NonUeN2InfoSubscribe, NonUeN2InfoUnSubscribe, and NonUeN2InfoNotify.
### 6.1.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AMF service instance, within
the same AMF or a different AMF of an AMF set, e.g. when an AMF service
instance is part of an AMF (service) set or when using indirect communications
(see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See the ES3XX feature in clause 6.1.8.
An SCP that reselects a different AMF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new AMF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id

\"LOCATION_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive the Last Known
Location or the current Location of a UE or a group of UEs, and Updated
Location of the UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of a location
change of the UE. \"PRESENCE_IN_AOI_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to
receive the current present state of a UE in a specific Area of Interest
(AOI), and notification when a specified UE enters or leaves the specified
area. The area could be identified by a TA list, an area ID or specific
interest area name like \"LADN\". \"TIMEZONE_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this
event to receive the current time zone of a UE or a group of UEs, and updated
time zone of the UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of a time
zone change of the UE. \"ACCESS_TYPE_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to
receive the current access type(s) of a UE or a group of UEs, and updated
access type(s) of the UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of the
access type change of the UE. \"REGISTRATION_STATE_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to

UEs, and report for updated registration state of a UE or any UE in the group
when AMF becomes aware of a registration state change of the UE.
\"CONNECTIVITY_STATE_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive the
current connection management state of a UE or a group of UEs, and report for
updated connection management state of a UE or any UE in the group when AMF
becomes aware of a connection management state change of the UE.

a UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of a reachability change of
the UE. \"COMMUNICATION_FAILURE_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to
receive the Communication failure report of a UE or group of UEs or any UE.
\"UES_IN_AREA_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive the number of
UEs in a specific area. \"SUBSCRIPTION_ID_CHANGE\" This event type is used by
the AMF to inform the NF service consumer that the subscription Id for the
event subscription is changed (e.g. Subscription Id creation at the target AMF
for individual UE level event subscriptions, during mobility registration or
handover procedures involving an AMF change). This event needs no explicit
subscription form an NF service consumer. \"SUBSCRIPTION_ID_ADDITION\" This
event type is used by the AMF to inform the NF service consumer that a new
subscription Id is added (e.g creation of an event subscription for a UE group
level event subscription at the target AMF, during mobility registration or
handover procedures involving AMF change for a UE belonging to a group Id and
when such a UE is the first UE of the group registering at the target AMF).
This event needs no explicit subscription form the NF service consumer.
\"SUBSCRIPTION_TERMINATION\" This event type is used by the AMF to inform the
NF service consumer that the subscription is terminated at the AMF, e.g. the
AMF inform the UDM that the subscription is terminated because the AMF has
identified the subscription is no longer valid at the NEF.
\"LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY\" An NF subscribes to this event to receive the event
report of a UE or group of UEs when AMF detects that a target UE is no longer
reachable for either signalling or user plane communication. Such condition is
identified when Mobile Reachable timer expires in the AMF (see 3GPP TS 23.501
[2]), when the UE detaches and when AMF deregisters from UDM for an active UE.
If the UE is already not reachable for either signalling or user plane
communication when the event is subscribed, the AMF reports the event
directly. \"5GS_USER_STATE_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive
the 5GS user state of a UE. \"AVAILABILITY_AFTER_DDN_FAILURE\" A NF subscribes
to this event to be notified about the Availability of a UE after a DDN
failure. \"TYPE_ALLOCATION_CODE_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to
receive the TAC of a UE or group of UEs.
\"FREQUENT_MOBILITY_REGISTRATION_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to
receive the number of mobility registration procedures during a period of a UE
or group of UEs. \"SNSSAI_TA_MAPPING_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to
receive the related access type and the list of supported S-NSSAIs (including
indication of S-NSSAIs restricted by AMF) at the TAI(s).
\"UE_ACCESS_BEHAVIOR_TRENDS\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive the UE
access behavior trends (e.g. access type change, handover, etc.) during a
period for a UE or a group of UEs, as specified in clause 4.15.4.2 of 3GPP TS
23.502 [3]. \"UE_LOCATION_TRENDS\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive
the UE Location Trends within a period for a UE or a group of UEs, as
specified in clause 4.15.4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
\"UE_MM_TRANSACTION_REPORT\" A NF subscribes to this event to receive the
Total Number of Mobility Management transactions during a period for a UE or a
group of UEs, as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].

### 6.2.8 Feature Negotiation
The feature negotiation mechanism specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] shall be used to negotiate the optional features applicable between the
AMF and the NF Service Consumer, for the Namf_EventExposure service, if any.
The NF Service Consumer shall indicate the optional features it supports for
the Namf_EventExposure service, if any, by including the supportedFeatures
attribute in payload of the HTTP Request Message for subscription resource
creation.
The AMF shall determine the supported features for the service operations as
specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] and shall indicate the supported
features by including the supportedFeatures attribute in payload of the HTTP
response for subscription resource creation.
The syntax of the supportedFeatures attribute is defined in clause 5.2.2 of
3GPP TS 29.571 [6].
The following features are defined for the Namf_EventExposure service:

### 6.2.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27], the access to the Namf_EventExposure API
may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [28]),
using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP
TS 29.510 [29]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Namf_EventExposure API, shall obtain a \"token\" from
the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [29], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Namf_EventExposure service.
The Namf_EventExposure API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27]; it defines a single scope consisting on the
name of the service (i.e., \"namf-evts\"), and it does not define any
additional scopes at resource or operation level.
### 6.2.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AMF service instance, within
the same AMF or a different AMF of an AMF set, e.g. when an AMF service
instance is part of an AMF (service) set or when using indirect communications
(see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See the ES3XX feature in clause 6.2.8.
An SCP that reselects a different AMF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new AMF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an AMF within an AMF set redirects a service request to a different AMF of
the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code,
the identity of the new AMF towards which the service request is redirected
shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary
Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
## 6.3 Namf_MT Service API
### 6.3.1 API URI
The Namf_MT shall use the Namf_MT API.
The API URI of the Namf_MT API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/**
The request URI used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in clause
4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"namf-mt\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.3.3.
### 6.3.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.3.2.1 General
HTTP/2, as defined in IETF RFC 7540 [19], shall be used as specified in clause
5 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP messages and bodies for the Namf_MT service shall comply with the OpenAPI
[23] specification contained in Annex A.
#### 6.3.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.3.2.2.1 General
The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in clause
5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
##### 6.3.2.2.2 Content type
The following content types shall be supported:
\- JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [8], shall be used as content type of the
HTTP bodies specified in the present specification as indicated in clause 5.4
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
\- The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 [36]). The use of the
Problem Details JSON object in a HTTP response body shall be signalled by the
content type \"application/problem+json\".
#### 6.3.2.3 HTTP custom headers
##### 6.3.2.3.1 General
In this release of this specification, no custom headers specific to the
Namf_MT service are defined. For 3GPP specific HTTP custom headers used across
all service based interfaces, see clause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

### 6.3.8 Feature Negotiation
The feature negotiation mechanism specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] shall be used to negotiate the optional features applicable between the
AMF and the NF Service Consumer, for the Namf_MT service, if any.
The NF Service Consumer shall indicate the optional features it supports for
the Namf_MT service, if any, by including the supportedFeatures attribute in
payload of the HTTP Request Message for following service operations:
\- EnableUEReachability, as specified in clause 5.4.2.2;
\- ProvideDomainSelectionInfo, as specified in clause 5.4.2.3;
\- EnableGroupReachability, as specified in clause 5.4.2.4.
The AMF shall determine the supported features for the service operations as
specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] and shall indicate the supported
features by including the supportedFeatures attribute in payload of the HTTP
response for the service operation.
The syntax of the supportedFeatures attribute is defined in clause 5.2.2 of
3GPP TS 29.571 [6].
The following features are defined for the Namf_MT service.
Table 6.3.8-1: Features of supportedFeatures attribute used by Namf_MT service

### 6.3.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27], the access to the Namf_MT API may be
authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [28]), using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510
[29]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Namf_MT API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [29], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Namf_MT service.
The Namf_MT API defines the following scopes for OAuth2 authorization as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27].
Table 6.3.9-1: OAuth2 scopes defined in Namf_MT API
Scope Description
* * *
\"namf-mt\" Access to the Namf_MT API. \"namf-mt:ue-reachind\" Access to the
EnableUeReachability service operation. \"namf-mt:enable-group-reachability\"
Access to the EnableGroupReachability service operation.
### 6.3.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AMF service instance, within
the same AMF or a different AMF of an AMF set, e.g. when an AMF service
instance is part of an AMF (service) set or when using indirect communications
(see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See the ES3XX feature in clause 6.3.8.
An SCP that reselects a different AMF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new AMF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an AMF within an AMF set redirects a service request to a different AMF of
the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code,
the identity of the new AMF towards which the service request is redirected
shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary
Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
## 6.4 Namf_Location Service API
### 6.4.1 API URI
The Namf_Location shall use the Namf_ Location API.
The API URI of the Namf_Location API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/**
The request URI used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in clause
4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"namf-loc\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".

### 6.4.8 Feature Negotiation
The feature negotiation mechanism specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] shall be used to negotiate the optional features applicable between the
AMF and the NF Service Consumer, for the Namf_Location service, if any.
The NF Service Consumer shall indicate the optional features it supports for
the Namf_Location service, if any, by including the supportedFeatures
attribute in payload of the HTTP Request Message for following service
operations:
\- ProvidePositioningInfo, as specified in clause 5.5.2.2;
\- ProvideLocationInfo, as specified in clause 5.5.2.4;
\- CancelLocation, as specified in clause 5.5.2.5
The AMF shall determine the supported features for the service operations as
specified in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] and shall indicate the supported
features by including the supportedFeatures attribute in payload of the HTTP
response for the service operation.
The syntax of the supportedFeatures attribute is defined in clause 5.2.2 of
3GPP TS 29.571 [6].
The following features are defined for the Namf_Location service.
Table 6.1.8-1: Features of supportedFeatures attribute used by Namf_Location

### 6.4.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27], the access to the Namf_Location API may
be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [28]), using
the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS
29.510 [29]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Namf_Location API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [29], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Namf_Location service.
The Namf_Location API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 [27]; it defines a single scope consisting on the name of the
service (i.e., \"namf-loc\"), and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
### 6.4.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AMF service instance, within
the same AMF or a different AMF of an AMF set, e.g. when an AMF service
instance is part of an AMF (service) set or when using indirect communications
(see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See the ES3XX feature in clause 6.4.8.
An SCP that reselects a different AMF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new AMF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an AMF within an AMF set redirects a service request to a different AMF of
the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code,
the identity of the new AMF towards which the service request is redirected
shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary
Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
## 6.5 Namf_MBSBroadcast Service API
### 6.5.1 API URI
The Namf_MBSBroadcast service shall use the Namf_MBSBroadcast API.
The API URI of the Namf_MBSBroadcast API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
The request URI used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in clause
4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"namf-mbs-bc\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.5.3.
### 6.5.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.5.2.1 General
HTTP/2, as defined in IETF RFC 7540 [19], shall be used as specified in clause
5 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP messages and bodies for the Namf_MBSBroadcast service shall comply with
the OpenAPI [23] specification contained in Annex A.
#### 6.5.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.5.2.2.1 General
The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in clause
5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
##### 6.5.2.2.2 Content type
The following content types shall be supported:
\- JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [8], shall be used as content type of the
HTTP bodies specified in the present specification as indicated in clause 5.4
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
\- The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 [36]). The use of the
Problem Details JSON object in a HTTP response body shall be signalled by the
content type \"application/problem+json\".
Multipart messages shall also be supported (see clause 6.5.2.4) using the
content type \"multipart/related\", comprising:
\- one JSON body part with the \"application/json\" content type; and
\- one or more binary body parts with 3gpp vendor specific content subtypes.
The 3gpp vendor specific content subtypes defined in Table 6.5.2.2.2-1 shall
be supported.
Table 6.5.2.2.2-1: 3GPP vendor specific content subtypes
content subtype Description
* * *
vnd.3gpp.ngap Binary encoded payload, encoding NG Application Protocol (NGAP)
IEs, as specified in clause 9.3 of 3GPP TS 38.413 [9] (ASN.1 encoded). NOTE:
Using 3GPP vendor content subtypes allows to describe the nature of the opaque
payload (i.e. NGAP information) without having to rely on metadata in the JSON
payload.
See clause 6.5.2.4 for the binary payloads supported in the binary body part
of multipart messages.
#### 6.5.2.3 HTTP custom headers
##### 6.5.2.3.1 General
In this release of this specification, no custom headers specific to the
Namf_MBSBroadcast service are defined. For 3GPP specific HTTP custom headers
used across all service-based interfaces, see clause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4].
#### 6.5.2.4 HTTP multipart messages
HTTP multipart messages shall be supported, to transfer opaque N2 Information
in the following service operations (and HTTP messages):
\- ContextCreate Request and Response (POST);
\- ContextUpdate Request and Response (POST);
\- ContextStatusNotify service operation (POST).
HTTP multipart messages shall include one JSON body part and one or more
binary body parts comprising:
\- N2 payload (see clause 6.1.6.4).
The JSON body part shall be the \"root\" body part of the multipart message.
It shall be encoded as the first body part of the multipart message. The
\"Start\" parameter does not need to be included.
The multipart message shall include a \"type\" parameter (see IETF RFC 2387
[9]) specifying the media type of the root body part, i.e.
\"application/json\".
NOTE: The \"root\" body part (or \"root\" object) is the first body part the
application processes when receiving a multipart/related message, see IETF RFC
2387 [9]. The default root is the first body within the multipart/related
message. The \"Start\" parameter indicates the root body part, e.g. when this
is not the first body part in the message.
For each binary body part in a HTTP multipart message, the binary body part
shall include a Content-ID header (see IETF RFC 2045 [10]), and the JSON body
part shall include an attribute, defined with the RefToBinaryData type, that
contains the value of the Content-ID header field of the referenced binary
body part.

### 6.5.8 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.5.8-1 are defined for the Namf_MBSBroadcast
API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in
clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.5.8-1: Supported Features
Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
### 6.5.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Namf_MBSBroadcast API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see
IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [10])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Namf_MBSBroadcast API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS
29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Namf_MBSBroadcast service.
The Namf_MBSBroadcast API defines a single scope \"namf-mbs-bc\" for the
entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or
operation level.
### 6.5.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AMF service instance, within
the same AMF or a different AMF of an AMF set, e.g. when an AMF service
instance is part of an AMF (service) set or when using indirect communications
(see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]).
An SCP that reselects a different AMF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new AMF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an AMF within an AMF set redirects a service request to a different AMF of
the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code,
the identity of the new AMF towards which the service request is redirected
shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary
Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
## 6.6 Namf_MBSCommunication Service API
### 6.6.1 API URI
The Namf_MBSCommunication service shall use the Namf_MBSCommunication API.
The API URI of the Namf_ MBSCommunication API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
The request URI used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in clause
4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"namf-mbs-comm\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.6.3.
### 6.6.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.6.2.1 General
HTTP/2, as defined in IETF RFC 7540 [19], shall be used as specified in clause
5 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP messages and bodies for the Namf_MBSCommunication service shall comply
with the OpenAPI [23] specification contained in Annex A.
#### 6.6.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.6.2.2.1 General
The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in clause
5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
##### 6.6.2.2.2 Content type
The following content types shall be supported:
\- JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [8], shall be used as content type of the
HTTP bodies specified in the present specification as indicated in clause 5.4
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
\- The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 [36]). The use of the
Problem Details JSON object in a HTTP response body shall be signalled by the
content type \"application/problem+json\".
Multipart messages shall also be supported (see clause 6.6.2.4) using the
content type \"multipart/related\", comprising:
\- one JSON body part with the \"application/json\" content type; and
\- one binary body part with 3gpp vendor specific content subtypes.
The 3gpp vendor specific content subtypes defined in Table 6.6.2.2.2-1 shall
be supported.
Table 6.6.2.2.2-1: 3GPP vendor specific content subtypes
content subtype Description
* * *
vnd.3gpp.ngap Binary encoded payload, encoding NG Application Protocol (NGAP)
IEs, as specified in clause 9.3 of 3GPP TS 38.413 [9] (ASN.1 encoded). NOTE:
Using 3GPP vendor content subtypes allows to describe the nature of the opaque
payload (i.e. NGAP information) without having to rely on metadata in the JSON
payload.
See clause 6.6.2.4 for the binary payloads supported in the binary body part
of multipart messages.
#### 6.6.2.3 HTTP custom headers
##### 6.6.2.3.1 General
In this release of this specification, no custom headers specific to the
Namf_MBSCommunication service are defined. For 3GPP specific HTTP custom
headers used across all service-based interfaces, see clause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
#### 6.6.2.4 HTTP multipart messages
HTTP multipart messages shall be supported, to transfer opaque N2 Information
MBS, in the following service operations (and HTTP messages):
\- N2MessageTransfer Request and Response (POST).
HTTP multipart messages shall include one JSON body part and one binary body
part comprising:
\- N2 payload (see clause 6.1.6.4).
The JSON body part shall be the \"root\" body part of the multipart message.
It shall be encoded as the first body part of the multipart message. The
\"Start\" parameter does not need to be included.
The multipart message shall include a \"type\" parameter (see IETF RFC 2387
[9]) specifying the media type of the root body part, i.e.
\"application/json\".
NOTE: The \"root\" body part (or \"root\" object) is the first body part the
application processes when receiving a multipart/related message, see IETF RFC
2387 [9]. The default root is the first body within the multipart/related
message. The \"Start\" parameter indicates the root body part, e.g. when this
is not the first body part in the message.
For each binary body part in a HTTP multipart message, the binary body part
shall include a Content-ID header (see IETF RFC 2045 [10]), and the JSON body
part shall include an attribute, defined with the RefToBinaryData type, that
contains the value of the Content-ID header field of the referenced binary
body part.

### 6.6.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27], the access to the Namf_MBSCommunication
API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749
[28]), using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF
(see 3GPP TS 29.510 [29]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Namf_ MBSCommunication API, shall obtain a \"token\"
from the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service,
as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [29], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Namf_MBSCommunication service.
The Namf_ MBSCommunication API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [27]; it defines a single scope consisting on the
name of the service (i.e., \"namf-mbs-comm\"), and it does not define any
additional scopes at resource or operation level.
### 6.6.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AMF service instance, within
the same AMF or a different AMF of an AMF set, e.g. when an AMF service
instance is part of an AMF (service) set or when using indirect communications
(see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]).
An SCP that reselects a different AMF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new AMF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an AMF within an AMF set redirects a service request to a different AMF of
the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code,
the identity of the new AMF towards which the service request is redirected
shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary
Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the API definition of the service provided by AMF in this
document. The APIs are defined by OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications in YAML format,
following guidelines in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
The APIs for specified for following services:
\- Namf_Communication Service
\- Namf_EventExposure Service
\- Namf_MT Service
\- Namf_Location Service
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE : The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository, that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1
and 3GPP TR 21.900 [37] clause 5B).

###### ## Annex B (Informative): HTTP Multipart Messages
# B.1 Example of HTTP multipart message
## B.1.1 General
This clause provides a (partial) example of HTTP multipart message. The
example does not aim to be a complete representation of the HTTP message, e.g.
additional information or headers can be included.
This Annex is informative and the normative descriptions in this specification
prevail over the description in this Annex if there is any difference.
