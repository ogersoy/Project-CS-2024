## 5.2 Nausf_UEAuthentication Service
### 5.2.1 Service Description
The AUSF is acting as NF Service Producer. It provides UE authentication
service to the requester NF. The NF Service Consumer is the AMF.
For this service, the following service operations are defined:
\- Authenticate
This service permits to authenticate the UE and to provide one or more master
keys which are used by the AMF to derived subsequent keys.
### 5.2.2 Service Operations
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
The service operation defined for the Nausf_UEAuthentication is as follows:
\- Authenticate: It allows the AMF to authenticate the UE and allows the AMF
to inform AUSF to remove the UE authentication result in the UDM.
\- Deregister: It allows UDM to request the AUSF to clear the Security
Context.
\- **ProseAuthenticate** : It allows the AUSF of the 5G ProSe Remote UE to
support the authentication of a 5G ProSe Remote UE via the AMF of the 5G ProSe
UE-to-Network Relay.
#### 5.2.2.2 Authenticate
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
The service operation \"Authenticate\" permits the requester NF to initiate
the Authentication of the UE by providing the following information to the
AUSF:
\- UE id (i.e. SUPI or SUCI)
\- Serving Network Name
The AUSF retrieves the UE\'s subscribed authentication method from the UDM and
depending on the information provided by the UDM, the AUSF enters in one of
the following procedures:
\- 5G-AKA
\- EAP-based authentication\'
For those two different procedures a new resource is generated by the AUSF.
The content of the resource will depend on the procedure and will be returned
to the AMF.
This service operation \"Authenticate\" also permits the requester NF to
initiate the Authentication of the FN-RG registration via W-AGF by providing
the following information to the AUSF:
\- UE id (i.e. SUCI)
\- Indication that the W-AGF has authenticated the FN-RG
The AUSF retrieves the UE\'s SUPI, indication that authentication is not
required for the FN-RG from the UDM, and AUSF shall not perform the
authentication.
The service operation \"Authenticate\" also permits the requester NF to inform
the AUSF to remove the UE authentication result in the UDM.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 5G AKA
In this procedure, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) requests the authentication
of the UE by providing UE related information and the Serving Network Name to
the NF Service Producer (AUSF), which retrieves UE related data and
authentication method from the UDM. In this case the retrieved authentication
method is 5G AKA. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall then return to the AUSF
the result received from the UE:
Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1: 5G AKA
1\. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request to the AUSF. The
payload of the body shall contain at least the UE Id and the Serving Network
Name.
2a. On success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned. The payload body shall
contain the representation of the resource created and the \"Location\" header
shall contain the URI of the created resource (e.g.
.../ue_authentications/{authCtxId}). The AUSF generates a sub-resource
\"5g-aka-confirmation\". There shall be only one sub-resource \"5g-aka-
confirmation\" per UE per Serving Network identified by the supiOrSuci and
servingNetworkName in AuthenticationInfo. The AUSF shall provide an hypermedia
link towards this sub-resource in the payload to indicate to the AMF where it
shall send a PUT for the confirmation.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3. If the serving network is
not authorized, the AUSF shall use the SERVING_NETWORK_NOT_AUTHORIZED
\"cause\".
3\. Based on the relation type, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) deduces that it
shall send a PUT containing the \"RES*\" provided by the UE to the URI
provided by the AUSF or derived by itself. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall
also send a PUT containing null value in the RES* to indicate the failure to
the AUSF for the following cases:
\- if the UE is not reached, and the RES* is never received by the NF Service
Consumer (AMF);
\- the comparation of the HRES* and HXRES* is unsuccessful in the NF Service
Consumer (AMF);
\- the authentication failure is received from the UE, e.g. synchronization
failure or MAC failure;
4a. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned. If the UE is not authenticated,
e.g. the verification of the RES* was not successful in the AUSF, the AUSF
shall set the value of AuthResult to AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE.
In SNPN onboarding scenarios, if the UE is authenticated successfully, the
AUSF may include in the response the FQDN(s) and/or IP address(es) of an
onboarding Provisioning Server (PVS) to the NF Service Consumer (AMF); see
3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.30.2.10.
4b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.3.3.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.3.3.1-3.
##### 5.2.2.2.3 EAP-based authentication method
##### 5.2.2.2.3.1 General {#general-1 .H6}
In this procedure, the NF Service Consumer requests the authentication of the
UE by providing UE related information and the serving network and the EAP-
based authentication is selected (see IETF RFC 3748 [18]). EAP messages are
exchanged between a UE acting as EAP peer, an NF Service Consumer (AMF/SEAF,
NSWOF) acting as a pass-through authenticator and the AUSF acting as the EAP
server.
##### 5.2.2.2.3.2 EAP method: EAP-AKA\' {#eap-method-eap-aka .H6}
EAP-AKA\' is the EAP method used in this procedure
Figure 5.2.2.2.3-1: EAP-based authentication with EAP-AKA\' method
1\. The NF Service Consumer (AMF, NSWOF) shall send a POST request to the
AUSF. The payload of the body shall contain at least the UE Id, Serving
Network Name. If the consumer is an NSWOF the NSWO Indicator shall be present
in the payload of the body.
2a. On success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned. The payload body shall
contain the representation of the resource generated and the \"Location\"
header shall contain the URI of the generated resource (e.g.
.../ue_authentications/{authCtxId}). The AUSF generates a sub-resource \"eap-
session\". There shall be only one sub-resource \"eap-session\" per UE per
Serving Network identified by the supiOrSuci and servingNetworkName in
AuthenticationInfo. The AUSF shall provide a hypermedia link towards this sub-
resource in the payload to indicate to the AMF or NSWOF where it shall send a
POST containing the EAP packet response. The body payload shall also contain
the EAP packet EAP-Request/AKA\'-Challenge.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3. In particular, if the
serving network is not authorized, the AUSF shall use the \"Cause\"
SERVING_NETWORK_NOT_AUTHORIZED.
3\. Based on the relation type, the NF Service Consumer (AMF, NSOWF) shall
send a POST request including the EAP-Response/AKA\' Challenge received from
the UE. The POST request is sent to the URI provided by the AUSF or derived by
the NF Service Consumer (AMF, NSWOF).
4a. On success, and if the AUSF and the UE have indicated the use of protected
successful result indications as in IETF RFC 9048 [17], the AUSF shall reply
with a \"200 OK\" HTTP message containing the EAP Request/AKA\' Notification
and an hypermedia link towards the sub-resource \"eap-session\".
4b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.3.4.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3.
NOTE: Steps 4 to 5 are optional.
5\. The NF Service Consumer (AMF, NSWOF) shall send a POST request including
the EAP Response/AKA\' Notification received from the UE. The POST request is
sent to the URI provided by the AUSF or derived by the NF Service Consumer
(AMF, NSWOF).
6a. If the EAP authentication exchange is successfully completed (with or
without the optional Notification Request/Response messages exchange), \"200
OK\" shall be returned to the NF Service Consumer (AMF, NSWOF). The payload
shall contain the result of the authentication, an EAP success/failure and if
the authentication is successful the Kseaf if the consumer is an AMF or the
MSK if the consumer is a NSWOF (as indicated by the NSWO indicator received in
step 1). If the UE is not authenticated, the AUSF shall set the authResult to
AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE.
In SNPN onboarding scenarios, if the UE is authenticated successfully, the
AUSF may include in the response the FQDN(s) and/or IP address(es) of an
onboarding Provisioning Server (PVS) to the NF Service Consumer (AMF) ; see
3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.30.2.10.
6b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.3.4.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3.
##### 5.2.2.2.3.3 EAP method: EAP-TLS {#eap-method-eap-tls .H6}
The EAP-TLS method can be used in private networks as an EAP method (see 3GPP
TS 33.501 [8] Annex B.1). The corresponding stage 3 implementation is
described in Annex B.
The EAP-TLS method is applicable for N5GC devices behind Cable RGs in private
networks or in deployment scenarios with wireline access; see 3GPP TS 33.501
[8] Annex O.
##### 5.2.2.2.3.4 EAP method: EAP-TTLS {#eap-method-eap-ttls .H6}
The EAP-TTLS method can be used as an EAP method (see 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] Annex
U) in case of UE access to SNPN using credentials from Credential Holder with
AAA Server.
##### 5.2.2.2.4 Authentication for FN-RG
In this procedure, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) requests the authentication
of the FN-RG registration via W-AGF by providing the SUCI of the FN-RG and the
authenticated indication.
Figure 5.2.2.2.4-1: Authentication for FN-RG
1\. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request to the AUSF. The
payload of the body shall contain at least the UE Id and the authenticated
indication.
2a. On success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned. The payload body shall
contain the representation of the resource created and the \"Location\" header
shall contain the URI of the created resource (e.g. .../rg-
authentications/{authCtxId}).
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.3.4.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3.
##### 5.2.2.2.5 Authentication Result Removal with 5G AKA method
In the case that the Purge of subscriber data in AMF after the UE deregisters
from the network or the NAS SMC fails following the successful authentication
in the registration procedure, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) requests the AUSF
to inform the UDM to remove the authentication result:
Figure 5.2.2.2.5-1: Authentication Result Removal with 5G AKA method
1\. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a DELETE request to the resource
URI representing the sub-resource \"5g-aka-confirmation\". The request body
shall be empty.
2a. On success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned. The AUSF shall send a
DELETE request to the UDM for removing the authentication result of the UE
after receiving the above DELETE request message.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.3.3.3.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may

the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.4.3.2-3.
#### 5.2.2.3 Deregister
##### 5.2.2.3.1 General
The Deregister service operation is used in the following scenario:
\- Deletion of security context in AUSF
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) uses this service operation to request the
AUSF to clear the stale security context, after the UE has been successfully
(re)authenticated in same or different Serving Network via another AUSF
Instance, e.g. due to registration via another access-type; so as to ensure
only latest Kausf is maintained in the network. The service may also be used
by UDM when the UE is no longer registered via any access-type or serving-
network. It is responsibility of NF Service Consumers to ensure that security
context being deleted does not hold the latest Kausf if UE is also connected
via another Serving-Network.
Figure 5.2.2.3.1-1: UE Context Clean-up in AUSF
1\. The NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) shall send a POST request to the AUSF
that was used to authenticate the UE. The payload of the body shall contain
the UE id (e.g. SUPI).
2a. On success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.3.2.4.2.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one
of the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.2.2-2.
#### 5.2.2.4 ProseAuthenticate
##### 5.2.2.4.1 General
The ProseAuthenticate service operation is used in the following scenario:
\- Authenticate the 5G ProSe Remote UE in AUSF
The NF Service Consumer (AMF) requests the authentication of the 5G ProSe
Remote UE by providing 5G ProSe Remote UE related information (SUCI or CP-PRUK
ID), the Relay Service Code and Nonce_1 to the NF Service Producer (AUSF) in
the initial authentication request. When CP-PRUK ID is provided, the AUSF
shall retrieve the CP-PRUK from PAnF; when SUCI is provided, the AUSF
retrieves 5G ProSe Remote UE related data and authentication method from the
UDM. In this case the retrieved authentication method is EAP-AKA. The NF
Service Consumer (AMF) shall then return to the AUSF the result received from
the 5G ProSe Remote UE to continue the authentication:
Figure 5.2.2.4.1-1: ProSe Authentication
1\. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request to the AUSF. The
payload of the body shall contain the UE Id (SUCI) or CP-PRUK ID, Relay
Service Code and Nonce_1.
2a. On success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned if UE Id (SUCI) is received.
The payload body shall contain the representation of the resource generated
and the \"Location\" header shall contain the URI of the generated resource
(e.g. .../prose_authentications/{authCtxId}). The AUSF generates a sub-
resource \"prose-auth\". There shall be only one sub-resource \"prose-auth\"
per UE identified by the supiOrSuci in ProSeAuthenticationInfo. The AUSF shall
provide a hypermedia link towards this sub-resource in the payload to indicate
to the AMF where it shall send a POST containing the EAP packet response. The
body payload shall also contain the EAP packet EAP-Request/AKA\'-Challenge.
2b. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned if CP-PRUK ID is received. The
payload body shall contain the K~NR_ProSe~ and Nonce_2. Step 3 to 6 are
skipped.
2c. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3.
3\. Based on the relation type, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a
POST request including the EAP-Response/AKA\' Challenge received from the 5G
ProSe Remote UE. The POST request is sent to the URI provided by the AUSF or
derived by the NF Service Consumer (AMF).
4a. On success, and if the AUSF and the UE have indicated the use of protected
successful result indications as in IETF RFC 5448 [9] (to be superseded by

## 5.3 Nausf_SoRProtection Service
### 5.3.1 Service Description
The AUSF is acting as NF Service Producer. It provides SoRProtection service
to the NF Service Consumer.
This service permits to provide the NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) with the
SoR-MAC-IAUSF and CounterSoR to protect the Steering Information from being
tampered with or removed by the VPLMN.
NOTE: If the Steering Information is not available or HPLMN determines that no
steering of the UE is required, a SOR transparent container information
element with an HPLMN indication that \'no change of the \"Operator Controlled
PLMN Selector with Access Technology\" list stored in the UE protected by SoR-
MAC-IAUSF and CounterSoR is still sent to the UE during registration. The
Steering Information in such a case, the NF Service Consumer shall send an
empty list to the AUSF when consuming the Nausf_SoRProtection Service.
In option this service also allows to provide the NF Service Consumer (e.g.
UDM) with the SoR-XMAC-IUE that allows the NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) to
verify that the UE received the Steering Information List.
### 5.3.2 Service Operations
#### 5.3.2.1 Introduction
The service operation defined for the Nausf_SoRProtection is as follows:
\- Protect
#### 5.3.2.2 Protect
##### 5.3.2.2.1 General
The Protect service operation is used in the following procedures:
\- Procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN during registration (see clause
6.14.2.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [8]);
\- Procedure for steering of UE in VPLMN after registration (see clause
6.14.2.2 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [8]).
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) uses this service operation to request the
AUSF to compute the SoR-MAC-IAUSF and the CounterSoR by providing Steering
Information. The NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) may also request the AUSF to
compute the SoR-XMAC-IUE by providing the indication that an acknowledgement
is requested from the UE.
Figure 5.3.2.2.1-1: Steering of UE in VPLMN
1\. The NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) shall send a POST request to the AUSF
that was used to authenticate the UE. The payload of the body shall contain
the Steering Information and the acknowledge indication.
2a. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned. The payload body shall contain
the requested security material (e.g. SoR-MAC-I~AUSF~, Counter~SoR~, SoR-
XMAC-I~UE~) necessary to protect the Steering of Roaming procedure.
SoR Header shall be used to form the input as one of multiple parameters to
calculate the SoR-MAC-I~AUSF~. If SoRHeader attribute is not provided by NF
Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) as part of SorInfo, SoR Header shall be
constructed by AUSF based on the information received in the request and
encoded as specified in clause 9.11.3.51 of 3GPP TS 24.501[20].
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.2.3.2.4.2.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
may contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one
of the application error listed in Table 6.2.3.2.4.2.2-21. If the Counter~SoR~
associated with the K~AUSF~ of the UE, is about to wrap around, the AUSF shall
use the \"COUNTER-WRAP\" cause.
## 5.4 Nausf_UPUProtection Service
### 5.4.1 Service Description
The AUSF is acting as NF Service Producer. It provides UPUProtection service
to the NF Service Consumer.
This service permits to provide the NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) with the
UPU-MAC-I~AUSF~ and Counter~UPU~ to protect the UE Parameters Update Data from
being tampered with or removed.
In option this service also allows to provide the NF Service Consumer (e.g.
UDM) with the UPU-XMAC-I~UE~ that allows the NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) to
verify that the UE received UE Parameters Update Data correctly.
### 5.4.2 Service Operations
#### 5.4.2.1 Introduction
The service operation defined for the Nausf_UPUProtection is as follows:

### 6.1.7 Error Handling
#### 6.1.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
The Cause codes mapping performed by AMF between the following HTTP responses
returned by the AUSF services to the AMF and the 5GMM related values is
specified in clause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.524 [24].
#### 6.1.7.2 Protocol Errors
Protocol errors shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.7 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
#### 6.1.7.3 Application Errors
The common application errors defined in the Table 5.2.7.2-1 in 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] may also be used for the Nausf_UEAuthentication service. The following
application errors listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1 are specific for the
Nausf_UEAuthentication service.
Table 6.1.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
SERVING_NETWORK_NOT_AUTHORIZED 403 Forbidden The serving network is not
authorized, e.g. serving PLMN. AUTHENTICATION_REJECTED 403 Forbidden The user
cannot be authenticated with this authentication method e.g. only SIM data
available INVALID_HN_PUBLIC_KEY_IDENTIFIER 403 Forbidden Invalid HN public key
identifier received INVALID_SCHEME_OUTPUT 403 Forbidden SUCI cannot be
decrypted with received data CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found The AUSF cannot
found the resource corresponding to the URI provided by the NF Service
Consumer. USER_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found The user does not exist in the HPLMN
UPSTREAM_SERVER_ERROR 504 Gateway Timeout No response is received from a
remote peer, e.g. from the UDM NETWORK_FAILURE 504 Gateway Timeout The request
is rejected due to a network problem. AV_GENERATION_PROBLEM 500 Internal
Server Error The UDM has indicated that it was not able to generate AV.
UNSUPPORTED_PROTECTION_SCHEME 501 Not implemented The received protection
scheme is not supported by HPLMN
### 6.1.8 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8], the access to the Nausf_UEAuthentication
Service API may be authorized by means of the Oauth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [13]), using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the
NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [14]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming service offered
by the Nausf_UEAuthentication Service API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [14], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nausf_UEAuthentication service.
The Nausf_UEAuthentication Service API defines the following scopes.
Table 6.1.8-1: OAuth2 scopes defined in Nausf_UEAuthentication API
Scope Description
* * *
\"nausf-auth\" Access to the Nausf_UEAuthentication API. \"nausf-auth:ue-
authentications\" Access to service operations applying to the collection of
the ue-authentication resources and the subresources, i.e. 5g-aka-confirmation
and eap-session. \"nausf-auth:rg-authentications\" Access to service
operations applying to the collection of the rg-authentication resources.
\"nausf-auth:prose-authentications\" Access to service operations applying to
the collection of the prose-authentication resources and the subresources,
i.e. prose-auth.
### 6.1.9 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.1.9-1 are defined for the
Nausf_UEAuthentication API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility
mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.1.9-1: Supported Features
+----------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+ | Feature number | Feature Name | M/O | Description | +================+==============+=====+======================+ | 1 | ES3XX | M | Extended Support of | | | | | HTTP 307/308 | | | | | redirection | | | | | | | | | | An NF Service | | | | | Consumer (e.g. AMF) | | | | | that supports this | | | | | feature shall | | | | | support handling of | | | | | HTTP 307/308 | | | | | redirection for any | | | | | service operation of | | | | | the UEAuthentication | | | | | service. An NF | | | | | Service Consumer | | | | | that does not | | | | | support this feature | | | | | does only support | | | | | HTTP redirection as | | | | | specified for 3GPP | | | | | Release 15. | +----------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+
### 6.1.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AUSF service instance, within
the same AUSF or a different AUSF of an AUSF set, e.g. when an AUSF service
instance is part of an AUSF (service) set or when using indirect
communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See also the ES3XX feature in clause
6.1.10.
An SCP that reselects a different AUSF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new AUSF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an AUSF within an AUSF set redirects a service request to a different AUSF
of the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status
code, the identity of the new AUSF towards which the service request is
redirected shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause
6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
## 6.2 Nausf_SoRProtection Service API
### 6.2.1 API URI
URIs of this API shall have the following root:
{apiRoot}/\/\
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards
the NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in
clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [6].
\- The \ shall be \"nausf-sorprotection\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.2.3.
### 6.2.2 Usage of HTTP

#### 6.2.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
#### 6.2.7.2 Protocol Errors
Protocol Error Handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.7.2 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 6.2.7.3 Application Errors
The common application errors defined in the Table 5.2.7.2-1 in 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] may also be used for the Nausf_SoRProtection service. The following
application errors listed in Table 6.2.7.3-1 are specific for the
Nausf_SoRProtection service.
Table 6.2.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
COUNTER_WRAP 503 Service Unavailable The Counter~SoR~ associated with the
KAUSF of the UE is about to wrap around. The AUSF suspends the SoR protection
service for the UE until a new KAUSF is generated.
### 6.2.8 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8], the access to the Nausf_SoRProtection API
may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [13]),
using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP
TS 29.510 [14]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nausf_SoRProtection API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [14], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nausf_SoRProtection service.
The Nausf_SoRProtection Service API defines a single scope nausf-sorprotection
(as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8]), and it does not define any additional
scopes at resource or operation level.
### 6.2.9 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.2.9-1 are defined for the Nausf_SoRProtection
API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in
clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.2.9-1: Supported Features

An NF | | | | | Service Consumer | | | | | that does not | | | | | support this | | | | | feature does only | | | | | support HTTP | | | | | redirection as | | | | | specified for | | | | | 3GPP Release 15. | +----------------+-------------------+-----+-------------------+ | 2 | sorT | O | This flag is used | | | ransparentSupport | | by AUSF to | | | | | register (in NRF) | | | | | its support of | | | | | receiving SoR | | | | | Transparent | | | | | Information | | | | | instead of | | | | | individual IEs | | | | | from UDM. | +----------------+-------------------+-----+-------------------+
### 6.2.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AUSF service instance, within
the same AUSF or a different AUSF of an AUSF set, e.g. when an AUSF service
instance is part of an AUSF (service) set or when using indirect
communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See also the ES3XX feature in clause
6.2.9.
An SCP that reselects a different AUSF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new AUSF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an AUSF within an AUSF set redirects a service request to a different AUSF
of the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status
code, the identity of the new AUSF towards which the service request is
redirected shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause
6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
## 6.3 Nausf_UPUProtection Service API
### 6.3.1 API URI
URIs of this API shall have the following root:
{apiRoot}/{apiName}/\
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards
the NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in
clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [6].
\- The \ shall be \"nausf-upuprotection\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.3.3.

##### 6.3.6.3.3 Void
### 6.3.7 Error Handling
#### 6.3.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
#### 6.3.7.2 Protocol Errors
Protocol Error Handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.7.2 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 6.3.7.3 Application Errors
The common application errors defined in the Table 5.2.7.2-1 in 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] may also be used for the Nausf_UPUProtection service. The following
application errors listed in Table 6.3.7.3-1 are specific for the
Nausf_UPUProtection service.
Table 6.3.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
COUNTER_WRAP 503 Service Unavailable The Counter~UPU~ associated with the
K~AUSF~ of the UE is about to wrap around. The AUSF suspends the UPU
protection service for the UE until a new K~AUSF~ is generated.
### 6.3.8 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8], the access to the Nausf_UPUProtection API
may be authorized by means of the Oauth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [13]),
using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP
TS 29.510 [14]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If Oauth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nausf_UPUProtection API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [14], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nausf_UPUProtection service.
The Nausf_UPUProtection Service API does not define any scopes for Oauth2
authorization as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8]; it defines a single scope
consisting on the name of the service (i.e., \"nausf-upuprotection\"), and it
does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
### 6.3.9 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.3.9-1 are defined for the Nausf_UPUProtection
API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in
clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.3.9-1: Supported Features
+----------------+-------------------+-----+-------------------+ | Feature number | Feature Name | M/O | Description | +================+===================+=====+===================+ | 1 | ES3XX | M | Extended Support | | | | | of HTTP 307/308 | | | | | redirection | | | | | | | | | | An NF Service | | | | | Consumer (e.g. | | | | | UDM) that | | | | | supports this | | | | | feature shall | | | | | support handling | | | | | of HTTP 307/308 | | | | | redirection for | | | | | any service | | | | | operation of the | | | | | UPUProtection | | | | | service. An NF | | | | | Service Consumer | | | | | that does not | | | | | support this | | | | | feature does only | | | | | support HTTP | | | | | redirection as | | | | | specified for | | | | | 3GPP Release 15. | +----------------+-------------------+-----+-------------------+ | 2 | upuT | O | This flag is used | | | ransparentSupport | | by AUSF to | | | | | register (in NRF) | | | | | its support of | | | | | receiving UPU | | | | | Transparent | | | | | Information | | | | | instead of | | | | | individual Ies | | | | | from UDM | +----------------+-------------------+-----+-------------------+
### 6.3.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AUSF service instance, within
the same AUSF or a different AUSF of an AUSF set, e.g. when an AUSF service
instance is part of an AUSF (service) set or when using indirect
communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See also the ES3XX feature in clause
6.3.9.
An SCP that reselects a different AUSF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new AUSF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an AUSF within an AUSF set redirects a service request to a different AUSF
of the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status
code, the identity of the new AUSF towards which the service request is
redirected shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause
6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the Nausf Service API(s). It
consists of OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications in YAML format.
NOTE 1: OpenAPI 3.0 does not support description of API using HATEOAS. Indeed,
only relative paths can be used and as a consequence the URI provided in the
\"href\" cannot be reused as it is.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE 2: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1
and 3GPP TR 21.900 [21] clause 5B).

###### ## Annex B (Informative): Use of EAP-TLS
# B.1 General
The Annex B of 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] describes the use of EAP-TLS as an
alternative authentication method in the case of private network. This annex
describes corresponding stage 3.
# B.2 EAP method: EAP-TLS
EAP-TLS as defined in IETF RFC 5216 [16] is the EAP method used in this
procedure. This procedure is described in Annex B.2.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [8].
Figure B.2-1: EAP method
1\. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request to the AUSF. The
payload of the body shall contain at least the UE Id and Serving Network Name.
2a. On success, \"201 Created\" shall be returned. The payload body shall
contain the representation of the resource generated and the \"Location\"
header shall contain the URI of the generated resource (e.g.
.../ue_authentications/{authCtxId}/eap-session). The AUSF generates a sub-
resource \"eap-session\". The AUSF shall provide a hypermedia link towards
this sub-resource in the payload to indicate to the AMF where it shall send a
POST containing the EAP packet response. The body payload shall also contain
the EAP packet EAP-Request/EAP-Type=EAP-TLS (TLS Start)
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.7.3-1 shall be returned with the message body containing a ProblemDetails
structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error
listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1. In particular, if the serving network is not
authorized, the AUSF shall use the \"Cause\" SERVING_NETWORK_NOT_AUTHORIZED.
3\. Based on the relation type, the NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a
POST request including the EAP-Response/EAP-Type=EAP-TLS (TLS client_hello)
received from the UE. The POST request is sent to the URI provided by the AUSF
or derived by the NF Service Consumer (AMF).
4a. On success, the AUSF shall reply with a \"200 OK\" HTTP message containing
the EAP Request as described in Annex B.2.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and a
hypermedia link towards the sub-resource \"eap-session\".
4b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.7.3-1 shall be returned with the message body containing a ProblemDetails
structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error
listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1.
5\. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request including the EAP
Response received from the UE. The POST request is sent to the URI provided by
the AUSF or derived by the NF Service Consumer (AMF).
6a. On success, the AUSF shall reply with a \"200 OK\" HTTP message containing
the EAP Request as described in Annex B.2.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and a
hypermedia link towards the sub-resource \"eap-session\".
6b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.7.3-1 shall be returned with the message body containing a ProblemDetails
structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error
listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1.
7\. The NF Service Consumer (AMF) shall send a POST request including the EAP
Response received from the UE. The POST request is sent to the URI provided by
the AUSF or derived by the NF Service Consumer (AMF).
8a. If the EAP authentication exchange is successfully completed (with or
without the optional Notification Request/Response messages exchange), \"200
OK\" shall be returned to the NF Service Consumer (AMF). The payload shall
contain the result of the authentication, an EAP success/failure and the Kseaf
if the authentication is successful.
8b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in table
6.1.7.3-1 shall be returned with the message body containing a ProblemDetails
structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application error
listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Withdrawn API versions
# C.1 General
This Annex lists withdrawn API versions of the APIs defined in the present
specification. 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 4.3.1.6 describes the withdrawal of
API versions.
# C.2 Nausf_SoRProtection API
The API versions listed in table C.2-1 are withdrawn for the
Nausf_SoRProtection API.
Table C.2-1: Withdrawn API versions of the Nausf_SoRProtection service
API version number Reason for withdrawal
* * *
1.0.0 The version 1.0.0 indicates that a 201 \"Created\" must be sent in
response to the POST Custom Operations while it should be a \"200 OK\" as
indicated in clause 6.2.3.2.4.2.2. The version 1.0.1 corrects this mistake. As
a consequence, the version 1.0.0 is withdrawn in order to avoid
interoperability problems with further version of the Nausf_SoRProtection
service.
