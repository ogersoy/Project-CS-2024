# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

MNPF Mobile Number Portability Function
# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Introduction
Within the 5GC, the MNPF offers services to the SMS-GMSC, NRF and SCP via the
Nmnpf service based interface (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], and
3GPP TS 23.540 [14]).
Figure 4.1-1 provides the reference model (in service based interface
representation and in reference point representation), with focus on the MNPF.
Figure 4.1-1: Reference model -- MNPF
The functionalities supported by the MNPF are listed in clause 6.7 of 3GPP TS
23.540 [14].
# 5 Services offered by the MNPF
## 5.1 Introduction
The MNPF offers the following services via the Nmnpf interface:
\- Nmnpf_NPStatus Service
Table 5.1-1 summarizes the corresponding APIs defined for this specification.

### 5.2.1 Service Description
See 3GPP TS 23.540 [14] clause 6.7.1.
### 5.2.2 Service Operations
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
For the Nmnpf_NPStatus service the following service operations are defined:
\- Get
The Nmnpf_NPStatus Service is used by Consumer NFs (SMS-GMSC, NRF, SCP) to
retrieve the UE\'s subscription network by means of the Get service operation.
#### 5.2.2.2 Get
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
This clause provides a general description of the Get service operation.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 MNPF Status information retrieval
Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. SMS-
GMSC, NRF, SCP) sends a request to the MNPF to receive the UE\'s Subscription
Network (see also clause 5.1.7.2, clause 5.1.7.3 and clause 5.1.7.4 of 3GPP TS
23.540 [14]. The request contains the UE\'s identity (/{gpsi}).
Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1: Requesting a UE\'s NP statusI
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. SMS-GMSC, NRF, SCP) sends a GET request to
the resource representing the UE\'s number portability status.
2a. On success, the MNPF responds with \"200 OK\" with the message body
containing the UE\'s Number Portability Status Information.
2b. If there is no valid information for the UE, HTTP status code \"404 Not
Found\" shall be returned including additional error information in the
response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the GET response body.

errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] shall be supported
for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as
mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Nmnpf_NPStatus API.
#### 6.1.7.2 Protocol Errors

Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
### 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nmnpf_NPStatus API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF
RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [10]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nmnpf_NPStatus API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS
29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nmnpf_NPStatus service.
The Nmnpf_NPStatus API defines a single scope \"nmnpf-npstatus\" for the
entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or
operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the
present specification. It consists of OpenAPI specifications in YAML format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE 1: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5.3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]
and clause 5B of 3GPP TR 21.900 [7]).
