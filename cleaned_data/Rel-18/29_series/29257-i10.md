In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

### 6.4.9 Security
The provisions of clause 6 of 3GPP TS 29.122 [2] shall apply for the
UAE_DAASupport API.
# 7 Using Common API Framework
## 7.1 General
When CAPIF is used with a UAE Server service, the UAE Server shall support the
following functionalities as defined in 3GPP TS 29.222 [10]:
\- the API exposing function and the related APIs over CAPIF-2/2e and
CAPIF-3/3e reference points;
\- the API publishing function and the related APIs over CAPIF-4/4e reference
point;
\- the API management function and the related APIs over CAPIF-5/5e reference
point; and
\- at least one of the security methods for authentication and authorization,
and the related security mechanisms.
In a centralized deployment as defined in 3GPP TS 23.222 [9], where the CAPIF
core function and the API provider domain functions are co-located, the
interactions between the CAPIF core function and the API provider domain
functions may be independent of the CAPIF-3/3e, CAPIF-4/4e and CAPIF-5/5e
reference points.
When CAPIF is used with a UAE Server service, the UAE Server shall register
all the northbound APIs features in the CAPIF Core Function.
## 7.2 Security
When CAPIF is used for external exposure, before invoking an API exposed by
the UAE Server, the service API consumer (e.g. UASS) acting as an API invoker
shall negotiate the security method (PKI, TLS-PSK or OAuth 2.0) with the CAPIF
core function and ensure that the UAE Server has enough credentials to
authenticate the service API consumer (e.g. UASS), as defined in clauses
5.6.2.2 and 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.222 [10].
If PKI or TLS-PSK is selected as the security method to be used between the
service API consumer (e.g. UASS) and the UAE Server, upon API invocation, the
UAE Server shall retrieve the authorization information from the CAPIF core
function as described in clause 5.6.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.222 [10].
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.122 [11], the access to the UAE Server APIs may be
authorized by means of the OAuth 2.0 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [12]), using
the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the CAPIF core function
(see 3GPP TS 29.222 [10]) plays the role of the authorization server.
NOTE 1: In this release, only \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant is
supported.
If OAuth 2.0 is selected as the security method to be used between the service
API consumer (e.g. UASS) and the UAE Server, the service API consumer (e.g.
UASS) shall, prior to consuming the services offered by the UAE Server APIs,
obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by invoking the
Obtain_Authorization service operation as described in clause 5.6.2.3.2 of
3GPP TS 29.222 [10].
The UAE Server APIs do not define any scopes for OAuth 2.0 authorization. It
is the UAE Server responsibility to check whether the service API consumer
(e.g. UASS) is authorized to use an API based on the provided \"token\". Once
the UAE Server verifies the \"token\", it shall check whether the UAE Server
identifier in the \"token\" matches its own published identifier, and whether
the API name in the \"token\" matches its own published API name. If those
checks are passed, the service API consumer (e.g. UASS) has full authority to
access any resource or operation provided by the invoked API.
NOTE 2: For the aforementioned security methods, the UAE Server needs to apply
admission control according to access control policies after performing the
authorization checks.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the
present specification. It consists of OpenAPI specifications in YAML format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE 1: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5.3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [3]
and clause 5B of 3GPP TR 21.900 [5]).
