# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

All scenarios shown in the following clauses assume that the UDM is stateful
and stores information in local memory. However, the UDM may be stateless and
stores information externally in the UDR. If so, the stateless UDM makes use
of Nudr services as specified in 3GPP TS 29.504 [9] and 3GPP TS 29.505 [10] to
retrieve required data from the UDR and store them locally before processing
an incoming request. Processing the incoming request may then include updating
data in the UDR or subscribing to data change notifications at the UDR by
consuming the appropriate Nudr services. After processing the incoming
request, the UDM may delete the locally stored data. When data stored in UDR
is then shared among the different UDM instances of the same group, as
identified by UDM Group ID (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 6.2.6), bulk
subscriptions, as described in clause 4.15.3.2.4 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], are
not applicable, i.e. an NF consumer (e.g. NEF) only subscribes towards one of
the UDM instances within the group. See Annex B.
## 5.2 Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement Service
### 5.2.1 Service Description
See 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] table 7.2.5-1.
### 5.2.2 Service Operations
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
For the Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement service the following service operations
are defined:
\- Get
\- Subscribe
\- ModifySubscription
\- Unsubscribe
\- Notification
\- Info
The Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement Service is used by Consumer NFs (AMF, SMF,
SMSF, GMLC, NEF, 5G DDNMF, NWDAF, DCCF, trusted AF) to retrieve the UE\'s
individual subscription data relevant to the consumer NF from the UDM by means
of the Get service operation. If the consumer NF supports the feature
\"sharedData\" (see clause 6.1.8), the retrieved individual subscription data
for the UE may contain shared data identifier identifying additional parts of
subscription data shared by several UEs. If so, the
Nudm_SubscriberDataManagement Service is also used by Consumer NFs to retrieve
shared subscription data from the UDM by means of the Get service operation
unless the shared data is already cached. The retrieved shared data shall be
cached as long as the consumer NF serves an UE for which the shared data is
relevant.
It is also used by Consumer NFs to subscribe to notifications of data change
by means of the Subscribe service operation. If the consumer NF supports the
feature \"sharedData\" (see clause 6.1.8), the consumer NF may also subscribe
to notifications of shared data change by means of the Subscribe service
operation.
It is also used to modify an existing subscription by means of the
ModifySubscription service operation. If the consumer NF supports the feature
\"sharedData\" (see clause 6.1.8), the consumer NF may also modify an existing
subscription to notifications of shared data change by means of the
ModifySubscription service operation.
It is also used to unsubscribe from notifications of data changes by means of
the Unsubscribe service operation. If the feature \"sharedData\" (see clause
6.1.8) is supported, it may also be used to unsubscribe from notifications of
shared data changes by means of the Unsubscribe service operation.
It is also used by the Consumer NFs (AMF, SMF, SMSF, NEF, GMLC, 5G DDNMF,
NWDAF, DCCF, trusted AF) that have previously subscribed, to get notified by
means of the Notification service operation when UDM decides to modify the
subscribed data. If the feature \"sharedData\" (see clause 6.1.8) is supported
by the consumer NF and the consumer NF has previously subscribed to
notifications of shared data change, it is also used by the consumer NF to get
notified by means of the Notification service operation when the UDM decides
to modify the subscribed shared data.
It is also used by Consumer NFs to provide the information about the status of
the subscription data management procedures.
#### 5.2.2.2 Get
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
The following procedures using the Get service operation are supported:
\- Slice Selection Subscription Data Retrieval
\- Access and Mobility Subscription Data Retrieval
\- SMF Selection Subscription Data Retrieval
\- Session Management Subscription Data Retrieval
\- SMS Subscription Data Retrieval
\- SMS Management Subscription Data Retrieval
\- UE Context in SMF Data Retrieval
\- UE Context in SMSF Data Retrieval
\- Retrieval Of Multiple Data Sets
\- Identifier Translation
\- Shared Subscription Data Retrieval
\- Trace Data Retrieval
\- LCS Privacy Data Retrieval
\- Group Identifier Translation
\- LCS Mobile Originated Data Retrieval
\- Enhanced Coverage Restriction Data Retrieval
\- V2X Subscription Data Retrieval
\- LCS Broadcast Assistance Subscription Data Retrieval
\- UE Context in AMF Data Retrieval
\- ProSe Subscription Data Retrieval
\- Individual Shared Subscription Data Retrieval
\- 5MBS Subscription Data Retrieval
\- User Consent Subscription Data Retrieval
\- Multiple Identifiers Translation
\- Time Synchronization Subscription Data Retrieval
\- UE LCS Subscriber Data Retrieval
> \- Ranging and Sidelink Positioning Subscription Data Retrieval
\- A2X Subscription Data Retrieval
When the feature SharedData (see clause 6.1.8) is supported and the retrieved
UE-individual data (i.e. data other than Shared Subscription Data) contain
SharedDataIds, the NF service consumer shall also retrieve the shared data
identified by the received shared data Ids unless the identified shared data
are already available at the NF service consumer. The order of sequence of
sharedDataIds within UE-individual data is significant: Individual data take
precedence over shared data unless the feature SharedDataTreatment is
supported in which case treatment instructions may be applicable; shared data
\"SharedDataX\" identified by a sharedDataId X takes precedence over shared
data \"SharedDataY\" identified by a sharedDataId Y if X appears immediately
before Y within the list of SharedDataIds in the UE-individual data unless the
feature SharedDataTreatment is supported in which case the treatment
instructions associated to SharedDataY are applicable after treatment
instructions associated to SharedDataX have been applied.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Slice Selection Subscription Data Retrieval
Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF)
sends a request to the UDM to receive the UE\'s NSSAI (see also clause
5.15.5.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.3-1
step 3). In this example scenario the NSSAI is retrieved by the AMF, see
clause 6.1.3.2.1 for other scenarios that can retrieve the NSSAI. The request
contains the UE\'s identity (/{supi}), the type of the requested information
(/nssai) and query parameters (supported-features, plmn-id).
Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1: Requesting a UE\'s NSSAI
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) sends a GET request to the resource
representing the UE\'s subscribed NSSAI, with query parameters indicating the
supported-features and/or plmn-id.
2a. On success, the UDM responds with \"200 OK\" with the message body
containing the UE\'s NSSAI as relevant for the requesting NF service consumer.
2b. If there is no valid subscription data for the UE, HTTP status code \"404
Not Found\" shall be returned including additional error information in the
response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the GET response body.
##### 5.2.2.2.3 Access and Mobility Subscription Data Retrieval
Figure 5.2.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF)
sends a request to the UDM to receive the UE\'s Access and Mobility
Subscription data (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 step 14).
The request contains the UE\'s identity (/{supi}), the type of the requested
information (/am-data) and query parameters (supported-features, plmn-id,
shared-data-ids).
Figure 5.2.2.2.3-1: Requesting a UE\'s Access and Mobility Subscription Data
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) sends a GET request to the resource
representing the UE\'s Access and Mobility Subscription Data, with query
parameters indicating the supported-features and/or plmn-id and/or shared-
data-ids.\ The optional query parameter shared-data-ids may be included by the
NF service consumer to indicate to the UDM that shared
AccessAndMobilitySubscriptionData identified by the shared-data-ids are
already available at the NF service consumer.
2a. On Success, the UDM responds with \"200 OK\" with the message body
containing the UE\'s Access and Mobility Subscription Data as relevant for the
requesting NF service consumer. If the UE\'s Access and Mobility Subscription
Data contains the attribute sharedAmDataIDs identifying shared
AccessAndMobilitySubscriptionData, and those are not already available at the
NF consumer (i.e. the shared data IDs are not included in the shared-data-ids
query parameter in the GET request message), the UE\'s Access and Mobility
Subscription Data sent in the 200 OK message body may also contain a list of
shared Access And Mobility Subscription data relevant to the UE but not yet
available at the NF service consumer.
NOTE 1: If the UDM initiated a request to obtain SoR information from the SOR-
AF, the UDM starts an operator configurable timer up to which the UDM shall
wait for a response from the SOR-AF for retrieving the SoR information. The
UDM responds back to the NF service consumer for Access and Mobility
Subscription Data Retrieval service operation before the timer expires. If the
SOR-AF has not provided a response with the SoR information before the timer
expires, the UDM shall behave as specified in clause C.2 of 3GPPÂ°TSÂ°23.122
[20] (step 3d). As described in clause C.2 of 3GPPÂ°TSÂ°23.122 [20] (step 4), if
UDM supports SOR-CMCI, then UDM indicates in the response to NF service
consumer (i.e. AMF) to send acknowledgement that will include the \"ME support
of SOR-CMCI\". UDM will also delete the \"ME support of SOR-CMCI\" updating
AuthenticationSoR of Nudr_DataRepository service as specified in 3GPP TS
29.505 [10] clause 5.2.25, if the UE is performing initial registration or
emergency registration. UDM will decide whether to provide SOR-CMCI based on
\"usimSupportOfSorCmci\" retrieved via AuthenticationSoR of
Nudr_DataRepository service as specified in 3GPP TS 29.505 [10] clause 5.2.25.
2b. If there is no valid subscription data for the UE, HTTP status code \"404
Not Found\" shall be returned including additional error information in the
response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
NOTE 2: Upon reception of any Nudm_EventExposure operation or Nudm_PP
operation, or when the validity of an event subscription or provisioned
parameter with its associated maximum latency, maximum response time or DL
Buffering Suggested Packet Count value expires, UDM may need to adjust the
values of active time and/or periodic registration timer and/or DL Buffering
Suggested Packet Count. The UDM shall notify AMF and/or SMF if the values are
updated (see clause 4.15.3.2.3b and 4.15.6.3a of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]).
NOTE 3: If UPU data have previously been provisioned, but have not yet been
acknowledged by the UE, e.g. because no AMF was registered at provisioning
time, the UDM needs to convey the UPU data (after AUSF protection) within 200
OK AccessAndMobilitySubscriptionDatato to the AMF.
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the GET response body.
##### 5.2.2.2.4 SMF Selection Subscription Data Retrieval
Figure 5.2.2.2.4-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. AMF)
sends a request to the UDM to receive the UE\'s SMF Selection Subscription
data (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 step 14). The request
contains the UE\'s identity (/{supi}), the type of the requested information
(/smf-select-data) and query parameters (supported-features, plmn-id).
Figure 5.2.2.2.4-1: Requesting a UE\'s SMF Selection Subscription Data
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. AMF) sends a GET request to the resource

#### 5.2.2.3 Subscribe
##### 5.2.2.3.1 General
The following procedures using the Subscribe service operation are supported:
\- Subscription to notification of data change (for UE individual data)
\- Subscription to notification of shared data change
##### 5.2.2.3.2 Subscription to notifications of data change
Figure 5.2.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the UDM to subscribe to notifications of data change (see also 3GPP
TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 step 14). The request contains a callback URI
and the URI of the monitored resource.
Figure 5.2.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer subscribes to notifications
1\. The NF service consumer sends a POST request to the parent resource
(collection of subscriptions) (.../{ueId}/sdm-subscriptions), to create a
subscription as present in message body. The payload body of the POST request
shall contain a representation of the individual subscription resource to be
created.
An NF consumer supporting the \"LimitedSubscriptions\" feature shall create
only one unique subscription per UE (identified by the ueId in URI) without
additional filter criteria, or with a specific filter criteria (e.g. dnn
and/or singleNssai), and set the \"uniqueSubscription\" IE with the value
\"true\" in request body.\ For immediate reporting, the optional query
parameter shared-data-ids may be included by the NF service consumer to
indicate to the UDM that shared AccessAndMobilitySubscriptionData identified
by the shared-data-ids are already available at the NF service consumer.
If the NF consumer subscribes to notifications of data change to URIs
containing expected UE behaviours (e.g. Access and Mobility Subscription Data,
Session Management Subscription Data), the subscription may include a
threshold indicating that certain confidence and/or accuracy levels that must
be met for the parameter(s) to be notified by UDM.
2a. On success, the UDM responds with \"201 Created\" with the message body
containing a representation of the created subscription. The Location HTTP
header shall contain the URI of the created subscription.\ If the
SdmSubscription received in the POST request contains the immediateReport
indication, the SdmSubscription in the \"201 Created\" response may also
contain a report attribute with the current representation of the subscribed
data.\ In addition, if the received POST request contains the optional query
parameter shared-data-ids identifying shared data available at the NF service
consumer, and the current representation of the subscribed data contains
shared data IDs identifying shared data not yet available at the NF service
consumer, the current representation of the subscribed data sent in the \"201
Created\" response may also contain shared data that are not yet available at
the NF service consumer.
In case of partial success, \"201 Created\" should contain only the monitores
resource Uris that are supported by the UDM.
2b. If there is no valid subscription data for the UE, HTTP status code \"404
Not Found\" shall be returned including additional error information in the
response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
2c. If the UE subscription data exist, but the requested subscription to data
change notification cannot be created (e.g. due to an invalid/unsupported data
reference to be monitored, contained in the SdmSubscription parameter), HTTP
status code \"501 Not Implemented\" shall be returned including additional
error information in the response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).\ \
\"501 Not Implemented\" shall be returned only when none of the
montitoredResourceUris are supported by the UDM.
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the POST response body.
##### 5.2.2.3.3 Subscription to notifications of shared data change
Figure 5.2.2.3.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the UDM to subscribe to notifications of shared data change. The

##### 5.2.2.4.2 Unsubscribe to notifications of data change
Figure 5.2.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the UDM to unsubscribe from notifications of data changes (see also
3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 step 14). The request contains the URI
previously received in the Location HTTP header of the response to the
subscription.
Figure 5.2.2.4.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes to notifications
1\. The NF service consumer sends a DELETE request to the resource identified
by the URI previously received during subscription creation.
2a. On success, the UDM responds with \"204 No Content\".
2b. If there is no valid subscription available (e.g. due to an unknown
subscriptionId value), HTTP status code \"404 Not Found\" should be returned
including additional error information in the response body (in the
\"ProblemDetails\" element).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the DELETE response body.
##### 5.2.2.4.3 Unsubscribe to notifications of shared data change
Figure 5.2.2.4.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the UDM to unsubscribe from notifications of shared data changes.
The request contains the URI previously received in the Location HTTP header
of the response to the subscription.
Figure 5.2.2.4.3-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes to notifications for
shared data
1\. The NF service consumer sends a DELETE request to the resource identified
by the URI previously received during subscription creation.

#### 5.2.2.5 Notification
##### 5.2.2.5.1 General
The following procedures using the Notification service operation are
supported:
\- Data change notification to NF, including the updates of UE\'s Subscriber
Data indicated by the \"subscription data Type\" input and additional UE\'s
UDM-related parameters.
\- Delivery of UE Parameters Update Data to the UE via control plane procedure
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.20.
\- UDR-initiated Data Restoration Notification
##### 5.2.2.5.2 Data Change Notification To NF
Figure 5.2.2.5.2-1 shows a scenario where the UDM notifies the NF service
consumer (that has subscribed to receive such notification) about subscription
data change (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.5.1 or 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]
clause 4.5.2) or shared data change. The delivery of UE Parameters Update Data
to the UE via control plane procedure is also conveyed using this
notification, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.20.The notification
request shall be sent to the callbackReference URI as previously received in
the SdmSubscription (see clause 6.1.6.2.3).
Figure 5.2.2.5.2-1: Subscription Data Change Notification
1\. The UDM sends a POST request to the callbackReference as provided by the
NF service consumer during the subscription.
2a. On success, the NF service consumer responds with \"204 No Content\".
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the appropriate HTTP status code listed
in Table 6.1.5.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
may contain appropriate additional error information.
NOTE 1: If the NF service consumer detects that the received Data Change
Notification contains an origValue that does not match the currently stored
value, it can re-sync by using the Nudm_SDM_Get service operation.
NOTE 2: When the notification is used for the delivery of UE Parameter Update
Data to the UE, the trigger for UDM to start this procedure is out of the
scope of this specification. This can be based, e.g., on O&M commands or
provisioning orders. When a given UE parameter can be updated either in the
USIM or in the ME side of the UE (e.g., Routing Indicator, see 3GPP TS 23.502
[3] clause 4.20.1) it is assumed that the trigger for the UE parameter update
procedure includes an indication to the UDM of the target for the UE
parameters update (i.e., USIM or ME). This indication is used by the UDM to
decide which UE parameter update data set type to use and whether the UE
parameter update requires secured packet protection via SP-AF.
##### 5.2.2.5.3 UDR-initiated Data Restoration Notification
Figure 5.2.2.5.3-1 shows a scenario where the UDM notifies the NF Service
Consumer about the need to restore data (e.g., SDM subscriptions) due to a
potential data-loss event occurred at the UDR. The request contains identities
representing those UEs potentially affected by such event.
Figure 5.2.2.5.3-1: UDR-initiated Data Restoration
1\. The UDM (after receiving a notification from UDR about a potential data-
loss event) sends a POST request to the dataRestorationCallbackUri; such
callback URI may be provided by the NF service consumer during the creation of
an SDM subscription, or dynamically discovered by UDM by querying the NRF for
the NF Profile of the NF Service Consumer.
2a. On success, the NF Service Consumer responds with \"204 No Content\".
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the appropriate HTTP status codes listed
in Table 6.1.5.3-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
may contain appropriate additional error information.
#### 5.2.2.6 Info
##### 5.2.2.6.1 General

NWDAF) to register at the UDM by means of the Registration service operation.
It is also used by the registered Consumer NFs (AMF) to get notified by means
of the DeregistrationNotification service operation when UDM decides to
deregister the registered consumer NF.
It is also used by the registered Consumer NFs (AMF, SMF, SMSF, NWDAF) to
deregister from the UDM by means of the Deregistration service operation.
It is also used by consumer NFs (NEF, NWDAF, NSSAAF, DCCF, SMF) to retrieve
registration information from the UDM by means of the Get service operation.
It is also used by the registered Consumer NFs (AMF, SMF, NWDAF) to update
registration information stored at the UDM by means of the Update service
operation.
It is also used by the registered Consumer NFs (AMF, SMF) to get notified by
means of the P-CSCF-RestorationNotification service operation when UDM detects
the need for P-CSCF restoration.
It is also used by the consumer NF (HSS) to trigger P-CSCF restoration by
means of the P-CSCF-RestorationTrigger service operation.
It is also used by the consumer NF (HSS) to trigger deregistration of the
registered AMF for 3GPP access by means of the AMFDeregistration service
operation

UDR, by means of the PEI-Update service operation.
It is also used by the consumer NF (HSS) to update the stored Roaming
Information in e.g. the UDR, by means of the Roaming-Info-Update service
operation.
It is also used by consumer NFs to retrieve NWDAF registration information
from the UDM by means of the Get service operation.
It is also used by consumer NFs to retrieve addressing information for MT SMS
delivery, e.g. addressing of the IP-SM-GW, SMS Router or SMSF serving nodes in
both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, by means of the SendRoutingInfoForSM service
operation.
It is also used by the registered Consumer NFs (AMF) to get notified by means
of the ReauthNotification service operation when UDM detects the need for UE
primary reauthentication.
It is also used by the consumer NF (e.g. AAnF) to request UDM to trigger a
primary (re-)authentication by means of the AuthTrigger service operation.
#### 5.3.2.2 Registration
##### 5.3.2.2.1 General
The Registration service operation is invoked by a NF that has been selected
to provide service to the UE to store related UE Context Management
information in UDM.
NF Consumers are AMF for access and mobility management service, SMF for
session management services, SMSF providing SMS services and HSS for IP-SM-GW
registration in SMSoIP scenarios.
As part of this registration procedure, the UDM authorizes or rejects the
subscriber to use the service provided by the registered NF, based on
subscription data (e.g. roaming restrictions).
The following procedures using the Registration service operation are
supported:
\- AMF registration for 3GPP access
\- AMF registration for non-3GPP access
\- SMF registration
\- SMSF registration for 3GPP access
\- SMSF registration for non-3GPP access
\- IP-SM-GW registration
\- NWDAF registration
##### 5.3.2.2.2 AMF registration for 3GPP access
Figure 5.3.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the AMF sends a request to the UDM
to update the AMF registration information for 3GPP access (see also 3GPP TS
23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 step 14). The request contains the UE\'s
identity (/{ueId}) which shall be a SUPI and the AMF Registration Information
for 3GPP access.
Figure 5.3.2.2.2-1: AMF registering for 3GPP access
1\. The AMF sends a PUT request to the resource representing the UE\'s AMF
registration for 3GPP access to update or create AMF registration information.
If EPS interworking with N26 is supported, and the AMF has per DNN selected
the PGW-C+SMF for EPS interworking, the AMF shall include the info of selected
PGW-C+SMF to the UDM.\ \ The AMF shall include ueReachableInd IE if the UE is
currently not reachable (e.g. in not allowed areas) or the UE reachability is
unknown (e.g. service restriction area of the UE is not received at the AMF
during initial registration).
The AMF shall include the \"backupAmfInfo\" IE containing all of the GUAMI
served by the AMF and the related backup AMF name if the AMF supports the AMF
management without UDSF as specified in clause 6.5.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
The \"backupAmfInfo\" IE is only applicable to this UE in 3GPP access.
2a. On success, the UDM updates the Amf3GppAccessRegistration resource by
replacing it with the received resource information, and responds with \"200
OK\" or \"204 No Content\".
UDM shall invoke the Deregistration Notification service operation towards the
old AMF using the callback URI provided by the old AMF.
When AMF indicates there are no ongoing event subscriptions (e.g. during UE
initial registration), but UDM has ongoing event exposure subscriptions stored
(e.g. in UDR), UDM shall invoke one Namf_EventExposure Subscribe Service
operations (see clause 5.3.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [36]) on behalf of NEF per
subscription stored. When the AMF identified that event synchronization is
needed but AMF and/or UDM are not supporting event synchronization (see clause
5.3.2.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [36]), the AMF may also ask the UDM to re-
subscribe the stored events by indicating there is no ongoing event
subscpritons in the UECM operation.
If ueReachableInd IE is received indicating that the UE is not reachable, the
UDM shall not trigger Reachability Report for the UE upon this UECM
registration. The AMF shall subsequently generate UE Reachability Report when
it detects the UE is reachable. If the If ueReachableInd IE is received
indicating that the UE reachability is unknown, the UDM may trigger
Reachability Report for the UE when needed based on operator policy.
2b. If the resource does not exist (there is no previous AMF information
stored in UDM for that user), UDM stores the received AMF registration data
for 3GPP access and responds with HTTP Status Code \"201 created\". A response
body may be included to convey additional information to the NF consumer
(e.g., features supported by UDM).
2c. If the operation cannot be authorized due to e.g UE does not have required
subcription data, the AMF does not support CAG feature and the UE is allowed
to access 5GS via CAG cell(s) only, access barring, roaming restrictions, core
network restriction, or if an UE performs registration in an SNPN using
credentials from the Credentials Holder, but it is not authorized to access
the SNPN, HTTP status code \"403 Forbidden\" should be returned including
additional error information in the response body (in \"ProblemDetails\"
element).
NOTE: Clause 5.4.2.2 in 3GPP TS 29.505 [10] explains how an UDM determines if
the UE, which performs registration in an SNPN using credentials from a
Credentials Holder is authorized to access the specific SNPN.
2d. On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the PUT response body.
##### 5.3.2.2.3 AMF registration for non 3GPP access

to update the AMF registration information for non 3GPP access (see also 3GPP
TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 step 14). The request contains the UE\'s
identity (/{ueId}) which shall be a SUPI and the AMF Registration Information
for non 3GPP access.
Figure 5.3.2.2.3-1: AMF registering for non 3GPP access
1\. The AMF sends a PUT request to the resource representing the UE\'s AMF
registration for non 3GPP access to update or create AMF registration
information.
The AMF shall include the \"backupAmfInfo\" IE containing all of the GUAMI
served by the AMF and the related backup AMF name if the AMF supports the AMF
management without UDSF as specified in clause 6.5.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
The \"backupAmfInfo\" IE is only applicable to this UE in non 3GPP access.
2a. On success, the UDM updates the AmfNon3GppAccessRegistration resource by
replacing it with the received resource information, and responds with \"200
OK\" or \"204 No Content\".
UDM shall invoke the Deregistration Notification service operation towards the
old AMF using the callback URI provided by the old AMF.
When AMF indicates there are no ongoing event subscriptions (e.g. during UE
initial registration), but UDM has ongoing event exposure subscriptions stored
(e.g. in UDR), UDM shall invoke one Namf_EventExposure Subscribe Service
operations (see clause 5.3.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [36]) on behalf of NEF per
subscription stored. When the AMF identified that event synchronization is
needed but AMF and/or UDM are not supporting event synchronization (see clause
5.3.2.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [36]), the AMF may also ask the UDM to re-
subscribe the stored events by indicating there is no ongoing event
subscpritons in the UECM operation.
2b. If the resource does not exist (there is no previous AMF information
stored in UDM for that user), UDM stores the received AMF registration data
for non-3GPP access and responds with HTTP Status Code \"201 created\". A
response body may be included to convey additional information to the NF
consumer (e.g., features supported by UDM).
2c. If the operation cannot be authorized due to e.g UE does not have required
subcription data, the AMF does not support CAG feature and the UE is allowed
to access 5GS via CAG cell(s) only, access barring, roaming restrictions or
core network restriction, HTTP status code \"403 Forbidden\" should be
returned including additional error information in the response body (in the
\"ProblemDetails\" element).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the PUT response body.
##### 5.3.2.2.4 SMF registration
Figure 5.3.2.2.4-1 shows a scenario where an SMF sends a request to the UDM to
create a new registration (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.3.2.2.1 step
16c and clause 4.26.5.3 step 11). The request contains the UE\'s identity
(/{ueId}) which shall be a SUPI and the SMF Registration Information.

representation of the created SMF registration.
2b. If the individual resource exists, on success, the UDM updates the
resource by replacing it with the received resource information, and responds
with \"200 OK\" with the message body containing a representation of the
updated Individual SmfRegistration resource.
If the new SMF is not in a SMF set or is not in the same SMF Set as the old
SMF, the UDM shall invoke the Deregistration Notification service operation
towards the old SMF using the callback URI provided by the old SMF.
2c. If the operation cannot be authorized due to e.g UE does not have required
subscription data, access barring or roaming restrictions, HTTP status code
\"403 Forbidden\" should be returned including additional error information in
the response body (in \"ProblemDetails\" element). Subscription information
associated to a specific DNN (if any) shall take precedence over subscription
information associated to the Wildcard DNN.

#### 5.3.2.3 DeregistrationNotification
##### 5.3.2.3.1 General
The following procedure using the DeregistrationNotification service operation
is supported:
\- UDM initiated NF Deregistration
##### 5.3.2.3.2 UDM initiated NF Deregistration
Figure 5.3.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the UDM notifies the registered NF
about its deregistration (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.2.2-1 step
14, 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.2.2.3.3-1 step 1 and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure
4.26.4.1.1-1 step 14). The request contains the deregCallbackUri URI for
deregistration notification as received by the UDM during registration, and
Deregistration Data.
The UDM initiates the deregistration procedure when the UE is registered to
the AMF which does not support CAG feature and the CAG subscription of the UE
changes and it is allowed to access the 5GS via CAG cell(s) only.
The UDM also initiates deregistration notification when UE moves to different
AMF within same AMF-Set.
The UDM may also initiate deregistration notification for the disaster inbound
roaming UE when a disaster condition is no longer being applicable.
Deregistration notification shall not be sent if the nfInstanceId of the AMF
initiating registration is same as the old AMF already registered in UDM (e.g.
when multiple PLMNs are hosted on same AMF and UE moves across PLMNs).
The UDM also initiates the deregistration procedures towards the SMF of the
old PDU session when a new PDU session has been established with the same PDU
session ID from a different SMF, during SM Context Transfer procedure (see
clause 4.26.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]) or when duplicated PDU sessions
existing in the network (e.g. the AMF failed to release the old PDU session
before creation of the new PDU session with the same PDU session ID).
Figure 5.3.2.3.2-1: UDM initiated NF Deregistration
1\. The UDM sends a POST request to the deregCallbackUri as provided by the NF
service consumer during the registration.
If the SMF deregistration is triggered by SM Context Transfer procedure, i.e.
the UDM has received a registration request with registrationReason IE set to
the value \"SMF_CONTEXT_TRANSFERRED\" from another SMF, the UDM shall set the
deregReason IE to the value \"SMF_CONTEXT_TRANSFERRED\". If the SMF
deregistration is due to duplicated PDU sessions in the network, i.e. the UDM
has received a registration request from another SMF without
registrationReason IE set to the value \"SMF_CONTEXT_TRANSFERRED\", the UDM
shall set the deregReason IE to the value \"DUPLICATE_PDU_SESSION\".
If the SMF deregistration is due to an UDM-triggered PDU session release with
re-activation, the UDM shall set the deregReason attribute in
DeregistrationData to the value \"PDU_SESSION_REACTIVATION_REQUIRED\"; in this
case, the SMF shall trigger a network-initiated PDU session release procedure
(see clause 4.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]) with 5GSM cause \"Reactivation
requested\" (see clause 8.3.14 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [27])
2a. On success, the NF service consumer responds with \"204 No Content\".
An SMF received the deregistration notification shall release the PDU session
but shall not send a SM Context Status Notification to the AMF. For a PDU
session with I-SMF or V-SMF, the anchor SMF shall send a Status Notification
to the I-SMF or V-SMF indicating that the PDU session is released due to
duplicated PDU sessions.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the appropriate HTTP status code listed
in Table 6.2.5.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
may contain appropriate additional error information.
#### 5.3.2.4 Deregistration
##### 5.3.2.4.1 General
The following procedures using the Deregistration service operation are
supported:
\- AMF deregistration for 3GPP access

##### 5.3.2.4.2 AMF deregistration for 3GPP access
Figure 5.3.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the AMF sends a request to the UDM
to deregister (purge) from the UDM for 3GPP access (see also 3GPP TS 23.502
[3] figure 4.5.3.1-1 step 3). The request contains the UE\'s identity
(/{ueId}) which shall be a SUPI and an instruction to set the purgeFlag within
the Amf3GppAccessRegistration resource.
Figure 5.3.2.4.2-1: AMF deregistering for 3GPP access
1\. The AMF sends a PATCH request to the resource representing the UE\'s AMF
registration for 3GPP access.
2a. The UDM shall check whether the received GUAMI matches the stored GUAMI.
If so, the UDM shall set the PurgeFlag. The UDM responds with \"204 No
Content\".
2b. Otherwise the UDM responds with \"403 Forbidden\".
NOTE: Based on operator policy, when AMF receives 403 Forbidden, the AMF can
avoid freezing the 5G-TMSI that the UE used, under consideration that the UE
has been assigned another 5G-TMSI by another AMF.
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the PATCH response body.
##### 5.3.2.4.3 AMF deregistration for non-3GPP access
Figure 5.3.2.4.3-1 shows a scenario where the AMF sends a request to the UDM
to deregister (purge) from the UDM for non-3GPP access (see also 3GPP TS
23.502 [3] figure 4.5.3.1-1 step 3). The request contains the UE\'s identity
(/{ueId}) which shall be a SUPI and an instruction to set the purgeFlag within
the AmfNon3GppAccessRegistration resource.

If so, the UDM shall set the PurgeFlag. The UDM responds with \"204 No
Content\".
2b. Otherwise the UDM responds with \"403 Forbidden\".
NOTE: Based on operator policy, when AMF receives 403 Forbidden, the AMF can
avoid freezing the 5G-TMSI that the UE used, under consideration that the UE
has been assigned another 5G-TMSI by another AMF.
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in

##### 5.3.2.4.4 SMF deregistration
Figure 5.3.2.4.4-1 shows a scenario where the SMF sends a request to the UDM
to deregister an individual SMF registration (see also 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]
figure 4.3.2.2-1 step 20). The request contains the UE\'s identity (/{ueId})
which shall be a SUPI and the PDU Session ID (/{pduSessionId}.
Figure 5.3.2.4.4-1: SMF deregistration
1\. The SMF sends a DELETE request to the resource representing the individual
SMF registration that is to be deregistered.
When the SMF deregisters the last PDU session for a UE on the UDM, the SMF
should include an indication to inform the UDM if all SMF event subscriptions
for the UE previously created on the SMF have been implicitly unsubscribed.
2\. The UDM responds with \"204 No Content\". If the SMF had requested the SDM
Subscription to be created with the \"implicitUnsubscribe\" flag set, then UDM
will terminate the SDM Subscription when the last PDU Session for that SUPI
and SMF is deregistered.
If the UDM has received the indication that the SMF event subscriptions have
been implicitly unsubscribed in the request, the UDM should not send requests
to unsubscribe the SMF event subscriptions on the SMF for the UE.
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the DELETE response body.
##### 5.3.2.4.5 SMSF Deregistration for 3GPP Access
Figure 5.3.2.4.5-1 shows a scenario where the SMSF sends a request to the UDM
to delete the SMSF registration information for 3GPP access (see also 3GPP TS
23.502 [3], clause 4.13.3.2). The request contains the UE\'s identity
(/{ueId}) which shall be a SUPI.
For a UE previously requests SMS service from both 3GPP access and Non-3GPP
access, if SMS service is disabled from one access type, the SMSF shall only
delete the corresponding SMSF registration for that access type. If SMS
service is disabled from both 3GPP access and Non-3GPP access, the SMSF shall
delete the SMSF registration for both access types.

## 5.4 Nudm_UEAuthentication Service
### 5.4.1 Service Description
See 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] table 7.2.5-1.
### 5.4.2 Service Operations
#### 5.4.2.1 Introduction
For the Nudm_UEAuthentication service the following service operations are
defined:
\- Get
\- GetHssAv
\- ResultConfirmation
\- GetProseAv
\- GetGbaAv
\- Notification
The Nudm_UEAuthentication service is used by the AUSF to request the UDM to
select an authentication method, calculate a fresh authentication vector (AV)
if required for the selected method, and provide it to the AUSF by means of
the Get service operation. See 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] clause 14.2.2 and 3GPP TS
33.535 [55] clause 6.1. The service may also be used by the AUSF to indicate
to the UDM that the user is using a N5GC device behind Cable RGs in private
networks or in isolated deployment scenarios with wireline access and that
therefore the applicable authentication method shall be EAP based. See 3GPP TS
23.316 [37] clause 4.10a.
The Nudm_UEAuthentication service is also used by the HSS to request UDM to
generate the authentication vector(s) for EPS or IMS domain by means of
GetHssAv service operation. See 3GPP TS 23.632 [32] clause 5.6.3.
The Nudm_UEAuthentication service is also used by the AUSF to inform the UDM
about the occurrence of a successful or unsuccessful authentication by means
of the ResultConfirmation service operation. See3GPP TS 33.501 [6] clause
14.2.3.
The Nudm_UEAuthentication service is also used by the AUSF to request the UDM
to authenticate the FN-RG accessing to 5GC via W-AGF. See 3GPP TS 23.316 [37]
clause 7.2.1.3.
The Nudm_UEAuthentication service is also used by the NF service consumer to
request the UDM to remove the UE authentication result during the Purge of
subscriber data in AMF after the UE deregisters from the network or NAS SMC
fails following the successful authentication in the registration procedure.
The Nudm_UEAuthentication service is also used by the AUSF to request UDM to
retrieve the Authentication Vectors for 5G ProSe by means of GetProseAv
service operation. See 3GPP TS 33.503 [64] clause 7.4.
The Nudm_UEAuthentication service is also used by the GBA\'s BSF to request
UDM to generate the GBA authentication vector by means of GetGbaAv service
operation. See 3GPP TS 33.220 [61] clause N.2.2.
#### 5.4.2.2 Get
##### 5.4.2.2.1 General
The following procedure using the Get service operation is supported:
\- Authentication Information Retrieval
\- FN-RG Authentication
As part of this Authentication Information Retrieval operation, the UDM
authorizes or rejects the subscriber to use the service provided by the
registered NF, based on subscription data (e.g. roaming restrictions).
As part of this FN-RG Authentication operation, the UDM decides, based on the
stored authentication profile of the SUPI and the authenticated indication
that authentication has been completed by the W-AGF, that authentication by
the home network is not required for the FN-RG.
##### 5.4.2.2.2 Authentication Information Retrieval
Figure 5.4.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (AUSF)
retrieves authentication information for the UE from the UDM (see also 3GPP TS
33.501 [6] clause 6.1.2). The request contains the UE\'s identity (supi or
suci), the serving network name, and may contain resynchronization info.
Figure 5.4.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer requesting authentication information
1\. The NF service consumer sends a POST request (custom method: generate-
auth-data) to the resource representing the UE\'s security information.
2a. The UDM responds with \"200 OK\" with the message body containing the
authentication data information.
The AUSF shall store the authentication data information for subsequent
authentication processing. If the AUSF is configured to store Kausf (e.g.
based on its support of SoRProtection / UPUProtection service operations /
deriving AKMA key after primary authentication), the AUSF shall preserve the
Kausf and related information (e.g. SUPI) after the completion of the primary
authentication. If the UDM decides that the primary authentication by an AAA
server in a Credentials Holder is required, the AUSF shall perform the
authentication with the AAA Server. In case the UDM receives an anonymous SUCI
that contains the realm part, the UDM authorizes the UE based on realm part of
SUCI, and send anonymous SUPI and the indicator to indicate to the AUSF to run
primary authentication with an external Credentials holder (see 3GPP TS 33.501
[6], clause I.2.2). If the Default Credentials Server (DCS) provides UDM with
the information of a Provisioning Server (PVS FQDN(s) and/or IP address(es)),
the UDM provides the PVS info to the AUSF.
2b. If the operation cannot be authorized due to e.g UE does not have required
subcription data, none of the CAG IDs in the CAG cell match any of the
subscribed and UE-acknowledged CAG IDs in the allowed CAG list, access barring
or roaming restrictions, UDM receives an anonymous SUCI that does not contain
the realm part, HTTP status code \"403 Forbidden\" should be returned
including additional error information in the response body (in
\"ProblemDetails\" element). If the cellCagInfo is not received, the UDM shall
not assume the UE is accessing from the PLMN and shall not stop the
authenthcation if the UE is allowed to access 5GS via CAG cell(s) only.
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the POST response body.
##### 5.4.2.2.3 FN-RG Authentication
Figure 5.4.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (AUSF)
requests the UDM to authenticate the FN-RG accessing to 5GC via W-AGF. (see

## 5.5 Nudm_EventExposure Service
### 5.5.1 Service Description
See 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] table 7.2.5-1.
### 5.5.2 Service Operations
#### 5.5.2.1 Introduction
For the Nudm_EventExposure service the following service operations are
defined:
\- Subscribe
\- Unsubscribe
\- Notify
\- ModifySubscription
The Nudm_EventExposure service is used by consumer NFs (e.g. NEF) to subscribe
to notifications of event occurrence by means of the Subscribe service
operation. For events that can be detected by the AMF, the UDM makes use of
the appropriate AMF service operation to subscribe on behalf of the consumer
NF (e.g. NEF).
The Nudm_EventExposure service is also used by the consumer NFs (e.g. NEF)
that have previously subscribed to notificatios, to unsubscribe by means of
the Unsubscribe service operation. For events that can be detected by the AMF,
the UDM makes use of the appropriate AMF service operation to unsubscribe on
behalf of the consumer NF (e.g. NEF).
The Nudm_EventExposure service is also used by the subscribed consumer NFs
(e.g. NEF) to get notified by the UDM when a subscribed event occurs at the
UDM by means of the Notify service operation. For subscribed events that can
occur at the AMF, the consumer NF (e.g. NEF) makes use of the corresponding
AMF service operation to get notified by the AMF directly without UDM
involvement.
The Nudm_EventExposure service is also used by the subscribed consumer NFs
(e.g. NEF) to modify an existing subscription by means of the
ModifySubscription service operation.
For details see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.15.
#### 5.5.2.2 Subscribe
##### 5.5.2.2.1 General
The following procedures using the Subscribe service operation are supported:
\- Subscribe to Notification of event occurrence
##### 5.5.2.2.2 Subscription to Notification of event occurrence
Figure 5.5.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the UDM to subscribe to notifications of event occurrence (see also
3GPP TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.15.3.2.2-1 step 1 and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] Figure
4.15.3.2.3b-1 step 1). The request contains a callback URI, the type of event
that is monitored and additional information e.g. event filters and reporting
options.
Figure 5.5.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer subscribes to notifications
1\. The NF service consumer sends a POST request to the parent resource
(collection of subscriptions) (.../{ueIdentity}/ee-subscriptions), to create a
subscription as present in message body. The values ueIdentity shall take are
specified in Table 6.4.3.2.2-1. The request may contain an expiry time,
suggested by the NF Service Consumer, representing the time upto which the
subscription is desired to be kept active and the time after which the
subscribed event(s) shall stop generating notifications, the indication on
whether the subscription applies also to EPC.\ \ If MTC Provider information
and/or AF ID are received in the request, the UDM shall check whether the MTC
Provider and/or the AF is allowed to perform this operation for the UE or for
the group of UEs or Any UE which is indicated in the Resource URI variable
ueIdentity; otherwise, the UDM shall skip the MTC provider and/or AF
authorization check.
2a. On success, the UDM responds with \"201 Created\" with the message body
containing a representation of the created subscription. The Location HTTP
header shall contain the URI of the created subscription.
If the event subscription was for a group of UEs:
\- The \"maxNumOfReports\" in the \"reportingOptions\" IE shall be applicable
to each UE in the group;
\- The UDM shall return the number of UEs in that group in the \"numberOfUes\"
IE.
The NF service consumer shall keep track of the maximum number of reports
reported for each UE in the event report and when
\"maxNumOfReports*numberOfUes\" limit is reached, the NF service consumer
shall initiate the unsubscription of the notification towards the UDM (see
clause 5.5.2.3.2).
If the event subscription was for a list events, the \"reportingOptions\"
attribute (containing, e.g., \"reportMode\", \"maxNumOfReports\",...) shall be
applicable to each event in the list. The NF service consumer shall keep track
of the maximum number of reports reported for each event in the event report
and when \"maxNumOfReports*number of events\" limit is reached, the NF service
consumer shall initiate the unsubscription of the notification towards the UDM
(see clause 5.5.2.3.2). If the \"reportMode\" included in \"reportingOptions\"
is not applicable (see clause 6.4.6.3.7) to all events in the list, the
request shall be rejected with error \"400 Bad Request\", and with
ProblemDetails containing application error set to cause value
\"OPTIONAL_IE_INCORRECT\".
The response, based on operator policy, may contain the expiry time, as
determined by the UDM, after which the subscription becomes invalid. Before
the subscription is going to expire, if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep
receiving notifications, it shall modify the subscription in the UDM with a
new expiry time. The NF Service Producer shall not provide the same expiry
time for many subscriptions in order to avoid all of them expiring and
recreating the subscription at the same time. If the expiry time is not
included in the response, the NF Service Consumer shall not associate an
expiry time for the subscription.
If the indication on whether the subscription applies also to EPC is included
and set to true in the request, the response shall include the indication on
whether the subscription was also successful in EPC domain. If the
subscription also applies to the EPC domain, the only the Event Types below
shall apply to the EPC domain,
\- The event type \"LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY\", it shall be map to event type
\"LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY\" on Nhss
\- The event type \"UE_REACHABILITY_FOR_DATA\" and the reportCfg in
reachabilityForDataCfg set to \"DIRECT_REPORT\", it shall be mapped to event
type \"UE_REACHABILITY_FOR_DATA\" on Nhss
\- The event type \"LOCATION_REPORTING\", and dddTrafficDes or Dnn is not
included in the request, it shall be mapped to event type
\"LOCATION_REPORTING\" on Nhss
\- The event type \"COMMUNICATION_FAILURE\", it shall be mapped to event type
\"COMMUNICATION_FAILURE\" on Nhss
\- The event type \"AVAILABILITY_AFTER_DDN_FAILURE\", it shall be mapped to
event type \"AVAILABILITY_AFTER_DDN_FAILURE\" on Nhss
\- The event type \"PDN_CONNECTIVITY_STATUS\", it shall be mapped to event
type \"PDN_CONNECTIVITY_STATUS\" on Nhss
\- The event type \"UE_REACHABILITY_FOR_SMS\" and reachabilityForSmsCfg set to
\"REACHABILITY_FOR_SMS_OVER_NAS\", it shall be mapped to event type
\"UE_REACHABILITY_FOR_SMS\" on Nhss
\- The event type \"UE_MEMORY_AVAILABLE_FOR_SMS\", it shall be mapped to event
type \" UE_MEMORY_AVAILABLE_FOR_SMS \" on Nhss
If some of the requested monitoring configurations fails, the response may
include the failedMonitoringConfigs to indicate the failed cause of the failed
monitoring configurations.
If some of the requested monitoring configurations fails in the EPC domain or
the EE subscription fails in the EPC domain, the response may include the
failedMoniConfigsEPC to indicate the failed cause of the failed monitoring
configurations or the failed cause of the EE subscription in the EPC domain.
If the NF Service Consumer has included the immediateFlag with value as
\"true\" in the event subscription for an individual UE and the event
requested for immediate reporting is reported by the UDM (e.g.
\"CHANGE_OF_SUPI_PEI_ASSOCIATION\" or \"ROAMING_STATUS\"), the UDM may include
the current status of the event if available in the response.
If the NF Service Consumer has included the immediateFlag with value as
\"true\" in the event subscription for an individual UE and the event
requested for immediate reporting is reported by the AMF (e.g.
LOCATION_REPORT) and the NF service consumer has indicated supporting of
\"IERSR\" feature (see clause 6.4.8), the UDM shall indicate the support of
\"IERSR\" feature when subscribing to the event on the AMF (see clause 6.2.8
of 3GPP TS 29.518 [36]). UDM shall include the current status of the event if
received from the AMF in subscription creation response.
If the NF Service Consumer has included the immediateFlag with value as
\"true\" in the event subscription for an individual UE, the indication on
whether the subscription applies also to EPC is included and set to \"true\"
in the request and the NF service consumer has indicated supporting of
\"IERSR\" feature (see clause 6.4.8), the UDM shall indicate the support of
\"ERIR\" feature when subscribing to the event on the HSS (see clause 6.4.8 of
3GPP TS 29.563 [62]). UDM shall include the current status of the event in EPC
if received from the HSS in subscription creation response.
NOTE: IERSR feature is not applicable to events detected by the SMF.
If the UDM supports the EneNA feature (see clause 6.2.8), the event is
detected by a remote NF (e.g. AMF) and directly notified to the NF consumer
(e.g. NWDAF) and the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included in the request, the
UDM shall forward the \"notifFlag\" attribute to the remote NF (e.g. AMF).
Additionally, if the UDM also supports the ENAPH3 feature (see clause 6.2.8)
and the NF service consumer also included event muting instructions in the
request, the UDM shall also forward the event muting instructions to the
remote NF, if the subscription creation request is accepted by the remote NF,
the UDM may also forward the following information to the NF service consumer
in the response if it is received:
\- the maximum number of notifications that the remote NF expects to be able
to store for the subscription;
\- an estimate of the duration for which notifications can be buffered.
2b. If the user does not exist, HTTP status code \"404 Not Found\" shall be
returned including additional error information in the response body (in the
\"ProblemDetails\" element).
2c. If there is no valid subscription data for the UE, i.e. based on the UE\'s
subscription information monitoring of the requested EventType is not allowed,
or the requested EventType is not supported, or when MTC Provider or AF are
not allowed to perform this operation for the UE, HTTP status code \"403
Forbidden\" shall be returned including additional error information in the
response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
If the UDM supports the EneNA and ENAPH3 features (see clause 6.2.8), the NF
service consumer sets the \"notifFlag\" attribute to \"DEACTIVATE\" and event
muting instructions in the request, but the remote NF cannot accept the
received instructions and reject the request with a 403 Forbidden response and
the application error \"MUTING_EXC_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\", the UDM shall forward
the error response to the NF service consumer.
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the POST response body.

## 5.6 Nudm_ParameterProvision Service
### 5.6.1 Service Description
See 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] table 7.2.5-1.
### 5.6.2 Service Operations
#### 5.6.2.1 Introduction
For the Nudm_ParameterProvision service the following service operations are
defined:
\- Update
\- Create
\- Delete
\- Get
The Nudm_ParameterProvision service is used by consumer NFs (e.g. NEF) to
update a UE\'s or a group of UEs\' subscription data by means of the Update
service operation.
For details see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.15.6.2.
The Nudm_ParameterProvision service can also be used by a NF Service Consumer
(e.g. SOR-AF) to send updated Steering of Roaming Information for a UE to the
UDM at any time, as specified in Annex C.3 of 3GPPÂ°TSÂ°23.122Â°[20].
#### 5.6.2.2 Update
##### 5.6.2.2.1 General
The following procedures using the Update service operation are supported:
\- Subscription data update
\- SoR Information update
\- 5G VN Group modification
\- Parameter Provisioning Data Entry per AF update
\- 5G-MBS-Group modification
##### 5.6.2.2.2 Subscription data update
Figure 5.6.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. NEF,
AMF) sends a request to the UDM to update a UE\'s subscription data (see 3GPP
TS 23.502 [3] figure 4.15.6.2-1 step 2 and also 3GPP TS 23.273 [38] Figure
6.12.1-1 step 2). The request contains the identifier of the UE\'s parameter
provision data ( .../{ueId}/pp-data) and the modification instructions. The
values ueId shall take are specified in Table 6.5.3.2.2-1.
Figure 5.6.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer updates subscription data
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. NEF, AMF) sends a PATCH request to the
resource that represents a UE\'s modifiable subscription data.\ \ If MTC
Provider information and/or AF ID are received in the request, the UDM shall
check whether the MTC Provider and/or the AF is allowed to perform this
operation for the UE; otherwise, the UDM shall skip the MTC provider and/or AF
authorization check.
2a. The UDM responds with \"204 No Content\".
2b. Upon partial success, UDM responds with \"200 OK\".
If the request includes the \"Expected UE Behaviour Data\" parameters, then,
based on local configuration, the UDM may determine if there are any
requirements in the UDM with respect to threshold conditions that need to be
met by the received parameter before the UDM stores the parameter in, e.g. the
UDR. If the threshold criteria is satisfied, the UDM may continue to process
the request. If the threshold criteria is not satisfied, UDM may return
partial success with a related cause value e.g. \"confidence level not
sufficient\" or \"accuracy level not sufficient\".
2c. If MTC Provider or AF are not allowed to perform this operation for the
UE, HTTP status code \"403 Forbidden\" shall be returned including additional
error information in the response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
NOTE: Upon reception of an update or removal of maximum latency, maximum
response time or DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count, UDM may need to adjust
the value of active time and/or periodic registration timer and/or DL
Buffering Suggested Packet Count and the UDM shall notify AMF and/or SMF if
the values are updated (see clause 4.15.6.3a of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the PATCH response body.
##### 5.6.2.2.3 5G VN Group modification
Figure 5.6.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the UDM to modify an external group id\'s group data. The request
contains the external group identifier of the group and the modification
instructions.
Figure 5.6.2.2.3-1: NF service consumer modifies a 5G VN Group
1\. The NF service consumer sends a PATCH request to the resource that
represents a 5G VN Group.\ \ If MTC Provider information and/or AF ID are
received in the request, the UDM shall check whether the MTC Provider and/or
the AF is allowed to perform this operation for the UE; otherwise, the UDM
shall skip the MTC provider and/or AF authorization check.
2a. On success, the UDM responds with \"204 No Content\".
2b. If the external group id does not exist in the UDM, HTTP status code \"404
Not Found\" shall be returned including additional error information in the
response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).
2c. If MTC Provider or AF are not allowed to perform this operation for the
UE, HTTP status code \"403 Forbidden\" shall be returned including additional
error information in the response body (in the \"ProblemDetails\" element).

returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the PATCH response body.
##### 5.6.2.2.4 SoR Information update
Figure 5.6.2.2.4-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. SOR-
AF) sends updated SoR Information for a UE to the UDM to trigger the sending
of this updated SoR Information to the UE via the AMF (as per Annex C.3 of
3GPP TS 23.122 [20]). The request contains the identifier of the UE\'s
parameter provision data ( .../{ueId}/pp-data), the SUPI in this case, and the
modification instructions.
Figure 5.6.2.2.4-1: NF service consumer updates SoR Information for a UE
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. SOR-AF) sends a PATCH request to the
resource that represents a UE\'s modifiable subscription data, containing
updated Steering of Roaming Information (i.e. new list of preferred
PLMN/access technology combinations, the SOR-CMCI, SOR-SNPN-SI-LS, if any, and
the \"Store the SOR-CMCI in the ME\" indicator, if any, or a secured packet
for a UE).
The UDM, after contacting the AUSF to perform integrity protection and getting
the related information (sorMacIausf and coutersor), shall immediately convey
this updated SoR Information to the concerned UE by triggering a notification
to the registered AMF (that has subscribed to receive notifications on change
of AccessAndMobilitySubscriptionData) for the UE, if any, as per annex C.3 of
3GPP TS 23.122 [20]. Once the subscribing AMF is notified (or when no AMF has
subscribed), the UDM shall delete the updated SorInfo and shall not send it as
part of AccessAndMobilitySubscriptionData to an NF (e.g. AMF) retrieving the
AccessAndMobilitySubscriptionData.
2a. The UDM responds with \"204 No Content\".
2b. If the operation cannot be authorized due to e.g UE isn\'t registered in
the network, HTTP status code \"403 Forbidden\" should be returned including
additional error information in the response body (in \"ProblemDetails\"
element).

#### 6.1.3.2 Resource: Nssai (Document)
##### 6.1.3.2.1 Description
This resource represents the subscribed Nssai for a SUPI. It is queried by the
AMF before registering, and is used to assist network slice selection. See
5.2.2.2.2 and 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.15.3.
This resource is also queried by the PGW-C+SMF during PDN connection
establishment in the EPC, and is used to select the S-NSSAI provided to the
UE, see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.11.0a.5. The PGW-C+SMF shall not indicate
support to \"Nssaa\" feature (see clause 6.1.8) in this query to UDM. If a
slice is not present in the Nssai resource returned by UDM, i.e. not
subscribed by the UE or subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization, the slice shall not be selected by the PGW-C+SMF.

#### 6.1.3.8 Resource: SessionManagementSubscriptionData (Document)
##### 6.1.3.8.1 Description
This resource represents the Session Management subscription data for a SUPI.
It is queried by the SMF during session setup, using query parameters
representing the selected network slice and the DNN. The SMF is responsible
for enforcing the user session management subscription data.
UDM will only recognize subscribed DNNs in this resource so for instance, in
case SMF receives indication from AMF that the DNN was authorized based on the
wildcard APN in the Selection Mode Value, SMF shall include the wildcard DNN
in the query parameter and SMF will receive SessionManagementSubscriptionData
for the Wildcard DNN. Any request for non-subscribed DNN will be rejected with
\"404 Not Found\".
This resource is also queried by the PGW-C+SMF during PDN connection
establishment in the EPC, to select the S-NSSAI for the APN/DNN of the PDN
connection, see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.11.0a.5.
NOTE : The PGW-C+SMF shall also retrieve the Nssai resource from UDM, to avoid
selection a slice that is subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization (see clause 6.1.3.2.1).

### 6.2.8 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.2.8-1 are defined for the Nudm_UECM API. They
shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.2.8-1: Supported Features
+----------------+---------------------+-----------------------------+ | Feature number | Feature Name | Description | +================+=====================+=============================+ | 1 | SharedData | When receiving a | | | | Nudm_UECM_Registration | | | | service operation request | | | | for a UE that shares | | | | subscription data with | | | | other UEs, and the request | | | | does not indicate support | | | | of this feature by the | | | | service consumer, the UDM | | | | may -- based on operator | | | | policy -- decide to reject | | | | the registration. | +----------------+---------------------+-----------------------------+ | 2 | PatchReport | If some of the | | | | modifications included in | | | | the PATCH request are not | | | | successfully implemented, | | | | the UDM reports the result | | | | of PATCH request execution | | | | to the consumer. See | | | | clause 5.2.7.2 of | | | | 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]. | +----------------+---------------------+-----------------------------+ | 3 | SharedDataTreatment | This feature is an | | | | extension to the SharedData | | | | feature, i.e. support of | | | | SharedDataTreatment | | | | requires support of | | | | SharedData. | | | | | | | | When receiving a | | | | Nudm_UECM_Registration | | | | service operation request | | | | for a UE that shares | | | | subscription data with | | | | treatment instruction with | | | | other UEs, and the request | | | | does not indicate support | | | | of this feature by the | | | | service consumer, the UDM | | | | may -- based on operator | | | | policy -- decide to reject | | | | the registration. | +----------------+---------------------+-----------------------------+ | 4 | CAGFeature | If the NF consumer (AMF) | | | | does not support this | | | | feature and the UE is | | | | allowed to access 5GS via | | | | CAG cell(s) only, the UDM | | | | shall reject AMF | | | | registration. | +----------------+---------------------+-----------------------------+
### 6.2.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_UECM API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_UECM API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server,
by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_UECM service.
The Nudm_UECM API defines the following scopes for OAuth2 authorization:
Table 6.2.9-1: OAuth2 scopes defined in Nudm_UECM API
Scope Description
* * *
\"nudm-uecm\" Access to the Nudm UE Context Management API \"nudm-uecm:amf-
registration:write\" Write access (update/modify) to representations of the
Amf3GppAccessRegistration and AmfNon3GppAccessRegistration resources. \"nudm-
uecm:smf-registration:write\" Write access (create/delete/modify) to the
representations of a individualSmfRegistration resources. \"nudm-uecm:smsf-
registration:write\" Write access (create/delete/modify) to representations of
the Smsf3GppAccessRegistration and SmsfNon3GppAccessRegistration resources.
\"nudm-uecm:ip-sm-gw-registration:write Write access (create/delete/modify) to
the representation of the IpSmGwRegistration resource.
### 6.2.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different UDM service instance when
using direct or indirect communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]).
An SCP that reselects a different UDM producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new UDM producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an UDM redirects a service request to a different UDM using an 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code, the identity of the
new UDM towards which the service request is redirected shall be indicated in

Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
### 6.3.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_UEAU API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_UEAU API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server,
by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_UEAU service.
The Nudm_UEAU API defines the following scopes for OAuth2 authorization:
Table 6.3.9-1: Oauth2 scopes defined in Nudm_UEAU API
Scope Description
* * *
\"nudm-ueau\" Access to the Nudm_UEAU API \"nudm-ueau:security-
information:generate-auth-data:invoke\" Acess to invoke the \"generate-auth-
data\" custom operation on the \"security-information\" resource \"nudm-
ueau:security-information-rg:read\" Access to read the \"security-information-
rg\" resource \"nudm-ueau:auth-events:create\" Access to create a new child
resource on the \"auth-events\" collection resource \"nudm-ueau:auth-event-
id:modify\" Access to modify (delete) an \"auth-event-id\" individual resource
\"nudm-ueau:hss-security-information:generate-av:invoke\" Acess to invoke the
\"generate-av\" custom operation on the \"hss-security-information\" resource
\"nudm-ueau:gba-security-information:generate-av:invoke\" Acess to invoke the
\"generate-av\" custom operation on the \"gba-security-information\" resource
### 6.3.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different UDM service instance when
using direct or indirect communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]).
An SCP that reselects a different UDM producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new UDM producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an UDM redirects a service request to a different UDM using an 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code, the identity of the
new UDM towards which the service request is redirected shall be indicated in
the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary Redirect or 308
Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4].
## 6.4 Nudm_EventExposure Service API
### 6.4.1 API URI
URIs of this API shall have the following root:
{apiRoot}/\/\

### 6.4.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_EE API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_EE API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by
invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_EE service.
The Nudm_EE API defines the following scopes for OAuth2 authorization:
Table 6.4.9-1: Oauth2 scopes defined in Nudm_EE API
Scope Description
* * *
\"nudm-ee\" Access to the Nudm_EE API \"nudm-ee:subscription:create\" Access
to create EE Subscriptions \"nudm-ee:subscription:modify\" Access to update EE
Subscriptions
### 6.4.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different UDM service instance when
using direct or indirect communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]).
An SCP that reselects a different UDM producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new UDM producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an UDM redirects a service request to a different UDM using an 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code, the identity of the
new UDM towards which the service request is redirected shall be indicated in
the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary Redirect or 308
Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4].
## 6.5 Nudm_ParameterProvision Service API
### 6.5.1 API URI
URIs of this API shall have the following root:
{apiRoot}/{apiName}/\
The request URI used in HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"nudm-pp\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.5.3.

Editor\'s note: It is FFS how to handle Expected UE behaviour Parameters for
multiple AFs, pending stage-2 clarification.
Editor\'s note: it is FFS whether the dnnSnssaiSpecificGroup parameter applies
as well to individual UEs (i.e. not only to group of UEs); if this is
confirmed, the attribute name could be changed in the future.

execution to the consumer. See clause 5.2.7.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]. 2
ExpectedBehaviourMap This indicates that the UDM supports receiving Expected
Behaviour Parameters as a map of ExpectedUeBehaviourData. 3 MembersData This
indicates that the UDM supports receiving Gpsi(s) as a map of Gpsi for 5G VN
Group.
### 6.5.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_PP API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_PP API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by
invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.8.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_PP service.
The Nudm_PP API defines a single scope \"nudm-pp\" for OAuth2 authorization
(as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6]) for the entire API, and it does not
define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
### 6.5.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different UDM service instance when
using direct or indirect communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]).
An SCP that reselects a different UDM producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new UDM producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an UDM redirects a service request to a different UDM using an 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code, the identity of the
new UDM towards which the service request is redirected shall be indicated in
the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary Redirect or 308
Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4].
## 6.6 Nudm_NIDDAuthorization Service API
### 6.6.1 API URI
The Nudm_NIDDAuthorization service shall use the Nudm_NIDDAU API.
The API URI of the Nudm_NIDDAU API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
The request URI used in HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].

### 6.6.7 Error Handling
#### 6.6.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
#### 6.6.7.2 Protocol Errors
Protocol errors handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.7 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 6.6.7.3 Application Errors
The common application errors defined in the Table 5.2.7.2-1 in 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] may also be used for the Nudm_NIDD Authorization service. The following
application errors listed in Table 6.6.7.3-1 are specific for the Nudm_NIDD
Authorization service.

### 6.6.8 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.6.8-1 are defined for the Nudm_NIDDAU API.
They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in clause
6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.6.8-1: Supported Features
Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
### 6.6.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_NIDDAU API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF
RFC 6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_NIDDAU API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS
29.510 [19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_NIDDAU service.
The Nudm_NIDDAU API defines a single scope \"nudm-niddau\" for OAuth2
authorization (as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6]) for the entire API, and it
does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
### 6.6.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different UDM service instance when
using direct or indirect communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]).
An SCP that reselects a different UDM producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new UDM producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an UDM redirects a service request to a different UDM using an 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code, the identity of the
new UDM towards which the service request is redirected shall be indicated in
the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary Redirect or 308
Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4].
## 6.7 Nudm_MT Service API
### 6.7.1 API URI
URIs of this API shall have the following root:
{apiRoot}/{apiName}/\
The request URI used in HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"nudm-mt\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.7.3.

#### 6.7.6.3 Simple data types and enumerations
In this release of this specification, no simple data types and enumerations
are defined for the Nudm_MT Service.
### 6.7.7 Error Handling
#### 6.7.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
#### 6.7.7.2 Protocol Errors
Protocol errors handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.7 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 6.7.7.3 Application Errors
The common application errors defined in the Table 5.2.7.2-1 in 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] may also be used for the Nudm_MT service. The following application errors
listed in Table 6.7.7.3-1 are specific for the _Nudm__ MT service.
Table 6.7.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
USER_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found The user does not exist DATA_NOT_FOUND 404 Not
Found The requested UE data is not found/does not exist.
### 6.7.8 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.7.8-1 are defined for the Nudm_MT API. They
shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.7.8-1: Supported Features
Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
### 6.7.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_MT API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_MT API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by
invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_MT service.
The Nudm_MT API defines a single scope \"nudm-mt\" for OAuth2 authorization
(as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6]) for the entire API, and it does not
define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
### 6.7.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different UDM service instance when
using direct or indirect communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]).
An SCP that reselects a different UDM producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new UDM producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an UDM redirects a service request to a different UDM using an 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code, the identity of the
new UDM towards which the service request is redirected shall be indicated in
the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary Redirect or 308
Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4].
## 6.8 Nudm_ServiceSpecificAuthorization Service API
### 6.8.1 API URI
The Nudm_ServiceSpecificAuthorization service shall use the Nudm_SSAU API.
The API URI of the Nudm_SSAU API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
The request URI used in HTTP request from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the structure defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"nudm-ssau\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.8.3.
### 6.8.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.8.2.1 General

5 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
HTTP messages and bodies for the Nudm_ServiceSpecificAuthorization service
shall comply with the OpenAPI [14] specification contained in Annex A.9.
#### 6.8.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.8.2.2.1 General
The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in clause
5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
##### 6.8.2.2.2 Content type
The following content types shall be supported:
JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [15], signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 [16] signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\"
#### 6.8.2.3 HTTP custom headers
##### 6.8.2.3.1 General

### 6.8.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_SSAU API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_SSAU API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server,
by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_SSAU service.
The Nudm_SSAU API defines a single scope \"nudm-ssau\" for OAuth2
authorization (as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6]) for the entire API, and it
does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
### 6.8.10 HTTP redirection

Instance ID of the new UDM producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an UDM redirects a service request to a different UDM using an 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code, the identity of the
new UDM towards which the service request is redirected shall be indicated in
the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary Redirect or 308
Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[4].

##### 6.10.6.3.1 Introduction
This clause defines simple data types and enumerations that can be referenced
from data structures defined in the previous clauses.
### 6.10.7 Error Handling
#### 6.10.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
#### 6.10.7.2 Protocol Errors
Protocol errors handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.7 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
#### 6.10.7.3 Application Errors
The common application errors defined in the Table 5.2.7.2-1 in 3GPP TS 29.500
[4] may also be used for the Nudm_UEIdentifier service. The following
application errors listed in Table 6.8.7.3-1 are specific for the
Nudm_UEIdentifier service.

Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
### 6.10.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nudm_UEID API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [18]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [19]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nudm_UEID API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server,
by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[19], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nudm_UEID service.
The Nudm_UEID API defines a single scope \"nudm-ueid\" for OAuth2
authorization (as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [6]) for the entire API, and it
does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the Nudm Service API(s). It
consists of OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications, in YAML format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository, that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5.3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]
and clause 5B of 3GPP TR 21.900 [30]).

###### ## Annex B (informative): Stateless UDMs
Figure B-1 shows a scenario where the stateless UDM receives and processes a
request from an NF.
Figure B-1: Stateless UDM
1\. The stateless UDM receives a request from an NF. This can be a request to
perform an Nudm service, or a Notification that the UDM has previously
subscribed to at the NF by means of a service the UDM consumes from the NF. In
the later case the NF can be the UDR.
2\. The UDM retrieves data from the UDR that are required to process the
request. This step can be skipped if the request was a notification from the
UDR and contained enough information so that the UDM can process the request.
3\. The UDM processes the received request. This can include consuming
services from other NFs, consuming services from the UDR (e.g. to update data
or subscribe to notifications), and sending notifications to NFs that have
subscribed at the UDM to receive notifications, and includes sending the
response to the NF (all not shown in the figure).
4\. The UDM locally deletes the data retrieved in step 2 and/or received in
step 1.
Figure B-2 shows a scenario where an AMF subscribes to notifications of data
change (permanent provisioned subscription data) at the stateless UDM. The UDM
(UDM 1) stores the subscription to notification in the UE\'s context data at
the UDR.
Figure B-2: Subscription to notification
1\. The stateless UDM 1 receives a subscribe request from an AMF; see clause
5.2.2.3.2.
2.-3 The UDM retrieves UE context data from the UDR to be able to perform
required plausibility checks; see 3GPP TS 29.504 [9] clause 5.2.2.2.2.
4\. The UDM creates a new sdm subscription at the UDR; see 3GPP TS 29.504 [9]
clause 5.2.2.6.3.
5\. The UDR sends a 201 Created response containig a subscription ID
6\. The UDM send a 201 Created response passing the subscription ID received
in step 5 to the AMF.
7\. Permanent provisioned Subscription data are modified at the UDR.
8\. The UDR selects a suitable UDM and sends a Notification; see 3GPP TS
29.504 [9] clause 5.2.2.8. In addition to the data that have changed, the
Notification request message can contain enough (unchanged) information (e.g.
the information that has been created in step 4) allowing the UDM to perform
step 10 without the need to additionally retrieve information from the UDR.
9\. The UDM responds with 204 No Content.
10\. The UDM notifies the AMF according to the callback URI of the AMF
contained in the Notification received in step 8; see clause 5.2.2.5.2.
11\. The AMF responds with 204 No Content.
Figure B-3 shows a scenario where an AMF registers at the stateless UDM. The
UDM (UDM 1) stores the registration in the UE\'s context data at the UDR. The
AMF then requests to update the registration e.g. due to change of PEI. This
request is sent to UDM2 which belongs to the same UDM group as UDM1.
Figure B-3: AMF Registration and Update
1\. The AMF discovers (by means of NRF query) and selects an UDM and sends the
register request;
2.-3 The UDM retrieves UE context data from the UDR e.g. to be able to perform
required plausibility checks;
4.-5 The UDM updates UE context data in the UDR. The UDM also performs other
actions not shown in the figure, e.g deregister an old AMF, notify a
subscribed NEF, ...
6\. The UDM acknowldeges the AMF registration. The AMF stores the UDM group ID
as discovered and selected in step 1. The UDM locally deletes the data
retrieved in step 3.
7\. The AMF sends an update request (e.g. change of PEI) to one of the
available UDMs (UDM2) that belongs to the same UDM group as UDM1.
8.-9. The UDM retrieves UE context data from the UDR e.g. to be able to
perform required plausibility checks;
10.-11. The UDM updates UE context data in the UDR.The UDM also performs other
actions not shown in the figure, e.g. notify a subscribed NEF, ...
12\. The UDM sends update response to the AMF and locally deletes the data
retrieved in step 9.
NOTE: When a previously received Location Header or Callback URI is used for a
subsequent UDM contact, the authority part may need to be replaced to point to
the selected UDM.
Figure B-4 shows a scenario where an AF requests a subscription for all UEs
(any UE) for a given network event. The NEF discovers all UDM NFs providing
the necessary service to perform a bulk subscription. If one or several UDM
Group IDs are received, NEF selects only one instance of UDM for each Group ID
in order to perform the bulk subscription.
Figure B-4: Any UE Subscription
1\. An AF subscribes to a network event (e.g. SUPI-PEI association change) for
any UE (i.e. all UEs)
2\. The NEF discovers (by means of NRF query) all UDM instances supporting the
required service (e.g. nudm-ee). The NEF selects an UDM instance (e.g. UDM 1)
from each UDM Group ID discovered (UDM 1 and UDM 2 are in the same UDM Group
ID) and sends the subscribe request. The NEF also stores the UDM Group ID
information to select a UDM for subsequent subscriptions.
3-4. The UDM retrieves data from the UDR for group of UEs, e.g. to be able to
perform required plausibility checks
5-6. The UDM stores data for group of UEs in the UDR.
7\. The UDM acknowldeges the NEF subscription request. The UDM locally deletes
the data retrieved in step 3.
> Steps 7-12 in Figure B-3 are performed. As result of the subscription, NEF
> is notified by UDM 2 (change of PEI). Subsequently, when the event occurs
> for any UE (within the SUPI range, if applicable, served by the UDM Group
> ID), NEF is notified by either UDM1 or UDM 2.
###### ## Annex C (informative): SUCI encoding
The structure of the Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI) is defined in
3GPP TS 23.003 [8].
When SUCI needs to be sent as a character string (e.g. as a string in a JSON
payload of any of the service operations defined in the APIs defined in this
specification), the SUCI is composed as an UTF-8 character string, where the
different components are separated by the \"minus\" character \"-\" (UTF-8
0x2D).
These components shall be formatted as follows:
1) SUPI Type: a single decimal digit, from 0 to 7, formatted as a single UTF-8
character (UTF-8 0x30 to 0x37)
2) Home Network Identifier.
When the SUPI Type is an IMSI, the Home Network Identifier consists on 2
components: MCC and MNC, separated by the \"minus\" character; these
components are formatted as a string of 3 characters for MCC and a string of 2
or 3 characters for MNC (UTF-8 0x30 to 0x39).
When the SUPI type is a Network Specific Identifier, Global Line Identifier
(GLI) or Global Cable Identifier (GCI) the Home Network Identifier consists of
a string of characters with a variable length, formatted as an UTF-8 character
string.
3) Routing Indicator, consisting of 1 to 4 decimal digits formatted as a
string of 1 to 4 characters (UTF-8 0x30 to 0x39).
4) Protection Scheme Identifier, consisting in a value in the range of 0 to
15, representing a single hexadecimal digit, formatted as a single UTF-8
character (UTF-8 0x30 to 0x39, or 0x41 to 0x46, or 0x61 to 0x66).
5) Home Network Public Key Identifier, consisting in a value in the range 0 to
255, formatted as a sequence of 1 to 3 decimal digits, formatted of 1 to 3
UTF-8 characters (UTF-8 0x30 to 0x39).
6) Scheme Output, consisting of a string of UTF-8 characters with a variable
length, or a sequence of hexadecimal digits, dependent on the used protection
scheme. It represents the output of a public key protection scheme specified
in Annex C of 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] or the output of a protection scheme
specified by the HPLMN.
Finally, the above structure is prefixed by the string \"suci-\", when the
SUCI is sent in the \"SupiOrSuci\" data type definition, as described in 3GPP
TS 29.571 [7], Table 5.3.2-1.
For the SUPI types \"Network Specific Identifier (NSI)\", \"Global Line
Identifier (GLI)\", and \"Global Cable Identifier (GCI)\", the SUCI sent by
the UE to the AMF is always formatted as a NAI (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [8],
clauses 28.7.3, 28.15.5 and 28.16.5). In those cases, before sending such SUCI
to the UDM or AUSF, the AMF needs to re-encode the received SUCI, and format
it according to the structure described above (as an UTF-8 character string,
where the different components are separated by the \"minus\" character
\"-\").
EXAMPLES:
1) SUPI is IMSI-based; MCC=123, MNC=45, MSIN: 0123456789
SUPI type: 0 (IMSI)
Routing Indicator: 012
Protection Scheme: 0 (NULL scheme)
Home Network Public Key Identifier: 0
Scheme output = MSIN (cleartext)
\- SUCI UTF-8 string, as sent on the UDM APIs:
> \"suci-0-123-45-012-0-0-0123456789\"
NOTE: According to 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] (see annex C.2) the NULL scheme returns
the same output as the input (i.e. MSIN in this example), which can be packed
BCD coded. However, when formatted as character string in JSON, the scheme
output is expected to be reformatted from packed BCD (5 octets in this
example) to a sequence of decimal digits in UTF-8 (10 characters in this
example).
2) SUPI is IMSI-based, MCC=123, MNC=45, MSIN: 9876543210 (coded as 10
hexadecimal digits using 5 octets packed BCD coding: 89, 67, 45, 23, 01)
> SUPI type: 0 (IMSI)
>
> Routing Indicator: 0002
>
> Protection Scheme: 1 (Profile A)
>
> Home Network Public Key Identifier: 17
Scheme output = ECC ephemeral public key (32 octets, first bolded part below)
+ Encrypted MSIN (where MSIN has 10 digits, i.e. 5 octets coded as hexadecimal
digits using packed BCD coding, italic part below) + MAC tag (8 octets, last
bolded part below) = 50 octets = 100 hexadecimal characters
(NOTE: the keys and encrypted content below is fictitious).
