In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Overview
3GPP TS 23.558 [2] has specified the application layer architecture,
requirements, procedures, information flows and the APIs, in order to support
the edge applications over the 3GPP systems. Various features are defined to
ensure the efficient use and deployment of edge applications, some of which
include, registration, discovery, service provisioning, capability exposure,
support for service continuity and support for roaming and federation.
The present document specifies the north-bound APIs in detail, needed to
support the services offered by EES and ECS over EDGE-3/6/9/10 interfaces and
by CES and CAS over ECI-1/2/3/4 interfaces for enabling the edge applications
over 3GPP network.
Editor\'s note: The ECI interfaces' naming is FFS.

##### 5.2.2.2.2 EAS registering to EES using Eees_EASRegistration_Request
operation
To register itself as an Edge Application Server at the EES, the EAS shall
send an HTTP POST message to the Edge Enabler Server on the \"EAS
Registrations\" collection resource. The body of the HTTP POST message shall
include the EAS profile information, may include proposed expiration time for
the registration, as specified in clause 8.1.2.2.3.1.
Upon receiving the HTTP POST message from the EAS, the EES shall:
1\. Process the EAS registration request information;
2\. verify the identity of the Edge Application Server and check if the EAS is
authorized to register itself at EES ;
3\. if the EAS is authorized to register to EES, then the EES shall;
a. store the EAS profile and create a new resource with the EAS registration
information as specified in clause 8.1.2.1;
b. return the EAS registration information, the resource URI of the EAS
registration information, in the \"201 Created\" response message. The EES
shall include a Location HTTP header field. The Location header field shall
contain the URI of the created registration i.e. {apiRoot}/eees-
easregistration/\/registrations/{registrationId}.
The response message may include expiration time to indicate when the EAS
registration will automatically expire.
> On failure, the EES shall take proper error handling actions, as specified
> in clause 8.1.6, and respond to the EAS with an appropriate error status
> code.
If the expiration time is provided, then to maintain the registration, the EAS
shall send a registration update request (as described in clause 5.2.2.3)
prior to the expiration time. If the registration update request is not sent
before the expiry time, then the EES shall treat the EAS as deregistered and
remove the corresponding EAS registration resource.
#### 5.2.2.3 Eees_EASRegistration_Update

identifying the Individual EAS registration resource representation, as
specified in clause 8.1.2.3.3.2 for HTTP PUT message and in clause 8.1.2.3.3.4
for HTTP PATCH message.
The HTTP PUT message shall replace all properties in the existing resource
with the EAS registration information in the request. The EASRegistration data
type in the request body of the HTTP PUT message shall include the EAS profile
information, may include proposed expiration time to update the registration.
This request shall not replace the easId property of the existing resource.
The HTTP PATCH message includes parameters (EAS Profile, expiry time) in the
EASRegistrationPatch data type that need to modify the existing Individual EAS
registration resource. This request shall not replace the easId property of
the existing resource.
Upon receiving the HTTP PUT or PATCH message from the EAS, the EES shall:
1\. check the registration update message from the EAS to see if the EAS is
authorized to modify the requested registration resource;
2\. if the EAS is authorized to update the registration information, then the
EES shall:
a. update the resource identified by Resource URI of the EAS registration
information with the updated EAS registration information received in the HTTP
PUT or PATCH request message;
b. upon successful update of EAS registration information, respond to the EAS
with \"204 No Content\", or \"200 OK\" along with the updated EAS registration
information in the response. In the response message, the EES may provide an
updated expiration time to indicate to the EAS when the updated registration
will automatically expire.
On failure, the EES shall take proper error handling actions, as specified in
clause 8.1.6, and respond to the EAS with an appropriate error status code.
If the EES determines that the received HTTP PUT or PATCH request needs to be
redirected, the EES may respond with an HTTP \"307 Temporary Redirect\" status
code or an HTTP \"308 Permanent Redirect\" status code including an HTTP
\"Location\" header containing an alternative URI representing the end point
of an alternative EES where the message should be sent. Redirection handling
is described in clause 5.2.10 of 3GPP TS 29.122 [6].
If the expiration time is provided, then to maintain the registration, the EAS
shall send a registration update prior to registration expiry time. If the
registration update request is not sent before the expiry time, then the EES
shall treat EAS as deregistered and remove the corresponding EAS registration
resource.

#### 5.3.2.2 Eees_UELocation_Get
##### 5.3.2.2.1 General
This service operation is used by EAS to obtain a UE\'s location information
from a given EES.
##### 5.3.2.2.2 EAS obtaining UE location information from EES using
Eees_UELocation_Get operation
To obtain an UE\'s location information from the EES, the EAS shall send an
HTTP POST message to the EES on the URI \"{apiRoot}/eees-
uelocation/\/fetch\" as specified in clause 8.2.3.2. The POST
request includes:
\- the identifier of the UE for which location information is requested;
\- the accuracy of the requested location in terms of granularity and location
QoS.
Upon reception of the HTTP POST request from the EAS, the EES shall:
1\. process the EAS UE location information request;
2\. verify the identity of the Edge Application Server and check if the EAS is
authorized to obtain UE location information;
3\. if the EAS is authorized to obtain the UE\'s location information, then
the EES shall:
a. consider the location granularity information received in the request
message to obtain the UE\'s location information;
b. check if a valid locally cached UE location information is available, and
if available then the EES shall return the UE location information in the
format requested by the EAS along with the location accuracy and its
timestamp;
c. if valid UE location information is not available in local cache, then the
EES shall obtain the UE location information by consuming the 3GPP core
network capabilities. The EES shall return the UE location information to EAS
in the format requested by the EAS along with the location accuracy and its
timestamp as a 200 OK response.
On failure, the EES shall take proper error handling actions, as specified in
clause 8.2.6, and respond to the EAS with an appropriate error status code.
If the EES determines that the received HTTP POST request needs to be
redirected, the EES may respond with an HTTP \"307 Temporary Redirect\" status
code or an HTTP \"308 Permanent Redirect\" status code including an HTTP
\"Location\" header containing an alternative URI representing the end point
of an alternative EES where the message should be sent. Redirection handling
is described in clause 5.2.10 of 3GPP TS 29.122 [6].
##### 5.3.2.2.3 User consent management
Based on local regulations\' requirements and/or operator policies, user
consent management specified in Annex V of 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] may be required
for accessing the Eees_UELocation API. When it is the case and the EES is
accessing the 3GPP 5GC network services directly, the EES shall act as the
consent enforcement entity, as specified in clause 5.1.3 of 3GPP TS 33.558
[20].
When user consent management and enforcement shall be undertaken for the
Eees_UELocation API, then:
\- the EES shall check user consent for the targeted UE by retrieving the user
consent subscription data via the Nudm_SDM service API of the UDM, as
specified in clause 5.2.2.2.24 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [22] and:
\- if user consent is not granted for the targeted UE, the EES shall reject
the request and respond to the EAS with an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" status code
with the response body containing a ProblemDetails data structure with the
\"cause\" attribute including the \"USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED\" application
error; and
\- if user consent is granted for the targeted UE, the EES shall accept the
request to retrieve UE location information and process it as specified in
clause 5.3.2.2.2.
#### 5.3.2.3 Eees_UELocation_Subscribe

location reporting.
##### 5.3.2.3.2 EAS subscribing to continuous UE(s) location reporting from
EES using Eees_UELocation_Subscribe operation
To subscribe to continuous UE(s) location information reporting at the EES,
the EAS shall send a HTTP POST message to the EES on the \"Location
Information Subscriptions\" resource. The body of the POST message shall
include EAS identifier, the identifier of the UE or the identifier of the
group uniquely identifying a group of UEs, Notification Destination URI and
may include location format that is understood by EAS, location QoS, proposed
expiry time of the subscription and reporting requirements, as specified in
clause 8.2.2.2.3.1.
Upon receiving the HTTP POST message from the EAS, the EES shall:
1\. Process the EAS UE location information subscription request;
2\. verify the identity of the Edge Application Server and check if the EAS is
authorized to subscribe for the continuous UE(s) location reporting;
3\. if the EAS is authorized to subscribe for the continuous UE(s) location
information reporting, then the EES shall;
a. create a new resource with the Location Information Subscription as
specified in clause 8.2.2.1;
b. return the EAS\'s location subscription information, the resource URI of
the EAS location subscription, in the response message. The response message
may include expiration time to indicate when the location information
subscription will automatically expire;
> On failure, the EES shall take proper error handling actions, as specified
> in clause 8.2.6, and respond to the EAS with an appropriate error status
> code.
EES shall obtain the UE location information by consuming the 3GPP core
network capabilities from NEF as specified in 3GPP TS 29.522 [10], or from
SCEF as specified in 3GPP TS 29.122 [6] or from LCS (Location Service) as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.271 [23] or 3GPP TS 23.273 [24]. The EES may also
consume the UE mobility analytics from NEF as specified in 3GPP TS 29.522 [10]
or from NWDAF as specified in 3GPP TS 29.520 [12].
If the expiration time is provided, then to maintain the registration, the EAS
shall send a subscription update request (as described in clause 5.3.2.5)
prior to the expiration time. If the subscription update request is not sent
before the expiry time, then the EES shall treat the subscription as
unsubscribed and remove the corresponding EAS\'s Individual Location
Information Subscription resource.
##### 5.3.2.3.3 User consent management
Based on local regulations\' requirements and/or operator policies, user
consent management specified in Annex V of 3GPP TS 33.501 [6] may be required
for accessing the Eees_UELocation API. When it is the case and the EES is
accessing the 3GPP 5GC network services directly, the EES shall act as the
consent enforcement entity, as specified in clause 5.1.3 of 3GPP TS 33.558
[20].
When user consent management and enforcement shall be undertaken for the
Eees_UELocation API, then:
\- if the EAS does not support the \"UserConsentRevocation\" feature or does
not indicate its support for this feature in the HTTP POST request to create a
new \"Individual Location Information Subscription\" resource, the EES shall
reject the request and respond to the EAS with an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\"
status code with the response body containing a ProblemDetails data structure
with the \"cause\" attribute including the
\"CONSENT_REVOCATION_NOT_SUPPORTED\" application error;
\- if the EAS indicates its support for the \"UserConsentRevocation\" feature
in the HTTP POST request to create a new \"Individual Location Information
Subscription\" resource, the EES shall check user consent for the targeted
UE(s) by retrieving the user consent subscription data via the Nudm_SDM
service API of the UDM as specified in clause 5.2.2.2.24 of 3GPP TS 29.503
[22], subscribe to user consent revocation notifications only for those UE(s)
for which user consent is granted also using the Nudm_SDM service API of the
UDM and accept the request for the creation of the UE location information
subscription only for the UE(s) for which user consent is granted;
\- if user consent is not granted for all the targeted UE(s), the EES shall
reject the request and respond to the EAS with an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\"
status code with the response body containing a ProblemDetails data structure
with the \"cause\" attribute including the \"USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED\"
application error;
\- the EAS shall provide within the payload body of the HTTP POST request to
create a new UE location information subscription the URI via which it desires
to receive user consent revocation notifications within the
\"revocationNotifUri\" attribute. The EAS may update this URI in subsequent
HTTP PUT/PATCH requests to update/modify the corresponding \"Individual
Location Information Subscription\" resource;
\- when becoming aware of user consent revocation for one or several UE(s),
the EES shall:
\- stop processing the data related to the concerned UE(s);
\- send a user consent revocation notification to the EAS by sending an HTTP
POST request with the request body including the ConsentRevocNotif data
structure that shall contain the user consent revocation information (e.g.
UE(s) for which user consent was revoked, etc.); and
\- remove the concerned UE(s) from the \"Individual Location Information
Subscription\" resource and from the related subscriptions at the 3GPP 5GC

#### 5.10.2.3 Eees_EECContextRelocation_Push
##### 5.10.2.3.1 General
This service operation is used by a service consumer (e.g., S-EES, CES) to
relocate the EEC context information to the T-EES, as specified in 3GPP TS
23.558 [2].
##### 5.10.2.3.2 Service consumer relocating EEC context information from the
service consumer to T-EES using Eees_EECContextRelocation_Push operation
To transfer the EEC context information from a service consumer (e.g., S-EES,
CES) to the T-EES, the service consumer shall send HTTP POST message to the
T-EES, with the request URI set to \"{apiRoot}/eees-eeccontextreloc/v1/eec-
contexts\" as specified in the clause 8.7.2.2.3.2. The request body shall
include the EEC Context information and identifier of the service consumer
requesting to relocate the EEC Context.
Upon receiving the HTTP POST message from the service consumer, the T-EES
shall:
1\. Validate the request and verifies if the service consumer is authorized to
transfer the EEC context;
2\. if the service consumer is authorised, then authorizes the EEC context
relocation, based on EEC context identifier in the request;
3\. if authorized, the T-EES stores the EEC Context and respond with either:
\- an HTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the response body including the
EECContextPushRes data structure containing the EEC registration identifier,
and if available, the associated expiration time, if implicit registration of
the EEC at the T-EES is performed, i.e. in the case of **S-EAS decided ACR
scenario specified in clause 8.8.2.4 and 8.8.2B.2.4 of 3GPP TS 23.558 [2] or
S-EES executed ACR scenarios specified in clause 8.8.2.5 and 8.8.2B.2.5 of
3GPP TS 23.558 [2]; or**
\- an HTTP \"204 No content\" status code, indicating that the EEC Context
transfer is successful, if implicit registration of the EEC at the T-EES is
not performed.
NOTE: If the EEC, for which the EEC context is pushed by the service consumer,
is not registered with the T-EES, then the T-EES determines that the push
request is for **S-EAS decided ACR in clause 8.8.2.4 and 8.8.2B.2.4 of 3GPP TS
23.558 [2] or S-EES executed ACR scenarios defined in clauses 8.8.2.5 and
8.8.2B.2.5 of 3GPP TS 23.558 [2].**
On failure, the T-EES shall take proper error handling actions, as specified
in clause 8.7.6, and respond to the service consumers with an appropriate
error status code.
On success, if the EEC registration ID and the associated expiration time are
provided by the T-EES in the EEC context push response, then the service
consumer stores them, and when required, includes them in the subsequent ACR
information notification towards the EEC.

authorized to modify the requested registration resource;
2\. if the EES is authorized to update the registration information:
a. update the resource identified by Resource URI of the EES registration
information with the updated EES registration information received in the HTTP
PUT or PATCH request message;
b. return the updated EES registration information in the \"200 OK\" response
message or respond with the \"204 No Content\" message indicating to the EES
that the EES registration information is updated successfully. In the response
message, the ECS may provide an updated expiration time to indicate to the EES
when the updated registration will automatically expire.
On failure, the ECS shall take proper error handling actions, as specified in
clause 9.1.6, and respond to the EES with an appropriate error status code.
If the ECS determines that the received HTTP PUT or PATCH request needs to be
redirected, the ECS may respond with an HTTP \"307 Temporary Redirect\" status
code or an HTTP \"308 Permanent Redirect\" status code including an HTTP
\"Location\" header containing an alternative URI representing the end point
of an alternative ECS where the message should be redirected. Redirection
handling is described in clause 5.2.10 of 3GPP TS 29.122 [6].
If the expiration time is provided, then to maintain the registration, the EES
shall send a registration update prior to registration expiry time. If the
registration update request is not sent before the expiry time, then the ECS
shall treat EES as deregistered and remove the corresponding EES registration
resource.

To deregister itself from the ECS, the EES shall send HTTP DELETE message to
the ECS, on the resource URI identifying the individual EES registration
resource representation as specified in clause 9.1.2.3.3.3. Upon receiving the
HTTP DELETE request, the ECS shall:
1\. verify the identity of the EES and check if the EES is authorized to
deregister the EES registration information;
2\. if the EES is authorized to deregister the EES registration information,
then the ECS shall deregister the EES profile from the ECS and delete the
resource representing EES registration information.
3\. return the \"204 Not Content\" message to the EES, indicating the
successful deregistration of the EES information.
On failure, the ECS shall take proper error handling actions, as specified in
clause 9.1.6, and respond to the EES with an appropriate error status code.

entities as a result of API invocation requests and event notifications. The
stage-2 level requirements and signalling flows are defined in 3GPP TS 23.558
[2].
Several design aspects, as mentioned in the following clauses, are specified
in 3GPP TS 29.122 [6] and referenced by this specification.
## 7.2 Data Types
### 7.2.1 General
This clause defines structured data types, simple data types and enumerations
that are applicable to several APIs defined in the present specification and
can be referenced from data structures defined in the subsequent clauses.
In addition, data types that are defined in OpenAPI 3.0.0 Specification [3]
can also be referenced from data structures defined in the subsequent clauses.
NOTE: As a convention, data type\'s names in the present specification are
with an upper-case letter in the beginning. Parameters are with a lower-case
letter in the beginning. As an exception, data types that are also defined in
OpenAPI 3.0.0 Specification [3] can use a lower-case case letter in the
beginning for consistency.
Table 7.2.1-1 specifies data types re-used by APIs in this specification from
other specifications, including a reference to their respective specifications
and when needed, a short description of their use within the APIs of this
specification.

# 10 Using Common API Framework
## 10.1 General
EES may expose its services to EAS with support of CAPIF. Also, the EES may
also re-expose the network capabilities of the 3GPP core network to the EAS(s)
with support of CAPIF architecture, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.558 [2]. When
CAPIF is used with EES services, the EES shall support the following as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.222 [17]:
\- the API exposing function and related APIs over CAPIF-2/2e and CAPIF-3/3e
reference points;
\- the API publishing function and related APIs over CAPIF-4/4e reference
point;
\- the API management function and related APIs over CAPIF-5/5e reference
point; and
\- at least one of the security methods for authentication and authorization,
and related security mechanisms.
The EAS supports the role of API Invoker as specified in 3GPP TS 29.222 [17].
In a centralized deployment as defined in 3GPP TS 23.222 [17], where the CAPIF
core function and API provider domain functions are co-located, the
interactions between the CAPIF core function and API provider domain functions
may be independent of CAPIF-3/3e, CAPIF-4/4e and CAPIF-5/5e reference points.
When CAPIF is used with an EES service, the EES shall register all the
features for northbound APIs in the CAPIF Core Function.
The EAS may expose its services to other EAS(s) using CAPIF as specified in
3GPP TS 23.558 [2]. When CAPIF is used for exposure of EAS services to other
EAS(s), the above procedure shall be applicable with the following
differences:
\- the provisions related to the EES apply to the EAS;
\- the provisions related to the EAS apply to the other EAS(s) as consumer(s)
of the exposed EAS service APIs.
## 10.2 Security
When CAPIF is used for external exposure of EES services to EAS, before
invoking the API exposed by the EES, the EAS as API invoker shall negotiate
the security method (PKI, TLS-PSK or OAUTH2) with CAPIF core function and
ensure the EAS has enough credential to authenticate the EAS (see 3GPP TS
29.222 [17], clause 5.6.2.2 and clause 6.2.2.2).
If PKI or TLS-PSK is used as the selected security method between the EAS and
the EES, upon API invocation, the EES shall retrieve the authorization
information from the CAPIF core function as described in 3GPP TS 29.222 [17],
clause 5.6.2.4.
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.122 [18], the access to the EES APIs may be
authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [19]), where the
CAPIF core function (see 3GPP TS 29.222 [17]) plays the role of the
authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used as the selected security method between the EAS and the EES,
then the EAS, prior to consuming services offered by the EES APIs, shall
obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by invoking the
Obtain_Authorization service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.222 [17], clause
5.6.2.3.2.
The EES APIs do not define any scopes for OAuth2 authorization. It is the EES
responsibility to check whether the EAS is authorized to use an API based on
the \"token\". Once the EES verifies the \"token\", it shall check whether the
EES identifier in the \"token\" matches its own published identifier, and
whether the API name in the \"token\" matches its own published API name. If
those checks are passed, the EAS has full authority to access any resource or
operation for the invoked API
NOTE: For aforementioned security methods, the EES needs to apply admission
control according to access control policies after performing the
authorization checks.
When CAPIF is used for exposure of EAS services to other EAS(s), the above
security procedure shall be applicable with the following differences:
\- the provisions related to the EES apply to the EAS;
\- the provisions related to the EAS apply to the other EAS(s) as consumer(s)
of the exposed EAS service APIs.
# 11 Security
The authentication and authorization between EES and ECS shall be as specified
in 3GPP TS 33.558 [20].
The authentication and authorization in EES capability exposure shall be as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.558 [20]. When CAPIF is used, the aspects specified in
clause 10 shall be used.
The security credentials to be used for verification and authorization of
various API requests from EAS and EES shall be as specified in 3GPP TS 33.558
[20].
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This annex is based on the OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification [3] and provides
corresponding representations of all APIs defined in the present specification
in YAML format.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API.
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification file contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900
[4] and clause 5.3.1 of the 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] for further information).
