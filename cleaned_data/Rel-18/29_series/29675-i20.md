#### 4.2.2.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to create UE radio
capability provisioning resource for Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability
IDs.
The following procedure using the Nucmf_Provisioning_Create service operation
is supported:
\- creating a UE radio capability provisioning resource.
#### 4.2.2.2 Creating UE radio capability provisioning resource
This procedure is used by the NF service consumer (e.g. NEF) to create a UE
radio capability provisioning resource containing UCMF dictionary entries for
Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501
[2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
Figure 4.2.2.2-1: Creating new UE radio capability provisioning resource
To create a UE radio capability provisioning resource, the NF service consumer
shall send an HTTP POST request to the UCMF with: \"{apiRoot}/nucmf-
provisioning/\/provisionings\" as request URI as shown in step 1
of figure 4.2.2.2-1, and the \"RacsData\" data structure as request body. The
\"RacsData\" data type shall contain one or more RACS configurations in the
\"racsConfigs\" attribute which include:
\- a RACS ID in the \"racsId\" attribute;
\- UE radio capability information in the \"racsParamEps\" and/or
\"racsParam5Gs\" attributes; and
\- the related UE model(s) IMEI-TAC value(s) in the \"imeiTacs\" attribute.
Upon reception of the HTTP POST message from the NF service consumer
requesting to create UCMF dictionary entries, the UCMF shall, for each
requested RACS ID, check if there is any existing dictionary entry having the
same RACS ID. If yes, the UCMF shall indicate \"RACS_ID_DUPLICATED\" in the
\"result\" attribute for the requested RACS ID; otherwise if there is no other
error the UCMF shall create a UCMF dictionary entry.
After processing all requested RACS IDs, if at least one UCMF dictionary entry
is successfully provisioned, the UCMF shall create the resource \"Individual
UE radio capability provisioning\" and respond \"201 Created\" as shown in
step 2 of figure 4.2.2.2-1 with the successfully provisioned RACS information,
the UCMF may include RACS report(s) within attribute \"racsReports\" with a
list of RACS ID(s) and the corresponding failure code for which the
provisioning has failed as specified in table 5.16.2.2.3-1 of 3GPP TS 29.122
[15] in the body of the HTTP response; otherwise the UCMF shall respond \"500
Internal Server Error\" and may include the RACS report(s) to indicate failure
details.
### 4.2.3 Nucmf_Provisioning_Update service operation
#### 4.2.3.1 General

#### 4.2.3.2 Modifying a UE radio capability provisioning resource
Figure 4.2.3.2-1: Modifying a UE radio capability provisioning resource
In order to modify a UE radio capability provisioning resource, i.e. add new
UCMF dictionary entries, update and/or remove the existing UCMF dictionary
entries for one or more RACS ID(s), the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP
PUT or PATCH request to the UCMF with: \"{apiRoot}/nucmf-
provisioning/\/provisionings/{provisioningId}\" as request URI as
shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.3.2-1, and the \"RacsData\" or \"RacsDataPatch\"
data structure as request body, correspondingly. The \"RacsData\" or
\"RacsDataPatch\" data type shall contain one or more RACS configurations in
the \"racsConfigs\" attribute which include:
\- a RACS ID in the \"racsId\" attribute;
\- UE radio capability information in the \"racsParamEps\" and/or
\"racsParam5Gs\" attributes; and
\- the related UE model(s) IMEI-TAC value(s) in the \"imeiTacs\" attribute.
Upon reception of the HTTP PUT message from the NF service consumer, the UCMF
shall start replacing the existing UE radio capability provisioning resource
and update the corresponding UCMF dictionary entr(ies).
Upon reception of the HTTP PATCH message from the NF service consumer, the
UCMF shall start modifying the existing UE radio capability provisioning
resource:
\- remove RACS ID and its UE radio capability information with a NULL map key
value, and the corresponding UCMF dictionary entry;
\- replace the UE radio capability information for any existing RACS ID in the
resource, and the corresponding UCMF dictionary entry; and/or
\- create a UCMF dictionary entry for any new RACS ID if there is no ID
conflict with other existing resources.
After processing all requested RACS IDs, if at least one UCMF dictionary entry
is successfully provisioned, the UCMF shall respond \"200 OK\" as shown in
step 2 of figure 4.2.3.2-1 with the successfully provisioned RACS information,
the UCMF may include RACS report(s) within attribute \"racsReports\" with a
list of RACS ID(s) and the corresponding failure code for which the
provisioning has failed as specified in table 5.16.2.2.3-1 of 3GPP TS 29.122
[15] in the body of the HTTP response; otherwise the UCMF shall respond \"500
Internal Server Error\" and may include the RACS report(s) to indicate failure
details.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the UCMF determines the received
HTTP PUT or PATCH request needs to be redirected, the UCMF shall send an HTTP
redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
### 4.2.4 Nucmf_Provisioning_Delete service operation
#### 4.2.4.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to remove UE radio
capability provisioning resource for Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability
IDs.
The following procedure using the Nucmf_Provisioning_Delete service operation
is supported:
\- removing an existing UE radio capability provisioning resource.
#### 4.2.4.2 Removing a UE radio capability provisioning resource
Figure 4.2.4.2-1: Removing a UE radio capability provisioning resource
In order to remove a UE radio capability provisioning resource, the NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request to the UCMF with:
\"{apiRoot}/nucmf-provisioning/\/provisionings/{provisioningId}\"
as request URI as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.4.2-1.
Upon successful reception of the HTTP DELETE, the UCMF shall remove the
corresponding resource and the corresponding UCMF dictionary entries, and send
an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response as shown in step 2 of figure 4.2.4.2-1.
If the UCMF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP DELETE request due to
the internal error or the error in the HTTP DELETE request, the UCMF shall
send the HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the UCMF determines the received
HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the UCMF shall send an HTTP
redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

## 5.7 Error Handling
### 5.7.1 General
For the Nucmf_Provisioning API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors and application
errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] shall be supported
for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as
mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Nucmf_Provisioning API.
### 5.7.2 Protocol Errors
No specific procedures for the Nucmf_Provisioning service are specified.
### 5.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nucmf_Provisioning service are listed
in table 5.7.3-1.
Table 5.7.3-1: Application errors
* * *
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
## 5.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.8-1 are defined for the Nucmf_Provisioning
API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in
clause 6.6.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 5.8-1: Supported Features
* * *
Feature number Feature Name Description 1 ES3XX Extended Support for 3xx
redirections. This feature indicates the support of redirection for any
service operation, according to Stateless NF procedures as specified in
clauses 6.5.3.2 and 6.5.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] and according to HTTP
redirection principles for indirect communication, as specified in clause
6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
* * *
## 5.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nucmf_Provisioning API may be authorized by means of the Oauth2 protocol (see
IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [10])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If Oauth2 is used, an NF service consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nucmf_Provisioning API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS
29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF service consumer used for
discovering the Nucmf_Provisioning service.
The Nucmf_Provisioning API defines a single scope \"nucmf-provisioning\" for
the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource
or operation level.
