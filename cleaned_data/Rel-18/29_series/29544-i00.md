# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Introduction
Within the 5GC, the SP-AF offers services to the UDM and to the SOR-AF via the
Nspaf service based interface.
The UDM or SOR-AF shall make use of the SP-AF services when it needs to
protect UE parameters for which the final consumer is the USIM (see 3GPP TS
33.501 [8] clause 6.15.2.1).
Figure 4.1-1 provides the reference model with focus on the SP-AF.
NOTE: The generation of the secured packet and the definition of the storage
and handling of OTA keys or other sensitive data are out of scope of this
document. For more details, refer to 3GPP TS 23.040 [18] and 3GPP TS 31.115
[16].

## 5.2 Nspaf_SecuredPacket Service
### 5.2.1 Service Description
The Nspaf_SecuredPacket Service may be consumed by the NF consumer (e.g. UDM
or SOR-AF) when it has detected that a UICC configuration parameter (e.g.
Routing ID data or Steering of Roaming information) needs to be updated, and
the new value is not available in secured packet format.
For the list of service operations see clause 5.2.2.1
### 5.2.2 Service Operations
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
For the Nspaf_SecuredPacket service the following service operations are
defined:
\- Provide
The Nspaf_SecuredPacket Service is used by Consumer NFs (e.g. UDM or SOR-AF)
to request the SP-AF to provide a secured packet that contains an UICC
configuration parameter as sent in the request by means of the Provide service
operation
#### 5.2.2.2 Provide
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
This service operation is used by the NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM or SOR-AF)
to request construction of a secured packet that contains the provided UICC
configuration information (e.g. Routing Indicator or Steering of Roaming
information).
The following procedures using the Provide service operation are supported:
\- Secured Packet Retrieval
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Secured Packet Retrieval
Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF consumer (e.g. UDM or SOR-AF)
sends a request to the SP-AF to provide a secured packet.
The request contains the UE\'s identity (/{supi}) and the UICC configuration
parameter.
Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1: NF consumer requests the SP-AF to provide a secured packet
1\. The NF consumer sends a POST request (custom method: provide-secured-
packet) to the resource representing the SUPI.
2a. On success, the SP-AF responds with \"200 OK\", containing the requested
SecuredPacket.
2b. If the resource does not exist (the supi is unknown in the SP-AF), the SP-
AF returns the HTTP status code \"404 Not Found\", and additional error
information should be included in the response body (in \"ProblemDetails\"
element).
On failure, the appropriate HTTP status code indicating the error shall be
returned and appropriate additional error information should be returned in
the POST response body.
# 6 API Definitions
## 6.1 Nspaf_SecuredPacket Service API

### 6.1.7 Error Handling
#### 6.1.7.1 General
For the Nspaf_SecuredPacket API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors and application
errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] shall be supported
for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as
mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Nspaf_SecuredPacket API.
#### 6.1.7.2 Protocol Errors
No specific procedures for the Nspaf_SecuredPacket service are specified.
#### 6.1.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nspaf_SecuredPacket service are listed
in Table 6.1.7.3-1.

USER_NOT_FOUND 404 Not Found The user does not exist
### 6.1.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 6.1.8-1 are defined for the Nspaf_SecuredPacket
API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in
clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
### 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nspaf_SecuredPacket API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see
IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [10])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nspaf_SecuredPacket API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nspaf_SecuredPacket service.
The Nspaf_SecuredPacket API defines a single scope \"nspaf-secured-packet\"
for the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the
present specification. It consists of OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications in YAML
format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository, that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1
