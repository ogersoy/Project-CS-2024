2) PDU Session traffic analytics requirements in \"pduSesTrafReqs\" attribute,
which includes the known Application Identifier, IP Descriptions or Domain
Descriptors; and
3) DNN and/or S-NSSAI for the PDU Session(s) in the \"dnns\" and/or
\"snssais\" attributes.
and may include:
1) identification of network area to which the subscription applies by
\"networkArea\" attribute and/or
2) an optional list of analytics subsets by \"listOfAnaSubsets\" attribute
with value(s) only applicable to \"PDU_SESSION_TRAFFIC\" event, if the
\"EneNA\" features is supported.
\- if the feature \"MovementBehaviour\" is supported and the event is
\"MOVEMENT_BEHAVIOUR\", shall provide:
1) identification of network area to which the subscription applies by
\"networkArea\" attribute;
\- and may include:
1) identification of the preferred orientation of location information by \"
locOrientation\" attribute;
2) Movement Behaviour analytics requirements in \"movBehavReqs\" attribute,
which includes preferred granularity of location information or preferred
orientation of location information; and/or
3) an optional list of analytics subsets by \"listOfAnaSubsets\" attribute
with value(s) only applicable to \"MOVEMENT_BEHAVIOUR\" event, if the
\"EneNA\" features is supported.
NOTE 12: The predictions are not applicable for PDU Session traffic analytics.
\- if the feature \"LocAccuracy\" is supported and the event is
\"LOC_ACCURACY\", it shall provide:
1) either a network area to which the subscription applies within the
\"networkArea\" attribute or an exact location to which the subscription
applies within the \"location\" attribute;
\- and may include:
1) Location accuracy analytics requirements within the \"locAccReqs\"
attribute; and/or
2) an optional list of analytics subsets within the \"listOfAnaSubsets\"
attribute with value(s) only applicable to the \"LOC_ACCURACY\" event, if the
\"EneNA\" features is supported.
NOTE 13: Location accuracy analytics do not have a target UE, they are always
for any UE.
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/subscriptions\" as Resource URI and
NnwdafEventsSubscription data structure as request body, if no errors occur,
the NWDAF shall:
> \- create a new subscription;
>
> \- assign an event subscriptionId; and
>
> \- store the subscription.
If the NWDAF created an \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription\" resource, the
NWDAF shall respond with \"201 Created\" status code with the message body
containing a representation of the created subscription, as shown in figure
4.2.2.2.2-1, step 2. If not all the requested analytics events in the
subscription are accepted, then the NWDAF may include the \"failEventReports\"
attribute indicating the event(s) for which the subscription failed and the
associated reason(s). The NWDAF shall include a Location HTTP header field.
The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created subscription
i.e. \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\". If the
immediate reporting indication in the \"immRep\" attribute within the
\"evtReq\" attribute sets to true in the event subscription, the NWDAF shall
include the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST
response.
When the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the
request, the NWDAF shall mute the event notification and store the available
events until the NF service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the
\"notifFlag\" attribute to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs
(e.g. full buffer). When a muting exception occurs, the NWDAF may consider the
contents of the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute (if provided) and/or local
configuration to determine its actions.
If the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the NWDAF accepts the muting
instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the \"notifFlagInstruct\"
attributes, it may indicate the applied muting notification settings within
the \"mutingSetting\" attribute in the response. If the NWDAF does not accept
the muting instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the
\"notifFlagInstruct\" attributes, it shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\"
error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".
If the analytics target period provided in the body of the HTTP POST request
includes the start time in the past and the end time in the future, the NWDAF
shall reject the request with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response including
the \"cause\" attribute set to \"BOTH_STAT_PRED_NOT_ALLOWED\".
If the statistics in the past are requested but the necessary data to perform
the service is unavailable, the NWDAF shall reject the request with an HTTP
\"500 Internal Server Error\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set
to \"UNAVAILABLE_DATA\".
If the user consent has not been checked by the NF service consumer and is
required for the requested analytics collection depending on local policy and
regulations, then the NWDAF shall check user consent for the targeted UE(s) by
retrieving the user consent subscription data via the Nudm_SDM service API of
the UDM as described in clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [23]. If the NWDAF
receive the response from the UDM that it is not granted for the impacted
user(s), then the NWDAF shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response
including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED\".
NOTE 14: When the target of reporting is a SUPI or a GPSI then the
subscription can be rejected, e.g. because user consent is not granted, and
the error is sent to the consumer. When the target of reporting is an Internal
Group Id, or a list of SUPIs/GPSI(s) or any UE, and the user consent is not
granted for a subset of the impacted users, then no error is sent, but a
subset of the SUPIs/GPSIs is skipped if user consent is not granted.
If an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the NWDAF shall send
an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
##### 4.2.2.2.3 Update subscription for event notifications
Figure 4.2.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the NWDAF to update the subscription for event notifications (see
also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).
Figure 4.2.2.2.3-1: NF service consumer updates subscription to notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Subscribe
service operation to update subscription to event notifications. The NF
service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource
URI representing the \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription\", as shown in
figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step 1, to update the subscription for an \"Individual
NWDAF Event Subscription\" resource identified by the {subscriptionId}. The
NnwdafEventsSubscription data structure provided in the request body shall
include the same contents as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2.
Upon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource
URI and NnwdafEventsSubscription data structure as request body, the NWDAF
shall:
\- update the subscription of corresponding subscriptionId; and
\- store the subscription.
NOTE: The \"notificationURI\" attribute within the NnwdafEventsSubscription
data structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are
sent to a new NF service consumer.
If the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP PUT
request, the NWDAF shall update an \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription\"
resource, and shall respond with:
a) HTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing a
representation of the updated subscription, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1,
step 2a. If not all the requested analytics events in the subscription are
modified successfully, then the NWDAF may include the \"failEventReports\"
attribute indicating the event(s) for which the modification failed and the
associated reason(s); or
b) HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step
2b.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP PUT request, the NWDAF shall send an
HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
If the analytics target period provided in the body of the HTTP PUT request
includes the start time in the past and the end time in the future, the NWDAF
shall reject the request with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response including
the \"cause\" attribute set to \"BOTH_STAT_PRED_NOT_ALLOWED\".
If the statistics in the past are requested but the necessary data to perform
the service is unavailable, the NWDAF shall reject the request with an HTTP
\"500 Internal Server Error\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set
to \"UNAVAILABLE_DATA\".
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NWDAF determines the received
HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect
response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
When the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included in the request with the value
\"DEACTIVATE\", the NWDAF shall mute the event notification and store the
available events until the NF service consumer requests to retrieve them by
setting the \"notifFlag\" attribute to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting
exception occurs (e.g. full buffer). When a muting exception occurs, the NWDAF
may consider the contents of the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute (if provided)
and/or local configuration to determine its actions; if the \"notifFlag\"
attribute is set to the value \"RETRIEVAL\", the NWDAF shall send the stored
events to the NF service consumer, mute the event notification again and store
available events; if the \"notifFlag\" attribute is set to the value
\"ACTIVATE\" and the event notifications are muted (due to a previously
received \"DECATIVATE\" value), the NWDAF shall unmute the event notification,
i.e. start sending again notifications for available events.
If the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the NWDAF accepts the muting
instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the \"notifFlagInstruct\"
attributes, it may indicate the applied muting notification settings within
the \"mutingSetting\" attribute in the response. If the NWDAF does not accept
the muting instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the
\"notifFlagInstruct\" attributes, it shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\"
error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".
#### 4.2.2.3 Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Unsubscribe service operation
##### 4.2.2.3.1 General
The Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Unsubscribe service operation is used by an NF
service consumer to unsubscribe from event notifications.
##### 4.2.2.3.2 Unsubscribe from event notifications
Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the NWDAF to unsubscribe from event notifications (see also 3GPP TS
23.288 [17]).
{width="6.0256944444444445in" height="1.6444444444444444in"}
Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes from notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_UnSubscribe
service operation to unsubscribe to event notifications. The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource
URI, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the event subscriptionId of the existing
subscription that is to be deleted.
Upon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource
URI, if the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE
request, the NWDAF shall:
\- remove the corresponding subscription; and
\- respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall send
an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NWDAF determines the received
HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP
redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
#### 4.2.2.4 Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Notify service operation
##### 4.2.2.4.1 General
The Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Notify service operation is used by an NWDAF to
notify NF consumers about subscribed events or by the target NWDAF to notify
the consumer of the successful analytics subscription transfer.
##### 4.2.2.4.2 Notification about subscribed event
Figure 4.2.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the NWDAF sends a request to the NF
service consumer to notify for event notifications or notify for the
successful analytics subscription transfer (see also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).
{width="6.65in" height="1.8409722222222222in"}
Figure 4.2.2.4.2-1: NWDAF notifies the subscribed event
The NWDAF shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Notify service operation
to notify the subscribed event or the successful analytics subscription
transfer. The NWDAF shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{notificationURI}\"
received in the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Subscribe service operation as
Resource URI, as shown in figure 4.2.2.4.2-1, step 1.
If both the repetition period (\"repPeriod\" or \"repetitionPeriod\")
attribute and the \"offsetPeriod\" attribute are present in the subscription
request for periodical notification, the NWDAF shall produce a notification in
every repetition period seconds, including the statistics in the past offset
period if the \"offsetPeriod\" attribute value is negative, or including the
prediction for the future offset period if the \"offsetPeriod\" attribute
value is positive.
The NnwdafEventsSubscriptionNotification data structure provided in the
request body shall include:
\- If the notification is for notifying about subscribed events, a description
of the notified event as \"eventNotifications\" attribute that for each event
shall include:
a) an event identifier as \"event\" attribute;
b) network slice load level information in the \"sliceLoadLevelInfo\"
attribute when subscribed event is \"SLICE_LOAD_LEVEL\";
c) service experience information as \"svcExps\" attribute when subscribed
event is \"SERVICE_EXPERIENCE\";
d) UE mobility information in the \"ueMobs\" attribute when subscribed event
is \"UE_MOBILITY\";

subscribed event is \"QOS_SUSTAINABILITY\";
i) NF load information in \"nfLoadLevelInfos\" attribute when subscribed event
is \"NF_LOAD\";
j) network performance information in the \"nwPerfs\" attribute when
subscribed event is \"NETWORK_PERFORMANCE\";
k) Load level information for the network slice(s) and the optionally
associated network slice instance(s) in \"nsiLoadLevelInfos\" attribute when
subscribed event is \"NSI_LOAD_LEVEL\";
l) Dispersion information in the \"disperInfos\" attribute when subscribed
event is \"DISPERSION\";
m) Redundant transmission experience information in the \"redTransInfos\"
attribute when subscribed event is \"RED_TRANS_EXP\";
n) WLAN performance information in the \"wlanInfos\" attribute when subscribed
event is \"WLAN_PERFORMANCE\";
o) DN performance information in the \"DnPerformance\" attribute when
subscribed event is \"DN_PERFORMANCE\";
p) SMCCE performance information in the \"smccExps\" attribute when subscribed
event is \"SM_CONGESTION\";
q) PFD Determination information for known application identifier(s) in the
\"pfdDetermInfos\" attribute when subscribed event is \"PFD_DETERMINATION\";
r) PDU Session traffic information in the \"pduSesTrafInfos\" attribute when
subscribed event is \"PDU_SESSION_TRAFFIC\";
s) E2E data volume transfer time in the \"dataVlTrnsTmInfos\" attribute when
subscribed event is \"E2E_DATA_VOL_TRANS_TIME\";
t) Movement Behaviour information in the \"movBehavInfos\" attribute when

subscribed event is \"LOC_ACCURACY\";
and may include:
a) information about analytics metadata required for aggregation of the
analytics in the \"anaMetaInfo\" attribute if the feature \"Aggregation\" is
supported;
b) the start time of which the analytics information will become valid in the
\"start\" attribute, if the \"EneNA\" feature is supported;
c) the expiration time after which the analytics information will become
invalid in the \"expiry\" attribute.
d) the analytics accuracy information in \"accuInfo\" attribute, if the
feature \"AnalyticsAccuracy\" is supported and the analytics accuracy
requirement was subscribed in the \"accuReq\" attribute.
e) the pause analytics consumption indication in \"pauseInd\" attribute, if
the feature \"AnalyticsAccuracy\" is supported.
f) the resume analytics consumption indication in \"resumeInd\" attribute, if
the feature \"AnalyticsAccuracy\" is supported.
NOTE 1: In this version of the specification, the NWDAF containing AnLF can
provide the accuracy information to an NF consumer that subscribes to the
analytics.
NOTE 2: When receiving a subscription from an NF service consumer that
includes the request for accuracy information, the analytics and/or the
accuracy information can be provided by NWDAF containing AnLF in one
notification or via different notifications.
NOTE 3: In this version of the specification, only subscribing or requesting
accuracy information without requesting analytics is not supported.
\- If the \"EneNA\" feature is supported and the target NWDAF notifies a
successful analytics subscription transfer, the old subscription ID which had
been allocated by the source NWDAF within the \"oldSubscriptionId\" attribute
and the resource URI of the Individual NWDAF Event Subscription resource
created by the target NWDAF within \"resourceUri\" attribute, and if the
\"PartialAnalyticsSubTransfer\" feature is supported and not all the analytics
events in the subscription transfer are accepted, the successful transferred
subscription event(s) within the \"transEvents\" attribute; and
\- an event subscription Id as \"subscriptionId\" attribute;
and may include:
a) the notification correlation identifier in the \"notifCorrId\" attribute,
if the \"EneNA\" feature is supported.
b) a cause for termination in the \"termCause\" attribute, if the
\"TermRequest\" feature is supported and the NWDAF wants to request the
termination of this subscription, i.e. to indicate that it will send no
further notifications for it.
If the feature \"EneNA\" is supported and the time when analytics information
is needed has been provided (via the \"timeAnaNeeded\" attribute within the
\"extraReportReq\" attribute) during the subscription for an event (via the
\"event\" attribute within the EventSubscription data type), if the time when
analytics information is needed is reached but the subscribed analytics
information is not ready, the consumer does not need to wait for the analytics
information any longer. In this case, the NWDAF may send an HTTP POST request
as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.2.4.2-1, which shall only provide (within the
EventNotification data type in the NnwdafEventsSubscriptionNotification data
type) an indication of the failure event via the \"event\" attribute and the
corresponding failure reason via a \"failNotifyCode\" attribute, and may also
provide a minimum time interval recommended by the NWDAF for the event via a
\"rvWaitTime\" attribute which will be used by the NF service consumer to
determine the time when analytics information is needed in similar future
analytics subscriptions.
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{notificationURI}\" as
Resource URI and NnwdafEventsSubscriptionNotification data structure as
request body, if the NF service consumer successfully processed and accepted
the received HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer shall:
\- store the notification; and
\- respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer
shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NF service consumer determines
the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer
shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6].
After the successful processing of the HTTP POST request, if the NWDAF
requests the NF service consumer to retrieve the data or analytics with the
\"fetchInstruct\" attribute, the NF service consumer may invoke the
Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Fetch service operation to retrieve the notified data or
analytics as defined in clause 4.4.2.5.
#### 4.2.2.5 Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer service operation
##### 4.2.2.5.1 General
The Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer service operation is used by an NWDAF
instance to request the transfer of analytics subscription(s) to another NWDAF
instance. If the source NWDAF discovers that the analytics consumer may change
concurrently to this procedure, the source NWDAF should not perform the
procedure. In such a case, the source NWDAF may send a message to indicate to
the analytics consumer that it will not serve this subscription anymore.
NOTE 1: To discover the possible change of analytics consumer, if the
Analytics ID is UE related, the source NWDAF takes actions responding to
external trigger (such as UE mobility), for example, checking if the Target of
Analytics Reporting is still within the serving area of the analytics
consumer, if the serving area information of the consumer is available.
NOTE 2: Handling of overload situation or preparation for a graceful shutdown
are preferably executed inside an NWDAF Set, when available, therefore, not
requiring an analytics subscription transfer as described in this clause.
##### 4.2.2.5.2 Creation of request for analytics subscription transfer
Figure 4.2.2.5.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF Service Consumer (e.g. NWDAF)
sends a request to the NWDAF to request the transfer of analytics
subscription(s) from the NF Service Consumer to the NF Service Producer (see
also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).
Figure 4.2.2.5.2-1: NF service consumer requests an analytics subscription
transfer
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer
service operation to request the transfer of analytics subscription(s). The NF
service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/transfers\" as Resource URI representing the
\"NWDAF Event Subscription Transfers\", as shown in figure 4.2.2.5.2-1, step
1, to create a request for an \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription Transfer\"
according to the information in the message body. The
AnalyticsSubscriptionsTransfer data structure provided in the request body
shall include:
\- information about the subscription(s) transfer request as
\"subsTransInfos\" attribute, which, for each subscription that is requested
to be transferred, shall include:
a) the type of the transfer request (i.e. if it is a request for transfer
preparation or transfer execution) in the \"transReqType\" attribute;
b) information about the analytics subscription in the \"nwdafEvSub\"
attribute, its contents being as defined for the NnwdafEventsSubscription data
structure in clause 4.2.2.2.2; and
c) the NF instance identifer of the consumer of the analytics subscription in
the \"consumerId\" attribute;
and may include:
a) analytics context identifier information about the context that is
available at the NF service consumer in the \"contextId\" attribute;
b) NF instance identifer(s) of active data source(s) the NF service consumer
is currently using for the analytics of this analytics subscription in the
\"sourceNfIds\" attribute;
c) NF set identifer(s) of active data source(s) the NF service consumer is
currently using for the analytics of this analytics subscription in the
\"sourceSetIds\" attribute;
d) information identifying the ML model(s) that the NF service consumer is
currently using for the analytics in the \"modelInfos\" attribute.
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/transfers\" as Resource URI and
AnalyticsSubscriptionsTransfer data structure as request body, in the
successful case the NWDAF shall:
\- if the \"transReqType\" attribute has the value PREPARE, perform the steps
required for the preparation of an analytics subscription transfer as
described in clause 5.4.3 of TS 29.552 [25], create a new Individual NWDAF
Event Subscription Transfer resource and send an HTTP \"201 Created\" response
with the URI for the created resource in the \"Location\" header field, as
shown in figure 4.2.2.5.2-1, step 2a; If the \"PartialAnalyticsSubTransfer\"
feature is supported and not all the analytics events in the subscription
transfer are accepted, then the NWDAF includes the \"failTransEventReports\"
attribute indicating the failure event(s).
\- if the \"transReqType\" attribute has the value TRANSFER, perform the steps
required for the execution of an analytics subscription transfer as described
in clause 5.4.2 of TS 29.552 [25],
a) if the \"PartialAnalyticsSubTransfer\" feature is not supported, or if the
\"PartialAnalyticsSubTransfer\" feature is supported and all the analytics
events in the subscription transfer are accepted, send an HTTP \"204 No
Content\" response, as shown in figure 4.2.2.5.2-1, step 2b;
b) if the \"PartialAnalyticsSubTransfer\" feature is supported and not all the
analytics events in the subscription transfer are accepted, the NWDAF creates
a new Individual NWDAF Event Subscription Transfer resource and sends an HTTP
\"201 Created\" response with the URI for the created resource in the
\"Location\" header field, as shown in figure 4.2.2.5.2-1, step 2a. The NWDAF
includes the \"failTransEventReports\" attribute indicating the failure
event(s), and then removes the Individual NWDAF Event Subscription Transfer
resource.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer
shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
##### 4.2.2.5.3 Update a request for analytics subscription transfer
Figure 4.2.2.5.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF Service Consumer (e.g. NWDAF)
sends a request to the NWDAF to update a request for the transfer of analytics
subscription(s) from the NF Service Consumer to the NF Service Producer (see
also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).
Figure 4.2.2.5.3-1: NF service consumer updates a request for an analytics
subscription transfer
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer
service operation to update a request for the transfer of analytics
subscription(s). The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with
\"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-eventssubscription/\/transfers/{transferId}\"
as Resource URI representing the \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription
Transfer\", as shown in figure 4.2.2.5.3-1, step 1, to update the \"Individual
NWDAF Event Subscription Transfer\" resource identified by the {transferId}.
The AnalyticsSubscriptionsTransfer data structure provided in the request body
shall include the same contents as described in clause 4.2.2.5.2.
Upon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/transfers/{transferId}\" as Resource URI and
AnalyticsSubscriptionsTransfer data structure as request body, the NWDAF
shall:
\- if the \"transReqType\" attribute has the value PREPARE, perform the steps
required for the preparation of an analytics subscription transfer as
described in clause 5.4.3 of TS 29.552 [25], update the Individual NWDAF Event
Subscription Transfer resource identified by \"transferId\",
a) if the \"PartialAnalyticsSubTransfer\" feature is not supported, or if the
\"PartialAnalyticsSubTransfer\" feature is supported and all the analytics
events in the subscription transfer are accepted, send an HTTP \"204 No
Content\" response, as shown in figure 4.2.2.5.3-1, step 2a;
b) if the \"PartialAnalyticsSubTransfer\" feature is supported and and not all
the analytics events in the subscription transfer are accepted, send an HTTP
\"200 OK\" response with the message body containing a representation of the
updated subscription transfer, as shown in figure 4.2.2.5.3-1, step 2b, and
the NWDAF includes the \"failTransEventReports\" attribute indicating the
failure event(s).
\- if the \"transReqType\" attribute has the value TRANSFER, perform the steps
required for the execution of an analytics subscription transfer as described
in clause 5.4.3 of TS 29.552 [25],
a) if the \"PartialAnalyticsSubTransfer\" feature is not supported, or if the
\"PartialAnalyticsSubTransfer\" feature is supported and all the analytics
events in the subscription transfer are accepted, remove the Individual NWDAF
Event Subscription Transfer resource identified by \"transferId\", and send an
HTTP \"204 No Content\" response, as shown in figure 4.2.2.5.3-1, step 2a;
b) if the \"PartialAnalyticsSubTransfer\" feature is supported and and not all
the analytics events in the subscription transfer are accepted, update the
Individual NWDAF Event Subscription Transfer resource identified by
\"transferId\", and send an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the message body
containing a representation of the updated subscription transfer, as shown in
figure 4.2.2.5.3-1, step 2b. The NWDAF includes the \"failTransEventReports\"
attribute indicating the failure event(s), and then removes the Individual
NWDAF Event Subscription Transfer resource.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP PUT request, the NWDAF shall send an
HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
If the NWDAF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected,
the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
##### 4.2.2.5.4 Cancel a request for analytics subscription transfer
Figure 4.2.2.5.4-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. NWDAF)
sends a request to the NWDAF to cancel a request for the transfer of analytics
subscription(s) from the NF service consumer to the NF Service Producer (see
also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).
Figure 4.2.2.5.4-1: NF service consumer cancels a request for an analytics
subscription transfer
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer
service operation to cancel a request for the transfer of analytics
subscription(s). The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request
with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-

Upon the reception of the HTTP GET request, the NWDAF shall:
\- analyse the requested analytic data according to the requested event.
If the HTTP request message from the NF service consumer is accepted, the
NWDAF shall respond with \"200 OK\" status code with the message body
containing the analytics with parameters as relevant for the requesting NF
service consumer. The AnalyticsData data structure in the response body shall
include:
\- analytics with the corresponding information as described in clause
4.2.2.4.2.
\- the analytics accuracy information in the \"accuInfo\" attribute, if the
feature \"AnalyticsAccuracy\" is supported and the analytics accuracy
requirement was requested in the \"accuReq\" attribute.
NOTE 12: In this version of the specification, NWDAF containing AnLF can
provide accuracy information to an NF consumer that requests both the
analytics and the accuracy information.
NOTE 13: When receiving a request from an NF consumer that includes a request
for accuracy information, the analytics and the accuracy information can be
provided by NWDAF containing AnLF within the single response.
If the requested NWDAF Analytics data does not exist, the NWDAF shall respond
with \"204 No Content\" status code.
If the \"timeAnaNeeded\" attribute within EventReportingRequirement is
provided during the request, if the time is reached but the requested
analytics information is not ready, the consumer does not need to wait for the
analytics information any longer, the NWDAF may send a \"500 Internal Server
Error\" status code to the NF service consumer. In addition, if the EneNA
feature is supported, the NWDAF may provide, within the
ProblemDetailsAnalyticsInfoRequestdata in the response, the corresponding
failure reason via a \"problemDetails\" attribute with the \"cause\" attribute
set to \"UNSATISFIED_REQUESTED_ANALYTICS_TIME\" and a minimum time interval
recommended by the NWDAF via a \"rvWaitTime\" attribute which is used by the
NF service consumer to determine the time when analytics information is needed
in similar future analytics requests.
If the analytics target period provided in the body of the HTTP GET request
includes the start time in the past and the end time in the future, the NWDAF
shall reject the request with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response including
the \"cause\" attribute set to \"BOTH_STAT_PRED_NOT_ALLOWED\".
If the statistics in the past are requested but the necessary data to perform
the service is unavailable, the NWDAF shall reject the request with an HTTP
\"500 Internal Server Error\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set
to \"UNAVAILABLE_DATA\".
If the user consent has not been checked by the NF service consumer and is
required for the requested analytics collection depending on local policy and
regulations, then the NWDAF shall check user consent for the targeted UE(s) by
retrieving the user consent subscription data via the Nudm_SDM service API of
the UDM as described in clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [23]. If the NWDAF
receive the response from the UDM that it is not granted for the impacted
user(s), then the NWDAF shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response
including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED\".
NOTE 13: When the target of reporting is a SUPI or a GPSI then the
subscription can be rejected, e.g. because user consent is not granted, and
the error is sent to the consumer. When the target of reporting is an Internal
Group Id, or a list of SUPIs/GPSI(s) or any UE, and the user consent is not
granted for a subset of the impacted users, then no error is sent, but a
subset of the SUPIs/GPSIs is skipped if user consent is not granted.
If an error occurs when processing the HTTP GET request, the NWDAF shall send
an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.2.7.
#### 4.3.2.3 Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransfer service operation
##### 4.3.2.3.1 General
The Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransfer service operation is used by an NF
service consumer to request and get context information related to analytics
subscriptions from the NWDAF.
##### 4.3.2.3.2 Request and get from NWDAF context of a subscription
Figure 4.3.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. NWDAF)
sends a request to the NWDAF to request and get from NWDAF context information
related to analytics subscriptions (see also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).
Figure 4.3.2.3.2-1: Requesting NWDAF context information related to analytics
subscriptions
The NF service consumer (e.g. NWDAF) shall invoke the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransfer service operation when requesting context
information related to analytics subscriptions. The NF service consumer shall
send an HTTP GET request on the resource URI \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
analyticsinfo/\/context\" representing the \"NWDAF Context\" (as
shown in figure 4.3.2.3.2-1, step 1), to request context information related
to analytics subscriptions according to the query parameter values of the
attributes \"context-ids\" and \"req-context\".
Upon the reception of the HTTP GET request, the NWDAF shall retrieve the
context information for the requested context identifiers.
If the HTTP request message from the NF service consumer is accepted, the
NWDAF shall respond with \"200 OK\" status code with the message body
containing the retrieved context information. The ContextData data structure
in the response body shall include for each of the context elements contained
in the \"contextElems\" attribute:
\- the context identifier that this context element refers to in the
\"contextId\" attribute, which indicates among others the analytics
subscription that this context element is associated with.

* * *
#### 4.4.2.2 Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation
##### 4.4.2.2.1 General
The Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation is used by an NF service
consumer to create or update a subscription for data notifications from the
NWDAF.
##### 4.4.2.2.2 Subscription for data notifications
Figure 4.4.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the NWDAF to subscribe for data notification(s).
Figure 4.4.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer subscribes to data notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe
service operation to subscribe to data notification(s). The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
datamanagement/\/subscriptions\" as Resource URI representing the
\"NWDAF Data Management Subscriptions\", as shown in figure 4.4.2.2.2-1, step
1, to create a subscription for an \"Individual NWDAF Data Management
Subscription\" according to the information in message body.
The NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure provided in the request body
shall include:
\- an URI where to receive the requested notifications as \"notificURI\"
attribute;
\- notification correlation identfier within the \"notifCorrId\" attribute;
and
\- one of the following:
\- analytics subscription information to be used to determine which data shall
be collected and reported within the \"anaSub\" attribute;
\- data subscription information within the \"dataSub\" attribute;
The NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure provided in the request body may
include:
\- the notification endpoints within the \"notifEndpoints\" attribute;
\- formatting instructions within the \"formatInstruct\" attribute;
\- processing instructions within the \"procInstruct\" attribute or the
\"multiProcInstructs\" attribute if the \"MultiProcessingInstruction\" feature
is supported;
\- one of the following identifiers related to the ADRF:
\- ADRF instance identifier within the \"adrfId\" attribute;
\- ADRF set identifier within the \"adrfSetId\" attribute;
\- one of the following target identifiers:
\- NF instance identifier within the \"targetNfId\" attribute;
\- NF set identifier within the \"targetNfSetId\" attribute;
\- time window of the occurrence of the requested data collection within the
\"timePeriod" attribute;
\- the purpose of data collection within the \"dataCollectPurposes\"
attribute.
\- the indication that the NF service consumer has already checked the user
consent within the \"checkedConsentInd\" attribute.
\- storage handling information within the \"storeHandl\" attribute, if the
\"EnhDataMgmt\" feature is supported.
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
datamanagement/\/subscriptions\" as Resource URI and
NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure as request body, the NWDAF shall use
the contents of the request to determine whether the subscription can already
be served or interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources are required. If
the NWDAF cannot use the contents of the request to determine this, the NWDAF
shall send an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error response including the \"cause\"
attribute set to \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\".
NOTE 1: The \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\" error can occur, for example, in
the case where the \"dataSub\" or \"anaSub\" attributes are provided, when the
request is syntactically valid and there is no NWDAF internal error, but the
NWDAF can neither find an existing subscription to a data source nor construct
one based on the received subscription contents.
If the user consent has not been checked by the NF service consumer and is
required for the requested data collection depending on local policy and
regulations, then the NWDAF shall check user consent for the targeted UE(s) by
retrieving the user consent subscription data via the Nudm_SDM service API of
the UDM as described in clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.503 [23]. If the NWDAF
receives the response from the UDM that it is not granted for the impacted
user(s), then the NWDAF shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" error response
including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED\".
NOTE 2: When the target of reporting is a SUPI or a GPSI then the subscription
can be rejected, e.g. because user consent is not granted, and the error is
sent to the consumer. When the target of reporting is an Internal Group Id, or
a list of SUPIs/GPSI(s) or any UE, and the user consent is not granted for a
subset of the impacted users, then no error is sent, but a subset of the
SUPIs/GPSIs is skipped if user consent is not granted.
If the NWDAF determines that the subscription can already be served (without
requiring further interactions with ADRF and/or data sources) or a successful
response from the ADRF and/or data sources is received for the creation or
modification of subscription(s) to serve this subscription, the NWDAF shall:
> \- create a new subscription;
>
> \- assign a subscriptionId;
>
> \- store the subscription.
If the NWDAF created an \"Individual NWDAF Data Management Subscription\"
resource, the NWDAF shall respond with \"201 Created\" with the message body
containing a representation of the created subscription, as shown in figure
4.4.2.2.2-1, step 2. The NWDAF shall include a Location HTTP header field. The
Location header field shall contain the URI of the created subscription i.e.
\"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
datamanagement/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\". If an immediate
reporting indication is provided in the subscription, the NWDAF shall include
the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST response
within the \"dataSub\" attribute, or, if the DataAnaCollect feature is
supported, potentially within the \"immReport\" attribute.
If the NWDAF receives storage handling information in the request but
determines (e.g. based on local policy) that a different storage approach
shall be followed, it indicates the determined storage approach to the
consumer by setting accordingly the \"storeHandl\" attribute (e.g. providing a
different lifetime, or setting the indication about deletion alerts to
\"false\") in the message body of the response. When more than one consumer
has requested storage lifetime for the same analytics, the storage approach
should be based on the longest requested storage lifetime.
NOTE 3: The default operator policy for how long analytics is to be stored can
be longer or shorter than the lifetime requested by the consumer. A default
operator policy can for example accept only consumer requested lifetimes that
are shorter or longer than the default policy.
When the notification flag of the \"dataSub\" attribute (e.g. the
\"notifFlag\" attribute within the \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute in the case of
AF events) is included and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the request, the NWDAF
shall mute the event notification and store the available events until the NF
service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the notification flag to
\"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer). When a
muting exception occurs, if the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported, the NWDAF
may consider the contents of the muting instructions of the \"dataSub\"
attribute (if provided; e.g. the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute within the
\"eventsRepInfo\" attribute in the case of AF events) and/or local
configuration to determine its actions.
If the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the NWDAF accepts the provided
notification flag and muting instructions, it may indicate the applied muting
notification settings in the response (e.g. within the \"mutingSetting\"
attribute in the case of AF events). If the NWDAF does not accept the provided
notification flag and muting instructions, it shall send an HTTP \"403
Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".
If an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the NWDAF shall send
an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.3.7.
##### 4.4.2.2.3 Update subscription for data notifications
Figure 4.4.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the NWDAF to update the subscription for data notifications.
Figure 4.4.2.2.3-1: NF service consumer updates subscription to data
notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe
service operation to update subscription to data notifications. The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
datamanagement/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI
representing the \"Individual NWDAF Data Management Subscription\", as shown
in figure 4.4.2.2.3-1, step 1, to update the subscription for an \"Individual
NWDAF Data Management Subscription\" resource identified by the
{subscriptionId}. The NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure provided in the
request body shall include the same contents as described in clause 4.4.2.2.2.
Upon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
datamanagement/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI
and NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure as request body, the NWDAF shall
use the contents of the request to determine whether the updated subscription
can already be served or interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources are
required. If the NWDAF cannot use the contents of the request to determine
this, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error response
including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\".
NOTE 1: The \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\" error can occur, for example, in
the case when the \"dataSub\" or \"anaSub\" attributes are provided, when the
request is syntactically valid and there is no NWDAF internal error, but the
NWDAF can neither find an existing subscription to a data source nor construct
one based on the received subscription contents.
If the NWDAF determines that the updated subscription can already be served
(without requiring further interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources) or
a successful response from the ADRF and/or data sources is received for the
creation or modification of subscription(s) to serve this subscription, the
NWDAF shall:
> \- update the subscription of corresponding subscriptionId; and
>
> \- store the subscription.
If the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP PUT
request, the NWDAF shall update an \"Individual NWDAF Data Management
Subscription\" resource, and shall respond with:
> a) HTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing a
> representation of the updated subscription, as shown in figure 4.4.2.2.3-1,
> step 2a; If an immediate reporting indication is provided in the request,
> the NWDAF shall include the reports of the events subscribed, if available,
> in the HTTP PUT response within the \"dataSub\" attribute, or, if the
> DataAnaCollect feature is supported, potentially within the \"immReport\"
> attribute; or
>
> b) HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, as shown in figure 4.4.2.2.3-1, step
> 2b.
If the NWDAF receives storage handling information in the request but
determines (e.g. based on local policy) that a different storage approach
shall be followed, it indicates the determined storage approach to the
consumer by setting accordingly the \"storeHandl\" attribute (e.g. providing a
different lifetime, or setting the indication about deletion alerts to
\"false\") in the message body of the response. When more than one consumer
has requested storage lifetime for the same analytics, the storage approach
should be based on the longest requested storage lifetime.
NOTE 2: The default operator policy for how long analytics is to be stored can
be longer or shorter than the lifetime requested by the consumer. A default
operator policy can for example accept only consumer requested lifetimes that
are shorter or longer than the default policy.
When the notification flag of the \"dataSub\" attribute (e.g. the
\"notifFlag\" attribute within the \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute in the case of
AF events) is included in the request with the value \"DEACTIVATE\", the NWDAF
shall mute the event notification and store the available events until the NF
service consumer requests to retrieve them by setting the notification flag
attribute to \"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full
buffer). When a muting exception occurs, if the EnhDataMgmt feature is
supported, the NWDAF may consider the contents of the muting instructions of
the \"dataSub\" attribute (if provided; e.g. the \"notifFlagInstruct\"
attribute within the \"eventsRepInfo\" attribute in the case of AF events)
and/or local configuration to determine its actions; if the notification flag
is set to the value \"RETRIEVAL\", the NWDAF shall send the stored events to
the NF service consumer, mute the event notification again and store available
events; if the notification flag is set to the value \"ACTIVATE\" and the
event notifications are muted (due to a previously received \"DECATIVATE\"
value), the NWDAF shall unmute the event notification, i.e. start sending
again notifications for available events.
If the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the NWDAF accepts the provided
notification flag and muting instructions, it may indicate the applied muting
notification settings in the response (e.g. within the \"mutingSetting\"
attribute in the case of AF events). If the NWDAF does not accept the provided
notification flag and muting instructions, it shall send an HTTP \"403
Forbidden\" error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".If errors occur when processing the HTTP PUT
request, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause
5.3.7.
If the NWDAF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected,
the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
#### 4.4.2.3 Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe service operation
##### 4.4.2.3.1 General
The Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe service operation is used by an NF
service consumer to remove a subscription for data notifications from the

request to the NWDAF to unsubscribe from data notifications.
Figure 4.4.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes from data notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe
service operation to unsubscribe from data notifications. The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
datamanagement/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI,
where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the identifier of the existing subscription that
is to be deleted.
Upon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request, if the NWDAF successfully
processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall:
\- remove the corresponding subscription;
\- respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall send
an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.3.7.

##### 4.5.2.2.1 General
The Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe service operation is used by an NF
service consumer to subscribe or update subscription for event notifications
from the NWDAF which contains Model Training Logical Function (MTLF).
##### 4.5.2.2.2 Subscription for event notifications
Figure 4.5.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the NWDAF to subscribe for event notification(s) (as shown in 3GPP
TS 23.288 [17]).
{width="6.026388888888889in" height="1.6409722222222223in"}
Figure 4.5.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer subscribes to notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe
service operation to subscribe to event notification(s). The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
mlmodelprovision/\/subscriptions\" as Resource URI representing
the \"NWDAF ML Model Provision Subscriptions\", as shown in figure
4.5.2.2.2-1, step 1, to create a subscription for an \"Individual NWDAF ML
Model Provision Subscription\" according to the information in message body.
The NwdafMLModelProvSubsc data structure provided in the request body shall
include:
\- an URI where to receive the requested notifications as the \"notifUri\"
attribute; and
\- a description of the subscribed events as the \"mLEventSubscs\" attribute
that, for each event, the MLEventSubscription data type shall include:
1) an event identifier as the \"mLEvent\" attribute; and
2) event filter information as the \"mLEventFilter\" attribute;
and may include:
1) an identification of target UE information as the \"tgtUe\" attribute;
2) a time interval during which the ML model shall be reported as the
\"mLTargetPeriod\" attribute;
3) the time when the subscription expired as the \"expiryTime\" attribute;
4) the ML model metric as the \"modelMetric\" attribute if the
\"FederatedLearning\" feature or the \"ModelProvisionExt\" feature is
supported;
5) a pre-determined status for the ML model or training as the
\"preDetStatus\" attribute if the \"FederatedLearning\" feature is supported;
and
6) the ML event reporting condition as the \"mlEvRepCon\" if the
\"FederatedLearning\" feature or the \"ModelProvisionExt\" feature is
supported.
7) the ML Model Interoperability Information as the \"modelInterInfo\"
attribute if the \"ModelSharing\" feature is supported; and
8) NF consumer information as the \"nfConsumerInfo\" attributed if the
\"ModelSharing\" feature is supported.
9) use case context as \"useCaseCxt\" attribute, if the \"ENAExt\" feature is
supported.
NOTE 1: The NWDAF containing MTLF can use the \"useCaseCxt\" attribute to
select the most relevant ML model, when several ML models are available for
the requested Analytics ID(s). The values of this parameter are not
standardized.
10) extended parameters for ML model provisioning as the \"modelProvExt\"
attribute, if the feature \"ModelProvisionExt\" is supported.
The NwdafMLModelProvSubsc data structure provided in the request body may
include:
\- a notification correlation identifier assigned by the NF service consumer
for the requested notifications as \"notifCorreId\" attribute; and
\- the reporting requirement information of the subscription as the
\"eventReq\" attribute.
For different event types, the filter information in \"mLEventFilter\"
attribute within the MLEventSubscription data type is the same as described in
clause 4.3.2.2.2 for the filter information contained in \"event-filter\"
attribute.
NOTE 2: The features described in clause 4.3.2.2.2 has no impact on this
service.
> Editor's Note: The type EventFilter includes attributes (and/or attributes
> within attributes) that have been introduced in Rel-18. For these
> attributes, the present API shall either define new features to indicate
> that the attributes are supported based on these features or it shall
> indicate that they are not applicable. This feature handing is FFS.
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
mlmodelprovision/\/subscriptions\" as Resource URI and
NwdafMLModelProvSubsc data structure as request body, the NWDAF shall create a
new subscription and store the subscription.
If the NWDAF created an \"Individual NWDAF ML Model Provision Subscription\"
resource, the NWDAF shall respond with \"201 Created\" with the message body
containing a representation of the created subscription, as shown in figure
4.5.2.2.2-1, step 2. The NWDAF shall include a Location HTTP header field. The
Location header field shall contain the URI of the created subscription i.e.
\"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
mlmodelprovision/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\".
If the immediate reporting indication in the \"immRep\" attribute within the
\"eventReq\" attribute sets to true during the event subscription, the NWDAF
shall include the reports of the subscribed events, if available, as the
\"mLEventNotifs\" attribute in the HTTP POST response.
If not all the requested events in the subscription are accepted, then the
NWDAF may include the \"failEventReports\" attribute indicating the event(s)
for which the subscription failed and the associated reason(s).
If there is no associated ML model available for all the listed \"mLEvent\"
attribute, the NWDAF which contains MTLF shall send a \"500 Internal Server
Error\" status code to the NF service consumer. Also, the corresponding
failure reason via a \"problemDetails\" attribute with the \"cause\" attribute
set to \"UNAVAILABLE_ML_MODEL_FOR_ALLEVENTS\".
When the \"notifFlag\" attribute within the \"eventReq\" attribute is included
and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the request, the NWDAF shall mute the event
notification and store the available events until the NF service consumer
requests to retrieve them by setting the \"notifFlag\" attribute to
\"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer). When a
muting exception occurs, if the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported, the NWDAF
may consider the contents of the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute within the
\"eventReq\" attribute (if provided) and/or local configuration to determine
its actions.
If the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the NWDAF accepts the muting
instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the \"notifFlagInstruct\"
attributes, it may indicate the applied muting notification settings within
the \"mutingSetting\" attribute in the response. If the NWDAF does not accept
the muting instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the
\"notifFlagInstruct\" attributes, it shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\"
error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".
If other errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NWDAF shall
send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.4.7.
##### 4.5.2.2.3 Update subscription for event notifications
Figure 4.5.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario that the NF service consumer sends an HTTP
PUT request to the NWDAF to modify an existing subscription (as shown in 3GPP
TS 23.288 [17]).
Figure 4.5.2.2.3-1: Modification of events subscription information using HTTP
PUT
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe
service operation to modify an existing ML Model subscription. The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
mlmodelprovision/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource
URI, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the event subscriptionId of the existing
subscription to be modified, to update an \"Individual NWDAF ML Model
Provision Subscription\" according to the information in the message body. The
NwdafMLModelProvSubsc data structure provided in the request body shall
include the same contents as described in clause 4.5.2.2.2.
Upon receipt of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
mlmodelprovision/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource
URI and NwdafMLModelProvSubsc data type as request body, if the request is
successfully processed and accepted, the NWDAF shall:
> \- modify the concerned subscription; and
>
> \- store the subscription.
>
> NOTE: The \"notifUri\" attribute within the NwdafMLModelProvSubsc data
> structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are sent
> to a new NF service consumer.
If the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP PUT
request, the NWDAF shall update an \"Individual NWDAF ML Model Provision
Subscription\" resource, and shall respond with:
> \- HTTP \"204 No Content\" response (as shown in figure 4.5.2.2.3-1, step
> 2a); or
>
> \- HTTP \"200 OK\" response (as shown in figure 4.5.2.2.3-1, step 2b) with a
> response body containing a representation of the updated subscription in the
> NwdafMLModelProvSubsc data type.
If not all the requested events in the subscription are modified successfully,
then the NWDAF may include the \"failEventReports\" attribute indicating the
event(s) for which the subscription failed and the associated reason(s).
When the \"notifFlag\" attribute within the \"eventReq\" attribute is included
in the request with the value \"DEACTIVATE\", the NWDAF shall mute the event
notification and store the available events until the NF service consumer
requests to retrieve them by setting the \"notifFlag\" attribute to
\"RETRIEVAL\" or until a muting exception occurs (e.g. full buffer). When a
muting exception occurs, if the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported, the NWDAF
may consider the contents of the \"notifFlagInstruct\" attribute within the
\"eventReq\" attribute (if provided) and/or local configuration to determine
its actions; if the \"notifFlag\" attribute is set to the value \"RETRIEVAL\",
the NWDAF shall send the stored events to the NF service consumer, mute the
event notification again and store available events; if the \"notifFlag\"
attribute is set to the value \"ACTIVATE\" and the event notifications are
muted (due to a previously received \"DECATIVATE\" value), the NWDAF shall
unmute the event notification, i.e. start sending again notifications for
available events.
If the EnhDataMgmt feature is supported and the NWDAF accepts the muting
instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the \"notifFlagInstruct\"
attributes, it may indicate the applied muting notification settings within
the \"mutingSetting\" attribute in the response. If the NWDAF does not accept
the muting instructions provided in the \"notifFlag\" and/or the
\"notifFlagInstruct\" attributes, it shall send an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\"
error response including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED\".
If other errors occur when processing the HTTP PUT request, the NWDAF shall
send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.4.7.
If the NWDAF determines that the received HTTP PUT request needs to be
redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in
clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
#### 4.5.2.3 Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Unsubscribe service operation
##### 4.5.2.3.1 General
The Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Unsubscribe service operation is used by an NF
service consumer to unsubscribe from event notifications.
##### 4.5.2.3.2 Unsubscribe from event notifications
Figure 4.5.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the NWDAF to unsubscribe from event notifications (see also 3GPP TS
23.288 [17]).
{width="6.026388888888889in" height="1.6458333333333333in"}
Figure 4.5.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes from notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_UnSubscribe
service operation to unsubscribe to event notifications. The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
mlmodelprovision/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource
URI, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the event subscriptionId of the existing
subscription that is to be deleted.
Upon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request, if the NWDAF successfully
processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall:
\- remove the corresponding subscription; and
\- respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.
If the NWDAF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be
redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in
clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
If errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall send
an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.4.7.
#### 4.5.2.4 Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation
##### 4.5.2.4.1 General
The Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation is used by an NWDAF to
notify NF consumers about subscribed events.
##### 4.5.2.4.2 Notification about subscribed event
Figure 4.5.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the NWDAF sends a request to the NF
Service Consumer to notify for event notifications (see also 3GPP TS 23.288
[17]).
Figure 4.5.2.4.2-1: NWDAF notifies the subscribed event
The NWDAF shall invoke the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation to
notify the subscribed event. The NWDAF shall send an HTTP POST request with
\"{notifUri}\" received in the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe service
operation as Resource URI, as shown in figure 4.2.2.4.2-1, step 1. The
NwdafMLModelProvNotif data structure provided in the request body that shall
include:
\- an event subscriptionId as \"subscriptionId\" attribute; and
\- description of the notified event as \"eventNotifs\" attribute, that for
each event, the MLEventNotif data type shall include an event identifier as
the \"event\" attribute, an address (e.g. a URL or an FQDN) of the ML model
file as the \"mLFileAddr\" attribute or (if the \"ModelProvisionExt\"feature
is supported) ADRF ID as the \"adrfId\" attribute or ADRF Set ID as the
\"adrfSetId\" attribute, and may include a notification correlation identifier
as \"notifCorreId\" attribute and a time period when the provided ML model
applies as the \"validityPeriod\" attribute and an area where the provided ML
model applies as the \"spatialValidity\" attribute and (if the
\"ModelProvisionExt\"feature is supported) Storage Transaction ID when the
ADRF (Set) ID (i.e. \"adrfId\" or \"adrfSetId\" attribute) is provided as the
\"storTransId\" attribute. If the feature \"ModelProvisionExt\" is supported,
may also include additional ML model information as \"addModelInfo\"
attribute.
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request, if the NF service consumer
successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP POST request, the NF
Service Consumer shall store the notification and respond with HTTP \"204 No
Content\" status code.
If the NF service consumer receives the ADRF ID as the \"adrfId\" attribute or
the ADRF Set ID as the \"adrfSetId\" attribute in the NwdafMLModelProvNotif
data structure of the HTTP POST request, it may invoke
Nadrf_MLModelManagement_RetrievalRequest service operation to retrieve ML
Model from the ADRF (Set) as specified in 3GPP TS 29.575 [27].
If the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to
be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as
specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
If errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NWDAF shall send an
HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.4.7.

request to the NWDAF to subscribe for event notification(s) (as shown in 3GPP
TS 23.288 [17]).
{width="6.026388888888889in" height="1.6381944444444445in"}
Figure 4.6.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer subscribes to notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining_Subscribe
service operation to subscribe to event notification(s). The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
mlmodeltraining/\/subscriptions\" as Resource URI representing the
\"NWDAF ML Model Training Subscriptions\", as shown in figure 4.6.2.2.2-1,
step 1, to create a subscription for an \"Individual NWDAF ML Model Training
Subscription\" according to the information in message body.
The NwdafMLModelTrainSubsc data structure provided in the request body shall
include:
\- an URI where to receive the requested notifications as the \"notifUri\"
attribute;
\- a description of the subscribed events as the \"mLEventSubscs\" attribute
that, for each event, the MLEventSubscription data type shall include:
> an event identifier as the \"mLEvent\" attribute and event filter
> information as the \"mLEventFilter\" attribute;
\- a notification correlation identifier assigned by the NF service consumer
for the requested notifications as \"notifCorreId\" attribute;
> and may include:
>
> \- an identification of UE information for which data for ML model training
> is requested as the \"tgtRepUe\" attribute;

> \- the round number of the training in a multi-round training process as the
> \"roundInd\" attribute;
\- the use case context of the ML model as the \"uCaseCont\" attribute; and
\- the reporting requirement information of the subscription as the
\"eventReq\" attribute.
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
mlmodeltraining/\/subscriptions\" as Resource URI and
NwdafMLModelTrainSubsc data structure as request body, the NWDAF shall create
a new subscription and store the subscription.
If the NWDAF created an \"Individual NWDAF ML Model Training Subscription\"
resource, the NWDAF shall respond with \"201 Created\" with the message body
containing a representation of the created subscription, as shown in figure
4.6.2.2.2-1, step 2. The NWDAF shall include a Location HTTP header field. The
Location header field shall contain the URI of the created subscription i.e.
\"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
mlmodeltraining/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\".
If the immediate reporting indication in the \"immRep\" attribute within the
\"eventReq\" attribute sets to \"true\" during the event subscription, the
NWDAF shall include the reports of the subscribed events, if available, as the
\"immReports\" attribute in the HTTP POST response.
NOTE: Immediate and one-time reporting can be used in order to implement the
Nnwdaf_MLModelTrainingInfo service, which is defined in 3GPP TS 23.288 [17].
If not all the requested events in the subscription are accepted, then the
NWDAF may include the \"failEventReports\" attribute indicating the event(s)
for which the subscription failed and the associated reason(s).
If there is no associated ML model training available for all provided
\"mLEvent\" attributes, the NWDAF shall send a \"500 Internal Server Error\"
status code to the NF service consumer, including the \"cause\" attribute set
to \"UNAVAILABLE_ML_MODEL_TRAINING_FOR_ALLEVENTS\".
If there is no ML model training satisfying the requirements listed in
\"mLModelTrainInfos\" attribute or the ML model cannot be downloaded
successfully, the NWDAF which contains MTLF shall send a \"403 Forbidden\"
status code to the NF service consumer, and it may send together with the
corresponding failure reason via a \"problemDetails\" attribute with the
\"cause\" attribute set to \"ML_MODEL_TRAINING_REQS_NOT_MET\".

### 5.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [13] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2
protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510
[12]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF service consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [12], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF service consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription service.
The Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API defines the following scopes for OAuth2
authorization as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [7], clause 4.x.
Table 5.1.9-1: OAuth2 scopes defined in Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API
* * *
Scope Description \"nnwdaf-eventssubscription\" Access to the
Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API \"nnwdaf-eventssubscription:transfer\" Access to
service operations applying to NWDAF event subscription transfer

### 5.2.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [13] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [12])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF service consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [12], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF service consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service.
The Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API defines the following scopes for OAuth2
authorization as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [7], clause 4.x.
Table 5.2.9-1: OAuth2 scopes defined in Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API
* * *
Scope Description \"nnwdaf-analyticsinfo\" Access to the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo
API \"nnwdaf-analyticsinfo:contexttransfer\" Access to service operations
applying to NWDAF context transfer related service operations, i.e.
ContextTransfer.

### 5.3.7 Error handling
#### 5.3.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of TS
29.500 [6].
For the Nnwdaf_DataManagement API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.8 of TS 29.501 [7]. Protocol errors and application
errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of TS 29.500 [6] shall be supported for an
HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as mandatory
for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of TS 29.500 [6]. In addition, the
requirements in the following clauses shall apply.
#### 5.3.7.2 Protocol Errors
In this Release of the specification, there are no additional protocol errors
applicable for the Nnwdaf_DataManagement API.
#### 5.3.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nnwdaf_DataManagement API are listed in
table 5.3.7.3-1.
Table 5.3.7.3-1: Application errors
* * *
Application Error HTTP status code Description SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED
400 Bad Request Indicates that the NWDAF cannot use the contents of the
request to either a) determine whether the subscription can already be served
or interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources are required or b) determine
what interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources are required (if it has
determined that they are required). USER_CONSENT_NOT_GRANTED 403 Forbidden
Indicates that the request shall be rejected because an impacted user has not
provided the required user consent. MUTING_INSTR_NOT_ACCEPTED 403 Forbidden
Indicates that the muting instructions received by the NF service consumer
cannot be accepted. NOTE: Including a \"ProblemDetails\" data structure with
the \"cause\" attribute in the HTTP response is optional unless explicitly
mandated in the service operation clauses.
* * *
### 5.3.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.3.8-1 are defined for the
Nnwdaf_DataManagement API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility
mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
Table 5.3.8-1: Supported Features
* * *
Feature number Feature Name Description 1 MultiProcessingInstruction Indicates
the support of multiple processing instructions. 2 UserConsent Indicates the
support of detailed handling of user consent, e.g. indications that user
consent has been checked and error responses related to the lack of user
consent. 3 DataAnaCollect This feature indicates support for the enhancement
of data and analytics collection. 4 EnhDataMgmt Indicates the support of
enhanced data management mechanisms. 5 UpEvents Indicates the support of UPF
events. 6 LocEvents Indicates the support of location events.
* * *
### 5.3.9 Security
As indicated in TS 33.501 [13] and TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_DataManagement API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see TS 29.510 [12]) plays
the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF service consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nnwdaf_DataManagement API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in TS 29.510 [12], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF service consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_DataManagement service.
The Nnwdaf_DataManagement API defines a single scope \"nnwdaf-datamanagement\"
for the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
## 5.4 Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision Service API
### 5.4.1 Introduction
The Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service shall use the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision API.
The API URI of the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision API shall be:
{apiRoot}/\/\
The request URIs used in each HTTP requests from the NF service consumer
towards the NWDAF shall have the Resource URI structure defined in clause
4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [7], i.e.:
> **{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [7].
\- The\ shall be \"nnwdaf-mlmodelprovision\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
5.4.3.
### 5.4.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 5.4.2.1 General
HTTP/2, IETF RFC 7540 [9], shall be used as specified in clause 5 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
The OpenAPI [11] specification of HTTP messages and content bodies for the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision is contained in Annex A.
#### 5.4.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 5.4.2.2.1 General
See clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6] for the usage of HTTP standard headers.
##### 5.4.2.2.2 Content type
JSON, IETF RFC 8259 [10], shall be used as content type of the HTTP bodies
specified in the present specification as specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6]. The use of the JSON format shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
\"Problem Details\" JSON object shall be used to indicate additional details
of the error in a HTTP response body and shall be signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 [15].
#### 5.4.2.3 HTTP custom headers
The Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service API shall support mandatory HTTP custom
header fields specified in clause 5.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6] and may
support HTTP custom header fields specified in clause 5.2.3.3 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6].
In this release of the specification, no specific custom headers are defined
for the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service API.
### 5.4.3 Resources

### 5.4.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [13] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [12])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, a n NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services
offered by the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [12], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service.
The Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision API defines a single scope \"nnwdaf-
mlmodelprovision\" for the entire service, and it does not define any
additional scopes at resource or operation level.
## 5.5 Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining Service API
### 5.5.1 Introduction

### 5.5.7 Error handling
#### 5.5.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6].
For the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [7].
Protocol errors and application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6] shall be supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP
status codes are specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table
5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
Protocol errors and application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6] for HTTP redirections shall be supported.
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses shall apply.
#### 5.5.7.2 Protocol Errors
In this Release of the specification, there are no additional protocol errors
applicable for the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining API.
#### 5.5.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining API are listed
in table 5.5.7.3-1.
Table 5.5.7.3-1: Application errors
* * *
Application Error HTTP status code Description
UNAVAILABLE_ML_MODEL_TRAINING_FOR_ALLEVENTS 500 Internal Server Error
Indicates the requested all events ML model training is unavailable.
ML_MODEL_TRAINING_REQS_NOT_MET 403 Forbidden Indicates the ML model training
requirements are not met. The \"ProblemDetails\" data structure shall contain
the attribute(s) that do not meet the ML model training requirements within
the \"invalidParams\" attribute. NOTE: Including a \"ProblemDetails\" data
structure with the \"cause\" attribute in the HTTP response is optional unless
explicitly mandated in the service operation clauses.
* * *
### 5.5.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.5.8-1 are defined for the
Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility
mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
Table 5.5.8-1: Supported Features
* * *
Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
### 5.5.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [13] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [12])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, a n NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services
offered by the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [12], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining service.
The Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining API defines a single scope \"nnwdaf-
mlmodeltraining\" for the entire service, and it does not define any
additional scopes at resource or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
The present Annex contains an OpenAPI [11] specification of HTTP messages and
content bodies used by the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription, the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo, Nnwdaf_DataManagement, Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision, and
Nnwdaf_MLModelTraining APIs.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
