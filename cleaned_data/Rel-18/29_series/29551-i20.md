_Table 4.2.1-1: Nnef_PFDmanagement Service Operations_
* * *
Service Operation Name Description Initiated by Nnef_PFDmanagement_Fetch
Provides the PFDs for application identifier(s) to the NF service consumer by
the full pull or partial pull. NF service consumer (e.g. SMF, NWDAF)
Nnef_PFDmanagement_Subscribe Allows NF service consumers to subscribe to
notifications on events when the PFDs for application identifier(s) change. NF
service consumer (e.g. SMF) Nnef_PFDmanagement_Notify Notifies NF service
consumers to update and/or delete the PFDs for application identifier(s) or
notifies NF service consumer to retrieve the PFDs for application
identifier(s). PFDF Nnef_PFDmanagement_Unsubscribe Allows NF service consumers
to unsubscribe from notifications on PFDs change events. NF service consumer
(e.g. SMF)
* * *
### 4.2.2 Nnef_PFDmanagement_Fetch Service Operation
#### 4.2.2.1 General
The Nnef_PFDmanagement_Fetch service operation provides means for the NF
service consumer to retrieve the PFDs for one or more application
identifier(s).
##### 4.2.2.1.1 When the NF service consumer is SMF
This service operation enables the NF service consumer to retrieve PFDs for an
Application Identifier(s) from the PFDF when:
\- a PCC rule with this application identifier is provided/activated by the
PCF and the PFDs provided by the PFDF are not available at the NF service
consumer; or
\- the caching timer for an application identifier elapses and a PCC rule for
this application identifier is still active.
When the NF service consumer removes the last PCC rule that refers to the
corresponding application identifier, or when the caching timer expires and no
PCC rule refers to the application identifier, the NF service consumer may
remove the PFD(s) related with the application identifier.
The PFDs retrieved from PFDF take precedence over any PFDs pre-configured in
the NF service consumer. If all PFDs retrieved from the PFDF are removed for
an application identifier, the pre-configured PFDs shall be applied again for
the application identifier.
The PFDF may provide caching time value via the \"cachingTime\" attribute or,
if the feature CachingTimer is supported, via the \"cachingTimer\" attribute,
together with the PFDs for an application identifier. The caching time value
retrieved from the PFDF takes precedence over the default caching time value
configured in the NF service consumer. If no caching time value is received
from the PFDF, the configured default caching time value shall be applied.
NOTE 1: The NF service consumer(s) and the PFDF(s) within an operator network
are configured with the same default caching time value to be applied for all
application identifiers.
NOTE 2: The configuration of a caching time value per application identifier
in the PFDF is based on the SLA between the operator and the ASP.
The following procedures using the Nnef_PFDmanagement_Fetch service operation
are supported:
\- Retrieval of PFDs by the full pull.
\- Retrieval of PFDs by the partial pull.
##### 4.2.2.1.2 When the NF service consumer is NWDAF
This service operation enables the NF service consumer to retrieve PFDs for
the known Application Identifier(s) from the PFDF.
The following procedure using the Nnef_PFDmanagement_Fetch service operation
is supported:
\- Retrieval of PFDs by the full pull.
#### 4.2.2.2 Retrieval of PFDs by the full pull
This procedure, as shown in Figure 4.2.2.2-1, is used to retrieve PFDs from
the PFDF by the full pull for requested application identifier(s).
Figure 4.2.2.2-1: Retrieval of PFDs by the full pull
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. SMF, NWDAF) shall send a GET request to the
resource representing the PFDs for the requested application identifier(s):
\- for PFDs of an individual application identifier, the request URI shall be
set to \"{apiRoot}/nnefâ€‘pfdmanagement/v1/applications/{appId}\" (as shown in
figure 4.2.2.2-1, step 1a); and
\- for PFD of a collection of application identifiers, the request URI shall
be set to \"{apiRoot}/nnefâ€‘pfdmanagement/v1/applications\" (as shown in figure
4.2.2.2-1, step 1b) with query parameters indicating the requested application
identifier(s).
2\. On success, an HTTP \"200 OK\" response shall be returned, with the
payload body containing a representation of an \"Individual application PFD\"
resource or a \"PFD of applications\" resource for the requested application
identifier(s). When the NF service consumer is SMF, it shall replace the
stored PFD(s) retrieved from the PFDF with the new received PFD(s) for the
requested application identifier(s). If the PFD(s) of one or more requested
application identifier(s) are not provided in the response, the NF service
consumer shall remove the PFD(s) of these requested application identifier(s)
and re-apply the pre-configured PFDs.\ \ If errors occur when processing the
HTTP GET request, the PFDF shall send an HTTP error response as specified in
clause 5.7. For \"404 Not Found\", when the NF service consumer is SMF, it
shall remove the PFD(s) of the requested application identifier(s) in the NF
service consumer and re-apply the pre-configured PFDs.
> If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the PFDF determines the received
> HTTP GET request needs to be redirected, the PFDF shall send an HTTP
> redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
#### 4.2.2.3 Retrieval of PFDs by the partial pull
This procedure, as shown in Figure 4.2.2.3-1, is used to retrieve PFDs from
the PFDF by the partial pull for requested application identifier(s) if the
\"PartialPull\" feature defined in clause 5.8 is supported both by NF service
consumer and PFDF.
Figure 4.2.2.3-1: Retrieval of PFDs by the partial pull
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. SMF) shall send an HTTP POST message to the
resource \"{apiRoot}/nnefâ€‘pfdmanagement/v1/applications/partialpull\". The NF
service consumer shall include one or more ApplicationForPfdRequest data
structure in the payload body of the HTTP POST. With the
ApplicationForPfdRequest data structure, the NF service consumer shall include
the application identifier within the \"applicationId\" attribute and the
timestamp of the PFDs received in the last provisioning for the application
identifier within the \"pfdTimestamp\" attribute. The NF service consumer may
also request full set of PFD(s) of an application identifier without including
the timestamp if it is not available.
2\. If the PFDF accepted the HTTP POST request, the PFDF shall send to the NF
service consumer:
\- the HTTP \"200 OK\" response (as shown in figure 4.2.2.3-1, step 2a)
including one or more PfdDataForApp data structure if the NF service consumer
requests the PFD(s) for an application identifier(s) without the timestamp or
if the NF service consumer requests PFD(s) for an application identifier(s)
with timestamp and the PFDF determines that corresponding PFD(s) is changed
since the last request based on the timestamp received in the request for the
application identifier. Within the PfdDataForApp data type, the PFDF shall
include the application identifier within the \"applicationId\" attribute, the
new timestamp within the \"pfdTimestamp\" attirbute, the \"partialFlag\"
attribute if applicable and create/update/remove the PFDs as follows:
> \- include the full list of the PFD(s) within the \"pfds\" attribute for the
> application identifier which is requested without the timestamp;
>
> \- include the full list of the PFD(s) within the \"pfds\" attribute for the
> application identifier if all the PFD(s) are changed for the application
> identifier since the last request based on the timestamp;
>
> \- for the application identifier whose PFD(s) are partially changed:
>
> \- include the new PFD(s) with new PFD identifier(s) within the \"pfds\"
> attribute if the new PFD(s) is added for the application identifier and the
> \"partialFlag\" attribute set to true;
>
> \- include the new PFD(s) with existing PFD identifier(s) within the
> \"pfds\" attribute if the existing PFD(s) is updated for the application
> identifier and the \"partialFlag\" attribute set to true;
>
> \- include the existing PFD identifier(s) without any content within the
> \"pfds\" attribute if the existing PFD(s) is removed for the application
> identifier and the \"partialFlag\" attribute set to true;
>
> \- not include the \"pfds\" attribute if the PFD(s) is removed for the
> application identifier.
NOTE 1: The PFDF does not include the PfdDataForApp data type for the
application identifier whose PFD(s) is not updated since last request.
NOTE 2 If the PFDF determines that the PFDs are changed since the last request
but cannot determine what changes have been applied to the individual PFD(s)
for an application identifier, the PFDF can include the full list of the
PFD(s) in the PfdDataForApp data type.
\- the HTTP \"204 No Content\" response (as shown in figure 4.2.2.3-1, step
2b) if the PFD(s) for all the requested application identifier(s) are not
changed since last request.
When the NF service consumer receives the response with \"200 OK\" status
code, the NF service consumer shall
\- remove the all existing PFD(s) (if available) and install all the new
provided PDF(s) for an application identifier if full list of PFD(s) is
received but \"partialFlag\" attribute is not received;
\- delete the existing PFD(s) for an application identifier(s) where no PFD(s)
is received;
\- for an application identifier(s) where the PFD(s) is provided and
\"partialFlag\" attribute is also provided and set to true:
\- install a new PFD(s) if the new PFD(s) with a new PFD identifier(s) is
received;
\- update an existing PFD(s) if a new PFD(s) with the same PFD identifier(s)
is received;
\- delete an existing PFD(s) if the same PFD identifier(s) without any content
is received;
\- reserve an existing PFD(s) if the PFD identifier(s) is not received.
### 4.2.3 Nnef_PFDmanagement_Subscribe Service Operation
#### 4.2.3.1 General
The Nnef_PFDmanagement_Subscribe service operation enables the NF service
consumer to subscribe to notifications on events when the PFDs for application
identifier(s) change.
The following procedures using the Nnef_PFDmanagement_Subscribe service
operation are supported:
\- Subscription for event notifications on PFDs change;
\- Subscription update for event notifications on PFD change.
#### 4.2.3.2 Subscription for event notifications on PFDs change
This procedure, as shown in Figure 4.2.3.2-1, is used to subscribe to
notifications on events when the PFDs for application identifier(s) change.
Figure 4.2.3.2-1: Creation of a subscription for event notifications on PFDs
change
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. SMF) shall send a POST request to the
request URI representing the collection of PFD subscriptions resource
\"{apiRoot}/nnefâ€‘pfdmanagement/v1/subscriptions\". The NF service consumer
shall include the PfdSubscription data type in the request payload body.
Within the PfdSubscription data type, the NF service consumer shall include:
\- an URI where to receive the requested notifications as \"notifyUri\"
attribute;
and may include:
\- subscribed application identifier(s) within the \"applicationIds\"
attribute.
2\. If the request is accepted, the PFDF shall:
\- create a new subscription;
\- assign a subscriptionId;
\- store the subscription; and
\- send an HTTP \"201 Created\" response, with the payload body containing a
representation of the created subscription, and the Location header containing
the resource URI of the created subscription \"{apiRoot}/nnef-
pfdmanagement/v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\".
Otherwise, one of the HTTP status codes listed in table 5.3.4.3.1-3 shall be
returned.
NOTE: The PFDs that have been provisioned to the PFDF before the NF service
consumer performs the subscription are not notified to the NF service consumer
as a result of this subscription, but the NF service consumer can retrieve
them before performing the subscription by invoking Nnef_PFDmanagement_Fetch
Service Operation.
#### 4.2.3.3 Subscription update for event notifications on PFDs change
This procedure, as shown in Figure 4.2.3.3-1, is used to update an existing
subscription to notifications on events when the PFDs for application
identifier(s) change.
Figure 4.2.3.3-1: Update of a subscription for event notifications on PFDs
change
1\. If the feature PfdChgSubsUpdate is supported, the NF service consumer
(e.g. SMF) shall send a PUT request to the resource URI representing the
targeted PFD subscription resource
\"{apiRoot}/nnefâ€‘pfdmanagement/v1/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\". The NF
service consumer shall include the PfdSubscription data type in the request
payload body. Within the PfdSubscription data type, the NF service consumer
shall include:
\- an URI where to receive the requested notifications as \"notifyUri\"
attribute;
and may include:
\- subscribed application identifier(s) within the \"applicationIds\"
attribute.
NOTE 1: The \"notifUri\" attribute within the PfdSubscription data structure
can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are sent to a new NF
service consumer.
2\. If the feature PfdChgSubsUpdate is supported and the request is accepted,
the PFDF shall:
\- update the subscription; and
\- send an HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the payload body containing a
representation of the updated subscription.
Otherwise, if errors occur when processing the HTTP PUT request, the PFDF
shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7. If the feature
\"ES3XX\" is supported, and the PFDF determines the received HTTP PUT request
needs to be redirected, the PFDF shall send an HTTP redirect response as
specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
NOTE 2: The PFDs that have been provisioned to the PFDF before the NF service
consumer performs the subscription are not notified to the NF service consumer
as a result of this subscription, but the NF service consumer can retrieve
them before performing the subscription by invoking Nnef_PFDmanagement_Fetch
Service Operation.
### 4.2.4 Nnef_PFDmanagement_Notify Service Operation
#### 4.2.4.1 General
The Nnef_PFDmanagement_Notify service operation notifies the NF service
consumer to update, delete or retrieve the PFDs for application identifier(s).
The following procedures using the Nnef_PFDmanagement_Notify service operation
are supported:
\- Notification of PFD change.
\- Notification PUSH
#### 4.2.4.2 Notification of PFD change
Figure 4.2.4.2-1: Notification of PFD change
1\. The PFDF shall send a POST request to the NF service consumer (e.g. SMF)
targeting the URI \"{notifyUri}, where {notifyUri} is the notification URI
provided during the creation or modification of the subscription resource as
specified in clause 4.2.3. The payload body of the POST request shall contain
one or more PfdChangeNotification data structure(s).
2 If the notification is accepted, the NF service consumer shall reply with:
\- \"204 No Content\" indicating the successful provisioning of all PFDs; or
\- \"200 OK\" and the payload body of the response shall contain
\"PfdChangeReport\" data structure with detailed information of failed
application(s).
Otherwise, if errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NF
service consumer shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NF service consumer determines
the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer
shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [5].
#### 4.2.4.3 Notification PUSH
Figure 4.2.4.3-1: Notification PUSH
1\. If the NotificationPush feature defined in clause 5.8 is supported, and
when the PFDF only notifies the NF service consumer to retrieve or remove the
PFDs for application identifier(s), then the PFDF shall send a POST request to
the NF service consumer (e.g. SMF) with \"{notifyUri}/notifypush\" as URI
(where the \"notifyUri\" was previously supplied by the NF service consumer)
and one or more NotificationPush data structure as request body. Each
NotificationPush data structure shall include the application identifier(s)
within the \"appIds\" attribute, the \"pfdOp\" attribute set to the applicable
value and may include the \"allowedDelay\" attribute containing the allowed
delay time if received when the \"pfdOp\" attribute is set to \"RETRIEVE\",
\"FULLPULL\" or \"PARTIALPULL\".
2 If the NF service consumer accepts the received POST request, the NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response.
> After the successful processing of the HTTP POST request,
\- if the PFDF requests the NF service consumer to retrieve the PFD(s) with
the \"pfdOp\" attribute set to the value \"RETRIEVE\" or without the \"pfdOp\"
attribute, the NF service consumer shall determine to invoke the full pull
procedure defined in clause 4.2.2.2 or invoke the partial pull procedure
defined in clause 4.2.2.3 if the \"PartialPull\" feature is supported to
retrieve the PFD(s) for the application identifier(s).
\- if the \"PartialPull\" feature is supported and if the PFDF requests the NF
service consumer to retrieve the PFD(s) with the \"pfdOp\" attribute set to
the value \"FULLPULL\", the NF service consumer shall invoke the full pull
procedure defined in clause 4.2.2.2.
\- if the \"PartialPull\" feature is supported and if the PFDF indicates the
NF service consumer to retrieve the PFD(s) with the \"pfdOp\" attribute set to
the value \"PARTIALPULL\", the NF service consumer may invoke the partial full
procedure defined in clause 4.2.2.3.
\- for all above cases, if the \"allowedDelay\" attribute is provided for one
or more application(s), the NF service consumer shall retrieve the PFD(s)
within the allowed delay time.
\- if the PFDF requests the NF service consumer to remove the PFD(s) with the
\"pfdOp\" attribute set to the value \"REMOVE\", the NF service consumer shall
remove the PFD(s) for the application identifier(s) and re-apply the pre-
configured PFDs.
> If errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NF service
> consumer shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7.
>
> If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NF service consumer
> determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF
> service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause
> 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
### 4.2.5 Nnef_PFDmanagement_Unsubscribe Service Operation
#### 4.2.5.1 General
The Nnef_PFDmanagement_Unsubscribe service operation is used by the NF service
consumer to unsubscribe from notifications on PFD change events.
The following procedures using the Nnef_PFDmanagement_Unsubscribe service
operation are supported:
\- Unsubscribe from event notifications on PFDs change.
#### 4.2.5.2 Unsubscribe from event notifications on PFDs change
Figure 4.2.5.2-1: Unsubscribe from event notifications on PFDs change
1\. The NF service consumer (e.g. SMF) shall send a DELETE request to the
resource URI representing the individual PFD subscription. The request body
shall be empty.
2\. If the request is accepted, an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response shall be
returned. The response body shall be empty.\ \ Otherwise, if errors occur when
processing the HTTP DELETE request, the PFDF consumer shall send an HTTP error
response as specified in clause 5.7. If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported,
and the PFDF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be
redirected, the PFDF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in
clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].

## 5.7 Error handling
### 5.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [5].
For the Nnef_PFDmanagement API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [6].
Protocol errors and application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [5] shall be supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP
status codes are specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table
5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses shall apply.
### 5.7.2 Protocol Errors
In this Release of the specification, there are no additional protocol errors
applicable for the Nnef_PFDmanagement API.
### 5.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nnef_PFDmanagement service are listed
in table 5.7.3-1.
Table 5.7.3-1: Application errors
* * *
Application Error HTTP status code Description SYSTEM_FAILURE 500 Internal
Server Error Something functions wrongly in PFD provisioning or the PFD
provisioning does not function at all. (NOTE) INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCE 500
Internal Server Error There is limitation for resource storage. (NOTE)
UNSPECIFIED_NF_FAILURE 500 Internal Server Error Unspecified reason. (NOTE)
NOTE: This application error is included in the responses to the POST request
of PFD change notification/Notification PUSH.
* * *
## 5.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.8-1 are defined for the Nnef_PFDmanagement
API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in
clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
Table 5.8-1: Supported Features
* * *
Feature number Feature Name Description 1 PartialUpdate The PFDF can use this
feature for partial update of PFDs. 2 DomainNameProtocol This feature supports
the additional protocol matching condition for the domain name in PFD data. 3
PfdChgSubsUpdate The NF service consumer can use this feature for updating the
PFD change subscription. 4 ES3XX Extended Support for 3xx redirections. This
feature indicates the support of redirection for any service operation,
according to Stateless NF procedures as specified in clauses 6.5.3.2 and
6.5.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5] and according to HTTP redirection principles for
indirect communication, as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5]. 5
PartialPull The NF service consumer can use this feature to retrieve the PFDs
by the partial update. 6 NotificationPush The PFDF can use this feature to
notify the NF service consumer to retrieve the PFDs. 7 CachingTimer The PFDF
and the NF service consumer can use this feature to support caching timer with
unit of duration second.
* * *
## 5.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [14] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [5], the access to the
Nnef_PFDmanagement API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see
IETF RFC 6749 [15]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [13])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF service consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nnef_PFDmanagement API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS
29.510 [13], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF service consumer used for
discovering the Nnef_PFDmanagement service.
The Nnef_PFDmanagement API defines a single scope \"nnef-pfdmanagement\" for
OAuth2 authorization (as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [14]) for the entire
service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or operation
level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
The present Annex contains an OpenAPI [9] specification of HTTP messages and
content bodies used by the Nnef_PFDmanagement API.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API.
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification file contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900
[17] and clause 5.3.1 of the 3GPP TS 29.501 [6] for further information).:
