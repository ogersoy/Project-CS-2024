# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

Nsmf_NIDD service.
#### 5.2.2.2 Delivery
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
The Delivery service operation shall be used to transfer NEF anchored MT data
for a given PDU session.
It is used in the following procedures:
\- NEF anchored Mobile Terminated Data Transport (see clause 4.25.5 of 3GPP TS
23.502 [3]).
The NF Service Consumer (i.e. NEF) shall deliver MT data to the SMF by using
the HTTP POST method (\"deliver\" custom operation) as shown in Figure
5.2.2.2.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.1-1: Transfer MT Data
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the URI of
\"deliver\" custom operation on an Individual PDU session resource in the SMF.
The payload body of the POST request shall contain the MT data to be
delivered.
NOTE: The URI of the individual PDU session resource is provided by SMF to the
NEF during SMF-NEF connection creation (see clause 5.2.2.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.541
[14]).
2a. On success, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.2.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body
may contain a DeliverError or ProblemDetails object, with the \"cause\"
attribute indicating the cause of the failure. If Estimated Maximum Waiting
Time is received from AMF, the SMF shall include it in the message body.

### 6.1.7 Error Handling
#### 6.1.7.1 General
For the Nsmf_NIDD API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as specified in
clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors and application errors
specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] shall be supported for an
HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as mandatory
for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Nsmf_NIDD API.
#### 6.1.7.2 Protocol Errors
No specific procedures for the Nsmf_NIDD service are specified.
#### 6.1.7.3 Application Errors
The common application errors defined in Table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]
may be used for the Nsmf_NIDD service.
The application errors defined for the Nsmf_NIDD service are listed in Table
6.1.7.3-1.
Table 6.1.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description

UE_NOT_REACHABLE 504 Gateway Timeout The UE is not reachable for the service.
### 6.1.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 6.1.8-1 are defined for the Nsmf_NIDD API. They
shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.1.8-1: Supported Features
Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
### 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nsmf_NIDD API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC
6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [10]) plays the role of
the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nsmf_NIDD API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server,
by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510
[10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nsmf_NIDD service.
The Nsmf_NIDD API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as specified in 3GPP
TS 33.501 [15]; it defines a single scope consisting on the name of the
service (i.e., \"nsmf-nidd\"), and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
### 6.1.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different SMF service instance, within
the same SMF or a different SMF of an SMF set, e.g. when an SMF service
instance is part of an SMF (service) set or when using indirect communications
(see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]).
An SCP that reselects a different SMF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new SMF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an SMF within an SMF set redirects a service request to a different SMF of
the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code,
the identity of the new SMF towards which the service request is redirected

###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the Nsmf_NIDD Service API. It
consists of OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications, in YAML format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository, that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1
and 3GPP TR 21.900 [7] clause 5B).
