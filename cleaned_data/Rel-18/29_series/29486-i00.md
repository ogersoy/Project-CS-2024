If errors occur when processing the HTTP POST or DELETE request, the VAE
Server shall apply error handling procedures as specified in clause 6.2.7.
The VAE server makes use of the xMB procedures as defined 3GPP TS 29.116 [19]
to create MBMS sessions whose type is set to \"files\" and to request the
delivery of files over these sessions. Before provisioning files to the BMâ€‘SC,
the VAE server prepares the file for distribution, which may include partition
of large files into smaller files or encryption.
The VAE server is responsible for translating the parameters related to the
V2X application triggering the file delivery into corresponding xMB
parameters. Table 5.3.2.2.2-1 describes the mapping between the
VAE_FileDistribution API attribute and the xMB API properties specified in
3GPP TS 29.116 [19].

# 7 Security
TLS shall be used to support the security communication between the VAE server
and the V2X application specific server over Vs interface, and also between
different VAE servers over VAE-E interface as specified in 3GPP TS 33.536 [31]
and 3GPP TS 33.501 [32]. The access to the VAE service APIs shall be
authorized by means of OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [23]), based on
local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant. If
OAuth2 is used, a client, prior to consuming services offered by the VAE
service APIs, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server.
# 8 Using Common API Framework
## 8.1 General
When CAPIF is used with a VAE service, the VAE server shall support the
following as defined in 3GPP TS 29.222 [26]:
\- the API exposing function and related APIs over CAPIF-2/2e and CAPIF-3/3e
reference points;
\- the API publishing function and related APIs over CAPIF-4/4e reference
point;
\- the API management function and related APIs over CAPIF-5/5e reference
point; and
\- at least one of the security methods for authentication and authorization,
and related security mechanisms.
In a centralized deployment as defined in 3GPP TS 23.222 [25], where the CAPIF
core function and API provider domain functions are co-located, the
interactions between the CAPIF core function and API provider domain functions
may be independent of CAPIF-3/3e, CAPIF-4/4e and CAPIF-5/5e reference points.
When CAPIF is used with a VAE service, the VAE server shall register all the
features for northbound APIs in the CAPIF Core Function.
## 8.2 Security
When CAPIF is used for external exposure, before invoking the API exposed by
the VAE server, the NF service consumer (e.g. V2X application specific server)
as API invoker shall negotiate the security method (PKI, TLS-PSK or OAUTH2)
with CAPIF core function and ensure the VAE server has enough credential to
authenticate the NF service consumer (e.g. V2X application specific server),
see 3GPP TS 29.222 [26], clause 5.6.2.2 and clause 6.2.2.2.
If PKI or TLS-PSK is used as the selected security method between the NF
service consumer (e.g. V2X application specific server) and the VAE server,
upon API invocation, the VAE server shall retrieve the authorization
information from the CAPIF core function as described in 3GPP TS 29.222 [26],
clause 5.6.2.4.
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.122 [27], the access to the VAE APIs may be
authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [23]), using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the CAPIF core function (see
3GPP TS 29.222 [TS29222]) plays the role of the authorization server.
NOTE 1: In this release, only \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant is
supported.
If OAuth2 is used as the selected security method between the NF service
consumer (e.g. V2X application specific server) and the VAE server, the the NF
service consumer (e.g. V2X application specific server), prior to consuming
services offered by the VAE APIs, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Obtain_Authorization service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.222 [26], clause 5.6.2.3.2.
The VAE APIs do not define any scopes for OAuth2 authorization. It is the VAE
server responsibility to check whether the NF service consumer (e.g. V2X
application specific server) is authorized to use an API based on the
\"token\". Once the VAE server verifies the \"token\", it shall check whether
the VAE server identifier in the \"token\" matches its own published
identifier, and whether the API name in the \"token\" matches its own
published API name. If those checks are passed, the NF service consumer (e.g.
V2X application specific server) has full authority to access any resource or
operation for the invoked API.
NOTE 2: For aforementioned security methods, the VAE server needs to apply
admission control according to access control policies after performing the
authorization checks.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex is based on the OpenAPI Specification [6] and provides
corresponding representations of all APIs defined in the present
specification.
NOTE 1: An OpenAPIs representation embeds JSON Schema representations of HTTP
message bodies.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE 2: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository, that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TS 21.900
