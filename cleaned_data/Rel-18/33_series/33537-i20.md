# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

specific to AAnF as described in TR 33.926 [3].
## 4.2 AAnF-specific adaptations of security functional requirements and
related test cases
### 4.2.1 Introduction {#introduction-2}
The present clause contains AAnF-specific security functional adaptations of
requirements and related test cases.
### 4.2.2 Security functional requirements on the AAnF deriving from 3GPP
specifications and related test cases
#### 4.2.2.0 General
The general approach in TS 33.117 [2] clause 4.2.2.1 and all the requirements
and test cases in TS 33.117 [2] clause 4.2.2.2 related to SBA/SBI aspects
apply to the AAnF network product class.
#### 4.2.2.1 AKMA key storage and update
_Requirement Name_ : AKMA key storage update
_Requirement Reference:_ TS 33.535 [4], clause 6.1
_Requirement Description_ : The AAnF stores the latest information sent by the
AUSF. After receiving the new generated A-KID and K~AKMA~, the AAnF deletes
the old A-KID and K~AKMA~ and stores the new generated A-KID and K~AKMA~ as
specified in TS 33.535 [4], clause 6.1.
_Threat References_ : TR 33.926 [3], Annex W.2.2.3, AKMA key storage and
update
_Test Case_ :
**Test Name:** TC_AKMA_Key_Storage_Update
**Purpose:**
Verify that the AAnF stores only the latest AKMA context received by the AUSF.
**Pre-Conditions:**
\- Test environment with AUSF and AF. The AUSF and the AF may be simulated.
\- AAnF network product is connected in emulated/real network environment.
**Execution Steps**
Test A:
1) Primary authentication is simulated for a specific UE, leading to the
simulated AUSF pushing SUPI, A-KID1, K~AKMA~1 to the AAnF.
2) The AF requests a K~AF~ from the AAnF by proving A-KID1 and AF_ID.
3) Another primary authentication is simulated for the same UE, leading to the
simulated AUSF pushing SUPI, A-KID2, K~AKMA~2 to the AAnF.
4) The AF requests a K~AF~ by providing A-KID1 to the AAnF.
5) The AF requests a K~AF~ by providing A-KID2 to the AAnF.
**Expected Results:**
The AF received an error message indicating the AKMA context related to A-KID
1 is not found after step 4). After step 5), the AF received a K~AF~ which is
different from the K~AF~ that received after step 2).
**Expected format of evidence:**
Evidence suitable for the interface, e.g., Screenshot containing the
operational results.
