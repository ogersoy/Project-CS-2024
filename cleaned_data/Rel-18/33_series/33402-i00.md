# 4 Overview of Security Architecture for non-3GPP Accesses to EPS
## 4.1 General
The following subclauses outline an overview of the security architecture for
trusted and untrusted non-3GPP accesses to connect to 3GPP EPS. It outlines
the needed security features to connect such a non-3GPP access to the 3GPP
EPS. Non-3GPP access specific security is outside the scope of the present
document.
Figure 4.1-1 gives an overview of the security architecture of a typical
non-3GPP access while connected to the 3GPP EPC.
Figure 4.1-1: Security Architecture of Non-3GPP Access and 3GPP EPS
NOTE: USIM applies in case of terminal with 3GPP access capabilities, cf.
clause 6.1.
Five security feature groups are defined. Each of these feature groups
accomplishes certain security objectives:
**\- Network access security (I):** the set of security features that provide
users with secure access to services while terminated at 3GPP EPC. Radio
Access protection is a non-3GPP access specific and outside the scope of the
present document.
**\- Network domain security (II):** the set of security features that enable
nodes to securely exchange signaling data, and protect against attacks on the
wireline network.
**\- Non-3GPP domain security (III):** the set of security features are a
non-3GPP access specific and outside the scope of the present document.
**\- Application domain security (IV):** the set of security features that
enable applications in the user and in the provider domain to securely
exchange messages.
\- **User domain security (V)** : the set of security features that secure
access to the mobile station. If the terminal does not support 3GPP access
capabilities, 3GPP does not specify how user domain security is achieved.
## 4.2 Trusted non-3GPP Access
As defined in clause 4.3.1.2 of TS 23.402[5] it is the home operator policy
decision if a non-3GPP access network is treated as trusted non-3GPP access
network.When all of the security feature groups provided by the non-3GPP
access network are considered sufficiently secure by the home operator, the
non-3GPP access may be identified as a trusted non-3GPP access for that
operator. However, this policy decision may additionally be based on reasons
not related to security feature groups.
NOTE: It is specified in clause 6.1 of the current specification how the UE
gets the operator policy and how it will behave accordingly
## 4.3 Untrusted non-3GPP Access
As defined in clause 4.3.1.2 of TS 23.402[5] it is the home operator policy
decision if a non-3GPP access network is treated as untrusted non-3GPP access
network. When one or more of the security feature groups provided by the
non-3GPP access network are considered not sufficiently secure by the home
operator, the non-3GPP access may be identified as an untrusted non-3GPP
access for that operator. However, this policy decision may additionally be
based on reasons not related to security feature groups.
NOTE: It is specified in clause 6.1 of the current specification how the UE
gets the operator policy and how it will behave accordingly.
# 5 Security Features Provided by EPS for non-3GPP Accesses
## 5.1 User-to-Network security
### 5.1.1 User identity and device identity confidentiality
User identity confidentiality for procedures between the UE and the Evolved
Packet Core is provided as defined in clauses 6, 8 and 9 of the present
document.
The protection of user identity confidentiality at the non-3GPP access network
level is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.
Device identity confidentiality is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.
### 5.1.2 Entity authentication
Entity authentication is provided as defined in clauses 6, 8 and 9 of the
present document.

used,
The establishment of security contexts for user data and signaling data
confidentiality between the UE and an entity in a non-3GPP access network is
defined in clause 7 of the present document. The detailed definition of the
corresponding confidentiality mechanisms is, however, outside the scope of
3GPP specifications.
Signaling data confidentiality between an entity in the non-3GPP access
network and an entity in the Evolved Packet Core, or between two entities in
the Evolved Packet Core, is provided as defined in clause 11 (Network Domain
Security) of the present document.
User data and signaling data confidentiality between two entities in a
non-3GPP access network is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.
## 5.3 User data and signalling data integrity
Signaling data integrity between the UE and an entity in the Evolved Packet
Core is provided as defined in clauses 6, 8 and 9 of the present document.
Optionally, user data integrity between the UE and the PDN GW is provided as
defined in clause 9.2.2 of the present document when DS-MIPv6 is used,
The establishment of security contexts for user data and signaling data
integrity between the UE and an entity in a non-3GPP access network is defined
in clause 7 of the present document. The detailed definition of the
corresponding integrity mechanisms is, however, outside the scope of 3GPP
specifications.
Signaling data integrity between an entity in the non-3GPP access network and
an entity in the Evolved Packet Core, or between two entities in the Evolved
Packet Core, is provided as defined in clause 11 (Network Domain Security) of
the present document.
User data and signaling data integrity between two entities in a non-3GPP
access network is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.
# 6 Authentication and key agreement procedures
## 6.1 General
Access authentication for non-3GPP access in EPS shall be based on EAP-AKA
(RFC 4187 [7]) or on EAP-AKA\' (RFC 5448 [23]).
NOTE: It follows from the preceding sentence in particular that access
authentication for non-3GPP access in EPS using EAP-SIM is not allowed.
The EAP server for EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA\' shall be the 3GPP AAA server residing
in the EPC.
The UE and 3GPP AAA server shall implement both EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA\'. It is
specified in this specification in which cases EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA\'
respectively shall be used.
If the terminal supports 3GPP access capabilities, the credentials used with
EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA\' shall reside on the UICC.
If the terminal does not support 3GPP access capabilities, 3GPP does not
specify where the credentials used with EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA\' reside.
NOTE: EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA\' may use the same credentials.
The procedure in clause 6.2 shall be performed whenever the procedure in
clause 8 of the present document is not performed with the following
exception:
  * if the security procedure in clause 9.2.2.2 for DS-MIPv6 is performed over a trusted access network and
  * if the trusted access network has the properties listed in clause 9.2.2.1
then the procedure in clause 6.2 may be skipped.
However, it is recommended to use the procedure in clause 6.2 unless another
strong authentication and key establishment method is used, which is
documented in a standard covering the non-3GPP access network.
NOTE 1: There are cases when the procedure in clause 6.2 cannot be performed
due to lack of support for EAP in the access network. DSL-based access
networks are examples of such access networks.
In cases where it is difficult to assess whether a given access network has
the properties listed in clauses 9.2.2.1 and 9.3.1.2, it is strongly
recommended to use the procedures for untrusted access in clause 8.
The HSS shall send an authentication vector with AMF separation bit = 1 (cf.
TS 33.401 [16]) to a 3GPP AAA server as specified for the EAP-AKA\' procedures
defined in the present document. For authentication vectors with the
\"separation bit\" set to 1, the secret keys CK and IK generated during AKA
shall never leave the HSS, and shall not be used in a non-EPS context.
The non-3GPP access networks, which are trusted, can be pre-configured in the
UE. The UE can e.g. have a list with non-3GPP access technologies, or access
networks, or serving network operators that allow procedures for trusted
non-3GPP IP access. Additionally, during 3GPP-based access authentication the
UE may receive an indication whether the non-3GPP IP access is trusted or not.
If such an indication is sent it shall be sent by the 3GPP AAA server as part
of an EAP-AKA or EAP-AKA\' request. If no such indication is received by the
UE, and there is no pre-configured information in the UE, the UE shall
consider the non-3GPP IP access as untrusted. In case of pre-configured
information and indication received as part of an EAP-AKA or EAP-AKA\' request
are in conflict, the received indication shall take precedence.
NOTE 2: The protection mechanisms of EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA\' prevent that an
indication sent as part of an EAP-AKA request could be forged.
Additionally, in roaming situations the visited 3GPP network may send an
indication about the trust status of the non-3GPP access network to the 3GPP
AAA server. The 3GPP AAA server may take this indication from the visited
network into account in its decision about sending a trust indication to the
UE.
EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA' use pseudonyms and re-authentication identities.
Pseudonyms and re-authentication identities should be generated using the
method defined in clause 14 of the current specification.
NOTE 3: When using the method in clause 14 for the generation of pseudonyms
and re-authentication identities the AAA server can resolve these identities
without having to store them. In particular, they can be resolved even when
the UE is not registered.
NOTE 4: Clause 14 defines Temporary Identities such that the leading six bits
form the Temporary Identity Tag. This tag is converted to a printable
character using the BASE64 method, according to clause 14. Compatibility with
the NAI format defined in TS 23.003 [8] is achieved by choosing the temporary
identity tag such that the printable character equals the leading digit for
the NAI defined in TS 23.003.
The authentication and authorization of the UE\'s access over S2b to external
networks from non-3GPP access networks can be based on PAP and CHAP procedures
as specified further down in the present document. The corresponding
procedures for DS-MIPv6 are given in TS 24.303 [20].
## 6.2 Authentication and key agreement for trusted access
**Figure 6.2-1: Non-3GPP Access Authentication**
EAP-AKA\' as defined in RFC 5448 [23] shall be used for mutual authentication
and key agreement.
1\. A connection is established between the UE and the trusted non-3GPP access
network, using a procedure specific to the non-3GPP access network (which is
out of scope for the present document).
2\. The authenticator in the trusted non-3GPP access network sends an EAP
Request/Identity to the UE.
NOTE 1: EAP packets are transported over this access network using a protocol
specific to this access network (which is out of scope for the present
document).
3\. The UE sends an EAP Response/Identity message. The UE shall send its
identity complying with Network Access Identifier (NAI) format specified in TS
23.003 [8]. NAI contains either a pseudonym allocated to the UE in a previous
run of the authentication procedure or, in the case of first authentication,
the IMSI. In the case of first authentication, the NAI shall indicate EAP-
AKA\' as specified in TS 23.003 [8].
4\. The message is routed towards the proper 3GPP AAA Server based on the
realm part of the NAI as specified in TS 23.003 [8]. The routing path may
include one or several AAA proxies. The access type and the identity of the
access network in which the authenticator resides, shall be included by the
authenticator in the Diameter message. In the case of roaming, the visited
network AAA proxy shall also include the visited network identifier in the
same Diameter message.\ The access network identity is defined separately for
each access network type. For each access network type, the access network
identity is documented in TS 24.302 [22] to ensure that UE and HSS use the
same access network identities as input for key derivation.
NOTE 2: Diameter referral can also be applied to find the AAA server.
NOTE 3: The visited network identifier identifies a visited 3GPP network, and
is to be distinguished from the access network identifier, which relates to a
non-3GPP access network.
5\. The 3GPP AAA Server receives the EAP Response/Identity message that
contains the subscriber identity and the access type over the STa/SWd
interface. In the case of roaming, the 3GPP AAA server also receives the
visited network identifier in the same Diameter message that carried the EAP
Response/Identity message.
6\. The 3GPP AAA Server requests again the user identity, using the EAP
Request/AKA\' Identity message. This identity request is performed as the
intermediate nodes may have changed or replaced the user identity received in
the EAP Response Identity message, as specified in RFC 5448 [23]. However, in
order to avoid this new request of the user identity, the home operator should
ensure that the Authenticator and all AAA entities between the EAP peer and
EAP server process the EAP-Response/Identity message inline with EAP-AKA\' as
specified in the present document and TS 23.003. Consequently, if the EAP
server knows that the EAP-Response/Identity message was processed accordingly,
the EAP server shall use the user identity which was received in the EAP-
Response/Identity message in step 5 and skip this EAP Request/AKA\' Identity
request in steps 6 through 9.
7\. The authenticator in the access network forwards the EAP Request/AKA\'
Identity message to the UE.
8\. The UE responds with an identity that depends on the parameters contained
in the EAP Request/AKA\' Identity message; for details cf. TS 24.302 [22].
9\. The authenticator in the access network forwards the EAP Response/AKA\'
Identity to the 3GPP AAA Server. The access type and the identity of the
access network in which the authenticator resides, shall be included by the
authenticator in this message. In the case of roaming, the visited network AAA
proxy shall also include the visited network identifier in the same
message.The identity received in this message will be used by the 3GPP AAA
Server in the rest of the authentication process.
10\. The 3GPP AAA Server shall identify the subscriber as a candidate for
authentication with EAP-AKA', based on the received identity in the EAP-
Response/Identity or EAP Response/AKA\' Identity message. If the leading
digits in the NAI do not indicate that the UE supports EAP-AKA', the 3GPP AAA
server shall abort the authentication. If the UE does indicate that it
supports EAP-AKA', the 3GPP AAA server then checks whether it has an unused
authentication vector with AMF separation bit = 1 and the matching access
network identifier available for that subscriber. If not, a set of new
authentication vectors is retrieved from HSS. The 3GPP AAA server includes an
indication that the authentication vector is for EAP-AKA\', as defined RFC
5448 [23], and the identity of the access network in which the authenticator
resides in a message sent to the HSS. A mapping from the temporary identifier
(pseudonym in the sense of RFC 4187 EAP-AKA [7]) to the IMSI is required.
NOTE 7a: As the UE moves around the access network identifier may change. But
an authentication vector stored in the 3GPP AAA server can only be used if it
is associated with the access network identifier of the current access
network. This may make stored authentication vectors unusable. Furthermore, as
the 3GPP AAA server resides in the home network there is no significant
performance advantage in fetching batches of authentication vectors. It is
therefore recommended that the 3GPP AAA server fetches only one authentication
vector at a time.
> Upon receiving from the 3GPP AAA server an indication that the
> authentication vector is for EAP-AKA\' as defined in RFC 5448 [23], the HSS
> generates an authentication vector with AMF separation bit = 1\. The HSS
> then transforms this authentication vector into a new authentication vector
> by computing\ CK\' and IK\' per Clauses A.1 and A.2 of the Normative Annex A
> with \ being one of the input parameters. The HSS
> then sends this transformed authentication vector to the 3GPP AAA server.
NOTE 7b: The 3GPP AAA server does not notice the transformation and treats
this authentication vector like any other authentication vector.
> The HSS and/or 3GPP AAA server need to ensure, based on local policy, that
> the non-3GPP access requesting the authentication data, which is identified
> by the information transmitted by the authenticator in step 4, is authorized
> to use the access network identity used to calculate CK\' and IK\'. The 3GPP
> AAA server shall have assurance of the origin of this information. The exact
> details of how to achieve this are not covered in this specification.
The HSS shall check if there is a 3GPP AAA Server already registered to serve
for this subscriber. In case the HSS detects that another 3GPP AAA Server has
already registered for this subscriber, it shall provide the current 3GPP AAA
Server with the previously registered 3GPP AAA Server address. The
authentication signalling is then routed to the previously registered 3GPP AAA
Server with Diameter-specific mechanisms, e.g., the current 3GPP AAA Server
transfers the previously registered 3GPP AAA Server address to the 3GPP AAA
proxy or the AAA entity in the trusted non-3GPP access network, or the current
3GPP AAA Server acts as a AAA proxy and forwards the authentication message to
the previously registered 3GPP AAA Server.
11\. Void.
NOTE 8: Void.
12\. New keying materials MSK and EMSK are derived from CK\' and IK\'
according to RFC 5448 [23].
NOTE 9: The use of EMSK can refer to subclause 9.2.1 MIPv4.
A new pseudonym and/or re-authentication ID may be chosen and if chosen they
shall be protected (i.e. encrypted and integrity protected) using keying
material generated from EAP-AKA'.
13\. The 3GPP AAA Server sends RAND, AUTN, a message authentication code (MAC)
and two user identities (if they are generated), protected pseudonym and/or
protected re-authentication id, to the authenticator in the access network in
EAP Request/AKA\'-Challenge message. The 3GPP AAA Server shall also include
the access network identity in this message. The access network identity is
defined in TS 24.302 [22]. The sending of the re-authentication id depends on
3GPP operator\'s policies on whether to allow fast re-authentication processes
or not. It implies that, at any time, the 3GPP AAA Server decides (based on
policies set by the operator) to include the re-authentication id or not, thus
allowing or disallowing the triggering of the fast re-authentication process.
The 3GPP AAA Server may send as well a result indication to the authenticator
in the access network, in order to indicate that it wishes to protect the
success result message at the end of the process (if the outcome is
successful). The protection of result messages depends on home operator\'s
policies.
14\. The authenticator in the access network sends the EAP
Request/AKA'-Challenge message to the UE.
15\. The UE first checks whether the AMF separation bit is set to 1. If this
is not the case the UE shall reject the authentication. Otherwise, the UE runs
AKA algorithms. The UE verifies that AUTN is correct and hereby authenticates
the network. If AUTN is incorrect, the UE rejects the authentication (not
shown in this example). If the sequence number is out of synch, the UE
initiates a synchronization procedure, c.f. RFC 5448 [23]. If AUTN is correct,
the UE computes RES, IK and CK.
The UE then computes CK\' and IK\' in the same way as the HSS, per Clauses A.1
and A.2 of the Normative Annex A with \ being one of
the input parameters. The UE derives required additional new keying material,
including the key MSK and EMSK, according to RFC 5448 [23] from the new
computed CK\', IK\' and checks the received MAC with the new derived keying
material.
If a protected pseudonym and/or re-authentication identity were received, then
the UE stores the temporary identity(s) for future authentications.
> The access network identity, which is input to key derivation to obtain CK',
> IK', shall be sent by the 3GPP AAA server in the EAP-request /
> AKA'-Challenge message as defined in RFC 5448 [23].
>
> RFC 5448 [23] specifies a possibility for the UE to compare the access
> network identity received from the 3GPP AAA server with the access network
> identity received locally, e.g. from the link layer. It is defined in 3GPP
> TS 24.302 [22] for which access networks the comparison is done, how the UE

16\. The UE calculates a new MAC value covering the EAP message with the new
keying material. UE sends EAP Response/AKA\'-Challenge containing calculated
RES and the new calculated MAC value to the authenticator in the access
network.
The UE shall include in this message the result indication if it supports such
indications and if it received the same indication from the 3GPP AAA Server.
Otherwise, the UE shall omit this indication.
17\. The authenticator in the access network sends the EAP
Response/AKA\'-Challenge packet to 3GPP AAA Server.
18\. The 3GPP AAA Server checks the received MAC and compares XRES to the
received RES.
19\. If all checks in step 18 are successful, the 3GPP AAA Server shall send
the message EAP Request/AKA\'-Notification, previous to the EAP Success
message, if the 3GPP AAA Server and the UE have indicated the use of protected
successful result indications as in RFC 5448 [23]. This message is MAC
protected.
NOTE 11: Steps 19 to 22 are conditional based on the EAP Server and the UE
having indicated the use of protected successful result indications.
20\. The authenticator in the access network forwards the message to the UE.
21\. The UE sends the EAP Response/AKA\'-Notification.
22\. The authenticator in the access network forwards the EAP
Response/AKA\'-Notification message to the 3GPP AAA Server. The 3GPP AAA
Server shall ignore the contents of this message
22A. The 3GPP AAA Server shall initiate the Subscriber Profile Retrieval and
3GPP AAA Server registration to the HSS. The 3GPP AAA Server shall keep access
session information related to the subscriber including the access network
identity. The 3GPP AAA Server shall implement a policy to limit the number of
active access sessions.
23\. The 3GPP AAA Server sends the EAP Success message to the authenticator in
the access network (perhaps preceded by an EAP Notification, as explained in
step 19). The 3GPP AAA Server also includes the key MSK, RFC 5448 [23], in the
underlying AAA protocol message (i.e. not at the EAP level). The authenticator
in the access network stores the keying material to be used in communication
with the authenticated UE as required by the access network.
24\. The authenticator in the access network informs the UE about the
successful authentication with the EAP Success message. Now the EAP AKA\'
exchange has been successfully completed, and the UE and the authenticator in
the access network share keying material derived during that exchange.
25.Void.
NOTE 12: It may happen in handover situations that, due to pre-registration, a
subscriber is authenticated in a target access network while still being
attached to the source access network.
NOTE 13: Void.
The authentication process may fail at any moment, for example because of
unsuccessful checking of MACs or no response from the UE after a network
request. In that case, the EAP AKA\' process will be terminated as specified
in RFC 5448 [23] and an indication shall be sent to HSS.
## 6.3 Fast re-authentication procedure for trusted access
Fast re-authentication for EAP-AKA\' is specified in RFC 5448 [23]. Fast re-
authentication re-uses keys derived on the previous full authentication. Fast
re-authentication does not involve the HSS nor the credentials used with EAP-
AKA' (e.g USIM application in case of terminal with 3GPP access capabilities),
and does not involve the handling of AKA authentication vectors, which makes
the procedure faster and reduces the load on the HSS and, in particular, the
Authentication Centre.
UE and 3GPP AAA server shall implement fast re-authentication for EAP-AKA\'.
Its use is optional and depends on operator policy. If fast re-authentication
for EAP-AKA\' is used the 3GPP AAA server shall indicate this to the UE by
means of sending the re-authentication identity to the UE as in step 13 of
subclause 6.2.
The security level of fast re-authentication for EAP-AKA\' is lower as it does
not prove the presence of the credentials used with EAP-AKA' (e.g. presence of
USIM application in case of terminal with 3GPP access capabilities) on the
user side. The operator should take this into account when defining the policy
on fast re-authentication.
Fast re-authentications for EAP-AKA\' generates new keys MSK, which may be
used for renewing session key used for protection in the non-3GPP access
network.
The access network identity shall not change when going from the full to the
fast re-authentication process. If this happens, the re-authentication process
shall be terminated as defined in RFC 5448 [23].
In this section it is described how the process works for trusted non-3GPP
access to EPS.
Figure 6.3-1: Non-3GPP Fast Re-authentication
1) Non-3GPP Access Network sends an EAP Request/Identity to the UE.
2) UE replies with an EAP Response/Identity containing a re-authentication
identity (this identity was previously delivered by AAA server in a full
authentication procedure).
3) The Non-3GPP Access Network forwards the EAP Response/Identity to the AAA
server. Intermediate Proxy AAA\'s may perform routing and forwarding
functions.
4) The AAA server initiates the Counter (which was initialized to one in the
full authentication process) and sends it in the EAP Request message, together
with the NONCE, the MAC (calculated over the NONCE) and a protected re-
authentication ID for a next fast re-authentication. If the AAA server is not
able to deliver a re-authentication identity, next time the UE shall force a
full-authentication (to avoid the use of the re-authentication identity more
than once).
5) The 3GPP AAA Server may send a result indication to the UE, in order to
indicate that the success result message at the end of the process shall be
protected (if the outcome is successful). The protection of result messages
depends on home operator\'s policies.
6) The 3GPP AAA server may fail to recognize the identity as it may have been
altered by proxies. In this case, the 3GPP AAA server may, as in the case of a
full authentication, instead perform an EAP AKA\' method specific identity
request; i.e. \"EAP-Request/AKA\' identity [Any identity]\" in order to obtain
a more reliable identity, in analogy of step 7 of the full EAP AKA\'
authentication. This should however only be used in case the server fails to
recognize the identity, as otherwise the purpose of fast re-authentication is
defeated.
7) The Non-3GPP Access Network forwards the EAP Request message to the UE.
8) The UE verifies that the Counter value is fresh and the MAC is correct, and
it sends the EAP Response message with the same Counter value (it is up to the
AAA server to step it up) and a calculated MAC.
9) The UE shall include in this message the result indication if it received
the same indication from the 3GPP AAA. Otherwise, the UE shall omit this
indication.
10) The Non-3GPP Access Network forwards the response toward the AAA server.
11) The AAA server verifies that the Counter value is the same as it sent, and
the MAC is correct, and sends the message EAP Request/AKA\'-Notification,
previous to the EAP Success message, if the 3GPP AAA Server requested
previously to use protected success result indications. The message EAP
Request/AKA\'-Notification is MAC protected, and includes an encrypted copy
the Counter used in the present re-authentication process.
12) The Non-3GPP Access Network forwards the EAP Request/AKA\'-Notification
message to the UE.
13) The UE sends the EAP Response/AKA\'-Notification.
14) The Non-3GPP Access Network forwards the EAP Response/AKA\'-Notification
message toward the 3GPP AAA server. The 3GPP AAA Server shall ignore the
contents of this message.
15) The AAA server sends an EAP Success message. If some extra keying material
was generated for Access Network specific confidentiality and/or integrity
protection, then the 3GPP AAA Server includes this derived keying material in
the underlying AAA protocol message. (i.e., not at EAP level). The Non-3GPP
Access Network stores the keying material which may be used in communication
with the authenticated UE.
16) The EAP Success message is forwarded to the UE.
The re-authentication process may fail at any moment, for example because of
unsuccessful checking of MACs or no response from the UE after a network
request. In that case, the EAP AKA\' process will be terminated as specified
in RFC 5448 [23] and an indication shall be sent to HSS/HLR.
## 6.4 Authentication and key agreement for untrusted access
For untrusted access, UE and the ePDG shall perform mutual authentication
during the IPsec tunnel establishment between the UE and the ePDG (SWu
reference point). This procedure is specified in clause 8 of the present
document.
In addition, before the IPsec tunnel establishment between the UE and the ePDG
can be performed, the UE needs to obtain IP connectivity across the access
network, which may require an access authentication, which is independent of
the EAP-AKA authentication run in conjunction with the IPsec tunnel
establishment. This additional access authentication and key agreement is not
required for the security of the Evolved Packet Core. However, it may be
required for the security of the untrusted non-3GPP access network. Any
authentication and key agreement procedure deemed appropriate by the access
network provider, including EAP-AKA', may be used.
## 6.5 Authentication and authorization with S2b for Private network access
from Untrusted non-3GPP Access networks
### 6.5.1 General
Two procedures for the authentication and authorization for the Private
network access are possible with S2b. The first procedure described in clause
6.5.2 is applicable in the scenario where the External AAA Server supports the
PAP procedure. The second procedure described in clause 6.5.3 is applicable in
the scenario where the External AAA Server supports the CHAP procedure.
NOTE 1: TS 33.234 [9] also covers the case of the External AAA Server
supporting the EAP procedure, but EAP is only supported for I-WLAN, not for
S2b (nor for S2a or 3GPP accesses).
NOTE 2: External network operators wanting to use PAP for authentication are
warned that PAP is an obsolete protocol from a security point of view. CHAP
provides stronger security than PAP.
### 6.5.2 Authentication and authorization for the Private network access (the
External AAA Server performs PAP procedure)
The signalling sequence when the External AAA server performs the PAP
procedures in a network based mobility system to authenticate and authorize
the UE\'s access to a Private network over an Untrusted non-3GPP Acess network
using S2b is illustrated in Figure 6.5.3-1. In this procedure, the External
AAA Server supports the PAP procedure.
Figure 6.5.2-1: Authentication and authorization for the Private network
access over S2b\ (The External AAA Server performs PAP procedure)
NOTE: The parameters indicated with bold character denote support for \"the
multiple authentication and authorization\", as specified in RFC 4739 [30].
1\. The UE and the ePDG exchange the first pair of IKE_SA_INIT messages, in
which the ePDG and the UE negotiate cryptographic algorithms, exchange nonces
and perform a Diffie-Hellman exchange. If the ePDG supports multiple
authentication procedures, it indicates MULTIPLE_AUTH_SUPPORTED in step 1b.
> 2\. The UE sends the user identity (in the IDi payload) and the APN

>
> 3.-11. The steps 3 to 11 clause 8.2.2 apply here.
>
> 12\. The UE shall take its own copy of the MSK as input to generate the AUTH

> is sent to the ePDG. The UE includes a Notify payload ANOTHER_AUTH_FOLLOWS
> indicating to the ePDG that another authentication and authorization round
> will follow.
13\. The ePDG checks the correctness of the AUTH received from the UE and
calculates the AUTH parameter which authenticates the second IKE_SA_INIT
message. The AUTH parameter is sent to the UE.
NOTE: At this point the UE is authenticated from EPC point of view. PMIP/GTP
signalling between ePDG and PDN GW could start anytime after this step but
since an additional authentication with the external network was indicated in
step 12, the ePDG needs to collect additional authentication parameters from
the UE before initiating the PMIP binding update / GTP session creation
procedure in Step 15.
14\. The UE sends the identity in the private network in IDi payload that is
used for the next authentication and authorization with the External AAA
Server and without an AUTH payload.
15\. If the External AAA Server supports the PAP procedure, the ePDG sends an
EAP-GTC request to the UE for the next authentication.
16\. The UE returns an EAP-GTC response containing the user's password to the
ePDG.
17\. The ePDG includes the user-name and user-password as Additional
Parameters in the PBU it sends to PGW as defined in 3GPP TS 29.275 [32]. The
corresponding message in GTP for S2b is Create Session Request as defined in
3GPP TS 29.274 [31].
18\. The PGW sends a AAA Access request message with user-name and user-
password attributes which are copied from the PBU Additional Parameters to the
external AAA server.
19\. The external AAA server returns the Access accept to the PGW.
20\. The PGW sends PBA (PMIP) /Create Session Response (GTP) to the ePDG with
the Additional Parameters indicating authentication success.
21\. The EAP-success message is sent to the UE over IKEv2.
22.-23. The PGW sends the Accounting request (Start) message to the External
AAA Server and the External AAA Server returns the Accounting response (Start)
message to the PGW if needed.
24\. The UE shall generate the AUTH parameter calculated by the SK_pi as a
shared secret as specified in RFC 5996 [30] in order to authenticate the first
IKE_SA_INIT message. The AUTH parameter is sent to the ePDG.
25\. The ePDG checks the correctness of the AUTH received from the WLAN UE and
calculates the AUTH parameter which authenticates the second IKE_SA_INIT
message. The ePDG shall send the assigned Remote IP address in the
configuration payload (CFG_REPLY), if the WLAN UE requested a Remote IP
address through the CFG_REQUEST. Then the AUTH parameter calculated by the
SK_pr as a shared secret (see RFC 5996 [30]) is sent to the WLAN UE together
with the configuration payload, security associations and the rest of the
IKEv2 parameters and the IKEv2 negotiation terminates.
#### 6.5.3 Authentication and authorization for the private network access
(the external AAA server performs CHAP procedure)
The signalling sequence when the External AAA server performs the CHAP
procedures in a network based mobility system to authenticate and authorize
the UE\'s access to a Private network over an Untrusted non-3GPP Acess network
is illustrated in Figure 6.5.3-1. In this procedure, the External AAA Server
supports the CHAP procedure.
Figure 6.5.3-1: Authentication and authorization for the Private network
access over S2b\ (The External AAA Server performs CHAP procedure)
NOTE 1: The parameters indicated with bold character denote support for \"the
multiple authentication and authorization\", as specified in RFC 4739 [33].
Only the PMIP case is shown in this figure for the sake of clarity, but the
text below also covers the GTP case.
1\. The UE and the ePDG exchange the first pair of IKE_SA_INIT messages, in
which the ePDG and the UE negotiate cryptographic algorithms, exchange nonces
and perform a Diffie-Hellman exchange. If the ePDG supports multiple
authentication procedures, it indicates MULTIPLE_AUTH_SUPPORTED in step 1b.
2\. The UE sends the user identity (in the IDi payload) and the APN
information (in the IDr payload) to the ePDG and begins negotiation of child
security associations. The UE omits the AUTH parameter in order to indicate to
the ePDG that it wants to use EAP over IKEv2. The user identity shall be
compliant with the Network Access Identifier (NAI) format specified in 3GPP TS
23.003 [8], containing the IMSI or the pseudonym as defined for EAP-AKA in RFC
4187 [7]).\ If the UE's Remote IP address needs to be configured dynamically,
then the UE shall send the configuration payload (CFG_REQUEST) within the
IKE_AUTH request message to obtain a Remote IP Address. If the APN requires
authentication and authorization with the External AAA Server and the ePDG
indicated that multiple authentication procedures are supported in step 1b,
then MULTIPLE_AUTH_SUPPORTED is included.
3.-11. The steps 3 to 11 in clause 8.2.2 apply here.
12\. The UE shall take its own copy of the MSK as input to generate the AUTH
parameter to authenticate the first IKE_SA_INIT message. The AUTH parameter is
sent to the ePDG. The UE includes a Notify payload ANOTHER_AUTH_FOLLOWS
indicating to the ePDG that another authentication and authorization round
will follow.
13\. The ePDG checks the correctness of the AUTH received from the UE and
calculates the AUTH parameter which authenticates the second IKE_SA_INIT
message. The AUTH parameter is sent to the UE.
NOTE 2: At this point the UE is authenticated from EPC point of view. PMIP/GTP
signalling between ePDG and PDN GW could start anytime after this step but
since an additional authentication with the external network was indicated in
step 12, the ePDG needs to collect additional authentication parameters from
the UE before initiating the PMIP binding update / GTP session creation
procedure in Step 15.
14\. The UE sends the identity in the private network in IDi payload that is
used for the next authentication and authorization with the External AAA
Server and without an AUTH payload.
15\. If the External AAA Server supports the CHAP procedure, the ePDGsends an
EAP MD5-challenge request to the UE for the next authentication.
16\. The UE returns an EAP MD5-Challenge response to the ePDG.
17\. The ePDG includes the user-name, CHAP-password and CHAP-Challenge as
Additional Parameters in the PBU it sends to PGW as defined in 3GPP TS 29.275
[32]. The corresponding message in GTP for S2b is Create Session Request as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.274 [31].
18\. The PGW sends a AAA Access request message with user-name, CHAP-password
and CHAP-Challenge attributes, which are copied from the Additional Parameters
in the PBU, to the External AAA server.
19\. The External AAA server returns the Access accept to the PGW.
20\. The PGW sends PBA (PMIP) /Create Session Response (GTP) to the ePDG with
the Additional Paramters indicating authentication success.
21\. The EAP success message is sent to the UE over IKEv2.
22.-23. The PGW sends the Accounting request (Start) message to the External
AAA Server and the External AAA Server returns the Accounting response (Start)
message to the PGW if needed.
24\. The UE shall generate the AUTH parameter calculated by the SK_pi as a
shared secret as specified in RFC 5996 [30] in order to authenticate the first
IKE_SA_INIT message. The AUTH parameter is sent to the ePDG.
25\. The ePDG checks the correctness of the AUTH received from the UE and
calculates the AUTH parameter which authenticates the second IKE_SA_INIT
message. The ePDG shall send the assigned Remote IP address in the
configuration payload (CFG_REPLY), if the UE requested a Remote IP address
through the CFG_REQUEST. Then the AUTH parameter calculated by the SK_pr as a
shared secret (see RFC 5996 [30]) is sent to the UE together with the
configuration payload, security associations and the rest of the IKEv2
parameters and the IKEv2 negotiation terminates.
## 6.6 Re-authentication based on ERP
### 6.6.1 Introduction
The EAP Re-authentication protocol (ERP) is specified in IETF RFC 6696 [x]. It
is independent on the EAP method in use but it permits a re-authentication
based on key material (unexpired) derived from a previous authentication. As
for the Fast re-authentication method (clause 6.3), it re-uses the key derived
from the previous full authentication. It does not involve the HSS, nor the
credentials used by EAP-AKA\' and does not involve the handling of EAP-AKA\'
authentication vectors, which makes the procedure faster and reduces the load
on (the 3GPP AAA server and) the HSS and, in particular the Authentication
Centre.
The ERP protocol permits to perform the re-authentication process at the 3GPP
AAA Server avoiding signalling on SWx. It also permits to delegate the re-
authentication process to the TWAP (Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy) avoiding
signalling on STa (and SWd in case of roaming) or to the 3GPP AAA Proxy
avoiding signalling on SWd, thus reducing the load as well on the 3GPP AAA
server.
To use ERP, the basic assumption is that ERP is supported by the WLAN. For
non-roaming scenarios, the ER server (as described in IETF RFC 6696[x]) may
reside in the TWAP or the 3GPP AAA server. In roaming scenarios, there is an
additional case where the ER server resides within the 3GPP AAA Proxy.
The EAP server, which resides in the 3GPP AAA server, shall support the ERP
related functionalities as defined in IETF RFC 6696 [46].
The ER Authenticator resides in the EAP Authenticator.
### 6.6.2 ERP bootstrapping
#### 6.6.2.1 General
In order to perform re-authentication, the UE and the network shall derive
corresponding ERP Keys. Those ERP keys are derived from the EMSK that is
derived during the first EAP exchange in clause 6.2 step 12. The ERP implicit
bootstrapping consists of deriving the ERP keys and providing those keys to
the ER server during the full EAP authentication. At the end of the ERP
bootstrap phase both UE and ER server share keying material for further re-
authentication.
NOTE: Only the ERP Implicit Bootstrapping mode defined in IETF RFC 6696 [46]
is supported.
#### 6.6.2.2 ERP Implicit bootstrapping
In the implicit mode, the ERP Keys are derived during the EAP exchange.
Figure 6.6.2.2-1: Implicit ERP Bootstrapping
1\. The ER Authenticator sends an EAP Request/Identity to the UE.
2\. The UE sends an EAP Response/Identity message.
3\. The ER Authenticator sends the message towards the home EAP server.
If ER server is located in TWAP or 3GPP AAA Proxy:
4\. The ER server receives the message. It shall include, in the request
fowarded to the 3GPP AAA server, the domain name and the ERP-RK-Request to
retrieve an ERP key specific for that domain as specified in IETF RFC 6942
[47].
5\. The complete EAP exchange continues as described in clause 6.2 (from step
6 to step 23a). The HSS indicates to the 3GPP AAA Server if the subscriber is
authorized to use ERP.
6\. If the authentication is successfull and the subscriber is authorized to
use ERP and the use of ERP in the visited domain is authorized, the 3GPP AAA
server sends the ERP keying material as described in IETF RFC 6942 [47] along
with the EAP-Success.
7\. The ER server removes from the message and stores the ERP Keying material
and forwards the Diameter message with the MSK and the ERP-Realm to the ER
authenticator.
If ER server is located in the 3GPP AAA server, message 4 and 6 do not apply.
In this case, ER server and EAP server are internal to the 3GPP AAA server.
5\. The complete EAP exchange continues as described in clause 6.2 (from step
6 to step 23a). The HSS indicates to the 3GPP AAA Server if the subsriber is
authorized to use ERP.
7\. If the authentication is successful and the subscriber is authorized to
use ERP, the ER serversends the Diameter message with the MSK and the ERP-
Realm to the ER authenticator.
#### 6.6.2.3 Void
### 6.6.3 ERP exchange for re-authentication
The UE either by the implicit or the explicit bootstrapping owns necessary
keying information for ERP re-authentication.
Figure 6.6.3-1:ERP Re-authentication exchange
1) The ERP exchange is optionnally triggered by the ER Authenticator sending
an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth-Start.
2) The UE sends an EAP-Initiate/Re-auth message to the ER Authenticator.
3) The ER Authenticator processes the message as in IETF RFC 6696 [46] and
sends a AAA message to the ER server as described in IETF RFC 6942 [47].
4) The ER server verifies the validity of the ERP message as described in IETF
RFC 6942 [47] and if the re-authentication is successful, it replies to the ER
Authenticator with the rMSK.
> 5) The ER Authenticator retrieves the rMSK and forwards the EAP-Finish/Re-
> auth to the UE.
### 6.6.4 ERP key derivation
The key derivation mechanism for ERP is described in IETF RFC 6696 [46].
# 7 Establishment of security contexts in the target access system
## 7.1 General assumptions
The following sub-clauses describe all the specifics that are related to the
establishment of the security context of the non-3GPP target access for the
purpose of Interworking with EPS system. The target access system may have
other specifics that are used for the establishment of the security context
while interworking with EPS system is not considered. These specifics are
outside the scope of the present document.
## 7.2 Establishment of security context for trusted non-3GPP access
In this case, the credentials the UE shares with the 3GPP AAA server are used
to establish security contexts in the access system.
It is assumed that the EPS user always uses EAP-AKA' credentials (e.g. a USIM
application in case of terminal with 3GPP access capabilities) to perform
mutual authentication and establish security contexts with the Home Network.

NOTE: S103 is expected to be based on GRE, and as such does not involve any
secure signalling to exchange GRE keys.
#### 7.2.1.4 Security of the initial access to EPS via HRPD
EAP-AKA\' access authentication shall be used according to section 6. As a
result of EAP-AKA\', the two keys, MSK and EMSK, are generated, cf. RFC 5448
[23].
In addition, according to subclause 6.2 of the present document, the 3GPP AAA
Server sends the key MSK to the authenticator in the access network. The 3GPP
AAA server shall retain the EMSK either until the subsequent EAP-AKA\'
authentication, or until it receives an indication that the current
authenticated session is finished.
The security contexts in the HRPD access network may be based on keys derived
from MSK. The HRPD access network is required to ensure that the identity of a
user with whom a security context is established is securely tied to the
identity of a user authenticated by EAP-AKA\'.
The further details of the establishment of security contexts in the HRPD
access network are outside the scope of the present document.
NOTE: Initial access to the EPS via HRPD is described in the TS 23.402 [5].
#### 7.2.1.5 Security of handoff and pre-registration
NOTE: Security of handoff and pre-registration is described in the Section 10
of the present document.
### 7.2.2 WIMAX EPS Interworking
General Concepts for interworking between EPS and WIMAX are described in TS
23.402 [5].Computation of mobility keys used for MIPv4 interworking with WiMAX
access system is specified in clause 9.2.1
### 7.2.3 Trusted WLAN Access (TWAN)
#### 7.2.3.1 General
A Trusted WLAN Access Network (TWAN) is interfaced with the EPC as a trusted
non-3GPP access via the STa interface to the 3GPP AAA Server/Proxy and the S2a
interface to the PDN GW as described in clause 16 of TS 23.402 [5].
Authentication and key agreement shall be performed as described in clause 6
and clause 7.2.3.2 of the present document for trusted non-3GPP access. The
authenticator shall reside in the TWAN.
The 3GPP AAA Server sendsthe key MSK and key derived from EMSK to the TWAN.
The security contexts in the TWAN are based on MSK and key derived from EMSK
The interfaces inside the TWAN shall be integrity- and confidentiality-
protected.
NOTE: Integrity- and confidentiality-protection may be provided by
cryptographical or physical means.
#### 7.2.3.2 Security for WLAN Control Protocol (WLCP)
##### 7.2.3.2.1 Authentication and key agreement
When multi-connection mode is negotiated as defined in clause 16 of TS 23.402
[39], WLAN Control Protocol (WLCP) is used between the UE and TWAG to control
(e.g. setup and teardown) PDN connections over a TWAN access. In this case
authentication and key agreement as defined in clause 6.2 of the present
document shall be used with the following exceptions and additions:
In step 23, the 3GPP AAA Server derives the WLCP key from the EMSK as defined
in Annex A.3, and sends it to the Trusted WLAN AAA Proxy (TWAP) in the TWAN in
addition to the MSK, in the underlying AAA protocol message (i.e. not at the
EAP level). Upon receiving the EAP Success message, the MSK, and the WLCP key,
the TWAP provides the WLCP key, together with the IMSI and the UE MAC address,
to the TWAG to be used for protecting the WLCP between the UE and TWAG. The
TWAG shall store the received WLCP key together with the IMSI, the UE MAC
address and the identity of the tunnel it establishes with the P-GW. The TWAG
may also associate the WLCP key with the IP address once the latter has been
allocated to the UE. The AAA server, TWAP, and TWAG shall behave as described
in this paragraph irrespective of whether the UE MAC address is already in use
or not.
NOTE: Using the IP address allocated to the UE, once it has been allocated, as
an index for finding the WLCP key needed to verify an incoming WLCP message
has the advantage that there is only one WLCP key associated with the IP
address while there may be several WLCP keys associated with a UE MAC address
when the latter is used at different APs.
Upon successful authentication, the UE derives the WLCP key from the EMSK in
the same way as the 3GPP AAA Server does as defined in clause 7.2.3.2.3.
##### 7.2.3.2.2 Fast re-authentication
In case of fast re-authentication the procedures as defined in clause 6.3
shall be used with the exception that the WLCP key is derived and handled in
the same way as in the clause 7.2.3.2.1.
##### 7.2.3.2.3 Protection of WLCP signalling
DTLS with pre-shared key as defined in RFC 6347 [37] shall be used to protect
WLCP signalling between the UE and TWAG. The key for DTLS is the WLCP key
derived as defined in Annex A.3.
The UE shall establish a DTLS connection with the TWAG after successful
authentication in case of multi-connection mode.
When receiving a WLCP message, the TWAG shall retrieve the WLCP key(s)
associated with the UE MAC address or UE IP address, if already allocated, of
the message. If DTLS message authentication is successful for a retrieved WLCP
key the TWAG shall use the IMSI and tunnel identifier associated with this
WLCP key for further handling of the WLCP message.
##### 7.2.3.2.4 DTLS profile
The UE and the TWAG shall support the DTLS profile as defined in TS 33.310
[38], annex E. DTLS confidentiality is optional for use with WLCP..
## 7.3 Establishment of security context between UE and untrusted non-3GPP
Access
If authentication and key agreement procedure as described optional in
subclause 6.4 is performed then also security contexts may be established
between UE and non-3GPP access network. However, such additional establishment
of security contexts is not required for the security of the Evolved Packet
Core in the case of untrusted access.
# 8 Establishment of security between UE and ePDG
## 8.1 General
This section details the security mechanisms for procedures for untrusted
Non-3GPP IP Accesses specified in TS 23.402 [5].
## 8.2 Mechanisms for the set up of UE-initiated IPsec tunnels
### 8.2.1 General
\- The UE and the ePDG shall use IKEv2, as specified in RFC 5996 [30],in order
to establish IPSec security associations.
\- Public key signature based authentication with certificates, as specified
in RFC 5996 [30], shall be used to authenticate the ePDG. The ePDG shall
authenticate itself to the UE with an identity. This identity shall be the
same as the FQDN of the ePDG determined by the ePDG selection procedures
defined in TS 23.402 [5]. This identity shall be contained in the IKEv2
ID_FQDN payload and shall match a dNSName SubjectAltName component in the
ePDG\'s certificate.
\- EAP-AKA, as specified in RFC 4187 [7], within IKEv2, as specified in RFC
5996 [30], shall be used to authenticate UEs.
\- For profile for IKEv2, IPsec ESP and certificate contents and processing
refer to subclause 8.2.4.
\- For the security aspects of emergency calls, cf. clause 13 of this
specification.
### 8.2.2 Tunnel full authentication and authorization
The tunnel end point in the network is the ePDG. As part of the tunnel
establishment attempt the use of a certain APN is requested. When a new
attempt for tunnel establishment is performed by the UE the UE shall use IKEv2
as specified in RFC 5996 [30]. The authentication of the UE in its role as
IKEv2 initiator terminates in the 3GPP AAA Server. The UE shall send EAP
messages over IKEv2 to the ePDG. The ePDG shall extract the EAP messages
received from the UE over IKEv2, and send them to the 3GPP AAA Server. The UE
shall use the Configuration Payload of IKEv2 to obtain the Remote IP address.
The EAP-AKA message parameters and procedures regarding authentication are
omitted. Only decisions and processes relevant to the use of EAP-AKA within
IKEv2 are explained.
The message flow for the full authentication is depicted in the Figure
8.2.2-1.
Figure 8.2.2-1: Tunnel full authentication and authorization
As the UE and ePDG generate nonces as input to derive the encryption and
authentication keys in IKEv2, replay protection is provided. For this reason,
there is no need for the 3GPP AAA Server to request the user identity again
using the EAP-AKA specific methods (as specified in RFC 4187 [7]), because the
3GPP AAA Server is certain that no intermediate node has modified or changed
the user identity.
1\. The UE and the ePDG exchange the first pair of messages, known as
IKE_SA_INIT, in which the ePDG and UE negotiate cryptographic algorithms,
exchange nonces and perform a Diffie_Hellman exchange.
2\. The UE sends the user identity (in the IDi payload) and the APN
information (in the IDr payload) in this first message of the IKE_AUTH phase,
and begins negotiation of child security associations. The UE omits the AUTH
parameter in order to indicate to the ePDG that it wants to use EAP over
IKEv2. The user identity shall be compliant with Network Access Identifier
(NAI) format specified in TS 23.003 [8], containing the IMSI or the pseudonym,
as defined for EAP-AKA in RFC 4187 [7]). The UE shall send the configuration
payload (CFG_REQUEST) within the IKE_AUTH request message to obtain an IPv4
and/or IPV6 home IP Address and/or a Home Agent Address. If the UE is
provisioned with the ePDG root certificate, it shall include the CERTREQ
payload within the IKE_AUTH request message to request ePDG's certificate.
3\. The ePDG sends the Authentication and Authorization Request message to the
3GPP AAA Server, containing the user identity and APN. The UE shall use the
NAI as defined in accordance with clause 19.3 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [8], the 3GPP
AAA server shall identify based on the realm part of the NAI that combined
authentication and authorization is being performed for tunnel establishment
with an ePDG which allows only EAP-AKA (and not an I-WLAN PDG as defined in TS
33.234 [9], which would allow also EAP-SIM). The different Diameter
application IDs will help the 3GPP AAA Server distinguish among
authentications for trusted access, as specified in clause 6 of the present
document (which requires EAP-AKA\' authentication), and authentications for
tunnel setup in EPS (which allows only EAP-AKA).
4\. The 3GPP AAA Server shall fetch the authentication vectors from HSS/HLR
(if these parameters are not available in the 3GPP AAA Server). The 3GPP AAA
Server shall lookup the IMSI of the authenticated user based on the received
user identity (root NAI or pseudonym) and include the EAP-AKA as requested
authentication method in the request sent to the HSS. The HSS shall then
generate authentication vectors with AMF separation bit = 0 and send them back
to the 3GPP AAA server.
5\. The 3GPP AAA Server initiates the authentication challenge. The user
identity is not requested again.
6\. The ePDG responds with its identity, a certificate, (if the UE has
requested with a CERTREQ payload in step 2), and sends the AUTH parameter to
protect the previous message it sent to the UE (in the IKE_SA_INIT exchange).
The EAP message received from the 3GPP AAA Server (EAP-Request/AKA-Challenge)
is included in order to start the EAP procedure over IKEv2.
7\. The UE checks the authentication parameters and responds to the
authentication challenge. The IKE_AUTH request message includes the EAP
message (EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge) containing UE's response to the
authentication challenge.
8\. The ePDG forwards the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge message to the 3GPP AAA
Server.
8.a The AAA checks, if the authentication response is correct.
8.b-e If dynamic IP mobility selection is executed embedded to the
authentication and authorization, the selected mobility mode is sent to the
user in an AKA-Notification request, over Diameter A&A answer and IKE_AUTH
message. The UE responds to this over IKEv2 and the ePDG forwards the response
to the 3GPP AAA Server.
8A. The 3GPP AAA Server shall initiate the Subscriber Profile Retrieval and
3GPP AAA Server registration to the HSS. The 3GPP AAA Server checks in user\'s
subscription if he/she is authorized for non-3GPP access.
9\. When all checks are successful, the 3GPP AAA Server sends the final
Authentication and Authorization Answer (with a result code indicating
success) including the relevant service authorization information, an EAP
success and the key material to the ePDG. This key material shall consist of
the MSK generated during the authentication process. When the SWm and SWd
interfaces between ePDG and 3GPP AAA Server are implemented using Diameter,
the MSK shall be encapsulated in the EAP-Master-Session-Key-AVP, as defined in
RFC 4072 [10].
10\. The MSK shall be used by the ePDG to generate the AUTH parameters in
order to authenticate the IKE_SA_INIT phase messages, as specified for IKEv2
in RFC 5996 [30]. These two first messages had not been authenticated before
as there was no key material available yet. According to RFC 5996 [30], the
shared secret generated in an EAP exchange (the MSK), when used over IKEv2,
shall be used to generated the AUTH parameters.
11\. The EAP Success/Failure message is forwarded to the UE over IKEv2.
12\. The UE shall take its own copy of the MSK as input to generate the AUTH
parameter to authenticate the first IKE_SA_INIT message. The AUTH parameter is
sent to the ePDG.
13\. The ePDG checks the correctness of the AUTH received from the UE. At this
point the UE is authenticated. In case S2b is used, PMIP signalling between
ePDG and PDN GW can now start, as specified in TS 23.402 [5]. The ePDG
continues with the next step in the procedure described here only after
successful completion of the PMIP binding update procedure.
14\. The ePDG calculates the AUTH parameter which authenticates the second
IKE_SA_INIT message. The ePDG shall send the assigned Remote IP address in the
configuration payload (CFG_REPLY).
15 The AUTH parameter is sent to the UE together with the configuration
payload, security associations and the rest of the IKEv2 parameters and the
IKEv2 negotiation terminates.
### 8.2.3 Tunnel fast re-authentication and authorization
Fast re-authentication for EAP-AKA is specified in RFC 4187 [7]. Fast re-
authentication re-uses keys derived on the previous full authentication. Fast
re-authentication does not involve the HSS nor the credentials used with EAP-
AKA (e.g. USIM application in case of terminal with 3GPP access capabilities),
and does not involve the handling of AKA authentication vectors, which makes
the procedure faster and reduces the load on the HSS and, in particular, the
Authentication Centre.
The UE and the 3GPP AAA server shall implement fast re-authentication for EAP-
AKA. Its use is optional and depends on operator policy.
The security level of fast re-authentication for EAP-AKA is lower as it does
not prove the presence of the credentials used with EAP-AKA (e.g.presence of
USIM application in case of terminal with 3GPP access capabilities) on the
user side. The operator should take this into account when defining the policy
on fast reâ€‘authentication.
Fast re-authentications for EAP-AKA generates new keys MSK, which may be used
for renewing session key used for protection in the non-3GPP access network.
The procedure is very similar to the tunnel full authentication and
authorization. The only difference is that EAP fast re-authentication is used
in this case.
Figure 8.2.3-1: Untrusted Tunnel - Fast Re-authentication
1) The UE and the ePDG exchange the first pair of messages, known as
IKE_SA_INIT, in which the ePDG and UE negotiate cryptographic algorithms,
exchange nonces and perform a Diffie_Hellman exchange.
2) The UE sends the fast re-authentication identity (in the IDi payload) and
the APN information (in the IDr payload) in this first message of the IKE_AUTH
phase, and begins negotiation of child security associations. The UE omits the
AUTH parameter in order to indicate to the ePDG that it wants to use EAP over
IKEv2. The fast re-authentication identity used by the UE shall be the one
received in the previous authentication process. If the UE\'s Remote IP
address needs to be configured dynamically, then the UE shall send the
configuration payload (CFG_REQUEST) within the IKE_AUTH request message to
obtain a Remote IP Address.
3) The ePDG sends the Authentication and Authorization Request message with an
EAP-Payload AVP toward the 3GPP AAA Server, containing the fast re-
authentication identity. The UE shall use the fast re-authentication
identityto create an NAI, as defined in clause 19.3 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [8]. The
3GPP AAA server shall identify based on the realm part of the NAIthat the
combined authentication and authorization is being performed for tunnel
establishment with an ePDG (and not an I-WLAN PDG as defined in TS 33.234 [9]
, which would allow also EAP-SIM). The different Diameter application IDs will
help the 3GPP AAA Server distinguish among authentications for trusted access,
as specified in clause 6 of the present document(which requires EAP-AKA'
authentication), and authentications for tunnel setup in EPS (which allows
only EAP-AKA).
4) The 3GPP AAA Server initiates the fast re-authentication challenge.
5) The ePDG sends an IKE_AUTH Response message to the UE, containing its
identity, a certificate, and the AUTH parameter to protect the previous
message it sent to the UE (in the IKE_SA_INIT exchange). The EAP message (EAP-
Request/AKA-Reauthentication) received from the 3GPP AAA Server is included in
order to start the EAP procedure over IKEv2.
6) The UE checks the authentication parameters and responds to the fast re-
authentication challenge. The IKE_AUTH request message includes the EAP
message (EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge) containing UE's response to the
authentication challenge.
7) The ePDG forwards the EAP-Response/AKA-Reauthentication message toward the
3GPP AAA Server.
8) When all checks are successful, if dynamic IP mobility mode selection is
executed during the tunnel setup, the selected IP mobility mode is sent via
Diameter and IKEv2signaling to the UE.
9) When all checks are successful, the 3GPP AAA Server sends the
Authentication Answer including the user\'s IMSI, the relevant service
authorization information, an EAP success and the key material toward the
ePDG. This key material shall consist of the MSK generated during the fast re-
authentication process. When the SWm interface (ePDG-AAA) is implemented using
Diameter, the MSK shall be encapsulated in the EAP-Master-Session-Key AVP, as
defined in RFC 4072 [10].
10) The MSK shall be used by the ePDG to generate the AUTH parameters in order
to authenticate the IKE_SA_INIT phase messages, as specified in RFC 5996 [30].
These two first messages had not been authenticated before as there were no
key material available yet. According to RFC 5996 [30], the shared secret
generated in an EAP exchange (the MSK), when used over IKEv2, shall be used to
generated the AUTH parameters.
11) The EAP Success message is forwarded to the UE over IKEv2.
12) The UE shall take its own copy of the MSK as input to generate the AUTH
parameter to authenticate the first IKE_SA_INIT message. The AUTH parameter is
sent to the ePDG.
13) The ePDG checks the correctness of the AUTH received from the UE and
calculates the AUTH parameter which authenticates the second IKE_SA_INIT
message. The ePDG shall send the assigned Remote IP address in the
configuration payload (CFG_REPLY), if the UE requested for a Remote IP address
through the CFG_REQUEST. Then the AUTH parameter is sent to the UE together
with the configuration payload, security associations and the rest of the
IKEv2 parameters and the IKEv2 negotiation terminates.
### 8.2.4 Security profiles
#### 8.2.4.1 Profile of IKEv2
When IKEv2 [30] is used in the context of this specification the profile
specified in this section shall be supported by the ePDG and the WLANâ€‘UE.
IKEv2 shall meet the profiling given in clause 5.4.2 of TS 33.210 [6] and
clause 6.2.1b of TS 33.310 [12].
For the certificate based IKEv2 authentication using the ePDG certificate the
profiling given in TS 33.310 [12] shall apply.
For NAT traversal, the NAT support of IKEv2 shall be supported as specified in
section 2.23 of IETF RFC 5996 [30].
#### 8.2.4.2 Profile of IPSec ESP
When IPSec ESP [30] is used in the context of this specification the profile
specified in this section shall be supported. IPsec ESP shall meet the
profiling of encryption and authentication transforms given clause 5.3 of TS
33.210 [6] with the following additions:
\- Tunnel mode shall be used.
For NAT traversal, the UDP encapsulation for ESP tunnel mode specified in
reference [35] shall be supported.
#### 8.2.4.3 Profile for ePDG certificates
Certificates used for authentication of the ePDG shall meet the certificate
profiles given in TS 33.310 [12] as follows: clause 6.1.3, for SEG
certificates shall apply to ePDG certificates, and clause 6.1.4 for SEG CA
certificates shall apply to any CA certificates used in a chain to validate
ePDG certificates, with the following additions and exceptions:
a) The subject name may be empty in ePDG certificates.
b) The issuerUniqueID or subjectUniqueID fields shall not be present.
c) The SubjectAltName extension shall contain at least one dNSName component.
d) CA certificates should contain the NameConstraints extension with
appropriate dNSName components in the permittedSubtrees field.
e) The keyCertSign bit shall be set in CA certificates, and digitalSignature
bit shall be set in ePDG certificates.
f) The CRLDistributionPoint extension may be present, and shall not be marked
critical. At least one of the distribution points should use HTTP for
retrieving the CRL.
g) The AuthorityInformationAccess extension may be present with id-ad-ocsp
access method, and shall not be marked critical.
h) Other extensions should not be used; if they are, they shall not be marked
as critical.
i) The root CA and any intermediate CAs shall be trusted by the operator, but
may be located outside the security domain of the operator.
**Certificate processing requirements:**
a) UE shall send one or more CERTREQ payloads with encoding value 4 (X.509
certificate - Signature).
b) IKEv2 Certificate encoding value shall be 4 (X.509 certificate -
Signature).
c) UE shall not assume that any except the first IKEv2 CERT payload is ordered
in any way.
d) UE shall be able to support certificate paths containing up to four
certificates (e.g. self-signed CA certificate, intermediate CA 1, intermediate
CA 2, ePDG certificate) (and may support longer path lengths), where the
intermediate CA certificates and the ePDG certificate are obtained from the
IKEv2 CERT payload and the self-signed CA certificate is obtained from a UE
local store of trusted root certificates.
e) ePDG shall not send paths containing more than four certificates.
f) UE shall be prepared to receive irrelevant certificates, or certificates
they do not understand.
g) UE shall be able to process certificates (for e.g. chain building) even if
naming attributes are unknown.
h) UE shall support both UTCTime and GeneralizedTime encoding for validity
time.
i) UE shall check the validity time, and reject certificates that are either
not yet valid or are expired.
j) UE shall support processing of the BasicConstraints, NameConstraints, and
KeyUsage extensions.
k) UE may check the validity of the certificates using CRLs or OCSP [42].
Support for CRLs is optional in the UE. Support for OCSP is mandatory in the
UE. In addition, the UE and the ePDG may support the extensions to IKEv2,
which enable the use of OCSP for in-band signalling of certificate revocation
status, according to [43]. The signature algorithm for CRLs and OCSP responses
shall comply with the requirements for the CRL profile in TS 33.310 [12],
clause 6.1a. If the OCSP profile in [42] is used, support for WAP specific
protocols shall not be required.
NOTE 2: A UE that initiates 3GPP IP Access according to the tunnel full
authentication and authorization procedure, may want to check the validity of
the ePDG certificate, but it might not gain access to the OCSP server. This
situation can be handled in the following way: After the UE initiated tunnel
is successfully established and before user data is transmitted in the tunnel,
the UE sends an OCSP request message to OCSP server. When the UE receives the
OCSP response, it checks the certificate status. If the certificate of ePDG is
valid, the UE will allow user data to be transmitted to the ePDG in the
tunnel. If the certificate is not valid, the UE may terminate the tunnel that
just was established.
### 8.2.5 Handling of IPsec tunnels in mobility events
#### 8.2.5.1 General
The below sections describe the handling of IPsec tunnels in the idle and
active mode mobility events when the target access has a UE and an ePDG, e.g.
I-WLAN 3GPP IP Access System. In general, the IPsec tunnel handling during
mobility events is managed by the end nodes where the IPsec tunnel is
terminated, i.e. the UE and the ePDG.
In the case when the UE moves from the coverage area of the source ePDG and
connect to another ePDG or a different access, the management of the IPsec
tunnel between the UE and the source ePDG should be handled as follows:
  1. The UE may keep all related IPsec tunnel security association parameters until its lifetime expires.
  2. If after repeated attempts to contact the UE, the source ePDG concludes that the other endpoint (UE) has failed and all of its attempts have gone unanswered for a timeout period as specified in RFC 5996 [30], the source ePDG may delete all the UE IPsec tunnel SA parameters.
  3. If the source ePDG receieves an indication from a trusted network element that the UE has moved outside its coverage area, e.g. 3GPP AAA server, the source ePDG can delete all of the UE IPsec tunnel security association parameters.
#### 8.2.5.2 Idle mode mobility
When the UE moves from a source access where the UE is connected to an ePDG to
a target access that involves the UE and the same ePDG, the UE shall use
MOBIKE as per RFC 4555 [18] to update the ePDG with its new IP address.
However, when the UE moves where the target access involves the UE and a
different ePDG, the UE shall establish a new IPsec tunnel with the new ePDG as
described in subclause 8.2.2.
On the other hand, if the UE is connected to EPS without being connected to an
ePDG and then moves to a target access which involves the UE and an ePDG, the
UE SHALL establish a new IPsec tunnel with the new ePDG as described in
subclause 8.2.2.
#### 8.2.5.3 Active mode mobility
When the UE moves from a source access where the UE is connected to an ePDG to
a target access that involves the UE and the same ePDG, the UE shall use
MOBIKE as per RFC 4555 [18] to update the ePDG with its new IP address.
However, when the UE moves where the target access involves the UE and a
different ePDG, the UE shall establish a new IPsec tunnel with the new ePDG as
described in subclause 8.2.2.
On the other hand, if the UE is connected to EPS without being connected to an
ePDG and then moves to a target access which involves the UE and an ePDG, the
UE SHALL establish a new IPsec tunnel with the new ePDG as described in
subclause 8.2.2.
# 9 Security for IP based mobility signalling
## 9.1 General
Clause 9.2 covers security for host based mobility and section 9.3 covers
security for network based mobility.
## 9.2 Host based Mobility
### 9.2.1 MIPv4
#### 9.2.1.1 General
MIPv4 FACoA and DSMIPv6 host based mobility protocols are supported over S2a
and S2c interfaces respectively TS 23.402 [5].
The MIPv4 security is based on MIP Authentication extensions as defined in RFC
3344 [17]. The MIPv4 signalling messages shall be protected between the UE and
the node acting as HA (i.e PDN GW) using MIP authentication extensions and
optionally between the UE and the node acting as FA (non-3GPP access
specific).
#### 9.2.1.2 Bootstrapping of MIPv4 FACoA parameters
##### 9.2.1.2.1 Procedures
Figure 9.2.1.2.1-1: MIPv4 bootstrapping
The event that triggers Authentication and Authorization in step 1 between the
Trusted Non-3GPP IP Access and the EAP Server, depends on the specific access
technology cfr.TS 23.402 [5].
1) The Non-3GPP access specific authentication procedure based on EAP-AKA\' is
performed as specified in clause 6.2. Depending on the type of non-3GPP access
system, the PDN GW address (HA address) may be determined at this point. The
details of this procedure and IPMM protocol selection procedure are specified
in TS 23.402 [5]. If the network selects mobility management protocol as MIPv4
FACoA for the UE, then the UE and the EPC derive the keys required for MIPv4
bootstrapping.
> The key EMSK that result from the EAP-AKA\' authentication procedure is used
> to derive MIPv4 bootstrapping keys. Section 9.2.1.2.2 shows the derivation
> of MIPv4 bootstrapping keys in the UE and in the 3GPP AAA server and the key
> distribution from the 3GPP AAA server to the mobility agents. The trusted
> non-3GPP network receives a set of mobility keys and other keys in the
> Access-Accept message as a result of successful authentication.
2) The UE sends a Registration Request (RRQ) message to the FA as specified in
TS 23.402 [5]. The UE includes the MN-HA Authentication Extension (AE) and
optionally the MN-FA Authentication Extension (AE) as specified in RFC 3344
[17].
3) The FA processes the message according to RFC 3344 [17] and validates the
MN-FA Authentication extension if present. The FA then forwards the RRQ
message to the PDN GW. The RRQ message shall be protected between the FA and
the PDN GW according to TS 33.210 [6].
4) The selected PDN GW obtains Authentication and Authorization information
from the AAA/HSS.
5) The PDN GW validates the MN-HA authentication extension. After successful
authentication extension validation, the PDN GW sends a Registration Reply
(RRP) to the UE through the FA. The RRP message shall be protected between the
PDN GW and the FA according to TS 33.210 [6].
6) The FA processes the RRP according to RFC 3344 [17]. The FA then forwards
the RRP message to the UE. The FA includes the MN-FA authentication extension,
if the FA received MN-FA authentication extension in the RRQ message.
7) The UE validates the MN-HA authentication extension and MN-FA
authentication extension, if present.
##### 9.2.1.2.2 MIPv4 Key Derivation
The Mobile IP Root Key (MIP-RK) is generated at the 3GPP AAA Server and the
UE. The MIP-RK is generated from the EMSK according to RFC 5295[19] using the
following formula:

The length of the MIP-RK is 64 octets. The lifetime of MIP-RK is set to the
lifetime of EMSK. The MIP-RK is stored in the 3GPP AAA Server. At the 3GPP AAA
Server each user session is associated with a single MIP-RK. The MIP-RK is
used to generate mobility keys. The MIPv4 keys are generated at the 3GPP AAA
Server and at the UE. The keys generated at the 3GPP AAA Server are
transported to the HA and the Authenticator in the trusted non-3GPP network by
the use of the AAA protocol.
Security Parameter Indices (SPI) is generated from the MIP-RK as follows:
> MIP-SPI = the 4 most significant bytes of HMAC-SHA256 (MIP-RK, \"SPI CMIP
> PMIP \"\| APN))
>
> SPI-CMIP4 = MIP-SPI,
>
> Values MIP-SPI+1, MIP-SPI+2, and MIP-SPI+3 are reserved.
APN is used as an input parameter for deriving unique MIP-SPI, MN-HA key and
MN-FA key per PDN connection. For default PDN connection, the UE does not
provide an APN. In this case APN shall be omitted from the derivation of MIP-
SPI, MN-HA key and MN-FA key.
The MIP-SPI and SPI-CMIP4 are derived at the UE and at the 3GPP AAA server.
The following procedure prevents collision between SPI values used for
different Mobility keys, for example, mobility keys used by other access
technologies, during the same Mobile IP session. The procedure SHALL be
executed as follows:
a. First, if the absolute value of the difference between the MIP-SPI and any
currently active SPI is less than 4, the MIP-SPI value SHALL be incremented by
FOUR until the current condition is satisfied.
b. Next, if the MIP-SPI value is less than THREE smaller than the maximum
possible value of SPI (2^32^ - 1), the MIP-SPI value SHALL be incremented by
259.
c. Last, the process specified in Step 1 SHALL be applied again until the
condition specified in Step 1 is satisfied.
The SPI value is used by the UE, HA, and 3GPP AAA server to identify the MN-HA
key used to compute the MN-HA Authentication Extension in the RRQ message. In
addition, MIP-SPI is distributed to the authenticator during Access
Authentication, in AAA protocol attribute FA-RK-SPI, to identify the FA-RK
key. FA-RK key and FA-RK-SPI will be used to further derive MN-FA key and MN-
FA-SPI, to compute the MN-FA Authentication Extension in the RRQ message. When
the lifetime of the MIP-RK expires the lifetime of the SPIs derived from it
shall also expire.
The derivation of mobility key is given below:
> MN-HA = HMAC-SHA1(MIP-RK,\" CMIP4 MN HA\" \| HA-IPv4 \| MN-NAI \| APN)
The lifetime of all MN-HA keys shall be set to the lifetime of the MIP-RK.
During the initial attach or additional PDN connectivity, the UE may not know
the HA IP address. In this case, the UE use ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR [21] in the RRQ
message to request for dynamic HA assignment. Under this case, the UE shall
derive the MN-HA key using the ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR as the HA-IPv4 address and
use this key for deriving MN-HA Authentication Extension and send in the RRQ.
Then the HA informs this to the 3GPP AAA server in the AAA protocol message.
In response from the 3GPP AAA server, the HA will receive RRQ-MN-HA-KEY that
is calculated based on ALL-ZERO-ONE-ADDR address and also MN-HA key that is
calculated based on HA IP address. The HA shall use the RRQ-MN-HA-KEY for
validation of MN-HA Authentication Extension in the received RRQ. The HA then
use MN-HA key for deriving RRP MN-HA Authentication Extension and sends the HA
IP address as part of the RRP message. The UE shall recalculate the MN-HA key
using the HA IP address received in the RRP and use this key for MN-HA
Authentication Extension validation for the RRP. If the MN-HA authentication
extension is valid, the new MN-HA key shall be in effect.
The derivation of FA-RK and MN-FA mobility keys are given below:
FA-RK = HMAC-SHA1(MIP-RK, \"FA-RK\")
MN-FA = HMAC-SHA1(FA-RK, \"MN FA\" \| FA-IP \| MN-NAI \| APN)
The FA-RK is generated by the 3GPP AAA Server and distributed to the
Authenticator. It is used by the Authenticator to derive MN-FA keys as
requested by the FA. The MN-FA key is derived based on the FA-IP address to
separate keys between different FAs for the same authentication session. The
lifetime of FA-RK and MN-FA shall be set to the lifetime of the MIP-RK. The
SPI associated with the MN-FA (MN-FA-SPI) is set to the same value of FA-RK-
SPI distributed during Access Authentication.
During EAP-Re-authentication, the 3GPP AAA server and the UE generate new MIP-
RK, SPI, MN-HA and FA-RK. The old MIP-RK and its derivatives (MN-HA, FA-RK,
MN-FA) shall be deprecated after confirming that the newly generated mobility
keys in the 3GPP AAA server and the UE are the same. Upon receipt of an MIP-
RRQ from the UE, the HA shall determine whether re-authentication has occurred
since the last MIP-RRQ by comparing the SPI contained in the MN-HA
Authentication extension of the received MIP-RRQ to the locally stored value.
If the two SPIs are different, the HA shall assume that re-authentication has
occurred, and the new MN-HA key shall be retrieved from the 3GPP AAA server.
After verifying the MIP-RRQ message with the new MN-HA key and creating the
MIP-RRP Authentication Extension, the HA deprecate the old key. The UE shall
deprecate the old key, once it successfully verifies the MIP-RRP using the new
key.
##### 9.2.1.2.3 Key Usage
* * *
Key Generated by Used at MN-HA UE and 3GPP AAA server HA and UE FA-RK UE and
3GPP AAA server UE and Authenticator MN-FA UE and Authenticator FA and UE
* * *
The keys that are used by the UE are generated by the UE and shall not be
transported outside the UE. The keys generated by the 3GPP AAA Server are
transported to the HA or the Authenticator using AAA protocols.
##### 9.2.1.2.4 Key Distribution for MIPv4
In this section, key distribution for MIP4 is described. Two scenarios are
possible, where in the first scenario Authenticator and FA are co-located and
in the case of FA relocation, also the Authenticator changes based on EAP re-
authentication. In the second scenario, no re-authentication takes place when
the FA is relocated, so the anchor Authenticator is continued to be used, and
provisions the new FA with the required mobility keys. However key handling
between Authenticator and FA is out of scope of the present document.
The Authenticator receives FA_RK in the RADIUS/DIAMETER Access-Accept message
as a result of successful authentication. The keys are stored at the
authenticator.
The 3GPP AAA Server distributes the MN-HA key, if requested, to the HA using
RADIUS/DIAMETER Access-Accept.
### 9.2.2 DS-MIPv6
#### 9.2.2.1 General
The DS-MIPv6 security is based on IPsec as defined in RFC 4877 [2]. The IPsec
security association is established between the UE and the node acting as HA
(i.e. PDN GW).
The following principles apply:
\- The UE and the HA shall use IKEv2, as specified in RFC 5996 [30], in order
to establish IPsec security associations.
\- Public key signature based authentication with certificates, as specified
in RFC 5996 [30], is used to authenticate the HA. The HA shall authenticate
itself to the UE with an identity. This identity shall be the same as the FQDN
of the HA if the HA is found via DNS cfr. TS 23.402 [5].
\- EAP-AKA, as specified in RFC 4187 [7], within IKEv2, as specified in RFC
4877 [2] and RFC 5996 [30], is used to authenticate UEs.
The following properties are needed to provide secure S2c over a Trusted
Non-3GPP Access:
\- The Trusted Access will authenticate the UE and provide a secure link for
the data to be transferred from the UE to the Trusted Access.
\- The Trusted Access protects against source IP address spoofing.
\- The Trusted Access and PDN GW will have a secure link between them to
transfer the user\'s data across.
\- The Trusted Access and EPC need to co-ordinate when the UE detaches from
the Trusted Access in order to ensure that the IP address that was assigned to
the UE is not be used by another UE without EPC being aware of the change
(i.e. enable the PDN GW to remove the CoA address binding for the old UE).
These properties ensure that the traffic the PDN GW is receiving has
originated at the UE while UE is attached to the Trusted Access. These
properties may be provided using enhanced security mechanisms defined in
clause 9.2.2.4.
NOTE 1: If Trusted Access and EPC do not co-ordinate regarding UE detachment
then the UE that was re-assigned the IP address would be capable of
impersonating traffic until the binding in PDN GW timed out. NOTE 2:
Procedures internal to the Trusted Access are outside the scope of the present
document.
The allocation of IP addresses in the access network may provide the last
property listed above. If the IP address is not re-allocated until after the
MIP Binding has expired or IKE Dead Peer Detection has been run. This means
that the PDN GW will no longer associate the old UE to the IP address once the
new UE gets the IP address and hence there is no risk of impersonation
attacks.
PCC may also be used to provide the last property listed above in access
networks that support it. In the case that PCC is used, a GW control session
is established between the Trusted Access and the PCRF. This GW control
session is identified by the UE ID and the IP address allocated to the UE
(i.e. CoA if DSMIPv6 is used). Using the GW control session, the UE is
restricted to limited access; in particular, the Trusted Access restricts the
forwarding of the packets only to IKEv2 and BU messages until the binding at
the PDN GW is established. The Trusted Access knows when the binding is
established at the PDN GW because it receives an update of the GW control
session. The flows for this control of policy are given in section(s) 6.3 and
6.6.2 of TS 23.402. This prevents a UE that attaches to the Trusted Access
from sending non-signalling traffic to the PDN GW until it has completed a BU
with the PDN GW and prevents an impersonation attack.
#### 9.2.2.2 Bootstrapping of DSMIPv6 parameters
##### 9.2.2.2.1 Full Authentication and authorization
The first procedure that must be performed by the MN is the discovery of the
HA address, which in case of EPS is the IP address of the PDN GW. The detailed
of this procedure are specified in TS 23.402 [5] and TS 24.303 [20].
As soon as the Mobile Node has discovered the PDN GW address, it establishes
an IPsec Security Association with the Home Agent itself through IKEv2. The
detailed description of this procedure is provided in RFC4877 [2]. The IKEv2
Mobile Node to Home Agent authentication is performed using Extensible
Authentication Protocol (EAP).
When the Mobile Node runs IKEv2 with its Home Agent, it shall request an IPv6
Home Network Prefix through the Configuration Payload in the IKE_AUTH exchange
by including an MIP6_HOME_PREFIXattribute.
When the Home Agent processes the message, it allocates a Home Network Prefix
and sends it a CFG_REPLY message. The UE shall then auto-configure a Home
Address from the IPv6 prefix received from the HA.
The IPv6 Home Network Prefix allocation through IKEv2 allows to bind the Home
Address with the IPsec security association so that the MN can only send
Binding Updates for its own Home Address and not for other MN\'s Home
Addresses.
Figure 9.2.2.2.1-1 provides the flow for the initial DS-MIPv6 bootstrapping,
focusing on the security aspects of the flow.
Figure 9.2.2.2.1-1: DS-MIPv6 bootstrapping based on IKEv2
1) The UE discovers the PDN GW address based on the procedure specified in TS
23.402 [5].
2) The UE starts an IKEv2 exchange with the PDN GW. The first part of this
exchange is an IKE_SA_INIT exchange. In this phase the PDN GW and UE negotiate
cryptographic algorithms, exchange nonces and perform a Diffie-Hellman
exchange.
3) The UE sends the user identity (in the IDi payload) and the APN identifier
(in the IDr payload) in this first message of the IKE_AUTH phase, and begins
negotiation of child security associations. The UE omits the AUTH parameter in
order to indicate to the PDN GW that it wants to use EAP over IKEv2. The user
identity shall be compliant with Network Access Identifier (NAI) format
specified in TS 23.003 [8], containing the IMSI or the pseudonym, as defined
for EAP-AKA in RFC 4187 [7]). The UE shall send the configuration payload
(CFG_REQUEST) within the IKE_AUTH request message to obtain an IPv6 Home
Network Prefix as specified in 3GPP TS 24.303 [20]. The UE shall include the
Traffic Selectors to protect DS-MIPv6 signalling as specified in RFC4877 [2].
4) The PDN GW sends the Authentication Request message with an EAP AVP to the
3GPP AAA Server, containing the user identity, APN and a parameter indicating
that the authentication is being performed for DS-MIPv6 security. For the
communication between PDN GW and 3GPP AAA server, cf. also [4].
5) The 3GPP AAA Server shall fetch the user profile and authentication vectors
from HSS/HLR (if these parameters are not available in the 3GPP AAA Server).
The 3GPP AAA Server shall include the parameter received in step 4 indicating
that the authentication is being performed for DSMIPv6 in the request to the
HSS. The HSS shall then generate authentication vectors with AMF separation
bit = 0 and send them back to the 3GPP AAA server. The AAA checks that the UE
is authorised to use the APN.
6) Based on the identity received, the 3GPP AAA server selects an
Authentication Vector (RAND, AUTN, CK, IK, XRES) for the UE. The 3GPP AAA
Server then initiates the authentication challenge by sending the EAP-
Request/AKA-Challenge containing RAND and AUTN as described by RFC 4187 [7].
The user identity is not requested again, as in a normal authentication
process, because there is the certainty that the user identity received in the
EAP Identity Response message has not been modified or replaced by any
intermediate node. The reason is that the user identity was received via an
IKEv2 secure channel which can only be decrypted and authenticated by the end
points (the PDN GW and the UE).
7) The PDN GW responds to the UE with its identity, a certificate, and sends
the AUTH parameter to protect the previous message it sent to the UE (in the
IKE_SA_INIT exchange). The EAP message received from the 3GPP AAA Server (EAP-
Request/AKA-Challenge), which contains RAND and AUTN, is included in order to
start the EAP procedure over IKEv2.
8) The UE checks whether the AUTN is correct [11] and if so calculates CK, IK
and RES and passes these to the UE. The UE checks the IKE authentication
parameters and responds to the authentication challenge. The IKE_AUTH request
message includes the EAP message (EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge) containing UE's
response to the authentication challenge.
9) The PDN GW forwards the EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge message to the 3GPP AAA
Server.
10) The 3GPP AAA Server checks the EAP message including that RES = XRES and
then calculates MSK from CK and IK as described in RFC 4187 [7]. The 3GPP AAA
Server sends the Authentication Answer including an EAP success and the key
material to the PDN GW. This key material shall consist of the MSK generated
during the authentication process. In case of PDN GW reallocation upon attach
on S2c, the AAA shall include the target PDN GW's identity as specified in
3GPP TS 23.402 [5].
11) The AUTH payload is computed using the received MSK.
12) The EAP Success message is forwarded to the UE over IKEv2.
13) The UE also generates MSK as input to generate the AUTH parameter to
authenticate the first IKE_SA_INIT message. The AUTH parameter is sent to the
PDN GW.
14) The PDN GW checks the correctness of the AUTH received from the UE and
calculates the AUTH parameter which authenticates the second IKE_SA_INIT
message. The PDN GW shall send the assigned Home Network prefix in the
configuration payload (CFG_REPLY) as specified in 3GPP TS 24.303 [20], except
in the case of PDN GW reallocation upon attach on S2c, when the PDN GW shall
send to the UE the target PDN GW's address as specified in 3GPP TS 23.402 [5].
Then the AUTH parameter is sent to the UE together with the configuration
payload, security associations and the rest of the IKEv2 parameters and the
IKEv2 negotiation terminates.
> In the case PDN GW reallocation, the UE shall begin a new DSMIPv6
> bootstrapping with the target PDN GW.
##### 9.2.2.2.2 Fast re-authentication and authorization
Fast re-authentication for EAP-AKA is specified in RFC 4187 [7]. Fast re-
authentication re-uses keys derived on the previous full authentication. Fast
re-authentication does not involve the HSS nor the credentials used with EAP-
AKA (e.g. USIM application in case of terminal with 3GPP access capabilities),
and does not involve the handling of AKA authentication vectors, which makes
the procedure faster and reduces the load on the HSS and, in particular, the
Authentication Centre.
The UE and the 3GPP AAA server shall implement fast re-authentication for the
use of EAP-AKA with DSMIPv6. Its use is optional and depends on operator
policy.
The security level of fast re-authentication for EAP-AKA is lower as it does
not prove the presence of the EAP-AKA credentials (e.g. USIM application in
case of terminal with 3GPP access capabilities) on the user side. The operator
should take this into account when defining the policy on fast
reâ€‘authentication.
Fast re-authentications for EAP-AKA generates new keys MSK, which may be used
for renewing session key used for protection in the non-3GPP access network.
The procedure is very similar to the tunnel full authentication and
authorization. The only difference is that EAP fast re-authentication is used
in this case.
Figure 9.2.2.2.2-1: Fast Re-authentication for DSMIPv6
1) The UE and the PDN GW exchange the first pair of messages, known as
IKE_SA_INIT, in which the PDN GW and UE negotiate cryptographic algorithms,
exchange nonces and perform a Diffie_Hellman exchange.
2) The UE sends the re-authentication identity (in the IDi payload) and the
APN information (in the IDr payload) in this first message of the IKE_AUTH
phase, and begins negotiation of child security associations. The UE omits the
AUTH parameter in order to indicate to the PDN GW that it wants to use EAP
over IKEv2. The re-authentication identity used by the UE shall be the one
received in the previous authentication process. If the UE\'s Remote IP
address needs to be configured dynamically, then the UE shall send the
configuration payload (CFG_REQUEST) within the IKE_AUTH request message to
obtain a Remote IP Address.
3) The PDN GW sends the Authentication Request message with an EAP AVP toward
the 3GPP AAA Server, containing the re-authentication identity. The PDN GW
shall include the APN and a parameter indicating that the authentication is
being performed for DSMIPv6 with a PDN GW. This will help the 3GPP AAA Server
distinguish among authentications for DSMIPv6, trusted access, as specified in
clause 6 of the present document, authentications for tunnel setup in I-WLAN
(which would allow also EAP-SIM) and authentications for tunnel setup in EPS
(which allow only EAP-AKA). The AAA checks that the UE is authorised to use
the APN.
4) The 3GPP AAA Server initiates the fast re-authentication challenge.
5) The PDN GW sends an IKE_AUTH Response message to the UE, containing its
identity, a certificate, and the AUTH parameter to protect the previous
message it sent to the UE (in the IKE_SA_INIT exchange). The EAP message (EAP-
Request/AKA-Reauthentication) received from the 3GPP AAA Server is included in
order to start the EAP procedure over IKEv2.
6) The UE checks the authentication parameters and responds to the fast re-
authentication challenge. The IKE_AUTH request message includes the EAP
message (EAP-Response/AKA-Challenge) containing UE's response to the
authentication challenge.
7) The PDN GW forwards the EAP-Response/AKA-Reauthentication message toward
the 3GPP AAA Server.
8) When all checks are successful, the 3GPP AAA Server sends the
Authentication Answer including an EAP success and the key material toward the
PDN GW. This key material shall consist of the MSK generated during the fast
re-authentication process. When the Wm interface (ePDG-AAA) is implemented
using Diameter, the MSK shall be encapsulated in the EAP-Master-Session-Key
parameter, as defined in RFC 4072 [10].
9) The MSK shall be used by the PDN GW to generate the AUTH parameters in
order to authenticate the IKE_SA_INIT phase messages, as specified in RFC 5996
[30]. These two first messages had not been authenticated before as there was
no key material available yet. According to RFC 5996 [30], the shared secret
generated in an EAP exchange (the MSK), when used over IKEv2, shall be used to
generated the AUTH parameters.
10) The EAP Success message is forwarded to the UE over IKEv2.
11) The UE shall take its own copy of the MSK as input to generate the AUTH
parameter to authenticate the first IKE_SA_INIT message. The AUTH parameter is
sent to the PDN GW.
12) The PDN GW checks the correctness of the AUTH received from the UE and
calculates the AUTH parameter which authenticates the second IKE_SA_INIT
message. The PDN GW shall send the assigned Remote IP address in the
configuration payload (CFG_REPLY), if the UE requested for a Remote IP address
through the CFG_REQUEST. Then the AUTH parameter is sent to the UE together
with the configuration payload, security associations and the rest of the
IKEv2 parameters and the IKEv2 negotiation terminates.
#### 9.2.2.3 Security Profiles
The profiles for IKEv2 and IPsec ESP as defined in clauses 8.2.4.1 and 8.2.4.2
of the present specification shall be used with the exception that ESP in
transport mode shall be used.
For PDN GW certificates, the certificate profiles as defined in clause 8.2.4.3
of the present specification shall be used.
#### 9.2.2.4 Enhanced Security Support
The UE and the PDN GW may support integrity protection and/or confidentiality
protection of user plane traffic exchanged over the S2c tunnel when the UE is
in a trusted non-3GPP access.This is achieved as follows: after the
establishment of the s2c tunnel, the UE or the PDN GW may trigger the creation
of a pair of IPsec child SAs as specified in RFC 4877 [2]. This may be
deactivated by the UE or the PDN GW by initiating the deletion of the
corresponding child SAs.
The profiles for IKEv2 and IPsec ESP in tunnel mode as defined in clause
8.2.4.2 of the present specification shall be used.
## 9.3 Network based Mobility
### 9.3.1 Proxy Mobile IP
#### 9.3.1.1 Introduction
Subclause 9.3.1.2 defines the security requirements and mechanisms for Proxy
Mobile IP (PMIP) when used in EPS. In particular, it addresses how PMIP
messages need to be protected within the Evolved Packet Core and how PMIP
protection needs to be handled if the PMIP messages originate from a trusted
non-3GPP network node.
#### 9.3.1.2 PMIP security requirements
_Trust model:_
  * For the reference points S2a (MAG in trusted non-3GPP access network) and S2b, S5 and S8 (MAG in ePDG or Serving GW), the MAG shall be trusted by the LMA to register only those Mobile Nodes that are attached.
_Requirements on mechanisms for securing PMIP messages on the reference points
S2a, S2b, S5 and S8:_
Security for PMIP messages between MAG and LMA shall be provided:
  * either by a chain of security associations in a hop-by-hop fashion according to TS 33.210 [6]. For each hop in such a chain, one security association per direction shall be used for all PMIP messages relating to any user, or
  * by one security association per direction for all PMIP messages relating to any user in an end-to-end fashion according to TS 33.210 [6] for the intra-domain case.
In order to protect PMIP messages, integrity protection is required,
confidentiality protection is optional.
_Strong access authentication:_
  * PMIP shall be used only in conjunction with AKA-based access authentication.
#### 9.3.1.3 PMIP security mechanisms
TS 33.210 [6] shall be applied to secure PMIP messages on the reference points
S2a, S2b, S5 and S8. TS 33.310 [12] may be applied regarding the use of
certificates with the security mechanisms of TS 33.210 [6].
NOTE: For the case of an interface between two entities in the same security
domain, TS 33.210 [6] does not mandate the protection of the interface by
means of IPsec.
# 10 Security interworking between 3GPP access networks and non-3GPP access
networks
## 10.1 General
The requirements and specifics for the security interworking of 3GPP access
networks with different non-3GPP access networks during idle mode and active
mode mobility are described in the following subclauses.
## 10.2 CDMA2000 Access Network
This clause captures all the security requirements for the interworking
between HRPD and E-UTRAN during idle mode and active mode mobility. The
present document assumes that no security context exchange is performed
between E-UTRAN and HRPD access systems.
### 10.2.1 Idle Mode Mobility
The security interworking specifics between E-UTRAN and HRPD during idle mode
mobility are defined in this clause which covers the UE idle mobility in both
directions, i.e. from E-UTRAN to HRPD and HRPD to E-UTRAN.
#### 10.2.1.1 E-UTRAN to HRPD Interworking
For pre-registration, the UE interacts directly with HRPD system to perform
authentication through the HS-GW and establish security association with this
system directly. The procedures are the same as in the case when the UE
connects directly to the HRPD access network except that it is tunneled over
the E-UTRAN/EPS. In these procedures, the UE follows the authentication and
key agreement procedure described in subclause 6.2. Tunneled signaling is
exchanged over S101 interface which shall be secured as described in clause
11.
NOTE: Network domain security as specified in TS 33.210 [6] and TS 33.310 [12]
applies to secure signalling between eAN/PCF in the HRPD access network and
MME in the serving network.
In the case when the UE is not aware of its movement from E-UTRAN to HRPD, the
UE may access the HRPD system directly without performing a pre-registration
through E-UTRAN/EPS system.
For UEs with an established emergency call the authentication is subject to
the requirements in clause 13.
#### 10.2.1.2 HRPD to E-UTRAN Interworking
The security interworking specifics of the UE idle mode mobility from HRPD to
E-UTRAN follows the EPS network entry procedures as described in TS 33.401
[16].
### 10.2.2 Active mode mobility
The security interworking specifics during active mode mobility between
E-UTRAN and HRPD are defined in this clause which covers the UE active
mobility in both directions, i.e. from E-UTRAN to HRPD and HRPD to E-UTRAN.
#### 10.2.2.1 E-UTRAN to HRPD Interworking
The UE behaviour is the same as in E-UTRAN-HRPD security Interworking for idle
mode mobility described in subclause 10.2.1.
#### 10.2.2.2 HRPD to E-UTRAN Interworking
The UE interacts directly with the MME to perform authentication with EPS and
establish a security association with this system directly. The procedures are
the same as in the case when the UE connects directly to the E-UTRAN system,
except that it is tunneled over the HRPD AN. In these procedures, the UE uses
EPS-AKA with the MME.
# 11 Network Domain Security
For all interfaces between network elements relevant in the context of the
present document,
\- TS 33.210 [6] shall be applied to secure signalling messages on the
reference points unless specified otherwise, and
\- TS 33.310 [12] may be applied regarding the use of certificates with the
security mechanisms of TS 33.210 [6] unless specified otherwise in the present
document.
NOTE: For the case of an interface between two entities in the same security
domain, TS 33.210 [6] does not mandate the protection of the interface by
means of IPsec.
# 12 UE-ANDSF communication security
## 12.1 UE-ANDSF communication security requirements
In order to address the security of communication over S14 reference point
(i.e. between UE and ANDSF), the following requirements apply:
\- UE and ANDSF shall be mutually authenticated;
\- The UE shall be able to verify that the ANDSF is authorized to serve it.
\- Signalling over S14 reference point shall be integrity protected
\- Signalling over S14 reference point shall be confidentiality protected.
\- Signalling over S14 reference point shall be protected against possible
replay attacks.
## 12.2 UE-ANDSF communication security solution
UE and ANDSF server shall establish a security association to protect the
messages of Access Network Info Request and Access Network Info Response. UE
and ANDSF server shall mutually authenticate each other. UE and ANDSF server
shall use the following mechanism to meet the security requirements as
specified in clause 12.1:
For ANDSF pull messages, PSK TLS with GBA based shared key-based mutual
authentication between UE and ANDSF server as specified by clause 5.4 of
TS33.222 [24].
For ANDSF push messages one of the following mechanisms shall be used:
\- If a PSK TLS connection has been established as a part of a pull message
and is still available, the available PSK TLS session shall be used.
\- Otherwise, PSK TLS with GBA push based shared key-based mutual
authentication between the UE and the ANDSF server shall be used. GBA push is
specified in TS 33.223 [29].
NOTE: If a TLS connection is released, it can only be re-established by the
client side, i.e. UE, even though the TLS session including security
association would be alive on both sides. TLS connection, in turn, is
dependent on the underlying TCP connection.
The ANDSF shall request the User Security Settings (USS) from the BSF and
deducts the authorization information for this UE from USS as specified in TS
29.109 [25].
For the authorization of the ANDSF server to the UE, the UE shall check that
the ANDSF that the UE discovered and is connecting to is on the configured
list of ANDSF names.
# 13 Security aspects of emergency call handling
# 13.1 General
NOTE: Support for EPS emergency calling is defined in the TS 23.402 [5]. Per
TS 23.402 [5], this release of this specification is limited to support of
handover of emergency sessions from Eâ€‘UTRAN access to HRPD access only. In
this release of this specification, handover of IMS Emergency Sessions from
HRPD access to E-UTRAN access is not supported.
Support for IMS Emergency sessions over an WLAN access is supported as
specified in subclause 4.5.7.2 of TS 23.402[5]. Rel-14 added support for
emergency services over trusted and untrusted WLAN for:
  * UEs with IMSI's that cannot be authenticated (for eg., unauthorized IMSI),
> \- UEs without IMSIs (UICC-less UEs).
# 13.2 Requirements for emergency call handling
If the UE is authenticated in E-UTRAN and has an emergency call established
and at that point attempts a hand over to HRPD, authentication and
authorization of the UE to HRPD is executed according to operator policy and
local regulatory requirements. If the HRPD network chooses to perform
authentication and authorization at the handover and either one of them fail,
then it is up to operator policy and local regulatory requirements whether the
UE shall be allowed to get service from the HRPD network.
If the UE has established an unauthenticated emergency call in E-UTRAN and
attempts a handover to HRPD, then it is up to local regulations and operator
policy if the UE shall receive service from HRPD network. E-UTRAN provides an
indication to HRPD access whether the UE has been authenticated in E-UTRAN or
not, as described in TS 23.402 [5].

and connection parameters, and generate a shared key, according to the
procedure described in this clause.The exchange of the connection parameters
and possibly the exchange of the IMEI of the UE are performed using a 3GPP
vendorspecific EAP method called EAP-3GPP-LimitedService, with messages called
3GPP-LimitedService-Init-Info and 3GPP-LimitedService-Notif. A list of 3GPP
vendor specific EAP methods is provided in Annex C.

# 14 Temporary identity management
## 14.1 Temporary identity generation
Temporary Identities (Pseudonyms or re-authentication identities) are
generated as some form of encrypted IMSI. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
(see ref. [40]) in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode of operation with 128-bit
keys is used for this purpose.
In order to encrypt with AES in ECB mode, it is necessary that the length of
the clear text is a multiple of 16 octets. This clear text is formed as
follows:
1\. A _Compressed IMSI_ is created utilising 4 bits to represent each digit of
the IMSI. According to TS 23.003 [8], the length of the IMSI is not more than
15 digits (numerical characters, 0 through 9). The length of the _Compressed
IMSI_ shall be 64 bits (8 octets), and the most significant bits shall be
padded by setting all the bits to 1.
e.g.: IMSI = 214070123456789 (MCC = 214 ; MNC = 07 ; MSIN = 0123456789)
Compressed IMSI = 0xF2 0x14 0x07 0x01 0x23 0x45 0x67 0x89
Observe that, at reception of a temporary identity, it is easy to remove the
padding of the _Compressed IMSI_ as none of the IMSI digits will be
represented with 4 bits set to 1. Moreover, a sanity check should be done at
reception of a temporary identity, by checking that the padding, the MCC and
the MNC are correct, and that all characters are digits.
2\. A _Padded IMSI_ is created by concatenating an 8-octet random number to
the _Compressed IMSI_.
A 128-bit secret key, Kpseu, is used for the encryption. The same secret key
shall be configured at all the AAA servers in the operator network so that any
AAA server can obtain the permanent identity from a temporary identity
generated at any other AAA server (see section 14.2).
Figure 14.1-1 summarises how the _Encrypted IMSI_ is obtained.
{width="4.229166666666667in" height="1.3534722222222222in"}
Figure 14.1-1: Encrypted IMSI generation
Once the _Encrypted IMSI_ has been generated, the following fields are
concatenated:
_\- Encrypted IMSI_ , so that a AAA server can later obtain the IMSI from the
temporary identity.
_\- Key Indicator_ , so that the AAA server that receives the temporary
identity can locate the appropriate key to de-encrypt the Encrypted IMSI (see
clause 14.2).
_\- Temporary identity Tag_ , used to mark the identity as temporary pseudonym
or re-authentication identity.
{width="4.146527777777778in" height="0.9791666666666666in"}
Figure 14.1-2
The Temporary Identity _Tag_ is necessary so that when a AAA receives a user
identity it can determine whether to process it as a permanent or a temporary
user identity. Moreover, according to EAP-AKA/EAP-AKA' specifications, when
the Authenticator node (i.e. the AAA server) receives a temporary user
identity which is not able to map to a permanent user identity, then the
permanent user identity (if the AAA server recognises it as a pseudonym) or a
full authentication identity (if theAAA server recognises it as a re-
authentication id) shall be requested from the client.
The last step in the generation of the temporary identities consists on
converting the concatenation above to a printable string using the BASE64
method described in section 4.3.2.4 of RFC 1421 [41]. With this mechanism,
each 6-bit group is used as an index into an array of 64 printable characters.
As the length of the concatenation is 138 bits, the length of the resulting
temporary identity is 23 characters, and no padding is necessary. Observe that
the length of the Temporary identity _Tag_ has been chosen to be 6 bits, so
that it directly translates into one printable character after applying the
transformation. Therefore, at reception of a user identity, the AAA server can
recognise that it is a temporary identity for EAP-AKA without performing any
reverse transformation (i.e. without translating any printable character into
the corresponding 6 bits).
## 14.2 Key management
A 128-bit encryption key shall be used for the generation of temporary
identities for a given period of time determined by the operator. Once that
time has expired, a new key shall be configured at all the AAA servers. The
old key shall not be used any longer for the generation of temporary
identities, but the AAA servers shall keep a number of suspended (old) keys
for the interpretation of received temporary identities that were generated
with those old keys. The number of suspended keys kept in the AAA servers (up
to 16) should be set by the operator, but it shall be at least one, in order
to avoid that a just-generated temporary identity becomes invalid immediately
due to the expiration of the key.
Each key shall have associated a Key Indicator value. This value is included
in the temporary identity (see _Key Indicator_ field in clause 6.4.1), so that
when a AAA receives the temporary identity, it can use the corresponding key
for obtaining the _Padded IMSI_ (and thence the Username).
If a temporary identity is sent to a client but then the user does not
initiate new authentication attempts for a long period of time, the key used
for the generation of that temporary identity could eventually be removed from
all the AAA servers. If the user initiates an authentication attempt after
that time using that old temporary identity, the receiving AAA server will not
be able to recognise the temporary identity as a valid one but it will be able
to recognize the type of temporary identity (pseudonym or re-authentication
identity), and it shall request the permanent user identity from the client
(if the temporary identity was a re-authentication identity, the AAA server
shall request first a pseudonym, and if it is not recognized, the permament
user identity) Hence, in order to achieve that permanent user identities are
used as little as possible, it is recommended that the encryption key is not
renewed very often.
The configuration of the keys could be done via O&M, as shown in the figure
below.
{width="3.2819444444444446in" height="1.4159722222222222in"}
Figure14.2-1: Key configuration via O&M
Handling of these secret keys, including generation, distribution and storage,
should be done in a secure way.
## 14.3 Impact on permanent user identities
User identities (permanent or temporary) are sent with the form of a NAI,
according to the EAP EAP-AKA/EAP-AKA' specifications, and the maximum length
of a NAI that we can expect to be handled correctly by standard equipment is
72 octets (see [44]). Moreover, this NAI shall be transported inside the User-
Name attribute of a RADIUS Access-Request, with standard length up to 63
octets (see [45]). Therefore, it can be assumed that the maximum length of a
user identity should be 63 octets (i.e. 63 characters).
Since the length of the temporary identity proposed in section 14.1 is 23
characters, the length of the realm part of any permanent user identity shall
always be 40 characters or less. This applies regardless of whether the length
of the username part of the permanent user identity is less than 23
characters.
NOTE: A temporary user identity is formed as a NAI with the pseudonym or re-
athentication identity as the username part and the realm.
Moreover, the permanent user identities should not begin with the character
resulting of the printable encoding transformation (see section 14.1) of the
_Temporary identity Tag_ used for EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA' pseudonyms or re-
authentication identities. This is needed so that at reception of a user
identity, the AAA server can determine whether it is a permanent or a
temporary user identity.
## 14.4 Acknowledged limitations
This mechanism does not prevent forging of temporary identities generated with
keys that are no longer maintained in the AAA servers. That is, an attacker
may form a temporary identity by concatenating the desired _Temporary identity
Tag_ and 132 bits of random information, and then applying the printable
encoding transformation (see clause 14.1). At reception of such temporary
identity in a AAA server, the following cases are possible:
\- The _Key Indicator_ may not correspond to any key (active or suspended)
maintained at the AAA server.
\- If the _Key Indicator_ corresponds to any of the keys maintained at the AAA
server, then that key is used for the de-encryption of the _Encrypted IMSI_ ,
but the sanity check over the padding, the MCC and the MNC would show that the
IMSI is not correct.
In any case, the AAA server shall interpret that the received temporary
identity was generated with a key that is no longer available, and therefore
it shall request the permanent user identity (if the received temporary
identity was a pseudonym) or the pseudonym (if the received temporary identity
was a re-authentication identity) to the client.
This could be exploited to perform DoS attacks by initiating a large amount of
authentication attempts presenting different forged temporary identities.
Nonetheless, the consequences of this attack should not be worse than the
already possible attack of initiating a large amount of authentication
attempts presenting different forged permanent identities.
## 14.5 UE behaviour on receiving requests to send the IMSI-based user
identity
When the 3GPP AAA server does not recognize a temporary identifier used by the
UE, the 3GPP AAA server requests the UE to send the IMSI-based user identity.
The UE can operate according to one of the following three alternatives.
1\. Ignore the Request: This alternative may result in deadlock situations
that prevent the UE from connecting to a valid network. If this alternative is
implemented, then there shall be a separate mechanism available for the user
to override the policy (for example to delete the stored temporary identifier,
which would result in using the IMSI-based identity upon the next connection).
2\. Prompt the User: In this alternative, the UE prompts the user during the
EAP authentication whether to send the IMSI-based identity to the network. If
the user denies sending the IMSI, then the authentication exchange is
cancelled.
3\. Always Send the IMSI-Based Identity: In alternative #3, the UE always
sends the IMSI-based identity when requested.
The decision is UE specific and outside the scope of this specification.
###### ## Annex A (normative): Key derivation functions
# A.1 KDF interface and input parameter construction
All key derivations (including input parameter encoding) shall be performed
using the key derivation function (KDF) specified in TS 33.220 [8]. This
clause specifies how to construct the input string, S, to the KDF (which is
input together with the relevant key). For each of the distinct usages of the
KDF, the input parameters S are specified below.
The FC number space used is controlled by TS 33.220 [8], FC values allocated
for this specification are in range of 0x20 -- 0x2F.
# A.2 Function for the derivation of CK', IK' from CK, IK
When deriving CK', IK' from CK, IK and the access network identity as defined
in clause 6 of this specification , the following parameters shall be used to
form the input S to the KDF.
\- FC = 0x20,
\- P0 = value of access network identity, as defined in 3GPP TS 24.302 [22],
\- L0 = length of value of access network identity (variable, depending on
access network type),
\- P1 = SQN âŠ• AK
\- L1 = length of SQN âŠ• AK (i.e. 0x00 0x06)
If AK is not used, AK shall be treated in accordance with TS 33.102, i.e. as
000...0.
The access network identity is defined separately for each access network
type. For each access network type, the access network identity is documented
in TS 24.302 [22] to ensure that UE and HSS use the same access network
identities as input for key derivation.
The input key shall be the concatenation CK \|\| IK of CK and IK.
The KDF returns a 256-bit output, where the 128 most significant bits are
identified with CK\' and the 128 least significant bits are identified with
IK\'.
# A.3 Function for the derivation of WLCP key from EMSK
When deriving WLCP key from the EMSK as defined in clause 7.2.3 of this
specification, the following parameters shall be used to form the input S to
the KDF.
\- FC = 0x21,
\- P0 = \"wlcp-key\" (i.e. 0x77 0x6C 0x63 0x70 0x2D 0x6B 0x65 0x79) ,
\- L0 = length of P0 is 8 octets (i.e., (i.e. 0x00 0x08).
The input key shall be the EMSK.
# A.4 Function for the derivation of MSK key for unauthenticated emergency
sessions over WLAN
When deriving MSK for Unauthenticated Emergency sessions over WLAN, the
following parameters shall be used to form the input S to the KDF.
\- FC = 0x22,
\- P0 = "unauth-emer" (i.e. 0x75 0x6E 0x61 0x75 0x74 0x68 0x65 0x6D 0x65 0x72)
\- L0 = length of P0 is 11 octets (i.e., 0x00 0x0B).
The input key shall be the IMEI of the UE.
###### ## Annex B (normative): Tunnelling of UE Services over restrictive
access networks
# B.1 Overview
This Annex specifies a mechanism for tunnelling of UE Services over
Restrictive Access Networks. Before using the mechanisms specified in this
Annex, the UE shall in accordance with normal procedures attempt to use
existing NAT/FW traversal mechanisms as specified in TS 23.402 [5], the main
body of this document, and if applicable TS 33.203 [34]. The exact procedure
depends on the UE, the access, the requested service, and operator policy.
Clause X.2 specifies a mechanism to achieve UE access to PLMN IP-based
services over restrictive firewalls in non-3GPP accesses. As only the
transport/encapsulation layer is changed, all protocol variants specified in
TS 23.402 [5] are supported and all functionality provided by ePDG/IKE is
available.
The mechanisms in this Annex are optional to implement.
Editor's note: It is FFS whether the mechanisms defined in this Annex should
be standadized by IETF or 3GPP.
# B.2 Service and media reachability for users over restrictive firewalls -
untrusted non 3GPP access
This clause specifies a generic mechanism to achieve UE access to PLMN IP-
based services over restrictive firewalls in non-3GPP accesses. The mechanism
is intended to be used in the case the tunnelling mechanism from section 8.2
does not work.
The UDP encapsulation layer is replaced with a TCP/TLS encapsulation layer on
port 80/443 that makes the traffic appear as HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the
firewall. To traverse HTTP proxies, the TCP/TLS connection may optionally be
setup with HTTP CONNECT The TLS profile as defined in TS 33.310 [12] Annex E
shall be used..
All protocol variants specified in TS 23.402 (S2b with PMIPv6/GTP and S2c with
DSMIPv6) are supported and all functionality provided by ePDG/IKE is
available.
Figure B.1: Protocol stacks for firewall traversal
**Legend:**
\- Only the transport layer is changed. Instead of UPD encapsulation, TCP/TLS
encapsulation on port 80/443 is used. Packets types (IKE, ESP, NAT-Keepalive)
are identified in a similar way as in IETF RFC 3948 [35].
\- As before, when PMIPv6 is used the ePDG terminates some of the IPv4/IPv6
messages.
Authentication, integrity protection, and confidentiality are provided by the
IKEv2/ESP layer. TLS is strictly used for firewall traversal (making the
traffic look like HTTPS) and shall not be used to provide security instead of
the IKEv2/ESP layer.
NOTE: The exact details of the TCP/TLS encapsulation layer are defined in the
corresponding stage 3 specification.
If the establishment of the TCP/TLS connection fails, this may be caused by
the presence of an HTTP proxy between the UE and the ePDG. The UE should try
to establish a TCP connection to the ePDG by using the HTTP CONNECT method
(IETF RFC 2616 [36]). How the UE gets the address of the HTTP proxy (manual or
automatic configuration) is out of scope of 3GPP.
