In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document

result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

as security requirements introduced in the present document derived from the
threats specific to UDM as described in TR 33.926 [4].
## 4.2 Security functional requirements on the UDM derived from 3GPP
specifications and related test cases
### 4.2.0 General
The general approach in TS 33.117 [3] clause 4.2.2.1 and all the requirements
and test cases in TS 33.117 [3] clause 4.2.2.2 related to SBA/SBI aspect apply
to the UDM network product class.
### 4.2.1 User Privacy Procedure
#### 4.2.1.1 De-concealment of SUPI from the SUCI based on the protection
scheme used to generate the SUCI
_Requirement Name:_ De-concealment of SUPI from the SUCI based on the
protection scheme used to generate the SUCI.
_Requirement Reference:_ TS 33.501 [2], clause 5.8.2.
_Requirement Description:_ The SIDF resolves the SUPI from the SUCI based on
the protection scheme used to generate the SUCI as specified in TS 33.501 [2],
clause 5.8.2.
_Threat References_ : TR 33.926 [4], clause E.2.2.1, Incorrect SUCI de-
concealment.
**TEST CASE:**
**Test Name:** TC_DE-CONCEAL_SUPI_from_SUCI_UDM
**Purpose:**
Verify that the SIDF De-conceals the SUPI from the SUCI based on the
protection scheme used to generate the SUCI.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Condition:**
\- UDM network product is connected in simulated/real network environment
including an AUSF and AMF.
\- Tester shall have access to the subscription data stored in UDR.
\- Tester shall record the SUPI from the UE.
**Execution Steps:**
**Test case:**
Tester shall capture the entire authentication procedure between UE and AMF
over N1, N12 and N13 interface using any network analyser.
1\. Tester shall filter the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message sent
from UDM to AUSF over N13 interface containing the SUPI.
2\. Tester shall compare the SUPI gotten from UE and the SUPI retrieved from
Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message.
NOTE: The tester may filter the Nausf_UEAutentication_Authenticate Response
message sent from the UDM/AUSF to the AMF over N12 interface containing the
SUPI, if the UDM and AUSF network products are collocated without an open N13
interface.
**Expected Results:**
SIDF resolves the SUPI from the SUCI based on the protection scheme used to
generate the SUCI.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Evidence suitable for the interface, e.g., evidence can be presented in the
form of screenshot/screen-capture.
### 4.2.2 Authentication and key agreement procedure
#### 4.2.2.1 Synchronization failure handling
_Requirement Name_ : Synchronization failure handling
_Requirement Reference:_ TS 33.501 [2], clause 6.1.3.3.2.
_Requirement Description_ : When the UDM/ARPF receives an
Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request message with a \"synchronisation failure
indication\" it acts as described in TS 33.102 [7], clause 6.3.5 where ARPF is
mapped to HE/AuC. The UDM/ARPF sends an Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response
message with a new authentication vector for either EAP-AKA\' or 5G-AKA
depending on the authentication method applicable for the user to the AUSF as
specified in TS 33.501 [2], clause 6.1.3.3.2.
_Threat References_ : TR 33.926 [4], clause E.2.2.2, Synchronization failure.
_Test Case_ :
**Purpose:**
Verify that synchronization failure is recovered correctly in the home
network.
**Pre-Conditions:**
Test environment with an AUSF. The AUSF or AMF may be simulated.
**Execution Steps**
1\. The AUSF sends an Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request message to the UDM
with a \"synchronisation failure indication\" and parameters RAND and AUTS.
2\. The UDM/ARPF performs steps 1-5 as described in TS 33.102, clause 6.3.5.
**Expected Results:**
The UDM sends an Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message with a new
authentication vector to the AUSF.
NOTE: The expected results would be that the UDM/AUSF sends an
Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message with EAP
Request/AKA'-Challenge for EAP AKA', or 5G SE AV for 5G AKA to the AMF, if the
UDM and AUSF network products are collocated without an open N13 interface.

is identical to the UE authentication information sent to/from the AUSF and
the AMF.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Condition:**
\- UDM network product is connected with an AUSF in simulated/real network
environment involving AMF, eNB.
\- The tester shall have access to all the authentication specific data sent
over N1 interface, N12 interface and N13 interface.
\- The tester shall have access to the UDM under test.
**Execution Steps:**
1\. The tester shall capture the entire authentication procedure and
authentication confirmation procedure over N12 and N13 interface using any
network analyser.
2\. the tester shall filter the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request message sent
over the N13 interface to retrieve serving network name.
3\. The ester shall filter the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message sent
over N13 interface to find the SUPI.
4\. The tester shall filter the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response
message sent over N12 interface to retrieve the Authentication result (EAP
success/failure for EAP-AKA\' or Result for 5G AKA).
5\. The tester shall filter the Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation
Request message to retrieve the authentication result and time of
authentication procedure sent from the AUSF to the UDM over N13 interface.
6\. The tester shall compare the serving network name stored in the UDM
against the serving network name retrieved from the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get
Request message and the serving network name retrieved from the
Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation Request message.
7\. The tester shall compare the authentication status stored in the UDM
against the authentication result retrieved from N12 interface.

retrieved from the Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Response message and the SUPI
retrieved from the Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation Request message.
9\. The tester shall compare the timestamp stored in the UDM against the time
of authentication procedure retrieved from the
Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation Request message.
**Expected Results:**
The storing of authentication status (SUPI, authentication result, timestamp,
and the serving network name) of UE at the UDM is verified.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Evidence suitable for the interface, e.g., evidence can be presented in the
form of screenshot/screen-capture.
