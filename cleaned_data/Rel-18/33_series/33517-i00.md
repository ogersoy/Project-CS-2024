# 4 SEPP-specific security requirements and related test cases
## 4.1 Introduction
SEPP specific security requirements include both requirements derived from
SEPP-specific security functional requirements in relevant specifications as
well as security requirements introduced in the present document derived from
the threats specific to SEPP as described in TR 33.926 [4].
## 4.2 SEPP-specific adaptations of security functional requirements and
related test cases
### 4.2.1 Introduction
The present clause describes the security functional requirements and the
corresponding test cases for SEPP network product class. The proposed security
requirements are classified in two groups:
\- Security functional requirements derived from TS 33.501 [3] and detailed in
clause 4.2.2.
\- General security functional requirements which include requirements not
already addressed in TS 33.501 [3] but whose support is also important to
ensure that SEPP conforms to a common security baseline detailed in clause
4.2.3.
### 4.2.2 Security functional requirements on the SEPP deriving from 3GPP
specifications and related test cases
#### 4.2.2.1 Security functional requirements on the SEPP deriving from 3GPP
specifications -- general approach
In addition to the requirements and test cases in TS 33.117 [2], clause
4.2.2.1, an SEPP shall satisfy the following:
\- It is assumed for the purpose of the present SCAS that an SEPP conforms to
all mandatory security-related provisions pertaining to an SEPP in:
\- 3GPP TS 33.501 [3]: \"Security architecture and procedures for 5G system\";
\- other 3GPP specifications that make reference to TS 33.50 [3]1 or are
referred to from TS 33.501 [3] Security procedures pertaining to an SEPP are
typically embedded in NF/NF service status discovery/subscribe/notify
procedures across PLMNs and are hence assumed to be tested together with them.
#### 4.2.2.2 Correct handling of cryptographic material of peer SEPPs and IPX
providers
_Requirement Name:_ Correct handling of cryptographic material of peer SEPPs
and IPX providers
_Requirement Reference:_ TS 33.501 [3], clause 5.9.3.2
_Requirement Description:_
The SEPP is able to clearly differentiate between certificates used for
authentication of peer SEPPs and certificates used for authentication of
intermediates performing message modifications.
_Threat References:_ TR 33.926 [4], clause G.2.2.1, Misusing cryptographic
material of peer SEPPs and IPX providers
_Test Case:_
**Test Name:** TC_CRYPT_MATERIAL_SEPP_IPX_SEPARATION
**Purpose:**
Verify that the SEPP under test does not accept raw public keys/certificates
by intermediate IPX-providers for N32-c TLS connection establishment. The
opposite is to be ensured as well: The SEPP under test shall not accept N32-f
JSON patches signed with raw public keys/certificates of peer SEPPs.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Conditions:**
\- System documentation of the SEPP under test, which details how raw public
keys/certificates of peer SEPPs are to be configured and how internal log
files can be accessed.
\- A second SEPP instance for N32 communication with the SEPP under test,
which allows for the creation of custom N32-f messages. This system may be
simulated.
\- Both SEPPs are to be configured with a raw public key/certificate of their
communication peer to be able to establish a N32-c connection.
\- Test environment with one node simulating an IPX-provider. This
functionality includes parsing N32-f messages, creation of JSON-patches for
message modifications and JWS operations, among others.
\- Two public/private key pairs representing IPX-providers. These
cryptographic keys need to be different from those of the two SEPPs.
**Execution Steps**
1.1 Both SEPPs are configured for N32-f communication via the simulated IPX-
system.
1.2 Both SEPPs establish a N32 connection with each other. The secondary SEPP
provides the IPX-provider\'s public key/certificate to the SEPP under test as
part of the _IPX security information list_ via N32-c.
1.3 While the N32 connection from the previous step is still active, the
tester attempts to establish an additional N32-c TLS connection using the IPX-
providers private key.
1.4 Based on the internal log files, the tester validates how the SEPP under
test handles the N32-c connection attempt.
2.1 Both SEPPs are configured for N32-f communication via the simulated IPX-
system.
2.2 Both SEPPs establish a N32-c connection with each other. The secondary
SEPP provides the IPX-provider\'s public key/certificate to the SEPP under
test as part of the _IPX security information list_ via N32-c.
2.3 The tester sends a N32-f message from the secondary SEPP via the IPX-
system towards the SEPP under test.
2.4 The intermediate IPX-system appends an arbitrary JSON-(NULL-)patch to the
N32-f message and signs it not with its own private key, but the private key
of the secondary SEPP. The modified message is then forwarded to the SEPP
under test.
2.5 Based on the internal log files, the tester validates how the received
N32-f message is handled by the SEPP under test.
Expected Results:
\- The N32-c TLS connection establishment using the cryptographic material of
the intermediate IPX-system fails with the SEPP to be tested (step 1.4).
\- The JSON patch signed with the peer SEPP\'s private key is discarded by the
SEPP under test (step 2.5).
**Expected format of evidence:**
Logs and the communication flow saved in a .pcap file.
#### 4.2.2.3 Connection-specific scope of cryptographic material by IPX-
providers
_Requirement Name:_ Connection-specific scope of cryptographic material by
IPX-providers
_Requirement Reference:_ TBA
_Requirement Description:_
Cryptographic material from IPX providers, i.e. raw public keys or
certificates, used to authenticate N32-f message modifications is only valid
for the N32 connection it is exchanged in. The SEPP under test shall not
accept N32-f message modifications signed by IPX-providers other than the ones
whose cryptographic material has been exchanged as part of the _IPX security
information list_ via the related N32-c connection.
_Threat References:_ TR 33.926 [4], clause G.2.2.2, Misusing cryptographic
material beyond connection-specific scope
_Test Case:_
**Test Name:** TC_CONNECTION_SPECIFIC_SCOPE_CRYPT_MATERIAL
**Purpose:**
Verify that the SEPP to be tested does not use cryptographic material from
IPX-providers other than the ones whose raw public key/certificate has been
exchanged in the related N32-c connection to authenticate N32-f message
modifications.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Conditions:**
\- System documentation of the SEPP under test, which details how raw public
keys/certificates of peer SEPPs are to be configured and how internal log
files can be accessed.
\- Test environment with one node simulating an IPX-provider. This
functionality includes parsing N32-f messages, creation of JSON-patches for
message modifications and JWS operations, among others.
\- Two public/private key pairs representing IPX-providers.
\- A second SEPP instance for N32 communication with the SEPP under test,
which allows for the creation of custom N32-f messages. This system may be
simulated.
\- Both SEPPs are to be configured with the raw public key/certificate of
their communication peer to be able to establish an N32-c TLS connection.
**Execution Steps**
1\. Both SEPPs are configured for N32-f communication via the simulated IPX-
system.
2\. Both SEPPs establish a mutual N32-c connection. As part of the _IPX
security information list_ , the secondary SEPP provides one of the prepared
raw public keys/certificates of the IPX-providers (KEY_A) to the SEPP under
test.
3\. Parallel to the N32 connection in step 1, an additional connection is
established between the two SEPPs. Within this connection, an alternate raw
public key/certificate of the IPX-providers (KEY_B) shall be exchanged.
4\. Within the N32 connection established in step 1, the tester sends an N32-f
message from the secondary SEPP towards the SEPP under test. The intermediate
IPX-system appends an arbitrary JSON-(NULL-)patch, which is signed with the
private key belonging to KEY_B, i.e. the one out of scope of this particular
N32 connection. The modified message is then forwarded to the SEPP to be
tested.
5\. Based on the log files of the SEPP under test, the tester validates how
the received N32-f message is handled.
**Expected Results:**
\- N32-f message modifications which have been signed by IPX-providers whose
information has not been exchanged as part of the related N32-c connection are
discarded by the SEPP under test.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Logs and the communication flow saved in a .pcap file.

_Requirement Description_ :
The receiving SEPP verifies that the PLMN-ID contained in the incoming N32-f
message matches the PLMN-ID in the related N32-f context as specified in TS
33.501 [3], clause 13.2.4.7.
The pSEPP checks that the serving PLMN ID of subject claim in the access token
matches the remote PLMN ID corresponding to the N32-f context Id in the N32
message\" as specified in TS 33.501 [3], clause 13.4.1.2.

SEPP under test is in possession of the N32-f peer information which contains
remote PLMN ID of the peer SEPP.
\- The tester shall have access to the interfaces of the SEPP under test and
the peer SEPP.
**Execution Steps:**
1\. The tester computes an access token correctly, except that the PLMN ID
appended in the subject claim of the access token is different from PLMN ID of
the peer SEPP, and then includes the access token in a NF Service Request.
2\. The peer SEPP sends to the SEPP under test a N32 message containing the NF
Service Request with the access token.
3\. The SEPP under test receives the incoming N32 message from the peer SEPP
and verifies that the PLMN ID in the subject claim of the access token does
not match the remote PLMN ID in the N32-f peer information in the N32-f
context.
**Expected Results:**
\- The SEPP under test sends an error signalling message containing the N32-f
Message Id and error code to the peer SEPP on the N32-c connection.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Logs and the communication flow saved in a .pcap file.
#### 4.2.2.5 Confidential IEs replacement handling in original N32-f message
_Requirement Name: Confidential IEs replacement handling_ in original N32-f
message
_Requirement Reference:_ TS 29.573 [6], clause 5.3.2.3
_Requirement Description:_
Based on the protection policy exchanged between the SEPPs, the sending SEPP
prepares an input for the JWE ciphering and integrity protection as an array
of free form JSON objects in the \"DataToIntegrityProtectAndCipher\" block
with each entry containing either a HTTP header value or the value of a JSON
payload IE of the API message being reformatted. The index value
\"encBlockIdx\" in the payload part of DataToIntegrityProtectBlock points to

system towards the SEPP under test. This message needs to contain at least one
information element that requires encryption according to the locally
configured Data-type encryption policy.
4\. The IPX-system modifies the N32-f message according to its configured
modification policy. The tester then inserts the encBlockIDx into a cleartext
IE in the modified N32-f message before sending to the SEPP under test.
5\. The IPX-system sends the modified N32-f message to the SEPP under test.
6\. Based on the internal log files, the tester validates how the received
N32-f message is handled by the SEPP under test.
**Expected Results:**

1) The NF sets up a TLS connection with the authoritative server for the
configured telescopic FQDN, i.e. the SEPP under test.
2) The NF sends a HTTP service request with the request URI containing the
configured telescopic FQDN within the TLS connection to the SEPP under test,
before which the tester inserts in the HTTP request a 3gpp-Sbi-Target-apiRoot
header set to the apiRoot of a NF producer in another PLMN different from the
remote PLMN.
3) The NF sends a HTTP service request within the TLS connection to the SEPP
under test, before which the tester inserts in the HTTP request a 3gpp-Sbi-
Target-apiRoot header set to the apiRoot of the NF producer in the remote PLMN
and changes the telescopic FQDN in request URI to be different from the
configured one.
**Expected Results:**
After step 2), the peer SEPP received the HTTP request from the NF through the
SEPP under test.
After step 3), the peer SEPP did not receive the HTTP request from the NF
through the SEPP under test
**Expected format of evidence:**
Evidence suitable for the interface, e.g. screenshot containing the
operational results.

### 4.2.5 Web Servers
_Requirement Name_ : Correct Handling of HTTPS Trust Anchoring
_Requirement Reference:_ TS 33.501 [3], clause 13.1.2
_Requirement Description:_ The SEPP maintains a set of trust anchors, each
consisting of a list of trusted root certificates and a list of corresponding
PLMN-IDs. Any given PLMN-ID appears in at most one trust anchor. During N32-c
connection setup, the SEPP maps the PLMN-ID of the remote SEPP leaf (server or
client) certificate to the associated trust anchor for the purposes of
certificate chain verification. Only the root certificates in the associated
list is treated as trusted during certificate chain verification. If the
remote SEPP certificate contains multiple PLMN-IDs that are mapped to
different trust anchors, then that certificate is rejected.
_Threat References:_ TR 33.926 [4], clause 5.3.3.7, Eavesdropping, clause
5.3.6.10, Insecure Network Services
_Test Case:_
**Test Name:** TC_CORRECT_TRUST_ANCHORING
**Purpose:**
Verify that the SEPP under test correctly implements trust anchoring when
setting up HTTPS (TLS) connections.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Conditions:**
\- System documentation of the SEPP under test, which details the methods
supported for TLS protection on N32 and how internal log files can be
accessed.
\- Two simulated, independent root CAs, denoted RCA1 and RCA2
\- A peer SEPP instance of a remote PLMN for N32 communication with the SEPP
under test, which may be simulated.
**Execution Steps**
1\. The tester selects two different PLMN IDs, denoted ID1 and ID2, e.g.
ID1={MCC=262, MNC=01} and ID2={MCC=262, MNC=02}.
2\. The tester configures two trust anchors in the SEPP under test, as
follows:
\- ID1 gets associated with RCA1 and
\- ID2 gets associated with RCA2.
3\. The tester generates a server certificate for the SEPP under test with
which it authenticates itself towards a peer SEPP. The peer SEPP is configured
to accept these certificates.
4\. The tester generates four TLS client certificates C1, C2, C3, C4 for the
peer SEPP, as follows:
\- C1 contains ID1 and is signed by RCA1 (or a subCA which is signed only by
RCA1)
\- C2 contains ID2 and is signed by RCA2 (or a subCA which is signed only by
RCA2)
\- C3 contains ID1 and is signed by RCA2 (or a subCA which is signed only by
RCA2)and
\- C4 contains both ID1 and ID2 and is signed by RCA1 or RCA2 (or a subCA
which is signed by RCA1 or RCA2).
NOTE 1: The expression \"contains IDX\" means that there exists a Subject
Alternative Name (SAN) field in the certificate that contains the value chosen
in step 1. Examples of the SAN field contents are
example.sepp.5gc.mnc02mcc262.3gppnetwork.org and
example.sepp.5gc.mnc01mcc262.exampleipx.ipxnetwork.org
5\. The peer SEPP is configured to authenticate itself using C1. If C1 was
issued by a SubCA, then the SubCA certificate is included in the certificate
chain which the peer SEPP uses to authenticate itself. The tester initiates an
N32c connection from the SEPP under test towards the peer SEPP and observes
whether the HTTPS connection succeeds, and, if not, documents the failure
reasons as shown in the log files of the SEPP under test.
6\. The tester repeats step 5, replacing C1 with C2, C3, and C4 iteratively.
7\. Steps 3 to 6 are repeated in order to test for reversed client/server
roles. Specifically, in step 3 the tester generates a client certificate
(instead of a server certificate), in step 4 the tester generates four server
certificates (instead of four client certificates), and in step 5 the tester
initiates the connection from the peer SEPP (instead of initiating the
connection from the SEPP under test).
**Expected Results:**
In step 5, the TLS (HTTPS) connection setup succeeds for the iterations with
C1 and C2 and fails for the iterations with C3 and C4.
NOTE 2: The iteration with C3 fails because the PLMN-ID indicated in the
client certificate does not match any of the trusted certificates in the
corresponding trust anchor. The iteration with C4 fails because the PLMN-IDs
indicated in the client certificate are not associated with the same trust
anchor.
**Expected format of evidence:**
The evidence is in the form of log file entries associated with eight TLS
connection establishment attempts, where entries for the cases with C1 and C2
indicate success, and entries for the cases with C3 and C4 indicate failure
and show the corresponding failure reasons, including TLS Error Alert 48
(unknown_ca).
