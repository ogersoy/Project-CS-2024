# Introduction
The present document has been produced by the 3GPP TSG SA to standardise
Lawful Interception of telecommunications. The present document describes
protocols and procedures for Lawful Interception based on 3GPP specifications.
These protocols and procedures cover both internal 3GPP interfaces (those
required to intercept communications and manage interception within a 3GPP
network) and external handover interfaces (those used for delivery of
intercepted communications to Law Enforcement, or handling of warrants).
Lawful Interception needs to be done in accordance with the applicable
national or regional laws and technical regulations. Such national laws and
regulations define the extent to which capabilities in the present document
are applicable in specific jurisdictions.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the protocols and procedures required to
perform Lawful Interception within a 3GPP network. The present document
addresses both internal interfaces used internally with a 3GPP network and
external handover interfaces used to handover intercepted communications to
law enforcement.
The present document describes the detailed targeting of communications in
each point of interception within a 3GPP network and the information that a
point of interception needs to be able to capture. Furthermore, the detailed
data formats for both the internal and external interfaces are also defined.
National regulations determine the applicable set of information that needs to
be handed over or excluded from handover to law enforcement for a given 3GPP
operator service.

## 4.1 Introduction
The present document provides details of the internal and external interfaces
required for a network operator, access provider and/or service provider to
provide the necessary information to a Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) required
to meet LI requirements. LI requirements for 3GPP networks and services are
given in TS 33.126 [3].
The high-level architecture that defines the necessary interfaces is specified
in TS 33.127 [5]. The generic high-level interception architecture is as
follows:
Figure 4.1-1: High-level interception architecture diagram with key point-to-
point LI interfaces
The generic high-level acquisition architecture is as follows:
Figure 4.1-2: High-level acquisition architecture diagram with key point-to-
point LI interfaces
The specification of the interfaces is split into two parts:
\- Internal interfaces used between an operator's network functions are
described in clause 4.2.
\- External interfaces used in communicating with a LEA are described in
clause 4.3.
## 4.2 Basic principles for internal interfaces
This clause lists the internal interfaces shown in clause 4.1, indicates the
protocol used to realise each interface, and gives a reference to the relevant
clauses of the present document that specify how the protocol is to be used
for the given interface.

report location every time the target location information is received at the
POI (including location update with no physical change of location).
When different location reporting types are applicable to a target due to
multiple warrants, then POI may be provisioned as if the reporting of all
location information occurrences at the POI is required, with MDF2 restricting
the delivery of location to the LEMF as per the provisioned information for a
warrant.
### 4.4.5 LALS Triggering
\- This option is used to activate the LALS triggered location service (TS
33.127 [5], clause 7.3.3.3) for the target.
The LIPF shall be able to provision the LTF associated with a POI or MDF2 with
the LALS triggered location service parameters provided in the warrant or use
a default set of parameters.
### 4.4.6 Roaming Interception
\- Stop interception when the target is roaming outbound internationally.
NOTE 1: The definition of international roaming for LI purposes could vary per
jurisdiction.
NOTE 2: The method used to achieve the roaming related service scoping is not
described in the present document.
# 5 Transport and Communications Protocol
## 5.1 General
This clause describes the protocols used for each of the interfaces at a level
which is agnostic of the subject service or network. Additional specific
fields or behaviours are given in the relevant parts of clauses 6 and 7.
## 5.2 Protocols for LI_X1 and LI_T interfaces
### 5.2.1 General usage of ETSI TS 103 221-1
Functions having an LI_X1, LI_T2 or LI_T3 interface shall support the use of
ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] to realise the interface.
In the event of a conflict between ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] and the present
document, the terms of the present document shall apply.
The LIPF and MDF2/3 shall maintain a mapping between internal interception
identifiers (XIDs) and external interception identifiers (LIIDs), as defined
by ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 5.1.2. In case of multiple interceptions for a
single target identifier, it is an implementation decision for the LIPF/TF
whether multiple XIDs are used (i.e. a one-to-one mapping between XID and LIID
is maintained) or whether the single XID is used and mapped to multiple LIIDs
at the MDF2/3. Clauses 6 and 7 give further details for specific networks or
services (e.g. minimum supported target identifier formats).
In the event of a request issued over the interface fails, or an error is
reported, the LIPF should raise an alert in the appropriate LI Operations and
Management (O&M) system. Further procedures (e.g. retrying a failed request)
are left to CSP policy to define.
A failure of LI shall not impact the target\'s or other users\' services.
In general, and unless otherwise specified, the function playing the role of
the NE (i.e. IRI-POI, IRI-TF, CC-TF, CC-POI, MDF2 or MDF3) shall:
\- Accept CreateDestination and ModifyDestination messages regardless of the
DeliveryType.
\- Reject ActivateTask/ModifyTask messages that contain destination
identifiers (DIDs) that reference Destinations that have not been created via
a CreateDestination message; Destinations shall be created before they are
used.
\- Reject ActivateTask/ModifyTask messages that do not result in at least one
valid DID for their DeliveryType (e.g. at least one valid DID for an X2
delivery destination for an \"X2Only\" Task). Additional DIDs for Destinations
of other DeliveryTypes (e.g. a DID for an X3 Destination for an \"X2Only\"
Task) shall be accepted, but a ReportTaskIssue message may be sent to indicate
the mismatch.
### 5.2.2 Usage for realising LI_X1
For the purposes of realising LI_X1 between the LIPF and a POI, MDF or TF, the
LIPF plays the role of the ADMF as defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] reference
model (clause 4.2), and the POI, MDF or TF plays the role of the NE.
In general, and unless otherwise specified, the ADMF shall:
\- When the provisioning of an IRI-POI/IRI-TF/MDF2 is needed to meet the
requirements of the warrant, send an ActivateTask (and subsequent ModifyTask
if/as needed) with the DeliveryType set to \"X2Only\" and the ListOfDIDs
containing at least one DID for an X2 or LI_HI2 delivery destination over
LI_X1 to each of the relevant functions.
\- When the provisioning of a CC-POI/CC-TF/MDF3 is needed to meet the
requirements of the warrant, send an ActivateTask (and subsequent ModifyTask
if/as needed) with the DeliveryType set to \"X3Only\" and the ListOfDIDs
containing at least one DID for X3 or LI_HI3 delivery destination over LI_X1
to each of the relevant functions.
When both the above are required to meet the requirements of the warrant, the
ADMF shall send each independently to each relevant function.
When it is required to cease interception, the ADMF shall send a
DeactivateTask message to each relevant function, unless the Task has already
been removed by other means (e.g. by the use of the
ImplicitDeactivationAllowed flag, see ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.1.2).
Other deployments compliant with ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] may be used subject to
local agreement.
### 5.2.3 Usage for realising LI_X1 (management)
For the purposes of realising LI_X1 between the LIPF and a triggered POI, the
LIPF plays the role of the "ADMF" as defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7]
reference model (clause 4.2), and the triggered POI plays the role of the
"NE".
### 5.2.4 Service scoping
The LIPF shall be able to provision the POI, TFs and the MDF2/MDF3 according
to the service scoping (see clause 4.4) applicable to a warrant as described
in clause 6.2.1.2 and Annex C of ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7].
If there is a need to explicitly identify specific CSP service types to be
intercepted by the task, the LIPF shall include the ListOfServiceTypes
parameter in the TaskDetails of the provisioning message sent to the POIs/TFs.
If no service type is provisioned, the POIs shall generate and deliver
applicable interception product for all services specified for the NF where
the POI is located as described in clause 4.4.2.
If there is a need to explicitly identify specific CSP service types to be
delivered by the task, the LIPF shall populate the ServiceType in the
ServiceScoping parameter in the MediationDetails of the provisioning message
sent to the MDF2/MDF3. If the LIPF includes the ListOfServiceTypes parameter
in the TaskDetails of the provisioning message sent to the MDF2/MDF3, the
MDF2/MDF3 shall ignore this parameter.
### 5.2.5 Usage for realising LI_T2
For the purposes of realising LI_T2 between an IRI-TF and a triggered IRI-POI,
the IRI-TF plays the role of the \"ADMF\" as defined in the ETSI TS 103 221-1
[7] reference model (clause 4.2), and the triggered IRI-POI plays the role of
the \"NE\".
In case the IRI-TF receives from the triggered IRI-POI an error in the answer
to a triggering message, the IRI-TF shall send a ReportTaskIssue message to
the LIPF. In such case, the failure of LI shall not impact the target\'s or
other users\' services.
Unless otherwise specified, an IRI-TF shall set the Product ID field in any
ActivateTask or ModifyTask message issued to a triggered IRI-POI (see ETSI TS
103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.1.2). The IRI-TF shall set the Product ID to the XID
of the Task object associated with the interception at the IRI-TF in order to
allow correlation of LI product at the MDF2.
Unless otherwise specified, the TF shall include the MDF2 as the X2 delivery
destination in the trigger sent using the ActivateTask/ModifyTask with
\"X2Only\".
When the IRI-TF determines that it is required to remove a Task at a
particular IRI-POI (e.g. having detected the end of a session) it shall send a
DeactivateTask message for the relevant Task to that IRI-POI, unless the Task
has already been removed by other means (e.g. by the use of the
ImplicitDeactivationAllowed flag, see ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.12).
When the IRI-TF receives a DeactivateTask message or ModifyTask message from
the LIPF, the IRI-TF shall send DeactivateTask or ModifyTask messages to all
applicable triggered IRI-POIs for all tasks associated to the Task object in
the message from the LIPF.
When the IRI-TF reports the status of a Task via a GetTaskDetailsResponse or
GetAllDetailsResponse, the IRI-TF shall also report the details of each
\'delegated\' Task that the IRI-TF is maintaining at an IRI-POI as a result of
that Task. The details are given using the DelegatedTaskStatus structure
described in Table 5.2.5-1 below, which is placed in the TaskStatusExtensions
element of the TaskStatus structure in the response (see ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7]
clause 6.4.2.2).

maintained by the TF at the triggered POI. M TaskStatus Copy of the last
TaskStatus information received from the triggered POI regarding the relevant
Task, if available. C LastTaskStatusTime Time at which the TaskStatus
information was received. Shall be present if TaskStatus is supplied. C
* * *
### 5.2.6 Usage for realising LI_T3
For the purposes of realising LI_T3 between a CC-TF and a triggered CC-POI,
the CC-TF plays the role of the \"ADMF\" as defined in the ETSI TS 103 221-1
[7] reference model (clause 4.2), and the triggered CC-POI plays the role of
the \"NE\".
In case the CC-TF receives from the triggered CC-POI an error in the answer to
a triggering message, the CC-TF shall send a ReportTaskIssue message to the
LIPF. In such case, the failure of LI shall not impact the target\'s or other
users\' services.
Unless otherwise specified, a CC-TF shall set the Product ID field in any
ActivateTask or ModifyTask message issued to a triggered CC-POI (see ETSI TS
103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.1.2). The CC-TF shall set the Product ID to the XID
of the Task object associated with the interception at the CC-TF in order to
allow correlation of LI product at the MDF3.
Unless otherwise specified, the TF shall include MDF3 as the X3 delivery
destination in the trigger sent using the ActivateTask/ModifyTask with
\"X3Only\".
When the CC-TF determines that it is required to remove a Task at a particular
CC-POI (e.g. having detected the end of a session) it shall send a
DeactivateTask message for the relevant Task to that CC-POI, unless the Task
has already been removed by other means (e.g. by the use of the
ImplicitDeactivationAllowed flag, see ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.12).
When the CC-TF receives a DeactivateTask message or ModifyTask message from
the LIPF, the CC-TF shall send DeactivateTask or ModifyTask messages to all
applicable triggered CC-POIs for all tasks associated to the Task object in
the message from the LIPF.
When the CC-TF reports the status of a Task via a GetTaskDetailsResponse or
GetAllDetailsResponse, the CC-TF shall also report the details of each
\'delegated\' Task that the CC-TF is maintaining at an CC-POI as a result of
that Task, using the mechanism described in clause 5.2.5.
### 5.2.7 Usage for realising LI_XEM1
For the purposes of realising LI_XEM1 between the LIPF and an IEF, the LIPF
plays the role of the ADMF as defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] reference model
(clause 4.2), and the IEF plays the role of the NE.
The IEF shall be enabled by sending the following ActivateTask message from
the LIPF.
NOTE: The terms identifier and identity are used interchangeably in clause
5.2.7.
Table 5.2.7-1: ActivateTask message for activating an IEF
* * *
ETSI TS 103 221-1 field name Description M/C/O XID Shall be set to a value
assigned by the LIPF. M TargetIdentifiers Shall contain a single Target
Identifier of type \"IdentityAssociation\" (see table 5.2.7-2) M DeliveryType
Set to \"X2Only\". M ListOfDIDs Shall give the DID of the delivery endpoint of
the ICF(s) to which identity association events should be delivered. These
delivery endpoints are configured using the CreateDestination message as
described in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.3.1 prior to the task activation.
M
* * *
The following Target Identifier Type is defined for the use of LI_XEM1. Unless
otherwise specified, use of any other Target Identifier Type (including adding
a target identifier more than once) shall result in the ActivateTask message
being rejected with the appropriate error.

The IEF may be reconfigured to send identity associations to a different ICF
using a ModifyTask message to modify the delivery destinations.
The IEF shall be disabled by sending the following DeactivateTask message from
the LIPF.
Table 5.2.7-3: DeactivateTask message for de-activating an IEF
* * *
ETSI TS 103 221-1 field name Description M/C/O XID Shall be set to the value

The LIPF should send one ActivateTask command to each IEF.
NOTE: The IEF may receive multiple ActivateTask messages conforming to table
5.2.7-1, each of which can be independently deactivated. The IEF shall remain
active as long as at least one valid Task remains active.
## 5.3 Protocols for LI_X2 and LI_X3
### 5.3.1 General usage of ETSI TS 103 221-2
Functions having an LI_X2 or LI_X3 interface shall support the use of ETSI TS
103 221-2 [8] to realise the interface.
In the event of a conflict between ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] and the present
document, the terms of the present document shall apply.
The xIRI and the xCC sent using ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] shall contain the
appropriate XID as received in the relevant LI_X1 provisioning message (or
LI_T2/3 triggering message, as appropriate).
### 5.3.2 Usage for realising LI_X2
The POI sending xIRI over the LI_X2 interface shall set the PDU type field
within the xIRI to \"X2 PDU\". (see ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.1).
Where a single xIRI is sent as a result of a network procedure (i.e. as result
of several signaling messages exchanged between the target UE and the
network), the POI sending the xIRI shall set the Payload Direction field (see
ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.2.6) based on the initiator of the network
procedure.
Unless otherwise specified by the relevant clause, the payload shall consist
of a BER-encoded TS33128Payloads.XIRIPayload structure. The payload format
(see ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.4) shall be set according to the relevant
clause of the present document (the value 2 is used for TS
33128Payloads.XIRIPayload).The TLS transport profile (see ETSI TS 103 221-2
[8] clause 6) shall be supported and used by default.
Unless otherwise specified, xIRI shall include the timestamp and sequence
number conditional attribute fields, with the timestamp value set to the time
at which the event occurred.
Unless otherwise specified, the \"Matched Target Identifier\" conditional
attribute shall be set to indicate what target identity was matched to
generate the xIRI (see ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.3.18).
Unless otherwise specified, the \"Other Target Identifier\" conditional
attribute shall be set with all other target identities present at the NF that
contains the POI (see ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.3.19).
Unless otherwise specified, the NFID conditional attribute (see ETSI TS 103
221-2 [8] clause 5.3.7) should be set to indicate the NF that contains the
POI. The NFID is defined as a unique identifier assigned to the NF by the
network (e.g. FQDN) per carrier implementation and referred to in the
following clauses.
Unless otherwise specified, the IPID (see ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.3.8)
should be set to indicate the POI (within the NF) that generated the xIRI for
the conditional attribute field.
### 5.3.3 Usage for realising LI_X3
The POI sending xCC over the LI_X3 interface shall set the PDU type field in
the xCC to \"X3 PDU\" (see ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.1).
The payload format shall be specified according to the relevant clause of the
present document.
Unless otherwise specified, the NFID conditional attribute (see ETSI TS 103
221-2 [8] clause 5.3.7) should be set to indicate the NF that contains the
POI. The NFID is defined as a unique identifier assigned to the NF by the
network (e.g. FQDN) per carrier implementation and referred to in the
following clauses.
Unless otherwise specified, the IPID (see ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.3.8)
should be set to indicate the POI (within the NF) that generated the xCC for
the conditional attribute field.
NOTE: ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] specifies in clause 6 a default profile which is
mandatory to support, but allows further profiles to be defined. In scenarios
where it may not be possible to achieve the necessary LI data rates based on
the default profile, alternative profiles may be considered (e.g. based on
UDP, multi path TCP or other protocols). Any alternative profile needs to
ensure that LI reliability, security and completeness requirements as
specified in TS 33.126 [3] are met.
### 5.3.4 Service scoping
When applicable, the POIs shall deliver the xIRIs/xCC to MDF2/MDF3 over
LI_X2/LI_X3 according to the service scoping as provisioned by the LIPF to
them (see clause 5.2.4).
### 5.3.5 Usage for realising LI_X2_LA
Functions having an LI_X2_LA interface shall use the protocols for LI_X2 as
defined in clause 5.3.2 to realise the interface with the following additions.
The LI function sending the message over LI_X2_LA shall set the Payload
Direction field in the PDU header to _not applicable_ (Direction Value 5, see
ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.2.6).
## 5.4 Protocols for LI_HI1
### 5.4.1 General
Functions having an LI_HI1 interface shall support the use of ETSI TS 103 120
[6] to realise the interface.
In the event of a conflict between ETSI TS 103 120 [6] and the present
document, the terms of the present document shall apply.
The representation of tasking requests shall be as specified in the present
clause.
Each request to intercept a particular identifier shall be represented as an
LITaskObject (see ETSI TS 103 120 [6] clause 8.2). Table 5.4.1-1 shows the
minimum details required for the LITaskObject to be valid.
Table 5.4.1-1: LITaskObject details

### 5.4.2 Service scoping
Functions having an LI_HI1 interface (i.e. the ADMF) shall be able to receive
the service scoping as applicable to the warrant from the LEA over the LI_HI1
interface (see clause 4.4).
Where TS 103 120 [6] is used to realise LI_HI1, and where the details in
clause 5.4.1 apply, the ServiceType field of the TargetIdentifier in a given
LITaskObject shall be used to identify the appropriate service scoping. For
each service scoping type defined in clause 4.4.2 that is required, the
appropriate dictionary entry defined in table 5.4.2-1 below shall be included
in the ServiceType field. If no service type is required to be provisioned,
the ServiceType field shall be omitted.

### 5.4.3 Location acquisition
When required for location acquisition, the warrant sent over the LI_HI1
interface will specify the delivery method using task flags populated as shown
in table 5.4.3-1. If the delivery method is HI2Delivery (via MDF2), the LIPF
shall ensure that the MDF2 (clause 7.3.5.6.1) is provisioned. Subsequently,
the LAF will use this information while processing location acquisition
requests received over the LI_HILA interface.

## 5.5 Protocols for LI_HI2 and LI_HI3
### 5.5.1 General
Functions having an LI_HI2 or LI_HI3 interface shall support the use of ETSI
TS 102 232-1 [9] and ETSI TS 102 232-7 [10] to realise the interface.
In the event of a conflict between either specification and the present
document, the terms of the present document shall apply.
### 5.5.2 Usage for realising LI_HI2
The IRI messages sent over LI_HI2 are structured as a header and a payload.
The header contains general information like LIID, timestamp, correlation
information (as for example defined in ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9]). The payload
contains intercept related information based on information that the MDF2 has
received from sources in the network, such as the IRI-POI as described in
clauses 6 and 7 of the present document. Details of the IRI messages can be
found in Annex A of the present document. Messages defined as passing over the
LI_HI2 interface shall be passed as the payload of the threeGPP33128DefinedIRI
field (see TS ETSI 102 232 -7 [10] clause 15).
If the LI_X2 contains the NFID conditional attribute (see ETSI TS 103 221-2
[8] clause 5.3.7), this shall be mapped into the PSHeader
networkFunctionIdentifier (see ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] clause 5.2.14 and ETSI TS
102 232-7 [10] clause 15.3).
If the LI_X2 contains the IPID conditional attribute (see ETSI TS 103 221-2
[8]), the EIPID parameter (see ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] clause 5.2.13) shall be
populated by the MDF2 with the IPID value.
### 5.5.3 Usage for realising LI_HI3
The CC sent over LI_HI3 is structured as a header and a payload. The header
contains general information like LIID, timestamp, correlation information (as
for example defined in ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9]). The payload contains content of
communication based on information that the MDF3 has received from sources in
the network, such as the CC-POI as described in clauses 6 and 7 of the present
document. Details of the CC can be found in Annex A of the present document.
CC defined as passing over the LI_HI3 interface shall be passed as the payload
of the threeGPP33128DefinedCC field (see ETSI TS 102 232-7 [10] clause 15).
If the LI_X3 contains the NFID conditional attribute (see ETSI TS 103 221-2
[8] clause 5.3.7), this shall be mapped into the PSHeader
networkFunctionIdentifier (see ETSI Ts 102 232-1 [9] clause 5.2.14 and ETSI TS
102 232-7 [10] clause 15.3).
If the LI_X3 contains the IPID conditional attribute (see ETSI TS 103 221-2
[8]), the EIPID parameter (see ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] clause 5.2.13) shall be
populated by the MDF3 with the IPID value.
NOTE: ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] specifies in clause 6.4 a transport layer based on
TCP. However, based on agreement between network operator and LEA, in
scenarios where it may not be possible to achieve the necessary LI data rates
based on the transport layer based on single TCP connection, alternative
profiles may be considered (e.g. based on UDP, multi path TCP or other
protocols). Any alternative profile needs to ensure that LI reliability,
security and completeness requirements as specified in TS 33.126 [3] are met.
### 5.5.4 Service scoping
The MDF2 and MDF3 shall be able to deliver the IRI messages and the CC to the
LEMF over LI_HI2 and LI_HI3 respectively, according to the provisioned service
scoping (see clause 5.2.4).
### 5.5.5 IRI Target Identifiers
The MDF shall populate the TargetIdentifiers field of the IRIPayload defined
in Annex A with all Target Identifiers available at the MDF. For all
Identifiers received in the LI_X2 \"Matched Target Identifier\" conditional
attribute (see clause 5.3.2), the MDF shall include the relevant Identifier
with the provenance set to \"matchedOn\". For all Identifiers received in the
the LI_X2 \"Other Target Identifier\" conditional attribute (see clause
5.3.2), the MDF shall include the relevant Identifier with the provenance set
to \"other\". For all Identifiers present in the xIRI payload, the MDF shall
include the relevant Identifier with the provenance set to \"observed\". For
all Identifiers present in the provisioning message received over X1, the MDF
shall include the relevant Identifier with the provenance set to
\"lEAProvided\". For all Identifiers present in the MDF that are not reported
as other TargetIdentifiers, the MDF shall include the relevant Identifier with
the provenance set to \"other\".
## 5.6 Protocols for LI_HI4
### 5.6.1 General
Functions having an LI_HI4 shall support the use of ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] to
realise the interface.
In the event of a conflict between ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] and the present
document, the terms of the present document shall apply.
### 5.6.2 Usage for realising LI_HI4
The LI Notification messages sent over LI_HI4 are structured as a header and a
payload. The header contains general information like LIID, timestamp (as for
example defined in ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9]). The payload contains the
administrative information such as notification. Details of the LI
Notification messages can be found in Annex B of the present document.
Where the LI_HI4 interface is present alongside an LI_HI2 interface or LI_HI3
interface, the LI Notification messages shall be transmitted along the same
connection as the IRI messages or CC. Where ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] is used for
LI_HI2 or LI_HI3, messages defined as passing over the LI_HI4 interface shall
be passed in the hI4Payload sequence.
The MDF2/MDF3 shall support generation LI Notification messages for at least
the following events:
\- Activation of an interception at the MDF2/MDF3 via LI_X1.
\- Modification of an interception at the MDF2/MDF3 via LI_X1.
\- Deactivation of an interception at the MDF2/MDF3 via LI_X1.
## 5.7 Protocols for LI_HIQR
### 5.7.1 General

The LDTaskObject may also contain the \"IncludeNCGIInResponse\" LDTask flag
(see table 5.7.2-4A). If this flag is present for such a query, then the
response shall contain the NR Cell Global Identity associated with the SUPI at
the time of association (see table 5.7.2-5).

Value Meaning IncludeNCGIInResponse A request for returning the NCGI in the
response.
#### 5.7.2.3 Response structure
The LI_HIQR request is used to generate a request to the ICF over LI_XQR (see
clause 5.8). The response received over LI_XQR is then transformed into an
LI_HIQR response.
LI_HIQR responses and updates are represented as XML following the
IdentityResponseDetails type definition (see Annex E).
Responses and updates are delivered within a DELIVER Request (see ETSI TS 103
120 [6] clause 6.4.10) containing a DeliveryObject (see ETSI TS 103 120 [6]
clause 10).
IdentityResponseDetails contain IdentityAssociation records. The fields of
each IdentityAssociationRecord shall be set as follows:
Table 5.7.2-5: IdentityAssociationRecord
Field Value M/C/O
* * *
SUPI SUPI associated with the provided identity. M SUCI SUCI associated with
the provided identity, if available. C 5G-GUTI 5G GUTI associated with the
provided identity, provided in the form given in the request (see table
5.7.2-4). M PEI PEI associated with the provided identity during the
association period, if known. C AssociationStartTime The time that the
association between the SUPI and the temporary identity became valid. (see
NOTE). M AssociationEndTime The time that the association between the SUPI and
the temporary identity ceased to be valid. Shall be omitted if the association
is still valid (see NOTE). C FiveGSTAIList List of tracking areas associated
with the registration area within which the UE was or is registered in the
lifetime of the reported association, if available. See clause 7.6.2.4 for
details. C GPSI GPSI associated with the provided identity during the
association period, if known. C NCGI NR Cell Global Identity associated with
the SUPI at the time of association between the SUPI and the temporary
identity. Shall be sent if the \"IncludeNCGIInResponse\" flag is set. C NOTE:
The AssociationStartTime and AssociationEndTime represent the lifespan of the
SUPI to 5G-GUTI association. When a SUCI is present, the AssociationStartTime
also represents the time of the SUCI\'s validity.
If no association is found which matches the criteria provided in the LI_XQR
request, then the LI_XQR response contains zero IdentityAssociationRecords.
Similarly, the LI_HIQR response contains zero IdentityAssociationRecords.
For responses or updates providing a currently valid SUPI to 5G-GUTI identity
association, the AssociationEndTime shall be absent. The AssociationStartTime
shall indicate when the 5G-GUTI became associated with the SUPI. The SUCI
field shall be populated if it was present in the IEF record for the
association (see clause 6.2.2A.2.1). The PEI and TAI List fields may be
populated as well, see clause 7.6.2.4 for details.
In the case of ongoing updates, the presence of the AssociationEndTime
indicates the SUPI to 5G-GUTI identity disassociation. Such updates shall only
happen when no new association is replacing the outgoing one.
The DeliveryObject Reference field (see ETSI TS 103 120 [6] clause 10.2.1)
shall be set to the Reference of the LDTaskObject used in the request, to
provide correlation between request and response. The DeliveryID,
SequenceNumber and LastSequence fields shall be set according to ETSI TS 103
120 [6] clause 10.2.1.
The content manifest (see ETSI TS 103 120 [6] clause 10.2.2) shall be set to

## 5.8 Protocols for LI_XQR
### 5.8.1 General
LI_XQR requests are realised using ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] to transport the
IdentityAssociationRequest and IdentityAssociationResponse messages (which are
derived from the X1RequestMessage and X1ResponseMessage definitions in ETSI TS
103 221-1 [7]) as described in Annex E.
NOTE: The terms identifier and identity are used interchangeably in clause
5.8.
### 5.8.2 Identity association requests
For requests with RequestType \"IdentityAssociation\" (see table 5.7.2-3), the
IQF issues an IdentityAssociationRequest message populated with a
RequestDetails structure as follows:
Table 5.8-1: RequestDetails structure for LI_XQR
ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] field name Description M/C/O
* * *
Type Shall be set to the RequestType value \"IdentityAssociation\" as defined
in Table 5.7.2-3. M ObservedTime Observation time as provided over LI_HIQR
(see clause 5.7.2). M RequestValues Set to the target identifier plus
additional information specified in the LI_HIQR request (see clause 5.7.2). M
Successful LI_XQR responses are returned using the IdentityAssociationResponse
message. Error conditions are reported using the normal error reporting
mechanisms described in TS 103 221-1 [7].
LI_XQR query responses are represented in XML following the
IdentityAssociationResponse schema (see Annex E). The fields of the
IdentityAssociationResponse record shall be populated as described in Table
5.7.2-5.
### 5.8.3 Ongoing identity association requests
For requests with RequestType \"OngoingIdentityAssociation\", the IQF shall
activate a request for ongoing updates at the ICF by sending it an
ActivateOngoingIdentityAssociationUpdates message populated as follows:
Table 5.8-2: ActivateAssociationUpdates message for LI_XQR
* * *
Field name Description M/C/O OngoingAssociationTaskID Unique identifier for
this request allocated by the IQF. M SUPI Permanent identifier for which
ongoing identity association updates shall be issued. M
* * *
The ICF shall acknowledge the receipt of the ActivateAssociationUpdates
message by responding with an ActivateAssociationUpdatesAcknowledgement
response (see Annex E) containing an IdentityAssociationRecord representing
the association active at the time the ICF receives the
ActivateAssociationUpdates message. If no such active association exists, the
ActivateAssociationUpdatesAcknowledgement response shall not contain an
IdentityAssociationRecord. Error conditions are reported using the normal
error reporting mechanisms described in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7].
When a request with RequestType \"OngoingIdentityAssociation\" is terminated
over LI_HIQR (see table 5.7.2-3), the IQF shall issue a
DeactivateAssociationUpdates message (see Annex E) with the appropriate
OngoingAssociationTaskID populated. On termination of the request, the ICF
shall respond with a DeactivateAssociationUpdatesAcknowledgement message.
While a request with RequestType \"OngoingIdentityAssociation\" is active, the
ICF shall generate an IdentityAssociationUpdate message every time the ICF
receives an IEFAssociationRecord or IEFDeassociationRecord over LI_IEF for the
relevant identifier. The message shall contain an IdentityAssociationRecord as
described in table 5.7.2-5, and the relevant OngoingAssociationTaskID. The
IdentityAssociationUpdate message is sent to the IQF over LI_XQR with the ICF
becoming the \"requester\" as defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 4.2. The
IQF shall respond with an IdentityAssociationUpdateAcknowledgement message.
## 5.9 Protocols for LI_XER
LI_XER records are realised using a TLS connection as defined in clause
6.2.2A.2.3, with records BER-encoded as defined in Annex F.
## 5.10 Protocols for LI_ST interface
### 5.10.1 Overview
LI_ST shall be realised using a dedicated separate instance of the
Nudsf_DataRepository service as defined in TS 29.598 [64] subject to the
following terms.
The LISSF shall adopt the role of the NF Service Provider as described in TS
29.598 [64] clause 5.2.1. The LISSF may be realised as a standalone function
or within the ADMF. In either case it shall meet the requirements set out in
TS 33.127 [5] clause 6.2.3.8.
An LI function may only store state over LI_ST using an LISSF identified by
the LIPF via LI_X0. The LIPF shall provide the necessary details for
connection, including the relevant apiRoot, apiVersion, realmId and storageId
values (see TS 29.598 [64] clause 6.1.3.1) and any necessary keys for
authentication.
### 5.10.2 Storage
When an LI function wishes to store LI state in the LISSF, it shall perform
the Record Create service operation as described in TS 29.598 [64] clause
5.2.2.3.1. Unless otherwise specified, the recordId shall be a randomly-
assigned UUID. The record metadata shall include at least the following
information as tag value pairs (see TS 29.598 [64] clause 6.1.6.2.3)
Table 5.10.2-1: Minimum information elements for RecordMeta structure

DID for the destination that the state is associated with, if applicable. C
* * *
Further details on the contents of the Record Blocks is given in the relevant
clauses.
The LIPF shall always be able to store records in the LISSF.
### 5.10.3 Retrieval
When an LI function wishes to retrieve records from the LISSF and knows the
RecordID of the relevant state information, it shall perform a Record
Retrieval operation as described in TS 29.598 [64] clause 5.2.2.2.2. If the LI
function does not know the RecordID, it shall perform a search as described in
TS 29.598 [64] clause 5.2.2.2.6 using appropriate search criteria. The details
for choosing search criteria are specific to each LI function and are
therefore given in later clauses specific to that LI function.
The LIPF shall always be able to retrieve records from the LISSF.
### 5.10.4 Removal
When an LI function wishes to remove records from the LISSF, it shall perform
a Record Delete service operation as described in TS 29.598 [64] clause
5.2.2.5.
The LIPF shall always be able to remove records from the LISSF.

##### 6.2.2.2.1 General
The IRI-POI present in the AMF shall send the xIRIs over LI_X2 for each of the
events listed in TS 33.127 [5] clause 6.2.2.4, the details of which are
described in the following clauses.
If the AMF receives one or more cell IDs in an N2 message (as specified in TS
38.413 [23]), the IRI-POI in the AMF shall report all of them.
The IRI-POI in the AMF shall only generate xIRI containing
AMFIdentifierAssociation records when the IdentifierAssocationExtensions
parameter has been received over LI_X1 (see clause 6.2.2.1). The IRI-POI in
the AMF shall generate records according to the value of the EventsGenerated
sub-parameter (see table 6.2.2-0B) as follows:
\- IdentifierAssociation: AMFIdentifierAssociation and AMFLocationUpdate
records shall be generated. No other record types shall be generated for that
target.

##### 6.2.2.2.2 Registration
The IRI-POI in the AMF shall generate an xIRI containing an AMFRegistration
record when the IRI-POI present in the AMF detects that a UE matching one of
the target identifiers provided via LI_X1 has successfully registered to the
5GS via 3GPP NG-RAN or non-3GPP access. Accordingly, the IRI-POI in the AMF
generates the xIRI when the following event is detected:
\- AMF sends a N1: REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the target UE and the UE 5G
Mobility Management (5GMM) state for the access type (3GPP NG-RAN or non-3GPP
access) within the AMF is changed to 5GMM-REGISTERED.

##### 6.2.2.2.3 Deregistration
The IRI-POI in the AMF shall generate an xIRI containing an AMFDeregistration
record when the IRI-POI present in the AMF detects that a UE matching one of
the target identifiers provided via LI_X1 has deregistered from the 5GS over
at least one access type. Accordingly, the IRI-POI in AMF generates the xIRI
when any of the following events is detected:
> \- For network initiated de-registration, when the AMF receives the N1:
> DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message from the target UE or when implicit
> deregistration timer expires; and in both cases the UE 5GMN state for the
> access type (3GPP NG-RAN or non-3GPP access) within the AMF is changed to
> 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.
>
> \- For UE initiated de-registration, when the AMF sends the N1:
> DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the target UE or when the AMF receives the
> N1: DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message from the target UE with deregistration
> type value of "switch off"; and in both cases the UE 5GMN state for the
> access type (3GPP NG-RAN or non-3GPP access) within the AMF is changed to
> 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.

##### 6.2.2.2.4 Location update
The IRI-POI in the AMF shall generate an xIRI containing an AMFLocationUpdate
record each time the IRI-POI present in an AMF detects that the target's UE
location is updated due to target UE mobility or as a part of an AMF service
procedure and the reporting of location information is not restricted by
service scoping. The generation of such separate xIRI is not required if the
updated UE location information is obtained as a part of a procedure producing
some other xIRIs (e.g. mobility registration). In that case the location
information is included into the respective xIRI.
The UE mobility events resulting in generation of an AMFLocationUpdate xIRI
include the _N2 Path Switch Request_ (_Xn based inter NG-RAN handover_
procedure described in TS 23.502 [4] clause 4.9.1.2) and the _N2 Handover
Notify_ (_Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover_ procedure described in TS
23.502 [4] clause 4.9.1.3).
The AMFLocationUpdate xIRI is also generated when the AMF receives an NG-RAN
NGAP _PDU Session Resource Modify Indication_ message as a result of Dual
Connectivity activation/release for the target UE, as described in TS 37.340
[37] clause 10.
Optionally, based on operator policy, other NG-RAN NGAP messages that do not
generate separate xIRI but carry location information (e.g. RRC INACTIVE
TRANSITION REPORT) may trigger the generation of an xIRI AMFLocationUpdate
record.
Additionally, based on regulatory requirements and operator policy, the
location information obtained by AMF from NG-RAN or LMF in the course of some
service operation (e.g. emergency services, LCS) may generate xIRI
AMFLocationUpdate record. The AMF services providing the location information
in these cases include the AMF Location Service (ProvideLocInfo,
ProvidePosInfo, NotifiedPosInfo and EventNotify service operations) and the
AMF Exposure Service (AmfEventReport with LOCATION_REPORT) (see TS 29.518
[22]). Additionally, the AMF Communication Service
(Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify service operation) may be monitored to
capture the location information in the scenarios described in TS 23.273 [42]
clause 6.3.1. Also, in the case of Mobile Originated LCS service invoked by
the target, the location information may be derived from a
Nlmf_Location_DetermineLocation Response to AMF (see TS 23.273 [42] clause
6.2).
The AMFLocationUpdate record is also used by LARF to deliver Location
Acquisition responses to MDF2, as described in clause 7.3.5.6. The IRI-POI in
the AMF shall not generate the AMFLocationUpdate xIRI when the location is
acquired as the result of a LARF request, as described in TS 33.127 [5],
clause 7.3.5.2.

##### 6.2.2.2.5 Start of interception with registered UE
The IRI-POI in the AMF shall generate an xIRI containing an
AMFStartOfInterceptionWithRegisteredUE record when the IRI-POI present in the
AMF detects that interception is activated on a UE that has already been
registered in the 5GS (see clause 6.2.2.4 on identity privacy). A UE is
considered already registered to the 5GS when the 5GMM state for the access
type (3GPP NG-RAN or non-3GPP access) for that UE is 5GMM-REGISTERED.
Therefore, the IRI-POI present in the AMF shall generate the xIRI
AMFStartOfInterceptionWithRegisteredUE record when it detects that a new
interception for a UE is activated (i.e. provisioned by the LIPF) and the 5G
mobility management state for the access type (3GPP NG-RAN or non-3GPP access)
within the AMF for that UE is 5GMM-REGISTERED. If the UE is registered over
both 3GPP NG-RAN and non-3GPP access, the IRI-POI present in the AMF shall
generate an xIRI containing an AMFStartOfInterceptionWithRegisteredUE record
for each access type.

#### 6.2.2.4 Identity privacy
The AMF shall ensure for every registration (including re-registration) that
SUPI has been provided by the UDM to the AMF and that the SUCI to SUPI mapping
has been verified as defined in TS 33.501 [11]. This shall be performed
regardless of whether the SUPI is a target of interception, and whether the
null encryption algorithm is used for the SUCI. The AMF shall maintain the
SUPI to SUCI mapping for at least the lifetime of the registration in order to
allow interception based on SUPI after the initial registration.
### 6.2.2A Identifier Reporting for AMF
#### 6.2.2A.1 Activation of reporting over LI_XEM1

IEF's parent AMF, unlike POIs there is no concept of provisioning an IEF with
target identifiers.
Upon receiving a valid activate task message over LI_XEM1, the IEF shall start
generating records as defined in clause 6.2.2A.2.
Upon receiving a valid deactivate task message over LI_XEM1, the IEF shall
stop generating records as defined in clause 6.2.2A.2.
#### 6.2.2A.2 Generation of records over LI_XER
6.2.2A.2.1 Events
The IEF in the AMF shall generate an IEFIdentifierAssociation record whenever
the IEF present in the AMF detects a change in association between a SUPI and
a 5G-GUTI for any UE registered with the AMF. The IEF shall send the
IEFIdentifierAssociation records to the ICF over LI_XER as defined in clause
5.9.
Accordingly, the IEF in the AMF generates IEFIdentifierAssociation records
when any of the following events are detected:
\- IEFAssociationRecord: Association of a 5G-GUTI to a SUPI, (this may also
include SUCI to SUPI association).
\- IEFDeassociationRecord: De-association of a 5G-GUTI from a SUPI.
NOTE1: The de-association of 5G-GUTI from a SUPI event record is only
generated if a new 5G-GUTI is not allocated to a SUPI to update a previous
association (e.g. at inter-AMF handover).
NOTE 2: As SUCIs are single use and only valid for a single authentication,
they are only valid at the single point in time when the association event is
detected and reported to the ICF by the IEF.
In addition, when an IEF is activated as per clause 6.2.2A.1, the IEF shall
generate associations event for all SUPIs which are registered in the AMF,
where those identifier associations allocated prior to IEF activation remain
current and are still available in the AMF (See NOTE 2).
NOTE 3: Only identifier associations which have been maintained by the AMF as
part of normal network operations will be available.
In the case where the IEF in the AMF detects that a REGISTRATION ACCEPT
message or a CONFIGURATION UPDATE (5G-GUTI) message as defined in TS 24.501
[13] has been sent by the AMF towards a UE, the IEF shall immediately generate
an IEFIdentifierAssociation record. This record shall be generated regardless
of whether the CONFIGURATION UPDATE (5G-GUTI) or REGISTRATION ACCEPT procedure
is subsequently successfully completed or not.
##### 6.2.2A.2.2 Association Events
For each association event, the IEF shall create an IEFAssociationRecord, as
defined below.

##### 6.2.2A.2.3 Transmission to the ICF
When activated (see clause 5.2.7), the IEF shall establish a TLS connection to
the ICF as given over LI_XEM1. If the IEF fails to establish a TLS connection,
it shall report an error over LI_XEM1 using the error reporting mechanisms
described in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] and attempt to reconnect after a
configurable period of time.
When a record has been generated as described in clause 6.2.2A.2.2, the IEF
shall encode the IEFAssociationRecord or IEFDeassociationRecord as a BER-
encoded IEFMessage structure, following the ASN.1 schema given in Annex F, and
transmit it to the ICF over the established TLS connection.
The IEF may transmit a keepalive request using the keepalive record defined in
Annex F. Upon receiving a keepalive request, the ICF shall respond with a
keepaliveResponse record containing the same sequence number used in the
request. The circumstances under which the IEF transmits keepalive requests is
out of scope of the present document.

#### 6.2.3.2 Generation of xIRI at IRI-POI in SMF over LI_X2
##### 6.2.3.2.1 General
The IRI-POI present in the SMF shall send the xIRIs over LI_X2 for each of the
events listed in TS 33.127 [5] clause 6.2.3.3, the details of which are
described in the following clauses. In the case where the SMF is part of a
combined SMF+PGW-C, the details of the events are specified in clause 6.3.3.2.
The IRI-POI present in the SMF shall also send a SeparatedLocationReporting
xIRI (as described in clause 7.3.4.1) when the IRI-POI provisioned in the
H-SMF detects that the V-SMF has sent location data via the HsmfUpdateData
service operation to the H-SMF that does not otherwise trigger an existing SMF
record type.
As specified in TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.6.1, a PDU session may support either a
single-access PDU Connectivity Service (referred to as a single-access PDU
Session) or a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service (referred to as a Multi-
Access PDU (MA PDU) session).
The details of the messages for single-access PDU sessions are provided below
in clauses 6.2.3.2.2, 6.2.3.2.3, 6.2.3.2.4, 6.2.3.2.5 and 6.2.3.2.6.
The details of the messages for multi-access PDU sessions are provided below
in clauses 6.2.3.2.7 and 6.2.3.2.8.
##### 6.2.3.2.2 PDU session establishment
The IRI-POI in the SMF shall generate an xIRI containing an
SMFPDUSessionEstablishment record when the IRI-POI present in the SMF detects
that a single-access PDU session has been established for the target UE. The
IRI-POI present in the SMF shall generate the xIRI for the following events:
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenario, V-SMF in
the VPLMN), sends the N1 NAS message (via AMF) PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
ACCEPT to the UE and the 5G Session Management (5GSM) state within the SMF is
changed to PDU SESSION ACTIVE (see TS 24.501 [13], clauses 6.1.3.3 and 6.4.1).
\- For a home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the HPLMN (i.e. H-SMF) sends
the N16: Nsmf_PDU_Session_Create Response message with n1SmInfoToUe IE
containing the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT (see TS 29.502 [16], clauses
5.2.1, 5.2.2.7, 5.2.3, 6.1.2.4, and 6.1.6.4).
If the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create response received from the PCF for the
target UE in response to Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create request includes PCC
rules in which the traffic control policy data contains either a routeToLocs
IE or trafficSteeringPolIdDl IE and/or trafficSteeringPolIdUl IE, then the SMF
shall include those PCC rules in the xIRI. These PCC rules correspond to
policies that influence the target UE's traffic flows (see TS 29.513 [88]
clause 5.5.3).

##### 6.2.3.2.3 PDU session modification
The IRI-POI in the SMF shall generate an xIRI containing an
SMFPDUSessionModification record when the IRI-POI present in the SMF detects
that a single-access PDU session has been modified for the target UE. The IRI-
POI present in the SMF shall generate the xIRI for the following events:
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenario, V-SMF in
the VPLMN), receives the N1 NAS message (via AMF) PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMPLETE from the UE and the 5GSM state within the SMF is returned to PDU
SESSION ACTIVE (see TS 24.501 [13], clauses 6.1.3.3, 6.3.2 and 6.4.2). This
applies to the following two cases:
\- UE initiated PDU session modification (see TS 23.502 [4], clause 4.3.3.2).
\- Network initiated PDU session modification (see TS 23.502 [4], clause
4.3.3.2).
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenario, V-SMF in
the VPLMN), sends the N1 NAS message (via AMF) PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
ACCEPT to the UE and the 5GSM state within the SMF remains in the PDU SESSION
ACTIVE (see TS 24.501 [13], clause 6.1.3.3 and 6.4.1). This applies to the
following case:
\- Handover from one access type to another access type happens ((e.g. 3GPP to
non-3GPP); see TS 23.502 [4], clauses 4.9.2.1 and 4.9.2.2).
\- For a home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the HPLMN (i.e. H-SMF)
receives the N16: Nsmf_PDU_Session_Update Response message with n1SmInfoFromUe
IE containing the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE (see TS 29.502 [16],
clauses 5.2.1, 5.2.2.8, 5.2.3, and 6.1.6.4). This applies to the following
three cases:
\- UE initiated PDU session modification (see TS 23.502 [4], clause 4.3.3.3).
\- Network (VPLMN) initiated PDU session modification (see TS 23.502 [4],
clause 4.3.3.3).
\- Network (HPLMN) initiated PDU session modification (see TS 23.502 [4],
clause 4.3.3.3).
\- For a home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the HPLMN (i.e. H-SMF) sends
the N16: Nsmf_PDU_Session_Create Response message with n1SmInfoToUe IE
containing the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT (see TS 29.502 [16], clauses
5.2.1, 5.2.2.8, 5.2.3, and 6.1.6.4) while it had received a N16
Nsmf_PDU_Session_Create Request message with an existing PDU Session Id with
access type being changed. This applies to the following case:
\- Handover from one access type to another access type happens ((e.g. 3GPP to
non-3GPP); see TS 23.502 [4], clauses 4.9.2.3 and 4.9.2.4) where the V-SMF is
used for the PDU session on the new access type only.
\- For a home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the HPLMN (i.e. H-SMF) sends
the N16: Nsmf_PDU_Session_Update Response message with n1SmInfoToUe IE
containing the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT (see TS 29.502 [16]) while it
had received a N16 Nsmf_PDU_Session_Update Request message with an existing
PDU Session Id with access type being changed. This applies to the following
case:
\- Handover from one access type to another access type happens (e.g. 3GPP to
non-3GPP) where the same V-SMF is used for the PDU session on both access
types.
\- For a non-roaming scenario, SMF sends a Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify request
to the NEF or AF for the target UE for the event \"UP Path Change\" related to
a corresponding subscription from AF (see TS 29.508 [90] clause 4.2.2).
\- For a non-roaming scenario, SMF sends a
Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo response to the NEF or AF for the target
UE in response to Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo request sent by NEF or
AF to SMF (see TS 29.508 [90] clause 4.2.5).
\- For a non-roaming scenario, SMF receives a Nnef_PFDManagement_Fetch
response from the NEF for the target UE in response to
Nnef_PFDManagement_Fetch request sent by SMF to NEF (see TS 29.551 [96] clause
4.2.2).
If the Npcf_SMPolicyControlUpdateNotify response sent to the PCF for the
target UE in response to an Npcf_SMPolicyControlUpdateNotify request includes
PCC rules in which the traffic control policy data contains either a
routeToLocs IE or trafficSteeringPolIdDl IE and/or trafficSteeringPolIdUl IE,
then the SMF shall include those PCC rules in the xIRI. These PCC rules
correspond to policies that influence the target UE's traffic flows (see TS
29.513 [88] clause 5.5.3).

##### 6.2.3.2.4 PDU session release
The IRI-POI in the SMF shall generate an xIRI containing an
SMFPDUSessionRelease record when the IRI-POI present in the SMF detects that a
single-access PDU session has been released. The IRI-POI present in the SMF
shall generate the xIRI for the following events:
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenario, V-SMF in
the VPLMN), receives the N1 NAS message (via AMF) PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE
from the UE and the 5GSM state within the SMF is changed to PDU SESSION
INACTIVE (see TS 24.501 [13], clauses 6.1.3.3 and 6.4.3). This applies to the
following two cases:
\- UE initiated PDU session release (see TS 23.502 [4], clause 4.3.4.2).
\- Network initiated PDU session release (see TS 23.502 [4], clause 4.3.4.2).
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenario, V-SMF in
the VPLMN), receives the N1 NAS message (via AMF) STATUS from the UE with the
cause values listed in TS 24.501 [13], clause 6.5.3 and the 5GSM state within
the SMF is changed to PDU SESSION INACTIVE. One of the cases where this
applies is of UE finding that the PDU session ID received in a PDU SESSION
MODIFICATION COMMAND is invalid.
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenario, the V-SMF
in the VPLMN) sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Response to the AMF
(see TS 29.502 [16], clause 5.2.2.4). This applies to the case where the PDU
session is released without any N1 or N2 messages (e.g. AMF initiates the PDU
session release when it finds that the PDU session is no longer associated
with the UE, see TS 23.502 [4], clause 4.2.2.4).
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenarios, V-SMF in
the VPLMN) sends Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify (see TS 29.502 [16],
clause 6.1.6.2.8) with RELEASED in the ResourceStatus IE (see TS 29.502 [16],
clause 6.1.6.3.1) to the AMF. This applies to the case where PDU session
release is neither initiated by a NAS message nor by
Nsmf_PDUSessionReleaseSMContext Request message (see TS 29.502 [16], clause
5.2.2.5).
\- For a home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the HPLMN (i.e. H-SMF)
receives the N16: Nsmf_PDU_Session_Update Response message with n1SmInfoFromUe
IE containing the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE (see TS 29.502 [16], clauses
5.2.1, 5.2.2.8, 5.2.3, and 6.1.6.4) from the V-SMF. This applies to the
following three cases:
\- UE initiated PDU session release (see TS 23.502 [4], clause 4.3.4.3).
\- Network (VPLMN) initiated PDU session release (see TS 23.502 [4], clause
4.3.4.3).
\- Network (HPLMN) initiated PDU session release (see TS 23.502 [4], clause
4.3.4.3).
\- For a roaming scenario, H-SMF in the HPLMN sends the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Release Response to the V-SMF (see TS 29.502 [16], clause
5.2.2.9). This applies to the case where the PDU session is released without
any N1 or N2 messages (e.g. AMF in the VPLMN initiates the PDU session release
when it finds that the PDU session is no longer associated with the UE, see TS
23.502 [4], clause 4.3.4.3).
\- For a roaming scenario, H-SMF in the HPLMN sends a
Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify (see TS 29.502, clause 6.1.6.2.17) with RELEASED
in the ResourceStatus IE (see TS 29.502 [16], clause 6.1.6.3.1) to the V-SMF.
This applies to the case where PDU session release is neither initiated by a
NAS message nor by Nsmf_PDUSessionRelease Request message (see TS 29.502 [16],
clause 5.2.2.9).

See Table 6.3.3-13 and clause 6.3.3.2.4. C
##### 6.2.3.2.5 Start of interception with an established PDU session
The IRI-POI in the SMF shall generate an xIRI containing an
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedPDUSession record when the IRI-POI
present in the SMF detects that a single-access PDU session has already been
established for the target UE when interception starts.
In a non-roaming scenario, the IRI-POI in the SMF (or in a roaming scenario,
the IRI-POI in the V-SMF in the VPLMN) shall generate the xIRI containing the
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedPDUSession record when it detects that a
new interception for a UE is activated (i.e. provisioned by the LIPF) for the
following case:
\- The 5GSM state within the SMF for that UE is 5GSM: PDU SESSION ACTIVE or
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION PENDING.
NOTE: The above trigger happens when the SMF (V-SMF in VPLMN) had not sent an
N1 NAS message PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND to the UE for a PDU session and the
SMF (V-SMF in the VPLMN) had previously sent an N1 NAS message PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT to that UE for the same PDU session.
In a home-routed roaming scenario, the IRI-POI in the H-SMF shall generate the
xIRI containing the SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedPDUSession record
when it detects that a new interception for a UE is activated (i.e.
provisioned by the LIPF) for the following case:
\- The H-SMF had not sent a Nsmf_PDU_Session_Update Request (n1SmInfoToUe: PDU
SESSION RELEASE COMMAND) to the V-SMF for a PDU session and H-SMF had
previously sent a Nsmf_PDU_Session_Create Response (n1SmInfoToUE: PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT) to the V-SMF for that PDU session.
The IRI-POI in the SMF shall generate the xIRI containing the
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedPDUSession record for each of the PDU
sessions (that meets the above criteria) associated with the newly identified
target UEs.

##### 6.2.3.2.7 MA PDU sessions
##### 6.2.3.2.7.1 General {#general-16 .H6}
In the present document, an MA PDU session will include two general types of
PDU sessions as defined below:
\- MA-Confirmed: This is an MA PDU session where the UE signals Upgrade
Allowed to MA and the network immediately upgrades the session to an MA PDU
session or the UE explicitly requests an MA PDU session (using a Request Type
of MA PDU).
\- MA-Upgrade-Allowed: This is a PDU session where the UE indicated that
upgrade to an MA PDU session is allowed, but the network does not immediately
confirm the upgrade. The network may at some later point upgrade the session
to an MA PDU session.
NOTE: The above terms are not defined or used in other 3GPP Stage 2 or Stage 3
specifications, but have been introduced here to clarify and distinguish LI
event reporting for the respective situations.
An MA-Confirmed MA PDU session may be established over a single access or over
multiple accesses. The establishment over multiple accesses may occur
concurrently or may occur at different points in time.
An MA-Upgrade-Allowed MA PDU session is established over a single access and
nearly all aspects appears to be an ordinary non-MA PDU session with the key
difference that the network may upgrade the session to an MA-confirmed MA PDU
session.
##### 6.2.3.2.7.2 MA PDU session establishment {#ma-pdu-session-establishment
.H6}
The IRI-POI in the SMF shall generate an xIRI containing an
SMFMAPDUSessionEstablishment record when the IRI-POI present in the SMF
detects that a PDU session has been established for the target UE that is an
MA PDU session (Request Type set to MA PDU session or upgraded at
establishment), or where the upgrade allowed parameter is set to upgrade
allowed and session is established as an ordinary PDU session (not upgraded at
establishment, but may occur later on). The IRI-POI present in the SMF shall
generate the xIRI for the following events:
\- For a non-roaming scenario , the SMF sends the N1 NAS message (via AMF) PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT to the UE for a new PDU session and the 5G
Session Management (5GSM) state within the SMF is changed to PDU SESSION
ACTIVE (see TS 24.501 [13], clause 6.1.3.3 and 6.4.1) in response to a PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST received along with:
\- PDU Session ID which does not identify an existing PDU session, and
\- Request Type = MA PDU request, or
\- Request Type = initial request and MA PDU session information set to \"MA
PDU session network upgrade is allowed\", with either upgrade occuring at
establishment or upgrade does not occur at establishment but may occur later.
\- For a home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the HPLMN (i.e. H-SMF) sends
the N16: Nsmf_PDU_Session_Create Response message with n1SmInfoToUe IE
containing the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT (see TS 29.502 [16], clauses
5.2.1, 5.2.2.7, 5.2.3, and 6.1.6) for a new PDU session in response to a PDU
SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST received along with:
\- PDU Session ID which does not identify an existing PDU session, and
\- Request Type = MA PDU request, or
\- Request Type = initial request and MA PDU session information set to \"MA
PDU session network upgrade is allowed\", with either upgrade occuring at
establishment or upgrade does not occur at establishment but may occur later.
If the Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create response received from the PCF for the
target UE in response to Npcf_SMPolicyControl_Create request includes PCC
rules in which the traffic control policy data contains either a routeToLocs
IE or trafficSteeringPolIdDl IE and/or trafficSteeringPolIdUl IE, then the SMF
shall include those PCC rules in the xIRI. These PCC rules correspond to
policies that influence the target UE's traffic flows (see TS 29.513 [88]
clause 5.5.3).

##### 6.2.3.2.7.3 MA PDU session modification {#ma-pdu-session-modification
.H6}
The IRI-POI in the SMF shall generate an xIRI containing an
SMFMAPDUSessionModification record when the IRI-POI present in the SMF detects
that an MA PDU session has been modified for the target UE. The IRI-POI
present in the SMF shall generate the xIRI for the following events:
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenario, V-SMF in
the VPLMN), receives the N1 NAS message (via AMF) PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMPLETE from the UE and the 5GSM state within the SMF is returned to PDU
SESSION ACTIVE (see TS 24.501 [13], clauses 6.1.3.3 and 6.4.2). This applies
to the following cases for an MA-Upgrade-Allowed PDU session:
\- UE initiated MA PDU session modification (see TS 23.502 [4], clause
4.22.8.2).
\- Network initiated MA PDU session modification (see TS 23.502 [4], clause
4.22.8.2).
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenario, V-SMF in
the VPLMN), receives the N1 NAS message (via AMF) PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE
from the UE in response to a PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message containing an
Access type IE identifying a single access to be released of an MA PDU session
which was established over both accesses and the 5GSM state within the SMF
remains in the PDU SESSION ACTIVE. This applies to the following case:
\- A single access type is released from an MA PDU session, but the MA PDU
session continues.
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenario, V-SMF in
the VPLMN), sends the N1 NAS message (via AMF) PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
ACCEPT to the UE and the 5GSM state within the SMF remains in the PDU SESSION
ACTIVE (see TS 24.501 [13], clauses 6.1.3.3 and 6.4.1). This applies to the
following cases:
\- Handover from one access type to another access type happens (e.g. 3GPP to
non-3GPP) for an MA-Upgrade-Allowed MA PDU session (see TS 23.502 [4], clauses
4.9.2.3 and 4.9.2.4).
\- MA PDU Session establishment over second access type.
\- For a home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the HPLMN (i.e. H-SMF)
receives the N16: Nsmf_PDU_Session_Update Response message with n1SmInfoFromUe
IE containing the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE (see TS 29.502 [16] ,
clauses 5.2.1, 5.2.2.8, 5.2.3, and 6.1.6). This applies to the following cases
for an MA-Upgrade-Allowed PDU session:
\- UE initiated MA PDU session modification (see TS 23.502 [4], clause
4.22.8.3).
\- Network (VPLMN) initiated MA PDU session modification (see TS 23.502 [4],
clause 4.22.8.3).
\- Network (HPLMN) initiated MA PDU session modification (see TS 23.502 [4],
clause 4.22.8.3).
\- For a non-roaming scenario, SMF sends a Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify request
to the NEF or AF for the target UE for the event \"UP Path Change\" related to
a corresponding subscription from AF (see TS 29.508 [90] clause 4.2.2).
\- For a non-roaming scenario, SMF sends a
Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo response to the NEF or AF for the target
UE in response to Nsmf_EventExposure_AppRelocationInfo request sent by NEF or
AF to SMF (see TS 29.508 [90] clause 4.2.5).
\- For a non-roaming scenario, SMF receives a Nnef_PFDManagement_Fetch
response from the NEF for the target UE in response to
Nnef_PFDManagement_Fetch request sent by SMF to NEF (see TS 29.551 [96] clause
4.2.2).
\- For a home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the HPLMN (i.e. H-SMF)
receives the N16: Nsmf_PDU_Session_Update Response message with n1SmInfoFromUe
IE containing the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE message, a response to a PDU
SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message containing an Access type IE identifying a
single access to be released of an MA PDU session which was established over
both accesses and the 5GSM state within the SMF remains in the PDU SESSION
ACTIVE. This applies to the following cases:
\- A single access type is released from an MA PDU session, but the MA PDU
session continues.
\- For a home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the HPLMN (i.e. H-SMF) sends
the N16: Nsmf_PDU_Session_Create Response message with n1SmInfoToUe IE
containing the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT (see TS 29.502 [16], clauses
5.2.1, 5.2.2.8, 5.2.3, and 6.1.6) while it had received an N16
Nsmf_PDU_Session_Create request message with an existing PDU Session Id with
access type being changed. This applies to the following cases:
\- Handover from one access type to another access type happens (e.g. 3GPP to
non-3GPP) for an MA-Upgrade-Allowed PDU session (see TS 23.502 [4], clauses
4.9.2.3 and 4.9.2.4). In this case, the V-SMF is used for the PDU session on
the new access type only.
\- MA PDU Session establishment over second access type.
\- For a home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the HPLMN (i.e. H-SMF) sends
the N16: Nsmf_PDU_Session_Update Response message with n1SmInfoToUe IE
containing the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT (see TS 29.502 [16]) while it
had received a N16 Nsmf_PDU_Session_Update Request message with an existing
PDU Session Id with access type being changed. This applies to the following
cases:
\- Handover from one access type to another access type happens (e.g. 3GPP to
non-3GPP) where the same V-SMF is used for the PDU session on both access
types.
\- MA PDU Session establishment over second access type.
For a non-roaming scenario, SMF sends a Npcf_SMPolicyControlUpdateNotify
response to the PCF for the target UE in response to an
Npcf_SMPolicyControlUpdateNotify request sent by PCF to SMF including PCC
rules which traffic control policy data contains either a routeToLocs IE or
trafficSteeringPolIdDl IE and/or trafficSteeringPolIdUl IE. These PCC rules
correspond to policies that influence the target UE's traffic flows (see TS
29.513 [88] clause 5.5.3).

##### 6.2.3.2.7.4 MA PDU session release {#ma-pdu-session-release .H6}
The IRI-POI in the SMF shall generate an xIRI containing an
SMFMAPDUSessionRelease record when the IRI-POI present in the SMF detects that
an MA PDU session has been released. The IRI-POI present in the SMF shall
generate the xIRI for the following events:
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenario, V-SMF in
the VPLMN), receives the N1 NAS message (via AMF) PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE
from the UE and the 5GSM state within the SMF is changed to PDU SESSION
INACTIVE (see TS 24.501 [13], clauses 6.1.3.3 and 6.4.3) for a PDU session
that is either MA-Confirmed or MA-Upgrade-Allowed. This applies to the
following two cases:
\- UE initiated MA PDU session release (see TS 23.502 [4], clause 4.22.10.2).
\- Network initiated MA PDU session release (see TS 23.502 [4], clause
4.22.10.2).
\- For a roaming scenario, V-SMF in the VPLMN receives the N1 NAS message (via
AMF) PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE from the UE and the 5GSM state within the
V-SMF is changed to PDU SESSION INACTIVE (see TS 24.501 [13], clauses 6.1.3.3
and 6.4.3) for a PDU session that is either MA-Confirmed or MA-Upgrade-
Allowed. This applies to the following two cases:
\- UE initiated PDU session release of a single access for an MA PDU session;
(VPLMN considers MA PDU session fully released while HPLMN considers MA PDU
session active).
\- Network initiated PDU session release of a single access for an MA PDU
session; (VPLMN considers MA PDU session fully released while HPLMN considers
MA PDU session active).

the VPLMN), receives the N1 NAS message (via AMF) STATUS from the UE with the
cause values listed in TS 24.501 [13], clause 6.5.3 and the 5GSM state within
the SMF is changed to PDU SESSION INACTIVE for a PDU session that is either
MA-Confirmed or MA-Upgrade-Allowed. One of the cases where this applies is of
UE finding that the PDU session ID received in a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION
COMMAND is invalid.
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenario, the V-SMF
in the VPLMN) sends the Nsmf_PDUSession_ReleaseSMContext Response to the AMF
(see TS 29.502 [16], clause 5.2.2.4) for a PDU session that is either MA-
Confirmed or MA-Upgrade-Allowed. This applies to the case where the MA PDU
session is released without any N1 or N2 messages (e.g. AMF initiates the PDU
session release when it finds that the PDU session is no longer associated
with the UE, see TS 23.502 [4], clause 4.2.2.4).
\- For a non-roaming scenario, the SMF (or for a roaming scenarios, V-SMF in
the VPLMN) sends Nsmf_PDUSession_SMContextStatusNotify (see TS 29.502, clause
6.1.6.2.8) with RELEASED in the ResourceStatus IE (see TS 29.502 [16], clause
6.1.6.3.1) to the AMF for a PDU session that is either MA-Confirmed or MA-
Upgrade-Allowed. This applies to the case where MA PDU session release is
neither initiated by a NAS message nor by Nsmf_PDUSessionReleaseContext
Request message (see TS 29.502 [16], clause 5.2.2.5).
\- For a home-routed roaming scenario, the SMF in the HPLMN (i.e. H-SMF)
receives the N16: Nsmf_PDU_Session_Update Response message with n1SmInfoFromUe
IE containing the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMPLETE (see TS 29.502 [16], clauses
5.2.1, 5.2.2.8, 5.2.3, and 6.1.6) from the V-SMF. This applies to the
following three cases for an MA PDU session that is either MA-Confirmed or MA-
Upgrade-Allowed:
\- UE initiated PDU session release (see TS 23.502 [4], clause 4.22.10.3).
\- Network (VPLMN) initiated PDU session release (see TS 23.502 [4], clause
4.22.10.3).
\- Network (HPLMN) initiated PDU session release (see TS 23.502 [4], clause
4.22.10.3).
\- For a roaming scenario, H-SMF in the HPLMN sends the
Nsmf_PDUSession_Release Response to the V-SMF (see TS 29.502 [16], clause
5.2.2.9) for a PDU session that is either MA-Confirmed or MA-Upgrade-Allowed.
This applies to the case where the MA PDU session is released without any N1
or N2 messages (e.g. AMF in the VPLMN initiates the PDU session release when
it finds that the PDU session is no longer associated with the UE, see TS
23.502 [4], clause 4.3.4.3).
\- For a roaming scenario, H-SMF in the HPLMN Nsmf_PDUSession_StatusNotify
(see TS 29.502 [16], clause 6.1.6.2.17) with RELEASED in the ResourceStatus IE
(see TS 29.502 [16], clause 6.1.6.3.1) to the V-SMF for a PDU session that is
either MA-Confirmed or MA-Upgrade-Allowed. This applies to the case where MA
PDU session release is neither initiated by a NAS message nor by
Nsmf_PDUSessionRelease Request message (see TS 29.502 [16], clause 5.2.2.9).

##### 6.2.3.2.7.5 Start of interception with an established MA PDU session
{#start-of-interception-with-an-established-ma-pdu-session .H6}
The IRI-POI in the SMF shall generate an xIRI containing an
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedMAPDUSession record when the IRI-POI
present in the SMF detects that a MA PDU session has already been established
for the target UE when interception starts.
In a non-roaming scenario, the IRI-POI in the SMF (or in a roaming scenario,
the IRI-POI in the V-SMF in the VPLMN) shall generate the xIRI containing the
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedMAPDUSession record when it detects that
a new interception for a UE is activated (i.e. provisioned by the LIPF) for
the following case for an MA PDU session that is either MA-Confirmed or MA-
Upgrade-Allowed:
\- The 5GSM state within the SMF for that UE is 5GSM: PDU SESSION ACTIVE or
PDU SESSION MODIFICATION PENDING.
NOTE: The above trigger happens when the SMF (V-SMF in VPLMN) had not sent an
N1 NAS message PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND to the UE to release the entire MA
PDU session and the SMF (V-SMF in the VPLMN) had previously sent an N1 NAS
message PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT to that UE for the same MA PDU
session.
In a home-routed roaming scenario, the IRI-POI in the H-SMF shall generate the
xIRI containing the SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedMAPDUSession record
when it detects that a new interception for a UE is activated (i.e.
provisioned by the LIPF) for the following case for an MA PDU session that is
either MA-Confirmed or MA-Upgrade-Allowed:
\- The H-SMF had not sent an Nsmf_PDU_Session_Update Request (n1SmInfoToUe:
PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND to release the entire MA PDU session) to the V-SMF
for a PDU session and H-SMF had previously sent an Nsmf_PDU_Session_Create
Response (n1SmInfoToUE: PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT) to the V-SMF for
that PDU session.
The IRI-POI in the SMF shall generate the xIRI containing the
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedMAPDUSession record for each of the MA
PDU sessions (that meets the above criteria) associated with the newly
identified target UEs.
The IRI-POI present in the SMF generating an xIRI containing a
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedMAPDUSession record shall set the Payload
Direction field in the PDU header to not applicable (Direction Value 5, see
ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.2.6).

##### 6.2.3.2.8 PDU to MA PDU session modification
The IRI-POI in the SMF shall generate an xIRI containing an
SMFPDUtoMAPDUSessionModification record when the IRI-POI present in the SMF
detects that an existing PDU session for the target UE has been successfully
modified to an MA PDU session using the PDU session modification procedures as
described in TS 24.501 [13]. A PDU session is considered to be successfully
modified to a MA PDU session, when all of the following are true:
1\. The UE is registered to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access:
\- In the same PLMN (non-roaming UE).
\- In the different PLMNs (roaming UE).
2\. SMF receives the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST from the UE (TS 24.501
[13] clause 8.2.10) that includes one of the following:
\- _modification request_ and includes MA PDU session information IE set to
_MA PDU session network upgrade allowed_.
\- _MA PDU request_.
3\. SMF sends a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND to the UE that includes the
ATSSS IE (TS 24.501 [13] clause 6.4.2.3).
4\. SMF receives the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMPLETE from the UE (TS 24.501
[13] clause 8.3.10.1).
5\. The 5GSM state within the SMF is PDU Session Active.
Once the SMFPDUtoMAPDUSessionModification record has been generated by the
IRI-POI in the SMF, the IRI-POI shall follow clause 6.2.3.2.7 of the present
document for further reporting for this MA PDU session.

packet header information is authorised and approach 2 described in clause
6.2.3.5 is used, the CC-TF present in the SMF sends a trigger to the CC-POI
present in the UPF over the LI_T3 interface.
When the CC-TF in the SMF detects that a PDU session is being established
(i.e. when the SMF sends the N4: PFCP Session Establishment Request to the
UPF, see TS 29.244 [15], clause 6.3.2) for a target UE, it shall send an
activation message to the CC-POI in the UPF over the LI_T3 interface. The
activation message shall contain the correlation identifiers that the CC-POI
in the UPF shall use with the xCC. This can be achieved by sending an
ActivateTask message as defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.1 with the
following details.

This value shall | | | | be used by the CC-POI in | | | | the UPF to fill the XID of | | | | X3 PDUs. | | +-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-------+
The CC-TF in the SMF shall not send the ListOfServiceTypes parameter of the
ActivateTask message to the CC-POI in the UPF.

When the CC-TF in the SMF detects that a targeted PDU session is changing
(i.e. when the SMF sends the N4: PFCP Session Modification Request to the UPF,
see TS 29.244 [15], clause 6.3.3) in a way that requires changes to the
interception already activated by the CC-POI in the UPF, the CC-TF shall
modify the interception at the CC-POI in the UPF over the LI_T3 interface.
This is achieved by sending a ModifyTask message as defined in ETSI TS 103
221-1 [7] clause 6.2.2. The ModifyTask message contains the same details as
the ActivateTask message with the following fields updated as appropriate.
Table 6.2.3-8: Parameters that may be changed in a ModifyTask message when
updating interception at the CC-POI in the UPF
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-------+ | ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] | Description | M/C/O | | field name | | | +-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-------+ | TargetIdentifiers | Updated packet detection | M | | | criteria as determined by | | | | the CC-TF in the SMF. | | | | | | | | NOTE: See notes on | | | | TargetIdentifiers in table | | | | 6.2.3-6. | | +-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-------+
When the CC-TF in the SMF detects that a targeted PDU session is changing
(i.e. when the SMF sends the N4: PFCP Session Modification Request to the UPF)
for which the interception had not been previously activated in the CC-POI in
the UPF (e.g. in case of previous unsuccessful LI activation at the CC-POI in
the UPF by the CC-TF in the SMF), the CC-TF shall send an activation message
to the CC-POI in the UPF over the LI_T3 interface. The activation message
shall contain the correlation identifiers that the CC-POI in the UPF shall use
with the xCC. This can be achieved by sending an ActivateTask message as
defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.1 with the details provided by
Table 6.2.3-6.
When the CC-TF in the SMF detects that the PDU session has been released (i.e.
when the SMF sends the N4: PFCP Session Deletion Request to the UPF, see TS
29.244 [15], clause 6.3.4) for a target UE, it shall send a deactivation
message to the CC-POI in the UPF over the LI_T3 interface. When using ETSI TS
103 221-1 [7] this is achieved by sending a DeactivateTask message with the
XID field set to the XID associated with the interception, as described in
ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.3.
By default, interception shall occur at the anchor UPF as described in clause
6.2.3.3.3.
When a warrant that includes the service scoping of CC is activated for a
target UE with an established PDU session and when the IRI-POI present in the
SMF generates the xIRI containing an
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedPDUSession record (see clause 6.2.3.2.5),
the CC-TF present in the SMF shall send an activation message to the CC-POI
present in the UPF to generate the xCC.
##### 6.2.3.3.2 CC interception with multi-homed PDU session
When a target UE accesses multiple Data Networks (DNs) via a multi-homed PDU
session (see TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.6.4.3), multiple UPFs are involved in
providing the PDU Session Anchors, with one UPF providing the Branching Point
functionality. The Branching Point UPF may, or may not, be a PDU Session
Anchor UPF (see TS 33.127 [5] Annex A3.2). The CC-TF present in the SMF shall
send the CC intercept trigger to the CC-POI present in an UPF if and only if
that UPF is selected to provide the CC-POI functions.
When the target UE is involved in multi-homed PDU session, the CC-TF present
in the SMF (i.e. in the SMF that establishes the PDU session) shall determine
which UPF(s) is(are) more suitable to provide the CC-POI functions adhering to
the following requirements specified in TS 33.127 [5]:
\- All applicable user plane packets are captured and delivered.
\- Duplicate delivery of CC is suppressed to the extent possible.
This clause assumes that a PDU session contains only one Branching Point UPF
(with N3 reference point toward the target UE) and one PDU Session Anchor UPF
for each DN connection.
Since the present document requires the interception of all DN connections,
the SMF may choose either all the PDU Session Anchor UPFs or the Branching
Point UPF to provide the CC-POI functions.
The Branching Point UPF may be chosen when all user plane packets pass through
the Branching Point UPF, and the CC-TF present in the SMF may choose the
Branching Point UPF to provide the CC-POI function and accordingly, send the
CC interception trigger to the CC-POI present in the Branching Point UPF. The
CC intercept trigger shall include the packet detection rules. An example of
these rules is:
\- Generate the xCC from all the incoming and outgoing user plane packets to
the target UE.
In this case, the CC-TF present in the SMF shall not select any of the PDU
Session Anchor UPFs to provide the CC-POI functions.
When a Branching Point UPF is chosen to provide the CC-POI functions, and if
the Branching Point UPF is removed from the user plane path during a PDU
session, then the CC POI functions will have to be moved to the PDU Session
Anchor UPFs.
The xCC delivered to the MDF3 shall be correlated to the PDU session related
xIRI. The use of Correlation Id shall be on a user-plane path basis, which
means that the xCC generated at different UPFs that belong to different PDU
sessions may need to have separate Correlation IDs, each correlating to their
own PDU session related xIRI.
##### 6.2.3.3.3 CC Interception only at PDU Session Anchor UPFs
An option is to intercept a copy of the packets sent and received on the N6
interface [2] side of the PDU Anchor UPF (for each UL classifier in case of
selective routing or _Service and Session Continuity_ mode 3) for all DNs the
subject is connected to. In the in-bound roaming case for home-routed roaming,
the CSP shall deliver a copy of the packets sent and received on the N9 side
of the PDU Anchor UPF towards the serving network.
#### 6.2.3.4 IRI-POI in UPF triggering over LI_T2
When interception of packet header information is authorised, if approach 1
described in clause 6.2.3.9.1 is used for packet header information reporting,
the IRI-TF in the SMF shall send a trigger to the IRI-POI in the UPF over the
LI_T2 interface when the IRI-TF in the SMF detects that a PDU session has been
established (i.e. when the SMF sends the N4: PFCP Session Establishment
Request to the UPF, see TS 29.244 [15], clause 6.3.2) for a target UE. The
activation message shall contain the correlation ID that the IRI-POI in the
UPF shall use when generating xIRI. This shall be achieved by sending an
ActivateTask message as defined in TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.1 with the
following details.
Table 6.2.3-9: ActivateTask message for triggering the UPF IRI-POI

These delivery | | | | endpoints shall be | | | | configured by the IRI-TF in | | | | the SMF using the | | | | _CreateDestination_ message | | | | as described in ETSI TS 103 | | | | 221-1 [7] clause 6.3.1 | | | | prior to first use. | | +-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-------+ | CorrelationID | Correlation ID to assign | M | | | for xIRI generated by the | | | | IRI-POI in the UPF. This | | | | field is populated with the | | | | same CorrelationID the | | | | IRI-POI in the SMF uses for | | | | the associated xIRI. | | +-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-------+ | ProductID | Shall be set to the XID of | M | | | the Task Object associated | | | | with the interception at | | | | the IRI-TF. This value | | | | shall be used by the | | | | IRI-POI in the UPF to fill | | | | the XID of X2 PDUs. | | +-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-------+
The IRI-TF in the SMF shall not send the ListOfServiceTypes parameter of the
ActivateTask message to the IRI-POI in the SMF.
Table 6.2.3-10: Void
When the IRI-TF in the SMF detects that a targeted PDU session has changed
(i.e. when the SMF sends the N4: PFCP Session Modification Request to the UPF,
see TS 29.244 [15], clause 6.3.3) in a way which requires changes to the
interception by the IRI-POI in the UPF, the IRI-TF in the SMF shall modify the
interception at the IRI-POI in the UPF over the LI_T2 interface. This is
achieved by sending a ModifyTask message as defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7]
clause 6.2.2. The ModifyTask message contains the same details as the
ActivateTask message with the following fields updated as appropriate.
Table 6.2.3-11: Parameters that may be changed in a ModifyTask message when
updating interception at the IRI-POI in the UPF
+-------------------+----------------------------------------+-------+ | Field name | Description | M/C/O | +-------------------+----------------------------------------+-------+ | TargetIdentifiers | Updated packet detection criteria as | M | | | determined by the IRI-TF in the SMF. | | | | | | | | NOTE: See notes on TargetIdentifiers | | | | in table 6.2.3-6. | | +-------------------+----------------------------------------+-------+
When the IRI-TF in the SMF detects that the PDU session has been released
(i.e. when the SMF sends the N4: PFCP Session Deletion Request to the UPF, see
TS 29.244 [15], clause 6.3.4) for a target UE, it shall send a deactivation
message to the IRI-POI in the UPF over the LI_T2 interface. When using ETSI TS
103 221-1 [7] this is achieved by sending a DeactivateTask message with the
XID field set to the XID associated with the interception, as described in
ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.3.
When a PDU session involves multiple UPFs, the selection of UPF to provide the
IRI-POI functions shall be done in the same way an UPF is selected to provide
the CC-POI functions as described in clauses 6.2.3.3.2 and 6.2.3.3.3.
When interception of packet header information is authorised for a target UE,
if approach 1 described in clause 6.2.3.9.1 is used for packet header
information reporting, the IRI-TF present in the SMF shall send an activation
message to the IRI-POI present in the UPF when the IRI-POI present in the SMF
generates the xIRI containing an
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedPDUSession record to generate the packet
header information reporting related xIRIs from the user plane packets of that
PDU session.
#### 6.2.3.5 Generation of xIRI at UPF over LI_X2
##### 6.2.3.5.1 Packet data header reporting
When packet header information reporting is authorised, packet header
information reports are generated either by the IRI-POI in the UPF (if
approach 1 from clause 7.12.2.3 of TS 33.127 [5] is used) or by the MDF2 (if
approach 2 from clause 7.12.2.3 of TS 33.127 [5] is used). Depending on the
requirements of the warrant, the packet header information reports can be in
per-packet form, as Packet Data Header Reports (PDHRs), or in summary form, as
Packet Data Header Summary Reports (PDSRs).
##### 6.2.3.5.2 Fragmentation
If the IRI-POI in the UPF is placed on a link which fragmented the original IP
packet (see IETF RFC 791[34] for basic fragmentation rules, and IETF RFC 815
[26] for more complex re-assembly rules), a situation may occur in which only
the first fragment can be sensibly reported in a PDHR, while the subsequent
fragments may be missing essential fields that are mandatory, which may cause
simplistic implementations to mis-report them, or omit them altogether.
In this case, the IRI-POI in the UPF shall report the first fragment of a
fragmented IP packet, including the port numbers when they are included within
this first fragment, using the length of the fragment to determine if the port
numbers are indeed encoded within this first fragment. The subsequent
fragments are reported without port information. This technique relieves the
IRI-POI in the UPF from having to reassemble the original IP packet (at line
speed) at the cost of accuracy of the reported fields.
##### 6.2.3.5.3 Packet Data Header Report (PDHR)
If the per-packet form of packet header information reporting, i.e. PDHR, is
authorised, the PDHeaderReport xIRI shall be generated as described in clause
6.2.3.9.3.
##### 6.2.3.5.4 Packet Data Summary Report (PDSR)
If the summary form of the packet header information reporting, i.e. PDSR, is
authorised, the PDSummaryReport xIRI shall be generated as described in clause
6.2.3.9.4.
#### 6.2.3.6 Generation of xCC at CC-POI in the UPF over LI_X3
The CC-POI present in the UPF shall send xCC over LI_X3 for each IP packet
matching the criteria specified in the Triggering message (i.e. ActivateTask
message) received over LI_T3 from the CC-TF in the SMF.
NOTE: Implementers are reminded of the completeness and non-duplication
requirements (see TS 33.127 [5]).
Each X3 PDU shall contain the contents of the user plane packet given using
the GTP-U, IP or Ethernet payload format.
The CC-POI present in the UPF shall set the payload format to indicate the
appropriate payload type (5 for IPv4 Packet, 6 for IPv6 Packet, 7 for Ethernet
frame or 12 for GTP-U Packet as described in ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clauses 5.4
and 5.4.13.
If handover of the entire GTP-U packet is required over LI_HI3 (see clause
6.2.3.8), then consideration shall be made of the correct choice of LI_X3
payload type to ensure that the MDF3 has the necessary CC information. Support
for delivery of LI_X3 as payload type 12 (GTP-U packet) is mandatory.
The CC-POI present in the UPF may use the Additional XID Related Information
attributes to facilitate efficient delivery of xCC, as specified in ETSI TS
103 221-2 [8] clause 5.3.22.
#### 6.2.3.7 Generation of IRI over LI_HI2
When an xIRI is received over LI_X2 from the IRI-POI in the SMF or the IRI-POI
in the UPF, the MDF2 shall send the IRI message over LI_HI2 without undue
delay. The IRI message shall contain a copy of the relevant record received
from LI_X2. The record may be enriched by other information available at the
MDF (e.g. additional location information).
The timestamp field of the ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] PSHeader structure shall be
set to the time at which the SMF event was observed (i.e. the timestamp field
of the xIRI).
The IRI type parameter (see ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] clause 5.2.10) shall be
included and coded according to table 6.2.3-14.

PDHeaderReport REPORT PDSummaryReport REPORT
IRI messages associated with the same PDU Session shall be assigned the same
CIN (see ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] clause 5.2.4).
The threeGPP33128DefinedIRI field (see ETSI TS 102 232-7 [10] clause 15) shall
be populated with the BER-encoded IRIPayload.
When an additional warrant is activated on a target UE and the LIPF uses the
same XID for the additional warrant, the MDF2 shall be able to generate and
deliver the IRI message containing the
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedPDUSession record and the
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedMAPDUSession record to the LEMF
associated with the additional warrant without receiving a corresponding xIRI.
The payload of the SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedPDUSession record is
specified in table 6.2.3-4, while the payload of the
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedMAPDUSession record is specified in table
6.2.3-9. The MDF2 shall generate and deliver the IRI message containing the
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedPDUSession record for each of the
established PDU sessions to the LEMF associated with the new warrant. The MDF2
shall generate and deliver the IRI message containing the
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedMAPDUSession record for each of the
established MA PDU sessions to the LEMF associated with the new warrant.
If the MDF2 did not receive from the IRI-POI the value of
timeOfSessionEstablishment parameter in a previous corresponding
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedPDUSession or
SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedMAPDUSession xIRI for the same session,
the MDF2, when generating the SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedPDUSession
or the SMFStartOfInterceptionWithEstablishedMAPDUSession IRI shall include in
that parameter the time provided in the timestamp previously received in the
header of the related SMFPDUSessionEstablishment or
SMFMAPDUSessionEstablishment xIRI.
When the delivery of packet header information is authorised and approach 2
described in clause 6.2.3.9.1 is used, the MDF2 shall generate the IRI message
and send it over LI_HI2 without undue delay when xCC is received over LI_MDF
from the MDF3. The MDF2 shall generate packet header information reporting as
described in clause 6.2.3.5.
#### 6.2.3.8 Generation of CC over LI_HI3
When the xCC is received over LI_X3, the MDF3 shall emit the CC over LI_HI3
without undue delay.
The timestamp field of the ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] PSHeader structure shall be
set to the time that the UPF observed the data (i.e. the timestamp field of
the xCC). The LIID and CID fields shall correctly reflect the target identity
and communication session to which the CC belongs.
The MDF3 shall populate the threeGPP33128DefinedCC field (see clause 5.5.3 of
the present document) with a BER-encoded CCPayload structure containing
either:
1\. The uPFCCPDU field containing the GTP-U packet received over LI_X3. It
shall only be used if the content of the GTP-U packet is an IPv4 or IPv6
packet.
2\. The extendedUPFCCPDU field as described in table 6.2.3-15.
The MDF3 shall support delivery using either option.

#### 6.2.3.9 Packet header information reporting
##### 6.2.3.9.1 General
As described in TS 33.127 [5] clause 7.12.2, warrants that do not require the
interception of communication contents but do require packet header
information reporting will require access to the user plane packets. Packet
header information reporting includes the following two IRI messages:
\- Packet Data Header Reporting (PDHR) in the form of PDHeaderReport records.
\- Packet Data Summary Reporting (PDSR) in the form of PDSummaryReport
records.
TS 33.127 [5] clause 7.12.2 provides two approaches for the generation of such
IRI messages.
In approach 1, the IRI-POI present in the UP Entityconstructs and delivers the
packet header information reporting related xIRIs to the MDF2 as described in
clause 6.2.3.4.
In approach 2, the CC-POI present in the UP Entity intercepts, constructs and
delivers the xCC to the MDF3 as described in clause 6.2.3.6. The MDF3 forwards
the xCC to the MDF2 over the LI_MDF interface and the MDF2 generates the IRI
messages containing the packet header information reporting related records
from the xCC.
In both approaches, the payload of the PDHeaderReport and PDSummaryReport
records are as described in clauses 6.2.3.9.3, 6.2.3.9.4, tables 6.2.3.9.3-1
and 6.2.3.9.4-1. Note that in approach 2, the MDF2 generates these IRI
messages containing PDHeaderReport and PDSummaryReport records without
receiving the equivalent xIRI from an IRI-POI. The actions of the MDF2, the
MDF3, the CC-TF in the CP Entity in 5GS and CUPS EPS, and the CC-POI in non-
CUPS EPS are managed as part of the intercept data provisioned to them over
the LI_X1 interface.
##### 6.2.3.9.2 Provisioning details
Table 6.2.3.9.2-1 shows the details of the HeaderReporting
TaskDetailsExtension used in the LI_X1 ActivateTask message used for
provisioning LI functions when packet header information reporting is
authorised.

##### 6.2.3.9.3 PDHeaderReport record
If the per-packet form of packet header information reporting, i.e. PDHR, is
used, the LI function responsible for generating the xIRI extracts the
information shown in table 6.2.3.9.3-1 from each packet.

##### 6.2.3.9.4 PDSummaryReport record
If the summary form of the packet header reporting, i.e. PDSR, is used, the LI
function responsible for generating the xIRI extracts the information shown in
table 6.2.3.9.4-1 from each packet and aggregates it in summaries according to
the pDSRType field defined in the PDHRReportingExtensions parameters of the
ActivateTask message used to provision the LI function. In addition, the
current summary is sent when the LI function responsible for generating the
xIRI receives a DeactivateTask message for the Task that generated the PDSR
regardless of whether the trigger in the pDSRType field of the ActivateTask
message was met. In this case, the pDSRSummaryTrigger field of the PDSR record
shall be set to endOfFlow.
A PDSR shall be generated each time a flow (Source IP, Source Port,
Destination IP, Destination Port, Next Level Protocol, Direction) starts or
ends.
If the useSessionTriggers flag (see table 6.2.3.9.2-2) is absent or set to
false and the provisioned pDSRTriggerType is:
\- Packet count, a PDSR shall be generated whenever the number of packets
detected as a part of the flow reaches the provisioned trigger value.
\- Byte count, a PDSR shall be generated whenever the value for the cumulative
byte size across all packets belonging to the flow reaches the provisioned
trigger value.
\- Timer expiry, a separate timer should be used for each flow. A PDSR shall
be generated for a flow whenever the timer for that flow expires.
If the useSessionTriggers flag (see table 6.2.3.9.2-2) is set to true and the
provisioned pDSRTriggerType is:
\- Packet count, a PDSR shall be generated for each open flow whenever the
number of packets sent and received in the PDU Session/PDN Connection is
reaches the provisioned trigger value.
\- Byte count, a PDSR shall be generated for each open flow whenever the value
for the cumulative byte size across all packets belonging to the PDU
Session/PDN Connection is reaches the provisioned trigger value.
\- Timer expiry, a single timer should be used for each PDU Session/PDN
Connection. A PDSR shall be generated for each open flow whenever the timer
expires.

#### 6.2.3.10 Sharing LI state information over LI_ST
##### 6.2.3.10.1 Overview
TFs in SMFs in SMF sets need to share LI state information to avoid losing
track of the XIDs and CorrelationIDs used in the tasks activated in the POI in
the UPF when the triggered task control is transferred from one TF to another.
POIs in SMFs in SMF sets need to share LI state information to avoid losing
track of the CorrelationIDs and sequence numbers used in the generation of
xIRI and xCC when the interception is moved to another POI in the same SMF
set.
The LIPF may request, store or remove any LI state records at any moment. The
LIPF may revoke the credentials of any LI function to use the LI_ST function
via LI_X0.
##### 6.2.3.10.2 Storing LI state
The TF in the SMF shall store the LI state (related to a task active in the
UPF POI) in the LISSF whenever the parent SMF stores session state for the
relevant PDU session in the UDSF and whenever the parent SMF sends session
state for the relevant PDU session to another SMF.
The POI in the SMF shall store the LI state (related to a task active in the
SMF POI) in the LISSF whenever the parent SMF stores session state for the
relevant PDU session in the UDSF and whenever the parent SMF sends session
state for the relevant PDU session to another SMF.
When storing state, the LI function in the SMF shall use the state storage
procedure specified in clause 5.10.2. During this procedure, the LI function
shall add the metadata shown in table 6.2.3.10.2-1 to the RecordMeta for the
record.
Table 6.2.3.10.2-1: Additional metadata for the RecordMeta
* * *
Field Name Description M/C/O PDUSessionID Identifier for the PDU session
related to task. M UDSFRecordID The recordID used by the parent SMF to store
the associated SMF session information in the UDSF. M LIStateRecordType
Identifier for the record type which can be \"TFLIState\" or \"POILIState\". M
* * *
The TF shall store the following information as the first record block (see TS
29.598 [64] clause 6.1.3.3.3.2), encoded as XML following the XSD schema given
in Annex H.
Table 6.2.3.10.2-2: TFLIState structure for storing TF state information in
the LISSF

Field Name Description M/C/O PDUSessionID Identifier for the PDU session
related to task. M XID XID of the task object associated with the interception
at the TF in SMF. M CorrelationID Correlation ID to assign to interception
product generated by the POI in the UPF. M TriggeredTasks Collection of
information about tasks that the TF in SMF has activated in triggered POIs in
UPF due to interception for this PDU session. As a list of TriggeredTask, see
table 6.2.3.10.2-3 below. M
* * *
Table 6.2.3.10.2-3: TriggeredTask

Field Name Description M/C/O XID XID of the task object associated with the
interception at the triggered. M NEID NEID used in LI_T2/LI_T3 communication
by the triggered POI in UPF. M
* * *
The TF shall specify the XID in order to avoid removing the LI state related
to the same ProductID but a different task in the UPF POI, for example if
there is more than one PDU session.
The SMF POI shall store the information shown in table 6.2.3.10.2-4 as the
first record block (see TS 29.598 [64] clause 6.1.3.3.3.2), encoded as XML
following the XSD schema given in Annex H.
Table 6.2.3.10.2-4: POILIState structure for storing POI state information in
the LISSF

at the POI in SMF. M SequenceNumber Last sequence number used in the
generation of xIRI/xCC. M CorrelationID Correlation ID to assign to
interception product generated by the POI in the SMF. M
* * *
##### 6.2.3.10.3 Retrieving LI state
When the TF in an SMF in an SMF set is provisioned by the LIPF with a specific
XID and access to an LISSF function, the TF shall use the LISSF to retrieve LI
state information.
If the implementation of the SMF set does not ensure that active SM contexts
are always present in some SMF of the SMF set, when a task previously
provisioned by the LIPF in the TF is deactivated, the TF shall request the
records associated to the XID (received from the LIPF) from the LISSF, by
performing a search as described in clause 5.10.3, using the XID as a search
criteria. If no records are found, the TF may assume that no previous
interception has occurred and proceed accordingly.
When a TF detects that its parent SMF is retrieving state for a targetted PDU
session from the UDSF, the TF shall request records associated with that PDU
session from the LISSF by performing a search as described in clause 5.10.3
and using the UDSFRecordID used by the SMF as a search criteria. When a TF
detects that its parent SMF is receiving state for a targetted PDU session
from another SMF, the TF shall request records associated with that PDU
session from the LISSF by performing a search as described in clause 5.10.3
and using the XID of the task related to the target of that PDU session. If no
records are found, the TF may assume that no previous interception has
occurred and proceed accordingly. Implementers should be aware that multiple
records may be returned.
When an SMF POI detects that its parent SMF is retrieving state for a
targetted PDU session from the UDSF, the POI shall request records associated
with that PDU session from the LISSF by performing a search as described in
clause 5.10.3 and using the UDSFRecordID used by the SMF as a search criteria.
When an SMF POI detects that its parent SMF is receiving state for a targetted
PDU session from another SMF, the SMF POI shall request records associated
with that target PDU session from the LISSF by performing a search as
described in clause 5.10.3 and using the XID of the task related to the target
of that PDU session. If no records are found, the SMF POI may assume that no
previous interception has occurred and proceed accordingly.
##### 6.2.3.10.4 Removing LI state
When a task is deactivated successfully in the UPF POI, the TF shall remove
the LI state record from the LISSF as described in clause 5.10.4.
When a task is deactivated in the SMF POI, the POI shall remove the LI state
record from the LISSF as described in clause 5.10.4.
### 6.2.4 LI at UDM for 5G
#### 6.2.4.1 General description
In 5G packet core network, the UDM provides the unified data management for
UE. The UDM shall have LI capabilities to generate the target UE's service
area registration related xIRI. See clause 7.2.2 for the details.
### 6.2.5 LI at SMSF
#### 6.2.5.1 Provisioning over LI_X1
The IRI-POI present in the SMSF is provisioned over LI_X1 by the LIPF using
the X1 protocol as described in clause 5.2.2.
The IRI-POI in the SMSF shall support the following target identifier formats
in the ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] messages:
\- SUPIIMSI.

\- PEIIMEISV.
\- GPSIMSISDN.
\- GPSINAI.
If service scoping is to be performed at the IRI-POI in the SMSF, the IRI-POI
in the SMSF shall support the following CSP service types (see clauses 4.4.2
and 5.2.4):
\- Messaging.
If the IRI-POI in the SMSF receives an ActivateTask message and the
ListOfServiceTypes parameter contains a ServiceType that is not supported, the
IRI-POI in the SMSF shall reject the task with an appropriate error as
described in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.1.2.

message delivery originated from a target non-local ID is attempted to any UE.
\- When an SMS message is successfully delivered to a target UE or when an SMS
message originated from a target non-local ID is successfully delivered to any
UE.
The SMS-MT case can also apply to the scenario when a receipt of SMS delivery
from the far end is delivered successfully to the target UE or when a receipt
of SMS delivery from a target non-Local ID is successfully delivered to the
originating UE.
The IRI-POI present in the SMSF shall generate the xIRI containing the
SMSMessage record when it detects following events:
\- The SMSF receives an SMCP message CP-DATA_RP-DATA [SMS-SUBMIT, SMS-COMMAND]
(via AMF in Nsmsf_SMService_UplinkSMS message) from a target UE.
\- The SMSF receives an SMCP message CP-DATA_RP-DATA [SMS-SUBMIT] (via AMF in
Nsmsf_SMService_UplinkSMS message) from any UE with TP-DA field within the
SMS-SUBMIT containing a target non-Local ID and SMSF returns the SMCP: CP-ACK
to that originating UE.
\- The SMSF receives an SMCP message CP-DATA_RP-DATA [SMS-COMMAND] (via AMF in
Nsmsf_SMService_UplinkSMS message) from any UE with TP-DA field within the
SMS-COMMAND containing a target non-Local ID and SMSF returns the SMCP: CP-ACK
to that originating UE.
\- The SMSF receives a TCAP message MAP MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE Request [SMS-
DELIVER, SMS-STATUS-REPORT] destined to a target UE.
\- The SMSF receives a TCAP message MAP MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE Request [SMS-
DELIVER] destined to any UE with the TP-OA field within the SMS-DELIVER
containing a target non-Local ID.
\- The SMSF receives a TCAP message MAP MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE Request [SMS-
STATUS-REPORT] destined to any UE with the TP-RA field within the SMS-STATUS-
REPORT containing a target non-Local ID.
The IRI-POI present in the SMSF shall generate the xIRI containing the
SMSReport record when it detects following events:
\- The SMSF sends a SMCP message CP-DATA_RP-ACK [SMS-SUBMIT-REPORT] (via AMF
in Namf_ Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message) in response to a
previously intercepted CP-DATA_RP-DATA.
\- The SMSF sends a SMCP message CP-DATA_RP-ERROR [SMS-SUBMIT-REPORT] (via AMF
in Namf_ Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer message) in response to a
previously intercepted CP-DATA_RP-DATA.
\- The SMSF sends a TCAP message MAP MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE Response [SMS-
DELIVER-REPORT] in response to a previously intercepted MAP MT-FORWARD-SHORT-
MESSAGE Request.
NOTE 1: In the above-mentioned descriptions, the requirements of target Non-
Local ID do not apply when both originating and terminating users of an SMS
message are served by the same CSP. The method used to identify a target non-
Local ID is different from the method used to identify a local target ID.
If the IRI-POI is provisioned with the TruncateTPUserData parameter included
and the IRI-POI is generating xIRI for the SMS-SUBMIT type (TS 23.040 [18]
clause 9.2.2.2) or SMS-DELIVER type (TS 23.040 [18] clause 9.2.2.1) TPDUs, the
IRI-POI shall use the truncatedSMSTPDU (as described in table 6.2.5-7),
otherwise, the IRI-POI shall use the sMSTPDU.

The IRI-POI in the SMSF shall populate the messageType field with the values
listed in table 6.2.5-8 based on the SMS TPDU message type (see TS 23.040 [18]
clause 9.2.2) and the RP Message Type (see TS 24.011 [46] clause 8.2.2) that
triggered the generation of the xIRI. The SMS TPDU Message Type is indicated
by the value of the TP-Message Type Indicator (TP-MTI) (see TS 23.040 [18]
clause 9.2.3.1) as described in TS 23.040 [18] clause 9.2.3.1. The RP Message
Type is indicated by the value of the RP MTI (See TS 24.011 [46] clause
8.2.2).
NOTE 2: For the SMS-MO case, the originating party is the address of the UE
from which the SMSF receives the CP-DATA_RP-DATA [SMS-SUBMIT, SMS-COMMAND]
message (via AMF in the Nsmsf_SMService_UplinkSMS). The GPSI is one of the
data fields used in the Nsmsf related messages (see TS 29.540 [21]).
Alternatively, the SMSF may find the originating party address in the same way
it finds the address when generating charging records. For SMS-MT case, this
is derived from TP-OA field (TS 23.040 [18]) for SMS-DELIVER TPDUs or the TP-
RA field (TS 23.040 [18]) for SMS-STATUS-REPORT TPDUs. In cases where the
originatingSMSParty is not a GPSI, PEI, or SUPI, the sMSAddress parameter is
populated with the octets received in the field used to derive the address (as
per TS 23.040 [18] clause 9.1.2.5).
NOTE 3: For SMS-MT case, the terminating party is the address of the UE to
which the SMSF sends the CP-DATA_RP-DATA [SMS-DELIVER, SMS-STATUS-REPORT]
message (via AMF in Namf_Communications_N1N2MessageTransfer). The GPSI is one
of the data fields used in the Namf related messages (TS 29.518 [22]).
Alternatively, the SMSF may find the terminating party address in the same way
it finds the address when generating charging records. For SMS-MO case, this
is derived from the TP-DA field (TS 23.040 [18]). In cases where the
terminatingSMSParty is not a GPSI, PEI, or SUPI, the sMSAddress parameter is
populated with the octets received in the field used to derive the address (as
per TS 23.040 [18] clause 9.1.2.5).
NOTE 4: For the SMS-MO case, for SMS originated from the target UE, the value
fromTarget is used and for SMS destined to target Non-local ID, the toTarget
is used. For SMS-MT case, for SMS terminated to the target UE, the value
toTarget is used and for SMS originated from a target Non-local ID, the
fromTarget is used.
NOTE 5: This field is set to transferSucceeded or transferFailed as follows:
\- SMS-MO case:
\- To transferSucceeded: when the IRI-POI in the SMSF detects that SMSF sends
the MO-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-Request [SMS-SUBMIT] message to the SMS-IWMSC.
\- To transferFailed: when the IRI-POI in SMSF detects the scenarios where
SMSF cannot send the MO-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-Request [SMS-SUBMIT] to the SMS-
IWMSC, but still generates an xIRI containing the SMSMessage record.
\- SMS-MT case:
\- To transferSucceeded: when the IRI-POI in the SMSF detects that SMSF sends
the MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-Response [SMS-DELIVER-REPORT] message to the SMS-
GMSC.
\- To transferFailed: when the IRI-POI in SMSF detects the scenarios where
SMSF cannot send the MT-FORWARD-SHORT-MESSAGE-Response [SMS-DELIVER-REPORT] to
the SMS-GMSC, but an xIRI containing the SMSMessage record is still generated.
NOTE 6: This is only applicable to the SMS-MT case and can be derived from the
TP-MMS (More Message to Send) field present in the SMS-DELIVER sent to the UE
(via AMF in the Namf_Communications_N1N2MessageTransfer).
NOTE 7: This is derived from the ueLocation field of SmsRecord IE received
from the AMF in the Nsmsf_SMService_UplinkSMS message (TS 29.540 [21]). For
the SMSMessage record, the SMCP message is CP-DATA_RP-DATA [SMS-SUBMIT, SMS-
COMMAND] and for the SMSReport record, the SMCP message is CP-DATA-RP-ACK
[SMS-DELIVER-REPORT]. This value is encoded as a _userLocation_ parameter
(_location >locationInfo>userLocation_), see Annex A.
#### 6.2.5.4 Generation of IRI over LI_HI2
When an xIRI containing the SMSMessage record is received over LI_X2 from the
IRI-POI in SMSF, the MDF2 shall send the IRI message over LI_HI2 without undue
delay. The IRI message shall contain a copy of the SMSMessage record received
over LI_X2. The SMSMessage record may be enriched by other information
available at the MDF (e.g. additional location information).
If the MDF2 is provisioned with the TruncateTPUserData parameter included, the
truncatedSMSTPDU field shall be used in SMSMessage IRI message, otherwise, the
sMSTPDU field shall be used.
The threeGPP33128DefinedIRI field (see ETSI TS 102 232-7 [10] clause 15) shall
be populated with the BER-encoded IRIPayload.
The timestamp field of the PSHeader structure shall be set to the time that
the SMSF event was observed (i.e. the timestamp field of the xIRI).
Each SMSMessage record shall be delivered as an IRI REPORT (see ETSI TS 102
232-1 [9] clause 5.2.10) with a new CIN assigned (see ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9]
clause 5.2.4).
Each SMSReport record shall be delivered as a separate IRI REPORT (see ETSI TS
102 232-1 [9] clause 5.2.10) with the same CIN as the IRI REPORT of the
associated SMSMessage record.
### 6.2.6 LI support at NRF
The SIRF present within the NRF provides SBA-related information to the LIPF
over the LI_SI interface. Details for this interface are not considered in the
present document and are for further study.
## 6.3 4G
### 6.3.1 General
The present document allows three options for EPC LI stage 3 interfaces for 4G
/ LTE:
\- Option A: Use LI_X1, LI_X2 and LI_X3 interfaces specified below in clauses
6.3.2 and 6.3.3 for the events listed in TS 33.127 [5] clauses 6.3.2.3 and
6.3.3.3, and the events related to SMS over NAS as specified in TS 33.107 [36]
clause 18.2.4.
\- Option B: Use LI_X1, LI_X2 and LI_X3 interfaces as specified in clause
6.3.2 and 6.3.3 for the events listed in TS 33.107 [36] clause 12.2.1.2 and
for the events related to the MMEIdentifierAssociation record described in
clause 6.3.2.2.2.
\- Option C: Use TS 33.107 [36] clause 12 natively as defined in that
document.
For implementations that include EPS/5GS interworking, Option A shall be used.
In all cases, the present document specifies the stage 3 for the LI_HI1,
LI_HI2 and LI_HI3 interfaces.
### 6.3.2 LI at MME
#### 6.3.2.1 Provisioning over LI_X1
The IRI-POI present in the MME is provisioned over LI_X1 by the LIPF using the
X1 protocol as described in clause 5.2.2.
The POI in the MME shall support the following target identifier formats:
\- IMSI (using the IMSI target identifier format from ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7]).
\- MSISDN (using the E164Number target identifier format from ETSI TS 103
221-1 [7]).
\- ME Identity (using the IMEI target identifier format from ETSI TS 103 221-1

#### 6.3.2.2 Generation of xIRI over LI_X2
##### 6.3.2.2.1 General
If the MME receives one or more cell IDs in an S1 message (as specified in TS
36.413 [38]), the POI associated with the MME shall report all of them.
The IRI-POI in the MME shall only generate xIRI containing the
MMEIdentifierAssociation record in the following scenarios:
\- IdentifierAssociation: MMEIdentifierAssociation and Tracking Area/EPS
Location Update (see TS 33.107 [36] clause 12.2.1.2) records shall be
generated. No other record types shall be generated for that target.
\- All: All MME record types shall be generated.
When Option A specified in clause 6.3.1 is used:
\- The IRI-POI present in the MME shall send the xIRIs over LI_X2 for each of
the events listed in TS 33.127 [5] clause 6.3.2.3, the details of which are
described in the following clauses.
\- In addition to the xIRI events listed in TS 33.127 [5] clause 6.3.2.3, the
MME shall support xIRI generation in case of SMS over NAS as specified in TS
33.107 [36] clause 18.2.4. For records related to SMS over NAS in EPS:
\- The IRI-POI present in the MME shall set the payload format to
EpsHI2Operations.EpsIRIContent (value 14), see clause 5.3 and ETSI TS 103
221-2 [8] clause 5.4. The payload field shall contain an
EpsHI2Operations.EpsIRIContent structure encoded according to TS 33.108 [12]
clauses 10.5, 15.2 and B.9.
\- As the LIID may be not available at the MME but is mandatory in
EpsHI2Operations.EpsIRIContent according to TS 33.108 [12] Annex B.9, its
value in the lawfulInterceptionIdentifier field of the encoded PDU shall be
set to the fixed string \"LIIDNotPresent\".
When Option B specified in clause 6.3.1 is used:
\- The IRI-POI present in the MME shall send the xIRIs over LI_X2 for each of
the events listed in TS 33.107 [36] clause 12.2.1.1, the details of which are
specified in clause 12.2.3 of the same TS, and in case of SMS over NAS as
specified in TS 33.107 [36] clause 18.2.4.
\- For all records except MMEIdentifierAssociation (see clause 6.3.2.2.2), the
IRI-POI present in the MME shall set the payload format to
EpsHI2Operations.EpsIRIContent (value 14), see clause 5.3 and ETSI TS 103

set to the fixed string \"LIIDNotPresent\".
\- In addition to the xIRI events listed in TS 33.107 [36], the MME shall
support xIRI containing the MMEIdentiferAssociation record in clause
6.3.2.2.2.
##### 6.3.2.2.2 MME identifier association
The IRI-POI present in the MME shall generate an xIRI containing an
MMEIdentifierAssociation record when the IRI-POI present in the MME detects a
new identifier association for a UE matching one of the target identifiers
provided via LI_X1. Generation of this record is subject to this record type
being enabled for a specific target (see clause 6.3.2.2.1).

The IRI-POI present in the MME generating an xIRI containing an
MMEIdentifierAssociation record shall set the Payload Direction field in the
PDU header to _not applicable_ (Direction Value 5, see ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8]
clause 5.2.6).
When transmitting the xIRI, the IRI-POI present in the MME shall set the
payload format to 2, and provide the payload as a BER-encoded
TS33128Payloads.XIRIPayloads structure.
##### 6.3.2.2.3 Attach
The IRI-POI in the MME shall generate an xIRI containing an MMEAttach record
when the IRI-POI present in the MME detects that a UE matching one of the
target identifiers provided via LI_X1 has successfully attached to EPS.
Accordingly, the IRI-POI in the MME generates the xIRI when the following
event is detected:
\- MME sends an S1: ATTACH ACCEPT message to the target UE and the UE EPS
Mobility Management (EMM) state within the MME is changed to EMM-REGISTERED.

##### 6.3.2.2.4 Detach
The IRI-POI in the MME shall generate an xIRI containing an MMEDetach record
when the IRI-POI present in the MME detects that a UE matching one of the
target identifiers provided via LI_X1 has deregistered from the EPS.
Accordingly, the IRI-POI in the MME generates the xIRI when any of the
following events is detected:
\- For network initiated de-registration, when the MME receives the S1: DETACH
ACCEPT message from the target UE, when the MME receives an S3: DETACH
NOTIFICATION about the target UE from the SGSN or when implicit deregistration
timer expires; and in all cases the UE EMM state within the MME is changed to
EMM-DEREGISTERED.
\- For UE initiated de-registration, when the MME sends the S1: DETACH ACCEPT

The IRI-POI in the MME shall populate the ePSDetachType field with the values
listed in table 6.3.2-4 based on the Detach Type sent in the Detach Request
message (see TS 24.301 [51] clause 9.9.3.7) and the direction of the Detach
Request associated to the event that triggered the generation of the xIRI.
If the Detach Request message associated to the event that triggered the
generation of the xIRI has the EMM Cause field populated, the IRI-POI in the
MME shall set the value of the cause field of the MMEDetach record to the
integer value of the EMM Cause, see TS 24.301 [51] clause 9.9.3.9.
##### 6.3.2.2.5 Tracking Area/EPS Location update
When the reporting of location information is authorised, the IRI-POI in the
MME shall generate an xIRI containing an MMELocationUpdate record each time
the IRI-POI present in an MME detects that the target UE location is updated
due to target UE mobility or as a part of an MME service procedure. The
generation of such separate xIRI is not required if the updated UE location
information is obtained as a part of a procedure producing some other xIRIs
(e.g. mobility registration). In that case the location information is
included into the respective xIRI.
In addition to the Tracking Area Update described in TS 23.401 [50], clause
5.3.3, the UE mobility events resulting in generation of an MMELocationUpdate
xIRI include the _S1 Path Switch Request_ (_intra E-UTRAN handover_ _X2 based
handover_ procedure described in TS 23.401 [50] clause 5.5.1.1) and the _S1
Handover Notify_ (_Intra E-UTRAN S1 based handover_ procedure described in TS
23.401 [50] clause 5.5.1.2).
The MMELocationUpdate xIRI is also generated when the MME receives an E-UTRAN
S1AP _ERAB Modification Indication_ message as a result of Dual Connectivity
activation/release for the target UE, as described in TS 37.340 [37] clause
10.
Based on regulatory requirements and operator policy, the location information
obtained by the MME from E-UTRAN or the E-SMLC in the course of some service
operations may result in the generation of the MMELocationUpdate xIRI record.
Additionally, the IRI-POI in the MME shall capture the location information in
the scenarios described in TS 23.271 [52] clause 4.4.2. Also, in the case of
Mobile Originated LCS service invoked by the target, the location information
may be derived from the Location Service Response sent to the target UE via
the MME (see TS 23.271 [52] clause 9.2.6).
Optionally, based on regulatory and operator policy, other MME messages that
do not generate separate xIRI but carry location information such as emergency
services or LCS may trigger the generation of an MMELocationUpdate xIRI
record.
The MMELocationUpdate record is also used by LARF to deliver location
acquisition responses to MDF2, as described in clause 7.3.5.6. For the
responses to location acquisition requests initiated by LARF, as described in
TS 33.127 [5] the MMELocationUpdate xIRIs shall not be generated.

##### 6.3.2.2.6 Start of interception with EPS attached UE
The IRI-POI in the MME shall generate an xIRI containing an
MMEStartOfInterceptionWithEPSAttachedUE record when the IRI-POI present in the
MME detects that interception is activated on a UE that has already attached
to the EPS. A UE is considered already attached to the EPS when the EMM state
for that UE is EMM-REGISTERED. Therefore, the IRI-POI present in the MME shall
generate the xIRI MMEStartOfInterceptionWithEPSAttachedUE record when it
detects that a new interception for a UE is activated (i.e. provisioned by the
LIPF) and the EPS mobility management state within the MME for that UE is EMM-
REGISTERED.

5.2.6).
##### 6.3.2.2.7 MME unsuccessful procedure
The IRI-POI in the MME shall generate an xIRI containing an
MMEUnsuccessfulProcedure record when the IRI-POI present in the MME detects an
unsuccessful procedure for a UE matching one of the target identifiers
provided via LI_X1.
Accordingly, the IRI-POI in the MME generates the xIRI when any of the
following events is detected:
\- MME sends a reject to any EMM request message to the target UE and the UE
EPS Mobility Management (EMM) within the MME is changed to EMM-DEREGISTERED.
\- MME aborts a registration procedure before the UE EPS Mobility Management
(EMM) state within the MME is changed to EMM-REGISTERED.
\- MME sends a reject to any ESM request message to the target UE.

##### 6.3.3.2.1 General
When Option A specified in clause 6.3.1 is used:
\- For architectures with EPC/5GC interworking:
\- For home routed roaming interception in the visited network, in this
version of the specification, the IRI-POI present in the SGW shall be
implemented in accordance with Option B or Option C specified in clause 6.3.1.
\- For all other cases, the IRI-POI present in the SMF+PGW-C shall send the
xIRIs over LI_X2 for each of the events listed in TS 33.127 [5] clause
6.3.3.3.1.2, as described in clause 6.3.1.
\- As described in TS 23.501 [2] clause 5.32.7.1, a PDN Connection in EPS can
be one leg of an MA PDU session. The details of the messages for single-access
PDU sessions are provided in clauses 6.3.3.2.2, 6.3.3.2.3, 6.3.3.2.4 and
6.3.3.2.5. The details for the messages for MA PDU sessions are provided in
clauses 6.3.3.2.6, 6.3.3.2.7, 6.3.3.2.8 and 6.3.3.2.9.
NOTE: The details of the events triggers used to generate the xIRIs are
specified at high-level in support of possible hitherto implementation
variations for EPS LI.
When Option B specified in clause 6.3.1 is used:
\- The IRI-POI present in the SGW/PGW and ePDG shall send the xIRIs over LI_X2
for each of the events listed in TS 33.107 [36] clause 12.2.1.2, the details
of which are specified in clause 12.2.3 of the same TS.
\- The IRI-POI present in the SGW/PGW and ePDG shall set the payload format to
EpsHI2Operations.EpsIRIContent (value 14), see clause 5.3 and ETSI TS 103
221-2 [8] clause 5.4. The payload field shall contain an
EpsHI2Operations.EpsIRIContent structure encoded according to TS 33.108 [12]
clauses 10.5 and B.9.
\- As the LIID may not be available at the SGW/PGW and ePDG but is mandatory
in EpsHI2Operations.EpsIRIContent according to TS 33.108 [12] Annex B.9, its
value in the lawfulInterceptionIdentifier field of the encoded PDU shall be
set to the fixed string \"LIIDNotPresent\".
##### 6.3.3.2.2 PDU Session Establishment message reporting PDU session
establishment or PDN Connection establishment
The IRI-POI in the SMF+PGW-C shall generate an xIRI containing an
SMFPDUSessionEstablishment record (see clause 6.2.3.2.2) when the IRI-POI
present in the SMF+PGW-C detects that a single-access PDU Session or PDN
Connection has been established for the target UE. The IRI-POI present in the
SMF+PGW-C shall generate the xIRI for the following events:
\- The SMF+PGW-C creates a new PDN Connection in the target UE context of the
SMF+PGW-C (see TS 23.401 [50] clause 5.7.4).
\- The SMF+PGW-C creates a new PDU Session context or SM Context for the
target UE (see TS 29.502 [16] clause 5.2.2.2 and clause 5.2.2.7).
When the SMFPDUSessionEstablishment record (see clause 6.2.3.2.2) is used to
report the creation of a new PDN Connection:
\- The ePSPDNConnectionEstablishment field shall be populated with the
information in Table 6.3.3-1.
\- If there is no SUPI associated to the SM context for the target UE, the
SUPI field of the SMFPDUSessionEstablishment record shall be populated with
the value of the IMSI from the target UE context.
\- If there is no PDU Session ID present in the PCO of the request or response
messages or associated to the context for the PDN connection, the pDUSessionID
field of the SMFPDUSessionEstablishment record shall be populated with the EBI
of the default bearer for the PDN Connection.
\- If there is no 5G UP tunnel present in the context associated to the PDN
Connection, the gTPTunnelID field of the SMFPDUSessionEstablishment record
shall be populated with the F-TEID for the PGW S5 or S8 interface for the
default bearer of the PDN Connection.

##### 6.3.3.2.3 PDU Session Modification message reporting PDU session
modification, PDN Connection modification or inter-system handover
The IRI-POI in the SMF+PGW-C shall generate an xIRI containing an
SMFPDUSessionModification record (see clause 6.2.3.2.3) when the IRI-POI
present in the SMF+PGW-C detects that a single-access PDU Session or PDN
Connection has been modified for the target UE. The IRI-POI present in the
SMF+PGW-C shall generate the xIRI for the following events:
\- The SMF+PGW-C modifies an existing PDN Connection in the target UE context
of the SMF+PGW-C (see TS 23.401 [50] clause 5.7.4).
\- The SMF+PGW-C modifies an existing PDU Session context or SM Context for
the target UE (see TS 29.502 [16] clause 5.2.2.3 and clause 5.2.2.8).
\- The SMF+PGW-C transfers an existing PDU Session to EPS (see TS 23.502 [4]
clauses 4.11.1.2.1 and 4.11.2.2).
\- The SMF+PGW-C transfers an existing PDN Connection to 5GS (see TS 23.502
[4] clauses 4.11.1.2.2 and 4.11.2.3).
When the SMFPDUSessionModification record (see clause 6.2.3.2.3) is used to
report the modification of a PDN Connection:
\- The ePSPDNConnectionModification field shall be populated with the
information in Table 6.3.3-8.
\- If there is no SUPI associated to the SM context for the target UE, the
SUPI field of the SMFPDUSessionModification record shall be populated with the
value of the IMSI from the target UE context.
\- If there is no PDU Session ID present in the PCO of the request or response
messages or associated to the context for the PDN connection, the pDUSessionID
field of the SMFPDUSessionModification record shall be populated with the EBI
of the default bearer for the PDN Connection.
\- If there is no 5G UP tunnel present in the context associated to the PDN
Connection, the gTPTunnelID field of the SMFPDUSessionModification record
shall be populated with the F-TEID for the PGW S5 or S8 interface for the
default bearer of the PDN Connection.

#### 6.3.3.2A Triggering of the CC-POI from CC-TF over LI_T3
When CUPS architecture is used and the interception of user plane packets is
required, the CC-TF present in the SGW-C/PGW-C sends a trigger to the CC-POI
present in the SGW-U/PGW-U over the LI_T3 interface.
#### 6.3.3.3 Generation of xCC at CC-POI in the SGW/PGW and ePDG over LI_X3
##### 6.3.3.3.1 Non-CUPS architecture
The CC-POI present in the SGW/PGW and ePDG shall send xCC over LI_X3 for each
IP packet belonging to the target's communication.
Each X3 PDU shall contain the contents of the user plane packet given using
the GTP-U, IP or Ethernet payload format.
The CC-POI present in the SGW/PGW and ePDG shall set the payload format to
indicate the appropriate payload type (5 for IPv4 Packet, 6 for IPv6 Packet, 7
for Ethernet frame or 12 for GTP-U packet as per ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause
5.4).
If it is required to send the ICE-type for the xCC, the CC-POI shall set the
NFID attribute (see ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.3.7) to the appropriate
value from the ICE-type enumeration in TS 33.108 [12] Annex B.10 as a single
octet. As an example, an ICE-type of \"sgw\" is indicated by setting the
attribute to value 3.
##### 6.3.3.3.2 CUPS architecture
When CUPS architecture is used, the CC-POI in the SGW-U/PGW-U is provisioned
by the CC-TF in the SGW-C/PGW-C using a Triggering message (i.e. ActivateTask
message) as described in clause 6.3.3.0.
The CC-POI present in the SGW-U/PGW-U shall send xCC over LI_X3 for each IP
packet matching the criteria specified in the Triggering message (i.e.
ActivateTask message) received over LI_T3 from the CC-TF in the SGW-C/PGW-C.
NOTE: Implementers are reminded of the completeness and non-duplication
requirements (see TS 33.127 [5]).
Each X3 PDU shall contain the contents of the user plane packet given using
the GTP-U, IP or Ethernet payload format.
The CC-POI present in the SGW-U/PGW-U shall set the payload format to indicate
the appropriate payload type (5 for IPv4 Packet, 6 for IPv6 Packet, 7 for
Ethernet frame or 12 for GTP-U Packet as described in ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8]
clauses 5.4 and 5.4.13.
If handover of the entire GTP-U packet is required over LI_HI3 (see clause
6.2.3.8), then consideration shall be made of the correct choice of LI_X3
payload type to ensure that the MDF3 has the necessary CC information. Support
for delivery of LI_X3 as payload type 12 (GTP-U packet) is mandatory.
#### 6.3.3.4 Generation of IRI over LI_HI2
When an xIRI is received over LI_X2 from the IRI-POI in the SGW/PGW or ePDG,
the MDF2 shall generate the corresponding IRI message and deliver it over
LI_HI2 without undue delay. The IRI message shall contain a copy of the
relevant record received in the xIRI over LI_X2.
When option 2 specified in clause 6.3.1 is used, the MDF2 shall generate IRI
messages based on the proprietary information received from the SGW/PGW or
ePDG and provide it over LI_HI2 without undue delay.
The IRI messages shall include an IRI payload encoded according to clause 10.5
and TS 33.108 [12] Annex B.9. The MDF2 shall encode the correct value of LIID
in the IRI message, replacing the value \"LIIDNotPresent\" given in the xIRI
(see clause 6.3.2.2).
The IRI messages shall be delivered over LI_HI2 according to ETSI TS 102 232-7
[10] clause 10.
#### 6.3.3.5 Generation of CC over LI_HI3
When xCC is received over LI_X3 from the CC-POI in the SGW/PGW or ePDG, the
MDF3 shall generate the corresponding CC and deliver it over LI_HI3 without
undue delay. The CC message shall contain a copy of the relevant xCC received
over LI_X3.
When option 2 specified in clause 6.3.1 is used, the MDF3 shall generate CC
based on the proprietary information received from the SGW/PGW or ePDG and
provide it over LI_HI3 without undue delay.
The CC shall include a CC payload encoded according to TS 33.108 [12] Annex
B.10.
The CC shall be delivered over LI_HI3 according to ETSI TS 102 232-7 [10]

The LALS architecture and functionality is specified in TS 33.127 [5] clause
7.3.3.
#### 7.3.1.2 Provisioning over LI_X1
#### 7.3.1.2.1 Target positioning service
For the LALS target positioning service (TS 33.127 [5] clause 7.3.3.2) the
IRI-POI provided by the LI-LCS Client is directly provisioned over LI_X1 by
the LIPF using the LI_X1 protocol as described in clause 5.2.2 with the
TaskDetailsExtensions field of the ActivateTask message specifying the type of
the target positioning request, immediate vs. periodic, and, in the latter
case, the periodicity of the positioning requests.
Based on national regulatory requirements and CSP policy, the
TaskDetailsExtensions may also include the QoS parameters (specified in OMA-
TS-MLP-V3_5-20181211-C [20]) for the use on the Le interface towards the LCS
Server/GMLC. Alternatively, the QoS parameters may be statically configured in
the LI-LCS Client.
Table 7.3.1.2-1 shows the details of the LI_X1 ActivateTask message used for
the LI-LCS Client provisioning for the target positioning service.
The LI_X1 DeactivateTask shall be issued by the LIPF to terminate the target

#### 7.3.1.2.2 Triggered location service
For the LALS triggered location service (TS 33.127 [5] clause 7.3.3.3) the
LTF, as an IRI-TF, is provisioned by the LIPF using the LI_X1 protocol as
described in clause 5.2.2. The "TaskDetailsExtensions" parameter of the
ActivateTask message in this case will carry the address of LI-LCS Client to
be used for the service and, optionally, the positioning parameters for use on
the Le interface, similar to the target positioning provisioning.
Prior to issuing one or more \"ActivateTask\" requests towards an LTF, the
LIPF shall provision the LTF with the LI_X2 destinations by using the
\"CreateDestination\" operation(s), as per clause 5.2.2.
Table 7.3.1.2-2 defines the details of the LI_X1 ActivateTask message used for

#### 7.3.1.3 Triggering over LI_T2
An LTF, as an IRI-TF, provisioned as described in clause 7.3.1.2.2, triggers
the LI-LCS Client (which plays the role of a triggered IRI-POI) using the
LI_T2 protocol as described in clause 5.2.4. The \"TaskDetailsExtensions\" in
the LI_T2 \"ActivateTask\" message carries the positioing parameters mapped
from information the LTF receives from the ADMF over the LI_X1. The LI_T2
\"ActivateTask\" message header may include a correlation ID from the
triggering xIRI, if available.
Prior to issuing one or more \"ActivateTask\" requests towards an LI-LCS
Client, the LTF shall provision the LI-LCS Client with the LI_X2 destinations
by using the \"CreateDestination\" operation(s), as per clause 5.2.2. The LI-
LCS Client shall deactivate the task on its own upon issuing the final xIRI
for the trigger. There is no DeactivateTask operation on the LI_T2 for the LI-
LCS Client.

The LI-LCS Client generating an xIRI containing an LALSReport record shall set
the Payload Direction field in the PDU header to _not applicable_ (Direction
Value 5, see ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.2.6).
The LI_X2 header (as per clause 5.3.2) of the LALSReport record presented in
table 7.3.1.4-1 shall contain the correlation ID (if provided) from a
respective LI_T2 ActivationTask message.
#### 7.3.1.5 Generation of IRI over LI_HI2
The LALSReport payload, defined in clause 7.3.1.4, shall be used as the
payload of the respective LALSReport record, no payload mediation is required.
A LALSReport message shall be assigned the same CIN (see ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9]
clause 5.2.4) as the IRI message that triggered the LALS reporting, if that
triggering IRI message is assigned a CIN. Otherwise, i.e. when the LALSReport
is a result of the LALS Target Positioning, or the triggering IRI message has
no CIN assigned, the CIN in the LALSReport shall be omitted.
NOTE: In some specific scenarios the amount of LALS reports data may overload
the LI_HI2 and/or LI_X2 interfaces. To prevent the overload, a flow control
for LALS triggered location reports may be implemented in MDF and/or LI-LCS
client, e.g. by limiting the frequency of the reports for individual targets.
### 7.3.2 Cell database information reporting
#### 7.3.2.1 General description
When the location information present within an xIRI includes the cell
identity, the MDF2 that receives the xIRI may retrieve the cell site
information and associated cell radio related information for that cell from a
CSP database and deliver the same to the LEMF either within the IRI message
generated from the received xIRI or in a separate IRI message containing the
MDFCellSiteReport record.
For each intercept, if the MDF2 reports the cell site information, then it
shall provide such information at least on the initial appearance of the cell
identity in the related xIRI.
NOTE: The CSP needs to ensure that the most recent cell site information is
reported to the LEA.
If the reported cell site information is for a cell with mobility, the MDF2
should report the current information (e.g. physical location of the cell)
with every related xIRI.
#### 7.3.2.2 Delivery of cell site information over LI_HI2
The cell site information is encoded as the cellSiteInformation ASN.1
parameter and delivered either within the location field of an IRI message
carrying the respective cell identity, or in a stand-alone IRI message
containing the MDFCellSiteReport record.
The cell radio related information is encoded as the
cellRadioRelatedInformation ASN.1 parameter and delivered with the cell
information parameter.
The MDF2 shall use the IRI message containing the MDFCellSiteReport record to
convey cell site information and cell radio related information retrieved
asynchronously with the sending of the IRI message that caused the retrieval.
The MDFCellSiteReport record shall be delivered as an IRI REPORT (see ETSI TS
102 232-1 [9] clause 5.2.10) and allocated the same CIN, if any, as the IRI
message that caused the retrieval.
When the cell site information and cell radio related information are readily
available at MDF2 or are retrieved synchronously (i.e. blocking the sending of
the IRI message until the retrieval is complete), the cell site information
shall be conveyed within the location field of the IRI message that caused the
retrieval.
The cell site information and associated cell radio related information for
multiple cell identities can be delivered to the LEMF within an IRI message
that carries the respective cell identities or within the IRI message
containing the MDFCellSiteReport record (see Annex A).
The MDF2 generating the IRI message MDFCellSiteReport shall set the Payload

### 7.3.3 Use of the Location structure
#### 7.3.3.1 General description
The _Location_ structure (see Annex A) is used to convey access network
location information and geolocation information. While the data types defined
in the clauses below are generally modelled on data types from the Service
Based Interfaces (SBIs) defined for specific NFs, the data types defined below
shall be used by any POI in order to send all location information available
at the NF where the POI is located.
When location information is reported, unless otherwise specified, all
location information present at the NF for the target shall be reported. If a
single parameter within the Location type is unable to carry all the types of
location information available at the NF, multiple parameters within the
Location type shall be used.

### 7.3.5 Location acquisition
#### 7.3.5.1 General description
The architecture for location acquisition is specified in TS 33.127 [5],
clause 7.3.5.
#### 7.3.5.2 Acquisition request over LI_HILA
The LAF is responsible for receiving acquisition requests from the LEA over
the LI_HILA interface. Further details of LI_HILA messages are defined in
clause 5.11.
#### 7.3.5.3 Acquisition request over LI_XLA
LI_HILA requests are used to generate a LI_XLA request to the LARF over the
LI_XLA interface. Further details of LI_XLA messages are defined in clause
5.12.
#### 7.3.5.4 Location acquisition procedure at the LARF
##### 7.3.5.4.1 General description
Upon the receipt of a location acquisition request over LI_XLA, the LARF shall
first check that the UE is registered at the MME/AMF. If it is registered the
LARF will check the UE context at the MME/AMF to see if the current location
for the UE is known.
The LARF/MME/AMF shall override any user consent, privacy and paging
restrictions concerned with location acquisition that may apply to the target
UE. The LARF/MME/AMF shall ensure that overriding these restrictions does not
result in additional detectability issues.
If delivery via the LI_HI2 is required, the LARF will send the acquisition
response as either an AMFLocationUpdate (in case of the 5GC) or an
MMELocationUpdate (in case of the EPC) xIRI record to the MDF2 via LI_X2_LA.
Full details are given in clause 7.3.5.6.
If delivery via the LI_HILA is required, the LARF returns the acquisition
response as part of the LI_XLA response, which the LAF then transforms into a
LI_HILA response given as a LocationResponseDetails structure (see table
5.11.2.3-1). Full details are given in clause 7.3.5.5 and clause 5.11.2.3.
##### 7.3.5.4.2 Location acquisition procedure at the LARF in case of EPC
The procedure is as follows:
\- If the ReqCurrentLoc parameter (see table 5.12.2.1-1) is set to true in the
location acquisition request message received over LI_XLA, the LARF shall
invoke the Insert Subscriber Data procedure, with the IDR-Flags with the \"EPS
Location Information Request\" bit and the \"Current Location Request\" bit
set (TS 29.272 [108] clause 5.2.2.1.2) using the information received in the
location acquistion request message.
\- If the ReqCurrentLoc parameter (see table 5.12.2.1-1) is set to false in
the location acquisition request message received over LI_XLA, the LARF shall
use the location information in the UE context at the MME to generate and
deliver a location acquisition response based on the provisioned delivery
method as described in clauses 7.3.5.5 and 7.3.5.6.
##### 7.3.5.4.3 Location acquisition procedure at the LARF in case of 5GC
The procedure is as follows:
\- If the ReqCurrentLoc parameter (see table 5.12.2.1-1) is set to true in the
location acquisition request message received over LI_XLA, the LARF shall
invoke a ProvideLocationInfo service operation in the AMF (see TS 29.518 [22]
clause 5.5.2.4) using the information received in the location acquistion
request message to generate the RequestLocInfo parameters. The LARF shall set
the reqCurrentLoc parameter of the RequestLocInfo IE to true (see TS 29.518
[22] clause 5.5.2.4).
\- If the ReqCurrentLoc parameter (see table 5.12.2.1-1) is set to false in
the location acquisition request message received over LI_XLA, the LARF shall
use the location information in the UE context at the AMF to generate and
deliver a location acquisition response based on the provisioned delivery
method as described in clauses 7.3.5.5 and 7.3.5.6.
#### 7.3.5.5 Location acquisition delivery via the LI_HILA
##### 7.3.5.5.1 Location acquisition response over LI_XLA
The LARF shall populate the LocationResponseDetails field in the
LocationAcquisitionResponse message as specified in clause 5.11.2.3.
##### 7.3.5.5.2 Location acquisition response over LI_HILA
On receiving a LocationAcquisitionResponse message containing a
LocationResponseDetails field, the LAF shall return the results to the LEA
over the LI_HILA interface. The LI_HILA response is represented as XML
following the LocationResponseDetails type definition (see Annex I) as
described in clause 5.11.2.3.
Table 7.3.5.5.2-1: Void
#### 7.3.5.6 Location acquisition delivery via the LI_HI2
##### 7.3.5.6.1 Provisioning of the MDF2
The MDF2 listed as the delivery endpoint for xIRI generated by the LARF in the
MME/AMF shall be provisioned over LI_X1 by the LIPF using the X1 protocol as
described in clause 5.2.2 prior to issuing of LI_XLA requests for the given
target. Table 7.3.5.6.2-1 shows the minimum details of the LI_X1 ActivateTask
message used for provisioning the MDF2.
The MDF2 shall support the following target identifier formats in the ETSI TS
103 221-1 [7] messages (or equivalent if ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] is not used):

instead of any delivery destinations authorised by the ListOfDIDs field in the
ActivateTask Message. C
##### 7.3.5.6.2 LI_X2_LA delivery
The LARF shall generate the MMELocationUpdate xIRI in case of the EPC or the
AMFLocationUpdate xIRI in case of the 5GC only when it detects that MME/AMF
returns the location for the corresponding LARF transaction.
In case of the 5GC, the acquisition response shall be given as a
AMFLocationUpdate xIRI record. In case of the EPC, the acquisition response
shall be given as an MMELocationUpdate xIRI record. The XID of the xIRI record
shall be set to the XID specified in the original request (see clause 5.12.2).
##### 7.3.5.6.3 LI_HI2 delivery
The MDF2 shall generate the IRI message based on the AMFLocationUpdate xIRI
record from the LARF and deliver it to the LEMF over LI_HI2.
### 7.3.6 Location Only Reporting
#### 7.3.6.1 General Information
In some cases, it may be required to deliver only location information
associated to a target.
For a warrant authorizing only location reporting, all other IRI information
not associated with Location shall not be delivered. For example, when a
target places a voice call, the new location information available as part of
the call handling, shall be reported, but nothing else. LocationOnly reporting
may be provisioned using one of the following methods:
\- Using a specific Location Only task provisioned at the IRI-POI.
\- Using the Mediation Details at the MDF2.
#### 7.3.6.2 Provisioning Information
The LocationOnlyProvisioning parameter may be included:
\- As a TaskDetailsExtension of an ActivateTask message sent to an IRI-POI.
\- As a MediationDetailsExtension of an ActivateTask message sent to an MDF2.
Table 7.3.6-1 shows the details of the LocationOnlyProvisioning parameter for
TaskDetailsExtension and MediationDetailsExtension.

#### 7.3.6.3 Generation of Location Only xIRI
##### 7.3.6.3.1 General
If the LocationOnly flag is set in the TaskDetailsExtension of an ActivateTask
message sent to an IRI-POI that task is considered a Location Only task.
##### 7.3.6.3.2 Location Only xIRI in 5GS
For a Location Only task at the IRI-POI in the AMF, whenever any trigger
specified for the IRI-POI in the AMF is met for the generation of an xIRI (see
clause 6.2.2.2), instead of generating that xIRI, the IRI-POI in AMF shall
generate an xIRI containing an AMFLocationUpdate record if there is any
location information in the triggering event and send it to the MDF2 over
LI_X2. If there is no location information in the triggering event, no xIRI
shall be generated.
For a Location Only task at an IRI-POI not in the AMF, whenever any trigger
specified for that IRI-POI is met, instead of generating that xIRI, the IRI-
POI shall genereate an xIRI containing a SeparatedLocationReport record if
there is any location information in the triggering event and send it over to
the MDF2 over LI_X2 the xIRI is listed in below in this clause.
The IRI-POI in the UDM shall generate the following xIRIs when the appropriate
triggers are met and and send them over LI_X2 for Location Only tasks:
\- UDMServingSystemMessage.
##### 7.3.6.3.3 Location Only xIRI in EPS
For a Location Only task at the IRI-POI in the MME, whenever any trigger
specified for the IRI-POI in the MME is met for the generation of an xIRI (see
clause 6.3.2.2.2), instead of generating that xIRI, the IRI-POI in MME shall
generate an xIRI containing an MMELocationUpdate record if there is any
location information in the triggering event and send it to the MDF2 over
LI_X2. If there is no location information in the triggering event, no xIRI
shall be generated.
For a Location Only task at an IRI-POI not in the MME, whenever any trigger
specified for that IRI-POI is met, instead of generating that xIRI, the IRI-
POI shall genereate an xIRI containing a SeparatedLocationReport record if
there is any location information in the triggering event and send it over to
the MDF2 over LI_X2 the xIRI is listed in below in this clause.
The IRI-POI in the HSS shall generate the following xIRIs when the appropriate
triggers are met and and send them over LI_X2 for Location Only tasks:
\- HSSServingSystemMessage.
#### 7.3.6.4 Generation of Location Only IRI
If the LocationOnly flag is set in the MediationDetailsExtension of an
ActivateTask message sent to an MDF2 that task is considered a Location Only
task only in the context of this specific MediationDetails set. The MDF2 shall
generate IRIs for the following xIRIs for Location Only tasks and send them
over LI_HI2:
\- UDMServingSystemMessage.
\- AMFLocationUpdate.
\- LALSReport.
\- SeparatedLocationReport.
\- HSSServingSystemMessage
\- MMELocationUpdate.
In addition, whenever any xIRI for a Location Only task is received over LI_X2
from any IRI-POI, if the xIRI is not included in the list below and has
location information, the MDF2 shall generate an IRI message containing a
SeparatedLocationReport record and send it over LI_HI2 to the provisioned
destinations without delay instead of the IRI message containing a copy of the
relevant record received over LI_X2. The record may be enriched by other
information available at the MDF (e.g. additional location information).
The MDF2 shall ignore the LocationOnlyProvisioning parameter if it is present
in the TaskDetailsExtension of the ActivateTask message.
## 7.4 Messaging
### 7.4.1 Introduction
Stage 3 intercept capabilities for SMS at an SMSF are defined in clause 6.2.5.
Details on how to remove unauthorised content from SMS messages are defined in

The IRI-POI present in the MMS Proxy-Relay shall send xIRI over LI_X2 for the
events listed in TS 33.127 [5] clause 7.5.2.3, which is further expanded in
the present document in clause 7.4.2.4 below.
#### 7.4.2.3 Generation of xCC over LI_X3
The CC-POI present in the MMS Proxy-Relay shall send xCC over LI_X3 for any
MMS event where CC is available and authorized for reporting for the events
listed in clause TS 33.127 [5] 7.5.2.3.
The xCC payload shall consist of the MMS contents given as a MIME encoded
document (RFC 2045) according to OMA-TS-MMS_ENC [39]. The payload format shall
be set to \"MIME document\" (value 15).
#### 7.4.2.4 MMS Record Generation Cases
The triggers for MMS record generation are detailed in each of clauses 7.4.3.1
through 7.4.3.20. All triggers are defined by the detection of messages at the
local MMS Proxy-Relay. They belong to one of two following high-level
categories:
\- at the local MMS Proxy-Relay, the sending or arrival of a message, either
to or from the local target UE, using OMA-TS-MMS_ENC [39] definitions, or
\- at the local MMS Proxy-Relay, the sending or arrival of a message to or
from a non-local MMS Proxy-Relay, pertaining to messages either to or from a
non-local target UE served by that non-local MMS Proxy-Relay, using the inter-
proxy MM4 reference point, TS 23.140 [40] clause 8.4 definitions.
The present document assumes that the intercepted MMS complies with version
1.3 of OMA-TS-MMS_ENC [39]. If the intercepted messages do not comply fully,
or the version is other than 1.3, parameters are required to be provided only
if available.
In the following tables, the acronym Multimedia Message (MM) refers to a
message in particular, while Multimedia Message Service (MMS) refers to the
service in general.
### 7.4.3 MMS Records
#### 7.4.3.1 MMSSend
The IRI-POI in the MMS Proxy-Relay shall generate an xIRI containing an
MMSSend record when the MMS Proxy-Relay sends _m-send-conf_ (as defined in
OMA-TS-MMS_ENC [39] clause 6.1.1) to local target UE.
Table 7.4.3-1 contains parameters generated by the IRI-POI, along with
parameters derived from the _m-send-req_ message (from the local target UE to
the MMS Proxy-Relay), and the _m-send-conf_ message (from MMS Proxy-Relay to
the local target UE).

### 7.5.3 IRI and CC Generation
#### 7.5.3.1 Generation of IRI over LI_HI2
When an xIRI is received over LI_X2 from the IRI-POI in the PTC server, the
MDF2 shall generate the corresponding IRI message and deliver it over LI_HI2
without undue delay. The IRI shall contain a copy of the record received over
LI_X2. This record may be enriched with any additional information available
at the MDF2 (e.g. additional location information).
#### 7.5.3.2 Generation of CC over LI_HI3

## 7.6 Identifier Association Reporting
### 7.6.1 General
The IEF, ICF and IQF are responsible for detecting, storing and providing to
the LEA permanent to temporary identifier associations, requested by the LEA
in authorised requests. The IEF as defined in clause 6.2.2A is responsible for
detecting and generating identifier associations records. The ICF is
responsible for caching identifier associations for short duration and the IQF
is responsible for handling requests from the LEA and providing those requests
to the ICF in order to identify the matching identifier associations.
### 7.6.2 ICF
#### 7.6.2.1 General
The ICF is responsible for caching identifier associations provided in event
records from the IEF over LI_XER and handling queries and subsequent responses
from the IQF for responses over LI_XQR.
#### 7.6.2.2 ICF receipt of records over LI_XER
When the ICF receives an identifier association event record over LI_XER from
an IEF (see clause 5.9), the ICF shall use the records to update the
identifier associations cached by the ICF. The ICF shall handle the event
records as described in clause 7.6.2.4.
#### 7.6.2.3 ICF Query and Response over LI_XQR
When the ICF receives an identifier association query request from the IQF,
the ICF shall search the cached identifier associations to establish a match,
based on RequestValues received in the request (see clause 5.8), subject to
clause 7.6.2.4.
Upon successful matching of one or more identifier associations which were
active at or around (within a pre-defined search time window) the observed
time specified in the query, the ICF shall provide a response to the IQF using
the IdentityAssociationResponse message as defined in clause 5.8. Where the
ICF is not able to provide a single identifier association based on the
RequestValues, the IQF is responsible for any subsequent handling of multiple
identifier associations in terms of whether to provide all associations to the
LEA over LI_HIQR.
#### 7.6.2.4 ICF Identifier Association Event Handling
Upon receipt of an Association event as defined in clause 6.2.2A.2, the ICF
shall cache the identifier association(s) contained within the record as
followings:
\- SUPI to 5G-GUTI association received, in an IEFAssociationRecord is stored
by ICF as an active association. The previous active association for the same
SUPI, if any, is marked as a previously active association and cached until
the cache time limit is reached.
\- If the IEFAssociationRecord also contains a SUCI, the SUCI is stored as a
part of the received SUPI to 5G-GUTI association, for the lifetime of that
association.
\- Where the IEFDeassociationRecord corresponds to an active SUPI to 5G-GUTI
association at ICF, the association is marked as a previously active
association and cached until the cache time limit is reached.
The ICF shall have a CSP defined maximum active association lifetime (upon
expiry of which the association is deleted from the ICF).
NOTE 1: This is needed to prevent an association from not being deleted from
ICF under some error conditions (e.g. a loss of IEF message carrying
IEFDeassociationRecord caused by the implicit deregistration of an out-of-
service UE). The selection of the maximum active association lifetime value
needs to ensure that no valid active associations are deleted upon the
lifetime expiry, i.e. the longest possible association refresh time supported
by CSP's network needs to be accommodated.
For previous associations placed in the cache, the ICF shall store the times
of association and disassociation, respectively.
Where an IEFAssociationRecord contains a PEI, GPSI, NCGI or a TAI list, the
ICF shall store the received values and associate them both the current
received SUPI to 5G-GUTI association and any future association until:
\- A subsequent IEFAssociationRecord is received which updates the PEI, GPSI,
NCGI or TAI list values.
\- The old PEI / GPSI / NCGI / TAI list shall be retained in association with
previous SUPI to 5G-GUTI associations until those associations are deleted
from cache.
\- New PEI / GPSI / NCGI / TAI list shall be used in association with both the
association(s) with which it was received and any subsequent associations
until another update is received.
\- All SUPI associations for which the PEI / GPSI / NCGI / TAI list is valid
are deleted from the cache.
When the ICF receives a query request from the IQF as defined in clause
7.6.2.3, the ICF shall search available identifier associations (both active
associations and those marked for deletion in the cache) for a match. The ICF
shall be able to use both time and TAI (as a single TAI and in relation to a
TAI list) to identify the correct SUPI to 5G-GUTI association(s). For
associations which have been disassociated (and will be deleted once the cache
time limit is reached), the time of disassociation is used by the ICF to
identify the correct association match (based on observed time in LEA
request), where multiple associations are held in the cache.
NOTE 2: Use of nCGI to match associations based on physical location for SUCI
/ 5G-S-TMSI to SUPI requests, is out of scope of the present document.
As the LEA and CSP are unlikely to have synchronised the time of identifier
observation / association provided by the LEA in the query request, with NF
time of the IEFs, the ICF shall search the cached identifier associations
using a short window time duration both before and after (subject to overall
cache duration) the observed time provided by the LEA in the RequestValues
over LI_XQR.
NOTE 3: While the search window duration before and after the LEA provided
observed time value is outside the scope of the present document, selection of
this value by the CSP needs to take into consideration, among other aspects,
the duration of a potential period of recovery from a 5G-GUTI update error, in
order to prevent missing of otherwise matching associations due to
discrepancies between their stored association/disassociation time and the
observed time provided by LEA.
NOTE 4: While the value of the short-term caching time is outside the scope of
the present document, selection of this value by the CSP needs to take into
consideration, among other aspects, the duration of potential period of
recovery from a 5G-GUTI update error, in order to prevent previous
associations being deleted before they have been fully disassociated by both
the UE and AMF.
### 7.6.3 IQF
#### 7.6.3.1 General
The IQF is responsible for receiving and responding to LEA requests over
LI_HIQR. Following receipt of a request over LI_HIQR, the IQF shall validate
the request and ensure that the request is within the cache period of
associations stored in the ICF. If the request is valid and within the ICF
cache period, the IQF shall send an association search request to the ICF over
LI_XQR. If the request is not within the ICF cache period or overwise invalid,
the IQF shall reject the request and respond to the LEA over LI_HIQR.
Following receipt of an association search request response from the ICF over
LI_XQR, the IQF shall forward any matching identifier association(s) to the
LEA over LI_HIQR. If the ICF indicates zero matches were found based on the
information provided in the initial request over LI_HIQR, the IQF shall
respond to the LEA over LI_HIQR indicating that no identifier associations
were found based on the request from the LEA.
If the ICF responds with multiple associations of 5G-GUTIs / SUCIs to a single
SUPI, the IQF shall provide all matched associations to the LEA over LI_HIQR.
Handling in the case of multiple SUPIs to a single 5G-GUTI (where the initial
request over LI_HIQR is based on 5G-S-TMSI or SUCI) is outside the scope of
the present document.
#### 7.6.3.2 IQF Query and Response over LI_HIQR
The IQF is responsible for receiving query requests from and providing query
responses to the LEA over LI_HIQR. Further details of LI_HIQR messages are
defined in clause 5.7.
#### 7.6.3.3 IQF Query and Response over LI_XQR
The IQF is responsible for generating queries to and receiving query responses
requests from the ICF over LI_XQR, based on queries received from the LEA over
LI_HIQR. Further details of LI_XQR messages are defined in clause 5.8.

## 7.9 LI for services encrypted by CSP-provided keys
### 7.9.1 LI for general AKMA-based service
#### 7.9.1.1 General
This clause describes basic IRI-intercept for a generic, encrypted service
between a target UE and an application in the CSP network, making use of AKMA-
provided cryptographic keys according to TS 33.535 [65].
#### 7.9.1.2 Provisioning over LI_X1
##### 7.9.1.2.1 General
The IRI-POI in the AAnF (AKMA Anchor Function), the IRI-TF in the AAnF, and
the MDF2 shall be provisioned.
Details of provisioning of an IRI-POI at a network internal AF (Application
Function) making use of AKMA services of the AAnF is in general service
specific and not part of the present clause. Generally, triggering, rather
than provisioning, could in some cases be necessary for the AF. An application
independent generic triggering mechanism is defined in clause 7.9.1.2.3.
Provisioning of CC-intercept at the AF is service specific and not covered in
the present document.
##### 7.9.1.2.2 Provisioning of the IRI-POI and IRI-TF in AAnF
The IRI-POI and IRI-TF present in the AAnF are provisioned over LI_X1 by the
LIPF using the X1 protocol as described in clause 5.2.2.
The IRI-POI and IRI-TF in the AAnF shall support the following target
identifier formats:
\- SUPI, given in either SUPIIMSI or SUPINAI formats as defined in ETSI TS 103
120 [6] clause C.2.
Table 7.9.1.2-1 shows the minimum details of the LI_X1 ActivateTask message

prior to the task activation. M
* * *
##### 7.9.1.2.3 Triggering of the IRI-POI in AF
The IRI-POI present in the AF shall be triggered by the IRI-TF present in the
AAnF over LI_T2 using the X1 protocol as described in clause 5.2.2. An AAnF
can provide services for several different types of applications. Triggering
could be service/application specific, which can effect whether or not certain
conditional fields are included in the xIRI described in clause 7.9.1.4 below.
For all AFs a priori known to match the scope of the warrant, when the IRI-TF
in the AAnF detects that an A-KID has been associated with a SUPI (see clause
7.9.1.3.2), it shall send an ActivateTask message to the IRI-POI present in
the AF. The same shall apply if the AAnF detects that the A-KID of a target
changes due to primary authentication. For AFs not a priori known at the AAnF,
the ActivateTask message shall instead be sent when the IRI-TF in the AAnF
detects that the AF performs an AKMA application key get associated with the
A-KID. The ActivateTask message shall contain at least the following
information.
NOTE: AFs providing services based on SUPI could, as an alternative to
triggering, be directly provisioned by the LIPF as part of service-specific
provisioning. This is however outside the scope of the present document.

## 7.10 LI in VPLMN for IMS-based services with home-routed roaming
### 7.10.1 Background
This clause defines protocol and procedures to support the LI in the VPLMN for
IMS-based services with home-routed roaming architecture where IMS signaling
(e.g. CSCFs) and media functions (e.g. IMS-AGW) are in the HPLMN. The scope of
LI functions defined here are the following in the VPLMN:
\- IMS-based voice services.
\- SMS over IP.
For IMS-based voice services and the SMS over IP, the target can be an inbound
roaming UE or a non-local ID.
As defined in TS 33.127 [5] clause 7.4.7.4.2, LMISF-IRI, LMISF-CC, BBIFF-C and
BBIFF-U handle the LI in the VPLMN for IMS-based services with home routed
roaming architecture.
NOTE 1: When N9 is the interface between the two PLMNs for the user plane
data, the LI architecture is referred to as N9HR LI. With N9HR LI, the BBIFF-C
is present in the SMF and the BBIFF-U is present in the UPF.
NOTE 2: When S8 is the interface between the two PLMNs for the user plane
data, the LI architecture is referred to as S8HR LI. With S8HR LI, the BBIFF-C
and BBIFF-U are combined into BBIFF and is present in the SGW. When SGW is
deployed with CUPS, the S8U is the interface between the two PLMNs for the
user plane data and in this case, the BBIFF-C is present in the SGW-C and
BBIFF-U is present in the SGW-U.
This clause uses the term \"HR LI\" in referring to the common functions
associated with the N9HR LI and S8HR LI collectively.
The HR LI includes two phases of LI processing with the following scope:
\- Phase 1 - Initial configuration and target checking, applies to all in-
bound roaming UEs with home-routed roaming and using IMS-based services. No
interception is done in this phase.
\- Phase 2 - Applies to specific target UEs or UEs in communication with a
target non-local ID. Interception is done in this phase.
The details of the above two phases of LI processes are described in TS 33.127
[5] clause 7.4.7.4.11.
### 7.10.2 Backward compatibility
The present document provides two options for stage 3 definitions for
implementing S8HR LI:
\- Use LI_X1, LI_X2 and LI_X3 interfaces specified below in the present
document.
\- Use TS 33.107 [36] natively as defined in that document.
In both cases, the present document specifies the stage 3 for the LI_HI1 and
LI_HI2 interfaces. Only the first option indicated above is used for N9HR LI.
### 7.10.3 HR LI Phase 1
#### 7.10.3.1 Overview
The Phase-1 of HR LI that applies to all inbound roaming UEs with home-routed
roaming using the IMS-based services include the functions that revolve around
the following interfaces (see TS 33.127 [5]):
\- LI_X1: Used by the LIPF to provision the BBIFF-C/BBIFF and optionally, the
LMISF-IRI to enable the same for HR LI (aka initial configuration of HR LI).
\- LI_T3: Used by the BBIFF-C to instruct the BBIFF-U to capture and deliver
the IMS signaling related user plane packets of inbound roaming UEs to the
LMISF-IRI.
\- LI_X2_LITE: Used by the BBIFF-C/BBIFF to carry the control plane
information (e.g. packet data connection related notifications, UE location)
to LMISF-IRI for inbound roaming UEs.
\- LI_X3_LITE_S: Used by the BBIFF-U/BBIFF to forward the IMS signalling
related user plane packets of inbound roaming UEs to the LMISF-IRI.
The triggering interface LI_T3 is not used in the case of BBIFF in SGW. The
LI_X3_LITE_S is also used in HR LI Phase-2.
The LI_X2_LITE shall be realized using the X2 protocol as defined in ETSI TS
103 221-2 [8]. Likewise, the LI_X3_LITE_S and LI_X3_LITE_M shall be realized
using the X3 protocol as defined in ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8].
#### 7.10.3.2 Provisioning over LI_X1
##### 7.10.3.2.1 General
For Phase-1 of HR LI, the following LI functions are provisioned over LI_X1 by
the LIPF using the X1 protocol defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] with the LIPF
playing the role of ADMF and the following LI functions playing the role of NE
as per the reference model depicted in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7]:
\- BBIFF-C present in the SMF.
\- BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C.
\- BBIFF present in the SGW.
\- LMISF-IRI.
As described in clause 7.10.1, the Phase-1 of HR LI applies to all inbound
roaming UEs that use the IMS-based services with home-routed roaming. The
target identities \"HR\" and \"IMSSignaling\" are used for Phase-1 of HR LI.
##### 7.10.3.2.2 Provisioning of BBIFF-C and BBIFF
The minimum details of LI_X1 ActivationTask message is shown in table

##### 7.10.3.2.3 Provisioning of LMISF-IRI
The LMISF-IRI is listed as the delivery endpoint over LI_X2_LITE for xIRI
generated by the BBIFF-C/BBIFF and for the xCC generated by the BBIFF-U/BBIFF.
The provisioning of LMISF-IRI is to enable it to receive the xIRIs and xCC
sent from the BBIFF-C (SMF, SGW-C), BBIFF-U (UPF, SGW-U) and BBIFF (SGW). As
an alternate deployment option, LMISF-IRI may be presumed to be enabled to
receive such xIRI/xCC by default. This clause does not apply to such alternate
deployment option.
Table 7.10.3.2-4 shows the minimum details of the LI_X1 ActivateTask message
used for provisioning the LMISF-IRI for Phase-1.

#### 7.10.3.3 Generation of xIRI over LI_X2_LITE
##### 7.10.3.3.1 General
LI_X2_LITE is an interface between the BBIFF-C/BBIFF to the LMISF-IRI. The
xIRIs are generated at the BBIFF-C/BBIFF and are sent over LI_X2_LITE
interface to the LMISF-IRI. These xIRIs are applicable to HR LI Phase-1 only.
For N9HR LI, the BBIFF-C present in the SMF shall generate the xIRIs as
described in clause 7.10.3.3.2. For S8HR LI, the BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C
and BBIFF present in the SGW shall generate the xIRIs as defined in clause
7.10.3.3.3.
The xIRIs are generated only when the following prior conditions are met:
\- ActivateTask with target identity \"HR\" and \"IMSSignaling\" is received
with X2 being included in the delivery type.
\- The MCC + MNC of the Operator Identifier field of the DNN (for N9HR) or APN
(for S8HR) is different from the MCC+MNC configured in the SMF (N9HR) or
SGW-C/SGW (S8HR) - see TS 29.502 [16], clause 6.1.6.2.2 and 23.003 [19] clause
9.1.2.
\- The Network Identifier field of DNN (for N9HR) or APN (for S8HR) contains
\"IMS\" (IMS services) - see GSMA IR.88 [67].
The first point is indicating that HR LI is enabled (see clause 7.10.3.2.2).
The second point is telling that the UE is an inbound roamer with home-routed
based roaming. The third point is telling that the PDU session/PDN connection
is for IMS services.
##### 7.10.3.3.2 N9HR LI
The BBIFF-C present in the SMF shall generate the following xIRI when the
prior conditions defined in clause 7.10.3.3.1 are met:
\- N9HRPDUSessionInfo.
The main purpose of the xIRI is to report the UE location, PDU session ID and
the SMF identity. The scenarios that result in the above xIRI are listed below
and apply to all inbound roaming UEs with home-routed roaming and using IMS
services:
\- PDU session is established with the creation of a default QoS flow for IMS
signaling.
\- PDU session is modified with the creation of a dedicated QoS flow used for
IMS media.
\- PDU session is modified with the updates to the QoS flow.
\- PDU session is modified with the deleting of dedicated QoS flow used for
IMS media.
\- PDU session is deleted.
\- MA PDU session is created, modified or deleted.
\- SMF relocation.
\- New UE location due to UE requested or network initiated service request.
\- New UE location due to hand-over situations including EPS to 5GS handover.
\- New UE location due to tracking area updates or routing area updates.
\- New SMF from the SMF set is taking over the PDU session.
\- HR LI is enabled with an established PDU session.
The exact trigger for the xIRI is subject to implementation, however, the
following can be used as a general guidance along with observing the prior
conditions listed in clause 7.10.3.3.1:
\- SMF receives the Nsmf_PDU_Session_Create response message with n1SmInfoToUe
IE containing the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT (see TS 29.502 [16]) from
the H-SMF and sends the NAS message (via AMF) PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT
to the UE as a part of PDU session establishment procedures. This may also
happen with MA PDU session establishment procedures, or during handover
procedures with access type change, or as a part of SMF relocation procedures.
\- SMF receives an Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext request from the AMF with a
new UE location. This may happen whenever a PDU session or a MA PDU session is
modified with the addition, modification or deletion of a dedicated QoS flow.
This may also happen for UE-initiated or network-initiated service request
procedures, or as a part of the handover procedures, or as a part of the
tracking area update procedures.
\- When a new SMF (e.g. in the SMF set) takes over the control for the PDU
session.
\- When an ActivateTask is received from the LIPF over LI_X1 (see clause
7.10.3.2.2) to enable the HR LI, the BBIFF-C present in the SMF detects that a
PDU session for IMS services is already established for an inbound roaming UE
with home-routed roaming.
NOTE: The sending of xIRI for each already established PDU session may result
in a significant number of xIRI messages from the BBIFF-C to the LMISF-IRI.
The contents of xIRI N9HRPDUSessionInfo record is shown in table 7.10.3.3-1
below.

The xIRIs shall include the Network Function ID (NFID), a conditional
attribute field as defined in ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8], with the V-SMF identity.
Handling of this xIRI within the LMISF-IRI is described in clause 7.10.3.4.
#### 7.10.3.3.3 S8HR LI
The BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C and BBIFF present in the SGW shall generate
the following xIRI for the purpose of S8HR LI when the prior conditions
defined in clause 7.10.3.3.1 are met:
\- S8HRBearerInfo.
The main purpose of the xIRI is to report the UE location and the SGW/SGW-C
identity to the LMISF-IRI. This xIRI is generated for the following scenarios
that apply to all inbound roaming UEs with home-routed roaming and using IMS
services:
\- PDN connection is established with the creation of a default bearer for IMS
signaling.
\- Dedicated bearer is activated for the for IMS media.
\- Dedicated bearer is updated for IMS media.
\- Dedicated bearer is deactivated for IMS media.
\- PDN is disconnected.
\- SGW-C/SGW relocation.
\- New UE location due to UE requested or network initiated service request.
\- New UE location due to hand-over situations including 5GS to EPS handover.
\- New UE location due to tracking area updates or routing area updates.
\- HR LI is enabled with an established PDN connection with the creation of a
default bearer.
The exact trigger for the xIRI is subject to implementation, however, the
following can be used as a general guidance observing the prior conditions
listed in clause 7.10.3.3.1:
\- SGW-C/SGW receives a Create Session Response from the PGW-C/PGW and
forwards the same to the MME as a part of PDN connection establishment
procedures that creates the default bearer used for IMS signaling or as a part
of the handover procedures that results in the SGW-C/SGW relocation or 5GS to
EPS relocation.
\- SGW-C/SGW receives a Create Session Response from the MME and forwards the
same to the PGW-C/PGW as a part of dedicated bearer activation procedure on a
PDN connection used for IMS media.
\- SGW-C/SGW receives an Update Bearer Response from MME and forwards the same
to the PGW-C/PGW as a part of bearer update procedures with or without the
bearer update QoS.
\- SGW-C/SGW receives a Delete Bearer Response from MME and forwards the same
to the PGW-C/PGW as a part of bearer deactivation procedure.
\- SGW-C/SGW receives a Delete Session Request from the MME and forwards the
same to the PGW-C/PGW as a part of PDN disconnection procedures. The
procedures potentially have the last known UE location.
\- SGW-C/SGW receives a Create Session Request from the MME and sends a Modify
Bearer Request to the PGW-C/PGW as a part of tracking area/routing area update
procedures with a change of SGW-C/SGW. The procedures potentially have a new
UE location.
\- SGW-C/SGW receives a Modify Bearer Request from the MME and sends the same
to the PGW-C/PGW as a part of Service Request handling procedures, or hand-
over procedures, or tracking area/routing area update procedures without a
change in the SGW-C/SGW. The procedures potentially have a new UE location.
\- When an ActivateTask is received from the LIPF over LI_X1 (see clause
7.10.3.2.2) to enable the HR LI, the BBIFF-C/BBIFF present in the SGW-C/SGW
detects that a PDN connection with a default bearer used for IMS services is
already established for an inbound roaming UE with home-routed roaming.
NOTE: The sending of xIRI for each already established PDN connection may
result in a significant number of xIRI messages from the BBIFF-C/BBIFF to the
LMISF-IRI.
The details of the xIRI S8HRBearerInfo record is defined in table 7.10.3.3-3
below.

All of the xIRIs listed above shall also include the Network Function ID
(NFID), a conditional attribute field as defined in ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8],
with the SGW-C/SGW identity.
Handling of this xIRI within the LMISF-IRI is described in clause 7.10.3.4.
#### 7.10.3.4 LMISF-IRI handling of xIRIs received over LI_X2_LITE
##### 7.10.3.4.1 Handling of xIRIs
The LMISF-IRI that receives the xIRI, N9HRPDUSessionInfo record shall store or
update the record with the information received in the xIRI (e.g. UE location)
as applicable, for the future handling.
The LMISF-IRI that receives the xIRI, S8HRBearerInfo record shall store or
update the record with the information received in the xIRI (e.g. UE location)
as applicable, for the future handling.
The stored record is referred to LI_X2_LITE record in the present document.
##### 7.10.3.4.2 Handling of the stored record
For the N9HR LI related LI_X2_LITE records, the LMISF-IRI shall use the SUPI
and PDU Session ID to uniquely associate a record with the inbound roaming UE.
For S8HR LI related LI_X2_LITE records, the LMISF-IRI shall use the IMSI,
Linked Bearer ID or the Bearer ID (when the Linked Bearer ID is not present)
to uniquely associate a record with the inbound roaming UE.
#### 7.10.3.5 Triggering of BBIFF-U from BBIFF-C over LI_T3
##### 7.10.3.5.1 General
With HR LI Phase-1, the user plane packets from the IMS signaling channel are
delivered to the LMISF-IRI for all inbound roaming UEs with home-routed
roaming.
When BBIFF is separated into BBIFF-C and BBIFF-U, these user plane packets are
captured at the BBIFF-U. In order to enable the BBIFF-U to do that function,
the BBIFF-C triggers the BBIFF-U over the LI_T3 interface.
The BBIFF-U delivers the user plane from the IMS signaling channel over the
LI_X3_LITE-S interface to the LMISF-IRI.
##### 7.10.3.5.2 N9HR LI
When the BBIFF-C present in the SMF detects that a PDU session is established
with IMS signaling related QoS Flow for an inbound roaming UE with home-routed
roaming, it shall send an activation message to the BBIFF-U present in the UPF
over the LI_T3 interface with the associated QFI value.
The exact point at which the trigger is sent is left to the implementation
(preferably, when the SMF receives the N4: PFCP Session
Establishment/Modification Response from the UPF, see TS 29.244 [15], clauses
6.3.2 and 6.3.3), however, the BBIFF-C can send the trigger only when the
following conditions are met:
\- ActivateTask with target identity \"HR\" and \"IMSSignaling\" is received
with X3 being included in the delivery type.
\- The MCC + MNC of the Operator Identifier field of the DNN is different from
the MCC+MNC configured in the SMF - see TS 29.502[16] clause 6.1.6.2.2 and
23.203 [19] clause 9.1.2.
\- The Network Identifier field of DNN contains \"IMS\" (IMS services) - see
GSMA IR.88 [67].
\- The 5QI value associated with the QoS Flow is 5 -- see GSMA NG.114 [68].
The first point is indicating that N9HR LI is enabled (see clause 7.10.3.3.1)
with a need to capture and deliver the IMS signaling related user plane
packets. The second point is telling that the UE is an inbound roamer with
Home Routed based roaming. The third point is telling that the PDU session is
established for IMS services. The fourth point is telling that the IMS
signaling related QoS Flow is established.
If the PDU session for IMS services is already established for an inbound
roaming UE with Home-Routed based roaming when the above indicated
ActivateTask is received, then the BBIFF-C shall send the trigger at the time
Activation Task is received from the LIPF.
The details of ActivateTask sent to the BBIFF-U are shown in table 7.10.3.5-1.

use the QFI associated with the IMS signaling (5QI = 5) related QoS flow to
populate the QFI field within the PDI of PDR ID. M DeliveryType Set to
\"X3Only\". M ListOfDIDs Shall give the DID of the LMISF-IRI to which the xCC
should be delivered. The delivery endpoint is configured using the
CreateDestination message as described in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.3.1
prior to the task activation. M CorrelationID Correlation ID to assign to X3
PDUs generated by the BBIFF-U in the UPF. This field is populated with the
same CorrelationID the BBIFF-C in the SMF uses for the associated xIRI. M
* * *
When the BBIFF-C present in the SMF detects that the PDU session is released
(e.g. when SMF receives the N4: PFCP Session Deletion Response from the UPF,
see TS 29.244 [15], clause 6.3.4), it shall send a deactivation message to the
BBIFF-U present in the UPF over the LI_T3 interface, if the task is still
active in the BBIFF-U.
The BBIFF-C shall also send the deactivation message to the BBIFF-U when a
DeactivateTask is received from the LIPF for the XID if the task is still
active in the BBIFF-U.
##### 7.10.3.5.3 S8HR LI
When the BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C detects that the default bearer used for
IMS signaling is activated on the PDN connection for an inbound roaming UE
with home-routed roaming, it shall send an activation message to the BBIFF-U
present in the SGW-U over the LI_T3 interface.
The exact point at which the trigger is sent is left to the implementation
(preferably, when the SGW-C receives the Sx: Session
Establishment/Modification Response from the SGW-U). However, the BBIFF-C can
send the trigger only when the following conditions are met:
\- ActivateTask with target identity \"HR\" and \"IMSSignaling\" is received
with X3 being included in the delivery type.
\- The MCC + MNC of the Operator Identifier field of the APN is different from
the MCC+MNC configured in the SGW/SGW-C - see TS 29.502 [16] clause 6.1.6.2.2
and 23.203 [19] clause 9.1.2.
\- The Network Identifier field of APN contains \"IMS\" (IMS services) - see
GSMA IR.88 [67].
\- The QCI value associated with the default bearer is 5 -- see GSMA NG.114
[68].
The first point is indicating that S8HR LI is enabled (see clause 7.10.3.3.1)
with a need to capture and deliver the IMS signaling related user plane
packets. The second point is telling that the UE is an inbound roamer with
Home Routed based roaming. The third point is telling that the PDN connection
is established for IMS services. The fourth point is telling that the IMS
signaling bearer is activated.
If the default bearer (for IMS signaling bearer) on the PDN connection is
already established for an inbound roaming UE with Home-Routed based roaming
when the above indicated ActivateTask is received, then the BBIFF-C shall send
the trigger at the time Activation Task is received from the LIPF.
The details of ActivateTask sent to the BBIFF-U present in the SGW-U are shown
in table 7.10.3.5-2.
Table 7.10.3.5-2: ActivateTask message for triggering the BBIFF-U in the SGW-U

of the Task Object associated with the interception at the BBIFF-C. M
TargetIdentifiers Packet detection criteria as determined by the BBIFF-C in
the SGW-C, which enables the BBIFF-U in SGW-U to isolate user-plane packets.
The BBIFF-U in the SGW-U shall support the identifier types given in table
6.2.3-7. The target identity type of PDR ID shall be mandatory. The BBIFF-C in
SGW-C shall use the F-TIEDs associated with the IMS signaling (QCI = 5)
related default bearer to populate the F-TEID field within the PDI of PDR ID.
M DeliveryType Set to \"X3Only\". M ListOfDIDs Shall give the DID of the
LMISF-IRI to which the xCC should be delivered. The delivery endpoint is
configured using the CreateDestination message as described in ETSI TS 103
221-1 [7] clause 6.3.1 prior to the task activation. M CorrelationID
Correlation ID to assign to X3 PDUs generated by the BBIFF-U in the SGW-U.
This field is populated with the same CorrelationID the BBIFF-C in the SGW-C
uses for the associated xIRI. M
* * *
When the BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C detects that the PDN connection is
released (e.g. when SGW-C receives the Sx: Session Release Response from the
SGW-U), it shall send a deactivation message to the BBIFF-U present in the
SGW-U over the LI_T3 interface, if the task is still active in the BBIFF-U.
The BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C shall also send the deactivation message to
the BBIFF-U present in the SGW-U when a DeactivateTask is received from the
LIPF for the XID if the task is still active in the BBIFF-U.
#### 7.10.3.6 Generation of xCC over LI_X3_LITE_S
##### 7.10.3.6.1 BBIFF-U
The BBIFF-U in UPF and the BBIFF-U in SGW-U shall send the xCC over
LI_X3_LITE_S for each of the packet matching the criteria specified in the
Triggering message (i.e. Activate Task message) received over the LI_T3 from
the BBIFF-C.
##### 7.10.3.6.2 BBIFF
The BBIFF present in the SGW shall send the xCC over LI_X3_LITE_S for each of
the packet from the default bearer with the QCI value of 5 (GSMA NG.114 [68])
with following other conditions:
\- ActivateTask with target identity \"HR\" and \"IMSSignaling\" is received
with delivery type \"X3Only\".
\- The MCC + MNC of the Operator Identifier field of the APN is different from
the MCC+MNC configured in the SGW - see TS 29.502 [16], clause 6.1.6.2.2 and
23.203 [19] clause 9.1.2.
\- The Network Identifier field of APN contains \"IMS\" (IMS services) - see
GSMA IR.88 [67].
The first point is indicating that S8HR LI is enabled (see clause 7.10.3.2.2)
with a need to capture and deliver the IMS signaling related user plane
packets. The second point is telling that the UE is an inbound roamer with
Home Routed based roaming. The third point is telling that the PDN connection
is established for IMS services.
The BBIFF in SGW uses the QCI value of 5 (GSMA NG.114 [68]) to identify that
the packets are from the IMS signaling bearer.
##### 7.10.3.6.3 X3 PDU format
Each X3 PDU shall contain the contents of the user plane packet given using
the GTP-U, IP or Ethernet payload format.
The BBIFF-U/BBIFF shall set the payload format to indicate the appropriate
payload type (5 for IPv4 Packet, 6 for IPv6 Packet, 12 for GTP-U Packet as
described in ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clauses 5.4 and 5.4.13.
#### 7.10.3.7 LMISF-IRI handling of xCC received over LI_X3_LITE_S
The LMISF-IRI shall extract the IMS signaling messages (i.e. SIP messages)
from the xCC received over the LI_X3_LITE_S from the BBIFF-U/BBIFF.
The LMISF-IRI shall examine the extracted SIP message for a target match as
described in clause 7.10.4.2. If no match is found, then the LMISF-IRI shall
store the extracted SIP message for a later use. If a match is found, then the
LMISF-IRI shall proceed according to clause 7.10.4.3.
The record that stores the SIP message is referred to as LI_X2_LITE_S record.
### 7.10.4 HR LI Phase 2
#### 7.10.4.1 Overview
The Phase-2 of HR LI that applies to inbound roaming target UEs that use IMS-
based services with home-routed roaming or the inbound roaming UEs that use
IMS-based services with home-routed roaming to communicate with the target
non-local ID include the functions that revolve around the following
interfaces.
\- LI_X1: Used by the LIPF to provision the LMISF-IRI, MDF2 and MDF3 with the
LI information for a target.
\- LI_T1: Used by the LMISF-IRI to instruct the BBIFF-C/BBIFF that IMS media
related user plane packets of target\'s communication need to be captured and
delivered to the LMISF-CC.
\- LI_T3: Used by the BBIFF-C to instruct the BBIFF-U to capture and deliver
the IMS media related user plane packets of target\'s communication to the
LMISF-CC.
\- LI_X3_LITE_S: Used by the BBIFF-U/BBIFF to forward the IMS signalling
related user plane packets of inbound roaming UEs to the LMISF-IRI.
\- LI_X3_LITE_M: Used by the BBIFF-U/BBIFF to forward the IMS media related
user plane packets of target\'s communication to the LMISF-CC.
The triggering interface LI_T3 is not used in the case of BBIFF in SGW. The
LI_X3_LITE_S is also used for HR LI Phase-1.
#### 7.10.4.2 Provisioning over LI_X1
##### 7.10.4.2.1 General
For Phase-2 of HR LI, the following LI functions are provisioned over LI_X1 by
the LIPF using the X1 protocol defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] with the LIPF
playing the role of ADMF and the following LI functions playing the role of NE
as per the reference model depicted in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7].
\- LMISF-IRI.
\- MDF2.
\- MDF3.
As described in clause 7.10.1, the Phase-2 of HR LI applies to inbound roaming
target UEs that use IMS-based services with home-routed roaming or the inbound
roaming UEs that use IMS-based services with home-routed roaming to
communicate with the target non-local ID. The following target identities are
used for Phase-2 of HR LI:
\- IMPU.
\- IMPI.
\- PEIIMEI.
\- IMEI.
The target identity in the IMPI format may contain a value derived from a SUPI
or an IMSI. The target identity in the IMPU format containing a SIP URI or TEL
URI may contain a value derived from a GPSI, MSISDN, an E.164 number, or IMSI.
Only IMPU is used for target non-local ID. For triggered LALS, the LTF
function associated with LMISF-IRI (see clause 7.3.1 and TR 33.928 [121]) is
provisioned with the target identity of IMPU.
##### 7.10.4.2.2 Provisioning of LMISF-IRI

#### 7.10.4.3 Generation of xIRI over LI_X2
##### 7.10.4.3.1 General concepts
The LMISF-IRI extracts the SIP messages that it receives within the xCC from
the BBIFF-U/BBIFF over the LI_X3_LITE_S.
On the originating end of a voice session, the LMISF-IRI examines the SIP
message, the stored LI_X2_LITE record and the stored LI_X3_LITE_S record to
check for the following:
\- Whether the calling party identity is a target.
\- Whether the called party identity is a target non-local ID.
On the terminating end of a voice session, the LMISF-IRI examines the SIP
message, the stored LI_X2_LITE record and the stored LI_X3_LITE_S record to
check for the following:
\- Whether the called party identity is a target.
\- Whether the calling party identity is a target non-local ID.
\- Whether the redirecting party identity is a target non-local ID.
The SIP headers used for identifying a calling party identity, called party
identity, redirecting party identity can be same identities used by the IMS
signaling functions with the following additions:
\- P-Preferred Identity as calling party identity.
When any of the conditions listed above are true, the LMISF-IRI concludes that
target is involved in an IMS session that shall be intercepted. Accordingly,
the LMISF-IRI generates the xIRIs and delivers the same to the MDF2 over the
LI_X2.
For IMS-based voice services, if media interception is required, the LMISF-IRI
sends a trigger for the same to the BBIFF-C/BBIFF over the LI_T1 interface.
##### 7.10.4.3.2 Target match
###### 7.10.4.3.2.1 General
When an IMS UE performs an IMS registration (using SIP REGISTER) request, the
LMISF-IRI examines the following for a target match:
\- From header and To header of the SIP REGISTER when the target identity is
IMPU.
\- SUPI or IMSI stored in the LI_X2_LITE record when the target identity is
IMPI.
\- +sip.instance-id of Contact header of the SIP REGISTER when the target
identity is PEIIMEI or IMEI.
The LMISF-IRI shall store the +sip.instance-id in the LI_X2_LITE_S record for
later use.
###### 7.10.4.3.2.2 Service type of voice
When an IMS UE originates an IMS session (using SIP INVITE), the LMISF-IRI
examines the following to verify for a target match:
\- P-Preferred Identity header and From header present in the SIP INVITE when
the target identity is IMPU.
\- Request URI header and To header present in the SIP INVITE when the target
identity is IMPU and target is non-local ID.
\- SUPI or IMSI stored in the LI_X2_LITE record when the target identity is
IMPI.
\- +sip.instance-id of Contact header received in the SIP REGISTER request
when the target identity is PEIIMEI or IMEI.
When an IMS UE receives an incoming IMS session (using SIP INVITE), the LMISF-
IRI examines the following to verify for a target match:
\- Request URI and To header present in the SIP INVITE when the target
identity is IMPU.
\- P-Asserted-Id, From header, History Info header and Diversion header
present in the SIP header when the target identity is IMPU and target is non-
local ID.
\- SUPI or IMSI stored in the LI_X2_LITE record when the target identity is
IMPI.
\- +sip.instance-id of Contact header received in the SIP REGISTER request
when the target identity is PEIIMEI or IMEI.
LMISF-IRI may use the Via header or the Route header to determine whether the
SIP INVITE is for an originating IMS session or a terminating IMS session.
LMISF-IRI stores the SIP Call Id to associate the subsequent SIP messages
received on the same session for a target match.
For subsequent SIP messages, the LMISF-IRI may use the stored LI_X3_LITE_S
record to determine for a target match.
###### 7.10.4.3.2.3 Service type of messaging
When the Service Type received in the LI_X1 provisioning is \"messaging\", the
LMISF-IRI examines the SIP MESSAGE for a target match as shown below:
\- For MO-SMS over IP, P-Preferred Identity header and From header present in
the SIP MESSAGE when the target identity is IMPU.
\- For MO-SMS over IP, TP-DA field of SMS-SUBMIT within the Message-body of
SIP MESSAGE when the target identity IMPU for target non-local ID.
\- For MT-SMS over IP, the Request URI and To header present in the SIP
MESSAGE when the target identity is IMPU.
\- For MT-SMS over IP, the TP-OA field or TP-RA field of SMS-SUBMIT within the
Message-body SIP MESSAGE when the target identity IMPU for target non-local
ID.
\- SUPI or IMSI stored in the LI_X2_LITE record when the target identity is
IMPI.
\- +sip.instance-id of Contact header received in the SIP REGISTER request
when the target identity is PEIIMEI or IMEI.
LMISF-IRI may use the Via header or the Route header to determine whether the
SIP MESSAGE is for MO-SMS over IP or MT-SMS over IP.
##### 7.10.4.3.3 xIRIs
The xIRIs generated at the LMISF-IRI shall be same as the xIRIs generated in
the IRI-POIs present in the IMS signaling functions (see clause 7.12.4.12).
As defined in TS 33.127 [5] the LMISF-IRI generates the following xIRIs:
\- Encapsulated SIP message.
\- Start of interception with an established IMS session.
The xIRI CC Unavailable defined in TS 33.127 [5] for IMS-based services is not
applicable to N9HR LI and S8HR LI. The encapsulated SIP message is sent using
the xIRI IMSMessage record.
Further details of the xIRIs are defined in clause 7.12.4.12.
#### 7.10.4.4 Triggering of BBIFF-C from LMISF over LI_T1
##### 7.10.4.4.1 General
When the intercepted IMS-session requires the media interception, the LMISF-
IRI sends a trigger to the BBIFF-C/BBIFF over to the LI_T1 interface (see TS
33.127 [5]) with LMISF-CC as the delivery end point.
The LMISF-IRI upon discovering through the xIRIs received over the LI_X2_LITE
interface that a change in SMF or SGW-C/SGW has occurred for an interception
involving an IMS-session shall send the trigger to BBFF-C/BBIFF present in the
new SMF or SGW-C/SGW over LI_T1 interface with LMISF-CC as the delivery end
point to continue the IMS media interception when required.
When the IMS session is completely released (e.g. all session-legs are
released), the LMISF-IRI sends a trigger to the BBIFF-C/BBIFF to stop the
media intereption. The LMISF-IRI may also send the trigger to stop the media
interception when the target information is deprovisioned in the LMISF-IRI by
the LIPF.
NOTE: When multiple warrants are active on a target, the activation or
deactivation of a warrant may not result in a trigger to BBIFF-C./BBIFF (e.g.
if a trigger has already been sent due to other warrants).
The present document supports the media interception of IMS voice media.
##### 7.10.4.4.2 N9HR LI
The LI_T1 trigger that the LMISF-IRI sends to the BBIFF-C present in the SMF
shall include at least the following information:
\- The XID that LMISF-IRI receives from the LIPF over LI_X1 for the target
related activation.
\- Target identity: SUPI, PDU session ID, IMS voice media.
\- Delivery end point: LMISF-CC.

#### 7.10.4.5 Triggering of BBIFF-U from BBIFF-C over LI_T3
##### 7.10.4.5.1 General
When the trigger is received over the LI_T1 for activating the media
interception, the BBIFF-C present in the SGW-C shall send a trigger over LI_T3
to the BBIFF-U present in the SGW-U when a dedicated bearer for the IMS media
is established on the PDN connection.
When the trigger is received over the LI_T1 for activating the media
interception, the BBIFF-C present in the SMF shall send a trigger over LI_T3
to the BBIFF-U present in the UPF when the PDU session is modified for adding
IMS media related QoS flow.
If the trigger over LI_T1 is received for activating the media interception
after the IMS media related changes has happened (i.e. dedicated bearer is
established for IMS media, PDU session is modified for adding the IMS media
related QoS flow), then the BBIFF-C shall send the trigger to the BBIFF-U over
LI_T3 immediately.
The BBIFF-C shall trigger the BBIFF-U to stop the delivery of xCC to the
LMISF-CC when it receives the trigger from the LMISF-IRI over LI_T1 for
stopping the media interception, independent of whether the IMS media related
changes have happened or not.
##### 7.10.4.5.2 N9HR LI
The LI_T3 trigger that the BBIFF-C in SMF sends to the BBIFF-U present in the
UPF shall include at least the following information:
\- XID assigned locally by the BBIFF-C in the SMF.
\- The Product ID that includes the XID it receives from the LMISF-IRI over
LI_T1.
\- Target identity: PFCP Session ID, PDR ID with the QFI associated with the

* * *
The DeactivateTask sent to the BBIFF-U present in the SGW-U over LI_T3 shall
include the XID of the Task created by the ActivateTask message (see table
7.10.4.5-2).
#### 7.10.4.6 Generation of xCC over LI_X3_LITE_M
The BBIFF-U in UPF and the BBIFF-U in SGW-U shall send the xCC over
LI_X3_LITE_M for each of the packet matching the criteria specified in the
Triggering message (i.e. Activate Task message) received over the LI_T3 from
the BBIFF-C.
The BBIFF in SGW shall identify the IMS voice media (QCI = 1) related
dedicated bearer associated with the IMS signaling related bearer as indicated
in the trigger received over the LI_T1 from the LMISF-IRI and then send xCC
over LI_X3_LITE_M for each of the packet captured from that dedicated bearer.
The BBIFF-U/BBIFF shall set the payload format to indicate the appropriate
payload type (5 for IPv4 Packet, 6 for IPv6 Packet, or 12 for GTP-U Packet as
described in ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clauses 5.4 and 5.4.13).
#### 7.10.4.7 Generation of xCC over LI_X3
The xCC generated at the LMISF-CC shall be same as the xCC generated in the
CC-POIs present in the IMS media functions. Further details of this are not
specified in the present document.
The correlation identifier value included in the xCC of an IMS session can be
dependent on the UDP port numbers associated with the voice-media related RTP
streams. This is the case when a user is involved in multiple IMS sessions. An
illustrated of this is shown in clause 7.10.4.8
#### 7.10.4.8 Correlation identifier
The xIRIs generated at the LMISF-IRI shall be correlated using the correlation
identifier field defined ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8]. This correlation identifier
value can be independent of the correlation identifier value received in the
xCC from the BBIFF-U/BBIFF over the LI_X3_LITE_S interface.
Furthermore, the xIRIs generated at the LMISF_IRI shall include the
correlation identifier value used in the xCC generated at the LMISF-CC. Any
intra-LMISF interactions required to associate the correlation identifier
values used by the LMISF-IRI and LMISF-CC are outside the scope of the present
document.
Each session-leg of an IMS session may have to be correlated separately. This
is accomplished using the RTP/RTCP port numbers present in the SDP of IMS
signaling message and the UDP port numbers present in the IMS voice media
related RTP as illustrated in figure 7.10.4.8-1 below.
Figure 7.10.4.8-1: Correlation at the session-leg level (an illustration)
Figure 7.10.4.8-1 illustrates an example where an IMS session includes two
session-legs.
Session-leg 1:
\- Source IP address: 192.0.2.10 and source port number: 24000 (RTP), 24001
(RTCP).
\- Destination IP address: 198.51.100.1 and destination port number: 32000
(RTP), 32001 (RTCP).
Session-leg 2:
\- Source IP address: 192.0.2.10 and source port number: 26000 (RTP), 26001
(RTCP).
\- Destination IP address: 198.51.100.1 and destination port number: 36000
(RTP), 36001 (RTCP).
The IP address of the two end-points happen to be the same for the two session
legs. The RTP port numbers present in the SDP of IMS signaling message and the
UDP port numbers of the associated with the IMS voice-media related RTP happen
to be the same for a session-leg.
Therefore, in general, multiple session-legs can be identified using the RTP
port numbers present in the SDP of IMS signaling message and the UDP port
numbers associated with the IMS voice-media related RTP.
#### 7.10.4.9 Generation of IRI over LI_HI2
When an xIRI is received over LI_X2 from the LMISF-IRI, the MDF2 shall send
the IRI message over LI_HI2 without undue delay. The IRI message shall contain
a copy of the relevant record received from LI_X2. The record may be enriched
by other information available at the MDF (e.g. additional location
information).
The IRI messages delivered over the LI_HI2 for HR LI are same as the IRI
messages delivered over the LI_HI2 for LI IMS-based voice services. Further
details of this are outside the scope of the present document.
#### 7.10.4.10 Generation of CC over LI_HI3
When the xCC is received over LI_X3 from the LMISF-CC, the MDF3 shall deliver
the CC over LI_HI3 without undue delay.
The CC delivered over the LI_HI3 for HR LI is the same as the CC delivered
over the LI_HI3 for LI IMS-based voice services. Further details of this are
outside the scope of the present document.
## 7.11 STIR/SHAKEN and RCD/eCNAM
### 7.11.1 Provisioning over LI_X1
#### 7.11.1.1 General
When the interception of STIR/SHAKEN is required, the LIPF shall provision the
IRI-POI present in the following IMS NFs for the reporting of signing and
verification results, as applicable:
\- IBCF.
\- Telephony AS.
If the IRI-POI functions in IBCF or Telephony AS are already provisioned for
IMS-based services, then separate provisioning is not required. However, the
\"ReportDiversionPASSporTInfo\" shall be included, as specified in clause
7.11.1.2, as a part of provisioning the IRI-POIs in Telephony AS and IBCF for
IMS-based services.
NOTE: The P-CSCF and LMISF-IRI may also provide IRI-POI functions for
reporting of STIR/SHAKEN validation results when the target (or user
communicating with the target non-local ID) is roaming (P-CSCF with LBO and
LMIF-IRI with home-routed). However, separate provisioning of those IRI-POIs
for STIR/SHAKEN is not required.
#### 7.11.1.2 Provisioning of the IRI-POI in the IMS network functions
The LIPF provisions the IRI-POIs present in the NFs mentioned in 7.11.1.1
using the X1 protocol as described in clause 5.2.2 with the following target
identifier formats as defined in the ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] messages (or
equivalent if ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] is not used):
\- IMPU.
The \"div\" PASSporT information for the redirecting party (ies) when the IMS
session is redirected later on the signaling path may have to be reported to
some LEAs. To identify the need for such reporting, a parameter
\"ReportDiversionPASSporTInfo\" shall be included as part of ActivateTask
message.
Table 7.11.1.2-1 shows the minimum details of the LI_X1 ActivateTask message
used for provisioning the IRI-POI in the Telephony AS, IBCF, for separate
provisioning case, for STIR/SHAKEN and RCD/eCNAM.

#### 7.11.2.3 Signature validation
The IRI-POI present in the Telephony AS or IBCF, shall generate an xIRI
containing a STIRSHAKENSignatureValidation record when the following
conditions are met:
\- Either IBCF or Telephony AS, is interacting with the VERIFICATION AS.
Whether it is the Telephony AS or IBCF for sessions is based on network
configuration and local policy of the CSP as described in clause 7.11.2.5.
\- With one or more of the following are true:
\- Request URI and To Headers of SIP INVITE request received from S-CSCF (in
the case of Telephony AS) or from the previous IP network (in the case of
IBCF) is a target identity.
\- One or more of P-Asserted Identity, From, Diversion, History-Info Headers
of SIP INVITE request received from S-CSCF (in the case of Telephony AS) or
from the previous IP network (in the case of IBCF) is a target non-local
identity without any prior intra-network diversions.
\- If PASSporTs are received in the SIP INVITE request, they are submitted by
the IBCF to the VERIFICATION AS for validation and the result is included in
an outgoing SIP INVITE request together with possible RCD data or eCNAM data
as Call-Info headers.
\- If PASSporTs are received in the SIP INVITE request, they are submitted by
the Telephony AS to the VERIFICATION AS for validation and the validation
result is received from the Verification AS and the outgoing SIP INVITE
possibly includes RCD data or eCNAM data as Call-Info headers.
NOTE: The IRI-POI may use the Via headers, Record-route headers to determine
any prior intra-network diversions.
The IRI-POI present in the Telephony AS shall also generate an xIRI containing
a STIRSHAKENSignatureValidation record when it detects the following
conditions:
\- Session is redirected.
\- Request URI header of outgoing SIP INVITE is a target identity.
\- Validation result is included in the outgoing SIP INVITE with the possible
the RCD data and the eCNAM data as Call-Info headers.
The IRI-POI present in the LMISF-IRI or P-CSCF shall generate an xIRI
containing a STIRSHAKENSignatureValidation record when the following
conditions are met:
\- With one or more of the following are true:
\- Request URI or To header of SIP INVITE request sent to the UE is a target
identity.
\- One or more of P-Asserted Identity, From, Diversion, History-Info Headers
of SIP INVITE request sent to the UE is a target non-local identity.
\- SIP INVITE request sent to the UE includes SIP Call-Info headers containing
possible RCD data or eCNAM data, and the result of the PASSporT verification.
In the above paragraphs, a validation result (i.e. result of all PASSporT
verification) is included means a \"verstat\" parameter within the P-Asserted
Identity header is included in the outgoing SIP INVITE.
The following table contains parameters, with IRITargetIdentifier, generated
by the IRI-POI.

When the termination network performs SHAKEN verification, one of the
following values shall be assigned to the SHAKEN validation result parameter
as part of the display information: \"TN-Validation-Passed\", \"TN-Validation-
Failed\", or \"No-TN-Validation\". In case of TN-Validation-Failed, the SHAKEN
failure status code shall be present and coded as an integer. The SHAKEN
failure status codes are at least, according to RFC 8224 and to IANA Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters [75]:
\- 403 **\"** Stale Date**\"** response code is sent when the verification
service receives a request with a Date header field value that is older than
the local policy of the CSP for freshness permits. The same response may be
used when the \"iat\" has a value older than the local policy of the CSP for
freshness permits.
\- **428 \"Use Identity Header\" response code is sent when the verification
service receives a SIP request that lacks an Identity header. This is to
indicate that the request should be re-sent with an Identity header.**
\- **436 \"Bad Identity-Info\" response code is used to indicate an inability
to acquire the credentials needed by the verification service for validating
the signature in an Identity header field.**
\- **437 \"Unsupported Credential\" response code is used when the
verification service cannot validate the certificate referenced by the URI of
the Identity-Info header, for reasons such as failing to trust the issuing
certification authority (CA) or failing to support the algorithm with which
the credential was signed.**
\- **438 \"Invalid Identity Header\" response code is used to indicate that of
the set of Identity header fields in a request, no header field with a valid
and supported Identity token has been received.**

### 7.11.3 Generation of IRI over LI_HI2
When an xIRI is received over LI_X2 from an IRI-POI, the MDF2 shall generate
the corresponding IRI message and deliver over LI_HI2 without undue delay. The
IRI message shall contain a copy of the relevant record
(STIRSHAKENSignatureGeneration or STIRSHAKENSignatureValidation) received in
the xIRI over LI_X2.
The MDF2 shall able to remove information regarded as content from RCD or
eCNAM parameters in the case of an IRI-only warrant. The details of what needs
to be removed and under what circumstances are outside the scope of the
present document.
The timeStamp field of the ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] PSHeader structure shall be
set to the time present in the timestamp field of the xIRI.
The threeGPP33128DefinedIRI field (see ETSI TS 102 232-7 [10] clause 15) shall
be populated with the BER-encoded IRIPayload.
The STIRSHAKENSignatureGeneration and STIRSHAKENSignatureValidation IRI
messages shall have the same CIN as in the other IRI messages delivered for
the IMS session (see ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] clause 5.2.4).

## 7.12 LI for IMS based services
### 7.12.1 General
The present document provides two options for stage 3 definitions for
implementing IMS LI:
\- Use LI_X1, LI_X2 and LI_X3 interfaces specified below in the present
document.
\- Use TS 33.107 [36] and TS 33.108 [12] natively as defined in that document.
In both cases, the present document specifies the stage 3 for the LI_HI1,
LI_HI2 and LI_HI3 interfaces.
### 7.12.2 Overview
#### 7.12.2.1 General
This clause defines protocol and procedures to support the LI for IMS-based
services. The scope of LI functions defined here are based on the IMS LI
architecture defined in TS 33.127 [5] that includes:
\- Target type -- local ID, non-local ID.
\- Roaming considerations -- local break-out (LBO), home-routed (HR).
\- Service specific aspects - normal sessions, redirected sessions,
conferencing, STIR/SHAKEN, RCD/eCNAM.
\- Location reporting.
The IMS LI shall apply to all IMS-based services unless restricted by the
service scoping as defined in clause 4.4 of the present document. When
restricted by the service scoping, the IMS LI applies only to service types
listed in table C.2 of ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7]). Clause 7.12.2.5 provides
further details of IMS LI with service scoping.
As defined in TS 33.127 [5], the NFs that provide the IRI-POI and CC-TF are in
the IMS signaling functions that handle the SIP messages and the NFs that
provide the CC-POI are in the IMS media functions. The media interception in
the packet core network (EPC or 5GC) is outside the scope of the present
document.
For some of the services listed above, an alternate deployment option in
addition to the default option is also specified in TS 33.127 [5]. The NFs
that provide the IRI-POI, CC-TF and CC-POI in the alternate deployment option
can be different.
The LIPF provisioning scenarios for IMS LI is illustrated in TR 33.928 [121].
#### 7.12.2.2 Target type and target identifiers
An IMS user served by the CSP can be the target or can be in communication
with a target non-local ID. In the former case, the target can also be an
outbound roaming IMS user or an inbound roaming IMS user (see clause
7.12.2.3).
NOTE: A target non-local ID is identified distinctly through the provisioning.
The following target identifier formats (ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7]) can be used to
identify a target for IMS based services:
\- IMPU.
\- IMPI.
\- PEIIMEI.
\- IMEI.
When service scoping is applicable, additional target identities may be used
in LI for IMS based specific services (e.g. MCPTT ID for PTC). The details of
such additional target identities are provided in the service specific clauses
of the present document.
The target identity in the IMPI format may contain a value derived from a SUPI
or an IMSI. The target identity in the IMPU format containing a SIP URI or TEL
URI may contain a value derived from a SIP URI, TEL URI, GPSI, MSISDN, an
E.164 number or IMSI. Only IMPU is used for target non-local ID.
#### 7.12.2.3 Roaming considerations
An IMS user who is the target, or in communication with the target non-local
ID, can be part of the following roaming scenarios for the LI purpose:
\- Non-roaming.
\- Outbound roaming with HR.
\- Outbound roaming with LBO.
\- Inbound roaming with HR.
\- Inbound roaming with LBO.
The details of LI functions for the case of inbound roaming with HR are
described in clause 7.10.
#### 7.12.2.4 Service specific aspects
##### 7.12.2.4.1 General
The NFs that provide the IRI-POI, CC-TF and CC-POI functions can be different
depending on the IMS session scenarios the target, or the IMS user in
communication with a target non-local ID, is involved in.
An IMS user shall be considered to be in communications with a target non-
local ID even if the session is redirected from that target non-local ID.
##### 7.12.2.4.2 LI for normal sessions
This includes LI for session originations and session terminations.
LI for session originations applies when an IMS session is originated by an
IMS user whose communications are intercepted either because that originating
IMS user happens to be a target or because that originating IMS user happens
to be in communications with a target non-local ID. The originating IMS user
can also be inbound roaming (LBO or HR) or outbound roaming (LBO or HR).
LI for session terminations applies when an IMS session is terminated to an
IMS user whose communications are intercepted either because that terminating
IMS user happens to be a target or because that terminating IMS user happens
to be in communications with a target non-local ID. The terminating IMS user
can also be inbound roaming (LBO or HR) or outbound roaming (LBO or HR).
The other party can be within the same CSP domain (intra-CSP sessions) or in
another CSP domain (inter-CSP sessions). In the latter case, the other CSP can
be CS-based or IP-based. For target non-local ID, the session is always an
inter-CSP session.
##### 7.12.2.4.3 LI for redirected sessions
This includes LI for the incoming IMS sessions that are redirected.
LI for redirected sessions applies when a terminating session to a target is
redirected to (or forwarded to) another user. Either the target (i.e.
redirecting party) or the redirected-to party can be outbound roaming (LBO or
HR).
The redirected-to party can be in the same CSP domain as that of initial
terminating party (i.e. redirecting party) or can be a another CSP domain. In
the latter case, the other CSP can be CS-based or IP-based. The LI for
redirected sessions in the VPLMN are handed as LI for session terminations.
##### 7.12.2.4.4 LI for conferencing
This includes the LI for conferencing services.
LI for conferencing services applies when a target initiates a multi-party
conferencing session or when a target joins a \"meet-me\" conferenceing
session or when a \"meet me\" conferencing session is established with
conferencing URI itself being the target.
When a target happens to be one of the participant of a conference initiated
by another IMS user, the LI for normal sessions (see clause 7.12.2.4.2)
applies.
##### 7.12.2.4.5 STIR/SHAKEN
This includes the LI for STIR/SHAKEN when signature is signed or verified in
an IMS session involving a target as described in TS 33.127 [5].
The further details of LI for STIR/SHAKEN are described in clause 7.11.
##### 7.12.2.4.6 RCD/eCNAM
This includes the LI for RCD/eCNAM when enhanced calling name is included in a
terminating IMS session involving a target as described in TS 33.127 [5].
The further details of LI for RCD/eCNAM are described in clause 7.11.
#### 7.12.2.5 Service scoping
##### 7.12.2.5.1 General
LI for IMS-based services shall support service scoping with the following
specific service types:
\- Voice.
\- PTC.
\- Messaging.
\- RCS.
\- LALS.
When an NF is involved in the handling of one or more of the above mentioned
IMS-based services (e.g. voice, messaging at the S-CSCF), the LI functions
within that NF shall limit the interception to the service type to which the
warrant applies. However, type of service used by a UE may not be known when
an IMS session begins, or if known, may change while, or after, the session is
established. Therefore, the present document limits the applicability of
service-based interception to the media only.
The present document supports service-based interception to signaling as well
media when the NF is involved in the handling of a specific service mentioned
above (e.g. PTC server for PTC).
When service scoping is not applicable, the delivery of IRI and CC for IMS-
based services are done independent of service types. Location reporting
aspects that are also part of the service scoping are described in clause
7.12.2.6.
##### 7.12.2.5.2 LI for voice
This includes the LI for IMS-based voice services.
LI for IMS-based voice services applies to the interception of IMS-based voice
media for the IMS sessions involving the targets if and only if the m-line in
the SDP answer includes either one of the following:
\- Audio.
\- Text.
For the generation and delivery of IRI for the IMS sessions, the LI for IMS-
based voice is handled independent of the m-line in the SDP.
If the m-line includes \"audio\" and \"video\" then only audio part of the
media is intercepted.
It is possible that SDP offer and SDO answer may have different information in
m-line. The determination on whether to intercept the voice media is based on
the final outcome of SDP offer and answer, which happens to be in the SDP
answer.
The media associated with an IMS session may also change in the middle of a
session using the re-INVITE procedures invoked by either of the parties
involved in the session. Accordingly, the interception of voice media may
resume or cease in the middle of an IMS session based media type negotiated at
the conclusion the related SDP offer and answer.
NOTE: The present document excludes the m-line values of video, msrp, image,
application and other, for Service Type of \"voice\" while determining the
media interception (i.e. CC delivery).
##### 7.12.2.5.3 LI for Messaging
This includes LI for SMS over IP and MSRP originated from, or terminated to, a
target.
LI for SMS over IP originated from a target applies to the interception of a
SIP MESSAGE originated from an IMS user who happens to be a target or happens
to be receiving a SIP MESSAGE that has originated from a target non-local ID.
That IMS user can also be inbound roaming (LBO or HR) or outbound roaming (LBO
or HR).
LI for SMS over IP terminated to a target applies to the interception of a SIP
MESSAGE terminated to an IMS user who happens to be a target or happens to be
sending the SIP MESSAGE to a target non-local ID. That IMS user can also be
inbound roaming (LBO or HR) or outbound roaming (LBO or HR).
LI for MSRP applies to the interception of media for the IMS sessions
involving the targets if and only if MSRP is included in the m-line of the SDP
answer. For the generation and delivery of IRI for the IMS sessions, the LI
for messaging is handled independent of the m-line in the SDP.
When service scoping applies, the LI for Messaging (i.e. SMS over IP or MSRP)
is provided if and only if the \"messaging\" service type is included as a
part of LI provisioning. If no service type is provisioned, service scoping
does not apply and the LI for messaging shall be provided (per clause 4.4.2).
##### 7.12.2.5.4 LI for voice-mail
This includes LI for IMS-based voice services (see clause 7.12.2.5.3) when an
incoming voice session to an IMS user who happens to be a target or an
incoming voice session to an IMS user from a target non-local ID is redirected
to a voice mail server.
When the incoming session happens to be from a target non-local ID to an IMS
user, the retrieval of the voice message from the voice mail server is not
intercepted. However, when the IMS user who happens to be the target, the
retrieval of the voice message from the voice-mail server may be intercepted
in the network that handles the IMS session initiated from the target used to
retrieve the voice message.
When service scoping applies, LI for voice-mail is provided if and only if
\"voice\" service type is included as a part of LI provisioning. If no service
type is provisioned, service scoping does not apply and the LI for voice-mail
shall be provided (per clause 4.4.2).
##### 7.12.2.5.5 LI for RCS
This includes the LI for RCS services when a target executes one of the RCS
related services described in TS 33.127 [5].
The further details of LI for RCS are described in clause 7.13.
##### 7.12.2.5.6 LI for PTC service
This includes LI for PTC when a target is engaged in a PTC service as
described in TS 33.127 [5].
The further details of LI for PTC are described in clause 7.5.
##### 7.12.2.5.7 LALS triggering
This includes the reporting of location by the LI-LCS Client triggered by the
LTF as described in TS 33.127 [5].
The further details of LALS triggering are defined in clause 7.3.
#### 7.12.2.6 Location reporting
When the location reporting is only required at the beginning and end of an
IMS session, the location is reported when an IMS session is originated (SIP
INVITE) from a target or terminating session is answered (SIP 200 OK for
INVITE) from the target or either of the two sessions are released (SIP BYE
from the target or SIP 200 OK for BYE from the target).
#### 7.12.2.7 Deployment considerations
As described in TS 33.127 [5], some of the service types may have two
deployment options denoted as \"default option\" and \"alternate option\".
As illustrated in TR 33.928 [121], the LIPF provisions the LI functions in a
NF based on the option the CSP has deployed within the network.
#### 7.12.2.8 Identifying the intercepted IMS-based communications
##### 7.12.2.8.1 General concepts
An IMS based communication is intercepted when one of the following is true:
\- The calling party identity on session originations or SMS originations is a
target.
\- The called party identity on session originations is a target non-local ID.
\- The destination party identity in SMS originations is a target non-local
ID.
\- The called party identity on session terminations or SMS terminations is a
target.
\- The calling party identity on session terminations is a target non-local
ID.
\- The origination party identity in SMS terminations is target non-local ID.
\- The redirecting party identity on session terminations is a target non-
local ID.
\- In the alternate deployment option for redirected sessions (see TS 33.127
[5]), redirecting party is a target.
\- The redirected-to party identity is a target non-local ID.
\- The conference URI in a conferencing session is a target.
The above identities are used to identify that an IMS session is intercepted
in the IRI-POI and in the CC-TF, the latter when the LI requires CC
interception. In addition, the CC-TF uses the redirecting party identity to
trigger the CC-POI even if the target is not a non-local ID.
##### 7.12.2.8.2 Target match
###### 7.12.2.8.2.1 General
When an IMS UE performs an IMS registration (using SIP REGISTER) request, the
IRI-POI/CC-TF examines the following for a target match:
\- From header and To header of the SIP REGISTER when the target identity is
IMPU.
\- +sip.instance-id of Contact header of the SIP REGISTER when the target
identity is PEIIMEI or IMEI.
\- Digest username of Authorization header of the SIP REGISTER when the target
identity is IMPI.
NOTE: The SIP REGISTER that carries the Authorization header is sent in
response when the initial Registration is challenged.
A target match for SIP REGISTER can only be done when the NF where the IRI-POI
resides is in the path of the SIP REGISTER flow (e.g. P-CSCF, S-CSCF).
###### 7.12.2.8.2.2 Session based IMS services
This clause describes the method used to identify a session-based IMS service
such as IMS-based voice service.
When an IMS session is originated from an IMS UE (using SIP INVITE), the IRI-
POI/CC-TF examines the following to verify for a target match:
\- P-Asserted Identity header and From header present in the SIP INVITE when
the target identity is IMPU.
\- Request URI header and To header present in the SIP INVITE when the target
identity is IMPU and target is non-local ID.
\- Digest username of Authorization header of the SIP REGISTER when the target
identity is IMPI.
\- +sip.instance-id of Contact header received in the SIP REGISTER request
when the target identity is PEIIMEI or IMEI.
The use of Request URI header and To header present in the SIP INVITE for
matching target non-local ID is done on the redirected sessions irrespective
of whether the session is originated from an IMS UE.
When an IMS session is terminated at an IMS UE (using SIP INVITE), the IRI-
POI/CC-TF examines the following to verify for a target match:
\- Request URI and To header present in the SIP INVITE when the target
identity is IMPU.
\- P-Asserted-Identity, From header, History Info header and Diversion header
present in the SIP INVITE when the target identity is IMPU and target is non-
local ID.
\- Digest username of Authorization header of the SIP REGISTER when the target
identity is IMPI.
\- +sip.instance-id of Contact header received in the SIP REGISTER request
when the target identity is PEIIMEI or IMEI.
NOTE: IRI-POI/CC-TF that uses the information received in the SIP REGISTER to
perform a target match cannot do such a target match unless the NF is on the
signaling path of SIP REGISTER flow.
In addition, the IRI-POI in the alternate deployment option (TS 33.127 [5])
and CC-TF, examine the following to verify a target match when an IMS session
is terminated to an IMS UE:
\- History Info header and Diversion header present in the SIP INVITE when the
target identity is IMPU and the target is not a non-local ID.
For conference sessions, the IRI-POI and CC-TF examine the following to verify
a target match:
\- P-Asserted-Identity, From header present in the SIP INVITE when a target
initiates a conference session or when the target joins a \"meet-me\"
conference session.
\- Conference URI present in the SIP INVITE when the conference URI is the
target.
IRI-POI/CC-TF may use the Via header or the Route header to determine whether
the SIP INVITE is for an originating IMS session or a terminating IMS session.
IRI-POI/CC-TF stores (locally) the SIP Call Id to associate the subsequent SIP
messages received on the same session for a target match.
###### 7.12.2.8.2.3 Session independent IMS services
This clause describes the method used to identify a session-independent IMS
service (i.e. SMS over IP).
For SMS over IP, the SIP MESSAGE includes \"vnd.3gpp.sms\" as the MIME Content
Type in the payload with RP-DATA or RP-ACK as the content, see 3GPP TS 24.341
[102].
For MSISDN-less SMS over IP (i.e. SIP URI instead of MSISDN), SIP MESSAGE
additionally includes \"vnd.3gpp.sms+xml\" as the MIME Content Type in the
payload with destination or origination addresses, see 3GPP TS 24.341 [102].
The target match for the SIP MESSAGE is done as shown below:
\- For MO-SMS over IP, the P-Asserted Identity header and From header present
in the SIP MESSAGE when the target identity is IMPU.
\- For MO-SMS over IP, the TP-DA field of SMS-SUBMIT within the Message-body
of SIP MESSAGE when the target identity is IMPU for target non-local ID.
\- For MO-SMS over IP, the \ field within the XML body of the content type
\"vnd.3gpp.sms+xml\" present in the Message-body of SIP MESSAGE when the
target identity is IMPU for target non-local ID. In this case, the TP_DA field
of SMS-SUBMIT is be set to dummy MSISDN, see 3GPP TS 24.341 [102].
\- For MT-SMS over IP, the Request URI and To header present in the SIP
MESSAGE when the target identity is IMPU.
\- For MT-SMS over IP, the TP-OA field or TP-RA field of SMS-DELIVER or SMS-
STATUS-REPORT within the Message-body SIP MESSAGE when the target identity
IMPU for target non-local ID.
\- For MSISDN-less MT-SMS over IP, the \ field within the XML body of
the content type \"vnd.3gpp.sms+xml\" present in the Message-body of SIP
MESSAGE when the target identity is IMPU for target non-local ID. In this
case, the TP_OA of SMS-DELIVER or TP-RA field of SMS-STATUS-REPORT may be set
to dummy MSISDN, see 3GPP TS 24.341 [102].
\- Digest username of Authorization header of the SIP REGISTER when the target
identity is IMPI.
\- +sip.instance-id of Contact header received in the SIP REGISTER request
when the target identity is PEIIMEI or IMEI.
NOTE: IRI-POI/CC-TF that uses the information received in the SIP REGISTER to
perform a target match cannot do such a target match unless the NF is on the
signaling path of SIP REGISTER flow.
IRI-POI may use the Via header or the Route header to determine whether the
SIP MESSAGE is for MO-SMS over IP or MT-SMS over IP.
#### 7.12.2.9 Handling of correlation information
The IRI records delivered to the LEMF over the LI_HI2 and the CC delivered to
the LEMF over LI_HI3 shall be correlated.
According to the protocol defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] and ETSI TS 103
221-2 [8], the xIRI messages and the xCC carry the CorrelationID which enables
the MDF2 and MDF3 to provide the needed correlation between the IRI and CC.
When the CC-POI is triggered by a CC-TF, the CC-TF sends the CorrelationID to
the CC-POI over the LI_T3 interface in the ActivateTask message. The CC-POI
uses that CorrelationID in the xCC sent to the MDF3.
NOTE: The IRI-POI and CC-POI may be provided within the same NF (e.g. PTC
Server, RCS Server). When the CC-POI is triggered from a CC-TF, the IRI-POI
and CC-TF may be provided within the same NF (e.g. P-CSCF, AS/MRFC) or in
different NFs (e.g. IRI-POI in S-CSCF and CC-TF in P-CSCF).
When the IRI-POI and CC-POI (or CC-TF in a triggerred CC-POI case) are in the
same NF, the procedures can be similar to the way the correlation of xIRI and
xCC are done in the packet core system (e.g. IRI-POI and CC-TF in the SMF).
The details of any needed interactions between those LI functions are not
defined in the present document.
When the IRI-POI and CC-TF are in separate NFs, any additional procedures that
may be needed are also implementation specific and the details of the same are
not described in the present document.
### 7.12.3 Provisioning over LI_X1
#### 7.12.3.1 General
The LIPF shall provision the IRI-POIs, CC-TFs, MDF2 and MDF3 over LI_X1 for
IMS-based services using the X1 protocol as described in clause 5.2.2.
The clause 7.12.2.2 provides a list of target identifiers that shall be
supported for IMS based services in a general sense.
The target identifiers used during the provisioning over LI_X1 for a specific
IMS-based service (e.g. PTC) are listed in the respective service specific
clauses.
#### 7.12.3.2 Provisioning of IRI-POI

### 7.12.4 Generation of xIRIs over LI_X2
#### 7.12.4.1 IRI-POIs in IMS signaling functions
##### 7.12.4.1.1 General
The IRI-POIs present in the NFs provisioned as shown in table 7.12.3.3-1
generate the xIRIs according to the conditions described in TS 33.127 [5] and
illustrated in TR 33.928 [121].
As described in TS 33.127 [5], clause 7.12.3.2.2 and illustrated in TR 33.928
[121], the present document supports two deployment options:
\- Default option.
\- Alternate option.
The options used for LI involving a specific IMS service may be different from
the option used for LI involving another IMS service. For example, a default
option may be used for target non-local ID and an alternate option may be used
for a local target ID.
NOTE: One of the obvious conditions not stated in the subsequent clauses is
that an NF can provide an IRI-POI functions if and only if the SIP signaling
messages pass through that NF.
When a condition (e.g. inbound roaming with LBO) under which an NF provides
the IRI-POI functions is dependent on the handling of SIP REGISTER message,
the IRI-POIs may have to scan the SIP REGISTER for all IMS users to address
the case when that IMS user engages in a communication with a target non-local
ID.
##### 7.12.4.1.2 IRI-POI in P-CSCF
###### 7.12.4.1.2.1 Session-based IMS communications
In the default deployment option, the P-CSCF provides the IRI-POI functions
when any of the following conditions are met:
\- The target is inbound roaming (with LBO) IMS user and is not registered for
emergency services. The E-CSCF provides the IRI-POI functions when the target
is registered for the emergency services.
\- An inbound roaming (with LBO) IMS user is in communication with a target
non-local ID.
In the alternate deployment option, the P-CSCF always provides the IRI-POI
functions except for the following cases:
\- A non-roaming or outbound roaming (with HR) IMS user in communication with
a target non-local ID. The S-CSCF provides the IRI-POI functions for such a
case.
\- An inbound roaming (with LBO) IMS user is in communication with a target
non-local ID when the media is home-routed. The IBCF provides the IRI-POI
functions for such a case.
With the above conditions met, the IRI-POI present in the P-CSCF identifies
that an IMS-based communication is to be intercepted according to clause
7.12.2.8.
###### 7.12.4.1.2.2 Session-independent IMS communications
In the default deployment option, the P-CSCF provides the IRI-POI functions
when any of the following conditions are met:

emergency services. If applicable, E-CSCF provides the IRI-POI functions when
IMS user is registered for emergency services.
\- An inbound roaming (with LBO) IMS user is in communication with a target
non-local ID.
In the alternate deployment option, the P-CSCF always provides the IRI-POI
functions.
With the above conditions met, the IRI-POI present in the P-CSCF identifies
that an IMS-based communication is to be intercepted according to clause
7.12.2.8.
##### 7.12.4.1.3 IRI-POI in S-CSCF
###### 7.12.4.1.3.1 Session-based IMS communications
In the default deployment option, the S-CSCF always provides the IRI-POI
functions except for the following condition:
\- The target is registered for emergency services and E-CSCF provides the
IRI-POI for IMS-based emergency services.
\- IMS user is in communication with a target non-local ID. The MGCF or IBCF
provide the IRI-POI functions for such a case.
\- The S-CSCF is not serving the target.
In the alternate deployment option, the S-CSCF provides the IRI-POI functions
when any of the following condition is met:
\- IMS user is in communication with a target non-local ID.
\- The S-CSCF is serving the IMS user in communication with the target non-
local ID.
With the above conditions met, the IRI-POI present in the S-CSCF identifies
that an IMS-based communication is to be intercepted according to clause
7.12.2.8.
###### 7.12.4.1.3.2 Session-independent IMS communications
In the default deployment option, the S-CSCF always provides the IRI-POI
functions except for the following condition:
\- The target is registered for emergency services and E-CSCF provides the
IRI-POI for IMS-based emergency services.
\- The S-CSCF is neither serving the target nor the IMS user in communication
with a target non-local ID.
In the alternate deployment option, the S-CSCF does not provide the IRI-POI
functions.
When the above conditions are met, the IRI-POI present in the S-CSCF
identifies that an IMS-based communication is to be intercepted according to
clause 7.12.2.8.
##### 7.12.4.1.4 IRI-POI in E-CSCF
In the default deployment option, the E-CSCF provides the IRI-POI functions
except for the following condition (see TR 33.928 [121]):
\- S-CSCF provides the IRI-POI for emergency services.
In the alternate deployment option, the E-CSCF does not provide the IRI-POI
functions.
When the above conditions are met, the IRI-POI present in the E-CSCF
identifies that an IMS-based communication is to be intercepted according to
clause 7.12.2.8.
##### 7.12.4.1.5 IRI-POI in IBCF
###### 7.12.4.1.5.1 Session-based IMS communications
In the default deployment option, the IBCF provides the IRI-POI functions when
any of the following conditions are met (see TR 33.928 [121]):
\- A non-roaming IMS user is in communication with a target non-local ID.
\- An outbound roaming IMS user is in communication with a target non-local
ID.
In the alternate deployment option, the IBCF shall provide the IRI-POI
functions when any of the following conditions are met:
\- The target involved is an outbound roaming (with LBO) IMS user.
\- The IMS session to a target is redirected to a user in the IP domain.
\- IMS session to a target is redirected to an outbound roaming (with LBO) IMS
user.
\- An inbound roaming (with LBO) IMS user is in communication with a target
non-local ID on an IMS session that employs home-routed media.
When the above conditions are met, the IRI-POI present in the IBCF identifies
that an IMS-based communication is to be intercepted according to clause
7.12.2.8.
###### 7.12.4.1.5.2 Session-independent IMS communications
In the default deployment option, the IBCF does not provide the IRI-POI
functions.
In the alternate deployment option, the IBCF provides the IRI-POI functions
except for the following condition:

Table 7.12.4.2-2: Void
The IRI-POI present in the IMS signaling function generating an xIRI
containing an IMSMessage record shall set:
\- The Payload Direction field in the PDU header to the direction of the
signaling message carried in the IRI payload (see ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause
5.2.6). If the signalling message was sent from the target, the Direction
Value \"3\" (sent from the target) shall be used, if the signalling message
was sent to the target, the Direction Value \"2\" (sent to the target) shall
be used; if the direction could not be determined reliably, the Direction
Value \"1\" (not known to the POI) shall be used. If the SIP message is sent
from and to the target, the Direction Value \"4\" (more than one direction)

Value \"5\" (not applicable) shall be used.
\- The conditional source IPv4 address or source IPv6 address field in the PDU
header to the source IP address of the intercepted SIP message (see ETSI TS
103 221-2 [8] clause 5.3). It shall contain the source address of the packet
from the 32-bit \"Source Address\" field in IPv4, as defined in IETF RFC 791
[34], or from the 128-bit \"Source Address\" field in IPv6, as defined in IETF
RFC 2460 [27].
\- The conditional destination IPv4 address or destination IPv6 address field
in the PDU header to the destination IP address of the intercepted SIP message
(see ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.3). It shall contain the destination

defined in IETF RFC 791 [34], or from the 128-bit \"Source Address\" field in
IPv6, as defined in IETF RFC 2460 [27].
##### 7.12.4.2.2 Start of interception with Active IMS session
The IRI-POI present in the IMS signaling function shall generate the xIRI
StartOfInterceptionForActiveIMSSession when all of the following conditions
are met:
\- The IRI-POI receives an LI_X1: ActivateTask from the LIPF.
\- The IRI-POI detects the IMS user identified by one or more of the target
identifier (s) included in the ActivateTask is on an active IMS session.
\- The-IRI-POI in the IMS signaling functions meets the criteria mentioned in
TS 33.127 [5] for providing the IRI-POI functions.
The generation of the xIRI shall be independent of the IMS media associated
with the session. If multiple IMS sessions are active at the start of
interception, a StartOfInterceptionForActiveIMSSession record shall be
generated for each active session.
The following table contains parameters, with IRITargetIdentifier, generated
by the IRI-POI.

##### 7.12.4.2.3 IMS CC Unavailable
The IRI-POI present in the IMS signaling function that also has the CC-TF
(which would have triggered the media interception at the CC-POI) shall
generate the xIRI IMSCCUnavailable when the media is not available for
interception in the CSP\'s network.
Accordingly, the IRI-POI present in the IMS signaling function that has the
CC-TF shall generate the xIRI IMSCCUnavailable when the following conditions
are met:
\- The target of interception is on an IMS session with established SDP offer
and answer.
\- The media does not enter the IMS network of the CSP that has received the
warrant. In other words, the CC-TF does not send the LI_T3 ActivateTask to the
CC-POI.
\- The CSP is required to send a notification to the LEMF when the media
interception is required but not available for the interception.
NOTE: The details of any interactions required between the IRI-POI and CC-TF
present in the same IMS Signaling Function (e.g. IBCF) is outside the scope of
the present document.

### 7.12.5 Triggering of CC-POI by CC-TF over LI_T3
#### 7.12.5.1 CC-TFs in IMS signaling functions
##### 7.12.5.1.1 General
The CC_TFs present in the NFs provisioned as shown in table 7.12.3.3-1
activate the CC-POIs according to the conditions described in TS 33.127 [5]
and illustrated in TR 33.928 [121].
NOTE 1: One of the obvious conditions not stated in the subsequent clauses is
that an NF can provide the CC-TF functions if and only if the SIP signaling
messages pass through that NF.
NOTE 2: The CC-TF functions apply only for session-based IMS communications.
When a condition (e.g. inbound roaming with LBO) under which an NF provides
the CC-TF functions is dependent on the handling of SIP REGISTER message, the
CC-TFs may have to scan the SIP REGISTER for all IMS users to address the case
when that IMS user engages in a communication with a target non-local ID.
##### 7.12.5.1.2 CC-TF in P-CSCF
The P-CSCF provides the CC-TF functions when the CC-POI functions are provided
at the IMS-AGW.
The P-CSCF always provides the CC-TF functions (based on the call direction,
of-course) except for the following cases:
\- A non-roaming IMS user in communication with a target non-local ID. IBCF or
MGCF provide the CC-TF functions for that case.
\- An outbound roaming (with LBO) IMS user is in communication with a target
non-local ID. IBCF or MGCF provide the CC-TF functions for that case.
When an inbound roaming (LBO) IMS user is in communication with a target non-
local ID, two deployment options are defined (see TS 33.127 [5]) for providing
the CC-TFs functions. The P-CSCF provides the CC-TF functions except for the
following case:
\- An inbound roaming (with LBO) IMS user is in communication with a target
non-local ID when the media is home-routed. IBCF provides the CC-TF functions
for that case.
With the above conditions met, the CC-TF present in the P-CSCF identifies that
an IMS-based communication is to be intercepted according to clause 7.12.2.8.
##### 7.12.5.1.3 CC-TF in IBCF
The IBCF provides the CC-TF functions when the CC-POI functions are provided
at the TrGW.
The IBCF provides the CC-TF functions when any of the following conditions are
met (see TR 33.928 [121]):
\- A non-roaming IMS user is in communication with a target non-local ID in
the IP domain.
\- An outbound roaming IMS user is in communication with a target non-local ID
in the IP domain.
\- IMS session is to an outbound roaming (with LBO) target.
\- An IMS session to a target is redirected to a user in the IP domain.
\- An IMS session to a target is redirected to an outbound roaming (with LBO)
IMS user.
\- An inbound roaming (with LBO) IMS user is in communication with a target
non-local ID on an IMS session that employs home-routed media and alternate
deployment option is used for media interception.
When the above conditions are met, the CC-TF present in the IBCF identifies
that an IMS-based communication is to be intercepted according to clause
7.12.2.8.
##### 7.12.5.1.4 CC-TF in MGCF
The MGCF provides the CC-TF functions when the CC-POI functions are provided
at the IM-MGW.
The MGCF provides the CC-TF functions when any of the following conditions are
met (see TR 33.928 [121]):
\- A non-roaming IMS user is in communication with a target non-local ID in
the CS domain.
\- An outbound roaming IMS user is in communication with a target non-local ID
in the CS domain.
\- An IMS session to a target is redirected to a user in the CS domain.
When the above conditions are met, the CC-TF present in the MGCF identifies
that an IMS-based communication is to be intercepted according to clause
7.12.2.8.
##### 7.12.5.1.5 CC-TF in AS/MRFC
The AS/MRFC provides the CC-TF functions when the CC-POI functions are
provided at the MRFP.
The AS/MRFC provides the CC-TF functions when the interception of IMS sessions
involving special services such as conferencing, music or tones is required.
The CC-TF present in the AS/MRFC identifies that an IMS-based communication is
to be intercepted according to clause 7.12.2.8.
#### 7.12.5.2 LI_T3 triggering details
##### 7.12.5.2.1 General
As described in clause 7.12.5.1, the CC-POI may reside in the IMS-AGW, TrGW,
IM-MGW or the MRFP. The trigger to perform the media interception is provided
by the CC-TF present in the P-CSCF, IBCF, MGCF, AS/MRFC respectively.
NOTE 1: The present document assumes that the above NFs that have the CC-TF
and the NFs that have the CC-POI interact with each other using the H.248
messages.
When the IRI-POI and the CC-TF are provided by two different NFs, the
interception of media is performed at the core-network side of the NF that has
the CC-POI. This is to align the media interception with the SDP information
reported in the xIRI.
When the IRI-POI and the CC-TF are provided by the same NF, based on the
deployment option, the interception of media can be done at the access side or
core network side of an IMS-AGW, at the peer network side or the core network
side of an TrGW. For the IM-MGW, the media interception is always done on the
core network side since the peer network is in CS domain. For the MRFP, all
sides are core network and therefore, the media interception is always on the
core network side.
The possibilities of such media interception points are illustrated in figure
7.12.5.2-1.
Figure 7.12.5.2-1: Media interception point options in the CC-POIs
NOTE 2: Even when the option of access side or peer network side is chosen,
for certain session scenarios (e.g. hold), media interception may have to be
moved to the core network side.
The time at which trigger is sent to the CC-POI has a relationship to the NF
(that has the CC-TF) handling of SIP messages that carry the SDP offer and SDP
answer as those SIP messages result in the NF (that has the CC-TF)
creating/modifying the media contexts at the NF that handles the media.
The procedures used to activate (i.e. trigger) the media interception at the
CC-POI present in IMS-AGW, TrGW and IM-MGW are the same. The procedures used
to activate (i.e. trigger) the media interception at the MRFP can be different
due to the nature of media functions provided by the MRFP can be different
(e.g. conferencing, announcements).
##### 7.12.5.2.2 Activation Task
###### 7.12.5.2.2.1 Overview
The ActivateTask message over the LI_T3 interface is sent from CC-TF to CC-POI
as a trigger to start the media interception at the CC-POI. The details of the
ActivateTask are as shown in table 7.12.5.2.2-1:
Table 7.12.5.2.2-1: ActivateTask message for triggering the CC-POI over LI_T3
* * *
ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] field name Description M/C/O XID Allocated by the CC-TF
as per ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7]. M TargetIdentifiers IP address and the UDP port
number are to be used at the CC-POI in identifying the IMS media that needs to
be intercepted. See table 7.12.5.2.2-2. M DeliveryType Set to \"X3Only\". M
ListOfDIDs Shall give the DID of the MDF3 to which the xCC should be
delivered. The delivery endpoint is configured using the CreateDestination
message as described in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.3.1 prior to the task
activation. M CorrelationID This value is set by the CC-TF and shall be same
as the value to be used in the xCC generated at the CC-POI. M ProductID Shall
be set to the XID of the Task Object associated with the interception at the
CC-TF. This value shall be used by the CC-POI to fill the XID field of xCC
sent over LI_X3 to the MDF3. M TaskDetailsExtensions/SDP See table
7.12.5.2.2-3. M
* * *
Along with the IP address and UDP port number, a few additional identifiers
are needed for the media interception. These are shown as
TargetIdentifierExtension in table 7.12.5.2.2-2 and TaskDetailsExtensions in

The IP address and the UDP port number as target identifiers give the
destination address at the UDP layer of the to-be intercepted media. For
symmetric media, the same IP address and UDP port number give the source
address at the UDP layer of the to-be-intercepted media in the reverse
direction.
The H248ContextID identifies the identity of the media context created at the
IMS Media Function using the H.248 Add Context message.
The TriggerScope indicates whether IP address and UDP port number included as
the target identifiers in the LI_T3 ActivateTask are to be used for
bidirectional media or unidirectional media. In the latter case, a separate
trigger shall be sent to intercept media in the reverse direction.
\"Bidirectional\" and \"Unidirectional\" are the values that can be set for
the TriggerScope by the CC-TF in the ActivateTask message.
When the TriggerScope is \"Unidirectional\", the IP address and UDP port
number identify the destination IP address and the UDP port number of the
intercepted IMS media stream. When the TriggerScope is \"Bidirectional\", the
IP address and UDP port number identify the destination IP address and UDP
port number of the incoming intercepted IMS media and the source IP address
and UDP port number of the outgoing IMS media.
The PayloadDirectionAssignment field indicates the direction of the media
stream destined to the IP address and UDP port number (indicated as target
identifiers in the ActivateTask) from the perspective of the target.
\"FromTarget\", \"ToTarget\" and \"NotDetermined\" are the values that can be
set for this by the CC-TF in the ActivateTask message.
The LocalSDP provides the SDP information to be sent in a SIP message by the
NF that has the CC-TF. The RemoteSDP provides the SDP information received in
a SIP message at the NF that has the CC-TF. In some cases, both LocalSDP and
RemoteSDP may be included in the ActivateTask message. The CC-POI is expected
to use the LocalSDP to populate the SDP Session Description field of the X3
PDUs for the incoming media streams and to use the the RemoteSDP to populate
the SDP Session Description field of the X3 PDUs for the outgoing media
streams.
###### 7.12.5.2.2.2 Activation of CC-POI in IMS-AGW, TrGW, IM-MGW
The CC-TF shall send a trigger to the CC-POI using the ActivateTask message
over the LI_T3 interface for an intercepted IMS session (as determined
according to the clause 7.12.2.8) that requires the CC interception when the
following occur:
\- The NF that has the CC-TF receives the acknowledgement (i.e. H.248 Reply)
to the H.248: Add Context from the NF that has the CC-POI. The H.248: Add
Context is sent when the SIP message that contains the SDP offer is handled.
\- The CC-TF receives an ActivateTask from the LIPF over LI_X1 with CC
interception required for an IMS session with an already established SDP offer
and possibly SDP answer as well. This process is part of a mid-session
activation of interception.
When the media streams are asymmetric, the CC-TF shall send a second trigger
to the CC-POI using the ActivateTask message over the LI_T3 interface to
intercept the media in the reverse direction when the following occur:
\- When the SDP offer is received from the side where the media interception
is done, the NF that has the CC-TF receives the acknowledgement (i.e. H.248
Reply) to the H.248: Add Context from the NF that has the CC-POI. The H.248:
Add Context is sent when the SIP message that contains the SDP offer is
handled. This happens at the same time the first trigger (LI_T3 ActivateTask)
is sent.
\- When the SDP answer is received from the side where the media interception
is done, the NF that has the CC-TF receives the acknowledgement (i.e. H.248
Reply) to the H.248 Mod Context from the NF that has the CC-POI. The H.248:
Mod Context is sent when the SIP message that contains the SDP answer is
handled.
\- The CC-TF receives an ActivateTask from the LIPF over LI_X1 with CC
interception required for an IMS session with an already established SDP offer
and possibly SDP answer as well. This process is part of a mid-session
activation of interception.
The details of ActivateTask sent from the CC-TF to the CC-POI over LI_T3 are
shown in table 7.12.5.2.2-1.
For the trigger (for the asymmetric media case, it is the first trigger):
\- The CC-TF shall use the IP address and UDP port number present in the local
descriptor part of the acknowledgement (i.e. H.248 Reply) to an H.248 Add
context message. The same IP address and the UDP port numbers are also present
in the SIP messages that carry the SDP offer or SDP answer (depending on the
SIP message direction and the session scenario).
> NOTE 1: The SDP offer may be present in a forward SIP message (e.g. SIP
> INVITE) or in a response SIP message (e.g. SIP 200 OK). In the latter case,
> the trigger to perform media interception is sent when the response SIP
> message is handled.
>
> When the CC-TF and IRI-POI are present in different NFs, the IP address and
> the UDP port number are associated with the core network side of the NF that
> has the CC-POI.
>
> When the CC-TF and the IRI-POI are in the same NF, as a deployment option,
> the CC-TF may choose the side for media interception and hence, includes the
> IP address and the UDP port number that correspond to the side at which the
> media interception is to be done. The sides thus chosen based on the IP
> address and UDP port number can be the access side or core network side when
> the CC-POI is in IMS-AGW, the side can be peer network side or core network
> side when the CC-POI is in TrGW, and the side is always the core network
> side when the CC-POI is in the IM-MGW (see figure 7.12.5.2-1). The CC-POI is
> expected to perform the media interception on the side as determined by that
> IP address and the UDP port number.
For the second trigger that applies to asymmetric media case:
\- The CC-TF shall use the IP address and UDP port number present in the
remote descriptor part of the of the H.248 transaction that happens between
the NF that has the CC-TF and the NF that has the CC-POI. The same IP address
and the UDP port numbers are also present in the SIP messages that carry the
SDP offer or SDP answer (depending on the SIP message direction and the
session scenario).
> The remote IP address and the UDP port number are on the same side where the
> local IP address and UDP port number were provided in the first trigger.
The values that the CC-TF sets for the PayloadDirectionAssignment and
TriggerScope shall be determined as described in tables 7.12.5.2.2-4 and
7.12.5.2.2-5.
Table 7.12.5.2.2-4: PayloadDirectionAssignment and TriggerScope values (target
identifier from local descriptor)

NOTE 2: The media interception of target non-local ID is done in the IMS-AGW
only when the IMS user is in communication with the target non-local ID is an
inbound roamer with LBO with the alternate deployment option (see TS 33.127
[5]).
NOTE 3: When media is neither sent to nor received from the target (e.g. call
waiting scenario, held session), and when the CC-TF is aware of the scenario,
the value of \"NotDetermined\" is used as the PayloadDirectionAssignment
value. The CC-TF changes the PayloadDirectionAssignment value using a LI_T3
ModifyTask (see clause 7.12.5.2.3) when the media is cross connected to the
target (e.g. held session is retrieved).
The table 7.12.5.2.2-6 shows how the CC-POI is expected to set the Payload
Direction field in the xCC based on the PayloadDirectionAssignment and
TriggerScope values received in the LI_T3 ActivateTask message.
Table 7.12.5.2.2-6: Expected payload direction value in the xCC

from the target n/a ToTarget \"2\" to the target n/a NotDetermined \"5\" not
applicable to this xCC n/a
NOTE 4: When the TriggerScope value is \"Unidirectional\", two LI_T3 triggers
are sent to the CC-POI and in this case, the CC-POI is expected to set the
Payload Direction field separately according to the PayloadDirectionAssignment
received in the corresponding LI_T3 trigger.
The following paragraphs describe the algorithm the CC-TF shall use for the
inclusion of the LocalSDP and Remote SDP in the LI T3 ActivateTask message.
\- When the TriggerScope value is \"Bidirectional\":
\- When the SDP offer is received at the NF that has the CC-TF (on the side
where the media interception is done) before the sending of a ActivateTask to
the CC-POI, the CC-TF shall use the SDP information received in the SDP offer
as RemoteSDP and the SDP information that will be sent later in the SDP answer
of a SIP message as LocalSDP.
\- When the SDP offer is sent by the NF that has the CC-TF (on the side where
the media interception is done) after the sending of a ActivateTask to the CC-
POI, the CC-TF shall use the SDP information that will be included in the SDP
offer of a SIP message as LocalSDP. In this case, the RemoteSDP is sent in the
LI_T3 ModifyTask when the SDP answer is received in a SIP message (see clause
7.12.5.2.3).
\- When the TriggerScope value is \"Unidirectional\":
\- When the SDP offer is received at the NF that has the CC-TF (on the side
where the media interception is done) before the sending of a ActivateTask to
the CC-POI, the CC-TF shall use the SDP information that will be sent later in
the SDP answer of a SIP message as the LocalSDP in the first LI_T3 trigger.
The SDP information received in the SDP offer as the RemoteSDP in the second
LI_T3 trigger.
\- When the SDP offer is sent by the NF that has the CC-TF (on the side where
the media interception is done) after the sending of a ActivateTask to the CC-
POI, the CC-TF shall use the SDP information that will be included in the SDP
offer of a SIP message as LocalSDP in the first trigger.
\- When the SDP answer is received at the NF that has the CC-TF (on the side
where the media interception is done), the CC-TF shall use the SDP information
received in the SDP answer of SIP message as RemoteSDP of the second LI_T3
trigger.
For the mid-session interception case, the CC-TF shall include both the
LocalSDP and RemoteSDP in the trigger (LI_T3 ActivateTask) when the
TriggerScope is \"Bidirectional\".
For mid-session interception case when the TriggerScopeValue is
\"Unidirectional\", the CC-TF shall include the LocalSDP in the first trigger
(LI_T3 ActivateTask) and the RemoteSDP in the second trigger (LI_T3
ActivateTask).
The CC-POI is expected to populate the SDP Session Description field of X3 PDU
with the SDP information received in the LocalSDP, for the xCC that represent
the incoming media streams destined to the IP address and UDP port number
specified as the target identifiers.
The CC-POI is expected to populate the SDP Session Description field of X3 PDU
with the SDP information received in the RemoteSDP, for the xCC that represent
the outgoing media streams. In the case where TriggerScope value is
\"Bidirectional\", the outgoing media streams will be from the IP address and
UDP port number specified as the target identifiers. In the case where
TriggerScope value is \"Unidirectional\", the outgoing media streams will be
destined to the IP address and UDP port number specified as the target
identifiers.
###### 7.12.5.2.2.3 CC-POI in MRFP
The CC-TF present in the AS/MRFC shall send a trigger to the CC-POI present in
the MRFP using the ActivateTask message over the LI_T3 interface for an
intercepted IMS session (as determined according to the clause 7.12.2.8) that
requires the CC interception when the following occurs:
\- The AS/MRFC that has the CC-TF receives the acknowledgement (i.e. H.248
Reply) to the H248: Add Context from the MRFP.
When the media streams are asymmetric, the CC-TF present in the AS/MRFC shall
send a second trigger to the CC-POI present in the MRFP using the ActivateTask
message over the LI_T3 interface to intercept the media in the reverse
direction when the following occur:
\- When the SDP offer is received, the AS/MRFC receives the acknowledgement
(i.e. H.248 Reply) to the H.248: Add Context from the MRFP. The H.248: Add
Context is sent when the SIP message that contains the SDP offer is handled.
This happens at the same time the first trigger (LI_T3 ActivateTask) is sent.
\- When the SDP answer is received, the AS/MRFC receives the acknowledgement
(i.e. H.248 Reply) to the H.248 Mod Context from the MRFP. The H.248: Mod
Context is sent when the SIP message that contains the SDP answer is handled.
For a conferencing scenario, the AS/MRFC is expected to send the H.248: Add
Context to the MRFP when it handles a SIP message that includes a Conference
Factory URI in the Request URI field. Only one LI_T3 ActivateTask is required
to intercept the media for a conference.
Additionally, in support of the mid-session interception, the CC-TF present in
the AS/MRFC shall send a trigger to the CC-POI present in the MRFP using the
ActivateTask message over the LI_T3 interface when the following occur:
\- The CC-TF present in the AS/MRFC receives an ActivateTask from the LIPF
over LI_X1 with CC interception required, when an incoming IMS session to the
target identifier included in the LI_X1 ActivateTask was redirected to voice
mail server with an already established SDP offer and possibly SDP answer as
well.
\- The CC-TF present in the AS/MRFC receives an ActivateTask from the LIPF
over LI_X1 with CC interception required, when announcement or tones are being
applied to the caller of an incoming IMS session to the target identifier
included in the LI_X1 ActivateTask message.
\- The CC-TF present in the AS/MRFC receives an ActivateTask from the LIPF
over LI_X1 with CC interception required, when the user represented through
the target identifier included in the LI_X1 Activate Task is one of the
participants in an established conference session.
\- The CC-TF present in the AS/MRFC receives an ActivateTask from the LIPF
over LI_X1 with CC interception required, when the Conference URI associated
with an established conference session is included as a target identifier in
the LI_X1 Activate Task message.
When the media streams are asymmetric, the CC-TF present in the AS/MRFC shall
send a second trigger to the CC-POI present in the MRFP using the ActivateTask
message over the LI_T3 interface to intercept the media in the reverse
direction to any of the events except the last two in the above list occurs.
The details of LI_T3 ActivateTask are shown in table 7.12.5.2.2-1.
For the trigger (for the asymmetric media case, it is the first trigger):
\- The CC-TF shall use the IP address and UDP port number present in the local
descriptor part of the acknowledgement (i.e. H.248 Reply) to an H.248 Add
context message. The same IP address and the UDP port numbers are also present
in the SIP messages that carry the SDP offer or SDP answer (depending on
whether the AS/MRFC receives or sends the SDP offer).
For the second trigger that applies to asymmetric media case:
\- The CC-TF shall use the IP address and UDP port number present in the
remote descriptor part of the of the H.248 transacation that happens between
AS/MRFC and the MRFP.The same IP address and the UDP port numbers are also
present in the SIP messages that carry the SDP offer or SDP answer (depending
on whether the AS/MRFC receives or sends the SDP offer).
The values that the CC-TF sets for the PayloadDirectionAssignment and
TriggerScope shall be determined as described in tables 7.12.5.2.2-7 and
7.12.5.2.2-8.
Table 7.12.5.2.2-7: PayloadDirectionAssignment and TriggerScope values (target
identifier from local descriptor)

Tables 7.12.5.2.2-5 and 7.12.5.2.2-6 (clause 7.12.5.2.2) shows how the CC-POI
is expected to set the Payload Direction field in the xCC based on the
PayloadDirectionAssignment and TriggerScope values received in the LI_T3
ActivateTask message.
For an intercepted conference session, the CC-POI shall perform the media
interception in a mixed mode including the media from all conference
participants. The concept of Payload Direction, therefore, does not apply to
the corresponding xCC.
The CC-TF present in the in the AS/MRFC shall follow the algorithm described
in clause 7.12.5.2.2.2 to populate the LocalSDP and RemoteSDP fields of LI_T3
ActivateTask.
###### 7.12.5.2.2.4 Activation of CC-POI when media interceptions are done at
both sides IMS media function
This is a special case where the media interception is done at both sides of
an IMS Media Function. In this case, the CC-POI would intercept the outgoing
media streams on both sides of IMS Media Function as shown in figure
7.12.5.2-2 below.
Figure 7.12.5.2.2-2: Media interception on both sides of the IMS Media
Function
The CC-POI would capture the media streams destined to the remote IP address
and UDP port number for the generation of xCC both sides. For this case, even
if the media streams are symmetric, the TriggerScope shall be set to
\"Unidirectional\". Accordingly, the CC-TF shall send the two triggers to CC-
POI using the ActivateTask message over the LI_T3 interface when the following
occur:
\- When the SDP offer is received from the side where the media interception
is done, the NF that has the CC-TF receives the acknowledgement (i.e. H.248
Reply) to the H.248: Add Context from the NF that has the CC-POI.
\- When the SDP answer is received from the side where the media interceptions
is done, the NF that has the CC-TF receives the acknowledgement (i.e. H.248
Reply) to the H.248: Mod Context from the NF that has the CC-POI.
\- The CC-TF receives an ActivateTask from the LIPF over LI_X1 with CC
interception required for an IMS session with an already established SDP offer
and possibly SDP answer as well. This process is part of a mid-session
activation of interception.
The details of ActivateTask sent from the CC-TF to the CC-POI over LI_T3 are
shown in table 7.12.5.2.2-1.
> The CC-TF shall use the IP address and UDP port number present in the remote
> descriptor part of the of the H.248 transaction that happens between the NF
> that has the CC-TF and the NF that has the CC-POI. The same IP address and
> the UDP port numbers are also present in the SIP messages that carry the SDP
> offer or SDP answer (depending on the SIP message direction and the session
> scenario).
The CC-TF shall set the PayloadDirectionAssignment value described in table
7.12.5.2.2-9:
Table 7.12.5.2.2-9: PayloadDirectionAssignment values
Target side First trigger Second trigger
* * *
On the side from which the SDP offer is received ToTarget FromTarget On the
side from which the SDP answer is received FromTarget ToTarget
NOTE: When the media is neither sent to nor received from the target (e.g.
call waiting scenario, held session), and when the CC-TF is aware of the
scenario, the value of \"NotDetermined\" is used as the
PayloadDirectionAssignment value. The CC-TF changes the
PayloadDirectionAssignment value using a LI_T3 ModifyTask (see clause
7.12.5.2.3) when the media is cross connected to the target (e.g. held session
is retrieved).
For this case, the CC-TF shall include the SDP information in the RemoteSDP of
TaskDetailsExtensions of LI_T3 ActivateTask for both triggers as described
below:
\- When the SDP offer is received at the NF that has the CC-TF (on the side
where the media interception is done), the CC-TF shall use the SDP information
received in the SDP offer of SIP message as RemoteSDP of the first LI_T3
trigger.
\- When the SDP answer is received at the NF that has the CC-TF (on the side
where the media interception is done), the CC-TF shall use the SDP information
received in the SDP answer of SIP message as RemoteSDP of the second LI_T3
trigger.
The CC-POI is expected to populate the SDP Session Description field of X3 PDU
with the SDP information received in the RemoteSDP, for the xCC that represent
the outgoing media streams on both sides. The outgoing media streams will be
destined to the IP address and UDP port number specified as the target
identifiers.
##### 7.12.5.2.3 ModifyTask
The ModifyTask message (s) that a CC-TF may send to a CC-POI shall include the
XID of the Task (s) created by the ActivateTask message(s) (see table
7.12.5.2.2-1). The details of the ModifyTask are as shown in the table
7.12.5.2.2-10:
Table 7.12.5.2.2-10: ModifyTask message to update the previous trigger the CC-
POI over LI_T3
* * *
ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] field name Description M/C/O XID Shall be same as in the
ActivateTask message (see 7.12.5.2.1). M TargetIdentifiers Shall be same as in
the ActivateTask message (see 7.12.5.2.1). M DeliveryType Set to \"X3Only\". M
ListOfDIDs Shall give the DID of the MDF3 to which the xCC should be
delivered. The delivery endpoint is configured using the CreateDestination
message as described in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.3.1 prior to the task
activation. M CorrelationID Shall be same as in the ActivateTask message (see
7.12.5.2.1). M ProductID Shall be same as in the ActivateTask message (see
7.12.5.2.1). M TaskDetailsExtensions/SDP See table 7.12.5.2-2. M
* * *
The LI_T3 ModifyTask shall also use the same correlation ID, the same target
identifiers as used in the LI_T3 ActivateTask.
The examples of few scenarios that may necessitate the sending of a ModifyTask
over LI_T3 to the CC-POI are the following:
\- When the TriggerScope value used in the LI_T3 ActivateTask is
\"Bidirectional\", the SDP answer is received in a SIP message on the side
where the media interception is done. The SDP information received in the SDP
answer of SIP message shall be included as RemoteSDP in the LI_T3 ModifyTask.
The LI_T3 ModifyTask shall also include the LocalSDP which was previously sent
to the CC-POI in the LI_T3 ActivateTask message.
NOTE: The same SDP information is sent to the CC-POI when the TriggerScope
value is \"Unidirectional\" as RemoteSDP in a second LI_T3 ActivateTask
trigger (see clause 7.12.5.2.2.2).
\- The SDP is changed through a new SDP offer and answer during the session
establishment phase.
\- The cases such as IP address or UDP port numbers are being changed on an
established IMS session (using H.248 Modify Context (which may also include a
Add Request to an existing context)).
\- When a session is placed on hold, if the media interception sides have to
be switched (e.g. from access side of IMS-AGW to core network side of IMS-
AGW).
\- When a session is placed on hold or retrieved from hold, if the
PayloadDirectionAssignment value for the Target Identifier (associated with a
previously sent LI_T3 Activate Task or LI_T3 Modify Task) are to be changed.
\- When the media interception has to begin only when the media is cross-
connected within the NF that has the CC-POI (e.g. call waiting).
Usually, the LI_T3 ModifyTask is sent when the NF that has the CC-TF sends a
H.248: Modify Context (or a H.248 Add Request to an existing context) message
to the NF that has the CC-POI, if certain aspects of media interception
require to be changed.
As an alternate implementation, the CC-TF could use a LI_T3 DeactivateTask
(clause 7.12.5.2.4) and LI_T3 ActivateTask (clause 7.12.5.2.1) to handle the
held/retrieval scenario. Similarly, as an alternate implementation, the CC-TF
could delay the LI_T3 ActivateTask till the media is cut-through within the NF
that has the CC-POI in the call waiting scenario.
If two LI_T3 ActivateTask messages were used (asymmetric media stream case),
then two LI-T3 ModifyTask messages may be required (depending on the
scenario).
##### 7.12.5.2.4 DeactivateTask
The DeactivateTask message(s) that the CC-TF sends to the CC-POI shall include
the XID of the Task created by the associated ActivateTask message (see table
7.12.5.2.2-1).
The examples of few scenarios that may necessitate the sending of a
DeactivateTask over LI_T3 to the CC-POI are the following:
\- Media interception of an IMS session ends.
Usually, the LI_T3 DeactivateTask is sent when the NF that has the CC-TF sends
a H.248: Subtract Context to the NF that has the CC-POI which in turn normally
happens when the SIP BYE is handled. Also, as an alternate implementation, the
CC-TF could send a LI_T3 DeactivateTask when a session is placed on hold.
If two LI_T3 ActivateTask messages were used (asymmetric media stream case),
then two LI-T3 DeactivateTask messages are required.
### 7.12.6 Generation of xCC over LI_X3
#### 7.12.6.1 General
The CC-POI shall generate the xCC for the IMS media based on the LI_T3 trigger
received from the CC-TF. The CC-POI shall then deliver the xCC to the MDF3
(destination end point indicated in the LI_T3 trigger).
As described in clause 7.12.5.1, the CC-POI may reside in the IMS-AGW, TrGW,
IM-MGW, the MRFP or the LMISF.
#### 7.12.6.2 Media capture
The CC-POI shall use the H248ContextID received in the LI_T3 ActivateTask
trigger to match the Context ID seen in the H.248 transactions with the NF
that has the CC-TF.
In addition, the CC-POI shall use the IP address and UDP port number received
as the target identifiers in the LI_T3 trigger along with the TriggerScope
also received in the LI_T3 trigger to identify the media packets to be
intercepted for the generation of xCC using the following algorithm:
\- When the TriggerScope value received in the LI_T3 trigger is
\"Unidirectional\", the IP address and UDP port number received in the LI_T3
ActivateTask as target identifiers shall match the destination IP address and
UDP port number of the media packets.
\- When the TriggerScope value received in the LI_T3 trigger is
\"Bidirectional\", the IP address and UDP port number received in the LI_T3
ActivateTask as target identifiers shall match the destination IP address and
UDP port number of the incoming media packets and shall match the source IP
address and UDP port number of outgoing media packets in the reverse
direction.
The CC-POI shall expect to receive two LI_T3 ActivateTask triggers when the
value of TriggerScope is \"Unidirectional\". The two triggers provide the
information necessary to identify the media in two directions of the media
flow. The H248ContextID in the two triggers are the same. The CorrelationID in
the two triggers are the same.
The media packets destined to the local IP address and UDP port number are
referred to as incoming media packets. The media packets destined to the
remote IP address and UDP port number are referred to as outgoing media
packets.
#### 7.12.6.3 Payload format
The CC-POI shall set the payload format to indicate the appropriate payload
type (5 for IPv4 packet, 6 for IPv6 packet) as described in ETSI TS 103 221-2
[8] (clauses 5.4 and 5.4.13).
#### 7.12.6.4 Payload direction
The CC-POI shall set the payload direction to indicate the direction of the
media packets included in the xCC delivered to the MDF3 as described in ETSI
TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.2.6 and the following paragraph.
The PayloadDirectionAssignment field received in the LI_T3 ActivateTask
message instructs the CC-POI how to populate the Payload Direction for each
xCC PDU that it generates. If an intercepted media stream (i.e. IP packet) is
destined for the IP address and port given in the LI_T3 ActivateTask message,
the CC-POI shall set the Payload Direction of the xCC packet to the value that
has the same meaning as the value given in the PayloadDirectionAssignment
field. For an intercepted IP packet travelling in the other direction, the CC
POI should use the opposite direction value. Specific instructions on how to
set the xCC Payload Direction field for given combinations of IP packet
direction and TriggerScope value are given in table 7.12.6.4-1 below.
7.12.6.4-1: Payload direction value in the xCC
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | TriggerScope | PayloadDirec | RTP stream | | | | tionAssignment | (media stream) | | | (LI_T3 | | direction | | | trigger) | (LI_T3 | | | | | trigger) | | | +================+================+================+================+ | | | Media to the | Media from the | | | | LI_T3 target | LI_T3 target | | | | identifier | identifier | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Bidirectional | FromTarget | \"3\" from the | \"2\" to the | | | | target | target | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | | ToTarget | \"2\" to the | \"3\" from the | | | | target | target | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | | NotDetermined | \"5\" not | \"5\" not | | | | applicable to | applicable to | | | | this xCC | this xCC | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Unidirectional | FromTarget | \"3\" from the | n/a | | | | target | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | | ToTarget | \"2\" to the | n/a | | | | target | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | | NotDetermined | \"5\" not | n/a | | | | applicable to | | | | | this xCC | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
NOTE: When the TriggerScope value is \"Unidirectional\", two LI_T3 triggers
are received from the CC-TF and in this case, the CC-POI sets the Payload
Direction field separately according to the PayloadDirectionAssignment
received in the corresponding LI_T3 trigger.
In some session scenarios, the media packets destined to the IP address and
UDP port number specified as target identifiers in the LI_T3 Activate Task may
not be delivered to the intercept target (e.g. call waiting scenario, hold
scenario). When the CC-TF is aware of this, it would have used the value
\"NotDetermined\" as the PayloadDirectionAssignment field.
When the xCC is delivered in a combined form (e.g. conference), independent of
the PayloadDirectionAssignment value received in the LI_T3 Activate Task, the
CC-POI shall use the Payload Direction value 4: _sent to and received from the
target._
#### 7.12.6.5 SDP session description
The CC-POI shall generate the SDP Session Description field (as specified in
ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8] clause 5.3.23) of xCC from the the LocalSDP and
RemoteSDP received in the LI_T3 trigger from the CC-TF as described below.
When the TriggerScope value is \"Bidirectional\", the CC-POI may receive the
Local SDP and RemoteSDP in one LI_T3 trigger or in two separate LI_T3
triggers. When the TriggerScope value is \"Unidirectional\", the Local SDP and
RemoteSDP are received in two separate triggers.
NOTE 1: When the TriggerScope value in the LI_T3 trigger is
\"Unidirectional\", the CC-TF includes LocalSDP in the LI_T3 trigger that has
the local IP address and UDP port number as target identifiers and RemoteSDP
in the LI_T3 trigger that has the remote IP address and the UDP port number as
the target identifiers.
NOTE 2: When the media interception is done at two sides of the IMS Media
Function, the CC-POI receives RemoteSDP in both LI_T3 triggers with the
TriggerScope value set to \"Unidirectional\".
The CC-POI shall include the LocalSDP in the SDP Session Description field of
the xCC generated from the incoming media packets. The CC-POI shall include
the RemoteSDP in the Session Description field of xCC from the outgoing media
media packets. Clause 7.12.6.2 describes how the CC-POI identifies the
incoming and outgoing media packets.
NOTE 3: The LocalSDP provides the SDP information (e.g. codec information)
expected by the IMS Media Function that has the CC-POI. The media packets sent
by the remote end of the media flow are based on this SDP information.
Therefore, the LocalSDP is associated to the incoming media packets.
NOTE 4: The RemoteSDP address provides the SDP information (e.g. codec
information) expected by the remote end of the media flow. The media packets
sent to that remote end of the media flow are based on this SDP information.
Therefore, the RemoteSDP is associated to the outgoing media packets.
The SDP Session Description field shall be included in the xCC each time a new
LocalSDP or RemoteSDP is received in the LI_T3 trigger from the CC-TF.
#### 7.12.6.6 Additional XID related information
The CC-POI may use the Additional XID Related Information attribute to
facilitate efficient delivery of xCC, as specified in ETSI TS 103 221-2 [8]
clause 5.3.22.
### 7.12.7 Generation of IRI over LI_HI2
#### 7.12.7.1 General
When an xIRI is received over LI_X2 from the IRI-POI, the MDF2 shall send the
IRI message over LI_HI2 according to clause 5.5.2 of the present document
without undue delay.
The IRI message shall contain a copy of the relevant record received from
LI_X2. The record may be enriched by other information available at the MDF2
(e.g. additional location information).
The timeStamp field of the ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] PSHeader structure shall be
set to the time present in the timestamp field of the xIRI.
The threeGPP33128DefinedIRI field (see ETSI TS 102 232-7 [10] clause 15) shall
be populated with the BER-encoded IRIPayload.
IRI messages associated with the same IMS session shall have the same CIN (see
ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] clause 5.2.4).
The IRI type parameter (see ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] clause 5.2.10) shall be
included and coded according to table 7.12.7.1-1.
Table 7.12.7.1-1: IRI type for IRI messages
Record type **IRI Type**
* * *
IMSMessage REPORT StartOfInterceptionForActiveIMSSession REPORT
IMSCCUnavailable REPORT
#### 7.12.7.2 Handling of multiple instances of list of mediation details
The MDF2 may have to deliver IRI messages to more than one LEMFs when more
than one instances of ListOfMediationDetails are associated with a task (i.e.
XID) provisioned at the MDF2.
The MDF2 shall populate the LIID field in the IRI messages delivered over the
LI_HI2 accordingly.
#### 7.12.7.3 Mid-session activation for additional warrants at MDF2
When a new warrant is to be activated on a target identity (i.e. the
associated IMS user is already the target of interception due to another
warrant), the LIPF may use the same XID for the new warrant (e.g. when there
is no need to receive two separate copies of xIRI messages over LI_X2). In
this case, the LIPF may activate the new warrant only at the MDFs using an
LI_X1 ModifyTask message with a new instance of ListOfMediationDetails.
The MDF2 that receives a LI_X1 ModifyTask with a new instance of
ListOfMediationDetails shall be able to generate and deliver the IRI message
containing the StartOfInterceptionForActiveIMSSession record to the LEMF as
represented in the new instance of ListOfMediationDetails without receiving a
corresponding xIRI from the IRI-POI. The MDF2 shall generate and deliver such
an IRI message for each of the established IMS session legs to the LEMF
represented within the ListOfMediationDetails.
The timeStamp field of the ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9] PSHeader structure shall be
set to the present time known to the MDF2.
The payload of the StartOfInterceptionForActiveIMSSession record is specified
in table 7.12.4.2-3 (see also clause 7.12.7.1).
#### 7.12.7.4 Location reporting
The MDF2 shall include the location information in the IRI messages sent over
the LI_HI2 according to the service scoping received within the
ListOfMediationDetails of the LI_X1 ActivateTask. For example, if service
scoping does not allow the reporting of location to an LEMF, then the MDF2
shall not copy the location information if received in an xIRI to the IRI
message sent to that LEMF.
The MDF2 shall also remove the location information (e.g. PANI header) from
the SIP message contents included as a part of the IRI message, when the
service scoping does not allow the reporting of location to the LEMF.
### 7.12.8 Generation of CC over LI_HI3
#### 7.12.8.1 General
When xCC is received over LI_X3 from a CC-POI, the MDF3 shall deliver the CC
over LI_HI3 to the LEMF according to the clause 5.5.3 of the present document
without undue delay.
The MDF3 shall populate the threeGPP33128DefinedCC field with a CCPayload
structure containing IMSCCPDU. The IMSCCPDUPayload shall contain the IPv4 or
IPv6 packet received over LI_X3.
The MDF3 shall populate the timeStamp field of the ETSI TS 102 232-1 [9]
PSHeader structure of CC with the xCC timeStamp and the Payload Direction of
the CCPayload structure to reflect the value received on xCC. The LIID and CID
fields shall correctly reflect the target identity and communication session
to which the CC belongs.
#### 7.12.8.2 Handling of multiple instances of list of mediation details
The MDF3 may have to deliver the received xCC to more than one LEMFs when more
than one instances of ListOfMediationDetails are associated with a task (i.e.
XID) provisioned at the MDF3. The MDF3 shall populate the LIID field in the CC
delivered over the LI_HI3 accordingly.
#### 7.12.8.3 Handling of additional XID related information
In addition to the XID present in the XID field of xCC, the MDF3 shall deliver
a copy of the CC to the LEMFs represented in one or more instances of
ListOfMediationDetails associated with the XID values present in the
Additional XID Related Information received in the xCC.
#### 7.12.8.4 SDP session description
The MDF3 shall deliver the SDP session description received in the xCC over
LI_X3 using the SDPInfo element of the IMSCCPDU to the LEMF over LI_HI3. This
shall be done each time the SDP Session Description is present on the xCC.
#### 7.12.8.5 Mid-session activation for additional warrants at MDF3
When a new warrant is to be activated on a target identity (i.e. the
associated IMS user is already the target of interception due to another
warrant), the LIPF may use the same XID for the new warrant (e.g. when there
is no need to receive two separate copies of xCC over LI_X3). In this case,
the LIPF may activate the new warrant only at the MDFs using an LI_X1
ModifyTask message with a new instance of ListOfMediationDetails.
The MDF3 that receives a LI_X1 ModifyTask with a new instance of
ListOfMediationDetails, shall deliver the CC to the LEMF represented in this
new instance of ListOfMediationDetails upon the reception of next xCC from the
CC-POI.
7.12.8.6 Media handling at the MDF and LEMF
The MDF and LEMF perform protocol level correlation between intercepted
signalling and media. LI_T3 ensures that the SDP in the intercepted SIP
signalling or in LI_X3 matches the IP/UDP destination IP-address and port for
every intercepted RTP stream.
In a scenario where NAT is used, the protocol level correlation may not be
possible. In all other scenarios the implementation shall ensure that it is.
To support the interception scenario where transmission of CC occurs before
the IRI, the LEMF may use SDP Session Description field in the CC to process
the media.
### 7.12.9 Removal of unauthorised information from IMS record payloads
#### 7.12.9.1 General
If the Content-Type of the SIP message is \"multipart\" as defined in RFC 2046
[120] clause 2.4, each part of the SIP message shall be modified as required.
#### 7.12.9.2 Removal of location information
##### 7.12.9.2.1 General
Depending on the SIP message being reported and the implementation, location
information may be present in the SIP Headers, the body of the SIP message, or
both. When location is not authorised, all location information shall be
removed from the encapsulated SIP message prior to its delivery over LI_HI2.
As such, when location is not authorised, the MDF2 and, optionally, the IRI-
POIs in the IMS shall be provisioned with the payload modifications detailed
in the subclauses below.
Additionally, if the location present in the SIP message is the location of
the non-target party, the location shall be removed.
If an implementation has location information in other portions of the
payload, the appropriate modifications shall be made to the encapsulated
payload in addition to those specified below prior to the delivery of the
message over LI_HI2.
##### 7.12.9.2.2 P-Access-Network-Info location removal
Each character of each access-info parameter field of the P-Access-Network-
Info header shall be over-written with zeros (see TS 24.229 [74] clause
7.2A.4). If multiple P-Access-Network-Info headers are present in the message,
each shall be modified.
##### 7.12.9.2.3 Cellular-Network-Info location removal
Each character of the access-info portion of the Cellular-Network-Info header
shall be over-written with zeros. If multiple Cellular-Network-Info headers
are present in the message, each shall be modified.
##### 7.12.9.2.4 Geolocation header location removal
If there is a Geolocation header present in the message and the location
object is included in the message, the portion of the body of the SIP message
that contains the location object shall be modified as described in clause
7.12.9.2.5.
##### 7.12.9.2.5 Removal of location information from presence information
If the Content-Type of any body part of the SIP message is
\"application/pidf+xml\", and if the presence information contains a geopriv
element, the character data of each element within each location-info element
shall be overwritten with the zero character such that the length of the
element does not change.
#### 7.12.9.3 Removal of communications content
##### 7.12.9.3.1 General
In some cases portions of a SIP message body may contain communications
content. Unless otherwise specified, all communications content shall be
removed from the encapsulated SIP message prior to its delivery over LI_HI2.
As such, the MDF2 and, optionally, the IRI-POIs in the IMS shall be
provisioned with the payload modifications detailed in the subclauses below.
If an implementation has location information in other portions of the
payload, the appropriate modifications shall be made to the encapsulated
payload in addition to those specified below prior to the delivery of the
message over LI_HI2.
##### 7.12.9.3.2 Removal of SMS content
If the Content-Type of any body part of the SIP message is
\"application/vnd.3gpp.sms\", the TP-User-Data (TS 23.040 [18] clause 9.2.3.4)
of the SMS TPDU shall be modified as described in clause 7.4.5.2.
##### 7.12.9.3.3 Removal of text content
If the Content-Type of the SIP message is \"text\" or any of the subtypes of
\"text\", the contents of the body shall be overwritten with spaces such that
the length of the body remains unchanged.
##### 7.12.9.3.4 Removal of content from the Subject header field
If the delivery of the Subject header of a SIP message is unauthorised, each
character of the field-value of the Subject header shall be replaced with a
space.

### 7.13.2 Triggering of the IRI-POI and CC-POI in the HTTP Content Server
#### 7.13.2.1 Triggering of the IRI-POI in the HTTP Content Server over LI_T2
##### 7.13.2.1.1 LI_T2 interface Specifics
In order to allow the IRI-POI in the HTTP content server to detect all events
related to files uploaded or downloaded by a target, the IRI-TF in the RCS
Server sends a trigger to the IRI-POI present in the HTTP Content Server with
the necessary information over the LI_T2 interface.
When the IRI-TF in the RCS Server detects that a file is being uploaded or
downloaded by a target UE it shall send an activation message to the IRI-POI
in the HTTP Content Server over the LI_T2 interface. The activation message
shall contain the correlation identifiers that the IRI-POI in the HTTP Content
Server shall use with the xIRI. This can be achieved by sending an
ActivateTask message as defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.1 with the
following details.
Table 7.13.2.1-1: ActivateTask message from the IRI-TF in the RCS Server for

#### 7.13.2.2 Triggering of the CC-POI in the HTTP Content Server over LI_T3
##### 7.13.2.2.1 LI_T3 interface Specifics
To support the use-cases where the IRI-POI in the HTTP Content Server does not
get the identity of the user involved in the file-transfer (and therefore, the
CC-POI in the HTTP Content Server cannot perform the intereption based on the
target identity provisioned by the LIPF), the CC-TF present in the RCS Server
sends a trigger to the CC-POI present in the HTTP Content Server. When the CC-
TF in the RCS Server detects that a file is being uploaded or downloaded by a
target UE, it shall send an activation message to the CC-POI in the HTTP
Content Server over the LI_T3 interface. The activation message shall contain
the correlation identifiers that the CC-POI in the HTTP Content Server shall
use with the xCC. This can be achieved by sending an ActivateTask message as
defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.2.1 with the following details.
Table 7.13.2.2-1: ActivateTask message from the CC-TF in the RCS Server for
the CC-POI in the HTTP Content Server
* * *
ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] field name Description M/C/O XID XID assigned by LIPF.
If the CC-TF or IRI-TF is also being tasked for the same interception, the
same XID shall be used. The same XID shall be used at the RCS Servers, the
S-CSCF and the HTTP Content Server for the same interception. M
TargetIdentifiers File detection criteria as determined by the CC-TF in the
RCS Server, which enables the CC-POI in the HTTP Content Server to isolate
target files. The CC-POI in the HTTP Content Server shall support the
identifier types given in table 7.13.2.1-2. M DeliveryType Set to "X3Only". M
ListOfDIDs Delivery endpoints for LI_X3. These delivery endpoints shall be
configured by the CC-TF in the RCS Server using the CreateDestination message
as described in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7] clause 6.3.1 prior to first use. M
CorrelationID Correlation ID to assign to xCC generated by the CC-POI in the
HTTP Content Server. This field is populated with the same CorrelationID the
IRI-POI in the RCS Server uses for the associated xIRI. M ProductID Shall be
set to the XID of the Task Object associated with the interception at the CC-
TF. This value shall be used by the CC-POI in the HTTP Content Server to fill
the XID of X3 messages. M ListOfServiceTypes Shall be included when the task
should only intercept specific CSP service types as described in clause 5.2.4.
This parameter is defined in ETSI TS 103 221-1 [7], clause 6.2.1.2, table 4. C

The IRI-POI present in the RCS Servers shall send xIRI over LI_X2 for the
events listed in 3GPP TS 33.127 [5] clause 7.13.4, the details of which are
described in the following clauses.
If the RCS implementation uses protocols other than SIP and MSRP, alternative
triggers may be used such that the IRI-POI in the RCS Server generates
appropriate xIRIs for the events listed in 3GPP TS 33.127 [5] clause 7.13.4.

\- If the S-CSCF uses third-party registrations to notify the RCS Server when
a UE registers, when the S-CSCF receives a 200 OK from the RCS Server in
response to a third-party SIP REGISTER request registering, reregistering or
deregistering a target with the RCS Server.
\- If the S-CSCF is the NF responsible for handling RCS Registrations:
\- When the S-CSCF sends a 200 OK to a target in response to a SIP REGISTER
request that includes any of the service feature tags listed in GSMA RCC.07
[78] clause 2.4.3, clause 2.4.4 or clause 2.4.4.1 table 3.
\- When the S-CSCF sends a 200 OK to a target in response to a SIP REGISTER
request for deregistration when the service features supported by the target
include any of the service features listed in GSMA RCC.07 [78] clause 2.4.3,
clause 2.4.4 or clause 2.4.4.1 table 3.
\- When the IRI-POI is located in the RCS Server:
\- When the RCS Server sends a 200 OK to a target in response to a SIP
REGISTER request that includes any of the service feature tags listed in GSMA
RCC.07 [78] clause 2.4.3, clause 2.4.4 or clause 2.4.4.1 table 3.

#### 7.13.3.3 RCS Message
##### 7.13.3.3.1 RCS Message record
The IRI-POI present in the RCS Server shall generate an xIRI containing an
RCSMessage record when the IRI-POI present in the RCS Server detects that an
RCS target has sent or received an RCS message. In this specification, an RCS
message refers to any message sent or received in the context of pager mode
standalone messaging, large message mode messaging, 1-to-1 chat or group chat.
This xIRI is also generated when the target sends or receives a delivery
notification or display notification.
Accordingly, the IRI-POI in the RCS Server shall generate the RCSMessage xIRI
when it detects the following events:
\- The RCS Server receives a SIP MESSAGE from the target or destined to the
target, determined by the direction attribute present in the CPM Header, and:
\- The \"Contact\" or \"Accept-Contact\" header includes a service feature tag
among the feature tags listed in GSMA RCC.07 [78] clause 2.4.4.1 table 3.
\- The SIP \"Content-Type\" header is \"message/cpim\".
\- The RCS Server receives an MSRP packet from the target or destined to the
target and:
\- The content of the MSRP packet is a CPIM (Common Presence and Instant
Messaging) object (see definition in IETF RFC 3862 [80]).

# D.4 ASN.1 Syntax conventions
Table D.4-1: ASN.1 Syntax conventions
D.4.1 Modules are be defined with EXTENSIBILITY IMPLIED unless there is a
specific reason to limit extensibility.
* * *
D.4.2 The AUTOMATIC TAGS module directive is not used. D.4.3 SEQUENCE and
CHOICE tag numbers start at one. D.4.4 ENUMERATED tag numbers start at one.
D.4.5 Anonymous types are not used. Non-trivial fields are assigned their own
named type. D.4.6 Consideration should be given to making types re-usable and
independent of a particular release. Re-using or extending an existing type,
where the intent is similar, is preferable to creating a new type. D.4.7
Consideration should be given to making types extensible by declaring them as
a SEQUENCE or CHOICE where possible. D.4.8 Multiple smaller messages or
structures with fewer OPTIONAL fields are preferred to larger structures with
many OPTIONAL fields, as this increases the ability of the ASN.1 schema to
enforce the intent of the specification. D.4.9 Field names, tag numbers, field
types and optional flags are be space-aligned where possible. An indent of
four spaces is used. D.4.10 Field and type names (when defining a type) are
not in bold. D.4.11 Braces are given their own line. D.4.12 OIDs containing a
version number are updated when the structure that uses the OID is changed,
even if the change is solely to correct a syntactic error. Other OIDs in the
same module need not be updated if they are not associated with structures
that have been changed. D.4.13 For backward compatibility, fields added to
existing SEQUENCE or SET are defined as OPTIONAL, irrespective of their M/C/O
designation in the main body of the specification. D.4.14 When a field is
deprecated, the ASN.1 is not changed but the main text is changed (see D.2.5).
D.4.15 XIRIEvent and IRIEvent tag numbers should be identical for the same
field purpose. If the field is not present in one of XIRIEvent or IRIEvent, a
comment reserving the tag should be added instead (see D.2.3).

# M.2 Encapsulated information modification
## M.2.1 General
When encapsulated information needs to be modified, the following structures
may be used to report that payload in IRI messages.
In general, the predefined redactions listed in the
PredefinedPayloadModification table below should be used whenever possible. In
cases where none of the predefined modifications describe the required
redactions, the PayloadModificationDescription may be used.
When an encapsulated payload is modified to redact unauthorised information
each type of modification applied shall be reported in the
PayloadModifications parameter. If the same type of modification is performed
in multiple locations, this PayloadModification shall only be indicated once.
Additionally, the indication of a PayloadModification indicates that all
instances that match the conditions for that modification profile were
modified.
## M.2.2 Predefined modifications
The current document provides details for the following predefined methods for
redacting unauthorised information from encapsulated payloads:
\- SMS TP-User-Data content redaction as described in clause 7.12.9.3.2.
\- IMS location and content information redaction as described in clause
7.12.9.
## M.2.3 Use of described modifications
Each modification is described using a ModificationLocation (see clause
M.2.4.6) and a ModificationType (see clause M.2.4.7).
