# 4 AMF-specific security requirements and related test cases
## 4.1 Introduction
AMF specific security requirements include both requirements derived from AMF-
specific security functional requirements in relevant specifications as well
as security requirements introduced in the present document derived from the
threats specific to AMF as described in TR 33.926 [6].
## 4.2 AMF-specific adaptations of security functional requirements and
related test cases.
### 4.2.1 Introduction
The present clause describes the security functional requirements and the
corresponding test cases for AMF network product class. The proposed security
requirements are classified in two groups:
\- Security functional requirements derived from TS 33.501 [2] and detailed in
clause 4.2.2.
\- General security functional requirements which include requirements not
already addressed in TS 33.501 [2] but whose support is also important to
ensure that AMF conforms to a common security baseline detailed in clause
4.2.3.
### 4.2.2 Security functional requirements on the AMF deriving from 3GPP
specifications and related test cases
#### 4.2.2.0 General
The general approach in TS 33.117 [3] clause 4.2.2.1 and all the requirements
and test cases in TS 33.117 [3] clause 4.2.2.2 related to SBA/SBI aspect apply
to the AMF network product class.
#### 4.2.2.1 Authentication and key agreement procedure
##### 4.2.2.1.1 Synchronization failure handling
_Requirement Name_ : Synchronization failure handling
_Requirement Reference:_ TS 33.501 [2], clause 6.1.3.3.2
_Requirement Description_ : As specified in TS 33.501 [2] clause 6.1.3.3.2,
upon receiving an authentication failure message _with synchronisation
failure_ (AUTS) from the UE, the SEAF sends an
Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message with a _synchronisation
failure indication_ to the AUSF and the AUSF sends an
Nudm_UEAuthentication_Get Request message to the UDM/ARPF, together with the
following parameters:
_\- RAND_ sent to the UE in the preceding Authentication Request, and
_\- AUTS_ received by the SEAF in the response from the UE to that request, as
described in clause 6.1.3.2.0 and 6.1.3.3.1 of TS 33.501 [2].
An SEAF will not react to unsolicited \"synchronisation failure indication\"
messages from the UE.
The SEAF does not send new authentication requests to the UE before having
received the response to its Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request
message with a \"_synchronisation failure indication_ \" from the AUSF (or
before it is timed out)..
_Threat References_ : TR 33.926 [6], clause K.2.2.1, Resynchronization
_Test Case_ :
**Test Name:** TC_SYNC_FAIL_SEAF_AMF
**Purpose:**
Verify that synchronization failure is correctly handled by the SEAF/AMF.
**Pre-Conditions:**
\- Test environment with UE and AUSF. The UE and the AUSF may be simulated.
\- AMF network product is connected in emulated/real network environment.
**Execution Steps**
Test A:
1) The tester configures the UE to send an authentication failure message to
the SEAF/AMF with _synchronisation failure_ (AUTS) , after receiving the NAS
authentication request message as part of a registration procedure.
2) The SEAF/AMF sends a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message
with a \"_synchronisation failure indication_ \" to the AUSF.
3) The AUSF sends a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message to
the SEAF/AMF immediately after receiving the request from the SEAF/AMF, to
make sure the SEAF/AMF will receive the response before timeout.
NOTE: The timeout timer in Test A is the NAS timer T3520.
Test B:
1) The tester configures the UE to send an authentication failure message to
the SEAF/AMF with _synchronisation failure_ (AUTS) , after receiving the NAS
authentication request message as part of a registration procedure.
2) The SEAF/AMF sends a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message
with a \"_synchronisation failure indication_ \" to the AUSF.
3) The tester configures the AUSF in a way, that it does not send a
Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message to the SEAF/AMF before
timeout.
Test C:
1) The tester triggers a UE to perform a Registration Procedure.
2) While the UE is registered, the tester sends an unsolicited
\"synchronisation failure indication\" message to the SEAF/AMF.
**Expected Results:**
Test A and Test B: Before receiving Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate
Response message from the AUSF and before the timer for receiving
Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message runs out,
\- For Test A, the SEAF/AMF may initiate new authentication towards the UE.
\- For Test B, the SEAF/AMF does not send any new authentication request to
the UE.
Test C: The SEAF/AMF does not process the unsolicited \"synchronisation
failure indication\" messages.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Evidence suitable for the interface, e.g., Screenshot, packet capture or
application logs containing the operational results.
##### 4.2.2.1.2 RES* verification failure handling
_Requirement Name_ : RES* verification failure handling
_Requirement Reference:_ TS 33.501 [2], clause 6.1.3.2.2
_Requirement Description_ :
As specified in TS 33.501 [2], clause 6.1.3.2.2, the SEAF proceeds with step
10 in Figure 6.1.3.2-1 of TS 33.501 [2] and after receiving the
Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message from the AUSF in step 12
in Figure 6.1.3.2-1, proceed as described below:
\- If the AUSF has indicated in the Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate
Response message to the SEAF that the verification of the RES* was not
successful in the AUSF, or
\- if the verification of the RES* was not successful in the SEAF,
then the SEAF either rejects the authentication by sending an Authentication
Reject to the UE if the SUCI was used by the UE in the initial NAS message or
the SEAF/AMF initiates an Identification procedure with the UE if the 5G-GUTI
was used by the UE in the initial NAS message to retrieve the SUCI and an
additional authentication attempt may be initiated.
Also, if the SEAF does not receive any Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate
Response message from the AUSF as expected, then the SEAF either rejects the
authentication to the UE or initiate an Identification procedure with the UE.
_Threat References_ : TR 33.926 [6], clause K.2.2.3, RES* verification failure
_Test Case_ :
**Test Name:** TC_RES_STAR_VERIFICATION_FAILURE
**Purpose:**
1) Verify that the SEAF/AMF correctly handles RES* verification failure
detected in the SEAF/AMF or/and in the AUSF, when the SUCI is included in the
initial NAS message.
2) Verify that the SEAF/AMF correctly handles RES* verification failure
detected in the SEAF/AMF or/and in the AUSF, when the 5G-GUTI is included in
the initial NAS message.
3) Verify that the SEAF/AMF correctly handles a missing
Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message from the AUSF.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
> **Pre-Conditions:**

>
> **Execution Steps**
>
> Test Case A:
1) The tester triggers the UE to send a Registration Request with SUCI to the
SEAF/AMF under test, to trigger the SEAF/AMF under test to initiate the
authentication, i.e. to send Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request to
the AUSF.
2) The AUSF, after receiving the request from the SEAF/AMF under test,
responds with a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message with an
authentication vector to the SEAF/AMF under test.
3) The UE, after receiving the Authentication Request message from the
SEAF/AMF under test, returns an incorrect RES* (prepared by the tester) to the
SEAF/AMF under test in the NAS Authentication Response message, which will
trigger the AMF to compute HRES*, compare HRES* with HXRES* and send an
authentication request to the AUSF. The tester captures the value of RES* in
the request.
4) The AUSF returns the indication of RES* verification failure to the AMF
under test.
> Test Case B:
1) The tester triggers the UE to send a Registration Request with a 5G-GUTI to
the SEAF/AMF under test, to trigger the SEAF/AMF under test to initiate the
authentication, i.e. to send Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request to
the AUSF.
2) The AUSF, after receiving the request from the SEAF/AMF under test,
responds with a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message with an
authentication vector to the SEAF/AMF under test.
3) The UE, after receiving the Authentication Request message from the
SEAF/AMF under test, returns an incorrect RES* (prepared by the tester) to the
SEAF/AMF in the NAS Authentication Response message, which will trigger the
AMF to compute HRES* and compare HRES* with HXRES*, and send an authentication
request to the AUSF. The tester captures the value of RES* in the request.
4) The AUSF returns an indication of RES* verification failure to the AMF
under test.
> Test Case C:
1) The tester triggers the UE to send a Registration Request with SUCI to the
SEAF/AMF under test, to trigger the SEAF/AMF under test to initiate the
authentication, i.e. to send Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request to
the AUSF.
2) The AUSF, after receiving the request from the SEAF/AMF under test,
responds with a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message with an
authentication vector to the SEAF/AMF under test.
3) The UE returns RES* to the SEAF/AMF under test in the NAS Authentication
Response message, which will trigger the AMF to compute HRES*, compare HRES*
with HXRES*, and send to the received RES* to the AUSF.
4) The tester prepares the AUSF or intercepts and modifies its
Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message to the SEAF/AMF to
indicate that the RES* verification was not successful in the AUSF.
> Test Case D:
1) The tester triggers the UE to send a Registration Request with 5G-GUTI to
the SEAF/AMF under test, to trigger the SEAF/AMF under test to initiate the
authentication, i.e. to send Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request to
the AUSF.
2) The AUSF, after receiving the request from the SEAF/AMF under test,
responds with a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message with an
authentication vector to the SEAF/AMF under test.

Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message to the SEAF/AMF to
indicate that the RES* verification was not successful in the AUSF.
> Test E:
1) The tester triggers the UE to send a Registration Request with SUCI to the
SEAF/AMF under test, to trigger the SEAF/AMF under test to initiate the
authentication, i.e. to send Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request to
the AUSF.
2) The AUSF, after receiving the request from the SEAF/AMF under test,
responds with a Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message with an
authentication vector to the SEAF/AMF under test.
3) The UE returns RES* to the SEAF/AMF under test in the NAS Authentication
Response message, which will trigger the AMF to compute HRES*, compare HRES*
with HXRES*, and send the received RES* to the AUSF.
4) The tester prepares the AUSF to not return the
Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message and therefore trigger a
timeout at the SEAF/AMF.
> Test F:
1) The tester triggers the UE to send a Registration Request with 5G-GUTI to
the SEAF/AMF under test, to trigger the SEAF/AMF under test to initiate the

Response message, which will trigger the AMF to compute HRES*, compare HRES*
with HXRES*, and send the received RES* to the AUSF.
4) The tester prepares the AUSF to not return the
Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Response message and therefore trigger a
timeout at the SEAF/AMF.

initiate an Identification procedure with the UE.
For test case A and B, a null value RES* is in the
Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request message sent from the SEAF/AMF to
the AUSF. (stated in TS 29.509 [10], clause 5.2.2.2.2).

5.31.3.
_Requirement Description_ : As specified in TS 33.501 [2], clause 6.16.4, when
a UE initiates registration procedure with the AMF, the AMF may redirect the
UE from 5GC to EPC by including a EMM cause indicating to the UE that it shall
not use 5GC, as described in clause 5.31.3 in TS 23.501 [2]. The following
requirements apply to Registration Reject message with an EMM cause which
indicates to the UE that the UE shall not use 5GC:
\- the AMF only sends such a Registration Reject message once NAS security has
been established between the AMF and the UE; and
\- the UE only acts upon such Registration Reject message if received
integrity protected and if UE has verified the integrity of the Registration
Reject message successfully.
NOTE 1: Void
In addition, in networks that support CIoT features in both EPC and 5GC, the
operator may steer UEs from a specific CN type due to operator policy, e.g.
due to roaming agreements, Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour, load
redistribution, etc. Operator policies in EPC and 5GC are assumed to avoid
steering UEs back and forth between EPC and 5GC.
