# Introduction {#introduction-1}
The 5G core network introduced a Service-Based Architecture (the so-called
SBA). _This brought fundamental impacts on the way new services are created
and how the individual Network Functions (NF) communicate. A more open and
adaptable system design necessitated to study different approaches to enforce
the security requirements of 3GPP systems, whilst not impeding flexible
service creation and future innovations. Along with these architectural
challenges, SBA further introduced changes to the protocol stack and
serialization format of the 5G core network._
_The SBA security was set on providing solutions for authentication and
authorization in direct communication scenarios as well as the N32 roaming
security. Later on enhancements were introduced for indirect communication
scenarios as well as the concept of Client Credential Assertion_ _to allow
NRF/NF Service Producer to directly authenticate a NF Service Consumer_ _._
_While the SBA provides a good level of security, several additional aspects
have been identified that may bring new potential threats. This will be
documented by the present document._
# 1 Scope
The present document studies enhanced security aspects of the 5G Service Based
Architecture. It will analyse potential threats, study necessary security
enhancements, and document decisions of solutions to be adopted or not adopted
after evaluating the risks versus the complexity.
In particular, the following topics are addressed:
\- Need and mechanism of enabling end to end authentication in roaming case if
no cross-certification between operators is enabled;
\- Need and mechanism of enabling NF Service Consumer authentication of NRF
and the NF Service Producer;
\- Need for addressing potential security impact of different deployment
scenarios including the several SCPs;
\- Verification of URI in subscription/notification;
\- Dynamic authorization between SCPs or NF and SCP;
\- End-to-End Critical HTTP headers/body parts integrity protection;
\- Access token usage in NF Sets;
\- Authorization mechanism determination;
\- Security of NRF service management;
\- Inter-Slice access authorization;
\- N32 roaming security considerations for deployment scenarios including
roaming hub and hosted SEPP.

# 4 Trust model
## 4.0 General
With introduction of the service-based architecture and moving at the same
time to cloud deployments, new attack vectors such as that for NFs deployed in
clouds give ground to vulnerabilities and, thus, can impact the mobile
operator domain. As more important it is to assure the trust also within one
operator\'s network. For this, security concepts have been introduced.
A service request requires mutual authentication, thus, all network functions
support mutually authenticated TLS and HTTPS. After registration and
discovery, any service request of a network function needs also to be
authorized by an authorization server (NRF) before a NF Service Consumer can
consume the services of a NF Service Producer. For this 5G introduces the
concept of authorization token utilizing the OAuth 2.0 authorization
framework. Indirect communication via a Service Communication Proxy (SCP) is
possible. SCPs can be operated in a fully service-meshed environment or as
standalone entity.
In the following the trust relationships between the entities of an operator
network to fulfil these security tasks are described.
## 4.1 Actors
The following actors within one PLMN are considered: NF, NRF, SCP.
\- NFs can provide services or consume services.
\- NRF is a repository capturing NF profiles of NFs offering services to other
NFs. NRF receives discovery requests from NF instances, maintains NF profiles
and acts as an OAuth 2.0 authorization server. NRF responds to authorization
requests by NF Service Consumers by providing OAuth 2.0 access tokens to
authorize a NF Service Consumer for gaining access to a service from a NF
Service Producer.
\- SCP is a service communication proxy used in indirect communication to
interact with NFs and other SCPs within the PLMN. SCP also communicates with
the SEPP.
The following types of actors when requesting services from another PLMN are
considered: SEPP.
\- SEPP sits at the edge of one operator\'s network to allow for a secured
communication with the other operator\'s network\'s SEPP.
## 4.2 Deployment options
The following deployment options need to be considered in intra-PLMN
communication:
\- Direct communication within the same PLMN vs direct communication in Inter-
PLMN scenario, i.e., without SCP behind SEPP.
\- Indirect communication in the same PLMN vs indirect communication in Inter-
PLMN scenario: For both, SCP standalone and service mesh need to be
considered.
The following deployment options need to be considered in inter-PLMN
communication:
SEPP to SEPP communication is secured on N32-c via TLS and on N32-f via TLS
(i.e., transport layer security) or PRINS (i.e., application layer security on
top of NDS/IP or TLS). TLS also provides for authentication between two
entities. Thus, securing at transport layer provides hop-by-hop security
between two SEPPs.
TLS encryption can be applied for N32-f where the operator only allows for IP
level routing by intermediaries. Otherwise, in deployments with intermediaries
tasked to provide additional services, hop-by-hop TLS security alone would
allow any intermediary to see and modify messages. More precisely,hop-by-hop
security introduces the additional risk of allowing an entity on the path to
gain full access to signalling messages exchanged. An intermediary node can
read, hide, or modify the originator information.
Since there exist also deployments where intermediaries need to see or modify
messages, PRINS was designed. The PRotocol for N32 Interconnect Security
(PRINS) provides end-to-end application layer security between two SEPPs and
hence an operator-controlled possibility for intermediaries to read and modify
messages.
## 4.3 Description of the trust assumptions
### 4.3.0 General
Trust among the entities within one PLMN is required whether the NF Service
Consumer (NFc) and NF Service Producer (NFp) are within the same PLMN or not.
The trust relationships described here can be replaced by security mechanisms.
### 4.3.1 Trust within one PLMN
This clause describes the existing trust relationships within one PLMN.
NOTE: Whether the list of existing trust relationships described below is
complete, depends on deployment choices.
NRF is the core entity handling management, discovery and authorization
requests by NFs or SCP. The operator needs to apply necessary security
measures to secure these operations. It is assumed that there is only one NRF,
or all NRFs are within the same trust domain, i.e., all NRFs are in the same
security domain and the same entity(-ies) are responsible for all NRFs.
**Registration Management:**
An NF Service Provider needs to trust the NRF that no other NF can register
its service profile with the identity of NFp.
If there is no direct communication between NF and NRF, an NF Service Provider
needs to trust that the SCPs forward NFp profiles unmodified.
If there is no direct communication between NF and NRF, an NF Service Provider
needs to trust the SCPs that no other NF can impersonate the identity of NFp
towards the SCP, i.e., tempting the SCP to register an NF with the false
identity.
**Discovery:**
An NF Service Consumer needs to trust NRF to provide profiles of authenticated
NF Service Providers that offer their services to the requesting consumer.
An NF Service Consumer needs to trust SCP to correctly forward the profiles of
authenticated NF Service Providers that offer their services to the requesting
consumer.
**Access token request:**
Trust in direct communication between NFs, NFs and SCP/SEPP, as well as SCP
and SEPP is assumed per TS 33.501 [2] with mandatory mutual authentication
using TLS.
An NF Service Provider needs to trust NRF to provide access tokens for
consumption of its services only to those NF Service Consumers that have
requested for it and only for those services that are allowed by the
registered NRF policy and the registered NF Service Provider policy.
Authentication and confidentiality protection in indirect communication is
only achieved between NF and SCP, (potentially between multiple SCPs), SCP and
NRF as well as SCP and SEPP, but additional considerations are needed for
achieving trust between NFs, NF and NRF, as well as NRF and SEPP, NF and SEPP,
when an SCP is on the path. This is because all traffic in indirect
communication passes through SCPs, and TLS terminates at SCPs.
Thus, the SCP needs to be trusted by NFc and NFp, to only forward
authentication tokens or CCA with the original request, as well as to forward
information only between the legitimate endpoints of the communication.
An NF Service Provider needs to trust NRF to provide access tokens for
consumption of its services only to those SCPs that are authorized by the NF
Service Consumers that have requested for it and only for those services that
are allowed by the registered NRF policy and the registered NF Service
Provider policy.
It also needs to be distinguished if SCP is co-located to NFs (service mesh)
or standalone.
If a SCP is co-located (e.g., a side-car proxy in service mesh) with a NF,
this SCP is performing many of the functionalities on behalf of the NF Service
Consumer, which already indicates a certain level of trust between NFs with
co-located SCPs.
If a SCP is standalone, this SCP is serving many NFs, not necessarily in the
same infrastructure or operated by the same operator than the NFs using the
SCP. It still needs to provide secure communication access for all NFs
communicating via this SCP.
For both standalone and service-mesh, the NFs sending their service requests
via an SCP need to trust the SCP which handles their service requests.
### 4.3.2 Trust in Inter-PLMN communication
With 5G, a new element has been introduced to handle inter-PLMN communication.
The SEPP, i.e., the Secure Edge Protection Proxy acting as perimeter of PLMN,
is responsible to secure the signalling message exchange with the SEPP of
another PLMN via the Internet.
The SEPP of the sending PLMN needs to trust the SEPP of the receiving PLMN
that no other entity (such as IPX, RVAS, or roaming hub) on the path has
unauthorized access or can modify signalling messages if not permitted to do
so by policy.
**Discovery:**
\- The NRF in the NF Service Consumer PLMN needs to trust the cSEPP to route
the request to the pSEPP representing the target PLMN and apply the correct
protection policies to the discovery request.
\- The NRF in the NF Service Provider PLMN needs to trust the pSEPP to
authenticate the origin network of the discovery request and ensure that this
origin network is correctly represented in the request arriving at the pNRF.
**Access token request:**
When requesting an access token from the NRF in another PLMN, there is always
an indirect communication involving the cSEPP and pSEPP. In addition, SCPs can
be involved in either network.
\- An NF Service Provider needs to trust pNRF to provide access tokens for
consumption of its services only to those NF Service Consumers in another PLMN
and only for those services that are allowed by the registered NRF policy and
the registered NF Service Provider policy.
\- An NF Service Provider needs to trust cNRF to provide access tokens for
consumption of its services only to those NF Service Consumers in another PLMN
that have requested for it and only for those services that are allowed by the
registered NRF policy and the registered NF Service Provider policy.
\- An NF Service Provider needs to trust SCP in the Service Consumer PLMN to
only forward authentication tokens or CCA with the original request, as well
as to forward information only between the legitimate endpoints of the
communication.
**Service request:**
\- An NF Service Provider needs to trust pSEPP to authenticate and verify the
NFc\'s PLMN included in the request in order to be able to perform dynamic
authorization.
\- A pSEPP needs to trust that the cSEPP is not forwarding requests on behalf
of foreign PLMNs.
# 5 Key issues
## 5.1 Key issue #1: Authentication of NRF and NF Service Producer by the NF
Service Consumer in indirect communication
### 5.1.1 Key issue details
When SCP is present, the TLS between an NF Service Consumer and NRF/NF Service
Producer can be split into at least two segments (NFc-SCP, SCP-NRF or SCP-
NFp). In this case, the NF Service Consumer (NFc) and NRF or NFc and NF
Service Producer (NFp) do not directly authenticate each other via TLS.
Client Credentials Assertion (CCA) has been specified to allow NRF or another
NF to directly authenticate an NF Service Consumer in the presence of an SCP,
but direct authentication of the NRF or NF Service Producer by the NF Service
Consumer has not been addressed in indirect communication. The key issue will
investigate solutions allowing the NF Service Consumer to directly
authenticate the NRF/NF Service Producer in indirect communication.
### 5.1.2 Security threats
The request by the NF Service Consumer could be forwarded by the SCP to an
unintended NF.
The request by the NF Service Consumer could be forwarded by the SCP within
the validity of an authorization token more than once to the same NF, which
could result in a deny of service attack.
In indirect communication scenarios an NF Service Consumer cannot verify
whether the service response was sent by a legitimate NF or NRF. NFc can only
authenticate the SCP, but not NFp or NRF. Thus, an NF Service Consumer could
receive service responses from an unintended NF.
### 5.1.3 Potential security requirements
The 5GS should provide a mechanism that allows an NF Service Consumer to
authenticate an NRF or an NF Service Producer during an indirect communication
with them via an SCP.
NOTE: It needs to be taken into account that producer reselection by SCP can
be a desired feature.
## 5.2 Key issue #2: Need for additional security at operational level among
SCP domains
### 5.2.1 Key issue details
TS 23.501 [3] addresses the aspects of handling multiple SCPs in indirect
communication without and with delegated discovery. A SCP domain comprises a
configured group of one or multiple SCPs that can reach certain NF instances
or SCPs directly.
SCPs can register a SCP profile in NRF. TS 23.502 [7] describes in the SCP
profile SCP domain registration details about interconnected SCPs and also
identifies SCPs that interconnect domains. Table 6.1.6.2.2-1 of TS 29.510 [6]
provides a detailed description. SCPs need to request NRF to discover the next
hop SCP to route a service request from the NF Service Consumer to a NF
Service Producer via multiple SCPs.
The primary purpose of SCP domains is to describe the connectivity topology
within a network. All SCPs within an SCP domain can directly interconnect. One
SCP can be part of multiple SCP domains. In fact, the primary purpose of
intermediate SCPs in the path is to interconnect SCP domains, thus, there are
boundaries between SCP domains at each SCP in the path.
PLMN-wide trust between NFs and SCPs is an option, but more restrictions could
be desirable in complex networks with SCP domains, e.g., if SCPs are operated
in different regions/provinces, the domain concept could be used for
establishing operational restrictions by defining SCP domains. Or, there can
be several technical SCP domains within a PLMN, where equipment with different
capabilities is deployed and signalling also varies in some respects, e.g., if
equipment upgrade is performed in a stepwise manner. Such technical domains
can be defined based on computer centre boundaries, based on operators of
subnetworks, based on regions/provinces, etc.
The figure below gives an idea of structuring or grouping a PLMN in several
SCP domains, possibly interconnecting with other SCP domains via dedicated
SCPs.
{width="6.69375in" height="3.765277777777778in"}
Figure 5.2.1-1: Illustration of SCP domains connecting via dedicated SPCs
This key issue is to study the concept of one or several SCP domains becoming
regions of trust of finer granularity than PLMN and whether there is a
necessity of trust and policing of communication within or among such domains,
i.e., for the case that request messages traverse a boundary between trust
domains.
### 5.2.2 Security threats
In large PLMNs operated by different organizations in different
regions/provinces or by slices operated by a tenant, PLMN wide trust between
NFs and SCPs could result in messages traversing over several SCP domain
boundaries, even though this is not wanted. It could be not possible to
shield, e.g., regions or organizations against each other, resulting in
availability of information to unauthorized parts of the network.
If an access token has been requested by one SCP on behalf of the NF Service
Consumer and granted by NRF, it is not guaranteed that the same SCP is
forwarding the service request to the NF Service Producer. Instead, the SCP
could forward the service request including the access token to another SCP
first. If the new SCP is not be part of the same SCP domain, the trust in this
SCP could be less than in SCPs within the same SCP domain.
### 5.2.3 Potential security requirements
Potential security requirements are not addressed in the present document.
Please refer to clause 5.2.4.
5.2.4 Potential architectural/operational security requirements
The 5G system shall allow restricting network topology so that requests
between certain NFs or SCPs or SCP domains are not allowed.
## 5.3 Key Issue #3: Service access authorization in the \"Subscribe-Notify\"
scenarios
### 5.3.1 Key issue details
\"Subscribe-Notify\" NF Service illustration 1 specified in TS 23.501 [3],
clause 7.1.2, allows one NF (e.g., NF_A) to subscribe to notifications of NF
Service Producer (e.g., NF_B). The subscription request includes the
notification endpoint (e.g., the notification URL) of the NF Service Consumer.
In this scenario, NF_A subscribes the service of NF_B for itself.
Figure 5.3.1-1: \"Subscribe-Notify\" NF Service illustration 1 (non-delegated
scenario)
\"Subscribe-Notify\" NF Service illustration 2 specified in TS 23.501 [3],
clause 7.1.2, allows one NF (e.g., NF_A) to subscribe the service of NF
Service Producer (e.g., NF_B) on behalf of another NF (NF_C), in which the
notification URI of NR_C is included. It means the NF_C will receive the
notification message even though the subscribe request is sent by NF_A.
Figure 5.3.1-2: \"Subscribe-Notify\" NF Service illustration 2 (delegated
scenario)
For instance, as defined in TS 23.502 [7] clause 4.15.3.2.2, UDM could send
subscribe request including the UDM URI and NEF URI to the AMF to subscribe
service on behalf of the NEF, i.e., Namf_EventExposure_subscribe request. If
the monitored event occurs, the AMF will send the event report to the
associated notification URI endpoint of the NEF. Here the location report of
the UE is one of the potential event reports, which can be provided by the AMF
during in the above procedure. It means that the UE location report will be
transmitted to the NF_C according to the subscribe request sent by NF_A.
The security issue of \"Subscribe-Notify\" NF Service illustration 1 and 2 is
that NF_B may redirect the Notification message to an unauthorized NF if the
Notification URI in the subscribe message is not authorized. The issue now
also arises because of the subscribe notify use cases that have been defined
with respect to DCCF and MFAF, wherein both the DCCF and the MFAF are only
provided with the URI where the notification has to be sent, and therefore an
unauthorized consumer can receive the notifications if the URI is not
authorized.
Authorization for the subscribe-notify scenarios is not described explicitly
in TS 33.501 [2]. However, it is described in clause 6.7.3 of TS 29.500 [5]:
\"For request/response semantics service operations and for the subscribe and
unsubscribe operations of subscribe/notify semantics service operations, an NF
service consumer may use OAuth 2.0 for the authorization of the API access,
based on local configuration.\" Further: \"For the notify operation of
subscribe/notify semantics service operations, in this release of this
specification OAuth 2.0 access token is not used.\"
This key issue seeks for solutions whether additional means are needed on how
to assure that the notification messages could be only forwarded to an
authorized NF by the NRF and that notifications cannot be leaked.
### 5.3.2 Security threats
When a malicious NF or a compromised NF tries to access an unauthorized
service, in \"Request-Response\" scenario, NRF can verify and prevent it
during access token process. But, in \"Subscribe-Notify\" scenario, a
compromised NF can subscribe a notification service from a NF Service Producer
to notify data to an unauthorized NF (possibly, a malicious NF) by setting
address of notification endpoint (e.g., \"Notification URI\") with address of
the unauthorized NF. In this case, the NF Service Producer cannot ensure that
the NF, whose URI is mentioned, is authorized to receive the notification.
Thus, a malicious NF can force the NF Service Producer to send notifications
to arbitrary consumers, which can, e.g., result in information leakage.
According to TS 23.501 [3], \"Subscribe-Notify\" scenario are used not only
for subscriber\'s mobility, session and subscription related events but also
for NF\'s own event (e.g., AMF Status change), and this information can be
leaked to an unauthorized NF, while according to TS 23.288 [19] Clause 6.2.6
subscribe-notify is used in order to enable the data consumer to receive the
data from DCCF and MFAF. On the other hand, the Notification message that may
include the sensitive information (e.g., location report), may expose to an
unauthorized network function routed by the URI in the subscribe request
message.
Sensitive information in the notification could be disclosed to an
unauthorized entity.
An NF could receive unwanted notifications, leading to a denial of service.
The sender of the notification could be misled to disclose information to an
NF in a different PLMN that the sender is not permitted to disclose to that
PLMN.
### 5.3.3 Potential security requirements
The same security requirements and means as specified for request/response
shall apply.
NOTE 1: TS 33.501[2] lacks security requirements for subscribe/notify, which
can be the same as request/response in most use cases. If requirements are
already fulfilled by existing means in clause 13.4.1 of TS 33.501[2], this can
be stated as part of the solution part.
In detail:
> It shall be possible for the 5G system to ensure notification service is
> only provided to an authorized NF to which a notification message is routed
> (identified by the URI in the subscribe request message). I.e., an NF shall
> be authorized to receive notification messages. The usage of notification
> URI shall be authorized.
>
> It shall be possible for the 5G system to ensure that the subscriber of
> notification messages is authorized to subscribe for notifications on behalf
> of the NF Service Consumer.
The 5G system should mitigate information disclosure of sensitive information
to an unauthorized entity.
The 5G system should mitigate denial of service due to unwanted notifications.
NOTE 2: The following requirement may not be fulfilled, because it is out of
hand if the an authorized notification recipient is disclosing the received
information.
It shall be possible for 5G system to prevent information disclosure to an
unauthorized NF routed by the URI in the subscribe request message.
## 5.4 Key issue #4: Authorization of SCP to act on behalf of an NF or another
SCP
### 5.4.1 Key issue details
This key issue is about authorization of SCP to request services on behalf of
an NF or of another SCP and how this authorization is verified by the NRF or
NF Service Producer.
### 5.4.2 Security threats
If the NRF cannot verify if the SCP has been authorized by the NF Service
Consumer, the SCP can send a service request and receive a valid service
response on behalf of NF Service Consumer, even though the NF Service Consumer
has not authorized the SCP.
If the NF Service Producer cannot verify if the SCP has been authorized by the
NF Service Consumer, the NF Service Producer can provide a service response to
an unauthorized entity.
### 5.4.3 Potential security requirements
The 5GS should provide a mechanism for how an NRF or NF Service Producer can
verify an SCP has been authorized by an NF Service Consumer to request access
tokens or services on behalf of the consumer.
## 5.5 Key issue #5: End-to-end integrity protection of HTTP messages
### 5.5.1 Key issue details
Currently, in the case of indirect communication with an SCP in the path
between an NF Service Consumer and an NF Service Producer, the integrity
protection of the HTTP messages is provided by TLS for each hop but not end-
to-end between the NF Service Consumer and the NF Service Producer. Since an
SCP may need to change the content of an HTTP message, this KI is to
investigate how end-to-end integrity protection of HTTP messages can be
achieved while at the same time continue to allow the SCP to perform necessary
mediation of HTTP messages.
NOTE: Potential issues with backwards compatibility with existing procedures
need to be considered.
### 5.5.2 Security threats
Critical elements of an HTTP message that are not end-to-end integrity
protected could be modified by an attacker. In more detail, a service request
in indirect communication could lead to attacks by Man in the Middle, which
for instance can intercept the service request and try to modify the content
of the message or HTTP (custom) header. This could cause communication
failure, lead to DoS attacks.
### 5.5.3 Potential security requirements
In the case of indirect communication with an SCP in the path between an NF
Service Consumer and an NF Service Producer, the 5GS should support end-to-end
integrity protection of critical elements of an HTTP message while allowing
the SCP to continue to perform necessary HTTP message mediation.
NOTE: Critical HTTP elements would need to be determined by stage 3.
The NF Service Producer should be able to verify that critical elements of a
service request of the NF Service Consumer received via the SCP have not been
modified.
## 5.6 Key issue #6: Access token usage by all consumer NFs of an NF Set
### 5.6.1 Key issue details
SBA introduces the concepts of NF Set and NF Service Set, i.e., sets of
functionally equivalent and inter-changeable NFs or NF services. 5G SBA
architecture design further allows for the concept of stateless NFs, whereby
binding indication the NF Service Resource owner can indicate to the NF
Service Consumer, for a particular resource, whether it is to an NF Service
Instance, NF Instance, NF Service Set or NF Set.
**Access token usage for NF Service Producer Set:**
An access token can be provided by NRF for consuming a service from a
dedicated producer with a distinct NF Instance Id or a specific NF type or a
NF Set Id for a NF Set of NF Service Producer instances. Thus, if the NF
Service Producer belongs to a NF Set, the access token can be consumed by a NF
Service Consumer from any of the NF Service Producers within the set.
**Stateless NFs:**
NF Set concept supports stateless NF implementations i.e., an NF Service
Producer or NF Service Consumer in a NF Set can take over at any time the
control of respectively resource contexts (e.g., PDU session contexts) or
session contexts to receive notifications. NFs typically produce and consume
services (e.g., an SMF producing the PDUSession service to establish PDU
session also needs to consume services to render its PDU session service,
e.g., it consumes PCF and CHF services), taking over the control at any time
allows for reliability of NF instances within the same NF Set (e.g., when an
NF instance fails or is scaled-in).
If an access token is granted to a specific NF Service Consumer instance,
other NF Service Consumer instances in the same NF Set currently need to
request always a new access token, whenever a request is sent by a different
NF Service Consumer instance.
For example, a connection is released since the NF Service Consumer is
stateless, then another NF Service Consumer of the NF Set can be assigned to
continue subsequent communication. This optimization is part of TS 23.501
[3]/TS 29.500 [5], but the related security aspects of using such optimization
have not been addressed in TS 33.501 [2]. Thus, any NF in NF Set issuing a
service request targeting an existing context need to request a new access
token. Further, any subsequent request may be sent to any other NF than the
initiator NF of the NF Set; and also in this case, a new access token is
needed.
**Examples:**
The following examples show, why it is useful to have an access token also be
valid/useable for any NF in the NF Set during its validity time.
1) A SMF instance can wish to remain the SMF (binding to itself), but at end
of procedure, i.e., non-moving UEs anymore foreseen. Thus, this SMF gets
stateless because it considers it is a long time before next SMF involvement.
Thus, if another SMF than the service request originating SMF would get
involved later, it would either need a new token or it could re-use the non-
expired access token, the other SMF instance of the NF Set received earlier.
**2) In stateless UDM, the binding within UDM set can be used.** When UDM
instance of UDM Set initially creates an AMF event subscription, it has to
request an access token to be able to access the corresponding AMF service.
However, the UDM instance that created the subscription may be a completely
different UDM instance of the UDM Set that is later deleting the subscription.
Thus, the same token within the NF Set should be useable for achieving this.
Otherwise, it could end in massive access token requests that are used in the
same context of service consumption.
If an access token cannot be used by any NF in the NF Set during its validity
time, the need for access token requests is multiplied, because every time
there is a different NF instance in the NF Set that is requesting from the
existing resource would need a new access token, while this is not necessarily
required.
**Key issue scope:**
This key issue proposes to study the advantages and disadvantages from
security perspective that any NF in a NF Set targeting a service of an
existing resource can use an access token provided to a NF Set.
If acceptable from security point of view, the benefit of this concept would
be that it maps with the 5G SBA architecture design, the concept of stateless
NF, and the binding level of NF Set, where any NF instance can serve
subsequent request without each time requesting a new access token.
Thus, this key issue studies the security implications of a stateless NF
Service Consumer belonging to a NF Set requesting an access token on behalf of
and for usage by all NF instances of the NF Set.
### 5.6.2 Security threats
In general, the concept of access token is already in place. No new threats
need to be listed.
### 5.6.3 Potential security requirements
All NF Service Consumers of an NF Set shall be authorized to use the access
token requested by one NF Instance of the NF Set, if the access token is
issued for NF Set.
The 5GS may provide means to authorize a NF Service Consumer of the NF Set to
request and/or use an access token requested by another NF Service Consumer of
the same NF Set.
If an access token provided for all NFs of the same NF Set is used, its usage
shall be limited to this specific NF Set.
## 5.7 Key issue #7: Authorization mechanism determination
### 5.7.1 Key issue details
It is specified in TS 33.501 [2] clause 13.3.0 that static authorization can
be used for authorization when token-based authorization is not used. However,
two PLMNs may have a roaming issue if the authorization mechanism is not
aligned between them. For example, when the NF Service Consumer (NFc) deployed
in one PLMN only supports the usage of static authorization, and the NF
Service Producer (NFp) deployed in the other PLMN only supports the usage of
OAuth authorization, the NFp will reject the NF Service Consumer.
On the other hand, TS 29.510 [6] defined an oauth2Required indicating that
OAuth authorization is required for the NFp service access, which will be sent
back to the NFc via the discovery response. Accordingly, NFc should get the
token before consuming the NFp services. Hence, NFc that only supports the
usage of the static authorization will not be able to consume the service
provided by the NFp. However, how to handle the failure issue when the NFc
only supports the usage of static authorization is not clarified.
The key issue will investigate solutions allowing the two operators to handle
the case that one operator uses token-based authorization, and its roaming
partner uses static authorization.
### 5.7.2 Security threats
The SBA service authorization will fail in the roaming case if the
authorization mechanism is not aligned between them.
### 5.7.3 Potential security requirements
The 5GS should provide mechanisms to handle the case that one operator uses
token-based authorization, and its roaming partner uses static authorization.
## 5.8 Key issue #8: Service access authorization requirements in intra-PLMN
scenarios for PLMN deploying multiple NRFs (in OAuth2.0 AS role)
### 5.8.1 Key issue details
#### 5.8.1.1 Introduction {#introduction-2}
Multiple NRFs can be deployed in a PLMN, optionally using a hierarchical
structure whereby an NRF may redirect or forward service requests to another
NRF. One (or more) NRF can serve the entire PLMN, a set of network slices, or
a single network slice.
TS 23.501 [3] states:
> In the context of Network Slicing, based on network implementation, multiple
> NRFs can be deployed at different levels (see clause 5.15.5):
>
> \- PLMN level (the NRF is configured with information for the whole PLMN),
>
> \- shared-slice level (the NRF is configured with information belonging to a
> set of Network Slices),
>
> \- slice-specific level (the NRF is configured with information belonging to
> an S-NSSAI).
One PLMN with several NRFs can be deployed in many ways: NRFs can have all the
same data or could hold different subset of data. NRFs could all be OAuth 2.0
servers or only some of them, e.g., having one NRF being the central OAuth 2.0
server.
To receive an access token, the OAuth 2.0 client need to be known to the NRF
issuing the token. But looking at the different deployment options, the NRF
knowing the client could be different from the NRF authorizing and issuing the
access token. This raises the question, by which NRF an OAuth 2.0 client needs
to be authenticated and by which NRF an OAuth 2.0 client gets the access token
after authorization.
Only the NRF where the NF Service Producer has registered its services can act
as the OAuth 2.0 authorization server, i.e., to provide an access token. But
the requesting NF Service Consumer is not necessarily known to this OAuth
authorization server in deployment scenarios with multiple NRFs. For instance,
an AMF may be registered in a PLMN-wide NRF while SMFs supporting specific
network slice(s) may be registered in a slice(s) specific NRF. How does the
AMF get an access token to access the SMF services in such deployment?
This key issue will clarify the service access authorization requirements and
call flows, for the different NRF deployment models in case of multiple NRFs
in the PLMN, including when the access token request is sent to a different
NRF than the NRF where the NF Service Producer has registered its services.
TS 33.501 [2] does only cover the inter-PLMN case, where vNRF authenticates
the NF Service Consumer and hNRF provides the access token after the hNRF
authorized the NF Service Consumer. How the trust between vNRF and hNRF is
assured needs further clarification. For the intra-PLMN case, in particular
slice specific authorization, such clause is missing.
Therefore, this key issue considers the different deployment models in intra-
PLMN authorization requests.
#### 5.8.1.2 Hierarchical NRFs / Deployment model with local NRFs
This deployment model assumes that NFc needs to be registered at a local NRF
or that NFc is known (as OAuth 2.0 client) at a local NRF. It also assumes
that one NRF is trusting the other NRF in the same PLMN.
When requesting an access token, NFc goes first to its local NRF, which
authenticates NFc and then forwards or redirects the request to the target
NRF, where a NFp has registered its services. In this case the local NRF
authenticates the NFc and the target NRF (holding the policy for NFp services)
provides the access token for NFp service.
Comment: This variant uses the model of inter-PLMN service access
authorization also for intra-PLMN cases with multiple NRFs (with OAuth 2.0
Authorization Server role), i.e., with an NFc registered as OAuth 2.0 client
to one NRF (local NRF) and with access token requests issued by this NFc
always going through this specific/local NRF and being forwarded or redirected
to the target NRF (with OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server role) where the NFp has
registered its services.
This deployment model can also apply to deployments where NFc is registered or
known as OAuth 2.0 client at a NRF that is not necessarily close to NFc, e.g.,
an AMF registered in a PLMN wide NRF.
#### 5.8.1.3 Deployment model with NF Service Consumer directly accessing the
NRF where the NF Service Producer is registered
There can be centralized NRF(s) or distributed NRFs in OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Server role. An NRF can be configured by OAM with OAuth clients/ access token
policies enabling a consumer to get access tokens from different NRFs (in
OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server role).
A NF (e.g., AMF) can register and/or be known as OAuth 2.0 client to a PLMN-
wide NRF, but can also address a specific NRF directly, e.g., AMF can be
configured with or can retrieve from the NSSF the NRF Access Token URI to use
for a specific network slice: AMF may retrieve from the NSSF the NRF Access
Token URI it should use for a specific network slice (see TS 29.531 [13]).
* * *
**nrfAmfSetAccessTokenUri** Uri O 0..1 When present, this IE shall contain the
**API URI of the NRF Access Token Service** (see clause 6.3.2 of TS 29.510
[13]).
* * *
Thus, an AMF can send the Access Token Request directly to the slice specific
NRF, there is no need to go via a \"local\" NRF, where the AMF could be
registered.

> Figure 5.8.1.3-1: From TS 23.502 [7], figure 4.3.2.2.3.2-1: SMF selection
> for non-roaming and roaming with local breakout scenarios
This procedure may be skipped altogether if SMF information is available in
the AMF by other means (e.g., locally configured); otherwise:
\- **when the serving AMF is aware of the appropriate NRF to be used to select
NFs/services within the corresponding Network Slice instance based on
configuration or based on the Network Slice selection information received
during Registration,** only steps 3 and 4 in the following procedure are
executed as described in Figure 4.3.2.2.3.2-1, TS 23.502 [7];
\- when the serving AMF is not aware of the appropriate NRF to be used to
select NFs/services within the corresponding Network Slice instance, all steps
in the following procedure are executed as described in Figure 4.3.2.2.3.2-1,
TS 23.502 [7].
1\. The AMF invokes the Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation from the NSSF
in serving PLMN with the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN from the Allowed NSSAI
requested by the UE, PLMN ID of the SUPI, TAI of the UE and the indication
that the request is within a procedure of PDU Session establishment in either
the non-roaming or roaming with local breakout scenario.
2\. **The NSSF in serving PLMN selects the Network Slice instance, determines
and returns the appropriate NRF to be used to select NFs/services within the
selected Network Slice instance, and optionally may return a NSI ID
corresponding to the Network Slice instance.**
See TS 29.531 [13], clause 6.1.6.2.7 which includes:
* * *
nrfAccessTokenUri Uri O 0..1 When present, this IE shall contain the API URI
of the NRF Access Token Service (see clause 6.3.2 of TS 29.510 [13]).
* * *
Thus, based on configuration or based on the Network Slice selection
information received during Registration or PDU session establishment, the AMF
is aware of the appropriate NRF to be used to select NFs/services within the
corresponding Network Slice instance. There is no way to pass this URI to a
\"local NRF\" (where the AMF would be known as OAuth 2.0 client), as opposed
to the Inter-PLMN case, where the NRF Access Token Request supports the AMF
providing the hnrfAccessTokenUri.

Not applicable, since this key issue is for clarifying missing specification

## 5.9 Key issue #9: Authorization for Inter-Slice Access
### 5.9.1 Key issue details
In the current SBA authorization framework, the mechanisms specified to
validate the S-NSSAI of NF Service Consumer are not fully specified and
therefore, sometimes an NF Service Producer and/or NRF is dependent on local
configuration or proprietary mechanisms to verify if the NF Service Consumer
really belongs to the S-NSSAI it is claiming to belong to. While an NRF could
validate the S-NSSAI by comparing the S-NSSAI provided in, e.g., Access-Token-
Get request with the S-NSSAI registered in the NF-Profile; this is not always
possible, as it is not necessary that every NF registers its profile with NRF,
unless the information is available to NRF by other means (e.g., local
configuration). This results in a NF Service Consumer gaining access to slices
it should not have been allowed to access.
Additionally, currently there is no mechanisms specified whereby an NRF could
validate if an NF Service Consumer is allowed to access resources belonging to
a different S-NSSAI in the NF Service Producer. While an NRF could specify, in
the Access Token Grant, the S-NSSAIs an NF Service Consumer is allowed to
access in the NF Service producer, it is assumed that NRF uses local
configurations while providing such information.
This Key Issue will study how to prevent any malicious entity (for instance a
NF Service Consumer) from accessing a slice it is not authorized to access, or
from requesting a service from a slice which it is not authorized to access.
NOTE: Assuming that an NF within a 3GPP network can be fully compromised would
be a rather strong assumption. This Key Issue only aims to strengthen the
authorization mechanism for granting access to an NF within SBA.
### 5.9.2 Security threats
A malicious entity (for instance a NF Service Consumer) can request an access
token for the slice it is not authorized to access.
A malicious entity (for instance a NF Service Consumer) can send a service
request for the slice which it is not authorized to access.
### 5.9.3 Potential security requirements
The 5GS should provide a mechanism that allows the NF Service Producer not to
provide service to NF Service Consumers, which are not authorized to access a
slice.
The 5GS should provide a mechanism that allows NRF not to provide access
tokens to NF Service Consumers which are not authorized to access a slice.
## 5.10 Key issue #10: N32 security in mediated roaming scenarios
### 5.10.1 Introduction {#introduction-3}
In roaming scenarios, the communication between the visited network and the
home network is sometimes mediated and routed through intermediaries. The
following types of intermediaries exist.
**IPX providers:** While, traditionally, for some roaming relations, they
simply route the traffic, for others they actively modify certain messages in
order to establish or enhance interoperability.
**Roaming hubs:** There are two types of roaming hub, as follows.
**-** **Public Roaming Hubs** offer a contractual and technical framework that
enables operators to avoid entering a very large number of roaming agreements
with individual other operators in order to achieve a large roaming coverage.
By contracting the roaming hub, the operator obtains access to a large roaming
footprint, without individually contracting the operators that are mediated
through the hub. Apart from mediating the signalling, roaming hubs typically
also mediate the billing.
**\- Operator Group Roaming Hubs** offer similar services as public roaming
hubs, and are special in that they are used by group network operator
companies that reside in the same security domain to consolidate and secure
operator group roaming.
The key issue looks at N32 security in intermediary scenarios, in particular
roaming hub scenarios that have not been addressed in TS 33.501[2] so far.
### 5.10.2 Key issue details
The GSMA is working on best practice guidance and related specifications for
how operators interact with both IPX and roaming hubs. However, the pre-5G
architecture of these methods uses the LTE hop-by-hop security paradigm. In
5G, SEPP communication for roaming relies on end-to-end security by design as
specified in TS 33.501 [2], i.e., messages are authenticated and integrity-
protected between the SEPP of the visited network and the SEPP of the home
network. This creates the need to study in more detail how the migration away
from hop-by-hop security can be achieved without loss of the benefits provided
by IPX providers and roaming hubs while the 5G security requirements on N32
are met.
In certain scenarios, IPX providers and roaming hubs would need to modify
certain IEs. This requires the setup of appropriate modification policies
between the roaming partners. Given that, according to TS 33.501 [2],
\- all attributes transferred over the N32-f interface shall be integrity
protected (clause 5.9.3.3),
\- a default data-type encryption policy, which provides confidentiality
protection for authentication vectors, cryptographic material and location
data, and optionally for SUPI, applies (clause 5.9.3.3), and
\- any roaming partner-specific data-type encryption policy takes precedence
over the default policy (clause 13.2.3.6),
> and further given that:
\- it is assumed that the set of IEs to be modified depends on the deployment
scenario; and
\- no default modification policy has been specified;
\- maintaining a large set of roaming partner-specific modification policies
could cause avoidable complexities. It is, therefore, unclear whether the
current specification needs to be extended in order to avoid such
complexities.
Furthermore, a roaming hub may need to prevent the setup of N32-c between a
home network SEPP and a visited network SEPP, e.g., in case the respective
operators have not established a commercial roaming relation via the roaming
hub.
### 5.10.3 Security requirements
Existing requirements in TS 33.501[2] on the SEPP should apply in the roaming
intermediary scenario unless there are explicit exceptions.
Specifically, the requirements on edge protection of the PLMN should still
apply, including end-to-end security for N32-c.
Existing NFs and SCPs should be impacted as least as possible.
For the scenarios involving intermediaries (IPX providers, roaming hubs),
requirements are as follows.
\- The intermediaries (IPX providers, roaming hubs) shall use their own unique
credentials to authenticate themselves.
## 5.11 Key issue #11: NRF validation of NFc for access token requests
### 5.11.1 Key issue details
#### 5.11.1.0 General
There are several procedures for access token requests in TS 33.501 [2] clause
13.4.1, each for different scenarios such as direct or indirect communication.
The description of how the NRF authorizes the access token request are more or
less detailed. The most detailed description is in clause 13.4.1.1.2, Access
token request for accessing services of NF Service Producers of a specific NF
type: \"The NRF may verify that the input parameters (e.g., NF type) in the
access token request match with the corresponding ones in the public key
certificate of the NF Service Consumer or those in the NF profile of the NF
Service Consumer. The NRF checks whether the NF Service Consumer is authorized
to access the requested service(s).\" Other procedures either refer to clause
13.4.1.1.2 or contain even less detailed descriptions.
There are several issues with how authorization of access token requests is
described in TS 33.501 [2].
#### 5.11.1.1 NFc registration at NRF not mandatory (Problem 1a)
Not all NF Service Consumers register an NF profile at the NRF. This results
in no NF profile is available. Furthermore, the NF profile is provided by the
NF itself, which makes it a less reliable source for deciding whether the NF
is authorized.
#### 5.11.1.2 IEs mandated in SBA TLS certificate not sufficient for NFc
validation (Problem 1b)
It is not a mandatory requirement that all IEs defined in the SBA TLS
certificate has been filled in with information presented in the TLS
certificate. For example, NF Type is only \"should\". Other kind of
information, like slice information, is not contained in the TLS certificate
profile at all. So, there may be situations when certificates are available,
but information may not be sufficient for NFc validation in NRF. It is not
specified how the NRF shall validate the NFc request in all situations.
#### 5.11.1.3 Questions from Problems 1a and 1b
The study needs to elaborate on the following questions:
1\. What IEs are required to validate as a minimum?
2\. What information shall be used in NRF to validate the NFc?
3\. How is this information provisioned in NRF?
#### 5.11.1.4 TLS certificate or NF profile - precedence in NFc validation
(Problem 2)
It is also possible that the NFc TLS certificate is available together with
the NF profile registered in the NRF. In this case it is unclear what
precedence the NRF shall use when performing the NFc validation. The
information in the profile is provided by the NFc itself, but the information
in the certificate is provided outside of the NFc, i.e., the CA.
#### 5.11.1.5 Questions from Problem 2
The study needs to elaborate on the following questions:
1) What information shall have precedence when NFc certificate is available as
well as the NF profile?
2) What information shall be cross-checked between the certificate and the
profile?
### 5.11.2 Security threats
The security level may be NRF vendor specific if not specified.
If there is no standardized agreement of the solution to the Key Issue the
interoperability between different vendors of NFc and NRF may result in being
too allowing from a security perspective.
### 5.11.3 Potential security requirements
This KI does not add any new security requirements but is focused on to
develop solutions to the problems stated above.
## 5.12 Key issue #12: Security in Hosted SEPP scenarios
### 5.12.1 Key issue details
#### 5.12.1.1 Background
It has been discussed that SEPPs can be deployed in different ways:
\- Local SEPP: The SEPP is deployed within the PLMN. This is the deployment as
specified by TS 33.501 [2].
{width="3.5069444444444446in" height="1.0416666666666667in"}
Figure 5.12.1-1 Local SEPP deployment
\- Outsourced SEPP: The SEPP is outsourced by the PLMN and deployed within the
PLMN infrastructure and considered within the PLMN secure domain Several PLMNs
which form an Operator Group can use the same outsourced SEPP. This scenario
is described as an Operator Group Roaming Hub in KI#10 and GSMA NG.113 [8].
{width="3.763888888888889in" height="1.1805555555555556in"}
Figure 5.12.1-2 Outsourced SEPP deployment
\- Hosted SEPP: The SEPP is outsourced by the PLMN and hosted by an external
entity and deployed outside the PLMN. Such a SEPP could be used by different
PLMNs.
{width="3.4444444444444446in" height="0.9166666666666666in"}
Figure 5.12.1-3 Hosted SEPP deployment
The \"Hosted SEPP\" scenario is subject of this key issue.
#### 5.12.1.2 Issues to be studied
In a Hosted SEPP scenario it is necessary to consider different perspectives
when assessing the security perimeter boundaries. From the roaming partners\'
perspective, the security perimeter of the PLMN extends to the Hosted SEPP
provider, as described in TS 33.501, clause 4.2.1. From the perspective of the
PLMN itself, the Hosted SEPP provider operates within its own security domain.
Since the Hosted SEPP potentially serves multiple PLMNs as the Hosted SEPP is
a service by a service provider, the requirements for introducing such Hosted
SEPP need to be clarified.
Nevertheless, in the Hosted SEPP deployment scenario, the Hosted SEPP is
similarly to any SEPP responsible for
\- Terminating the N32c/f interface (TLS, PRINS) - N32 side
\- Providing topology Hiding - N32 side
\- Providing filtering criteria and capabilities -- N32 side
\- Filtering criteria and possibly a firewall -- Home PMN side.
The following issues are required for studying:
\- Whether the external entity, e.g., the IPX, which hosts the SEPP, uses
certificates from its own CA or uses certificates issued from the Home PLMN
(i.e., all PLMNs that want to use the Hosted SEPP service) and whether the
Home PLMN is willing to consider and use, e.g., the IPX\'s CA as trusted CA;
\- Whether the Hosted SEPP can handle private addresses of the Home PMN;
\- Whether the Hosted SEPP is trusted to enforce market specific regulatory
requirements;
\- In addition, the connection between Hosted SEPP and the Home PMN needs
protection, e.g., Topology Hiding, filtering criteria and firewall, etc.
The PKI infrastructure can be deployed in different ways for issuing the
digital identities to the hosted SEPP\'s PLMN facing SBI and external facing
N32.
A PLMN can use both Local SEPPs (managed by PLMN) and Hosted SEPPs, i.e., the
PLMN has Local SEPPs each handling a set of roaming relations, while the
Hosted SEPPs handle a different set of roaming relations.
### 5.12.2 Threats
In a scenario of Hosted SEPP additional risks arise. These include:
\- attacks on the traffic between PLMN\'s NFs and the PLMN\'s Hosted SEPP,
\- insufficient protection of the PLMN core,
\- lack of a way to attribute the cause of a security issue to a specific
actor (e.g., the operator or the Hosted SEPP provider),
\- an unauthorized actor claiming to be a Hosted SEPP provider of an operator
towards its roaming partners, and
\- risks due to one actor operating Hosted SEPPs for multiple PLMNs
(overlapping PLMN security domains).
### 5.12.3 Security requirements
The Hosted SEPP scenario introduces security requirements for the connection
between PLMNs and the Hosted SEPP operator.
Existing requirements in TS 33.501[2] on the SEPP shall apply in the Hosted
SEPP scenario, unless there are explicit exceptions. Specifically, edge
protection requirements can differ from the existing requirements since the
hosted SEPP is not deployed at the edge of the PLMN.
Existing NFs and SCPs should be impacted as least as possible.
Further, the following requirements shall apply:
\- The Hosted SEPP providers shall use their own unique credentials to
authenticate themselves. Moreover, it shall be possible for operators that
receive signalling from a Hosted SEPP provider pertaining to a roaming partner
to verify that the Hosted SEPP provider has been authorised by the roaming
partner.
\- The connection between the PLMN and the Hosted SEPP provider shall be
confidentiality, integrity, and replay protected.
\- The solution should enable the Hosted SEPP providers to operate SEPPs for
multiple PLMNs in a way that isolates the SEPP instances operated for
different PLMNs from each other for security reasons. Specifically, if one of
the instances gets corrupted or otherwise malfunctions, other instances should
remain unaffected as much as possible.

## 6.1 Solution #1: Verification of the entity sending the service response in
indirect communication without delegated discovery
### 6.1.1 Introduction {#introduction-4}
This solution is addressing KI#1.
This solution allows the NF Service Consumer (NFc) to verify the genuineness
of the NF Service Producer (NFp), which is sending the response, when an SCP
is used in between and the discovery of NFp has not been delegated to the SCP
(see TS 33.501 [2] Annex R, model C). I.e., The deployment scenario addressed
is indirect communication (via SCP) without delegated discovery without re-
selection.
The solution counters a malicious SCP or a Man in the Middle (MitM) that could
forward the service request to a malicious or unauthorized NF Service
Producer, i.e., a NFp that was not intended to provide a response. Especially
where multiple SCPs are involved, and the NF Service Consumer does not know
whether the right entity or some malicious entity is responding its request,
this situation can occur.
Currently there is no means to prevent a malicious SCP or Man in the Middle to
forward the service request to a different NF Service Producer.
The example shows a Service request with a token for service consumption from
NFp that has been redirected by a malicious MitM to a different NF Service
Producer, which can be a rogue NF cooperating with the MitM.
**Figure** 6.1.1-1**:** Example of a potential attacking scenario
This solution avoids that a service response is returned back to the NF
Service Consumer by an unauthenticated and/or unauthorized MitM.
### 6.1.2 Solution details
NFc discovers NFp at NRF and requests an access token for a specific NFp
Instance ID for consuming a service from NFp.
If indicated by NFc in the service request, the NFp provides back its CCA_NFp.
Thus, the NFc can compare the NFp instance ID in the CCA_NFp with the selected
NF instance ID when NFc requested the service. I.e., NFc can check if the NFp
ID that the access token was provided for by NRF is matching the NFp ID
present in the subject of CCA_NFp. Since NFp provides its CCA_NFp, this
comparison is even possible if the response is sent via SCP.
If the NFp includes its own CCA_NFp in the service response, by this the NFc
can verify that NFp, the sender of the service response, is the one that
NFc\'s service request was sent to.
This allows authentication of NFp by NFc, i.e., by NFc verifying the CCA_NFp
against the original NFp Instance ID, for which NRF provided the access token.
NFp is authenticated, if the certificate NFp used to sign CCA has been
verified by NFc. In case of failure, error messages can be triggered and
reported to the operator.
In the following, the steps are described in detail.
Figure 6.1.2-2: Flow chart for allowing verification of NF sending the service
response
Step1,2: NFc selects NFp to send a service request along with the token. To
allow NFc to validate the service response, it will require validation of the
producer\'s identity via CCA as part of the response.
Step 3: SCP intends to forward the service request to further SCPs. If SCP or
some proxy is malicious (or MitM), it forwards the service request to a rouge
NFp instead.
Step 4,5: A rouge NF can try to send the service response without performing
the authorization. As the service request requires validation, the NFp has to
add its CCA header, CCA_NFp.
Step 6: SCP will relay back the response to NFc including the CCA_NFp.
Step 7: NFc compare the NFp instance ID received and Set ID (if present) in
the CCA_NFp with the one used for service request. If it is the same, then NFc
is assured the service response is received from a genuine NFp.
Step 8: If it does not match, the NFc can also raise an alarm and revert the
transaction at NFc.
### 6.1.3 Evaluation
This solution proposes an enhancement at the NF Service Producer to use the
CCA as defined in TS 33.501 [2]. It provides an approach how an NF Service
Consumer can authenticate NF Service Producer, from which NF Service Consumer
received a service response, as intended NF for Service Response in indirect
communication without delegated discovery.
This solution introduces Client credentials assertion of NF Service Producer
which includes NFp Instance ID and signature using certificate of NFp. The NF
Service Consumer can validate the CCA sent by the NF Service Producer and
ensure that no rogue or malicious SCP or MitM has sent a service request to a
malicious NF Service Producer.
This solution is only applicable in a very limited scope, it does not cover
model D and the case when SCP reselects another NF as NF Service Producer
which is different from the targeted NF Service Producer by NF Service
Consumer. Therefore, it is possible for NF Service Consumer to reject the
received service response from a legitimate NF Service Producer and may induce
service unavailability. Further, the NF Service Producer cannot determine if
the request coming from SCP which is using model D or SCP using model C or a
re-selected by SCP, so the producer cannot determine, when to generate
CCA_NFp.
## 6.2 Solution #2: Authorization between NFs and SCP
### 6.2.1 Introduction {#introduction-5}
This potential solution addresses KI#4.
### 6.2.2 Solution details
When sending the service request to SCP in delegated discovery, the NF Service
Consumer needs to authorize the SCP to act on its behalf. Thus, NRF needs to
be provided with evidence by NFc about the SCP instance ID.
NRF knows implicit the SCP instance ID because of direct TLS between SCP and
NRF, when SCP ID would be added in a SCP TLS certificate. But this still does
not assure that NFc as sent its request to this SCP. Thus, authorization
between NF Service Consumer and SCP, when sending the service request to SCP
in delegated discovery, has to be explicit. The solution proposes to do so by
enhancing the CCA by inserting either the SCP Instance ID or the SCP Domain
Info in CCA_NFc, and therefore the NF Service Consumer can authorize SCP.
NOTE: Since in model D the NF Service Consumer is delegating the discovery, as
well as access token request, service request and receiving service response
to SCP, the NF Service Consumer authorizes the SCP to perform these actions on
its behalf.
The SCP also generates its own enhanced CCA_SCP including its Instance ID
and/or its Domain Info and sends it along with access token request and the
enhanced CCA_NFc as received from NF Service Consumer.
{width="6.694444444444445in" height="4.104166666666667in"}
Figure 6.2.2-1: Authorization of SCP by NFc in indirect communication
The NRF verifies that the Target SCP Instance ID and/or SCP Domain info
present in the CCA_NFc matches the Instance ID/Domain Info of SCP as also
being part of the subject of the CCA_SCP. A successful verification of CCA(s)
by NRF ensures that the SCP has been authorized by the NF Service Consumer.
Thus, the NRF needs to know the SCP Instance ID. One way for the NRF to learn
the SCP instance ID is to use direct TLS between SCP and NRF, this requires
SCP ID in the SCP TLS certificate which is currently not specified in TS
33.310 [14]. Another way for the NRF to learn the SCP instance ID is by
CCA_SCP.
If authentication was successful and the NF Service Consumer is authorized
based on the NRF policy and the SCP requesting the access token has been
explicitly authorized by NF Service Consumer, the NRF issues an access token.
A similar solution is also applicable for authorizing SCP by NFc to request a
service and receive a response from NFp on its behalf. The NFp then may
perform similar verification and, in case of successful verification, can send
the service response to SCP.
However, even if the TLS certificate of the NFc would mandate the usage of NFc
Instance ID, another problem still needs to be solved in case the SCP selects
another SCP. This is because if the NRF or the NF Service Producer do not know
the SCP domain, to which the SCP belongs to, the SCP_CCA included by NFc does
not help NRF. Thus, for this reason it is suggested that the TLS certificate
needs in addition to SCP Instance Id also to hold the SCP domain identifier
for allowing NRF to verify that NFc authorized one SCP of a SCP domain.
If the SCP, that NF Service Consumer delegated the authorization token request
to, is not serving the NF Service Consumer request by itself, but demands
another SCP\' to do so, then the same procedure is needed between SCP and
SCP\'. Hence, SCP forward the service request to SCP\' with its own CCA_SCP
including into it the SCP\' ID.
The verification of the CCA shall be performed by the receiving node as
described in clause 13.3.8.3, but verifying that the SCP instance ID in the
CCA is matching the SCP instance ID in the public key certificate used for
signing the CCA. This is either done by an SCP, in case there are several SCPs
in between, or by the NF Service Producer.
In practice, one would expect one to three SCPs between consumer and producer.
But it needs to be noted, if the NF Service Producer wants to have
verification of the full chain of trust via several SCPs, all CCAs and
certificates from the NF Service Consumer and the intermediary SCPs need to be
available to the NF Service Producer.
### 6.2.3 Evaluation
This solution fulfils requirement on KI#4. The SCP can be authorized to act on
behalf of an NF Service Consumer and to request access tokens by NFc, because
the NFc is including the SCP ID or SCP Domain ID into CCA_NFc. With NFc
providing the SCP ID in the CCA, authorization of that particular SCP is
given, because NRF or NF Service Producer can verify that the SCP, which
provides CCA_NFc, is indeed the one SCP to which the NF Service Consumer sent
its CCA and has authorized that SCP to request services and receive response
on its behalf.
Thus, this solution counters a potential attack of SCP stealing a CCA and
using it for requesting an access token without being requested by a NF
Service Consumer.
The concept of CCAs is already known. In addition to verifying the NFc CCA the
NF Service Producer needs to verify also the CCAs of one or several SCPs. In
addition to the verification of the NF Service Consumer\'s CCA the NRF needs
to verify also the CCAs of one or several SCPs. Further, SCPs need to be able
to create their own CCAs.
## 6.3 Solution #3: Using existing procedures for authorization of SCP to act
on behalf of an NF Service Consumer
### 6.3.1 Introduction {#introduction-6}
This solution addresses Key Issue #4 \"Authorization of SCP to act on behalf
of an NF or another SCP\". It explains how token-based authorization and CCAs
as currently specified in TS 33.501 [2] can be used to authorize the SCP to
act on behalf of an NF Service Consumer, i.e., to request access tokens or
services on behalf of the consumer. The solution relies on implicit
authorization of the SCP using mutual TLS between NF Service Consumer and SCP.
### 6.3.2 Solution details
#### 6.3.2.1 Request of access token on behalf of the consumer
The SCP requests access tokens on behalf of the consumer in Scenario D
(indirect communication with delegated discovery) and in Scenario C (indirect
communication without delegated discovery) without mutual authentication
between NF and NRF at the transport layer. The following procedure describes
token requests for Scenario D, and particularly how CCAs are used to authorize
the SCP to request access tokens on behalf of the NF Service Consumer. For
Scenario C without mutual authentication between NF and NRF at the transport
layer, the same principles hold.
Figure 6.3.2.1-1: Access token request of SCP on behalf of an NF Service
Consumer
1\. The NF Service Consumer sends a service request to the SCP. The consumer
includes a CCA signed by the consumer. The CCA includes the NF Instance ID of
the consumer. The consumer\'s certificate used for signing the CCA also
contains the consumer\'s NF Instance ID.
2\. The SCP sends an access token request to the NRF. The SCP includes the CCA
received by the consumer in step 1.
3\. The NRF verifies the CCA as described in clause 13.3.8.3 of TS 33.501 [2]
and thus obtains the NF Instance ID of the consumer that signed the CCA.
Besides authentication of the consumer, the CCA also implicitly authorizes the
SCP to act on behalf of the NF Service Consumer.\ The NRF authorizes the NF
Service Consumer as described in TS 33.501 [2].
4.-8. The remaining steps of the access token request and service request
procedure are exactly as described in TS 33.501 [2].
#### 6.3.2.2 Service request on behalf of the consumer
The SCP requests services on behalf of the consumer in all indirect
communication scenarios. The following procedure describes access token and
service requests for Scenario D, and particularly how CCAs and access tokens
are used to authorize the SCP to request services on behalf of the NF Service
Consumer. For Scenario C, the same principles hold.
Figure 6.3.2.2-1: Service request of SCP on behalf of an NF Service Consumer
1.-4. Service request and access token request and response are performed as
described in the previous clause, clause 6.3.2.1.
5\. The SCP sends a service request to the NF Service Producer. The service
request contains the access token and optionally the CCA received in step 1.
The access token contains the NF instance ID of the NF Service Consumer.
6\. The NF Service Producer validates the access token as described in TS
33.501 [2]. Because the network implements the procedures described in the
previous clause, clause 6.3.2.1, the NRF has already verified that the SCP was
authorized to request the access token on behalf of the NF Service Consumer.
Hence the access token does not only authorize the consumer, but also
implicitly authorizes the SCP to act on behalf of the NF Service Consumer.
7.-8. The remaining steps of the access token request and service request
procedure are exactly as described in TS 33.501 [2].
#### 6.3.2.4 Protection of the NF Service Consumer\'s CCA
The CCA is protected in transport and storage by the following methods, partly
in and partly out of 3GPP scope:
\- Transport protection: The CCA is protected in transport by TLS or other
means, as specified in TS 33.501 [2], clause 13.1.0. Thus, it is protected
between NF and SCP, and between SCP and NRF or NFp.
\- Storage protection: Although CCAs are expected to be short-lived, they
could be cached for a short period of time at the NF Service Consumer. Similar
as for other data handled at the NF Service Consumer, e.g., sensitive UE data,
storage protection mechanisms outside of 3GPP scope need to be in place.
If used according to the procedure describes in clause 6.3.2.1, only the NF
Service Consumer itself, the SCP and the NRF will obtain the CCA that allows
to request access tokens on behalf of the NF Service Consumer. This solution
assumes, that the SCP is authorized by the NF Service Consumer to request
access tokens on behalf of it, the NF Service Consumer indicates that by
sending the CCA to the SCP. The NRF is itself the entity that issues access
tokens for the NF Service Consumer. Hence, if used according to the procedure
described in clause 6.3.2.1, only entities that are authorized by the NF
Service Consumer to request access tokens on behalf of it obtain the CCA.
### 6.3.3 Evaluation
The solution addresses the threats and requirements of Key issue #4:
Authorization of SCP to act on behalf of an NF or another SCP.
The solution relies on token-based authorization and CCAs as currently
specified in TS 33.501 [2].
It proposes that authorization of the SCP by the CCA is implicit by sending
the CCA to the SCP, i.e., by presenting the CCA_NFc received by the NF Service
Consumer, the SCP shows it is authorized to act on behalf of the Consumer and
to request access tokens on behalf of it. However, authorization is not
explicitly stated in the CCA. No e2e authorization information is provided
from the NFc to NRF or NFp. Hence an entity that is not authorized by the NF
Service Consumer but somehow has obtained a valid CCA signed by the consumer
could use it to request access tokens on behalf of the consumer. Thus, in this
case the NRF or the NFp can provide the service response to an unauthorized
consumer.
## 6.4 Solution #4: Service request authenticity verification in indirect
communication
### 6.4.1 Introduction {#introduction-7}
This solution addresses the KI#5.
### 6.4.2 Solution details
This solution allows the NF Service Producer to verify that a service request
of the NF Service Consumer received via SCP has not been modified.
In case of CCA is used for authentication, the service request received by NRF
or NF Service Producer can be verified as the one to be originally sent by the
NF Service Consumer. This would guarantee that in indirect communication no
intermediary can modify the service request unrecognized.
NOTE 1: To avoid backward compatibility issues and allow to distinguish
between releases, a new API URI with the respective release version can be
used.
For this, the CCA is enhanced with a new payload value for \'service request
verification\' and a protected header list.
\- The \'service request verification\' (SRV) includes the service request
message (or a hash of it) as one of the payload values. If not the hash but
the whole message or header is included, impact on the throughput is expected.
\- The protected header list (HL) includes custom headers that shall be
integrity protected and thus not be modifiable undetected by SCP.
If present, the NF Service Producer or the NRF can verify whether these data
included in the CCA are matching the service request as sent by the NF Service
Consumer. I.e., the NF Service Producer verifies that the data included in the
payload is matching the service request received together with the CCA. The
receiver also verifies that the headers in the protected header list are not
modified.
Since CCA is digitally signed by the NF Service Consumer, thus the recipient
can verify that the service request received from SCP is the original one as
provided by the NF Service Consumer. The additional SRV payload provides
authenticity of the service request.
NOTE 2: This solution assumes that an SCP does not need to modify service
request details for providing its service of delegated discovery and access
token request to NRF or transferring a service request to the NF Service
Producer. If there are headers that need to be modified by SCP/Proxy, then
those headers cannot be considered as payload of SRV. The NF Service Consumer
provides in this case a separate list of headers (HL) to explicitly state what
is covered under SRV. The destination endpoint (NRF or NF) can take them in
consideration while verifying the received data.
In detail:
\- NF Service Consumer creates a service request and creates a keyed hash
value about those parts of the service request, that are not to be modifiable
by the SCP, and generates CCA including a \'service request verification\'
(SRV) payload with the keyed hash value. If necessary, a protected HL is
included.
NOTE 3: A keyed hash value is not necessary, because the hash is signed
digitally in the CCA.
\- NRF, after verifying the authenticity of NF Service Consumer by checking
the CCA, it checks SRV, i.e., it verifies the authenticity of the service
request by creating a hash of the service request and comparing it with the
received SRV value. It also verifies that the headers in the protected HL are
not modified.
\- NF Service Producer, after receiving an access token and CCA/SRV from the
SCP, it verifies the NF Service Consumer by checking the CCA, it checks
whether the NF instance id for which the access token was provided, matches
the identity in CCA and it verifies the authenticity of the service request by
creating a hash of the service request and comparing it with the received SRV
value. It also verifies that the headers in the protected HL are not modified.
### 6.4.3 Evaluation
This solution provides an approach how an NF Service Producer can verify that
a service request of the NF Service Consumer received via SCP has not been
modified.
This solution extends Client credentials assertion to include new payload
value for service request verification and a protected header list.
When the service request verification includes whole service request message,
which may double the size of the message and may impact on system throughput.
When the service request verification includes hash value of service request
message, additional information should be transmitted to the NF Service
Producer to inform HTTP headers and order among HTTP headers which should be
considered in calculation of hash value.
When SCP appends HTTP standard header(s) such as Via header and Authenticate
header, in this solution, NF Service Producer cannot recognize those headers
should not be considered in calculation of hash as those are added by SCP and
NF Service Producer will fail to calculate correct hash value of HTTP message.
## 6.5 Solution #5: End-to-end integrity protection of HTTP body and method
### 6.5.1 Introduction {#introduction-8}
This solution addresses the key issue #5 (End-to-end integrity protection of
HTTP messages).
The core steps of this solution are:
\- Use Client Credentials Assertions (CCAs) based authentication as specified
in TS 33.501 [2] Clause 13.3.8 for NF-NRF or/and NF-NF communication.
\- Enhance the Client Credentials Assertions (CCAs) to optionally include a
hash of the HTTP body and HTTP method to protect the message itself.
\- The receiving node (NRF or NF Service Producer) computes the hash of the
HTTP body and HTTP method and validates that it is identical to the hash
received in the Client credentials assertions (CCAs).
Since the added hash is an optional field in the ClientCredentialsAssertion as
specified in TS 29.500 [5] Table 5.2.3.2.11-1, this solves the backwards
compatibility with Rel-16 NF Service Producers supporting only existing CCA. A
Rel-16 NF Service Producer will verify the signature of the CCA correctly but
ignore the optional field that it does not recognize. The behaviour is similar
to Rel-15 NF Service Producers\' behaviour for IEs in access tokens that were
introduced in Rel-16. As specified in TS 29.510 [6], Table 6.3.5.2.4-1
\"Definition of type AccessTokenClaims\", if an NF Service Producer receives
an IE in the access token that it does not understand, the NF Service Producer
ignores the IE. Similar behavior can be specified for IEs in the CCA, see
Table 6.5.2-1 below.
### 6.5.2 Solution details
Figure 6.5.2-1: CCA based Authentication with HTTP hash enhancement
1\. NF Service Consumer sends a service request including a signed Client
credentials assertion (CCA) token to authenticate against NF Service Producer
or NRF as described in TS 33.501 [2] Clause 13.3.8. But for this solution it
is also proposed to add an optional field in CCA to protect the part of the
message itself. The added field is a hash of HTTP body and HTTP method.
2\. NF Service Producer or NRF validates the CCA as described in TS 33.501
[2], clause 13.3.8.3. But since one optional field is supposed to be added to
the CCA, the receiving end point (NF Service Producer or NRF) also needs to
compute the hash of the HTTP body and HTTP method and validates that it is
identical to the hash received in the Client Credentials Assertion.
The updated definition of type ClientCredentialsAssertion in TS 29.500 [5] is
(additions in **bold** style):
Table 6.5.2-1: Updated CCA based on Table 5.2.3.2.11 -1: Definition of type
ClientCredentialsAssertion
Attribute name Data type P Cardinality Description
* * *
sub NfInstanceId M 1 This IE shall contain the NF instance ID of the NF
Service Consumer, corresponding to the standard \"Subject\" claim described in
IETF RFC 7519 [15], clause 4.1.2. iat integer M 1 This IE shall indicate the
time at which the JWT was issued, corresponding to the standard \"Issued At\"
claim described in IETF RFC 7519 [15], clause 4.1.6. This claim may be used to
determine the age of the JWT. exp integer M 1 This IE shall contain the
expiration time after which the client credentials assertion is considered to
be expired, corresponding to the standard \"Expiration Time\" claim described
in IETF RFC 7519 [15], clause 4.1.4. aud array(NFType) M 1..N This IE shall
contain the NF type of the NF Service Producer and/or \"NRF\", for which the
claim is applicable, corresponding to the standard \"Audience\" claim
described in IETF RFC 7519 [15], clause 4.1.3. hash string O 0..1 This IE
contains a hash of the body of the HTTP message and HTTP method. If an NF
Service Producer that receives this IE in the CCA included in the 3gpp-Sbi-
Client-Credentials header does not understand this IE, it shall be ignored.
halg string or integer O 0..1 This IE contains the hash algorithm information
that is used by NF Service Consumer to compute the hash of the HTTP message.
If an NF Service Producer that receives this IE in the CCA included in the
3gpp-Sbi-Client-Credentials header does not understand this IE, it shall be
ignored.
The details of the hash are proposed to be specified as following:
Option 1: For computation of the hash of the HTTP body and HTTP method for
inclusion into the Client credential assertion, the input S to the KDF
specified in Annex B of TS 33.220 [4] is computed as follows:
\- P0 = HTTP body;
\- L0 = length of the HTTP body;
\- P1 = HTTP method;
\- L1 = length of HTTP method.
The input key KEY is equal to null. Note that the FC value will be allocated
in the normative phase.
Option 2: Alternatively to using the fixed KDF as hash function, the choice of
hash function can also be done similar as in JWT or JWS. The hash algorithm is
chosen by NF Service Consumer. The selection of hash algorithm needs to be
aligned between HTTP message sender and HTTP message receiver, i.e., mandatory
to support algorithms need to be specified in a 3GPP profile. This option
provides more crypto agility and is better aligned with JWT and JWS. For ease
of implementation in initial deployments, the 3GPP profile for the hash
algorithm could mandate the usage of a specific hash function, e.g., SHA256.
This is similar to the JOSE profile of PRINS as specified in TS 33.501 [2],
clause 13.2.4.9, which specifies the usage of specific AEAD and signature
algorithms, but still provides crypto agility if changes should be necessary
in the future.
### 6.5.3 Evaluation
This solution provides an approach how an NF Service Producer can verify that
a service request of the NF Service Consumer received via SCP has not been
modified.
This solution extends Client credentials assertion to include hash value of
HTTP body and HTTP methods.
This solution does not handle integrity protection of HTTP headers.
## 6.6 Solution #6: Verification of Service Response from a NF Service
Producer at the expected NF Set
### 6.6.1 Introduction {#introduction-9}
This solution addresses key issue #1. It extends solution #1. In order to
verify the message from NF Service Producer in indirect communication, it is
proposed to append CCA of NFp. An NF Service Consumer may accept the
certificate if it is verified well and NF Service Producer instances belongs
to the expected NF Service Producer instance(s).
### 6.6.2 Solution details
#### 6.6.2.1 For indirect communication without delegated discovery procedure
Figure 6.6.2.1-1: With mutual authentication between NF and NRF at the
transport layer
**Discovery of the NF Service Producer:**
0\. When a NF Service Consumer discover a NF Service Producer for a service,
NRF provides information of target NF set and candidate target NF instance IDs
belonging to the target NF set.
The NF set information in the discovery response from NRF to NF Service
Consumer needs to be end-to-end integrity protected, by, e.g., TLS or solution
to Key Issue #5, so that the SCP cannot modify the NF set information in the
discovery response.
**NF Service Consumer authorization:**
**1-2. After** mutual authentication between NF Service Consumer and NRF at
the transport layer**,** the NF Service Consumer and NRF perform the \"Access
token request before service access\" procedure. If the NF Service Consumer
has already discovered the NF Service Producer, it can also perform the
\"Access token request for a specific NF Service Producer/NF Service Producer
instance\" procedure.
**Service Request:**
4\. Among the candidates NF instances list, the NF Service Consumer may select
an NF instance for a Service Request. And the NF Service Consumer keep the
list of candidate NF instances and NF set for verification of expected Service
Response.
After acquiring an access token from the NRF, a NF Service Consumer may send a
Service Request to the SCP. The service request includes the access token and
CCA of the NF Service Consumer.
The service request includes the 3gpp-Sbi-Routing-Binding header and/or 3gpp-
Sbi-Discovery header in order to specify target NF Service Producer and/or
target NF Set, so that the SCP is instructed to perform the NFp reselection
within the scope of NF Set.
5\. An SCP forward a Service Request to the NF Service Producer. If needed,
the SCP may reselect another NF Service Producer belonging to the same NF Set.
**Service Response:**
6-7. After receiving a Service Request, the NF Service Producer may verify the
Service Request and may respond with a Service Response with CCA of the NF
Service Producer. CCA of NF Service Producer includes NF instance ID of NF
Service Producer and NF instance ID of NF Service Consumer.
8-9. When receiving a Service Response, the NF Service Consumer may verify
whether the NF instances ID of NF Service Producer which sends the Service
Response is in the list of candidate NF instances for the Service Request.
#### 6.6.2.2 For indirect communication with delegated discovery
Figure 6.6.2.2-1: for indirect communication with delegated discovery
1\. The NF Service Consumer sends a service request to the SCP. The service
request shall include NF service discovery factors such as target NF type and
the NF Service Consumer\'s CCA as defined in clause 13.3.8.
2\. The SCP may perform a NF discovery operation with the NRF using NF service
discovery factors received in step 1.
3\. (same with step 3 in subclause 13.4.1.3.2 TS 33.501 [2]). The SCP sends an
access token request (Nnrf_AccessToken_Get Request) to the NRF. The access
token request includes parameters as defined in clause 13.4.1.1. The access
token request may include the NF Service Consumer\'s CCA if received in Step
1.
4\. (same with step 4 in subclause 13.4.1.3.2 TS 33.501 [2]). The NRF
authenticates the NF Service Consumer using one of the methods described in
clause 13.3.1.2. If NF Service Consumer authentication is successful and the
NF Service Consumer is authorized based on the NRF policy, the NRF issues an
access token as described in clause 13.4.1.1. The NRF uses the NF Service
Consumer instance ID as the subject of the access token.
5\. (same with step 5 in subclause 13.4.1.3.2 TS 33.501 [2]). The NRF sends
the access token to the SCP in an access token response (Nnrf_AccessToken_Get
Response).
6\. (same with step 6 in subclause 13.4.1.3.2 TS 33.501 [2]). The SCP sends
the service request to the NF Service Producer. The service request includes
an access token (i.e., received in Step 1, received in Step 5, or previously
cached), and may include the NF Service Consumer\'s CCA if received in Step 1.
7\. (same with step 7 in subclause 13.4.1.3.2 TS 33.501 [2]). The NF Service
Producer authenticates the NF Service Consumer by one of the methods described
in clause 13.3.2.2 and if successful, it validates the access token as
described in clause 13.4.1.1.
8\. If the validation of the access token is successful, the NF Service
Producer may respond with a Service Response with CCA of the NF Service
Producer. CCA of NF Service Producer may include NF type and NF instance ID of
NF Service Producer and NF instance ID of NF Service Consumer.
9\. The SCP forwards the service response to the NF Service Consumer. The SCP
may include the access token in the service response to NF Service Consumer
for possible re-use in subsequent service requests.
10\. When receiving a service response, the NF Service Consumer may verify
whether the NF Service Producer belongs to the target NF type and authenticate
NF Service Producer using CCA and X.509 certificate of the NF Service
Producer, and may verify whether the CCA of the NF Service Consumer in the CCA
of NF Service Producer is the same with the CCA of the NF Service Consumer
sent in Step 1.
#### 6.6.2.3 Client credentials assertion of NF Service Producer
CCAs shall be JSON Web Tokens as described in RFC 7519 [15] and are secured
with digital signatures based on JSON Web Signature (JWS) as described in RFC
7515 [16].
The CCA of NF Service Producer may include:
\- the NF instance ID of the NF Service Producer;
\- the NF set information of the NF Service Producer;
\- the NF instance ID of the NF Service Consumer;
\- The NF type of the NF Service Producer;
\- The CCA of the NF Service Consumer received in the service request message;
\- A timestamp and an expiration time.
The NF Service Consumer digitally signs the generated CCA based on its private
key as described in RFC 7515 [16]. T _he signed CCA includes one of the
following fields:_
\- the X.509 URL (x5u) to refer to a resource for the X.509 public key
certificate or certificate chain used for signing the client authentication
assertion, or
\- the X.509 Certificate Chain (x5c) include the X.509 public key certificate
or certificate chain used for signing the client authentication assertion.
### 6.6.3 Evaluation
This solution provides an approach how an NF Service Consumer can authenticate
NF Service Producer, from which NF Service Consumer receives a service
response, as intended NF for Service Response in indirect communication
without delegated discovery and with delegated discovery.
This solution introduces Client credentials assertion or a token alike also
for the NF Service Producer. The assertion includes NFp Instance ID, NFc
Instance ID, and a signature using the certificate of NFp.
In indirect communication without delegated discovery, by reusing existing
HTTP custom headers, it can also cover the case when SCP reselect another NF
as NF Service Producer.
This solution works with assumption that the discovery results from NRF to NF
Service Consumer are protected to detect any harmful modification in the
middle. And it also assumes that NRF will inform NF Service Consumer about
which NF Service Producers are in the NF Set and that SCP only re-selects
another NF Service Producer within the NF Set.
NFc can only trust NFp if there has been a direct possibility to verify NFp\'s
authenticity. This is done by proposing an assertion token (such as CCA) to be
also used by NFp.
In indirect communication with delegated discovery, this solution requires
extension of CCA and/or X.509 Certificate of NF Service Producer to include NF
type of NF Service Producer.
This solution is to address KI#1 which basically assumes that the SCP and NFp
are compromised or at least the SCP is compromised. If that the threat this
solution is trying to address, thus the proposed solution only prevents such
attack in the case when NF and NRF are mutually authenticated using TLS over
direct communication without SCP being present. This means this solution does
not address KI#1 in the following cases:
\- Delegated Discovery, Model D,
\- Model C when the NF Service Consumer communicates with NRF over indirect
communication via SCP.
## 6.7 Solution #7: Access token request for NF Set
### 6.7.1 Introduction {#introduction-10}
This solution addresses KI#6.
3GPP introduces the concepts of NF Set and NF Service Set which allows
essentially for a group of interchangeable NF instances/NF Service instances
of the same type, supporting the same services and the same **Network
Slice(s)**. Rel-16 also allows re-selection of a NF instance or a NF Service
instance within the Set for subsequent transaction.
5G SBA architecture design allows for the concept of stateless NFs.
To support the NF Set concept, i.e., a group of interchangeable NF instances
or NF Service instances providing the same service, the context needs to be
accessible to all NFs of the set.
The solution addresses NF Sets or NF Service Sets on the consumer side. It
assumes that each NF Service Consumer of a set is known at NRF also with its
NF Set ID or the NF Service Set ID. Thus, verification of the correctness of a
set id is done when authenticating the NF Service Consumer as OAuth 2.0 client
when registering at NRF. Thus, if NRF is then issuing an access token with a
distinct set id related to the NF Service Consumer\'s NF Set IF or NF Service
Set ID, the NF Service Producer can trust the correctness, or do another
verification, if the set id is also included in CCA or NF certificate.
A NF Service Producer can also indicate in its profile, if it is allowing the
NRF to provide access tokens for NF Sets or NF Service Sets.
NOTE 1: Whether to have this feature allowed per operator policy configured at
NRF or per NF Service Producer or NF Service Producer Set is a deployment
decision.
The solutions objective is to avoid that a NF from a NF Set needs to request a
new access token, when targeting a service of an existing resource requested
before by another NF of the NF Set, it is proposed that any NF in a NF Set can
request an access token for the NF Set. Thus, any NF Service Consumer
targeting a service of an existing resource it can use the access token
provided to a NF Set of NF Service Consumers. All NFs of a NF Set need to
retrieve the current status from the same place to allow for the same access
token to be used by different NFs of the set.
NOTE 2: For any NF to make use of this solution, that NF is required to
register its profile with the NRF.
### 6.7.2 Solution details
The NF Service Consumer belonging to a NF Set, it includes its NF Set ID in
the Access Token Request message to NRF and also in the CCA or the NF
certificate.
When the Access Token Request is processed by the NRF and a NF Set ID is
included, the NRF knows that the NF Service Consumer requests an access token
to be useable by all NF Service Consumer instances within the NF Set. If NRF
authorization of the NF Service Consumer is successful, i.e., the NF Service
Producer has indicated that an access token for a NF Set or NF Service Set can
be issued, and the NF Set ID in the CCA matches the NF Set ID in the access
token or in the NF certificate, NRF includes as claim the NF Set ID of the
expected NF Service Consumer instances to allow the access token generated for
usage by all NF Service Consumers in the NF Set. NRF sends the access token
back to the requester. The request needs to put the context information of
such common token at a place from which all NFs of the NF Set can retrieve it.
Figure 6.7.2-1: Access Token Request procedure (TS 33.501 Figure 13.4.1.1.1-1)
**enhanced with NF Set ID** in the Access Token Request message
How NFs of a NF Set or a NF Service Set manage the distribution of an access
token issued for set or service set and their availability to other NFs within
the NF Set, is for implementation and out of scope.
When a service is requested, the requester (NF Service Consumer or SCP)
includes the NF Set ID of the NF Service Consumer in the Service API Request,
as well as in the CCA, if the CCA is sent, in addition to the access token
obtained from the NRF. NF Set ID in CCA is only reliable if the NF Set ID is
included in the certificate related to the private key that the NF Service
Consumer used to sign the CCA.
The NF Service Producer checks whether the Consumer NF Set Id in the Service
Request matches with the NF Set ID claim in the Access token. If CCA is sent,
it also verifies, if the NF Set ID matches the NF Set ID in the CCA. If
included in NF certificate, it can also match the NF Set ID with the NF Set ID
in the NF certificate. If yes, it proceeds with serving the request, otherwise
it rejects the request.
There is always one NF representing a set at a given time. Only one NF of the
NF Set or NF Service Set shall be able to use the access token issued for a
set at a given time. The management of which NF within the set is currently
the leader and using the OAuth token is for implementation and out of scope of
the present document.
### 6.7.3 Evaluation
The solution proposed allows the authorization server, i.e., NRF, to issue an
access token that can be used by all members of an NF Set or NF Service Set.
The concept of NF Set and NF Service Set has been introduced by 3GPP. This
solution enables optimization that is sought from the mutual redundancy among
the NF instances of the set. It would be less optimized if each instance needs
to request its own token.
Using the same access token for a NF Service Consumers belonging to one NF Set
is not explicitly described by RFC 6749 [17]. Other literature mentions group
access tokens, but further investigation on the impact managing an access
token used by NF Service Consumers of the same set is needed.
According to RFC 6749 [17], each NF instances needs to register with the
authorization server (NRF) as a separate OAuth2.0 client before the
authorization server is able to issue such a token which can be used by all
members of the NF Set.
Since CCA is used for Indirect communications when SCP in the path between the
NF Service Consumer and the NF Service Producer, including NF Set ID and/or NF
Service Set ID into the CCA only work for the case of indirect communication
but not in the direct communication case.
Including NF Set ID in the NF certificate is not a flexible mechanism which
requires an intervention in case of the NF instance is removed from a specific
NF set ID and/or NF service set ID or added to another NF Set ID or NF Service
Set ID. On the other hand, if any of these operations are done to any NF
instance, the NF instance will update its profile with the NRF automatically
and the update is almost dynamic for the rest of the processes.
This solution requires that in case of any change to the list of members of
the NF Set, all existing access token with the impacted NF Set ID and/or NF
Service Set ID should be destroyed and not used. A new access token is
required.
Since NF Service Producers can indicate in their profile allowedxxx IEs,
configuration effort is necessary so that they are consistent with the NF
Sets.
This solution requires each NF Service Consumer to register its profile and
maintains it always updated at all the time with the NRF.
The usage of an access token consumed from a single NF Service Consumer
instance by any NF of a NF Set of Service Producers is allowed per 3GPP
specification (first case). The solution described in this clause is about
Service Consumers of a NF Set to be able to use the same token for consuming a
service from a NF Service Producer. From a security perspective, having an
access token issued for a specific NF Service Consumer that authorizes a
single NF Service Consumer instance to consume a service from any NF Service
Producers of an NF set of is quite different than having a single access token
issued for a group of NF Service Consumers belonging to the same NF Set to
consume a service from a specific NF Service Producer or a NF Set of Service
Producers.
In the first case, only one NF Service Producer of the NF Set receives the
access token at a time to validate the NF Service Consumer instance whether it
is allowed to receive the service or not. Each NF Service Producer will have
the ability to validate whether the NF Service Consumer instance was
authorized or not via the access token validation process. There is no
security risk in this scenario as the access token is issued to authorize a
single entity, the NF Service Consumer instance. It is important to note that
the NF Service Producer is NOT required to maintain or save the access token.
In the case described by this solution, i.e., a set of NF Service Consumers
sharing the same access token, additional access token management is needed.
Otherwise the access token may end up being saved at multiple places rather
than one which causes a security risk. In addition, the access token does not
reflect the identity of the NF Service Consumer instance that is requesting
access to the service resource at the NF Service Producer and this way the NF
Service Producer is not able to validate whether the NF Service Consumer
instance requesting the service is authorized to receive service or not.
In comparison, that is why no certificate is issued for multiple entities to
be used by a group of entities, e.g., NF Service Consumer set to be used to
blindly authenticate a member of the group.
## 6.8 Solution #8: Integrity protection of HTTP message in consideration of
update by SCP
### 6.8.1 Introduction {#introduction-11}
This solution addresses key issue #5.
It is proposed to use enhance CCA to include hash value of HTTP headers and
HTTP body.
In the enhanced CCA, hash value of HTTP headers and hash value of HTTP body
are included, separately.
For calculation of hash value of HTTP headers, Via and Authorization headers
are not included.
There should be a rule for ordering HTTP headers. HTTP standard headers come
first and HTTP custom headers come after HTTP standard headers. Among HTTP
custom headers from NF Service Consumer or NF Service Producer, 3GPP-Sbi-
Client-Credentials header should be positioned as the last once. When an SCP
add HTTP custom headers, those should come after 3GPP-Sbi-Client-Credentials
header from NF Service Consumer of NF Service Producer.
When NF Service Consumer of NF Service Producer receive an HTTP message, they
compute the hash value of HTTP headers and HTTP body and compare those with
the values in CCA for checking of integrity protection.
Figure 6.8.1-1: HTTP message with hash value in CCA for end to end message
protection
### 6.8.2 Solution Details
This solution enables the NF Service Producer and NF Service Consumer to
verify a HTTP message received via SCP has not been modified.
NF Service Consumer calculate hash value of HTTP standard headers except
Authenticate header and HTTP custom headers and hash value of HTTP body and
include in the CCA.
NF Service Consumer append CCA as the last of HTTP custom headers.
For this, the CCA is enhanced with additional payload values.
\- hash value of HTTP headers including HTTP standard headers and HTTP custom
headers generated by originating Network Function.
\- hash value of HTTP body generated by originating Network Function.
After SCP receives HTTP message from NF Service Consumer, it may append Via
header and Authenticate header (only for delegated discovery case) and some
HTTP custom headers after HTTP standard headers and HTTP custom headers at the
received HTTP message, respectively.
NF Service Producer verify hash value of HTTP standard headers and HTTP
extended headers except Via header, Authorization header and HTTP custom
headers appended by SCP and hash value of HTTP body by comparing the
calculated value and the ones in CCA.
Similarly, NF Service Producer can calculate hash value of HTTP standard
headers and HTTP custom headers and hash value of HTTP body and include in the
CCA if CCA is used.
After SCP receives HTTP message from NF Service Producer, it may append Via
header and some HTTP custom headers after HTTP standard headers and HTTP
custom headers at the received HTTP message, respectively.
NF Service Consumer can verify hash value of HTTP standard headers and HTTP
extended headers except Via header and HTTP custom headers appended by SCP and
hash value of HTTP body by comparing the calculated value and the ones in CCA.
### 6.8.3 Evaluation
This solution provides an approach how an NF Service Producer can verify that
a service request of the NF Service Consumer received via SCP has not been
modified.
This solution extends Client credentials assertion to include hash value of
HTTP headers and HTTP body.
This solution proposes a rule how to compose the HTTP headers and how to
calculate hash value of a HTTP message and it allows NF Service Producer to
calculate hash value of HTTP headers without any extra information.
This solution provides how to calculate hash value of HTTP headers and HTTP
body even though SCP modify HTTP messages in NF Service Producer. And when SCP
modifies illegally a HTTP message, NF Service Producer can detect it.
NOTE: Whether a token similarly to CCA is used for NF Service Producer
authentication is per decision of key issue #1.
## 6.9 Solution #9: Authorization mechanism negotiation
### 6.9.1 Introduction {#introduction-12}
This solution addresses Key Issue #7 \"Authorization mechanism negotiation\".
It is proposed to use the two NRFs for the authorization mechanism
negotiation.
### 6.9.2 Solution details
Figure 6.9.2-1: Authorization mechanism negotiation
Pre-requisite:
\- the vPLMN and hPLMN support at least static authorization dependent on the
roaming partner.
1\. The NF Service Consumer sends a discovery request to the vNRF.
2\. The vNRF sends a discovery request to the hNRF. In addition to the
discovery request from the NFc, the vNRF add the vPLMN authorization
Capability into the discovery request. The vPLMN authorization Capability
indicates the supported authorization mechanisms, i.e., static, OAuth, or
Both.
3\. The hNRF selects the Final authorization mechanism supported by both the
received vPLMN authorization Capability and the hPLMN authorization
Capability. The hPLMN, i.e., all NF Service Producers of the hPLMN that handle
service requests from other PLMN, need to support at least static
authorization. In this way, the hNRF can always select an authorization method
that is supported by both the vPLMN and the hPLMN.
NOTE: The Final authorization mechanism selected by hNRF depends on the
operator.
4-5. The hNRF sends the Final authorization mechanism to the NFc.
Then, if the Final authorization mechanism indicates static authorization,
then the NFc could use the static authorization to access the NFp service. If
the Final authorization mechanism indicates OAuth authorization, then the NFc
could get the token from the NRF before consuming the service from the NFp.
### 6.9.3 Evaluation
This solution addresses the threats and requirements of Key issue #7:
\"Authorization mechanism negotiation\".
The pre-requisite is that the hPLMN supports at least static authorization.
This solution addresses for the inter-PLMN scenario the use case that the
vPLMN has only implemented static authorization. The NF Service Producer needs
to support whichever authorization mechanism is determined by the hNRF, i.e.,
using different authorization mechanisms depending on the roaming partner.
In the solution proposed, the VPLMN supporting static authorization only could
enforce the HPLMN to overcome the mandated support for OAuth. I.e., to demand
static authorization by only providing this specific capability to the roaming
partner.
## 6.10 Solution #10: NRF deployment clarifications
### 6.10.1 Introduction {#introduction-13}
This solution addresses key issue #8. It provides clarification of handling
access token requests in different NRF deployment scenarios.
### 6.10.2 Solution details
There are different deployment options for NRFs, as described in TS 23.501 [3]
(see clause 5.15.5).
The NF Service Consumer may have discovered a specific NRF in advance, e.g., a
slice specific NRF, and can send its request directly to this specific NRF. In
this case, if the specific NRF is not the NF Service Consumer\'s local NRF,
the authorization server part of this NRF does not have a record of this NF
Service Consumer\'s OAuth 2.0 client registration, when information about the
NF Service Consumer instance and its NF Type is made available in the OAuth
2.0 Authorization server, i.e., the slice specific NRF.
This registration process is subject to implementation procedures of the
operator, with the following consideration on authentication procedure: OAuth
2.0 clients are capable to authenticate securely with the authorization
server, i.e., client type as specified in RFC 6749 [17] is \"confidential\".
If the NF Service Consumer requests an NRF, where the NF Service Producer is
not registered (see NRF deployment options), the requested NRF needs to
redirect/forward the service request to that NRF.
In a local NRF deployment, the NF Service Producer only gets the certificate
of its local NRF. Thus, the local NRF of the NF Service Producer would need to
trust the forwarding NRF that has authenticated the NF Service Consumer before
the local NRF be able to authorize the NF Service Consumer.
### 6.10.3 Evaluation
The solution proposes that information about the consumer instance and its
type is made available in the slice specific NRF. This is technically
possible, potentially quite complicated. It is applied to an optimization in
TS 23.501on a slicing-related procedure. Whether the procedure with this
addition is still an optimization, would need further evaluation.
This proposal requires pre-configuration of the slice-specific NRF for solving
a very specific issue of an optimization in TS 23.501 [3] on a slicing-related
procedure.
## 6.11 Solution #11: Registered NF Profile changes for Inter-Slice Access
### 6.11.1 Introduction {#introduction-14}
This solution proposes to address following security requirement of KI #9:
\- The 5GS should provide a mechanism that allows the NF Service Producer not
to provide service to NF Service Consumers, which are not authorized to access
a slice.
This solution gives the option for NF Service Producers to indicate which
consumer\'s S-NSSAIs are allowed to access which producer\'s S-NSSAIs, and by
which operations in its profile.
### 6.11.1 Solution Details
Using individual or combination of IEs like _allowedNfTypes_ and
_allowedNssais,_ NRF can already filter the requests from NF Service Consumers
not allowed to access any services of an NF Service Producer.
To address the issue of static configurations at NRF for restricted Inter-
slice access, it is proposed that:
\- When an NF Service Producer registers its profile in NRF, it includes a new
information element, \"_allowedSnssaisPerSnssai_ \", which specifies, for each
NF-Service Consumer\'s S-NSSAI, the list of NF-Service Producer\'s S-NSSAIs it
is allowed to access.
\- When an NF Service Producer registers its profile in NRF, it includes a new
information element, \"_allowedOperationsPerSnssai_ \", which specifies
allowed operations on its resources, for NF Service Consumers belonging to the
given S-NSSAI.
These attributes can then be used by NRF to determine the
\"producerSnssaiList\" to be included in the AccessTokenClaims. Additionally,
NRF can determine whether a given resource/operation-level scope can be
granted to an NF Service Consumer that requested an OAuth 2.0 access token
with a specific scope, or limit the scope or authorization irrespective of the
request.
Additionally, to allow NF Service Producers (themselves) validate the \"Inter-
Slice\" access requests from the NF Service consumers, it is proposed to
include \"Requester-NSSAI\" in the access-grant, indicating the NRF validated
NF-Consumer\'s S-NSSAIs.
The NF Service Producer can thus check the decision of the NRF to assign an
access token, but is still dependent on the NRF validating the consumer\'s
S-NSSAI and including it in the access token.
### 6.11.3 Evaluation
This solution proposes to address the following security requirement of KI #9:
The 5GS should provide a mechanism that allows the NF Service Producer not to
provide service to NF Service Consumers, which are not authorized to access a
slice.
1\. Finer granularity for NF Service Producer\'s profile:
The solution gives the option for NF Service Producers to indicate which
consumer\'s S-NSSAIs are allowed to access which producer\'s S-NSSAIs, and by
which operations, in its profile.
2\. NFp authorizing NF Service Consumer\'s S-NSSAI:
In this solution, the NF Service Producer is still dependent on NRF to include
the validated S-NSSAIs, how NRF validates the NF Service Consumers is not
covered in this solution.
## 6.12 Solution #12: Authorization of notification endpoint in \"Subscribe-
Notify\" scenarios
### 6.12.1 Introduction {#introduction-15}
This solution addresses key issue #3: Service access authorization in the
\"Subscribe-Notify\" scenarios by including \"notification URI\" in the token
request.
This solution proposes to include \"notification URI\" and CCA of the NF which
owns the \"notification URI\" at the access token request. The NRF verifies
whether the notification URI is authorized to receive the service/notification
that is requested in the access token request.
### 6.12.2 Solution details
During access token request process, NF Service Consumer include
\"notification URI\" in Nnrf_Access Token_Get Request when operation semantics
of the requested service type is \"Subscribe/Notify\". NRF may verify whether
the notification URI in the access token request match the corresponding
information in the public key certificate of the NF Service Consumer or those
in the NF profile of the NF Service Consumer. In addition, when \"notification
URI\"(s) are included in the access token request, NRF may verify whether the
\"notification URI\"(s) locate its location(s) with the same address(es) which
are indicated by its own FQDN or IP address as registered in NRF. The NRF
checks whether the NF Service Consumer is authorized to access the requested
service(s).
When the NF Service Consumer is authorized, the NRF shall then generate an
access token with appropriate claims which may include \"notification URI\" as
requested by NF Service Consumer.
Figure 6.12.2-1: Access token request for \"Subscribe-Notify\" NF Service
illustration 1
A NF Service Consumer (NF_A) may request to subscribe to NF Service offered by
a NF Service Producer (NF_B) on behalf of NF_C according to the Service
Request from NF_C (e.g., Figure 4.15.3.2.2-1: Nudm_EventExposure_Subscribe,
Unsubscribe and Notify operation in TS 23.502[7]).
The Figure 6.12.2-2 describe the solution to verify the service request from
NF_A including Notification URI of NF_C.
Figure 6.12.2-2: Access token request for \"Subscribe-Notify\" NF Service
illustration 2
Step 0. The NF_C sends a Service Request to the NF_A for notification service
on an event with an access token including notification URI and CCA of the
NF_C.
Step 1. The NF_A decides to subscribe a service of the NF_B associated to the
Service Request received at step 0 and sends an Access Token Request to the
NRF for a Service Request toward the NF_B including notification URI and CCA
of the NF_C.
Step 2. The NRF verifies whether the NF_A is authorized and whether the NF_C
identified by the appended CCA is a valid Network Function and authorized to
receive the requested NF Service from the NF_B. NRF may verify whether the
notification URI in the access token request match the corresponding
information in the public key certificate of the NF_C of the CCA of the NF_C,
or those in the NF profile of the NF_C.
Step 3. Upon successful verification, the NRF publishes an access token for a
Service Request of the NF_A toward the NF_B. The access token includes
notification URI of the NF_C in the claims as requested in step 2.
Step 4. The NF_A sends a Service Request for a notification service toward
NF_B including the access token received at step 3 and CCA of the NF_A.
Step 5. The NF_B verifies the access token and CCA of the NF_A. During the
verification, the NF_B can check whether notification URI in the Service
Request are included in the access token. If the verification is successful,
the NF_B may respond the NF_A and provide the NF_C with the notification
service as requested by the NF_A. In case of notification target reselection
as described in clause 6.3.1.0 of TS 23.501[3], binding can be used to
indicate suitable NFs other than NF_C (see TS 23.501 [3], Table 6.3.1.0-1 on
binding, selection and reselection).
### 6.12.3 Evaluation
The solution extends the existing token-based authorization method by
including the notification URI of the NF_C in the token claims.
The token is used to indicate towards NF_B (the producer and sender of the
notification) that NF_C (the notification receiver) authorizes NF_A (the
subscriber) to subscribe services on behalf of NF_C (the notification
receiver). The token is also used to indicate towards NF_B (the producer and
sender of the notification) that the NRF authorizes the notification URI
contained in the token to receive notifications from NF_B.
The solution has impact on the access token generation by adding the
notification URI of the NF_C into the access token, and token verification.
Further evaluation would be necessary. The solution does not address the case
of notification target reselection as described in clause 6.3.1.0 of TS 23.501
[3].
## 6.13 Solution #13: Authentication of NF Service Producer in Indirect
Communication
### 6.13.1 Introduction {#introduction-16}
This solution addresses KI#1.
This solution proposes a simple authentication procedure which allows an NF
Service Consumer or any other entity (e.g., a delegated SCP) to authenticate
an NF Service Producer before sending an actual service request. This ensures
that an actual service request with request parameters, some of which may be
sensitive (e.g., SUPI), is only sent to an NF Service Producer that has
already been authenticated.
This property is consistent with the behaviour of HTTPS/TLS in which a client
certificate with client information is sent to the server only after the
authentication of a server certificate, and an HTTPS request is sent to the
server only after the authentication of the server in TLS.
The procedure can be executed by an NF Service Consumer or by an SCP which has
been delegated by an NF Service Consumer to perform service discovery and re-
selection on its behalf.
### 6.13.2 Solution details
A Client (e.g., an NF Service Consumer) first performs the service discovery
to obtain information about an NF Service Producer (e.g., NF Service Producer
Instance ID). Before the Client sends a service request to the NF Service
Producer, it performs the following procedure to obtain a Server Credentials
Assertion (SCA) from the producer. Similar to CCA, which allows to verify the
identity of a consumer, SCA allows to verify the identity of the producer.
This procedure can be performed by an NF Service Consumer to verify the
identity of an NRF or an NF Service Producer. For example, it can be performed
to verify the identity of an NRF before an NF Service Consumer sends an access
token request to an NRF.
In delegated discovery, this procedure can be performed by an NF Service
Consumer before sending an actual service request. This procedure will trigger
the SCP to perform the first service discovery and eventually return the SCA
to the NF Service Consumer. Alternatively, if a delegated SCP is trusted by an
NF Service Consumer to verify the identity of an NF Service Producer, an SCP
will perform this procedure on the behalf of NF Service Consumer to verify the
identity of an NF Service Producer before it forwards a service request from
an NF Service Consumer to the NF Service Producer.
When a re-selection of an NF Service Producer is performed, this procedure can
be re-performed against the newly selected NF Service Producer. If reselection
by the SCP is a desired feature, the SCP also needs to be trusted, because the
NF Service Consumer cannot distinguish whether the SCP is acting maliciously
or as wanted.

Figure 6.13.2-1: Authentication Procedure for NF Service Producer in Indirect
Communication
1\. A client (e.g., an NF Service Consumer or an SCP) sends an HTTP request to
a server (e.g., an NRF or an NF serviced producer) to obtain its Server
Credentials Assertion (SCA). This HTTP request can be a simple HTTP Get
request to a well-known resource (e.g., /SCA) or a service request (e.g.,
NFp_SCA_Get_Request) without any requesting parameter. This ensures that no
client information is exposed to the server in such request.
2\. The SCP forwards the request (NFp_SCA_Get_Request, or HTTP Get) from the
Client to the Server.
3\. The Server (e.g. an NRF or an NF Service Producer) receives the request
and generates Server Credential Assertion (SCA). The SCA has the same format
as CCA and includes the identity of the server (e.g., NF Service Producer
instance ID) and associated proof, which allows the verification of the server
identity.
4\. The Server sends the SCA in the response (e.g., NFp_SCA_Get_Response or
HTTP response) back to the SCP. The response may include an indicator to
request for the CCA from the Client.
5\. The SCP forwards the response including the SCA back to the Client.
6\. The Client verifies the SCA cryptographically and then verifies the server
identity (e.g., NF Service Producer Instance ID) in the SCA against the
corresponding identity of server where a service request is to be sent.
### 6.13.3 Evaluation
_This solution allows a NF Service Consumer to identify the NRF or NF Service
Producer. However, only in limited cases the procedure successfully addresses
the threats and requirement, i.e., only in the cases when the consumer
discovers the producer itself and if the SCP is not reselecting the producer
afterwards._
_When discovery is delegated to the SCP or the SCP is doing a reselection of
the producer, then the SCP needs to be trusted, which is not in line with key
issue threat assumption of a misbehaving SCP._
## 6.14 Solution #14: SCP trust domain or technical domain grouping
### 6.14.1 Introduction {#introduction-17}
This solution is addressing key issue #2. It provides an optimization for SCP
domain operation in trusted environments.
### 6.14.2 Solution details
According to TS 23.502 [7], SCP domains can be registered at the NRF. A NF
Service Producer can register within its profile its SCP domain.
_A SCP domain is called trusted if it is a group or subset of available SCPs
within one PLMN that includes several SCPs operated in the same trust
environment according to a security policy._ Such technical SCP trust domains
can be defined in large PLMNs, for example, based on computer centre
boundaries, operators of subnetworks, regions/provinces, etc.
_SCP trust domains could also be formed equipment-specific or release-
specific._ Large operators could have involved different organizations to
operate the complete network and hence, structure their regional availability
by SCP domains, where additional security means between these organizations
could be needed for achieving trust.
For a SCP trust domain, one or several SCP domains can be grouped, i.e., a SCP
trust domain is a superset of a distinct set of SCP domains. A SCP trust
domain could be isolated from other SCP domains. It could be registered or
configured together with a set of policies at NRF.
If the SCP is part of several SCP domains, all SCP domains have to be part of
the same SCP trust domain as illustrated in the figure below.
{width="6.69375in" height="3.765277777777778in"}
Figure 6.14.2-1: Illustration of SCP trust domain
SCPs can discover boundaries of trust or technical domains based on:
\- the SCP domain, from which a request is received from and is forwarded to,
and
\- the configured knowledge of the relationship of trust or technical domains
and SCP domains.
Policies for a SCP trust domain could include information such as which domain
can communicate with which domain or whether NFs from one SCP trust domain can
access NFs of another SCP trust domain.
The policies are related to restriction in the communication between trust
domains that the SCP enforces, as outlined in the examples below.
Some examples of policies for a SCP trust domain are as follows:
\- Only SCPs from a particular (usually the same) SCP trust domain would be
allowed to discover the NF Service Producer.
\- An access token could be provided for all NFs of the same SCP trust domain.
\- A service is provided only for NFs of a distinct NF Type within a specific
SCP trust domain.
\- The SCP domain of NF Service Consumer and SCP are the same as of the NF
Service Producer.
\- Access to certain services is not permitted over trust domain boundaries.
If the SCP discovers that a request message traverses a boundary between
trust/technical domain, it can perform also policing on traffic between SCP
trust domains, for example:
\- Checking target URIs
\- Checking delegated discovery parameters
\- Checking routing binding indications
\- Checking whether a request contains a CCA
The following are examples of using SCP trust domains:
\- The access from NF or SCP to the SCPs of a SCP trust domain can be limited
to this domain only. Hence, all SCPs forming a trust domain could be allowed
to communicate with NRF and with NF Service Producers on behalf of a NF
Service Consumer from the same trust domain. By this, SCPs forwarding a
request to another SCP, e.g., for load balancing, have a mean to check whether
the forwarding SCP is a member of the same SCP trust domain.
\- If a policy for SCP trust domain is registered and the NF profile includes
SCP trust domain information in the NRF, the NRF can authorize or reject a
discovery request from NF or SCP based on whether the expected NF Service
Producer or another SCP instance is part of the same SCP trust domain as the
NF Service Consumer.
\- If a NF Service Consumer has included in its request a target SCP trust
domain, the NRF can provide an access token that provides authorization for
all NFs within this domain.
\- If the NF Service Producer receives a service request, it could provide the
service only, when contacted by an SCP of the trust domain indicated in the
access token (e.g., AMF getting a token from NRF granting access to any SMF in
the same SCP domain).
\- If domain information of the NF Service Consumer is included in the token,
it enables the NF Service Producer or SCP to verify whether the requesting NF
Service Consumer is part of the same SCP trust domain.
SCPs of a trust domain connecting to another SCP domain outside the trust
domain shall provide confidentiality, integrity and replay protection.
### 6.14.3 Evaluation
The solution addresses SCP domains. Trust domains do not need to be
necessarily identical to SCP domains. Restricting network topology so that
requests between certain elements are not allowed could be generalized as
provided by the potential security requirement in clause 5.2.3.
Further evaluation is needed for deciding on the usefulness of the concept in
general, such as addressing the moving of UEs between regions with different
trust requirements.
## 6.15 Solution #15: Authorization mechanism for the involved NFs in the
delegated \"Subscribe-Notify\" scenario.
### 6.15.1 Introduction {#introduction-18}
This solution addresses KI#3 on how to assure that the notification messages
could be only forwarded to an authorized NF identified by its NF instance ID
in the delegated \"Subscribe-Notify\" scenarios. This solution does not
address authorization of the notification URI.
The solution is based on the authorization of NF Service Consumers for data
access via DCCF specified in Annex X.2 of TS 33.501 [2]. It proposes to
include two instance IDs in the access token request, allowing the NRF to
check whether one NF (e.g., NF_C) is authorized to subscription and whether
another NF (e.g. NF_A) as the proxy is allowed to request the service from the
identified NF Service Producer on behalf the NF_C. The NF Service Producer
verifies the access token is valid according to these instance IDs. After
successful verification, the NF Service Producer should provide the
notification service.
### 6.15.2 Solution details
In the \"Subscribe-Notify\" NF service illustration 2 (delegated scenario)
specified in TS 23.501 [3], clause 7.1.2, an NF Service Consumer (e.g. NF_C)
may subscribe the service of an NF Service Producer (e.g., NF_B) on behalf of
another NF Service Consumer (e.g. NF_A).
The Figure 6.15.2-1 describes the detailed solution for authorization
mechanism for the involved NFs in the delegated \"Subscribe-Notify\"
scenarios.
Figure 6.15.2-1: Authorization mechanism for the involved NFs in the delegated
\"Subscribe-Notify\" scenario
1) The NF_A decides to subscribe the service of NF Service Producer (e.g.
NF_B) on behalf of NF_C and gets an access token from the NRF for a Service
Request toward the NF_A. The NF_C initiates an NF service request to the NF_A
which includes the notification URI, the access_token_NF_C and the CCA of NF_C
to be used for subscription.
2) The NF_A should verify if the access token and the CCA of the NF_C is valid
and executes the service.
3) The NF_A sends a Nnrf_AccessToken_Get request to NRF including the
information to identify the target NF (NF Service Producer), the source NF (NF
Service Consumer e.g., NF_C), the NF Instance ID of NF_A and the CCA_NF_C
received at step 2.
4) The NRF should check whether the NF_C are allowed to access the service
provided by the identified NF Service Producer, and whether the NF_A as the
proxy is allowed to request the service from the identified NF Service
Producer on behalf the NF_C. The NRF authenticates NF_C based on the CCA of
NF_C.
5) If the authorization is successful, the NRF shall then generate an access
token with the identity of the NF_A and the identity of the NF_C, NF type of
the NF Service Producer (audience), subscribe service name(s), (scope).
6) The NRF sends access token to the NF_A in the Nnrf_AccessToken_Get response
operation.
7) The NF_A requests service to the NF Service Producer. The Service Request
also consists of the CCA_NF_C, so that the NF Service Producer authenticates
the NF _C.
8) The NF Service Producer authenticates the NF_C and verifies the access
token to ensure that the access token is valid. After authentication and
authorization is successful, the NF Service Producer assures that the NF_A as
the proxy is allowed to receive the response message on behalf the NF_C, and
executes the subscribe service.
9) The NF Service Producer should respond the NF_A and provide the NF_C with
the notification service based on the Notification URI.
### 6.15.3 Evaluation
_The solution extends the existing token-based authorization method by
including the instance ID of the NF_A and the instance ID of the NF_C in the
token claims._
_The token is used to indicate towards NF_B (the producer and sender of the
notification) that NF_C (the notification receiver) authorizes NF_A (the
subscriber) to subscribe services on behalf of NF_C (the notification
receiver). The token is also used to indicate towards NF_B (the producer and
sender of the notification) that the NRF authorizes NF_C (the notification
receiver) to receive notifications from NF_B._
_The solution has impact on the access token generation by adding the instance
ID of delegated NF_C into the access token, and token verification._
How the solution works in case of notification target reselection as described
in clause 6.3.1.0 of TS 23.501 [3] is not addressed in the present document.
NOTE: Further evaluation is necessary and not addressed in the present
document.
## 6.16 Solution #16: Selective End of End Protection of HTTP Request and
Response in Indirect Communication
### 6.16.1 Introduction {#introduction-19}
This solution addresses KI#5.
It allows an NF to verify the integrity of selected attributes in a service
request or response consumer. It requires the use of CCA and Server Credential
Assertion (SCA) so that a recipient NF has access to the public key
certificate of a sending NF. The solution does not propose any change to CCA
or SCA.
Instead of protecting the integrity of entire request or response, which has
impact on the functioning of SCP based on the feedback from CT, this solution
proposes to protect only selected fields in a request or response that are
considered critical and should not be modified by any intermediate entities
such as SCP. Note there is a trade-off. The more of the message is protected,
the fewer attacks are possible, but there is also a higher risk that the SCP
may need to modify integrity protected parts of the message.
Further, to avoid complexity of signalling which attributes are to be
integrity protected inline request or response, this solution proposes to use
static configuration to indicate which attributes require integrity
protection.
### 6.16.2 Solution details
Each NF, either NF Service Consumer or NF Service Producer, is provided with a
local integrity protection policy, describing which attributes or information
elements within a service request or service response require integrity
protection. For example, AUSF and UDM may be configured with the security
policy requiring the integrity protection of authentication method, and
authentication vector.
Local security policy can be dynamically updated as with other local
configuration of the NFs. NF Service Consumer and NF Service Producer can also
communicate its security policy to each other. The security policy of an NF
Service Producer can be sent to the NF Service Consumer along with the SCA
during the authentication procedure as described in solution #13. NF Service
Consumer can send its security policy to the NF Service Producer in its
service request.
Based on the security policy, an NF creates one (or more) JWT tokens for the
information elements in a service request or service response that require
integrity protection. The JWT token is digitally signed by the private key of
the NF. The JWT token may be included in an information element in a service
request or service response, or in an HTTP header.
The public key certificate of the sending NF that is required to verify a
received JWT token is communicated to a receipt NF in CCA or SCA.
When a recipient NF receives a service request or service response, it checks
its security policy to see if any information elements in the received service
request or service response require integrity protection. If yes, it extracts
and verifies the JWT token to ensure that protected information elements have
not been tampered with.
_Since the JWT with the protected information is not bound to the message in
which it is sent, attacks are possible where the JWT is inserted or replayed
into another message._
_Replay of a JWT token can be mitigated in the same way as replaying of any
other security token such as CCA, e.g., using a timestamp._
### 6.16.3 Evaluation

## 6.17 Solution #17: Authorization mechanism negotiation using existing
methods
### 6.17.1 Introduction {#introduction-20}
This solution addresses Key Issue #7 \"Authorization mechanism negotiation\".
It is proposed to use the two NRFs for the authorization mechanism
negotiation.
The solution assumes that an operator has to support both methods, i.e.,
token-based authorization and static authorization, but one operator only uses
static authorization. Hence, for this solution both networks need to
understand OAuth 2.0.
### 6.17.2 Solution details
The solution assumes that discovery is used by both PLMNs according to the
standard. Thus, both PLMNs are able to understand the OAuth2Required
indication as specified in TS 29.510 [6] when NRFs communicate with each
other, and when a NF service is discovered at NRF.
The key issue use case assumption is that one PLMN uses only static
authorization. Based on TS 33.501 [2] (clause 13.4.1.0): \"The authorization
framework uses the OAuth 2.0 framework as specified in RFC 6749 [43]. [...]
The authorization framework described in clause 13.4.1 is mandatory to support
for NRF and NF.\" and clause 13.4.0, static authorization can be used. \"It
can be used when token-based authorization is not used.\"
This solution follows the standard, i.e., that at least the support for
OAuth2.0 is provided, thus, even if not used, NRF and NFs of a PLMN using only
static authorization need to at least understand the attributes (IEs) provided
during discovery.
This solution suggests that from the oAuth2Required indication, the vNRF can
imply, whether OAuth2.0 or static authorization is to be used within one PLMN.
This covers the use case, where within one PLMN maybe not yet all NFs use
OAuth2.0.
For inter-PLMN stage 3 (TS 29.510 [6] Table 6.1.6.2.3-1) \"oauth2Required\"
can be used to handle the authorization method setting by the hNRF. Another
type for NFService, the \"perPlmnOauth2ReqList\", is also specified and
includes the OAuth 2.0-based authorization requirement supported by the NF
Service Instance per PLMN of the NF Service Consumer.
Table 6.17.2-1: The IEs oauth2Required and perPlmnOauth2ReqList, part of TS
29.510 [6] Table 6.1.6.2.3-1
+----------------------+------------+---+------+----------------------+ | oauth2Required | boolean | O | 0..1 | It indicates whether | | | | | | the NF Service | | | | | | Instance requires | | | | | | Oauth2-based | | | | | | authorization. | | | | | | | | | | | | Absence of this IE | | | | | | means that the NF | | | | | | Service Producer has | | | | | | not provided any | | | | | | indication about its | | | | | | usage of Oauth2 for | | | | | | authorization. | +======================+============+===+======+======================+ | perPlmnOauth2ReqList | PlmnOauth2 | O | 0..1 | When present, this | | | | | | IE shall include the | | | | | | Oauth2-based | | | | | | authorization | | | | | | requirement | | | | | | supported by the NF | | | | | | Service Instance per | | | | | | PLMN of the NF | | | | | | Service Consumer. | | | | | | | | | | | | This IE may be | | | | | | included when the | | | | | | Oauth2.0 | | | | | | authorization | | | | | | requirement | | | | | | supported by the NF | | | | | | Service Instance for | | | | | | different PLMN is | | | | | | different. When the | | | | | | requester PLMN Id is | | | | | | available in | | | | | | perPlmnOauth2ReqList | | | | | | IE, this IE shall | | | | | | override the | | | | | | oauth2Required IE. | | | | | | If the requester | | | | | | PLMN ID is not | | | | | | present in | | | | | | perPlmnOauth2ReqList | | | | | | IE, then the value | | | | | | of oauth2Required IE | | | | | | shall be applicable | | | | | | if available. | +----------------------+------------+---+------+----------------------+
In addition, stage 3 has specified for inter-PLMN usage the type PlmnOauth2
(see clause 6.1.6.2.102, TS 29.510 [6]. If the optional attribute
\"oaut2NotRequiredPlmnIdList\" is used, the solution suggests that in this
case pre-configured information by HPLMN (how to apply static authorization
with a specific roaming partner) can be used.
Stage-3 details could be improved by stating explicitly that oauth2NotRequired
refers to static authorization.
Table 6.17.2-2: The IEs oauth2RequiredPLMNIdList and
oauth2NotRequiredPLMNIdList, part of TS 29.510 [6] Table 6.1.6.2.3
+------------------+---------------+---+------+------------------+ | oauth2Re | array(PlmnId) | O | 1..N | It shall | | quiredPlmnIdList | | | | indicate the | | | | | | consumer PLMN ID | | | | | | list for which | | | | | | NF Service | | | | | | Instance | | | | | | requires | | | | | | Oauth2-based | | | | | | authorization. | | | | | | | | | | | | (See NOTE 1) | +==================+===============+===+======+==================+ | oauth2NotRe | array(PlmnId) | O | 1..N | It shall | | quiredPlmnIdList | | | | indicate the | | | | | | consumer PLMN ID | | | | | | list for which | | | | | | NF Service | | | | | | Instance does | | | | | | not require | | | | | | Oauth2-based | | | | | | authorization. | | | | | | | | | | | | (See NOTE 1) | +------------------+---------------+---+------+------------------+ | NOTE 1: The same | | | | | | PLMN Id shall | | | | | | not be present | | | | | | in both | | | | | | oauth2Re | | | | | | quiredPlmnIdList | | | | | | and | | | | | | oauth2NotReq | | | | | | uiredPlmnIdList. | | | | | +------------------+---------------+---+------+------------------+
Further, the IE oauth2Required used in the bootstrapping information is used
to indicate whether NRF requires OAuth 2.0 based authorization for accessing
its services:
Table 6.17.2-3: oauth2Required for service access from NRF, part of TS 29.510
[6], see Table 6.4.6.2.2-1: Definition of type BootstrappingInfo
+----------------+--------------+---+------+------------------+ | oauth2Required | map(boolean) | O | 1..N | When present, | | | | | | this IE shall | | | | | | indicate whether | | | | | | the NRF requires | | | | | | Oauth2-based | | | | | | authorization | | | | | | for accessing | | | | | | its services. | | | | | | | | | | | | The key of the | | | | | | map shall be the | | | | | | name of an NRF | | | | | | service, e.g. | | | | | | \"nnrf-nfm\" or | | | | | | \"nnrf-disc\". | | | | | | | | | | | | The value of | | | | | | each entry of | | | | | | the map shall be | | | | | | encoded as | | | | | | follows: | | | | | | | | | | | | - true: OAuth2 | | | | | | based | | | | | | authorization is | | | | | | required. | | | | | | | | | | | | - false: OAuth2 | | | | | | based | | | | | | authorization is | | | | | | not required. | | | | | | | | | | | | The absence of | | | | | | this IE means | | | | | | that the NRF has | | | | | | not provided any | | | | | | indication about | | | | | | its usage of | | | | | | Oauth2 for | | | | | | authorization. | +----------------+--------------+---+------+------------------+
If set to false, OAuth 2.0 based authorization is not required. This solution
proposes to clarify stage 3 that this mean, the only other available
authorization mechanism \"static authorization\" is the default in this case.
GSMA has provided the following recommendations given in NG.113 [8], clause
7.6.3.4:
> \"_It is recommended that both VPMN and HPMN use either static authorization
> or\ authorization using_ _OAuth 2.0 access token.\ Note: Authorization is
> not possible in case the HPMN only uses authorization\ using_ _OAuth 2.0
> access token and the VPMN only uses static authorization._
_If using authorization using_ _OAuth 2.0 access token it is recommended that
both VPMN and HPMN support oauth2Required IE as specified in 3GPP Release 16
TS 29.510 [16]._
_If the HPMN wants to use authorization using_ _OAuth 2.0 only for some VPMNs
then HPMN must support perPlmnOauth2ReqList IE as specified in 3GPP Release 17
TS 29.510 [16]._ \"
How to configure the NF profile in case the operator wants to change to
another authorization method is out of scope of this solution. By OAM this
could be automated for each NF affected.
If the operator of one PLMN does not want to follow the specification and only
supports static authorization, and the other operator requires the usage of
OAuth, then in a consequence, those operators cannot have a roaming agreement.
The service request has to be rejected if one PLMN does not accept a request
without an OAuth.
### 6.17.3 Evaluation
Several means to allow a PLMN\'s hNRF to provide to the requesting vNRF
information on the authorization method used exist in the current
specification TS 29.510 [6]. If in the array(PlmanId) of hPLMN NRF a roaming
partner is on the \"oauth2NotRequiredPlmnIdList\", static authorization can be
used with this roaming partner. When operators follow the recommendations
given in NG.113 [8], the key issue seems to be covered sufficiently by the
existing methods.
Further evaluation would be needed, but the study has been stopped.
## 6.18 Solution #18: Avoiding slice isolation violation
### 6.18.1 Introduction {#introduction-21}
This solution is addressing KI#9.
### 6.18.2 Solution details
To avoid network slice isolation violation as described in detail by KI#9,
clarification of the specification clause 13.4.1.1.2 is required to mitigate
potential slice related attacks.
The solution proposes
\- in step 1a of clause 13.4.1.1.2 of TS 33.501 [2], NRF to verify that the
S-NSSAI of the NF Service Consumer in the access token request is consistent.
Specification text is proposed as follows:
> _\"The NRF may additionally verify the S-NSSAIs of the NF Service
> Consumer.\"_ The NRF checks whether the NF Service Consumer is authorized to
> access the requested service(s). _\"For example, the NRF may verify that the
> NF Service Consumer can serve a slice which is included in the allowed
> slices for the NF Service Producer.\"_
\- in step 2 of clause 13.4.1.1.2 of TS 33.501 [2], NF Service Producer
checking the audience claim to verify that the producer NSSAIs in the access
token (received in the service access request) contains the allowed NSSAI of a
UE if the request is for UE related information. Specification text is
proposed as follows:
> _It checks that the audience claim in the access token matches its own
> identity or the type of NF Service Producer. If a list of NSSAIs or list of
> NSI IDs is present, the NF Service Producer shall check that it serves the
> corresponding slice(s). \"If applicable (e.g., when the request is for
> information related to a specific UE), the NF Service Producer may check
> that the NF Service Consumer is allowed to access (as indicated by the NF
> Service Producer\'s NSSAIs in the access token presented by the NF Service
> Consumer) at least one of the slice(s) that the UE is currently registered
> to, e.g., by verifying that the UE\'s allowed NSSAI(s) intersect with the NF
> Service Producer\'s NSSAIs in the access token. As the NSSAI supplied by NF
> Service Consumer is forged, NF Service Producer (e.g. ,AMF) should obtain
> the NSSAI of the UE from the UDM for verification.\"_
### 6.18.3 Evaluation
The text proposed provides input to normative work on this topic. It avoids
slice isolation violation.
## 6.19 Solution #19: Hosted SEPP requirements
### 6.19.1 Introduction {#introduction-22}
This solution addresses key issue #12. It provides input for text that needs
to be adapted for clarification of a deployment option for SEPP of a PLMN, if
hosted by an entity external to the PLMN.
### 6.19.2 Solution details
This solution is addressing the Hosted SEPP as described in KI#12.
If the Hosted SEPP provider is contracted by several PLMNs, it hosts several
distinct Hosted SEPP instances for the different PLMNs.
A PLMN can have a Local SEPP (managed by the PLMN) and a Hosted SEPP
(instance), both handling disjoint sets of roaming relations.
**It is proposed to add the following definitions to TS 33.501 [2]:**
**\"Hosted SEPP:** A SEPP that is hosted and operated by a provider outside
the PLMN, for example an IPX provider. From the perspective of roaming
partners, PLMN trust extends to the Hosted SEPP instance representing this
PLMN. A Hosted SEPP provider can operate Hosted SEPPs for multiple PLMNs.
**Local SEPP: A SEPP of a PLMN that is operated by an MNO.**
**The Hosted SEPP serves a set of roaming relations that is disjoint from the
set of roaming relations served by the Local SEPP.\"**
It is further proposed to have an addition to the general requirements in TS
33.501[2] clause 5.9.3 (Requirements for e2e core network interconnection
security) as follows:
\"From the roaming partner\'s point of view, a Hosted SEPP shall behave in the
same way as the SEPP.
All SBI messages transmitted between the PLMN and the Hosted SEPP deployment
shall be confidentiality, integrity, and replay protected.
A Hosted SEPP provider shall isolate the processing for each PLMN from the
processing for other PLMNs.
A Hosted SEPP provider shall use a different TLS certificates per PLMN, as the
MNC and MCC of that PLMN are encoded in the certificate (as specified in TS
23.003 [18] and TS 33.310 [14], Table 6.1.3c.3-1). This certificate shall be
issued to the Hosted SEPP provider under its own unique name, and hence shall
contain both the PLMN-ID and its own unique identifier.
A Hosted SEPP shall only be able to obtain a certificate with an MCC/MNC
combination if the affected MNO has previously authorized this.\"
As roaming with hosted SEPPs potentially increases the number of root CAs in
the overall system, the need to support certificate pinning also increases. It
is proposed to add the following requirement to TS 33.501 [2].
> _\"The SEPP shall support Certificate Pinning in the following way: It shall
> maintain a set of lists containing root CA certificates, as well as a
> mapping of PLMN-IDs to this set. The mapping associates each PLMN-ID with a
> given root CA certificate list. During N32-c connection setup, the SEPP
> shall map the PLMN-ID of the remote SEPP leaf (server or client) certificate
> to the associated root CA certificate list for the purposes of certificate
> chain verification. Only the root CA certificates in the associated list
> shall be treated as trusted during certificate chain verification. If the
> remote SEPP certificate contains multiple PLMN-IDs that are mapped to
> different root CA certificate lists, then that certificate shall be
> rejected.\"_
Finally, it is proposed to have an additional NOTE referring to Hosted SEPP
concept in TS 33.501 [2] clause 13.1.2 (Protection between SEPPs) as follows:
\"_If a Hosted SEPP is deployed as the edge of one PLMN and in the same
security zone, the same protection requirements apply to this Hosted SEPP as
they apply to a SEPP in general. Furthermore, the Hosted-SEPP-specific
protection requirements in clause 5.9.3 apply_.\"
### 6.19.3 Evaluation
Whether to use a Hosted SEPP is a business decision. Nevertheless, it is
important to provide a minimal set of requirements covering this deployment
option.
Guidelines for naming are provided for Hosted SEPP by GSMA already in [8] and
TS 33.310 [14] may need to be checked for consistency with respect to new
security requirements. Such requirements may need to be communicated to GSMA
as well.
NOTE: Further evaluation is not addressed in the present document.
## 6.20 Solution #20: PRINS for Roaming Hubs
### 6.20.1 Introduction {#introduction-23}
This solution addresses key issue #10.
There may be one or two roaming hubs involved in the communication between two
PMNs. The roaming hubs require the ability to allow roaming relations between
these PMNs via these roaming hubs. Furthermore, roaming hubs with financial
liability require the ability to shape roaming traffic between the PMNs in
order to control how much roaming traffic they will have to pay for.
PRINS can be used to achieve this, allowing and disallowing establishment of
N32c through standard HTTP proxy functionality. PRINS can also be used to
dynamically introduce a traffic shaper under control of the RH into the data
plane.
### 6.20.2 Solution details
Figure 6.20.2-1: Establishment of N32c via roaming hubs
0: The cSEPP is configured to make use of RH1
1: After receiving an initial request, the cSEPP may set up a TLS connection
with RH1\'s proxy. The cSEPP then sends a CONNECT command to RH1\'s proxy
indicating the destination to be pSEPP. If cSEPP does not have access to the
pSEPP FQDN, the cSEPP follows the procedure in 6.20.2.**3** to find the pSEPP
FQDN.
2: RH1\'s proxy shall verify that cSEPP is allowed to set up a roaming
relation with pSEPP. If not, the flow continues with the error message of step
6. Otherwise, it continues with step 3.
3: If pSEPP requires another roaming hub to be reached, RH1\'s proxy sets up a
TLS connection with RH2\'s proxy. R1\'s proxy then sends a CONNECT command to
RH2\'s proxy indicating the destination to be pSEPP. RH2\'s proxy shall verify
that RH1 is allowed to set up a roaming relation with pSEPP. If not, the flow
continues with the error message of step 5. Otherwise, it continues with step
4.
4: If RH2 is present, RH2\'s proxy, otherwise RH1\'s proxy shall set up a TCP
connection to pSEPP. This connection may be protected by TLS.
5: If successful, if RH2 is present, RH2 shall return success with code 200.
6: If successful, RH1 shall return success with code 200.
If successful, pSEPP and cSEPP shall establish a TLS connection via the
proxy/proxies for N32c and establish an N32f context, selecting PRINS as the
protection mechanism.
Figure 6.20.2-2: N32f via roaming hubs
1: cSEPP may either initiate a new TLS connection to RH1\'s proxy, or reuse
the TLS connection from setting up N32c. In any case, communication between
cSEPP and RH1\'s proxy shall be TLS protected.
2: After receiving a request from an NF, the cSEPP shall encapsulate the
request as defined in TS29.573 [9] subclause 5.3.2.3 and send the reformatted
message to RH1\'s proxy. The URL to send the request to shall be located on
RH1\'s proxy, thus RH1\'s proxy is able to read the request.
3: If another RH is present, RH1\'s proxy shall forward the message to RH2\'s
proxy, including a via header and an asserted identity header asserting the
identity of the cSEPPs PMN. If RH2 is not present, then this request shall be
sent directly to pSEPP.
4: If another RH is present, RH2\'s proxy shall forward the request to pSEPP,
including a via header giving both RH proxies. An asserted identity header is
not necessary as pSEPP can identify the source PMN from the N32f context.
5: pSEPP shall decapsulate the request, forward it to the pNF and receive the
response.
6: pSEPP shall reformat the response and forward to RH2 (if present) or to RH1
(if RH1 is not present).
7: If RH2 is present, then RH2\'s proxy shall forward the response to RH1\'s
proxy.
8: RH1\'s proxy shall forward the response to cSEPP.
9: cSEPP shall decapsulate the response, forward it to the pNF
All communication shall be TLS protected on the hops between cSEPP and RH1\'s
proxy, RH1\'s proxy and RH2\'s proxy, RH2\'s proxy and pSEPP.
RH1\'s proxy and RH2\'s proxy both may include modifications, or return errors
in case of roaming policy violations.
The following two messages sequence charts give examples:
{width="6.695138888888889in" height="3.3645833333333335in"}
Figure 6.20.2-3: Roaming hub inserting a traffic shaper
To insert a traffic shaper into the roaming user data plane, the RH may
include a modifications block that rewrites the N9 endpoints IP address and
TEID for the visited networks UPF in message 3, and another modifications
block that rewrites the N9 endpoints IP address and TEID for the visited
networks UPF in message 7. As these modifications blocks are signed, the
modifications are attributable.
Figure 6.20.2-4: Roaming rejecting a session creation request
A roaming hub may also reject a PDU session setup request by returning an
error in message 3. This error is forwarded to the vSMF in message 4. This may
be triggered by some information in the request visible to the RH. If
different SUPIs require different handling, then of course, SUPI shall not be
encrypted in the request.
The examples can be extended to include two roaming hubs and potentially even
two traffic shapers.
### 6.20.3 RH Proxy Resolves pSEPP Well-Known FQDN
When the cSEPP does not have access to the pSEPP FQDN, the cSEPP follow the
following procedure to get the pSEPP specific FQDN:
1\. The cSEPP is configured to make use of RH1.
2\. After receiving an initial request, the cSEPP may set up a TLS connection
with RH1\'s proxy. The cSEPP then sends a CONNECT command to RH1\'s proxy
indicating the destination to be the pSEPP well-known FQDN as described in
[x].
3\. RH1\'s proxy shall verify that cSEPP is allowed to set up a roaming
relation with pSEPP based on the pSEPP well-know FQDN. If the cSEPP is allowed
to setup a roaming relationship with pSEPP, the RH1\'s HTTP proxy shall
resolve the pSEPP well-known FQDN to a specific pSEPP FQDN in the HPLMN
following GSMA PRDs [10] and [11].
4\. The RH shall respond by a 307 HTTP/2 response with the Location response
header containing the https scheme, the discovered pSEPP FQDN, and the
discovered n32-c port, if non-standard port is discovered.
5\. cSEPP shall validate that the received pSEPP FQDN belongs to the HPLMN
that the cSEPP is trying to reach.
### 6.20.4 Evaluation
The solution allows a RH to allow or deny roaming traffic between operators
based on the contractual relations with the RH. In addition, it allows traffic
shaping of the user plane roaming traffic between two PMNs making use of
roaming hubs by dynamically introducing a traffic shaper.
The solution exposes user plane traffic to roaming hub\'s traffic shapers
(when present). However, at both PMNs, the presence of the traffic shapers is
visible in the modifications blocks. Furthermore, modifications performed by
the roaming hubs are attributable.
NOTE: Further evaluation is necessary but not addressed in the present
document.
## 6.21 Solution #21: Certificate solution for NRF validation of NFc for
access token requests
### 6.21.1 Introduction {#introduction-24}
This potential solution addresses the KI #11, NRF validation of NFc for access
token requests. It describes what entities that need to be validated, what
needs to be in place from a certificate perspective, and finally some
additional details how the verification is performed.
The basic idea of this solution is that the NRF uses the information in the NF
Service Consumer\'s certificate to base its authorization decision on.
### 6.21.2 Solution details
#### 6.21.2.1 NF Service Consumer information to validate at Service Request
Authorization
The authorization of a NF Service Consumer needs to be performed by validating
verified information about the NF Service Consumer stored in NRF. This
solution proposes that the NRF validates NF Type, NF Instance ID, PLMN-ID, and
FQDN.
#### 6.21.2.2 Certificates
This solution proposes that the NRF uses the NF Service Consumer information
in the NF Service Consumer\'s certificate to authorize the NF Service
Consumer. The public key certificate can be the TLS certificate of the NF
Service Consumer, if the NF Service Consumer itself requests the access token,
or the certificate used to sign the CCA of the NF Service Consumer, if the SCP
requests the access token on behalf of the NF Service Consumer.
If the TLS certificate of the NF Service Consumer is used, this solution
requires that the NF Service Consumer information described in clause 6.21.2.1
is available in the TLS certificate.
Today the following entities, relevant for authorization purposes, are
mandatory in the TLS certificate: PLMN-ID and FQDN.
The following are currently only optional, but need to be present in the
certificate, otherwise this solution will not work:
\- NF instance ID
\- NF type
Having this information present in the certificate can be reached in different
ways. It could either be mandated in the specification or required to be
present in deployments in order for this procedure to work. If it is not
mandated that the information is present in the certificates, this may lead to
interoperability problems between different vendor implementations.
#### 6.21.2.3 NRF validation solution
The NRF checks whether the NF Service Consumer is authorized to access the
requested service(s) by performing the following validation:
\- The NRF retrieves the available NF Service Consumer information in the
public key certificate of the NF Service Consumer to decide whether the NF
Service Consumer is authorized to invoke the NF Service Producer\'s service.
In deployment scenarios with only one NRF, the NRF does not use the
information about the NF Service Consumer in the access token request to base
its authorization decision on, since this information is provided by the NF
Service Consumer itself and therefore not reliable.
In hierarchical NRF deployments, additional measures are necessary. The NRF
that receives the access token request needs to verify the information about
the NF Service Consumer in the access token request with the certificate. The
NRF that issues the token can then base its authorization decision on the
information about the NF Service Consumer in the access token request, since
the NRF that received the access token request has verified the information.
### 6.21.3 Evaluation
NOTE1: Evaluation for this solution is not addressed in the present document.
NOTE 2: This solution assumes that it is not clearly specified which mechanism
the NRF uses to validate whether the NF Service Consumer is authorized to
receive the requested service. It is not addressed in the present document
whether the mechanism in this solution is needed, or whether the NRF can use
the NF Service Consumer profile to validate the NF Service Consumer in the
process of authorization of requested services including access token request.
## 6.22 Solution #22: Combined certificate and profile solution for NRF
validation of NFc for access token requests
### 6.22.1 Introduction {#introduction-25}
This potential solution addresses the KI #11, NRF validation of NFc for access
token requests. It describes what entities need to be validated, what needs to
be in place from a provisioning perspective, and finally some additional
details how the validation is performed.
The basic idea of the solution is that the NRF uses the information in the NF
Service Consumer\'s certificate and additional information in the NF profile
as basis for its authorization decision.
### 6.22.2 Solution details
#### 6.22.2.1 NF Service Consumer information to validate at Service Request
Authorization
The authorization of a NF Service Consumer needs to be performed by validating
verified information about the NF Service Consumer stored in NRF. This
solution proposes that the NRF validates NF Type, NF Instance ID, PLMN-ID, and
FQDN.
#### 6.22.2.2 O&M Provisioning solution
Any Network Function is allowed to use the NF management API to register its
profile at the NRF. However, it can happen that NF Service Consumers do not
use the NF management API to register their profile at the NRF. In this case,
this solution proposes that the NRF is provisioned with the NF profiles for
these NF Service Consumers, containing the NF Service Consumer information
described in clause 6.22.2.1, by an O&M provisioning operation.
The O&M provisioning operation does not need to be standardized.
#### 6.22.2.3 Certificates
In this solution, the public key certificate can be the TLS certificate of the
NF Service Consumer, if the NF Service Consumer itself requests the access
token, or the certificate used to sign the CCA of the NF Service Consumer, if
the SCP requests the access token on behalf of the NF Service Consumer.
If the TLS certificate of the NF Service Consumer is used, this solution
requires that the NF instance ID is available in the TLS certificate, so that
the certificate can be linked to the NF profile.
Having the NF instance ID present in the certificate can be reached in
different ways. It could either be mandated in the specification or required
to be present in deployments in order for this procedure to work. If it is not
mandated that the information is present in the certificates, this may lead to
interoperability problems between different vendor implementations.
#### 6.22.2.4 NRF validation solution
The NRF checks whether the NF Service Consumer is authorized to access the
requested service(s) by performing the following validation(s):
1\. The NRF retrieves the available NF Service Consumer information in the
public key certificate of the NF Service Consumer.
2\. The NRF uses the NF instance ID of the NF Service Consumer that was
obtained during authentication of the NF Service Consumer to retrieve the NF
profile.
3\. The NRF uses the information about the NF Service Consumer obtained in
steps 1 and 2 to decide whether the NF Service Consumer is authorized to
invoke the NF Service Producer\'s service.
In deployment scenarios with only one NRF, the NRF does not use the
information about the NF Service Consumer in the access token request to base
its authorization decision on, since this information is provided by the NF
Service Consumer itself and therefore not reliable.
In hierarchical NRF deployments, additional measures are necessary. The NRF
that receives the access token request needs to verify the information about
the NF Service Consumer in the access token request with the certificate
and/or the NF profile. The NRF that issues the token can then base its
authorization decision on the information about the NF Service Consumer in the
access token request, since the NRF that received the access token request has
validated the information.
### 6.22.3 Evaluation
NOTE1: Evaluation for this solution is not addressed in the present document.
NOTE 2: This solution assumes that it is not clearly specified which mechanism
the NRF uses to validate whether the NF Service Consumer is authorized to
receive the requested service. It is not addressed in the present document
whether the mechanism in this solution is needed, or whether the NRF can use
the NF Service Consumer profile to validate the NF Service Consumer in the
process of authorization of requested services including access token request.
## 6.23 Solution #23: SCP authorization check by NRF
### 6.23.1 Introduction {#introduction-26}
This potential solution addresses KI#4.
### 6.23.2 Solution details
#### 6.23.2.1 Enabling NRF to check on SCP information
NOTE 1: This solution assumes that the SCP is not used for the registration of
the NF profile itself, in which the NF Service Consumer indicates which SCPs
are allowed to request an access token on its behalf.
Additional information about SCPs is provided by any NF when registering its
profile at the NRF. In particular, it is proposed that the NF adds the SCP
Instance ID and the SCP FQDN to provide NRF with the knowledge of which SCP is
allowed to request an access token on its behalf.
Many of the NFps registering are also acting as NFcs. If this is the case, the
NRF profile information of a requesting NF can be used to verify, if the
requester NF has allowed a particular SCP to contact the NRF on its behalf.
In the case, the NF does not register its profile information at the NRF, the
NF can provision the SCP authorization information in the OAM.
The solution enables the NRF to provide SCP with an access token for NFc that
is bound to be requested only by the SCPs listed in the NF profile, i.e., for
which (a) the NF Service Consumer has agreed to act on its behalf and (b) the
NF Service Producer has agreed to provide access tokens and later the service,
when SCP is acting on behalf of the requesting NFc.
In the following the steps for an access token request are sketched:
1\. NF Service Consumer sends its requests to SCP along with its CCA_NFc.
2\. SCP requests the access token from NRF (including the CCA_NFc) and
optionally also includes in own CCA_SCP. CCA_SCP is optional in the case, that
the SCP Instance ID is present in its TLS certificate (and there is only one
SCP in between NFc and NRF).
3\. NRF verifies whether the SCP information, received either via its CCA_SCP
or via the TLS certificate, matches the SCP information that is provided by
the NF during its profile registration. NRF can also verify by CCA_NFc, if the
SCP is listed in the NFc profile as being allowed to act on behalf of NFc.
4,5. In case of a successful verification, NRF generates the access token,
also adding the SCP information (i.e., SCP Instance ID and SCP FQDN) in the
claims, and sends it to SCP.
In this way, NRF first checks if NFc has authorized the SCP to receive the
access token on its behalf, and then adds SCP details to the claim, so that
the NFp then in the later stage can verify if the NFc and NRF has authorized
the SCP to receive the service response on the behalf of NFc or not)
Once the access token has been received by SCP the following steps sketch the
service request part:
6\. SCP then sends the service request to NFp (along with this enhanced access
token, CCA_NFc, and its own CCA_SCP).
7\. NFp after verification of the received access token, matches the SCP info
in the claims, with either the subject of the CCA_SCP, or with the Instance ID
of SCP present in its TLS certificate (if there is a direct connection between
SCP and NFp, and there is only one SCP between NFc and NFP).
8\. If the verification is successful, NFp sends the service response to SCP,
else an error code is sent instead.
NOTE 2: In the case where there are multiple SCPs in between either NFc and
NRF, or NFc and SCP, NFc adds the information for the first SCP which is in
direct communication with the NFc. For the subsequent SCPs, the initial SCP
adds its information in the 'via or other custom header\'.
NOTE 3: The presence of original (initial) SCP information in the via or
custom header is providing at least a certain level of trust in the case
multiple SCPs are involved. The NRF can verify if the original SCP information
is present in the NF profile. The NFp, can verify if the origin SCP
information is present in the access token claim.
In the multiple NRF scenario where NFc is registered in NRF1 and NFp is
registered in NRF2, the following applies:
In this case, when access token request is received at the first NRF (NRF1),
the NRF1 can validate the access token request and match CCA and NFc NF
profile. If it is validated, the NRF can add custom header that validation is
successful. In this case, NRF2 can trust the information received from the
NRF1 and can generate the token accordingly.
To be valid for all the NFs (including the ones which have not registered
their profile at the NRF), step 3,4 can be modified as follows:
3,4. In the case the NFc is not registered at the NRF and thus the profile
information is not present, the NRF sends a request to OAM to request for the
authorized SCP info. The OAM, after validating the request, sends the SCP info
to NRF.
NOTE 4: If following up this solution, it needs evaluation whether it is
reasonable to have a real-time communication between NRF and OAM.
#### 6.23.2.2 Including service request information into the CCA
CCA currently does not have any information regarding the service request for
which the CCA is sent. In this solution the CCA can also be enhanced to
include a service request info to further decrease the attack surface.
Thus, it is proposed to couple the CCA with the service request and/or the
access token request along with which the CCA is sent. For example, a new
parameter \'serviceRequestInfo\' can be added in the CCA which contains the
request info and/or the scope information for which the access token is
generated.
When the NRF/NFp receives the request from a SCP, they compare the CCA
\'serviceRequestInfo\' parameter against the request which they have received.
In case of successful verification, the response is sent.

NOTE: Evaluation for this solution is not addressed in the present document.
## 6.24 Solution #24: Authorization negotiation with bootstrapping mechanism
### 6.24.1 Introduction {#introduction-27}
This solution addresses Key Issue #7 \"Authorization mechanism negotiation\".
It is proposed for authorization mechanism negotiation with bootstrapping
mechanism.
### 6.24.2 Solution details
Figure 6.24.2-1: Authorization mechanism negotiation with bootstrapping
mechanism
Pre-requisite:
\- the vPLMN and hPLMN support at least static authorization dependent on the
roaming partner
The Figure 6.24.2-1 describes the detailed solution for authorization
negotiation.
1) The vNRF sends a Nnrf_Bootstrapping_Get request to the hNRF to configure
addressed of the bootstrapping service instance.
2) The hNRF responds with all the service instances of the hNRF and their
endpoint addresses. In addition, the hNRF adds hPLMN authorization capability
into the bootstrapping response. The hPLMN authorization capability indicates
the supported authorization mechanisms, i.e., static, OAuth, or both.
3) The NF Service Consumer sends a discovery request to the vNRF.
4) The vNRF selects the final authorization mechanism supported by both the
received hPLMN authorization capability and the vPLMN authorization
capability.
NOTE: The final authorization mechanism selected by vNRF is depended on
operator.
5) The vNRF sends the final authorization mechanism to the NFc.
Then, if the final authorization mechanism indicates static authorization, the
NFc could use the static authorization to access the NFp service. If the final
authorization mechanism indicates OAuth authorization, the NFc could get the
token from the NRF before consuming the service from the NFp.
### 6.24.3 Evaluation
This solution addresses the threats and requirements of Key issue #7:
\"Authorization mechanism negotiation\".
The pre-requisite is that the hPLMN supports at least static authorization.
This solution addresses the inter-PLMN scenario where the vPLMN has only
implemented static authorization. The hPLMN sends its authorization mechanism
by bootstrapping mechanism. The NF Service Producer needs to support which
authorization mechanism is determined by the vNRF.
## 6.25 Solution #25: Solution on N32 security profiles
### 6.25.1 Introduction {#introduction-28}
**This solution is addressing aspects of KI#10, in the attempt to improve
practicability of the N32 PRINS solution for IPX or roaming hub as
intermediaries. It proposes to introduce profiles for the N32 security
solution.**
**The following requirements on roaming via N32 are defined in TS 33.501
[2]:**
_\- The solution shall support application layer mechanisms for addition,
deletion and modification of message elements by intermediate nodes except for
specific message elements described in the present document._
_NOTE: Typical example for such a case is IPX providers modifying messages for
routing purposes._
\- Th _e solution shall provide confidentiality and/or integrity end-to-end
between source and destination network for specific message elements
identified in the present document. For this requirement to be fulfilled, the
SEPP -- cf [2], clause 6.2.17 shall be present at the edge of the source and
destination networks dedicated to handling e2e Core Network Interconnection
Security. The confidentiality and/or integrity for the message elements is
provided between two SEPPs of the source and destination PLMN--._
_\- The destination network shall be able to determine the authenticity of the
source network that sent the specific message elements protected according to
the preceding bullet. For this requirement to be fulfilled, it shall suffice
that a SEPP in the destination network that is dedicated to handling e2e Core
Network Interconnection Security can determine the authenticity of the source
network._
_\- The solution should have minimal impact and additions to 3GPP-defined
network elements._
_\- The solution should be using standard security protocols._
_\- The solution shall cover interfaces used for roaming purposes._
_\- The solution should take into account considerations on performance and
overhead._
_\- The solution shall cover prevention of replay attacks._
_\- The solution shall cover algorithm negotiation and prevention of bidding
down attacks._
_\- The sol_ ution should take into account operational aspects of key
management.
3GPP has defined two security mechanisms for 5G Roaming Security, specifically
for N32-f interface protection: TLS (Transport Layer Security) and PRINS (ALS:
Application Layer Security).
Different stakeholders voiced that they may require the flexibility provided
by 3GPP specs, selecting between transport layer security and application
layer security, based on the interconnection schema or business needs.
This solution provides answers to the question for simplification. One of the
arguments given was that the security model needs to avoid cumbersome
negotiation procedures, which however in PRINS are relevant, as security
configuration parameters and protected information elements need to be agreed
between roaming partners and provided to IPX providers.
### 6.25.2 Solution details
To facilitate and simplify the deployment and operation of PRINS as one N32
security solution, it is proposed to introduce **security profiles.**
N32-c negotiation for PRINS is enhanced to allow selecting the existing scheme
(for backward compatibility and high security requirements voiced in
discussions) or selecting one or several security profiles.
\- Only by selecting \"full PRINS\", negotiation of a cipher suite and
exchange of modification and encryption policies is needed (current schema).
\- If a pre-defined profile, e.g. \"profile A\" or \"profile B\", is chosen, a
pre-defined security profile will be negotiated between SEPPs, and IPX can be
instructed equally.
\- \"integrity-only PRINS\" could be then one option, which in current
understanding means, that JSON objects are created without encryption policies
but integrity protected.
NOTE: Integrity-only PRINS may however not be preferable, since AVs and
authorization tokens need protection
With this information, during N32-c handshake, if the PRINS enhanced profile,
e.g., \"B\", is chosen, then both SEPPs (VPLMN and HPLMN) know how to handle
the communication on the N32-f interface and the intermediary IPX providers as
well. I.e., a profile indicator during N32-c negotiation phase can be
propagated as an indication of the selected PRINS profile to the IPX; since
only PRINS can be chosen, N32-f will always be based on application layer.
Table 6.25.2-1: Example of N32 security profile
+--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Enumeration value | Description | +==========================+==========================================+ | TLS | TLS security | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | PRINS | Protocol for N32 Interconnect security | | | with subcategories to indicate full | | Profile full | usage of PRINS, with integrity | | | protection only or specific profiles | | Profile integrity-only | | | | | | Profile A | | | | | | Profile B | | | | | | ... | | | | | | Operator defined profile | | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+
If PRINS with \"full PRINS\" is chosen, configuration parameters can still be
negotiated/exchanged, which keeps market open to those, really wanting this
high security option
a. Modification policy. A modification policy indicates which IEs can be
modified by an IPX provider of the sending SEPP.
b. Data-type encryption policy. A data-type encryption policy indicates which
types of data will be encrypted by the sending SEPP.
c. Cipher suites for confidentiality and integrity protection, when
application layer security is used to protect HTTP messages between them.
d. N32-f context ID. The N32-f context ID identifies the set of security
related configuration parameters applicable to a protected message received
from a SEPP in a different PLMN.
If PRINS with any other profile is chosen, the following configuration
parameters need to be negotiated/exchanged and profiles need to be defined.
a) A PRINS profile indicating a predefined set of one or more of the above
policies.
NOTE: Data type encryption policy for integrity-only PRINS profile: this
policy will not specify any data type to be confidentiality protected;
Modification policy for integrity-only PRINS profile: this policy will not
specify any IE subject to be modifiable. Still, integrity protection is
provided.

## 6.26 Solution #26: Authorization of NF Service Consumer accessing
Nnrf_AccessToken service
### 6.26.1 Introduction {#introduction-29}
The following text sketches the proposed text for normative work needed to
address KI#11.
### 6.26.2 Solution details
_NRF (Network Repository Function) main and sole functionality as defined in
TS 33.220 [4] can be summarized in two main functionalities:_
\- NRF is the 5GC repository for all 5GC Network Functions that belong to the
operator 5GC network.
\- NRF is the Authorization server within the operator 5GC network.
_Therefore, in order for NRF to be the Repository of the operator 5GC Network,
the NRF needs to have a record of all NFs that are present within the operator
5GC network. Not only 3GPP defined 5GC NFs but also it should include all
those non-3gpp network functions._
\- There is only one mechanism that is used to allow any NF to register its
profile with the NRF. This procedure is described under clause 5.2.2.2. in TS
29.510 [3].
\- NRF shall trust the information of registered NFs that is contained in the
NF profile within the NRF. It is assumed that NF profile registration has been
done in a secure manner. The NRF shall trust any information that is
registered and contained within this NF profile.
\- When a NF service consumer sends an access Token Request to the NRF, after
the NRF authenticates the NF Service consumer using any valid secure mechanism
as described in TS 33.501 [2], the NRF (as captured in [2]) shall validate
whether the NF service consumer is authorized to receive the service it is
requesting or not.
\- As part of the authorization process of the NF Service Consumer, the NRF
shall use the following information of the NF Service Consumer: NF Type, NF
Instance ID, PLMN-ID, and FQDN.
\- The NRF shall perform the above part of the authorization in the following
order:
a. The NRF shall check if there is a registered profile for the NF service
consumer.
If there is a registered profile, the NRF shall use such profile information
to validate the NF Service Consumer access token request content, i.e., the
following fields: NF Type, NF Instance ID, PLMN-ID, and FQDN.
If successfully validate, the NRF shall proceed with the rest of the
authorization mechanism against the requested service.
b. If there is no NF profile registered with the NRF for the NF Service
Consumer, the NRF shall validate the parameters from the Access token request
against the parameters in the NF Service Consumer certificate. If successfully
validated, the NRF shall proceed with the rest of the authorization mechanism
against the requested service.
c. If the validation of the NF Service Consumer Access token Request content
has not been successfully authenticated as per a or b above, the NRF shall
reject the Access Token Request with the appropriate error code
\"Unauthorized\".
### 6.26.3 Evaluation
NOTE: Evaluation for this solution is not addressed in the present document.
6.27 Solution 27: Dedicated N32 connections per PLMN in hosted SEPP deployment
6.27.1 Introduction
This solution addresses key issue #12. This solution describes the
requirements for allowing several PLMNs to be customer of a SEPP provider and
use the hosted SEPP functionality.
6.27.2 Solution details
The connection between the customer PLMN and the Hosted SEPP provider is
protected in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and against replays by means
of a secure channel. Several options exist for this secure channel, for
example NDSIP (TLS, IPsec).
To fulfil the isolation requirement, the Hosted SEPP provider operates a
dedicated SEPP instance for each PLMN it serves. This includes the usage, for
each customer PLMN, of at least one separate N32c (and N32f) connection(s)
towards the roaming partners. That is, it is prohibited to mix the signalling
of multiple customer PLMNs over a single N32 connection due to the isolation
requirement. Moreover, the TLS certificates used for N32 connections contain
both the PLMN ID(s) of the customer PLMN and the own unique identifier of the
hosted SEPP operator.
NOTE: The details of identifying the subject in the TLS certificate are out of
scope of 3GPP.
It is further required that the secure channel endpoint (e.g., NDSIP endpoint)
at the PLMN acts as a firewall that drops SEPP traffic that does not conform
to configured filtering rules.
6.27.3 Evaluation
As the N32-c connections of a customer PLMN terminates at the hosted SEPP, the
hosted SEPP represents the endpoint of the security relation with that PLMN\'s
roaming partners.
Compared to the setting with a local, i.e., non-hosted SEPP, the attack
surface in the setting of a hosted SEPP is increased because
\- the Hosted SEPP provider is put into a position where it can inject
signalling associated with one of its customers into a connection associated
with another, and
\- the source of unwanted traffic cannot be immediately and uniquely
attributed as being injected by the Hosted SEPP provider or one of its
customers\' PLMNs (such attribution works only in a mediated way, i.e.,
requiring the hosted SEPP operator to cooperate in tracing back the source of
signalling)
It is not possible to fully eliminate these shortcomings, because the operator
of the hosted SEPP is explicitly trusted to represent the PLMN on the N32
interface as its network edge. These shortcomings can, however, be addressed
by a robust governance framework which
\- specifies a strict naming scheme that uniquely identifies the operator of
the hosted SEPP
\- defines conditions under which the hosted SEPP operators are granted the
necessary TLS certificates
\- installs monitoring mechanisms with rapid reaction, e.g., TLS certificate
revocation makes use of the isolation requirement to enable roaming partners
to selectively disable N32 connections mediated by the hosted SEPP provider
without risking a situation of \"overblocking\".
The above mitigations are out of scope of 3GPP.
# 7 Conclusions
## 7.1 KI#1: Authentication of NRF and NF Service Producer in indirect
communication
### 7.1.1 Analysis
The key issue addresses the scenario of an intermediary such as a standalone
SCP to be compromised. In this case, the NF Service Consumer is not able to
verify if the NRF response or the NF Service Producer response has been
received by a legitimate entity. However, it also needs to be considered that
reselection of the NF Service Producer by the SCP can be a desired feature.
3 solutions are presented to cover this key issue.
Solution #1 and extended solution #6 are based on using the concept of CCA for
the NF Service Producer or the SCP, i.e., similar to the CCA used for the NF
Service Consumer as specified in TS 33.501 [2]. Such a token is introduced to
allow a client to validate the sender of a response directly, even if an SCP
is in between.
Solution #1 has a limited scope as provided in the respective evaluation part
in clause 6.1.
Solution #6 supersedes solution #1, overcoming some of the limits of
solution#1 in case of Model C, also addressing the scenario of reselection of
the target NF.
The optional inclusion of such a token including a NF Set Id allows a NF
Service Consumer to validate if the NF sending the response is the producer
that NFc has selected by itself or if it is a producer of the same NF Set or
NF Service Set as indicated in the OAuth token received from NRF. The token
cannot be used, if SCP has applied reselection of NFp outside of an NF Set.
Solution #6 addresses Model C with direct TLS between NF Service Consumer and
NRF for discovery. It does not address Model D or Model C without direct TLS
between NF Service Consumer and NRF for discovery. It requires that the NF
Service Consumer has knowledge about which NF Service Producers are in the NF
Set of the producer.
Solution #13 addresses similarly to solution #6 Model C. If the NF Service
Consumer knows the producer, it can use the procedure described in #13 to have
a verification of the producer sending the service response. However, in cases
of delegated discovery and re-selection of an NF Service Producer, the SCP
needs to be trusted since the NF Service Consumer cannot distinguish, if the
SCP is acting maliciously or as wanted due to network performance issues.
Thus, the behaviour on consumer side is hard to specify, i.e., accepting the
response, because SCP was doing its job of reselection or rejecting the
response, because the producer identity is not matching the one certified
before.
The key issue assumed a compromised SCP, but the cases of when an SCP is
compromised or when an SCP is just fulfilling its duty (i.e., re-selection),
are not clear and were questioned during this study. As a consequence, this
key issue is not followed up normatively.
### 7.1.2 Conclusion
It was decided that SCPs can only be used in situations in which all parties
communicating through the SCP trust the SCP to correctly handle the messages
passing through it.
No normative solution is pursued for addressing this KI.
## 7.2 KI#2: Need for additional security at operational level among SCP
domains
### 7.2.1 Analysis
The key issue provides for operational aspects of SCP domains. Usually within
an SCP domain, trust is assumed. If several SCP domains form a wider SCP trust
domain, additional means for securing such trust domain against other SCP
domains could be considered. However, further elaboration would be needed,
whether such operational concept is useful.
### 7.2.2 Conclusion
The topic is not followed up normatively.
## 7.3 KI#3: Service access authorization in the \"Subscribe-Notify\"
scenarios
### 7.3.1 Analysis
In TS 33.501[2] there is no reference to subscribe/notify, but it is clear
that it has to be handled in the same manner as subscribe/request. Whether
additional requirements would be needed for a notification recipient being
different as the subscriber for the notifications can be checked in normative
work, but the assumption is that the same mechanisms as for request/response
apply.
Solution#12 is the only solution provided for this key issue. It only
addresses the potential information leakage threat to an unauthorized NF.
However, leakage of notifications from an authorized compromised recipient to
an unauthorized recipients cannot be avoided, which is out of scope of the
solution. It is a matter of trust that a recipient that has been beforehand
authorized to receive notifications, is not forwarding or leaking it to other
NFs. The study identified that no token-based authorization method for
notification messages has been specified. It is agreed to not specify a
solution for callback-URI authorization as part of the normative work
following this study, since it is not clear whether the information leakage
can be prevented by the proposed solution and no further solutions have been
identified.
NOTE: How to assure that the notification message is sent to authorized NF is
not addressed in the present document.
### 7.3.2 Conclusion
A conscious decision is made to not apply token-based authorization to
notification operations.
No normative work on the solutions described in this study is pursued, but TS
33.501[2] needs to be updated with a clarification that token-based
authorization also applies to subscribe and unsubscribe operations, which is
described in detail in stage 3, but is missing in stage 2 requirements.
## 7.4 KI#4: Authorization of SCP to act on behalf of an NF or another SCP
### 7.4.1 Analysis
One of the main 5G security features is the usage of OAuth 2.0 to authorize
service requests. In indirect communication scenarios, however, an SCP is not
explicitly authorized, it could request a service or a token without the
knowledge of the NF Service Consumer (NFc).
Two solutions (Sol#2 and Sol#3) have been proposed, mandating the usage of
CCA, by which the NFc can at least \"implicitly authorize\" the SCP. This
achieves a minimum level of trust, but cannot avoid the threat described in
clause 5.4.2 within the validity time of the CCA, i.e., that \"SCP can send a
service request and receive a valid service response on behalf of NF Service
Consumer\", even though the NF Service Consumer has not authorized the SCP\".
Thus, CCA validity time need to be chosen very carefully to minimize this
possibility. A third solution (Sol#23) proposes that NRF has in its database
knowledge about the SCPs that could request a service on behalf of a consumer.
Solution #3 argues that existing mechanisms are sufficient: a NF sending a
request (with its CCA) to SCP, implicitly authorises SCP against NRF to
process this request. The limit of this solution is that the CCA can be stolen
or misused and, without NFc having requested a service, NRF could provide an
access token to SCP or NFp could provide a service to SCP.
Solution #2 proposes to include the SCP identifier (i.e., either SCP Instance
and/or Domain info) in the CCA generated by the NF Service Consumer. Thus,
only the SCP, which SCP Identifier is included in the CCA from NFc is able to
get a response from NRF to its request. This ensures that the CCA cannot be
misused by a MitM and thus achieves an additional level of trust, when the CCA
is more than once useable. This however comes with a trade-off, since it
impacts existing implementation (CCA generation by NFc and NRF handling of
CCA). Further, if more than one SCP is in the path, with this solution SCP
needs to create its own CCA including the SCP identifier from the requesting
SCP in order to keep the chain of trust.
Solution #23 provides SCP with an access token for NFc that is bound to be
requested only by the SCPs listed in the NF profile as registered by the
consumer at NRF. It also proposes to include information about the service
request in the CCA, which would allow the final recipient of the query to
verify if the SCP forwarding the request on behalf of the consumer not changed
anything. This solution would require an update to CCA and additions in the NF
profile. This solution only works if there is a secure way to provision the
knowledge about the SCP(s) on the path to the NRF. Including information about
the service request in the CCA can lead to service interruption if a well-
behaving SCP modifies the service request according to its policies.
Any conclusion to this key issue needs to weight the level of security and
trust achieved against the impact of suggested enhancements to the current
release.
Another aspect, which requires further analysis is whether explicit
authorization of the SCP would be needed. NRF can only authorize NFs. NRF
needs to trust that any request forwarded by SCP was initiated by a NFc. Thus,
in general only implicit authorization of SCP by the NF Service Consumer is
possible with the current solutions proposals based on CCA.
In summary, it is a trade of between security enhancement versus complexity
added.
### 7.4.2 Conclusion
It was decided that SCPs can only be used in situations in which all parties
communicating through the SCP trust the SCP to correctly handle the messages
passing through it.
No normative solution is pursued for addressing this KI.
## 7.5 KI #5: End-to-end integrity protection of HTTP messages
### 7.5.1 Analysis
The KI #5 is about end-to-end protection of HTTP message for indirect
communication. The key issue seek for solutions on how an NF Service Producer
can verify that a service request of the NF Service Consumer received via SCP
has not been modified tampered with.
Parameters in the request messages may be modified by the intermediate node,
and end-to-end protection of HTTP headers and bodies is discouraged, i.e.,
end-to-end protection of HTTP headers and bodies and segregating the
parameters based on SCP (or SEPP) modification criteria. There can be multiple
SCPs and/or SEPPs involved in the service request/response path where SCP can
modify the HTTP headers, and SEPP (or IPX) can modify the HTTP headers and/or
HTTP body attributes. In addition, there may be potential compatibility issues
with end-to-end protection of HTTP headers and bodies.
### 7.5.2 Conclusion
One of the fundamental functionalities of SCP is message mediation which may
require SCP to modify certain headers and/or content of the HTTP message,
typical end-to-end message integrity protection between the far end NFs seems
not feasible.
For this reason, 3GPP so far relies on hop-by-hop security.
No normative solution to be pursued for addressing this KI.
## 7.6 KI#6: Access token usage by all NFs of an NF set
### 7.6.1 Analysis
Only solution #7 is provided for this key issue. When implementing NF Sets a
common context storage needs to be organised, from which all NFs of the set
can retrieve the same status. There is no difference in this handling for NF
Service Producer and NF Service Consumer.
The main hurdle is that a NF Service Consumer is not necessarily a NF Service
Producer, in which case no NF profile registration at NRF is needed. However,
NF Service Consumers need to register with the OAuth 2.0 server and as
described in the solution, the NF Set ID or NF Service Set ID is needed to be
known at the NRF for the solution to work.
The NF Set management is out of scope but not different from using services of
different NF Service Producers within the same set by the same token.
Further evaluation would be necessary, but this is not addressed in the
present document.
### 7.6.2 Conclusion
No normative solution to be pursued for addressing this KI.
## 7.7 KI#7: Authorization mechanism determination
### 7.7.1 Analysis
The key issue is for studying that 5GS should provide mechanisms to handle the
case that one operator uses token-based authorization and its roaming partner
uses static authorization. Solutions (Solution #9, and #17) were proposed in
this regard.
TS 33.501 [2] mandates the support of OAuth2.0; and GSMA recommends (NG.113
[8], clause 7.6.3.4) that roaming partners support the same authorization
method. However, if one operator uses token-based authorization and its
roaming partner uses static authorization, TS 29.510 [6] is not clear, because
only the OAuth2required use case is described.
Solution #9 provides a negotiation method for the case that one operator uses
token-based authorization and its roaming partner uses static authorization.
The usage of static authorization only by VPLMN seems to involve additional
management effort on the HPLMN hNRF side for defining authorization policies
per roaming partner. It further involves the risk that a vNRF can dictate the
hNRF its own conditions on which authorization method to use.
Solution #17 is using existing stage 3 methods, which allow hNRF to configure
per PLMN whether OAuth2.0 method is required. However, also for this approach
some management effort is needed. Further, the existing stage 3 methods
emphasize on OAuth2.0 only. The solution proposes to provide an explicit
statement on static authorization if OAuth2.0 is not required. Solution #17
requires that one network knows the capability of the other network.
Solution #24 provides a negotiation method with bootstrapping mechanism. The
solution proposes a simple procedure to handle the authorization mechanism
negotiation. It is applicable for the case that one operator uses token-based
authorization, and its roaming partner uses static authorization.
### 7.7.2 Conclusion
No normative work is recommended. This key issue is related to Inter-PLMN
roaming discussion and is not addressed in the present document.
## 7.8 KI#8: Service access authorization requirements in intra-PLMN scenarios
for PLMN deploying multiple NRFs (in OAuth2.0 AS role)
### 7.8.1 Analysis
As described in clause 6.2.6.1 of TS 23.501 [3], an operator network can
deploy multiple NRFs, for example due to network slicing or network
segmentation.
A clause on handling access token requests in deployments with several NRFs is
missing in TS 33.501 [2].
Solution #10 addresses one part, i.e., making NF Service Consumer instance and
type available to a slice specific NRF. As provided by evaluation, the
solution is technical possible but seems to have high impact in realization.
For normative work, rather a generic description is desired how to handle
multiple NRF scenarios.
### 7.8.2 Conclusion
A new clause to TS 33.501 [2] along the lines of the following text should be
added to clarify NRF deployment scenarios.
> _If an NRF receives an access token request for an NF Service Producer that
> is not registered at this NRF, the NRF has to determine the target NRF where
> the NF Service Producer is registered. Only afterwards it can forward the
> access token request to the target NRF._
>
> _There can also be several hops of NRFs between the NRF that receives the
> access token request from the NF Service Consumer and the target NRF where
> the NF Service Producer is registered._
>
> _One option of hierarchical NRF deployment is the local NRF deployment,
> where the local NRF checks if the NF Service Consumer is authorized to
> receive the requested service and, if yes, issues and signs the access
> token. In the case when the access token request from the NF Service
> Consumer was forwarded by another NRF, the local NRF of the NF Service
> Producer needs to trust the NRF which forwarded the access token request._
The part of Solution #10 of making NF Service Consumer instance and type
available to a slice specific NRF has not been concluded for normative work
since there was no common view on whether the solution provides an
optimization.
## 7.9 KI #9: Authorization for Inter-Slice Access
### 7.9.1 Analysis
Solution #11 and solution #18 address this key issue.
Solution #11 proposes to include \"_allowedSnssaisPerSnssai\"_ or
\"_allowedOperationsPerSnssai\"_ in the NF/NF-Service profile registered by
the NF Service Producers in NRF. The parameter
\"_allowedOperationsPerSnssai\"_ allows finer control of scopes allowed to a
consumer from a different slice.
Additionally, use of parameter \"Requester-NSSAI\" is an enhancement to
existing Access-Token Grant, and allows NF-producers to authorize the NF-
Consumer\'s S-NSSAI if the NRF has validated the S-NSSAIs.
Solution #18 provides a minimal update as normative text proposal by demanding
the NRF to check on the NF Service Consumer being authorized to access a slice
of the NF Service Producer.
### 7.9.2 Conclusion
It is proposed to add the following requirements in the normative phase:
\- The 5GS should provide a mechanism that allows the NF Service Producer not
to provide service to NF Service Consumers, which are not authorized to access
a slice.
\- The 5GS should provide a mechanism that allows NRF not to provide access
tokens to NF Service Consumers which are not authorized to access a slice.
Further, normative text in clause 13.4.1.1.2. of TS 33.501 [2] should be added
to update in line with solution #18.
## 7.10 KI #10: N32 security in mediated roaming scenarios
### 7.10.1 Analysis
Further elaboration is needed on this topic. It is therefore decided to
outsource this key issue to a dedicated study on N32 roaming topics.
### 7.10.2 Conclusion
This key issue cannot be concluded yet. It is continued to be studied in a
dedicated study.
## 7.11 KI #11: NRF validation of NFc for access token
### 7.11.1 Analysis
Several problems have been identified in this key issue and are analysed in
the following.
**Regarding problem 1a**
The problem description is about an NFc profile not being available. This
problem statement would need further differentiation. In order to get
authenticated and authorized for service consumption at least the OAuth2.0
client registration information of the NF Service Consumer needs to be
available at the NRF.
In detail: If the NF Service Consumer is not acting as resource server (NF
Service Producer), i.e., being a pure consumer NF, this NFc will not register
services at NRF. Hence, no NF profile with services will be available at NRF.
However, in order to request an authorization token, the NF Service Consumer
needs to be known to NRF as OAuth 2.0 client (see TS 33.501 [2], clause
13.4.1). Thus, at minimum a consumer NF needs to be known to the NRF by its
OAuth2.0 client registration information. Even though TS 33.501 [2] lists the
usage of NF Service Registration procedure for registering the OAuth2.0 client
as an option, using NF Service Register is only sensible if the NF is also
providing services (i.e. as producer). TS 33.501 [2] lacks a description, how
to do OAuth client registration if no NF profile is registered. OAM can be
used for this.
**Regarding problem 1b**
This problem is about how NRF is validating the NFc, i.e., which information
to use if the NF has also registered its NRF profile or the OAuth 2.0 client
information and then providing its TLS certificate with the access token
request. In the problem statement it was asked whether one takes precedence
over the other.
The registering entity needs to assure that information registered at the NRF
is in line with the information provided in the NF TLS certificate or CCA or
the information provided by SCP in the service request, at minimum NF Instance
ID and PLMN ID. The local NRF, where the NFc is registered with its OAuth
client registration needs therefore to validate and match accordingly before
requesting the NRF where the services of a producer are registered.
**Regarding problem 2**
This problem requests for clarification on which of the two takes precedence:
the NF profile information or OAuth client registration information known by
the NRF, or the NFc TLS certificate received by NRF, when NFc is asking for an
OAuth 2.0 access token.
The situation can apply, if the NF Service Consumer has already registered as
NF Service Producer or when the NF Service Consumer was registered as OAuth2.0
client. In both situations, the registering entity needs to assure that the
information in the NRF is in line with the information issued in the NF\'s TLS
certificate, thus none takes precedence, but in case of a mis-match, the
authorization request cannot be granted. There are also situations that the
NRF has no TLS certificate, i.e., if SCP has authenticated NFc. In this case
the NRF either uses CCA if available or trusts the SCP and relies on the
information in the access token request.
**Solution summary**
Solution #21 proposes that NRF uses the information in the NF Service
Consumer\'s certificate to base its authorization decision on.
Solution #22 proposes that the NRF uses the information in the NF Service
Consumer\'s certificate and additional information in the NF profile as basis
for its authorization decision. Mandating of NF instance ID being part of the
certificate profile is a pre-condition to not run into interoperability
issues.
Solution #26 proposes NFc authorization by NRF is done using the existing
profile information ( OAuth 2.0 client profile only or if available NFp
profile).
**Solution evaluation comments**
TLS certificate usage by NRF is only possible, if available, i.e., in direct
communication. In indirect communication the certificate is used by SCP for
authentication. NRF can either trust SCP authentication or use CCA for
validation. If information elements are part of both, certificate or CCA and
in the request, they need to match.
### 7.11.2 Conclusion
A normative clarification is needed along these lines:
The NRF can validate the NF instance ID in access token requests to the
registered OAuth 2.0 client instance ID.
If the certificate and/or NF profile is available to the NRF, the NRF
validates information presented in the access token request (i.e., NF instance
ID, NF type, PLMN ID) against the same information in the certificate and/or
profile, which addresses Problem 2.
If the validation fails, NRF rejects access token request.
NOTE: It is assumed that NF instance ID, NF type and PLMN ID are mandatory
parameters in the certificate. By this problem 1b is also addressed.
Additions to TS 33.501 [2] are necessary such that OAuth client registration
information could be provided also by OAM, which would address problem 1a.
