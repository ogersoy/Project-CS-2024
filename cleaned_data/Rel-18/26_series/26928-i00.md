# Introduction
This Technical Report collects information on eXtended Reality (XR) in the
context of 5G radio and network services. Extended reality (XR) refers to all
real-and-virtual combined environments and associated human-machine
interactions generated by computer technology and wearables. It includes
representative forms such as augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and
virtual reality (VR) and the areas interpolated among them. In this Technical
Report, baseline technologies for XR type of services and applications are
introduced outlining the QoE/QoS issues of XR-based services, the delivery of
XR in the 5G system, and an architectural model of 5G media streaming defined
in TS 26.501. In addition to the conventional service category, interactive,
streaming, download, and split compute/rendering are identified as new
delivery categories. A survey of 3D, XR visual and audio formats is also
provided.
Use cases and device types are classified, and processing and media centric
architectures are introduced. This includes viewport independent and dependent
streaming, as well as different distributed computing architectures for XR.
Core use cases of XR include those unique to AR and MR in addition to those of
VR discussed in 3GPP TR 26.918, ranging from offline sharing of 3D objects,
real-time sharing, multimedia streaming, online gaming, mission critical
applications, and multi-party call/conferences. Based on the details in the
report, proposals for potential standardisation areas are documented.

# 4 Introduction to Extended Reality
## 4.1 XR Terms and Definitions
### 4.1.1 Different Types of Realities
The scope of this clause is the introduction of eXtended Reality (XR) to 3GPP
services and networks. eXtended Reality (XR) is an umbrella term for different
types of realities as shown in Figure 4.1-1. The figure also shows different
application domains of XR such as entertainment, healthcare, education, etc.
The different terms are defined in the following, reusing and extending some
definitions from 3GPP TR26.918 [2].
{width="4.186805555555556in" height="3.5972222222222223in"}
Figure 4.1-1: Different Types of Realities and some applications
_Virtual reality_ (VR) is a rendered version of a delivered visual and audio
scene. The rendering is designed to mimic the visual and audio sensory stimuli
of the real world as naturally as possible to an observer or user as they move
within the limits defined by the application. Virtual reality usually, but not
necessarily, requires a user to wear a head mounted display (HMD), to
completely replace the user\'s field of view with a simulated visual
component, and to wear headphones, to provide the user with the accompanying
audio. Some form of head and motion tracking of the user in VR is usually also
necessary to allow the simulated visual and audio components to be updated in
order to ensure that, from the user\'s perspective, items and sound sources
remain consistent with the user\'s movements. Additional means to interact
with the virtual reality simulation may be provided but are not strictly
necessary.
_Augmented reality_ (AR) is when a user is provided with additional
information or artificially generated items or content overlaid upon their
current environment. Such additional information or content will usually be
visual and/or audible and their observation of their current environment may
be direct, with no intermediate sensing, processing and rendering, or
indirect, where their perception of their environment is relayed via sensors
and may be enhanced or processed.
_Mixed reality_ (MR) is an advanced form of AR where some virtual elements are
inserted into the physical scene with the intent to provide the illusion that
these elements are part of the real scene.
_Extended reality_ (XR) refers to all real-and-virtual combined environments
and human-machine interactions generated by computer technology and wearables.
It includes representative forms such as AR, MR and VR and the areas
interpolated among them. The levels of virtuality range from partially sensory
inputs to fully immersive VR. A key aspect of XR is the extension of human
experiences especially relating to the senses of existence (represented by VR)
and the acquisition of cognition (represented by AR).
Other terms used in the context of XR are _Immersion_ as the sense of being
surrounded by the virtual environment as well as _Presence_ providing the
feeling of being physically and spatially located in the virtual environment.
The sense of presence provides significant minimum performance requirements
for different technologies such as tracking, latency, persistency, resolution
and optics. For more details, refer to clause 4.2.
Other relevant terms in the context of XR experiences are:
**\- Parallax** is the relative movement of objects as a result of a change in
point of view. When objects move relative to each other, users tend to
estimate their size and distance.
**\- Occlusion is the phenomena when one object in a 3D space is blocking
another object from being viewed.**
This document uses the acronym XR throughout to refer to equipment,
applications and functions used for Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and
other related technologies. Examples include, but are not limited to:
\- Head-mounted displays for Virtual Reality,
\- Optical see-through glasses and camera see-through HMDs for Augmented and
Mixed Reality,
\- Mobile devices with positional tracking and camera.
All in common with them is the ability that they offer some degree of spatial
tracking and the spatial tracking results in an interaction to view some form
of virtual content. More details on XR devices are provided in clause 4.8.
### 4.1.2 Degrees of Freedom and XR Spaces
A user acts in and interacts with extended realities as shown in Figure 4.1-2.
Actions and interactions involve movements, gestures, body reactions. Thereby,
the _Degrees of Freedom (DoF)_ describe the number of independent parameters
used to define movement of a viewport in the 3D space.
Any consistent interaction for an XR application with XR hardware is assumed
to be restricted to an XR session. Once an XR session has been successfully
established, it can be used to poll the viewer pose, query information about
the user's environment, and present imagery to the user.
{width="2.298611111111111in" height="2.298611111111111in"}
Figure 4.1-2: Different degrees of freedom for a user in extended realities
**Typically, the following different types of Degrees-of-Freedom are described
(and also shown in Figure 4.1-3).**
**\- 3DoF** : Three rotational and un-limited movements around the X, Y and Z
axes (respectively pitch, yaw and roll). A typical use case is a user sitting
in a chair looking at 3D 360 VR content on an HMD (see **Figure 4.1-3 (a)**).
**\- 3DoF+** : 3DoF with additional limited translational movements
(typically, head movements) along X, Y and Z axes. A typical use case is a
user sitting in a chair looking at 3D 360 VR content on an HMD with the
capability to slightly move his head up/down, left/right and forward/backward
(see **Figure 4.1-3 (b)**).
**\- 6DoF** : 3DoF with full translational movements along X, Y and Z axes.
Beyond the 3DoF experience, it adds (i) moving up and down
(elevating/heaving); (ii) moving left and right (strafing/swaying); and (iii)
moving forward and backward (walking/surging). A typical use case is a user
freely walking through 3D 360 VR content (physically or via dedicated user
input means) displayed on an HMD (see **Figure 4.1-3 (d)**).
**\- Constrained 6DoF** : 6DoF with constrained translational movements along
X, Y and Z axes (typically, a couple of steps walking distance). A typical use
case is a user freely walking through VR content (physically or via dedicated
user input means) displayed on an HMD but within a constrained walking area
(see **Figure 4.1-3 (c)**).

6DoF (d) 6DoF
Figure 4.1-3: Different degrees of freedom
Another term for Constrained 6DoF is _Room Scale VR_ being a design paradigm
for XR experiences which allows users to freely walk around a play area, with
their real-life motion reflected in the XR environment.
> Note: Constrained 6DoF is not intended to describe multi-room spaces, areas
> with uneven floor levels, or very large open areas. Content that handles
> those scenarios is better categorized as (unconstrained) 6DoF.
The Degrees of Freedom may also be used to describe the tracking capabilities
of an XR device. For more details on tracking, refer to clauses 4.1.3 and
4.1.4. Content and tracking capabilities of a device do not necessarily have
to match. However, the user is preferably informed by the application on any
differences between content and tracking capabilities in terms of number/types
of degrees of freedom. .
Spaces provide a relation of the user's physical environment with other
tracked entities. An _XR Space_ represents a virtual coordinate system with an
_origin_ that corresponds to a physical location. The world coordinate system
is the coordinate system in which the virtual world is created. Coordinate
systems are essential for operating in 3-dimensional virtual and real worlds
for XR applications.
As an example, a coordinate system is defined by OpenXR [16] in clause 2.15 as
well as for WebXR [17], both using a Cartesian right-handed coordinate system
as shown in Figure 4.1-4. This coordinate system is right-handed in sense
that, where +X is considered \"Right\", +Y is considered \"Up\", and -Z is
considered \"Forward\".
A coordinate system is expected to be a rectangular Cartesian in which all
axes are equally scaled.
Figure 4.1-4: Right-Handed Coordinate system
A three-dimensional vector is defined by the (x,y,z) coordinates. If used to
represent physical distances (rather than e.g. velocity or angular velocity)
and not otherwise specified, values are in meters. A _position_ in the XR
space is a 3D-vector representing a position within a space and relative to
the origin.
An XR reference space is one of several common XR Spaces that can be used to
establish a spatial relationship with the user's physical environment. An XR
reference space may be restricted, determining the ability by the user to
move. This aligns with the definitions above as well as Figure 4.1-3, namely
an XR reference space providing the degrees of freedom for a user.
\- For 3DoF, the XR reference space is limited to a single position.
\- For 3DoF+, the XR reference space is limited to a small space centered
around a single position, a small bounding box, limited to positions
attainable with head movements only, around a single position is provided.
\- For constrained 6DoF, the XR reference space has a native bounds geometry
describing the border around the space, which the user can expect to safely
move within. Such borders may for example be described by polygonal boundary
given as an array representing a loop of points at the edges of the safe
space. The points describe offsets from the origin in meters.
\- For 6DoF, the XR reference space is unlimited and basically includes the
whole universe.
A simplified diagram (mapped to 2D) on XR Spaces and and their relation to the
scene is provided in Figure 4.1-5.
Figure 4.1-5: Simplified Illustration of XR Spaces
Unless the user does a reconfiguration, XR reference spaces within an XR
session are static, i.e. the space the user can move in is restricted by the
initial definition.
An _XR View_ describes a single view into an XR scene for a given time. Each
view corresponds to a display or portion of a display used by an XR device to
present the portion of the scene to the user. Rendering of the content is
expected to be done to well align with the view\'s physical output properties,
including the field of view, eye offset, and other optical properties. A view,
among others, has associated
\- a _view offset_ , describing a _position and orientation_ of the view in
the XR reference space,
\- an _eye_ describing which eye this view is expected to be shown. Displays
may support stereoscopic or monoscopic viewing.
An _XR Viewport_ describes a viewport, or a rectangular region, of a graphics
surface. The XR viewport corresponds to the projection of the XR View onto a
target display. An XR viewport is predominantly defined by the width and
height of the rectangular dimensions of the viewport. In 3D computer graphics,
the view frustum is the region of space in the modeled world that may appear
on the screen, i.e. it is the field of view of a perspective virtual camera
system. The planes that cut the frustum perpendicular to the viewing direction
are called the _near plane_ and the _far plane_. Objects closer to the camera
than the near plane or beyond the far plane are not drawn. Sometimes, the far
plane is placed infinitely far away from the camera so all objects within the
frustum are drawn regardless of their distance from the camera.
Generally, an _XR Pose_ describes a _position_ and _orientation_ in space
relative to an XR Space.
\- The _position_ in the XR space is a 3D-vector representing the position
within a space and relative to the origin defined by the (x,y,z) coordinates.
If used to represent physical distances, x, y, and z are in meters.
\- The orientation in the XR space is a quaternion representing the
orientation within a space and defined by a four-dimensional or homogeneous
vector with (x,y,z,w) coordinates, with w being the real part of the
quarternion and x, y and z the imaginary parts.
Unit quaternions are used to document spatial rotations in three dimensions.
Roll, pitch, and yaw as for example used in TS 26.118 [3] have limitations(for
example due to the well-known gimbal lock). Hence, in computer science,
engineering and XR applications, they are replaced with the more robust
quaternion.
An _XR Viewer Pose_ is an XR Pose describing the state of a viewer of the XR
scene as tracked by the XR device. XR Viewer Poses are documented relative to
an XR Reference Space.
The views array is a sequence of XR Views describing the viewpoints of the XR
scene, relative to the XR Reference Space the XR Viewer Pose was queried with.
### 4.1.3 Tracking and XR Viewer Pose Generation
In XR applications, an essential element is the use of spatial tracking. Based
on the tracking and the derived XR Viewer Pose, content is rendered to
simulate a view of virtual content.
XR viewer poses and motions can be sensed by _Positional Tracking_ , i.e. the
process of tracing the XR scene coordinates of moving objects in real-time,
such as HMDs or motion controller peripherals. Positional Tracking allows to
derive the _XR Viewer Pose_ , i.e. the combination of position and orientation
of the viewer. Different types of tracking exist:
_\- Outside-In Tracking_ : a form of positional tracking and, generally, it is
a method of optical tracking. Tracking sensors placed in a stationary location
and oriented towards the tracked object that moves freely around a designated
area defined by sensor coverage.
_\- Inside-out Tracking_ : a method of positional tracking commonly used in
virtual reality (VR) technologies, specifically for tracking the position of
head-mounted displays (HMDs) and motion controller accessories whereby the
location of the cameras or other sensors that are used to determine the
object\'s position in space are located on the device being tracked (e.g.
HMD).
_\- World Tracking_ : a method to create AR experiences that allow a user to
explore virtual content in the world around them with a device\'s back-facing
camera using a device\'s orientation and position, and detecting real-world
surfaces, as well as known images or objects.
\- _Simultaneous Localization and Mapping_ (SLAM) is the computational problem
of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while
simultaneously keeping track of the user\'s location within an unknown
environment. For more details refer on SLAM, refer to clause 4.1.4.
If not mentioned otherwise, it is assumed that devices in the context of the
document are able to track the XR Viewer Pose in 6DoF with sufficient accuracy
as defined in clause 4.2.1.
To maintain a reliable registration of the virtual world with the real world
as well as to ensure accurate tracking of the XR Viewer pose, XR applications
require highly accurate, low-latency tracking of the device at about 1kHz
sampling frequency. An XR Viewer Pose consists of the orientation (for
example, 4 floating point values in OpenXR [16])) and the position (for
example, 3 floating point values in OpenXR [16]). In addition, the XR Viewer
Pose needs to have assigned a time stamp. The size of a XR Viewer Pose
associated to time typically results in packets of size in the range of 30-100
bytes, such that the generated data is around several hundred kbit/s if
delivered over the network.
### 4.1.4 XR Spatial Mapping and Localization
Spatial mapping, i.e. creating a map of the surrounding area, and
localization, i.e. establishing the position of users and objects within that
space, are some of the key areas of XR and in particular AR. Multiple sensor
inputs are combined to get a better localization accuracy, e.g.,
monocular/stereo/depth cameras, radio beacons, GPS, inertial sensors, etc.
Some of the methods involved are listed below:
**1) Spatial anchors** are used for establishing the position of a 3D object
in a shared AR/MR experience, independent of the individual perspective of the
users. Spatial anchors are accurate within a limited space (e.g. 3m radius for
the Microsoft® Mixed Reality Toolkit). Multiple anchors may be used for larger
spaces.
**2) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** is used for mapping
previously unknown environments, while also maintaining the localization of
the device/user within that environment.
**3) Visual Localization** , e.g., vSLAM, Visual Positioning System (VPS),
etc., perform localization using visual data from, e.g., a mobile camera,
combined with other sensor data.
Spatial mapping and localization can be done on the device. However, network
elements can support the operations in different ways:
1) Cloud services may be used for storing, retrieving and updating spatial
data. For larger public spaces, **crowdsourcing** may be used to keep the data
updated and available to all.
2) A **Spatial Computing Server** that collects data from multiple sources and
processes it to create spatial maps including, but not limited to, visual and
inertial data streamed from XR devices. The service can then provide this
information to other users and also assist in their localization based on the
data received from them.
**Indoor and outdoor mapping and localization** are expected to have different
requirements and limitations. Privacy concerns need to be explored by the
service provider when scanning indoor spaces and storing spatial features,
especially when it is linked to global positioning.
Tracking adds the concept of continuous localisation over time.
## 4.2 Quality-of-Experience for XR
### 4.2.1 Immersiveness and Presence
For providing XR experiences that make the user feel _immersed_ and _present_
, several relevant quality of experience factors have been collected
(https://xinreality.com/wiki/Presence). Immersion is an objective description
of aspects of the system such as field of view and display resolution.
Presence is the feeling of being physically and spatially located in an
environment. According to Slater and Usoh [43], "immersion is a necessary
rather than a sufficient condition for presence - immersion describes a kind
of technology, and presence describes an associated state of consciousness."
Presence is divided into 2 types: Cognitive Presence and Perceptive Presence.
Cognitive Presence is the presence of one\'s mind. It can be achieved by
watching a compelling film or reading an engaging book. Cognitive Presence is
important for an immersive experience of any kind.
Perceptive Presence is the presence of one\'s senses. To accomplish perceptive
presence, one\'s senses, sights, sound, touch and smell, have to be tricked.
To create perceptive presence, the XR Device has to fool the user\'s senses,
most notably the audio-visual system. XR Devices achieve this through
positional tracking based on the movement. The goal of the system is to
maintain your sense of presence and avoid breaking it.
Perceptive Presence is the objective to be achieved by XR applications and is
what is referred in the following.
In a paper [9] titled \"Research on Presence in Virtual Reality: A Survey\",
the authors quote Matthew Lombard's slightly more scientific definition of
presence: \"Presence (a shortened version of the term "telepresence") is a
psychological state of subjective perception in which even though part or all
of an individual's current experience is generated by and/or filtered through
human-made technology, part or all of the individual's perception fails to
accurately acknowledge the role of the technology in the experience. Except in
the most extreme cases, the individual can indicate correctly that s/he is
using the technology, but at some level, and to some degree, her/his
perceptions overlook that knowledge and objects, events, entities, and
environments are perceived as if the technology was not involved in the
experience.\" In other words, feeling like you're really there.
Presence is achieved when the involuntary aspects of our reptilian corners of
our brains are activated. When the user reaches out to grab the virtual apple,
becomes unwilling to step off a plank or feel nervous when walking on
rooftops. According to Teo Choong Ching [10], there are four components
relevant for feeling present, namely the
1\. The Illusion of being in a stable spatial place
2\. The Illusion of self-embodiment.
3\. The Illusion of Physical Interaction
4\. The Illusion of Social Communication
The most relevant component from a the technical aspect in the context of this
Technical Report is the first one. This part of presence can be broken down
into three broad categories, listed in order of most important to least
important for their impact on creating presence: Visual presence, Auditory
presence, and sensory or haptic presence.
Technical Requirements for visual presence have been formulated by Valve\'s ™
R&D Team Brendan Iribe (https://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-shares-5-key-
ingredients-for-presence-in-virtual-reality/) from Oculus ™ as well as from
experience collected from 3GPP members product development teams:
\- Tracking
\- 6 degrees of freedom tracking - ability to track user\'s head in rotational
and translational movements.
\- 360 degrees tracking - track user\'s head independent of the direction the
user is facing.
\- Sub-centimeter accuracy - tracking accuracy of less than a centimeter.
\- Quarter-degree-accurate rotation tracking
\- No jitter - no shaking, image on the display has to stay perfectly still.
\- For room-scale games and experiences, comfortable tracking volume - large
enough space to move around and still be tracked of roughly 2m cubes. For
seated games/experiences a smaller tracking volume is sufficient.
\- Tracking needs to be done frequently to always be able to operate with the
latest XR Viewer Pose. Minimum update rates as discussed above are 1000Hz and
beyond. Especially rotational tracking requires high frequency.
\- Latency
\- Less than 20 ms motion-to-photon latency - less than 20 milliseconds of
overall latency (from the time you move your head to when you see the display
change).
\- Minimize the time of pose-to-render-to-photon. Rendering content as quickly
as possible. Less than 50ms for render to photon in order to avoid wrongly
rendered content. For more details refer to clause 4.2.2.
\- Fuse optical tracking and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data --
\- Minimize loop: tracker → CPU → GPU → display → photons.
\- Minimize interaction delays and age of content depending on the
application. For more details see 4.2.2.
\- Persistence
\- Low persistence - Turn pixels on and off every 2 - 3 ms to avoid smearing /
motion blur. Pixel persistence is the amount of time per frame that the
display is actually lit rather than black. "Low persistence" is simply the
idea of having the screen lit for only a small fraction of the frame. The
reason is that the longer a frame goes on for, the less accurate it will be
compared to where you're currently looking. The brain is receiving the same
exact image for the entire frame even as you turn your head whereas in real
life your view would constantly adjust.
\- 90 Hz and beyond display refresh rate to eliminate visible flicker.
\- Resolution
\- Spatial Resolution: No visible pixel structure - you cannot see the pixels.
Low resolution and low pixels per inch (PPI), can cause the user to feel
pixelation and feel like he or she is looking through a screen door.
\- In 2014, It was thought at least 1k by 1k pixels per eye would be
sufficient.
\- However, in theory, in our fovea, we need about 120 pixels per degree of
view to match reality, possibly requiring significantly more than the 1k by
1k, all the way to 8k.
\- In 2019, it is commonly accepted that 2k by 2k per eye provides acceptable
quality. Increasing the horizontal resolution to 4k is considered a next step.
\- According to Plamer Luckey, founder of Oculus® Rift™, pixelation will not
go away completely until at least 8K resolution (8196 x 4096) per eye is
achieved (https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/virtual-perfection-
why-8k-resolution-per-eye-isnt-enough-for-perfect-vr/).
\- Temporal Resolution: According to
https://developer.oculus.com/blog/asynchronous-timewarp-examined/, to deliver
comfortable, compelling VR that truly generates presence, developers will
still need to target a sustained frame rate of 90Hz and beyond, despite the
usage of asynchronous time warping.
\- Optics
\- Wide Field of view (FOV) is the extent of observable world at any given
moment and typically 100 - 110 degrees FOV is needed. For details on FoV, see
3GPP TR 26.918 [2], clause 4.2.2.
\- Comfortable eyebox - the minimum and maximum eye-lens distance wherein a
comfortable image can be viewed through the lenses.
\- High quality calibration and correction - correction for distortion and
chromatic aberration that exactly matches the lens characteristics. For
details on optics, see 3GPP TR 26.918 [2], clauses 4.2.3 and 4.2.4.
For requirements on auditory presence, refer to 3GPP TR 26.918 [2] and [11].
For requirements on sensory and haptics presence, refer for example to [11].
The sense of presence is not only important to VR experiences, but equally so
to immersive AR experiences. To achieve Presence in Augmented Reality,
seamless integration of virtual content and physical environment is required.
Like in VR, the virtual content has to align with user\'s expectations. For
truly immersive AR and in particular MR, it is expected that users cannot
discern virtual objects from real objects.
Also relevant for VR and AR, but in particular AR, is not only the awareness
for the user as shown in Figure 4.1-5, but also for the environment. This
includes:
\- Safe zone discovery
\- Dynamic obstacle warning
\- Geometric and semantic environment parsing
\- Environmental lighting
\- World mapping
Figure 4.1-5: Environmental Awareness in XR Applications
For AR, to obtain an enhanced view of the real environment, the user may wear
a see-through HMD to see 3D computer-generated objects superimposed on his/her
real-world view. This see-through capability can be accomplished using either
an _optical see-through_ or a _video see-through_ HMD. Tradeoffs between
optical and video see-through HMDs with respect to technological, perceptual,
and human factors issues are for example discussed in [18].
### 4.2.2 Interaction Delays and Age of Content
Beyond the sense of presence and immersiveness, the age of the content and
user interaction delay are of the uttermost importance for immersive and non-
immersive interactive experiences, i.e. experiences for which the user
interaction with the scene impacts the content of scene (such as online
gaming).
**User interaction delay** is defined as the time duration between the moment
at which a user action is initiated and the time such an action is taken into
account by the content creation engine. In the context of gaming, this is the
time between the moment the user interacts with the game and the moment at
which the game engine processes such a player response.
**Age of content** is defined as the time duration between the moment a
content is created and the time it is presented to the user. In the context of
gaming, this is the time between the creation of a video frame by the game
engine and the time at which the frame is finally presented to the player.
The **roundtrip interaction delay** is therefore the sum of the _Age of
Content_ and the _User Interaction Delay_. If part of the rendering is done on
an XR server and the service produces a frame buffer as rendering result of
the state of the content, then for raster-based split rendering (as defined in
clause 6.2.5) in cloud gaming applications, the following processes contribute
to such a delay:
\- User Interaction Delay
\- capture of user interaction in game client,
\- delivery of user interaction to the game engine, i.e. to the server (aka
network delay),
\- processing of user interaction by the game engine/server,
\- Age of Content
\- creation of one or several video buffers (e.g. one for each eye) by the
game engine/server,
\- encoding of the video buffers into a video stream frame,
\- delivery of the video frame to the game client (a.k.a. network delay),
\- decoding of the video frame by the game client,
\- presentation of the video frame to the user (a.k.a. framerate delay).
For gaming, for example, references [19] and [20] provide interaction delay
tolerance thresholds per game type illustrated in Table 4.2.2-1. Note that
this Interaction delay refers to the roundtrip interaction delay as defined
above.
Table 4.2.2-1: Interaction delay tolerance in traditional gaming (from [19]).
Example game type Perspective Delay tolerance
* * *
First person shooter (FPS) First person 100 ms Role playing game (RPG) Third
person 500 ms Real-time strategy (RTS) Omnipresent 1000 ms
In [21], the authors set up a 12 players match of Unreal Tournament 2003^TM^
in a controlled environment. Each player is assigned a specific amount of
latency and jitter for the duration of the match. After the match, the players
answer a questionnaire about their experience in the game. This study still
uses relatively few players, but they are able to conclude that more than 60ms
of latency noticeably reduces both performance and experience of this game.
In general, it seems that 60 ms [18], or even 45 ms [22] are better estimates
at how much latency is acceptable in the most fast-paced games than the
traditionally quoted 100ms value.
In other cases the latency of the content is for example determined by
conversational delay thresholds. Typically, around 200ms of latency is
acceptable.
Overall, different applications and use cases require different delay
requirements and this phenomena should be considered.
The four following categories are considered with respect to roundtrip
interaction delay:
\- Ultra-Low-Latency applications: roundtrip interaction delay threshold of at
most 50ms latency.
\- Low-Latency applications: roundtrip interaction delay threshold of at most
100ms latency.
\- Moderate latency applications: roundtrip interaction delay threshold of at
most 200ms latency.
\- Non- critical latency applications: roundtrip interaction delay threshold
higher than 200ms latency.
## 4.3 XR Delivery in 5G System
### 4.3.1 General Delivery Categories
For the purpose of classifying use cases, this clause defines delivery
categories for XR experiences. The following categories are defined:
_\- Download_ : An XR experience is downloaded and consumed offline without
requiring a connection. All media and experience related traffic is downlink.
\- (Passive) _Streaming_ : The experience is consumed in real-time from a
network server. The user does not interact with the XR experience, or if
interacting with the XR experience, the interaction is not triggering any
uplink traffic. All media related traffic is downlink.
_\- Interactive_ (Streaming): The experience is consumed in real-time from a
network server. The user (or the device automatically) interacts with the XR
experience and the interaction changes the delivered content. The traffic is
predominantly downlink, but certain traffic is uplink, e.g. XR Viewer Pose
information. Different flavours of interaction exist, for example viewport
adaptation, gaming events, etc. Interaction delay requirements may be
different, ranging from immersive latency requirements to more static
selection interactions.
_\- Conversational_ : The experience is generated, shared and consumed in
real-time from two or more participants with conversational latency
requirements.
_\- Split_ Compute/Rendering: Network functions run an XR engine to support
processing and pre-rendering of immersive scenes and the delivery is split
into more than one connection, e.g. Split rendering, Edge Computing, etc. The
latency and interaction requirements again depend on the use case and the
architecture implementation.
A more detailed analysis of architectures in the context of 5G is provided in
clause 6.
### 4.3.2 5G System and Radio Functionalities for XR
The integration of XR applications within the 5G System is approached
following the model of 5G Media Streaming as defined in 3GPP TS 26.501 [8].
Assume a 5G-XR Application Provider being an XR Application provider that
makes use of 5G System functionalities for its services. For this purpose, it
provides a 5G-XR Aware Application on the UE to make use of a 5G-XR client and
network functions using network interfaces and APIs, potentially defined in
5G-XR related specifications.
The architecture in Figure 4.3.2-1 represents potential 5G-XR functions within
the 5G System (5GS) as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [23]. Three main functions
are defined:
  * 5G-XR AF: An Application Function similar as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [23], clause 6.2.10, dedicated to 5G-XR Services.
  * 5G-XR AS: An Application Server dedicated to 5G-XR Services.
  * 5G-XR Client: A UE internal function dedicated to 5G-XR Services.
In the context of this Technical Report, 5G-XR AF and 5G-XR AS are initially
considered Data Network (DN) functions and communicate with the UE via N6, N3
and Uu as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [23].
Communication through sidelink PC5 may be an alternative to Uu based
communication.
Functions in trusted DNs are trusted by the operator's network as
illustrated.. Therefore, AFs in trusted DNs may directly communicate with all
5G Core functions.
Functions in external DNs may only communicate with 5G Core functions via the
NEF using N33.
Figure 4.3.2-1: 5G-XR functions integrated in 5G System
NOTE 1: The functions indicated by the yellow filled boxes are in potential
scope of stage 3 specifications for 5G-XR. The functions indicated by the grey
boxes are defined in 5G System specifications. The functions indicated by the
blue boxes are assigned to the applications.
The above architecture is used as a starting point. With XR related functions
exclusively assigned to either DN or UE. However, architectural extensions may
be identified for the 3GPP system that may benefit from XR applications.
Examples include the use of network slicing, edge computing or usage of 5G
quality of service.
Figure 4.3.2-2: 5G-XR Interfaces and Architecture
A basic XR architecture integrated in 5G is shown in Figure 4.3.2-2.
The following functions may be considered to be defined:
\- 5G-XR Client on UE: Receiver of 5G-XR session data that may be accessed
through well-defined interfaces/APIs by the 5G-XR Aware Application.
\- The 5G-XR Client contains two sub-functions
\- XR Session Handler: A function of the UE that communicates with the 5G-XR
AF in order to establish, control and support the delivery of an XR session.
The XR Session Handler exposes APIs that can be used by the 5G-XR Aware
Application.
\- XR Engine: A function of the UE that communicates with the 5G-XR
Application Server in order to get access to XR related data, includes XR
relevant functionalities such as sensors and tracking, processes this data and
communicates with the XR Session Handler for XR session control.
\- 5G-XR Aware Application: The 5G-XR Client is typically controlled by an
external XR aware application, e.g. an App, which implements the external
application service provider specific logic and enables establishing an XR
session. The 5G-XR Aware Application makes use of 5G-XR Client and network
functions using interfaces and APIs.
\- 5G-XR AS: An Application Server which hosts 5G-XR media and media
functions.
\- 5G-XR Application Provider: External XR application provider that makes use
of 5G-XR client and network functionalities to provide an XR experience to the
5G-XR Aware applications.
\- 5G-XR AF: provides various control functions to the XR Session Handler on
the UE and/or to the 5G-XR Application Provider. It may relay or initiate a
request for different Policy or Charging Function (PCF) treatment or interact
with other network functions.
In the context of the above, 5G radio may also be differentiated between 5G Uu
and 5G Sidelink/PC5. Uu is the interface between User Equipement (UE) and
Radio Access Network (RAN) as defined in 3GPP TS 38.300 [24]. Sidelink is a
mode of communication whereby UEs can communicate with each other directly as
defined in 3GPP TS 38.300 [24].
### 4.3.3 Quality-of-Service in 5G
Clause 5.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] explains the QoS model for 5G. The 5G QoS
model is based on QoS Flows. The 5G QoS model supports both:
\- QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS Flows)
\- and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate (Non-GBR QoS
Flows).
The 5G QoS model also supports Reflective QoS (see clause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS
23.501 [8]).
A QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS Flow in the 5G System. User
Plane traffic assigned to the same QoS Flow within a Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
Session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment **_(e.g._** scheduling,
admission threshold).
The QFI may be dynamically assigned or may be equal to the 5G QoS Identifier
(5QI). A QoS Flow may either be \'GBR\', \'Non-GBR\' or "Delay Tolerant GBR"
depending on its QoS profile and it contains QoS parameters as follows:
> \- For each QoS Flow, the QoS profile includes the QoS parameters:
>
> \- 5G QoS Identifier (5QI); and
>
> \- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).
>
> \- For each Non-GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include the QoS
> parameter:
>
> \- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA).
>
> \- For each GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile also include the QoS
> parameters:
>
> \- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - uplink (UL) and downlink (DL); and
>
> \- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) - UL and DL; and
>
> \- In the case of a GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile can also include one
> or more of the QoS parameters:
>
> \- Notification control;
>
> \- Maximum Packet Loss Rate - UL and DL
The one-to-one mapping of standardized 5QI values to 5G QoS characteristics is
specified in table 5.7.4-1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] and shown below in Table
4.3.3-1.
5QI values potentially relevant for XR applications in the context of this
Technical Report are highlighted in _italics_.

The applicability of 5QI and potential gaps for XR Services over 5G are
analysed further in this Technical Report.
### 4.3.4 5G Media Delivery
In the context of this Technical Report and the delivery options identified in
clause 4.3.3.1, the first three basic delivery types -- download, passive
streaming and interactive streaming -- are most suitably mapped to 5G Media
Streaming as defined in 3GPP TS 26.501 [8] and associated stage 3
specifications. The applicability of 5G Media Streaming for XR applications
and potential necessary extensions are identified in clauses 5, 6 and 7 of
this Technical Report.
Conversational services are most suitably mapped to the Multimedia Telephony
Service for IMS (MTSI) as defined in 3GPP TS 22.173 [24] with focus on XR
media handling (e.g. signalling, transport, codecs, formates) when using 3GPP
access, in particular 5G radio technologies. It is expected that the media
handling of MTSI clients as defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [25] may be suitably
extended in order to support XR applications and services.
### 4.3.5 Edge Computing
Beyond the use of Application Servers as defined in 5G Media Streaming today,
the 5G-XR application may benefit from additional processing in the edge. In
an example, as shown in Figure 4.3.5-1, an edge platform may be offered by the
5G network operator to support XR services served from the content provider or
from the cloud.
Figure 4.3.5-1 Cloud and Edge Processing
In the context of Release-17, 3GPP work is ongoing in order to identify the
integration of edge processing in 5G systems. 3GPP TR 23.748 [28] defines the
necessary modifications to 5G system architecture to enhance Edge Computing.
This work is currently in study phase, defining key issues and scope for
Release-17. Specifically, this study is investigating mechanisms to discover
connectivity to available Edge Computing resources (e.g. using DNS), mobility
improvements for both UE consuming Edge Computing services and for Edge
Application Servers, and for network capability exposure towards the Edge
Application Server.
In addition, in 3GPP TR 23.758 [27] and 3GPP TS 23.558 [29] a new set of
application layer interfaces for Edge Computing are identified that may
potentially be useful for integration of Edge Computing. Specifically, the
interfaces will enable application-layer discovery of Edge Application
Servers, capability exposure towards the Edge Application Server, and
procedures for onboarding, registration, and lifecycle management of Edge
Applications.
The activities detailed in the present clause are intended to be application-
neutral (i.e. to provide generic solutions for any use of Edge Computing
platforms). The media aspects for using Edge Computing are not identified in
these studies and information in the present Technical Report may be
beneficial to contribute to Edge Computing for media processing. In
particular, split Compute/Rendering architectures are not yet specified in the
5G System architecture beyond those being part of a 5G-XR aware application.
Integration of computational resources into the 5G System as part of Edge
Computing functionalities are currently under study in 3GPP. The present
Technical Report serves to identify potentially relevant functions for XR
applications when using Edge Computing and rendering.
## 4.4 XR Engines and Rendering
### 4.4.1 Introduction
XR engines provide a middleware that abstracts hardware and software
functionalities for developers of XR applications. In the market as understood
when initially writing this report, such engines are predominantly based on
proprietary and commercial solutions, but with a trend towards providing
standardized abstraction layers and APIs, notably provided by Khronos\' OpenXR
[16] as well as W3C\'s WebXR [17]. An overview of the landscape as seen by the
OpenXR community is shown in Figure 4.4.1-1.
Figure 4.4.1-1: XR engine and ecosystem landscape today and in the future as
seen by OpenXR © Khronos
An XR engine is a software-development environment designed for people to
build XR experiences such as games and other XR applications. The core
functionality typically provided by XR engines include a rendering engine
(\"renderer\") for 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detection
(and collision response), sound, scripting, animation, artificial
intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, threading,
localization support, scene graph, and may include video support.
Typical components are summarized below
\- Rendering engine: This engine basically provides the functionalities as
documented in clause 4.2.2 with a set of well defined APIs. In summary, the
rendering engine generates animated 3D graphics by any of a number of methods
(rasterization, ray-tracing etc.). Instead of being programmed and compiled to
be executed on the CPU or GPU directly, most often rendering engines are built
upon one or multiple rendering application programming interfaces (APIs), such
as Direct3D, OpenGL, or Vulkan which provide a software abstraction of the
graphics processing unit (GPU).
\- Audio engine: The audio engine is the component which consists of
algorithms related to the loading, modifying and output of sound through the
client\'s speaker system. At a minimum it is able to load, decompress and play
sound files. More advanced audio engines can calculate and produce such
configurations as Doppler effects, echoes, pitch/amplitude adjustments,
oscillation, etc. The audio engine can perform calculations on the CPU, or on
a dedicated ASIC. Abstraction APIs, such as OpenAL, SDL audio, XAudio 2, Web
Audio, etc. are available.
\- Physics engine: The physics engine is responsible for emulating the laws of
physics realistically within the XR application. Specifically, it provides a
set of functions for simulating physical forces and collisions, acting on the
various objects within the scene at run time.
\- Artificial intelligenc _e (AI)_ : AI is usually outsourced from the main XR
engine into a special module. XR applications may implement very different AI
systems, and thus, AI is considered to be specific to the particular XR
application for which it is created.
One of the major game engines used to create several notable games such as
Fortnite ™, PlayerUnknown\'s Battlegrounds ™, and Life is Strange 2 ™, is the
_Unreal Engine 4 ™_. Another game engine with significant share is the _Unity
™_ engine. This engine is the one behind games such as Rust ™, Subnautica ™,
and Life is Strange Before the Storm ™. Unity™ is a cross-platform XR engine
developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005. A
component of Unity are scriptable rendering pipelines for developers to create
high-end graphics including high-end ones for consoles and PC experiences, as
well as the lightweight ones for mobile, virtual reality, augmented reality,
and mixed reality.
The Unreal Engine was first showcased in the 1998 first-person shooter game
Unreal. Although initially developed for first-person shooters, it is used in
a variety of other genres, including platformers, fighting games, MMORPGs, and
other RPGs.
Figure 4.4.1-2 provides an overview of typical CPU and GPU operations for XR
applications.
Figure 4.4.1-2: CPU and GPU operations for XR applications
As mentioned above, key aspects of such XR engines and abstraction layers is
the integration of advanced functionalities for new XR experiences including
video, sound, scripting, networking, streaming, localization support, and
scene graphs. By well-defined APIs, XR engines may also be distributed, where
part of the functionality is hosted in the network on an XR Server and other
parts of the functionality are carried out in the XR device.
GPU operations and rendering is dealt with in clause 4.4.2.
In the remainder of this Technical Report, the term _XR engine_ is used to
provide any type of typical XR functionalities as mentioned above. A key issue
is the functional integration of potentially 3GPP defined technologies,
including well defined APIs and interfaces for the usability and benefit of XR
application developers.
### 4.4.2 Briefly on Rendering Pipelines
Rendering or graphics pipelines are basically built by a sequence of shaders
that operate on different buffers in order to create a desired output. Shaders
are a type of computer programs that were originally used for shading (the
production of appropriate levels of light, darkness, and colour within an
image), but which now perform a variety of programmable functions in various
fields of computer graphics as well as image and video processing.
The input to the shaders is handled by the application, which decides what
kind of data each stage of the rendering pipeline should operate on. Typically
this data is 3D assets consisting of geometric primitives and material
components. The application controls the rendering by providing the shaders
with instructions describing how models should be transformed and projected on
a 2D surface.
Generally there are 2 types of rendering pipelines (i) rasterization rendering
and (ii) ray-traced rendering (a.k.a. ray-tracing) as shown in Figure 4.2-1.
\- _Rasterization_ is the task of taking an image described in a vector
graphics format (shapes) and converting it into a raster image (a series of
pixels, which, when displayed together, create the image which was represented
via shapes). The rasterized image may then be displayed on a computer display,
video display or printer, stored in a bitmap file format, or processed and
encoded by regular 2D image and video codecs.
\- _Ray tracing_ heavy pipelines are typically considered as more
computationally expensive thus less suitable for real-time rendering. However,
in recent years real-time ray tracing has leaped forward due to improved
hardware support and advances in ray tracing algorithms and post-processing.
However, there are several flavors to each type of rendering and they may in
some cases be combined to generate hybrid pipelines. Generally both pipelines
process similar data; the input consists of geometric primitives such as
triangles and their material components. The main difference is that
rasterization focuses to enable real-time rendering at a desired level of
quality, whereas ray tracing is likely to be used to mimic light transmission
to produce more realistic images.

### 4.4.3 Real-time 3D Rendering
3D rendering is the process of converting 3D models into 2D images to be
presented on a display. 3D rendering may include photorealistic or non-
photorealistic styles. Rendering is the final process of creating the actual
2D image or animation from the prepared scene, i.e. creating the viewport.
Rendering ranges from the distinctly non-realistic wireframe rendering through
polygon-based rendering, to more advanced techniques such as ray tracing. The
2D rendered viewport image is simply a two dimensional array of pixels with
specific colours.
Typically, rendering needs to happen in real-time for video and interactive
data. Rendering for interactive media, such as games and simulations, is
calculated and displayed in real-time, at rates of approximately 20 to 120
frames per second. The primary goal is to achieve a desired level of quality
at a desired minimum rendering speed. The impact of the frame rate for the
rendering pipeline is discussed in details in clause 4.2.2. The rapid increase
in computer processing power and in the number of new algorithms has allowed a
progressively higher degree of realism even for real-time rendering. Real-time
rendering is often based on rasterization and aided by the computer\'s GPU.
Animations for non-interactive media, such as feature films and video, can
take much more time to render. Non real-time rendering enables use of brute-
force ray tracing to obtain a higher image quality.
However, in the context of XR in this Technical Report, the assumption of
rendering is to be real-time to react to updated XR pose information, updates
in the scene as produced, and so on.
### 4.4.4 Network Rendering and Buffer Data
In several applications, rendering or pre-rendering is not exclusively carried
out in the device GPU, but assisted or split across the network. If this is
the case, then the following aspects matter:
\- The type of buffers that are pre-rendered/baked in the network. Typical
buffer formats are summarized below.
\- The format of the buffer data. Again, some data is collected below.
\- The number of parallel buffers that are handled
\- Specific delay requirements of each of the buffers
\- The dimensions of the buffers in terms of size and time
\- The ability to compress the buffers using conventional video codecs.
Typical buffers are summarized in the following:
\- _Vertex Buffer_ : A rendering resource managed by a rendering API holding
vertex data. May be connected by primitive indices to assemble rendering
primitives such as triangle strips.
\- _Depth Buffer_ : A bitmap image holding depth values (either a Z buffer or
a W buffer), used for visible surface determination, during rasterization of
3D scenes.
\- _Texture Buffer_ : A region of memory (or resource) used as both a render
target and a texture map. A texture map is defined as an image/rendering
resource used in texture mapping, applied to 3D models and indexed by UV
mapping for 3D rendering. Texture/Image represents a set of pixels. Texture
buffers have assigned parameters to specify creation of an Image. It can be
1D, 2D or 3D, can have various pixel formats (like R8G8B8A8_UNORM or
R32_SFLOAT) and can also consist of many discrete images, because it can have
multiple array layers or MIP levels (or both). As an example, detailed formats
for Vulkan are provided here:
\- https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/html/chap33.html
\-
https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.0.30.0/linux/vkspec.chunked/ch31s03.html
\- _Frame Buffer_ : a region of memory containing a bitmap that drives a video
display. These frame buffers are in raster formats, i.e. they are the result
of rasterization. It is a memory buffer containing a complete frame of data.
Frame buffers are supported by swap chains being a series of virtual frame
buffers utilized by the graphics card and graphics API for frame rate
stabilization and several other functions. In every swap chain there are at
least two buffers. The first frame buffer, the screen buffer, is the buffer
that is rendered to the output of the video card. The remaining buffers are
known as backbuffers. Each time a new frame is displayed, the first backbuffer
in the swap chain takes the place of the screenbuffer, this is called
presentation or swapping. A variety of other actions may be taken on the
previous screenbuffer and other backbuffers (if they exist). The screen buffer
may be simply overwritten or returned to the back of the swap chain for
further processing. The action taken is decided by the client application and
is API dependent.
\- _Uniform Buffer_ : A Buffer Object that is used to store uniform data for a
shader program. It can be used to share uniforms between different programs,
as well as quickly change between sets of uniforms for the same program
object. A uniform is a global Shader variable declared with the \"uniform\"
storage qualifier. These act as parameters that the user of a shader program
can pass to that program. Uniforms are so named because they do not change
from one shader invocation to the next within a particular rendering call.
In MPEG, work has started on integration of timed media into XR scenes in
order to provide input to rendering buffers through network APIs, for example
by retrieving 2D or 3D compressed data.
## 4.5 2D Compression Technologies
### 4.5.1 Core Compression Technologies
This clause provides an overview of core 2D video compression technologies
that are available on mobile platforms as well as their performance. For
power-efficient and best performance, encoding and decoding is preferably
exclusively carried out in hardware. This clause reviews the 3GPP
specifications, actual hardware availability as well as the performance of
codecs.
As of today, two codecs are prominently referenced and available, namely
H.264/AVC [30] and H.265/HEVC [31]. Both codecs are defined as part of the TV
Video Profiles in 3GPP TS 26.116 [32] and are also the foundation of the VR
Video Profiles in 3GPP TS 26.118 [3]. The highest defined profiles are:
\- H.264/AVC Progressive High Profile Level 5.1 [30] with the following
additional restrictions and requirements:
\- the maximum VCL Bit Rate is constrained to be 120Mbps with cpbBrVclFactor
and cpbBrNalFactor being fixed to be 1250 and 1500, respectively.
\- the bitstream does not contain more than 10 slices per picture
\- H.265/HEVC Main-10 Profile Main Tier Profile Level 5.1 [31] without any
restrictions
These profiles and levels basically permit the delivery of video formats up to
4K at 60 frames per second. In modern mobile CPUs, the above profile/level
combinations are supported, and recently even extended to support 8K video.
An overview of typical coding performance is provided in Table 4.5-1.
**Table 4.5-1: Expected Video coding standards performance and bitrate

A more detailed analysis of video codec performance is FFS.
Work on video compression technologies beyond the capabilities of HEVC [31]
are continued by the MPEG/ITU. For example, the Joint Video Exploration Team
(JVET) initiated the work on the development of a new video coding standard,
to be known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC). In addition, MPEG started working
on a new video coding standard to be known as MPEG-5 Essential Video Coding
(EVC) in January 2019. Also noteworthy is the improvement of encoders over
time even for existing standards which also leads to bitrate reductions at the
same quality.
Based on this information it can be expected that within the time frame until
2025, video compression technology will permit bitrate reductions by a factor
of 50% compared to what is today possible with HEVC [31].
On top of regular lossy video compression algorithms, low-latency, low-
complexity and near lossless codecs are important for certain applications. As
an example, JPEG XS is a recent standard for visually lossless low-latency
lightweight image coding. According to
https://jpeg.org/static/whitepapers/jpeg-xs-whitepaper.pdf, such a codec
permits simple yet efficient coding, keeps latency and complexity very low and
at the same time achieves visually lossless quality at compression ratios up
to 10:1.
Furthermore, for XR formats beyond regular 2D, two different approaches are
taken in the compression
1) usage of existing 2D codecs and providing pre- and post-processing in order
to convert the signals to 3D signals
2) usage of dedicated compression technologies for specific formats.
More details on these issues are discussed in clause 4.6.
### 4.5.2 Format and Parallel Decoding Challenges
In XR type of applications, when buffers are processed by rendering engines,
existing video codecs may be used to efficiently compress them when they need
to be transmitted over the network. As typically a huge amount of data is
exchanged and operation needs to be done in a power-efficient manner in
constraint environments (see clause 4.8), XR applications rely on existing
video codecs on mobile platforms, for example those codecs defined in 3GPP
specifications (see clause 4.5.1). While serving an immediate need and
providing a kickstart for XR type of services, such video codecs may not be
fully suitable for XR applications for different reasons, some of them listed
below.
First of all, the formats of the buffers in XR and graphics applications may
be different and more variety exists, see clause 4.4.4. Also in certain case,
not only textures need to be supported, but also 3D formats, see clause 4.6.
Beyond this, XR applications may require that multiple buffers are served and
synchronized in order to render an XR experience. This results in requirements
for parallel decoding of multiple streams for multiple buffers (texture,
geometry, etc.) as well as multiple objects. In many cases these buffers need
to be made available to the rendering engine in a synchronized manner to
ensure the highest quality of the rendered scene. Furthermore, the amount of
streams and data to be processed may vary heavily over the period of an XR
session and requires flexible video decoding architectures, also taking into
account efficient and low-latency processing.
As an example, MPEG is addressing several of these challenges as part of their
MPEG-I project on immersive media coding. In particular, for the variety of
applications, a flexible and powerful hardware based decoding and processing
architecture is desirable.
## 4.6 3D and XR Visual Formats
### 4.6.1 Introduction
This clause introduces 3D and XR visual formats. Both, static images as well
as video formats are introduced. In all cases it is assumed that the visual
signal is provided as a sequence of pictures with a specific frame rate in
frames per second. The chosen frame rate may be a matter of the production of
the video, or it may be based on requirements due to interactions with the
content, for example in case of conversational applications or when using
split rendering.
### 4.6.2 Omnidirectional Visual Formats
#### 4.6.2.1 Introduction
Omnidirectional formats have been introduced in 3GPP TS 26.118 [3], clause
4.1, as well as in 3GPP TR 26.928 [2], clause 4.2.5.
#### 4.6.2.2 Definition
Omnidirectional visual signals are represented in a spherical coordinate space
in angular coordinates (ϕ,θ). The viewing is from the origin of the sphere,
looking outward. Even though a spherical coordinate is generally represented
by using radius, elevation, and azimuth, it assumes that a unit sphere is used
for capturing and rendering. Thus, a location of a point on the unit sphere is
identified by using the sphere coordinates azimuth (φ) and elevation (θ).
For video, such a centre point may exist for each eye, referred to as _stereo_
signal, and the video consists of three colour components, typically expressed
by the luminance (Y) and two chrominance components (U and V).
According to 3GPP TS 26.118 [3], clause 4.1.3, mapping of a spherical picture
to a 2D texture signal is illustrated in Figure 4.6.2-1. The most commonly
used mapping from spherical to 2D is the equirectangular projection (ERP)
mapping. The mapping is bijective, i.e. it may be expressed in both
directions.
Figure 4.6.2-1: Examples of Spherical to 2D mappings
Assume a 2D texture with pictureWidth and pictureHeight, being the width and
height, respectively, of a monoscopic projected luma picture, in luma samples
and the center point of a sample location (i,j) along the horizontal and
vertical axes, respectively, then for the _equirectangular_ projection the
sphere coordinates (φ,θ) for the luma sample location, in degrees, are given
by the following equations:
φ = ( 0.5 − i ÷ pictureWidth ) * 360\ θ = ( 0.5 − j ÷ pictureHeight ) * 180
Whereas ERP is commonly used for production formats, other mappings may be
applied, especially for distribution. For more details on projection formats,
refer to 3GPP TR 26.918 [2], clause 4.2.5.4.
#### 4.6.2.3 Production and Capturing Systems
For production, capturing and stitching of spherical content, refer to 3GPP TR
26.918 [2], clauses 4.2.5.2 and 4.2.5.3.
#### 4.6.2.4 Rendering
Rendering of spherical content depends on the field of view (FoV) of a
rendering device. The pose together with the field of view of the device
enables the system to generate the user viewport, i.e., the presented part of
the content at a specific point in time. According to 3GPP TS 26.118 [3], the
renderer uses the projected texture signals and rendering metadata (projection
information) and provides a viewport presentation taking into account the
viewport and possible other information. With the pose, a user viewport is
determined by identifying the horizontal and vertical fields of view of the
screen of a head-mounted display or any other display device to render the
appropriate part of decoded video or audio signals. For video, textures from
decoded signals are projected to the sphere with rendering metadata received
from the file decoder. During the texture-to-sphere mapping, a sample of the
decoded signal is remapped to a position on the sphere.
Related to the generic rendering approaches in clause 4.2.2, the following
steps are part of the rendering spherical media:
\- Generating a 3D Mesh (set of vertexes linked into triangles) based on the
projection metadata. The sphere is mapped to a mesh and the transformation of
the mesh is dynamically updated based on the updated projection metadata.
\- Mapping each vertex to a position on a 2D texture. This is again done using
the available projection metadata.
\- Rotating the camera to match the user's head orientation. This is based on
the available pose information.
\- Computing the viewport by using computer graphic algorithms as discussed in
details in clause 4.2.2
#### 4.6.2.5 Compression, Storage and Data Formats
According to 3GPP TS 26.118 [3], clause 4.1.3, commonly used video encoders
cannot directly encode spherical videos, but only 2D textures. However, there
is a significant benefit to reuse conventional 2D video encoders. Based on
this, Figure 4.6.2-2 provides the basic video signal representation in the
context of omnidirectional video in the context of the present document. By
pre-processing, the spherical video is mapped to a 2D texture. The 2D texture
is encoded with a regular 2D video encoder and the VR rendering metadata (i.e.
the data describing the mapping from the spherical coordinate to the 2D
texture) is encoded and provided along with the video bitstream, such that at
the receiving end the inverse process can be applied to reconstruct the
spherical video.
Figure 4.6.2-2: Video Signal Representation
Compression, storage and data formats are defined for example in 3GPP TS
26.118 [3] as well as in ISO/IEC 23090-2 [37]. This includes viewport-
independent and viewport-dependent compression formats. A principle overview
of different approaches is documented in 3GPP TR 26.918 [2], clause 4.2.5.6.
#### 4.6.2.6 Quality and Bitrate considerations
According to clause 4.2.1, 1k by 1k per eye is a minimum for the signal in the
viewport, and for stereoscopic rendering this results in basically a signal
for 2k by 1k, typically at a frame rate of 50 or 60fps.With current codecs
according to clause 4.5.1, the pure viewport data can be represented with
around 4-10 Mbit/s. However, a viewport typically only covers around 100
degree horizontal and 60 degree vertical. Hence, to present a full
omnidirectional presentation, about 20 times more data may be necessary,
leading to 80 -- 200 Mbit/s. Viewport-dependent coding and delivery, in
particular tiling, can support to reduce the required bitrates.
#### 4.6.2.7 Applications
For use cases and applications, see 3GPP TR 26.918 [2], clause 5.
### 4.6.3 3D Meshes
#### 4.6.3.1 Introduction
A polygon mesh is a collection of vertices, edges and faces that defines the
shape of a polyhedral object in 3D computer graphics and solid modeling. The
faces usually consist of triangles (triangle mesh), quadrilaterals (quads), or
other simple convex polygons (n-gons), since this simplifies rendering, but
may also be more generally composed of concave polygons, or even polygons with
holes.
#### 4.6.3.2 Definition
Objects created with polygon meshes are represented by different types of
elements. These include vertices, edges, faces, polygons and surfaces as shown
in Figure 4.6.3-1. In many applications, only vertices, edges and either faces
or polygons are stored.

Polygon meshes are defined by the following elements:
\- **_Vertex_** : A position in 3D space defined as (x,y,z) along with other
information such as colour (r,g,b), normal vector and texture coordinates.
\- **_Edge_** : A connection between two vertices.
\- **_Face_** : A closed set of edges, in which a triangle face has three
edges, and a quad face has four edges. A polygon is a coplanar set of faces.
In systems that support multi-sided faces, polygons and faces are equivalent.
Mathematically a polygonal mesh may be considered as an unstructured grid, or
undirected graph, with additional properties of geometry, shape and topology.
\- **_Surfaces_** : or smoothing groups, are useful, but not required to group
smooth regions.
\- **_Groups_** : Some mesh formats contain groups, which define separate
elements of the mesh, and are useful for determining separate sub-objects for
skeletal animation or separate actors for non-skeletal animation.
\- **_Materials_** : defined to allow different portions of the mesh to use
different shaders when rendered.
\- UV coordinates: Most mesh formats also support some form of UV coordinates
which are a separate 2D representation of the mesh \"unfolded\" to show what
portion of a 2-dimensional texture map to apply to different polygons of the
mesh. It is also possible for meshes to contain other such vertex attribute
information such as colour, tangent vectors, weight maps to control animation,
etc (sometimes also called channels).
#### 4.6.3.3 Production and Capturing Systems
Meshes are commonly produced by many different graphics engines, computer
games, and so on. For more details, see also clause 4.6.7.
#### 4.6.3.4 Rendering
Meshes can be rendered directly on GPUs that are highly optimized for mesh-
based rendering.
#### 4.6.3.5 Storage and Data Formats
##### 4.6.3.5.1 Introduction
Polygon meshes may be represented in a variety of ways, using different
methods to store the vertex, edge and face data such as face-vertex, winged,
half or quad-edge meshes, corner-table or vertex-vertex meshes. Different
formats also store other per vertex and materials related data in different
ways. Each of the representations have particular advantages and drawbacks.
The choice of the data structure is governed by the application, the required
performance, the size of the data, and the operations to be performed. For
example, it is easier to deal with triangles than general polygons. For
certain operations it is necessary to have a fast access to topological
information such as edges or neighboring faces; this requires more complex
structures such as the winged-edge representation. For hardware rendering,
compact, simple structures are needed and are as such commonly incorporated
into low-level rendering APIs such as DirectX and OpenGL.
Many different formats for storage and data formats exist for storing polygon
mesh data, as an example PLY-format is introduced below, because it provides
3D data in a human readable format. In practice PLY-format is rarely used in
real-time rendering. Typically the data format is configured to the need of
the 3D engine and as such the landscape is littered with proprietary 3D
formats. 3D formats may be roughly divided in two categories, run time
friendly formats such as glTF and formats which enable transferring 3D assets
between systems like PLY.
##### 4.6.3.5.2 PoLYgon (PLY) File Format
The PoLYgon (PLY) format (see http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/) is used
to describe a 3D object as a list of vertices, faces and other elements, along
with associated attributes. A single PLY file describes exactly one 3D object.
The 3D object may be generated synthetically or captured from a real scene.
Attributes of the 3D object elements that might be stored with the object
include: colour, surface normals, texture coordinates, transparency, etc. The
format permits one object to have different properties for the front and back
of a polygon.
The PLY does not intend to act as a Scene Graph, so it does not include
transformation matrices, multiple 3D objects, modeling hierarchies, or object
sub-parts. A typical PLY object definition is a list of **(x,y,z,r,g,b)**
triples for vertices and their colour attributes (r,g,b), so they represent a
point cloud. It may also include a list of faces that are described by indices
into the list of the vertices. Vertices and faces are primary elements of the
3D object representation.
PLY allows applications to create new attributes that are attached to the
elements of an object. New attributes are appended to the list of attributes
of an element, in a way to maintain backwards compatibility. Attributes that
are not understood by a parser are simply skipped.
Furthermore, PLY allows for extensions to create new element types and their
associated attributes. Examples of such elements could be materials (ambient,
diffuse and specular colours and coefficients). New elements can also be
discarded by programs that do not understand them.
A PLY file is structured as follows:
_Header_
_Vertex List_
_Face List_
_(lists of other elements)_
The header is a human-readable textual description of the PLY file. It
contains a description of each element type, including the element\'s name
(e.g. \"vertex\"), how many of such elements are in the object, and a list of
the various attributes associated with the element. The header also indicates
whether the file is in binary or ASCII format. A list of elements for each
element type follows the header in the order described in the header.
The following is an example PLY in binary format with 19928 vertices and 39421
faces:
+-----------------------------------------+ | ply | | | | format binary_little_endian 1.0 | | | | comment generated by 3GPP | | | | element vertex 19928 | | | | property float x | | | | property float y | | | | property float z | | | | property float nx | | | | property float ny | | | | property float nz | | | | property int flags | | | | property uchar red | | | | property uchar green | | | | property uchar blue | | | | property uchar alpha | | | | element face 39421 | | | | property list uchar int vertex_indices | | | | property int flags | | | | end_header | | | | ... | +-----------------------------------------+
This example demonstrates the different components of a PLY file header. Each
part of the header is a carriage-return terminated ASCII string that begins
with a keyword. In case of binary representation, the file will be a mix of an
ASCII header and binary representation of the elements, in little or big
endian, depending on the architecture on which the PLY file has been
generated. The PLY file must start with the characters \"ply\".
The vertex attributes listed in this example are the (x,y,z) floating point
coordinates, the (nx,ny,nz) representation of the normal vectors, a 32 bit
flag mask, (r,g,b) 8-bit representations of the colour of each vertex, an
8-bit representation of the transparency alpha channel. Faces are represented
as a list of vertex indices with a flags attribute associated with each face.
#### 4.6.3.6 Texture Formats
Different GPUs may support different texture formats, both raw and compressed.
Raw formats include different representations of the RGB colour space, e.g.
8/16/32 bit representations of each colour component, with or without alpha
channel, float or integer, regular or normalized, etc.
Typical GPU texture compression formats include BC1, PVRTC, ETC2/EAC, and
ASTC. Other image compression formats such as JPEG and PNG need to be
decompressed and passed to the GPU in a format that it supports.
Recently, the Basis Universal GPU texture format has been defined. This format
also supports video texture compression. As decoding happens on the GPU, the
application will benefit from reduced CPU load and CPU to GPU memory copy
delay.
#### 4.6.3.8 Bitrate and Quality Considerations
Bitrates and quality considerations for meshes are FFS.
#### 4.6.3.7 Applications
Meshes are used in many applications.
### 4.6.4 Point Clouds
A point cloud is a collection of data points defined by a given coordinates
system. In a 3D coordinates system, for example, a point cloud may define the
shape of some real or created physical system. Point clouds are used to create
3D meshes and other models used in 3D modeling for various fields including
medical imaging, architecture, 3D printing, manufacturing, 3D gaming and
various XR applications.
Point clouds are often aligned with 3D models or with other point clouds, a
process known as point set registration. In computer vision and pattern
recognition, point set registration, also known as point matching, is the
process of finding a spatial transformation that aligns two-point sets. The
purpose of finding such a transformation includes merging multiple data sets
into a globally consistent model, and mapping a new measurement to a known
data set to identify features or to estimate its pose. Point set registration
is used in augmented reality.
An overview on point cloud definitions, formats, production and capturing
systems, rendering, bitrate/quality considerations and applications is for
example provided in [38]. According to this document, media-related use cases
may usually contain between 100,000 and 10,000,000 point locations and colour
attributes with 8-10 bits per colour component, along with as some sort of
temporal information, similar to frames in a video sequence. For navigation
purposes, it is possible to generate a 3D map by combining depth measurements
from a high-density laser scanner, e.g. LIDAR, camera captured images and
localization data measured with GPS and an inertial measurement unit (IMU).
Such maps can further be combined with road markings such as lane information
and road signs to create maps to enable autonomous navigation of vehicles
around a city. This use case requires the capture of millions to billions of
3D points with up to 1 cm precision, together with additional attributes,
namely colour with 8-12 bits per colour component, surface normals and
reflectance properties attributes. According to the paper, depending on the
sequence, compression factors between 1:100 to 1:500 are feasible for media-
related applications. According to the same paper, bitrates for single objects
with such compression methods are in the range of 8 to 20 Mbit/s.
For production of point clouds, see also clause 4.6.7.
### 4.6.5 Light Fields
An overview on light-field technology is for example provided in
https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/sites/default/files/events/7.%20MPEG127-WS_MehrdadTeratani.pdf.
### 4.6.6 Scene Description
Scene Descriptions are often called scene graphs due to their representation
as graphs. A scene graph is a directed acyclic graph, usually just a plain
tree-structure, that represents an object-based hierarchy of the geometry of a
scene. The leaf nodes of the graph represent geometric primitives such as
polygons. Each node in the graph holds pointers to its children. The child
nodes can among others be a group of other nodes, a geometry element, a
transformation matrix, etc.
Spatial transformations are represented as nodes of the graph and represented
by a transformation matrix. Other Scene Graph nodes include 3D objects or
parts thereof, light sources, particle systems, viewing cameras, ...
This structure of scene graphs has the advantage of reduced processing
complexity, e.g. while traversing the graph for rendering. An example
operation that is simplified by the graph representation is the culling
operation, where branches of the graph are dropped from processing, if deemed
that the parent node's space is not visible or relevant (level of detail
culling) to the rendering of the current view frustum.
Scene descriptions permit generation of many different 3D scenes for XR
applications. As an example, glTF from Khronos [39] is a widely adopted scene
description specification and is now adopted by MPEG as the baseline for their
extensions to integrate real-time media into scenes.
### 4.6.7 Production and Capturing Systems for 3D Mesh and Point Clouds
#### 4.6.7.1 Overview
In order to capture a 3D mesh in a production facility using stereo cameras,
an array of multiple cameras is placed around a recording space. A subject
(for example an actor) is recorded inside the recoding space. Figure 4.6.7-1
shows an outline of one of the prototype studios as well as some example
images from a production plant. In the left of Figure 4.6.7-1 a rotunda-like
recording space is shown, in which multiple cameras are placed around the
peripherals of the space.

Figure 4.6.7-1: Example of a capture and production facility for Point Cloud/
3D meshes
A multi-camera or multi-stereo-camera pairs setup serves as a stereo camera
base unit. Each stereo camera pair records the subject(s) from a different
viewpoint. For example, Figure 4.6.7-2 shows different image captures from
different multi-camera setup taken at one time instance. The volumetric
capture studio has an integrated illuminated background for lightning.

4.6.7-2: Example of the 32 images captured simultaneously at one time instance
in a studio**
Figure 4.6.7-3 illustrates the 3D mesh production workflow. After the capture,
a foreground and background segmentation process is performed in the 'keying'
stage. A 'depth estimator' is applied to the captured images from each stereo
pair to generate depth information with high accuracy for each pixel. From
each stereo camera pair, the 3D information is stored as a colour-coded depth
value in a 2D image. For example, a resulting depth map image from a stereo
camera pair is shown in Figure 4.6.7-4.\ \ {width="6.152777777777778in"

Figure 4.6.7-4: Example of a dense depth map calculated per frame for each
stereo camera pair
In the following stage, the depth information from every stereo camera pair is
merged using the initial camera calibration and a related 3D fusion process.
Any 3D point which is occluded by others is filtered out, resulting in an
advanced foreground segmentation.
The result of the 3D fusion process is a 3D Point cloud. The 3D Point cloud is
further processed by different post-processing steps such as meshing, mesh
reduction and texturing, etc as shown in the figure 4.6.7-5. The depth-based
surface reconstruction results in a high-density mesh which consists of a high
number of vertices and faces. In order to simplify the resulting high-density
mesh to a single consistent mesh, a geometric simplification is performed.
This process is called the mesh reduction. The simplified meshes are
texturized using a 2D texture map in a common 2D image file format. In the
final stage of the post-processing, the resulting meshes are temporally
registered to obtain animated meshes.

meshing, simplification and texturing (from second left to right)
## 4.7 3D and XR Audio Formats
For 3D and XR audio formats and systems, refer to 3GPP TR 26.918 [2], clause
4.3 as well as to 3GPP TS 26.118 [3], clause 6.
## 4.8 Devices and Form Factors
### 4.8.1 Device Types
Extended reality devices are of different form factors as shown in Figure
4.8-1. These form factors may differ in processing capabilities, communication
types and power consumption.
The majority of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) devices are
head-mounted displays (HMDs).. In AR, the display is usually transparent and
digital information is superimposed onto real life objects. In VR, the display
is not transparent and only virtual information and images are displayed in
front of wearer\'s eyes. Head-mounted display ( HMD) is a device worn over the
head. It features a display in front of one or both theeyes. The display
streams data, images and other information in front of the wearer\'s eye(s).
Certain HMDs have displays over both of their users\' eyes, others only have a
display over one of the users\' eyes.
Typical components of HMDs are listed as follows:
  * Optical systems: Display and lenses
  * Tracking sensors and possibly additional sensors
  * Cameras
  * XR related processing (summarized as XR engine) including GPUs, CPUs, ASICs (e.g. dedicated media encoding and decoding), etc.
  * Communication functionalities, as for example provided by a 5G System
A _smartphone_ (defined as **_XR5G-P1_** device type) may be used both for AR
as well as for VR (together with a card-board). In both cases, typically an XR
engine/runtime is available to support processing of sensor data, viewport
rendering as well as SLAM processing. In this case, the 5G modem and all
media/XR processing is integrated in the device. Power consumption of such
devices is important, but not ultimately critical due to the onboard battery.
VR HMDs typically provide the a large field of view, stereoscopic 3D imagery
as well as rotational, translational and positional tracking for full 6DoF
experiences. For VR, the following device types are identified:
  * _**XR5G-V1** \- Simple VR Display wired_: Such device types are commonly available in 2019. They only include sensors for tracking as well as a display. The remaining processing is done on a remote device, e.g. a puck or a smartphone. XR/Media Processing, connectivity and power supply are provided through wired tethering.
  * _**XR5G-V2** \- Simple VR Display wireless_: Such device types are not yet available in 2019. They include sensors for tracking, a display, a wireless connection (which could be WiFi based or 5G Sidelink based), and a power supply. The remaining processing is done on a remote device, e.g. a puck or a smartphone.
  * _**XR5G-V3** \- Smart VR Viewer wireless tethering_: Such device types are not yet available in 2019. They include sensors for tracking, a display, a wireless connection (which could be WiFi based or 5G Sidelink based), at least some XR processing, as well as a power supply. The remaining processing is done on a remote device, e.g. a puck or a smartphone.
  * **_XR5G-V4_** \- _VR HMD standalone_ : Such device types are commonly available in 2019, except 5G connectivity. For such devices, the 5G modem, power supply as well as all media/XR processing is expected to be integrated into a single device.
Note that XR5G-V1 and XR5G-V2 are similar in terms of functions, but the
wireless connectivity creates additional challenges and may even be done by a
5G sidelink communication.
An optical head-mounted display is a type of head-mounted display that
projects images and allows the user to see through its display and is used in
augmented reality (AR). Unlike Virtual Reality HMDs that obscures the vision
of the real world, AR devices allow to see the surroundings while streaming
data and image overlays in front of the eyes. Optical head-mounted displays
may cover only 1 eye or both eyes. Wearers can interact with the projected
digital content through input methods such as voice commands, gestures and
controllers.
For AR Glasses, design constraints are significantly more important. In
particular, design constraints apply in terms of sleekness, weight and power.
The processing power is expected to be low to avoid battery consumption and
thermal dissipation. Wireless AR glasses are commercially compelling. AR is
typically associated to using glasses, also referred to as optical see-
through. However, AR experiences may be achieved using HMDs with video-see
through functionalities. A comparison of different types is for example
provided in [40]. The following device types are identified:
  * _**XR5G-A1** \- Simple AR Wearable Glass wired_: Such device types are available in 2019. They include a minimum number of sensors, possibly cameras for AR localization, as well as a display. Power, XR processing and connectivity is supplied from an external source.
  * _**XR5G-A2** \- Simple AR Wearable Glass wireless_: Such device types are not available in 2019 and are still far out. They would include a minimum number of sensors, possibly cameras for AR localization, power supply, as well as a wireless modem for connectivity. XR processing, AR localization as well as network connectivity is provided by external means, e.g. a puck or a smartphone.
  * _**XR5G-A3** \- Smart AR HMD video see-through_: Such device types are an initial entry for AR applications. There are much closer to XR5G-V1 type of devices, but by having cameras projecting the real world on the screen, the VR device can operate as an AR device.
  * _**XR5G-A4** \- AR Wearable Glass standalone_: Such device types are not available in 2019 but are under consideration. For such devices, the 5G modem, power supply, as well as all media/XR processing is expected to be integrated in a single device.
  * _**XR5G-A5** \- Smart AR Wearable Glass wireless_: Such device types are not available in 2019 and are still far out. In addition to an XR5G-A2 device, such a device would include at least a certain amount of XR/Media processing capabilities such as encoders/decoders and XRprocessing.

Figure 4.8-1: XR Form Factors
One of the most important issues when considering form factors and processing
is the ability of the device to dissipate power, especially when no external
cooling is available. Figure 4.8-2 shows the temperature rise depending on the
surface power density. As example, two points on the figure can be considered:
  * At 5C rise over ambient, power density that can be dissipated is 0.023 W/square inch. A smart phone whould have a surface area from 20 to 30 square inch, i.e. the power that can be dissipated is 0.5 to 0.75 Watt.
  * AT 25C rise over ambient, power density that can be dissipated is 0.18 W/square inch. For a smartphone this would allow around 4 to 5 W continuous power dissipation. However, for an AR glass, the surface area is much smaller and so much less power can be dissipated, somewhere in the range of 1W. As an example, in a 25C room, the device enclosure surface temp would be 50C, which is already on the higher end of what is generally considered acceptable.

Figure 4.8-2: Temperature rise vs. power density
A summary of the different device types is provided in Table 4.8-1 along with
tethering examples, placement of 5G Uu modem, XR engine and localization
support, power supply and typical maximum available power. In all device
types, the sensors are on the device. The table also addresses the options
applicable for tethering between the device carrying the 5G Uu Modem, and the
XR device, if applicable. The table also addresses options for the XR engine
that includes scene recognition and viewport rendering. The following
definitions for the XR engine are used:
  * _External_ : the device only supports display and receives a fully rendered viewport data that can be displayed directly. Any scene recognition, if applicable, is not on the device.
  * _Split_ : the external device does a pre-rendering of the viewport based on sensor information and the device does the final rendering considering the latest sensor information. Different degrees of split exist, as discussed before. Similalrly, scene recognition can be subject to split computation.
  * _XR device_ : that device does the full rendering of the viewport in the device, sensor information is only processed locally. Any scene recognition, if applicable, is on the device.

### 4.8.2 Power Consumption
This clause addresses the available power in different XR Device types as well
as the power consumption of typical XR processing functions as identified in
the context of XR services.
When designing media processing, XR functionality and 5G connectivity, it is
important to understand the power consumption of different components that are
possibly integrated in XR devices. The following should be considered:
\- Tracking and Sensing
\- 3DoF tracking may be done with low power consumption, e.g., below 1 Watt
\- 6DoF tracking involving for example, capturing cameras, LEDs for eye and
hand tracking, etc. are more power-consumption intense
\- Display
\- Display power consumption is critical and depends on the device.
\- Display power consumption can be in the range of 0.3W up to 1W
\- Render (GPU)
\- The power consumption of the GPU depends on frame rates, resolution,
display technology
\- The power consumption can be from several mWatt to several Watt depending
on the use case
\- Compute and Media Processing (CPU)
\- Similar observation as for the GPU
\- If encoding is involved, power consumption is typically higher.
\- Connectivity
\- The power consumption of wireless contection such as 5G depends on several
factors including bitrates, distance from radio access network, channel
conditions, frequeny range, etc.
\- The power consumption can be from several mWatt to several Watt depending
on the use case.
It is expected that each of the components will undergo improvements to
address power savings. It is important that in the development of technical
specifications of XR devices, the power consumption of each component is
considered.
## 4.9 Ongoing Standardisation Work
### 4.9.1 Related Work in 3GPP
#### 4.9.2.1 Introduction
This clause summarizes relevant 3GPP activities efforts in the context of XR.
  * 3GPP TR 26.918 [2] provides an introduction to Virtual Reality and 3GPP TS 26.118 [3] defines Virtual Reality Media Profiles for omnidirectional 3DoF media.
  * 3GPP TR 22.842 [6] on Network Controlled Interactive Service (NCIS) analyses several use cases of NCIS as follows: NCIS Service Supporting
    * New Requirements for VR Based NCIS Service
    * Cloud Rendering for Games
    * High Speed Scenario
    * IoE Based Social Networking
    * Communication within NCIS group
> Based on the TR, several requirements are identified for new requirements in
> 3GPP TS 22.261 [41]. Also, KPIs for such services mentioned above are
> documented in clause 6.2 of 3GPP TR 22.842 [6], requiring additional input
> including some information from this TR.
  * In context of Release-17, 3GPP work is ongoing in order to identify the integration of edge processing in 5G systems. 3GPP TR 23.748 [28] defines modifications to 5GS system architecture to enhance Edge Computing. This work is currently in study phase, defining Key Issues and scope for Release-17. In addition, in 3GPP TR 23.758 [27] a new set of application layer interfaces for Edge Computing is identified that may potentially be useful for integration edge computing.
### 4.9.2 Related Work External of 3GPP
#### 4.9.2.1 Introduction
This clause summarizes relevant external standardisation efforts in the
context of XR that may provide certain functionalities being of benefit for
5G-based XR applications.
#### 4.9.2.2 MPEG
##### 4.9.2.2.1 Introduction
In October 2016, MPEG initiated a new project on "Coded Representation of
Immersive Media", referred to as MPEG-I. The proposal was justified by the
emergence of new devices and services that allow users to be immersed in media
and to navigate in multimedia scenes. It was observed that a fragmented market
exists for such devices and services, notably for content that is delivered
"over the top". The project is motivated by the lack of common standards that
do not enable interoperable services and devices providing immersive and
navigable experiences. The MPEG-I project is expected to enable existing
services in an interoperable manner and to support the evolution of
interoperable immersive media services. Enabled by the Parts of this Standard,
end users are expected to be able to access interoperable content and
services, and acquire devices that allow them to consume these.
After the launch of the project, several phases, activities, and projects have
been launched that enable services considered in MPEG-I.
The project is divided in _tracks_ that enable different core experiences.
Each of the phases is supported by key _activities_ in MPEG, namely in
systems, video, audio and 3D graphics-related technologies.
Core technologies as well as additional enablers are implemented in _parts_ of
the MPEG-I standard. Currently the following 14 parts are under development:
  * Part 1 -- Immersive Media Architectures
  * Part 2 -- Omnidirectional MediA Format
  * Part 3 -- Versatile Video Coding
  * Part 4 -- Immersive Audio Coding
  * Part 5 -- Video-Based Point Cloud Coding (V-PCC)
  * Part 6 -- Immersive Media Metrics
  * Part 7 -- Immersive Media Metadata
  * Part 8 -- Network-Based Media Processing
  * Part 9 -- Geometry Point Cloud Coding (G-PCC)
  * Part 10 -- Carriage of Video-based Point Cloud Coding Data
  * Part 11 -- Implementation Guidelines for Network-based Media Processing
  * Part 12 - Carriage of Geometry-based Point Cloud Coding Data
  * Part 13 -- Multi-Decoder Video Decoding Interface for Immersive Media
  * Part 14 -- Scene Description for MPEG Media
In addition, other technical components may be provided in existing MPEG
specifications outside of MPEG-I (e.g., HEVC and AVC) in order to create
interoperable immersive experiences.
#### 4.9.2.3 Khronos
Khronos creates open standards for 3D graphics, Virtual and Augmented Reality,
Parallel Computing, Neural Networks, and Vision Processing. Specifically
relevant for the work on XR are the following activities:
  * _OpenGL®_ is the most widely adopted 2D and 3D graphics API in the industry, bringing thousands of applications to a wide variety of computer platforms. It is window-system and operating-system independent as well as network-transparent. OpenGL enables developers of software for PC, workstation, and supercomputing hardware to create high-performance, visually compelling graphics software applications, in markets such as CAD, content creation, energy, entertainment, game development, manufacturing, medical, and virtual reality. OpenGL exposes all the features of the latest graphics hardware.
  * _Vulkan_ is a new generation graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs used in a wide variety of devices from PCs and consoles to mobile phones and embedded platforms.
  * _OpenXR_ [16] is an open standard that provides high-performance access to Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)---collectively known as XR---platforms and devices.
  * _glTF™_ (GL Transmission Format) [39] is a specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications. glTF minimizes both the size of 3D assets, and the runtime processing needed to unpack and use those assets. glTF defines an extensible, common publishing format for 3D content tools and services that streamlines authoring workflows and enables interoperable use of content across the industry.
#### 4.9.2.4 W3C WebXR
The WebXR Device API Specification (https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/)
[17] provides interfaces to VR and AR hardware to allow developers to build
compelling, comfortable VR/AR experiences on the web. The latest "WebXR Device
API, Editor's Draft, 10 February 2020" is available here https://immersive-
web.github.io/webxr/ and provides an interface to VR/AR hardware. It is no
longer marked as "UNSTABLE API". It also provides a link to WebXR Device API
Explained.

# 5 Core Use Cases and Scenarios for Extended Reality
## 5.1 Introduction
This clause documents core consolidated use cases and scenarios for extended
reality based on the underlying offered functionalities, the nature of the
communication, interactivity and real-time requirements. These have been
derived from the use cases collected in Annex A. Table 5.1-1 lists the core
use cases and the list of the use cases in Annex A covered by each of them.
The following categories and their accompanying illustrations are drawn for
clarity. In actual implementations, elements from more than one system may be
used together. However, it is attempted to ensure that the functionalities
included from any particular use case in Annex A are fully covered within a
single core use case diagram.
The term UE is used to define a 5G-enabled user equipment that meets the
capability requirements of a particular use case. A UE may for example be a
mobile handset, AR glasses or an HMD with or without controllers as documented
in clause 4.3.
Note that depending on the actual UE, the usage scenario may differ slightly.
Some examples of such differences are given in the accompanying text within
each category. Furthermore, in certain cases the capabilities of the devices
may be present on each UE and not restricted to only one side.

### 5.2.1 Summary of Use cases
This clause summarizes and integrates the following use cases from Annex A in
a single core use case referred to as \"Offline Sharing of 3D Objects\":
  * Use Case 1: 3D Image Messaging (see Annex A.2)
  * Use Case 2: AR Sharing (see Annex A.3)
  * Use Case 10: Online shopping from a catalogue -- downloading (see Annex A.10)
### 5.2.2 Description
Offline sharing is used for sharing 3D models/objects and 3D MR scenes amongst
UEs. In Figure 5.2-1, UE A shares a 3D static/dynamic object with UE B. The 3D
object can be a stored object downloaded by UE A from the cloud, or captured
by the device using for example a depth camera. It may include additional
information such as colour, texture, size, etc. of the 3D object, which is
referred to as _effects_ in the figure. Upon receiving, UE B can render this
object (and/or 3D objects it has downloaded from the cloud) in the surrounding
reality using an MR rendering engine; it can choose the desired effects for
the 3D object. It can then capture the rendered MR scene and send it back to
UE A. MMS is used for sharing the 3D object and the captured MR scene between
the UEs. Note that the diagram is drawn for clarity and in reality, the
capabilities of the devices may be present on each UE and not limited only to
one side.
The rendering functionality depends on the type of device. For instance, flat
images on a mobile phone vs. 3D rendering on AR glasses.

## 5.3 Real-time XR Sharing
### 5.3.1 Summary of Use Cases
This clause summarizes and integrates the following use cases from Annex A in
a single core use case referred to as \"Real-time XR Sharing\":
  * Use Case 7: Real-time 3D Communication
  * Use Case 8: AR guided assistant at remote location (industrial services)
  * Use Case 11: Real-time communication with the shop assistant
  * Use Case 17: AR animated avatar calls
  * Use Case 23: 5G Shared Spatial Data
### 5.3.2 Description
UE B is a device capable of XR rendering, such as AR glasses, or a mobile
phone that is sending a real-time video stream of the XR experience to UE A,
as illustrated in Figure 5.3-1. The XR experience is being captured and
rendered by the UE B. The experience includes capture of 3D objects in a 2D
scene. The rendering experience includes (real-time) 3D (static/dynamic)
object placement in a 2D scene, overlay video, avatars, etc., that may be
downloaded from the cloud, or sent by UE A to UE B. A bidirectional or
unidirectional A/V channel may be open between the devices depending on the
use case. The received objects by UE B can be influenced by UE B directly as
well, based on direct or indirect input from the user. UE A also sends a real-
time stream of motion signals and effects that influence the rendering of the
3D object model on UE B. Examples include: 1) head/body motion or facial
expressions resulting in corresponding changes in a dynamic 3D object, e.g. an
avatar, and 2) positioning and size of the 3D object within the XR scene, and
subsequent changes in these parameters such as moving the object closer to a
wall or making it larger. Motion data may be collected using direct input from
the user interface of the device or implicitly using data from camera,
gyroscopes, accelerometer, etc., including gestures. Other predefined effects
for the 3D objects that can be placed on or around it can also be shared from
UE A to UE B or downloaded from the cloud. Network based XR media processing
may be used where required.
In a subset of this scenario where XR is not used, a 3D object may be rendered
within the received video stream, e.g., a 3D representation of the head of a
video call participant.
Shared AR experiences can be realized using a Spatial Computing Server (SCS),
as shown in Figure 5.3-1. Collocated users with AR devices can view and
interact with AR objects in a time synchronized and spatially correct manner
using the SCS. Devices will send positional data updates (e.g. GPS, Wifi,
visual scans etc.) to the SCS. The SCS provides spatial maps, spatial anchors
and localization services to the devices. Spatial data may be crowd-sourced
from multiple devices for higher accuracy in spatial mapping. It should also
be possible to then assign spatial information to AR objects so they can be be
dropped by users at specific locations for later discovery by other visitors.

## 5.4 XR Multimedia Streaming
### 5.4.1 Summary of Use Cases
This clause summarizes and integrates the following use cases from Annex A in
a single core use case referred to as \"XR Multimedia Streaming\":
  * Use Case 3: Streaming of Immersive 6DoF
  * Use Case 4: Emotional Streaming
  * Use Case 20: AR Streaming with Localization Registry
  * Use Case 21: Immersive 6DoF Streaming with Social Interaction
### 5.4.2 Description
This category covers live and on-demand streaming of XR multimedia streams,
which include 2D or Volumetric video (i.e., Constrained 6DoF) streams that are
rendered in XR with binaural audio as well as 3DOF and 3DOF+ immersive A/V
streams. It is illustrated in Figure 5.4-1, where UE is a device capable of
receiving and rendering the type of stream in use. It is also capable of
controlling the playback of these streams using input from handheld
controllers, hand gestures, biometric readings, body and head movements etc.,
which is communicated to the content server. Control signals include pause,
rewind, viewpoint selection or, in case of emotional streaming, adaptive
content selection.
In another system instance, the content server can provide Inter-destination
Multimedia Synchronization (n) for a group experience. A Spatial Computing
Server is used by XR capable devices to register, compute, update and recall
the spatial configuration of their surroundings. The service is meant for
indoor spaces like a shared room or building. Appropriate surfaces may be
selected for display of XR streams and saved in the Spatial Computing Server.
The configuration can be shared amongst authorized users to enhance group
experience when multiple users are physically sharing the same space.
A social aspect may be added to XR multimedia streaming by receiving live
social media feeds, in addition to the XR media stream, that can be rendered
as an overlay. Furthermore, the users may be able to see the avatars of other
remote located users consuming the same media (additionally from the same
viewpoint in case of multiple viewpoints) and have audio conversations with
them by establishing one or more communication channels. The social aspects
are added by the cloud in the Figure 5.4-1. The XR Media storage in the cloud
is for fetching XR objects, e.g., avatars. The location is shared with the
cloud to establish colocation within the XR. For instance, users viewing from
the same viewpoint may be considered collocated when consuming synchronized
media.

## 5.5 Online XR Gaming
### 5.5.1 Summary of Use Cases
This clause summarizes and integrates the following use cases from Annex A in
a single core use case referred to as \"Online XR Gaming\":
  * Use Case 5: Untethered Immersive Online Gaming
  * Use Case 6: Immersive Game Spectator Mode
  * Use Case 22: 5G Online Gaming party
### 5.5.2 Description
The system as illustrated in Figure 5.5-1 consists of a game server capable of
serving several online gamers. Each player UE receives a stream of the live
game from the game server and sends control signals back to the server that
influence the game play. Control signals include handheld controller inputs,
biometric readings and 3DOF+ motion as required by the gameplay.
Other users may join the live game in spectator mode and can receive the
stream from the perspective of an active player or a spectator view
independent of other players; viewpoint changes may be possible. The spectator
may enjoy an immersive experience or 2D view depending on the device.
Optionally, the spectators may interact with the players through cheering or
game reward systems. In a different instance, cloud rendering could be
present.
In an extension, the players may be co-located at a gaming party/session using
device-to-device or centralized (via gaming server) communication to enhance
the user experience due to improved QoS parameters. A geofenced area may be
used as the game arena for an AR gaming session, with support from a Spatial
Computing Server for location registration and update and a Group discovery
protocol for identifying and matching players. AI methods may be required for
Image & Object Recognition, XR Lighting, Occlusion Avoidance, Shared
Persistence. Spatial Computing Server receives continuous updates from the
players in the arena, which are used for spatial mapping and localization. The
updated spatial data (e.g., maps and player locations) is shared with the
other devices and also the game server.

## 5.6 XR Mission Critical
### 5.6.1 Summary of Use Cases
This clause summarizes and integrates the following use cases from Annex A in
a single core use case referred to as \"XR Mission Critical\":
  * Use Case 9: Police Mission Critical with AR
### 5.6.2 Description
The system shown in Figure 5.6-1 is for critical missions using XR support. In
this use case a team in an indoor space is equipped with mission gear that is
connected to a centralized control center. The UE in the figure represents a
single team member and there may be more than one device included in the
misson gear, such as AR glasses, a 360 degree helmet-mounted camera, a
microphone, binaural audio headphones and other sensors. The control
center/conference server performs the role of mission support by providing XR
graphics such as maps, text, location pointers of other team members or other
objects/people in the surrounding, etc. The mixed audio of the team members as
well as audio from control center is also delivered to the UE to aid team
communication and coordination. One or more drone-mounted cameras may also be
used, which can be controlled by the control center or one of the members of
the mission team. The control center is equipped with A/V processing
capabilities to extract important information from the multitude of 360 degree
video feeds, for instance, for identifying moving objects. All devices at the
site(UEs and drones) use MCPTT to communicate.

## 5.7 XR Conference
### 5.7.1 Summary of Use Cases
This clause summarizes and integrates the following use cases from Annex A in
a single core use case referred to as \"XR Conference\":
  * Use Case 12: 360-degree conference meeting
  * Use Case 13: 3D shared experience
  * Use Case 14: 6DOF VR conferencing
  * Use Case 15: XR Meeting
  * Use Case 16: Convention / Poster Session
### 5.7.2 Description
This system caters for an XR conference with multiple physically co-located
and remote participants using XR to create telepresence. The shared conference
space can be, 1) a physical space that is shared by local participants and
sent as an immersive stream to the remote participants, 2) a virtual space
that has the same layout as the physical space so that the physically present
(local) and remote participants have a similar experience while moving in the
space (e.g. captured via a 360-degree camera), and 3) a virtual space that is
retrieved from an application server (AS). In any of the 3 options the
conference space might be extended with other Media Objects (e.g. a
presentation video) retrieved from an application server (AS). The UE
functionality can be split into two parts one for user media capture and one
for rendering. In practice, these functions may (and usually will) be
integrated within a single device (e.g. a smartphone) possibly augmented by
peripheral devices like a wireless camera. Another option is that they are
indeed separated, e.g. using a dedicated capture device (like a 360-degree
camera) and a XR rendering device (like AR Glasses, mobile phone, VR HMD,
holographic display, etc.). However, it should also be considered that some
UEs will render the immersive communication experience on traditional
displays.
Figure 5.7-1 illustrates the system. Virtual spaces and avatars are retrieved
from the Application Server by the Conference Server. A Spatial Computing
Server is used for storing the layout of the physical space, when used. Remote
participants would be seen as avatars within the XR experience located at
their relative position in the shared space. Alternatively, they may be
represented as themselves using a live video feed and video extraction to
isolate the person from the background and using a photo-realistic
representation of their face in place of the HMD. The required video
processing is located in the conference server in Figure 5.7-1. For example, a
Network Media Processing function may perform any media and/or metadata
processing that is required to place, a certain user and multiple other users
consistently into a virtual environment. A typical example would be a
Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) function that combines and processes the video
captured from the various users in order to reduce the resource requirements
of the clients. Finally, the Conference Server takes care of all the session
signalling to set up channels for the exchange of media data and metadata. It
performs Session Control functions for the scene configuration, network media
processing and common scene media.
Remote participants are free to move around when 6DOF motion is used. The
conference server processes the audio streams from the participants to create
an XR experience. Participants will hear binaural audio of all participants
according to their position and a 360-degree surround sound, if needed. If a
physical space is used, the conference server would also receive and process
input from one or multiple 360-degree A/V capture devices and RGB+depth
camera. Note that when 6DOF is supported, all remote participants can move
freely within the confines of the designated space, moving from one room to
another when there are multiple rooms defined in the space. Using motion
signals, relative positioning and location information, it would be possible
for participants (local + remote) to form smaller groups for discussion within
the XR space as would happen in a real space. The conversation/real-time XR
stream shown in the figure is a mix of VR (remote user) or AR (local user)
media, room layout (virtual/physical) and mixed binaural audio. The
presentation pointer data may be sent from one of the UEs while presenting a
shared presentation/poster for highlighting specific parts.
A top-view of the conference space showing its layout and the current
positions of the participants can be viewed by participants and is indicated
as part of the XR stream label in the figure (but as separate physical
stream). The conference server should also provide IDMS.

## 5.8 Spatial Audio Multiparty Call
### 5.8.1 Summary of Use Cases
This clause summarizes and integrates the following use cases from Annex A in
a single core use case referred to as \"Spatial Audio Multiparty Call\":
  * Use Case 18: AR avatar multi-party calls
  * Use Case 19: Front-facing camera video multi-party calls
### 5.8.2 Description
The system shown in Figure 5.8-1 illustrates an AR multiparty call. Each party
can see the other parties using 2D video streams captured by the front facing
camera of a mobile phone. Alternatively, they can be displayed as avatars, for
instance, when a pair of AR glasses are used as UE. Each party hears spatial
audio with the audio of the other parties originating from where their
avatar/video is placed on the display. Motion such as head turns are tracked
to create a realistic impression that the audio is originating from that
virtual direction.
In a special case, the avatars and the audio of the other parties on party
A\'s display is based on their actual geolocation and the relative direction
they are with respect to party A. The same would be true for all parties. UEs
also have the ability to switch to PTT to suppress surrounding sound if they
wish. They may use the \"hear what I hear\" function to send a 3D audio of
their surroundings to the other parties.
Figure 5.8-1: Spatial Audio Multiparty Call
### 5.8.3 Potential Normative Work
For this use case, the potential normative work may cover:
\- Visual coding and transmission of avatars
\- Coding of cut-out heads, alpha channel coding
\- Audio coding and transmission of mono objects and 3D audio for streams from
all participants.
# 6 Mapping Extended Reality to 5G
## 6.1 Introduction
Based on the technologies introduced in clause 4 as well as the core use cases
and scenarios introduced in clause 5, this clause maps a set of core
technologies to 5G media centric architectures.
## 6.2 XR Processing and Media Centric Architectures
### 6.2.1 Introduction
This clause focuses on rendering and media centric architectures. The
architectures are simplified and illustrative, they only consider an XR server
and an XR device to identify the functions in XR servers and XR devices that
communicate and exchange information, possibly over a 5GS communication. The
baseline technologies are introduced in clause 4. These architectures focus on
processes where the following main tasks are carried out:
\- Display
\- Tracking and Pose Generation
\- Viewport Rendering
\- Capture of real-world content
\- Media encoding
\- Media decoding
\- Media content delivery
\- 5GS communication
\- Media Formats, metadata and other data delivered on communication links
\- Spatial Location Processing
The section also discusses benefits and challenges of the different approaches
in terms of required bitrates, latencies, reliability, etc. A main aspect to
be addressed in the following are the processes that are involved in the
motion-to-photon/sound latency and how the processed may impact the XR
viewport rendering.
### 6.2.2 Viewport-Independent delivery
#### 6.2.2.1 Architecture
In the viewport independent delivery case, following the architecture in 3GPP
TS 26.118 [3], clause 4.3, tracking and sensor information is only processed
in the XR device as shown in Figure 6.2.2-1. This means that the entire XR
scene is delivered and decoded.
Figure 6.2.2-1: Viewport Independent Delivery
#### 6.2.2.2 Use Cases in Context
Use cases that may be addressed partially or completely by this delivery
architecture are summarized in clause 5.4.
#### 6.2.2.3 Basic Procedures
The basic procedures follow the procedures of 5G Media Streaming in 3GPP TS
26.501 [12], clause 5. Both, on-demand and live streaming may be considered.
#### 6.2.2.4 Content Formats and Rendering
No content format for 6DoF streaming is fully defined yet, but the content may
for example be a scene for which foreground 3D objects, for example
represented by point-clouds, are mixed with background content, for example a
omnidirectional scene. The combination of the content may be provided by a
scene description that places the object in the 6DoF scene. Typically, the
data needs to be streamed into buffers that are jointly rendered.
Due to the significant amount of data that needs to be processed in the
device, hardware supported decoding and rendering is necessary.
Such an approach typically requires the delivery and decoding of several video
and audio streams in parallel.
#### 6.2.2.5 Relevant QoS and QoE parameters
In the case of viewport-independent streaming, processing of updated pose
information is only done locally in the XR device. Delivery latency
requirements are independent of the motion-to-photon latency.
In order to provide sufficient content quality, the video material is
referably encoded such that the QoE parameters as defined as defined in clause
4.2 can be fulfilled. The necessary QoS and bitrates on the 5G System depend
depend on the type of the XR media as well as on the streaming protocol. Based
on information from the workshop \"Immersive Media meets 5G\" in April 2019 as
well as from publicly announced demos, that based on today\'s equipment and
the one available over the next 2-3 years, around 100 Mbps are sufficient
bitrates to address high-quality 6DOF VR services. This is expected to allow
2k per eye streaming at 90 fps (see clause 4.2) using existing video codecs
(see clause 4.5). The QoE requirements may increase further, for example
higher resolution and frame rate, but with the advance of new compression
tools, this is expected to be compensated.
The XR media delivery are typically built based on download or adaptive
streaming such as DASH (see for example TS 26.118 [3] and TS 26.247 [7]), such
that one can adjust quality to the available bitrate to a large extent.
Suitable 5QI values for adaptive streaming over HTTP are 6, 8, or 9 as defined
in clause 4.3.3.
If other protocols are applied for streaming, then suitable 5QIs would be for
FFS.
In the context of the present document, relevant 3D media formats, efficient
compression, adaptive delivery as well as the perceived quality of the XR
media is of key relevance.
#### 6.2.2.6 Potential Standardisation Needs
In the context of this delivery scenario, the following potential
standardisation needs are identified:
  * Very high-bitrate and efficient/scalable streaming protocols
  * 6DoF Scene Description and XR media integration
  * Video and audio codec extensions to efficiently code and render graphics centric formats (2D, meshes, point clouds)
  * Support of decoding platforms that support the challenges documented in clause 4.5.2.
### 6.2.3 Viewport-dependent Streaming
#### 6.2.3.1 Architecture
In the viewport dependent delivery case, following the architecture in TS
26.118 [3], clause 4.3, the tracking information is predominantly processed in
the XR device, but the current pose information is provided to the XR delivery
engine in order to include the pose information in the adaptive media
requests. In an extension to this in the case of XR and 6DoF, the XR pose and
additional information may be shared with the XR content delivery in order to
only access the information that is relevant for the current viewports.
According to Figure 6.2.3-1, the tracking and sensor data is processed in the
XR device for XR rendering, and the media is adaptively delivered/requested
based on the XR viewport. A reduced or a viewport optimized scene is delivered
and also only a reduced scene is processed. Examples include an object that is
not visible is not delivered, or only delivered in low quality, or that only
the part of the object that is in the viewport is delivered with the highest
quality.
Figure 6.2.3-2 Viewport-dependent Streaming
#### 6.2.3.2 Use Cases in Context
Use cases that may be addressed partially or completely by this delivery
architecture are summarized in clause 5.4.
#### 6.2.3.3 Basic Procedures
The basic procedures follow the procedures of 5G Media Streaming in TS 26.501
[12], clause 5. Both, on-demand and live streaming may be considered.
In addition, the request for data is accompanied with information from the XR
engine.
#### 6.2.3.4 Content Formats and Rendering
The same formats as discussed in clause 6.2.2.4 apply.
#### 6.2.3.5 Relevant QoS and QoE parameters
Compared to the viewport independent delivery in clause 6.2.2, for viewport
dependent streaming, updated tracking and sensor information impacts the
network interactivity. Typically, due to updated pose information, HTTP/TCP
level information and responses are exchanged every 100-200 ms in viewport-
dependent streaming.
From analysis in TR 26.918 [2] and other experience as for example documented
the workshop \"Immersive Media meets 5G\" in April 2019\" [42], such
approaches can reduce the required bitrate compared to viewport independent
streaming by a factor of 2 to 4 at the same rendered quality.
It is important to note that viewport-dependent streaming technologies are
typically also built based on adaptive streaming allowing to adjust quality to
the available bitrate. The knowledge of tracking information in the XR
Delivery receiver just adds another adaptation parameter. However, generally
such systems may be flexibly designed taking into account a
combination/tradeoff of bitrates, latencies, complexity and quality.
#### 6.2.3.6 Potential Standardisation Needs
In the context of the this architecture, the following potential
standardisation needs are identified:
  * The same aspects as defined in clause 6.2.2.6
  * In addition, more flexible data structures and access to these data structures as well as concurrentdecoding and streaming of smaller units of data, such as tile-based structures, may be defined.
  * If other protocols than adaptive streaming over HTTP would be applied, then suitable 5QIs would be for FFS.
### 6.2.4 Viewport Rendering in Network
#### 6.2.4.1 Overview
In a architecture as shown in figure 6.2.4-1 below, the viewport is entirely
rendered in the XR server. The XR server generates the XR Media on the fly
based on incoming Tracking and Sensor information, for example a game engine.
The generated XR media is provided for the viewport in a 2D format
(flattened), encoded and delivered over the 5G network. The tracking and
sensor information is delivered in the reverse direction. In the XR device,
the media decoders decode the media and the viewport is directly rendered
without using the viewport information.
Figure 6.2.4-1 Viewport rendering in Network
The following call flow highlights the key steps:
1) An XR device connects to the network and XR Media Generation application
a) Sends static XR device information and capabilities (supported decoders,
viewport)
2) Based on this information, XR server sets up encoder and formats
> 3) Loop
a) XR device collects pose (or a predicted pose)
b) XR Pose is sent to XR Server
c) The XR Server uses the pose to generate/compose the viewport
d) XR Viewport is encoded with regular media encoders
e) The compressed video is sent to XR Device
f) The XR device decompresses video and directly renders viewport
Such an architecture enables simple clients, but has significantly challenges
on compression and transport to fulfill the latency requirements. Latencies
should be kept low for each processing step including delivery, to make sure
that the cumulative delay for all the processing steps (including tracking,
pose delivery, viewport rendering, media encoding, media delivery, media
decoding and display) is within the immersive motion-to-photon latency upper
limit of 20ms.
#### 6.2.4.2 Relevant QoS and QoE parameters
The following three cases, with different media delivery bitrates, are
considered:
1) Around 100 Mbps: In this case, the XR device needs to perform certain
amount of processing and decoding.
2) Around 1 Gbps: In this case, only lightweight and low-latency compression
(e.g. intra only) may be used to provide sufficiently high quality (4k or even
8k at sufficiently high frame rates above 60 fps) and sufficiently low latency
(immersive limits of less than 20ms for motion to photon) for such
applications. It is still expected that some processing (e.g. decoding) by the
XR device is needed.
3) Around 10 Gbps or even more: A full \"USB-C like\" wireless connection,
providing functionalities that currently can only be provided by cable,
possibly uncompressed formats such as 8K. The processing requirements for the
XR device in this case may be minimal.
Note that the lightweight compression or no compression in cases 2) and 3) can
help to reduce processing delays.
In addition, the formats exported from Game engines needs to be supported by
the respective media encoders.
Note that in this case for XR-based services, the motion-to-photon latency
determines the maximum latency requirements for the content. This means that
20ms as defined in clause 4.5.1 are the end-to-end latency targets, including
the uplink streaming of the pose information.
This is different, if the content is rendered on a flat device (for example
for cloud/edge gaming applications on smartphones), for which not motion-to-
photon latency determines the latency requirements, but the roundtrip
interaction delay. In this case, the requirements from clause 4.5.2 apply,
typically a 50ms latency is a requirement for most advanced games.
#### 6.2.4.3 Potential Standardisation Needs
On Formats and codecs:
  * From the analysis, for case 1, similar aspects as defined in clause 6.2.2.6 apply for the formats.
  * For cases 2 and 3, formats are of less relevance for 3GPP as such formats are typically defined by other consortia, if at all.
On network support:
  * Network rendering for cloud gaming on flat screens is expected to be of significant relevance. In this case the end-to-end latency (action to photon) is determined by the roundtrip interaction delay, i.e. 50ms (see 4.5.2). 5QIs to support such latencies as well as guaranteed bitrates are considered of relevance. Required bitrates follow case 1) from above.
  * Network rendering for XR services would require an end-to-end latency including motion-to-photon (including network rendering, encoding, delivery and decoding) of 20ms to meet the immersive limits and it is expected that the bitrates would be higher due to low-complexity and low-latency encoding, following case 2) and 3) from above. Hence,
    * 5QIs and QoS would be necessary, that provides significantly lower latency than 10ms in both directions and the same time provides a stable and high bitrate in the range of 0.1 -- 1 Gbps according to case 2).
    * It is not expected to be practical for Uu-based communication to achieve such low-latencies at very high bitrates (mostly case 3, e.g. 1Gbps and higher) in the short term, but final studies on this matter are FFS.
    * However, sidelink-based based communication addressing network rendering is expected to be feasible in the 5G architecture and is subject to active work in 3GPP.
### 6.2.5 Raster-based Split Rendering
#### 6.2.5.1 Architecture
Raster-based split rendering refers to the case where the XR Server runs an XR
engine to generate the XR Scene based on information coming from an XR device.
The XR Server rasterizes the XR viewport and does XR pre-rendering.
According to Figure 6.2.5-1, the viewport is pre-dominantly rendered in the XR
server, but the device is able to do latest pose correction, for example by
asynchronuous time-warping (see clause 4.1) or other XR pose correction to
address changes in the pose.
\- XR graphics workload is split into rendering workload on a powerful XR
server (in the cloud or the edge) and pose correction (such as ATW) on the XR
device
\- Low motion-to-photon latency is preserved via on device Asynchronous Time
Warping (ATW) or other pose correction methods.
As ATW is applied the motion-to-photon latency requirements (of at most 20 ms)
are met by XR device internal processing. What determines the network
requirements for split rendering is time of pose-to-render-to-photon and the
roundtrip interaction delay. According to clause 4.5, the latency is typically
50-60ms. This determines the latency requirements for the 5G delivery.
Figure 6.2.5-1: Split Rendering with Asynchronous Time Warping (ATW)
Correction
#### 6.2.5.2 Use Cases in Context
The use cases in clause 5.5 may be addressed by this architecture.
#### 6.2.5.3 Basic Procedures
The following call flow highlights the key steps:
1) An XR Device connects to the network and joins XR application
a) Sends static device information and capabilities (supported decoders,
viewport)
2) Based on this information, the XR server sets up encoders and formats
3) Loop
a) XR Device collects XR pose (or a predicted XR pose)
b) XR Pose is sent to XR Server
c) The XR Server uses the pose to pre-render the XR viewport
d) XR Viewport is encoded with 2D media encoders
e) The compressed media is sent to XR device along with XR pose that it was
rendered for
f) The XR device decompresses video
g) The XR device uses the XR pose provided with the video frame and the actual
XR pose for an improved prediction using and to correct the local pose, e.g.
using ATW.
#### 6.2.5.4 Content Formats and Rendering
Rasterized 3D scenes available in frame buffers (see clause 4.4) are provided
by the XR engine and need to be encoded, distributed and decoded. According to
clause 4.2.1, relevant formats for frame buffers are 2k by 2k per eye,
potentially even higher. Frame rates are expected to be at least 60fps,
potentially higher up to 90 fps.The formats of frame buffers are regular
texture video signals that are then directly rendered. As the processing is
graphics centric, formats beyond commonly used 4:2:0 signals and YUV signals
may be considered.
#### 6.2.5.5 Relevant QoS and QoE parameters
With the use of time warp, the latency requirements follow those documented in
clause 4.2.2, i.e. the end-to-end latency between the user motion and the
rendering is 50ms.
It is known from experiments that with H.264/AVC the bitrates are in the order
of 50 Mbps per eye buffer. It is expect that this can be reduced to lower
bitrates with improved compression tools (see clause 4.5) but higher quality
requirements may absorb the gains. It is also known that this is both content
and user movements dependent, but it is known from experiments that 50 - 100
Mbps is a valid target bitrate for split rendering.
Regular stereo audio signals are considered, requiring bitrates that are
negligible compared to the video signals.
5QI values exist that may address the use case, such 5QI value number 80 with
10ms, however this is part of the non-GBR bearers (see clause). In addition,
it is unclear whether the 10ms with such high bitrates and low required error
rates may be too stringent and resource consuming. Hence, for simple split
rendering in the context of the requirements in this clause, suitable 5QIs may
have to be defined addressing the latency requirements in the range of 10-20ms
and bitrate guarantees to be able to stream 50 to 100 Mbps consistently.
The uplink is predominantly the pose information, see clause 4.1 for details.
Data rates are several 100 kbit/s and the latency should be small in order to
not add to the overall target latency.
#### 6.2.5.6 Potential Standardisation needs
In the context of this architecture, the following potential standardisation
needs are identified:
  * Regular 2D video encoders and decoders that are capable encode and decode 2K per eye as well as 90 fps and are capable to encode typical graphics frame buffer signals.
  * Pose information in the uplink at sufficiently high frequency
  * Content Delivery protocols to support the delivery requirements
  * Edge computing discovery and capability discovery
  * A simple XR split rendering application framework for single buffer streaming
  * New 5QIs and QoS support in 5G System for split rendering addressing latency requirements in the range of 10-20ms and bitrate guarantees to be able to stream 50 to 100 Mbps consistently.
### 6.2.6 Generalized XR Split Rendering
#### 6.2.6.1 Architecture
In Figure 6.2.6-1, an architecture is shown for which the XR server pre-
renders the 3D scene into a simpler format to be processed by the device (e.g.
it may provide additional metadata that is delivered with the pre-rendered
version). The device recovers the baked media and does the final rendering
based on local correction on the actual pose.
\- XR graphics workload is split into rendering workload on a powerful XR
server and simpler XR processing on the XR device
\- This approach enables to relax the latency requirements to maintain a full
immersive experience as time-critical adjustment to the correct pose is done
in the device.
\- this approach may provide more flexibility in terms of bitrates, latency
requirements, processing, etc. than the single buffer split rendering in
clause 6.2.5.
Figure 6.2.6-1: VR Split Rendering with XR Viewport Rendering in Device
Such an approach needs careful considerations on the formats of projected
media and their compression with media decoders. Also important is
distribution of latencies to different components of the system. More details
and breakdown of the architectures is necessary. The interfaces in the device
however are aligned with the general structure defined above.
In general, the similar requirements and considerations as in clause 6.2.5
apply, but a more flexible framework may be considered by providing not only
2D frame buffers, but different buffers that are split over the network.
#### 6.2.6.2 Use Cases in Context
The use cases in clause 5.5 may be addressed by this architecture.
#### 6.2.6.3 Basic Procedures
The following call flow highlights the key steps:
1) An XR Device connects to the network and joins XR application
a) Sends static device information (supported decoders, viewport, supported
formats)
2) Based on this information, network server sets up encoder and formats
3) Loop
a) XR Device collects XR pose (or a predicted XR pose)
b) XR Pose is sent to XR Server
c) The XR Server uses the pose to pre-render the XR viewport by creating one
or multiple rendering buffers, possibly with different update frequencies
d) The rendering buffers are encoded with 2D and 3D media encoders
e) The compressed media is sent to XR device along with additional metadata
that describes the media
f) The XR device decompresses the multiple buffers and adds this to the XR
rendering engine.
g) The XR rendering engine takes the buffers, the rendering pose assigned to
the buffers and the latest XR pose to create the finally rendered viewport.
#### 6.2.6.4 Content Formats and Rendering
In this context, the buffers may not only be 2D texture or frame buffers as in
case of clause 6.2.5, but may include geometric data, 3D data, meshes and so
on. Also multiple objects may be generated. The content formats discussed in
clause 4.6 apply.
#### 6.2.6.5 Relevant QoS and QoE parameters
With the use of different buffers, the latency requirements follow those
documented in clause 4.5.2, i.e. the end-to-end latency between the user
motion and the rendering is 50ms. However, it may well be that the update
frequency of certain buffers is less. This may result in differentiated QoS
requirements for different encoded media, for example in terms of latency,
bitrates, etc.
More details are FFS.
#### 6.2.6.6 Potential Standardisation needs
In the context of the this architecture, the following potential
standardisation needs are identified:
  * Similar aspects as defined clause 6.2.5.6
  * Flexible 2D and 3D formats that can be shared over the network to serve device rendering buffers
  * Formats and decoding capabilities as defined in clause 4.5.2
  * Edge computing discovery and capability discovery for Generalized Split rendering
  * A generalized XR split rendering application framework
  * More flexible 5QIs and QoS support in 5G System for generalized split rendering addressing differentiated latency requirements in the range of 10ms up to potentially several 100ms and with bitrate guarantees.
### 6.2.7 XR Distributed Computing
This clause provides the architecture for extended reality applications which
supports the XR split rendering. The workload for XR processing is split into
workloads on XR server and the device. The below Figure 6.2.7-1 shows a high-
level structure of the XR distributed computing architecture which describes
their components and interfaces.
Figure 6.2.7-1: XR Distributed Computing Architecture
An XR client may have following capabilities.
\- XR capture
\- Sensor data processing (e.g., AR pose tracking)
\- XR scene generation
\- XR rendering.
\- 2D or 3D Media decoding
\- Metadata (including scene description) processing
\- 5G delivery
An XR edge server may have following capabilities.
\- Sensor data processing
\- XR scene generation
\- 2D or 3D media encoding
\- Metadata (including scene description) generation
\- 5G delivery
An XR client connects to the network and joins XR rendering application. The
XR client sends static device information (e.g., sensors, supported decoders,
display configuration) to the XR edge server. Based on this information, the
XR edge server sets up encoder and formats.
When the XR client has a set of sensors (e.g., trackers and capturing devices,
it collects sensor data from sensors. The collected sensor data is processed
either locally or at the XR edge server. The collected sensor data or locally
processed information (e.g., a current AR pose) is sent to the XR edge server.
The XR edge server uses the information to generate the XR scene. The XR edge
server converts the XR scene into a simpler format as 2D or 3D media with
metadata (including scene description). The media component is compressed, and
the compressed media stream and metadata are delivered to the XR client. The
XR client generates the XR scene by compositing locally generated or received
media and metadata and renders the XR viewport via the XR display (e.g., HMD,
AR glass).
For example, the XR client captures the 2D video stream from a camera and
sends the captured stream to the XR edge server. The XR edge server performs
the AR tracking and generates the AR scene which a 3D object is overlaid over
a certain position in the 2D video based on the AR tracking information. The
3D object or 2D video for the AR scene are encoded with 2D/3D media encoders,
and the scene description or the metadata is generated. The compressed media
and metadata are sent to the XR client. The XR client decodes the media or
metadata and generates an AR scene which overlays the 3D object in the 2D
video., A user viewport is determined by horizontal/vertical field of view of
the screen of a head-mounted display or any other display device. The
appropriate part of AR scene for the user viewport is rendered and displayed.
### 6.2.8 XR Conversational
In Figure 6.2.8-1, a general architecture for XR conversational and conference
services is depicted. As stated, these services are an extension on the
current MTSI work, using the IMS for session signalling. In order to support
XR conversational services (in 5G), extensions are needed in the signalling to
enable VR/AR specific attributes, and the media and metadata need to support
the right codecs, profiles and metadata. A new interface is the interface to
the network (based) media processing. This is an interface similar to that to
an SRF, but is expected to be much more extensive to support various types of
media processing. This interface can be based on the work in MPEG on Network
Based Media Processing.
{width="6.085033902012248in" height="2.9539741907261594in"}
Figure 6.2.8-1 General architecture for XR conversational and conference
services
Typical steps for call session setup follow normal IMS procedures, in case the
clients have a simple peer-2-peer call and also do all processing themselves
(simplified procedure as follows):
  1. The first client initiates call setup (SIP INVITE);
  2. The IMS (i.e. central session control) routes the call setup to the second client, ensuring proper bandwidth reservations in the network;
  3. The second client, after call acceptance, responds to the call setup (200 OK);
  4. The network controls all bandwidth reservations;
  5. Call setup is completed.
But, given mobile clients, their limited processing capabilities, battery
capacity and potentially problems with heat dissipation, processing might be
moved to the network. Typical processing for XR conferencing:
  * Foreground/background segmentation;
  * HMD removal, i.e. replacing a users HMD with a 3D model of the actual face, possibly including eye tracking / reinsertion;
  * 3D avatar reconstruction, i.e. using RGB + depth cameras or multiple cameras to create 3D user video avatars;
  * Support for multiple users with a (centralised or distributed) VR conferencing bridge, stitching multiple user captures together;
  * Creating a self-view, i.e. local 3D user avatar from the user's own perspective.
In such network-processing scenario, setup is somewhat extended:
  1. First a client initiates the call setup;
  2. Based on the call setup, the session control triggers network based media processing, reserves resources in the network, incl. media processing resources;
  3. Session control forwards call setup to the second client;
  4. After call acceptance, both first and second client are connected to the network processor.
  5. Session control instruct the network processor on the actual processing and the stream forwarding, i.e. which input streams go to which clients.
Specific details here are for further study. Routing media streams can be
performed in various ways, using existing methods for stream transcoding, or
more centralised conferencing signalling. The interface to the media processor
can be based on the existing MRF interface. But, given the developments within
MPEG on Network Based Media Processing, maybe a new interface should be
defined.
For the routing of signalling, many options allready exist within the IMS. Re-
use and perhaps slight modifications are expected to be sufficient to cover
the various use cases defined here. For the SDP within the signalling, more
modifications are expected. Besides support for new types of media and thus
new types of codecs (point cloud streaming, mesh streaming, depth streaming)
and profiles for those codecs, new types of metadata also need to be
supported. Calibration data (i.e. calibration of HMD position vs camera
position), HMD information (position, orientation, characteristics), camera
information (position/orientation, lens/sensor characteristics, settings),
user information (3D model, IOD, HRTF, etc) can all be used to perform or
improve the media processing.
Also, there are different media types, both for the environment and for the
user avatars. A virtual environment can consist of a rendered environment, a
360 photo or video, or some hybrid. User avatars can be graphical avatars,
video based, 3D video avatars, rendered avatars. Devices can be a single
device (one mobile in an HMD enclosure, potentially with a separate bluetooth
camera) or can be multiple devices (separate stand-alone VR HMD, multiple
(smartphones as cameras).
Additional aspects to be taken into account are:
  * placement of media processor: central vs edge, centralised vs distributed.
  * delay aspects for communication purposes. Ideally, delay is kept to a minimum, i.e. \2.7Mbit/s (1 camera), >5.4Mbit/s (2 Camera)
  * 3D Mesh: \~30 Mbit/s
  * 3D VPCC / GPCC: 5-50 Mbit/s (CTC MPEG)
Furthermore we can assume that joining an communication experience session
will result in a download peek at the beginning of the session to download the
environment and associated media objects within the XR application. Throughout
a XR communication experience session the download might vary depanding on the
amound of users represented and the upload format of those users.
## 6.3 Summary of Traffic Characteristics

architectures, based on the findings in this clause. The parameters relate to
the 5G PDU session QoS as introduced in clause 4.3.

## 6.4 Analysis of existing 5QIs
As a summary of the above, existing 5QIs may be used for adaptive streaming
over HTTP applications as defined in clause 6.2.2 and 6.2.3.
For other types of services, new 5QIs for Uu-based communication are
considered beneficial, among others
  * If other protocols than adaptive streaming over HTTP would be applied, then suitable 5QIs would be for FFS.
  * New 5QIs and QoS support in 5G System for network and split rendering addressing latency requirements in the range of 10-20ms and bitrate guarantees to be able to stream 50 to 100 Mbps consistently
  * More flexible 5QIs and QoS support in 5G System for generalized split rendering addressing differentiated latency requirements in the range of 10ms to several 100ms and with bitrate guarantees.
  * Error rates are FFS.
  * The data rate, latency and PER for different architectures as introduced in clause 6.3 are FFS.
For sidelink based communication, new PQI/QoS parameters may be defined as
well. Details are FFS.**\ **
# 7 Potential Standardisation Areas
## 7.1 General
This clause documents and clusters potential standardisation areas in the
context of this Technical Report.
## 7.2 XR-Centric Device Types and Architectures
As documented in clause 4.5, XR centric devices are the key enablers for XR
services. Key aspects for XR devices are:
  * Rendering-centric device architectures using sophisticated GPU functionalities, see clause 4.4.
  * Support for Tracking, in particular inside-out tracking in the device
  * Heavily power-constrained at least for certain form factors
  * Support for multiple decoding formats and parallel decoding of media streams following the challenges documented in clause 4.5.2
In addition, device characteristics can be quite different. Hence, the device
types developed in clause 4.8 serve as a starting point for different device
types. A more formal definition of XR devices types is considered useful.
In any work considered in 3GPP, end-points compatible to Khronos-based
graphics and XR functionalities should be considered. A framework for
interfacing device centric XR functionalities with 5G System and radio
functionalities is a relevant standardisation effort.
## 7.3 Extensions to 5G Media Streaming for XR/6DoF Media
Streaming XR and 6DoF is considered in several use cases evaluated in this
Technical report. With the establishment of 5G Media Streaming in Release-16
in TS 26.501 and the stage-3 specifications, extensions of 5G Media Streaming
to support XR experiences is useful. MPEG develops several new formats and
codecs specifically addressing 3D and XR, but also proprietary formats exist
that make use of regular hardware supported standardized media codecs and
rendering functionalities. All of them have in common that they rely on
existing and emerging device architectures that make use of existing video
codecs and GPU rendering. In addition, the use of multiple video codecs in
parallel is commonly applied. XR/6DoF Streaming is based on CDNs and HTTP
delivery, however new functionalities are required.
Extensions to 5G Media streaming may be done in ordered to support the
delivery of different XR/DoF media in 5G Systems. Relevant aspects are:
  * Additional media decoding capabilities including higher profile and levels, the use of multiple decoders in parallel to interface with rendering architectures, as well more flexible formats following clause 4.5.2
  * Support for more flexible delivery protocols allowing parallel download of different objects and parts of objects
  * Viewport-dependent streaming as documented in clause 6.2.3
  * Potentially new 5QIs and radio capabilities to support higher bitrate streaming
  * Biometrics and Emotion Metadata definition and transport
## 7.4 Raster-based Split Rendering with Pose Correction
Split Rendering is a promising technology to support online gaming in power-
and resource constrained devices. Split rendering requires the use of edge
computing as the pose-to-render-to-photon is expected to be below 50ms.
Rendering of rasterized frame buffers in the network allows to support XR
devices with existing codecs using 5G System and radio capabilities. Relevant
aspects for single-buffet split rendering include:
  * A simple XR split rendering application framework where a single frame buffer per media per eye is shared and final pose correction is done in the XR device
  * 2D video encoders and decoders that are capable encode and decode 2K per eye as well as 90 fps as well as typical 2D rasterized graphics centric formats
  * Integration of audio into split rendering architectures
  * Formats and protocols for XR Pose information delivery and possibly other metadata in the uplink at sufficiently high frequency
  * Content Delivery protocols that support split rendering
  * 5QIs and other 5GS/Radio capabilities that support split rendering
  * Edge computing discovery and capability discovery based on work in SA2 and SA6 (see clause 4.3.6)
## 7.5 XR conference applications
XR conversational applications within real or computer generated virtual
environments is considered in several use cases evaluated in this Technical
report. Some work is already ongoing in IVAS, ITT4RT, however, potential
additional normative work includes;
\- Study the mapping of XR conference applications to the 5G system
architecture including Media streaming and MTSI.
  * Support for media processing in the network (e.g. NBMP) (e.g. foreground/background segmentation of the user capture, replacement of the user with a photo-realistic representation of their face, etc.)
  * 6DOF metadata framework and a 6DOF capable renderer for immersive voice and audio.
  * Support of static/dynamic 3D objects' formats and transport for real-time sharing
  * Transport of collected data from multiple sensors (e.g. for spatial mapping)
  * Format for storing and sharing spatial information (e.g. indoor spatial data).
  * Content Delivery protocols that support XR conversational cases
  * 5QIs and other 5GS/Radio capabilities that support XR conversational cases
  * Edge computing discovery and capability discovery based on work in SA2 and SA6 (see clause 4.3.6)
## 7.6 Augmented Reality for New Form Factors
Augmented reality was discussed in details in this report. Glass-type AR/MR
UEs with standalone capability, i.e., that can be connected directly to 3GPP
networks are interesting emerging devices. Such a type is classified as
XR5G-A5 in Table 4.3-1. However, it would also be necessary to consider
situations where XR5G-A5 UEs have to fall back to XR5G-A1 or XR5G-A2, i.e., to
the wired or wirelessly tethered modes, e.g., from NR Uu to 5G sidelink or
IEEE 802.11ad/y. Furthermore, an evolution path for devices under the category
XR5G-A3 and XR5G-A4 should be considered. Further studies are encouraged,
among others
  * Basic use cases: a set of use cases relevant for XR5G-A5 can be selected from Table 5.1-1. The preferred cases will be those capable of delivering experiences previous or existing services could not support, e.g., real-time sharing or streaming 3D objects. They also have to be easier to realize in the environments of glasses that are more limited than those of phones.
  * Media formats and profiles: for the selected use cases, available formats and profiles of the media/data can be discussed. Sharing of XR and 3D Data is of interest for personal and enterprise use cases as documented in scenario 5.2. Properly generated XR data can be used in AR applications on smartphone devices as well as on AR glasses. Exchange formats for AR-based applications are relevant, for example for services such as MMS.
  * Transport technologies and protocols: in case the selected use cases include relocation or delivery of 3D or XR media/data over 3GPP networks, combinations of transport protocols, radio access and core network technologies that support the use cases at relevant QoS can be discussed. If existing technologies and protocols cannot serve the use cases properly, such gaps can be taken into account in the consideration of normative works.
  * Form factor-related issues: in Table 4.3-1, typical maximum transmit power of XR5G-A5 is 0.5-2W while phone types transmit at 3-5 W. However, if XR5G-A5 is implemented in a form factor of typical glasses, i.e., smaller than goggles or HMDs and with a weight less than 100 g, its cellular modems and antennas are located near the face. In this case, XR5G-A5 UEs can have more constraints on transmit power and it would be necessary to develop solutions to overcome it, e.g. considering situations where XR5G-A5 UEs have to fall back to XR5G-A2 from NR Uu to 5G sidelink or IEEE 802.11ad/y. Furthermore, an evolution path for devices under the category XR5G-A3 (3-7W) and XR5G-A4 (2-4W) should be considered.
## 7.7 Traffic Characteristics and Models for XR Services
As identified in the course of the development of this report, there is
significant interest in 3GPP radio and system groups on the traffic
characteristics for XR services. This effort should be a prime work for 3GPP
to collect realistic traffic characteristics for typical XR services. Of
specific interest for other groups in 3GPP is a characterization of traffic of
an XR service in the following domains:
\- Downlink data rate ranges
\- Uplink data rate ranges
\- Maximum packet delay budget in uplink and downlink
\- Maximum Packet Error Rate,
\- Maximum Round Trip Time
\- Traffic Characteristics on IP level in uplink and downlink in terms of
packet sizes, and temporal characteristics.
Such characteristics are expected to be available for at least the following
applications
\- Viewport independent 6DoF Streaming
\- Viewport dependent 6DoF Streaming
\- Single Buffer split rendering for online cloud gaming
\- XR conversational services
The Technical Report on Typical Traffic Characteristics in TR 26.925 should be
updated to address any findings to support the 3GPP groups.
## 7.8 Social XR
Social XR is used as an umbrella term for combining, delivering, decoding and
rendering XR objects (avatars, conversational, sound sources, streaming live
content, etc.) originating from different sources into a single user
experience. Social XR may be VR centric, but also may apply to AR and MR.
Social XR is expected to integrate multiple XR functionalities such a 6DoF
streaming with XR conversational services. Some normative work may include:
\- Social XR Components -- Merging of avatar and conversational streams to
original media (e.g., overlays, etc.)
\- Parallel decoding of multiple independently generated sources.
\- Proper annotation and metadata for each object to place it into scene.
\- Description and rendering of multiple objects into a Social XR experience.
Details are FFS.
## 7.9 Generalized Split and Cloud Rendering and Processing
Edge/Cloud processing and rendering is a promising technology to support
online gaming in power- and resource constrained devices. Relevant aspects for
generalized cloud/split rendering include:
  * A generalized XR cloud and split rendering application framework based on a scene description
  * Support for 3D formats in split and cloud rendering approaches
  * Formats and protocols for XR Pose information delivery and possibly other metadata in the uplink at sufficiently high frequency
  * Content Delivery protocols that support generalized split/cloud rendering
  * Distributions of processing resources across different resources in the 5G system network, in the application provider domain (cloud) and the XR device.
  * Supporting the establishment of Processing Workflows across distributed resources and managing those
  * 5QIs and other 5GS/Radio capabilities that support generalized split/cloud rendering by coordination with other groups
  * Edge computing discovery and capability discovery based on work in SA2 and SA6 (see clause 4.3.6)
It is recommended that this area is studied in more details to identify key
issues.
# 8 Conclusions and Proposed Next Steps
In this study, frameworks for eXtended Reality (XR) have been analysed. XR
referes a larger concept for representing reality that includes the virtual,
augmented, and mixed realities. After defining key terms and outlining the
QoE/QoS issues of XR-based services, the delivery of XR in the 5G system is
discussed, following an architectural model of 5G media streaming defined in
TS 26.501. In addition to the conventional service categories, conversational,
interactive, streaming, and download, split compute/rendering is identified as
a new delivery category. A survey of 3D, XR visual and audio formats was
provided.
Use cases and device types have been classified, and processing and media
centric architectures are introduced. This includes viewport independent and
dependent streaming, as well as different distributed computing architecture
for XR. Core use cases of XR include those unique to AR and MR in addition to
those of VR discussed in TR 26.918, ranging from offline sharing of 3D
objects, real-time sharing, multimedia streaming, online gaming, mission
critical applications, and multi-party call/conferences.
Based on the details in the report, the following is proposed:
In the short-term:
Develop a flexible XR centric device reference architecture as well as a
collection of device requirements and recommendations for XR device classes
based on the considerations in clause 7.2. Device classes should include VR
device for 6DoF streaming and XR online gaming (XR5G-V4), as well as AR
devices (XR5G-A1, XR5G-A4 and XR5G-A5).
Develop a framework and basic functionalities for raster-based Split Rendering
for Online Gaming according to the considerations in clause 7.4.
Document typical XR traffic characteristics in 3GPP TR 26.925 based on the
initial considerations in this report, in particular clause 7.7 and support
other 3GPP groups in designing systems for XR services and applications.
Address simple extensions to MTSI to support XR conversational services based
on the considerations in clause 7.5
Study detailed functionalities and requirements for glass-type AR/MR UEs with
standalone capability according to clause 7.6 and addresses exchange formats
for AR centric media, taking into account different processing capabilities of
AR devices.
In the mid-term:
Based on the work developed in the short-term for raster-based split
rendering, an extended Split and Cloud Rendering and Processing should be
defined based on the considerations in clause 7.9, preferably preceded by a
dedicated study
Address simple extensions to 5G Media Streaming to support 6DoF Streaming
based on considerations in clause 7.3. Stage-2 aspects related to TS26.501
should be considered first before starting detailed stage-3 work.
Based on the work developed in the shorter time frame above, address the
considerations in more detailed considerations inclause 7.5 and clause 7.8 on
Social XR
The work should be carried out in close coordination with other groups in 3GPP
on XR related matter, edge computing and rendering as well in communication
with experts in MPEG on the MPEG-I project as well as with Khronos on their
work on OpenXR, glTF and Vulkan/OpenGL.

# A.2 Use Case 1: 3D Image Messaging
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Use Case Description: 3D Image Messaging** | +======================================================================+ | Alice uses her phone that is equipped with a depth camera to capture | | an image of a statue in 3D. The phone captures a set of images and | | builds a 3D model of the object. After a few seconds the 3D image is | | ready to share and Alice sends the image to Bob as an MMS message. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Categorization** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Type: AR** | | | | **Degrees of Freedom: 3DoF+ or 6DoF** | | | | **Delivery: Upload and Download** | | | | **Device: Phone, AR glasses** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Preconditions** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | - Phone is equipped with 3D capture capabilities, such as depth | | camera or a stereo camera on the back of the phone, possibly | | supported by an app for processing multiple images. | | | | - Phone is equipped with a 3D image viewer | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Requirements and QoS/QoE Considerations** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | - QoS: Reliable delivery of a File of a few MByte distributed over | | MMS | | | | - QoE: Quality of the 3D object representation, level of details | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Feasibility** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Some new smartphone releases are equipped with a Time of Flight | | (ToF) depth camera (see for example | | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight_camera) that can be | | used to build accurate 3D models of objects of interest. Compared to | | structured light cameras, ToF do not require a large baseline to | | achieve good depth accuracy. | | | | Applications such as 3D Photo are using the stereo camera on the | | back of some phone models to generate a 3D model using a set of | | pictures taken consecutively. To compensate for the small baseline, | | complex processing (e.g. deep model to reconstruct the depth map) | | may be required. | | | | The 3D image can be stored as a point cloud, a mesh, or a layered | | image. The content maybe compressed to reduce the message size. The | | content is identified through its mime type and can be embedded with | | other content such as text. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Potential Standardization Status and Needs** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | The following aspects may require standardization work: | | | | - Standardized formats for 3D images, e.g. meshes, point clouds, | | and/or depth-layered images | | | | - Extensions to MMS to support 3D images | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
# A.3 Use Case 2: AR Sharing
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Use Case Description: AR Sharing** | +======================================================================+ | Alice is shopping for a new couch at the furniture store close to | | her. Alice finds a couch that she likes and wants to check Bob\'s | | opinion who sits back home. Alice scans a QR code with her phone to | | download a 3D model of the couch and sends it to Bob via MMS. Bob | | places the virtual model of the couch on a plane surface in the | | living room. Bob likes how the couch fits in their living room and | | captures a 3D picture of the room with the couch and shares it with | | Alice. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Categorization** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Type: AR, MR** | | | | **Degrees of Freedom: 6DoF** | | | | **Delivery: Local, Messaging Download and Upload** | | | | **Device: Phone, AR glasses** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Requirements and QoS/QoE Considerations** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | - QoS: Reliable Delivery (Upload and Download) of a File of a few | | or several MByte | | | | - QoE: Quality of the 3D object representation, level of details | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Preconditions** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | - Bob\'s smartphone has support for AR technology | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Feasibility** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Modeling of sale items in 3D will be increasing. This will | | facilitate purchase decisions for millions of customers. Texture of | | the 3D models may vary to reflect available choices for the item. | | | | A user can use ARCore [4] or ARKit [5] to detect flat surfaces | | and place the 3D model on it. The AR scene can be captured with the | | real scene in the background and the 3D object in the foreground. | | | | To achieve physically-based rendering (PBR), additional | | characteristics of the 3D object\'s texture are stored. These may | | include properties such as specular, diffuse, transparency, | | reflectivity, etc. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Potential Standardization Status and Needs** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | The following aspects may require standardization work: | | | | - Standardized format for 3D objects is needed | | | | - Standardized format for mixed reality 3D scenes is needed | | | | - Extensions to MMS to support sharing of 3D objects and scenes | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
# A.4 Use Case 3: Streaming of Immersive 6DoF
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Use Case Description: Streaming of Immersive 6DoF** | +======================================================================+ | Alice consumes a recorded highlight of a basketball match being | | seated close to the court by using an application on the 5G enabled | | HMD. For this, Alice wears an HMD together with a 6DoF manual | | controller. The HMD is connected to a 5G network but has no other | | tethered connection. The 6DoF controller allows to change the | | viewing position (i.e. the seat) and looking at the action from | | different angles. In addition, restricted local 6DoF movement of | | Alice at a location enables to locally interact with the scene based | | on HMD sensors. Even more the controller allows to rewind, slow mo | | and pause the scene. In the pause or slow-motion mode, the scene can | | be viewed from different angles using the controller and head | | motion. The scene is overlaid with information that helps Alice to | | navigate through the scene. Alice feels _present_ in the scene. | | | | In an extension to the use case, the game is consumed in a live | | mode. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Categorization** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Type: VR** | | | | **Degrees of Freedom: 3DoF+, 6DoF** | | | | **Delivery: Streaming, Interactive, Split** | | | | **Device: HMD with a controller** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Preconditions** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | - Application is installed that permits to consume the scene | | | | - The application uses existing HW capabilities on the device, | | including A/V decoders, rendering functionalities as well as | | sensors.

The video | | data should include a cut-out of the user on a chroma background in | | order to place a user representation into the 360-degree image | | background. Instead of chroma background, alpha channel (for | | transparancy) is also an option. | | | | - Rendering: Rendering on the end user device, preferably on a | | single decoding platform/chipset with efficient simultaneous | | decoding of different media streams. Further, the transferred user | | representation has to be blended into a VR or AR environment and any | | audio needs to be played according to its spatial origin within the | | environment. | | | | - Cloud processing (optional): by adding a (pre-) rendering | | function into the cloud, processing and resource usage will shift | | from the end user device into the edge (or cloud) and thus imply a | | less scalability system but lower processing load for the end user | | device | | | | Please note that this is a functional diagram and this is not mapped | | to physical entities yet. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Potential Standardization Status and Needs** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | The following aspects may require standardization work: | | | | - System | | | | - Architecture | | | | - Communication interfaces / signalling | | | | - Media Orchestration (i.e. metadata) | | | | - Position and scaling of people | | | | - Spatial Audio (e.g. including audio directionality of users) | | | | - Background audio / picture / video | | | | - Shared content (i.e. video background), i.e. multi-device media | | synchronization | | | | - Allow Network based processing (e.g. cloud rendering, foreground | | /background segmentation of user capture, replace HMD of user with a | | photo-realistic representation of there face, etc.) | | | | - Transmission | | | | - The end-to-end system (including the network) needs to support | | the RGB+Depth video data. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

# A.15 Use Case 14: 6DOF VR conferencing
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Use Case Name** | +======================================================================+ | 6DOF VR conferencing | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Description** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | The use case was initially described in TR 26.918 as Virtual Meeting | | Place: | | | | _The main idea here is to create a virtual world where people can | | meet and interact anonymously through their avatars with other | | people. A user would be able to move freely in the virtual world (6 | | DOF) and mingle with different groups of people depending for | | example on the discussion they are having. In this scenario, the | | user would be able to speak to other users in his/her immediate | | proximity and obtain a spatial rendering of what the other users in | | his/her immediate proximity are saying and would hear them from the | | same relative positions they have to him/her in the virtual world._ | | | | Below follows a more detailed description both of the physical | | scenario underlying the use case and the created virtual scenario. | | | | 1. Physical scenario | | | | The physical VR conference scenario is illustrated in Fig. 1. Five | | VR conference users from different sites are virtually meeting. Each | | of them is using VR gear with binaural playback and video playback | | using an HMD. The equipment of all users supports movements in 6DOF | | with corresponding headtracking. The UEs of the users exchange coded | | audio up- and downstream with a VR conference call server. Visually, | | the users are represented through their respective avatars that can | | be rendered based on information related to relative position | | parameters and their rotational orientation. | | | | Figure 1: Physical scenario | | | | 2. Virtual scenario | | | | Fig. 2 illustrates the virtual conferencing space generated by the | | conference call server. Initially, the server places the conference | | users Ui, i=1...5, at virtual position coordinates K~i~ = (x~i~, | | y~i~, z~i~). The virtual conferencing space is shared between the | | users. Accordingly, the audio-visual render for each user takes | | place in that space. For instance, from user U5\'s perspective, the | | rendering will virtually place with the other conference | | participants at the relative positions K~i~ -- K~5~, i≠5. For | | example, user U5 will perceive user U2 at distance \|K~i~ -- K~5~\| | | and under the direction of the vector (K~i~ -- K~5~)/\|K~i~ -- | | K~5~\|, whereby the directional render is done relative to the | | rotational orientation of U5. Also illustrated in Fig. 2 is the | | movement of U5 towards U4. This movement will affect the position of | | U5 relative to the other users, which will be taken into account | | while rendering. At the same time the UE of U5 sends its changing | | position to the conferencing server, which updates the virtual | | conferencing space with the new coordinates of U5. As the virtual | | conferencing space is shared, users U1--U4 become aware of moving | | user U5 and can accordingly adapt their respective renders. The | | simultaneous movement of user U2 works according to corresponding | | principles. | | | | Figure 2: Virtual scenario | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Categorization** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Type: VR** | | | | **Degrees of Freedom: 6DoF** | | | | **Delivery: Interactive, Conversational** | | | | **Media Components: Audio-only, Audio-Visual** | | | | **Devices: VR gear with binaural playback and HMD video playback, | | Call server** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Preconditions** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | The described scenario relies on a conference call server. | | | | Similar scenarios can be realized without a server.

# A.16 Use Case 15: XR Meeting
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Use Case Name** | +======================================================================+ | XR Meeting | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Description** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | This use case is a mix of a physical and a virtual meeting. It is an | | XR extension of the virtual meeting place use case described in 3GPP | | TR 26.918. The use case is exemplified as follows: | | | | Company X organizes a workshop with discussions in a couple of | | smaller subgroups in a conference room, as for instance shown in the | | figure below. Each subgroup gathers around dedicated spots or tables | | and discusses a certain topic and participants are free to move to | | the subgroup of their interest. Remote participation is enabled. | | | | The main idea for the remote participants is to create a virtual, | | 3D-rendered space where they can meet and interact through their | | avatars with other people. This 3D-rendered virtual space is a | | simplified representation of the real conference room, with tables | | at the same positions as in the real world. Remote participants are | | equipped with HMD supporting binaural playback. A remote participant | | can move freely in the virtual conference room and interact with the | | different subgroups of people depending, for example, on the | | discussion they are having. A remote participant can speak to other | | participants in their immediate proximity and obtain a spatial audio | | rendering of what the other participants are saying. They can hear | | the real participants from their relative positions in the virtual | | world, and they can freely walk from one subgroup to another to | | seamlessly join different conversations that may happen concurrently | | in the meeting space. Consistent with the auditory scene, the remote | | participant will be able to see on the HMD a rendered \"Scene view\" | | of the complete virtual meeting space from their viewpoint, i.e. | | relative to position and viewing direction. As options, the remote | | participant may also select to see a \"Top view\" of the complete | | meeting space with all participants (or their avatars) or a \"Table | | view\". The latter is generated from a 360-degree video capture at | | the relevant table. The audio experience remains in any case as | | during \"Scene view\". | | | | The physical participants see and hear avatars representing the | | remote participants through AR Glasses supporting binaural playback. | | They interact with the avatars in the discussions as if these were | | physically present participants. For physical participants, the | | interactions with other physical and virtual participants happen in | | an augmented reality. In addition, at each subgroup meeting spot, a | | video screen displays a 360-degree panoramic \"Table view\" taken | | from the middle of the respective table, including the overlaid | | avatars of the remote participants taking part in the subgroup | | discussion. Also displayed is the complete meeting space with all | | participants (or their avatars) in a top view. | | | | A schematic of the configuration at the physical meeting space is | | shown in the following figure. In that figure, P1 through P4 | | represent the physical participants while V1 through V3 are the | | remote participants. Also shown are two subgroup meeting spots | | (tables), each with a 360-degree camera mounted on its center. | | Further, at each table the two video screens are shown for the | | 360-degree panoramic \"Table view\" and for the \"Top view\". | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Categorization** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Type: AR, VR, XR** | | | | **Degrees of Freedom: 6DoF** | | | | **Delivery: Interactive, Conversational** | | | | **Device: Phone, HMD with binaural playback support, AR Glasses with | | binaural playback support** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Preconditions** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | On a general level the assumption is that all physical attendees | | (inside the meeting facilities) wear a device capable of binaural | | playback and, preferably, AR glasses. Remote participants are | | equipped with HMDs supporting binaural playback. The meeting | | facility is a large conference room with a number of spatially | | separated spots (tables) for subgroup discussions. Each of these | | spots is equipped with at least one video screen. At each of the | | spots a 360-degree camera system is installed. | | | | [Specific minimum preconditions]{.underline} | | | | Remote participants: | | | | - UE with render capability through connected HMD supporting | | binaural playback. | | | | - Mono audio capture. | | | | - 6DOF Position tracking. | | | | Physical participants: | | | | - UE with render capability through **a non-occluded binaural | | playback system** and preferably, but not necessarily, AR Glasses. | | | | - Mono audio capture of each individual participant e.g. using | | attached mic or detached mic with suitable directivity and/or | | acoustic scene capture at dedicated subgroup spots (tables). | | | | - 6DOF Position tracking. | | | | Meeting facilities: | | | | - Acoustic scene capture at dedicated subgroup spots (tables) | | and/or mono audio capture of each individual participant. | | | | - 360-degree video capture at dedicated subgroup spots (tables). | | | | - Video screens (connected to driving UE/PC-client) at dedicated | | subgroup meeting spots visualizing participants including remote | | participants at a subgroup spot (\"Table view\") and/or positions of | | participants in shared meeting space in \"Top view\". | | | | Conference call server: | | | | - Maintenance of participant position data in shared virtual | | meeting space. | | | | - (Optional) synthesis of graphics visualizing positions of | | participants in shared meeting space in \"Top view\". | | | | - (Optional) generation of overlay/merge of synthesized avatars | | with 360-degree video to \"Table view\". | | | | [Media preconditions:]{.underline} | | | | Audio: | | | | - The capability of simultaneous spatial render of multiple | | received audio streams according to their associated 6DOF | | attributes. | | | | - Adequate adjustments of the rendered scene upon rotational and | | translational movements of the listener\'s head. | | | | Video/Graphics: | | | | - 360-degree video capture at subgroup meeting spots. | | | | - Support of simultaneous graphics render of multiple avatars | | according to their associated 6DOF attributes, including position, | | orientation, directivity: | | | | - Render on AR glasses. | | | | - Render on HMDs. | | | | - Overlay/merge synthesized avatars with 360-degree video to | | \"Table view\": | | | | - Render as panoramic view on video screen. | | | | - VR Render on HMD excluding a segment containing the remote | | participant itself. | | | | - Synthesis of \"Top view\" graphics visualizing positions of | | participants in shared meeting space. | | | | Media synchronization and presentation format control: | | | | - Required for controlling the flow and proper render of the | | various used media types. | | | | [System preconditions:]{.underline} | | | | - A metadata framework for the representation and transmission of | | positional information of an audio sending endpoint, including 6DOF | | attributes, including position, orientation, directivity. | | | | - Maintenance of a shared virtual meeting space that intersects | | consistently with the physical meeting space: | | | | Real and virtual participant positions are merged into a combined | | shared virtual meeting space that is consistent with the positions | | of the real participant positions in the physical meeting space. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Requirements and QoS/QoE Considerations** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | QoS: conversational requirements as for MTSI, using RTP for Audio | | and Video transport. | | | | - Audio: Relatively low bit rate requirements, that will meet | | conversational latency requirements. | | | | - 360-degree video: Specified in TS 26.118, and will meet | | conversational latency requirements. It is assumed that remote | | participants will at each time receive only the 360-degree video | | stream of a single subgroup meeting spot (typically the closest). | | | | - Graphics for representing participants in shared meeting space | | may rely on a vector-graphics media format, see e.g. 26.140. The | | associated bit rates are low. Graphics synthesis may also be done | | locally in render devices, based on positional information of | | participants in shared meeting space. | | | | QoE: Immersive voice/audio and visual experience, Quality of the | | mixing of virtual objects into real scenes. | | | | The described scenario provides the remote users with a 6DOF VR | | meeting experience and the auditory experience of being physically | | present in the physical meeting space. Quality of Experience for the | | audio aspect can further be enhanced if the user\'s UEs not only | | share their position but also their orientation. This will allow | | render of the other virtual users not only at their positions in the | | virtual conference space but additionally with proper rotational | | orientation. This is of use if the audio subsystem and the avatars | | associated with the virtual users support directivity, such as | | specific audio characteristics related to face and back.\ | | The \"Scene view\" for the remote participants allows consistent | | rendering of the audio with the 3D-rendered graphics video of the | | meeting space. However, that view obviously compromises naturalness | | and \"being-there\" experience through the mere visual presentation | | of the participants through avatars. The optional \"Table view\" may | | improve the naturalness as it relies on a real 360-degree video | | capture. However, QoE of that view is compromised since the | | 360-degree camera position does not coincide with virtual position | | of remote user. Viewpoint correction techniques may be used to | | mitigate this problem. | | | | The physical meeting users experience the remote participants | | audio-visually at virtual positions as if these were physically | | present and as if they could come closer or move around like | | physical users. The AR glasses display the avatars of the remote | | participants at positions and in orientation matching the auditory | | perception. Physical participants without AR glasses get a visual | | impression of where the remote participants are located in relation | | to the own position through the video screens at the subgroup | | meeting spots with the offered \"Table view\" and/or the \"Top | | view\". | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Feasibility** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Under \"Preconditions\" the minimum preconditions are detailed and | | broken down by all involved nodes of the service, such as remote | | participants, physical participants, meeting facilities and | | conference call server. In summary, the following capabilities and | | technologies are required:** | | | | - UE with render capability through connected HMD supporting | | binaural playback. | | | | - UE with render capability through a non-occluded binaural | | playback system and preferably, but not necessarily, AR Glasses. | | | | - Mono audio capture and/or acoustic scene capture. | | | | - 6DOF position tracking. | | | | - 360-degree video capture at dedicated subgroup spots. | | | | - Video screens (connected to driving UE/PC-client) at dedicated | | subgroup meeting spots visualizing participants including remote | | participants at a subgroup spot (\"Table view\") and/or positions of | | participants in shared meeting space in \"Top view\". | | | | - Maintenance of participant position data in shared virtual | | meeting space. | | | | - (Optional) synthesis of graphics visualizing positions of | | participants in shared meeting space in \"Top view\". | | | | - (Optional) generation of overlay/merge of synthesized avatars | | with 360-degree video to \"Table view\". | | | | While the suggested AR glasses for the physical meeting participants | | are very desirable for high QoE, the use case is fully feasible | | without glasses. Immersion is in that case merely provided through | | the audio media component. Thus, **none of the preconditions | | constitute a feasibility barrier, given the technologies widely | | available and affordable today.** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Potential Standardization Status and Needs** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | - Requires standardization of at least a 6DOF metadata framework | | and a 6DOF capable renderer for immersive voice and audio. | | | | - The presently ongoing IVAS codec work item may provide an | | immersive voice and audio codec/renderer and a metadata framework | | that may meet these requirements. | | | | - Other media (non-audio) may rely on existing video/graphics | | coding standards available to 3GPP. | | | | - Also required are suitable session protocols coordinating the | | distribution and proper rendering of the media flows. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
# A.17 Use Case 16: Convention / Poster Session
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Use Case Name** | +======================================================================+ | Convention / Poster Session | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Description** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | This use case is exemplified with a conference with poster session | | that offers virtual participation from a remote location. | | | | It is assumed that the poster session may be real, however, to | | contribute to meeting climate goals, the conference organizers are | | offering a green participation option. This is, a virtual attendance | | option is offered to participants and presenters, as an ecological | | alternative avoiding travelling. | | | | The conference space is organized in a few poster booths, possibly | | separated by some shields. In some of the booths, posters are | | presented by real presenters, in some other booths, posters are | | presented by remote presenters. The audience of the poster | | presentations may be a mix of physically present and remote | | participants. Each booth is equipped with a first video screen for | | the poster display and one or two additional video screens for the | | display of a \"Top view\" and/or the display of a panoramic \"Poster | | presentation view\". Each booth is further equipped with a | | 360-degree camera system capturing the scene next to the poster. The | | conference space is visualized in the following figure, which | | essentially corresponds to the \"Top view\". In this figure, P1-P6 | | represent physical attendees, V1-V4 are remote attendees, PX and VY | | are real and, respectively, remote presenters. There are two poster | | presentations of posters X and Y. Participants V4, P5 and P6 are | | standing together for a chat. | | | | Physical attendees and presenters have the experience of an almost | | conventional poster conference, with the difference that they see | | remote persons through their AR glasses, represented as avatars. | | They hear the remote persons through their binaural playback | | systems. They can also interact in discussions with remote persons | | like they were physically present. Physical presenters use a digital | | pointing device to highlight the parts of their poster that they | | want to explain. The physical audience attends the poster | | presentation of a remote presenter in some dedicated physical spots | | of the conference area that is very similar to the poster booth of a | | physical presenter. The participants see and hear the virtual | | presenter through their AR glasses supporting binaural playback. | | They also see and hear the other audience that may be physically | | present or just be represented though avatars. | | | | Remote participants are equipped with HMD supporting binaural | | playback. They are virtually present and can walk from poster to | | poster. They can listen to ongoing poster presentations and move | | closer to a presentation if they think the topic or the ongoing | | discussion is interesting. A remote participant can speak to other | | participant in his/her immediate proximity and obtain a spatial | | rendering of what the other participants in his/her immediate | | proximity are saying. He/she can hear them from the relative | | positions they have to him/her in the virtual world. Consistent with | | the auditory scene, the remote participant will be able to see on | | the HMD a synthesized \"Scene view\" of the complete conference | | space (including the posters) from his/her viewpoint, i.e. relative | | to position and viewing direction. The remote participant may also | | select to see a \"Top view\", which is an overview of the complete | | conference space with all participants (or their avatars) and | | posters or to see a \"Poster presentation view\". The latter is a VR | | view generated from the 360-degree video capture at the relevant | | poster but excluding a segment containing the remote participant | | itself. The audio experience remains in any case as during \"Scene | | view\". In order to give the remote participants the possibility to | | interact in the poster discussions, they also have the possibility | | to use their VR controller as a pointing device to highlight certain | | parts of the poster, for instance when they have a specific | | question. | | | | Remote presenters are equipped with HMD supporting binaural playback | | and a VR controller. Most relevant for them is the \"Scene view\" in | | which they see (in their proximity) their audience represented by | | avatars. This view is overlaid with their own poster. They use their | | VR controller as a pointing device to highlight a part of the poster | | that they want to explain to the audience. It may happen that a | | remote presenter sees some colleague passing by and, to attract | | her/him to the poster, they may take some steps towards that | | colleague and call out to her/him. | | | | The remote participants are represented at the real event through | | their avatars, which the real participants and presenters see and | | hear through their AR glasses supporting binaural playback. The real | | and virtual participants and the presenter interact in discussions | | as if everybody was physically present. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Categorization** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Type: AR, VR, XR** | | | | **Degrees of Freedom: 6DoF** | | | | **Delivery: Interactive, Conversational** | | | | **Device: Phone, HMD with binaural playback support, AR Glasses with | | binaural playback support, VR controller/pointing device** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Preconditions** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | On a general level the assumption is all physical attendees (inside | | the conference facilities) wear a device capable of binaural | | playback.

# A.18 Use Case 17: AR animated avatar calls
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Use Case Name** | +======================================================================+ | AR animated avatar call | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Description** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | This use case is about a call scenario between one user wearing AR | | glasses and the other user using a phone in handset mode.

Alice doesn\'t have a camera facing at her, therefore a | | recorded 3D image of her is sent to Tina as the call is initiated. | | The 3D image Alice sent can be animated, following Alice\'s actions. | | As Alice holds her phone in handset mode, her head movements result | | in corresponding animations of her transmitted 3D image, giving Tina | | the impression that Alice is attentive. | | | | NOTE: An option for this use case is a \"mute animations\" control. | | Note that Alice didn\'t press the \"mute animations\" button that | | would have disabled all animations of her 3D image for Tina. | | | | As Tina\'s AR glasses also include a pair of headphones, Alice\' | | mono audio is rendered binaurally at the position where she is | | displayed on Tina\'s AR glasses. Tina also has interactivity | | settings, allowing to lock Alice\'s position on her AR screen. | | Therefore, her visual and auditory appearance moves when Tina | | rotates her head. As Tina disables the position lock, the visual and | | auditory appearance of Alice is placed within Tina\'s real world and | | thus Tina\'s head rotation leads to compensation on the screen and | | audio appearance, requiring visual and binaural audio rendering with | | scene displacement. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Type: AR** | | | | **Degrees of Freedom: 2D, 3DoF** | | | | **Delivery: Conversational** | | | | **Device: Phone, HMD, Glasses, headphones** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Preconditions** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | AR participants: Phone with tethered AR glasses and headphones (with | | acoustic transparency). | | | | Phone participant: Phone with motion sensor and potentially | | proximity sensor to detect handset mode. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Requirements and QoS/QoE Considerations** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | QoS: QoS requirements like MTSI requirements (conversational, RTP), | | e.g. 5QI 1. | | | | QoE: Immersive voice/audio and visual experience, Quality of the | | mixing of virtual objects (avatars) into real scenes and rendering | | an audio overlaid to the real acoustic environment. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Feasibility** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | AR glasses in various form factors exist, including motion sensing | | and inside-out tracking.

# A.19 Use Case 18: AR avatar multi-party calls
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Use Case Name** | +======================================================================+ | AR avatar multi-party call | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Description** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | This use case is about multi-party communication with spatial audio | | rendering, where avatars and audio of each participant are | | transmitted and spatially rendered in the direction of their | | geolocation. Each participant is equipped with AR glasses with | | external or built-in head phones. 3D audio can be captured and | | transmitted instead of mono, which leads to enhancements when | | sharing the audio experience. | | | | A potential user experience is described as a user story: | | | | Bob, Jeff, and Frank are in Venice and walking around the old city | | sightseeing. They are all wearing AR glasses with a mobile | | connection via their smartphone. The AR glasses support audio | | spatialization, e.g. via binaural rendering and playback over the | | built-in headphones, allowing the real world to be augmented with | | visuals and audio. | | | | They start a multi-party call, where each of them gets the other two | | friends displayed on his AR glasses and can hear the audio. While | | they walk around in the silent streets, they have a continuous voice | | call with the avatars displayed on their AR glasses, while also | | other information is displayed to direct them to the secret places | | of Venice. Each of them transmits his current location to his | | friends. Their AR glasses / headphones place the others visually and | | acoustically (i.e. binaurally rendered) in the direction where the | | others are. Thus, they all at least know the direction of the | | others. | | | | As Jeff wants to buy some ice cream, he switches to push-to-talk to | | not annoy his friends with all the interactions he has with the ice | | cream shop. | | | | As Bob gets closer to Piazza San Marco the environment gets noisier | | with sitting and flying pigeons surrounding him. Bob turns on the | | \"hear what I hear\" feature to give them an impression on the | | fascinating environment, sending 3D audio of the scene to Frank and | | Jeff. As they got interested, they also want to experience the | | pigeons around them and walk through the city to the square. Each of | | the friends is still placed on the AR glasses visually and | | acoustically in the direction where the friend is, which makes it | | easy for them to find Piazza San Marco and for Frank to just walk | | across the square to Bob as he approaches him. Jeff, who still eats | | his ice cream is now also coming closer to Piazza San Marco and just | | walks directly to Bob and Jeff. As they get close to each other they | | are no longer rendered (avatars and audio), based on the positional | | information, and they simply chat with each other. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Type: AR** | | | | **Degrees of Freedom: 3DoF** | | | | **Delivery: Conversational** | | | | **Device: AR glasses, headphones** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Preconditions** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Connected AR glasses or phone with tethered AR glasses and | | headphones (with acoustic transparency). | | | | Positioning support (e.g. using GNSS) to derive geolocation, | | allowing calculation of relative position. | | | | 3D audio capturing (e.g. using microphone arrays) and rendering. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Requirements and QoS/QoE Considerations** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | QoS: QoS requirements like MTSI requirements for voice/audio and | | avatars (conversational, RTP), e.g. 5QI 1 for audio. | | | | QoE: Immersive voice/audio and visual experience, Quality of the | | capturing and rendering of avatars, the different participants and | | 3D audio. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Feasibility** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | AR glasses in various form factors exist. Those usually include | | motion sensors, e.g. based on accelerometers, gyroscopes, and | | magnetometers, but also cameras are common, allowing inside-out | | tracking and augmentation of the real world. | | | | 3D audio capturing and rendering are available, e.g. using spherical | | or arbitrary microphone arrays for capturing and using binaural | | rendering technologies for audio spatialization. | | | | An audio-only solution using headphones and head-tracking is easier | | to implement, this would however remove the possibility to visually | | augment the real world and display avatars. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Potential Standardization Status and Needs** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Visual coding and transmission of avatars | | | | Audio coding and transmission of mono objects and 3D audio for | | streams from all participants | | | | NOTE: scene composition is usually a differentiating factor | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
# A.20 Use Case 19: Front-facing camera video multi-party calls
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Use Case Name** | +======================================================================+ | Front-facing camera video multi-party call | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Description** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | This use case is based on front-facing camera calls, i.e. a user is | | having a video call, seeing the other participants on the display of | | e.g. a smartphone he holds at arm\'s length. The use case has some | | overlap with UC 6 (AR face-to-face calls) and UC 10 (Real-time 3D | | Communication), extended by spatial audio rendering for | | headphones/headsets. The spatial audio rendering is based on the | | head-tracker data extracted from the smartphones front-facing | | camera, giving a user the impression, even with movements, that the | | voice of the other participants originates from a virtual stage in | | the direction of the phone with the video of the other\'s faces. | | | | A potential user experience is described as a user story: | | | | Bob, Jeff, and Frank are back in New York City and each of them is | | walking to work. They just have their smart phones with a | | front-facing camera and a small headset, allowing the real world to | | be augmented with audio. | | | | They start a multi-party video call to discuss the plans for the | | evening, where each of them gets the other two friends displayed on | | the phone and can hear the audio, coming from the direction on the | | horizontal plane where the phone is placed in their hand and some | | small spread to allow easy distinction. While they walk around in | | the streets of New York, they have a continuous voice call with | | their phones at arm\'s length, with the, potentially cut-out, faces | | of their pals displayed on their phones. For Bob the acoustic front | | is always in the direction of his phone, thus the remote | | participants are always in the front. When Bob rotates his head | | though, the front-facing camera tracks this rotation and the spatial | | audio is binauralized using the head-tracking information, leaving | | the position of the other participants steady relative to the | | phone\'s position. As Bob turns around a corner with the phone still | | at arm\'s length for the video call using the front-facing camera, | | his friends remain steady relative to the phone\'s position. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Type: AR** | | | | **Degrees of Freedom: 3DoF** | | | | **Delivery: Conversational** | | | | **Device: Smartphone with front-facing camera, headset , AR | | glasses** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Preconditions** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Phone with front-facing camera, motion sensors, and headset (more or | | less acoustically transparent).

# A.21 Use Case 20: AR Streaming with Localization Registry
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Use Case Description: AR Streaming with Localization Registry** | +======================================================================+ | A group of friends has arrived at a museum. The museum provides them | | with an AR guide for the exhibits. The museum\'s exhibition space | | has been earlier scanned and registered via one of the museum\'s AR | | devices to a Spatial Computing Service. The service allows storing, | | recalling and updating of spatial configuration of the exhibition | | space by a registered AR device. Visitors\' AR devices (to be used | | by museum guests as AR guides) have downloaded the spatial | | configuration upon entering the museum and are ready to use. | | | | The group proceeds to the exhibit together with their AR guides, | | which receive a VoD stream of the museum guide with the identifier | | Group A. Registered surfaces next to exhibits are used for | | displaying the video content (may be 2D or 3D content) of the guide. | | In the case of spatial audio content, this may be presented in | | relation to the registered surfaces. The VoD stream playback is | | synched amongst the users of Group A. Any user within the group can | | pause, rewind or fast forward the content, and this affects the | | playback for all the members of the group. Since all users view the | | content together, this allows them to experience the exhibit as a | | group, and discuss during pauses without affecting the content | | streams for other museum visitors that they are physically sharing | | the space with. Other groups in the museum use the same spatial | | configuration, but their VoD content is synched within their own | | group. | | | | The use case can be extended to private spaces, e.g., a group of | | friends gathered at their friend Alice\'s house to watch a movie. | | Alice\'s living room is registered already under her home profile on | | the Spatial Computing Service; the saved information includes her | | preferred selection of the living room wall as the movie screening | | surface. She shares this configuration via the service with her | | guests. | | | | In this use case, the interaction with a travel guide avatar may | | also occur in a conversational fashion. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Categorization** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Type: AR and Social AR** | | | | **Degrees of Freedom: 6DoF** | | | | **Delivery: Streaming, Interactive, Conversational** | | | | **Device: AR glasses with binaural audio playback support** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Preconditions** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | The use case requires technical solutions for the following | | functions: | | | | **Spatial Computing Service** | | | | A 5G service that registers users and stores their indoor spatial | | configuration with the following features: | | | | - Reception of a stream of visual features for a space to be | | registered. The input may be from a mobile phone camera, an AR | | device or a combination of data from multiple sensors and cameras | | located in the space. | | | | - Usage of a localization algorithm such as SLAM (Simultaneous | | Localization and Mapping) for indoor spatial localization, and the | | storage of special configurations, such as the selection of | | particular surfaces for special functions (e.g., wall for displaying | | a video stream). | | | | - Distribution of previously stored information to other devices | | belonging to the same user or to other authorized users. | | | | - Updating of localization information and redistribution when | | required. | | | | **Content synchronization** | | | | A streaming server that distributes content and ensures synchronized | | content playback for multiple AR users. The server does not need to | | have the content stored locally. It can, for example, get the | | content stream from a streaming service and then redistribute it. | | For the museum guests, the functionality may be part of the XR | | client or embedded in a home gateway or console-like device. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **QoS/QoE Considerations** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | - Required QoS: | | | | - Sufficiently low latency for synchronized streaming playback and | | conversational QoS. | | | | - Required QoE: | | | | - Synchronization of VoD content for multiple users within | | acceptable parameters. This requires ensuring the streams\' playback | | occurs near simultaneously for all users, so that user reactions to | | specific scenes such as jump scares in a horror movie or a goal in a | | sport sequence are also synced within the group. Furthermore, | | playback reaction time to user actions such as pause, fast forward | | and rewind should be low and similar for all users within the group. | | Conversational low-delay QoE is also expected. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Feasibility** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | The use case is feasible within a timeframe of 3 years. Required | | hardware, AR glasses, are available in the market, and network | | requirements are no more or less than existing streaming services. | | | | The feasibility of the use case depends on the accuracy of the | | localization registration and mapping algorithm. Multiparty AR | | experiences, such as a shared AR map annotation demo from Mapbox | | (https://blo | | g.mapbox.com/multi-user-ar-experience-1a586f40b2ce?gi=60ceb3226701) | | and the Multiuser AR experience exhibition at the San Fransisco | | Museum of Modern Art by Ubiquity6 | | (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-I3YG_w-Z4), provide good | | examples for proof of concept of already available technology for | | creating a shared AR experience. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Potential Standardization Status and Needs** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | The following aspects may require standardization work: | | | | - Standardized way of sharing and storing indoor spatial | | information with the service and other devices. | | | | - Mixing VoD streams may require some additional functions for | | social AR media control playback. This would relate to allowing | | users to control the playout of the VoD stream (pause, rewind, | | fast-forward) for all users in a synchronized manner. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

# A.23 Use Case 22: 5G Online Gaming party
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Use Case Description: 5G Online Gaming party** | +======================================================================+ | In an extension to use case 5 in Annex A.6 on Online Immersive | | Gaming experience, the users join a Gaming Party either physically | | or virtually in order to experience maximum and controlled user | | experience.

# A.24 Use Case 23: 5G Shared Spatial Data
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Use Case Description: Shared Spatial Data** | +======================================================================+ | Consider as an example people moving through Heathrow airport. The | | environment is supported by spatial map sharing, spatial anchors, | | and downloading/streaming location based digital content. The | | airport is a huge dynamic environment with thousands of people | | congregating. Spatial maps and content will change frequently. | | Whereas base maps have been produced by professional scanners, they | | are continuously updated and improved by crowd sourced data. | | Semi-dynamic landmarks such a growing tree, a new park bench, or | | holiday decorations are incorporated into the base map via crowd | | sourced data. Based on this individuals have their own maps and | | portions of those maps may be shared with friends nearby. One could | | imagine spatial content will consume as much bandwidth as permitted, | | be it a high resolution volumetric marketing gimmick with virtually | | landing Concorde in Heathrow or a simple overlay outside a lounge | | showing the current wait time for getting access. | | | | As people walk through 1km+ size spaces like the airport, they\'ll | | be progressively downloading updates and discarding map information | | that is no longer relevant. Similar to data flows in Google maps, | | smartphones continually send location and 3D positioning data (GPS, | | WiFi, scans, etc...) to the cloud in order to improve and augment 3D | | information. AR maps and content will in all likelihood be similarly | | layered, dynamic, and progressively downloaded. Spatial AR maps will | | be a mixture of underlying living spatial maps and digital content | | items. | | | | The use case addresses several scenarios: | | | | - Co-located people wearing an XR HMD collaboratively interact with | | a detailed 3D virtual model from their own perspective into a shared | | coordinate system (using a shared map). | | | | - One person wearing an XR HMD places virtual objects at locations | | in 3D space for later discovery by other\'s wearing an XR HMD. This | | requires a shared map and shared digital assets. | | | | - XR clients continuously send sensing data to a cloud service. The | | service constructs a detailed and timely map from client | | contributions and provides the map back to clients. | | | | - An XR HMD receives a detailed reconstruction of a space, | | potentially captured by a device(s) with superior sensing and | | processing capabilities. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Categorization** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Type: AR** | | | | **Degrees of Freedom: 6DoF** | | | | **Delivery: Streaming, Interactive, Split, device-to-device, | | different types** | | | | **Device: HMD, AR Glasses** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **Preconditions** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | - Application is installed on an HMD or phone with connected AR | | glass | | | | - The application uses existing HW capabilities on the device, | | rendering functionalities as well as sensors.
