# Introduction
The need to support different kinds of UEs (e.g. for the Internet of Things
(IoT)), services, and technologies is driving the technology revolution to a
high-performance and highly efficient 3GPP system. The drivers include IoT,
Virtual Reality (VR), industrial control, ubiquitous on-demand coverage, as
well as the opportunity to meet customized market needs. These drivers require
enhancements to the devices, services, and technologies well established by
3GPP. The key objective with the 5G system is to be able to support new
deployment scenarios to address diverse market segments.
This document compiles requirements that define a 5G system.
The 5G system is characterised, for example, by:
\- Support for multiple access technologies
\- Scalable and customizable network
\- Advanced Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (e.g. availability, latency,
reliability, user experienced data rates, area traffic capacity)
\- Flexibility and programmability (e.g. network slicing, diverse mobility
management, Network Function Virtualization)
\- Resource efficiency (both user plane and control plane)
\- Seamless mobility in densely populated and heterogeneous environment
\- Support for real time and non-real time multimedia services and
applications with advanced Quality of Experience (QoE)
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the service and operational requirements for a
5G system, including a UE, NG-RAN, and 5G Core network. Requirements for a 5G
E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity in E-UTRAN connected to EPC are found in TS 22.278
[5].

# 4 Overview
Unlike previous 3GPP systems that attempted to provide a \'one size fits all\'
system, the 5G system is expected to be able to provide optimized support for
a variety of different services, different traffic loads, and different end
user communities. Various industry white papers, most notably, the NGMN 5G
White Paper [2], describe a multi-faceted 5G system capable of simultaneously
supporting multiple combinations of reliability, latency, throughput,
positioning, and availability. This technology revolution is achievable with
the introduction of new technologies, both in access and the core, such as
flexible, scalable assignment of network resources. In addition to increased
flexibility and optimization, a 5G system needs to support stringent KPIs for
latency, reliability, throughput, etc. Enhancements in the radio interface
contribute to meeting these KPIs as do enhancements in the core network, such
as network slicing, in-network caching and hosting services closer to the end
points.
A 5G system also supports new business models such as those for IoT and
enterprise managed networks. Drivers for the 5G KPIs include services such as
Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control, Augmented Reality (AR), and factory
automation. Network flexibility enhancements support self-contained enterprise
networks, installed and maintained by network operators while being managed by
the enterprise. Enhanced connection modes and evolved security facilitate
support of massive IoT, expected to include tens of millions of UEs sending
and receiving data over the 5G network.
Flexible network operations are the mainstay of the 5G system. The
capabilities to provide this flexibility include network slicing, network
capability exposure, scalability, and diverse mobility. Other network
operations requirements address the necessary control and data plane resource
efficiencies, as well as network configurations that optimize service delivery
by minimizing routing between end users and application servers. Enhanced
charging and security mechanisms handle new types of UEs connecting to the
network in different ways. The enhanced flexibility of the 5G system also
allows to cater to the needs of various verticals. For example, the 5G system
introduces the concept of non-public networks providing exclusive access for a
specific set of users and specific purpose(s). Non-public networks can,
depending on deployment and (national) regulations, support different subsets
of 5G functionality. In this specification 5G network requirements apply to
both NPNs and PLMNs, unless specified otherwise. Additionally, there are
specific requirements dedicated only to NPNs or PLMNs, which are indicated
accordingly. More information can be found in Section 6.25.
Mobile Broadband (MBB) enhancements aim to meet a number of new KPIs. These
pertain to high data rates, high user density, high user mobility, highly
variable data rates, deployment, and coverage. High data rates are driven by
the increasing use of data for services such as streaming (e.g. video, music,
and user generated content), interactive services (e.g. AR), and IoT. These
services come with stringent requirements for user experienced data rates as
well as associated requirements for latency to meet service requirements.
Additionally, increased coverage in densely populated areas such as sports
arenas, urban areas, and transportation hubs has become essential for
pedestrians and users in urban vehicles. New KPIs on traffic and connection
density enable both the transport of high volumes of data traffic per area
(traffic density) and transport of data for a high number of connections (e.g.
UE density or connection density). Many UEs are expected to support a variety
of services which exchange either a very large (e.g. streaming video) or very
small (e.g. data burst) amount of data. The 5G system will handle this
variability in a resource efficient manner. All of these cases introduce new
deployment requirements for indoor and outdoor, local area connectivity, high
user density, wide area connectivity, and UEs travelling at high speeds.
Another aspect of 5G KPIs includes requirements for various combinations of
latency and reliability, as well as higher accuracy for positioning. These
KPIs are driven by support for both commercial and public safety services. On
the commercial side, industrial control, industrial automation, UAV control,
and AR are examples of those services. Services such as UAV control will
require more precise positioning information that includes altitude, speed,
and direction, in addition to horizontal coordinates.
Support for Massive Internet of Things (MIoT) brings many new requirements in
addition to those for the enhanced KPIs. The expansion of connected things
introduces a need for significant improvements in resource efficiency in all
system components (e.g. UEs, IoT devices, radio, access network, core
network).
The 5G system also aims to enhance its capability to meet KPIs that emerging
V2X applications require. For these advanced applications, the requirements,
such as data rate, reliability, latency, communication range and speed, are
made more stringent.
# 5 High-level requirements
## 5.1 Migration to 5G
### 5.1.1 Description
The 5G system supports most of the existing EPS services, in addition to many
new services. The existing EPS services can be accessed using the new 5G
access technologies even where the EPS specifications might indicate E-UTRA(N)
only. Only new or changed service requirements for new or changed services are
specified in this TS. The few EPS capabilities that are not supported by the
5G system are identified in clause 5.1.2.2 below.
### 5.1.2 Requirements
#### 5.1.2.1 Interworking between 5G systems
The 5G system shall support a UE with a 5G subscription roaming into a 5G
Visited Mobile Network which has a roaming agreement with the UE\'s 5G Home
Mobile Network.
The 5G system shall enable a Visited Mobile Network to provide support for
establishing home network provided data connectivity as well as visited
network provided data connectivity.
The 5G system shall enable a Visited Mobile Network to provide support for
services provided in the home network as well as provide services in the
visited network. Whether a service is provided in the visited network or in
the home network is determined on a service by service basis.
The 5G system shall provide a mechanism for a network operator to limit access
to its services for a roaming UE, (e.g. based on roaming agreement).
The 5G system shall provide a mechanism for a network operator to direct a UE
onto a partnership network for routing all or some of the UE user plane and
associated control plane traffic over the partnership network, subject to an
agreement between the operators.
#### 5.1.2.2 Legacy service support
In principle, the 5G system shall support all EPS capabilities (e.g. from TSs
22.011, 22.101, 22.278, 22.185, 22.071, 22.115, 22.153, 22.173, 22.468).
However,
\- voice service continuity from NG-RAN to GERAN shall not be supported,
\- voice service continuity from NG-RAN to UTRAN CS should be supported (see
Note),
\- voice service continuity from GERAN to NG-RAN shall not be supported,
\- voice service continuity from UTRAN to NG-RAN shall not be supported,
\- CS fallback from NG-RAN to GERAN shall not be supported,
\- CS fallback from NG-RAN to UTRAN shall not be supported,
\- seamless handover between NG-RAN and GERAN shall not be supported,
\- seamless handover between NG-RAN and UTRAN shall not be supported,
\- access to a 5G core network via GERAN or UTRAN shall not be supported,
\- video service continuity between 5GS and UMTS shall not be supported,
\- IP address preservation for PS service when UE moves between 5GS and
GSM/UMTS shall not be supported, and
\- Service continuity between 5GS and CDMA2000 shall not be supported.
NOTE: Architectural or protocol changes needed to support voice service
continuity from NG-RAN to UTRAN CS are expected to have minimum impact on
architecture, specifications, or the development of the 5G New Core and New
Radio.
#### 5.1.2.3 Interoperability with legacy 3GPP systems
The 5G system shall support mobility procedures between a 5G core network and
an EPC with minimum impact to the user experience (e.g. QoS, QoE).
# 6 Basic capabilities
## 6.1 Network slicing
### 6.1.1 Description
Network slicing allows the operator to provide customised networks. For
example, there can be different requirements on functionality (e.g. priority,
charging, policy control, security, and mobility), differences in performance
requirements (e.g. latency, mobility, availability, reliability and data
rates), or they can serve only specific users (e.g. MPS users, Public Safety
users, corporate customers, roamers, or hosting an MVNO).
A network slice can provide the functionality of a complete network, including
radio access network functions, core network functions (e.g. potentially from
different vendors) and IMS functions. One network can support one or several
network slices.
### 6.1.2 Requirements
#### 6.1.2.1 General
The serving 5G network shall support providing connectivity to home and
roaming users in the same network slice.
In shared 5G network configuration, each operator shall be able to apply all
the requirements from this clause to their allocated network resources.
The 5G system shall be able to support IMS as part of a network slice.
The 5G system shall be able to support IMS independent of network slices.
For a UE authorized to access multiple network slices of one operator which
cannot be simultaneously used by the UE (e.g. due to radio frequency
restrictions), the 5G system shall be able to support the UE to access the
most suitable network slice in minimum time (e.g. based on the location of the
UE, ongoing applications, UE capability, frequency configured for the network
slice).
5G system shall minimize signalling exchange and service interruption time for
a network slice, e.g. when restrictions related to radio resources change
(e.g., frequencies, RATs).

#### 6.1.2.3 Network slice constraints
The 5G system shall support a mechanism to prevent a UE from trying to access

## 6.2 Diverse mobility management
### 6.2.1 Description
A key feature of 5G is support for UEs with different mobility management
needs. 5G will support UEs with a range of mobility management needs,
including UEs that are
\- stationary during their entire usable life (e.g. sensors embedded in
infrastructure),
\- stationary during active periods, but nomadic between activations (e.g.
fixed access),
\- mobile within a constrained and well-defined space (e.g. in a factory), and
\- fully mobile.
Moreover, some applications require the network to ensure seamless mobility of
a UE so that mobility is hidden from the application layer to avoid
interruptions in service delivery while other applications have application
specific means to ensure service continuity. But these other applications can
still require the network to minimize interruption time to ensure that their
application-specific means to ensure service continuity work effectively.
With the ever-increasing multimedia broadband data volumes, it is also
important to enable the offloading of IP traffic from the 5G network onto
traditional IP routing networks via an IP anchor node close to the network
edge. As the UE moves, changing the IP anchor node can be needed in order to
reduce the traffic load in the system, reduce end-to-end latency and provide a
better user experience.
The flexible nature of a 5G system will support different mobility management
methods that minimize signalling overhead and optimize access for these
different types of UEs.
### 6.2.2 General requirements

intra- access technology changes for some or all connections associated with a

## 6.4 Resource efficiency
### 6.4.1 Description
5G introduces the opportunity to design a system to be optimized for
supporting diverse UEs and services. While support for IoT is provided by EPS,
there is room for improvement in efficient resource utilization that can be
designed into a 5G system whereas they are not easily retrofitted into an
existing system. Some of the underlying principles of the potential service
and network operation requirements associated with efficient configuration,
deployment, and use of UEs in the 5G network include bulk provisioning,
resource efficient access, optimization for UE originated data transfer, and
efficiencies based on the reduced needs related to mobility management for
stationary UEs and UEs with restricted range of movement.
As sensors and monitoring UEs are deployed more extensively, the need to
support UEs that send data packages ranging in size from a small status update
in a few bits to streaming video increases. A similar need exists for smart
phones with widely varying amounts of data. Specifically, to support short
data bursts, the network should be able to operate in a mode where there is no
need for a lengthy and high overhead signalling procedure before and after
small amounts of data are sent. The system will, as a result, avoid both a
negative impact to battery life for the UE and wasting signalling resources.
For small form factor UEs it will be challenging to have more than 1 antenna
due to the inability to get good isolation between multiple antennas. Thus,
these UEs need to meet the expected performance in a 5G network with only one
antenna.
Cloud applications like cloud robotics perform computation in the network
rather than in a UE, which requires the system to have high data rate in the
uplink and very low round trip latency. Supposed that high density cloud
robotics will be deployed in the future, the 5G system need to optimize the
resource efficiency for such scenario.
Additional resource efficiencies will contribute to meeting the various KPIs
defined for 5G. Control plane resource efficiencies can be achieved by
optimizing and minimizing signalling overhead, particularly for small data
transmissions. Mechanisms for minimizing user plane resources utilization
include in-network caching and application in a Service Hosting Environment
closer to the end user. These optimization efforts contribute to achieving
lower latency and higher reliability.
Diverse mobility management related resource efficiencies are covered in
clause 6.2.
Security related resource efficiencies are covered in clause 8.8.

The 5G network shall optimize the resource use of the control plane and/or
user plane to support high density connections (e.g. 1 million connections per
square kilometre) taking into account, for example, the following criteria:
\- type of mobility support;
\- communication pattern (e.g. send-only, frequent or infrequent);
\- characteristics of payload (e.g. small or large size data payload);

5G is designed to meet diverse services with different and enhanced
performances (e.g. high throughput, low latency and massive connections) and
data traffic model (e.g. IP data traffic, non-IP data traffic, short data
bursts and high throughput data transmissions).
User plane should be more efficient for 5G to support differentiated
requirements. On one hand, a Service Hosting Environment located inside of
operator\'s network can offer Hosted Services closer to the end user to meet
localization requirement like low latency, low bandwidth pressure. These
Hosted Services contain applications provided by operators and/or trusted 3rd
parties. On the other hand, user plane paths can be selected or changed to
improve the user experience or reduce the bandwidth pressure, when a UE or
application changes location during an active communication.
The 5G network can also support multiple wireless backhaul connections (e.g.
satellites and/or terrestrial), and efficiently route and/or bundle traffic
among them.
### 6.5.2 Requirements

data traffic between a UE attached to the network and an application in a
Service Hosting Environment for specific services, modifying the path as
needed when the UE moves during an active communication.
Based on operator policy, application needs, or both, the 5G system shall
support an efficient user plane path, modifying the path as needed when the UE
moves or application changes location, between a UE in an active communication
and:
\- an application in a Service Hosting Environment; or
> \- an application server located outside the operator's network; or
>
> \- an application server located in a customer premises network or personal
> IoT network.
The 5G network shall maintain user experience (e.g. QoS, QoE) when a UE in an
active communication moves from a location served by a Service Hosting
Environment to:
> \- another location served by a different Service Hosting Environment; or

> premises network or personal IoT network, and vice versa.

Environments. Therefore, it may be needed to instantiate an application at a
Service Hosting Environment nearby for serving a particular UE.
Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall provide a mechanism such that
one type of traffic (from a specific application or service) to/from a UE can
be offloaded close to the UE\'s point of attachment to the access network,
while not impacting other traffic type to/from that same UE.

## 6.6 Efficient content delivery
### 6.6.1 Description
Video-based services (e.g. live streaming, VR) and personal data storage
applications have been instrumental for the massive growth in mobile broadband
traffic. Subject to service agreement between the operator and the content
provider, the information of content and content itself can be aware by
operator. In-network content caching provided by the operator, a third-party
or both, can improve user experience, reduce backhaul resource usage and
utilize radio resource efficiently.
The operation of in-network caching includes flexible management of the
location of the content cache within the network and efficient delivery of
content to and from the appropriate content caching application. Examples of
services are the delivery of popular video content from a content caching
application via broadcast, and secure storage of a user\'s personal data or
files using a distributed caching application. Such a service could also
provide a student with a wireless backpack, where students can resume their
work through the same or a different UE at any time, with very fast response
times from the network.
### 6.6.2 Requirements
The 5G system shall enable efficient delivery of content from a content
caching application under the control of the operator (e.g. a cache located
close to the UE).
The 5G system shall support a content caching application in a UE under the
control of the operator.
The 5G system shall support configurations of content caching applications in
the network (e.g. access network, core network), that provide content close to
the UE.
Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall support an efficient mechanism
for selection of a content caching application (e.g. minimize utilization of
radio, backhaul resources and/or application resource) for delivery of the
cached content to the UE.
The 5G system shall support a mechanism for the operator to manage content
distribution across content caching applications.
The 5G system shall support delivery of cached content from a content caching

\- A 5G system with satellite access shall be able to optimise the delivery of
content from a content caching application by taking advantage of satellites
in supporting ubiquitous service, as well as broadcasting/multicasting on very
large to global coverages.
## 6.7 Priority, QoS, and policy control
### 6.7.1 Description
The 5G network will support many commercial services (e.g. medical) and
regional or national regulatory services (e.g. MPS, Emergency, Public Safety)
with requirements for priority treatment. Some of these services share common
QoS characteristics such as latency and packet loss rate but can have
different priority requirements. For example, UAV control and air traffic
control can have stringent latency and reliability requirements but not
necessarily the same priority requirements. In addition, voice-based services
for MPS and Emergency share common QoS characteristics as applicable for
normal public voice communications yet can have different priority
requirements. The 5G network will need to support mechanisms that enable the
decoupling of the priority of a particular communication from the associated
QoS characteristics such as latency and reliability to allow flexibility to
support different priority services (that need to be configurable to meet
operator needs, consistent with operator policies and corresponding national
and regional regulatory policies).
The network needs to support flexible means to make priority decisions based
on the state of the network (e.g. during disaster events and network
congestion) recognizing that the priority needs can change during a crisis.
The priority of any service can be different for a user of that service based
on operational needs and regional or national regulations. Therefore, the 5G
system should allow a flexible means to prioritise and enforce prioritisation
among the services (e.g. MPS, Emergency, medical, Public Safety) and among the
users of these services. The traffic prioritisation can be enforced by
adjusting resource utilization or pre-empting lower priority traffic.
The network must offer means to provide the required QoS (e.g. reliability,
latency, and bandwidth) for a service and the ability to prioritize resources
when necessary to meet the service requirements. Existing QoS and policy
frameworks handle latency and improve reliability by traffic engineering. In
order to support 5G service requirements, it is necessary for the 5G network
to offer QoS and policy control for reliable communication with latency
required for a service and enable the resource adaptations as necessary.
The network needs to allow multiple services to coexist, including multiple
priority services (e.g. Emergency, MPS and MCS) and must provide means to
prevent a single service from consuming or monopolizing all available network
resources, or impacting the QoS (e.g. availability) of other services
competing for resources on the same network under specific network conditions.
For example, it is necessary to prevent certain services (e.g. citizen-to-
authority Emergency) sessions from monopolizing all available resources during
events such as disaster, emergency, and DDoS attacks from impacting the
availability of other priority services such as MPS and MCS.
Also, as 5G network is expected to operate in a heterogeneous environment with
multiple access technologies, multiple types of UE, etc., it should support a
harmonised QoS and policy framework that applies to multiple accesses.
Further, for QoS control in EPS only covers RAN and core network, but for 5G
network E2E QoS (e.g. RAN, backhaul, core network, network to network
interconnect) is needed to achieve the 5G user experience (e.g. ultra-low
latency, ultra-high bandwidth).
### 6.7.2 Requirements

priority policies among the different services (e.g. MPS, Emergency, medical,
Public Safety) and users.

regulatory and operator policies.
The 5G system shall be able to provide the required QoS (e.g. reliability,

resources when necessary for that service.
The 5G system shall enable the network operator to define and statically
configure a maximum resource assignment for a specific service that can be
adjusted based on the network state (e.g. during congestion, disaster,
emergency and DDoS events) subject to regional or national regulatory and
operator policies.
The 5G system shall allow decoupling of the priority of a particular
communication from the associated QoS characteristics such as end-to-end
latency and reliability.
The 5G system shall be able to support a harmonised QoS and policy framework
applicable to multiple accesses.
The 5G system shall be able to support E2E (e.g. UE to UE) QoS for a service.

Hosting Environment.
A 5G system with multiple access technologies shall be able to select the

## 6.9 Connectivity models
### 6.9.1 Description
The UE (remote UE) can connect to the network directly (direct network
connection), connect using another UE as a relay UE (indirect network
connection), or connect using both direct and indirect connections. Relay UEs
can be used in many different scenarios and verticals (inHome, SmartFarming,
SmartFactories, Public Safety and others). In these cases, the use of relays
UEs can be used to improve the energy efficiency and coverage of the system.
Remote UEs can be anything from simple wearables, such as sensors embedded in
clothing, to a more sophisticated wearable UE monitoring biometrics. They can
also be non-wearable UEs that communicate in a Personal Area Network such as a
set of home appliances (e.g. smart thermostat and entry key), or the
electronic UEs in an office setting (e.g. smart printers), or a smart flower
pot that can be remotely activated to water the plant.
When a remote UE is attempting to establish an indirect network connection,
there might be several relay UEs that are available in proximity and
supporting selection procedures of an appropriate relay UE among the available
relay UEs is needed.
Indirect network connection covers the use of relay UEs for connecting a
remote UE to the 3GPP network. There can be one or more relay UE(s) (more than
one hop) between the network and the remote UE.

## 6.11 Context-aware network
### 6.11.1 Description
A variety of sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer,
barometer, proximity sensor, and GPS can be integrated in a UE. Also,
different applications running on the UE can have different communication
needs (e.g. different traffic time). In addition, a UE can support different
access technologies such as NR, E-UTRA, WLAN access technology, and fixed
broadband access technology. The information gathered by sensors, the utilized
access technologies, the application context, and the application traffic
characteristics can provide useful information to the applications installed
in the UE and can also help the 5G system utilize resources in an efficient
and optimized way.
### 6.11.2 Requirements

UE), application-level information (e.g. foreground applications, running
background application, and user settings).
The 5G system shall support mechanisms to collect system information for
network optimization within an operator configured time scale.
## 6.12 Self backhaul
### 6.12.1 Description
The increased density of access nodes needed to meet future performance
objectives poses considerable challenges in deployment and management (e.g.
backhaul availability, backhaul capacity and scalability). The use of wireless
backhaul for such access nodes helps to address some of the challenges.
Wireless self-backhauling in the radio access network can enable simpler
deployment and incremental rollout by reducing reliance on the availability of
wired backhaul at each access node location. Network planning and installation
efforts can be reduced by leveraging plug and play type features -- self-
configuration, self-organizing, and self-optimization.

The proliferation of video services, ad-hoc multicast/broadcast streams,
software delivery over wireless, group communications and broadcast/multicast
IoT applications have created a need for a flexible and dynamic allocation of
radio resources between unicast and multicast services within the network as
well as support for a stand-alone deployment of multicast/broadcast network.
Moreover, enabling such a service over a network for a wide range of inter-
site distances between the radio base stations will enable a more efficient
and effective delivery system for real-time and streaming multicast/broadcast
content over wide geographic areas as well as in specific geographic areas
spanning a limited number of base stations. A flexible multicast/broadcast
service will allow the 5G system to efficiently deliver such services.

(i.e. video resolutions) of broadcast/multicast content for the same user
service to the same UE taking into account e.g. UE capability, radio
characteristics, application information.
The 5G system shall support parallel transfer of multiple multicast/broadcast
user services to a UE.
The 5G system shall support a stand-alone multicast/broadcast network

video group communication, allowing at least 800 concurrently operating groups
per geographic area.
NOTE 4: In this context \"concurrently operating groups\" means that the
associated media streams are delivered concurrently.

resource-efficient manner in terms of service bit rate to UEs distributed over
a large geographical area.
The 5G system shall allow a UE to request a communication service to

The 5G system shall allow different QoS policy for each group the UE
communicates with.
## 6.14 Subscription aspects
### 6.14.1 Description
With the Internet of Things, it is expected that the diversity of IoT devices
(e.g. sensors, UAVs, smart flower pots) and the usage models will largely
vary. Moreover, when the IoT device is manufactured, the deployment location
and specific usage might not be known. Sometimes the IoT devices will be added
to existing subscriptions, other times they can be part of a new subscription
for the user. Sometimes the IoT devices can be leased. During their life cycle
these IoT devices go through different stages, involving the change in
ownership when the IoT device is deployed and possibly afterwards, the
activation of the IoT device by the preferred operator, a possible change of
operators, etc. These stages need to be managed securely and efficiently. A
method of dynamic subscription generation and management is needed in addition
to statically provisioned subscription. Once the subscription is established,
subscription management becomes necessary, for example, to modify the
subscription when the ownership of the IoT device changes, to update or
refresh credentials due to suspected leakage or theft of security keys or as a
preventive measure.
The Internet of Things will also support various connectivity models: The IoT
devices can connect with the network directly or connect with the network
using another IoT device as a relay UE, or they can be capable of using both
types of connections. The direct device connection between the IoT device and
the relay UE can be using 3GPP or non-3GPP RAT. The relay UE can access the
network also using 3GPP or non-3GPP access networks (e.g. WLAN, fixed
broadband access network). In order to identify and manage the IoT devices, a
subscription with the 5G network is needed, even if the access is done via
non-3GPP access.
### 6.14.2 Requirements
An IoT device which is able to access a 5G PLMN in direct network connection
mode using a 3GPP RAT shall have a 3GPP subscription.
The 5G system shall allow the operator to identify a UE as an IoT device based
on UE characteristics (e.g. identified by an equipment identifier or a range
of equipment identifiers) or subscription or the combination of both.
The 5G system shall be able to provide mechanisms to change the association
between a subscription and address/number of an IoT device (e.g. changing the
owner and subscription information associated with the IoT device) within the
same operator and in between different operators in an automated or manual
way.
The 5G system shall be able to support identification of subscriptions
independently of identification of IoT devices. Both identities shall be
secure.
An IoT device which is able to connect to a UE in direct device connection
mode shall have a 3GPP subscription, if the IoT device needs to be
identifiable by the core network (e.g. for IoT device management purposes or
to use indirect network connection mode).
Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall support a mechanism to provision
on-demand connectivity (e.g. IP connectivity for remote provisioning). This
on-demand mechanism should enable means for a user to request on-the-spot
network connectivity while providing operators with identification and
security tools for the provided connectivity.
The 5G system shall support a secure mechanism for a home operator to remotely
provision the 3GPP credentials of a uniquely identifiable and verifiably
secure IoT device.
The 5G system shall support a secure mechanism for the network operator of an
NPN to remotely provision the non-3GPP identities and credentials of a
uniquely identifiable and verifiably secure IoT device.
Based on MNO and NPN policy, the 5G system shall support a mechanism to enable
MNO to update the subscription of an authorized UE in order to allow the UE to
connect to a desired NPN. This on-demand mechanism should enable means for a
user to request on-the-spot network connectivity which is authorized by its
MNO.
Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall provide means for authorised 3rd
parties to request changes to UE subscription parameters for access to data
networks, e.g., static IP address and configuration parameters for data
network access.
## 6.15 Energy efficiency
### 6.15.1 Description
Energy efficiency is a critical issue in 5G. The potential to deploy systems
in areas without a reliable energy source requires new methods of managing
energy consumption not only in the UEs but throughout all components of the 5G
system.
Small form factor UEs also typically have a small battery and this not only
puts constrains on general power optimization but also on how the energy is
consumed. With smaller batteries it is more important to understand and follow
the limitations for the both the maximum peak and continuous current drain.
### 6.15.2 Requirements
The 5G access network shall support an energy saving mode with the following
characteristics:
\- the energy saving mode can be activated/deactivated either manually or
automatically;
\- service can be restricted to a group of users (e.g. public safety user,
emergency callers).
NOTE: When in energy saving mode the UE\'s and Access transmit power may be
reduced or turned off (deep sleep mode), end-to-end latency and jitter may be
increased with no impact on set of users or applications still allowed.
The 5G system shall support mechanisms to improve battery life for a UE over
what is possible in EPS.
The 5G system shall optimize the battery consumption of a relay UE via which a
UE is in indirect network connection mode.
The 5G system shall support UEs using small rechargeable and single coin cell
batteries (e.g. considering impact on maximum pulse and continuous current).
## 6.16 Markets requiring minimal service levels
### 6.16.1 Description
A key aspect of 5G system flexibility is the ability to support both the very
high-end markets as well as very low end markets. Some systems will be
deployed in areas where there are constraints on energy resources (e.g.
sporadic access to power) and lower end user expectations for availability,
reliability, and data rates. In such cases, the system needs additional
flexibility to adapt power consumption needs based on fluctuations in power
availability. The system should be efficient in order to provide essential
services in harsh environments (e.g. far remote rural areas, very large
territories) while taking into account the local constraints (adapting
resources consumptions to long distances, dealing with variable conditions and
possibly disconnections). Content delivery should be optimized in order to
reduce constraints on transport networks, on low-end UEs (e.g. small screen,
limited energy consumption), variable network conditions, and client profiles.
### 6.16.2 Requirements
In constrained circumstances (e.g. reduced power supply), the 5G system shall
be able to support a minimal user experience (e.g. user experienced data rate
of [100] kbit/s, E2E latency of 50 ms, lower availability of the network of
95%).
The 5G system shall support centralized automation and management of the
network in order to reduce local management tasks.
The 5G system shall support a mechanism to reduce data transfer rate at the
cell edge for very large coverage area (e.g. 100 kbit/s for more than 100 km
cell coverage, 1 Mbit/s for 100 km cell coverage).
The 5G system shall be able to give priority to services (e.g. e-Health) when
resources are limited.
## 6.17 Extreme long range coverage in low density areas
### 6.17.1 Description
A fully connected society is expected in the near future. The network access
everywhere over long distances (e.g. at remote rural areas or at sea)
including both humans and machines need to be supported.
### 6.17.2 Requirements
The 5G system shall support the extreme long-range coverage (up to 100 km) in
low density areas (up to 2 user/km^2^).
The 5G system shall support a minimum user throughput of 1 Mbit/s on DL and
100 kbit/s on UL at the edge of coverage.
The 5G system shall support a minimum cell throughput capacity of 10
Mbit/s/cell on DL (based on an assumption of 1 GB/month/sub).
The 5G system shall support a maximum of [400] ms E2E latency for voice
services at the edge of coverage.
## 6.18 Multi-network connectivity and service delivery across operators
### 6.18.1 Description
Given the multitude of use cases for new verticals and services, each
operator, based on its business model, can deploy a network serving only a
subset of the vertical industries and services. However, this should not
prevent an end-user from accessing all new services and capabilities that will
be accessible via 5G systems. To provide a better user experience for their
subscribers with UEs capable of simultaneous network access, network operators
could contemplate a variety of sharing business models and partnership with
other network and service providers to enable its subscribers to access all
services via multiple networks simultaneously, and with minimum interruption
when moving.
### 6.18.2 Requirements
The 5G system shall enable users to obtain services from more than one network
simultaneously on an on-demand basis.
For a user with a single operator subscription, the use of multiple serving
networks operated by different operators shall be under the control of the
home operator.
When a service is offered by multiple operators, the 5G system shall be able
to maintain service continuity with minimum service interruption when the
serving network is changed to a different serving network operated by a
different operator.
NOTE 1: A business agreement is required between the network operators.
In the event of the same service being offered by multiple operators, unless
directed by the home operator\'s network, the UE shall be prioritized to
receive subscribed services from the home operator\'s network.
NOTE 2: If the service is unavailable (e.g. due to lack of network coverage)
from the home operator\'s network, the UE may be able to receive the service
from another operator\'s network.
NOTE 3: QoS provided by the partner operator\'s network for the same service
will be based on the agreement between the two operators and could be
different than that provided by the home operator\'s network.
## 6.19 3GPP access network selection
### 6.19.1 Description
The 5G system will support the concept of \"network slices\" where different
NG-RANs potentially are connected to network slices of different SSTs. A 5G UE
can provide assistance information (e.g. SST) to enable the network to select
one or more network slices. A 5G system is foreseen to support one or more
SSTs, but possibly not all existing SSTs.
A 5G network operator controls and is responsible for what SSTs that should be
available to a specific UE and subscription combination, based on associated
subscription type, network operator policies, network capabilities and UE
capabilities. The network operator can populate the Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector list with associated access technology identifiers, stored in the 5G
UE, with the PLMN/RAT combinations enabling access to the SSTs that are
available to the 5G UE with associated subscription.
The UE uses the list of PLMN/RAT combinations for PLMN selection, if
available, typically during roaming situations. In non-roaming situations, the
UE and subscription combination typically matches the HPLMN/EHPLMN
capabilities and policies, from a SST perspective. That is, a 5G UE accessing
its HPLMN/EHPLMN should be able to access SSTs according to UE capabilities
and the related subscription.
Optionally, a 5G system supports, subject to operator policies, a User
Controlled PLMN Selector list that enables the 5G UE user to specify preferred
PLMNs with associated access technology identifier in priority order. The user
can obtain information about suitable PLMN/RAT combination that would support
services preferred by the user.
### 6.19.2 Requirements
The following set of requirements complement the requirements listed in 3GPP
TS 22.011 [3], clause 3.2.
The 5G system shall support selection among any available PLMN/RAT
combinations, identified through their respective PLMN identifier and Radio
Access Technology identifier, in a prioritised order. The priority order may,
subject to operator policies, be provisioned in an Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector lists with associated RAT identifiers, stored in the 5G UE.
The 5G system shall support, subject to operator policies, a User Controlled
PLMN Selector list stored in the 5G UE, allowing the UE user to specify
preferred PLMNs with associated RAT identifier in priority order.
## 6.20 eV2X aspects
### 6.20.1 Description
The 3GPP system is expected to support various enhanced V2X scenarios.
Vehicles Platooning enables the vehicles to dynamically form a group
travelling together. All the vehicles in the platoon receive periodic data
from the leading vehicle, in order to carry on platoon operations. This
information allows the distance between vehicles to become extremely small,
i.e. the gap distance translated to time can be very low (sub second).
Platooning applications can allow the vehicles following to be autonomously
driven.
Advanced Driving enables semi-automated or fully-automated driving. Longer
inter-vehicle distance is assumed. Each vehicle and/or RSU shares data
obtained from its local sensors with vehicles in proximity, thus allowing
vehicles to coordinate their trajectories or manoeuvres. In addition, each
vehicle shares its driving intention with vehicles in proximity. The benefits
of this use case group are safer traveling, collision avoidance, and improved
traffic efficiency.
Extended Sensors enables the exchange of raw or processed data gathered
through local sensors or live video data among vehicles, Road Site Units, UEs
of pedestrians and V2X application servers. The vehicles can enhance the
perception of their environment beyond what their own sensors can detect and
have a more holistic view of the local situation.
Remote Driving enables a remote driver or a V2X application to operate a
remote vehicle for those passengers who cannot drive themselves or a remote
vehicle located in dangerous environments. For a case where variation is
limited and routes are predictable, such as public transportation, driving
based on cloud computing can be used. In addition, access to cloud-based back-
end service platform can be considered for this use case group.
### 6.20.2 Requirements
The 3GPP system supports the transport of messages with different performance
requirements to support V2X scenarios. The associated requirements are
described in eV2X 3GPP TS 22.186 [9].
## 6.21 NG-RAN Sharing
### 6.21.1 Description
The increased density of access nodes needed to meet future performance
objectives poses considerable challenges in deployment and acquiring spectrum
and antenna locations. RAN sharing is seen as a technical solution to these
issues.
### 6.21.2 Requirements
Requirements related to NG-RAN sharing are described in 3GPP TS 22.101 [6],
clause 28.2.
A 5G satellite access network shall support NG-RAN sharing.
## 6.22 Unified access control
### 6.22.1 Description
Depending on operator\'s policies, deployment scenarios, subscriber profiles,
and available services, different criterion will be used in determining which
access attempt should be allowed or blocked when congestion occurs in the 5G
System. These different criteria for access control are associated with Access
Identities and Access Categories. The 5G system will provide a single unified
access control where operators control accesses based on these two.
In unified access control, each access attempt is categorized into one or more
of the Access Identities and one of the Access Categories. Based on the access
control information applicable for the corresponding Access Identity and
Access Category of the access attempt, the UE performs a test whether the
actual access attempt can be made or not.
The unified access control supports extensibility to allow inclusion of
additional standardized Access Identities and Access Categories and supports
flexibility to allow operators to define operator-defined Access Categories
using their own criterion (e.g. network slicing, application, and application
server).
NOTE: Clauses 4.1 through 4.4a of TS 22.011 are obsolete and replaced by
clause 6.22.2 of this specification. However, when a UE is configured for EAB
according to TS 22.011, the UE is also configured for delay tolerant service
for 5G system.
### 6.22.2 Requirements
#### 6.22.2.1 General
Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall be able to prevent UEs from
accessing the network using relevant barring parameters that vary depending on
Access Identity and Access Category. Access Identities are configured at the
UE as listed in Table 6.22.2.2-1. Access Categories are defined by the
combination of conditions related to UE and the type of access attempt as
listed in Table 6.22.2.3-1. One or more Access Identities and only one Access
Category are selected and tested for an access attempt.
The 5G network shall be able to broadcast barring control information (i.e. a
list of barring parameters associated with an Access Identity and an Access
Category) in one or more areas of the RAN.
The UE shall be able to determine whether or not a particular new access
attempt is allowed based on barring parameters that the UE receives from the
broadcast barring control information and the configuration in the UE.
In the case of multiple core networks sharing the same RAN, the RAN shall be
able to apply access control for the different core networks individually.
The unified access control framework shall be applicable both to UEs accessing
the 5G CN using E-UTRA and to UEs accessing the 5G CN using NR.
The unified access control framework shall be applicable to UEs in RRC Idle,
RRC Inactive, and RRC Connected at the time of initiating a new access attempt
(e.g. new session request).
NOTE 1: \"new session request\" in RRC Connected refers to events, e.g. new
MMTEL voice or video session, sending of SMS (SMS over IP, or SMS over NAS),
sending of IMS registration related signalling, new PDU session establishment,
existing PDU session modification, and service request to re-establish the
user plane for an existing PDU session.
The 5G system shall support means by which the operator can define operator-
defined Access Categories to be mutually exclusive.
NOTE 2: Examples of criterion of operator-defined Access Categories are
network slicing, application, and application server.
The unified access control framework shall be applicable to inbound roamers to
a PLMN.
The serving PLMN should be able to provide the definition of operator-defined
Access Categories to the UE.

## 6.23 QoS monitoring
### 6.23.1 Description
The QoS requirements specified for particular services such as URLLC services,
vertical automation communication services, and V2X, mandate QoS guarantees
from the network. However, the network cannot always guarantee the required
QoS of the service. An example reason for this shortcoming is that the latency
and/or packet error rate increase due to interference in a radio cell. In such
cases, it is critical that the application and/or application server is
notified in a timely manner. Hence, the 5G system should be able to support
QoS monitoring/assurance for URLLC services, V2X and vertical automation.
For more information on QoS assurance see Annex F.
Vertical automation systems are locally distributed and are typically served
by wired and wireless communication networks of different types and with
different characteristics. If the operation of the system or one of its sub-
processes does not work properly, there is a need for quickly finding and
eliminating the related error or fault in order to avoid significant operation
and thus financial losses. To that end, automation devices and applications
implement diagnosis and error-analysis algorithms, as well as predictive
maintenance features.
Due to their inherent challenges, wireless communication systems are usually
under suspicion in case an error occurs in a distributed automation
application. Therefore, diagnosis and fault analysis features for 5G systems
are required. The 5G system needs to provide sufficient monitoring information
as input for such diagnosis features.
QoS monitoring can be used for the following activities:
\- assessing and assuring the dependability of network operation;
\- assessing and assuring the dependability of the communication services;
\- excluding particular communication errors;
\- identifying communication errors;
\- analysing the location of an error including the geographic location of the
involved network component (UE; front-haul component; core node);
\- activation of application-related countermeasures.
This section provides requirements for both functionality and service
exposure. In addition, the service exposure requirements on QoS monitoring in
22.101 [6], clause 29.2 apply.
### 6.23.2 Requirements
The 5G system shall provide a mechanism for supporting real-time E2E QoS
monitoring within a system.
NOTE 1: The end points in E2E are the termination points of the communication
service within the boundary of the 5G system.
The 5G system shall support combined QoS monitoring for a group of UEs.
NOTE 1A: Combined monitoring stands for the monitoring of several UEs for
which the monitoring results are reported together. An example for combined
QoS monitoring is that the 5G networks monitors the service bit rates of all
connections associated with the group of UEs.
The 5G network shall provide an interface to an application for QoS monitoring
(e.g. to initiate QoS monitoring, request QoS parameters, events, logging
information).
The 5G system shall be able to provide real time QoS parameters and events
information to an authorized application/network entity.
NOTE 2: The QoS parameters to be monitored and reported can include latency
(e.g. UL/DL or round trip), jitter, and packet loss rate.
The 5G system shall be able to log the history of the communication events.
NOTE 3: The communication history may include timestamps of communication
events and position-related information. Examples of such information are the
positions of UEs and of radio base stations associated with communication
events. Communication events include instances when the required QoS is not
met.
The 5G system shall support different levels of granularity for QoS monitoring
(e.g. per flow or set of flows).
The 5G system shall be able to provide event notification upon detecting an
error that the negotiated QoS level cannot be met/guaranteed.
The 5G system shall be able to provide information that identifies the type
and the location of a communication error (e.g. cell ID).
The 5G system shall be able to provide notification of communication events to
authorized entities per pre-defined patterns.
NOTE 4: An example for a communication event is that the service bit rate
drops below a pre-defined threshold for QoS parameters. When such an event
occurs, the authorized entity is notified, and the event is logged.
The 5G system shall support event-based QoS monitoring.
NOTE 5: An example for a triggering event is a position change of the
pertinent UE. A position change can, for instance, be inferred from a 5G
position service that tracks the UE.
The 5G system shall be able to respond to a request from an authorized entity
to provide real-time QoS monitoring information within a specified time after
receiving the request (e.g., within 5 s).
NOTE 6: The response time can be specified by the user.
The 5G system shall support an update/refresh rate for real time QoS
monitoring with a specified value (e.g., at least one update per second).
The 5G system shall be able to provide statistical information of service
parameters and error types while a communication service is in operation.
NOTE 7: The time span for collection and evaluation of statistical values can
be specified by the user.
The 5G system shall provide information on the current availability of a
specific communication service in a particular area (e.g. cell ID) upon
request of an authorized entity.
The 5G system shall provide a means by which an MNO informs a third party of
network events (failure of network infrastructure affecting UEs in a
particular area, etc.).
Based on MNO policy, the 5G system shall provide a mechanism to automatically
report service degradations, communications loss, and sustained connection
loss in a specific geographic area (e.g., a cell sector, a cell or a group of
cells) to a third party.
NOTE 8: These reports use a standard format. The specific values, thresholds,
and conditions upon which alarms occur can include the measured values for
end-to-end latency, service bit rate, communication service availability, end-
to-end latency jitter, etc. for a UE, the UE's location, and the time(s)
during which the degradation occurred.
The 5G system shall provide a mechanism for an authorised third party to
report to an MNO service degradations, communication loss, and sustained
connection loss.
NOTE 9: These reports use a standard format. The specific values, thresholds,
and conditions upon which alarms occur can include the measured values for
end-to-end latency, service bit rate, communication service availability, end-
to-end latency jitter, etc. for a UE, the UE's location, and the time(s)
during which the degradation occurred.
NOTE 10: What the MNO does with such reports is out of scope of 3GPP.
## 6.24 Ethernet transport services
### 6.24.1 Description
This clause includes common, fundamental Ethernet transport requirements, and
any requirements necessary to support a 5G LAN-type service. The requirements
applicable to the 5G system for supporting cyber-physical applications using
Ethernet are described in 3GPP TS 22.104 [21].
### 6.24.2 Requirements
The 3GPP system shall be able to support an Ethernet transport service.
The 5G network shall support the routing of non-IP packet (e.g. Ethernet
frame) efficiently for private communication between UEs within a 5G LAN-type
service.
The 5G network shall be able to provide the required QoS (e.g. reliability,
latency, and bandwidth) for non-IP packet (e.g. Ethernet frame) for private
communication between UEs within a 5G LAN-type service.
The Ethernet transport service shall support routing based on information
extracted from Virtual LAN (VLAN) ID by the 3GPP system.
The Ethernet transport service shall support the transport of Ethernet frames
between UEs that Ethernet devices are connected to.
The Ethernet transport service shall support the transport of Ethernet frames
between a UE that an Ethernet device is connected to and an Ethernet network
in DN (Data Network).
NOTE: If more than one Ethernet devices need to be connected to a UE, they can
be connected using an Ethernet switch between the devices and the UE.
The Ethernet transport service shall support the transport of Ethernet
broadcast frames.
The Ethernet transport service shall support traffic filtering and
prioritization based on source and destination MAC addresses.
The Ethernet transport service shall support traffic filtering and
prioritization based on Ethertype (including multiple Ethertypes in double
tagging).
The Ethernet transport service shall support traffic filtering and
prioritization based on 802.1Q VLAN tags (including double tagging).
The Ethernet transport service shall support routing based on information
extracted by the 3GPP system from the Bridge Protocol Data Units created in
the Ethernet network based on a Spanning Tree Protocol (e.g. RSTP).
## 6.25 Non-public networks
### 6.25.1 Description
Non-public networks are intended for the sole use of a private entity such as
an enterprise, and can be deployed in a variety of configurations, utilising
both virtual and physical elements. Specifically, they can be deployed as
completely standalone networks, they can be hosted by a PLMN, or they can be
offered as a slice of a PLMN.
In any of these deployment options, it is expected that unauthorized UEs,
those that are not associated with the enterprise, will not attempt to access
the non-public network, which could result in resources being used to reject
that UE and thereby not be available for the UEs of the enterprise. It is also
expected that UEs of the enterprise will not attempt to access a network they
are not authorized to access. For example, some enterprise UEs can be
restricted to only access the non-public network of the enterprise, even if
PLMN coverage is available in the same geographic area. Other enterprise UEs
can access both a non-public network and a PLMN where specifically allowed.
In addition to the requirements in this section, all requirements and KPIs in
other sections of TS 22.261, that are not exclusively for PLMNs (i.e.
explicitly using the term PLMN) also apply to (i.e. are in scope of) non-
public networks, except the requirements in sections 5.1, 6.2.4 and 6.3.2.2.
However, hereby it is important to realize that requirements and features are
optional to be supported by a non-public network, since non-public network
deployments can include different subsets of 5G system requirements and
services described in the sections of TS 22.261. The deployment choices are
dependent on verticals needs and regulation.
### 6.25.2 Requirements
The 5G system shall support non-public networks.
The 5G system shall support non-public networks that provide coverage within a
specific geographic area.
The 5G system shall support both physical and virtual non-public networks.
The 5G system shall support standalone operation of a non-public network, i.e.
a non-public network may be able to operate without dependency on a PLMN.
Subject to an agreement between the operators and service providers, operator
policies and the regional or national regulatory requirements, the 5G system
shall support for non-public network subscribers:
\- access to subscribed PLMN services via the non-public network;
\- seamless service continuity for subscribed PLMN services between a non-
public network and a PLMN;
\- access to selected non-public network services via a PLMN;
\- seamless service continuity for non-public network services between a non-
public network and a PLMN.
Subject to an agreement between the operators and service providers, operator
policies and the regional or national regulatory requirements, the 5G system
shall enable a UE, with multiple subscriptions, to simultaneously access
multiple non-public networks and corresponding services, via those NPNs or via
a different network (PLMN or NPN).
Subject to regional or national regulatory requirements for emergency
services, 5G system shall be able to support IMS emergency services for non-
public networks.
A non-public network subscriber to access a PLMN service shall have a service
subscription using 3GPP identifiers and credentials provided or accepted by a
PLMN.
The 5G system shall support a mechanism for a UE to identify and select a non-
public network.
NOTE: Different network selection mechanisms may be used for physical vs
virtual non-public networks.
The 5G system shall support identifiers for a large number of non-public
networks to minimize collision likelihood between assigned identifiers.
The 5G system shall support a mechanism to prevent a UE with a subscription to
a non-public network from automatically selecting and attaching to a PLMN or
non-public network it is not authorized to select.
The 5G system shall support a mechanism to prevent a UE with a subscription to
a PLMN from automatically selecting and attaching to a non-public network it
is not authorized to select.
The 5G system shall support a mechanism for a PLMN to control whether a user
of a UE can manually select a non-public network hosted by this PLMN that the
UE is not authorized to select automatically.
The 5G system may broadcast a human readable network name that a UE may
display for manual selection of a non-public network.
The 5G system shall support a change of host of a non-public network from one
PLMN to another PLMN without changing the network selection information stored
in the UEs of the non-public network.

## 6.31 Minimization of Service Interruption
### 6.31.1 Description
A mobile network can fail to provide service in the event of a disaster (for
example a fire.) The requirements listed in this clause provide the 5GS with
the capability to mitigate interruption of service. UEs can obtain service in
the event of a disaster, if there are PLMN operators prepared to offer
service. The minimization of service interruption is constrained to a
particular time and place. To reduce the impact to the 5G System of supporting
Disaster Roaming, the potential congestion resulting from an influx or outflux
of Disaster Inbound Roamers is taken into account.
### 6.31.2 Requirements
#### 6.31.2.1 General
Subject to regulatory requirements or operator\'s policy, 3GPP system shall be
able to enable a UE of a given PLMN to obtain connectivity service (e.g. voice

Condition applies.
#### 6.31.2.2 Disaster Condition
The 3GPP system shall enable UEs to obtain information that a Disaster
Condition applies to a particular PLMN or PLMNs.
NOTE: If a UE has no coverage of its HPLMN, then obtains information that a
Disaster Condition applies to the UE\'s HPLMN, the UE can register with a PLMN
offering Disaster Roaming service.
The 3GPP system shall support means for a PLMN operator to be aware of the
area where Disaster Condition applies.
The 3GPP system shall be able to support provision of service to Disaster
Inbound Roamer only within the specific region where Disaster Condition
applies.

Inbound Roamer with information about the applied disaster condition.
## 6.32 UAV aspects
### 6.32.1 Description
The 3GPP system is expected to support various enhanced UAV scenarios,
especially for a wide range of applications and scenarios by using low
altitude UAVs in various commercial and government sectors.
### 6.32.2 Requirements
The 3GPP system supports service requirements and KPIs related to command and
control (C2), payload (e.g. camera) and the operation of radio access nodes
on-board of UAVs. The associated requirements are described in 3GPP TS 22.125
[26].
## 6.33 Video, imaging and audio for professional applications
### 6.33.1 Description
Audio-Visual (AV) production includes television and radio studios, live news-
gathering, sports events, music festivals, among others. Typically, numerous
wireless devices such as microphones, in-ear monitoring systems or cameras are
used in these scenarios. In the future, the wireless communication service for
such devices are expected to be provided by a 5G system. AV production
applications require a high degree of confidence, since they are related to
the capturing and transmission of data at the beginning of a production chain.
This differs drastically when compared to other multimedia services because
the communication errors will be propagated to the entire audience that is
consuming that content both live and on recorded media. Furthermore, the
transmitted data is often post-processed with filters which could actually
amplify defects that would be otherwise not noticed by humans. Therefore,
these applications call for uncompressed or slightly compressed data, and very
low probability of errors. These devices will also be used alongside existing
technologies which have a high level of performance and so any new
technologies will need to match or improve upon the existing workflows to
drive adoption of the technology.
The 3GPP system already plays an important role in the distribution of AV
media content and services. Release 14 contains substantial enhancements to
deliver TV services of various kinds, from linear TV programmes for mass
audiences to custom-tailored on-demand services for mobile consumption.
However, it is expected that also in the domain of AV content and service
production, 3GPP systems will become an important tool for a market sector
with steadily growing global revenues. There are several areas in which 3GPP
networks can help to produce AV content and services in an efficient and
flexible manner.
### 6.33.2 Requirements
The 5G system supports the communication services for video, imaging and audio
for professional applications. The associated requirements are described in
3GPP TS 22.263 [28].
## 6.34 Critical medical applications
### 6.34.1 Description
The 5G system is expected to meet the service requirements for critical
medical applications where critical medical applications denote medical
devices and applications involved in the delivery of care for patient's
survival. Additionally, as the medical industry undergoes a shift to value-
based healthcare, where companies and healthcare providers have to move to
business models based on providing clinical value with cost efficiency, the 5G
system can help to adopt new and more efficient care delivery models in order
to reduce administrative and supply costs.
On this matter, 5G technology can especially have an important impact by:
\- enabling superior monitoring capability means thus improving the
effectiveness of preventive care,
\- enabling shifting care location from hospitals to homes and other lower
cost facilities,
\- improving operating room planning, enabling streamlining equipment usage
and simplifying operating theater implementation,
\- Enhancing cooperation in critical situations between ambulance and hospital
staff.

diagnosis or tele-monitoring systems,
\- in 3GPP TS 22.261 clauses 6.10, 8.2 and 8.9 for the requirements on the
security of medical data that fulfil regulatory requirements.
## 6.35 Service Function Chaining
### 6.35.1 Introduction
In order to support enhancement of service function chaining for 5G networks
beyond the requirements for FMSS in TS 22.101, the network operator defines
service function chaining policies for service function chaining to steer the
traffic associated to the application and its users on per UE basis to
appropriate ordered service functions.
A service function chain for 5G networks contains service functions such as
firewall functions, NAT, antimalware, parental control, DDoS protection, TCP
proxies, load balancers, KPI monitoring, and video optimization, etc.
NOTE: these are non-exhaustive examples of service functions. Other service
functions can be provided by an operator.
### 6.35.2 General Requirements
The following requirements apply for supporting enhancement of service
function chaining for 5G networks:
\- The network operator shall be able to define and modify service function
chaining policies for steering traffic on per application per UE basis through
required service function chaining with ordered service functions to improve
the user's QoE.
\- Service functions chaining policies shall be able to distinguish between
upstream and downstream traffic.
\- The coexistence of traffic with and without service function chaining shall

> operator and for deployments where the Hosted Services are provided by a
> third party.
## 6.36 5G Timing Resiliency
### 6.36.1 Overview
5G systems rely on reference precision timing signals for network
synchronization in order to operate. These synchronization references are
generated by Primary reference Time Clocks that typically get the timing
reference from GNSS receivers and in order to meet the relevant
synchronization requirements also during failure conditions, the
synchronization network designs typically include means to address potential
degradation of the GNSS signal performance. Some deployment of 5G involve
applications that themselves can be sensitive to any degradation of the timing
signal. In such cases it is beneficial for the 5G system to be enhanced to act
as a backup for loss of their GNSS references. In some implementations, timing
resiliency enhancements to the 5G system can work in collaboration with
different types of time sources (e.g., atomic clock, time service delivered
over the fibre) to provide a robust time synchronization.
5G as a consumer of time synchronization benefits from timing resiliency which
enables the support of many critical services within the 5G network even
during the event of a loss or degradation of the primary GNSS reference
timing. Additionally, for time critical services (e.g. financial sector or
smart grid), the 5G system can operate in collaboration with or as backup to
other timing solutions. A base of clock synchronization requirements when 5G
is providing a time signal, if it is deployed in conjunction with an IEEE TSN
network or if it is providing support for IEEE 1588 related protocols, is
included in [21] clause 5.6.
The enhancements in this clause build on this to add timing resiliency to the
5G system enabling its use as a replacement or backup for other timing
sources.
### 6.36.2 General
The 5G system shall support enhanced timing resiliency in collaboration with
different types of time sources (e.g., GNSS, TBS/MBS [33] [34], Sync over
Fiber [34]) to provide a robust time synchronization.
The 5G system shall be able to maintain accurate time synchronization as
appropriate for the supported applications in the event of degradation or loss
of the primary timing reference (e.g., GNSS).
### 6.36.3 Monitoring and Reporting
The 5G system shall be able to support mechanisms to monitor for timing source
failure (e.g., GNSS).
The 5G system shall be able to detect when reference timing signals (e.g.,
from GNSS or other timing source) are no longer viable for network time
synchronization.
The 5G system shall support a mechanism to determine if there is degradation
of the 5G time synchronization.
The 5G system shall be able to support mechanisms to indicate to devices
(e.g., UEs, applications) that there is an alternate time source available for
use (e.g., 5G system internal holdover capability, atomic clock, Sync over
Fiber, TBS, GNSS), taking into account the holdover capability of the devices.
The 5G system shall be able to detect when a timing source fails or is
restored for network time synchronization.
The 5G system shall support mechanisms to monitor different time sources and
adopt the most appropriate.
The 5G system shall support a mechanism to report timing errors such as
divergence from UTC and time sync degradation to UEs and 3rd party
applications.

The 5G system shall support a mechanism for a 3rd party application to request
resilient timing with specific KPIs (e.g., accuracy, interval, coverage area).
## 6.37 Ranging based services
### 6.37.1 Description
Ranging-based services are the applications utilizing the distance between two
UEs and/or the direction of one UE from the other one. In 3D case, direction

direction measurement, others can require both distance and direction
measurement.
Ranging can be supported with or without 5G coverage and figure 6.37.1-1 is an
illustration of ranging between UEs that are in coverage, out of coverage, or
with partial coverage. Both licensed and unlicensed spectrum can be used for
ranging. If licensed spectrum is used, it shall be fully under operator

## 6.38 Personal IoT Networks and Customer Premises Networks
### 6.38.1 Description
Personal IoT Networks (PINs) and Customer Premises Networks (CPNs) provide
local connectivity between UEs and/or non-3GPP devices. The CPN via an eRG, or
PIN Elements via a PIN Element with Gateway Capability can provide access to
5G network services for the UEs and/or non-3GPP devices on the CPN or PIN.
CPNs and PINs have in common that in general they are owned, installed and/or
(at least partially) configured by a customer of a public network operator.
A Customer Premises Network (CPN) is a network located within a premises (e.g.
a residence, office or shop). Via an evolved Residential Gateway (eRG), the
CPN provides connectivity to the 5G network. The eRG can be connected to the
5G core network via wireline, wireless, or hybrid access. A Premises Radio
Access Station (PRAS) is a base station installed in a CPN. Through the PRAS,
UEs can get access to the CPN and/or 5G network services. The PRAS can be
configured to use licensed, unlicensed, or both frequency bands. Connectivity
between the eRG and the UE, non-3GPP Device, or PRAS can use any suitable
non-3GPP technology (e.g. Ethernet, optical, WLAN).
A Personal IoT Network (PIN) consists of PIN Elements that communicate using
PIN Direct Connection or direct network connection and is managed locally
(using a PIN Element with Management Capability). Examples of PINs include
networks of wearables and smart home / smart office equipment. Via a PIN
Element with Gateway Capability, PIN Elements have access to the 5G network
services and can communicate with PIN Elements that are not within range to
use PIN Direct Connection. A PIN includes at least one PIN Element with
Gateway Capability and at least one PIN Element with Management Capability.
A PIN Element with Management Capability is a PIN Element that provides a
means for an authorised administrator to configure and manage a PIN.
The requirements as described in 3GPP TS 22.101 [6] clause 26a can also apply
to Personal IoT Networks and Customer Premises Networks.

business customers and vertical markets. Nowadays 3GPP has introduced new
network capabilities and new types of devices (e.g. AR/VR/XR devices, robot,
etc.), which can bring promising improvements to IMS multimedia telephony
service. While more and more individual consumers enjoy multimedia telephony
services across the globe, multimedia telephony services become popular also
among business customers. There are several primary business functions that
organizations use multimedia telephony services for, including internal
communication, talking with prospects (sales call), contacting current
customers and clients, customer support, and contact centre (or call centre)
activities. While business customers consider the multimedia telephony
services offer attractive features to their business, they also experience
some practical issues that expect support from the 5G system.
### 6.39.2 General
The following set of requirements complement the requirements listed in 3GPP
TS 22.173 [37].
The IMS multimedia telephony service shall support AR media processing.
### 6.39.3 Service Exposure
Requirements in this clause are subject to regulatory requirements and
operator policy.
The 5G system shall provide means to allow a trusted third-party to update the
multimedia telephony service subscription and allocate a third-party specific
identity to an authorized user.
NOTE: The third party is authorized to change user identities for those
subscriptions authorized by the operator.
The following requirements apply to the originating side:
\- The 5G network shall provide a means for third parties (e.g. enterprises)
to be authorized to verify the use of calling identity information by its
authorized users.
\- The 5G network shall provide a means for authorized third parties to verify
that an authenticated user is authorized to include or reference the pre-
established calling identity information included in the call setup or
retrieved by the called party.
\- The 5G network shall provide a means to verify the authenticity of the pre-
established stored identity information that is referenced by the call setup
and retrieved by the called party.
The following requirements apply to the terminating side.
\- The 5G network shall provide a means for third parties (e.g. enterprises)
to be able to verify the caller's authorization to use the identity
information either in addition to or instead of verification performed by the
terminating PLMN.
\- The 5G network shall provide a means to verify the authenticity of any
stored identity information referenced by the call setup to be presented to
the called party.
## 6.40 AI/ML model transfer in 5GS
### 6.40.1 Description
Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) is being used in a range of
application domains across industry sectors. In mobile communications systems,
mobile devices (e.g. smartphones, automotive, robots) are increasingly
replacing conventional algorithms (e.g. speech recognition, image recognition,
video processing) with AI/ML models to enable applications. The 5G system can
at least support three types of AI/ML operations:
\- AI/ML operation splitting between AI/ML endpoints
> The AI/ML operation/model is split into multiple parts according to the
> current task and environment. The intention is to offload the computation-
> intensive, energy-intensive parts to network endpoints, whereas leave the
> privacy-sensitive and delay-sensitive parts at the end device. The device
> executes the operation/model up to a specific part/layer and then sends the
> intermediate data to the network endpoint. The network endpoint executes the
> remaining parts/layers and feeds the inference results back to the device.
>
> \- AI/ML model/data distribution and sharing over 5G system
>
> Multi-functional mobile terminals might need to switch the AI/ML model in
> response to task and environment variations. The condition of adaptive model
> selection is that the models to be selected are available for the mobile
> device. However, given the fact that the AI/ML models are becoming
> increasingly diverse, and with the limited storage resource in a UE, it can
> be determined to not pre-load all candidate AI/ML models on-board. Online
> model distribution (i.e. new model downloading) is needed, in which an AI/ML
> model can be distributed from a NW endpoint to the devices when they need it
> to adapt to the changed AI/ML tasks and environments. For this purpose, the
> model performance at the UE needs to be monitored constantly.
>
> \- Distributed/Federated Learning over 5G system
>
> The cloud server trains a global model by aggregating local models
> partially-trained by each end devices. Within each training iteration, a UE
> performs the training based on the model downloaded from the AI server using
> the local training data. Then the UE reports the interim training results to
> the cloud server via 5G UL channels. The server aggregates the interim
> training results from the UEs and updates the global model. The updated
> global model is then distributed back to the UEs and the UEs can perform the
> training for the next iteration.
### 6.40.2 Requirements
Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall be able to provide means to
allow an authorized third-party to monitor the resource utilisation of the
network service that is associated with the third-party.
NOTE 1: Resource utilization in the preceding requirement refers to
measurements relevant to the UE's performance such as the data throughput
provided to the UE.
Based on operator policy, the 5G system shall be able to provide an indication
about a planned change of bitrate, latency, or reliability for a QoS flow to
an authorized 3rd party so that the 3^rd^ party AI/ML application is able to
adjust the application layer behaviour if time allows. The indication shall
provide the anticipated time and location of the change, as well as the target
QoS parameters.
Based on operator policy, 5G system shall be able to provide means to predict
and expose predicted network condition changes (i.e. bitrate, latency,
reliability) per UE, to an authorized third party.
Subject to user consent, operator policy and regulatory constraints, the 5G
system shall be able to support a mechanism to expose monitoring and status
information _of an AI-ML session_ to a 3^rd^ party AI/ML application.
NOTE 2: Such mechanism is needed for AI/ML application to determine an in-time
transfer of AI/ML model.
5G system shall be able to provide event alerting to an authorized 3rd party,
together with a predicted time of the event (e.g., alerting about traffic
congestion or UE moving into/out of a different geographical area).
NOTE 3: A 3rd party AI/ML application may use the prediction information to
minimize disturbance in the transfer of learning data and AI/ML model data.
The 5G system shall be able to expose aggregated QoS parameter values for a
group of UEs to an authorized service provider.
The 5G system shall be able to support an authorised 3rd party to change
aggregated QoS parameter values associated with a group of UEs, e.g. UEs of a
FL group.
Subject to user consent, operator policy and regulatory requirements, the 5G
system shall be able to expose information (e.g. candidate UEs) to an
authorized 3^rd^ party to assist the 3^rd^ party to determine member(s) of a
group of UEs (e.g. UEs of a FL group).
## 6.41 Providing Access to Local Services
### 6.41.1 Description
Providing access to local services refers to the capability to provide access
to a hosting network and a set of services offered by the hosting network
provider, and 3^rd^ party service providers including other network operators
and 3rd party application providers. The services can be localized (i.e.
provided at specific/limited area) and can be bounded in time. The user can
become aware of the available access to local services, and the process to
gain and terminate access to the hosting network and local services. This
process should be efficient, and convenient from a user experience standpoint.
Providing access to local services creates new opportunities for users and
service providers. For example, access can be provided in areas where there is
no coverage provided by other networks (for example, on a fairground
established far from other infrastructure), or the access and local services
can be established as needed (on a short-term basis), without the need for
long term business relationships, permanently installed equipment, etc.
The type of local services and access for localized services via a hosting
network can be promoted and arranged through different channels. Principally
the service providers (e.g., brick and mortar businesses, entertainment
venues, construction contractors, first responder agencies, etc.) will provide
information and proper incentive or instructions to potential users so that
they will seek to access the local services via hosting networks.
### 6.41.2 Requirements
#### 6.41.2.1 General
In the requirements below, it is assumed that:
\- Both the home network and the hosting network can be a PLMN or NPN.
\- Only subscribers of a public network can roam into a PLMN. Examples of
interworking scenarios between network operators and application providers for
localized services are indicated in Annex H.
#### 6.41.2.2 Configuration of Localized Services in Hosting Network

location) and building temporary relationship among hosting network operator
and other service providers including network operators or 3^rd^ party
application providers.
The 5G system shall support means for the service provider to request the
hosting network via standard mechanisms to provide access to 3^rd^ party
services at a specific period of time and location. This period of time shall
be flexible, so that a change in service provision can be decided at any time
(e.g., to cancel or prolong local services in the locality of service
delivery) based on localized services agreements.
Based on localized services agreements, the 5G system shall provide suitable
means to allow the service provider to request and provision various localized
service requirements, including QoS, expected/maximum number of users, event
information for discovery, network slicing, required IP connectivity etc, and
routing policies for the application of the localized services via the hosting
network.

provider of the accepted service parameters and routing policies.
Subject to regulatory requirements and localized service agreements, the 5G
system shall allow a home network operator to automatically negotiate policies
with the hosting network for allowing the home network's subscribers to
connect at a specific occasion, e.g., time and location, for their home
network services.

network operator and home network operator, for UE with only home network
subscription and with authorization to access hosting networks the 5G system
shall support:
\- access to the hosting network and use home network services or selected
localized services via the hosting network,
\- seamless service continuity for home network services or selected localized
services when moving between two hosting networks or a host network and the
home network.
The 5G system shall support a mechanism to enable configuration of a network
that provides access to localized services such that the services can be
limited in terms of their spatial extent (in terms of a particular topology,
for example a single cell), as specified by a service provider of localized
services.
The 5G system shall support a mechanism to enable configuration of a network
that provides access to localized services such that the services can be
limited in terms of the resources or capacity available, to correspond to
requirements that apply only to the locality of service delivery, as specified
by a service provider of localized services.
The 5G system shall support means for a hosting network to provide a 3^rd^
party service provider with information for automatic discovery of the hosting
network by the UEs to allow access to specific 3^rd^ party services.
The 5G system shall support secure mechanisms to allow a home network to
coordinate with a hosting network for a subscriber to temporarily access the
hosting network (e.g., based on temporary credentials) at a given time (start
time and duration) and location.
#### 6.41.2.3 User Manual Selection of Localized Services via Hosting Network
The hosting network shall allow a UE to manually select temporary localized
services which are provided via local breakout at the hosting network.

home network, service restriction such as time and location) via the hosting
network or the UE's home network.
The 5G system shall enable a UE to use credentials provided by the hosting
network with or without coordination with the home network of the UE, to make
use of localized services via the hosting network with a certain time
(including starting time and the duration) and location validity.
The 5G system shall be able to allow the home network to steer its UE(s) to a
hosting network with the consideration of the location, times, coverage of the
hosting network and services offered by the home network and hosting network.
The 5G system shall provide support to enable secure means to authenticate and
authorize a user of a UE accessing a hosting network~~,~~ including cases in
which a UE has no subscription to the hosting network and still needs to get
authorized to use localized services via the hosting network.
NOTE: It can be assumed that a network provider deploying a hosting network
has access to respective identification information about the user, e.g.,
through a separate registration process outside the scope of 3GPP.
The 5G system shall be able to authenticate and authorize the UE of a user
authenticated to a hosting network to access the hosting network and its
localized services on request of a service provider.

provider and operator, the 5G system shall enable a UE to receive and use
configuration provided by a 3^rd^ party service provider to discover and
access a hosting network and localized services, including the considerations
of prior service agreement with a 3^rd^ party service provider and no prior
subscription to hosting network. If the UE is able to obtain services from two
networks simultaneously, it may additionally select the hosting network. If
the UE cannot maintain the connection to the home network while selecting the
hosting network, the selection shall only be done on request by the user,
i.e., using manual selection.
The 5G system shall support secure means for a UE to select and access
localized services which may be provided by a 3^rd^ party service provider via
a hosting network, independent of prior subscription to the hosting network or

The 5G system shall enable the home network to allow a UE to automatically
select a hosting network for accessing localized services when specified
conditions (e.g., predefined time, location) are fulfilled.
The 5G system shall be able to prevent a UE to re-access the hosting network
after the localized services were terminated if the authorization for the
localized services is no longer valid (e.g., can be based on certain
conditions such as time or location of the user).
The 5G system may support means for a UE which may or may not have prior
subscription to the hosting network to display human readable information on
how to gain access to the hosting network and available 3^rd^ party services.
The 5G system shall support a mechanism to allow a user to manually select a
specific local hosting network.
NOTE: Additional information can be presented to the user to facilitate the
manual network selection.
The 5G system shall be able to limit access of specific UEs to a configurable
area of a hosting network\'s coverage area.
The 5G system shall be able to maintain privacy of a user against the hosting
network while the UE does not make use of the hosting network, for example, to
prevent tracking of UEs by hosting networks.
The 5G system shall enable the home network to instruct a UE to select a
hosting network with certain conditions (e.g., predefined time, location)
based on the request from a service provider.
The 5G system shall enable the home network to allow a UE to select a hosting
network or change to another hosting network, without any additional user
intervention as long as the delivered services, both localized services and
home routed services, are unchanged.
#### 6.41.2.6 Hosting Network Localized Services and Home Operator Services
The 5G system shall enable the home network operator to indicate to the UE
what services are preferred to be used from the home network when the UE
connects to a hosting network and the requested services are available from
both the hosting and the home network.
Based on localized service agreements, the hosting network shall be able to
provide required connectivity and QoS for a UE simultaneously connected to the
hosting network for localized services and its home network for home network
services.

plane overload caused by a high number of UEs returning from a temporary local
access of a hosting network to their home network in a very short period of
time.
The 5G system shall provide mechanisms to minimize the impact on the UEs
communication e.g., to prevent user plane and control plane outages when
returning to a home network together with other high number of UEs in a very
short period of time, after terminating their temporary local access to a
hosting network.
#### 6.41.2.8 Charging
The 5G system shall be able to collect charging information for the use of
localized services at the hosting network and provide the charging records to
UEs' home operators based on localized service agreements and charging
policies provided by the service providers of localized services.
#### 6.41.2.9 Regulatory Services
A hosting network using the 5G system shall be able to support regulatory
services (e.g., PWS, LI, and emergency calls), based on regional/national
regulatory requirements.
#### 6.41.2.10 Multicast/Broadcast
The operator of a hosting network shall support a mechanism allowing different
service providers of localized services to disseminate their services and
content over broadcast/multicast transport. This mechanism should also provide
means to include diverse content in the same transmission, e.g., to include
advertisements with other content, or to include multiple content in the same
media delivered to the user.
A hosting network shall provide multicast and broadcast services in an energy
efficient manner to UEs receiving this service.
A hosting network shall support resource efficient content delivery through
multicast/broadcast.
A hosting network shall support a mechanism to provide low latency signalling
for efficient content delivery to many UEs.
Subject to home operator policy, a hosting network shall be able to prioritize
specific multicast and broadcast services for local access over home routed
access, even if the same service is available in both networks.
## 6.42 Mobile base station relays
### 6.42.1 Description
The requirements below refer to a "_mobile base station relay"_ , which is a
mobile base station acting as a relay between a UE and the 5G network, i.e.
providing a NR access link to UEs and connected wirelessly (using NR) through
a donor NG-RAN to the 5G Core. Such mobile base station relay is assumed to be
mounted on a moving vehicle and serve UEs that can be located inside or
outside the vehicle (or entering/leaving the vehicle).
NOTE: The radio link used between a mobile base station relay and served UEs,
as well as between mobile base station relay and donor RAN, is assumed to be
NR-Uu; in that regard, it should be clear that a mobile base station relay is
different than a UE relay (which uses instead a PC5-based link to provide
indirect connection to remote UEs).
Few main underlying assumptions are:
\- requirements cover single-hop relay scenarios as baseline (multi-hop is not
precluded);
\- legacy UEs are supported;
\- other stage-1 requirements (e.g. on wireless self-backhaul), as well as
existing stage-2/3 functionalities and architecture options (e.g. IAB) do not
assume or address full relay mobility (e.g. relays on board of moving
vehicles), thus cannot cover the requirements below, which are intended to be
specific to mobile base station relays;
> \- the identified requirements do not intend to imply or exclude specific
> network/relay architectures and topology solutions (e.g. could be IAB based,
> or others);
\- the MNO managing mobile base station relays, and the RAN/5GC they connect
to, can be a PLMN or an NPN operator.
### 6.42.2 Requirements

mechanisms to control UEs' selection and access to a mobile base station
relay, e.g. based on UE's authorization, geographic or temporary restrictions,
relay's load.
The 5G system shall be able to support RAN sharing between multiple PLMNs for

shall support means to configure and expose monitoring information of a mobile
base station relay to an MNO's authorized third-party.
The 5G system shall be able to provide means to optimize network behaviour to
efficiently deliver data based on the mobility information (e.g., itinerary),
known or predicted, of mobile base station relays.
The 5G system shall be able to support communication from/to users of one MNO
(MNO-A) via mobile base station relays, where the traffic between the relay
and the MNO-A network is transported using 5G connectivity (RAN and 5GC)
provided by a different MNO (MNO-B).
NOTE 3: The 5G connectivity provided to the MNO-A relays by the different MNO
(MNO-B) assumes a generic wireless backhaul transport, independent from the
mobile base station relay functionalities.
The 5G system shall be able to support UEs connectivity to RAN using
simultaneously, a link without mobile base station relay and a link via a
mobile base station relay, or simultaneous links via different mobile base
station relays.
NOTE 4: The above requirements cover scenarios were the two links (to the RAN)
could be connected to the same or different RAN node(s), and assuming both
relay(s) and RAN belong to the same PLMN.
The 5G system shall be able to provide means to support efficient UE cell
selection and cell reselection (between mobile base station relays or between
relays and RAN) in the presence of mobile base station relays.
The 5G system shall be able to ensure end-to-end service continuity, in the
presence of mobile base station relays.
NOTE 5: The above requirement intends to cover different scenarios of UE
mobility (e.g. UE moving between two mobile base station relays, or between
macro RAN and relay) and relay mobility (e.g. base station relay moving
between different donor RAN nodes).
The 5G system shall be able to support mechanisms to optimize mobility and
energy efficiency for UEs located in a vehicle equipped with a base station
relay.
NOTE 6: The above requirements cover scenarios where mobile base station
relays provide 5G access for both UEs in the vehicle and around the vehicle.
The 5G system shall be able to support incremental deployment of connectivity
by means of one or a series of mobile base station relays for use only in
specific locations where UEs would receive no other 3GPP access (terrestrial
or non-terrestrial) coverage, e.g., for public safety scenarios.
The 5G system shall be able to support mobile base station relays using 3GPP
satellite NG-RAN (NR satellite access).
The 5G system shall be able to support mobile base station relays accessing to
5GC via NR satellite access and NR terrestrial access simultaneously.
The 5G system shall be able to support service continuity for mobile base
station relays using at least one 3GPP satellite NG-RAN.

between two 3GPP NG-RAN, operated by the same MNO, involving at least one 3GPP
satellite NG-RAN.
The 5G system shall be able to identify and differentiate UEs' traffic carried
via a mobile base station relay and collect charging information, including
specific relay information (e.g. geographic location served by the relay).
The 5G system shall support means for a mobile base station relay to have a
certain subscription with a HPLMN, used to get access and connectivity to the
HPLMN network (via a donor RAN).
The 5G system shall support the ability of a base station relay to roam from
its HPLMN into a VPLMN.
The 5G system shall support mechanisms, for the HPLMN controlling a mobile
base station relay, to enable/disable mobile relay operation if the relay is
roaming in a VPLMN.
The 5G system shall support mechanisms to disable mobile relay operation by a
VPLMN where a mobile base station relay is roaming to.
The 5G system shall be able to fulfil necessary regulatory requirements (e.g.
for support of emergency services) when UEs access the 3GPP network via a
mobile base station relay.
The 5G system shall be able to support priority services (e.g. MPS) when UEs
access the 3GPP network via a mobile base station relay.
The 5G system shall be able to support location services for the UEs accessing
5GS via a mobile base station relay.

and 3GPP network is unaffected when the UE accesses the 3GPP network via a
mobile base station relay.
The 5G system shall be able to minimize radio interference possibly caused by
mobile base station relays.
The 5G system shall minimize the impact of the presence of mobile base station
relays on radio network management (e.g. through automatic neighbour cell list
configuration).
## 6.43 Tactile and multi-modal communication service
### 6.43.1 Description
The tactile and multi-modal communication service can be applied in multiple
fields, e.g. industry, robotics and telepresence, virtual reality, augmented
reality, healthcare, road traffic, serious gaming, education, culture and
smart grid [38]. These services support applications enabling input from more
than one sources and/or output to more than one destinations to convey
information more effectively. As figure 6.43.1-1 illustrates, the input and
output can be different modalities including:
  * Video/Audio media;
  * Information received by sensors about the environment, e.g. > brightness, temperature, humidity, etc.;
  * Haptic data: can be feelings when touching a surface (e.g., > pressure, texture, vibration, temperature), or kinaesthetic senses > (e.g. gravity, pull forces, sense of position awareness).

**Figure 6.43.1-1. Multi-modal interactive system**
For immersive multi-modal VR applications, synchronization between different
media components is critical in order to avoid having a negative impact on the
user experience (i.e. viewers detecting lack of synchronization), particularly
when the synchronization threshold between two or more modalities is less than
the latency KPI for the application. Example synchronization thresholds [41]
[42] [43] [44] are summarised in table 6.43.1-1.
**Table 6.43.1-1: Typical** **synchronization thresholds for immersive multi-
modality VR applications**

### 6.43.2 Requirements
The 5G system shall enable an authorized 3rd party to provide policy(ies) for
flows associated with an application. The policy may contain e.g. the set of
UEs and data flows, the expected QoS handling and associated triggering
events, other coordination information.
The 5G system shall support a means to apply 3rd party provided policy(ies)
for flows associated with an application. The policy may contain e.g. the set
of UEs and data flows, the expected QoS handling and associated triggering
events, other coordination information.
NOTE: The policy can be used by a 3rd party application for coordination of
the transmission of multiple UEs' flows (e.g., haptic, audio and video) of a
multi-modal communication session.
## 6.44 Support of Roaming services providers
### 6.44.1 Overview
In the roaming ecosystem, a roaming services provider provides the technical
and commercial means to facilitate the deployment and operation of roaming
services between a client operator and a set of selected connected operators.
The roaming services provider handles the technical implementation of the
roaming relations in a scalable and operationally efficient way.
With a roaming services provider present in the roaming ecosystem, operators
can choose not to establish a bilateral direct agreement with specific
operators. A trusted relation exists between the involved operator and the
roaming services provider.
Roaming services providers, according to their role and responsibilities,
assume financial and technical liability to apply all necessary controls and
access to all communications.
Among other functionalities, a roaming services provider needs to:
â€¢ Process identifiers and potentially other information transmitted in
signalling messages between PLMNs in a secure manner.
â€¢ Be able to modify, add or delete information that is relevant to their role,
respecting what is contractually agreed in service level agreements (SLAs) and
enforced technically.
â€¢ Isolate the individual operator signalling flows from each other
â€¢ Report on the detection of and mitigation of security breaches.
### 6.44.2 Requirements
The 5G system shall allow roaming services to be provided by a roaming
services provider in charge of managing roaming agreements, by mediating
between two or more PLMNs, while maintaining the privacy and 5G security of
any information transmitted between the home and the serving PLMN.
NOTE 1: A PLMN can support both bi-lateral direct relationships with other
PLMNs and make use of roaming service provider services toward different
roaming partners.
The 5G system shall allow a roaming services provider to be a trusted entity
for either a home PLMN, a visited PLMN or both.
NOTE 2: The expected maximum number of roaming service providers is two, one
for the home PLMN and another for the visited PLMN.
The 5G system shall allow a roaming services provider to accept or reject
registration attempts, on behalf of the involved PLMNs, based on the roaming
agreements.
NOTE 3: Rejecting user registrations using an appropriate release cause
permits the UE to be able to reselect another roaming partner or technology.
The 5G system shall allow a roaming services provider to identify the origin
and destination PLMN, and to verify the authenticity, of every transmitted
message.
The 5G system shall allow the Roaming services provider to be able to
originate and modify messages as per contractually agreed SLAs.
The 5G system shall allow the involved PLMNs to be able to identify the origin
of any message generated by the roaming services providers as well as to
identify any modification made to the exchanged messages by the roaming
services providers.
# 7 Performance requirements
## 7.1 High data rates and traffic densities
Several scenarios require the support of very high data rates or traffic
densities of the 5G system. The scenarios address different service areas:
urban and rural areas, office and home, and special deployments (e.g. massive
gatherings, broadcast, residential, and high-speed vehicles). The scenarios
and their performance requirements can be found in table 7.1-1.
\- Urban macro -- The general wide-area scenario in urban area
\- Rural macro -- The general wide-area scenario in rural area
\- Indoor hotspot -- The scenario for offices and homes, and residential
deployments.
\- Broadband access in a crowd -- The scenario for very dense crowds, for
example, at stadiums or concerts. In addition to a very high connection
density the users want to share what they see and hear, putting a higher
requirement on the uplink than the downlink.
\- Dense urban -- The scenario for pedestrian users, and users in urban
vehicles, for example, in offices, city centres, shopping centres, and
residential areas. The users in vehicles can be connected either directly or
via an onboard base station to the network.
\- Broadcast-like services -- The scenario for stationary users, pedestrian
users, and users in vehicles, for example, in offices, city centres, shopping
centres, residential areas, rural areas and in high speed trains. The
passengers in vehicles can be connected either directly or via an onboard base
station to the network.
\- High-speed train -- The scenario for users in trains. The users can be
connected either directly or via an onboard base station to the network.
\- High-speed vehicle -- The scenario for users in road vehicles. The users
can be connected either directly or via an onboard base station to the
network.
\- Airplanes connectivity -- The scenario for users in airplanes. The users
can be connected either directly or via an onboard base station to the
network.

scenarios.
| Scenario | Experienced data rate (DL) | Experienced data rate (UL) | Area traffic capacity (DL) | Area traffic capacity (UL) | Overall user density | Activity factor | UE speed | Coverage  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1 | Urban macro | 50 Mbit/s | 25 Mbit/s | 100 Gbit/s/km2 (note 4) | 50 Gbit/s/km2 (note 4) | 10 000/km2 | 20 % | Pedestrians and users in vehicles (up to 120 km/h | Full network (note 1)

4 | Broadband access in a crowd | 25 Mbit/s | 50 Mbit/s | [3,75] Tbit/s/km2 | [7,5] Tbit/s/km2 | [500 000]/km2 | 30 % | Pedestrians | Confined area  
5 | Dense urban | 300 Mbit/s | 50 Mbit/s | 750 Gbit/s/km2 (note 4) | 125 Gbit/s/km2 (note 4) | 25 000/km2 | 10 % | Pedestrians and users in vehicles (up to 60 km/h) | Downtown (note 1)  
6 | Broadcast-like services | Maximum 200 Mbit/s (per TV channel) | N/A or modest (e.g. 500 kbit/s per user) | N/A | N/A | [15] TV channels of [20 Mbit/s] on one carrier | N/A | Stationary users, pedestrians and users in vehicles (up to 500 km/h) | Full network (note 1)  
7 | High-speed train | 50 Mbit/s | 25 Mbit/s | 15 Gbit/s/train | 7,5 Gbit/s/train | 1 000/train | 30 % | Users in trains (up to 500 km/h) | Along railways (note 1)

NOTE 1: For users in vehicles, the UE can be connected to the network directly, or via an on-board moving base station. NOTE 2: A certain traffic mix is assumed; only some users use services that require the highest data rates [2]. NOTE 3: For interactive audio and video services, for example, virtual meetings, the required two-way end-to-end latency (UL and DL) is 2â€‘4 ms while the corresponding experienced data rate needs to be up to 8K 3D video [300 Mbit/s] in uplink and downlink. NOTE 4: These values are derived based on overall user density. Detailed information can be found in [10]. NOTE 5: All the values in this table are targeted values and not strict requirements. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
## 7.2 Low latency and high reliability
### 7.2.1 Overview
Several scenarios require the support of very low latency and very high
communications service availability. Note that this implies a very high
reliability. The overall service latency depends on the delay on the radio
interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to a server which
can be outside the 5G system, and data processing. Some of these factors
depend directly on the 5G system itself, whereas for others the impact can be
reduced by suitable interconnections between the 5G system and services or
servers outside of the 5G system, for example, to allow local hosting of the
services.
### 7.2.2 Scenarios and KPIs
Different deployments of URLLC capabilities will depend on the 3GPP system
being able to meet specific sets of KPIs with different values and ranges
applicable for each attribute. A common, yet flexible, 5G approach to URLLC
will enable the 5G system to meet the specific sets of KPIs needed in a given
implementation. To provide clear and precise requirements for specific types
of services, the corresponding KPI requirements are included in other
specifications as follows:
> \- Cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains can be found in
> 22.104 [21].
>
> \- V2X can be found in 22.186 [9].
>
> \- Rail communications can be found in 22.289 [23].
Some scenarios requiring very low latency and very high communication service
availability are described below:
\- Motion control -- Conventional motion control is characterised by high
requirements on the communications system regarding latency, reliability, and
availability. Systems supporting motion control are usually deployed in
geographically limited areas but can also be deployed in wider areas (e.g.
city- or country-wide networks), access to them can be limited to authorized
users, and they can be isolated from networks or network resources used by
other cellular customers.
\- Discrete automation -- Discrete automation is characterised by high
requirements on the communications system regarding reliability and
availability. Systems supporting discrete automation are usually deployed in
geographically limited areas, access to them can be limited to authorized
users, and they can be isolated from networks or network resources used by
other cellular customers.
\- Process automation -- Automation for (reactive) flows, e.g. refineries and
water distribution networks. Process automation is characterized by high
requirements on the communications system regarding communication service
availability. Systems supporting process automation are usually deployed in
geographically limited areas, access to them is usually limited to authorized
users, and it will usually be served by non-public networks.
\- Automation for electricity distribution and smart grid (mainly medium and
high voltage). Electricity distribution and smart grid are is characterized by
high requirements on the communications service availability and security, as
well as low latency in some cases. In contrast to the above use cases,
electricity distribution and smart grid are deeply immersed into the public
space. Since electricity distribution is an essential infrastructure, it is
well served by network slices to provide service isolation and security, or by
non-public networks.
\- Wireless road-side infrastructure backhaul in intelligent transport systems
-- Automation solutions for the infrastructure supporting street-based
traffic. This use case addresses the connection of the road-side
infrastructure, e.g. roadside units, with other infrastructure, e.g. a traffic
guidance system. As is the case for automation electricity, the nodes are
deeply immersed into the public space.
\- Remote control -- Remote control is characterised by a UE being operated
remotely by a human or a computer. For example, Remote Driving enables a
remote driver or a V2X application to operate a remote vehicle with no driver
or a remote vehicle located in a dangerous environment.
\- Rail communications (e.g. railway, rail-bound mass transit) have been using
3GPP based mobile communication (e.g. GSM-R) already for some time, while
there is still a driver on-board of the train. The next step of the evolution
will be providing fully automated train operation that requires highly
reliable communication with moderate latencies but at very high speeds of up
to 500 km/h.
For specific requirements, refer to the specifications noted above [21], [9],
[23].
### 7.2.3 Other requirements
#### 7.2.3.1 (void)
#### 7.2.3.2 Wireless road-side infrastructure backhaul
Intelligent Transport Systems embrace a wide variety of communications-related
applications that are intended to increase travel safety, minimize
environmental impact, improve traffic management, and maximize the benefits of
transportation to both commercial users and the general public.
Road-side infrastructure such as traffic light controllers, roadside units,
traffic monitoring in urban areas and along highways and streets is wirelessly
connected to traffic control centres for management and control purposes. The
backhaul communication between the road-side infrastructure and the traffic
control centre requires low-latency, high communication service availability,
and high-capacity connections for reliable distribution of data. Road-side
infrastructure is deployed alongside streets in urban areas and alongside
major roads and highways every 1-2 km.
For more information about infrastructure backhaul, see clause D.5.
To support wireless road-side infrastructure backhaul the 5G system shall
support the performance requirements in table 7.2.3.2-1.
Table 7.2.3.2-1 Performance requirements for wireless ITS infrastructure
backhaul scenario
Scenario | Max. allowed end-to-end latency (note 1) | Survival time | Communication service availability (note 2) | Reliability (note 2) | User experienced data rate | Payload size (note 3) | Traffic density  
(note 4) | Connection density  
(note 5) | Service area dimension  
(note 6)  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
wireless road-side infrastructure backhaul | 30 ms | 100 ms | 99,9999% | 99,999% | 10 Mbit/s | Small to big | 10 Gbit/s/km2 | 1 000/km2 | 2 km along a road  
NOTE 1: This is the maximum end-to-end latency allowed for the 5G system to deliver the service in the case the end-to-end latency is completely allocated to the 5G system from the UE to the Interface to Data Network. NOTE 2: Communication service availability relates to the service interfaces, and reliability relates to a given system entity. One or more retransmissions of network layer packets can take place in order to satisfy the reliability requirement. NOTE 3: Small: payload typically â‰¤ 256 bytes NOTE 4: Based on the assumption that all connected applications within the service volume require the user experienced data rate. NOTE 5: Under the assumption of 100% 5G penetration. NOTE 6: Estimates of maximum dimensions; the last figure is the vertical dimension. NOTE 7: All the values in this table are example values and not strict requirements. Deployment configurations should be taken into account when considering service offerings that meet the targets. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
## 7.3 High-accuracy positioning
### 7.3.1 Description
Adaptability and flexibility are among the key features of the 5G system to
serve a wide diversity of verticals and services, in different environments
(e.g. rural, urban, indoor). This applies to high-accuracy positioning and
translates into the ability to satisfy different levels of services and
requirements, for instance on performance (e.g. accuracy, positioning service
availability, positioning service latency) and on functionality (e.g.
security).
### 7.3.2 Requirements
#### 7.3.2.1 General
The 5G System shall provide different 5G positioning services with
configurable performances working points (e.g. accuracy, positioning service
availability, positioning service latency, energy consumption, update rate,
TTFF) according to the needs of users, operators and third parties.
The 5G system shall support the combination of 3GPP and non-3GPP positioning
technologies to achieve performances of the 5G positioning services better
than those achieved using only 3GPP positioning technologies.
NOTE 1: For instance, the combination of 3GPP positioning technologies with
non-3GPP positioning technologies such as GNSS (e.g. Beidou, Galileo, GLONASS,
and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), sensors (e.g. barometer, IMU),
WLAN/Bluetooth-based positioning, can support the improvement of accuracy,
positioning service availability, reliability and/or confidence level, the
reduction of positioning service latency, the increase of the update rate of
the position-related data, increase the coverage (service area).
NOTE 2: The combination can vary over time to optimise the performances, and
can be the combination of multiple positioning technologies at the same epoch
and/or the combination of multiple positioning technologies at different
epochs.
The corresponding positioning information shall be acquired in a timely
fashion, be reliable, and be available (e.g. it is possible to determine the
position).
UEs shall be able to share positioning information between each other e.g. to
a controller if the location information cannot be processed or used locally.
#### 7.3.2.2 Requirements for horizontal and vertical positioning service
levels
The 5G system shall be able to provide positioning services with the
performances requirements reported in Table 7.3.2.2-1.
NOTE: The requirements do not preclude any type of UE, including specific UE
such as for example V2X, MTC.

#### 7.3.2.3 Other performance requirements
The 5G system shall be able to provide the 5G positioning services with a TTFF
less than 30 s and, for some 5G positioning services, shall support mechanisms
to provide a TTFF less than 10 s.
NOTE 1: In some services, a TTFF of less than 10s can only be achievable at
the expense of a relaxation of some other performances (e.g. horizontal
accuracy can be 1 m or 3 m after 10 s TTFF, and reach a steady state accuracy

communication such as those, typically (but not restricted to) related to
medical monitoring. They involve different deployment areas, different device

#### D.4.1.2 Security
Due to its central role in virtually every country on earth, electricity
distribution is heavily regulated. Security assessments for, e.g. deployments
in North America, need to adhere to the NERC CIP suite [14]. Technical
implementations are described in standard suites such as IEC 62351.
### D.4.2 High voltage
#### D.4.2.0 Overview
In order to avoid region- or even nation-wide power outages, wide-area power
system protection is on the rise. \"When a major power system disturbance
occurs, protection and control actions are required to stop the power system
degradation, restore the system to a normal state, and minimize the impact of
the disturbance. The present control actions are not designed for a fast-
developing disturbance and can be too slow. Local protection systems are not
able to consider the overall system, which can be affected by the disturbance.
Wide area disturbance protection is a concept of using system-wide information
and sending selected local information to a remote location to counteract
propagation of the major disturbances in the power system.\" [15]. Protection
actions include, \"among others, changes in demand (e.g. load shedding),
changes in generation or system configuration to maintain system stability or
integrity and specific actions to maintain or restore acceptable voltage
levels.\" [16]. One specific application is phasor measurement for the
stabilisation of the alternating-current phase in a transport network. For
this, the voltage phase is measured locally and sent to a remote-control
centre. There, this information is processed, and automated actions are
triggered. One action can be the submission of telegrams to power plants,
instructing them to either accelerate or deaccelerate their power generators
in order to keep the voltage phase in the transport network stable. A
comprehensive overview of this topic can be found elsewhere in the literature
[17].
This kind of automation requires very low end-to-end latencies (5 ms) [16]
andâ€•due to its critical importance for the operation of societyâ€•a very high
communication service availability (99,9999%).
#### D.4.2.1 Service area and connection density
As is the case for medium-voltage distribution networks (see Annex D.4.1),
connectivity in high-voltage automation has to be provided mainly along the
power line. The distances to be covered can be substantial (hundreds of
kilometres in rural settings), while shorter links are prevalent in
metropolitan areas. The number of connections in wide-area power system
protection is rather low; butâ€•due to the sliver-shaped service areaâ€•the
connection density can be rather high (1000 km^-2^).
#### D.4.2.2 Security
Due to its central role in virtually every country on earth, electricity
distribution is heavily regulated. Security assessments for, e.g. deployments
in North America, need to adhere to the NERC CIP suite [14]. Technical
implementations are described in standard suites such as IEC 62351.
## D.5 Intelligent transport systems -- infrastructure backhaul
### D.5.0 General
Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) embrace a wide variety of communications-
related applications that are intended to increase travel safety, minimize
environmental impact, improve traffic management, and maximize the benefits of
transportation to both commercial users and the general public. Over recent
years, the emphasis in intelligent vehicle research has turned to co-operative
systems, in which the traffic participants (vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians,
etc.) communicate with each other and/or with the infrastructure.
Cooperative ITS is the term used to describe technology that allows vehicles
to become connected to each other, and to the infrastructure and other parts
of the transport network. In addition to what drivers can immediately see
around them, and what vehicle sensors can detect, all parts of the transport
system will increasingly be able to share information to improve decision
making. Thus, this technology can improve road safety through avoiding
collisions, but also assist in reducing congestion and improving traffic
flows, and reduce environmental impacts. Once the basic technology is in place
as a platform, an array of applications can be developed.
Cooperative ITS can greatly increase the quality and reliability of
information available about vehicles, their location and the road environment.
In the future, cars will know the location of road works and the switching
phases of traffic lights ahead, and they will be able to react accordingly.
This will make for safer and more convenient travel and faster arrival at the
destination. On-board driver assistance, coupled with two-way communication
between vehicles and between vehicles and road infrastructure, can help
drivers to better control their vehicle and hence have positive effects in
terms of safety and traffic efficiency. An important role in this plays the
so-called road side units (RSUs). Vehicles can also function as sensors
reporting weather and road conditions including incidents. In this way, cars
can be used as information sources for high-quality information services.
RSUs are connected to the traffic control centre for management and control
purposes. They broadcast, e.g., traffic light information (RSU ïƒ  vehicle) and
traffic information from the traffic-control centre (TCC) via the RSU to the
vehicles (TCC ïƒ  RSU ïƒ  vehicle). RSUs also collect vehicle probe data for the
traffic control centre (vehicle ïƒ  RSU ïƒ  TCC). For reliable distribution of
data, low-latency and high-capacity connections between RSUs (e.g. traffic
lights, traffic signs, etc.) and the TCC are required. This type of
application comes with rather tight end-to-end latency requirements for the
communication service between RSU and TCC (10 ms), since relayed data needs to
be processed in the TCC and, if needed, the results are forwarded to
neighbouring RSUs. Also, the availability of the communication service has to
be very high (99,9999%) in order to compete with existing wired technology and
in order to justify the costly deployment and maintenance of RSUs.
Furthermore, due to considerably large aggregation areas (see clause D.5.1),
considerable amounts of data need to be backhauled to the TCC (up to 10 Mbit/s
per RSU).
### D.5.1 Service area and connection density
It is relatively hard to provide estimates for the service area dimension. One
reason is that it depends on the placement of the base station relative to the
RSUs. Also, the RSUs can, in principle, act as relay nodes for each other. The
service area dimension stated in table 7.2.3.2-1 indicates the size of the
typical data collection area of an RSU (2 km along a road), from which the
minimum spacing of RSUs can be inferred. The connection density can be quite
high in case data is relayed between RSUs, i.e. along the road (1000 km^-2^).
###### ## Annex E (informative): (void)
###### ## Annex F (informative): QoS Monitoring
## F.1 QoS monitoring for assurance
This Clause discusses how QoS monitoring information can be used for assurance
purposes. For background information on assurance see [19] and appendix A.3 in
[20].
Assurance consists of four major steps (see Figure F.1-1 and [18]):
  * _Customer\'s QoS requirements_
> These state the level of quality required by the customer of a service. This
> information is divulged to the provider.
  * _Service provider\'s offerings of QoS (or planned/targeted QoS)_
> This is a statement of the level of quality expected to be offered to the
> customer by the service provider.
  * _QoS achieved/delivered_
> This is the level of quality achieved and delivered to the customer.
> Monitoring information is divulged to the customer.
  * _Customer rating of QoS_
> The customer can compare the QoS achieved by the provider with the QoS
> requirements (see above) and its own experience of the QoS. This is a
> crucial step for establishing assurance about the fulfillment of the
> customer\'s requirements.
Figure F.1-1: QoS assurance by use of QoS monitoring information
> NOTE: This Figure is based on the trust model in reference [18].
The start time and the duration of the QoS monitoring is specified in the
parameter _observation time interval_ , which is exchanged between the
customer, for instance an application consuming a communication service, and
the provider (for instance a private 5G network providing a communication
service). The observation time interval is the time interval during which a
series of measurements is conducted. In the context of QoS monitoring, these
are the measurements necessary for assessing the QoS of communication
services, for instance the measurement of end-to-end latencies.
Examples of parameters to be monitored by the provider are given in annex C in
reference [36].
## F.2 Network Diagnostics
**Network diagnostics** helps with scanning, diagnosing and identifying
problems within a **network**. **Diagnostics includes gathering data and
continuously providing sufficient performance parameters that characterize the
quality of the network connection. This includes data of the physical
connection as well as of logical links and sub-networks. Exposure of relevant
(and possibly aggregated) performance parameters ensures a quick reaction in
case of failure as well as identifying network** connectivity, performance and
other related problems. **Network diagnostic should be able to:**
\- be proactive (to early detect failures) and not only reactive (to deal with
faults that have already occurred).
\- accurately differentiate malfunctions/failures and evaluate their impact on
the service/network.
\- provide clear explanations about what happened.
\- suggest corrective actions, and possibly perform them automatically.
Furthermore, specific connectivity information is also of interest as well as
usage information (e.g. traffic load) of the node (e.g. RAN).
Network diagnostic information needs to be generated automatically and, in
case of a hosted or virtual network deployment, be made available to the
tenant of the network via a suitable API.
###### ## Annex G (informative): Asset Tracking use cases
## G.1 Asset Tracking
Every organisation owns assets (e.g. machines, medical devices, containers,
pallets, trolleys). These assets are often not stationary: they are
transported all over the world by different kinds of vehicles; and the assets
are also moved inside various kinds of buildings.
The ownership of assets can change many times during the life-cycle of the
asset as different stakeholders take possession of the assets and pass them on
to other stakeholders along the supply chain and value chain.
So, many stakeholders want to track their assets anytime and anywhere (indoor
& outdoor) in a global and multi-modal context (e.g. sea, air, road, rail).
The asset tracking topic implies more than just knowing the location of an
asset. Asset tracking includes real time and/or time-stamped monitoring of
several asset-related properties depending on the asset and its content (e.g.
condition of the asset and changes, environmental factors -- temperature,
mechanical shock).
The 5G system provides the capability to better support asset tracking in all
its aspects in particular in term of coverage (need to support full coverage:
e.g. indoor / urban / rural / harsh environments / metallic obstructions on
land, sea) with the support of terrestrial and non- terrestrial network as
well as use of relays when necessary and in term of energy efficiency (15 to
20 years' lifetime of an asset tracking device without changing the battery or
the UE).
## G.2 Battery life expectancy and message size to support example use cases
for asset tracking
For asset tracking it is important to be able to have the asset on the field
during a period corresponding to the life of the asset without changing the UE
or the battery of the UE.
The battery life expectancy, message size and device density values required
to support the potential opportunities in various asset tracking use cases are
summarised in table G.2-1

cases for asset tracking

###### ## Annex H (informative): Interworking between Network Operators and
Application Providers for localized services
This clause illustrates examples of scenarios applicable for interworking
between hosting network operators (PLMN or NPN) and data applications based on
service agreements for localized services among network operators and
application/service providers:
  * Hosting network operator owns the 5G network which provides access > and IP connectivity to serving UEs.
  * Network operator owned application layer entities, e.g., including > Service Hosting Environment, or IMS network.
  * Application platforms in third party domain can be owned by third > party application/service providers, or home/other network > operators.
  * The Application platforms could be application servers (e.g., Video > on Demand Server, Cloud gaming server, etc.), 3rd party software > development platforms, and third party/operator Service Hosting > Environments.
The following figures show the collaborative relationship in three domains
including network operators providing access and IP connectivity, network
operators providing services via IMS/application platforms, and
application/service providers providing services via application platforms or
applications. The dashed line between visited hosting network operator and
Home network operator is based on service level localized service agreement
and the horizontal line represents the demarcation between the network
operator domains and the 3rd party domain. In an operator network, the
application layer entities can include IMS network, Application platforms, and
API Gateway for third party applications developed using APIs (e.g., REST,
GSMA OneAPI).
Figure H-1 provides the home operator owned/collaborative interworking
scenarios where traffic is routed to home network operator and applications
are delivered by the home operator via interworking agreements between network
operators.
Figure H-1: Home Operator owned/collaborative interworking scenario Home
Routed
> Note: The other network operators and service/application operators in 3rd
> party domain provides collaborative services in application platforms to
> Home operator. The arrow solid line represents the traffics routed over
> domains within home operator network while the arrow dash lines represent
> the traffics routed over domains outside of home operator network.
Figure H-2 provides hosting network operator owned and collaborative
interworking scenarios between visited hosting network operator and operators
in 3rd party domains where traffic is routed to application from the hosting
network to 1) hosting network owned application platforms, 2) collaborative
home network owned application platforms, and 3) third parties via
interworking agreements between visited hosting network operator and
home/other network operators, and between hosting network operator and other
application/service providers.
Figure H-2:Hosting Network Operator owned/collaborative interworking scenario
Local Breakout
Note: The other network operators and application/service operators in 3rd
party domain provides collaborative services in application platform to
hosting network operator and/or home network operator. The arrow solid lines
represent the traffics routed over domains within hosting network while the
arrow dash lines represent the traffics routed over domains outside of hosting
operator network.
Other interworking scenarios are not excluded.
