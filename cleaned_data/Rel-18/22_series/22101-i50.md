# 1 Scope
This Technical Specification (TS) describes the Service Principles for PLMNs
specified by 3GPP. Principles and requirements for interworking with WLAN are
covered in TS 22.234 [35].
3GPP specifications provide integrated personal communications services. The
system will support different applications ranging from narrow-band to wide-
band communications capability with integrated personal and terminal mobility
to meet the user and service requirements of the 21^st^ century.
3GPP specifications allow the realisation of a new generation of mobile
communications technology for a world in which personal communications
services should allow person-to-person calling, independent of location, the
terminal used, the means of transmission (wired or wireless) and the choice of
technology. Personal communication services should be based on a combination
of fixed and wireless/mobile services to form a seamless end-to-end service
for the user.
3GPP specifications should be in compliance with the following objectives:
a) to provide a single integrated system in which the user can access services
in an easy to use and uniform way in all environments;
b) to allow differentiation between service offerings of various serving
networks and home environments;
c) to provide a wide range of telecommunications services including those
provided by fixed networks and requiring user bit rates of up to 100 Mbit/s as
well as services special to mobile communications. These services should be
supported in residential, public and office environments and in areas of
diverse population densities. These services are provided with a quality
comparable with that provided by fixed networks such as ISDN and fixed
broadband Internet access;
d) to provide services via hand held, portable, vehicular mounted, movable and
fixed terminals (including those which normally operate connected to fixed
networks), in all environments (in different service environments -
residential, private domestic and different radio environments) provided that
the terminal has the necessary capabilities;
e) to provide support of roaming users by enabling users to access services
provided by their home environment in the same way even when roaming.
f) to provide audio, data, video and particularly multimedia services;
g) to provide for the flexible introduction of telecommunication services;
h) to provide within the residential environment the capability to enable a
pedestrian user to access all services normally provided by fixed networks;
i) to provide within the office environment the capability to enable a
pedestrian user to access all services normally provided by PBXs and LANs;
j) to provide a substitute for fixed networks in areas of diverse population
densities, under conditions approved by the appropriate national or regional
regulatory authority.
k) to provide support for interfaces which allow the use of terminals normally
connected to fixed networks.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Aims of 3GPP specifications
It shall be capable of delivering audio, text, video and graphics direct to
people and provide them with access to the next generation of information-
based services. It moves mobile and personal communications forward from
existing systems, delivering mass market low-cost digital telecommunication
and IP-based multimedia services.
The aims are:
\- to enable users to access a wide range of telecommunications services,
including many that are today undefined as well as multi-media and high data
rates.
\- to facilitate the provision of a high quality of service (particularly
speech quality) similar to that provided by fixed networks;
\- to facilitate the provision of small, easy to use, low cost terminals with
long talk time and long standby operation;
\- to provide an efficient means of using network resources (particularly
radio spectrum).
## 4.2 Standardisation of Service Capabilities
Existing systems have traditionally standardised the complete sets of
teleservices, applications and supplementary services which they provide. As a
consequence, substantial efforts are often required to introduce new services
or simply to modify the existing one (customisation). This makes it more
difficult for operators to differentiate their services. At the same time
however, this may reduce the complexity of providing a service across
different operators\' networks.
3GPP shall therefore preferentially standardise service capabilities. In
circumstances where the service is meant to be used across different
operators\' networks, hence a common specification set is of paramount
importance, the service should be standardised to a level of detail sufficient
to ensure interoperability and interworking across different operators\'
networks. Service capabilities consist of bearers defined by QoS parameters
and the mechanisms needed to realise services. These mechanisms include the
functionality provided by various network elements, the communication between
them and the storage of associated data. This TS provides a conceptual
description of a service architecture and architecture requirements which aim
to provide service capabilities. It is intended that these standardised
capabilities should provide a defined platform which will enable the support
of speech, video, multi-media, messaging, data, teleservices, user
applications and supplementary services and enable the market for services to
be determined by users and home environments.
### 4.2.1 Provision of service capabilities in shared networks
The provision of services and service capabilities that is possible to offer
in a network shall not be restricted by the existence of the network sharing
It shall be possible for a core network operator to differentiate its service
offering from other core network operators within the shared network.
It shall be possible to control the access to service capabilities offered by
a shared network according to the core network operator the user is subscribed
to.
## 4.3 Efficient Use of Network Resources
### 4.3.1 Network Traffic Patterns
Service capabilities shall take account of the discontinuous and asymmetric
nature of most teleservices, multimedia services and user applications and
consider the overheads and signalling surge caused by frequent transmissions
of small amount of data by mobile data application, in order to make efficient
use of network resources (particularly radio resources).
### 4.3.2 Mass Simultaneous Registration
When a large number of subscribers enter in a registration area in which they
have not registered, the core and radio access network shall be able to
provide a capability to optimize the mass simultaneous registration traffic at
a given instance of time. The core and radio access network shall be able to
keep providing the service (e.g. mobile originated and mobile terminated
services) without interruption for those subscribers who are originally in the
cell which receive the mass simultaneous registration traffic.
### 4.3.3 Radio Interface
Service capabilities shall be provided in a wide range of radio operating
environments (where a radio environment is characterised in terms of
propagation environment, mobile equipment relative speeds and traffic
characteristics). Although 3GPP aims to minimise the number of radio
interfaces and to maximise commonality between them, it may utilise several
radio interfaces, each optimised for different environments. Each radio
interface may provide differing service capabilities. 3GPP specifications
include UTRA(N) radio interface supporting two modes (TDD and FDD), an Evolved
UTRA(N) radio interface and GERAN radio interface. Additionally, it may be
possible to connect to the 3GPP system using radio interfaces and fixed access
technologies specified outside of 3GPP.
3GPP specifications shall provide a mechanism which will enable a piece of
user equipment (UE) to adapt to different radio interfaces as necessary and to
determine the service capabilities available. The specifications shall also
provide a mechanism which will enable a UE to select radio interfaces capable
of providing appropriate service capabilities and support mobility between
multiple radio interfaces.
### 4.3.4 Real-time Resource Usage
To enable network operators to render services efficiently, dimension their
networks and set tariffs that more accurately reflect radio resource usage,
real time information on resource usage is needed. When requested, it shall be
possible for the serving cell type (e.g. RAT), cell ID / UTRAN Service Area
Identity and cell / Service Area capability usage (e.g. HSDPA, E-DCH)
information to be made available to the core network. Cell / Service Area
capability usage information may include, for example, user(s) identity, start
and finish time of data transfer, up-link and down-link data rates, volumes of
data and other statistical information.
### 4.3.5 Selected IP Traffic Offload (SIPTO) for PS Domain only
#### 4.3.5.1 Common Requirements for SIPTO in the Mobile Operator Network and
SIPTO at the Local Network
The 3GPP system shall be able to offload selected traffic (e.g. internet)
towards a defined IP network close to the UE\'s point of attachment to the
access network.
The following requirements apply to Selected IP Traffic Offload:
\- The mobile operator may enable/disable Selected IP Traffic Offload on a per
UE per defined IP network basis (e.g. based on tariff, subscription type
etc.).
\- It shall be possible for IP traffic of a UE associated with a particular
defined IP network to be offloaded while IP traffic of that same UE associated
with other defined IP network(s) is not offloaded.
\- It shall be possible to perform Selected IP Traffic Offload for pre-Release
10 UEs.
\- Offloading selected IP traffic for a UE shall not affect services running
in parallel for the same UE.
\- The mobile operator shall be able to collect signalling performance
measurements (e.g. session connection/disconnection, etc) related to Selected
IP Traffic Offload for each user.
\- Selected IP Traffic Offload shall not compromise the security of the mobile
operator\'s network.
\- Service Continuity of IP data session(s) for Selected IP Traffic Offload
may be supported during the following mobility events:
\- mobility between the macro network and H(e)NBs; and
\- mobility between H(e)NBs.
During both these mobility events, based on home mobile operator policies, the
impact of mobility events as perceived by the user shall be reduced by
minimising any interruption to the data flow.
\- It shall be possible for the HPLMN to provide the VPLMN with the following
information for a particular user:
\- An indication of whether the user\'s IP traffic is permitted to be
subjected to Selected IP Traffic Offload in the visited network;
\- The defined IP network(s) for which Selected IP Traffic Offload is
permitted.
Requirements specific to SIPTO at the local residential/enterprise IP network
can be found in section 5.9 in [48].
Some types of services (e.g. streaming services, VOIP, VPN, HTTPS-Based
Services) cannot tolerate a change of IP address of the UE without disruption
of the service.
SIPTO can be performed with or without coordination between the UE and the
network. The following requirements apply to coordinated SIPTO:
\- The 3GPP system shall be able to support multiple connections that are
associated with the same defined IP network where each connection may or may
not support IP address preservation.
\- The 3GPP system shall be able to determine if an IP flow requires IP
address preservation or not. Based on this determination, the 3GPP network
shall be able to offload selected IP traffic in coordinated manner between UE
and the network, in order to minimize service disruption.
\- The 3GPP system shall be able to detect when a connection becomes
suboptimal and decide when to establish a new optimal connection to the same
defined IP network or use an existing connection.
Note 1: The definition of optimal and suboptimal can be based on a number of
implementation criteria like geography, topology and load balancing etc.
\- The 3GPP system shall minimize the number of connections of a UE without
disrupting the UE's services, e.g. to ensure economical use of network
resources.
\- The 3GPP system shall be able to ensure that the actual average aggregate
bit rate for IP flows of packet data network connections associated with the
same packet data network does not significantly exceed the subscribed
aggregate maximum bit rate for this packet data network when two connections
are used with the same defined IP network.
Note 2: Requirements for Coordinated SIPTO do not apply to IMS.
#### 4.3.5.2 Requirements for SIPTO in the Mobile Operator Network
The following requirements apply to Selected IP Traffic Offload in the mobile
operator network:
\- The mobile operator shall be able to enable/disable Selected IP Traffic
Offload for certain parts of the network.
\- Selected IP Traffic Offload shall not compromise integrity and
confidentiality of offloaded traffic.
\- The mobile operator shall be able to collect statistics for the offloaded
traffic for each user.
\- The network shall be able to perform Selected IP Traffic Offload without
any user interaction based on mobile operator policies.
\- Service Continuity of IP data session(s) within the mobile operator network
shall be supported for Selected IP Traffic Offload. Based on home mobile
operator policies, the impact of mobility events within the macro network as
perceived by the user shall be reduced by either:
\- minimising any interruption to the data flow; or
\- preventing interruption to the data flow e.g. for voice services.
\- Service Continuity of IP data session(s) for Selected IP Traffic Offload
may be supported during the following mobility events:
\- mobility between the macro network and H(e)NBs; and
\- mobility between H(e)NBs.
During both these mobility events, based on home mobile operator policies, the
impact of mobility events as perceived by the user shall be reduced by
preventing interruption to the data flow e.g. for voice services.
### 4.3.6 Paging policy selection for LTE
The 3GPP core network shall be able to use these additional criteria for
selecting a paging policy:
\- mobility information on the UE (e.g. the UE is stationary, or moving only
in a specified area)
\- application characteristics that are known and trusted at the serving
network (e.g. communication pattern, expected QoS (e.g. latency, reliability),
and priority)
\- likely location of the UE within the paging area
## 4.4 Compatibility with Global Standards
3GPP specifications aim to be compatible with IMT-2000 and to provide global
terminal mobility (roaming), enabling the user to take his/her terminal to
different regions of the world and to be provided with services. It is
probable that different regions of the world will adopt different radio
interface technologies. IMT-2000, as a global standard, should therefore
enable a IMT-2000 terminal to determine the radio interface technology and the
radio interface standard used in a region. Global terminal roaming also
requires the global standardisation of service capabilities. As far as
possible the method of indication of the radio interface standard and
available service capabilities shall be aligned with IMT-2000.
3GPP specifications shall enable users to access the services provided by
their home environment in the same way via any serving network provided the
necessary service capabilities are available in the serving network.
The 3GPP specifications will be available for the partner organisations to
adopt as their regional standards. For example in Europe, ETSI may adopt them
as standards for both GSM and UMTS.
## 4.5 Void
## 4.6 Functionality of Serving Network and Home Environment
The following functionality shall be the responsibility of the home
environment:
\- User Authentication.
\- SIM/USIM Issue.
\- Billing.
\- User Profile/VHE Management.
The following functionality shall be the responsibility of the serving
network:
\- Radio or other means of access.
\- Transport and signalling.
The following functionality may be the responsibility of either the serving
network, the home environment or an appropriate combination of both
\- Service Control.
\- QoS negotiation.
\- Mobility management, including roaming.
\- Automatic establishment of roaming agreements.
## 4.7 PLMN Architecture
The network is logically divided into a radio access network and a core
network, connected via an open interface. From a functional point of view the
core network is divided into a Packet Switched CN Domain, IP Multimedia (IM)
CN subsystem [27] and a Circuit Switched CN Domain. IM CN subsystem utilises
PS CN domain bearer services.
CS CN domain supports bearer independent transport. There is no difference in
service offering or UE functionality due to different transport.
A PS only 3GPP core network is possible as defined within the specification
for the Evolved Packet System (EPS) [42].
For further information see 3GPP TS 23.221 [20].
## 4.8 Interworking Between PLMN and Wireless LANs
Aspects related to interworking between PLMN and WLAN are captured in TS
22.234 [35].
## 4.9 Network Sharing
Network sharing shall be transparent to the user.
The specifications shall support both the sharing of:
(i) radio access network only;
(ii) radio access network and core network entities connected to radio access
network
NOTE: In a normal deployment scenario only one or the other option will be
implemented.
It shall be possible to support different mobility management rules, service
capabilities and access rights as a function of the home PLMN of the
subscribers.
## 4.10 The Evolved Packet System
Evolved Packet System is an evolution of the 3G UMTS characterized by higher-
data-rate, lower-latency, packet-optimized system that supports multiple RATs.
The Evolved Packet System comprises the Evolved Packet Core together with the
evolved radio access network (E-UTRA and E-UTRAN).The service requirements for
the Evolved Packet System are specified in TS22.278 [42].
## 4.11 User Data Convergence
### 4.11.1 Introduction
The UDC concept [45] supports a layered architecture, separating the data from
the application logic in the 3GPP system, so that user data is stored in a
logically unique repository allowing access from core and service layer
entities, named application front-ends. And such unique repository shall be
possible to be shared among different PLMNs that have trusted relationships.
Network elements and functionalities should be designed to access profile data
remotely and without storing them permanently locally, i.e. the front-ends
shall work in a subscriber data-less configuration.
In some cases, services may depend on user data scattered over UDC and other
network elements. UDC may support the ability to access necessary network
elements to fetch user data on behalf of these services, while minimizing
impacts on existing Network Elements in which the data is located.
Applications can subscribe to specific events which will likely occur on
specific user data, and those should be notified when those events do appear.
The events can be changes on existing user data, addition of user data, and so
on.
Third-party applications and non-trusted network elements should only be able
to access the user data after proper authentication and authorization taking
into account security and privacy requirements, i.e. it should be possible to
present different views on the data to the parties which require access,
dependent on the authorization. UDC concept is backwards compatible with 3GPP
systems, i.e. it does not have an impact on traffic mechanisms, reference
points and protocols of existing network elements.
The UDC concept preserves user authentication and authorization of services
across domains, ensuring secured users\' access to network.
### 4.11.2 Management of user data
Due to the logical centralization of user data, it is necessary for UDC to
support the provisioning of the user data, that is, user data manipulation
like creation, deletion, reading, modification and other operations.
Provisioning shall be possible via an external system, self-care or
dynamically via applications offering e.g. user service configuration
facilities.
Operations carried out in the framework of UDC shall support the ACID
(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) characteristics.
### 4.11.3 User Data Modelling
User Data Modelling refers to the different models that apply to user data
convergence: Information Models and Data Models.
An Information Model denotes an abstract, formal representation of entity
types, including their properties and relationships, the operations (e.g.
read, write...) that can be performed on them, and related rules and
constraints. In the information model, entities might have network topology
relationship with each other.
In order to accommodate multiple applications and services, existing and new
ones, a common baseline information model shall be developed and shall, at
minimum, clearly distinguish a number of concepts as entity types:
\- Subscriber with relation to several users (e.g. a company and its
employees),
\- A user attached to different subscriptions (e.g. for a private and a
professional service usage)
\- A user using multiple devices (e.g. mobiles or fixed)
\- Grouping of users to certain categories
\- A particular user as member of a certain group
\- Service providers\' services provided by network operators
\- Enterprise services provided by network operators
The baseline information model shall be future proof. It shall not be tied to
any specific implementation of the data base or its interfaces. It shall
provide flexibility (in its data structure and content), extensibility and
multi-application approach.
By extensible, it shall be understood that new applications and/or new service
profiles can be added by the operator, if necessary. The flexibility shall
permit new data for existing applications to be introduced, or modified.
Data Models are practical implementations of the information model, e.g. Tree-
like modelling. The common information model shall allow deriving one or more
data models. A reference data model shall be standardized for the message
exchange over Ud interface [50], in order to enable multivendor
interoperability.
Each application shall only interface the UDC for the data it is dealing with,
and not be impacted by other data that UDC stores for other applications. It
corresponds to the concept of a data view specific to a given application.
An application can allow access by other applications to data for which it is
responsible. This can be done under certain constraint customized by
operators.
Access to the UDC data shall be independent of the structure of the data
models, i.e. the changes in the data models shall not affect the interface.
# 5 Evolution
## 5.1 Support of 2G services
The 3GPP specifications shall be capable of supporting existing 2G services in
a manner which is transparent to the users of these services.
## 5.2 Provision and evolution of services
Since a phased approach has been adopted, the same general service principles
shall apply to each phase. Support of services from an end user perspective is
understood to be an important driver for established mobile users to stay with
their existing operator while taking the new services into use. It is
therefore important to enable operators to offer continued support of legacy
services in future releases. Previous release services shall as a principle
also be supported in the following releases.
Networks shall be capable of providing a specified core set of capabilities.
The core set of capabilities should permit home environment to offer a range
of distinctive services including those which cannot be implemented on systems
based on previous release specifications.
It shall be possible for the home environment to develop services with full
roaming capability.
The radio interface should not unnecessarily restrict the development of new
services (within physical limitations).
The standard shall provide a mechanism which allows a terminal to be easily
upgraded so that it can access new services which are within the physical
limitations of the terminal.
# 6 Classification of services
In the CS CN domain, the basic services are divided into circuit teleservices
(3GPP TS 22.003 [14]) and bearer services (3GPP TS 22.002 [21]) and they can
utilise standardised supplementary services (3GPP TS 22.004 [5]).
The PS CN Domain provides IP bearer services. SMS, USSD and UUS can also be
considered as bearer services for some applications.
IP multimedia services are the IP based session related services, including
voice communications. IP multimedia sessions use IP bearer services provided
by the PS CN Domain.
Value added non-call related services include a large variety of different
operator specific services/applications. They are usually not specified by
3GPP. The services can be based on fully proprietary protocols or standardised
protocols outside 3GPP.
In order to create or modify the above services (both call and non-call
related services) operators may utilise toolkits standardised by 3GPP (such as
CAMEL or LCS) or external solutions (e.g. Internet mechanisms). Pre-paid is an
example of an application created with toolkits that may apply to all of the
above services categories.
Figure 1: Service classification
# 7 Principles for new service capabilities
## 7.1 General
3GPP specifications shall enable the user of a single terminal to establish
and maintain several connections simultaneously. It shall efficiently cater
for applications which have variable requirements relating to specific QoS
parameters (e.g. throughput) whilst meeting other QoS targets. It shall also
cater for applications which are able to take adapt to a range of variations
in QoS.
## 7.2 Multimedia
3GPP specifications shall support development of multimedia services and
provide the necessary capabilities.
Multimedia services combine two or more media components (e.g. voice, audio,
data, video, pictures, text) within one call. A multimedia service may involve
several parties and connections (different parties may provide different media
components) and therefore flexibility is required in order to add and delete
both resources and parties.
Multimedia services are typically classified as interactive or distribution
services.
Interactive services are typically subdivided into conversational, messaging
and retrieval services:
[Conversational services]{.underline} are real time (no store and forward),
usually bi-directional where low end to end delays (\ 19 Police (Albania)
>
> 100 Police and Fire Brigade (Greek cities)
>
> 100 Ambulance and Fire Brigade (Belgium)
>
> 112 Police and Ambulance (Italy)
>
> 112 General emergency call, all categories (Sweden)
>
> 115 Fire Brigade (Italy)
>
> 144 Ambulance (Austria)
If the UE does not recognise the emergency call numbers but the serving
network recognises the dialled number as an emergency call number used in the
country, a normal call set up shall take place over the radio interface and
after the serving network has recognised the emergency number the call shall
be routed as an emergency call.
The user friendly MMI that specifies the type of emergency call directly (e.g.
menu) should be supported for use in any (i.e. home or visited) PLMN to avoid
the misconnection in roaming case. This shall be allowed both with and without
SIM/USIM being present.
When emergency call establishment is initiated, the emergency call type shall
be sent by the UE if it is available.
The serving network may download emergency call numbers to the UE in order to
ensure that local emergency call numbers are known to the UE. In case of PLMN,
the UE shall regard these emergency numbers as valid in that country only (as
identified by the MCC) and shall discard them when a new country is entered.
Note 3: The UE can inform the user if the emergency call type for an emergency
number received from the serving network differs from that configured on the
USIM/SIM for the same number. How this is implemented is outside the scope of
3GPP and takes into consideration operator policy and regulatory requirements.
If permitted by local regulation, it shall be possible for the user to prevent
the sending of his public user identifiers and the location information to the
PSAP (i.e. emergency response centre).
Note 4: Operator policies (e.g. requirements for support of emergency
communications) may over-ride the user request for suppression.
Emergency calls over WLAN shall be supported as above with the following
caveats:
  * The UE issues an Emergency session over WLAN access to EPC only when 3GPP access for emergency call is not possible or available (e.g. no 3GPP coverage).
  * UEs shall only be able to establish an Emergency session over WLAN when the UE has been provisioned with the WLAN access parameters.
  * Service continuity for an Emergency voice call moving from 3GPP access CS domain to WLAN access IMS domain is not supported.
  * The level of security should not be less than that which is currently applied to authenticated and unauthenticated CS or IMS emergency calls. 
  * Emergency call numbers downloaded to the UE over WLAN from untrusted sources shall not be used by the UE.
NOTE 5: TS 23.402 [57] establishes when WLAN is trusted or not.
  * Subject to local 3GPP operator policy, the UE may use additional emergency call number(s) received via WLAN access for emergency calls via 3GPP access or WLAN access, while in the country for which the numbers were received.
### 10.1.1 Identification of emergency numbers
The ME shall identify an emergency number dialled by the end user as a valid
emergency number and initiate emergency call establishment if it occurs under
one or more of the following conditions. If it occurs outside of the following
conditions, the ME should not initiate emergency call establishment but normal
call establishment. Emergency number identification takes place before and
takes precedence over any other (e.g. supplementary service related) number
analysis.
a) 112 and 911 shall always be available. These numbers shall be stored on the
ME.
b) Any emergency call number stored on a SIM/USIM when the SIM/USIM is
present.
c) 000, 08, 110, 999, 118 and 119 when a SIM/USIM is not present. These
numbers shall be stored on the ME.
d) Additional emergency call numbers that may have been downloaded by the
serving network when the SIM/USIM is present.
### 10.1.2 Domains priority and selection for UE attempts to emergency call
#### 10.1.2.1 Voice and GTT only
A UE that is connected to a domain in which it is possible for the UE to make
non emergency calls using the particular media requested by the user, shall
use that domain to attempt an emergency call unless serving network policy
(based on regulatory requirements and operator needs) requires the UE,
including an unauthenticated UE, to attempt the emergency call on a specific
domain first.
If the UE is connected to more than one domain in which it is possible for the
UE to make non emergency calls using the particular media requested by the
user, the UE shall attempt an emergency call on the same domain it would use
to originate a non-emergency call using the same media unless serving network
policy (based on regulatory requirements and operator needs) requires the UE,
including an unauthenticated UE, to attempt the emergency call on a specific
domain first.
In the case where an emergency call attempt by a UE fails, the UE should
automatically make a second attempt on the other domain if the UE supports it.
If the user aborts the emergency call setup during the subsequent automatic
attempt and immediately tries to set up an emergency call again, then the UE
shall immediately attempt in the domain in which the user aborted the
emergency call.
#### 10.1.2.2 Other media
The following applies in addition to 10.1.2.1.
If an emergency call attempt that includes a request for both (i) voice and/or
GTT and (ii) other media cannot be supported or fails in all connected access
types in the PS CN domain, the UE shall attempt the emergency call in the CS
domain if available and shall only include the request for voice and/or GTT.
### 10.1.3 Call-Back Requirements
Subject to local/regional regulations the network shall support a call-back
from a PSAP.
It shall be possible to supply the user\'s Directory Number/MSISDN/SIP URI as
the CLI to the PSAP to facilitate call-back. The CLI used on call-back shall
allow the PSAP to contact the same terminal that originated the emergency
call.
If the incoming call can be identified by the core network as a call-back to
an emergency call (i.e. coming from a PSAP) then supplementary services at the
terminating party shall be handled as described in TS 22.173 [40] for
Multimedia Telephony (e.g. Communication Diversion, Communication Hold,
Communication Barring).
NOTE: There is no specific callback requirement for CS supplementary services.
A call-back may be attempted for a period of time defined by local regulations
after the emergency call release. In case of a UE in limited service state,
call-back is not required.
## 10.2 Emergency calls in the CS CN Domain
A CS CN Domain shall support the emergency call teleservice as defined in 3GPP
TS 22.003 [14] (TS12).
If a UE supports TS11(Telephony)[14], then it shall also support
TS12(Emergency Calls)[14]. It shall be possible to set up emergency calls
initiated by an emergency call number.
## 10.3 Emergency Calls in the PS CN Domain
Without the IM CN subsystem, emergency calls are not supported in the PS CN
domain.
## 10.4 Emergency calls in the IM CN subsystem
### 10.4.1 General
The IM CN subsystem shall support IMS emergency calls. It shall be possible to
set up emergency calls initiated by an emergency call number.
If a UE supports IMS Multimedia Telephony service with speech media as
specified in TS 22.173 [40] via an access network, then it shall also support
IMS emergency calls via that access network.
Subject to the regulatory requirement, the IM CN subsystem shall be able to
unambiguously identify each emergency service defined in the national
numbering plan for the country in which the UE is located.
In accordance with national regulations for where the subscriber is located,
if the UE does not recognise a dialled number as an emergency call number but
the IM CN where the subscriber is located does recognise the dialled number as
an emergency call number (e.g. a number used in the local emergency numbering
plan) then the call shall be routed as an emergency call indicating the type
of emergency service to the correct PSAP. Subject to operator setting the call
may be prioritized.
Note 1: The above does not preclude the network rejecting the call and
requesting the UE to setup a new emergency call to the same emergency service.
The serving network may download emergency call numbers and emergency call
types, together with a validity indication of this list, for use in the IM CN
subsystem so that local emergency call numbers are made known to the UE.
Depending on the validity indication, the UE shall regard these emergency
numbers and emergency call types as valid in that country (as identified by
the MCC) and shall discard them when a new country is entered, or the UE shall
regard these emergency numbers and emergency call types as valid in that
serving network, which can be a PLMN (as identified by the MCC and MNC) or an
NPN, and shall discard them when the UE enters a new PLMN or NPN.
Emergency calls may be initiated using a private numbering plan [49].
Note 2: There can be an overlap between the private numbering plan of a hosted
enterprise and the public numbering plan, which makes translation of emergency
numbers necessary.
Emergency calls may be initiated by a service when requested by the user.
Note 3: It is not intended to enable automatic setup of emergency calls.
Note 4: Only speech and GTT-IP [47] media are supported, when required per
subclause 10.1, for emergency services towards a CS PSAP.
An emergency call shall take precedence over any other services a UE may be
engaged in, if required by local regulation.
Emergency calls from an unauthenticated UE (as far as the IM CN is concerned)
shall be supported by the IM CN subsystem, if required by local regulation.
Subject to regulatory requirements, when UEs must be authenticated, both the
network and the UE shall support the same authentication and security methods
that are used for non-emergency sessions.
### 10.4.2 IMS Multimedia Emergency Sessions
#### 10.4.2.1 General
For IMS emergency calls towards IP PSAPs, other media types may be supported
by the UE and the IMS, subject to regulatory requirements.
The media types that may be supported during an IMS MES include:
\- Real time video (simplex, full duplex), synchronized with speech if
present;
\- Session mode text-based instant messaging;
\- File transfer;
\- Video clip sharing, picture sharing, audio clip sharing;
\- Voice; and
\- Real-Time Text .
Note 1: An IMS MES need not contain voice or Real-Time Text .
To avoid interworking issues, a UE and IMS that supports text based instant
messaging shall support a common session mode text-based instant messaging
protocol.
IMS MES does not include support for legacy store and forward messaging such
as the Short Messaging Service (SMS).
Calls from non-human associated devices (e.g. fire alarms) are outside the
scope of this specification.
Adding, removing and modifying individual media to/from an IMS MES shall be
supported.
An IMS MES is not a subscription service. A UE capable of IMS emergency calls
and capable of supporting the other media types should also be able to support
initiation of an IMSMES.
An IMS MES from an unauthenticated UE (as far as the IM CN is concerned) shall
be supported by the IM CN subsystem, if required by local regulation.
IMS MES shall be supported by UEs that are subject to service restrictions,
e.g. for UEs camping on a cell in a forbidden PLMN or in a forbidden LA (see
3GPP TS 22.011 [11]), or on a CSG cell without the subscriber being a member
of that CSG (see 3GPP TS 22.220 [48]). Such IMS MES shall be accepted by the
network if required by local regulation.
An IMS MES shall support providing the location of the UE, in a manner similar
to IMS emergency voice calls.
An IMS UE that supports IMS MES shall identify an emergency number dialled by
the end user as a valid emergency number utilizing the same mechanisms as used
for IMS emergency voice calls as defined in subclause 10.1.1.
Note 2: This capability supports the general public, including facilitating
emergency communications by individuals with disabilities (e.g. persons who
are deaf, deaf-blind, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability).
An originating network and UE may support some or all of these other media
types, and support of any specific media by an originating network or UE may
be subject to regulatory requirements.
Voice call continuity per clause 21 shall be supported when a UE with an
active IMS MES with voice and other media moves out of IMS voice coverage and
voice call continuity is supported by the UE and network. The remaining media
(i.e. voice call) then becomes a CS emergency call e.g. TS12 call for 3GPP
systems as defined in 3GPP TS 22.003 [14].
Other media shall be dropped when a UE with an active IMS MES moves out of IMS
voice coverage, irrespective of whether or not there is an active voice
session.
#### 10.4.2.2 UE Requirements
When IMS MES are supported by the UE, the following apply:
\- An IMS UE that supports IMS MES shall also support IMS emergency voice
calls.
\- Once a UE is aware that an IMS MES has been initiated, the UE shall be able
to (subject to user configuration) avoid drawing unnecessary attention to the
user (e.g., playing audible tones or flashing brightly) and should confirm
this to the user in as private a manner as is reasonable e.g. using text on
the screen or audio if headphones are already connected. UE behaviour in an
IMS MES may need to be different relative to the normal configuration.
\- The UE should clearly differentiate IMS emergency session-mode text based
instant messaging from IMS non-emergency session-mode text based instant
messaging on the user display.
\- The IMS UE supporting video transfer during an IMS MES should be able to
deliver recorded media in a form that allows progressive playback. (It is
desirable that all pre-recorded media sent during an emergency session be
progressively viewable.)
\- When an IP PSAP attempts to add additional media to an existing IMS MES,
the user shall be made aware of this. When additional media is requested by
the PSAP, the user shall be able to permit or deny it.
\- The UE shall provide an indication to the user for each requested media,
whether it was successfully or unsuccessfully established.
\- Further notifications of added and removed media shall be indicated to the
user while the IMS MES is active.
\- If none of the media requested by the UE is successfully established, the
IMS MES will fail and an IMS MES failure indication shall be provided to the
user.
\- In handover of an IMS MES where other media is dropped when IMS MES is not
supported, the UE shall indicate to the end user that the other media is not
supported in this area.
The following requirements for IMS emergency voice calls also apply when an
IMS MES is supported by the UE:
\- An IMS UE that supports IMS MES shall indicate to the network that the call
is an IMS emergency call as is done for an IMS emergency voice call.
\- An IMS UE that supports IMS MES shall be able to receive an IMS call-back
from a PSAP per clause 10.1.3 with voice, GTT or other media per clause
10.4.2.1.
\- An IMS UE that supports MES shall utilize the same trust and security
mechanisms for the other media as utilized for an IMS emergency voice call.
\- When roaming, a UE shall originate an IMS MES in the serving network in the
same manner as for IMS emergency voice calls.
#### 10.4.2.3 Originating Network Requirements
When an IMS MES is enabled by the originating network, the following apply:
\- Other media shall only be supported in packet-based networks that support
IMS emergency voice calls.
\- The originating network shall deliver all media to the same IP PSAP
throughout the duration of the IMS MES.
\- The network shall indicate to the UE, for each requested media, whether it
was successfully or unsuccessfully established.
\- Further notification of added and removed media shall be provided to the UE
while the IMS MES is active.
\- If none of the media requested by the UE is successfully established, the
IMS MES will fail and an IMS MES failure indication will be provided to the
UE.
The following requirements for IMS emergency voice calls also apply when IMS
MES is supported by the network:
\- Subject to regional regulatory requirements, the network shall be able to
authenticate the UE using the same procedures as for IMS emergency voice
calls.
\- The originating network shall provide the capability to enable an IMS UE
supporting IMS MES to obtain local emergency numbers or other emergency
address(es) (e.g. destination address) utilizing the same mechanism as used
for IMS emergency voice calls.
\- An IMS MES shall be provided in the local serving network.
\- For an IMS MES, any kind of emergency addressing (e.g. SIP URIs, Tel URIs)
and special indications for emergency sessions shall be treated in the same
manner as IMS emergency voice calls.
\- The originating network should detect all IMS MESs regardless of the UE
emergency call indication. According to operator policy, the originating
network may either inform the UE to enable re-origination as an IMS MES or
support origination of the initial call.
\- The originating network shall be responsible for routing the IMS MES
towards the appropriate PSAP (e.g., based on emergency service type, location,
or policy).
\- The network shall be able to provide integrity protection, and/or privacy
for other media similar to that provided for IMS emergency voice calls.
\- An IMS MES shall utilize the same priority mechanisms as IMS emergency
voice calls.
\- Detailed log records of the IMS MES shall be generated by the originating
network in a similar manner to IMS emergency voice calls and subject to
regulatory requirements.
\- All media content within the IMS MES shall be carried with an indication of
the source, in a similar manner as for IMS emergency voice calls.
## 10.5 Void
## 10.6 Location Availability for Emergency Calls
National regulations may require wireless networks to provide the emergency
caller\'s location. This requirement typically overrides the caller\'s right
to privacy with respect to their location being revealed, but remains in
effect only as long as the authorities need to determine the caller\'s
location. The interpretation of the duration of this privacy override may also
be different, subject to national regulation. For example, some countries
require location to be available from the wireless network only while the call
is up, while others may allow PSAP\'s to unilaterally decide how long the
location must be made available.
Therefore, the requirement for providing location availability is to allow the
network to support providing a mobile caller\'s location to the authorities
for as long as required by the national regulation in force for that network.
NOTE: See TS 22.071 [44] for location service requirements on emergency calls.
## 10.7 Transfer of data during emergency calls
Emergency calls may be supplemented with emergency related data [1]. Typically
this data enables the accurate geographic location of a manually or
automatically activated emergency calling device e.g. an in vehicle system
(IVS), to be provided to the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).
The following requirements apply to UEs designed to be able to perform eCalls
and to networks supporting eCall:
\- The data may be sent prior to, in parallel with, or at the start of the
voice component of an eCall.
\- Should the PSAP request additional data then this may be possible during
the established eCall.
\- The realisation of the transfer of data during an eCall shall minimise
changes to the originating and transit networks.
\- Both the voice and data components of the eCall shall be routed to the same
PSAP or designated emergency call centre.
\- The transmission of the data shall be acknowledged and, if necessary, data
shall be retransmitted.
\- The UE shall indicate at call setup if the emergency call will carry
supplementary data, i.e. is an eCall.
UEs designed to be able to perform eCalls and configured to only perform
eCalls (eCall only mode) shall comply with the following additional
requirements:
  * The UE shall not perform mobility management procedures, including registration on a PLMN, except when attempting to initiate and during an eCall, or to initiate a test or reconfiguration of the terminal upon request from the user.
  * For UEs that have the ability to be called back by the PSAP, the UE shall be capable to continue mobility management procedures for a limited duration following the termination of the eCall.
\- The UE shall contain an USIM application.
\- In the case where the user subscribes to other services provided by the
PLMN, it shall be possible for the network operator to reconfigure the UE so
that it can access the subscribed services.
\- It shall be possible for the user of the UE to change network
operator/service provider (i.e. to use a different USIM) or for the subscriber
to modify the existing subscription used with the UE.
\- It shall be possible for the UE upon request from the user to initiate a
call to an operator designated non-emergency MSISDN for the purpose of
accessing test and terminal reconfiguration services.
Additional national and regional requirements are as specified in Annex A.
## 10.8 Supplementary service interaction during emergency calls
Supplementary services that interrupt or divert the media path between a PSAP
and the end device shall be handled as specified in TS 22.173 [40] (e.g.
Communication Hold) for Multimedia Telephony. No such Supplementary Services
are applicable to CS Emergency Calls (TS12) according to TS 22.004 [5].
## 10.9 Emergency Calls in a MUSIM UE
A MUSIM UE shall be able to select a USIM to originate an emergency call in
the following priority:
\- USIM in normal service
\- USIM in limited service state
The MUSIM UE shall avoid interruptions of emergency call procedures of one
USIM by other services of other USIM.
Subject to regulatory requirements, call-back requirements defined in clause
10.1.3 apply to a MUSIM UE.
## 10.10 Emergency Services over Non-public networks
Subject to local/regional regulations, the 5G system shall support IMS
Multimedia Emergency services (see clause10.4) over non-public network (NPN)
[59] for NPNs using IMS.
## 10.11 Short Message Service over IMS to emergency centre
EPS and 5GS shall route a Short Message over IMS using the emergency numbers
to a local emergency response centre (i.e. PSAP), according to the local
regulations.
The Short Message shall be routed to the emergency response centre serving the
location where the subscriber is located and replies routed back to the
subscriber in accordance with national regulations as specified in 10.1.
The 3GPP system shall support a Short Message to be routed to different
emergency response centres, depending on the type of emergency as specified in
10.1.
The Short Message Service to emergency response centre shall be supported
without a SIM/USIM/ISIM being present.
Note 1: It will be left to the national authorities to decide whether the
network accepts Short Message Service to emergency response centre without the
SIM/USIM/ISIM.
The Short Message Service to emergency response centre shall be able to use
the same identification methods as for emergency calls, as specified in
10.1.1.
Subject to local/regional regulations Short Message Service to emergency
response centre shall support location service as specified in chapter 10.6.
## 10.12 Emergency Sessions over Relay UEs
Where the 5G system supports remote UE access to emergency sessions via relay
UEs, the following requirements apply:
\- Subject to local regulatory requirements, the UE shall first attempt to
make an emergency session via any available network. If the UE fails to find a
network that allows emergency sessions, the UE shall attempt an emergency
session via a relay UE.
\- Subject to local regulatory requirements, the 5G system shall route
emergency sessions to an appropriate PSAP for the location of the remote UE,
which can be in the same country of the remote UE or not.
# 11 Numbering principles
The following network addressing schemes listed below shall be supported at
the relevant domains:
\- E.164,
\- E.168,
\- E.212,
\- X.121
\- Internet (including e.g. IP address, SIP URI).
## 11.1 Number portability
### 11.1.1 Requirements for CS CN domain
Some numbering schemes shall be fully independent of the supporting serving
network and the home environment, allowing users to transfer this number to
another home environment. For further information see 3GPP TS 22.066 [7].
An MSISDN shall be allocated to each new user at the start of a subscription.
This number may be allocated from one of several numbering domains. For
example:
\- home / serving environment numbering scheme;
\- national numbering scheme;
\- regional numbering scheme;
\- global numbering scheme.
A user shall be able to move subscription from one home environment to another
without changing the MSISDN provided that the new home environment offers
service in the same geographic domain. It is envisaged that home environment s
will be able to allocate MSISDNs from each of these domains as required.
### 11.1.2 Requirements for PS CN domain
None identified.
### 11.1.3 Requirements for IM CN subsystem
It shall be possible to offer number portability for E.164 numbers within IM
CN subsystem. For further information see 3GPP TS 22.066 [7].
## 11.2 Evolution path
Since 3GPP specifications aim to be aligned with IMT-2000, a primary goal in
numbering is the provision of global user numbering in line with steps taken
by the ITU - SG2.
The numbering scheme and network implementation chosen shall allow for
international/global evolution.
## 11.3 Void
## 11.4 Void
## 11.5 Void
## 11.6 Private numbering
A user may wish to use private numbers for the purposes of calling frequent
numbers. Therefore there is a requirement for the use, by the user, of Private
Numbering Plans (PNPs). These schemes may belong to the user himself, to a
home environment or a third-party.
## 11.7 Numbering schemes
### 11.7.1 Multiple numbering scheme
The standards shall support the possibility of allowing the bearer service
associated with an MT call to be implicitly defined by the destination MSISDN,
for example to use a different MSISDN to establish voice, fax or data. It will
be possible for multiple MSISDNs to be associated with a single subscription.
### 11.7.2 Single numbering scheme
The standards shall support the possibility of allowing MT calls of different
bearer types (e.g. voice, fax, data) to be routed to a single MSISDN. It is
recognised that the implementation of this may depend on the availability of
bearer information associated with an incoming call from the adjoining transit
network. In particular the standards will support this possibility in the case
of an adjoining ISDN transit network.
### 11.7.3 Additional numbers
The 3GPP system shall support the possibility to assign an additional MSISDN,
in addition to the original MSISDN, to a user with a connection to the PS CN
domain. If this additional MSISDN is available, it shall be used for
correlation of CS and IMS in voice call and service continuity as well as IMS
Centralized Service. In this case the original MSISDN may be used for charging
and OA&M purposes and forwarded to the PS gateway to other packet data
networks.
## 11.8 Optimal routing {#optimal-routing .list-paragraph}
The implementation of the numbering scheme used shall allow for optimal
routing; i.e. routing shall not take place simply on the number dialled.
See 3GPP TS 22.079 [8] for some scenarios for the CS CN domain. Optimal
routing for IP services is supported by the All-IP Network [42].
# 11a Identification Requirements
## 11a.1 Subscriber Identification
In 3GPP the identity of a subscriber is encoded in a identity module
application which is contained on a UICC or on a GSM SIM card. The GSM SIM
card is a removable component of the User Equipment; UICC can be removable or
also embedded. Three types of identity modules are used in the 3GPP system:
\- Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM)
\- IMS Subscriber Identity Module (ISIM)
\- Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) according to GSM
General requirements:
\- In the 3GPP system each subscriber shall be uniquely identifiable.
\- The serving networks shall be able to authenticate any subscriber that
roams onto their network
\- If a UE, that is registered on the serving network, contains a GSM SIM card
or a UICC containing a identity module application, the serving network shall
be able to identify the associated home PLMN.
Note 1: UE support of GSM SIM is optional.
Note 2: See the chapter (USIM, UICC and Terminal) of the present specification
for a reference, which GSM phase SIMs need to be supported by the network.
## 11a.2 Terminal Identification
It is a requirement that the terminal can be uniquely identified by the home
environment and serving network. This shall require a terminal identity scheme
which uniquely identifies each terminal, see 3GPP TS 22.016[12].
## 11a.3 Home Environment / Serving Network Identification
Home / serving environments need to route communication to the current
location of the user. This shall require a identity scheme which uniquely
identifies the serving environment and shall be used for routing purposes.
## 11a.4 Serving Environment / Mobile Virtual Network Identification
A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) is a service provider that does not
have its own radio access network, but resells wireless services, typically
under their own brand name, using the network of a host PLMN operator.
It should be possible to uniquely identify subscribers belonging to a
particular MVNO.
# 12 Human Factors and user procedures
The User Interface (MMI) from the end-user\'s point of view should be as
flexible as possible while still meeting the general service requirements. In
addition, it should be capable of being updated so as to meet new services
which are still to be envisaged.
In general, the following principles should be encompassed:
\- activation of services should be as simple as possible with minimum input
expected from the user;
\- feedback, to the user from the various services, should be meaningful;
\- any error recovery procedures provided should be simple to understand and
execute.
\- input from the user and information to the user should be provided in
alternative selectable modes in order to match user capabilities, preferences
and situation.
However, a detailed specification for the User Interface shall not be defined.
In particular given the global nature of the third generation systems, for
different regions of the world, different criteria will determine the
implementation of the User Interface. Also it is unlikely that there will be a
single common handset which will meet all the service requirements and
therefore a common User Interface would be impractical.
Given the flexibility of the services, there should be a wide range of User
Interface possibilities. These possibilities include simple terminals with a
single on/off button through to complex terminals providing support to
hearing/visually impaired users.
Control of CS CN Domain supplementary services (3GPP TS 22.004 [5]), may use
MMI procedures specified in 3GPP TS 22.030 [6] and existing MMI related UE
features (Annex A) may also be used. In particular the following features are
highly desirable for uniform UE implementation where appropriate:
\- Mapping of numeric keys to European alphabetic keys to ensure compatible
mnemonic dialing as defined in 3GPP TS 22.030 [6],
\- \"+\" key function to enable one key international access as defined in
Annex A
\- Structure of the MMI as described in 3GPP TS 22.030 [6]
\- Presentation of IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) as defined
in 3GPP TS 22.030 [6].
# 13 UICC, USIM and Terminal
This clause defines the functional characteristics and requirements of the
User Service Identity Module (USIM) and ISIM (IM Services Identity Module).
The USIM/ISIM are applications residing on a UICC.
## 13.1 The USIM/ISIM and User Profiles
### 13.1.1 The USIM
Every USIM shall have a unique identity and shall be associated with one and
only one home environment.
It shall be possible for a home environment to uniquely identify a user by the
USIM.
The USIM shall be used to provide security features.
For access to services, provided by PS or CS CN domains, a valid USIM shall be
required. Optionally, SIM according to GSM phase 2, GSM phase 2+, 3GPP release
99, 3GPP release 4 specifications may be supported.
The USIM shall be able to support SIM Application Toolkit as specified in 3GPP
TS 22.038 [3].
The USIM shall reside on a UICC. USIM specific information shall be protected
against unauthorised access or alteration.
It shall be possible to update USIM specific information via the radio
interface, in a secure manner.
Access to the IMS services shall be possible using the USIM application in the
event of no ISIM being present on the UICC. If an ISIM is present on the UICC
it shall be used to access the IMS.
It shall be possible to store provisioning parameters on the USIM according to
DM specifications [37].
It should be possible to store provisioning parameters on the USIM according
to CP specifications [38].
It shall be possible for the network operator to configure the USIM to
indicate (through personalisation and OTA) whether provisioning parameters
according to DM specifications or provisioning parameters according to CP
specifications shall be used.
NOTE: To avoid misoperation of the UE in a mixed provisioning environment e.g.
during a transition phase when both CP and DM clients are present in the UE,
the CP parameters on the USIM can be read first. If DMinformation is present
(provisioned OTA in the CP parameters.), then use DM, otherwise use CP.
Annex A describes a number of features that may optionally be supported by the
UE and thus USIM.
### 13.1.2 User Profiles
It shall be possible for a user to be associated with one or a number of user
profiles, which the user can select and activate on a per call basis. The user
profile contains information which may be used to personalise services for the
user.
It shall be possible for one or more user profiles associated with the same
user to be active simultaneously so that the user may make or receive calls
associated with different profiles simultaneously. Activation of profiles
shall be done in a secure manner, for example with the use of a PIN.
For terminating calls the correct profile shall be indicated by the user
address used (e.g. MSISDN, SIP URI), each profile will have at least one
unique user address associated with it. For originating calls the user shall
be able to choose from the available profiles, the appropriate one for the
call. A profile identity will need to be associated with the call for
accounting and billing purposes. User profile identities need not be
standardised but a standardised means is required for indicating that a
particular profile is being used.
Simultaneous use of the same user profile on multiple terminals for the same
type of service shall not be allowed.
User profiles associated with different home environments shall not share the
same user address.
### 13.1.3 UICC usage in GERAN only Terminals
In Release 5 and later, terminals supporting only GERAN shall support USIM.
NOTE: It is strongly recommended that manufacturers implement SIM support on
GERAN only terminals until the population of SIMs in the market is reduced to
a low level.
### 13.1.4 Multiple USIMs per UICC
The standard shall support more than one USIM per UICC even when those USIMs
are associated with different home environments. Only one of the USIMs or the
SIM shall be active at a given time. While the UE is in idle mode, it shall be
possible for the user to select/reselect one USIM application amongst those
available on the UICC. At switch on, the Last Active USIM shall be
automatically selected. The Last Active USIM shall be stored on the UICC. By
default if there is no Last Active USIM defined in the UICC, the user shall be
able to select the active USIM amongst those available on the UICC.
The standard must not prevent the coexistence of USIM applications, each
associated with different home environments on the same UICC, so long as the
security problems which arise from such a coexistence are solved.
### 13.1.5 The ISIM
Access to the IMS services shall be possible using an ISIM application.
The ISIM shall be sufficient for providing the necessary security features for
the IMS and IMS only.
The ISIM shall reside on a UICC. ISIM specific information shall be protected
against unauthorised access or alteration.
It shall be possible to update ISIM specific information via the radio
interface, in a secure manner.
NOTE: When accessing IMS over GERAN/UTRAN/EUTRAN or I-WLAN using ISIM, a USIM
needs also be present to access the rest of the 3GPP system. Alternatively
USIM could be used to access IMS.
## 13.2 The UICC
**Characteristics including physical formats of a UICC are defined in TS
31.101[36].**
Access to services via 3GPP system with a single UICC shall be possible.
NOTE 1: The UICC refers to either a physically distinct module, or to an
embedded eUICC (e..g as defined in [62], [63]).
### 13.2.1 The UICC and Applications other than the USIM or ISIM
It shall be possible for the UICC to host other applications in addition to
the USIM or ISIM, see figure 3. Service providers, subscribers or users may
need to establish additional data or processes on the UICC. Each application
on an UICC shall reside in its own domain (physical or logical). It shall be
possible to manage each application on the card separately. The security and
operation of an application in any domain shall not be compromised by an
application running in a different domain. Applications may need to use their
own security mechanisms which are separate to those specified by 3GPP e.g.
electronic commerce applications.
Examples of UICC applications are: USIM, ISIM, off-line user applications like
UPT, electronic banking, credit service, etc.
Applications should be able to share some information such as a common address
book.
It shall be possible to address applications, which reside on the UICC, via
the radio interface.
Figure 3: Example of a Multifunction UICC
### 13.2.1a UICC applications and IMS
UICC applications may make use of IMS functionalities controlled by ME.
NOTE: This is to allow a UICC application to interact with an Application
Server (AS) through IMS. Examples of UICC applications include identity
management, banking applications, etc.
### 13.2.2 Fast Access and Retrieval of Data from UICC
An optional \"high speed\" interface may be provided between the UICC and the
ME.
If provided, this interface shall allow fast access and retrieval of data to
support functionalities requiring large amounts of data to be transferred to
and from the UICC. Examples include:
\- on-card web servers
\- rapid access to data stored on the UICC, e.g. phone book, PLMN lists or
user data
A UICC/ME interface supporting this \"high speed\" interface shall be backward
compatible with the TS 102 221 interface specified in 3GPP TS 31.101 [36].
## 13.3 Terminals and Multiple UICCs
A single terminal may support the use of multiple UICC (e.g. with applications
like USIM and/or banking, credit card,...). Only one UICC shall be active at a
time to access a PLMN. In case the active UICC contains more than one USIM,
the requirements of 13.1.4 shall apply.
If the UICC with the active USIM is removed from the mobile terminal during a
call (except for emergency calls), the call shall be terminated immediately.
If the UICC with an active ISIM is removed during an IMS session the IMS
session shall be terminated.
## 13.4 Multiple USIMs
With the growing demand in the consumer market, some commercially deployed UEs
support more than one USIM (typically two). With support of MUSIM UEs in the
3GPP system, the system performance and user experiences are expected to be
improved.
The 3GPP system shall support ME with multiple USIMs (on the same UICC or on
different UICCs) that are registered at the same time.
The 3GPP system shall treat each registration from the USIMs of a MUSIM UE
independently. Each registered USIM in a MUSIM UE shall be associated with a
dedicated IMEI/PEI.
# 14 Types of features of UEs
3GPP specifications should support a wide variety of user equipment, i.e.
setting any limitations on terminals should be avoided as much as possible.
For example user equipment like hand-portable phones, personal digital
assistants and laptop computers can clearly be seen as likely terminals.
In order not to limit the possible types of user equipment they are not
standardised. The UE types could be categorised by their service capabilities
rather than by their physical characteristics. Typical examples are speech
only UE, narrowband data UE, wideband data UE, data and speech UE, etc.
In order to enhance functionality split and modularity inside the user
equipment the interfaces of UE should be identified. Interfaces like UICC-
interface, PCMCIA-interface and other PC-interfaces, including software
interfaces, should be covered by references to the applicable interface
standards.
UEs have to be capable of supporting a wide variety of teleservices,
multimedia services and applications provided in PLMN environment. Limitations
may exist on UEs capability to support all possible teleservices, multimedia
services and information types (speech, narrowband data, wideband data, video,
etc.) and therefore functionality to indicate capabilities of a UE shall be
specified.
The basic mandatory UE requirements are:
\- Support for USIM. Optional support of GSM phase 2, 2+, 3GPP Release 99 and
Release 4 SIM cards [34]. Phase 1, 5V SIM cards shall not be supported.
Support for the SIM/ISIM is optional for the UE, however, if it is supported,
the mandatory requirements for SIM/ISIM shall be supported in the UE;
Note 1: There is no Release 5 specification for the SIM, and therefore
references to \"SIM\" apply to earlier releases.
Note 2: It is strongly recommended that manufacturers implement SIM support on
terminals supporting GERAN until the population of SIMs in the market is
reduced to a low level.
\- Home environment and serving network registration and deregistration;
\- Location update;
\- Originating or receiving a connection oriented or a connectionless service;
\- An unalterable equipment identification; IMEI, see 3GPP TS 22.016 [12];
\- Basic identification of the terminal capabilities related to services such
as; the support for software downloading, application execution
environment/interface, MExE terminal class, supported bearer services.
\- Terminals capable for emergency calls shall support emergency call without
a SIM/USIM/ISIM.
\- Support for the execution of algorithms required for encryption, for CS and
PS services. Support for non encrypted mode is required;
\- Support for the method of handling automatic calling repeat attempt
restrictions as specified in 3GPP TS 22.001 [4];
\- At least one capability type shall be standardised for mobile terminals
supporting the GERAN,UTRAN and E-UTRAN radio interfaces.
\- Under emergency situations, it may be desirable for the operator to prevent
UE users from making access attempts (including emergency call attempts) or
responding to pages in specified areas of a network, see 3GPP TS 22.011 [11];
\- Ciphering Indicator for terminals with a suitable display;
\- The ciphering indicator feature allows the UE to detect that the 3GPP radio
interface ciphering (user plane) is not switched on and to indicate this to
the user. The ciphering indicator feature may be disabled by the home network
operator setting data in the SIM/USIM. The default terminal behaviour shall be
to take into account the operator setting data in the SIM/USIM. However,
terminals with a user interface that can allow it, shall offer the possibility
for the user to configure the terminal to ignore the operator setting data in
the SIM/USIM. If this feature is not disabled by the SIM/USIM or if the
terminal has been configured to ignore the operator setting data in the
SIM/USIM, then whenever a user plane connection is in place, which is, or
becomes un-enciphered, an indication shall be given to the user. In addition,
if this feature is not disabled by the SIM/USIM or if the terminal has been
configured to ignore the operator setting data in the SIM/USIM, then
additional information may also be provided about the status of the ciphering.
Ciphering itself is unaffected by this feature, and the user can choose how to
proceed;
\- Support for PLMN selection.
\- Support for handling of interactions between toolkits concerning the access
to UE MMI input/output capabilities;
\- Whenever an application (e.g. a SAT/MExE/WAP application) requires the
access to the UE MMI input/output capabilities (e.g. display, keyboard,... ),
the UE shall grant this access subject to the capabilities of the UE. This
shall not cause the termination of any other applications (e.g. WAP browser or
MExE/SAT application) which were previously using these UE resources. The UE
shall give the user the ability to accept or reject the new application. In
the case that the application request is rejected, the access to the UE MMI
input/output capabilities is returned to the applications which were
previously using these UE resources. If the user decides to continue with the
new application, then when this new application is terminated, the access to
the UE MMI input/output capabilities shall be returned to the UE to be re-
allocated to applications (e.g. the preceding application which was
interrupted). Subject to the capabilities of the UE, the user shall have the
ability to switch the MMI input/output capabilities between applications.
NOTE: Rejecting a request to access the UE MMI input/output capabilities by an
application does not necessarily mean that it is terminated, but only that the
access to the UE MMI input/output capabilities are not granted to this
application. Handling of rejection (termination, put on hold,...) is the
responsibility of the application.
Annex A describes a number of features which may optionally be supported by
the UE.
# 15 Relationship between subscription and service delivery
## 15.1 Subscription
A subscription describes the commercial relationship between the subscriber
and the service provider.
Figure 4: Subscriber, subscription and services relationship
A subscription to a network operator may provide the user with access to one
or more domains. A Subscription shall identify the set of services, within
particular domains, to which the user has access (see figure 3); each
subscription may specify a different set of services. These services may be
provided by the CS CN Domain and/or a PS CN Domain and/or an IM CN subsystem.
Subscriptions relate to services such as Basic Services (e.g. Teleservices,
Bearer services), PS services and IM-Services (IP-based multimedia services),
which are typically provided by network operators, and to value added services
which typically are provided by network operators and/or other entities that
provide services to a subscriber
The subscription identifies:
\- the services and related services information that are made available to
the subscriber by the service provider;
In addition, a subscription to a network operator may identify:
\- the domains to which the user has been granted access by the network
operator. In particular, the PS service profile and information on the allowed
QoS parameter ranges shall be contained in the subscription.
\- the identity of the subscriber within these domains.\ NOTE: The identity of
a subscriber in the CS CN domain and PS CN domain (e.g. her IMSI) may
potentially be different to her identity in the IM CN subsystem
\- the radio access systems over which the subscriber may access their
services e.g. UTRAN, GERAN, EUTRAN, I-WLAN.
## 15.2 Other concepts associated with services
**Provision of services:** \ An action to make a service available to a
subscriber. The provision may be:
  * general: where the service is made available to all subscribers (subject to compatibility restrictions enforced) without prior arrangements being made with the service provider;
  * preâ€‘arranged: where the service is made available to an individual subscriber only after the necessary arrangements have been made with the service provider.
**Withdrawal:\** An action taken by the service provider to remove an
available service from a subscriber\'s access. The withdrawal may be:
  * general: where the service is removed from all subscribers provided with the service;
  * specific: where the service is removed on an individual basis from subscribers provided with the service.
NOTE: Access to the IM subsystem requires IP connectivity provided, for
example, through provision of the PS CN domain.
## 15.3 Requirements concerning service delivery
In general, it is a requirement to allow the use of independent services
simultaneously (i.e. Basic, PS, IP multimedia and operator specific).
1) The network usage shall be based on the services identified within the
subscription, the terminal capabilities and, where applicable, roaming
agreements between operators.
2) The Home environment shall be able to decide on the service delivery in a
roaming scenario. I.e. it shall control how services are delivered in line
with the subscription.
3) If an offered or required service (e.g. voice) could be provided with
different technologies within the serving network, the decision on service
delivery shall be based on preferences identified in the user profile and
serving network capabilities and conditions (e.g. load).
4) If the user profile does not allow an alternative service delivery method
and the requested delivery method is not available in the serving network the
service shall not be provided to the subscriber. This applies also to data
bearer services with defined QoS parameters (or parameter ranges).
Examples:
\- A terminating voice call for a subscriber with a dual/multi mode terminal
(e.g. UTRAN/GERAN) could be delivered in a hybrid network as IM service or CS
voice call (TS11). The delivery decision is based on the preferences of
service delivery within the user profile and the network conditions. If there
is no preference information of the Home environment available the decision is
made only on the network conditions from the serving network.
\- A terminating data service (e.g. PS with QoS for real time audio) where the
network cannot provide the QoS at call setup. Both the originating and
terminating application shall be informed about the possible QoS configuration
for that call. The further handling (setup continuation, termination) depends
on the decisions of the applications.
### 15.3.1 Mobile Originated Voice calls
When a ME capable of offering voice service both on CS and IMS is CS attached
and IMS registered MO CS Voice calls (TS11) and MO IMS voice services shall be
originated on the domain specified by the Home operator policy or users
preferences. The Home Operator policy shall have precedence to user
preferences.
### 15.3.2 Mobile Terminated Voice calls
When a ME capable of offering voice service both on CS and IMS, MT CS Voice
calls (TS11) and MT IMS voice services shall be delivered over the domain
specified by the Home operator policy or users preferences. The Home Operator
policy shall have precedence to user preferences. If the call delivery attempt
fails in one domain, if specified by operator policy, it should be possible to
attempt the delivery in the other domain or the call/communication forwarding
supplementary services [41, 40] may be invoked if provisioned.
NOTE 1: The delivery decision will take into account aspects such as IMS
registration and CS attachment status.
NOTE 2: When the terminating network knows that the UE is either IMS
registered or CS attached in non-3GPP access (e.g. CDMA), the delivery
decision will take this into account in order to select the correct domain.
# 16 Charging principles
The cost of the call may cover the cost of sending, transporting, delivery and
storage. The cost of call related signalling may also be included. Provision
shall be made for charging based on time, destination, location, volume,
bandwidth, access technology and quality. Charges may also be levied as a
result of the use of value-added services.
It shall be possible for information relating to chargeable events to be made
available to the home environment at short notice. The requirements shall
include:
\- Immediately after a chargeable event is completed;
\- At regular intervals of time, volume or charge during a chargeable event.
  1. \- Delivery of the location of the terminal to the home environment, > e.g. cell identification;
Standardised mechanisms of transferring charging information are required to
make these requirements possible.
It should be possible for multiple leg calls (e.g. forwarded, conference or
roamed) to be charged to each party as if each leg was separately initiated.
However, in certain types of call, the originating party may wish/be obliged
to pay for other legs (e.g. SMS MO may also pay for the MT leg.).
It shall be possible to charge according to the location (e.g. cell, or zone)
and access technology that are being used to access network services.
Provision shall be made for the chargeable party to be changed during the life
of the call. There shall be a flexible billing mechanism which may include the
use of stored value cards, credit cards or similar devices.
The chargeable party (normally the calling party) shall be provided with an
indication of the charges to be levied (e.g. via the called number
automatically or the Advice of Charge supplementary service) for the duration
of the call (even though the user may change service environment)The user
shall be able to make decisions about the acceptable level of accumulated
charge dynamically or through their service profile.
If a user is to be charged for accepting a call then their consent should be
obtained. This may be done dynamically or through their service profile.
Charging and accounting solutions shall support the shared network
architecture so that end users can be appropriately charged for their usage of
the shared network, and network sharing partners can be allocated their share
of the costs of the shared network resources.
# 17 Roaming
## 17.1 Assumptions
In order to roam, the following applies:
\- Mobile terminal can connect to the radio access network.
\- Authentication (charging/billing network) must occur in order to get access
to services (except for emergency calls).
\- The services offered to a roaming subscriber may be restricted by the
capabilities of the visited network, and the roaming agreement between the
visited and the home environment.
## 17.2 Principle
Long term evolution of the IM CN subsystem shall not be restricted by the
short/mid-term inter-domain roaming requirements.
## 17.3 Requirements
Figure 5: Roaming requirements
\- The personalised services & capabilities available in a visited network are
dependent upon the subscription options in the home environment. This does not
preclude the visited network offering additional services, or access to
content providers.
\- Roaming from this release\'s home environment to CS (this release or
earlier) visited network is required
\- Roaming from this release\'s home environment to IM CN subsystem visited
network is required
\- Roaming from this release\'s home environment to PS (this release or
earlier) visited network is required
\- Roaming from previous releases\' home environment (or earlier) to this
release CS visited network is required
\- Roaming from previous releases\' home environment (or earlier) to this
release PS visited network is required
NOTE: When an operator allows a subscriber to roam to different domains, the
home environment needs to provide subscription data to the visited network .
The mapping between service data of the different domains is not standardised;
it is determined by the home environment and may be influenced by roaming
agreements.
# 18 Handover Requirements
Any handover required to maintain an active service while a user is mobile
within the coverage area of a given network, shall be seamless from the
user\'s perspective. However handovers that occur between different radio
environments may result in a change of the quality of service experienced by
the user.
It shall be possible for users to be handed over between different networks
subject to appropriate roaming/commercial agreements.
For further information see 3GPP TS 22.129 [9].
# 19 Network Selection
Network selection procedures are defined in 3GPP TS 22.011 [11].
Other procedures may be offered by the UE.
# 20 Security
Security matters are considered in 3GPP TS 21.133 [15] and 3GPP TS 33.120
[16].
# 21 Voice Call Continuity
## 21.1 General
The 3GPP system shall be able to provide continuity between CS voice services
(Teleservice 11[14]) and the full duplex speech component of IMS multimedia
telephony service [40] with no negative impact upon the user\'s experience of
the voice service. This functionality is known as voice call continuity. Voice
call continuity shall be executed when continuation of a voice service is
required based on operator policy across a change in the connection of the UE
to the 3GPP system as the user moves from using the CS domain to using IMS and
vice versa.
The user experience shall be unaffected by the transition from a CS voice
service to a full duplex speech component of IMS multimedia telephony and vice
versa, and the user shall experience no disruption in the voice service
provided. The voice service is continued with the same ME.
It shall be possible to support Voice call continuity between IMS and the CS
domain belonging to different operators; i.e., when the user\'s IMS services
are under the control of the home IMS and the user is roaming in the coverage
of the visited CS network.
It shall be possible for an operator to enable or disable Voice call
continuity for a given subscriber e.g. based on roaming conditions, terminal
capabilities.
## 21.2 Support of Supplementary Services
The voice call continuity user\'s experience shall be such that, to the
greatest degree possible, a consistency of service is provided regardless of
the underlying communication infrastructure and technology. With regard to
supplementary services, the general principle is that CS-based supplementary
services only apply whilst a VCC subscriber is in the CS domain and equivalent
services over IMS only apply whilst a VCC subscriber is in the IMS domain,
although there are exceptions listed below. It is not required to synchronise
the supplementary service settings of the CS domain with the related service
settings of the IMS (e.g. different forwarding numbers may apply over CS and
over IMS).
The following supplementary services apply. The impact on the supplementary
services in case the VCC is executed for the calling party, the called party,
or both is described below.
### 21.2.1 Line Identification Services
A user who has subscribed to the CLIP Supplementary Service and receives a
call shall also receive the line identity or appropriate IMS information of
the calling party.
The identity presentation is not changed for the duration of the call
regardless of whether the call undergoes VCC.
If the CLIR Supplementary Service or IMS identity restriction is applicable to
the call, then at call setup time the called user shall receive an indication
that the identity is not available because of restriction.
The indication is not changed for the duration of the call regardless of
whether the call undergoes VCC.
If COLP or a corresponding IMS service is applicable to a call the calling
subscriber shall receive the connected line identity or appropriate IMS
information at call setup time.
The identity presentation is not changed for the duration of the call
regardless of whether the call undergoes VCC.
If the COLR Supplementary Service or IMS identity restriction is applicable to
the call, then the calling user shall receive an indication at call setup time
that the identity of the connected party is not available because of
restriction.
The indication is not changed for the duration of the call regardless of
whether the call undergoes VCC.
### 21.2.2 All Call Forwardings
It shall be possible to perform VCC on a call which was forwarded due to call
forwarding supplementary services in the CS or redirecting services in the
IMS.
### 21.2.3 Call Waiting
The functionality of call waiting supplementary service in the CS domain shall
not be affected by the user\'s ability to undergo VCC.
NOTE: Whether the user will continue to receive call waiting notifications in
the case their call is continued in the IMS will depend on whether a call
waiting service is available in the IMS.
### 21.2.4 Call Hold
It shall be possible to re-establish a call which has been put on hold before
undergoing VCC, after the VCC has been performed.
### 21.2.5 Multiparty
It shall be possible for any party in a multiparty call to undergo VCC and to
stay in the call. It shall be possible to terminate the entire multiparty call
when the served mobile subscriber releases even if she is connected via the
IMS after undergoing VCC.
### 21.2.6 All Call Barrings
If a call were to undergo VCC and that would result in the call being barred
in the target domain/system, it shall be up to the home operator policy
whether the call continues in the target domain/system, the call terminates,
or VCC is not executed for the call.
### 21.2.7 Void
### 21.2.8 Void
### 21.2.9 All other Supplementary Services
Other supplementary services are not discussed in this section as they do not
apply to calls in progress (i.e. they apply to call set up only) or their
support and/or the need for standardised implementation has not been
identified as critical for VCC in this Release.
## 21.3 Quality of Service
Voice call continuity shall not adversely impact the quality of the voice
service experienced by the user.
## 21.4 Security
Voice call continuity shall not adversely impact the security of the 3GPP
system.
Security mechanisms of the 3GPP system shall be reused for voice call
continuity.
## 21.5 Emergency calls
Voice call continuity for emergency calls shall be applicable to dual radio
and single radio UEs.
Voice call continuity of emergency calls shall only be performed when all the
following conditions are met:
\- the source network is IMS;
\- the target network supports emergency calls;
\- the user is moving out of coverage;
\- the source and target network belong to the same operator;
\- the target network supports voice call continuity.
## 21.6 Charging
It shall be possible to indicate in the charging information that a VCC event
has occurred (e.g., so that appropriate ratings can be applied for the CS and
IMS parts of the continued voice call).
## 21.7 VCC Activation
It shall be possible to activate VCC based on operator policies, taking into
account any of the following:
\- Radio conditions e.g. radio quality thresholds and related hysteresis
\- Coverage availability e.g.: Always prefer I-WLAN, if certain SSID are
available
# 22 IMS Centralized Services
## 22.1 General
The ICS user shall receive both registered and unregistered services in a
consistent manner when the user accesses IMS either via the CS or the PS
domain (both of which can be supported by 3GPP access networks or nonâ€‘3GPP
access networks). Support of UEs enhanced with ICS capability as well as UEs
without ICS capability shall be possible.
NOTE: The impacts to support non-3GPP CS domains to support of ICS are outside
the scope of 3GPP.
## 22.2 Service Consistency
Subscribers shall have a consistent user experience regardless of the domain
used, subject to the constraints of the UE and access network.
## 22.3 Service Continuity
ICS shall support service continuity between CS and PS domains (both of which
can be supported by 3GPP access networks or nonâ€‘3GPP access networks), subject
to the constraints of the UE and access networks.
Note : The impacts to support non 3GPP CS domains are outside the scope of
3GPP.
The service continuity shall include:
\- Basic services
\- Non mid-call services
\- Mid-call services
The support of service continuity for fax and data (CS) media components is
not required.
## 22.4 IMS Services
The set of IMS services supported by ICS shall include at least the following,
subject to the constraints of the UE and access networks:
\- IMS Multimedia Telephony services, including:
\- speech,
\- video,
\- fax,
\- data (CS),
\- Supplementary services defined within [40]; and
\- Multimedia priority service.
\- IMS emergency calls, including eCall.
NOTE: Other IMS hosted services supported by an operator or 3rd party may be
supported.
## 22.5 Roaming Support
An ICS user shall be able to receive full ICS support from the HPLMN while
roaming in the VPLMN, subject to the constraints of the VPLMN (e.g. roaming
agreements, operator policies).
The Home operator shall be able to control if the UE enhanced with ICS
capability shall act without ICS capability while roaming.
# 23 CS IP interconnection requirements
## 23.1 Introduction
CS IP interconnect represents the interconnection of MSC Server functionality
between 2 CS networks over an underlying IP infrastructure.
## 23.2 IP interconnect
The IP connection used for CS IP interconnect shall be generic such that it
can support all combinations of core network interconnection. E.g. the IP
interconnection shall be shared between the IMS interconnection and the CS IP
interconnection.
It shall be possible to handle the inter-connection of all services over this
generic IP interface. The handling of security and charging shall also be
generic for all IP interconnect scenarios.
## 23.3 MSC server interconnect
The following requirements apply at the interconnection point when two PLMNs
are interconnected by means of IP transport technology for 2G and 3G CS
services.
The system shall support the capability for CS service interoperability and
interworking.
It shall be possible to apply operator defined policy at the interconnection
point.
The system shall support the capability to control the session resources when
two different network domains are connected that may have, for example,
different IP addressing schemes.
The system shall support IP inter-connection between core networks either by
direct connection or by using an intermediate carrier (e.g. GSMA IPX [43]).
The system shall support both bilateral interconnection between two carriers
and multilateral interconnection (e.g. GSMA IPX [43]) by means of intermediate
carrier.
The system shall support either
\- transparent relay of the IP signalling and traffic;
\- service aware interconnection
The system shall support codec negotiation across one or multiple
interconnects to minimise transcoding (and preferably eliminate it) to provide
the highest quality service to the user.
# 24 Service Alignment & Migration
## 24.1 Introduction
Services can be offered to the users via different service domains, e.g.
certain teleservices and supplementary services via CS or Multimedia Telephony
and supplementary services via IMS. Especially for the supplementary services
given below a strong relationship exists from the user\'s point of view.
Therefore means shall be provided to enable a consistent user experience when
changing from one service domain to the other.
The requirements in this clause are applicable during the migration to an ICS.
The ability to synchronise the service settings will facilitate the migration
from a CS to an IMS based network and will allow network operators maximum
flexibility in their migration strategies.
## 24.2 Alignment of supplementary services settings
Based on user preferences and if provisioned by the home operator the network
shall automatically synchronise the parameter settings of the supplementary
services listed in the following table:
Table 24.2-1: Alignment of supplementary services settings
* * *
CS Voice (TS11) Supplementary Services Equivalent Multimedia Telephony
Services in IMS domain Service Behaviour Required CLIP/CLIR OIP/OIR
Consistency of presentation CoLP/CoLR TIP/TIR Consistency of presentation CNAP
OIP/OIR Consistency of presentation Call Forwarding CDIV Call forwarding/CDIV
shall work consistently no matter which domain the user is in. The settings
(e.g. forwarding numbers) shall remain the same across domains for all the
parts of the service for which there is an equivalent. Call Waiting
Communication Waiting The busy state of the user shall be available to both
domains so that this can be applied no matter from which domain an incoming
call/communication originates. The activation status of Call Waiting and
Communication Waiting shall be synchronised. Call Hold Communication HOLD Any
calls held in one domain shall remain held on moving to a different domain. It
shall be possible to re-establish a call that was put on hold in another
domain. Multiparty CONF Any conference (multiparty) calls set up in one domain
shall remain in force if any user moves to another domain. Closed User Group
Closed User Group Consistency required across domains CCBS CCBS Consistency
required across domains Call Deflection Defined in CDIV Consistency required
across domains Explicit Call Transfer ECommT Consistency required across
domains. The UE state (i.e. if busy or not) shall be available in both domains
to ensure that this can be applied consistently. Call Barring Communication
Barring Call/ Communication Barring shall work consistently no matter which
domain the user is in. The settings (i.e. barred numbers) shall remain the
same across domains. AoC AoC Consistent support across domains. If the user
moves from one domain to the other during the communication, the AoC shall
indicate the correct charge for the total duration of the communication.
* * *
The operator shall be able to provision the user with the possibility to
define which of the above settings shall be synchronised automatically and
which settings can exist independently of each other. E.g. a user might decide
that the activation status of CLIP/OIP, CLIR/OIR, Call Waiting/Communication
Waiting etc. is synchronised but that the call forwarding status and
forwarded-to-number is different from the communication diversion settings and
the diverted-to-party address.
If the synchronisation of supplementary services, which use the UE\'s busy
state for invocation, is activated the busy state of the UE shall be available
in both domains.
NOTE: The \"user not reachable\" or \"user not logged in\" conditions in the
different domains are independent of each other. This means, e.g. not being
registered in the IMS does not affect the invocation of CFNRc in the CS
domain.
Synchronisation of settings means that the most recent changes which have been
applied in one domain are propagated to the other domain.
There are certain circumstances under which the synchronisation will fail e.g.
when a user inserts a SIP URI as diverted-to-party address in the IMS domain
which has no Tel URI associated with it. In such a case there is no valid
setting for the CS domain for this particular parameter and therefore the CS
domain service setting shall remain unchanged. The user may receive a
notification about the failure of the synchronisation procedure and its cause.
# 25 System optimisation for communication with specific characteristics
## 25.1 Void
## 25.2 Numbering Resource Efficiency
The following optional requirement is intended to provide better numbering
resource efficiency for UEs that only require packet switched services.
\- A network operator shall be able to provide PS only subscriptions with or
without assigning an MSISDN.
\- Remote triggering shall be supported with or without assigning an MSISDN.
\- Remote UE configuration shall be supported without the use of an MSISDN.
Note 1: Current remote UE configuration solutions (i.e. Device Management and
Over-the-Air configuration) are mainly based on SMS, which assumes the use of
MSISDNs.
Note 2: The requirements in this sub-clause apply to server-to-UE
communication scenarios only.
## 25.3 Network provided destination for uplink data
The Network Provided Destination for Uplink Data feature is intended for use
when all data from a UE is to be directed to a network provided destination
address.
\- For uplink data communication, the network shall be able to direct all
uplink PS data traffic to a network provided destination address.
NOTE: This feature may be used, for example, when all data from an electricity
meter is sent to a server maintained by the network operator.
## 25.4 PS only subscriptions
The system shall support subscriptions that only allow packet-based services
and SMS.
# 26 Single Sign-On (SSO) Service
## 26.1 Requirements
### 26.1.1 Requirements for the UE

The 3GPP SSO Service shall provide secure, seamless and transparent access to
data applications for users of the SSO Service independent of the access
network technology.
The 3GPP SSO Service **shall be able to interwork with Identity Management
(IdM) specifications (e.g., OpenID [51]).**
The 3GPP SSO Service shall support 3GPP SSO Authentication based on Operator-
controlled credentials and policies.
The 3GPP SSO Service may support negotiation and use of an agreed
authentication method between the UE and the 3GPP SSO Identity Provider. The
negotiation of an authentication method may be repeated each time the user
accesses a DAP\'s service.
The 3GPP SSO Service may support mechanisms to ensure the presence of the
registered user of the data application to satisfy policies of the Data
Application Provider.
The 3GPP SSO Service shall be transparent from a user perspective when
transitions occur between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, whether or not the
transition occurs during a data application session.
The 3GPP SSO Service shall be transparent from a user perspective when the
user accesses a data application using an identity created through a 3rd Party
SSO Identity Provider. The user shall be able to configure which 3rd party SSO
identities are used with the 3GPP SSO Service.
# 26a User Identity
## 26a.1 Introduction
Identifying distinguished user identities of the user (provided by some
external party or by the operator) in the operator network enables an operator
to provide an enhanced user experience and optimized performance as well as to
offer services to devices that are not part of a 3GPP network. The user to be
identified could be an individual human user, using a UE with a certain
subscription, or an application running on or connecting via a UE, or a device
("thing") behind a gateway UE.
Network settings can be adapted and services offered to users according to
their needs, independent of the subscription that is used to establish the
connection. By acting as an identity provider, the operator can take
additional information from the network into account to provide a higher level
of security for the authentication of a user.
NOTE: The basic concept and relations of user identity management is described
in TR 22.904 [61].
## 26a.2 Requirements
### 26a.2.1 User Identifiers and user authentication
The 3GPP system shall be able to provide User Identities with related User
Identifiers for a user.
The User Identifier shall be independent of existing identifiers relating to
subscription or device (e.g. IMSI, MSISDN, IMPI, IMPU, SUPI, GPSI, IMEI) and
of other User Identifiers.
The User Identifier may be provided by some entity within the operator's
network or by a 3rd party.
The 3GPP system shall support to interwork with a 3rd party network entity for
authentication of the User Identity.
The 3GPP system shall support to perform authentication of a User Identity
regardless of the user\'s access, the user\'s UE and its HPLMN as well as the
provider of the User Identifier.
The 3GPP network shall be able to provide a User Identifier for a non-3GPP
device that is connected to the network via a UE that acts as a gateway.
The 3GPP network shall support to perform authentication of a User Identity
used by devices that are connected via a UE that acts as a gateway.
The 3GPP system shall be able to take User Identity specific service settings
and parameters into account when delivering a service.
A subscriber shall be able to link and unlink one or more user Identities with
his 3GPP subscription.
The 3GPP system shall support user authentication with User Identifiers from
devices that connect via the internet; the 3GPP system shall support secure
provisioning of credentials to those devices to enable them to access the
network and its services according to the 3GPP subscription that has been
linked with the User Identity.
The 3GPP system shall support secure provisioning of credentials to a non-3GPP
device connected via a gateway UE, whose User Identifier has been linked with
the 3GPP subscription of the gateway UE, to enable the non-3GPP device to
access the network and its services according to the linked 3GPP subscription
when connected via non-3GPP access.
The 3GPP system shall be able to assess the level of confidence in the User
Identity by taking into account information regarding the used mechanism for
obtaining that User Identity (e.g. algorithms, key-length, time since last
authentication), information from the network (e.g. UE or device in use,
access technology, location).
The operator and the subscriber shall be able to restrict the number of
simultaneously active User Identifiers per UE.
### 26a.2.2 Access to services
The 3GPP System shall support to authenticate a User Identity to a service
with a User Identifier.
NOTE: The requirement applies to 3GPP services and non-3GPP services that are
accessed via the 3GPP System
The 3GPP system shall be able to provide information to services concerning
the level of confidence of the User Identity and authentication process.
A service shall be able to request the 3GPP network to only authenticate users
to the service for which the association of the user with a User Identifier
has been established according to specified authentication policies of the
service.
When a user requests to access a service the 3GPP System shall support
authentication of the User Identity with a User Identifier towards the service
if the level of confidence for the correct association of a User Identity with
a User Identifier complies to specified policies of the service.
The 3GPP network shall be able to take the User Profile into account when
assigning a UE to a network slice, moving a UE from one network slice to
another, and removing a UE from a network slice.
The 3GPP system shall support to [ ]{.underline} allow a UE access to a slice
based on successful User Identity authentication.
The 3GPP system shall support to deny a UE access to a slice based on
unsuccessful User Identity authentication.
### 26a.2.3 User Identity Profile and its User Identities
The 3GPP system shall be able to store and update a User Profile for a user.
The User Profile shall include a User Identifier.
The User Profile may include one or more pieces of the following information:
\- additional User Identifiers of the user\'s User Identities and potentially
linked 3GPP subscriptions,
\- used UEs (identified by their subscription and device identifiers),
\- capabilities the used UEs support for authentication,
\- information regarding authentication policies required by different
services and slices to authenticate a user for access to these services or
slices.
\- User Identity specific service settings and parameters.\ Those shall
include network parameters (e.g. QoS parameters), IMS service (e.g. MMTEL
supplementary services) and operator deployed service chain settings.
\- User Identity specific network resources (e.g., network slice).
The user shall be able to activate, deactivate and suspend, i.e. temporarily
deactivate, the use of the User Identifiers per device or UE and the
associated settings in its user profile.
Note 1: Suspending (temporarily deactivating) a User Identifier on a UE could
also be automatically performed by the device on behalf of the user after a
period of inactivity of the user at that device. The time period of inactivity
of the user at that device after which a device should suspend a User
Identifier may depend on home operator policy.
Note 2: Re-activation of a suspended User Identifier on a UE where it was
suspended could involve simplified authentication (e.g. using fingerprint) at
the device.
Subject to operator policy the 3GPP system shall be able to update User
Profile related to a User Identifier, according to the information shared by a
trusted 3^rd^ party.
### 26a.2.4 Operator requirements
The operator shall be able to enable or disable the use of a User Identifier
in his network.
The 3GPP System shall support operators to act as User Identity provider and
to authenticate users for accessing operator and non-operator deployed (i.e.
external non-3GPP) services
The operator shall be able to set the boundaries within which the user
specific settings are taken into account in his network. The operator shall be
able to restrict the feature depending of the provider of the User Identifier,
the roaming status of the UE, the service and its specific parameters.
The operator shall be able to set restrictions for devices accessing the
network and its services via non-3GPP access with their User Identity linked
to a 3GPP subscription. The 3GPP system shall support restrictions based on
the User Identity provider, the roaming status of the linked 3GPP
subscription, and the network service that is accessed.
The 3GPP system shall be able to support automatically suspending an active
User Identity after a certain period of time of user inactivity, e.g. up to
one hour, as configured by the operator.
The 3GPP system shall be able to support a fast re-activation for a suspended
User Identity, based on MNOs' configuration.
The 3GPP system shall enable a user to configure, within the boundaries set by
the network operator, which services shall be available on a device where a
user logs in. These services include voice, video, and messaging.
### 26a.2.5 Privacy requirements
The 3GPP system shall protect the privacy of the user by transferring to a
service only User Identity information that is necessary to provide the
service and for which the user has consented to when registering for the
service.
# 27 User plane congestion management
## 27.1 Introduction
RAN user plane congestion, in the context of this clause, is considered to be
downlink congestion that affects the user plane, which may last for a few
seconds, a few minutes, or a few hours due to arrival of new active users,
increase of communication intensity of existing users, the radio environment
changing, the mobile user changing location, and other reasons, thus causing
the capacity of RAN resources to transfer user data to be exceeded. A short-
duration burst of user plane traffic should not be identified as RAN
congestion.
## 27.2 General
a) The network shall be able to detect RAN user plane congestion onset and
abatement. Mechanisms to cope with RAN user plane congestions should be
resilient to rapid changes in the level of congestion.
b) The network shall be able to identify whether or not an active UE is in a
RAN user plane congested cell.
c) The network operator shall be able to configure or provision and enforce
policy rules to best deal with RAN user plane congestion.
d) The system should react in a timely manner to manage a RAN user plane
congestion situation, i.e. that the measures taken become effective to
promptly help resolve the RAN user plane congestion.
e) The signalling overhead caused by RAN user plane congestion management
solutions in the system shall be minimized.
f) The network shall be able to take into consideration the RAN user plane
congestion status and the subscriber\'s profile when coping with traffic
congestion.
## 27.3 Prioritizing traffic
a) According to operator policy, during RAN user plane congestion the operator
shall be able to select the communications which require preferential
treatment and allocate sufficient resources for such communications in order
to provide these services with appropriate service quality.
b) According to operator policy, the network shall be able to select specific
users (e.g. heavy users, roaming users, etc.) and adjust the QoS of existing
connections/flows and apply relevant policies to new connections/flows
depending on the RAN user plane congestion status and the subscriber\'s
profile.
Note 1: Preferably, connections/flows need to be adjusted such that the user
experience is not negatively affected.
## 27.4 Reducing traffic
a) Based on RAN congestion status and according to operator policy, the
network shall be able to reduce the user plane traffic load (e.g. by
compressing images or by adaptation for streaming applications) taking into
account UE related information (e.g. UE capabilities, subscription).
b) The system shall be able to adjust the communication media parameters of
real-time communications so that they consume less bandwidth.
## 27.5 Void
# 28 RAN Sharing Enhancements
## 28.1 General
RAN Sharing Enhancements allow multiple Participating Operators to share the
resources of a single RAN according to agreed allocation schemes. The Shared
RAN is provided by a Hosting RAN Operator which can be one of the
Participating Operators.
The Shared RAN can be GERAN, UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN as described below.
All the following requirements shall be subject to Hosting RAN Operator
configuration.
## 28.2 Specific E-UTRAN and NG-RAN Sharing requirements
### 28.2.1 Allocation of Shared E-UTRAN and NG-RAN resources
When E-UTRAN and NG-RAN resources are shared they can be allocated unequally
to the Participating Operators, depending on the planned or current needs of
these operators and based on service agreements with the Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-
RAN Operator.
The following requirements apply:
The Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator shall be able to specify the allocation of
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN resources to each of the Participating Operators by the
following:
a) static allocation, i.e. guaranteeing a minimum allocation and limiting to a
maximum allocation,
b) static allocation for a specified period of time and/or specific
cells/sectors,
c) first UE come first UE served allocation.
d) the type and number of 5G slices
Resources include both user plane and signalling plane. The Hosting
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator needs to be able to manage the sharing of the
signalling traffic independently from that of the user traffic because
signalling traffic and user traffic are not always directly related. For
example for MTC devices, the signalling traffic volume can be high and the
user traffic volume low whereas for downloading video, the signalling traffic
is low and the user traffic is high.
The following requirements apply:
The management and allocation of resources of signalling traffic over the
Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be independent from the management and allocation
of resources of the user traffic over the Shared E-UTRAN.
A Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be capable of differentiating traffic associated
with individual Participating Operators.
A Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be able to conduct admission control based on
the allocated E-UTRAN/NG-RAN resources for each Participating Operator.
A Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator shall be able to control resource usage
taking into account the allocated E-UTRAN/NG-RAN resources for each
Participating Operator. A means of monitoring the usage of resources shall be
provided.
All shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN capabilities offered by the Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN
Operator shall be individually available for use by each Participating
Operator where this is possible.
The 3GPP System shall support a Shared RAN (E-UTRAN or NG-RAN) to cover a
specific coverage area (e.g. from a complete network to a single cell, both
outdoor and indoor).
The 3GPP System shall support service continuity for UEs that are moving
between different Shared RANs or between a Shared RAN and a non-shared RAN.
### 28.2.2 OA&M Access to the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN
Each Participating Operator can have their own OA&M capabilities, which are
used for monitoring and for selected operations in a shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN.
Information exchange involved in those operations need to be controlled by the
Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator as to prevent disclosing them to other
Participating Operators, be it for business, operational, or technical
reasons.
The following requirements apply:
Selected OA&M capabilities for the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN, under the control of
the Hosting E- UTRAN Operator, shall be accessible by the Participating
Operator\'s OA&M functions
This would allow, for example, the Participating Operator to do the following:
\- test of communication path between the Participating Operator\'s network
elements and the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN,
\- obtain fault reports,
\- retrieve RAN resource usage information.
### 28.2.3 Generation and retrieval of usage and accounting information
To facilitate interoperator accounting between Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator
and Participating Operator the Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator needs to record
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN resource usage by UEs of the Participating Operator.
The following requirements apply:
A Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator shall be able to collect events supporting
the accounting of network resource usage separately for each Participating
Operator. Collected events may be delivered to the subscriber\'s Participating
Operator. This includes:
\- start of service in the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN for a UE of the Participating
Operator,
\- end of service in the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN for a UE of the Participating
Operator.
### 28.2.4 MDT Collection
MDT data from a Participating Operator\'s customer UEs allow the Hosting
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator to be provided with performance measurements on his
Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN. The Participating Operator is responsible for obtaining
and retaining any required user consent related to privacy.
The following requirements apply:
When authorized by the Participating Operators, the Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN
Operator shall be able to collect MDT data of the Participating Operator\'s
UEs connected through its E-UTRAN/NG-RAN.
NOTE: This functionality should also allow for the case where the Hosting
E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operator does not have an adjunct core network.
### 28.2.5 PWS support of Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN
A Participating Operator potentially has regulatory obligations to initiate
the broadcast of PWS messages regardless of E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Sharing.
The following requirements apply:
The Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be able to broadcast PWS messages originated
from the core networks of all Participating Operators.
NOTE: Rel-11 design requires a shared PWS core. However, some regulatory
obligations require a solution in which no common PWS core network entity is
involved.
### 28.2.6 Support for load balancing
Hosting E-UTRAN/NG-RAN Operators have the need to optimize E-UTRAN/NG-RAN
resource usage within the shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN for a particular coverage
area. At the same time, the agreed shares of E-UTRAN/NG-RAN resources based on
a single cell and sector for each Participating Operator need to be respected.
Likewise, Participating Operators have the need to optimize their E-UTRAN/NG-
RAN resource usage among shared and unshared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN for a particular
coverage area.
The capability to perform load balancing on an individual Participating
Operator\'s traffic basis within a shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be supported.
The capability to perform load balancing on the combined traffic of all the
Participating Operators within a shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be supported.
The capability to perform load balancing between an individual Participating
Operator\'s traffic within a shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN and traffic in that
Participating Operator\'s unshared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN where the shared and
unshared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN coverage overlaps shall be supported.
NOTE: Load balancing capabilities are expected to take into account the
allocation of resources to each Participating Operator and the load level for
each Participating Operator to the extent possible, so that the principal
objective to maximize throughput is not impacted.
If load balancing in a Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN is supported and if a
Participating Operator's EPC indicates overload to the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN
in order to mitigate the overload situation then overload mitigation measures
shall have minimal impact on the communication between the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-
RAN and other Participating Operators EPCs.
### 28.2.7 Dynamic capacity negotiation
In situations where a need for additional, unplanned, E-UTRAN/NG-RAN capacity
by a Participating Operator arises (e.g. in the case of big mass-events) the
Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN can provide means to allocate available spare capacity
to the Participating Operator. Based on service level agreement between the
Hosting and Participating operator such allocation can be automated without
human intervention.
The following requirements apply:
The Participating Operator shall be able to query and request spare capacity
of the Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN, based on policies and without human
intervention.
The Shared E-UTRAN/NG-RAN shall be able to allocate spare capacity to
Participating Operator, based on policies and without human intervention.
## 28.3 Specific GERAN & UTRAN Sharing Requirements
### 28.3.1 Allocation of Shared GERAN or UTRAN Resources
When GERAN or UTRAN resources are shared they can be allocated unequally to
the Participating Operators, depending on the planned or current needs of
these operators and based on service agreements with the Hosting RAN Operator.
The following requirements apply:
The Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to specify the allocation of GERAN or
UTRAN resources to each of the Participating Operators by the following:
a) static allocation, i.e. guaranteeing a minimum allocation and limiting to a
maximum allocation,
b) static allocation for a specified period of time and/or specific
cells/sectors,
c) first UE come first UE served allocation.
The management and allocation of resources of signalling traffic over the
Shared GERAN or UTRAN shall be independent from the management and allocation
of resources of the user traffic over the Shared GERAN or UTRAN.
A Shared GERAN or UTRAN shall be capable of differentiating traffic associated
with individual Participating Operators and shall be able to limit QoS
available for traffic of the UEs of a Participating Operator (e.g. "best
effort" if not enough resources are available).
A Shared GERAN or UTRAN shall be able to conduct admission control based on
the allocated GERAN or UTRAN resources for each Participating Operator with a
margin of tolerance.
A Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to control resource usage taking into
account the allocated GERAN or UTRAN resources for each Participating
Operator. A means of monitoring the usage of resources shall be provided.
All Shared GERAN or UTRAN capabilities offered by the Hosting RAN Operator
shall be individually available for use by each Participating Operator where
this is possible.
A Hosting RAN shall be able to provide an indication to each Participating
Operator of how much capacity they are allocated at any one time. Signalling
and User traffic shall be separately identified.
The ability to allow a single RAN (GERAN or UTRAN) to be fully shared by a
number of Participating Operators shall be provided.
### 28.3.2 OA&M Access to the Shared GERAN or UTRAN
Each Participating Operator can have their own OA&M capabilities, which are
used for monitoring and for selected operations in a Shared GERAN or UTRAN.
Information exchange involved in those operations need to be controlled by the
Hosting RAN Operator so as to prevent disclosing them to other Participating
Operators, be it for business, operational, or technical reasons.
The following requirements apply:
Selected OA&M capabilities for the Shared GERAN or UTRAN, under the control of
the Hosting RAN Operator, shall be accessible by the Participating Operator\'s
OA&M functions
This would allow, for example, the Participating Operator to do the following:
\- test of communication path between the Participating Operator\'s network
elements and the Shared GERAN or UTRAN,
\- obtain fault reports,
\- retrieve GERAN or UTRAN resource usage information.
### 28.3.3 Generation and retrieval of usage and accounting information
To facilitate inter-operator accounting between the Hosting RAN Operator and
the Participating Operator, the Hosting RAN Operator needs to record GERAN or
UTRAN resource usage by UEs of the Participating Operator.
The following requirements apply:
A Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to collect events supporting the
accounting of network resource usage separately for each Participating
Operator. Collected events may be delivered to the subscriber\'s Participating
Operator. This includes:
\- start of service in the Shared GERAN or UTRAN for a UE of the Participating
Operator,
\- end of service in the Shared GERAN or UTRAN for a UE of the Participating
Operator.
### 28.3.4 MDT Collection
MDT data from a Participating Operator\'s customer UEs allow the Hosting RAN
Operator to be provided with performance measurements on his Shared GERAN or
UTRAN. The Participating Operator is responsible for obtaining and retaining
any required user consent related to privacy.
The following requirements apply:
When authorized by the Participating Operators, the Hosting RAN Operator shall
be able to collect MDT data of the Participating Operator\'s UEs connected
through its GERAN or UTRAN.
The Participating Operators shall be able to retrieve this data for their own
subscribers from the Hosting RAN Operator.
NOTE: This functionality should also allow for the case where the Hosting RAN
Operator does not have an adjunct core network.
### 28.3.5 PWS support of Shared GERAN or UTRAN
A Participating Operator potentially has regulatory obligations to initiate
the broadcast of PWS messages regardless of GERAN or UTRAN Sharing.
The following requirements apply:
The Shared GERAN or UTRAN shall be able to broadcast PWS.
NOTE: The Hosting RAN Operator is responsible for the delivery of PWS messages
to the UEs.
### 28.3.6 Support for load balancing
Hosting RAN Operators need to optimise GERAN or UTRAN resource usage within
the Shared GERAN or UTRAN for a particular coverage area while respecting the
agreed resource shares for each Participating Operator. Similarly,
Participating Operators need to optimise their GERAN or UTRAN resource usage
between Shared and unshared GERAN or UTRAN for a particular coverage area.
The Hosting RAN Operator shall have the capability to balance the Signalling
and User Traffic load individually for each Participating Operator within a
Shared GERAN or UTRAN.
The capability to perform load balancing on the combined traffic of all the
Participating Operators within a Shared GERAN or UTRAN shall be provided. The
agreed shares of GERAN or UTRAN resources shall be maintained. Signalling and
User traffic shall be managed independently.
The capability to perform load balancing between an individual Participating
Operator\'s traffic within a Shared GERAN or UTRAN and traffic in that
Participating Operator\'s unshared GERAN or UTRAN where the Shared and
unshared GERAN or UTRAN coverage overlaps shall be supported.
The Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to balance the load across all
Participating Operators.
### 28.3.7 Dynamic capacity negotiation
The Participating Operator shall be able to request on-demand spare capacity
of the Shared GERAN or UTRAN based on policies and without human intervention.
The Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to allocate spare on-demand capacity on
the Shared GERAN or UTRAN to a Participating Operator, based on policies and
without human intervention.
The Participating Operator shall be able to request the cancellation of
granted on-demand capacity requests.
The Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to cancel a granted request based on a
Participating Operator's request or based on agreed policy.
The Hosting RAN Operator shall be able to change the amount shared by each
Participating Operator based on traffic demand. A minimum capacity (that can
be set) of the Hosting RAN shall be reserved for each Participating Operator
that cannot be allocated to other Participating Operators.
# 29 Service exposure with 3^rd^ party service providers
## 29.1 General
The intention of service exposure is that, under the assumption of a service
agreement between MNO and a 3rd party, the 3GPP Network allows a 3rd party
service provider to benefit from network provided services and capabilities
that are exposed by the PLMN. For example the 3GPP Core Network can exchange
information with the 3rd party to optimize usage and management of 3GPP
resources. A standardized exposure of network services/capabilities reduces
the complexity of different 3^rd^ parties to access different 3GPP network
services and capabilities.
General requirements for service exposure with 3rd party service providers:
\- The operator shall be able to provide to a 3rd party service provider
secure and chargeable access to the exposed services/capabilities i.e. to
authenticate, authorize and charge the 3rd party entities.
NOTE 1: This requirement can be implemented by the existing standardised API
frameworks e.g. the OMA API framework.
\- It shall be ensured that the 3GPP services/capabilities are not disclosed
to unauthorised parties and that user privacy (avoid e.g. trackable and
traceable identity information of the concerned UE) is maintained subject to
user agreement, operator policy, service agreement between operator and 3rd
party and regulation constraints.
\- The network service/capability exposure should be generic enough to support
different application needs. Exposed 3GPP services/capabilities may use
functionalities from different network entities and different 3GPP interfaces
## 29.2 Exposed Services and capabilities
The 3GPP Core Network shall be able provide a standardized interface to enable
exposure of the following services and capabilities to 3^rd^ party service
providers:
Support of 3^rd^ party requested MTC Device triggering
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall support a 3rd party service provider request to
trigger a UE that is served by the 3rd party service provider, the request
shall include:
\- a trigger payload, to provide information to the application on the UE to
e.g. trigger application related actions,
\- a validity period.
NOTE 1: The 3GPP Network will attempt to deliver the trigger message to the UE
until the validity period expires.
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall support the 3^rd^ party service provider to
recall or replace a trigger message that it has previously submitted.
NOTE 2: The goal of device triggering is that the UE takes action based on the
content of the trigger payload. This response can involve initiation of
communication with an MTC Server of the 3^rd^ party service provider. The UE
can initiate communication immediately or later within the validity period.
Support of 3rd party interaction for 3GPP resource management for background
data transfer:
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall support a 3rd party service provider request
for background data transfer for a set of UEs that are served by the 3rd party
service provider, indicating:
\- the desired time window for the data transfer,
\- the volume of the data expected to be transferred in a geographic area TS
23.032 [56].
\- Additionally, the 3rd party application server shall be able to indicate to
the 3GPP System when the background data transfer (a) exceeds the agreed
maximum data volume or (b) continues beyond the agreed time window or (c)
happens outside the agreed areas -- e.g. due to movement of individual UEs,
whether this background data transfer:
> \- shall be stopped by the 3GPP Sytem or
>
> \- shall continue, possibly under a different charging regime.
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall be able to inform the 3rd party service
provider in one coordinated response, based on locally available information
(e.g. congestion level) over the geographic area, about:
\- one or more recommended time windows for the data transfer and
\- for each time window the maximum aggregated bitrate for the set of UEs in
the geographical area indicated by the 3rd party service provider.
\- Additionally, the 3GPP Core Network shall be able to inform the 3rd party
service provider about the charging policy that will be applied to the 3^rd^
party service provider if the data are transferred within the recommended time
window and if transmission rates stay below the limits of the respective
maximum aggregated bitrate.
\- The goal of providing the time window is to favour transfer of more traffic
during non-busy hours and reason for providing the maximum aggregate bitrate
is to spread out traffic during that time. The goal of multiple time windows
is to allow the 3rd party provider to choose one appropriate time window based
on its preference like the expected charging regime and bitrate.
Support of 3^rd^ party interaction on information for predictable
communication patterns of a UE:
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall enable a 3rd party service provider to provide
information about predictable communication patterns of individual UEs or
groups of UEs that are served by this 3rd party service provider.\ Such
communication patterns may include:
\- Time and traffic volume related patterns (e.g. repeating communication
initiation intervals, desired 'keep alive' time of data sessions,
average/maximum volume per data transmission, etc.).
\- Location and Mobility related patterns (e.g. indication of stationary UEs,
predictable trajectories of UEs, etc.).
\- This information may be used by the 3GPP system to optimize resource usage.
Support of 3^rd^ party requested session QoS and priority
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall enable a 3^rd^ party service provider to
request setting up data sessions with specified QoS (e.g. low latency or
jitter) and priority handling to a UE that is served by the 3rd party service
provider.
Support of 3^rd^ party requested broadcast
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall enable a 3rd party service provider to request
sending a broadcast message in a specified geographic area (as specified in TS
22.368 [52]) expecting to reach a group of devices that are served by the 3rd
party service provider.
Informing the 3^rd^ party about potential network issues
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall be able to indicate to a 3rd party service
provider when data transmissions have a risk of incapability to provide
expected throughput and/or QoS in a specific area (e.g. due to forecasted high
traffic load in that area). Additionally, an estimate may be given when the
high traffic load is expected to be mitigated.
Informing the 3^rd^ party about UE status
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall be able to provide the following information
about a UE that is served by the 3^rd^ party service provider:
\- Indication of the _of the roaming status (i.e. Roaming and No Roaming) and
the serving network, when the UE starts/stops roaming_ ,
\- Loss of connectivity of the UE,
\- Change or loss of the association between the ME and the USIM,
\- Communication failure events of the UE visible to the network (e.g. for
troubleshooting).
> \- Reporting when the UE moves in/out of a geographic area that is indicated
> by the 3rd party,
>
> \- Reporting when the UE changes Routing Area / Tracking Area / Location
> Area / Cell.
>
> \- _Reporting when the UE changes the status of 3GPP PS Data Off._
NOTE: The area indicated by a 3^rd^ party service provider can be mapped to
the area used in the 3GPP network, i.e. a list of LAs/RAs/TAs/cells. The 3rd
party service provider can define a geographical area as shapes (e.g.
polygons, circles) or civic addresses (streets, districts...) as referenced by
OMA Presence API [53] e.g. defined by shape areas of IETF RFC-5491 [54] or by
civic addresses defined in IETF RFC-5139 [55].
\- The 3rd party service provider shall be able to request a one time
reporting or reporting at defined times (e.g. regular intervals, certain pre-
defined time points) on the number of UEs present in a certain area and the
location of each UE as for a Location Based Service.
\- Subject to user consent, operator policy and regulatory constraints, the
user privacy shall be maintained when passing location information to a 3rd
party service provider.
Informing the 3rd party about a UE's connection properties
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall be able to inform a 3^rd^ party about a UE's
connection properties.
NOTE: Connection properties of a UE describe the average data rate range or
non-absolute value (e.g. high, medium or low) that the UE is likely to be able
to obtain at the current location. The connection properties can, for example,
be generated from the UE's RAT type the UE is currently attached to, the load
conditions at its current location and/or other parameters.
Support for non-IP small data transfer with a 3^rd^ party
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall support a 3^rd^ party for submiting a small
amount of non-IP data for delivery to a UE.
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall support a 3^rd^ party application server for
receiving a small amount of non-IP data delivered from a UE.
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall support a 3^rd^ party to configuring non-IP
data delivery for a particular UE (e.g. destination address, maximum number of
messages, duration for which configuration applies).
NOTE: The use of the Non-IP Data Delivery feature via Service Capability
Exposure Function assumes that the UE has indicated support for 'non-IP data
transfer' and in case the Service Capability Exposure Function is used there
will be no user plane EPS bearer established.
# 30 Flexible Mobile Service Steering
## 30.1 Introduction
In order to realize efficient and flexible mobile service steering in (S)Gi-
LAN, the network operator uses information (e.g. user profile, network
operator's policies, RAT type, application characteristics) to define traffic
steering policies. These policies are used to steer the subscriber's traffic
to appropriate enablers (e.g. NAT, antimalware, parental control, DDoS
protection) in the (S)Gi-LAN.
The term (S)Gi-LAN used in the present document represents a system which is
out of 3GPP scope. Corresponding term for the 5G network is N6-LAN.
For traffic steering to service functions in 5G network, enhancement beyond
the service requirements below are defined in [59].
## 30.2 General Requirements
The following requirements apply:
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall be able to define and modify traffic steering
policies that are used to steer traffic in (S)Gi-LAN containing operator or
3^rd^ party service functions e.g. to improve e.g. the user's QoE, apply the
bandwidth limitation and provide valued added services.
\- Traffic steering policy shall be able to distinguish between upstream and
downstream traffic.
\- The 3GPP Core Network shall be able to define different traffic steering
policies for a user's traffic on a per session basis (e.g. for applying
parental control, anti-malware, DDoS protection, video optimization).
\- The 3GPP Core Network defines traffic steering policies based on one or
more pieces of information such as:
\- network operator's policies
\- user subscription (e.g. user's priority, the status of optional subscriber
services from the subscription data, based on service provider used,
subscribed QoS)
\- user\'s current RAT
\- the network (RAN and CN) load status
\- application characteristics such as: application type (video, web browsing,
IM, etc), application protocol ( HTTP, P2P, etc), target address name (URL)
and application provider (My tube, etc)
\- time
\- UE location
\- information (e.g. APN) of the destination network (i.e. a PDN or an
internal IP network) of traffic flow
\- In case of roaming, the HPLMN shall be able to apply traffic steering
policies for home routed traffic.
NOTE: Traffic steering policies for local breakout is not specified.
# 31 Control of traffic from UE-based applications toward associated server
## 31.1 Description
This feature is a set of service features that allows operators to control
traffic from UEs to an application on a third-party server or the third-party
server itself. When an application on a third-party server or the third-party
server itself becomes congested or fails the traffic towards that server need
to be controlled to avoid/mitigate potential issues caused by resulting
unproductive use of 3GPP network resource. This will also make it possible to
allow 3GPP network to help third-party servers to handle overload and recover
from failures. (see [11])
## 31.2 Requirements
### 31.2.1 Control requirements
The 3GPP network shall be able to control (i.e. block and/or prioritize)
traffic from UEs to an application on a third-party server or the third-party
server itself without affecting traffic to other applications on the third-
party server or to other third-party servers.
For this purpose, the 3GPP network shall be able to identify the third-party
server or the application on the third-party server, and the traffic towards
it.
When congestion or failure of the application on the third-party server or the
third-party server abates the 3GPP network shall be able to apply this feature
in a phased manner to gradually restore traffic according to operator policy.
The 3GPP network shall be able to control traffic through this feature based
on:
(1) the traffic load on the 3GPP network,\ (2) the MNO policy,\ (3) the MNO's
service subscription profiles such as access class information, and\ (4)
third-party service subscription profiles
without impacting the traffic to other applications on the third-party server
or other third-party servers.
### 31.2.2 Requirements on awareness of third-party server issue
The 3GPP network shall be able to receive a status indication from the third-
party server when an application on it is experiencing congestion or failure,
and when normal operation resumes. Such a status indication may be sent
periodically, and/or when the status of the application changes.
The 3GPP network shall be able to detect and monitor a third-party server's
operational status e.g. congestion levels, failure and unavailability of the
third-party server.
# 32 3GPP enhancement for TV application support

  * End of service in the shared eMBMS network for a UE of the Participating MNO
### 32.2.6 Requirement for wide area support
The eMBMS network shall be able to support designated coverage area, for
example national, regional and local coverage areas.
### 32.2.7 Requirement for capability exposure
The 3GPP system shall be able to support an MNO offering on-demand broadcast

The 3GPP network shall allow a UE to receive unicast TV content using existing
TV antenna equipment, at least for the downlink
NOTE 2: This might imply the uplink to take another path e.g. via a different
antenna if existing TV antenna equipment is not suitable for transmission.
# 33 Usage over unlicensed access
## 33.1 Description
It is important to document usage over unlicensed access such that an operator
has the facility to determine which type of access the traffic was transported
over.
For example, LTE-WiFi Aggregation (LWA) and License Assisted Access (LAA) are
two features whereby a UE is connected to two access technologies at the same
time, i.e., a primary access and a secondary access, where the secondary
access technology operates in unlicensed spectrum.
## 33.2 Requirements
The 3GPP network shall be able to identify traffic which was transported over
unlicensed access.
# 34 Void
## 34.1 Void
## 34.2 Void
# 35 Restricted local operator services
## 35.1 Description
Access to restricted local operator services by unauthenticated UEs is based
on FCC regulations in the U.S. related to manual roaming as noted in the Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47 Chapter 1 Subchapter B Part 20 Section
20.3 and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47 Chapter 1 Subchapter B
Part 20 Section 20.12 (Resale and Roaming) Subparagraph c [60].
The restricted local operator services offered by an operator are out of scope
of 3GPP. Allowing access to restricted local operator services is completely
under the local operator's control. The local operator can restrict
unauthenticated UEs to be able to access restricted local operator services
exclusively.
Authenticated UEs in limited service state may also be able to use restricted
local operator services.
NOTE: Services provided through RLOS may also be available to authenticated
UEs not in limited service state by other methods.
## 35.2 Requirements
Based on operator policy and national regulations, the 3GPP system shall
support a mechanism to indicate to UEs that restricted local operator services
are available.
A UE shall be able to explicitly request access to a network offering
restricted local operator services in order to access restricted local
operator services.
A UE explicitly requesting access to a network offering restricted local
operator services in order to receive restricted local operator services shall
not be put into limited service state.
Based on operator policy and national regulations, the 3GPP system shall
support mechanisms to allow access to restricted local operator services by
unauthenticated UEs.
The network shall be able to isolate restricted local operator services and
usage from the rest of the network (i.e., similar to security for
unauthenticated CS or IMS emergency calls).
When a UE recognizes an origination attempt to a restricted local operator
service and has not received an indication from the serving system that
restricted local operator services are available, the UE shall block the
origination attempt.
The UE shall include the restricted local operator service call type indicator
when an origination attempt is made for a restricted local operator service.
###### ## Annex A (normative): Description of optional user equipment features
## A.1 Display of called number
This feature enables the caller to check before call setup whether the
selected number is correct.
## A.2 Indication of call progress signals
Indications shall be given such as tones, recorded messages or visual display
based on signalling information returned from the PLMN. On data calls, this
information may be signalled to the DTE.
Call progress indicators are described in 3GPP TS 22.001 [4].
## A.3 Country/PLMN indication
The country/PLMN indicator shows in which PLMN the UE is currently registered.
This indicator is necessary so that the user knows when \"roaming\" is taking
place and that the choice of PLMN is correct. Both the country and PLMN will
be indicated. When more than one visited PLMN is available in a given area
such information will be indicated.
The PLMN name is either:
\- Stored in the ME and associated with the MCC+MNC combination received on
the broadcast channel;
\- NITZ (see 22.042 [17]) (in which case it overrides the name stored in the
ME);
\- stored in the USIM in text and /or graphic format and associated with the
MCC+MNC combination, and optionally the LAI, received on the broadcast channel
(in which case it overrides the name stored in the UE and -- if present -- the
NITZ name).
It shall be possible to store on the USIM at least 10 PLMN Identifications
(MCC+MNC combination and optionally the LAI) for which the same PLMN name
shall be displayed.
The PLMN name stored in the USIM has the highest priority, followed by the
PLMN name provided by NITZ. The PLMN name stored in the ME has the lowest
priority.
If the PLMN name stored in the USIM is not available in text format and the UE
is unable to display the graphic format, the PLMN name provided by NITZ has
the highest priority, the PLMN name stored in the ME has the next priority.
For a PLMN name provided by NITZ, operators using non-Latin characters of the
local language (such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Arabic, Hindi,
etc.) may include the network name in Latin characters in addition to
characters of the local language.
For a PLMN name provided by NITZ, the roaming UE should skip displaying non-
Latin character(s) if the language of those character(s) does not match the
language of the MMI for the UE. If this would lead to no remaining Latin
character in the PLMN name, the UE should skip displaying the PLMN name
provided by NITZ; the PLMN name stored in the ME has the next priority
instead.
## A.4 Service Provider Name indication
The service provider name is stored in the USIM in text and/or optionally
graphic format. It shall be possible to associate at least 10 PLMN
Identifications (MCC+MNC combination) with the same SP Name.
When registered on the HPLMN, or one of the PLMN Identifications used for
Service Provider Name display:
(i) The SP Name shall be displayed;
(ii) Display of the PLMN Name is an operator\'s option by setting the
appropriate fields in the USIM (i.e. the Service Provider name shall be
displayed either in parallel to the PLMN Name or instead of the PLMN Name).
When registered on neither the HPLMN, nor one of the PLMN Identifications used
for Service Provider Name display:
(i) The PLMN name shall be displayed;
(ii) Display of the SP Name is an operator\'s option by setting the
appropriate fields in the USIM.
If the UE is unable to display the full name of the Service Provider the name
is cut from the tail end. The storage of Service Provider name and options,
and choice of options, shall be under control of the network operator.
## A.4a Core Network Operator Name indication
It shall be possible for the UE to display the name of the core network
operator the user has selected.
## A.5 Keypad
A physical means of entering numbers, generally, though not necessarily, in
accordance with the layout shown in figure A.1.
See also 3GPP TS 22.030 [6] (Man-Machine Interface).
Additional keys may provide the means to control the UE (e.g. to initiate and
terminate calls).

## A.6 Short message indication and acknowledgement
This feature allows the delivery of short messages to a UE from a service
centre. Such messages are submitted to the service centre by a
telecommunications network user who can also request information of the status
of the message by further interrogation of the service centre. The service
centre then transmits the message to an active UE user.
The UE must therefore provide an indication to the user that a message has
been received from the service centre and must also send an acknowledgement
signal to the PLMN to show that this indication has been activated. The PLMN
then returns this acknowledgement to the service centre.
The short message service teleservice is described in specification 3GPP TS
22.003 [14].
## A.7 Short message overflow indication
An indication shall be given to the user of the short message service when an
incoming message cannot be received due to insufficient available memory.
## A.8 International access function
Provision is made for a direct, standard method of gaining international
access. For this purpose the UE may have a key whose primary or secondary
function is marked \"+\". This is signalled over the radio interface and would
have the effect of generating the international access code in the network. It
may be used directly when setting up a call, or entered into the memory for
abbreviated dialling.
This feature is of benefit since the international access code varies between
CEPT countries, which might cause confusion to a user, and prevent the
effective use of abbreviated dialling when roaming internationally. Users may
still place international calls conventionally, using the appropriate
international access code.
## A.9 Service Indicator (SI)
An indication is given to the user that there is adequate signal strength (as
far as can be judged from the received signal) to allow a call to be made.
Additionally the network should be capable of providing, and the UE may
display, an indication of the serving cells\' capabilities e.g. GPRS, HSDPA,
HSUPA.
If indicated by the registered network, the UE in idle mode may display an
indication of one of the radio access technologies provided to the UE in the
network on which the UE is registered with the following priority order:
E-UTRAN, UTRAN, GERAN.
Displaying the serving cell\'s capabilities and the access technology are
mutually exclusive.
## A.10 Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF)
The UE shall be capable of initiating DTMF in accordance with specifications
3GPP TS 22.003 [14]. Optionally, the UE may provide a suppress function which
allows the user to switch off the DTMF function.
## A.11 On/Off switch
The UE may be provided with a means of switching its power supply on and off.
Switch-off shall be \"soft\", so that on activation, the UE completes the
following housekeeping functions: termination of a current call, detach (where
applicable) and storing required data in the SIM/USIM before actually
switching off. As far as possible, this procedure should also apply on power
failure (e.g. remote switch-off or low battery).
## A.12 Sub-Address
This feature allows the mobile to append and/or receive a sub-address to a
Directory Number, for use in call set-up, and in those supplementary services
that use a Directory Number.
## A.13 Short Message Service Cell Broadcast
The Short Message Service Cell Broadcast enables the mobile equipment to
receive short messages from a message handling system.
The short message service cell broadcast teleservice is described in
specification 3GPP TS 22.003 [14]
## A.14 Short Message Service Cell Broadcast DRX
This feature enables a mobile equipment to save on battery utilization, by
allowing the mobile equipment to not listen during the broadcast of messages
the subscriber is not interested in.
## A.15 Support of the extended Short message cell broadcast channel
This feature allows a mobile equipment by supporting of the extended Short
message cell broadcast channel to enhance the capacity of the service. The
support of the extended channel has low priority, i.e. the UE can interrupt
the reading of this channel if idle mode procedures have to be executed.
## A.16 Network Identity and Timezone
The feature provides the means for serving PLMNs to transfer current identity,
universal time and the local timezone to mobile equipment, and for the mobile
equipment to store and use this information. This enhances roaming by
permitting accurate indication of PLMN identities that are either newer than
the ME or have changed their name since the ME was sold. Additionally time and
timezone information can be utilized by MEs as desired.
The network name time and timezone information will normally be transferred
from the network to the ME:
1) Upon registering on the network.
2) When the UE geographically relocates to a different Local Time Zone.
3) When the network changes its Local Time Zone, e.g. between summer and
winter time.
4) When the network changes its identity.
5) At any time during a signalling connection with mobile equipment.
Further details of this feature are described in 3GPP TS 22.042 [17].
## A.17 Network\'s indication of alerting in the UE
This feature provides the means for serving PLMNs to transfer to a UE an
indication that may be used by the UE to alert the user in a specific manner
in the following cases:
\- mobile terminating call
\- network-initiated USSD
\- network-initiated Mobile Originated (MO) connection, if the ME supports the
\"network-initiated MO connection \" feature.
Eight different indications are defined, whether the mobile terminating
traffic is a call or USSD or related to the network-initiated MO connection
procedure. These indications are sent by the network and received by the UE:
\- Three of these indications are used as levels, reflecting some kind of
urgency: level 0 indicates that the UE shall not alert the user for USSD and
remain silent in the case of call, level 2 shall be considered by the UE as
more important than level 1 for the purpose of alerting the user.
\- The five other indications are used as categories, identifying different
types of terminating traffic. The UE shall inform the user in a specific
manner for each of these five categories. Nevertheless, the possible forms of
the alert (different ringing tones, displayed text, graphical symbols...) is
still up to the mobile manufacturer (some forms of alerts can be
simultaneously used, e.g. ringing tones and text on the display).
The management of the feature by the UE requires for the handling of
categories that:
\- the SIM/USIM stores for each category an informative text (maximum 25
characters per category) describing the type of terminating traffic associated
with the category. This information could be used by the UE when alerting the
user (display on the screen). It is necessary for the network operator to be
able to change the meaning of each category.
\- The user has the ability to set up his/her own association between the type
of terminating traffic (identified by each category) and the different types
of alert provided by the UE. To help the user in this choice, the UE uses the
informative text associated with each category (as stored in the SIM/USIM).
The UE should keep this association when switched off.
Default settings should also be defined in the ME for the following cases:
\- when the UE receives a call, USSD or a request for a network-initiated MO
connection with no alerting indication,
\- when the UE receives a call, USSD or a request for a network-initiated MO
connection with a category of alerting not defined in the SIM/USIM.
These default settings should be separated per type of mobile terminated
traffic received (call, USSD or request for a network-initiated MO
connection).
A UE supporting the feature shall act according to the following points in
case of mobile terminating traffic:
\- when a mobile terminating traffic is received without any indication (level
or category), the ME shall act as if it was not supporting the feature, i.e.
use a default alert (e.g. associated with this type of mobile terminating
traffic).
\- if a level is indicated, the UE shall use an alert enabling the user to
differentiate between the three levels.
\- if a category is indicated, then:
\- if the SIM/USIM used in the UE does not store any information on that
feature, the UE shall ignore the category received with any mobile terminating
traffic and act as if it was not supporting the feature, i.e. use a default
alert (e.g. associated with this type of mobile terminating traffic).
\- if the category is not defined in the SIM/USIM, the UE shall act as if it
was not supporting the feature, i.e. use a default alert (e.g. associated with
this type of mobile terminating traffic).
\- if the category is defined in the SIM/USIM, the UE shall use the alert
associated with this category. In addition, it would be very useful for the
user to be notified of the informative text associated with this category
(e.g. on the display).
Some interactions between this feature and other services related to alerting
are described below:
\- the call waiting service has priority on this feature, i.e. the call
waiting tone will be played and not the alert derived by this feature. If
possible, two different indications should be given to the user (e.g. the call
waiting tone and a text on the display indicating call waiting, and in
addition a text relative to the type of the new call received).
\- the presentation of the calling line identity takes priority on this
feature, if it is not possible to display this information and another
information related to this feature.
\- In case of interaction between this feature and UE specific features to
alert the user (e.g. whole silent mode), the user should still be able to
differentiate between the different levels or different types of terminating
traffic, even if the alert itself may be changed.
## A.18 Network-initiated Mobile Originated (MO) connection
The \"Network-initiated Mobile Originated connection\" feature allows the
network to ask the mobile equipment to establish a mobile originated
connection. The serving PLMN provides the mobile equipment with the necessary
information which is used by the mobile equipment to establish the connection.
Currently only the network-initiated mobile originated call feature is
specified. It is mandatory for a UE supporting CCBS and is used in the case of
a CCBS recall.
## A.19 Abbreviated dialling
The directory number or part of it is stored in the mobile equipment together
with the abbreviated address. After retrieval the directory number may appear
on the display.
Abbreviated dialling numbers stored in the UE or USIM may contain wild
characters.
If wild characters are used to indicate missing digits, each wild character
shall be replaced for network access or supplementary service operation, by a
single digit entered at the keypad. The completed directory number is
transmitted on the radio path.
## A.20 Barring of Dialled Numbers
This feature provides a mechanism so that by the use of an electronic lock it
is possible to place a bar on calling any numbers belonging to a pre-
programmed list of numbers in the SIM/USIM.
Barred Dialling Numbers stored in the /USIM may contain wild characters.
Under control of PIN2, \"Barred Dialling Mode\" may be enabled or disabled.
The selected mode is stored in the SIM/USIM.
Under PIN2 control, it shall be possible to add, modify or delete a particular
\"Barred Dialling Number\" (BDN) and to allocate or modify its associated
comparison method(s). This BDN may have the function of an abbreviated
dialling number / supplementary service control (ADN/SSC), overflow and/or
sub-address.
When BDN is inactive, no special controls are specified, and the barred
dialling numbers may be read (though not modified or deleted, except under
PIN2 control) as if they were normal abbreviated dialling numbers. Access to
keyboard and normal abbreviated dialling numbers (including sub-address) is
also permitted.
When Barring of Dialled Numbers is active:
\- Considering a number dialled by the user, if it exists a BDN for which
there is a successful comparison (see below) between that BDN and the dialled
number, then the ME shall prevent the call attempt to that number. If there is
no BDN to fulfil those conditions, the call attempt is allowed by the ME.
With each BDN is associated one (or a combination of) comparison method(s)
used between that BDN and the number dialled by the user. At least three
different comparison methods are possible:
\- The comparison is made from the first digit of that BDN, from the first
digit of the dialled number and for a number of digits corresponding to the
length of the BDN.
\- The comparison is made from the first digit of that BDN, from any digit of
the dialled number and for a number of digits corresponding to the length of
the BDN.
\- The comparison is made backwards from the last digit of that BDN, from the
last digit of the dialled number and for a number of digits corresponding to
the length of the BDN.
\- If a BDN stored in the SIM/USIM contains one or more wild characters in any
position, each wild character shall be replaced by any single digit when the
comparison between that BDN and the dialled number is performed.
\- If a BDN contains a sub-address, and the same number without any sub-
address or with that subâ€‘address is dialled, the ME shall prevent the call
attempt to that number.
\- Numbers specified as \"barred\" may only be modified under PIN2 control.
\- If the ME does not support barring of dialled numbers, the UE with a BDN
enabled USIM shall not allow the making of calls and the UE with BDN enabled
SIM shall not allow the making or receiving of calls. However, this feature
does not affect the ability to make emergency calls.
If \"Fixed Number Dialling\" and \"Barring of Dialled Numbers\" are
simultaneously active, the dialled number shall be checked against the two
features before the ME allows the call attempt. In that case, a dialled number
will only be allowed by the ME if it is in the FDN list and if the comparison
between that number and any number from the BDN list is not successful.
The UE may support other selective barrings, e.g. applying to individual
services (e.g. telephony, data transmission) or individual call types (e.g.
long distance, international calls).
## A.21 DTMF control digits separator
Provision has been made to enter DTMF digits with a telephone number, and upon
the called party answering the UE shall send the DTMF digits automatically to
the network after a delay of 3 seconds (Â± 20 %). The digits shall be sent
according to the procedures and timing specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].
The first occurrence of the \"DTMF Control Digits Separator\" shall be used by
the ME to distinguish between the addressing digits (i.e. the phone number)
and the DTMF digits. Upon subsequent occurrences of the separator, the UE
shall pause again for 3 seconds (Â± 20 %) before sending any further DTMF
digits.
To enable the separator to be stored in the address field of an Abbreviated
Dialling Number record in the SIM/USIM, the separator shall be coded as
defined in 3GPP TS 31.102 [19]. The telephone number shall always precede the
DTMF digits when stored in the SIM/USIM.
The way in which the separator is entered and display in the UE, is left to
the individual manufacturer\'s MMI.
MEs which do not support this feature and encounter this separator in an ADN
record of the SIM/USIM will treat the character as \"corrupt data\" and act
accordingly.
## A.22 Selection of directory number in messages
The Short Message Service (SMS), Cell Broadcast Service (CBS), Multimedia
Message Service (MMS), Network-initiated USSD or Network Response to Mobile
Originated USSD message strings may be used to convey a Directory Number,
which the user may wish to call.
## A.23 Last Numbers Dialled (LND)
The Last \"N\" Numbers dialled may be stored in the SIM/USIM and/or the ME.
\"N\" may take the value up to 10 in the SIM/USIM. It may be any value in the
ME. The method of presentation of these to the user for setting up a call is
the responsibility of the UE but if these numbers are stored in both the
SIM/USIM and the UE, those from the SIM/USIM shall take precedence.
## A.24 Service Dialling Numbers
The Service Dialling Numbers feature allows for the storage of numbers related
to services offered by the network operator/service provider in the SIM/USIM
(e.g. customer care). The user can use these telephone numbers to make
outgoing calls, but the access for updating of the numbers shall be under the
control of the operator.
NOTE: No MMI is envisaged to be specified for these numbers and it is left to
mobile manufacturer implementations.
A specific example of Service Dialling Numbers is the storage of mailbox
dialling numbers on the SIM/USIM for access to mailboxes associated with
Voicemail, Fax, Electronic Mail and Other messages.
## A.25 Fixed number dialling
This feature provides a mechanism so that by the use of an electronic lock it
is possible to place a bar on calling any numbers other than those pre-
programmed in the SIM/USIM.
Under control of PIN 2, \"Fixed Dialling Mode\" may be enabled or disabled.
The mode selected is stored in the SIM/USIM.
Fixed Dialling Numbers (FDNs) are stored in the SIM/USIM in the Fixed Dialling
Number field. FDN entries are composed of a destination address/Supplementary
Service Control. Destination addresses may have the format relevant to the
bearer services/teleservices defined in [21] and [14]. FDN entries may take
the function of an Abbreviated Dialling Number/Supplementary Service Control
(ADN/SSC), Overflow and/or sub-address. Fixed Dialling Numbers stored in the
SIM/USIM may contain wild card characters.
The Fixed Dialling feature is optional, however when Fixed Dialling Mode is
enabled, an ME supporting the feature shall;
\- Prevent the establishment of bearer services/teleservices to destination
addresses which are not in FDN entries on a per bearer service/teleservice
basis. The list of bearer services/teleservices excluded from the FDN check
shall be stored in the SIM/USIM. Those bearer services/teleservices are
characterised by their service code as described in [23]. For instance, if the
SMS teleservices is indicated in this list, SMS can be sent to any
destination. By default, the ME shall prevent the establishment of any bearer
service/teleservice to destination addresses which are not in FDN entries.
\- Only allow modification, addition or deletion of Fixed Number Dialling
entries under control of PIN2.
\- Allow the establishment of bearer services/teleservice to destination
addresses stored in FDN entries. For SMS, the Service Center address and the
end-destination address shall be checked.
\- Support the reading and substitution of wildcards in any position of an FDN
entry, via the ME MMI.
\- Allow the user to replace each wildcard of an FDN entry by a single digit,
on a per call basis without using PIN2. The digit replacing the wildcard may
be used for network access or supplementary service operation.
\- Only allow Supplementary Service (SS) Control (in Dedicated or Idle mode)
if the SS control string is stored as an FDN entry.
\- Allow the extension of an FDN entry by adding digits to the Fixed Dialling
number on a per call basis.
\- Allow the emergency numbers (see Section 8.4) to be called, even if it is
not an FDN entry.
\- Allow normal access to ADN fields (i.e. allow ADN entries to be modified,
added or deleted) and the keyboard.
\- Allow use of ADNs subject to the FDN filter.
When FDN is disabled, an ME supporting FDN shall;
\- Allow FDN entries to be read as though they were normal ADN entries.
\- Only allow modification, addition or deletion of Fixed Number Dialling
entries under control of PIN2.
\- Allow normal access to ADN fields and the keyboard.
If the ME does not support FDN, the UE shall not allow the making of calls
when Fixed Dialling is enabled in the USIM, and the UE shall not allow the
making or receiving of calls when Fixed Dialling is enabled in the SIM.
However, emergency calls (112 and other user defined emergency numbers) shall
still be possible.
NOTE: Wildcards are stored on the SIM/USIM. The wildcard coding is given in
3GPP TS 31.102 [19].
## A.26 Message Waiting Indication
A short message may be used to provide an indication to the user about the
status and number of types of messages waiting on systems connected to the
PLMN. The ME shall present this indication as an icon on the screen, or other
MMI indication, and store the indication status on the SIM/USIM to allow the
status to be retained through power off/on, SIM/USIM movement between UEs etc.
The ME shall be able to accept and acknowledge these message waiting status
short messages irrespective of the memory available in the SIM/USIM.
## A.27 Transfer of eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD)
## A.27.1 General Requirements
With the exception of the following specific requirements, considered
necessary for the satisfactory operation of the eCall service, all existing
emergency call requirements shall apply.
An eCall shall consist of an emergency call supplemented by a minimum set of
emergency related data (MSD). The MSD e.g. vehicle identity, location
information and other parameters, is defined by CEN [46].
\- An eCall may be initiated automatically, for example due to a vehicle
collision, or manually by the vehicle occupants;
> \- An IVS, or other UE designed to support eCall functionality, shall
> include in the emergency call set-up an indication that the present call is
> either a Manually Initiated eCall (MIeC) or an Automatically Initiated eCall
> (AIeC).
\- The Minimum Set of Data (MSD) sent by the In vehicle System (IVS) to the
network shall not exceed 140 bytes;
\- Should the MSD component not be included in an eCall, or is corrupted or
lost for any reason, then this shall not affect the associated emergency call
speech functionality.
\- To reduce the time taken to establish an eCall an IVS whilst in eCall only
mode, may receive network availability information whilst not registered on a
PLMN.
\- PLMNs should make use of eCall indicators, received in the emergency call
set-up, to differentiate eCalls from other emergency calls.
\- The MIeC and AIeC should be used by the serving network to filter and route
eCalls to dedicated, eCall equipped, PSAPs.
\- The PSAP shall be given an indication that the incoming call is an eCall.
\- When an emergency call, other than an eCall, is routed to a PSAP that
supports the eCall service, the eCall equipment shall not cause audible
interference to the emergency voice call.
Throughout the duration of the emergency call and following receipt of the MSD
by the PSAP
\- It shall be possible for the PSAP to send a confirmation to the IVS that
the MSD has been acted upon.
\- It shall be possible for the PSAP to request the IVS to re-send its most
recent MSD.
\- It shall be possible for the PSAP to instruct the IVS to terminate the
eCall.
## A.27.2 Requirements for the transfer of eCall MSD in a TS12 call
The MSD should typically be made available to the PSAP within 4 seconds
measured from the time when end to end connection with the PSAP is
established;
A call progress indication shall be provided to the user whilst the MSD
transmission is in progress.
Where the eCall indicators are not supported by the serving network, the time
needed for the PSAP eCall modem to differentiate between eCalls and other TS12
calls, before routing the call to an operator, shall not exceed 2 seconds from
when the IVS receives notification that the PSAP has answered the call.
When an eCall is routed to a PSAP, that does not support the eCall service,
the In Vehicle System (IVS) shall not emit any audible tones for longer than 2
seconds from the time that the call is first answered.
## A.27.3 Requirements for the transfer of eCall data in an IMS emergency call
The MSD should typically be available to the PSAP when the end to end
connection with the PSAP has been established.
NOTE: There are cases where a UE delivers multiple instances of an MSD to one
or more PSAPs, for example as per 3GPP TS 22.101 clause 10.1.2., when an IMS
emergency call based eCall attempt has not been successful but the MSD was
successfully received by a PSAP. It is out of the scope of 3GPP as to how to
manage any duplicate information received by the PSAP(s) or emergency services
as a result of this.
Additional data (i.e. data not contained in the initial MSD) may be
transferred at any time during the eCall (e.g. MSD acknowledgement, resending
of the MSD if requested by a PSAP).
The call setup time of an eCall shall be the same as for an IMS emergency
call.
The IVS shall not emit any audible tones in order to transfer the MSD or other
eCall related data.
## A.27.4 Interworking requirements
A PSAP, which is connected to the IMS, and supports either IMS emergency call
based eCall or TS12 based eCall, shall be able to interwork with a TS12 based
IVS using IMS Centralized Service, i.e. it shall be able to terminate the
emergency call from the IVS, receive the MSD and request additional data from
the IVS, using the eCall Modem end-to-end.
An IVS that supports IMS emergency call based eCalls shall also support TS12
based eCalls.
An IVS that supports IMS emergency call based eCalls and is attached via LTE
access with no CS access available shall support the transfer of MSD via IMS
emergency call to a TS12 based PSAP using the eCall Modem end-to-end.
NOTE 1: It is assumed that the above scenario is very unlikely to occur on the
market. Therefore the operation of eCall Modem over a PS bearer should be
considered as an option of last resort [58]. As such this is not constrained
by the requirements in A.27.2 and A.27.3.
In case of interworking between TS12 and IMS emergency call based eCall
equipment the requirements given in subclause A.27.2 shall apply, requirements
given in subclause A.27.3 do not apply.
## A.27.5 Domain selection
A PLMN shall indicate to an IVS whether IMS emergency call based eCalls are
supported.
An IVS that supports both IMS emergency call based eCalls and TS12 based
eCalls shall support domain selection for an eCall in the same way as for any
other emergency call except for determining PLMN support for an IMS emergency
based eCall using the PLMN indication for this.
## A.28 Requirements for \"In Case of Emergency\" (ICE) information
The In Case of Emergency (ICE) information are used to enable first
responders, such as paramedics, fire-fighters, and police officers, to contact
a victim\'s emergency contact(s) in order to identify the victim and obtain
important medical information or other information required during an
emergency.
A UE shall have the capability to store one or more \"ICE information\" on the
UICC. The \"ICE information\" shall list the type of information which is to
be configured by the mobile operator as described in the table below.
Table A.28.1: \"ICE information\" description

Provision is made for direct and unambiguous read access from the UE to ICE
information stored on the UICC.
The subscriber may choose not to enter any ICE information.
The default configuration for this information shall be that they are
accessible even when the security features on either the UE or UICC have been
enabled (e.g. the keypad is locked). **It shall be possible for the subscriber
to change this default setting to prevent accessibility to the ICE information
(i.e.** a user configurable setting in the UICC indicates whether the ICE
information on the UICC shall be displayed or not, if the ICE access procedure
described in TS 22.030 [6] is invoked**).**
The unlocking of ICE information shall not allow access to other secure
information on the UICC or UE. The ICE information value should not be
accessible to ME or UICC applications.
The ICE access procedure is described in TS 22.030 [6].
###### ## Annex B (informative): Additional number use case
Company X is customer of operator Z and has a subscription for voice and data
with 10 SIM cards. The company also decides to subscribe to the private
numbering plan feature of operator Z. A certain corporate phone number is
assigned to company X, e.g. +43 676 88888 xx (with xx being the extensions of
the users), and they can freely choose the extensions for up to 100 SIM cards.
Initially company X take the existing 10 SIM cards (with the existing MSISDNs)
and integrate them into the private numbering plan by assigning the extensions
11 to 20 to these cards via a web portal. This is not a permanent assignment,
the extensions can be changed easily any time, old SIMs can be deleted from
the private numbering plan and new ones can be integrated whenever necessary.
Special privileges or restrictions can be chosen on a per SIM basis via the
portal and special tariffs apply.
The CEO of company X calls a customer. The customer\'s phone displays the
corporate number + extension of the CEO as CLI. After a while the customer
decides to call back the CEO and uses the corporate number + extension as
MSISDN. Later they also exchange some short messages, again the corporate
number + extension of the CEO is used as sender\'s MSISDN.
For all these calls and short messages operator Z is able to collect charging
records containing the corporate number + extension.
The CEO also uses her smart phone to establish PS connections to browse the
internet and to access the intranet via the operator\'s gateway. The corporate
number + extension is used for authentication and authorisation in the
company\'s intranet and its web applications. Charging for PS connections by
operator Z is also based on this number.
In general the users in company X are not aware of their \"real\" underlying
MSISDNs in the system, they only see the corporate number + their extension
and there is no need for them to know the underlying MSISDN.
