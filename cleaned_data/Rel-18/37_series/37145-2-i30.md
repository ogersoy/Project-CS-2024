In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies radiated test methods and conformance
requirements for 2 types of AAS BS; _hybrid requirements set_ which specify
requirements for a _hybrid AAS BS_ with both a conducted and a radiated
interface and _OTA requirements set_ which specify requirements for an _OTA
AAS BS_ which has a radiated interface only.
The _hybrid AAS BS_ requirements are specified for E-UTRA AAS Base Station
(BS), the FDD mode of UTRA AAS Base Station (BS), the 1,28 Mcps TDD mode of
UTRA AAS Base Station (BS) in single RAT and any MSR AAS Base Station (BS)
implementation of these RATs including NR operation.
The _OTA AAS BS_ requirements are specified for E-UTRA AAS Base Station (BS),
the FDD mode of UTRA AAS Base Station (BS), in single RAT and any MSR AAS Base
Station (BS) implementation of these RATs and/or NR.
The requirements have been derived from, and are consistent with non-AAS BS
specifications in TS 25.104 [2], TS 25.105 [3], TS 36.104 [4] or TS 37.104 [5]
and where applicable with the NR specification TS 38.104 [33]. The technical
specification TS 37.145 is in 2 parts, part TS 37.145-1 [9] covers conducted
requirements and part TS 37.145-2 (the present document) covers radiated
requirements.
The present document does not establish radiated test methods and conformance
requirements for Band 46 operation as it is not supported by AAS BS. Conducted
Band 46 test requirements are still applicable for AAS BS for protection of
and against Band 46 operation, as specified in TS 37.145-1 [9].
The present document does not establish minimum RF characteristics or minimum
performance requirements for Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) in band,
NB-IoT guard band, or standalone NB-IoT operation, for AAS BS in _single RAT
E-UTRA operation_ or in _MSR operation_ using E-UTRA.

## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 2 of
this specification, i.e. to all AAS BS radiated tests.
The minimum requirements for AAS BS radiated requirements are given in TS
37.105 [14] clause 9 and 10 for the radiated transmitter and radiated receiver
characteristics, respectively. Test Tolerances for the radiated test
requirements explicitly stated in part 2 of the present specification are
given in annex C of this specification.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances
are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
#### 4.1.2.1 General
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where appropriate.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For details on measurement uncertainty budget calculation, OTA measurement
methodology description (including calibration and measurement stage for each
test range), MU budget format and its contributions, refer to TR 37.941 [38].

## 4.11 Test signal configurations for testing
### 4.11.1 General
The test configurations shall be constructed using the methods defined below
subject to the parameters declared by the manufacturer as listed in clause
4.10.
For test contiguous spectrum operation configurations used in receiver tests
only the carriers in the outermost frequency positions in the _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ need to be generated by the test equipment. For non-contiguous
spectrum operation test configurations used in receiver tests, outermost
carriers for each sub-block need to be generated by the test equipment.
The applicable test models for generation of the carrier transmit test signal
are defined in clause 4.12.2.
NOTE: If required, carriers are shifted to align with the channel raster.
### 4.11.1A NR Test signal used to build Test Configurations
The signal\'s Channel Bandwidth and Subcarrier spacing used to build NR Test
Configurations shall be selected according to table 4.11.1A-1.
Table 4.11.1A-1: Signal to be used to build NR TCs
Operating Band characteristics F~DL_high~ -- F~DL_low~ \ \- The Base Station RF Bandwidth shall be the declared maximum Base Station
> RF Bandwidth for non-contiguous operation. The Base Station RF Bandwidth
> consists of one sub-block gap and two sub-blocks located at the edges of the
> declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth.
\- Adjacent to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge:
> \- Place an NR carrier. The specified F~Offset-RAT~ shall apply.
\- Adjacent to the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge:
> \- Place an E-UTRA carrier. The specified F~Offset-RAT~ shall apply.
>
> \- Place a UTRA carrier adjacent to the lower sub-block edge of the upper
> sub-block.
\- For transmitter tests, place one UTRA adjacent to the upper sub-block edge
of the lower sub-block. The nominal carrier spacing defined in subclause 4.6
shall apply.
\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined using
the specified F~Offset-RAT~ for the carrier adjacent to the sub-block gap. The
carrier(s) may be shifted maximum 100 kHz towards higher frequencies to align
with the channel raster.
##### 4.11.2.15.2 ANTCR9 power allocation
a) Unless otherwise stated, set each carrier to the same power so that the sum
of the carrier powers equals the rated total output power appropriate for the
test configuration according to manufacturer's declarations in subclause 4.10.
b) In case that ANTCR9 is configured for testing modulation quality, the power
allocated per carrier for the RAT on which modulation quality is measured
shall be the highest possible for the given modulation configuration according
to the manufacturer's declarations in subclause 4.10, unless that power is
higher than the level defined by case a). The power of the remaining carriers
from other RAT(s) shall be set to the same level as in case a).
If in the case of b) the power of one RAT needs to be reduced in order to meet
the manufacture's declaration the power in the other RAT(s) does not need to
be increased.
## 4.12 RF channels and test models
### 4.12.1 RF channels
For single carrier tests unless otherwise stated the tests shall be performed
with a single carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.
Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum radiated _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency
range in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~
(middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).
\- Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:
\- B~RFBW~: maximum _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.
\- M~RFBW~: maximum _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band. M~RFBW~ may be shifted
maximum 100 kHz towards lower frequencies to align carriers with the channel
raster.
\- T~RFBW~: maximum _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.
For the test of certain RF requirements the present specification refers to
test procedures defined in the single-RAT specifications [2], [3], [4], [5].
In this case, the interpretation of the RF channels to be tested shall be
according to the definitions in the corresponding single-RAT specifications
[2], [3], [4], [5].
For an operating band which has multi-band beam dependencies capable of dual-
band operation, unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at
B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ defined as following:
\- B~RFBW~_ T\'~RFBW~: the _Base Station RF Bandwidths_ located at the bottom
of the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and at the
highest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum _Radio
Bandwidth_ , in the upper operating band.
\- B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW:~ the _Base Station RF Bandwidths_ located at the top of
the supported frequency range in the upper operating band and at the lowest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum _Radio Bandwidth_
, in the lower operating band.
NOTE: B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ when the
declared maximum radiated _Radio Bandwidth_ (see table 4.10-1, D9.17) spans
both operating bands. B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ means the _Base Station RF Bandwidths_
are located at the bottom of the supported frequency range in the lower
operating band and at the top of the supported frequency range in the upper
operating band.
When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B~RFBW~,
M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in each supported operating band, the position of
B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in the supported operating band
combinations shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may consult
with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.
### 4.12.2 Test models
a) Unless otherwise stated, carriers used for transmitter tests shall be
configured as follows:
\- UTRA FDD carriers shall be configured according to TM1 as defined in TS
25.141 [10], clause 6.1.1.1.
\- UTRA TDD carriers shall be configured according to table 6.1A as defined in
TS 25.142 [11], clause 6.2.4.1.2.

## 4.13 Format and interpretation of tests
Each test in the following clauses has a standard format:
**X Title**
All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the present
document, unless otherwise stated.
**X.1 Definition and applicability**
This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under consideration
and specifies whether the test is applicable to all equipment or only to a
certain subset. Required manufacturer declarations may be included here.
**X.2 Minimum requirement**
This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference (or
core) specification which defines the minimum requirement. For each
requirement, there are separate references for MSR and single RAT, where
applicable in the core requirement. If the requirement does not apply to a
particular RAT, this is explicitly stated here (rather than through a
reference).
**X.3 Test purpose**
This clause defines the purpose of the test.
**X.4 Method of test**
**X.4.1 General**
In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial conditions. In
such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and test procedures can be
applied are stated here. In the case only one test procedure is applicable,
that is stated here.
**X.4.2y First test method**
**X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions**
This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the test
environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement set-up.
The test system is assumed to be correctly calibrated as part of the initial
conditions. Calibration is not explicitly mentioned.
**X.4.2y.2 Procedure**
This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and provides
further details of the test definition like point of access (e.g. test port),
domain (e.g. frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and
algorithms (e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise data processing of the
measurement result before comparison with the test requirement (e.g. average
result from several measurement positions).
**X.4.3y Alternative test method (if any)**
If there are alternative test methods, each is described with its initial
conditions and procedures.
**X.5 Test requirement**
This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test, see
clause 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results. Test requirements for
every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are listed here. Cases where
minimum requirements do not apply need not be mentioned.
The test requirements may be different depending on the test method applied. A
test requirement for each test method applicable to the respective MSR/Single
RAT requirement is given in separate clauses where applicable.
## 4.14 Reference coordinate system
Radiated requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic characteristics
(e.g. EIRP and EIS) at certain angles with respect to the base station. To be
able to declare radiated characteristics part of radiated requirements a
reference coordinate system is required. The reference coordinate system is
should be associated to an identifiable physical feature on the base station
enclosure.. The location of the origin and the orientation of the reference
coordinate system are for the base station manufacturer to declare.
The reference coordinate system is created of a Cartesian coordinate system
with rectangular axis (x** _,_** y** _,_** z) and spherical angles (θ, φ) as
showed in figure 4.14-1.
{width="3.9375in" height="4.072916666666667in"}
Figure 4.14-1: Reference coordinate system
φ** __** is the angle in the x/y plane, between the x-axis and the projection
of the radiating vector onto the x/y plane and is defined between -180° and
+180°, inclusive. θ** _*** is the angle between the projection of the vector
in the x_** /***y plane and the radiating vector and is defined between -90°
and +90°, inclusive. Note that θ is defined as positive along the down-tilt
angle.
## 4.15 Co-location requirements
### 4.15.1 General
Co-location requirements are requirements which are based on assuming the AAS
BS is co-located with another BS of the same base station class. They ensure
that both co-located systems can operate with minimal degradation to each
other.
The co-location requirements in Table 4.15-1-1 rely on a _co-location
reference antenna_ used to mimic a base station to base station co-location
scenario.
Table 4.15-1-1: Co-location requirements
+---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Clause number | Requirement | Co-location | Type | | | | reference | | | | | antenna | | | | | operation | | +===============+================+================+================+ | 6.5 | OTA Transmit | Measure | Mandatory | | | ON/OFF power | emission | | +---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 6.7.6.3 | OTA Spurious | Measure | Optional based | | | emission | emission | on declaration | | 6.7.6.5 | | | | +---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 6.8 | OTA | Inject the | Mandatory | | | Transmitter | interferer | | | | i | signal | | | | ntermodulation | | | +---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 7.6.3 | OTA Blocking | Inject the | Optional based | | | | interferer | on declaration | | | | signal | | +---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
The OTA Transmit ON/OFF power requirement and OTA Transmitter intermodulation
requirement are mandatory requirements where the test requirement is derived
using the _co-location reference antenna_ , which represents the worst-case
scenario.
The _co-location reference antenna_ is defined in TS 37.105[6].
### 4.15.2 Co-location test antenna
#### 4.15.2.1 General
Co-location requirements are specified as power levels into or out of the
conducted interface of the _co-location reference antenna_. For conformance
testing the requirements are translated to the input or output of a _co-
location_ test antenna (CLTA).
A CLTA is a practical antenna which can be used to test conformance to the co-
location requirements.
#### 4.15.2.2 Co-location test antenna characteristics
A co-location test antenna is a practical passive antenna that is used for
conformance testing of the co-location requirements and is based on the
definition of the _co-location reference antenna_. A CLTA shall comply to the
requirements specified in Table 4.15.2.2-1. Translation of the requirements to
other test antennas is not precuded but suitable translations between the _co-
location reference antenna_ and test antennas must be provided to demonstrate
that the method is within the specified MU.
The currently defined CLTAs are suitable for testing AAS BSs implemented with
a planar antenna array. The method for testing AAS BS with other antenna array
implementations is FFS.

# 5 Applicability of Requirements
## 5.1 General
The present clause defines for each radiated test requirement the set of
mandatory test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating
conformance for radiated requirement.
Test configurations for beams supporting multiple RAT in the tested operating
band are specified in clause 5.1.
Test configurations for radiated requirements where the operating band has
been declared to support single RAT requirements (see table 4.10-1, D9.5) by
either MSR requirements for UTRA only or E-UTRA only or with a single-RAT UTRA
requirements or single RAT E-UTRA requirements are specified in subclause 5.2.
Test configurations for an AAS BS with operating bands which have multi-band
dependencies are specified in subclause 5.3.
Requirements apply to AAS BS according to the declared RAT radiated Capability
Set (see table 4.10-1, D9.25) within each supported operating band the Band
Category of the declared operating band (see table 4.10-1, D9.4), as listed in
the heading of each table. Some RF requirements listed in the tables may not
be mandatory or they may apply only regionally. This is further specified for
each requirement in clauses 6 and 7, and in table 4.4-1.
For a declared RAT radiated Capability Set (see table 4.10-1, D9.25) in tables
5.2-1, 5.3.2-1, 5.3.3-1, 5.3.4-1, 5.4.1-1 or 5.4.2-1 only the requirements
listed in the column for that radiated Capability Set apply. Requirements
listed under RCSA other than the declared RCSA(s) need not be tested. In case
the BS is declared to support more than one CS, the tests that are common
between different supported CSs are not repeated.
An AAS BS where the operating band is declared: to support multiple RATs (MSR)
and to be capable of contiguous spectrum operation only, the test
configuration(s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 denoted by a \"C\" and entries
that refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used for testing.
An AAS BS where the operating band is declared: to support multiple RATs
(MSR), to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation (see
table 4.10-1, D9.28), where the parameters according to clause 4.10 are
identical for contiguous and non-contiguous operation (see table 4.10-1,
D9.29). Shall use for each declared operating band the test configuration(s)
in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 denoted by \"CNC\" and entries that refer to
single-RAT specifications shall be used.
An AAS BS where the operating band is declared: to support multiple RATs
(MSR), to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation (see
table 4.10-1, D9.28), where the parameters according to clause 4.10 are not
identical for contiguous and non-contiguous operation (see table 4.10-1,
D9.29). Shall use for each declared operating band the test configuration(s)
in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 denoted by \"C/NC\" and entries that refer to
single-RAT specifications shall be used.
For an AAS BS operating bands which have multi-band dependencies which is MSR
capable the applicability of the requirement for each operating band is
determined by the RAT configuration within that operating band as identified
in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1, unless otherwise stated. The testing of an AAS BS
in operating bands with multi-band dependencies which are MSR capable shall be
according to table 5.4.1-1 as follows:
\- For requirements test denoted by SBT (Single Band Test), the test
configuration (s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 shall be used for each operating
band depending on the RAT configuration within that band.
\- For requirements test denoted by MBT (Multi-Band Test), the test
configuration (s) in table 5.4.1-1 shall be used depending on the Band
Category of the declared operating band combination.
For a single--RAT UTRA only operating bands clause 5.3.3 defines for each
radiated test requirement the set of mandatory test configurations which shall
be used for demonstrating conformance. The applicable test configurations are
specified in table 5.3.3-1 for each supported RF configuration, which shall be
declared according to clause 4.10. The generation and EIRP allocation for each
test configuration is defined in clause 4.11.2.
For a single-RAT E-UTRA only operating bands clause 5.3.4 defines for each
radiated test requirement the set of mandatory test configurations which shall
be used for demonstrating conformance. The applicable test configurations are
specified in table 5.3.4-1 for each supported RF configuration, which shall be
declared according to clause 4.10. The generation and EIRP allocation for each
test configuration is defined in clause 4.11.3.
For an AAS BS operating band declared to be capable of single carrier
operation only (see table 4.10-1, D9.4), a single carrier (SC) shall be used
for testing.
In Table 5.1-1, the requirement applicability for each requirement set is
defined. For each requirement, the applicable requirement clause in the
specification is identified. Requirements not included in a requirement set is
marked not applicable (NA).

## 5.3 Test configurations for multi-carrier capable AAS BS in operating bands
where one RAT capability sets are supported
### 5.3.1 General
An AAS BS may support only one RAT operation in an operating band by
fulfilling different sets of requirements. Both UTRA and E-UTRA have two
complete sets of requirements that may be fulfilled depending on whether the
beam is declared to be MSR or single RAT in the operating band. MSR and single
RAT requirements are addressed separately by separate test requirements (and
corresponding core requirements). They are also identified by different
capability sets as described in clauses 4.11 and 5.2.
### 5.3.2 AAS BS supporting one RAT only MSR in the operating band
This clause contains test configuration applicability to requirements and
capability sets for AAS BS supporting one RAT only MSR operation operating
with multiple carriers (MC).

# 6 Radiated transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configuration for testing. AAS BS
configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.8.
If beams have been declared equivalent and parallel (see table 4.10-1, D9.12,
D9.13), only a representative beam is necessary to be tested to demonstrate
conformance. _The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported
geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of supported
geographical cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS setting with the minimum
amount of cell splitting supported._
_OTA AAS BS transmitter requirements apply per geographical cell._
Any radiated transmitter test requirement specified in TS 37.105 [6] is not
applicable for AAS BS operation in Band 46.
_For OTA base station output power (clause 6.3), OTA transmit ON/OFF power
(clause 6.5), OTA unwanted emissions requirements (clause 6.7) and OTA
receiver spurious emissions (clause 7.7), TRP is defined in spherical
coordinates as:_
, where P~D~(r,θ,ϕ) is the power density in W/m^2^ of two orthogonal
polarizations at a distance r (meters).
NOTE: General TRP expression that is obtained by integrating the Poynting
vector over a spherical surface.
## 6.2 Radiated Transmit Power
### 6.2.1 Definition and applicability
This is an output power accuracy requirement defined at the RIB during the
_transmitter ON period_.
An AAS BS is declared to support one or more beams. Radiated transmit power is
defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam at a specific _beam peak
direction_.
For each beam, the requirement is based on declarations (see table 4.10-1) of
a beam identifier (D9.3), _reference beam direction pair_ (D9.7), _rated beam
EIRP_ (D9.10) at the _reference beam direction pair_ , _OTA peak directions
set_ (D9.8), the _beam direction pairs_ at the maximum steering directions
(D9.9) and their associated _rated beam EIRP_ and _beamwidth(s)_ (D9.11) for
_reference beam direction pair_ and maximum steering directions.
For a declared beam identifier and _beam direction pair_ , the _rated beam
EIRP_ level is the maximum power that the base station is declared to radiate
at the associated _beam peak direction_ during the _transmitter ON period_.
For each _beam peak direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within
the _OTA peak directions set_ , a specific _rated beam EIRP_ level may be
claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy requirement as
described below. _Rated beam EIRP_ is only required to be declared for the
_beam direction pairs_ subject to conformance testing as detailed in clause
6.2.4.1.
NOTE 1: The _OTA peak directions set_ for a beam is the complete continuous or
discrete set of all _beam direction_ for which the EIRP accuracy is intended
to be achieved for the beam.
NOTE 2: A _beam direction pair_ consists of a _beam centre direction_ and an
associated _beam peak direction_.
NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer for
verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the manufacturer to
the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment and is not subject to
formal conformance testing.
For _operating bands_ where the supported _fractional bandwidth_ (FBW) is
larger than 6%, two rated carrier EIRP may be declared by manufacturer:
\- P~rated,c,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and
\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.
For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated carrier EIRP is:
\- P~rated,c,FBWlow,~ for the carrier whose carrier frequency is within
frequency range F~FBWlow~ ≤ f \ 20 | > 20 | +----------+----------+----------+-----+-----+----------+----------+ | Span | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | $$2 \ti | {w | | | | | | | text{Cha | idth="0. | | | | | | | nnel}}$$ | 96875in" | | | | | | | | height= | | | | | | | | "0.23958 | | | | | | | | 33333333 | | | | | | | | 3334in"} | +----------+----------+----------+-----+-----+----------+----------+ | Minimum | 400 | 400 | 400 | 400 | $$\left | ![] | | number | | | | | \lceil \ | (media/i | | of | | | | | frac{2 \ | mage18.w | | mea | | | | | times \t | mf){widt | | surement | | | | | ext{BW}_ | h="1.239 | | points | | | | | {\text{C | 58333333 | | | | | | | hannel}} | 33333in" | | | | | | | }{100kHz | height | | | | | | | } \right | ="0.4791 | | | | | | | \rceil$$ | 66666666 | | | | | | | | 6667in"} | +----------+----------+----------+-----+-----+----------+----------+
7) Compute the total of the EIRP, P0, (in power units, not decibel units) of
all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1, the EIRP
outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the total EIRP
outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied percentage)) of P0.
For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005 times P0. Measure the EIRP
for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total
radiated transmit power for particular _beam direction pair_ as EIRP =
EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.
8) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all EIRP in the
measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds P1.
9) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all EIRP in the
measurement cells from the end of the span to f2 exceeds P1.
10) Compute the OTA occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.
In addition, for _multi-band RIB(s)_ , the following steps shall apply:
11) For _multi-band RIBs_ and single band tests, repeat the steps 6) - 10)
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.
#### 6.7.2.5 Test Requirement

the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test is defined in clause 4.1.2 and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in annex C.
### 6.7.3 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio
#### 6.7.3.1 Definition and applicability
OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean
power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The measured power is TRP.

##### 6.7.3.4.2 Procedure
##### 6.7.3.4.2.1 General Procedure {#general-procedure-3 .H6}
The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional power
measurements as described in in Annex F. An alternative method to measure TRP
is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber. If so, follow
steps 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9. When calibrated and operated within the guidance of
3GPP TR 37.941 [38] the measurement methods are applicable and selected
depending on availability at the test facility.
1) Place the AAS BS at the positioner.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see table
4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.
3) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:
\- measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.7.3.5.
\- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.
The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to
ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.
4) For single carrier operation, set the AAS BS to transmit according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test
model(s) in clause 4.12.2 at manufacturers declared _rated carrier TRP_
(P~rated,c,TRP~).
For an AAS BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation use
the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clause 4.11.
5) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be tested
aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be
performed (see annex F).
6) Measure the absolute total power of the assigned channel frequency and the
(adjacent channel frequency)
7) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement grid
needed for TRP~Estimate~ for each of the assigned channel frequency and the
adjacent channel frequency (see Annex F).
8) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ for the absolute total radiated power of the wanted
channel and the adjacent channel and the ACLR estimate using the measurements
made in Step 7.
9) Calculate relative ACLR estimate.
NOTE 1: ACLR is calculated by the ratio of the absolute TRP of the assigned
channel frequency and the absolute TRP of the adjacent frequency channel.
NOTE 2: For FR1 the measurement uncertainty of the reverberation chamber for
the relative ACLR is higher than the measurement uncertainty in clause 4.1.2
the test requirements in Table 6.7.3.5.1-1 shall be tightened following the
procedure in clause 4.1.3.
##### 6.7.3.4.2.2 MSR {#msr-2 .H6}
1) For E-UTRA and NR, measure OTA ACLR:
\- outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges;
\- inside sub-block gap for non-contiguous spectrum operation as specified in
clause 6.7.3.5.1.1;
\- inside Inter RF Bandwidth gap for multi-band operation.
2) For UTRA FDD, measure ACLR inside sub-block gap or Inter RF Bandwidth gap
as specified in clause 6.7.3.5.1.2.
3) Measure Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) inside sub-
block gap or the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ as specified in clause 6.7.3.5.1.3.
In addition, for _multi-band RIB_ , the following steps shall apply:
4) For _multi-band RIB_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
##### 6.7.3.4.2.3 UTRA FDD {#utra-fdd-6 .H6}
1) Measure OTA ACLR for 5 MHz and 10 MHz offsets both side of channel
frequency. In multiple carrier case only offset frequencies below the lowest
and above the highest carrier frequency used shall be measured.
2) For the OTA ACLR requirement applied inside sub-block gap for non-
contiguous spectrum operation or inside _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ for multi-
band operation:
a) Measure OTA ACLR inside sub-block gap or _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ as
specified in clause 6.7.3.5.2.1, if applicable.
b) Measure OTA CACLR inside sub-block gap or _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ as
specified in clause 6.7.3.5.2.2, if applicable.
In addition, for _multi-band RIB_ , the following steps shall apply:
3) For _multi-band RIB_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
##### 6.7.3.4.2.4 E-UTRA {#e-utra-4 .H6}
1) Measure OTA ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of channel frequency
as specified in table 6.7.3.5.3.1-1 (Paired spectrum case) or Table
6.7.3.5.3.1-2 (Unpaired spectrum case) respectively. In multiple carrier case
only offset frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier
frequency used shall be measured.
2) For the OTA ACLR requirement applied inside sub-block gap for non-
contiguous spectrum operation: or inside _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ for multi-
band operation:
a) Measure OTA ACLR inside sub-block gap or _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ as
specified in clause 6.7.3.5.3.1, if applicable.
b) Measure OTA CACLR inside sub-block gap or _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ as
specified in clause 6.7.3.5.3.2, if applicable.
3) Repeat the test with the channel set-up according to E- TM1.2 in clause
4.12.2.
In addition, for _multi-band RIB(s)_ , the following steps shall apply:
4) For _multi-band RIB_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
#### 6.7.3.5 Test Requirement

requirement for the second adjacent channel applies inside any _Inter RF
Bandwidth gap_ with a gap size W~gap~ ≥ 20 MHz. The OTA CACLR requirement in
clause 6.7.3.5.3.2 applies in _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_ s for the frequency
ranges defined in Table 6.7.3.5.3.2-1.
The requirement applies during the transmitter on period.
The OTA ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal (BW~Config~)
centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter centred on the adjacent
channel frequency according to the tables below.
For operation in paired spectrum, the measurement result shall not be less

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, except
for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in Band
25/n25, Band 27, Band 28/n28 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in
table 6.7.6.4.5.1.1-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~ frequency range
immediately outside the _downlink operating band_ (see clause 6.7.1). Emission
limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional
requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.4.5.1.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in clause 4.7 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the
same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III or E-UTRA Band 3 or NR
band n3 in China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection
requirements are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz respectively.
NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are
synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without
additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations (except
in Band 46), special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered
by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 6: For Band 28/n28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL operating
band.
NOTE 7: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII, E-UTRA
Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or
E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the _downlink operating
band_ and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the _downlink
operating band_.

Note: The regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC reference
document, 0007135419, are defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic
radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna
connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The
method outlined in TS 37.105 [6], Annex B1 indicates how the limit in table
6.7.6.4.5.1.1-10 demonstrates compliance to the regional requirement.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, except
for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in Band 25,
Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in table
6.7.6.4.5.3-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately
outside the _downlink operating band_ (see clause 6.7.1). Emission limits for
this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional
requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.4.5.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in clause 4.7 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the
same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III or E-UTRA Band 3 in
China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection requirements
are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz respectively.
NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are
synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without
additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations (except
in Band 46), special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered
by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 6: For Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL operating
band.
NOTE 7: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA
Band 12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 85
UL operating band.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the _downlink operating
band_ and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the _downlink
operating band_.

Note: The regional requirements specified in attachment to the FCC reference
document, 0007135419, are defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic
radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna
connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The
method outlined in TS 37.105 [6], Annex B1 indicates how the limit in table
6.7.6.4.5.3-11 demonstrates compliance to the regional requirement.
#### 6.7.6.5 Co-location with other base stations
##### 6.7.6.5.1 Definition and applicability
##### 6.7.6.5.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement for AAS BS in _MSR operation_ is defined in TS 37.105
[6], clause 9.7.6.2.
The minimum requirement for AAS BS in _single RAT UTRA operation_ is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 9.7.6.3.
The minimum requirement for AAS BS in _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 9.7.6.4.
##### 6.7.6.5.3 Test purpose
The test purpose of OTA spurious emission is to verify the radiated spurious
emissions from the AAS BS at the _RIB_ are within specified requirements.
For OTA co-location spurious emission, the test purpose is to verify that the
emission is within the specified requirement limits at the CLTA conducted
output(s).
##### 6.7.6.5.4 Method of test
##### 6.7.6.5.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-19 .H6}
See clause 6.7.6.3.4.1.
##### 6.7.6.5.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-19 .H6}
See clause 6.7.6.3.4.2.
##### 6.7.6.5.5 Test Requirement
##### 6.7.6.5.5.1 MSR operation {#msr-operation-3 .H6}
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA
and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume with base stations of the same class.
NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location
with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.
The requirements are co-location emission requirements are specified as the
power sum of the supported polarization(s) at the CLTA conducted output(s).
The output of the CLTA of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of
table 6.7.6.5.5.1-1 for a AAS BS where requirements for co-location with a BS
type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station
class. For a _multi-band RIB_ , the exclusions and conditions in the notes
column of table 6.7.6.5.5.1-1 apply for each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in table 6.7.6.5.3.5-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
_downlink operating band_ (see clause 6.7.1). The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However,
there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [31].
NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.5.3.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in clause 4.6 would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case
of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical
area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
##### 6.7.6.5.5.2 Single RAT UTRA operation {#single-rat-utra-operation-3 .H6}
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume with base stations of the same class.
NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location
with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.
The requirements are co-location emission requirements and specified as the
power sum of the supported polarization(s) at the CLTA conducted output(s).
The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations at the conducted output(s) of the CLTA and shall not exceed the
limits of table 6.7.6.5.5.2-1 for a AAS BS where requirements for co-location
with a BS type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared
Base Station class. For a _multi-band RIB_ , the exclusions and conditions in
the Notes column of table 6.7.6.5.5.2-1 apply for each supported operating
band.

location requirements in table 6.7.6.5.2.5-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
_downlink operating band_ (see clause 6.7.1). The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However,
there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [31].
NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.5.2.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in clause 4.6 would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case
of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical
area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
##### 6.7.6.5.5.3 Single RAT E-UTRA operation {#single-rat-e-utra-operation-3
.H6}
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume co-location with base stations of the same class.
NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on co-location
with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.
The requirements are co-location emission requirements and specified as the
power sum of the supported polarization(s) at the CLTA conducted output(s).
The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations at the conducted output(s) of the CLTA and shall not exceed the
limits of table 6.7.6.5.5.3-1 for a AAS BS where requirements for co-location
with a BS type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared
Base Station class. For a _multi-band RIB_ , the exclusions and conditions in
the notes column of table 6.7.6.5.5.3-1 apply for each supported operating
band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in table 6.7.6.5.3.5-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
_downlink operating band_ (see clause 6.7.1). The current state-of-the-art
technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location with other
system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However,
there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [31].
NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.5.3.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in clause 4.6 would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case
of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical
area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
## 6.8 OTA Transmitter intermodulation
### 6.8.1 Definition and applicability
The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability
of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and antenna array from a co-located
base station. The requirement applies during the _transmitter ON period_ and
the _transmitter transient period_.
The requirement applies at each RIB supporting transmission in the operating
band.
The transmitter intermodulation level is the _total radiated power_ of the
intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the CLTA.
For _OTA_ _AAS BS_ , the transmitter intermodulation requirement is captured
by the co-location transmitter intermodulation scenario case, in which the
interfering signal is injected into the CLTA.
### 6.8.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement for AAS BS in _MSR operation_ is defined in TS 37.105
[6], clause 9.8.2.
The minimum requirement for AAS BS in _single RAT UTRA operation_ is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 9.8.3.
The minimum requirement for AAS BS in _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 9.8.4.
### 6.8.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units associated
with the _RIB_ under test to restrict the generation of intermodulation
products in its nonlinear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and antenna
array from a co-located base station to below specified levels.

#### 6.8.4.2 Procedure
1) Select a CLTA according to parameters given in Table 4.15.2.2-1.
2) Place the CLTA according to parameters given in Table 4.15.2.3-1.
3) The test antenna(s) shall be dual (or single) polarized covering the same

the procedure described in Annex F.
8) The measurement device (signal analyzer) characteristics shall be:
\- Detection mode: True RMS.
\- The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to
ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.
9) Set the _AAS BS_ to transmit:
a) For MSR:
\- Set the _AAS BS_ to transmit maximum power according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models or set of
physical channels in clause 4.11.
b) For UTRA FDD:

but exclude interfering frequencies that are outside of the allocated downlink
operating band or interfering frequencies that are not completely within the
sub-block gap or within the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_.
b) For UTRA FDD:
\- in accordance to TM1, clause 4.12.2 with a frequency offset according to
the conditions of table 6.8.5.2.1-1, but exclude interfering signal
frequencies that are outside of the allocated downlink operating band or

allocated downlink operating band or interfering frequencies that are not
completely within the sub-block gap or within the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_.
11) Connect the interfering signal to the CLTA input interfaces, equally
dividing the power among supported polarizations. Adjust the interfering
signal level at the CLTA conducted input(s) as defined in:
a) For MSR:
i. General co-location table 6.8.5.1.1-1.
ii. Additional co-location (BC1 and BC2) table 6.8.5.1.2-1.
iii. Additional co-location (BC3) table 6.8.5.1.3-1.
b) For UTRA FDD:
i. General co-location table 6.8.5.2.1-1 .
c) For E-UTRA:
i. General co-location table 6.8.5.3.1-1.
ii. Void
12) If the interfering signal is applicable according to clause 5, perform the
unwanted emission tests specified in clauses 6.7.3 (OTA ACLR), 6.7.4 (OTA
spectrum mask) and 6.7.5 (OTA OBUE), for all third and fifth order
intermodulation products which appear in the frequency ranges defined in
clauses 6.7.3, 6.7.4 and 6.7.5 (NOTE 2). The width of the intermodulation
products shall be taken into account.
13) If the interfering signal is applicable according to clause 5, perform the
transmitter spurious emissions test as specified in clause 6.7.6 (OTA spurious
emission), except OTA co-location spurious emission, for all third and fifth
order intermodulation products which appear in the frequency ranges defined in
clause 6.7.6 (NOTE 2). The width of the intermodulation products shall be
taken into account.
14) Verify that the emission level does not exceed the required level in
clause 6.8.5 (Test requirements) with the exception of interfering signal
frequencies.
15) Repeat the test for the remaining interfering signal centre frequency
offsets according to the conditions of:
a) For MSR:
i. General co-location table 6.8.5.1.1-1.
ii. Additional co-location (BC1 and BC2) table 6.8.5.1.2-1.
iii. Additional co-location (BC3) table 6.8.5.1.3-1.
b) For UTRA FDD:
i. General co-location table 6.8.5.2.1-1 .
c) For E-UTRA:
i. General co-location table 6.8.5.3.1-1.

and 6.7.6 (OTA spurious emission), except OTA co-location spurious emission.
In addition, for _multi-band AAS BS,_ the following steps shall apply:
17) For _multi-band AAS BS_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
NOTE 1: The third order intermodulation products are centred at 2F1±F2 and
2F2±F1. The fifth order intermodulation products are centred at 3F1±2F2,
3F2±2F1, 4F1±F2, and 4F2±F1 where F1 represents the test signal centre
frequency or centre frequency of each sub-block and F2 represents the
interfering signal centre frequency. The widths of intermodulation products
are:
\- (n*BW~F1~ + m*BW~F2~) for the nF1±mF2 products;
\- (n*BW~F2~ + m*BW~F1~) for the nF2±mF1 products;
where BW~F1~ represents the test signal RF bandwidth or channel bandwidth in
case of single carrier, or sub-block bandwidth, and BW~F2~ represents the
interfering signal bandwidth.
NOTE 2: During the conformance test the interfering signal can be applied on
one side of the wanted signal, while the transmitter intermodulation emission
is measured only on the opposite side of the wanted signal. This applies for
intermodulation products which are within the operating band or OBUE region.
### 6.8.5 Test Requirement
#### 6.8.5.1 MSR test requirements
##### 6.8.5.1.1 General test requirement
In the frequency range relevant for this test the transmitter intermodulation
level shall not exceed the unwanted emission limits specified for transmitter
spurious emission in clause 6.7.6 (except co-location spurious emission),
operating band unwanted emission in clause 6.7.5 and ACLR in clause 6.7.3 in
the presence of a wanted signal and an interfering signal according to table
6.8.5.1.1-1 for an _OTA AAS BS_ operating in BC1, BC2 and BC3.
The requirement is applicable outside the edges of the _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges_ or _radio bandwidth_ edges.
For _RIB_ supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , the requirement
is also applicable inside a _sub-block gap_ for interfering signal offsets
where the interfering signal falls completely within the _sub-block gap_. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _sub-block_ edges.
For _multi-band RIBs_ , the requirement applies relative to the _Base Station
RF Bandwidth edges_ of each operating band. In case the inter _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ gap is less than 15 MHz, the requirement in the gap applies only
for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the inter _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ gap.

the presence of a wanted signal and an interfering signal according to table
6.8.5.1.2-1 for an _OTA AAS BS_ operating in BC2.
The requirement is applicable outside the edges of the _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ for BC2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
_Base Station RF Bandwidth edges_.
For _RIBs_ supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ in BC1 or BC2,
the requirement is also applicable inside a _sub-block gap_ with a gap size
larger than or equal to two times the interfering signal centre frequency
offset. For _RIBs_ supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ in BC1,
the requirement is not applicable inside a _sub-block gap_ with a gap size
equal to or larger than 5 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the _sub-block_ edges.
For _multi-band RIBs_ , the requirement applies relative to the _Base Station
RF Bandwidth edges_ of a BC2 operating band. The requirement is also
applicable for BC1 and BC2 inside an inter _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ gap
equal to or larger than two times the interfering signal centre frequency
offset. For _RIBs_ supporting operation in multiple operating bands, the
requirement is not applicable for BC1 band inside an inter _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ gap with a gap size equal to or larger than 5 MHz.

Table 6.8.5.3.2-1: Void
# 7 Radiated receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
OTA receiver characteristics requirements apply to the _AAS BS_ including all
its functional components active unless otherwise stated in each requirement.
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 7 apply during the AAS BS
_receive period._
The requirements in clause 7 shall be met for any transmitter setting.
The (E-UTRA) throughput requirements defined for the receiver characteristics
in this clause do not assume HARQ retransmissions.
When the AAS BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the throughput
requirements are applicable for each received carrier.
Any radiated receiver test requirement specified in TS 37.105 [6] is not
applicable for AAS BS operation in Band 46.
Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.
For requirements which are to be met over the _OTA REFSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10*log10(BeW~θ,REFSENS*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB) for the
reference direction.
And
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10*log10(BeW~θ,REFSENS*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB) for all
other directions.
For requirements which are to be met over the _minSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)
## 7.2 OTA sensitivity
### 7.2.1 Definition and applicability
The OTA sensitivity requirement is based upon the declaration of one or more
_OTA sensitivity direction declarations_ (OSDD), related to an _AAS BS
receiver_.
The _AAS BS receiver_ may optionally be capable of redirecting/changing the
_receiver target_ by means of adjusting BS settings resulting in multiple
_sensitivity RoAoA_. The _sensitivity RoAoA_ resulting from the current AAS BS
settings is the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
If the AAS BS is capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the
OSDD then the OSDD shall include:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _Channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to any active _sensitivity RoAoA_ inside the _receiver target
redirection range_ in the OSDD.
\- A declared _receiver target redirection range_ , describing all the angles
of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative settings in
the _AAS BS_.
\- Five declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in [7].
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 1: Some of the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ may coincide depending on the
redirection capability.
NOTE 2: In addition to the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ , several _sensitivity
RoAoA_ may be implicitly defined by the _receiver target redirection range_
without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.
NOTE 3: (Void)
If the _AAS BS_ is not capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to
the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _Channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to the _sensitivity RoAoA_ in the OSDD.
\- One declared active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 4: For _AAS BS_ without target redirection capability, the declared
(fixed) _sensitivity RoAoA_ is always the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 7.2.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement for MSR & NR operation is in TS 37.105 [6], clause
10.2.2.
For AAS BS in _single RAT UTRA operation_ the minimum requirement is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 10.2.3.
For AAS BS in _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ the minimum requirement is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 10.2.4.

#### 7.7.4.2 Procedure
The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional power
measurements as described in Annex F. An alternative method to measure TRP is
to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber. If so, follow
steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. When calibrated and operated within the guidance
of 3GPP TR 37.941 [38] the measurement methods are applicable and selected
depending on availability at the test facility.
1) Place the AAS BS at the positioner.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see table

4.1.2.3-1.
5) Set the TDD AAS BS to receive only
6) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be tested
aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be

measurement bandwidth
8) Repeat step 6-9 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement grid
needed for full TRP estimation (see annex F).

## 7.8 OTA Receiver intermodulation
### 7.8.1 Definition and applicability
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver unit to
receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
two interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the
wanted signal.
The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of a
received signal and the interfering signal are from the same direction, and:
\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~ : the AoA of the incident
wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within the OTA
REFSENS _RoAoA._
\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~ : the AoA of the incident
wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within the _minSENS
RoAoA_.
The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization, under
the assumption of _polarization match_.

For AAS BS in _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ the minimum requirement is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 10.8.4.
### 7.8.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the receiver to inhibit the
generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear elements caused by
the presence of two high-level interfering signals at frequencies with a
specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted signal.

involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
### 7.8.5 Test Requirement
#### 7.8.5.1 MSR operation
##### 7.8.5.1.1 General intermodulation test requirement
Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA, NR or UTRA signal as
specified in TS 37.104 [5], annex A.
The requirement is applicable outside the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ or
_Radio Bandwidth_. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
_Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ or _Radio Bandwidth_ edges.
For _multi-band RIBs_ , the requirement applies in addition inside any _Inter
RF Bandwidth gap_ at those connectors, in case the gap size is at least twice
as wide as the UTRA/E-UTRA interfering signal centre frequency offset from the
_Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edge_. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ _edges_ inside the _Inter RF
Bandwidth gap_.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals at the RIB, using the parameters in tables 7.8.5.1.1-1 and
7.8.5.1.1-2, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the _maximum
throughput_ of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104 [4],
clause 7.2.1.
\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 [2], clause 7.2.1.
\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the _maximum
throughput_ of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 38.104 [33],
clause 7.2.2.
The OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets Δ~OTAREFSENS~
and Δ~minSENS~.

#### 7.8.5.3 Single RAT E- UTRA operation
For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the _maximum throughput_ of the
reference measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned channel
frequency and two interfering signals at the RIB, with the conditions
specified in tables 7.8.5.3-1 and 7.8.5.3-2 for intermodulation performance
and in tables 7.8.5.3-3, 7.8.5.3-4, and 7.8.5.3-5 for narrowband
intermodulation performance. Narrowband intermodulation requirements are not
applied for Band 46. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal
is identified in table 10.8.4-1 to 6 for each _channel bandwidth_ and further
specified in TS 36.104 [4] Annex A.
The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the _Base
Station RF Bandwidth_ or _Radio Bandwidth edges_. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the _Base Station RF Bandwidth edges_ or _Radio
Bandwidth edges_.
For RIB supporting operation in _non-contiguous spectrum_ within each
supported operating band, the requirement applies in addition inside any _sub-
block gap_ in case the _sub-block gap_ is at least as wide as the _channel
bandwidth_ of the E-UTRA interfering signal in table 7.8.5.3-3. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _sub-block_ edges inside
the _sub-block gap_.
For _multi-band RIBs_ , the intermodulation requirement applies in addition
inside any _Inter RF Bandwidth gap,_ in case the gap size is at least as wide
as the E-UTRA interfering signal centre frequency offset from the _Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge_.
For _multi-band RIBs_ , the narrowband intermodulation requirement applies in
addition inside any _Inter RF Bandwidth gap,_ in case the gap size is at least
as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal in tables 7.8.5.3-3, 7.8.5.3-4 and
7.8.5.3-5. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the _Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges_ inside the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_.
The OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets Δ~OTAREFSENS~
and Δ~minSENS~.

## 7.9 OTA In-channel selectivity
### 7.9.1 Definition and applicability
In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver unit ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in the
presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power spectral density.
In this condition a throughput requirement shall be met for a specified
reference measurement channel.
The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of a
received signal and the interfering signal are from the same direction and are
within the _minSENS RoAoA_.
The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization, under
the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 7.9.2 Minimum Requirement
For AAS BS in _MSR operation_ the minimum requirement is defined in TS 37.105
[6], clause 10.9.2.
For AAS BS in _single RAT UTRA operation_ the minimum requirement is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 10.9.3.
For AAS BS in _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ the minimum requirement is defined
in TS 37.105 [6], clause 10.9.4.
### 7.9.3 Test purpose

Where due to practical reasons such as time constraints or turn-table
precision, measurement with the reference steps is not practical, sparser
grids can be used. Use of sparse grids can lead to errors in TRP assessment.
In order to characterize these errors, the SF (sparsity factor) of the grid is
defined as:
$SF = max(\frac{\Delta u_{\text{grid}}}{\Delta u_{\text{ref}}},\frac{\Delta
v_{\text{grid}}}{\Delta v_{\text{ref}}})$
Where $\Delta u_{\text{grid}}$and $\Delta v_{\text{grid}}$ are the actual
steps used in the wave vector space in the measurement and the upper bound of
their value is 15 degrees.
# F.7 Orthogonal 2 cuts with pattern multiplication
This method can be used when the antenna symmetries are compatible with
pattern multiplication, see Clause F.1.2.4. The procedure is as follows:
1\. Calculate the reference angular steps as described in Clause F.1.2.
2\. Align the EUT to allow for proper pattern multiplication. See Clause F.5.
Measure EIRP on two orthogonal cuts with steps smaller or equal to the
reference steps according to step 1.
3\. Apply pattern multiplication according to Clause F.5 to extrapolate the
two cuts data to full-sphere.
4\. Apply numerical integration to obtain the TRP estimate as described in
Clause F.5.
# F.8 Void
# F.9 Full sphere with sparse sampling
The procedure is as follows:
1\. Set the angular grid:
a. Non-harmonic frequencies: choose the angular steps $\Delta\phi$ and
$\Delta\theta$ smaller than or equal to 15 degrees. Calculate the sparsity
factor (SF) as
$SF = \max\left(
\frac{\Delta\phi}{\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}},\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}}
\right)$
and the correction factor as:
$\text{ΔTRP} = \frac{SF - 1}{SF_{\max} - 1} \cdot 1.0\ dB,$
where $SF_{\max}$ _corresponds to 15 degrees angular step._ If the sparsity
factor is smaller than 1, the correction factor ΔTRP is 0 dB.
b. Harmonic frequencies with fixed beam test signal: choose the angular steps
smaller than or equal to the reference angular steps $\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$
and $\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}$. Correction factor ΔTRP is 0 dB.
c. Harmonic frequencies with beam sweeping test signal: set the angular steps
to 15 degrees. Correction factor is ΔTRP 0 dB.
2\. Apply a suitable numerical integration to calculate the TRP estimate.
3\. Add the appropriate correction factor ΔTRP according to step 1 to ensure
an overestimation with 95% confidence.
4\. Compare the (TRP estimate + ΔTRP) with the limit. If the (TRP estimate +
ΔTRP) is above the limit, choose a smaller angular step and repeat steps 2-4.
If the sparsity factor is less than one, no significant improvement of
accuracy is expected.
# F.10 Beam-based directions
Beam-based direction can be used in the base station operating band only if
the directivity of the radiation pattern of the emssions being measured is
known._band_. TRP~Estimate~ is defined as:
$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} =
\frac{\text{EIRP}_{\text{peak}}}{D_{\text{EUT}}}$,
where $\text{EIRP}_{\text{peak}}$ is the maximum EIRP in the _beam peak
direction_ within a particular _beam direction pair_ and $D_{\text{EUT}}$ is
directivity of the EUT antenna.
# F.11 Peak method
The peak method can be used when frequencies with unwanted peak emissions are
identified during pre-scan. The method does not provide an estimate of TRP.
For each peak emission frequency identified during pre-scan, measure peak EIRP
or power density as follows:
1\. Move EUT and test antenna to the same position where the peak emission is
recorded during the pre-scan.
2\. Move the EUT around the position and test antenna orientation to find the
final peak EIRP or power density.
3\. The measured peak power density or EIRP shall be used to demonstrate
conformance.
NOTE: Peak EIRP is the linear sum of two orthogonal polarised components.
# F.12 Equal sector with peak average
Equal sector with peak average can be performed on frequencies with unwanted
peak emission, which are considered by the peak method for further
measurements.
The spherical angle $\phi$ is divided into K equal sectors. If the largest
dimension of EUT is less than 60 cm, then each sector is a half quadrant of
45°.
For each peak emission frequency, measure peak EIRP of beams belonging to
different sectors of the sphere as follows:
1\. Move EUT and test antenna to the same position where the emission peak is
recorded during the pre-scan.
2\. Move EUT around the position and test antenna orientation to find the
final peak EIRP.
3\. Repeat Steps 1 to 2 until all sectors are covered.
4\. Calculate TRP~Estimate~ as:
$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\text{EIRP}_{k}$,
where $\text{EIRP}_{k}$ is the peak EIRP in the kth sector.
NOTE: Peak EIRP is the linear sum of two orthogonal polarised components.
# F.13 Pre-scan
Pre-scan is used to identify frequencies with unwanted emission power levels
above a certain threshold. The pre-scan does not provide an estimate of TRP.
An emission frequency identified by a pre-scan may be further investigated by
any of the TRP measurement methods in this annex.
The procedure for pre-scan is as follows:
1\. Scan the entire surface around EUT.
2\. Rotate test antenna to cover all possible polarisations of emissions to
detect maximum emissions.
3\. Record the list of frequencies and corresponding unwanted emission power
levels, EUT spatial positions, and test antenna polarization for which the
maximum emission levels occur.
4\. Emissions which are 20 dB or more below the specified limit shall not
require further measurements.

of IEC 60068-2-6 [27]. Other environmental conditions shall be within the
ranges specified in annex G.2.
NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in to
equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should only
vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.
# G.5 Power supply
When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test shall
be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating voltage
defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
**Upper voltage limit:**
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and
maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, to
the methods described in IEC 60068-2-1 [25] Test Ab/Ad and IEC 60068-2-2 [26]
Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.
**Lower voltage limit:**
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and
maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, to
the methods described in IEC 60068-2-1 [25] Test Ab/Ad and IEC 60068-2-2 [26]
Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.
# G.6 Measurement of test environments
The measurement accuracy of the BS test environments shall be:
Pressure: ±5 kPa.
Temperature: ±2 degrees.
Relative Humidity: ±5 %.
DC Voltage: ±1,0 %.
AC Voltage: ±1,5 %.
Vibration: 10 %.
Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz.
The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.
# G.7 OTA extreme test methods
## G.7.1 Direct far field method
The AAS BS under test is placed inside a sealed RF transparent environmental
enclosure , as showed in Figure G.7.1-1. This is connected to an environment
control system which regulates the temperature inside the enclosure. The
remaining equipment inside the OTA chamber (any suitable antenna test range
chamber type is acceptable) is outside the environmental control and is at
nominal temperature. Positioners, test antennas and all other OTA test
equipment do not need to be specified over the extreme temperature range.

Figure G.7.1-1: Measurement set up for Extreme conditions for EIRP accuracy
using direct far field method
The presence of the environmental chamber inside the OTA chamber may affect
the measurement accuracy due to additional reflections and refractions, also
the loss through the environmental enclosure may not be consistent with
direction as the path through the radome may vary with angle. Hence the system
should be calibrated in all tested directions.
NOTE. Currently only a single direction is specified for extreme testing so a
single calibration direction is sufficient.
Conformance may be demonstrated by measuring the difference between the
nominal measurement and the extreme measurement (Δ~sample~) or by measuring
P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ directly.
Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and
calculate total radiated transmit power for particular _beam direction pair_
as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.
## G.7.2 Relative method
The AAS BS under test is placed inside a small (compared to a far field
chamber) anechoic chamber which is both RF a screened and suitable for
environmental conditioning. The RF conditionals inside the chamber are
absorptive and capable of dissipating the power the AAS BS when radiating. A
sample antenna or RF probe are placed in a location which gives a sample of
the main beam EIRP but does not have to accurately measure the EIRP directly,
instead the near-field response is measured. For this method test components
are exposed to the full temperature range for example the test antenna/probe,
cables, absorbers etc. may change as a function of temperature.
Using the relative method it is also necessary to measure the EIRP under
nominal conditions using an appropriately calibrated far field (or near field)
test range to obtain P~max,c,EIRP~.

Figure F.7.2-1: Measurement set up for Extreme conditions for EIRP accuracy
using difference method
Measurements from the test antenna/ probe are taken under nominal conditions
and extreme conditions to calculate (Δ~sample~). The difference between the
nominal and extreme conditions (Δ~sample~) is then used along with the nominal
EIRP measurement (P~max,c,EIRP~) made in the appropriate far field or near
field chamber and compared against the extreme requirement. As follows:
P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ = P~max,c,EIRP~ + Δ~sample~.
Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and
calculate total radiated transmit power for particular _beam direction pair_
as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.
###### ## Annex H (informative): Measuring noise close to noise-floor
As the emission level seen by the measurement receiver (_P~UEM~_) for co-
location requirements are very low, it is suggested to measure relative noise
change instead of absolute noise level. The relations between measured noise
change _δ~1~_ , noise floor N~0~ and the relation to _P~UEM~_ with respect to
the noise floor denoted _δ~2~_ is visualized in Figure H-1.

height="2.1770833333333335in"}
Figure H-1: Relative noise measurement
The absolute emission level in decibel scale is calculated as:
{width="1.0729166666666667in" height="0.25in"}, where _N~0~_ is the noise
floor of the measurement receiver and _δ~2~_ is plotted s function of _δ~1~_
in Figure H-1. The absolute noise floor of the measurement receiver, including
probe antenna, cables, filter and LNA is determined by a calibration
procedure. The calibration will determine the absolute emission level (_N~0~_)
accuracy of measuring out-of-band unwanted emission close to the thermal noise
floor.
