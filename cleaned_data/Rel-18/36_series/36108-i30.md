# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship with other core specifications
The present document is a single-RAT specification for a SAN, covering RF
characteristics and minimum performance requirements. Conducted and radiated
core requirements are defined for the SAN architectures and SAN types defined
in clause 4.3.
The applicability of each requirement is described in clause 4.6.
## 4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling the
test requirements specified in the conformance specification TS 36.181 [3].
The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 36.181 [3] define test
tolerances. These test tolerances are individually calculated for each test.
The test tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements in this
specification to create test requirements. For some requirements, including
regulatory requirements, the test tolerance is set to zero.
The measurement results returned by the test system are compared - without any
modification - against the test requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The shared risk principle is defined in recommendation ITUâ€‘R M.1545 [4].
## 4.3 Requirement reference points
### 4.3.1 SAN type 1-H
For _SAN type 1-H_ , the requirements are defined for two points of reference,
signified by radiated requirements and conducted requirements.
{width="5.2in" height="2.16875in"}
Figure 4.3.1-1: Radiated and conducted reference points for _SAN type 1-H_
Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA), where the radiated
interface is referred to as the _Radiated Interface Boundary_ (RIB). Radiated
requirements are also referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial)
characteristics in which the OTA requirements apply are detailed for each
requirement.
Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of _TAB
connectors_ at the _transceiver array boundary_ , which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.
The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver functionality
receiving and transmitting modulated signal to ensure radio links with users.
The satellite payload is composed by a transceiver unit array and a composite
antenna array. The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific
number of transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units.
The composite antenna contains a radio distribution network (RDN) and an
antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes the RF
power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna array, and/or
distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna array to the
transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.
How a conducted requirement is applied to the _transceiver array boundary_ is
detailed in the respective requirement clause.
### 4.3.2 SAN type 1-O
For _SAN type 1-O_ , the radiated characteristics are defined over the air
(OTA), where the _operating band_ specific radiated interface is referred to
as the _Radiated Interface Boundary_ (RIB). Radiated requirements are also
referred to as OTA requirements. The (spatial) characteristics in which the
OTA requirements apply are detailed for each requirement.

## 4.4 Satellite Access Node classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Satellite Access Node unless
otherwise stated. The associated deployment scenarios are exactly the same for
SAN with and without connectors.
For SAN _type 1-O_ and _SAN type 1-H_ , two SAN classes (LEO and GEO) are
defined in table 4.4-1.

## 4.5 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements set by local and
regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances the regional requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.5-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may be
applied differently in different regions.

## 5.4 Channel arrangement
## 5.4A Channel arrangement for category M1
### 5.4A.1 Channel spacing
The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the size
of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The nominal
channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined as following:
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted to optimize
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.4A.2 Channel raster, carrier frequency and EARFCN
The global frequency raster is defined for all frequencies. The granularity of
the global frequency raster is 100 kHz, which means that the carrier centre
frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz. For each operating band, a
subset of frequencies from the global frequency raster are applicable and
forms a channel raster with a granularity Î”F~Raster~.
The carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the E-UTRA
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 \-- 262143.
The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the downlink
is given by the following equation, where F~DL_low~ and N~Offs-DL~ are given
in Table 5.4A.2-1 and N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN.
F~DL~ = F~DL_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)
The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the uplink is
given by the following equation where F~UL_low~ and N~Offs-UL~ are given in
Table 5.4.2-1 and N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN.
F~UL~ = F~UL_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~)
The applicable channel raster and EARFCNs for each operating band are
specified in Table 5.4A.2-1.
For operating bands with a channel raster of 100 kHz, every EARFCN within the
operating band shall be applicable for the channel raster, and the step size
for the channel raster in Table 5.4A.2â€‘1 is given as \. The broadcast
parameter _earfcn-LSB_ defined in TS 36.331 [9] may be used to assist the UE
in synchronizing to the cell.

### 6.6.4 Operating band unwanted emissions
#### 6.6.4.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE) limits
for SAN are defined from channel edge up to frequencies separated from the
channel edge by 200% of the necessary bandwidth.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.
_Basic limits_ are specified in the tables below, where:
\- âˆ†f is the separation between the _channel edge_ frequency and the nominal
-3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the _channel edge_ frequency and the
centre of the measuring filter.
\- PSD~channel~ [dBm/4kHz]represents the Power Spectral Density of the channel
for a given channel bandwidth
\- BW~Channel~ [MHz] is the considered E-UTRA _channel bandwidth_ or SAN total
_RF bandwidth_ for a given _operating band_.
\- $\Delta_{Sat_ Class}\left\lbrack \text{dB} \right\rbrack$ is the _SAN class
parameter_ in dB identified to characterize different SAN classes.
For a multi-carrier _single-band connector_ the definitions above apply to the
lower edge of the carrier transmitted at the _lowest carrier_ frequency and
the upper edge of the carrier transmitted at the _highest carrier_ frequency
within a specified frequency band.
\- The operating band unwanted emission basic limits of the band where there
are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause for
the largest frequency offset (âˆ†fmax), shall apply from channel edge up to
frequencies separated from the channel edge by 200% of the necessary
bandwidth.

recommendation SM.1541-6 [6].
The SAN Operating Band Unwanted Emissions (OBUE) requirements for GEO and LEO

transmission. A PUCCH transmission may take multiple subframes due to PUCCH
transmission repetition. The performance measure is defined as follows:
$$\text{Prob}\left( PUCCH\ DTX \rightarrow ACK\ bits \right) = \frac{#\left(
\text{false\ ACK\ bits} \right)}{#\left( \text{PUCCH\ DTX} \right) \times
#\left( ACK/NAK\ bits \right)} \leq 10^{- 2}$$
where:
\- #(false ACK bits) denotes the number of detected ACK bits per PUCCH
transmission.
\- #(ACK/NACK bits) denotes the number of encoded bits per PUCCH transmission.
\- #(PUCCH DTX) denotes the number of DTX occasions per PUCCH transmission.
#### 8.3.1.2 ACK missed detection requirements for single user PUCCH format 1a

## 8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
### 8.4.1 PRACH False alarm probability
The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas, for
all frame structures and for any channel bandwidth.
The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of erroneous
detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when
input is only noise.
#### 8.4.1.1 Minimum requirement
The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.
### 8.4.2 PRACH detection requirements
The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several error
cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not
detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong
timing estimation. For NTN-TDLA100-5, a timing estimation error occurs if the
estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than 2.08us.
The strongest path for the timing estimation error refers to the strongest
path.
The test preambles for coverage enhancement are listed in table A.6-1.
#### 8.4.2.1 Minimum requirements
The probability of detection shall be equal to or exceed 99% for the SNR
levels listed in Table 8.4.2.1-1.
The requirements for coverage enhancement (Table 8.4.2.1-1) are only valid for
the satellite access node supporting coverage enhancement.

### 8.5.1 Requirements for NPUSCH format 1
#### 8.5.1.1 Requirements
The performance requirement of NPUSCH format 1 is determined by a minimum

performance requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.
An NB-IoT Base Station supports 15 kHz subcarrier spacing requirements, or
3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing requirements, or both.
For 15kHz subcarrier spacing multi-subcarrier, the demodulation requirements
apply for the supported number of subcarriers.

### 8.5.3 Performance requirements for NPRACH
#### 8.5.3.1 NPRACH False alarm probability
The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas, for
all repetition numbers and for any number of subcarriers.
The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of erroneous
detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when
input is only noise.
##### 8.5.3.1.1 Minimum requirement
The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.
#### 8.5.3.2 NPRACH detection requirements
The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several error
cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not
detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong
timing estimation. For NTN-TDLA100 and NTN-TDLC5, a timing estimation erros
occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the largest delay path is
larger than the time orror tolerance given in Table 8.5.3.2-2

# 9 Radiated transmitter characteristics
## 9.1 General
Radiated transmitter characteristics requirements apply on the _SAN type 1-H
or_ _SAN type 1-O_ including all its functional components active and for all
foreseen modes of operation of the SAN unless otherwise stated.
## 9.2 Radiated transmit power
### 9.2.1 General
_SAN type 1-H and SAN type 1-O_ are declared to support one or more beams, as
per manufacturer\'s declarations specified in TS 36.181 [3]. Radiated transmit
power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam at a specific _beam
peak direction_.
For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam identity,
_reference beam direction pair_ , beamwidth, _rated beam EIRP_ , _OTA peak
directions set_ , the _beam direction pairs_ at the maximum steering
directions and their associated _rated beam EIRP_ and beamwidth(s).
For a declared beam and _beam direction pair_ , the _rated beam EIRP_ level is
the maximum power that the SAN is declared to radiate at the associated _beam
peak direction_ during the _transmitter ON period_.
For each _beam peak direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within
the _OTA peak directions set_ , a specific _rated beam EIRP_ level may be
claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy requirement as
described below. _Rated beam EIRP_ is only required to be declared for the
_beam direction pairs_ subject to conformance testing as detailed in TS 36.181
[3].
NOTE 1: _OTA peak directions set_ is set of _beam peak directions_ for which
the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The _beam peak
directions_ are related to a corresponding contiguous range or discrete list
of _beam centre directions_ by the _beam direction pairs_ included in the set.
NOTE 2: A _beam direction pair_ is data set consisting of the _beam centre
direction_ and the related _beam peak direction._
NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer for
verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the manufacturer to
the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment and is not subject to
formal conformance testing.
### 9.2.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type 1-O_
For each declared beam, in normal conditions, for any specific _beam peak
direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within the _OTA peak
directions set_ , a manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the corresponding _beam
peak direction_ shall be achievable to within Â±2.2 dB of the claimed value.
Normal conditions are defined in TS 36.181, annex B [3].
In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may apply
also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined as normal.
## 9.3 OTA Satellite Access Node output power
### 9.3.1 General
OTA SAN output power is declared as the TRP radiated requirement, with the
output power accuracy requirement defined at the RIB. TRP does not change with
beamforming settings as long as the _beam peak direction_ is within the _OTA
peak directions set_. Thus the TRP accuracy requirement must be met for any
beamforming setting for which the _beam peak direction_ is within the _OTA
peak directions set_.
The SAN _rated carrier TRP output power_ for _SAN type 1-O_ shall be based on
manufacturer declaration.
Despite the general requirements for the SAN output power described in clause
9.3.2, additional regional requirements might be applicable.
### 9.3.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_
In normal conditions, the _SAN type 1-O_ _maximum carrier TRP output power_ ,
P~max,c~,~TRP~ measured at the RIB shall remain within Â±2 dB of the _rated
carrier TRP output power_ P~rated,c,TRP~, as declared by the manufacturer.
Normal conditions are defined in TS 36.181 [3], annex B.
## 9.4 OTA output power dynamics
### 9.4.1 General
Transmit signal quality (as specified in clause 9.6) shall be maintained for
the output power dynamics requirements.
The OTA output power requirements are _directional requirements_ and apply to
the _beam peak directions_ over the _OTA peak directions set_.
The requirements in clause 9.4 does not apply for NB-IoT standalone mode.
### 9.4.2 OTA RE power control dynamic range
#### 9.4.2.1 General
The OTA RE power control dynamic range is the difference between the power of
an RE and the average RE power for a SAN at maximum output power
(P~max,c,EIRP~) for a specified reference condition.
This requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
_operating band_.
#### 9.4.2.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_
The OTA RE power control dynamic range is specified the same as the conducted
RE power control dynamic range requirement for _SAN type 1-H_ in table
6.3.2.2-1.
### 9.4.3 OTA total power dynamic range
#### 9.4.3.1 General
The OTA total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum and
the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for a specified reference
condition.
This requirement shall apply at each RIB supporting transmission in the
_operating band_.
NOTE 1: The upper limit of the dynamic range is the OFDM symbol power for a
SAN at maximum output power. The lower limit of the dynamic range is the OFDM
symbol power for a SAN when one resource block is transmitted.
#### 9.4.3.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_
OTA total power dynamic range minimum requirement for SAN type 1-O is
specified such as for each E-UTRA carrier it shall be larger than or equal to
the levels specified for the conducted requirement for _SAN type 1-H_ in table
6.3.3.2-1.
## 9.5 OTA transmit ON/OFF power
The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.
## 9.6 OTA transmitted signal quality
### 9.6.1 OTA frequency error
#### 9.6.1.1 General
OTA frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual SAN
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be used
for RF frequency and data clock generation.
OTA frequency error requirement is defined as a _directional requirement_ at
the RIB and shall be met within the _OTA coverage range_.
#### 9.6.1.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_
The modulated carrier frequency of each carrier configured by the SAN shall be
accurate to within 0.05 ppm observed over 1 ms.
### 9.6.2 OTA modulation quality
#### 9.6.2.1 General
Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured carrier
signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be expressed as Error
Vector Magnitude (EVM). Details about how the EVM is determined are specified
in annex B.
OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a _directional requirement_
at the RIB and shall be met within the _OTA coverage range_.
#### 9.6.2.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_
For _SAN type 1-O_ , the EVM levels of each carrier for different modulation
schemes on PDSCH outlined in table 6.5.2.2-1 shall be met. Requirements shall
be the same as clause 6.5.2.2.
### 9.6.3 OTA time alignment error
The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.
### 9.6.4 OTA DL RS power
For E-UTRA, DL RS power is the resource element power of the Downlink
Reference Symbol.
The absolute DL RS power is indicated on the DL-SCH. The OTA absolute accuracy
is defined as the maximum deviation between the DL RS power indicated on the
DL-SCH and the DL RS power of each E-UTRA carrier within the _OTA coverage
range_.
For NB-IoT, DL NRS power is the resource element power of the Downlink Narrow-
band Reference Signal.
The absolute DL NRS power is indicated on the DL-SCH. The OTA absolute
accuracy is defined as the maximum deviation between the DL NRS power
indicated on the DL-SCH and the DL NRS power of each NB-IoT carrier within the
_OTA coverage range._
#### 9.6.4.1 Minimum requirements for _SAN type 1-O_
For _SAN type 1-O_ , the OTA absolute accuracy for DL RS power shall be the
same as clause 6.5.4.1.
## 9.7 OTA unwanted emissions
### 9.7.1 General
Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 [2]. In ITU terminology,
out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the _SAN
channel bandwidth_ resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in
the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are
emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics
emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency
conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the _SAN type 1-O_ is specified
both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and operating
band unwanted emissions (OBUE). The OTA Operating band unwanted emissions
define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink _operating band_ plus
the frequency ranges Î”f~OBUE~ above and Î”f~OBUE~ below each band. OTA Unwanted
emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by an OTA spurious
emissions requirement.
The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from the
_operating band_ edge is Î”f~OBUE~. The value of Î”f~OBUE~ is defined in table
9.7.1-1 for _SAN type 1-O_ for the SAN _operating bands_.

## 10.2 OTA sensitivity
### 10.2.1 General
The OTA sensitivity requirement is a _directional requirement_ based upon the
declaration of one or more _OTA sensitivity direction declarations_ (OSDD),
related to a _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type 1-O_ receiver.
The _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type 1-O_ may optionally be capable of
redirecting/changing the _receiver target_ by means of adjusting SAN settings
resulting in multiple _sensitivity RoAoA_. The _sensitivity RoAoA_ resulting
from the current SAN settings is the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
If the SAN is capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the OSDD
then the OSDD shall include:
\- _SAN channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level applicable to any
active _sensitivity RoAoA_ inside the _receiver target redirection range_ in
the OSDD.
\- A declared _receiver target redirection range_ , describing all the angles
of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative settings in
the SAN.
\- Five declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TS 36.181 [3].
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 1: Some of the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ may coincide depending on the
redirection capability.
NOTE 2: In addition to the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ , several _sensitivity
RoAoA_ may be implicitly defined by the _receiver target redirection range_
without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.
If the SAN is not capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the
OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _SAN channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to the _sensitivity RoAoA_ in the OSDD.
\- One declared active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 3: For SAN without target redirection capability, the declared (fixed)
_sensitivity RoAoA_ is always the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 10.2.2 Minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_
For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the active
_sensitivity RoAoA_ of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as described in
clause 7.2 shall be met when the level of the arriving signal is equal to the
minimum EIS level in the respective declared set of EIS level and _SAN channel
bandwidth_.
## 10.3 OTA reference sensitivity level
### 10.3.1 General

ensure the minimum OTA reference sensitivity level for a declared _OTA REFSENS
RoAoA_. The OTA reference sensitivity power level EIS~REFSENS~ is the minimum
mean power received at the RIB at which a reference performance requirement
shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel.

For 15 kHz, 7.5 kHz, 1.25 kHz, 2.5 kHz subcarrier spacing, the basic unit of
EVM measurement is defined over one subframe (1 ms) for subframe TTI and over
one sTTI when supporting sTTI feature in the time domain and subcarriers (180
kHz) in the frequency domain:
For 0.37 kHz subcarrier spacing, the basic unit of EVM measurement is defined
over one slot (3 ms) in the time domain and subcarriers (180 kHz) in the
frequency domain:

Note: Although the basic unit of measurement is one subframe or one sTTI, the
equalizer is calculated over 10 subframe measurement periods to reduce the
impact of noise in the reference symbols. The boundaries of the 10 subframe
measurement periods need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.
# B.3 Modified signal under test
Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is able
to compensate a number of transmitter impairments. The signal under test is
equalised and decoded according to:

# B.6 Estimation of TX chain amplitude and frequency response parameters
The equalizer coefficients and are determined as follows:
1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal and the post-FFT Ideal signal , for each reference symbol,
over 10 subframes. This process creates a set of complex ratios:
Where the post-FFT Ideal signal is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following parameters:
restricted content: i.e. nominal Reference Symbols and the Primary
Synchronisation Channel, (all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),
nominal carrier frequency, nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable
subcarrier, nominal timing.
2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the complex
ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 subframes. Prior to the averaging of
the phases an unwrap operation must be performed according to the following
definition: The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of by adding
multiples of 2*PI when absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances
t~i~ are greater then or equal to the jump tolerance of PI radians. This
process creates an average amplitude and phase for each reference signal
subcarrier (i.e. every third subcarrier with the exception of the reference
subcarrier spacing across the DC subcarrier).
Where _N_ is the number of reference symbol time-domain locations _t~i~_ from
Z\'(f,t) for each reference signal subcarrier .
3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase and at the reference
signal subcarriers are obtained by computing the moving average in the
frequency domain of the time-averaged reference signal subcarriers, i.e. every
third subcarrier. The moving average window size is 19. For reference
subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel the window size is reduced
accordingly as per figure B.6-1.
4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients and to
compute coefficients , for each subcarrier.
Figure B.6-1: Reference subcarrier smoothing in the frequency domain
# B.7 Averaged EVM
EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of 10
downlink subframes:
For FDD the averaging in the time domain equals the 10 subframe duration of
the 10 subframes measurement period from the equalizer estimation step.
_Where Ni_ is the number of resource blocks with the considered modulation
scheme in subframe or sTTI _i_ and _N~dl~_ is the number of allocated downlink
subframes or sTTI in one frame.
The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS average at
the window W extremities of the EVM measurements:
Thus is calculated using in the expressions above and is calculated using in
the calculation.
Thus we get:
The averaged EVM with the minimum averaging length of at least 10 subframes is
then achieved by further averaging of the results

# Annex D (Normative): Propagation condition
# D.1 Static propagation condition
The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist for this
propagation model.
# D.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:
\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized by a
number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile can be
further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum delay spanned
by the taps.
\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay profile
and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical spectrum shape
and a maximum Doppler frequency.
## D.2.1 Delay profiles
The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.811 [10] TDL models. The
simplification steps are described in TS 38.108 D.2 [7].
### D.2.1.1 Delay profiles
The delay profiles are selected to be representative of low and medium delay
spread environment. The resulting model parameters are specified in table
D.2.1.1-1 and the tapped delay line models are specified in tables D.2.1.1-2
and D.2.1.1-3.

## D.2.2 Combinations of channel model parameters
The propagation conditions used for the performance measurements in multi-path
fading environment are indicated as a combination of a channel model name and
a maximum Doppler frequency, i.e., NTN-TDLA\-\ or NTN-
TDLC\-\ where \'\\' indicates the desired delay spread and
\'\\' indicates the maximum Doppler frequency (Hz).
Table D.2.2-1 show the propagation conditions that are used for the
performance measurements in multi-path fading environment.
