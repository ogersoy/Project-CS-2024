In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

# 4 General test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in TS 36.181
(the present document), i.e. to all conducted tests defined for _SAN type 1-H_
and radiated tests defined for _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type 1-O_.
The minimum requirements are given in TS 36.108 [2]. Test Tolerances for the
conducted test requirements (TT) and test Tolerances for the radiated test
requirements (TT~OTA~) explicitly stated in the present document are given in
annex C of the present document.
The test tolerances for the radiated test requirements (TT~OTA~) for SAN were
reused from TR 37.941 [5]. Reuse of TR 37.941 [5] TT~OTA~ values for SAN LEO
radiated conformance testing is subject to the following conditions:
\- EUT suitability to fit OTA chambers considered in TR 37.941 [5], and
\- Environmental test conditions assumed for BS testing in TR 37.941 [5].
Reuse of TR 37.941 [5] TT~OTA~ values for SAN GEO radiated conformance testing
may not be justified for some products due to too large SAN GEO antenna array
dimensions, and required OTA RF chamber size.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. Test Tolerances are
used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.
The radiated requirements are classified according to spatial characteristics
as shown in table 4.1.1-1 and table 4.1.1-2.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
#### 4.1.2.1 General
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Conducted Test System and OTA Test
System are specified below for each test defined explicitly in the present
specification, where appropriate. The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the
Test System for test requirements included by reference is defined in the
respective referred test specification.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For conducted RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause
4.1.2 apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the EUT and the Test System.
For details on measurement uncertainty budget calculation, measurement
methodology description (including calibration and measurement stage for each
test range), MU budget format and its contributions, refer to TR 37.941 [5],
where MU analyses for the BS radiated testing were captured. The maximum OTA
Test System uncertainty for OTA transmitter and receiver tests in table
4.1.2.2-2 and 4.1.2.3-2 were reused from BS MU budgets in TR 37.941 [5]. Reuse
of TR 37.941 [5] MU values for SAN LEO radiated conformance testing is subject
to the following conditions:
\- EUT suitability to fit OTA chambers considered in TR 37.941 [5], and
\- Environmental test conditions assumed for BS testing in TR 37.941 [5].
Reuse of TR 37.941 [5] TT~OTA~ values for SAN GEO radiated conformance testing
may not be justified for some products due to too large SAN GEO antenna array
dimensions, and required OTA RF chamber size.
#### 4.1.2.2 Measurement of transmitter
The maximum conducted Test System uncertainty for conducted transmitter tests
minimum requirements is given in table 4.1.2.2-1. And the maximum OTA Test
System uncertainty for OTA transmitter tests minimum requirements is given in
table 4.1.2.2-2.

## 8.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH
### 8.3.1 ACK missed detection for PUCCH format 1a transmission on single
antenna port for coverage enhancement
#### 8.3.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUCCH for ACK missed detection is determined by
the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK and the
probability of detection of ACK. The performance is measured by the required
SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of false
detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK for the configured PUCCH
transmission repetitions when input is only noise.
The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional probability of
detection of the ACK for the configured PUCCH transmission repetitions when
the signal is present.
The test is applicable only to space access nodes supporting coverage
enhancement. A test for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the
SAN supports it.
#### 8.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.108 [2] clause 8.3.9.1 and 8.3.9.2.
#### 8.3.1.3 Test purpose

## 8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
### 8.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection
#### 8.4.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is determined by
the two parameters: total probability of false detection of the preamble (Pfa)
and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd). The performance is measured
by the required SNR at probability of detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1%
or less.
Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of
the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only
noise.
The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several error
cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not
detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong
timing estimation. For NTN-TDLA100-5, a timing estimation error occurs if the
estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than 2.08 us.
The strongest path for the timing estimation error refers to the strongest
path (i.e. average of the delay of all paths having the same highest gain =
310 ns for ETU) in the power delay profile.
The test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.6-1.8.5
#### 8.4.1.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.108 [2] clause 8.4.1.1 and 8.4.2.1.
#### 8.4.1.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver's ability to detect PRACH preamble under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.
#### 8.4.1.4 Method of test
##### 8.4.1.4.1 Initial Conditions
Test environment: Normal, see annex B.
RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.7.
1) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN antenna connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in annex I.3.1 or annex D.5 as
applicable.
##### 8.4.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth.
Table 8.4.1.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the SAN input
* * *
Channel bandwidth (MHz) AWGN power level 1.4 -89.7 dBm / 1.08MHz
* * *
2) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to
the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A.
3) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex F.
4) Adjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to table
8.4.1.5-1.
5) Adjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 8.4.1.5-1 is
achieved at the SAN input during the PRACH preambles.
6) The test signal generator sends a preamble and the receiver tries to detect
the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure 8.4.1.4.2-1.
The preambles are sent with certain timing estimation errors as described
below. The following statistics are kept: the number of preambles detected in
the idle period and the number of missed preambles.
Figure 8.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern
PRACH preambles are sent with a timing estimation error of 2.08 us.
#### 8.4.1.5 Test Requirement
Pfa shall not exceed 0.1%. Pd shall not be below 99% for the SNRs in table
8.4.1.5-1.

8.5.2 ACK missed detection for NPUSCH format 2
8.5.2.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of NPUSCH format 2 for ACK missed detection is
determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of
false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.
The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional probability of
detection of the ACK when the ACK was sent per NPUSCH format 2 transmission
when the signal is present.
The tests for 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing are applicable to the base stations
supporting 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing requirements. The tests for 15 kHz
subcarrier spacing are applicable to the base stations supporting 15 kHz

8.5.3 Performance requirements for NPRACH
8.5.3.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of NPRACH for preamble detection is determined by
two parameters: the total probability of false detection of the preamble (Pfa)
and the probability of detection of the preamble (Pd). The performance is
measured for the required SNR
> \- at probability of Pd which shall not be smaller than 99% and
>
> \- at probability of Pfa which shall not be larger than 0.1%.
Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of
the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only
noise.
Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble when the
signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several error cases --
detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not detecting a
preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong timing
estimation. A timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the
timing of the strongest path is larger than 3.646 us. The strongest path for
the timing estimation error refers to the strongest path in the power delay
profile.
The performance requirements for TDD are optional and only valid for base
stations supporting TDD.
The parameters of NPRACH test preambles are listed in table 8.5.3.1-1.

# 9 Radiated transmitter characteristics
## 9.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. SAN
configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.
If beams have been declared equivalent and parallel (D.13, D.14), only a
representative beam is necessary to be tested to demonstrate conformance.
## 9.2 Radiated transmit power
### 9.2.1 Definition and applicability
Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam at a
specific _beam peak direction_.
For each declared beam, the requirement is based on declarations given in
clause 4.6 for a beam identifier (D.3), _reference beam direction pair_ (D.8),
_rated beam EIRP_ (D.11) at the beam\'s reference direction pair, _OTA peak
directions set_ (D.9), the _beam direction pairs_ at the maximum steering
directions (D.10) and their associated _rated beam EIRP_ and _beam width(s)_
for reference _beam direction pair_ and maximum steering directions (D.12).
For a declared beam identifier and _beam direction pair_ , the _rated beam
EIRP_ level is the maximum power that the SAN is declared to radiate at the
associated _beam peak direction._
For each _beam peak direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within
the _OTA peak directions set_ , a specific _rated beam EIRP_ level may be
claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy requirement as
described below. _Rated beam EIRP_ is only required to be declared for the
_beam direction pairs_ subject to conformance testing as detailed in clause
9.2.4.1.
NOTE 1: The _OTA peak directions set_ for a beam is the complete continuous or
discrete set of all _beam direction_ for which the EIRP requirement is
achieved for the beam.
NOTE 2: A beam direction pair consists of a beam centre direction and an
associated beam peak direction.
Radiated transmit power is directional requirement applicable to _SAN type
1-H_ and _SAN type 1-O_.
### 9.2.2 Minimum requirement
Radiated transmit power minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type
1-O_ is defined in TS 36.108 [2], clause 9.2.2.

Directions to be tested:
\- OTA peak directions set reference beam direction pair (D.8), and
\- OTA peak directions set maximum steering directions (D.10).
Beams to be tested: A representative number of beams shall be chosen to
demonstrate the SAN conformance to radiated power requirements.
#### 9.2.4.2 Procedure
The test procedure is as follows:
1) Place the satellite on the positioner.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of the
satellite with the test system.
3) Orient the positioner and satellite in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna.
4) Configure the _beam peak direction_ of the satellite according to the
declared _beam direction pair_.
5) Set the SAN to transmit according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in clause 4.9.2.
For a SAN declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation use the applicable
test signal configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses
[4.7.2] and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in clause 4.9.2 on all
carriers configured.
6) Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and
calculate total radiated transmit power for particular _beam direction pair_
as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.
7) Test steps 3 to 6 are repeated for all declared beams (D.3) and their
reference _beam direction pairs_ and _maximum steering directions_ (D.8 and
D.10).
For multi-band capable SAN and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved _operating band_ where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.
### 9.2.5 Test requirement
For each declared conformance _beam direction pair_ , the EIRP measurement
results in clause 9.2.4.2 shall remain within the values provided in table
9.2.5-1, relative to the manufacturer\'s declared rated beam EIRP (D.11)
value:

For a SAN declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation use the applicable
test signal configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses
[4.7.2] and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in clause 4.9.2 on all
carriers configured.
5) Orient the positioner and satellite in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP
can be performed.
6) Measure the radiated power for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1
and p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular beam
direction pair as EIRP = EIRPp1 + EIRPp2.
7) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement grid
needed for full TRP estimation
8) Calculate TRP using the EIRP measurements.
For single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where single

## 9.7 OTA unwanted emissions
### 9.7.1 General
Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 [3]. In ITU terminology,
out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the _SAN
channel bandwidth_ resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in
the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are
emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics
emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency
conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the _SAN type 1-O_ is specified
both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and operating
band unwanted emissions (OBUE). The OTA Operating band unwanted emissions
define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink _operating band_ plus
the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~ below each band. OTA Unwanted
emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by an OTA spurious
emissions requirement.
The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions mask from the
_operating band_ edge is Δf~OBUE~. The value of Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table
9.7.1-1 for _SAN type 1-O_ for the SAN _operating bands_.
Table 9.7.1-1: Maximum offset Δf~OBUE~ outside the downlink _operating band_

> frequency as specified in table 9.7.3.5-1 and table 9.7.3.5-2 for _SAN type
> 1-O_. In multiple carrier case only offset frequencies below the lowest and
> above the highest carrier frequency used shall be measured.
11) Repeat the test with the channel set-up using E-SAN-TM1.2.

### 9.7.4 OTA operating band unwanted emissions
#### 9.7.4.1 Definition and applicability
The OTA limits for operating band unwanted emissions are specified as TRP per
RIB unless otherwise stated.
Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE) limits
for SAN are defined from channel edge up to frequencies separated from the
channel edge by 200% of the necessary bandwidth.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.
_Basic limits_ are specified in the tables below, where:
\- ∆f is the separation between the _channel edge_ frequency and the nominal
-3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the _channel edge_ frequency and the
centre of the measuring filter.
\- PSD~channel~ represents the Power Spectral Density of the channel for a
given channel bandwidth
\- BW~Channel~ is the considered _SAN channel bandwidth_ or SAN total _RF
bandwidth_ for a given _operating band_.
\- $\Delta_{Sat_ Class}$ is the _SAN class parameter_ in dB identified to
characterize different SAN classes.
For a multi-carrier _single-band RIB_ the definitions above apply to the lower
edge of the carrier transmitted at the _lowest carrier_ frequency and the
upper edge of the carrier transmitted at the _highest carrier_ frequency
within a specified frequency band.
\- The operating band unwanted emission basic limits of the band where there
are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause for
the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall apply from channel edge up to
frequencies separated from the channel edge by 200% of the necessary
bandwidth.
#### 9.7.4.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_ is defined in TS 36.108 [2], clause
9.7.4.2.
#### 9.7.4.3 Test purpose
This test measures the emissions of the SAN, close to the assigned channel
bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the SAN is in operation.
#### 9.7.4.4 Method of test
##### 9.7.4.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see annex B.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see clause 4.9.1.
_SAN RF bandwidth_ positions to be tested for multi-carrier: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.
Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be
set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see TS 38.141-2 [9], annex
I) as long as the required TRP level is achieved.
##### 9.7.4.4.2 Procedure
The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional power
measurements as described in TS 38.141-2 [9], annex I. An alternative method
to measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber
if so follow steps 1, 3, 4, 6.
1) Place the SAN at the positioner.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of the
SAN with the test system.
3) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:
\- Measurement filter bandwidth: as defined in clause 9.7.4.5.
\- Detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.
As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should
be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result
should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to
ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in table
4.1.2.2-2.
4) For single carrier operation, set the SAN to transmit according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test
model(s) in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers declared _rated carrier TRP output
power_ declared per RIB (P~rated,c,TRP~).
For a SAN declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, use the
applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting specified
in clause 4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in clause 4.9.2
on all carriers configured.
5) Orient the positioner (and SAN) in order that the direction to be tested
aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be
performed (see TS 38.141-2 [9], annex I).
6) Sweep the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps
and measure emission power within the specified frequency ranges with the
specified measurement bandwidth.
7) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement grid
needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see TS 38.141-2 [9], annex I).
8) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ using the measurements made in step 6.
#### 9.7.4.5 Test requirements
The OTA operating band unwanted emission requirement for _SAN type 1-O_ shall
not exceed the limit in table 9.7.4.5-1.

#### 9.7.5.6 Protection of the SAN receiver
The co-location requirement is not applicable for SAN in this version of the
specification.
#### 9.7.5.7 Additional spurious emissions requirements
The additional spurious emissions requirement is not applicable for SAN.
## 9.8 OTA transmitter intermodulation
The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.
# 10 Radiated receiver characteristic
## 10.1 General
General test conditions for receiver tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. SAN
configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.
Radiated receiver characteristics are specified at RIB for _SAN type 1-H or_
_SAN type 1-O_ , with full complement of transceivers for the configuration in
normal operating condition.
Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for the radiated
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 10:
\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.
\- The requirements shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) ON.
\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver characteristics
do not assume HARQ retransmissions.
\- When SAN is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the throughput
requirements are applicable for each received carrier.
\- For ACS and blocking characteristics, the negative offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the lower _SAN RF Bandwidth_ _edge_ , and
the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the upper
_SAN RF Bandwidth_ _edge_.
\- Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.
NOTE: In normal operating condition the SAN in FDD operation is configured to
transmit and receive at the same time.
For requirements which are to be met over the _OTA REFSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB for the
reference direction
and
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB for all
other directions
For requirements which are to be met over the _minSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)
## 10.2 OTA sensitivity
### 10.2.1 Definition and applicability
The OTA sensitivity requirement is a _directional requirement_ based upon the
declaration of one or more _OTA sensitivity direction declarations_ (OSDD),
related to a _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type 1-O_ receiver.
The _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type 1-O_ may optionally be capable of
redirecting/changing the _receiver target_ by means of adjusting SAN settings
resulting in multiple _sensitivity RoAoA_. The _sensitivity RoAoA_ resulting
from the current SAN settings is the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
If the SAN is capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the OSDD
then the OSDD shall include:
\- _SAN channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level applicable to any
active _sensitivity RoAoA_ inside the _receiver target redirection range_ in
the OSDD.
\- A declared _receiver target redirection range_ , describing all the angles
of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative settings in
the SAN.
\- Five declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TR 37. 941 [5].
> \- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 1: Some of the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ may coincide depending on the
redirection capability.
NOTE 2: In addition to the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ , several _sensitivity
RoAoA_ may be implicitly defined by the _receiver target redirection range_
without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.
If the SAN is not capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the
OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _SAN channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to the _sensitivity RoAoA_ in the OSDD.
\- One declared active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
> NOTE 3: For SAN without target redirection capability, the declared (fixed)
> _sensitivity RoAoA_ is always the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 10.2.2 Minimum requirement
For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the active
_sensitivity RoAoA_ of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as described in TS
36.108 [2] clause 10.2.2 shall be met when the level of the arriving signal is
equal to the minimum EIS level in the respective declared set of EIS level and
_SAN channel bandwidth_.
### 10.2.3 Test Purpose
The test purpose is to verify that the SAN can meet the throughput requirement
for a specified measurement channel at the EIS level and the range of angles
of arrival declared in the OSDD.
### 10.2.4 Method of test
#### 10.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal, see annex B.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.
Directions to be tested:
\- Receiver target reference direction (D.26),
\- Conformance test directions (D.28).
#### 10.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system reference
point in the same place as calibrated point in the test system, as shown in
annex D.4.1.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the SAN
with the test system.
3) Align the SAN with the test antenna in the declared direction to be tested.
4) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power from the
test antenna is captured by the SAN under test.
5) Configure the beam peak direction for the transmitter according to the
declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam identifier.
6) For FDD operation, set the SAN to transmit beam(s) of the same operational
band as the OSDD being tested according to the appropriate test configuration
in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.
7) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:
\- The test signal as specified in clause 10.2.5.
8) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at the SAN
Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified in clause
10.2.5.
9) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
polarization.
10) Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all OSDD(s) declared for the SAN (D.19), and
supported polarizations.
### 10.2.5 Test requirements
The minimum EIS level is a declared figure (D.23) for each OSDD (D.19). The
test requirement is calculated from the declared value offset by the EIS Test
Tolerance specified in clause 4.1.
For each measured carrier, the throughput measured in step 9 of clause
10.2.4.2 shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel as specified in annex A.1 with parameters specified in
table 10.2.5-1 for E-UTRA, and in table 10.2.5-2 for standalone NB-IoT.

## 10.3 OTA reference sensitivity level
### 10.3.1 Definition and applicability

11.5.2 ACK missed detection for NPUSCH format 2
11.5.2.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of NPUSCH format 2 for ACK missed detection is
determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of
false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.
The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional probability of
detection of the ACK when the ACK was sent per NPUSCH format 2 transmission
when the signal is present.
The tests for 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing are applicable to the base stations
supporting 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing requirements. The tests for 15 kHz
subcarrier spacing are applicable to the base stations supporting 15 kHz
subcarrier spacing requirements.
11.5.2.2 Minimum Requirement
For _SAN type 1-O_ , the minimum requirement is in TS 36.102 [2] clause
11.5.2.1 and 11.5.2.2.
11.5.2.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver's ability to detect ACK under multipath
fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

11.5.3 Performance requirements for NPRACH
11.5.3.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of NPRACH for preamble detection is determined by
two parameters: the total probability of false detection of the preamble (Pfa)
and the probability of detection of the preamble (Pd). The performance is
measured for the required SNR
> \- at probability of Pd which shall not be smaller than 99% and
>
> \- at probability of Pfa which shall not be larger than 0.1%.
Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of
the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only
noise.
Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble when the
signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several error cases --
detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not detecting a
preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong timing
estimation. A timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the
timing of the strongest path is larger than 3.646 us. The strongest path for
the timing estimation error refers to the strongest path in the power delay
profile.
The performance requirements for TDD are optional and only valid for base
stations supporting TDD.
The parameters of NPRACH test preambles are listed in table 11.5.3.1-1.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Environmental requirements for SAN equipment
For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions under
which the SAN is to be tested are to be defined, considering two categories of
SAN equipment:
\- Equipment deployed in space as part of Satellite Payload RF (SPRF)
\- Equipment deployed on the ground (SAN terrestrial equipment).
Normal test environment for SAN is defined in TS 38.181 [6], annex B.2.
When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as defined
by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test. Vibration
conditions for SAN are defined in TS 38.181 [6], annex B.4.
The measurement accuracy of the test environments are defined in TS 38.181
[6], annex B.5.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Test tolerances and derivation of test
requirements
The test requirements explicitly defined in this specification have been
calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification TS
36.108 [2] using the test tolerances (TT) defined here. When the TT value is
zero, the test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When
the TT value is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum
requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the
following tables.
The TT~OTA~ values are derived from OTA Test System uncertainties, regulatory
requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the TT~OTA~
values may sometimes be set to zero.
The TT~OTA~ values should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account
of commonly known OTA Test System errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).
Note that a formula for applying TT~OTA~ values is provided for all OTA tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where
the OTA Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4.1.2.
In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined TT~OTA~
value in order to generate the correct tightened test requirements as defined
in this annex.

###### ## Annex G (normative): In-channel Tx test
# G.1 General
The global in-channel Tx test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of the TX
under test in a single measurement process.
The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter, however,
are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for description inside
this annex places particular emphasis on the exclusion of all
interdependencies among the parameters.
# G.2 Basic principle
The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of the TX
under test, received by an ideal receiver, with a reference signal, that is
generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal error free
received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent (generally complex)
baseband signals.
The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples. These
numbers are taken from frame structure 1 with normal CP length and a
transmission bandwidth configuration of _N_ ~RB~ = 100. The application of the
text below, however, is not restricted to this parameterset.
## G.2.2 Output signal of the TX under test
The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring equipment
and stored for further processsing. It is sampled at a sampling rate of 30.72
Msps and it is named z(ν). In the time domain it comprises at least 1 frame::
z(ν). It is modelled as a signal with the following parameters: demodulated
data content, carrier frequency, amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.
## G.2.3 Reference signal
Two types of reference signal are defined:
The reference signal i~1~(ν) is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following parameters:
demodulated data content, nominal carrier frequency, nominal amplitude and
phase for each subcarrier. It is represented as a sequence of samples at a
sampling rate of 30.72 Msps in the time domain. The structure of the signal is
described in the testmodells.
The reference signal i~2~(ν) is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following parameters:
restricted data content: nominal Reference Symbols and the Primary
Synchronisation Channel, (all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),
nominal carrier frequency, nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable
subcarrier, nominal timing. It is represented as a sequence of samples at a
sampling rate of 30.72 Msps in the time domain.
## G.2.4 Measurement results
The measurement results, achieved by the global in channel TX test are the
following:
\- Carrier Frequency error
\- EVM (Error Vector Magnitude)
\- Resource Element TX power
\- RS TX power (RSTP)
\- OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP)
Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX chain
after equalisation.
## G.2.5 Measurement points
Resource element TX power is measured after the FFT as described below. EVM is
calculated after the Equalizer (Ampl./ Phase correction). The result of the
frequency synchronisation is the frequency offset. It is performed in the pre-
and/or post-FFT domain. The FFT window of 2048 samples out of 2194 samples
(data +CP) in the time domain is selected in the box CP removal.
Figure G.2.5-1: Measurement points
# G.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
Sample Timing, Carrier Frequency in z(ν) are varied in order to minimise the
difference between z(ν) and i~1~ (ν) , after the amplitude ratio of z(ν) and
i~1~ (ν) has been scaled. Best fit (minimum difference) is achieved when the
RMS difference value between z(ν) and i(ν) is an absolute minimum.
The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: Carrier Frequency
Error.
From the acquired samples one carrier frequency error can be derived.
NOTE 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be supported by
Post FFT operations. However the minimisation process defined in the pre FFT
domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it does not exclude the samples
inbetween the FFT widths and it does not exclude the bandwidth outside the
transmission bandwidth configuration.
NOTE 2: The algorithm would allow to derive Carrier Frequency error and Sample
Frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there are no
requirements for Sample Frequeny error. Hence the algorithm models the RF and
the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It returns one error and
does not distinuish between both.
After this process the samples z(ν) are called z^0^(ν).
# G.4 Timing of the FFT window
The FFT window length is 2048 samples per OFDM symbol. 140 FFTs (286720
samples) cover less than the acquired number of samples (307200 samples in 10
subframes). The position in time for FFT must be determined.
In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic prefix
without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the window. The EVM
requirements shall be met within a window W\<CP. There are three different
instants for FFT:
Centre of the reduced window, called , ΔC --W/2 and ΔC +W/2,
The SAN shall transmit a signal according to the Test models, intended for
EVM. The primary synchronisation signal and the reference signal shall be used
to find the centre of the FFT window.
The timing of the measured signal is determined in the pre FFT domain as
follows, using z^0^(ν) and i~2~(ν):
1\. The measured signal is delay spread by the TX filter. Hence the distinct
boarders between the OFDM symbols and between Data and CP are also spread and
the timing is not obvious.
2\. In the Reference Signal i~2~(ν) the timing is known.
Correlation between (1) and (2) will result in a correlation peak. The meaning
of the correlation peak is approx. the "impulse response" of the TX filter.
3\. The meaning of "impulse response" assumes that the autocorrelation of the
reference signal i~2~(ν) is a Dirac peak and that the correlation between the
reference signal i~2~(ν) and the data in the measured signal is 0. The
correlation peak, (the highest, or in case of more than one highest, the
earliest) indicates the timing in the measured signal.
The number of samples, used for FFT is reduced compared to z^0^(ν). This
subset of samples is called z'(ν).
From the acquired samples one timing can be derived.
The timing of the centre with respect to the different CP length in a slot is
as follows: (Frame structure 1, normal CP length)
is on T~f~=72 within the CP of length 144 (in OFDM symbol 1 to 6)
is on T~f~=88 (=160-72) within the CP of length 160 (in OFDM symbol 0).
# G.5 Resource Element TX power
Perform FFT (z'(ν)) with the FFT window timing
The result is called Z'(t,f). The RE TX power is then defined as:
From this the Reference Signal Transmit power (RSTP) is derives as follows:
,
It is an average power and accumulates the powers of the reference symbols
within a sub frame divided by n, the number of reference symbols within a sub
frame.
From RETP the OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP) is derived as follows:
It accumulates all sub carrier powers of the 4th OFDM symbol. The 4th (out of
14 OFDM symbols within a subframe (in case of frame type 1, normal CP length))
contains exclusively PDSCH.
From the acquired samples 10 values for each RSTP and OSTP can be derived.
# G.6 Post FFT equalisation
Perform 140 FFTs on z'(ν), one for each OFDM symbol comprising the full frame
with the FFT window timing. (in case of frame type 1 , normal CP length) The
result is an array of samples, 140 in the time axis t times 2048 in the
frequency axis G.
The equalizer coefficients and are determined as follows:
1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal and the post-FFT Ideal signal , for each reference symbol,
over 10 subframes. This process creates a set of complex ratios:
2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the complex
ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 subframes. Prior to the averaging of
the phases an unwrap operation must be performed according to the following
definition: The unwrap operation corrects the radian phase angles of by adding
multiples of 2*PI when absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances
t~i~ are greater than or equal to the jump tolerance of PI radians. This
process creates an average amplitude and phase for each reference signal
subcarrier (i.e. every third subcarrier with the exception of the reference
subcarrier spacing across the DC subcarrier).
Where _N_ is the number of reference symbol time-domain locations _t~i~_ from
Z'(f,t) for each reference signal subcarrier .
3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase and at the reference
signal subcarriers are obtained by computing the moving average in the
frequency domain of the time-averaged reference signal subcarriers, i.e. every
third subcarrier. The moving average window size is 19. For reference
subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel the window size is reduced
accordingly as per figure G.6.
4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients and to
compute coefficients , for each subcarrier.
The equalized samples are called Z'~eq~(f,t).

# G.7 EVM
## G.7.1 General
For EVM create two sets of Z'~eq~(f,t)., according to the timing "ΔC \--W/2
and ΔC +W/2", using the equalizer coefficients from G.3.4.
The equivalent ideal samples are calculated form i~1~(ν) (clause G.2.3) and
are called I(f,t).
The EVM is the difference between the ideal waveform and the measured and
equalized waveform.
,
where
is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active
within the subframe or within the sTTI,
is the set of subcarriers within the resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme being active in symbol _t_ ,
_is_ the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in accordance
with relevant Test models,
is the equalized signal under test.
NOTE 1: Although the basic unit of measurement is one subframe or one sTTI,
the equalizer is calculated over the entire 10 subframes measurement period to
reduce the impact of noise in the reference symbols.
NOTE 2: Applicability of EVM calculation:
One EVM value is associated to 12 subcarriers times 1 subframe = pair of 2 RBs
= 168 resource elements. For sTTI, one EVM value is associated to 12
subcarriers times 1 slot or 84 resource elements (slot TTI) or times 1 subslot
or 24/36 resrouce elements (subslot TTI).
But only a reduced number of REs in this pair of 2 RBs contribute to EVM.
Those are the PDSCH or sPDSCH REs, containing the considered modulation
scheme. Only those pairs of 2 RBs are evaluated with respect to EVM, which
contain the maximum number of PDSCH or sPDSCH REs. (EVM-relevant location in
the time/frequency grid ) The others are not evaluated.
In specific:
\- For bandwidth 1.4 MHz:
\- Only the pairs of 2 RBs containing 138 PDSCH REs are used for EVM. Only
those 138 REs contribute to EVM
\- All pairs of 2 RBs, which contain less than 138 PDSCH REs, are not
evaluated with respect to EVM.
\- For all other Bandwidths:
\- Only the pairs of 2 RBs containing 150 PDSCH REs are used for EVM. Only
those 150 REs contribute to EVM
\- All pairs of 2 RBs, which contain less than 150 PDSCH REs, are not
evaluated with respect to EVM.
\- For sTTI and all bandwidths:
\- Only when EVM value could be evaluated over [84] sPDSCH REs for slot TTI or
[24 or 36] sPDSCH REs for subslot TTI, value is considered for EVM.
\- When there are less than [84] REs for slot TTI or [24 or 36] REs for
subslot TTI value is not considered with respect to EVM.
This restriction serves to avoid weighted averaging in G.7.2.
## G.7.2 Averaged EVM
EVM is averaged over all allocated EVM relevant locations in the frequency
domain, and 10 consecutive downlink subframes (10 ms):
is derived by: square the EVM results in G.7.1, sum the squares over all EVM
relevant locations in the time/frequency grid, divide the sum by the number of
EVM relevant locations, square-root the quotient.
The EVM requirements should be tested against the maximum of the average EVM
at the window W extremities of the EVM measurements:
Thus is calculated using in the expressions above and is calculated using . (l
and h, low and high. Where l is the timing ΔC --W/2 and and high is the timing
ΔC +W/2)
Thus we get:
For TDD special fields (DwPTS and GP) are not included in the averaging.
## G.7.3 Averaged EVM (TDD)
For TDD the averaging in the time domain can be calculated from subframes or
slots (for slot TTI) of different frames and should have a minimum of 10
subframes averaging length. TDD special fields (DwPTS and GP) are not included
in the averaging.
~frame~ is derived by: Square the EVM results in a frame. Relevant for EVM are
subframes or slots (for slot TTI) in a frame, which are active in the DL,
_Ndl_. Within these subframes or slots, those RBs are relevant, that carry the
maximum number of PDSCH REs (same as FDD) or sPDSCH REs (slot TTI). Sum the
squares, divide the sum by the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root
the quotient. (RMS)
The EVM~frame~ is calculated, using the maximum of ~frame~ at the window W
extremities. Thus is calculated using and is calculated using . (l and h, low
and high. Where l is the timing ΔC --W/2 and and high is the timing ΔC +W/2)
In order to unite at least 10 subframes, consider the minimum integer number
of radio frames, containing at least 10 EVM relevant subframes. Unite by RMS.
,
The result, , is compared against the limit.
