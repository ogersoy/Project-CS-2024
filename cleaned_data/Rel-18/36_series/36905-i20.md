# 1 Scope
The present document specifies and contains the derivation of Test Points for
RF test cases, thereby 3GPP TSG RAN WG5 will have a way of storing the input
contributions provided. The test cases are described in TS36.521-1[2] and TS
36.521-4 [5].
The test cases which have been analysed to determine Test Points are included
as .zip files.
The present document is applicable from Release 10 up to the release indicated
on the front page of the present Terminal conformance specifications.

# 4 Test coverage analysis
## 4.1 Test point selection in Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) test
cases
When deriving test points for these test cases the calculation of maximum
output power backoff and determination of possible worst cases for out-of-band
emissions are non-trivial and therefore require an analysis which is
documented here.
### 4.1.1 A-MPR test case for single carrier
This section contains information on test point selection for test case 6.2.4
in [2], Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR).
Test points in this test were added in the past, and no selection information
is therefore available prior the NS values in table 4.1.1-1.
Selection of test points should include some possible worst combinations based
on the A-MPR characteristics specified for each NS value and these shall be
selected so that they match with corresponding spectrum emission requirements
test points. The number of test points should be realistic.

The analyses for UE category M1 and category M2 are performed per NS-value in
table 4.1.1-2 for category M1, table 4.1.1-2a for category M1 with subPRB
allocation and in table 4.1.1-3 for category M2. The general principles for
selection of test points are:
\- For Additional spurious emissions, requirements are the same for all
bandwidths. Since channel bandwidth is not judged to have any impact on the UE
transmit signal for category M1, only one bandwidth needs to be tested. The
lowest bandwidth with emissions requirement has lowest guard band and is
therefore the most stringent. For category M2 the same applies, with the
exception that channel bandwidth 5 MHz is always additionally selected, even
if this is not the smallest bandwidth. Because maximum RB allocation of 24
resource blocks requires at least 5 MHz channel bandwidth.
\- For NS-values with Additional SEM requirement and without any allowed
A-MPR, same test points as in SEM test case 6.6.2.1EA for category M1 and same
test points as in SEM test case 6.6.2.1EC for category M2 can be used.
\- For NS-values with Additional Spurious requirement and without any allowed
A-MPR, same test points as in spurious test case 6.6.3EA.1 for category M1 and
same test points as in spurious test case 6.6.3EC.1 for category M2 can be
used
\- For Additional SEM, test frequency is selected as in SEM test case.
\- For Additional spurious emissions, test frequency selection depends on if
protected range is above or below the UE transmit signal in frequency. If
protected range is above UE transmit frequency, then High frequency range is
selected. If protected range is below UE transmit frequency, then Low
frequency range is selected.

### 4.1.3 A-MPR test case for inter-band UL CA
This section contains information on test point selection for test case
6.2.4A.2 in [2], Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) for CA (inter-band
DL CA and UL CA).
TS 36.101 [3] specifies band dependent NS-values, which in the inter-band UL
CA test cases become a combination of two NS-values. Testing all possible
combinations would lead to too excessive testing and the combinations that are
realistic should therefore be prioritized. This selection is documented in
table 4.1.3-1.

The analyses are performed per NS-value and are stored as zip-files as defined
in annex A. The general principle for selection of test points is:
\- Test the minimum MPR + A-MPR value
\- Test the maximum MPR + A-MPR value
> \- Test the maximum unbalanced total power backoff among CCs (max P~cmaxc~
> difference).
>
> The analyses are done for QPSK/16QAM test cases. For 64QAM test cases no
> analysis is made due to that it follows the same selection principle.
### 4.1.4 A-MPR test case for V2X test cases
This section contains information on test point selection for test cases
6.2.4G Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR) for V2X.
Selection of test points should include some possible worst combinations based
on the A-MPR characteristics specified for each NS value and these shall be
selected so that they match with corresponding spectrum emission requirements
test points. The number of test points should be realistic.

## 4.2 Test frequency and bandwidth selection in Reference sensitivity test
cases
The determination of test frequency and channel bandwidths are made
considering test time, possible worst cases and operator deployments. This is
non-trivial and requires an analysis which is documented here.
### 4.2.1 Reference sensitivity level for single carrier
This section contains information on test point selection for test case 7.3 in
[2], Reference sensitivity level
Test points in this test were added in the past, and no selection information
is therefore available.
### 4.2.2 Reference sensitivity level for intra-band contiguous CA
This section contains information on test point selection for test cases
7.3A.1 - Reference sensitivity level for CA (intra-band contiguous DL CA and
UL CA) and 7.3A.2 - Reference sensitivity level for CA (intra-band contiguous
DL CA without UL CA).
In this test case, there are no CA configuration specific test points. The
general rule of Low, High test frequency and Lowest N~RB_agg~, Highest
N~RB_agg~ is chosen for any CA configuration.
### 4.2.3 Reference sensitivity level for inter-band CA
This section contains information on test point selection for test case 7.3A.3
- Reference sensitivity level for CA (inter-band DL CA without UL CA)
In this test case, there are default test points to be used unless CA
configuration specific test points are over-ruling in table 4.2.3-1. The
default rule of Mid test frequency and Highest N~RB_agg~ is chosen for any CA
configuration.

### 4.2.4 Reference sensitivity level for intra-band non-contiguous CA
This section contains information on test point selection for test case 7.3A.4
Reference sensitivity level for CA (intra-band non-contiguous DL CA without UL
CA).
Testpoint choice is based on the Table 7.3A.0-3. Only largest PCC BW + largest
SCC BW and largest PCC BW + smallest SCC BW are tested. All corner cases VS
W~gap~ specified for those 2 BW combinations in the Table 7.3A.0-3 are tested,
larger W~gap~ being considered worse. PCC is allocated to the upper carrier,
unless DL Band is below UL Band and wider operating band width than UL. Most
testpoint IDs for FDD bands have to be tested twice, once with RB allocation
applicable to PCC REFSENS test, which is the standard single carrier RB
allocation, and once with RB Allocation applicable to SCC REFSENS test, as per
Table 7.3A.0-3.
### 4.2.5 Reference sensitivity level for 3DL CA
This section contains information on test point selection for test case 7.3A.5
Reference sensitivity level for 3DL CA.
In the applicability conditions in TS 36.521-2 [4] it is defined that if the
3DL test is performed, testing of some fallback cases can be skipped ,
specifically:
> \- 2DL fallback 3DL/1UL -> 2DL/1UL: Test of fallback can be skipped in many
> cases. Analysis supplied per CA configuration later in this clause.
>
> \- 2DL fallback 3DL/2UL -> 2DL/2UL: It is FFS if fallback need to be tested
>
> \- 1UL fallback 3DL/2UL -> 3DL/1UL: Test of fallback is required due to
> different minimum requirements.
This implies that the test point analysis described later in this section
currently only considers 1UL.4.2.5.1 Intra-band
In this case, there are default test points to be used unless CA configuration
specific test points are over-ruling. The default rule of Low and High test
frequency, Lowest and Highest N~RB_agg~ is chosen for any CA configuration.
Editor's note: The specific test points for reference sensitivity level and
3DL CA Intra-band are under investigation.
#### 4.2.5.2 Inter-band
In this case, there are default test points to be used unless CA configuration
specific test points are over-ruling in table 4.2.5.2-1. The default rule of
Mid test frequency and Highest N~RB_agg~ is chosen for any CA configuration.
For CA configurations where default test points are used and 2DL fallback
cases also use default test points there is no need for justification in Table
4.2.5.2-1.
Selection of test points should include some possible worst combinations and
these can be based on operator preference in case of the CA configuration is
operator specific. The number of test points should not exceed the total
number of the maximum number of the test points to cover fallback of 2DL CA
case.

#### 4.2.5.3 Intra-band contiguous + Inter-band
In this test case, there are default test points to be used unless CA
configuration specific test points are over-ruling in table 4.2.5.3-1. The
default rule of Low and High test frequency for the band with 2 CC and Mid
test frequency for the band with 1CC, Lowest and Highest N~RB_agg~ for the
band with 2 CC and Highest N~RB_agg~ for the band with 1 CC is chosen for any
CA configuration. For CA configurations where default test points are used and
2DL fallback cases also use default test points there is no need for
justification in Table 4.2.5.3-1.

#### 4.2.5.4 Intra-band non-contiguous + Inter-band
In this test case, there are default test points for each intra-band non-
contiguous band to be used unless CA configuration specific test points are
over-ruling in table 4.2.5.4-1. The default test points are based on fallback
non-contiguous CA test points, with the inter-band CC using Max N~RB~ and Mid
test frequency, as per default Inter-Band test points. For CA configurations
where default test points are used and 2DL fallback cases also use default
test points there is no need for justification in Table 4.2.5.4-1.

#### 4.2.5.5 Intra-band non-contiguous + Intra-band contiguous
Testpoint choice is based on the Table 7.3A.0-3. Only largest PCC sub-block BW
/ N~RB_agg~ + largest SCC-only sub-block BW / N~RB_agg~ and largest PCC sub-
block BW / N~RB_agg~ + smallest SCC-only sub-block BW / N~RB_agg~ are tested.
All corner cases VS W~gap~ specified for those 2 BW combinations in the Table
7.3A.0-3 are tested, larger W~gap~ being considered worse. PCC is allocated to
the highest carrier, unless DL Band is below UL Band and wider operating band
width than UL. Most testpoint IDs for FDD bands have to be tested twice, once
with RB allocation applicable to PCC REFSENS test, which is the standard
single carrier RB allocation, and once with RB Allocation applicable to SCC
REFSENS test, as per Table 7.3A.0-3.
### 4.2.6 Reference sensitivity level for 4DL CA
This section contains information on test point selection for test case 7.3A.9
Reference sensitivity level for 4DL CA.
In the applicability conditions in TS 36.521-2 [4] it is defined that if the
4DL test is performed, testing of any 3DL or 2DL fallbacks can be skipped
specifically:
> \- 3DL fallback 4DL/1UL -> 3DL/1UL: Test of fallback can be skipped in many
> cases. Analysis supplied per CA configuration later in this clause.
>
> \- 3DL fallback 4DL/2UL -> 3DL/2UL: It is FFS if fallback need to be tested.
>
> \- 1UL fallback 4DL/2UL -> 4DL/1UL: Test of fallback is required due to
> different minimum requirements.
This implies that the test point analysis described later in this section
currently only considers 1UL.
#### 4.2.6.1 Intra-band contiguous
FFS
#### 4.2.6.2 Inter-band
In this case, there are default test points to be used unless CA configuration
specific test points are over-ruling in table 4.2.6.2-1. The default rule of
Mid test frequency and Highest N~RB_agg~ is chosen for any CA configuration.
For CA configurations where default test points are used and the 3DL fallback
cases also use default test points there is no need for justification in Table
4.2.6.2-1.
Selection of test points should include some possible worst combinations and
these can be based on operator preference in case of the CA configuration is
operator specific. The number of test points should not exceed the total
number of the maximum number of the test points to cover fallback of 2DL and
3DL CA case.

## 4.3 Test points selection and Frequency ranges to cover in Tx spurious
emissions test cases for UL CA
In this case, it is sufficient to verify the minimum requirements in frequency
ranges affected by 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order intermodulation products. The
frequency ranges and UL RB allocations used in the test are calculated here.
The analyses are performed per CA configuration and are stored as zip-files as
defined in annex A.

## 4.4 Test points selection in 3DL Receiver test cases to align with 2DL test
cases and skipping of 2DL fallback
This section contains information, per test case, for 2DL and 3DL CA Receiver
test cases about alignment of test parameters between 2DL and 3DL variant of
the same test, and recommendation on possible skipping of 2DL test if 3DL test
is performed.
Editor's note: Information about alignment of test parameters between 2DL and
3DL variant of the same test will be added in this section for relevant test
cases.
## 4.5 Test points selection for test cases in TS 36.521-4
Editor's Note: general rules of test point selection for Rx test cases are
TBD.
This section contains information on test points selection for IoT NTN test
cases in [5]. The general rules in this section
apply to all the IoT NTN test cases. Separate analysis is not provided for
each single test case unless specific test requirement deviates from the
general rules.
##### General rules of test point selection for Tx test cases {#general-rules-
of-test-point-selection-for-tx-test-cases .H6}
Considering that IoT NTN operating bands are defined like FR1 FDD bands, test
environment, frequencies, SCSs, channel bandwidths, waveforms, and modulations
of a Tx test for an IoT NTN band should be selected based on the same
principles of the corresponding single carrier test for an FR1 FDD band.

###### ## Annex A: Derivation documents
The documents (and spreadsheets where applicable) used to give the background
for the selected test points for each test case are included in the present
document as zip files.
The name of the zip shall:
\- Include a prefix allowing easier grouping of files in the same area, e.g.
"TestReqTxSpur2UL".
\- Include Test Case Number(s), e.g. "6.6.3.1A.2+6.6.3.2A.2".
\- In cases where multiple analysis is needed per test cases, e.g. for
different CA configurations, include the CA band combination applicable in the
parentheses, e.g. add "(1A-3A)" for CA_1A-3A.
> Concatenated example file name:
> "TestReqTxSpur2UL_6.6.3.1A.2+6.6.3.2A.2(1A-3A).zip".
If there is an update of test points for a test case the old corresponding zip
file shall be replaced with a new zip file with a version stepping in the file
name. e.g. "TestReqTxSpur2UL_6.6.3.1A.2+6.6.3.2A.2(1A-3A)_V2.zip". The aim is
to provide a reference to completed test cases, so that test points for
similar test cases can be selected on a common basis.
