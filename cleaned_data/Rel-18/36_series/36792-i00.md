# Introduction
_In Rel-14 and Rel-16, RAN introduced a set of features under the umbrella of
"LTE based 5G terrestrial broadcast" that, together with the corresponding
enhancements in the core network, enable the deployment of a downlink-only
dedicated broadcast network using 3GPP technologies._
_A clear target spectrum for this technology is the_ **portion of UHF spectrum
allocated to broadcast systems (\~470 - \~694/698MHz, depending on the
region)**_. The objective of this work item is to introduce the necessary
features for LTE based 5G terrestrial broadcast to operate in the_ **portion
of UHF spectrum allocated to broadcast systems** _in different regions of the
globe. For instance:_
\- For ITU region 1, a channelization of 8MHz is used.
\- For ITU region 2, a channelization of 6MHz is used.
\- In some countries (e.g. North America), frequencies above 614MHz are used
by FDD (B71).
\- For ITU region 3, different channelizations (6/7/8MHz) are used in
different countries, for instance China and India are using 8MHz.
\- In China broadcast systems are using the spectrum ranges 470 -- 702 MHz..
\- In India broadcast systems are using the spectrum ranges 470 -- 610 MHz and
614 -- 698 MHz.
_In this work, at least the following specifications are to be taken into
account, and requirements reused when available:_
\- For ITU region 1, requirements defined in ETSI EN 302 296 and GE06
Agreement.
\- For ITU region 2:
\- In United States, Title 47 CFR 73.622.
\- In Brazil, ABNT 15601.
\- For ITU region 3, in China, GB20600-2006.

# 4 Spectrum limit masks for digital terrestrial television broadcasting
## 4.1 General
In order to avoid referring to national regulations since they vary from
country to country, instead this TR refers to the Recommendation ITU-R BT.1206
[2] Spectrum limit masks for digital terrestrial television broadcasting. The
spectrum masks defined in the recommendation are not based on the ITU-R Region
but on the DTT system.
Currently there are 4 different DTT systems in operation worldwide:
\- Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC)
\- Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB-T)
\- Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting (ISDB-T)
\- Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast (DTMB)
Besides, different TV channel raster are currently in use (6, 7, and 8 MHz).
ATSC1.0 spectrum masks are also considered for ATSC3.0. Furthermore, DVB-T2
uses the same spectrum masks as DVB-T, and DTMB-A uses the same spectrum masks
as DTMB.
Each of these DTT systems can be used in different ITU-R Regions. Although the
majority of Region 1 countries use DVB-T (or DVB-T2), there are some countries
in Region 1 using ISDB-T or DTMB. Likewise, although in Region 2 ATSC (or ATSC
3.0) is used in North America and ISDB-T is used in most of Central America,
South America, and the Caribbean, there are some countries in Region 2 using
DVB-T/T2 or DTMB. Finally, in Region 3, all four DTT systems (or their
corresponding second-generation systems) are used in different countries.
Regarding the UHF TV channel raster, only ITU-R Region 1 is fully harmonized
using 8 MHz channels.
In Regions 2 and 3, there are different countries using all three UHF TV
channel raster (6, 7, and 8 MHz).
Therefore, it is advisable to refer to the spectrum masks defined in
Recommendation ITU-R BT.1206 [2] to enhance the compatibility of LTE-based 5G
terrestrial broadcast with existing DTT systems, not based on ITU-R Region,
but based on the DTT system and UHF TV channel raster adopted in each country.
In addition to the ITU-R BT.1206, GE06 [5] shall be considered as a regulatory
reference for ITU Region 1 in respect to OOB emissions. Existing 3GPP Specs
with relation to Out-of-Band emissions shall be considered as well.
## 4.2 Scope {#scope-2}
This Technical Report provides specific spectrum limit masks for digital
terrestrial television broadcasting systems specified in Recommendation ITU-R
BT.1306. While Recommendation ITU-R SM.1541 provides out-of-band domain
emission limits that should be regarded as generic spectrum limit masks,
specific spectrum limit masks might be required for specific environments to
enhance compatibility with other radiocommunication services.
## 4.3 Specific spectrum limit masks for digital terrestrial television system
A (ATSC)
### 4.3.1 General
The spectrum limit masks described in this section are applicable to the ITU-R
digital terrestrial television broadcasting (DTTB) System A (ATSC) employing
the 6 MHz single carrier modulation scheme, eight-level Vestigial-SideBand
(8-VSB) modulation.
This section applied only to Countries/regions where ATSC1.0 may co-exist with
LTE-based 5G Broadcast.
### 4.3.2 Sampling the transmitter output
To examine the spectrum, the output port of the transmitter (including any RF
channel-defining filters) is connected to a spectrum analyser via a coupler or
sampling device inserted in the transmission line (coaxial cable or waveguide)
between the transmitter and its load or antenna. During the measurement, the
transmitter may be operated into either an antenna or a dummy load. The dummy
load is preferred, as it minimizes possible problems with off-air signal
ingress. The spectrum shaping limits are based upon a measurement (or
resolution) bandwidth of 500 kHz. Other measurement bandwidths may be used as
long as appropriate correction factors are applied. Measurements need not be
made any closer to the channel edge than one-half of the resolution bandwidth
of the measuring instrument.
### 4.3.3 Spectrum limit masks for 6 MHz DTTB systems using 8-VSB modulation
#### 4.3.3.1 General
The following 6 MHz DTTB spectrum limit masks required outside of the 6 MHz
channel are stated relative to a reference amplitude. The reference amplitude
for the spectrum shaping limit is the total transmitter output power,
including the pilot signal, contained within the 6 MHz channel. Three cases
are considered below. The "high power" spectrum limit mask is intended for
high-power transmitters which service large populated areas. These
transmitters may be co-located with similar transmitters on adjacent channels
avoiding interference. The "low power" spectrum limit mask is intended for low
power television (LPTV) transmitters and translators. An LPTV transmitter
provides a locally- oriented television service in small communities both
rural and within larger urban areas. TV translator stations are stations in
the broadcast service operated for the purpose of retransmitting the
programmes and signals of a TV broadcast station in areas of poor reception.
The "simple" spectrum limit mask is also intended for LPTV transmitters and
translators in locations where such transmitters and translators will not
cause interference.
#### 4.3.3.2 High power DTTB spectrum limit mask
The spectrum shaping limit in the range between one-half of the width of the
resolution bandwidth filter used and 500 kHz from the channel edge relative to
the total transmitter output power shall be:
Spectrum shaping limit â‰¤ --47 (dB~DTV~)
The spectrum shaping limit at any frequency between 500 kHz and 6 MHz from the
channel edge should be:
Spectrum shaping limit â‰¤ -(11.5 (\|Î”F\| -- 0.5) + 47) (dB~DTV~)
where:
Î”F is the frequency difference, in MHz, from the channel edge.
The spectrum shaping limit at any frequency more than 6 MHz from the channel
edge should be:
Spectrum shaping limit â‰¤ --110 dB~DTV~
The spectrum limit mask for a high power DTTB transmitter is illustrated
graphically in Figure 4.3.3.2-1.

#### 4.3.3.3 Low power DTTB spectrum limit mask for LPTV transmitters and
translators
The spectrum shaping limit in the range between one-half of the width of the
resolution bandwidth filter used and 500 kHz from the channel edge relative to
the total transmitter output power shall be:
Spectrum shaping limit â‰¤ --47 (dB~DTV~)
The spectrum shaping limit at any frequency between 500 kHz and 3 MHz from the
channel edge should be:
Spectrum shaping limit â‰¤ -(11.5 (\|Î”F\| -- 0.5) + 47) (dB~DTV~)
where:
Î”F is the frequency difference, in MHz, from the channel edge.
The spectrum shaping limit at any frequency more than 3 MHz from the channel
edge should be:
Spectrum shaping limit â‰¤ --76 dB~DTV~

translators
The spectrum shaping limit in the range between one-half of the width of the
resolution bandwidth filter used and 6 MHz from the channel edge relative to
the total transmitter output power shall be:
Spectrum shaping limit â‰¤ -((Î”F^2^/1.44) + 46) (dB~DTV~)
where:
Î”F is the frequency difference, in MHz, from the channel edge.
The spectrum shaping limit at any frequency more than 6 MHz from the channel
edge should be:
Spectrum shaping limit â‰¤ --77 dB~DTV~

For 7 MHz digital television, the OoB domain extends from Â±3.5 MHz (i.e. Â±0.5
Ã— 7 MHz) to Â±17.5 MHz (i.e. Â±2.5 Ã— 7 MHz) relative to channel centre.
Two spectrum masks are specified in Figure 4.6.2-1 and the associated Table
4.6.2-1. The upper curve defines the spectrum mask for the non-sensitive cases
and the lower curve defines the spectrum mask for the sensitive cases.

### 4.6.3 Specific spectrum limit masks for 8 MHz channelling system D (DTMB)
When the digital system operates on a lower or higher adjacent channel to a
co-sited transmitter, the spectrum limit mask of system D with 8 MHz channel
spacing for different application scenarios are given by Figures 4.6.3-1 and
4.6.3-2. Detailed data of Figures 4.6.3-1 and 4.6.3-2. were presented by
Tables 4.6.3-1 and 4.6.3-2., respectively.
The masks shown in Figure 4.6.3-1 show the minimum protection needed for
analogue television where the analogue and the digital television transmitters
are co-sited and are applicable for cases where:
\- no polarization discrimination between digital and analogue television is
used; and
\- the radiated power from both transmitters is the same (analogue sync-peak
power equal to total power from the digital television transmitter). If the
radiated powers from the two transmitters are not identical, proportional
correction can be applied as follows:
\- correction = minimum analogue erp âˆ’ maximum digital erp.

# A.1 Scope
The present document specifies technical characteristics and methods of
measurements for digital terrestrial television transmitters as defined in
Table A.1-1 and A.1-2. The power classification (Table A.1-1) and emission
classification (Table A.1-2) are combined to define a transmitter category.
For example, power classification H and emission classification 0 denote a
high-power transmitter (category H0) whose OOB emissions comply with a non-
critical mask.

## A.2.3 Transmitter spurious emissions
### A.2.3.1 Definition
Spurious emissions are unwanted emissions at frequencies separated by more
than 250 % of the channel bandwidth from the centre of the occupied spectrum.
These include harmonic emissions, parasitic emissions, intermodulation
products and frequency conversion products but exclude out-of-band emissions.
For the purposes of the present document spurious emissions are emissions at
frequencies outside the frequency range f~0~ Â± 17.5 MHz for 7 MHz channels,
f~0~ Â± 20 MHz for 8 MHz channels, where f~0~ is the centre frequency of the
channel, irrespective of the number of carriers employed.
### A.2.3.2 Limits
Spurious emissions shall not exceed the values set out in Table A.2.3.2-1
additionally shown in Figure A.2.3.2-1, for the frequency range 9 kHz to 3
GHz.
