# 1 Scope
The present document describes the security features and a mechanism to
bootstrap authentication and key agreement for application security from the
3GPP AKA mechanism. Candidate applications to use this bootstrapping mechanism
include but are not restricted to subscriber certificate distribution TS
33.221 [5]. Subscriber certificates support services whose provision mobile
operator assists, as well as services that mobile operator provides.
The scope of this specification includes a generic AKA bootstrapping function,
an architecture overview and the detailed procedure how to bootstrap the
credential.
Clause 4 of this specification describes a mechanism, called GBA_ME, to
bootstrap authentication and key agreement, which does not require any changes
to the UICC. Clause 5 of this specification describes a mechanism, called
GBA_U, to bootstrap authentication and key agreement, which does require
changes to the UICC, but provides enhanced security by storing certain derived
keys on the UICC.

# 3 Definitions, abbreviations symbols and conventions
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**Application: In all places in this document where the term application is
used to refer to a service offered by the MNO or a third party to the mobile
subscriber, then it always denotes the type of application and not the actual
instance of an application installed on an application server.**
**Bootstrapping Server Function:** BSF is hosted in a network element under
the control of an MNO. BSF, HSS, and UEs participate in GBA in which a shared
secret is established between the network and a UE by running the
bootstrapping procedure. The shared secret can be used between NAFs and UEs,
for example, for authentication purposes.
**Bootstrapping Usage Procedure: A procedure using bootstrapped security
association over Ua reference point.**
**GBA Function: A function on the ME executing the bootstrapping procedure
with BSF (i.e. supporting the Ub reference point) and providing Ua
applications with security association to run bootstrapping usage procedure.
GBA function is called by a Ua application when a Ua application wants to use
bootstrapped security association.**
**ME-based GBA:** in GBA_ME, all GBA-specific functions are carried out in the
ME. The UICC is GBA-unaware. If the term GBA is used in this document without
any further qualification then always GBA_ME is meant, see clause 4 of this
specification.
**UICC-based GBA:** this is a GBA with UICC-based enhancement. In GBA_U, the
GBA-specific functions are split between ME and UICC, see clause 5 of this
specification.
**Network Application Function:** NAF is hosted in a network element. GBA may
be used between NAFs and UEs for authentication purposes, and for securing the
communication path between the UE and the NAF.
**Bootstrapping Transaction Identifier:** the bootstrapping transaction
identifier (B-TID) is used to bind the subscriber identity to the keying
material in reference points Ua, Ub and Zn.
**GBA User Security Settings:** GUSS contains the BSF specific information
element and the set of all application-specific USSs.
**GUSS timestamp:** the timestamp of the GUSS is set by the HSS. It changes
whenever the HSS has modified the GUSS.
**NAF Group: A grouping of NAFs to allow assignment of different USSs to NAFs
representing the same application. This grouping is done in each home network
separately, i.e. one NAF contacting BSFs in different home networks belongs to
different groups in every home network.**
**NAF_Id** : The FQDN of the NAF, concatenated with the Ua security protocol
identifier.
**Temporary IP Multimedia Private Identity:** a temporary identity which is
used on the Ub interface to prevent passive eavesdropping attacks against the
IMPI.
**Ua Application: An application on the ME intended to run bootstrapping usage
procedure with a NAF.**
**Ua security protocol identifier** : An identifier which is associated with a
security protocol over Ua.
**User Security Setting:** A USS is an application and subscriber specific
parameter set that defines two parts, an authentication part, which contains
the list of identities of the user needed for the application (e.g. IMPUs,
MSISDN, pseudonyms), and an authorisation part, which contains the user
permission flags (e.g. access to application allowed, type of certificates
which may be issued). In addition, a USS may contain a key selection
indication, which is used in the GBA_U case to mandate the usage of either the
ME-based key (Ks_(ext)_NAF) or the UICC-based key (Ks_int_NAF) or both.
Sometimes also called application-specific user security setting. The USS is
delivered to the BSF as a part of GUSS from the HSS, and from the BSF to the
NAF if requested by the NAF.

## 3.4 Conventions
All data variables in this specification are presented with the most
significant substring on the left hand side and the least significant
substring on the right hand side. A substring may be a bit, byte or other
arbitrary length bitstring. Where a variable is broken down into a number of
substrings, the leftmost (most significant) substring is numbered 0, the next
most significant is numbered 1, and so on through to the least significant.
# 4 Generic Bootstrapping Architecture
The 3GPP authentication infrastructure, including the 3GPP Authentication
Centre (AuC), the USIM or the ISIM, and the 3GPP AKA protocol run between
them, is a very valuable asset of 3GPP operators. It has been recognised that
this infrastructure could be leveraged to enable application functions in the
network and on the user side to establish shared keys. Therefore, 3GPP can
provide the \"bootstrapping of application security\" to authenticate the
subscriber by defining a Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) based on AKA
protocol.
## 4.1 Reference model
For HLR and HSS definitions used in this chapter refer to [34].
When HSS is mentioned in this specification without an indication of supported
reference point towards the BSF, then the support of the Zh reference point is
meant.
Figure 4.1 shows a simple network model of the entities involved in the
bootstrapping approach when an HSS with Zh reference point is deployed, and
the reference points used between them.
Figure 4.1: Simple network model for bootstrapping involving HSS with Zh
reference point
Figure 4.1a shows a simple network model of the entities involved when the
network application function is located in the visited network.
NOTE: The Zn\' reference point is distinguished from the Zn reference point in
that it is used between operators.
Figure 4.1a: Simple network model for bootstrapping in visited network
involving HSS with Zh reference point
Figure 4.1b shows a simple network model of the entities involved in the
bootstrapping approach when either an HLR or an HSS without Zh reference point
support is deployed, and the reference points used between them. The reference
point Zh\' is optional for the BSF to support.

an HSS without Zh reference point support
## 4.2 Network elements
### 4.2.1 Bootstrapping server function (BSF)
A generic Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) and the UE shall mutually
authenticate using the AKA protocol, and agree on session keys that are
afterwards applied between UE and a Network Application Function (NAF). The
BSF shall restrict the applicability of the key material to a specific NAF by
using the key derivation procedure as specified in Annex B. The key derivation
procedure may be used with multiple NAFs during the lifetime of the key
material. The lifetime of the key material is set according to the local
policy of the BSF. The generation of key material is specified in clause
4.5.2.
The BSF shall be able to acquire the GBA user security settings (GUSS) from
the HSS.
The BSF shall be able to keep a list, which assigns NAFs to NAF Groups. This
list is used to select if any and which application-specific USS within GUSS
is valid for a certain NAF.
NOTE 1: The operator does the assignment of NAFs to NAF Groups. NAF Group
definitions in HSS and all connected BSFs belonging to the same operator\'s
network shall be equal (cf., clause 4.2.3). As these network elements belong
to the same operator\'s network, standardisation of the NAF Group definitions
themselves is not necessary in 3GPP.
NOTE 2: The NAF grouping may be e.g. \"home\" and \"visited\". It allows the
BSF to send USSs for the same application with e.g. different authorization
flags to different NAFs, e.g., in home network and visited networks. The NAF
e.g. in visited network indicates only the requested application, but it is
unaware of the grouping in home network of the subscriber.
NOTE 3: If support of GBA User Security Settings (GUSS) for service
differentiation or GBA_U is desired in combination with HLR or HSS without Zh
reference point support, then this can be achieved, for instance by storing
the GUSS information in a BSF database (external and/or external to the node
itself), or in any other network database which is deemed as appropriate for a
specific deployment. GUSS information is not sent over Zh\' reference point.
If an HLR or an HSS without Zh reference point support is used within the GBA
architecture, then the BSF needs to be configured to use the Zh\' reference
point with that HLR or HSS. If the Zh reference point is available in the HSS
and the full migration has happened, then it shall be used between the BSF and
the HSS.
NOTE 4: If an operator wants to upgrade from a GBA architecture using HLR or
HSS without Zh reference point support, to one using HSS with Zh reference
point support, then the BSF needs to be configured accordingly to use then the
Zh reference point. This can also involve a configuration, where gradual
replacement is needed. If GBA is deployed from the beginning with an HSS with
Zh reference point support then this kind of configuration is not needed.
NOTE 5: During migration from HLR to HSS, the BSF will need to select for a
subscriber between HSS and HLR\'s. Such a mechanism (e.g. configuration based)
will not be standardized.
### 4.2.2 Network application function (NAF)
After the bootstrapping has been completed, the UE and a NAF can run some
application specific protocol where the authentication of messages will be
based on those session keys generated during the mutual authentication between
UE and BSF.
General assumptions for the functionality of a NAF are:
\- there is no previous security association between the UE and the NAF;
\- NAF shall be able to locate and communicate securely with the subscriber\'s
BSF;
\- NAF shall be able to acquire a shared key material established between UE
and the BSF during the run of the application-specific protocol;
\- NAF shall be able to acquire zero or more application-specific USSs from
the HSS via the BSF;
\- NAF shall be able to set the local validity condition of the shared key
material according to the local policy;
\- in the case of GBA_U, the NAF shall be able to determine which key (i.e.,
Ks_ext_NAF or Ks_int_NAF or both) should be used by using a local policy in
the NAF or a key selection indication in the application-specific USS. If the
NAF has received an application-specific USS, which contains the key selection
indication, this shall override the local policy in the NAF;
\- NAF shall be able to check lifetime and local validity condition of the
shared key material.
NOTE: Without additional measures, GBA does not guarantee the freshness of the
key, Ks(_int/ext)_NAF in the sense that it does not guarantee that the key was
not used in a previous run of the Ua protocol. The additional measures which
may be taken by the UE and the NAF to ensure key freshness in GBA are:
1) enforce a new run of the Ub protocol (thus generating a new Ks) before
deriving a new Ks_NAF.
2) store previously used keys Ks(_int/ext)_NAF, or the corresponding key
identifiers B-TID, until the end of their lifetime.
A UE and a NAF that support a Ua protocol that does not provide replay
protection over unconnected runs of the protocol, will need to take
corresponding action to avoid replay attacks if desired.
### 4.2.2a Zn-Proxy
In the case where UE has contacted a NAF that is operated in another network
than home network, this visited NAF shall use a Zn-Proxy of the NAFs network
to communicate with subscriber's BSF (i.e. home BSF).
NOTE: Zn-Proxy functionality may be implemented as a separate network element,
or be part of any NE in the visited network that implements Diameter/HTTP
proxy functionality (examples of such NE's are the BSF of the network that the
visited NAF belongs to, or an AAA-server, or an HTTP server).
General requirements for the functionality of Zn-Proxy are:
\- Zn-Proxy shall be able to function as a proxy between the visited NAF, and
the subscriber's home BSF;
\- Zn-Proxy shall be able to locate subscriber's home BSF and communicate with
it over secure channel;
\- Zn-Proxy shall be able to validate that the visited NAF is authorized to
participate in GBA and shall be able to assert to subscriber's home BSF the
visited NAFs DNS name. The Zn-Proxy shall also be able to assert to the BSF
that the visited NAF is authorized to request the GBA specific user profiles
contained in the NAF request;
\- the physical security level of the Zn-proxy shall not be lower than the
highest level of the NAFs which it interfaces with.
### 4.2.3 HSS
The set of all user security settings (USSs), i.e. GUSS, is stored in the HSS.
In the case where the subscriber has multiple subscriptions, i.e. multiple
ISIM or USIM applications on the UICC, the HSS may contain one or more GUSSs
that can be mapped to one or more private identities, i.e. IMPIs and IMSIs.
Each of the existing GUSSs shall be mapped to one or more private identities,
but each private identity shall only have zero or one GUSS mapped to it.
The requirements on the HSS are:
\- HSS shall provide the only persistent storage for GUSSs;
\- GUSS shall be defined in such a way that interworking of different
operators for standardised application profiles is possible;
\- GUSS shall be defined in such a way that profiles for operator specific
applications and extensions to existing application profiles are supported
without need for standardisation of these elements.
\- GUSS shall be able to contain application-specific USSs that contain
parameters that are related to key selection indication in the case of GBA_U
(i.e., whether the NAF shall use Ks_ext_NAF or Ks_int_NAF), identification or
authorization information of one or more applications hosted by one ore more
NAFs. Any other types of parameters are not allowed in the application-
specific USS.
NOTE 1: The necessary subscriber profile data may be fetched by the NAF from
its local database without involvement with the HSS.
NOTE 2: One possibility to revoke temporarily an application specific USS from
the GUSS is that the HSS may temporarily remove an application-specific USS
from the GUSS if the service is temporarily revoked from the subscriber. The
GUSS in the BSF is not changed by this operation and only updated when the
existing bootstrapping session times out, or is overwritten by a new
bootstrapping session during which the new modified GUSS is fetched from HSS
along with the AV.
\- GUSS shall be able to contain parameters intended for the BSF usage:
\- the type of the UICC the subscriber is issued (i.e. is it GBA_U aware or
not, cf. subclause 5);
\- subscriber specific key lifetime:
\- optionally the timestamp indicating the time when the GUSS has been last
modified by the HSS.
NOTE 3: These parameters are optional and if they are missing from
subscriber\'s GUSS or subscriber does not have GUSS then the BSF will use the
default values in the BSF local policy defined by the particular MNO.
\- HSS shall be able to assign application-specific USSs to a NAF Group. This
shall be defined in such a way that different USSs for the same application,
but for different groups of NAFs, are possible. The restrictions on the number
of USSs per GUSS are dependent on the usage of NAF Groups by the operator:
\- if no NAF Groups are defined for this application then at most one USS per
application is stored in GUSS;
\- if NAF Groups are defined for this application then at most one USS per
application and NAF Group is stored in GUSS.
\- NAF Group definitions in the HSS and all connected BSFs belonging to the
same operator\'s network shall be equal.
### 4.2.4 UE
The required functionalities from the UE are:
\- the support of HTTP Digest AKA protocol;
\- the capability to use both a USIM and an ISIM in bootstrapping;
\- the capability to select either a USIM or an ISIM to be used in
bootstrapping, when both of them are present;
\- the capability for a Ua application on the ME to indicate to the GBA
Function on the ME the type or the name of UICC application to use in
bootstrapping (see clause 4.4.8);
\- the capability to derive new key material to be used with the protocol over
Ua interface from CK and IK;
\- support of NAF-specific application protocol (For an example see TS 33.221
[5]).
A GBA-aware ME shall support both GBA_U, as specified in clause 5.2.1 and
GBA_ME procedures, as specified in clause 4.5.
### 4.2.5 SLF
The SLF:
\- is queried by the BSF in conjunction with the Zh interface operation to get
the name of the HSS containing the required subscriber specific data.
\- is accessed via the Dz interface by the BSF.
The SLF is not required in a single HSS environment. Use of SLF is not
required when BSF are configured/managed to use pre-defined HSS.
### 4.2.6 HLR
If a HLR is used, then the requirement on the HLR is:
\- The HLR shall support the request from the BSF for the required
authentication vector.
## 4.3 Bootstrapping architecture and reference points
### 4.3.1 Reference point Ub
The reference point Ub is between the UE and the BSF. Reference point Ub
provides mutual authentication between the UE and the BSF. It allows the UE to
bootstrap the session keys based on 3GPP AKA infrastructure.
The HTTP Digest AKA protocol, which is specified in RFC 3310 [4], is used on
the reference point Ub. It is based on the 3GPP AKA TS 33.102 [2] protocol.
The interface to the USIM is as specified in TS 31.102 [1] and to the ISIM is
as specified in TS 31.103 [10].
### 4.3.2 Reference point Ua
The reference point Ua carries the application protocol, which is secured
using the keys material agreed between UE and BSF as a result of the run of
HTTP Digest AKA over reference point Ub. For instance, in the case of support
for subscriber certificates TS 33.221 [5], it is a protocol, which allows the
user to request certificates from the NAF. In this case the NAF would be the
PKI portal.
### 4.3.3 Reference point Zh
The reference point Zh used between the BSF and the HSS allows the BSF to
fetch the required authentication information and all GBA user security
settings from the HSS. The reference point Zh is an intra-operator domain
interface. The interface to the 3G Authentication Centre is HSS-internal, and
it need not be standardised as part of this architecture.
### 4.3.4 Reference point Zn
The reference point Zn is used by the NAF to fetch the key material agreed
during a previous HTTP Digest AKA protocol run over the reference point Ub
from the UE to the BSF. It is also used to fetch application-specific user
security settings from the BSF, if requested by the NAF.
### 4.3.5 Reference point Dz
The reference point Dz used between the BSF and the SLF allows the BSF to get
the name of the HSS containing the required subscriber specific data.
### 4.3.6 Reference point Zh\'
The reference point Zh\' used between the BSF and the HLR allows the BSF to
fetch the required authentication information. The reference point Zh\' is an
intra-operator domain interface.
## 4.4 Requirements and principles for bootstrapping
The following requirements and principles are applicable to bootstrapping
procedure:
\- the bootstrapping function shall not depend on the particular NAF;
\- the server implementing the bootstrapping function needs to be trusted by
the home operator to handle authentication vectors;
\- the server implementing the NAF needs only to be trusted by the home
operator to handle derived key material;
\- it shall be possible to support NAF in the operator\'s home network and in
the visited network;
\- the architecture shall not preclude the support of network application
function in a third network;
\- to the extent possible, existing protocols and infrastructure should be
reused;
\- in order to ensure wide applicability, all involved protocols are preferred
to run over IP;
\- it shall be prevented that a security breach in one NAF who is using the
GBA, can be used by an attacker to mount successful attacks to the other NAFs
using the GBA.
\- an attacker shall not be able to exploit a security breach in one security
protocol over Ua in order to mount a successful attack against a different
security protocol over Ua.
### 4.4.1 Access Independence
Bootstrapping procedure is access independent. Bootstrapping procedure
requires IP connectivity from UE.
### 4.4.2 Authentication methods
Authentication between the UE and the BSF shall not be possible without a
valid cellular subscription. Authentication shall be based on the 3GPP AKA
protocol.
### 4.4.3 Roaming
The requirements on roaming are:
\- The roaming subscriber shall be able to utilize the bootstrapping function
in the home network. The subscriber shall be able to utilize network
application function that is in a visited network.
\- The home network shall be able to control whether its subscriber is
authorized to use the service in the visited network.
### 4.4.4 Requirements on reference point Ub
The requirements for reference point Ub are:
\- the BSF shall be able to identify the UE;
\- the BSF and the UE shall be able to authenticate each other based on AKA;
\- the BSF shall be able to send a bootstrapping transaction identifier to the
UE;
\- the UE and the BSF shall establish shared keys;
\- the BSF shall be able to indicate to the UE the lifetime of the key
material. The key lifetime sent by the BSF over Ub shall indicate the expiry
time of the key.
NOTE 1: This does not preclude a UE to refresh the key before the expiry time
according to the UE\'s local policy.
\- the BSF and the UE shall protect the permanent user identity IMPI against
passive eavesdropping attacks by using a temporary identity. The support of
the temporary identity by UE or BSF shall not preclude a successful
bootstrapping procedure if the other entity conforms to an earlier release of
this specification and does not support the use of a temporary identity.
NOTE 2: User identity privacy can be achieved only when both, UE and BSF,
support the use of a temporary identity.
NOTE 3: The use of a temporary identity is not required for 2G GBA (cf. Annex
I) as the IMPI is already protected by the mandatory TLS tunnel.
### 4.4.5 Requirements on reference point Zh
The requirements for reference point Zh are:
\- mutual authentication, confidentiality and integrity shall be provided;
NOTE 1: This requirement may be fulfilled by physical or proprietary security
measures since BSF and HSS are located within the same operator's network.
\- the BSF shall be able to send bootstrapping information request concerning
a subscriber;
\- optionally the BSF may have the capability able to send the timestamp of
subscriber\'s GBA user security settings to the HSS (timestamp option);
\- the HSS shall be able to send one 3GPP AKA vector at a time to the BSF;
\- the HSS shall be able to send the complete set of subscriber\'s GBA user
security settings needed for security purposes to the BSF. Optionally the HSS
may have the capability to indicate to the BSF whether the BSF already has the
latest copy of the GUSS based on the GUSS timestamp (timestamp option);
NOTE 2: If subscriber\'s GUSS is updated in HSS, this is not propagated to the
BSF. The GUSS in the BSF is updated when the BSF next time fetches the
authentication vectors and GUSS from the HSS over Zh reference point as part
of the bootstrapping procedure.
\- no state information concerning bootstrapping shall be required in the HSS;
\- all procedures over reference point Zh shall be initiated by the BSF;
\- the number of different interfaces to HSS should be minimized.
### 4.4.6 Requirements on reference point Zn
The requirements for reference point Zn are:
\- mutual authentication, confidentiality and integrity shall be provided;
\- If the BSF and the NAF are located within the same operator\'s network, the
DIAMETER based Zn reference point shall be secured according to NDS/IP [13] or
may be secured using TLS as specified in Annex E of the present document;
\- If the BSF and the NAF are located in different operators\' networks, the
DIAMETER based Zn\' reference point between the Zn-Proxy and the BSF shall be
secured using TLS as specified in Annex E of the present document;
\- An HTTP based Zn/Zn\' reference point shall be secured using TLS as
specified in Annex E of the present document;
\- The BSF shall verify that the requesting NAF is authorised to obtain the
key material or the key material and the requested USS;
\- The NAF shall be able to send a key material request to the BSF, containing
NAF\'s public hostname used by the UE\'s corresponding request. The BSF shall
be able to verify that a NAF is authorized to use this hostname, i.e. the FQDN
used by UE when it contacts the NAF;
\- The BSF shall be able to send the requested key material to the NAF;
\- The NAF shall be able to get a selected set of application-specific USSs
from the BSF, depending on the policy of the BSF and the application indicated
in the request from the NAF over Zn;
\- The NAF shall be able to indicate to the BSF the single application or
several applications it requires USSs for;
NOTE 2: If some application needs only a subset of an application-specific
USS, e.g. only one IMPU or MSISDN, the NAF selects this subset from the
complete set of USS sent from BSF.
\- The BSF shall be able to be configured on a per NAF or per application
basis
\- whether private subscriber identity, i.e. IMPI, may be sent to the NAF;
\- whether a particular USS may be sent to a NAF;
NOTE 3: Privacy issues need be considered when determining which user
identifier is sent to the NAF. If service continuity is desired, then the BSF
can be configured to send the IMPI. If HLR is utilized instead of HSS, BSF can
be configured to send MSISDN over Zn (but then there is no user anonymity). If
the BSF does not send the IMPI, MSISDN or IMPU / pseudonym in the USS, then
the user remains anonymous towards the NAF; or more precisely, the B-TID
functions as a temporary user identifier. This can cause that the NAF cannot
provide a continuous service, since a user identity is needed in the NAF to
ensure that the NAF is able to update keys for a Ua session when the UE has
bootstrapped and contacts the NAF with a new B-TID. If user privacy is
desired, the NAF can requests a USS and the BSF is configured to send a user
pseudonym in the USS, but not the IMPI.
\- If a NAF requests USSs from the BSF and they are not present in
subscriber\'s GUSS, it shall not cause an error, provided the conditions of
the local policy of the BSF are fulfilled. The BSF shall then send only the
requested and found USSs to the NAF;
\- It shall be possible to configure a local policy as follows: BSF may
require one or more application-specific USS to be present in a particular
subscriber's GUSS for a particular requesting NAF, and to reject the request
from the NAF in case the conditions are not fulfilled. In order to satisfy
this local policy, it is not required that the NAF requests the USSs over the
Zn reference point, which the BSF requires to be present in the GUSS, rather
it is sufficient that the BSF checks the presence of the USSs locally. It
shall also be possible to configure the BSF in such a way that no USS is
required for the requesting NAF;
NOTE 4: For more information on the local policy usage, see Annex J.
\- The BSF shall be able to indicate to the NAF the bootstrapping time and the
lifetime of the key material. The key lifetime sent by the BSF over Zn shall
indicate the expiry time of the key, and shall be identical to the key
lifetime sent by the BSF to the UE over Ub.
NOTE 5: This does not preclude a NAF to refresh the key before the expiry time
according to the NAF\'s local policy.
NOTE 6: If one or more of the USSs that have been delivered to the NAF has
been updated in subscriber\'s GUSS in the HSS, this change is propagated to
the NAF the next time it fetches the USS from the BSF over Zn reference point
(provided that the BSF has updated subscriber\'s GUSS from the HSS over Zh
reference point).
\- The BSF shall remove any existing attribute indicating NAF Grouping from
the USSs sent to NAFs.
\- NAF shall be able to indicate to BSF the protocol identifier of Ua security
protocol it requires the key material by sending NAF-Id to BSF (cf. Annex H).
### 4.4.7 Requirements on Bootstrapping Transaction Identifier
Bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID) shall be used to bind the
subscriber identity to the keying material in reference points Ua, Ub and Zn.
Requirements for B-TID are:
\- B-TID shall be globally unique;
\- B-TID shall be usable as a key identifier in protocols used in the
reference point Ua;
\- NAF shall be able to detect the home network and the BSF of the UE from the
B-TID.
NOTE 1: NAF can remove the security association based on deletion conditions
after the key has become invalid.
NOTE 2: Care has to be taken that the parallel use of GBA and non-GBA
authentication between UE and NAF does not lead to conflicts, e.g. in the name
space. This potential conflict cannot be resolved in a generic way as it is
dependent on specific protocol and authentication mechanism used between UE
and application server. It is therefore out of scope of this specification.\
For the example of HTTP Digest authentication used between UE and NAF,
parallel use is possible as the following applies: \-pairs
must be unique to one realm only. As the NAF controls the realm names, it has
to ensure that only the GBA based realm is named with the reserved 3GPP realm
name. In the special case that the NAF wants to allow non GBA based
authentication in the GBA realm also, it has to ensure that no usernames in
the format of a B-TID are used outside GBA based authentication.
### 4.4.8 Requirements on selection of UICC application and related keys
When several applications are present on the UICC, which are capable of
running AKA, then the ME shall choose one of these UICC applications for
performing the GBA procedures specified in this document in the following
order of preference:
1\. The UE determines which UICC application is to be involved:
a. the application on the ME that needs Ks_NAF (Ua application) may indicate
to the GBA support function (GBA function) the type or the name of the UICC
application: no preference, USIM, ISIM, or the \"Label\" (see definition in TS
31.101 [15]) of the UICC application.
NOTE 1: A Ua application specification may require the use of only a USIM
(e.g. in MBMS) or only an ISIM.
NOTE 2: A user or operator may want to use a Ua application with a specific
UICC application indicated by the "Label". This could be configured in the Ua
application in the ME by the user or the operator.
A Ua application may require to use the same UICC application in the first and
all consecutive runs of Ub protocol for a Ua application instance to ensure
that IMPI is not changed during a Ua application session which lasts over
several runs of Ub protocol. In this case the Ua application shall request the
GBA function to run the Ub protocol with the UICC application that is
indicated by the corresponding \"Label\" or IMPI, depending on which one is
available. If both are available, then IMPI shall be used to indicate which
UICC application is to be used by the GBA function.
If the application on the ME indicated a \"Label\" of the UICC application,
step b below shall be executed.
If the application on the ME indicated that the UICC application type should
be:
\- the USIM; step b below is skipped and in steps c and d only USIM
applications are considered.
\- the ISIM; step b below is skipped and in steps c and d only ISIM
applications are considered.
if the application on the ME did not indicate a preference, step b below is
skipped and the selection process is executed as described below, starting
with step c;
b. if a \"Label\" was indicated in step a:
> At most, there can be only one USIM active at one time. Therefore, if the
> USIM indicated in the \"Label\" by the Ua application is different to the
> currently active USIM application, then the ME shall reject this request.
>
> If a different ISIM to the currently active ISIM application(s) is indicated
> to the GBA support function by the Ua application, then the ME shall not
> terminate the currently active ISIM application(s) but the ME shall follow
> the procedure in chapter 4.4.8.1 when activating the ISIM application
> indicated by the \"Label\", as the UE is allowed to have several ISIM's
> active simultaneously.
c. if no \"Label\" was indicated in step a and there are UICC applications
active:
> If a preferred UICC application type was indicated but no UICC application
> of this type is active then step d shall be followed.
>
> If a preferred UICC application type was indicated and there are active UICC
> applications of this preferred type, then the GBA function shall choose:
>
> \- if the preferred UICC application type is USIM then the active USIM is
> selected
>
> \- if the preferred UICC application type is ISIM and only one ISIM is
> active then this is selected
>
> \- if the preferred UICC application type is ISIM and more than one ISIM is
> active then the GBA function may show a UICC application choosing dialogue
> to the end user (the list contains the \"Labels\" from the application list
> of all active ISIM applications on the UICC), from which the end user
> chooses the UICC application to be selected; if no dialogue is shown the GBA
> function shall select an active ISIM.
>
> If no preference was given and there is more than one active UICC
> application, the GBA function may show a UICC application choosing dialogue
> to the end user (the list contains the \"Labels\" from the application list
> of all active UICC applications), from which the end user chooses the UICC
> application to be selected; if no dialogue is shown the GBA function shall
> select the active USIM application, if an active USIM application exists,
> otherwise any active ISIM application.
>
> If no preference was given and there is only one active UICC application,
> then the GBA function selects this active UICC application;
d. if no \"Label\" was indicated in step a and if there are no UICC
applications active active or if there is no UICC application of the preferred
UICC application type active:
\- if there is only one UICC application on the UICC, the GBA function selects
it, if possible;
\- if there is more than one UICC application on the UICC, the GBA function
may show a UICC application choosing dialogue to the end user (the list
contains the \"Labels\" from the application list of the UICC), from which the
end user chooses the UICC application to be selected. If a preferred UICC
application type was indicated and there are UICC applications of this type on
the UICC, then the list shown contains only UICC applications of this type,
otherwise the list contains all UICC applications on the UICC. If no dialogue
is shown the GBA function shall select the \"last selected\" UICC application
of the preferred type (i.e. either the \"last selected\" USIM or the \"last
selected\" ISIM depending on the given preference), if possible. In case the
Ua application indicated \"no preference\" and both USIM and ISIM are present
on the UICC, then the \"last selected\" USIM is selected.
The procedure in clause 4.4.8.1 shall be followed.
e. if the UICC application type indicated in step a and used in step c and/or
d was ISIM, but there was no ISIM to select, then step c and/or d is repeated
with UICC application type USIM; otherwise the selection process fails.
NOTE 3: Step e is required for the case that an ISIM as defined in TS 33.203
[16] may be realised using a USIM application on the UICC.
2\. If there already is a key Ks derived from the chosen UICC application, the
UE takes this key to derive Ks_NAF.
3\. If there is no such key Ks, the UE first runs the Ub protocol involving
the selected UICC application and then goes to step 2.
If a USIM is chosen, the IMPI obtained from the IMSI stored on the USIM as
specified in TS 23.003 [11] clause 13.3, is used in the protocol run over Ub.
NOTE 4: Strictly speaking, an IMPI, and the derivation of an IMPI from an IMSI
as in TS 23.003 [11], clause 13 are only defined in the context of the IMS.
For the purposes of this specification, however, an identifier obtained from
an IMSI as specified in TS 23.003 [11], clause 13.3 is also called an IMPI,
even if the user has no IMS subscription.
If an ISIM is selected, the IMPI stored on the ISIM is used in the protocol
run over Ub.
Whenever a UICC application is successfully selected or terminated, the rules
in this clause for choosing the UICC application are re-applied and,
consequently, the UICC application chosen for GBA may change.
NOTE 5: At any one time, there is at most one UICC application chosen for
performing the GBA procedures.
#### 4.4.8.1 UICC application activation procedure in GBA
UICC application activation is defined in TS 31.101 [15].
NOTE: As part of the UICC application (USIM or ISIM) activation procedure, the
UICC may require user verification e.g. PIN entry.
If activation of a new UICC application fails then the GBA function shall
indicate this to the Ua application.
### 4.4.9 Requirements on reference point Ua
The generic requirements for reference point Ua are:
\- the UE and the NAF shall be able to secure the reference point Ua using the
GBA-based shared secret;
NOTE: The exact method of securing the reference point Ua depends on the
application protocol used over reference point Ua.
\- in the case of GBA_U, the UE and the NAF shall be able to agree which key
(i.e, Ks_ext_NAF or Ks_int_NAF or both) is used as the GBA-based shared secret
if both keys may be used;
There are two ways to have an agreement between the UE and the NAF which key
shall be used Ks_(ext)_NAF or Ks_int_NAF or both:
a) In a generic case, where the protocol used over reference point Ua can be
used for different applications (e.g., HTTPS), the protocol should be able to
indicate which key should be used.
b) In a specific case, where the protocol is application specific (e.g., MIKEY
in MBMS), the agreement can be based on implicit knowledge.
\- any security protocol over Ua shall be associated with a Ua security
protocol identifier. This identifier shall be specified in Annex H of this
specification.
\- the NAF shall be able to indicate to the UE that GBA-based shared secret
should be used;
\- the NAF shall be able to indicate to the UE that the current shared secret
has expired and the UE should use newer shared secret with the NAF.
\- The default lifetime of the NAF specific key material Ks_(ext/int)_NAF
shall be equal to the lifetime of Ks when not specified within the Ua-
application specification. The lifetime of the Ks_(ext/int)_NAF shall not
exceed the lifetime of corresponding Ks. If a lifetime for the
Ks_(ext/int)_NAF (or further adapted key material) is available in the NAF,
due to a Ua application specification having its own lifetime value or due to
NAF having it's own policy for the adapted key material, then if this lifetime
is different from the Ks lifetime received from the BSF, then the NAF shall
always select the minimum value for the lifetime out of these two.
\- The UE and NAF may adapt the key material Ks_(ext/int)_NAF to the specific
needs of the reference point Ua. This adaptation is outside the scope of this
specification. The default lifetime of the adapted key material shall be equal
to the lifetime of Ks_(ext/int)_NAF when not specified within the Ua-
application specification. The lifetime of the adapted key material shall not
exceed the lifetime of corresponding Ks_(ext/int)_NAF. If a lifetime for the
Ks_(ext/int)_NAF (or further adapted key material) is available in the NAF,
due to a Ua application specification having its own lifetime value or due to
NAF having it's own policy for the adapted key material, then if this lifetime
is different from the Ks lifetime received from the BSF, then the NAF shall
always select the minimum value for the lifetime out of these two.
### 4.4.10 Requirements on reference point Dz
This interface between BSF and SLF is used to retrieve the address of the HSS
which holds the subscription for a given user. This interface is not required
in a single HSS environment.
### 4.4.11 Requirements on GBA keys and parameters handling
When referring to GBA keys, the following keys are intended: Ks and NAF
specific keys derived from the Ks. When referring to NAF specific keys, the
following keys are intended: Ks_ext/int_NAF (in GBA_U context) and Ks_NAF (in
GBA_ME context), and any keys derived from these keys. The notation
Ks_(ext/int)_NAF refers to Ks_ext/int_NAF in GBA_U context and Ks_NAF in
GBA_ME context. The notation Ks_(ext)_NAF refers to Ks_ext_NAF in GBA_U
context, and Ks_NAF in GBA_ME context.
The ME shall delete all GBA keys (i.e., Ks, and NAF specific keys) and the
corresponding NAF_IDs, B-TID, Ks_(int/ext)_NAF lifetimes, Ks lifetime, and
lifetime (of the keys derived from Ks_(ext)_NAF) when at least one of the
conditions below is met:
1 the UICC is removed from the ME when the ME is in power on state;
2 the ME is powered up and the ME discovers that another UICC has been
inserted to the ME. For this, the ME needs to store in non-volatile memory the
last inserted UICC-identity to be able to compare that with the used UICC-
identity at UICC insertion and power up; or
3 the ME is powered up and the ME discovers that no UICC has been inserted to
the ME.
NOTE 1: One possible way, how this requirement can be fulfilled by an
application in an open platform is, if the keys are deleted at shut-down and
at start-up of the application. When the ME operating system detects one of
the conditions above, it can shut down the application to force key deletion.
The deletion at start-up ensures that keys are also deleted, when an irregular
power-down or UICC removal during power down has occurred.
The ME shall delete all GBA keys related to a certain Ks (i.e., Ks itself, and
NAF specific keys derived from this specific Ks) and the corresponding
NAF_IDs, B-TID, Ks_(ext/int)_NAF lifetimes, Ks lifetime, and lifetime (of the
keys derived from Ks_(ext)_NAF) when the key lifetime of this specific Ks
expires.
In the case of GBA_ME, the key Ks shall be deleted from the ME when the ME is
powered down. The NAF specific keys (i.e. Ks_(ext)_NAF and keys derived
therefrom, if any) may be deleted from the ME when the ME is powered down. If
the ME does not delete these NAF specific keys at power down then the NAF
specific keys (i.e. Ks_(ext)_NAF and keys derived therefrom, if any) together
with the NAF_IDs, B-TID, Ks_(ext)_NAF lifetime and lifetimes (of the keys
derived from Ks_(ext)_NAF) shall be stored in non-volatile memory.
If the NAF specific keys are stored in non-volatile memory, then when the ME
is powered up again, the ME may need to ensure that the same UICC application
is selected for the Ua application, in order to allow the re-use of the NAF
specific keys (i.e. Ks_(ext)_NAF and keys derived therefrom, if any), cf.
clause 4.4.8. For this, the ME shall store also the IMPI in non-volatile
memory. If the same UICC application can not be selected for a Ua application
at UE power up, then the ME shall delete the NAF specific keys related to that
IMPI stored in non-volatile memory.
Whenever a UICC application is terminated (see section 4.4.8) the shared key
Ks established from it in the protocol over the Ub reference point (according
to clauses 4.5.2 and 5.3.2) shall be deleted.
NOTE 2: In case the key Ks has been deleted, but the same UICC is still
present (i.e. none of conditions 1, 2 or 3 is met), the Ua applications can
continue using the NAF specific keys (Ks_(ext/int)_NAF) until the Ks lifetime
expires.
### 4.4.12 Requirements on reference point Zh\'
This reference point is optional for the BSF to support. The requirements for
reference point Zh\' are:
\- mutual authentication, confidentiality and integrity shall be provided;
NOTE 1: This requirement may be fulfilled by physical or proprietary security
measures, since BSF and HLR are located within the same operator\'s network.
\- the BSF shall be able to send an authentication vector request concerning a
subscriber;
\- the HLR shall be able to send one authentication vector, as described in TS
29.109 [32] at a time to the BSF;
\- no other GBA functionality than conveying authentication vectors shall be
required on Zh\';
\- no state information concerning bootstrapping shall be required in the HLR;
\- all procedures over reference point Zh\' shall be initiated by the BSF;
\- the number of different interfaces to HLR should be minimized.
NOTE 2: If support of GBA User Security Settings (GUSS) is desired in
combination with HLR or HSS with Zh\' reference point support, then this can
be achieved, for instance by storing the GUSS information in a BSF database
(external and/or external to the node itself), or in any other network
database which is deemed as appropriate for a specific deployment. GUSS
information is not sent over Zh\' reference point.
### 4.4.13 Requirements on TMPI handling
The BSF shall store a TMPI together with the IMPI, from which it was derived
(cf. Annex B.4), until the next bootstrapping procedure is executed using this
TMPI.
The BSF may have a local policy for deleting stored (TMPI, IMPI)-pairs before
the next bootstrapping procedure is executed using this TMPI, e.g. for storage
or performance reasons.
The ME shall store a TMPI together with the IMPI, from which it was derived
(cf. Annex B.4), in non-volatile memory.
The ME shall delete all stored (TMPI, IMPI)-pairs when at least one of the
conditions below is met:
1\. the UICC is removed from the ME when the ME is in power on state; or
2\. the ME is powered up and the ME discovers that another UICC has been
inserted to the ME. For this, the ME needs to store in non-volatile memory the
last inserted UICC-identity to be able to compare that with the used UICC-
identity at UICC insertion and power up; or
3\. the ME is powered up and the ME discovers that no UICC has been inserted
to the ME.
## 4.5 Procedures
This chapter specifies in detail the format of the bootstrapping procedure
that is further utilized by various applications. It contains the AKA
authentication procedure with BSF, and the key material generation procedure.
### 4.5.1 Initiation of bootstrapping
Before communication between the UE and the NAF can start, the UE and the NAF
first have to agree whether to use the GBA. When a UE wants to interact with a
NAF, but it does not know if the NAF requires the use of shared keys obtained
by means of the GBA, the UE shall contact the NAF for further instructions
(see figure 4.2).
{width="3.2597222222222224in" height="1.8916666666666666in"}
Figure 4.2: Initiation of bootstrapping
1\. UE starts communication over reference point Ua with the NAF without any
GBA-related parameters.
2\. If the NAF requires the use of shared keys obtained by means of the GBA,
but the request from UE does not include GBA-related parameters, the NAF
replies with a bootstrapping initiation message. The form of this indication
may depend on the particular reference point Ua and is specified in the
relevant stage 3-specifications.
### 4.5.2 Bootstrapping procedures
When a UE wants to interact with a NAF, and it knows that the bootstrapping
procedure is needed, it shall first perform a bootstrapping authentication
(see figure 4.3). Otherwise, the UE shall perform a bootstrapping
authentication only when it has received bootstrapping initiation required
message or a bootstrapping negotiation indication from the NAF, or when the
lifetime of the key in UE has expired (cf. subclause 4.5.3).
NOTE 1: The main steps from the specifications of the AKA protocol in TS
33.102 [2] and the HTTP digest AKA protocol in RFC 3310 [4] are repeated in
figure 3 for the convenience of the reader. In case of any potential conflict,
the specifications in TS 33.102 [2] and RFC 3310 [4] take precedence.
Figure 4.3: The bootstrapping procedure
A UE shall always include the product token \"3gpp-gba-tmpi\" in the user
agent request-header field when communicating over Ub. A BSF shall always
include the product token \"3gpp-gba-tmpi\" in the server response-header
field when communicating over Ub.
NOTE 1a: According to the HTTP specification RFC 2616 [33], the product tokens
may contain any text. They are ignored when unknown by a UE or a BSF.
1\. The UE sends an HTTP request towards the BSF. When a TMPI associated with
the IMPI in use is available on the UE, the UE includes this TMPI in the
\"username\" parameter, otherwise the UE includes the IMPI.
2\. The BSF recognises from the structure of the \"username\" parameter (cf.
Annex B.4) whether a TMPI or an IMPI was sent. If a TMPI was sent the BSF
looks up the corresponding IMPI in its local database. If the BSF does not
find an IMPI corresponding to the received TMPI it returns an appropriate
error message to the UE. The UE then deletes the TMPI and retries the request
using the IMPI.
The BSF retrieves the complete set of GBA user security settings and one
Authentication Vector (AV, AV = RAND\|\|AUTN\|\|XRES\|\|CK\|\|IK) over the
reference point Zh from the HSS.
In the case that no HSS with Zh reference point is deployed, the BSF retrieves
the Authentication Vector over the reference point Zh\' from either an HLR or
an HSS with Zh\' reference point support.
If the BSF implements the timestamp option and has a local copy of the GUSS
for the subscriber that has been fetched from the HSS during a previous
bootstrapping procedure, and this GUSS includes a timestamp, the BSF may
include the GUSS timestamp in the request message. Upon receiving that
timestamp, if the HSS implements the timestamp option, the HSS may compare it
with the timestamp of the GUSS stored in the HSS. In this case, if and only if
the HSS has done the comparison and the timestamps are equal, then the HSS
shall send \"GUSS TIMESTAMP EQUAL\" indication to the BSF. In any other case,
the HSS shall send the GUSS (if available) to the BSF. If the BSF receives
\"GUSS TIMESTAMP EQUAL\" indication, it shall keep the local copy of the GUSS.
In any other case, the BSF shall delete the local copy of the GUSS, and store
the received GUSS (if sent).
NOTE 2: In a multiple HSS environment, the BSF may have to obtain the address
of the HSS where the subscription of the user is stored by querying the SLF,
prior to step 2.
3\. Then BSF forwards the RAND and AUTN to the UE in the 401 message (without
the CK, IK and XRES). This is to demand the UE to authenticate itself.
4\. The UE checks AUTN to verify that the challenge is from an authorised
network; the UE also calculates CK, IK and RES. This will result in session
keys IK and CK in both BSF and UE.
5\. The UE sends another HTTP request, containing the Digest AKA response
(calculated using RES), to the BSF.
6\. The BSF authenticates the UE by verifying the Digest AKA response.
NOTE 3: The password in \"AKAv1\" HTTP Digest AKA is in binary format.
7\. The BSF generates key material Ks by concatenating CK and IK. The B-TID
value shall be also generated in format of NAI by taking the base64 encoded
[12] RAND value from step 3, and the BSF server name, i.e.
base64encode(RAND)\@BSF_servers_domain_name.
NOTE 3a: If the HSS/AuC uses a good random number generator, then the chance
of a B-TID collision is practically zero. If such a collision occurs, then the
key retrieved by the NAF can have a mismatch with the UE generated NAF key.
This will result in a Ua authentication failure which will cause the NAF to
once again request the UE to bootstrap which will create a new Ks and a new
B-TID.
If the request included the product token \"3gpp-gba-tmpi\" in the user agent
request-header field the BSF shall compute a new TMPI as specified in Annex
B.4 and store it together with the IMPI, overwriting a previous TMPI related
to this IMPI, if any.
8\. The BSF shall send a 200 OK message, including a B-TID, to the UE to
indicate the success of the authentication. In addition, in the 200 OK
message, the BSF shall supply the lifetime of the key Ks. The key material Ks
is generated in UE by concatenating CK and IK.
9\. Both the UE and the BSF shall use the Ks to derive the key material Ks_NAF
during the procedures as specified in clause 4.5.3. Ks_NAF shall be used for
securing the reference point Ua.
Ks_NAF is computed as Ks_NAF = KDF (Ks, \"gba-me\", RAND, IMPI, NAF_Id), where
KDF is the key derivation function as specified in Annex B, and the key
derivation parameters consist of the user\'s IMPI, the NAF_Id and RAND. The
NAF_Id is constructed as follows: NAF_Id = FQDN of the NAF \|\| Ua security
protocol identifier. The Ua security protocol identifier is specified in Annex
H. KDF shall be implemented in the ME.
NOTE 4: If a NAF hosts two or more applications which use the same FQDN and Ua
security protocol identifier, they will share the same NAF specific keys. This
causes a risk of so called two-time pad which may lead to the situation that
the security of these applications is compromised. This can be avoided by
running bootstrapping separately to each application or by application
specific means, which are however out of the scope of the current
specification.
> To allow consistent key derivation based on NAF name in UE and BSF, at least
> one of the three following prerequisites shall be fulfilled:
(1) The NAF is known in DNS under one domain name (FQDN) only, i.e. no two
different domain names point to the IP address of the NAF. This has to be
achieved by administrative means.\ This prerequisite is not specific to 3GPP,
as it is necessary also under other circumstances, e.g. for TLS V1.0 without
use of wildcard or multiple-name certificates.
(2) Each DNS entry of the NAF points to a different IP address. The NAF
responds to all these IP addresses. Each IP address is tied to the
corresponding FQDN by NAF configuration. The NAF can see from the IP address,
which FQDN to use for key derivation.
(3) Ua uses a protocol which transfers the host name (FQDN of NAF as used by
UE) to NAF (e.g. HTTP/1.1 with mandatory Host request header field). This
requires the NAF to check the validity of the host name, to use this name in
all communication with UE where appropriate, and to transfer this name to BSF
to allow for correct derivation of Ks_NAF.\ In case of a TLS tunnel this
requires either multiple-identities certificates or the deployment of RFC 4366
[42] or other protocol means with similar purpose.
The UE and the BSF shall store the key Ks with the associated B-TID for
further use, until the lifetime of Ks has expired, or until the key Ks is
updated or until the deletion conditions are satisfied (see 4.4.11).
NOTE 5: The following case can occur. The UE contacts the NAF1 and generates
keys for NAF1. Then the UE contacts NAF2 and generates NAF2 keys. Then NAF1
requests then keys from the BSF, but the old key keys could have been
overwritten due to NAF2 having initiated a new GBA run. The UE initiates a new
GBA-run (B-TID2) after handling NAF1 (B-TID1) and starting the request to the
NAF1 over Ua. One possible reason is that B-TID1 lifetime was about to expire.
It is very likely that the GBA-run takes much more time (HSS involvement) then
the Zn/Ua request such that the B-TID1 request at the BSF should arrive in
most cases earlier at the BSF. So this out-of-order case should be very rare.
This error situation will be signalled back to the UE, such that the most
recent B-TID2 will also be used for NAF1. This out-of order case is self-
correcting, since if the B-TID1 is unknown in the BSF, then the Ua request
will fail and the UE can send a new request using B-TID2.
If the response included the product token \"3gpp-gba-tmpi\" in the server
response-header field the UE shall compute the TMPI as specified in Annex B.4
and store it together with the IMPI, overwriting a previous TMPI related to
this IMPI, if any.
### 4.5.3 Procedures using bootstrapped Security Association
Before communication between the UE and the NAF can start, the UE and the NAF
first have to agree whether to use shared keys obtained by means of the GBA.
If the UE does not know whether to use GBA with this NAF, it uses the
Initiation of Bootstrapping procedure described in clause 4.5.1.
Once the UE and the NAF have established that they want to use GBA then every
time the UE wants to interact with an NAF the following steps are executed as
depicted in figure 4.4.
1\. UE starts communication over reference point Ua with the NAF:
\- in general, UE and NAF will not yet share the key(s) required to protect
the reference point Ua. If they already do (i.e. if a key Ks_NAF for the
corresponding key derivation parameter NAF_Id is already available), the UE
and the NAF can start to securely communicate right away. If the UE and the
NAF do not yet share a key, the UE proceeds as follows:
\- if a key Ks for the selected UICC application is available in the UE, the
UE derives the key Ks_NAF from Ks, as specified in clause 4.5.2;
\- if no key Ks for the selected UICC application is available in the UE, the
UE first agrees on a new key Ks with the BSF over the reference point Ub, and
then proceeds to derive Ks_NAF
If it is not desired by the UE to use the same Ks for the selected UICC
application to derive more than one Ks_NAF then the UE should agree on a new
key Ks with the BSF over the reference point Ub, and then proceed to derive
Ks_NAF.
\- if the NAF shares a key with the UE, but the NAF requires an update of that
key, e.g. because the key's lifetime has expired or will expire soon, or the
key can not meet the NAF local validity condition, it shall send a suitable
bootstrapping renegotiation request to the UE, see figure 4.5. If the key\'s
lifetime has expired the protocol used over reference point Ua shall be
terminated. The form of this indication depends on the particular protocol
used over reference point Ua. If the UE receives a bootstrapping renegotiation
request, it starts a run of the protocol over reference point Ub, as specified
in clause 4.5.2, in order to obtain a new key Ks.
To allow for consistent key derivation in BSF and UE, both have to use the
same FQDN for derivation (see clause 4.5.2). For each protocol used over Ua it
shall be specified if only cases (1) and (2) of clause 4.5.2 are allowed for
the NAF or if the protocol used over Ua shall transfer also the FQDN used for
key derivation by UE to NAF.
NOTE 1: If the shared key between UE and NAF is invalid, the NAF can set
deletion conditions to the corresponding security association for subsequent
removal.
\- the UE supplies the B-TID to the NAF, in the form as specified in clause
4.5.2, to allow the NAF to retrieve the corresponding keys from the BSF;
NOTE 2: The UE may adapt the key material Ks_NAF to the specific needs of the
reference point Ua. This adaptation is outside the scope of this
specification.
\- the key management procedures for GBA related keys in the ME (i.e. Ks and
Ks_NAF keys) are described in section 4.4.11.
\- when a new Ks is agreed over the reference point Ub and a key Ks_NAF,
derived from one NAF_Id, is updated, the other keys Ks_NAF, derived from
different values NAF_Id, stored on the UE shall not be affected;
According to the procedures defined in clauses 4.5.2 and 4.5.3, in the UE
there is at most one Ks_NAF key stored per NAF-Id.
2\. NAF starts communication over reference point Zn with BSF
\- The NAF requests key material corresponding to the B-TID supplied by the UE
to the NAF over reference point Ua.;
\- The NAF may also request one or more application-specific USSs for the
applications, which the request received over Ua from UE may access;
NOTE 3: If the NAF requires service continuity, then the NAF can request a USS
that contains a user pseudonym that allows service continuity according to BSF
policy.
\- With the key material request, the NAF shall supply a NAF-Id (which
includes the NAF's FQDN that the UE has used to access this NAF and the Ua
security protocol identifier) to the BSF. (This is to allow for consistent key
derivation in the BSF and UE as described above). The BSF shall be able verify
that NAF is authorized to use that FQDN.
3\. The BSF derives the keys required to protect the protocol used over
reference point Ua from the key Ks and the key derivation parameters, as
specified in clause 4.5.2, and supplies to NAF the requested key Ks_NAF, as
well as the bootstrapping time and the lifetime of that key, and the requested
application-specific and potentially NAF group specific USSs if they are
available in subscriber\'s GUSS and if the NAF is authorized to receive the
requested USSs. For any USSs containing a NAF Group attribute, this attribute
shall be removed in the USSs supplied to the NAF. If the key identified by the
B-TID supplied by the NAF is not available at the BSF, the BSF shall indicate
this in the reply to the NAF. The NAF then indicates a bootstrapping
renegotiation request to the UE.
NOTE 4: The NAF can further set the local validity condition of the Ks_NAF
according to the local policy, for example a limitation of reuse times of a
Ks_NAF.
NOTE 5: The NAF will adapt the key material Ks_NAF to the specific needs of
the reference point Ua in the same way as the UE did. This adaptation is
outside the scope of this specification.
\- The BSF may require that one or more application-specific and potentially
NAF group specific USSs shall be present in subscriber\'s GUSS for the NAF
(see clause 4.4.6). If one or more of these required settings are missing from
the GUSS, the BSF shall indicate this in the reply to the NAF.
\- The BSF may also send the private user identity (IMPI) and requested USSs
to NAF according to the BSF\'s policy;
4\. NAF continues with the protocol used over the reference point Ua with the
UE.
Once the run of the protocol used over reference point Ua is completed the
purpose of bootstrapping is fulfilled as it enabled UE and NAF to use
reference point Ua in a secure way.

Figure 4.5: Bootstrapping renegotiation request
### 4.5.4 Procedure related to service discovery
The UE shall discover the address of the BSF the from the identity information
related to the UICC application that is used during bootstrapping procedure,
i.e., IMSI for USIM, or IMPI for ISIM. The address of the BSF is derived as
specified in TS 23.003 [11].
# 5 UICC-based enhancements to Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA_U)
It is assumed that the UICC, BSF, and HSS involved in the procedures specified
in this clause are capable of handling the GBA_U specific enhancements. The
procedures specified in this clause also apply if NAF is not GBA_U aware.
## 5.1 Architecture and reference points for bootstrapping with UICC-based
enhancements
The text from clause 4.4 of this specification applies also here, with the
addition that the interface between the ME and the UICC, as specified in TS
31.102 [1] and TS 31.103 [10], needs to be enhanced with GBA_U specific
commands. The requirements on these commands can be found in clause 5.2.1,
details on the procedures are in clause 5.3.
## 5.2 Requirements and principles for bootstrapping with UICC-based
enhancements
The requirements and principles from clause 4.4 also apply here with the
following addition:
### 5.2.1 Requirements on UE
The 3G AKA keys CK and IK resulting from a run of the protocol over the Ub
reference point shall not leave the UICC.
The UICC shall be able to distinguish between authentication requests for
GBA_U, and authentication requests for other 3G authentication domains.
Upon an authentication request from the ME, which the UICC recognises as
related to GBA_U, the UICC shall derive the bootstrapping key.
Upon request from the ME, the UICC shall be able to derive further NAF-
specific keys from the derived key stored on the UICC.
All GBA-aware MEs shall support procedures for the two previous requests.
### 5.2.2 Requirements on BSF
BSF shall support both GBA_U and GBA_ME bootstrapping procedures. The decision
on running one or the other shall be based on subscription information (i.e.
UICC capabilities).
The BSF shall be able to acquire the UICC capabilities related to GBA as part
of the GBA user security settings received from the HSS.
## 5.3 Procedures for bootstrapping with UICC-based enhancements
### 5.3.1 Initiation of bootstrapping
The text from clause 4.5.1 of this document applies also here.
### 5.3.2 Bootstrapping procedure
The procedure specified in this clause differs from the procedure specified
clause 4.5.2 in the local handling of keys and Authentication Vectors in the
UE and the BSF. The messages exchanged over the Ub reference point are
identical for both procedures.
When a UE wants to interact with a NAF, and it knows that the bootstrapping
procedure is needed, it shall first perform a bootstrapping authentication
(see figure 5.1). Otherwise, the UE shall perform a bootstrapping
authentication only when it has received bootstrapping initiation required
message or a bootstrapping renegotiation indication from the NAF, or when the
lifetime of the key in UE has expired (see clause 5.3.3).
NOTE: The main steps from the specifications of the AKA protocol in TS 33.102
[2] and the HTTP digest AKA protocol in RFC 3310 [4] are repeated in figure
5.1 for the convenience of the reader. In case of any potential conflict, the
specifications in TS 33.102 [2] and RFC 3310 [4] take precedence.
Figure 5.1: The bootstrapping procedure with UICC-based enhancements
A UE shall always include the product token \"3gpp-gba-tmpi\" in the user
agent request-header field when communicating over Ub. A BSF shall always
include the product token \"3gpp-gba-tmpi\" in the server response-header
field when communicating over Ub.
NOTE a: According to the HTTP specification RFC 2616 [33], the product tokens
may contain any text. They are ignored when unknown by a UE or a BSF.
1\. The ME sends an HTTP request towards the BSF. When a TMPI associated with
the IMPI in use is available on the UE, the UE includes this TMPI in the
\"username\" parameter, otherwise the UE includes the IMPI.
2\. The BSF recognises from the structure of the \"username\" parameter (cf.
Annex B.4) whether a TMPI or an IMPI was sent. If a TMPI was sent the BSF
looks up the corresponding IMPI in its local database. If the BSF does not
find an IMPI corresponding to the received TMPI it returns an appropriate
error message to the UE. The UE then deletes the TMPI and retries the request
using the IMPI.
The BSF retrieves the complete set of GBA user security settings and one
Authentication Vector\ (AV, AV = RAND\|\|AUTN\|\|XRES\|\|CK\|\|IK) over the Zh
reference point from the HSS.
If the BSF implements the timestamp option and has a local copy of the GUSS
for the subscriber that has been fetched from the HSS during a previous
bootstrapping procedure, and this GUSS includes a timestamp, the BSF may
include the GUSS timestamp in the request message. Upon receiving that
timestamp, if the HSS implements the timestamp option, the HSS may compare it
with the timestamp of the GUSS stored in the HSS. In this case, if and only if
the HSS has done the comparison and the timestamps are equal, then the HSS
shall send \"GUSS TIMESTAMP EQUAL\" indication to the BSF. In any other case,
the HSS shall send the GUSS (if available) to the BSF. If the BSF receives
\"GUSS TIMESTAMP EQUAL\" indication, it shall keep the local copy of the GUSS.
In any other case, the BSF shall delete the local copy of the GUSS, and store
the received GUSS (if sent).
The BSF can then decide to perform GBA_U, based on the user security settings
(USSs). In this case, the BSF proceeds in the following way:
\- BSF computes MAC* = MACâŠ• Trunc(SHA-1(IK))
NOTE 1: Trunc denotes that from the 160 bit output of SHAâ€‘1 [23], the 64 bits
numbered as [0] to [63] are used within the * operation to MAC.
The BSF stores the XRES after flipping the least significant bit.
NOTE 2: In a multiple HSS environment, the BSF may have to obtain the address
of the HSS where the subscription of the user is stored by querying the SLF,
prior to step 2.
3\. Then BSF forwards the RAND and AUTN* (where AUTN* = SQN âŠ• AK \|\| AMF \|\|
MAC*) to the UE in the 401 message (without the CK, IK and XRES). This is to
demand the UE to authenticate itself.
4\. The ME sends RAND and AUTN* to the UICC. The UICC calculates IK and MAC
(by performing MAC= MAC* âŠ• Trunc(SHA-1(IK))). Then the UICC checks AUTN(i.e.
SQN âŠ• AK \|\| AMF \|\| MAC) to verify that the challenge is from an authorised
network; the UICC also calculates CK and RES. This will result in session keys
CK and IK in both BSF and UICC. The UICC then transfers RES (after flipping
the least significant bit) to the ME and stores Ks, which is the concatenation
of CK and IK, on the UICC.
5\. The ME sends another HTTP request, containing the Digest AKA response
(calculated using RES), to the BSF.
6\. The BSF authenticates the UE by verifying the Digest AKA response.
NOTE 3: The password in \"AKAv1\" HTTP Digest AKA is in binary format.
7\. The BSF generates the key Ks by concatenating CK and IK. The B-TID value
shall be also generated in format of NAI by taking the base64 encoded [12]
RAND value from step 3, and the BSF server name, i.e.
base64encode(RAND)\@BSF_servers_domain_name.
NOTE 3a: If the HSS/AuC uses a good random number generator, then the chance
of a B-TID collision is practically zero. If such a collision occurs, then the
key retrieved by the NAF can have a mismatch with the UE generated NAF key.
This will result in a Ua authentication failure which will cause the NAF to
once again request the UE to bootstrap which will create a new Ks and a new
B-TID.
If the request included the product token \"3gpp-gba-tmpi\" in the user agent
request-header field the BSF shall compute a new TMPI as specified in Annex
B.4 and store it together with the IMPI, overwriting a previous TMPI related
to this IMPI, if any.
8\. The BSF shall send a 200 OK message, including the B-TID, to the UE to
indicate the success of the authentication. In addition, in the 200 OK
message, the BSF shall supply the lifetime of the key Ks.
9\. Both the UICC and the BSF shall use the Ks to derive NAF-specific keys
Ks_ext_NAF and Ks_int_NAF during the procedures as specified in clause 5.3.3,
if applicable. Ks_ext_NAF and Ks_int_NAF are used for securing the Ua
reference point.
Ks_ext_NAF is computed in the UICC as Ks_ext_NAF = KDF(Ks, \"gba-me\", RAND,
IMPI, NAF_Id), and Ks_int_NAF is computed in the UICC as Ks_int_NAF = KDF(Ks,
\"gba-u, RAND, IMPI, NAF_Id), where KDF is the key derivation function as
specified in Annex B, and the key derivation parameters include the user\'s
IMPI, the NAF_Id and RAND. The NAF_Id is constructed as follows: NAF_Id = FQDN
of the NAF \|\| Ua security protocol identifier. The Ua security protocol
identifier is specified in Annex H. The key derivation parameters used for
Ks_ext_NAF derivation must be different from those used for Ks_int_NAF
derivation. This is done by adding a static string \"gba-me\" in Ks_ext_NAF
and \"gba-u\" in Ks_int_NAF as an input parameter to the key derivation
function.
NOTE 4: If a NAF hosts two or more applications which use the same FQDN and Ua
security protocol identifier, they will share the same NAF specific keys. This
causes a risk of so called two-time pad which may lead to the situation that
the security of these applications is compromised. This can be avoided by
running bootstrapping separately to each application or by application
specific means, which are however out of the scope of the current
specification.
> To allow consistent key derivation based on NAF name in UE and BSF, at least
> one of the prerequisites which are specified in clause 4.5.2 shall be met.
The UICC and the BSF store the key Ks with the associated B-TID for further
use, until the lifetime of Ks has expired, or until the key Ks is updated or
until the deletion conditions are satisfied (see 4.4.11).
If the response included the product token \"3gpp-gba-tmpi\" in the server
response-header field the UE shall compute the TMPI as specified in Annex B.4
and store it together with the IMPI, overwriting a previous TMPI related to
this IMPI, if any.
### 5.3.3 Procedures using bootstrapped Security Association
Before communication between the UE and the NAF can start, the UE and the NAF
first have to agree whether to use shared keys obtained by means of the GBA.
If the UE does not know whether to use GBA with this NAF, it uses the
Initiation of Bootstrapping procedure described in clause 5.3.1.
Once the UE and the NAF have established that they want to use GBA then every
time the UE wants to interact with a NAF the following steps are executed as
depicted in figure 5.3.
Next, the UE and the NAF have to agree, which type of keys to use, Ks_ext_NAF
or Ks_int_NAF, or both. The default is the use of Ks_ext_NAF only. This use is
also supported by MEs and NAFs, which are GBA_U unaware. If Ks_int_NAF, or
both Ks_ext_NAF and Ks_int_NAF are to be used, this use has to be agreed
between UE and NAF prior to the execution of the procedure described in the
remainder of this clause 5.3.3. Any such agreement overrules the default use
of the keys. A key selection indication, which key (i.e. Ks_int_NAF or
Ks_ext_NAF) the NAF shall use in the Ua reference point may be present in the
application specific USS as defined in stage 3 specification. If the
indication exists, the NAF shall use the indicated key. If the Ks_int_NAF key
was indicated in the USS, the UE attempts to use Ks_ext_NAF key, the NAF shall
terminate the communication with the UE.
NOTE 1: This agreement may be mandated by the specification, which defines the
Ua reference point between UE and NAF, e.g. TS 33.246 for the use of GBA in
MBMS, or negotiated by the NAF and the UE over the Ua reference point, or
reached by configuration.
1\. UE starts communication over reference point Ua with the NAF using the
keys Ks_ext_NAF or Ks_int_NAF, or both, as required:
\- in general, UE and NAF will not yet share the key(s) required to protect
the Ua reference point. If they do not, the UE proceeds as follows:
\- if Ks_ext_NAF is required and a key Ks for the selected UICC application is
available in the UICC, the ME requests the UICC to derive the key Ks_ext_NAF
from Ks, as specified in clause 5.3.2;
\- if Ks_int_NAF is required and a key Ks for the selected UICC application is
available in the UICC, the ME requests the UICC to derive the key Ks_int_NAF
from Ks, as specified in clause 5.3.2;
If it is not desired by the UE to use the same Ks for the selected UICC
application to derive more than one Ks_ext/int_NAF, then the UE should first
agree on new key Ks with the BSF over the Ub reference point, as specified in
clause 5.3.2, and then proceeds to derive Ks_ext_NAF or Ks_int_NAF, or both,
as required.
\- if Ks for the selected UICC application is not available in the UE, the UE
first agrees on a new key Ks with the BSF over the Ub reference point, as
specified in clause 5.3.2, and then proceeds to derive Ks_ext_NAF or
Ks_int_NAF, or both, as required;
\- if the NAF shares a key with the UE, but the NAF requires an update of that
key, it shall send a suitable bootstrapping renegotiation request to the UE.
If the key\'s lifetime has expired the protocol used over reference point Ua
shall be terminated. The form of this indication depends on the particular
protocol used over Ua reference point. If the UE receives a bootstrapping
renegotiation request, it starts a run of the protocol over Ub, as specified
in clause 5.3.2, in order to obtain new keys.
NOTE 2: If the shared keys between UE and NAF become invalid, the NAF can set
deletion conditions to the corresponding security association for subsequent
removal.
NOTE 3: If it is not desired by the NAF to use the same Ks to derive more than
one Ks_int/ext_NAF then the NAF can reply to the first request sent by a UE by
sending a key update request to the UE.
\- The UE supplies the B-TID to the NAF, as specified in clause 5.3.2, to
allow the NAF to retrieve the corresponding keys from the BSF
To allow for consistent key derivation in BSF and UE, both have to use the
same FQDN for derivation (cf. clause 4.5.2). For each protocol used over Ua it
shall be specified if only cases (1) and (2) of clause 4.5.2 are allowed for
the NAF or if the protocol used over Ua shall transfer also the FQDN used for
key derivation by UE to NAF.
NOTE 4 The UE may adapt the keys Ks_ext_NAF or Ks_int_NAF to the specific
needs of the Ua reference point. This adaptation is outside the scope of this
specification.
\- the key management procedures for GBA related keys in the ME (i.e.
Ks_ext_NAF keys) are described in section 4.4.11.
\- all GBA related keys in the UICC do not need to be deleted when the ME is
powered down.
NOTE 5: After each run of the protocol over the Ub reference point, a new key
Ks, associated with a new B-TID, are derived in the UE according to clause
5.3.2, so that it can never happen, that key Ks with different B-TIDs
simultaneously exist in the UE.
\- When new key Ks is agreed over the Ub reference point and new NAF-specific
keys need to be derived for one NAF_Id, then both, Ks_ext_NAF and Ks_int_NAF
(if present), shall be updated for this NAF_Id, but other keys Ks_ext_NAF or
Ks_int_NAF relating to other NAF_Ids, which may be stored on the UE, shall not
be affected.
According to the procedures defined in clauses 5.3.2 and 5.3.3, in the UE
there is at most one Ks_int_NAF/Ks_ext_NAF key pair stored per NAF_Id.
NOTE 6: This rule ensures that the keys Ks_ext_NAF and Ks_int_NAF are always
in synch at the UE and the NAF.
2\. NAF now starts communication over the Zn reference point with the BSF.
\- The NAF requests from the BSF the keys corresponding to the B-TID, which
was supplied by the UE to the NAF over the Ua reference point. If the NAF is
GBA_U aware it indicates this by including a corresponding flag in the
request;
\- The NAF may also request one or more application-specific USSs for the
applications, which the request received over Ua from UE may access;
NOTE 7: If the NAF requires service continuity, then the NAF can request a USS
that contains a user pseudonym that allows service continuity according to BSF
policy.
\- With the keys request over the Zn reference point, the NAF shall supply a
NAF-Id (which includes NAF's FQDN that the UE has used to access this NAF and
the Ua security protocol identifier) to the BSF. (This is to allow for
consistent key derivation in the BSF and UE as described above). The BSF shall
be able to verify that NAF is authorized to use that FQDN.
3\. The BSF derives the keys Ks_ext_NAF, and Ks_int_NAF (if additionally
required), as specified in clause 5.3.2. If the NAF indicated in its request
that it is GBA_U aware, the BSF supplies to NAF both keys, Ks_ext_NAF, and
Ks_int_NAF, otherwise the BSF supplies only Ks_ext_NAF. In addition, the BSF
supplies the bootstrapping time and the lifetime time of these keys, and the
requested application-specific and potentially NAF group specific USSs if they
are available in subscriber\'s GUSS and if the NAF is authorized to receive
the requested USSs. For any USSs containing a NAF Group attribute, this
attribute shall be removed in the USSs supplied to the NAF.If the key
identified by the B-TID supplied by the NAF is not available at the BSF, the
BSF shall indicate this in the reply to the NAF. The NAF then indicates a
bootstrapping renegotiation request (See figure 4.5) to the UE;
NOTE 8: The NAF can further set the local validity condition of the Ks_NAF
according to the local policy, for example a limitation of reuse times of a
Ks_NAF.
NOTE 9: The NAF will adapt the keys Ks_ext_NAF and Ks_int_NAF to the specific
needs of the Ua reference point in the same way as the UE did. This adaptation
is outside the scope of this specification.
\- The BSF may require that one or more application-specific and potentially
NAF group specific USSs shall be present in subscriber\'s GUSS for the NAF
(see clause 4.4.6). If one or more of these required settings are missing from
the GUSS, the BSF shall indicate this in the reply to the NAF.
\- The BSF may also send the private user identity (IMPI) and requested USSs
to NAF according to the BSF's policy.
4\. The NAF now continues with the protocol used over the Ua reference point
with the UE.
\- If the NAF requested an application-specific USS from the BSF and the USS
was returned the NAF, the NAF shall check whether this USS contains an key
selection indication. If the key selection indication is present, the NAF
shall use only the indicated key. If a different key was used over Ua, then
the protocol used over reference point Ua shall be terminated.
Once the run of the protocol used over Ua reference point is completed the
purpose of bootstrapping is fulfilled as it enabled the UE and NAF to use Ua
reference point in a secure way.

### 5.3.4 Procedure related to service discovery
The text from clause 4.5.4 of this document applies also here.
###### ### Annex A: (Void)
###### ## Annex B (normative): Specification of the key derivation function
KDF
# B.1 Introduction
This annex specifies the key derivation function (KDF) that is used in the NAF
specific key derivation in both GBA (i.e. GBA_ME) and GBA_U. This KDF is also
used to derive the TMPI. The key derivation function defined in the annex
takes the following assumptions:
1\. the input parameters to the key derivation functions are octet strings -
not bit strings of arbitrary length:
2\. a single input parameter will have lengths no greater than 65535 octets.
# B.2 Generic key derivation function
The input parameters and their lengths shall be concatenated into a string S
as follows:
1\. The length of each input parameter measured in octets shall be encoded
into a two octet-long string:
a) express the number of octets in input parameter Pi as a number k in the
range [0, 65535].
b) Li is then a 16-bit long encoding of the number k, encoded as described in
clause B.2.1.
2\. String S shall be constructed from n+1 input parameters as follows:
S = FC \|\| P0 \|\| L0 \|\| P1 \|\| L1 \|\| P2 \|\| L2 \|\| P3 \|\| L3 \|\|...
\|\| Pn \|\| Ln
where
FC is single octet used to distinguish between different instances of the
algorithm,
P0 ... Pn are the n+1 input parameter encodings, and
L0 ... Ln are the two-octet representations of the length of the corresponding
input parameter encodings P0.. Pn.
In this specification the following restriction applies to P0: P0 is a static
ASCII-encoded string.
This restriction is not part of the KDF definition and does not apply to the
KDF when used by other 3GPP specifications unless explicitly stated so in
those specifications.
3\. The final output, i.e. the derived key is equal to the KDF computed on the
string S using the key, denoted Key. The present document defines the
following KDF:
> derived key = HMAC-SHA-256 ( Key , S )
>
> as specified in [22] and [23].
## B.2.1 Input parameter encoding
### B.2.1.1 General
This clause specifies how encodings of different data types is to be done.
Encoding rules for further data types may be added in future releases if
needed.
### B.2.1.2 Character string encoding
A character string shall be encoded to an octet string according to UTF-8
encoding rules as specified in IETF RFC 3629 [24] and apply Normalization Form
KC (NFKC) as specified in [37].
B.2.1.3 Non-negative integer encodingA non-negative integer value j, which is
input to the KDF, shall be encoded into the octet string Pi as follows:
  1. Encode j in base 2.
  2. Let n be number of bits as defined for this input parameter in 3GPP specifications, or, if undefined elsewhere, let n be the least multiple of 8 that is greater or equal to the number of bits of the base 2 encoding of j
  3. Create an octet string such that the least significant bit of the octet string shall be equal to the least significant bit of j written in base 2, the second to least significant bit of the octet string shall be equal to the second to least significant bit of j written in base 2 and so on (according to clause 3.4 of this specification). If the number of bits in j written in base 2 is less than n, the remaining most significant bits in the octet string shall be set to zero; if the number of bits in j written in base 2 is equal to n, there is no need for such zero padding.
The encoding Li of the number k of octets in Pi follows the above rule.
EXAMPLE1: If Pi is Uplink NAS COUNT then the number k of octets in Pi is 4,
according to TS 33.401, Annex A, and n = 32. Assume that Uplink NAS COUNT has
the integer value j = 259. Then the base 2 encoding of 259 is 100000011, and
Pi consists of the octet string 0000000 0000000 00000001 00000011, or 0x00
0x00 0x01 0x03 in hex representation, and Li consists of the octet string
0000000 00000100, or 0x00 0x04 in hex representation.
EXAMPLE2: If the length of Pi is undefined elsewhere, and the integer value j
= 259 is to be encoded into the parameter Pi then the base 2 encoding of 259
is 100000011, n and hence the length of parameter Pi in bits is 16, the number
k of octets in Pi is 2, and Pi consists of the octet string 00000001 00000011,
or 0x01 0x03 in hex representation, and Li consists of the octet string
0000000 00000010, or 0x00 0x02 in hex representation.
## B.2.2 FC value allocations
FC values allocated for this specification shall be in range of 0x00 -- 0x0F.
FC values allocated for TS 33.401 [35] shall be in range of 0x10 -- 0x1F.
FC values allocated for TS 33.402 [36] shall be in range of 0x20 -- 0x2F.
FC values allocated for TS 33.102 [2] shall be in range of 0x30 -- 0x3F.
FC values allocated for TS 33.224 [39] shall be in range 0x40 -- 0x48.
FC values in range 0x49 -- 0xFF are reserved for future use.
# B.3 NAF specific key derivation in GBA and GBA_U
In GBA and GBA_U, the input parameters for the key derivation function shall
be the following:
\- FC = 0x01,
\- P1 = RAND,
\- L1 = length of RAND is 16 octets (i.e. 0x00 0x10),
\- P2 = IMPI encoded to an octet string using UTF-8 encoding (see clause
B.2.1),
\- L2 = length of IMPI is variable (not greater that 65535),
\- P3 = NAF_ID with the FQDN part of the NAF_ID encoded to an octet string
using UTF-8 encoding (see clause B.2.1), and
\- L3 = length of NAF_ID is variable (not greater that 65535).
In the key derivation of Ks_NAF as specified in clause 4 and Ks_ext_NAF as
specified in clause 5,
\- P0 = \"gba-me\" (i.e. 0x67 0x62 0x61 0x2d 0x6d 0x65), and
\- L0 = length of P0 is 6 octets (i.e., 0x00 0x06).
In the key derivation of Ks_int_NAF as specified in clause 5,
\- P0 = \"gba-u\" (i.e. 0x67 0x62 0x61 0x2d 0x75), and
\- L0 = length of P0 is 5 octets (i.e., 0x00 0x05).
The Key to be used in key derivation shall be:
\- Ks (i.e. CK \|\| IK concatenated) as specified in clauses 4 and 5,
NOTE: In the specification this function is denoted as:\ Ks_NAF = KDF (Ks,
\"gba-me\", RAND, IMPI, NAF_Id),\ Ks_ext_NAF = KDF (Ks, \"gba-me\", RAND,
IMPI, NAF_Id), and\ Ks_int_NAF = KDF (Ks, \"gba-u\", RAND, IMPI, NAF_Id).
# B.4 Derivation of TMPI
Derivation of TMPI follows the same procedure as NAF specific key derivation
in GBA and GBA_U (see clause B.3). As the TMPI is stored in ME, for GBA_U the
procedure for derivation of Ks_ext_NAF is followed.
NOTE: This procedure was chosen to avoid any changes to existing UICCs in case
of GBA_U.
The BSF_Id defined in this clause consists of the full DNS name of the BSF as
used for B-TID generation (see clause 4.5.2), concatenated with the Ua
security protocol identifier for TMPI as specified in Annex H.
In GBA and GBA_U, the input parameters for the key derivation function to
derive the TMPI shall be the following:
\- FC = 0x01,
\- P0 = \"gba-me\" (i.e. 0x67 0x62 0x61 0x2d 0x6d 0x65) (see clause B.3 for
Ks_NAF and Ks_ext_NAF),
\- L0 = length of P0 is 6 octets (i.e., 0x00 0x06).
\- P1 = RAND,
\- L1 = length of RAND is 16 octets (i.e. 0x00 0x10),
\- P2 = IMPI encoded to an octet string using UTF-8 encoding (see clause
B.2.1),
\- L2 = length of IMPI is variable (not greater that 65535),
\- P3 = the BSF_Id encoded to an octet string using UTF-8 encoding (see clause
B.2.1), and
\- L3 = length of P3 is variable (not greater that 65535).
The Key to be used in derivation of TMPI shall be:
\- Ks (i.e. CK \|\| IK concatenated) as specified in clauses 4 and 5.
The TMPI is then computed as TEMP\@tmpi.bsf.3gppnetwork.org where TEMP is the
base64-encoding [12] of the 24 most significant octets of the output of KDF.
###### ### Annex C: (Void)
###### ## Annex D (informative): Dialog example for user selection of UICC
application used in GBA
For certain cases, clause 4.4.8 specifies user involvement in the selection of
the UICC application used for GBA procedures. A dialog window example for such
an involvement is described below:
\- The title of the dialog: \"Authentication request\".
\- Explanation: \"A service requires you to authenticate, please select your
identity:\"
\- List of identities: A selectable list of applications on the UICC. The text
visible for each application is extracted from the \"Label\" field of the
application list on the UICC.
\- Buttons: \"Select\" and \"Cancel\".
###### ## Annex E (normative): TLS profile for securing Zn/Zn\' reference
points
This Annex applies for the Zn' reference point when using DIAMETER or HTTP,
and applies for the Zn reference point if using HTTP.
The TLS profile is specified in TS 33.310 [19], Annex E and shall apply with
the addition that TLS 1.0 [28] shall also be supported. For all TLS versions
the provisions on ciphersuites given in TS 33.310 [19], Annex E, shall apply.
The TLS endpoints shall mutually authenticate using certificates as part of
TLS session establishment.
NOTE: It is likely that support of TLS 1.0 will no longer be mandatory in a
future 3GPP release.
The TLS certificates shall follow the requirements in clause 6.1 of TS 33.310
[19] for TLS certificates, with the exceptions as given in the following.
The Zn-Proxy certificate, i.e. the client certificate used in TLS handshake,
shall contain the subjectAltName extension with one or more dNSName names. The
dNSName name may contain the wildcard character \'*\' and the matching is
performed as specified in RFC 2818 [18] section 3.1.
The Zn-Proxy certificate shall contain all the DNS names of NAFs that may send
a request for NAF specific shared secret through the Zn-Proxy to the
subscriber\'s home BSF. If a new NAF is added, the new DNS name is either
covered in the certificate by using the wildcard character approach (e.g.
\"*.operator.com\"), or a new dNSName name needs to be added to the
certificate. In the latter case, new certificate is needed for the Zn-Proxy.
###### ## Annex F (informative): Handling of TLS certificates
An authentication framework for TLS is available [19].
###### ## Annex G (normative): GBA_U UICC-ME interface
This annex describes the UICC-ME interface to be used when a GBA_U aware UICC
application is active and the ME is involved in a GBA bootstrapping procedure.
When the UICC application is not GBA_U aware, the ME uses AUTHENTICATE command
in non-GBA_U security context (i.e. UMTS security context in case of USIM
application and IMS security context in case of the ISIM) as defined in TS
31.102 [1] and TS 31.103 [10].
# G.1 GBA_U Bootstrapping procedure
This procedure is part of the Bootstrapping procedure as described in clause
5.3.2.
The ME sends RAND and AUTN to the UICC, which performs the Ks derivation as
described in clause 5.3.2.
The UICC then stores Ks. The UICC also stores the used RAND to identify the
current bootstrapped values. RAND value in the UICC shall be further
accessible by the ME.
The ME then finalizes the Bootstrapping procedure and stores in the UICC the
Transaction Identifier (B-TID) and Key Life Time associated with the previous
bootstrapped keys (i.e. Ks). Transaction Identifier and Key Life Time values
in the UICC shall be further accessible by the ME.
At the end of the GBA_U bootstrapping procedure the UICC stores Ks,
Transaction Identifier, Key Life Time and the RAND.
The UICC sends RES to the ME.
A new bootstrapping procedure replaces Ks, B-TID, Key LifeTime and RAND values
of the previous bootstrapping procedure.
Figure G.1: GBA_U Bootstrap Procedure
# G.2 GBA_U NAF Derivation procedure
This procedure is part of the Procedures using bootstrapped Security
Association as described in clause 5.3.3
The ME sends NAF_ID and IMPI to the UICC. The UICC then performs Ks_ext_NAF
and Ks_int_NAF derivation as described in clause 5.3.2. The UICC uses the RAND
and Ks values stored from the previous bootstrapping procedure. The UICC
returns Ks_ext_NAF to the ME and stores Ks_int_NAF and associated B-TID
together with NAF_Id.
In case that the UICC does not have enough storage available for the generated
Ks_int_NAF and associated parameters, the UICC shall overwrite an existing
Ks_int_NAF entry (Ks_int_NAF and associated parameters). To determine the
Ks_int_NAF to overwrite, the UICC shall construct a list of Ks_int_NAF entry
numbers by storing in the list first position the entry number of the last
used or derived Ks_int_NAF and by shifting down the remaining list elements.
The last Ks_int_NAF entry number in this list corresponds to the Ks_int_NAF to
overwrite when the UICC runs out of free records.
If an existing Ks_int_NAF entry in use is overwritten, the application
Ks_int_NAF shall not be affected (e.g. in case a Ks_int_NAF was put into use
as an MBMS MUK key, the MUK key shall continue to be available for the MBMS
application).
NOTE: A previous GBA_U Bootstrap needs to be undertaken before. If Ks is not
available in the UICC, the command will answer with the appropriate error
message.
The input parameters IMPI and the FQDN part of NAF_ID shall be encoded as
specified Annex B.2.1.
Figure G.2: GBA_U NAF derivation procedure
###### ## Annex H (normative): Ua security protocol identifier
# H.1 Definition
The Ua security protocol identifier is a string of five octets. The first
octet denotes the organization which specifies the Ua security protocol. The
four remaining octets denote a specific security protocol within the
responsibility of the organization.
For all Ua protocols specified by 3GPP this Annex shall contain a complete
list of these protocols. For Ua protocols specified by other organizations
this Annex shall only specify the organization octet of the Ua security
protocol identifier. Two organization octets are reserved for special use.
# H.2 Organization Octet
The organization octet denotes the organization specifying the particular
protocol. Each organization intending to specify a Ua security protocol
identifier shall apply to 3GPP to receive an organization octet value, which
shall be registered within this Annex. Following is a list of registered
organization octets:
\"0x00\" as first octet is the default value for protocols not specified
otherwise. When octet \"0x00\" is used as first octet, only Ua security
protocol identifier ( 0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00 ) shall be used.
NOTE 1: All protocols having this Ua security protocol identifier cannot be
separated from each other.
\"0x01\" .. \"0xFE\" as the first octet denote organizations specifying Ua
security protocol identifiers.
\"0xFF\" as the first octet denotes the private range of Ua security protocol
identifiers.
NOTE 2: identifiers with \"0xFF\" as first octet may be used for defining
local/experimental protocols without need for registration. When using such an
identifier, however, it may happen that a security breach in one security
protocol over Ua can be exploited by an attacker to mount successful attacks
on a different security protocol over Ua.
The following values for organizations are assigned:
\"0x01\" 3GPP
NOTE 3: All protocols having the organization octet \"0x01\" are specified in
annex H.3.
\"0x02\" 3GPP2
\"0x03\" Open Mobile Alliance
\"0x04\" GSMA
# H.3 Ua security protocol identifiers for 3GPP specified protocols
The following Ua security protocol identifiers are specified by 3GPP:
( 0x01,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00 ) Ua security protocol according to TS 33.221 [5].
( 0x01,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x01 ) Ua security protocols according to TS 33.246
[26].
NOTE 1: TS 33.246 [26] provides key separation between the keys that are used
within HTTP digest and MIKEY protocols.
> ( 0x01,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x02) Ua security protocol HTTP digest authentication
> according to TS 24.109 [29], unless HTTP digest authentication is used in
> the context of another Ua security protocol, which is already covered
> elsewhere in this Annex.
>
> ( 0x01,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x03 ) Ua security protocols used with HTTP-based
> security procedures for MBMS user services according to TS 26.237 [38].
>
> ( 0x01,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x04 ) Ua security protocols used with SIP-based
> security procedures for MBMS user services according to TS 26.237 [38].
>
> ( 0x01,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x05 ) Ua security protocols used with Generic Push
> Layer according to TS 33.224 [39], unless Generic Push Layer is used in the
> context of another Ua security protocol, which is already covered elsewhere
> in this Annex.
>
> ( 0x01,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x06 ) Ua security protocol for IMS UE to KMS http

> [40]
( 0x01,0x00,0x00, 0x01,0x00 ) Generation of TMPI according to Annex B.4.
NOTE 2: This protocol identifier is not strictly a Ua protocol identifier, but
its use in key derivation function is exactly equal.to a Ua protocol
identifier.
> ( 0x01,0x00,0x01,yy,zz ) Ua security protocol for \"Shared key-based UE
> authentication with certificate-based NAF authentication\", according to TS
> 33.222 [25], or \"Shared key-based mutual authentication between UE and
> NAF\", according to TS 33.222 [25]. Here, \"yy,zz\" is the protection
> mechanism CipherSuite code according to the defined values for TLS
> CipherSuites in TLS V1.2 [41] and PSK Ciphersuites for TLS [27].
NOTE 3: As an example: RFC 5246 [41] CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
has code = { 0x00,0x0A }, thus the according protocol identifier shall be (
0x01,0x00,0x01,0x00,0x0A ).
###### ## Annex I (normative): 2G GBA
This annex specifies the implementation option to allow the use of SIM cards
or SIMs on UICC for GBA. The procedure specified in this annex is called 2G
GBA. 2G GBA allows access to applications in a more secure way than would be
possible with the use of passwords or with GSM without enhancements. It may be
useful for operators who have not yet fully deployed USIMs.
The usage of the term 2G GBA in this specification does not restrict the usage
of GBA over only 2G access networks i.e. GSM access. Similarly the use of the
term 3G GBA in this specification does not restrict the usage of GBA over only
3G access networks i.e. UMTS. In this specification the term 2G GBA refers to
the usage of a SIM card or SIM on UICC, while 3G GBA or GBA on its own, refers
and to the usage of a USIM/ISIM on a UICC.
# I.1 Reference model
The reference model is the same as described in section 4.1.
# I.2 Network elements
## I.2.1 Bootstrapping server function (BSF)
A generic Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) and the UE shall mutually
authenticate using the 2G AKA protocol and the TLS protocol, and agree on
session keys that are afterwards applied between UE and a Network Application
Function (NAF). The BSF shall restrict the applicability of the key material
to a specific NAF by using the key derivation procedure as specified in Annex
B. The key derivation procedure may be used with multiple NAFs during the
lifetime of the key material. The lifetime of the key material is set
according to the local policy of the BSF. The generation of key material is
specified in clause I.5.2.
The BSF shall be able to acquire the GBA user security settings (GUSS) from
the HSS.
The BSF shall be able to discover from the type of authentication vectors sent
by the HSS whether the subscriber is a 2G or a 3G subscriber.
The BSF shall be able to keep a list, which assigns NAFs to NAF Groups. This
list is used to select if any and which application-specific USS within GUSS
is valid for a certain NAF.
NOTE 1: The operator does the assignment of NAFs to NAF Groups. NAF Group
definitions in HSS and all connected BSFs belonging to the same operator\'s
network shall be equal (cf., clause I.2.3). As these network elements belong
to the same operator\'s network, standardisation of the NAF Group definitions
themselves is not necessary in 3GPP.
NOTE 2: The NAF grouping may be e.g. \"home\" and \"visited\". It allows the
BSF to send USSs for the same application with e.g. different authorization
flags to different NAFs, e.g., in home network and visited networks. The NAF
e.g. in visited network indicates only the requested application, but it is
unaware of the grouping in home network of the subscriber.
NOTE 3: If support of GBA User Security Settings (GUSS) for service
differentiation is desired in combination with HLR, then this can be achieved
by addition of a database to the BSF containing the needed GUSS information.
## I.2.2 Network application function (NAF)
After the bootstrapping has been completed, the UE and a NAF can run some
application specific protocol where the authentication of messages will be
based on those session keys generated during the mutual authentication between
UE and BSF.
General assumptions for the functionality of a NAF are:
\- there need not be a previous security association between the UE and the
NAF;
\- NAF shall be able to locate and communicate securely with the subscriber\'s
BSF;
\- NAF shall be able to acquire a shared key material established between UE
and the BSF during the run of the application-specific protocol;
\- NAF shall be able to acquire zero or more application-specific USSs from
the HSS via the BSF;
\- NAF shall be able to set the local validity condition of the shared key
material according to the local policy;
\- NAF shall be able to check lifetime and local validity condition of the
shared key material;
\- NAF shall have a policy whether to accept 2G subscribers. However, whether
the SIM card is allowed to be used with a specific Ua application or not, is
dependent on the relevant Ua application. If there is a specific TS for the
particular Ua protocol, e.g. TS 33.141 for Presence, and unless this
specification explicitly prohibits the use of SIM, the operator is allowed to
configure a BSF policy whether to accept 2G subscribers or not for this Ua
application.
NOTE: Without additional measures, GBA does not guarantee the freshness of the
key, Ks(_int/ext)_NAF in the sense that it does not guarantee that the key was
not used in a previous run of the Ua protocol. The additional measures which
may be taken by the UE and the NAF to ensure key freshness in GBA are:
> 1) enforce a new run of the Ub protocol (thus generating a new Ks) before
> deriving a new Ks_NAF.
>
> 2) store previously used keys Ks(_int/ext)_NAF, or the corresponding key
> identifiers B-TID, until the end of their lifetime.
>
> A UE and a NAF that support a Ua protocol that does not provide replay
> protection over unconnected runs of the protocol, will need to take
> corresponding action to avoid replay attacks if desired.
## I.2.2a Zn-Proxy
The text from section 4.2.2a applies also here.
## I.2.3 HSS
The set of all user security settings (USSs), i.e. GUSS, is stored in the HSS.
The requirements on the HSS are:
\- HSS shall provide the only persistent storage for GUSSs;
\- GUSS shall be defined in such a way that interworking of different
operators for standardised application profiles is possible;
\- GUSS shall be defined in such a way that profiles for operator specific
applications and extensions to existing application profiles are supported
without need for standardisation of these elements.
\- GUSS shall be able to contain application-specific USSs that contain
parameters that are related to identification or authorization information of
one or more applications hosted by one ore more NAFs. Any other types of
parameters are not allowed in the application-specific USS.
NOTE 1: The necessary subscriber profile data may be fetched by the NAF from
its local database.
NOTE 2: One possibility to revoke temporarily an application specific USS from
the GUSS is that the HSS may temporarily remove an application-specific USS
from the GUSS if the service is temporarily revoked from the subscriber. The
GUSS in the BSF is not changed by this operation and only updated when the
existing bootstrapping session times out, or is overwritten by a new
bootstrapping session during which the new modified GUSS is fetched from HSS
along with the AV.
\- GUSS shall be able to contain parameters intended for the BSF usage:
\- subscriber specific key lifetime;
\- optionally the timestamp indicating the time when the GUSS has been last
modified by the HSS.
NOTE 3: These parameters are optional and if they are missing from
subscriber\'s GUSS or subscriber does not have GUSS then the BSF will use the
default values in the BSF local policy defined by the particular MNO.
\- HSS shall be able to assign application-specific USSs to a NAF Group. This
shall be defined in such a way that different USSs for the same application,
but for different groups of NAFs, are possible. The restrictions on the number
of USSs per GUSS are dependent on the usage of NAF Groups by the operator:
\- if no NAF Groups are defined for this application then at most one USS per
application is stored in GUSS;
\- if NAF Groups are defined for this application then at most one USS per
application and NAF Group is stored in GUSS.
\- NAF Group definitions in the HSS and all connected BSFs belonging to the
same operator\'s network shall be equal.
\- Information on UICC type and on key choice are not required for 2G
subscribers. 2G GBA is regarded as ME-based.
## I.2.4 UE
The required functionalities from the UE are:
\- the support of HTTP Digest AKA protocol;
\- the support of TLS;
\- the capability to use a SIM in bootstrapping;
\- the capability for a Ua application on the ME to indicate to the GBA
Function on the ME whether a SIM is allowed for use in bootstrapping (see
clause I.4.8);
\- the capability to derive new key material to be used with the protocol over
Ua interface from Kc, RAND, SRES and Ks-input;
\- support of NAF-specific application protocol (For an example see TS 33.221
[5]).
A 2G GBA-aware ME shall support both 3G GBA_U, as specified in clause 5.2 and
3G GBA_ME procedures, as specified in clause 4.5.
## I.2.5 SLF
The text from section 4.2.5 applies also here.
## I.2.6 HLR
The requirement on the HLR is the same as in clause 4.3.6.
# I.3 Bootstrapping architecture and reference points
## I.3.1 Reference point Ub
The reference point Ub is between the UE and the BSF. Reference point Ub
provides mutual authentication between the UE and the BSF. It allows the UE to
bootstrap the session keys based on 2G AKA infrastructure.
## I.3.2 Reference point Ua
The reference point Ua carries the application protocol, which is secured
using the keys material agreed between UE and BSF as a result of the run of
the protocol over reference point Ub.
## I.3.3 Reference point Zh
The reference point Zh used between the BSF and the HSS allows the BSF to
fetch the required authentication information and all GBA user security
settings from the HSS. The reference point Zh is an intra-operator domain
interface. The interface to the 2G Authentication Centre is HSS-internal, and
it need not be standardised as part of this architecture.
## I.3.4 Reference point Zn
The reference point Zn is used by the NAF to fetch the key material agreed
during a previous protocol run over the reference point Ub from the UE to the
BSF. It is also used to fetch application-specific user security settings from
the BSF, if requested by the NAF.
## I.3.5 Reference point Dz
The text from section 4.3.5 applies also here.
## I.3.6 Reference point Zh\'
The optional reference point Zh\' used between the BSF and the HLR allows the
BSF to fetch the required authentication information. The reference point Zh\'
is an intra-operator domain interface.
# I.4 Requirements and principles for bootstrapping
The following requirements and principles are applicable to bootstrapping
procedure:
\- the bootstrapping function shall not depend on the particular NAF;
\- the server implementing the bootstrapping function needs to be trusted by
the home operator to handle authentication vectors;
\- the server implementing the NAF needs only to be trusted by the home
operator to handle derived key material;
\- it shall be possible to support NAF in the operator\'s home network and in
the visited network;
\- the architecture shall not preclude the support of network application
function in a third network;
\- to the extent possible, existing protocols and infrastructure should be
reused;
\- in order to ensure wide applicability, all involved protocols are preferred
to run over IP;
\- it shall be prevented that a security breach in one NAF who is using the
GBA, can be used by an attacker to mount successful attacks to the other NAFs
using the GBA.
\- an attacker shall not be able to exploit a security breach in one security
protocol over Ua in order to mount a successful attack against a different
security protocol over Ua.
\- Existing SIM cards or SIMs on UICCs and their specifications shall not be
impacted.
\- If USIM or ISIM are available they shall be used as specified in sections 4
and 5, and 2G GBA shall not be used.
\- 2G GBA shall not impact the USIM / ISIM based GBA as specified in sections
4 and 5.
\- 2G GBA shall not reduce security for USIM / ISIM users.
\- 2G GBA shall minimise the changes to the USIM / ISIM based GBA specified in
section 4.
\- 2G GBA shall provide measures to mitigate known vulnerabilities of GSM.
## I.4.1 Access Independence
Bootstrapping procedure is access independent. Bootstrapping procedure
requires IP connectivity from UE.
## I.4.2 Authentication methods
Authentication between the UE and the BSF shall not be possible without a
valid cellular subscription. Authentication shall be based on the GSM
authentication (also called 2G AKA) protocol. BSF authentication shall in
addition be based on TLS with server certificates.
## I.4.3 Roaming
The text from section 4.4.3 applies also here.
## I.4.4 Requirements on reference point Ub
The requirements for reference point Ub are:
\- the BSF shall be able to identify the UE;
\- the BSF and the UE shall be able to authenticate each other based on the
methods in I.4.2;
\- the BSF shall be able to send a bootstrapping transaction identifier to the
UE;
\- the UE and the BSF shall establish shared keys;
\- the BSF shall be able to indicate to the UE the lifetime of the key
material. The key lifetime sent by the BSF over Ub shall indicate the expiry
time of the key.
NOTE: This does not preclude a UE to refresh the key before the expiry time
according to the UE\'s local policy.
## I.4.5 Requirements on reference point Zh
The requirements for reference point Zh are:
\- mutual authentication, confidentiality and integrity shall be provided;
NOTE 1: This requirement may be fulfilled by physical or proprietary security
measures since BSF and HSS are located within the same operator's network.
\- the BSF shall be able to send bootstrapping information request concerning
a subscriber;
\- optionally the BSF may have the capability able to send the timestamp of
subscriber\'s GBA user security settings to the HSS (timestamp option);
\- the HSS shall be able to send one 2G AKA vector at a time to the BSF;
\- the HSS shall be able to send the complete set of subscriber\'s GBA user
security settings needed for security purposes to the BSF. Optionally the HSS
may have the capability to indicate to the BSF whether the BSF already has the
latest copy of the GUSS based on the GUSS timestamp (timestamp option);
NOTE 2: If subscriber\'s GUSS is updated in HSS, this is not propagated to the
BSF. The GUSS in the BSF is updated when the BSF next time fetches the
authentication vectors and GUSS from the HSS over Zh reference point as part
of the bootstrapping procedure.
\- no state information concerning bootstrapping shall be required in the HSS;
\- all procedures over reference point Zh shall be initiated by the BSF;
\- the number of different interfaces to HSS should be minimized.
## I.4.6 Requirements on reference point Zn
The requirements for reference point Zn are:
\- mutual authentication, confidentiality and integrity shall be provided;
\- If the BSF and the NAF are located within the same operator\'s network, the
DIAMETER based Zn reference point shall be secured according to NDS/IP [13];
\- If the BSF and the NAF are located in different operators\' networks, the
DIAMETER based Zn\' reference point between the Zn-Proxy and the BSF shall be
secured using TLS as specified in Annex E of the present document;
\- An HTTP based Zn/Zn\' reference point shall be secured using TLS as
specified in Annex E of the present document;
\- The BSF shall verify that the requesting NAF is authorised to obtain the
key material or the key material and the requested USS;
\- The NAF shall be able to send a key material request to the BSF, containing
NAF\'s public hostname used by the UE\'s corresponding request. The BSF shall
be able to verify that a NAF is authorized to use this hostname, i.e. the FQDN
used by UE when it contacts the NAF;
\- The BSF shall be able to send the requested key material to the NAF;
\- The NAF shall be able to get a selected set of application-specific USSs
from the BSF, depending on the policy of the BSF and the application indicated
in the request from the NAF over Zn;
\- The NAF shall be able to indicate to the BSF the single application or
several applications it requires USSs for;
NOTE 2: If some application needs only a subset of an application-specific USS
the NAF selects this subset from the complete set of USS sent from BSF.
\- The BSF shall be able to be configured on a per NAF or per application
basis if private subscriber identity and which application-specific USSs may
be sent to a NAF;
NOTE 3: Privacy issues need be considered when determining which user
identifier is sent to the NAF. If service continuity is desired, then the BSF
can be configured to send the IMPI (but then there is no user anonymity). If
the BSF does not send the IMPI or IMPU / pseudonym in the USS, then the user
remains anonymous towards the NAF; or more precisely, the B-TID functions as a
temporary user identifier. This can cause that the NAF cannot provide a
continuous service, since a user identity is needed in the NAF to ensure that
the NAF is able to update keys for a Ua session when the UE has bootstrapped
and contacts the NAF with a new B-TID. If user privacy is desired, the NAF can
requests a USS and the BSF is configured to send a user pseudonym in the USS,
but not the IMPI.
\- If a NAF requests USSs from the BSF and they are not present in
subscriber\'s GUSS, it shall not cause an error, provided the conditions of
the local policy of the BSF are fulfilled. The BSF shall then send only the
requested and found USSs to the NAF;
\- It shall be possible to configure a local policy as follows: BSF may
require one or more application-specific USS to be present in a particular
subscriber's GUSS for a particular requesting NAF, and to reject the request
from the NAF in case the conditions are not fulfilled. In order to satisfy
this local policy, it is not required that the NAF requests the USSs over the
Zn reference point, which the BSF requires to be present in the GUSS, rather
it is sufficient that the BSF checks the presence of the USSs locally. It
shall also be possible configure the BSF in such a way that no USS is required
for the requesting NAF;
\- The BSF shall be able to indicate to the NAF the bootstrapping time and the
lifetime of the key material. The key lifetime sent by the BSF over Zn shall
indicate the expiry time of the key, and shall be identical to the key
lifetime sent by the BSF to the UE over Ub.
NOTE 4: This does not preclude a NAF to refresh the key before the expiry time
according to the NAF\'s local policy.
NOTE 5: If one or more of the USSs that have been delivered to the NAF has
been updated in subscriber\'s GUSS in the HSS, this change is propagated to
the NAF the next time it fetches the USS from the BSF over Zn reference point
(provided that the BSF has updated subscriber\'s GUSS from the HSS over Zh
reference point).
\- The BSF shall send information to the NAF that the subscriber is a 2G
subscriber. If no such information is sent the NAF shall assume that the
subscriber is a 3G subscriber.
NOTE 6: This requirement enables a NAF to accept 2G subscribers according to
its local policy. The second sentence ensures backward compatibility with the
procedures specified in section 4 and 5 of this specification. Note also that
inclusion of information on the type of subscription in the GUSS would not
suffice to satisfy this requirement as a GUSS need not be present for every
subscriber.
\- The BSF may determine according to its local policy that the NAF shall not
serve 2G subscribers. If this is the case, the BSF does not send keys to the
NAF.
NOTE 7: This requirement allows an operator controlling the BSF to determine
which applications shall use 3G security only. This requirement is also
necessary for NAFs, which are not capable to evaluate the information about
the subscription type sent by the BSF, e.g. pre-release 7 NAFs.
\- NAF shall be able to indicate to BSF the protocol identifier of Ua security
protocol it requires the key material by sending NAF-Id to BSF (cf. Annex H).
## I.4.7 Requirements on Bootstrapping Transaction Identifier
Bootstrapping transaction identifier (B-TID) shall be used to bind the
subscriber identity to the keying material in reference points Ua, Ub and Zn.
Requirements for B-TID are:
\- B-TID shall be globally unique;
\- B-TID shall be usable as a key identifier in protocols used in the
reference point Ua;
\- NAF shall be able to detect the home network and the BSF of the UE from the
B-TID.
NOTE 1: NAF can remove the security association based on deletion conditions
after the key has become invalid.
NOTE 2: Care has to be taken that the parallel use of GBA and non-GBA
authentication between UE and NAF does not lead to conflicts, e.g. in the name
space. This potential conflict cannot be resolved in a generic way as it is
dependent on specific protocol and authentication mechanism used between UE
and application server. It is therefore out of scope of this specification.\
For the example of HTTP Digest authentication used between UE and NAF,
parallel use is possible as the following applies: \-pairs
must be unique to one realm only. As the NAF controls the realm names, it has
to ensure that only the GBA based realm is named with the reserved 3GPP realm
name. In the special case that the NAF wants to allow non GBA based
authentication in the GBA realm also, it has to ensure that no usernames in
the format of a B-TID are used outside GBA based authentication.
## I.4.8 Requirements on selection of UICC application and SIM card
If a UICC is present in the UE, containing a USIM or an ISIM, then a USIM or
ISIM shall be used as specified in section 4.4.8. Otherwise a SIM shall be
used.
If no UICC, but a SIM card is present in the UE, the SIM card shall be used.
The IMPI is obtained from the IMSI as specified in section 4.4.8.
## I.4.9 Requirements on reference point Ua
The text from section 4.4.9 applies also here.
## I.4.10 Requirements on reference point Dz
The text from section 4.4.10 applies also here.
## I.4.11 Requirements on reference point Zh\'
The requirements for reference point Zh\' are the same as in clause 4.4.12.
# I.5 Procedures
This chapter specifies in detail the format of the 2G GBA bootstrapping
procedure that is further utilized by various applications. It contains the
authentication procedure with BSF, and the key material generation procedure.
## I.5.1 Initiation of bootstrapping
Before communication between the UE and the NAF can start, the UE and the NAF
first have to agree whether to use the GBA. When a UE wants to interact with a
NAF, but it does not know if the NAF requires the use of shared keys obtained
by means of the GBA, the UE shall contact the NAF for further instructions
(see figure I.2).
{width="3.2597222222222224in" height="1.8916666666666666in"}
Figure I.2: Initiation of bootstrapping
1\. UE starts communication over reference point Ua with the NAF without any
GBA-related parameters.
2\. If the NAF requires the use of shared keys obtained by means of the GBA,
but the request from UE does not include GBA-related parameters, the NAF
replies with a bootstrapping initiation message. The form of this indication
may depend on the particular reference point Ua and is specified in the
relevant stage 3-specifications.
## I.5.2 Bootstrapping procedures
When a UE wants to interact with a NAF, and it knows that the bootstrapping
procedure is needed, it shall first perform a bootstrapping authentication
(see figure I.3). Otherwise, the UE shall perform a bootstrapping
authentication only when it has received bootstrapping initiation required
message or a bootstrapping negotiation indication from the NAF, or when the
lifetime of the key in UE has expired (cf. subclause I.5.3).
Figure I.3: The bootstrapping procedure
1\. The UE sets up a confidentiality-protected TLS tunnel with the BSF. In the
set up of the TLS tunnel, the UE shall authenticate the BSF by means of a
certificate provided by the BSF. The UE shall check that the \"realm\"
attribute contains the same FQDN of the BSF that was present in the
certificate offered by the BSF. All further communication between ME and BSF
is sent through this TLS tunnel. The UE now sends an initial HTTPS request.
2\. The BSF requests authentication vectors and GUSS from the HSS over Zh. The
HSS returns the complete set of GBA user security settings (GUSS) and one 2G
authentication vectors (AV = RAND, SRES, Kc) over the Zh reference point. The
BSF discovers that the UE is equipped with 2G SIM by looking at the type of
authentication vectors.
> If the BSF implements the timestamp option and has a local copy of the GUSS
> for the subscriber that has been fetched from the HSS during a previous
> bootstrapping procedure, and this GUSS includes a timestamp, the BSF may
> include the GUSS timestamp in the request message. Upon receiving that
> timestamp, if the HSS implements the timestamp option, the HSS may compare
> it with the timestamp of the GUSS stored in the HSS. In this case, if and
> only if the HSS has done the comparison and the timestamps are equal, then
> the HSS shall send \"GUSS TIMESTAMP EQUAL\" indication to the BSF. In any
> other case, the HSS shall send the GUSS (if available) to the BSF. If the
> BSF receives \"GUSS TIMESTAMP EQUAL\" indication, it shall keep the local
> copy of the GUSS. In any other case, the BSF shall delete the local copy of
> the GUSS, and store the received GUSS (if sent).
In the case that no HSS with Zh reference point support is deployed, the BSF
requests the authentication vector from either an HSS with Zh\' reference
point support or an HLR over the Zh\' reference point. The HLR or HSS with
Zh\' reference point support returns one 2G authentication vectors (AV = RAND,
SRES, Kc) over the Zh\' reference point. The BSF discovers that the UE is
equipped with 2G SIM by looking at the type of authentication vectors.
The BSF converts one 2G authentication vector (RAND, Kc, SRES) to the
parameter RES.
RES = KDF (key, \"3gpp-gba-res\", SRES), truncated to 128 bits
where key = Kc \|\| Kc \|\| RAND and KDF is the key derivation function
specified in Annex B of TS 33.220.
The BSF shall also select a 128-bit random number \"Ks-input\" and set
> server specific data = Ks-input\ in the aka-nonce of HTTP Digest AKA, cf.
> [4].
NOTE 1: \"Truncated to 128 bits\" means that from the 256 bits output of KDF,
the 128 bits numbered as [0] to [127] are used.
NOTE 2: In a multiple HSS environment, the BSF may have to obtain the address
of the HSS where the subscription of the user is stored by querying the SLF,
prior to step 2.
3\. The BSF shall forward RAND and server specific data in the 401 message to
the UE (without RES). This is to demand the UE to authenticate itself.
4\. The UE extracts RAND from the message and calculates the corresponding Kc
and SRES values. It then calculates the parameter RES from these values as
specified in step 2.
5\. The UE sends another HTTP request, containing the Digest AKA response
(calculated using RES as the password) and a cnonce (cf. [3]), to the BSF.
6\. The BSF authenticates the UE by verifying the Digest AKA response. If the
authentication fails the BSF shall not re-use the authentication vector in any
further communication.
NOTE 3: The password in \"AKAv1\" HTTP Digest AKA is in binary format.
7\. The BSF shall generate key material Ks by computing Ks = KDF (key, Ks-
input, \"3gpp-gba-ks\", SRES).\ The B-TID value shall be also generated in
format of NAI by taking the base64 encoded [12] RAND value from step 3, and
the BSF server name, i.e. base64encoded(RAND)\@BSF_servers_domain_name.
NOTE 3a: If the HSS/AuC uses a good random number generator, then the chance
of a B-TID collision is practically zero. If such a collision occurs, then the
key retrieved by the NAF can have a mismatch with the UE generated NAF key.
This will result in a Ua authentication failure which will cause the NAF to
once again request the UE to bootstrap which will create a new Ks and a new
B-TID.
8\. The BSF shall send a 200 OK message, including a B-TID and an
authentication-info header (cf. [3]), to the UE to indicate the success of the
authentication. In addition, in the 200 OK message, the BSF shall supply the
lifetime of the key Ks.
9\. The UE shall abort the procedure if the server authentication according to
[3] fails. If it is successful the UE shall generate the key material Ks in
the same way as the BSF.
10\. Both the UE and the BSF shall use the Ks to derive the key material
Ks_NAF for use with the procedures specified in clause I.5.3. Ks_NAF shall be
used for securing the reference point Ua.
> Ks_NAF is computed as Ks_NAF = KDF (Ks, \"gba-me\", RAND, IMPI, NAF_Id),
> where KDF is the key derivation function as specified in Annex B, and the
> key derivation parameters consist of the user\'s IMPI, the NAF_Id and RAND.
> The NAF_Id is constructed as follows: NAF_Id = FQDN of the NAF \|\| Ua
> security protocol identifier. The Ua security protocol identifier is
> specified in Annex H. KDF shall be implemented in the ME.
NOTE 4: If a NAF hosts two or more applications which use the same FQDN and Ua
security protocol identifier, they will share the same NAF specific keys. This
causes a risk of so called two-time pad which may lead to the situation that
the security of these applications is compromised. This can be avoided by
running bootstrapping separately to each application or by application
specific means, which are however out of the scope of the current
specification.
> To allow consistent key derivation based on NAF name in UE and BSF, at least
> one of the three following prerequisites shall be fulfilled:
(1) The NAF is known in DNS under one domain name (FQDN) only, i.e. no two
different domain names point to the IP address of the NAF. This has to be
achieved by administrative means.
(2) Each DNS entry of the NAF points to a different IP address. The NAF
responds to all these IP addresses. Each IP address is tied to the
corresponding FQDN by NAF configuration. The NAF can see from the IP address,
which FQDN to use for key derivation.
(3) Ua uses a protocol which transfers the host name (FQDN of NAF as used by
UE) to NAF (e.g. HTTP/1.1 with mandatory Host request header field). This
requires the NAF to check the validity of the host name, to use this name in
all communication with UE where appropriate, and to transfer this name to BSF
to allow for correct derivation of Ks_NAF.\ In case of a TLS tunnel over Ua
this requires either multiple-identities certificates for the NAF or the
deployment of RFC 3546 [9] over Ua or other protocol means with similar
purpose over Ua.
The UE and the BSF shall store the key Ks with the associated B-TID for
further use, until the lifetime of Ks has expired, or until the key Ks is
updated or until the deletion conditions are satisfied (see 4.4.11).
## I.5.3 Procedures using bootstrapped Security Association
Before communication between the UE and the NAF can start, the UE and the NAF
first have to agree whether to use shared keys obtained by means of the GBA.
If the UE does not know whether to use GBA with this NAF, it uses the
Initiation of Bootstrapping procedure described in clause I.5.1.
Once the UE and the NAF have established that they want to use GBA then every
time the UE wants to interact with an NAF the following steps are executed as
depicted in figure I.4.
1\. UE starts communication over reference point Ua with the NAF:
\- in general, UE and NAF will not yet share the key(s) required to protect
the reference point Ua. If they already do (i.e. if a key Ks_NAF for the
corresponding key derivation parameter NAF_Id is already available), the UE
and the NAF can start to securely communicate right away. If the UE and the
NAF do not yet share a key, the UE proceeds as follows:
\- if a key Ks for the selected UICC application is available in the UE, the
UE derives the key Ks_NAF from Ks, as specified in clause I.5.2;
\- if no key Ks for the selected UICC application is available in the UE, the
UE first agrees on a new key Ks with the BSF over the reference point Ub, and
then proceeds to derive Ks_NAF;
> If it is not desired by the UE to use the same Ks for the selected UICC
> application to derive more than one Ks_NAF then the UE should agree on a new
> key Ks with the BSF over the reference point Ub, and then proceed to derive
> Ks_NAF;
\- if the NAF shares a key with the UE, but the NAF requires an update of that
key, e.g. because the key's lifetime has expired or will expire soon, or the
key can not meet the NAF local validity condition, it shall send a suitable
bootstrapping renegotiation request to the UE, see figure I.5. If the key\'s
lifetime has expired the protocol used over reference point Ua shall be
terminated. The form of this indication depends on the particular protocol
used over reference point Ua. If the UE receives a bootstrapping renegotiation
request, it starts a run of the protocol over reference point Ub, as specified
in clause I.5.2, in order to obtain a new key Ks.
> To allow for consistent key derivation in BSF and UE, both have to use the
> same FQDN for derivation (see clause I.5.2). For each protocol used over Ua
> it shall be specified if only cases (1) and (2) of clause I.5.2 are allowed
> for the NAF or if the protocol used over Ua shall transfer also the FQDN
> used for key derivation by UE to NAF.
NOTE 1: If the shared key between UE and NAF is invalid, the NAF can set
deletion conditions to the corresponding security association for subsequent
removal.
\- the UE supplies the B-TID to the NAF, in the form as specified in clause
I.3.2, to allow the NAF to retrieve the corresponding keys from the BSF;
NOTE 2: The UE may adapt the key material Ks_NAF to the specific needs of the
reference point Ua. This adaptation is outside the scope of this
specification.
\- the key management procedures for GBA related keys in the ME (i.e. Ks and
Ks_NAF keys) are described in section 4.4.11.
\- when a new Ks is agreed over the reference point Ub and a key Ks_NAF,
derived from one NAF_Id, is updated, the other keys Ks_NAF, derived from
different values NAF_Id, stored on the UE shall not be affected;
According to the procedures defined in clauses I.5.2 and I.5.3, in the UE
there is at most one Ks_NAF key stored per NAF-Id.
2\. NAF starts communication over reference point Zn with BSF
\- The NAF requests key material corresponding to the B-TID supplied by the UE
to the NAF over reference point Ua.;
\- The NAF may also request one or more application-specific USSs for the
applications, which the request received over Ua from UE may access;
NOTE 3: If the NAF requires service continuity, then the NAF can request a USS
that contains a user pseudonym that allows service continuity according to BSF
policy.
\- With the key material request, the NAF shall supply a NAF-Id (which
includes the NAF's FQDN that the UE has used to access this NAF and the Ua
security protocol identifier) to the BSF. (This is to allow for consistent key
derivation in the BSF and UE as described above). The BSF shall be able verify
that NAF is authorized to use that FQDN.
3\. The BSF derives the keys required to protect the protocol used over
reference point Ua from the key Ks and the key derivation parameters, as
specified in clause I.5.2, and supplies to NAF the requested key Ks_NAF, as
well as the bootstrapping time and the lifetime of that key, and the requested
application-specific and potentially NAF group specific USSs if they are
available in subscriber\'s GUSS and if the NAF is authorized to receive the
requested USSs. For any USSs containing a NAF Group attribute, this attribute
shall be removed in the USSs supplied to the NAF. In addition, the BSF shall
indicate to the NAF that the subscriber is a 2G subscriber. If the key
identified by the B-TID supplied by the NAF is not available at the BSF, the
BSF shall indicate this in the reply to the NAF. The NAF then indicates a
bootstrapping renegotiation request to the UE.
NOTE 4: The NAF can further set the local validity condition of the Ks_NAF
according to the local policy, for example a limitation of reuse times of a
Ks_NAF.
NOTE 5: The NAF will adapt the key material Ks_NAF to the specific needs of
the reference point Ua in the same way as the UE did. This adaptation is
outside the scope of this specification.
\- The BSF may require that one or more application-specific and potentially
NAF group specific USSs shall be present in subscriber\'s GUSS for the NAF
(see clause I.4.6). If one or more of these required settings are missing from
the GUSS, the BSF shall indicate this in the reply to the NAF.
\- The BSF may also send the private user identity (IMPI) and requested USSs
to NAF according to the BSF\'s policy;
\- If the BSF or the NAF determined, according to their local policies, that
the NAF shall not serve 2G subscribers, the NAF shall terminate the protocol
over the reference point Ua.
4\. NAF continues with the protocol used over the reference point Ua with the
UE.
Once the run of the protocol used over reference point Ua is completed the
purpose of bootstrapping is fulfilled as it enabled UE and NAF to use
reference point Ua in a secure way.
Figure I.4: The bootstrapping usage procedure
Figure I.5: Bootstrapping renegotiation request
## I.5.4 Procedure related to service discovery
The UE shall discover the address of the BSF from the IMSI on the SIM. The
same discovery procedure as specified in Section 4.5.4 shall be used.
# I.6 TLS Profile
The UE and the BSF shall support TLS according to the TLS profile given in TS
33.310 [19], Annex E.
The certificates shall comply with the requirements for TLS certificates in
clause 6.1 of TS 33.310 [19].
Support of certificate revocation and of the related fields in certificates is
optional. If supported, the certificate and CRL profiles in clause 6.1 and
6.1a of TS 33.310 [19] should be followed.
NOTE 1: The management of Root Certificates is out of scope of this Technical
Specification.
NOTE 2: If no revocation of certificates is deployed, it should be noted,
however, that choosing short lifetimes for BSF certificates may considerably
reduce the risk, in case BSF certificates may ever be compromised.
## I.6.1 void
## I.6.2 Authentication of the BSF
The Client shall authenticate the BSF by use of a server certificate. The
client shall match the server name as specified in RFC 2818 [18] section 3.1.
The ME shall use a preconfigured list of trusted root certificates for 2G GBA
BSF server certificate validation. BSF server certificate validation shall not
require manual user interaction.
## I.6.3 Authentication of the UE
The BSF shall not request a certificate in a Server Hello Message from the UE.
The BSF shall authenticate the UE as specified in clause I.5.2 of this
specification.
## I.6.4 Set-up of Security parameters
The TLS Handshake Protocol negotiates a session, which is identified by a
Session ID. The Client and the BSF shall allow for resuming a session. The
lifetime of a Session ID is subject to local policies of the UE and the BSF. A
recommended lifetime is five minutes.
NOTE: If the BSF adheres to the recommended lifetime the UE can be certain to
be able to resume the TLS session in case of bootstrapping re-negotiation.
###### ## Annex J (informative): Usage of USS with local policy enforcement in
BSF
This Annex describes how the local policy enforcement in the BSF is used
between the NAF and the BSF to control the key delivery to the NAF.
# J.1 General
A BSF may have a local policy for zero or more NAFs where the policy for a NAF
may state that subscriber\'s GUSS shall include one or more USSs identified by
a GSID. In other words, for a particular NAF the BSF may require that one more
USSs shall be present in subscriber\'s GUSS.
In general, there are two network elements where access control based on some
local policy is enforced, i.e. NAF and BSF. Thus two phases with access
control based on USSs have to be covered:
1) Access control within NAF for Ua requests: Whether the subscriber is
allowed to access the service is decided in the NAF and possibly with the help
of USSs. Upon receiving the B-TID from the UE, the NAF fetches the NAF
specific shared key (Ks_(ext/int)_NAF) from the BSF, and optionally fetches
the USSs, which typically contain NAF specific persistent user identities, and
authorization flags. Based on a local policy in the NAF, which may include
evaluating the contents of the USS, the NAF decides whether the subscriber is
allowed to access the service.
2) Access control within BSF for Zn requests: In certain cases, the operator
may wish to implement access control in the BSF. This functionality can be
used with any NAF, but the main reason for having this is to implement home
operator control in the cases where the NAF is in a visited network.
This Annex describes the access control case within the BSF for Zn requests in
more detail.
The following facts should be noted on use of this Annex:
\- This access control is completely local to the network of the BSF operator
(i.e. home operator of subscriber). This implies that no inter-operator
agreement is necessary for implementation of this access control.
\- The local policies of the BSF may be based on NAF names and on NAF groups.
For the sake of brevity only NAFs are mentioned in the following descriptions.
# J.2 Usage scenarios
Four different scenarios can be identified how the local policy enforcement in
the BSF will work:
1) A NAF does not use USSs (i.e. it does not request a USS from the BSF), and
the BSF does not have a local policy for this NAF.
2) A NAF does not use USSs (i.e. it does not request a USS from the BSF), and
the BSF does have a local policy for this NAF.
3) A NAF does use USSs (i.e., it requests one or more USSs from the BSF), and
the BSF does not have a local policy for this NAF.
4) A NAF does use USSs (i.e., it request one or more USSs from the BSF), and
the BSF does have a local policy for this NAF.
The steps executed in each of these scenarios are described in more detail in
the following subclauses.
In all scenarios the NAF has received B-TID from the UE over the Ua reference
point before the following steps are executed. The steps describe only the
procedures that are related to the local policy enforcement in the BSF with
respect to USS existence. Also transfer of other information elements not
related to this access control is not mentioned (e.g. key lifetime, private
subscriber identity).
## J.2.1 Scenario 1: NAF does not use USSs, BSF does not have local policy for
NAF
In this scenario, the NAF does not use USSs and the BSF does not have a local
policy for this NAF.
1\. The NAF requests the NAF specific shared key(s) from the BSF. It does not
include any GSIDs in the request.
2\. The BSF locates the subscriber information in its local memory using the
B-TID.
3\. The BSF checks whether a local policy exists for the NAF - in this
scenario there is no local policy, i.e. for this particular NAF, the BSF does
not require any USSs (identified by GSIDs) to be present in subscriber\'s
GUSS.
4\. The BSF derives the NAF specific shared key(s), and sends them to the NAF
in the response.
5\. The NAF receives the response with the NAF specific shared key(s).
After receiving the NAF specific shared key(s), the NAF may perform access
control to the service according to its own policies and continues to
communicate with the UE.
## J.2.2 Scenario 2: NAF does not use USSs, BSF does have local policy for NAF
In this scenario, the NAF does not use USSs and the BSF does have a local
policy for this NAF.
1\. The NAF requests the NAF specific shared key(s) from the BSF. It does not
include any GSIDs in the request.
2\. The BSF locates the subscriber information in its local memory using the
B-TID.
3\. The BSF checks whether a local policy exists for the NAF - in this
scenario there is a local policy for this NAF, i.e. for this particular NAF,
the BSF does not require any USSs (identified by GSIDs) to be present in
subscriber\'s GUSS.
The BSF checks whether all the required USSs identified by GSIDs are present
in subscriber\'s GUSS: If yes, the BSF continues from step 4. If not, the BSF
the BSF sends an error message to the NAF.
NOTE: As specified in clause 4.4.6, it is not required that the NAF requests
the USSs over the Zn reference point, which the BSF requires to be present in
the GUSS for particular NAF, rather it is sufficient that the BSF checks the
presence of the USSs locally.
4\. The BSF derives the NAF specific shared key(s), and sends them to the NAF
in the response.
5\. The NAF receives the response with the NAF specific shared key(s).
After receiving the NAF specific shared key(s), the NAF may perform access
control to the service according to its own policies and continues to
communicate with the UE.
If the NAF received the \"not authorized\" error message, it may indicate this
to the UE over Ua reference point. In any case, the GAA based security setup
will fail between the UE and the NAF since the NAF did not get the NAF
specific shared key(s).
## J.2.3 Scenario 3: NAF does use USSs, BSF does not have local policy for NAF
In this scenario, the NAF does use USSs and the BSF does not have a local
policy for this NAF.
1\. The NAF requests the NAF specific shared key(s) from the BSF. It includes
the GSIDs it needs in the request.
2\. The BSF locates the subscriber information in its local memory using the
B-TID.
3\. The BSF checks whether a local policy exists for the NAF - in this
scenario there is no local policy, i.e. BSF does not require USSs identified
by GSIDs to be present in subscriber\'s GUSS.
4\. The BSF derives the NAF specific shared key(s), and sends them and the
USSs identified by the GSIDs to the NAF in the response. If a particular USS
is not found in subscriber\'s GUSS, or the NAF is not authorized to receive a
particular USS, these USSs are omitted from the response.
5\. The NAF receives the response with the NAF specific shared key(s), and
those requested USSs that were available (i.e., found in subscriber\'s GUSS
and allowed by the BSF to be received by the NAF).
After receiving the NAF specific shared key(s) and the available USSs, the NAF
may perform access control to the service according to its own policies (e.g.
USS required or not, authorization flags required) and continue to communicate
with the UE.
## J.2.4 Scenario 4: NAF does use USSs, BSF does have local policy for NAF
In this scenario, the NAF does use USSs and the BSF does have a local policy
for this NAF.
1\. The NAF requests the NAF specific shared key(s) from the BSF. It includes
the GSIDs it needs in the request.
2\. The BSF locates the subscriber information in its local memory using the
B-TID.
3\. The BSF checks whether a local policy exists for the NAF - in this
scenario there is a local policy for this NAF, i.e., one or more USSs
identified by GSIDs shall be present in subscriber\'s GUSS.
The BSF checks whether all the required USSs identified by GSIDs are present
in subscriber\'s GUSS: If yes, the BSF continues from step 4. If not, the BSF
the BSF sends an error message to the NAF.
4\. The BSF derives the NAF specific shared key(s), and sends them and the
USSs identified by the GSIDs to the NAF in the response. If a particular USS
is not found in subscriber\'s GUSS, or the NAF is not authorized to receive a
particular USS, these USSs are omitted from the response.
5\. The NAF receives the response with the NAF specific shared key(s), and
those requested USSs that were available (i.e., found in subscriber\'s GUSS
and allowed by the BSF to be received by the NAF).
After receiving the NAF specific shared key(s) and the available USSs, the NAF
may perform access control to the service according to its own policies (e.g.
USS required or not, authorization flags required) and continue to communicate
with the UE.
If the NAF received the \"not authorized\" error message, it may indicate this
to the UE over Ua reference point. In any case, the GAA based security setup
will fail between the UE and the NAF since the NAF did not get the NAF
specific shared key(s).
###### ## Annex K (informative): Interoperator GBA-usage examples
This Annex gives examples how interoperator GBA is set up and operated.
# K.1 Example on interoperator GBA setup
Interoperator GBA is set up the following way:
\- Each home network operator sets up a BSF, which will enable bootstrapping
sessions for its own subscribers.
\- Each operator acting as a Serving Network for foreign subscribers in
interoperator GBA needs to set up a Zn-Proxy which will forward the
authentication requests from its own NAFs to the subscriber\'s home BSF
outside of the VPLMN. The GBA secret is provisioned from the home operator's
BSF through the Zn-Proxy to the NAF.
NOTE 1: The security requirements on the Zn\' reference point between the Zn-
Proxy and the BSF can be found in clause 4.2.2a.
\- Each home operator that wants to provide the GBA secrets to foreign NAFs
has to authorize these NAFs to request bootstrapping secrets. This is done by
using TLS client certificates issued to Zn-Proxies in the serving network by
the home network operator.
NOTE 2: The TLS client certificate profile is specified in the normative Annex
E.
\- An operator that wishes to co-operate in interoperator GBA with another
operator shall issue a TLS client certificate to the other operator\'s Zn-
Proxy. Two operators may both act as home operators or as serving operators
(i.e., both possess a BSF and a Zn-Proxy), but this Annex also applies to
configurations where one operator is always acting as home operator (i.e.,
hosts the BSF) and the other operator only as serving operator (i.e., the
operator hosts only the Zn-Proxy). In the second case, where the serving
foreign operator has the Zn-Proxy only, the TLS client certificate is to be
handed down in one direction only (see also Annex E on usage of client
certificates).
NOTE 3: The handling of TLS certificates is described in TS 33.310 [19]. When
two operators sign a roaming agreement, they may also enrol TLS client
certificate for each others Zn-Proxies.
NOTE 4: Interoperator GBA is based on bilateral agreements between the two
operators. For example, if operator1 has a \"GBA agreement\" with operator2
and operator1 signs another \"GBA agreement\" with operator3, this does not
mean that operator3 and operator2 have implicitly a \"GBA agreement\".
Operator2 and operator3 shall separately sign a \"GBA agreement\".
NOTE 5: The home operator may use NAF groups to support local policy checks
within its BSF (cf. clause 4.2.1). These may be e.g. one group for NAFs in
home network and one group for NAFs in serving networks, or separate groups
for each serving network the home operator has \"GBA agreements\" with. This
NAF grouping is under sole responsibility of the home operator and only
visible to him. The Zn-Proxies and NAFs in serving networks are not aware of
any NAF grouping done in home network.
As described in clause 4.2.2a, a Zn-Proxy may be co-located with a BSF (see
Figure K-2). This has the benefit that the NAF has only one logical channel to
BSF/Zn-Proxy. Therefore the NAF does not need to make a decision based on the
B-TID whether to send the authentication request to the Zn-Proxy or to the
BSF. However, this decision can be based on the B-TID as it contains the
address of the BSF.
Figure K-1: Interoperator GBA with separate BSF and Zn-Proxy
NOTE 6: The figure K-1 does not show the most general case, where there could
be one Zn-proxy per home network in each serving network. It is expected that
networks will be optimized and that the existence of one dedicated Zn-proxy
for each foreign subscriber home network will be a rare occurrence. The co-
location of all Zn-Proxies of one serving network in one location as shown in
Figure K-1 is a special case.
NOTE 7: The TLS connections between Zn-Proxy and BSF are \"directed\", this is
indicated in Figure K-1 by the arrowed lines where the arrows point to the
server TLS role. The role of the client certificates in these TLS connections
is explicitly outlined. Each direction requires a TLS server certificate used
at BSF and a TLS client certificate used at Zn-Proxy.
Figure K-2: Interoperator GBA with co-located BSF and Zn-Proxy
NOTE 8: The two distinct TLS connections between Zn-Proxy and BSF are
\"directed\", this is indicated in Figure K-2 by the two lines. Thus the two
TLS connection directions may not be intermixed, as the role of the client
certificates in these TLS connections is explicitly outlined. Each direction
requires a server TLS certificate used at BSF and a client TLS certificate
used at Zn-Proxy.
# K.2 Example on interoperator GBA operation
Interoperator GBA usage goes as follows:
NOTE 1: This description is based on GBA_ME bootstrapping to simplify the
examples, but GBA_U bootstrapping can also be used in interoperator GBA
operation.
1\. A UE contacts a NAF that does not belong to subscriber\'s home network.
The foreign NAF notifies the UE that 3GPP bootstrapping is required to secure
the connection between the UE and the NAF.
2\. The UE bootstraps with the home network via the subscriber\'s BSF. The
address of subscriber\'s home BSF is generated from user\'s IMSI or IMPI as
specified in TS 33.220, clause 4.5.4. The key Ks, and the B-TID are
established between the BSF and the UE.
3\. The UE derives the NAF specific key Ks_NAF, and uses Ks_NAF and the B-TID
on the Ua reference point between the UE and the foreign NAF. At some point
during this setup the UE transfers the B-TID to the NAF in the serving
network.
4\. Upon receiving the B-TID, the foreign NAF has two modes of operations
depending on the actual setup of the Zn-Proxy and the BSF in the serving
network:
NOTE 2: Any BSF in a network different from the home network of a subscriber
and any Zn-Proxy are not visible to the subscriber. To avoid any confusion
with the subscribers BSF in the home network, the BSF in a visited network is
called foreign BSF in this clause.
a) If the Zn-Proxy and the foreign BSF are separate entities, the foreign NAF
shall inspect the B-TID to discover whether the subscriber belongs to its own
network, or whether it is a visiting subscriber. In the former case, the
request for the Ks_NAF is sent to the BSF, in the latter case, the request is
sent to the Zn-Proxy.
b) If the Zn-Proxy and the foreign BSF are a co-located entity, the NAF sends
the request for the Ks_NAF to this co-located entity. The NAF does not need to
inspect the B-TID.
NOTE 3: Since the B-TID contains the address of subscriber\'s home BSF, it can
be used to discover the home network of the subscriber. A NAF supporting this
approach can work with both separated and co-located configurations.
5\. Upon receiving the request from the NAF, the Zn-Proxy shall inspect the
following:
b) Validate that the NAF is authorized to request the Ks_NAF (i.e., the DNS
part of NAF_Id in the message is correct).
b) Discover the BSF of the subscriber by inspecting the B-TID.
6\. The Zn-Proxy will establish or use the existing DIAMETER or HTTP session
to subscriber\'s home BSF. This DIAMETER or HTTP session is secured by TLS,
and the Zn-Proxy shall use a client certificate that the BSF trusts.
7\. The Zn-Proxy will forward the request to subscriber\'s home BSF.
8\. Subscriber\'s home BSF shall validate that the DNS part of the NAF_Id in
the request also exists in the client certificate of the Zn-Proxy.
9\. Subscriber\'s home BSF locates the bootstrapping information using the
B-TID, processes the request (including possible requests for USSs, local
policy check, etc.), derive the NAF specific key, and send the response to the
Zn-Proxy.
10\. The Zn-Proxy will forward the response to the NAF.
11\. The NAF continues with the Ua connection establishment with the UE.
Figure K-3 depicts the entities involved in the above procedure.

###### ## Annex L (informative): Information on how security threats related
to known GSM vulnerabilities are addressed by the 2G GBA solution
The 2G GBA solution aims to provide mutual authentication between UE and BSF.
This annex examines how the 2G GBA solution mitigates the impersonation of UE
or the BSF i.e. security threats related to the known GSM vulnerabilities.
The threats that are originated from the weakness in the usage of the COMP128
algorithm exist independently of the usage of 2G GBA.
## L.1 Impersonation of the UE to the BSF during the run of the Ub protocol
This is the main threat to the 2G GBA solution.
1) An attacker (being in the possession of 2G GBA equipment) could try to
perform a Man-in-the-middle-attack, impersonating a genuine GSM user to the
BSF. In this scenario the attacker would be at the client end of the TLS
tunnel to the BSF and send the challenge RAND to the target GSM user, in order
to obtain SRES and Kc. However, for the attack to be successful, he would have
to find also Kc within the runtime allowed for steps 3 to 5 of the protocol
over Ub, as specified in Annex I.5.2. This may be feasible when the terminal
of the target GSM user still runs A5/2, but is infeasible for the foreseeable
future when one of the other GSM encryption algorithms is used. A5/2 will be
removed from networks by the end of 2006, and will not be present in any 2G
GBA enabled terminals. A vulnerability caused by A5/2 would only exist in the
case where a GSM user has subscribed to 2G GBA feature, but uses his SIM in an
old terminal with A5/2 enabled while being targeted by the attacker. But the
practical implications of this remaining vulnerability are expected to be
limited as a user subscribed to 2G GBA will own a Release 7 terminal (2G GBA
will be a Release 7 feature), and the likelihood of him inserting his SIM in
an old terminal, and an attacker obtaining this information and exploiting it
for a man-in-the-middle attack, may be low in practice. Furthermore, old
terminals will gradually disappear.
2) SIM cloning: an attacker being able to find the long-term key Ki of a
genuine GSM user is able to fully impersonate him in all contexts, including
the 2G-GBA one (if this has been subscribed by the genuine user).. The
attacker could do this by exploiting weaknesses of A3/A8 as they were found
for COMP128, while in possession of the SIM i.e. the attacker tries to find
the long term key K. Even if 2G GBA does not increase the risk of possible
A3/A8 breakages, it has to be noted that the COMP128-related issue disappears
when more secure A3/A8 algorithms are used. These are available today, cf.
\"GSM MILENAGE\", as specified in TS 55.205 v610. Operators are advised in
general to discontinue the use of COMP128
3). Unauthorized access to SIM needs to be countered by platform security
methods. The impacts of a compromised SIM/ME or UICC/ME interface on GAA
security are similar in 2G GBA and 3G GBA.
# L.2 Impersonation of the BSF to the UE during the run of the Ub protocol
To prevent an impersonation attack of the BSF to the UE during the run of the
Ub protocol the authentication of the BSF to the UE is improved by protecting
the communication with TLS. An attacker succeeds only if he can break both,
the certificate-based TLS authentication to the UE and mutual authentication
provided by HTTP Digest using a password derived from GSM procedures. One way
to break TLS is to compromise the certificate.
# L.3 Finding the GBA key Ks during or after the Ub protocol run
For BSF-to-UE authentication and for establishment of the key Ks, the solution
relies on both, GSM security and TLS security. The attacker needs to know all
the parameters of the GSM triplet, in particular Kc, and additionally break
the TLS security, as the attacker also needs to know the Ks-input parameter
confidentially transmitted by the BSF over TLS. Breaking GSM security after
the Ub protocol run alone does not provide sufficient information to break 2G
GBA.
# L.4 Bidding down attack
To avoid a bidding down attack (also called downplay attack), the 2G GBA
solution requires that a GBA-enabled terminal that supports SIM based 2G GBA
must support also USIM/ISIM based 3G GBA as specified in I.2.4. If a USIM/ISIM
is available, then the terminal must use the USIM/ISIM based 3G GBA as
specified in I.4.8.
#
