# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the stage 2 of the LoCation Services (LCS)
feature in GERAN, which provides the mechanisms to support mobile location
services for operators, subscribers and third party service providers.
The purpose of this stage 2 specification is to define the GERAN LCS
architecture, functional entities and operations to support location methods.
This description is confined to the aspects of LCS within the GERAN and does
not define nor describe the LCS entities or operations within the Core
Network.
Location Services may be considered as a network provided enabling technology
consisting of standardised service capabilities, which enable the provision of
location applications. The application(s) may be service provider specific.
The description of the numerous and varied possible location applications
which are enabled by this technology are outside the scope of the present
document. However, clarifying examples of how the functionality being
described may be used to provide specific location services may be included.
This stage 2 specification covers the GERAN LCS functional model and entities,
the location methods, state descriptions, and message flows.

# 4 Main concepts
A general description of location services and the service requirements is
given in the specification 3GPP TS 22.071. By measuring radio signals the
capability to determine the geographic location of the mobile station (MS)
shall be provided. The location information may be requested by and reported
to a client (application) associated with the MS, or by a client within or
attached to the Core Network. The location information may also be utilised
internally by GERAN, for example to support features such as home location
billing. The location information shall be reported in standard formats, such
as those for cell based or geographical coordinates of the location of the MS.
It shall be possible for the majority of the MS (active or idle) within a
network to use the feature without compromising the radio transmission or
signalling capabilities of the GERAN.
Four positioning mechanisms are supported for LCS: Timing Advance (TA),
Enhanced Observed Time Difference (Eâ€‘OTD), Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) based positioning (A-GNSS) and Uplink Time Difference Of Arrival
(U-TDOA).
## 4.1 Assumptions
\- SMLC is either an integrated functionality in BSS or a standalone network
element within GERAN.
\- LMU is either an integrated functionality in BTS (Type B LMU) or a
standalone network element (Type A LMU) where communication is over the Um
interface.
## 4.2 Standard LCS Methods
### 4.2.1 Timing Advance
The TA is based on the existing Timing Advance (TA) parameter. The TA value is
known for the serving BTS. To obtain TA values in case the MS is in idle mode
a special procedure, not noticed by the GSM subscriber (no ringing tone), is
set up. The cell-ID of the serving cell and the TA is returned as the result
of the TA.
TA may be used to assist all positioning mechanisms.
### 4.2.2 Enhanced Observed Time Difference (E-OTD) positioning mechanism
The E-OTD method is based on measurements in the MS of the Enhanced Observed
Time Difference of arrival of bursts of nearby pairs of BTSs. For E-OTD
measurement synchronization, normal and dummy bursts are used. When the
transmission frames of BTSs are not synchronized, the network needs to measure
the Real or Absolute Time Differences (RTDs or ATDs) between them. To obtain
accurate trilateration, E-OTD measurements and, for nonâ€‘synchronized BTSs, RTD
or ATD measurements are needed for at least three distinct pairs of
geographically dispersed BTSs. Based on the measured E-OTD values the location
of MS can be calculated either in the network or in the MS itself, if all the
needed information is available in MS.
### 4.2.3 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based positioning
mechanism
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) refers to satellite systems that are
set up for positioning purposes. Systems belonging to this category, that are
operational today or will be in the near future are e.g., GPS, Galileo,
Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS), Modernized GPS, Quasi Zenith
Satellite System (QZSS) and GLONASS.
A mobile station with GNSS measurement capability may operate in an autonomous
mode or in an assisted mode for example MS-assisted or MS-based mode. In
autonomous mode MS determines its position based on signals received from GNSS
without assistance from network. In assisted mode, MS receives assistance data
from network. MS may support one or several GNSSs and the assistance data
content may vary depending on this capability.
A-GNSS refers to a concept which supports several global navigation satellite
systems and their different navigation signals, including e.g. GPS, Galileo,
Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS), Modernized GPS, Quasi Zenith
Satellite System (QZSS) and GLONASS. The assistance data shall enable combined
usage of satellite signals belonging to different GNSS or simple usage of one
GNSS system independently from the other.
### 4.2.4 Uplink Time Difference of Arrival (U-TDOA) positioning mechanism
The U-TDOA positioning method is based on network measurements of the Time Of
Arrival (TOA) of a known signal sent from the mobile and received at three or
more LMUs. The known signal is the normal bursts generated by a mobile while
in the dedicated mode; either on the SDCCH or TCH. The method requires LMUs in
the geographic vicinity of the mobile to be positioned to accurately measure
the TOA of the bursts. Since the geographical coordinates of the measurement
units are known, the mobile position can be calculated via hyperbolic
trilateration. This method will work with existing mobiles without any
modification.
# 5 GERAN LCS Architecture
Figure 1 shows the general arrangement of the Location Service feature. This
illustrates, generally, the relation of LCS Clients and servers in the core
network with the GERAN. The definition and operation of LCS entities operating
in the core network is outside the scope of the present document. The LCS
entities within the GERAN communicate with the Core Network (CN) across the A,
Gb and Iu interfaces.
Communication among the GERAN LCS entities makes use of the messaging and
signalling capabilities of the GERAN.
As part of their service or operation, the LCS Clients may request the
location information of Mobile Station. There may be more than one LCS client.
These may be associated with the core network, associated with the GERAN,
operated as part of a MS application or accessed by the MS through its access
to an application (e.g. through the Internet).
Within the GERAN, the BSC receives authenticated requests for LCS information
from the core network across the A, Gb or Iu interface and passes these to the
SMLC. The SMLC may be a standalone network element or functionality that is
integrated to the BSC. LCS entities then manage the GERAN resources, including
the base station, the LMU, the MS and calculation functions, to estimate the
location of the MS and return the result to the Core Network.

Figure 1: Functional LCS Architecture in GERAN
## 5.1 LCS Operations
The schematic functional description of LCS operations is defined in figure 2.
Upon request from the LCS entities or for internal operations, the GERAN LCS
functional entities will:
\- request measurements, typically from the MS and/or one or more BTS radio
apparatus;
\- send the measurement results to the appropriate calculating function within
GERAN;
\- receive the result from the calculating function within GERAN;
\- send the results to the LCS entities in the core network or to application
entities within GERAN.
In the event that the client is internal to GERAN the request may be made
directly to the GERAN LCS entities as the internal clients are considered to
be \"pre-authorised\".
As part of its operation, the GERAN LCS calculating function may require
additional information. This may be obtained by the function directly by
communication with a database, or it may be through a request to GERAN LCS
entities that will mediate the request and return of information from the
appropriate database (or databases if more than one is needed to fulfil the
requests).
There may possibly also be available independent information that is able to
supply the location information directly, or may be able to supply auxiliary
information to the calculation function. The GERAN LCS co-ordination function,
as part of its activity to supervise the location process, may query the MS or
other elements of the GERAN to determine their capabilities and use this
information to select the mode of operation.
This general operation is outlined in the following (generic) sequence diagram
Figure 2. This figure is not intended to show the complete LCS operation for
GERAN, but to simply to outline the basis for operation. Location measurements
may continually be taken in the background.
{width="5.417361111111111in" height="2.823611111111111in"}
Figure 2: General sequence for LCS operation
## 5.2 High-Level Functions
Several functional groupings may be defined to describe the LCS. These
groupings occur in both the Core Network and the GERAN. The overall LCS
functional grouping is described in the system stage 2, 3GPP TS 23.271. Each
grouping encompasses a number of functional components and functions.
The functions within the GERAN are described in more detail in the following
clauses of the present document.
Within GERAN the functional entities may be grouped as follows:
\- the Internal Client group;
\- the GERAN System Handling group;
\- the Positioning group.
The LCS functional diagram shown in figure 3 depicts the interaction of the
LCS functional entities within the GERAN. The GERAN uses the various LCS
components to provide the target MS Location Information to the internal LCS
client.

Figure 3: GERAN LCS Capability Functional Diagram
### 5.2.1 Co-ordination, Measurement and Calculation Functions
These GERAN functions (including functions in the System handling and
Positioning groups) provide the coâ€‘ordination, measurement and calculation
functions needed to provide a location estimate. The functions interface with
the requesting application and select the appropriate location method and
speed of response. The functions coâ€‘ordinate the operations of the radio and
measurement equipment to transmit the needed signals and to make the needed
measurements. The functions may also access databases or other sources of
information appropriate for the location method. The functions also provide
the calculation functions appropriate for the location method to estimate the
MS location and the accuracy of the report. The functions also may record
information on the usage of the LCS that may be used for administrative
purposes (e.g. forwarded to a billing function in the Core Network). If needed
by the location method, the functions will ensure the broadcast of information
and gather and update information concerning GERAN operating parameters (e.g.
timing of BTS transmissions) needed for LCS operations.
These entities are mainly concerned with the location method, controlling the
radio equipment and performing the calculations to determine the location and
thus may be associated with the SMLC in the GERAN. These functions may receive
location requests from either the core network or from applications internal
to the GERAN.
These functions communicate with the core network across the A, Gb and Iu
interfaces, and with the BTS and LMU and with the MS across the Um interface.
## 5.3 GERAN LCS Functional Entities
### 5.3.1 Internal Client Group
#### 5.3.1.1 Internal GERAN Location Client Function (LCF)
The Location Client Function (LCF) represents a logical interface between the
internal GERAN LCS applications and the LCS BSC Handling entities (e.g. the
Location System Control Function (LSCF) in the BSC).
NOTE: There is not necessarily a requirement for a LCCF (Location Client
Control Function) for the GERAN Internal Client as is described for external
clients in the system stage 2 specification, 3GPP TS 23.271.
The GERAN may make use of location information for internal operations such as
location assisted handover. In such a case, a LCF representing the internal
GERAN LCS application may communicate with the LSCF to request and receive the
location information.
### 5.3.2 GERAN System Handling group
#### 5.3.2.1 GERAN Location System Control Function (LSCF)
The GERAN Location System Control Function is responsible for co-ordinating
location requests. This function manages call-related and non-call-related
location requests and allocates network resources for handling them. This
function \"insulates\" the Location clients in the Core Network from the
detailed operation of the location method in order that the GERAN may be used
by several types of core network and with several location methods.
The LSCF provides flow control between simultaneous location requests.
Simultaneous location requests must be queued in a controlled manner to
account for priority requests (e.g. for Emergency Clients). The details of the
flow control, priority selection and queuing are beyond the scope of the
present document.
The LSCF will select the appropriate location method based on the availability
of resources and parameters of the location request. The LSCF coordinates
resources and activities needed to obtain data (e.g. base station geographic
coordinates) needed for the location method. It also records LCS usage data
for the location service request that may be passed to a Location System
Recording Function (LSRF) or O&M function in the Core Network.
#### 5.3.2.2 GERAN Location System Operations Function (LSOF)
The Location System Operations Function (LSOF) is responsible for provisioning
of data, location capabilities, data related to clients and subscription (LCS
client data and MS data), fault management and performance management of LCS
within the BSC.
An LSOF may be associated with each entity. The LSOF interacts with Internal
(O&M) Clients for administration and maintenance of the data.
#### 5.3.2.3 Location System Broadcast Function (LSBcF)
The Location System Broadcast Function (LSBcF) provides broadcast capability.
The LSBcF capability is only used when broadcast data is required for E-OTD or
A-GNSS positioning methods. Broadcast information (such as the geographic
coordinates of the base stations) may be required, for example, to support a
Position Calculation Function (PCF) located in the mobile station. These
broadcasts may also include other information (such as currently observable
satellites) that may assist a MS in the use of external location services.
The information to be broadcast is selected based on the location techniques
offered for use by the LCS and the needs of the MS. This broadcast information
may be specially coded (i.e. encrypted) to ensure its availability only to
subscribers of the service. The use of broadcasts or other methods for
signalling to the MS may be selected based on the chosen location method.
The information to be broadcast includes for example:
**1\. E-OTD Assistance:**
\- Reference Time;
\- Neighbour Channel Time Slot Scheme;
\- Information about sectored neighbour channels;
\- Neighbour channel 51 Multiframe Offset values;
\- Neighbour channel BCC values;
\- RTD Drift Factor values (ciphered if active);
\- Neighbour channel RTD values (ciphered if active);
\- Serving cell and neighbour cell location information (ciphered if active).
> **2\. A-GNSS Assistance Data:**
\- Broadcasted assistance data may be the same as in A-GNSS point-to-point
signalling.
### 5.3.3 Positioning group
#### 5.3.3.1 GERAN Position Radio Co-ordination Function (PRCF)
The GERAN Position Radio Control Function manages a location request for a MS
through overall co-ordination and scheduling of resources to perform location
measurements. This function interfaces with the PSMF, the PRRM and the PCF.
The PRCF determines the location method to be used based on the location
request, the QoS, the capabilities of the GERAN, and the MS\'s capabilities.
The PRCF also manages the needed radio resources through the PRRM. It
determines which PSMFs are to be involved, what to measure, and obtains
processed signal measurements from the PSMF.
Some location methods may involve measurements made at the MS. In this case
the PRCF interfaces with the MS to obtain the measurements (or the location
results if they have been determined by the MS). Some location methods may
involve measurements or information from several sources, including radio
units at several BTSs and involve a series of transmissions and receptions.
The PRCF entity also provides ancillary measurements in case of network-
assisted location method. Ancillary information may be extracted from
navigating systems like GNSS.
The PRCF forwards the signal measurement data to the PCF.
It is the function of the PRCF to co-ordinate the sequence of activities and
compensate for failures (if they occur) to provide the location estimate.
#### 5.3.3.2 GERAN Position Calculation Function (PCF)
The GERAN Position Calculation Function is responsible for calculating the
location of the MS. This function applies an algorithmic computation on the
collected signal measurements to compute the final location estimate and
accuracy.
The PCF would also be responsible for calculating the speed and bearing of the
MS when reported. This function applies an algorithmic computation on the
collected signal measurements to compute the final velocity estimate and
uncertainty.
It may obtain related data (e.g.: base station geographic coordinates) needed
for the calculation. There may be more than one calculating function available
within, or associated with, the calculation function of the GERAN.
The Position Calculation Function is also responsible for estimating the
accuracy of the location estimate.
#### 5.3.3.3 GERAN Position Signal Measurement Function (PSMF)
The GERAN Position Signal Measurement Function (PSMF) is responsible for
performing and gathering uplink or downlink radio signal measurements for use
in the calculation of a MS\'s location and velocity. These measurements can be
location related or ancillary.
There may be one or more PSMF within a GERAN and they may be located at the MS
or a Location Measurement Unit (LMU). The PSMF, generally, may provide
measurement of signals (i.e. satellite signals) in addition to measurements of
the GERAN radio transmissions. The measurements to be made will depend on the
selected location method.
#### 5.3.3.4 GERAN Position Radio Resource Management (PRRM)
The GERAN Position Radio Resource Management entity is responsible for
managing the effect of LCS operations on the overall performance of the radio
network. This may ensure, for example, that the operation of the PSMF does not
degrade the QoS of other calls.
## 5.4 Assignment of LCS Functional Entities to GERAN Elements
The following Table 1 shows the generic configuration for different location
methods, including network-based, mobile-based, mobile-assisted and network-
assisted methods. With this approach both the network and the mobiles are able
to measure the timing of signals and compute the mobile\'s location and
velocity estimate. Depending on the applied location method it is possible to
utilise the corresponding configuration containing all needed entities. For
instance, if a network-based location method is applied, the entities that are
involved in measuring the mobile\'s signal and calculating its location
estimate are allocated to the network elements of the access network. On the
other hand, in case mobile-based or network-assisted methods are used these
entities should be allocated to the mobile station.

## 5.5 Functional Description of GERAN LCS Network Elements
### 5.5.1 BSC
The BSC receives authenticated requests for LCS information from the CN across
A, Gb and Iu interfaces and passes these to the SMLC.
### 5.5.2 SMLC
The SMLC is either a separate network element of GERAN or integrated
functionality in BSC that contains functionality required to support LCS. The
SMLC manages the overall co-ordination and scheduling of resources required
for the location of a mobile. It also calculates the final location and
velocity estimate and estimates the achieved accuracy. The SMLC may control a
number of LMUs for the purpose of obtaining radio interface measurements to
locate or help locate MS subscribers in the area that it serves. The SMLC is
administered with the capabilities and types of measurement produced by each
of its LMUs.
### 5.5.3 CBC
For Location Services, when a Cell Broadcast Center (CBC) is associated with a
BSC, the SMLC may interface to a CBC in order to broadcast assistance data
using existing cell broadcast capabilities. The SMLC shall behave as a user,
Cell Broadcast Entity, to the CBC (refer to 3GPP TS 23.041).
### 5.5.4 LMU
The LCS Measurement Unit (LMU) entity makes measurements (e.g. of radio
signals) and communicates these measurements to the SMLC (e.g. the PRCF). The
LMU contains a PSMF and may also perform calculations associated with the
measurements. The LMU may make its measurements in response to requests (e.g.
from the SMLC), or it may autonomously measure and report regularly (e.g.
timing of BTS transmissions) or when there are significant changes in radio
conditions (e.g. changes in the RTD). There may be one or more LMUs associated
with the SMLC and an LCS request may involve measurements by one or more LMUs.
LMU functionality may be integrated in a BTS.
An LMU makes radio measurements to support one or more positioning methods;
these assistance measurements are specific to all MSs in a certain geographic
area. All location and assistance measurements obtained by an LMU are supplied
to the SMLC associated with the LMU. Instructions concerning the timing, the
nature, and any periodicity of these measurements are either provided by the
SMLC or are pre-administered in the LMU.
The following assistance measurement obtained by an LMU has a generic status
usable by more than one position method:
\- Radio Interface Timing measurements -- comprise Absolute Time Differences
(ATDs) or Real Time Differences (RTDs) of the signals transmitted by Base
Stations, where timing differences are measured relative to either some
absolute time difference (ATD) or the signals of another Base Station (RTD).
### 5.5.5 MS
The MS interacts with the measurement co-ordination functions to make
measurements of downlink signals. The measurements to be made will be
determined by the chosen location method.
The MS may also contain LCS applications, or access an LCS application through
communication with a network accessed by the MS or an application residing in
the MS and/or satellite signals. The MS may include the needed measurement and
calculation functions to determine the MS\'s location with or without
assistance of the GERAN LCS entities.
# 6 Signalling Protocols and Interfaces
## 6.1 Protocol layering in A/Gb mode
### 6.1.1 Generic Signalling Model
Figure 4 shows the generic signalling model applicable to LCS for signalling
interaction in which an SMLC forms at least one of the signalling end points.
{width="5.459027777777778in" height="3.0006944444444446in"}
Figure 4: Generic Model for LCS Signalling to an SMLC
The functions performed by each protocol layer are as follows:
a) LCS application protocol -- this depends on the other signalling end point
(e.g. whether a target MS or LMU) and may be absent if supported in the BSSAP-
LE layer. The application protocol supports specific LCS functions (e.g.
positioning measurements, assistance measurements) and is independent of lower
protocol layers.
b) BSSAP-LE -- this is an extension of BSSAP and carries the LCS application
protocol signaling units. Necessary functions include identification of the
LCS application protocol and identification, where not provided by the network
layer, of the two end points. This layer can be relayed by an intermediate
entity or mapped into an equivalent layer 3 protocol used by the other
signaling end point. This layer supports segmentation of LCS application layer
protocols.
c) Network Layer -- provides signaling transport between the SMLC and either
the other end point or some intermediate entity at which the BSSAP-LE layer is
relayed or mapped. The network layer may support connection oriented or
connectionless signaling. For second generation circuit oriented applications,
the network layer is provided using either MTP or M3UA/SCTP and SCCP. This
layer supports segmentation of LCS application layer protocols.
d) Physical Layer -- When MTP is used as transport protocol, SS7 signaling
links are supported by the physical layer. It is recommended that when IP
transport (via M3UA/SCTP) is used, the data link layer is implemented using
Ethernet. A node using IP transport having interfaces connected via low
bandwidth PPP links like E1/T1 shall also support IP Header Compression [37]
and the PPP extensions ML/MC-PPP [38], [39]. In this case, the negotiation of
header compression [37] over PPP shall be performed according to [40].
e) L3 -- a protocol layer compatible with or the same as BSSAP-LE.
f) L2 -- logical link layer for the other endpoint
> g) L1 -- physical layer for the other end point.
### 6.1.2 Message Segmentation in A/Gb mode
Message segmentation is needed to transport any large LCS message that exceeds
the message size limitation supported by any GSM interface over which
transport is needed.
#### 6.1.2.1 Network Level Segmentation
Segmentation and reassembly of large SMLCPP messages at the network (e.g.
SCCP) level may be supported. For message transfer over any interface where
network level segmentation is not supported, segmentation at the application
level shall be used. This may require support of both network and intermediate
level segmentation by certain intermediate entities.
#### 6.1.2.2 Intermediate Level Segmentation
The segmentation of SMLCPP 3GPP TS 48.031[19], messages is supported by
segmentation mechanisms defined in 3GPP TS 48.008 [18], and 3GPP TS
49.031[22]. The sending, receiving and all intermediate entities supporting
segmentation shall ensure reliable and sequenced delivery of the message
segments by appropriate use of the capabilities supported by lower transport
and network level protocols.
For support of legacy (Rel4 and older) MS and GERAN, there are segmentation
mechanisms defined in the RR layer (3GPP TS 44.018 [14]) and BSSAP-LE layer
(3GPP TS 49.031 [22]) for segmentation of RRLP (3GPP TS 44.031) messages,
which need to be supported by the MS, BSS, and SMLC in the uplink direction in
the CS domain and by the MS and BSS for the downlink direction in the CS
domain.
#### 6.1.2.3 RRLP Pseudo-Segmentation
The use of several RRLP messages to deliver a large amount of information is
called \"RRLP pseudo-segmentation\". If more information than what fits in the
RRLP maximum PDU size needs to be delivered, the RRLP pseudo-segmentation
shall be used. (For Rel 4 or older MS and GERAN, may also use intermediate
level segmentation).
### 6.1.3 Signalling between an SMLC, MSC and BSC
An SMLC can either be separate logical entity or integrated functionality in
the BSC. If the SMLC is a separate logical entity, the LCS signalling between
SMLC and MSC is accomplished through the A and Lb interfaces. If the SMLC is
integrated, the LCS signalling is accomplished through the A interface only.
Figure 5 shows the protocol layers used to support LCS signaling between the
SMLC, MSC and BSC.

Figure 5: Signalling Protocols between SMLC, MSC and BSC
### 6.1.3a Signalling between an SMLC, SGSN and BSS
An SMLC can either be separate logical entity or integrated functionality in
the BSS. If the SMLC is a separate logical entity, the LCS signalling between
SMLC and SGSN is accomplished through the Gb and Lb interfaces. If the SMLC is
integrated, the LCS signalling is accomplished through the Gb interface only.
Figure 5a shows the protocol layers used to support LCS signaling between the
SMLC, SGSN and BSS. Notice that the Network Service layer may be based on
frame relay or IP (see 3GPP TS 48.016 [24]).

### 6.1.4 Signaling between SMLC and MS
SMLC Signalling to a target MS is accomplished through the Um interface.
Figure 6 shows the protocol layers used to support signaling between an SMLC
and target MS in the CS domain.

Figure 6: Signalling between an SMLC and Target MS in CS domain
Figure 6a shows the protocol layers used to support signaling between an SMLC
and target MS in the PS domain. The signalling is routed through the core
network to utilize standard GPRS functions. BSSGP is specified in 3GPP TS
48.018 [25] and RLC/MAC is specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 [28]. The TOM and LLC
protocols are specified in 3GPP TS 44.064 [26]. The TOM Protocol Header for
RRLP is specified in 44.031 [15]. For an overview of GPRS, see 3GPP TS 23.060
[27].

NOTE*: The network layer for the Gb interface may be based on IP or frame
relay.

### 6.1.5 SMLC Signalling to a Type A LMU
Notice that the signalling to a Type A LMU is using CS signalling over the Um
interface. A Type A LMU can be used to support positioning of mobile stations
both in the CS and the PS domain.
#### 6.1.5.1 Circuit Switched Signalling using an SDCCH
Figure 7 shows the protocol layers used to support signaling between an SMLC
and a Type A LMU, using an SDCCH on the Um interface.

#### 6.1.5.2 Signalling using a TCH
Figure 8 shows the protocol layers that can be used to support signaling
between an SMLC and a Type A LMU using a TCH on the Um interface. The TCH is
assumed to support either transparent or non-transparent synchronous data and
may be provided in a multislot configuration. The main usage would be for O&M
data and SW download -- e.g. during offpeak hours.

### 6.1.6 SMLC signalling to a Type B LMU
The protocol layers employed to enable signaling between the SMLC and a Type B
LMU are shown in figure 9. Notice that the signalling to a Type B LMU can be
used to support positioning of mobile stations both in the CS and the PS
domain.

### 6.1.7 SMLC Signalling to a peer SMLC
The protocol layers used for SMLC to SMLC signalling are shown in figure 10,
where it is assumed that both SMLCs have connections to an intermediary
signalling network (or there is a direct link between the SMLCs).
{width="5.822916666666667in" height="2.546527777777778in"}
Figure 10: SMLC to SMLC Signalling via an intermediary signalling network
In the absence of either a direct link or links to an intermediary signalling
network, signalling can go via attached BSCs and MSCs as shown in figure 11
for signalling between the SMLCs sharing the same MSC.

## 6.2 Protocol layering in Iu mode
### 6.2.1 Signalling between SMLC and MSC/SGSN
A SMLC can either be a separate logical entity or integrated functionality in
the BSC. If the SMLC is a separate logical entity, the LCS signalling between
SMLC and MSC/SGSN is accomplished through the Iu and Lb interfaces. If the
SMLC is integrated, the LCS signalling is accomplished through the Iu
interface only. Figure 11a shows the protocol layers used to support LCS
signaling between the SMLC, BSC and MSC/SGSN.
{width="5.775in" height="3.216666666666667in"}
NOTE: * Iu protocol stack is inherited from UMTS specifications [29-32]. See
GERAN Stage 2 specification [11] for additional transport layer options.

### 6.2.2 Signalling between SMLC and MS
SMLC Signalling to a target MS is accomplished through the Um interface.
Figure 11b shows the protocol layers used to support signaling between an SMLC
and target MS.
{width="6.5in" height="3.8069444444444445in"}
Figure 11b: Signalling between an SMLC and Target MS
### 6.2.3 SMLC signalling to a Type A LMU
The signalling to a Type A LMU is defined using A/Gb Mode CS signalling over
the Um interface, see Clause 6.1.5. A Type A LMU operating in A/Gb Mode CS
Domain can be used to support positioning of mobile stations operating in Iu
Mode. Signalling to a Type A LMU in Iu Mode is FFS.
### 6.2.4 SMLC signalling to a Type B LMU
The signalling to a Type B LMU is defined in Clause 6.1.6. A Type B LMU
operates independently of the mode of the MS (A/Gb Mode or Iu Mode) and
signalling to a Type B LMU as defined in Clause 6.1.6 can be used to support
positioning of mobile stations operating in Iu Mode.
### 6.2.5 SMLC signalling to a peer SMLC
The signalling to a peer SMLC is defined in Clause 6.1.7. A peer SMLC
connection and signaling is independent of the mode of the MS (A/Gb Mode or Iu
Mode) and signalling to a peer SMLC as defined in Clause 6.1.7 can be used to
support positioning of mobile stations operating in Iu Mode.
# 7 GERAN Network Location Procedures
## 7.1 State description for SMLC
### 7.1.1 SMLC States
#### 7.1.1.1 NULL State
This is a conceptual rather than actual state in which a certain location
request from a particular Location Client, VMSC, SGSN or BSC either has not
yet been received or has been completed.
#### 7.1.1.2 LOCATION State
This state exists after the SMLC has received a location request from a BSC
and persists while the SMLC is obtaining position measurements for a
particular positioning method until such time as positioning measurements have
been received and a location estimate (with optional velocity estimate) has
been computed and returned to the BSC.
When sufficient positioning measurement results have been received, the SMLC
either evaluates them, if they include an already computed location estimate,
or uses them to compute a location estimate. The SMLC then has the option of
either reinitiating another positioning attempt, e.g. if the location estimate
did not satisfy the required QoS and the requirement on response time permits
another position attempt, or returning the location estimate to the BSC.
### 7.1.2 State Functionality
#### 7.1.2.1 State Transitions
{width="5.998611111111111in" height="3.216666666666667in"}
Figure 12: State Transitions in the SMLC
**Moving from NULL to LOCATION state:** After a location request is received
from the BSC, the SMLC enters the LOCATION state. It then chooses a
positioning method and initiates the appropriate position measurements.
**Moving from LOCATION to NULL state:** When the SMLC has obtained a location
estimate that best meets the requested QoS parameters, it returns this to the
BSC and re-enters the NULL state.
#### 7.1.2.2 LOCATION Timer Function
The SMLC runs a timer while in the LOCATION state to limit the total amount of
time that positioning can be active. This timer should be related to any
response time indicated in the location request QoS parameters. If the timer
expires before a final location estimate has been produced, the SMLC either
returns the best existing location estimate (with optional velocity estimate)
to the BSC (e.g. an estimate based on the current cell ID) or returns a
failure indication. It then re-enters the NULL state.
## 7.2 State Description for the BSC
### 7.2.1 BSC States
#### 7.2.1.1 IDLE State
In this state, the BSC location service is inactive for a particular MS.
#### 7.2.1.2 LOCATION State
In this state, the BSC is awaiting a response from an SMLC after requesting
the location for a particular MS. In this state, a Radio Resource connection
to the target MS will be active -- allowing the SMLC and MS to exchange
positioning related messages for mobile based and mobile assisted position
methods. For certain position methods (e.g. network based position methods),
the SMLC may invoke substates in the BSC during which other types of
association or procedure are supported with the MS (e.g. temporary call
establishment, handover). In this state, the BSC may transfer positioning
related messages between the SMLC and the target MS and/or between the SMLC
and certain LMUs served by the BSC.
### 7.2.2 State Functionality
#### 7.2.2.1 State Transitions
{width="6.730555555555555in" height="3.415277777777778in"}
Figure 13: State Transitions in the BSC
**Moving from IDLE to LOCATION state:** After a request has been received to
locate a particular MS served by the BSC, a location request is sent to the
SMLC associated with the serving cell: the BSC then enters the LOCATION state.
Before entering this state, a Radio Resource connection to the MS must have
been already established by the VMSC.
**Moving from LOCATION to IDLE state:** After the return of a location
estimate result from the SMLC, the BSC shall re-enter IDLE state.
#### 7.2.2.2 LOCATION Timer Function
The BSC runs a timer while in the LOCATION state to limit the amount of time
waiting for a location response from the SMLC. If the timer expires before
such information is received, the BSC indicates a location failure to the
original requesting entity and re-enters IDLE state.
## 7.3 Usage of SCCP Connection on the Lb interface in the CS domain in A/Gb
mode
SCCP connection oriented signalling between an SMLC and a BSC is used to
support SMLC signalling to a Type A LMU, a serving BSC, or a target MS. The
types of SCCP connections are described below.
### 7.3.1 SCCP Connection for positioning of a target MS
The BSC establishes this connection when a request is received for a location
estimate for a target MS in the CS domain. The BSC sends the BSSAP-LE Perform
Location Request to the SMLC inside an SCCP Connection Request message.
Signaling between the SMLC and target MS, if required, is then relayed by the
BSC between this SCCP connection and the main signaling link to the MS. The
same SCCP connection is also used to transfer BSSLAP messages between the SMLC
and serving BSC. See Figure 14.
{width="4.134027777777778in" height="2.267361111111111in"}
Figure 14: SCCP based signalling for MS positioning with an SMLC in CS domain
### 7.3.2 SCCP connection to access a Type A LMU
The BSC or SMLC establishes this connection to enable LCS messages to be
transferred to or from a Type A LMU. The BSC or SMLC sends a BSSAP-LE LMU
Connection Request message inside an SCCP Connection Request message.
Signaling is subsequently relayed through the BSC using this SCCP connection
as shown in figure 15.
{width="4.0256944444444445in" height="1.8340277777777778in"}
Figure 15: SCCP based signalling to access a Type A LMU with an SMLC
## 7.4 Usage of SCCP Connection on the Lb interface in the PS domain in A/Gb
mode
SCCP connection oriented signalling between an SMLC and a BSS is used to
support SMLC signalling to a serving BSS or a target MS. The types of SCCP
connections are described below.
### 7.4.1 SCCP Connection for positioning of a target MS
The BSS establishes this connection when a request is received for a location
estimate for a target MS in the PS domain. The BSS sends the BSSAP-LE Perform
Location Request to the SMLC inside an SCCP Connection Request message.
Signaling between the SMLC and target MS is then relayed by the BSS via the
SGSN to the MS. The same SCCP connection is also used to transfer BSSLAP
messages between the SMLC and serving BSS. See figure 15a below. RRLP Messages
between the SMLC and the MS are carried in BSSGP Position Command/Response
messages (see 3GPP TS 48.018) across the Gb interface and in TOM messages in
LLC UI frames (see 3GPP TS 44.064 [26]) across the Um interface. Because a
connectionless mode of communication is used to transport BSSGP and LLC, an MS
identity is included in each message for those protocols.

# 8 Common Procedures to Support Positioning
The procedures described in this clause enable an SMLC to obtain positioning
related information or instigate positioning for a particular target MS. The
procedures are applicable to all positioning methods after an SMLC receives a
BSSAP-LE Perform Location request for a target MS until a BSSAP-LE Perform
Location response is returned to the originator.
## 8.1 Information Transfer between an SMLC and a Target MS in the CS Domain
in A/Gb mode for E-OTD and A-GNSS positioning methods
An SMLC uses the procedure shown below in order to obtain the MS position or
positioning measurements from a target MS or transfer location assistance
information to a target MSin the CS domain after a request has been received
from the BSC serving the target MS. More details of the location information
transfer procedure between the BSC and MS can be found in 3GPP TS 24.008.
{width="3.8006944444444444in" height="2.1590277777777778in"}
Figure 16: Information Transfer between an SMLC and a Target MS in CS domain
1) The SMLC passes a BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message to the
serving BSC containing an embedded BSSLAP MS Position Command with an RRLP
message parameter. The message is transferred using the SCCP connection
established between the SMLC and BSC for positioning the target MS If the
BSSLAP message is too large to fit in a single BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented
Information message, RRLP pseudoâ€‘segmentation shall be used. Legacy SMLC may
utilize BSSAP-LE layer segmentation instead of RRLP pseudo-segmentation. The
SMLC shall indicate in the first BSSLAP MS Position Command whether the
embedded RRLP message contains a positioning command versus positioning
assistance data.
2) The BSC transfers the embedded RRLP message to the target MS inside an RR
Application Information message. No later than when the RR Application
Information message has been transferred, the BSC shall start a positioning
supervision timer if none is already in progress or restart this if already in
progress. If the timer expires before the final response in step 3 is
received, the BSC shall return a BSSAP-LE Connection oriented Information
message to the SMLC containing a BSSLAP Abort with a cause of BSC timeout.
3) When the target MS has positioning information to return to the SMLC, it
sends an RR Application Information message to the BSC containing an embedded
RRLP message. If the RRLP message is too large to fit in a single RR
Application Information message, RRLP pseudo-segmentation shall be used.
Legacy MS may utilize RR layer segmentation instead of RRLP pseudo-
segmentation. . The last RR Application Information message shall indicate if
this is the final response from the MS.
4) If the timer started in step 2 has already expired, the BSC discards the
RRLP message received in step 3. Otherwise, the BSC forwards the RRLP message
to the SMLC inside a BSSLAP MS Positioning Response message contained in a
BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message. If the SMLC indicated a
positioning command in step 1 and the MS has indicated a final response, the
BSC may add additional measurement information to the BSSLAP MS Position
Response in the last BSSAP-LE message -- if necessary, creating a new BSSAP-LE
message if message size limitations would be exceeded. The BSC shall stop the
supervision timer started in step 2 when the final segment of the final
response from the MS has been transferred. If the MS did not indicate a final
response in step 3, the SMLC may transfer a further RRLP message to the MS
(e.g. containing assistance data) according to steps 1 and 2 and the MS may
return a subsequent response according to steps 3 and 4.
## 8.1a Information Transfer between an SMLC and a Target MS in the PS Domain
in A/Gb mode
An SMLC uses the procedure shown below in order to obtain the MS position or
positioning measurements from a target MS or transfer location assistance
information to a target MS in the PS domain after a request has been received
from the BSS serving the target MS.
{width="5.0in" height="3.0in"}
Figure 16a: Information Transfer between an SMLC and a Target MS in PS Domain
1) The SMLC passes a BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message to the
serving BSS containing an embedded BSSLAP MS Position Command with an RRLP
message parameter. The message is transferred using the SCCP connection
established between the SMLC and BSS for positioning the target MS. If the
RRLP message is larger than the RRLP maximum PDU size, RRLP pseudo-
segmentation shall be used. The SMLC shall indicate in the positioning command
bit in the RRLP flags IE in the BSSLAP MS Position Command whether the
embedded RRLP message contains a positioning command versus a non-command --
e.g. positioning assistance data.
```{=html}
``` 2) The BSS relays the embedded RRLP message and the RRLP flags IE to the
SGSN inside a BSSGP Position Command message. When the BSSGP Position Command
message has been transferred, the BSS shall start a positioning supervision
timer if not already in progress or restart if the timer is already in
progress. If the timer expires before the final response in step 5 is
received, the BSS shall return a BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented Information
message to the SMLC containing a BSSLAP Abort with a cause of BSS timeout.
3) The SGSN receives the RRLP message in the BSSGP Position Command message
and relays it to the MS in an LLC UI frame. The TOM protocol with SAPI TOM8 is
used for transfer of RRLP messages. The positioning command bit from the RRLP
flags IE in the BSSGP message is also relayed using the C/R bit in the TOM
header (see 3GPP TS 44.031 [15]). The received C/R bit may be ignored by the
MS or used for implementation purposes.
4) When the target MS has positioning information to return to the SMLC, it
sends an LLC UI Frame to the SGSN containing an embedded RRLP message. The TOM
protocol is used for transfer of RRLP messages. If the RRLP message is larger
than the RRLP maximum PDU size, RRLP pseudo-segmentation shall be used. If the
RRLP pseudo-segmentation is used, the MS shall send several RRLP messages. In
each message the MS shall indicate in the C/R bit in the TOM protocol header
whether it is the final response or not. The final response shall be the last
RRLP message that the MS expects to send in response to RRLP messages received
so far from the SMLC. In the final message the MS shall indicate that it is
the final response by setting the appropriate RRLP flag.
5) The SGSN relays the RRLP message to the BSS. The RRLP message is sent in a
BSSG Position Response message. The C/R bit from the TOM header is relayed
using the final response bit in the RRLP flags IE in the BSSGP message.
6) If the timer started in step 2 has already expired, the BSS discards the
RRLP message received in step 5. Otherwise, the BSS relays the RRLP message
and the RRLP flags IE to the SMLC inside a BSSLAP MS Positioning Response
message contained in a BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message. If
the SMLC indicated a positioning command in the most recent message to be
transferred in step 1 and the MS has indicated a final response, the BSS may
add additional measurement information to the BSSLAP MS Position Response in
the last BSSAP-LE message. The BSS shall stop the supervision timer started in
step 2 when the final response from the MS has been transferred. The SMLC may
transfer a further RRLP message to the MS (e.g. containing assistance data or
a positioning command) according to steps 1, 2, and 3 and the MS may return a
subsequent response according to steps 4, 5, and 6. Steps 4-6 are repeated if
the RRLP pseudo-segmentation is used for the uplink message.
## 8.1b Information Transfer between an SMLC and a Target MS in Iu Mode
An SMLC uses the procedure shown below in order to obtain the MS position or
positioning measurements from a target MS or transfer location assistance
information to a target MS after a request has been received from the BSC
serving the target MS. More details of the location information transfer
procedure between the BSC and MS can be found in 3GPP TS 44.118.
{width="3.8006944444444444in" height="2.1590277777777778in"}
Figure 16b: Information Transfer between an SMLC and a Target MS
1) The SMLC passes a BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message to the
serving BSC containing an embedded BSSLAP MS Position Command with an RRLP
message parameter. The message is transferred using the SCCP connection
established between the SMLC and BSC for positioning the target MS If the
BSSLAP message is too large to fit in a single BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented
Information message, RRLP pseudoâ€‘segmentation shall be used. The SMLC shall
indicate in the first BSSLAP MS Position Command whether the embedded RRLP
message contains a positioning command versus positioning assistance data.
2) The BSC transfers the embedded RRLP message to the target MS inside an RRC
LCS DL Information message. No later than when the RRC LCS DL Information
message has been transferred, the BSC shall start a positioning supervision
timer if none is already in progress or restart this if already in progress.
If the timer expires before the final response in step 3 is received, the BSC
shall return a BSSAP-LE Connection oriented Information message to the SMLC
containing a BSSLAP Abort with a cause of BSC timeout.
3) When the target MS has positioning information to return to the SMLC, it
sends an RRC LCS UL Information message to the BSC containing an embedded RRLP
message. If the RRLP message is too large to fit in a single RRC LCS UL
Information message, RRLP pseudo-segmentation shall be used. The last RRC LCS
UL Information message shall indicate if this is the final response from the
MS.
4) If the timer started in step 2 has already expired, the BSC discards the
RRLP message received in step 3. Otherwise, the BSC forwards the RRLP message
to the SMLC inside a BSSLAP MS Positioning Response message contained in a
BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message. If the SMLC indicated a
positioning command in step 1 and the MS has indicated a final response, the
BSC may add additional measurement information to the BSSLAP MS Position
Response in the last BSSAP-LE message -- if necessary, creating a new BSSAP-LE
message if message size limitations would be exceeded. The BSC shall stop the
supervision timer started in step 2 when the final response from the MS has
been transferred. If the MS did not indicate a final response in step 2, the
SMLC may transfer a further RRLP message to the MS (e.g. containing assistance
data) according to steps 1 and 2 and the MS may return a subsequent response
according to steps 3 and 4.
## 8.2 Information Transfer between an SMLC and a BSC
An SMLC uses the procedure shown below in order to obtain positioning related
information from the BSC serving a particular target MS after a positioning
request has been received from the BSC. This procedure applies to positioning
of an MS in both the CS and the PS domains.
{width="2.7645833333333334in" height="1.3395833333333333in"}
Figure 17: Information Transfer between an SMLC and a BSC
1) The SMLC passes a BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message to the
BSC containing an embedded BSSLAP message. The BSSAP-LE message is transferred
using the SCCP connection previously established between the SMLC and BSC when
the positioning request for the target MS was initially sent to the SMLC. The
BSC recognizes that it is the final destination due to the presence of the
embedded BSSLAP message.
2) When the BSC has positioning information for the target MS to return to the
SMLC, it sends a BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message to the SMLC
containing an embedded BSSLAP message. The message is sent using the SCCP
connection previously established for positioning the target MS.
## 8.3 Common Procedures to Support Access to an LMU
The procedures in this clause support the transfer of positioning related
information and O&M data between an SMLC and a particular LMU associated with
the SMLC. These procedures apply to positioning of an MS in both the CS and
the PS domains.
### 8.3.1 Location Update Procedure between an SMLC and a Type A LMU
The following procedure supports a normal location update from the perspective
of a Type A LMU. The location update can occur periodically, on power up,
following recovery from some failure condition and when an LMU in idle mode
detects that its closest BTS is in another location area.
{width="3.5027777777777778in" height="2.2944444444444443in"}
Figure 18: Location Update Procedure between an SMLC and a Type A LMU
1) If the LMU does not currently have a signaling link, it sends an RR Channel
Request to the serving BTS to request a SDCCH. The RR Channel Request contains
an establishment cause identifying an LMU. After assignment of the SDCCH, the
LMU sends a DTAP Location Updating request to the BSC. This shall indicate
that a follow on request is pending if the LMU has more data to send.
2) Because the BSC serving the LMU is associated with an SMLC and the Channel
Request message contained an LMU establishment cause, the BSC forwards the
Location Updating request to the SMLC rather than MSC. If there was previously
no SDCCH, this is sent inside a BSSMAP Complete Layer 3 Information message
that is contained in an SCCP Connection Request.
3) The SMLC performs normal authentication and ciphering if needed for the
LMU. The SMLC shall not assign a TMSI to the LMU to avoid duplicating a TMSI
assigned to a normal MS by a VLR.
4) The SMLC returns a DTAP Location Updating Accept to the BSC. Unless the LMU
indicated a follow on request, the SMLC may then initiate release of the
SDCCH.
5) The BSC forwards the DTAP message to the LMU.
### 8.3.2 IMSI Detach Procedure between an SMLC and a Type A LMU
The following procedure supports a normal IMSI Detach from the perspective of
a Type A LMU. This may be instigated if the LMU is to be deactivated -- e.g.
for offline maintenance.
{width="3.5027777777777778in" height="1.2493055555555554in"}
Figure 19: IMSI Detach Procedure between an SMLC and a TypeA LMU
1) If the LMU does not currently have a signaling link, it sends an RR Channel
Request to the serving BTS to request a SDCCH. The RR Channel Request contains
an establishment cause identifying an LMU. After assignment of the SDCCH, the
LMU sends a DTAP IMSI Detach Indication to the BSC.
2) Because the BSC serving the LMU is associated with an SMLC and the Channel
Request message contained an LMU establishment cause, the BSC forwards the
IMSI Detach Indication to the SMLC rather than MSC. If there was previously no
SDCCH, this is sent inside a BSSAP Complete Layer 3 Information message that
is contained in an SCCP Connection Request. The SMLC marks the LMU as
temporarily inactive and initiates release of the SDCCH.
### 8.3.3 LCS Information Transfer between an SMLC and a Type A LMU
#### 8.3.3.1 Information Transfer using an SDCCH
The following procedure supports information transfer between an SMLC and a
Type A LMU.
{width="3.8493055555555555in" height="5.257638888888889in"}
Figure 20: Information Transfer between an SMLC and a Type A LMU
1) If there is no signaling link yet for an LMU between the SMLC and the BSC
serving the LMU, the SMLC sends a BSSAP Paging message to the serving BSC
inside an SCCP Unitdata message.
2) The serving BSC broadcasts an RR Paging Request.
3) The LMU sends a Channel Request message containing an LMU establishment
cause to request an SDCCH. After assignment of the SDCCH, the LMU returns an
RR Paging Response.
4) Because the BSC serving the LMU is associated with an SMLC and the Channel
Request message in step 3 contained an LMU establishment cause, the BSC
transfers the Paging Response to the SMLC, rather than MSC, in a BSSAP
Complete Layer 3 Information message contained in an SCCP Connection Request.
5) The SMLC performs normal authentication and ciphering if this is needed for
the LMU. The SMLC shall not assign a TMSI to the LMU to avoid duplicating a
TMSI assigned to a normal MS by a VLR.
6) If the SMLC needs to send data to the LMU, it may send one or more DTAP-LE
REGISTER, FACILITY or RELEASE COMPLETE messages to the BSC. Each DTAP-LE
message contains an embedded LLP message and an indication of whether release
of the SDCCH by the LMU is forbidden. Each DTAP-LE message is transferred by
the BSC to the LMU.
7) The SMLC may initiate release of the SDCCH to the LMU by sending a BSSAP
Clear Command to the BSC.
8) The BSC returns a BSSAP Clear Complete.
9) The BSC orders release of the SDCCH by sending an RR Channel Release to the
LMU.
10) The SMLC releases the SCCP connection to the BSC by sending an SCCP
Released message.
11) When the LMU has LCS data to send and does not currently have a signaling
link, it sends an RR Channel Request to the serving BTS to request an SDCCH.
The RR Channel Request contains an establishment cause identifying an LMU.
After assignment of the SDCCH, the LMU sends a DTAP CM Service request to the
serving BSC.
12) Because the BSC serving the LMU is associated with an SMLC and the Channel
Request message contained an LMU establishment cause, the BSC forwards the CM
Service Request with an indication that this came from an LMU to the SMLC,
rather than MSC, inside a BSSAP Complete Layer 3 Information message that is
contained in an SCCP Connection Request.
13) The SMLC performs authentication and ciphering if needed for the LMU.
Otherwise, a CM Service Accept is returned. The SMLC shall not assign a TMSI
to the LMU to avoid duplicating a TMSI assigned to a normal MS by a VLR.
14) The LMU sends one or more DTAP-LE REGISTER, FACILITY or RELEASE COMPLETE
messages to the serving BSC each containing an embedded LLP message. The BSC
forwards each DTAP-LE message to the SMLC.
#### 8.3.3.2 Information Transfer using a TCH
{width="3.5027777777777778in" height="5.043055555555555in"}
Figure 21: Information Transfer between an SMLC and a Type A LMU using a TCH
1) The SMLC establishes a signaling connection to the LMU using an SDCCH.
2) The SMLC sends a DTAP Setup to the LMU with the requested bearer
capability.
3) The LMU returns a DTAP Call Confirmed.
4) The SMLC initiates traffic channel assignment by sending a BSSAP Assignment
Request to the BSC.
5) The BSC requests channel activation in the BTS and then sends an RR
Assignment Command to the LMU.
6) The LMU acknowledges TCH assignment.
7) The BSC confirms TCH assignment.
8) The LMU confirms call establishment.
9) The SMLC acknowledges the LMU confirm.
10) DTAP-LE Connection Oriented Information messages are transferred between
the SMLC and LMU on the established TCH: these are transparent to the BSC.
11) The SMLC initiates release of the TCH by sending a DTAP Disconnect to the
LMU
12) The LMU returns a DTAP Release.
13) The SMLC sends a DTAP Release Complete.
14) The SMLC initiates release of the TCH by sending a BSSAP Clear Command to
the BSC.
15) The BSC returns a BSSAP Clear Complete.
16) The BSC orders release of the TCH by sending an RR Channel Release to the
LMU.
17) The SMLC releases the SCCP connection to the BSC by sending an SCCP
Released message.
### 8.3.4 LCS Information Transfer between an SMLC and a Type B LMU
A SMLC uses the procedure shown below in order to exchange LCS information
with a TypeB LMU.
{width="3.9680555555555554in" height="2.0256944444444445in"}
Figure 22: Information Transfer between a SMLC and a Type B LMU
1) The SMLC passes a BSSAP-LE Connectionless Information message to the BSC
containing an embedded LLP message and the LAC/CI cell address identifying the
LMU. The BSSAP-LE message is transferred inside an SCCP Unitdata message.
2) The BSC transfers the embedded LLP message to either the BTS associated
with the LMU or the LMU itself inside a Location Information message. The BTS
or LMU is identified using the LAC/CI received in step 1.
3) When the LMU has positioning information to return to the SMLC, either it
or its associated BTS transfers this to the BSC inside a Location Information
message..
4) The serving BSC forwards the LLP message to the SMLC inside a BSSAP-LE
Connectionless Information message contained in an SCCP Unitdata message. The
BSSAP-LE message contains the LAC/CI address identifying the LMU.
## 8.4 Common Control Procedures for LMUs
These procedures are applicable to any Type A LMU and may be used for any Type
B LMU to enable control of the LMU by its associated SMLC. The procedures
assume support for the establishment of a signaling link and the transfer of
LLP messages between an SMLC and LMU that are defined in the common procedures
to support access to an LMU, clause 8.3. Consequently, details of signaling
link establishment and message transfer by a BSC and BTS are not shown.
### 8.4.1 Reset Procedure
The reset procedure enables an SMLC to return an LMU to a known initial state
in which no measurement or O&M operations are outstanding or being performed.
{width="6.2034722222222225in" height="1.2208333333333334in"}
Figure 23: Reset Procedure for a Circuit Mode LMU
1) After first establishing a signaling connection to the LMU (see clause
8.3), the SMLC sends an LLP Reset Invoke to the LMU via BSC.
2) The LMU cancels any LCS measurement and O&M tasks previously ordered by the
SMLC. The LMU then returns an LLP Reset Return Result to the SMLC.
### 8.4.2 Status Query Procedure
The Status Query procedure enables an SMLC to verify the status of an
associated LMU. The procedure may be instigated periodically or following any
loss of communication with the LMU.
{width="6.0159722222222225in" height="1.0673611111111112in"}
Figure 24: Status Query Procedure for a Circuit Mode LMU
1) After first establishing a signaling connection to the LMU (see clause
8.3), the SMLC sends an LLP Status Query Invoke to the LMU via BSC.
2) The LMU returns an LLP Status Query return result, indicating the number of
active measurement jobs for each type of measurement (e.g. RIT) and the number
of active O&M jobs in the LMU that were previously ordered by the SMLC.
### 8.4.3 Status Update Procedure
The Status Update procedure enables an LMU to report status information to its
associated SMLC. The procedure may be instigated for the following reasons:
1\. Periodically;
2\. Power-on condition or recovery from failure with loss of memory;
3\. Impending availability or unavailability for O&M reasons;
4\. Location Update by a Type A LMU in a new Location Area.
Figure 25: Status Update Procedure for a Circuit Mode LMU
1) After first establishing a signaling connection to the SMLC (see clause
8.3), the LMU sends an LLP Status Update Invoke to the SMLC via BSC. This
message shall include the reason for the Status Update, the number of active
and outstanding jobs of each category in the LMU and the current hardware
status.
2) The SMLC returns an LLP Status Update return result to acknowledge receipt
of the Status Update.
## 8.5 Exception Procedures
The procedures in this clause apply to all location procedures where a BSSAP-
LE Perform Location Request has been sent to an SMLC by a BSC requesting some
location service (e.g. provision of a location estimate for a target MS or
transfer of assistance data to a target MS).
### 8.5.1 Procedures in the SMLC
When a request for a location estimate fails due to failure of a position
method itself (e.g. due to inaccurate or insufficient position measurements
and related data) and the SMLC is unable to instigate another positioning
attempt (e.g. due to a requirement on response time), the SMLC may return a
BSSAP-LE Perform Location response containing a less accurate location
estimate (e.g. based on serving cell and timing advance). If a less accurate
estimate is not available, the SMLC shall instead return a BSSAP-LE Perform
Location response message containing no location estimate and indicating the
cause of failure.
When a request for any other location service (e.g. transfer of assistance
data to a target MS) fails for any reason and the SMLC is unable to reattempt
the service, the SMLC shall return a BSSAP-LE Perform Location response
message indicating the cause of failure.
When a location service request is interrupted by some other unrecoverable
error event inside the SMLC, the SMLC shall immediately terminate the location
service attempt and return a BSSAP-LE Perform Location Response message
containing the reason for the location service cancellation. In that case, any
dialogue previously opened with an LMU or BSS for the purpose of instigating
position measurements for any MS being located may also be aborted by the
SMLC.
If the SMLC receives a BSSAP-LE Perform Location Abort indication for a
previous location service request from the BSS, it shall immediately terminate
the location service attempt and may abort any dialogues used for the location
service attempt that may still exist with any LMUs. The circumstances of the
abort may still ensure cancellation of any such procedure (see clause on BSS).
For a BSSAP-LE Perform Location Abort, the SMLC shall then either return any
location estimate (with optional velocity estimate) already derived, if this
was requested, or return a BSSAP-LE Perform Location response indicating
failure of the location service and the cause of the failure in the BSSAP-LE
Perform Location Abort.
If the SMLC has instigated any location related procedure in the Target MS or
its serving BSS and receives a BSSLAP Reject, BSSLAP Abort or BSSLAP Reset
indication from the BSS, it shall cancel the location service attempt and may
abort any dialogues for this that currently exist with any LMUs. For a BSSLAP
Abort, the SMLC shall then either return any location estimate (with optional
velocity estimate) already derived, if this was requested and is sufficient
for the requested QoS, or return a BSSAP-LE Perform Location response
indicating failure of the location service and the cause of the failure in the
BSSLAP Abort. For a BSSLAP Reject and BSSLAP Reset, the SMLC has the
additional option of restarting the location service attempt and using the
same or a different position method where a location estimate was requested. A
decision to restart the location service shall take into account the cause of
the location service failure as conveyed in the BSSLAP Reject or BSSLAP Reset
and whether, in the case of successful intra-BSC handover, the new cell for
the target MS is still associated with the SMLC. If the SMLC receives a BSSLAP
Reject or BSSLAP Reset with a cause indicating intra-BSC handover and with a
new cell identity for the target MS that is not associated with the SMLC, the
SMLC shall return a BSSAP-LE Perform Location response containing either a
location estimate (with optional velocity estimate), if requested and
available, or a failure cause indicating \"intra-BSC\" handover.
NOTE: In the CS domain, in the case of an intra-BSC handover to a cell in a
different PLMN (different MCC, MNC combination), the SMLC may receive a BSSLAP
Reset containing the new location area code and new cell ID. The SMLC may then
deduce the new MCC and MNC from the uniqueness, when this applies, of the
combined values for the new location area code and cell ID compared to the
corresponding values for neighbouring cells.
### 8.5.2 Procedures in an LMU
An LMU shall return an error indication to its controlling SMLC when location
measurements previously ordered by the SMLC cannot be provided due to any
error condition.
### 8.5.3 Procedures in the BSC in the CS Domain
#### 8.5.3.1 General Procedures
The BSC serving a target MS shall supervise any network or MS location service
procedure, including transfer of positioning assistance data to an MS, and
shall only allow one such procedure to be active at any time. If a new
procedure is instigated by the SMLC for any target MS, the BSC shall cancel
any previous procedure without notifying the SMLC or target MS. The new
procedure shall then be treated according to the prevailing conditions. If a
location information transfer to an MS initiated by an SMLC is not active, the
BSC shall discard any RRLP message received from the MS. This precludes the
initiation of any location service procedure from an MS.
The BSC may optionally allow one A-GNSS or E-OTD positioning procedure and one
Cell-based or U-TDOA positioning procedure to be active concurrently for the
same target MS. The BSC shall indicate the second independent location
procedure is supported when SMLC instigates a first positioning procedure for
any MS. The SMLC may initiate the concurrent positioning procedure only in
when the BSC has indicated this capability. The BSC may disallow the
concurrent positioning procedure at any time.
In the concurrent positioning procedure, if the SMLC invokes a first A-GNSS or
E-OTD location procedure and then invokes a second A-GNSS or E-OTD then the
BSC shall cancel the first procedure and proceed with the second without
notifying the SMLC or target MS. In the concurrent location procedure, if the
SMLC invokes a first cell-based or U-TDOA location procedure and then invokes
a second cell-based or U-TDOA location procedure then the BSC shall cancel the
first procedure and proceed with the second positioning procedure without
notifying the SMLC or target MS.
Depending on the location procedure and its current state of execution, a
serving BSC may chose to defer certain radio related events (e.g. handover) to
avoid interference with location -- refer to the later clauses for each
positioning procedure. A serving BSC shall abort all existing location related
procedures for a particular target MS without notifying a target MS if the
DCCH to the target MS or the SCCP connection to the SMLC is released. In the
event of an abort with an SMLC, the BSC shall attempt to notify the SMLC using
a BSSAP-LE Perform Location Abort.
#### 8.5.3.2 Rejection of an SMLC Positioning Request
The BSC may reject any request from an SMLC for positioning or transfer of
assistance data for a target MS if the request cannot be performed for reasons
other than interaction with handover or other RR management. If the request is
rejected, the BSC shall return a BSSLAP Reject to the SMLC containing the
cause of rejection.
#### 8.5.3.3 Interaction with Inter-BSC Handover
The BSC shall reject any request from an SMLC for positioning or transfer of
assistance data while an inter-BSC handover procedure is ongoing and shall
return a BSSLAP Abort to the SMLC.
The BSC shall terminate any network or MS positioning procedure or any
transfer of RRLP assistance data already in progress if inter-BSC handover is
needed and is not precluded by the particular location procedure and its
current state. When a location procedure is terminated and there is an active
BSSLAP transaction, the BSC shall return a BSSLAP Abort message to the SMLC
after the BSSAP Handover Required has been sent to the serving MSC. The BSSLAP
Abort shall contain the cause of the location procedure failure. When a
location procedure is terminated and there is no active BSSLAP transaction,
the BSC shall send a BSSAP-LE Perform Location Abort message to the SMLC after
the BSSMAP Handover Required has been sent to the serving MSC.
#### 8.5.3.4 Interaction with Intra-BSC Handover and other RR Management
Procedures
The BSC shall reject any request from an SMLC for positioning or transfer of
assistance data while an intra-BSC handover or other intra-BSC RR management
procedure involving the target MS is ongoing and shall return a BSSLAP Reset
to the SMLC when the handover or other RR management procedure is complete in
the BSC. If the handover or other RR management procedure times out in the
BSC, the BSC shall instead return either a BSSLAP Reset or a BSSLAP Abort to
the SMLC.
The BSC shall terminate any network or MS positioning procedure or any
transfer of RRLP assistance data already in progress if an intra-BSC handover
or other intra-BSC RR management procedure is needed and is not precluded by
the particular location procedure and its current state. When location
procedure is terminated, the BSC shall return a BSSLAP Reset message to the
SMLC after the intra-BSC handover or other RR management procedure is complete
in the BSC. If the intra-BSC handover or other RR management procedure times
out in the BSC, the BSC shall instead return either a BSSLAP Reset or a BSSLAP
Abort to the SMLC.
A BSSLAP Reset shall contain a cause indication, the current serving cell
identity, the current location area code if this has just changed due to
intra-BSC handover and may contain measurement information for the target MS
(e.g. TA value). A BSSLAP Reset shall also include the current location area
code if there has been any change of location area since the location request
for the target MS was first sent to the SMLC and if the current location area
code was not yet reported to the SMLC in a previous BSSLAP Reset.
#### 8.5.3.5 Priority of Handover and Other RR Management Procedures
If the transfer of RRLP messages between an SMLC and target MS is interrupted
by intra-BSC handover, inter-BSC handover or any other intra-BSC RR management
procedure, the BSC shall avoid delay to the handover or RR management
procedure by employing the preemption capability defined in 3GPP TS 44.006 and
3GPP TS 24.008. This allows an RR Handover Command or other RR management
command sent to the target MS to be assigned a \"high\" priority at the data
link level enabling preemption of \"low\" priority RR Application Information
messages (carrying RRLP messages) which may have been sent earlier. This
procedure ensures that any RRLP data still not transmitted to the MS will be
preempted (and discarded) by the data link layer in the BTS prior to
transmission of the Handover Command or other RR Management command.
#### 8.5.3.6 Interaction with Segmentation support for Legacy MS
If a location information transfer to an MS initiated by an SMLC is not
active, the BSC shall discard any RRLP message segment received from the MS.
Once a location service procedure has been started involving RRLP message
transfer to a target MS, the BSC shall discard all RRLP segments received from
the MS until it receives the first or only segment of a new RRLP message. The
new RRLP message shall then be treated according to the state of the RRLP
message transfer as described in clause 8.1.
Further details regarding transfer and segmentation of RRLP messages between a
BSC and MS can be found in 3GPP TS 44.018.
#### 8.5.3.7 Overload
The BSC may indicate an inability to support location due to overload by
rejecting with a cause indicating congestion a BSSAP Perform Location request
received from the MSC. If an SMLC has rejected a request from the BSC to
perform location with a cause indicating congestion, the BSC shall convey the
rejection and cause to the MSC if the request was MSC initiated. If the
request was initiated by the BSC, the BSC may reduce the frequency of its
location requests to the SMLC according to the rules in 3GPP TS 49.031, which
give precedence to location service requests with a higher priority.
### 8.5.4 Procedures in the BSS in the PS Domain
#### 8.5.4.1 General Procedures
The BSS serving a target MS shall supervise any network or MS location service
procedure, including transfer of positioning assistance data to an MS, and
shall only allow one such procedure to be active at any time for any one TLLI.
If a new procedure is instigated by the SMLC for any target MS, the BSS shall
cancel any previous procedure without notifying the SMLC or target MS. The new
procedure shall then be treated according to the prevailing conditions. If a
location information transfer to an MS initiated by an SMLC is not active, the
BSS shall discard any RRLP message received from the MS via the SGSN.
The BSC may optionally allow one A-GNSS or E-OTD positioning procedure and one
Cell-based or U-TDOA positioning procedure to be active concurrently for the
same target MS. The BSC shall indicate the second independent location
procedure is supported when SMLC instigates a first positioning procedure for
any MS. The SMLC may initiate the concurrent positioning procedure only in
when the BSC has indicated this capability. The BSC may disallow the
concurrent positioning procedure at any time.
In the concurrent positioning procedure, if the SMLC invokes a first A-GNSS or
E-OTD location procedure and then invokes a second A-GNSS or E-OTD then the
BSC shall cancel the first procedure and proceed with the second without
notifying the SMLC or target MS. In the concurrent location procedure, if the
SMLC invokes a first cell-based or U-TDOA location procedure and then invokes
a second cell-based or U-TDOA location procedure then the BSC shall cancel the
first procedure and proceed with the second positioning procedure without
notifying the SMLC or target MS.
A serving BSS shall abort all existing location related procedures for a
particular target MS without notifying a target MS if the SCCP connection to
the SMLC is released. In the event of an abort when no BSSLAP procedure is
active, but a location procedure is active, the BSS shall attempt to notify
the SMLC using a BSSAP-LE Perform Location Abort.
A serving BSS shall abort all existing location related procedures for a
particular target MS if the radio connection to the MS is lost. The SMLC shall
be notified with a BSSAP-LE Perform Location Abort if no BSSLAP procedure is
currently active. If there is an active BSSLAP procedure, the BSSLAP Abort
message shall be sent to the SMLC.
A serving BSS shall return a BSSLAP Reject to the SMLC containing the cause of
rejection, if the BSS receives the BSSGP Position Response message from the
SGSN indicating a failure.
#### 8.5.4.2 Rejection of an SMLC Positioning Request
The BSS may reject any request from an SMLC for positioning or transfer of
assistance data for a target MS if the request cannot be performed. If the
request is rejected, the BSS shall return a BSSLAP Reject to the SMLC
containing the cause of rejection.
#### 8.5.4.3 Overload
The BSS may indicate an inability to support location due to overload by
rejecting with a cause indicating congestion sent in a BSSGP Perform Location
Response message to the SGSN. If an SMLC has rejected a request from the BSS
to perform location with a cause indicating congestion, the BSS shall convey
the rejection and cause to the SGSN if the request was initiated by the SGSN.
If the request was initiated by the BSS, the BSS may reduce the frequency of
its location requests to the SMLC according to the rules in 3GPP TS 49.031,
which give precedence to location service requests with a higher priority.
#### 8.5.4.4 Inter BSS Cell Change
If the BSS detects (e.g. when it receives a BSSGP-FLUSH-LL PDU from the SGSN)
that a target MS has changed cell to another BSS, it shall abort the
positioning procedure by sending the BSSAP-LE Perform Location Abort to the
SMLC.
### 8.5.5 Void
## 8.6 Procedures in the Target MS
A target MS shall terminate any positioning procedure or the transfer of RRLP
positioning assistance data without sending any response to the SMLC if any RR
message is received from the BSC that starts some other RR management
procedure, including a new positioning procedure. The new RR procedure shall
then be executed by the MS.
A target MS shall terminate any positioning procedure or the transfer of RRLP
positioning assistance data without sending any response to the SMLC if a
Routing Area Update Request message is sent to the SGSN or if a suspension
request message is sent to the network or if its P-TMSI is reallocated.
## 8.7 Further Procedures for Handover
Handover procedures are described in 3GPP TS 23.271 [7].
# 9 Positioning procedures
The following clause describes the positioning procedures for Timing Advance,
Enhanced Observed Time Difference and A-GNSS.
## 9.1 Positioning Procedure Initiation
### 9.1.1 Core Network Position Procedure Initiation over the A interface
This procedure is used by the Core Network to start the positioning procedure
in GERAN over the A interface.

Figure 26: Positioning Procedure Initiation Over A Interface
1) The MSC sends the BSSAP Perform Location Request message on the existing
SCCP connection for the target MS to request the BSC to start the positioning
procedure. The Location Type is always included. Depending on the type of
location request, additional parameters may be included to provide the Cell
Identifier, Classmark Information Type 3, LCS Client Type, Chosen Channel, LCS
Priority, Quality of service, A-GNSS Assistance Data, and APDU. In addition,
the IMSI and / or the IMEI of the mobile station involved in the positioning
procedure may be provided by the MSC in order, if forwarded by the BSC, to
allow the SMLC to maintain a context between subsequent requests for a mobile
station, to tune positioning for each mobile station and to add more options
for SMLC diagnostics.
2) The common positioning procedures for CS domain are executed (see below).
3) The BSC sends the BSSAP Perform Location Response message to the MSC. A
location estimate, velocity estimate, positioning data, deciphering keys, or
LCS Cause may be included.
### 9.1.2 Positioning Procedure Initiation from an Internal LCS Client for the
CS Domain (A/Gb mode)
Figure 27 illustrates how a serving BSC may obtain the location of a target MS
that is already in dedicated mode on behalf of some PLMN operator LCS client
in GERAN -- e.g. to support handover. The procedure is valid when local
regulatory requirements do not require privacy checking for PLMN operator
initiated location.
{width="5.635416666666667in" height="2.9097222222222223in"}

1) An LCS client within the GERAN requests the current location of a target MS
from the serving BSC
2) The common positioning procedures for CS domain are executed see Figure 28.
The BSC returns the MS location estimate to the requesting LCS client.
### 9.1.3 Core Network Position Procedure Initiation over the Gb interface
This procedure is used by the Core Network to start the positioning procedure
in GERAN over the Gb interface.
{width="3.7319444444444443in" height="1.8659722222222221in"}
Figure 27a: Positioning Procedure Initiation Over Gb Interface
1) The SGSN sends the BSSGP Perform Location Request message to request the
BSS to start the positioning procedure. The TLLI, IMSI, DRX Parameters,
Current BVCI for the MS, Current NSEI for the MS, Location Type, Current Cell
Identifier, and LCS Capability IEs are always included. The IMSI, DRX
Parameters, Current BVCI for the MS, Current NSEI for the MS shall be stored
in the SCCP signalling context towards the SMLC for potential use in a TA
Request procedure later on. Depending on the type of location request,
additional parameters may be included in the BSSGP Perform Location Request
message to provide LCS Client Type, LCS Priority, LCS Quality of Service, and
A-GNSS Assistance Data. In addition, the IMEI of the mobile station involved
in the positioning procedure may be provided by the SGSN. The IMSI and, if
forwarded by the BSS, the IMEI, would allow the SMLC to maintain a context
between subsequent requests for a mobile station, to tune positioning for each
mobile station and to add more options for SMLC diagnostics.
2) The common positioning procedures for PS domain are executed (see clause
9.2.1).
3) The BSS sends the BSSGP Perform Location Response message to the SGSN. The
TLLI and the BVCI identifying the cell from which the last LLC PDU was
received from the MS are always included. A location estimate, velocity
estimate, positioning data, deciphering keys, or LCS Cause may be included.
### 9.1.4 Positioning Procedure Initiation from Core Network (Iu mode)
This procedure is used by the Core Network to start the positioning procedure
in GERAN Iu mode. This procedure is used when the source node in the Core
Network is the 3G-MSC (Iu-cs interface) or when the source node in the Core
Network is the 3G-SGSN (Iu-ps interface).
{width="3.7319444444444443in" height="1.8659722222222221in"}
Figure 27b: Positioning Procedure Initiation from Core Network (Iu mode)
1) The MSC/SGSN sends the Location Reporting Control message on the existing
SCCP connection for the target MS to request the BSC to start the positioning
procedure. The Location Type is always included. Depending on the type of
location request, additional parameters may be included to provide LCS Client
Type, LCS Priority, Quality of service, and A-GNSS Assistance Data..
2) The Positioning Procedure for Iu mode is executed (see below).
3) The BSC sends the Location Report message to the MSC/SGSN. A location
estimate (with optional velocity estimate), or LCS Cause may be included.

FFS.
## 9.2 Common Positioning Procedure for CS Domain in A/Gb mode
This procedure is common to all positioning methods in the CS domain.
{width="3.7319444444444443in" height="1.8659722222222221in"}
Figure 28: Common Positioning Procedure for CS Domain
1) The BSC sends the BSSAP-LE Perform Location Request message to request the
SMLC to start the positioning procedure. The Location Type and Current Cell
Identifier IEs are always included. Depending on the type of location request,
additional parameters may be included to provide Measurement Report (in BSSLAP
APDU IE), LCS Client Type, Classmark Information Type 3, Chosen Channel, LCS
Priority, LCS Quality of Service, and A-GNSS Assistance Data. In addition, the
IMSI and / or the IMEI of the mobile station involved in the positioning
procedure may be provided by the BSC in order to allow the SMLC to maintain a
context between subsequent requests for a mobile station, to tune positioning
for each mobile station and to add more options for SMLC diagnostics.
2) If location information is requested and the location accuracy within the
QoS, if provided, can be satisfied by the reported cell ID and, if available,
TA value, the SMLC may send a BSSAP-LE Perform Location Response message
immediately. Otherwise, the SMLC determines the positioning method and
instigates the particular message sequence for this method defined in
subsequent clauses. If the position method returns position measurements, the
SMLC uses them to compute a location estimate (with optional velocity
estimate). If there has been a failure to obtain position measurements, the
SMLC may use the current cell ID and, if available, TA value to derive an
approximate location estimate. If a computed location estimate is returned for
an MS based position method, the SMLC may verify consistency with the current
cell ID and, if available, TA value. If the location estimate so obtained does
not satisfy the requested accuracy or the location attempt failed, e.g. due to
missing data, and sufficient response time still remains, the SMLC may
instigate a further location attempt using the same (e.g. providing more
assistance data to MS) or a different position method. If there is
insufficient response time for another position attempt, the SMLC shall return
any location estimate already obtained even if not satisfying the requested
accuracy. If a vertical location co-ordinate is requested but the SMLC can
only obtain horizontal co-ordinates, these may be returned. Requirements on
the geographic shape encoded within the 'position information' parameter may
exist for certain LCS client types. The SMLC shall comply with any shape
requirements defined in 3GPP. The SMLC in a certain country should attempt to
comply with the shape requirements defined for a specific LCS client type in
the relevant national standards of that country. If location assistance data
is requested, the SMLC transfers this data to the MS as described in
subsequent clauses. The SMLC determines the exact location assistance data to
transfer according to the type of data specified by the MS, the MS location
capabilities and the current cell ID. If deciphering keys are requested the
SMLC obtains the current keys.
3) The SMLC sends the BSSAP-LE Perform Location Response message to the BSC
containing any location estimate (with optional velocity estimate) or
deciphering keys. In case of failure the cause value may be included.
## 9.2a Common Positioning Procedure for PS Domain in A/Gb mode
This procedure is common to all positioning methods in the PS domain.
{width="3.7319444444444443in" height="1.8659722222222221in"}
Figure 28a: Common Positioning Procedure for PS Domain
1) The BSS sends the BSSAP-LE Perform Location Request message to request the
SMLC to start the positioning procedure. The Location Type, and Current Cell
Identifier IEs are always included. If the Timing Advance value for the MS is
available in the BSS, it shall be included (in BSSLAP APDU IE). Depending on
the type of location request, additional parameters may be included to provide
Measurement Report (in BSSLAP APDU IE), Packet Measurement Report, LCS Client
Type, LCS Capability, LCS Priority, LCS Quality of Service, and A-GNSS
Assistance Data. In addition, the IMSI and / or the IMEI of the mobile station
involved in the positioning procedure may be provided by the BSS in order to
allow the SMLC to maintain a context between subsequent requests for a mobile
station, to tune positioning for each mobile station and to add more options
for SMLC diagnostics.
2) See step 2 of clause 9.2 \"Common Positioning Procedure for CS Domain in
A/Gb mode\".
3) The SMLC sends the BSSAP-LE Perform Location Response message to the BSS. A
location estimate, velocity estimate, positioning data, deciphering keys, or
LCS Cause may be included.
## 9.2b Common Positioning Procedure for Iu mode
This procedure is common to all positioning methods in the Iu mode.
{width="3.7319444444444443in" height="1.8659722222222221in"}
Figure 28b:Common Positioning Procedure
1\. The BSC sends the BSSAP-LE Perform Location Request message to request the
SMLC to start the positioning procedure.

3\. The SMLC sends the BSSAP-LE Perform Location Response message to the BSC
containing any location estimate (with optional velocity estimate) or
deciphering keys. In case of failure the cause value may be included.
## 9.2c GPRS Cell Change for the PS Domain in A/Gb mode
### 9.2c.1 Intra-BSS Cell Change
The procedure shown below is used in order to keep an SMLC updated about
Intra-BSS cell changes during a positioning procedure for a target MS in the
PS domain in A/Gb-mode (note that unlike the CS domain and handover, the
BSSLAP reset procedure is not used). The following procedure is applicable
except when U-TDOA positioning is ongoing in the BSS as described in sub-
clause 9.5.2.4 of this specification.
{width="5.5in" height="3.0in"}
Figure 28c: Cell Change with BSSAP-LE Perform Location Information for the PS
Domain
1\. The MS detects a cell change and sends a cell update message or routing
area update message to the SGSN (for more information, see 3GPP TS 23.060).
2\. The SGSN sends a BSSGP FLUSH-LL PDU to the BSS. If the cell change is an
Inter-NSE Cell Change, the NSEI of the new cell is provided.
3\. The BSS acknowledges by sending a BSSGP FLUSH-LL-ACK PDU to the SGSN.
> 4\. The BSS detects that a positioning procedure is active and the BSS is

> included. The BSS may send this message either if it receives the indication
> from the SGSN about the cell change (the BSSGP FLUSH-LL) or if it detects
> the cell change on its own (e.g. network controlled cell reselection).
### 9.2c.2 Inter-BSS Cell Change
The procedure shown below is used to abort the positioning procedure when an
Inter-BSS cell change occurs for a target MS in the PS domain in A/Gb-mode.
The following procedure is applicable except when U-TDOA positioning is
ongoing in the BSS as described in sub-clause 9.5.2.5 of this specification.
{width="5.5in" height="3.0in"}
Figure 28d: Cell Change with positioning abort for the PS Domain
1\. The MS detects a cell change and sends a cell update message or routing
area update message to the SGSN (for more information, see 3GPP TS 23.060).
2\. The SGSN sends a BSSGP FLUSH-LL PDU to the BSS. The NSEI of the new cell
is provided.
3\. The BSS acknowledges by sending a BSSGP FLUSH-LL-ACK PDU to the SGSN.
4\. The BSS detects that a positioning procedure is active and that the BSS is
not able to continue the positioning procedure in the new cell (e.g. Inter BSS
Cell Change) and sends a BSSAP-LE Perform Location Abort message to the SMLC.
The IE LCS Cause indicates the reason for the abort (e.g. "Inter BSS Cell
Change"). The BSS then awaits the BSSAP-LE Perform Location Response from the
SMLC, which it will forward in a BSSGP Perform Location Response to the SGSN.
## 9.3 TA Based Positioning in CS Domain for A/Gb-mode
The TA is based on the existing Timing Advance (TA) parameter. The TA value is
known for the serving BTS. To obtain TA values in case the MS is in idle mode
a special call, not noticed by the GSM subscriber (no ringing tone), is set
up. The cell-ID of the serving cell and the TA is returned as the result of
the TA.
### 9.3.1 Definition of TA states
#### 9.3.1.1 MS in IDLE State
In IDLE state the MS may be paged or may request an originating (e.g.
emergency) call. The paging response message or CM Service Request, in each
case respectively, received in COMPLETE_LAYER_3 message may contain location
information that includes the TA value. If available, the TA value and other
location information shall be provided to the SMLC by the requesting BSC along
with the current serving cell ID in the BSSAP-LE Perform Location request.
This enables TA based positioning in the SMLC without any further
interactions.
#### 9.3.1.2 MS in DEDICATED State
In DEDICATED state the SMLC shall send a TA_REQUEST to request the TA value
from the serving BSC. The BSC shall respond with either a TA_RESPONSE carrying
the TA value and possibly other radio measurements from the MS or a Reset. The
associated procedure is described in the next clause.
### 9.3.2 TA Positioning Procedure
This TA positioning procedure is generic for a standalone SMLC or integrate
SMLC in the BSC.
{width="3.3444444444444446in" height="1.3444444444444446in"}
Figure 29: TA Positioning Procedure for the SMLC in the CS Domain
1) The SMLC sends a BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message to the
BSC serving a particular target MS. The APDU parameter in this message
contains a BSSLAP TA Request.
2) Provided the location area for the target MS has not changed or, if
changed, was previously reported to the SMLC, the BSC returns the current TA
value and current serving cell for the target MS to the SMLC in a BSSLAP TA
response contained within a BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message.
The TA response may also include the latest measurement results received from
the target MS for the serving and neighbouring cells. If the location area for
the target MS has changed since the location request was first sent to the
SMLC and if the new location area has not yet been reported to the SMLC, the
BSC shall return a BSSLAP Reset to the SMLC within a BSSMAP-LE Connection
Oriented Information message. The Reset shall include the current serving
cell, the current location area code, a cause value indicating "intra-BSC
handover" and the current TA value and may include the latest measurement
results received from the target MS for the serving and neighboring cells. The
SMLC then derives a location estimate for the target MS based on the received
serving cell ID, location area code if included, TA value and other
measurement results if included.
NOTE: In the case of a previous intra-BSC handover to a cell in a different
PLMN (different MCC, MNC combination), the SMLC would receive a BSSLAP Reset
containing the new location area code and new cell ID. The SMLC may then
deduce the new MCC and MNC from the uniqueness, when this applies, of the
combined values for the new location area code and cell ID compared to the
corresponding values for neighbouring cells.
### 9.3.3 Unsuccessful TA positioning procedure in BSC
There are three messages defined to handle error scenarios during positioning
procedure in BSC. The messages are 1) Reject, 2) Abort and 3) Reset. Refer to
3GPP TS 48.071 [21] for details.
After receiving the BSSLAP TA Request in BSC, a Reject will be sent with
proper cause value from BSC to SMLC in \"BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented
Information Message\" if TA positioning cannot be performed in BSC at that
time for reasons other than handover or another ongoing RR management
procedure.
An Abort or Reset is possible if the TA positioning cannot be done in BSC
during that time. Reset is sent to SMLC to indicate when the positioning needs
to be restarted after temporary interruption due to intra BSC HO or other
intra-BSC RR management. The contents of a Reset shall be as defined in step 2
in section 9.3.2. Abort is used to indicate to SMLC the failure of the current
TA positioning attempt (e.g. due to inter-BSC handover) and allowing a new one
from application level.
## 9.3a TA Based Positioning in PS Domain for A/Gb-mode
The TA is based on the existing Timing Advance (TA) parameter. The TA value is
known for the serving BTS. To obtain TA values in case the MS is in packet
idle mode and the value is not available in the BTS signalling is used to
retrieve it. The cell-ID of the serving cell and the TA is returned as the
result of the TA procedure.
If available, the TA value shall be provided to the SMLC by the requesting BSS
in the BSSAP-LE Perform Location request. This enables TA based positioning in
the SMLC without any further interactions. The current serving cell ID shall
always be provided by the BSS to the SMLC.
### 9.3a.1 Definition of PS Domain TA Modes
#### 9.3a.1.1 MS in Packet Idle Mode
When the BSS receives a TA Request message and the MS is in Packet Idle Mode
and the TA value is not available in the BSS, the MS may be paged or may be
sent a Packet Polling Request message. If there is a PBCCH allocated in the
current cell, the BSS will send a Packet Polling Request message to the MS. If
there is no PBCCH allocated in the current cell, the BSS will perform packet
paging (sends a Paging Request Type 1, 2, or 3 message) for the MS.
The paging response message or Packet Control Acknowledgement message will
provide the TA value to the BSS and this will be provided to the SMLC,
possibly together with other radio measurements from the MS, in the TA
Response message. The associated procedure is described below.
#### 9.3a.1.2 MS in Packet Transfer Mode
When the BSS receives a TA Request message and the MS is in Packet Transfer
Mode and the TA value is not available in the BSS the MS shall be sent a
Packet Polling Request message to the MS.
The Packet Control Acknowledgement message will provide the TA value to the
BSS and it will be provided to the SMLC, possibly together with other radio
measurements from the MS, in the TA Response message. The associated procedure
is described in the next clause.
### 9.3a.2 TA Positioning Procedure
This TA positioning procedure is generic for a standalone SMLC or integrate
SMLC in the BSS.
{width="3.73125in" height="2.3944444444444444in"}
Figure 29a: TA Positioning Procedure for the SMLC in the PS Domain
1) If the SMLC has not already received the TA Value in the BSSAP-LE Perform
Location Request message, the SMLC sends a BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented
Information message to the BSS serving a particular target MS. The APDU
parameter in this message contains a BSSLAP TA Request.
2) If the TA value is available in the BSS, the BSS immediately returns it in
step 4, otherwise the BSS either performs a packet paging procedure or sends a
Packet Polling Request message (for details, see clause 9.5.1).
> 2a) If there is no PBCCH allocated in the current cell and the MS is in
> Packet Idle Mode, the BSS will perform packet paging (sends a Paging Request
> Type 1, 2, or 3 message) for the MS.
>
> 2b) If there is a PBCCH allocated in the current cell or the MS is in Packet
> Transfer Mode, the BSS will send a Packet Polling Request message to the MS.
3) The MS responds to the BSS.
3a) If the MS receives the packet paging it will send a page response.
3b) If the MS receives a Packet Polling Request message it will return a
Packet Control Acknowledgement message.
4) The BSS returns the current TA value and current serving cell for the
target MS to the SMLC in a BSSLAP TA response contained within a BSSAP-LE
Connection Oriented Information message. The TA response may also include the
latest measurement results received from the target MS for the serving and
neighbouring cells. The SMLC then derives a location estimate for the target
MS based on the received serving cell ID, TA value and other measurement
results if included.
### 9.3a.3 Unsuccessful TA positioning procedure in BSS
There are three messages defined to handle error scenarios during positioning
procedure in BSS. The messages are 1) Reject, 2) Abort and 3) Reset. Refer to
3GPP TS 48.071 [21] for details. The Reset message does not apply for PS
domain.
After receiving the BSSLAP TA Request in BSS, a Reject will be sent with
proper cause value from BSS to SMLC in \"BSSAP-LE Connection Oriented
Information Message\" if TA positioning cannot be performed in BSS at that
time for reasons other than handover or another ongoing RR management
procedure.
An Abort is possible if the TA positioning cannot be done in the BSS during
that time. Abort is used to indicate to SMLC the failure of the current TA
positioning attempt (e.g. due to reception of an BSSGP_Perform_Location_Abort
from the SGSN) and allowing a new one from application level.
## 9.4 E-OTD and A-GNSS Positioning Procedures
### 9.4.1 General procedures
For any location request where the highest priority level is assigned and MS-
based A-GNSS positioning is not used, the SMLC functionality shall provide
sufficient assistance data to a target MS to enable a location estimate,
velocity estimate, or location measurements to succeed according to the
required QoS on the first attempt. The SMLC shall not assume in this case that
the target MS already possesses assistance data. For a lower priority location
request or when MS-based A-GNSS positioning is used, the SMLC may reduce the
assistance data provided to a target MS on the first location attempt.
In the high priority case with MS-assisted GNSS for the first positioning
attempt, acquisition assistance data shall be included in the RRLP measure
position request message.
### 9.4.2 Positioning Request
This signaling flow is generic for all MS based or assisted location methods
(MS Based E-OTD, MS Assisted E-OTD, MS Based A-GNSS, and MS Assisted A-GNSS).
The signaling flow below applies to integrated and standalone SMLCs in a
circuit switched network.
If the SMLC desires to avoid lower layer (e.g. BSSAP-LE) segmentation, see
clause 6.1.2, and transfer the LCS assistance data more reliably, this
procedure may be preceded by an \"Assistance Data Delivery\" procedure. Note,
that part of the entire set of assistance data may be included in the RRLP
Measure Position Request even when the message is preceded by an \"Assistance
Data Delivery\" procedure.
If the MS has indicated support for providing MS positioning capabilities
using RRLP in the MS Classmark 3 IE for GSM (see 3GPP TS 24.008), in the PS
LCS Capability IE for GERAN Gb mode (see 3GPP TS 24.008), or in the MS
Positioning Capability IE for GERAN Iu mode (see 3GPP TS 44.118), this
procedure may be preceded by a "Positioning Capability Transfer" procedure.
Figure 30: E-OTD or A-GNSS Position Request Flow
1) The SMLC may precede the RRLP MEASURE POSITION REQUEST or Assistance Data
Delivery procedure with a Position Capability Transfer procedure, if the MS
supports the transfer of MS positioning capabilities using RRLP.
2) The SMLC may precede the RRLP MEASURE POSITION REQUEST with an optional
Assistance Data Delivery procedure.
3) The SMLC determines possible assistance data and sends RRLP MEASURE
POSITION REQUEST to the BSC.
4) The BSC forwards the positioning request including the QoS and any
assistance data to the MS in a RRLP MEASURE POSITION REQUEST.
5) The MS performs the requested E-OTD or GNSS measurements, if needed
assistance data is available in the MS. If the MS is able to calculate its own
location and this is required and needed assistance data is available in MS,
the MS computes a location estimate based on E-OTD or GNSS measurements. In
case of E-OTD, any data necessary to perform these operations will either be
provided in the RRLP MEASURE POSITION REQUEST or available from broadcast
sources. In case of A-GNSS (both MS based and MS assisted) and first
positioning attempt, a minimum set of A-GNSS assistance data will be either
provided in the RRLP MEASURE POSITION REQUEST or available from broadcast
sources. For further positioning attempt (failure in first attempt due to
missing assistance data), sufficient A-GNSS assistance data, possibly
excluding the assistance data sent in the first attempt, will be provided in
the RRLP MEASURE POSITION REQUEST and possibly preceding RRLP ASSISTANCE DATA
messages. The resulting E-OTD or GNSS measurements or E-OTD or GNSS location
estimate (with optional velocity estimate) are returned to the BSC in a RRLP
MEASURE POSITION RESPONSE. If the MS was unable to perform the necessary
measurements, or compute a location, a failure indication identifying the
reason for failure (e.g. missing assistance data) is returned instead. In case
of A-GNSS, if the MS was unable to compute a location, the GNSS measurements
are also optionally returned if allowed by the network. If the RRLP message is
larger than the RRLP maximum PDU size, several RRLP MEASURE POSITION RESPONSE
messages are sent (i.e. the RRLP pseudo-segmentation is used).
6) BSC forwards the RRLP MEASURE POSITION response to SMLC.
### 9.4.3 Assistance Data Delivery
This signalling flow is generic for MS Based and MS Assisted E-OTD, and MS
Based or MS Assisted A-GNSS in a circuit switched network.
If the SMLC desires to avoid lower layer (e.g. BSSAP-LE) segmentation and
transfer the LCS assistance data more reliably, the sequence 1-4 illustrated
in the figure below may be repeated several times to deliver more assistance
data than can be sent by one RRLP Assistance Data Delivery message. In this
case, each individual message is independent such that the data received in
one message is stored in the MS independently of the other RRLP Assistance
Data messages (i.e. an error of delivery of one message does not require a
retransmission of all the RRLP Assistance Data messages). The SMLC shall
indicate in the RRLP ASSISTANCE DATA message if more RRLP ASSISTANCE DATA
messages will be used after the current one in order to deliver the entire set
of assistance data. Data that is specific to the current cell should be sent
in the last message this is recommended so that assistance data for the
correct cell is available to the MS after a handover.
{width="4.783333333333333in" height="2.854861111111111in"}
Figure 31: E-OTD or A-GNSS Assistance Data Delivery Flow
1) The SMLC determines assistance data and sends it in the RRLP ASSISTANCE
DATA message to the BSC.
2) The BSC forwards the assistance data to the MS in a RRLP ASSISTANCE DATA
message.
3) The MS acknowledges the reception of complete assistance data to the BSC
with a RRLP ASSISTANCE DATA Ack.
4) The BSC forwards the RRLP ASSISTANCE DATA Ack message to the SMLC.
### 9.4.3a Positioning Capability Transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the SMLC to obtain the positioning
capabilities of the MS, the types of assistance supported and the types of
assistance data that may be needed from the SMLC. MS support for this
procedure can be indicated to the SMLC using the MS Classmark 3 IE for GSM
(see 3GPP TS 24.008), the PS LCS Capability IE for GERAN Gb mode (see 3GPP TS
24.008) and the MS Positioning Capability IE for GERAN Iu mode (see 3GPP TS
44.118).
Figure 31a: RRLP Position Capability Transfer Flow
1) The SMLC determines that the target MS supports MS Positioning Capability
Transfer using RRLP and sends a Positioning Capability Request message to the
BSC.
2) The BSC forwards the Positioning Capability Request message to the MS.
3) The MS sends the Positioning Capability Response message to the BSC. The
response message shall include the positioning capabilities of the MS and the
types of supported assistance data (if applicable). The message may include
the types of assistance needed by the MS to obtain a location estimate or
positioning measurements.
4) The BSC forwards the Positioning Capability Response message to the SMLC.
### 9.4.4 Error Handling for E-OTD and A-GNSS in CS Domain
This clause describes error handling for positioning and transfer of
assistance data for E-OTD and A-GNSS. For a description of error handling
involving segmentation, and more details on usage of a BSSLAP Abort, Reject
and Reset refer to clause 8.5 Exception Procedures.
Case 1: When the RRLP request comes to BSC for E-OTD and A-GNSS, The BSC will
send a BSSLAP reject message to SMLC if the request cannot be supported in the
BSC for reasons other than an ongoing intra BSC or inter BSC handover or other
ongoing RR management procedure. For an ongoing intra BSC HO or other RR
management procedure, the BSC shall return a BSSLAP Reset when the handover or
RR management procedure is complete. The SMLC may then start the RRLP request
(if there is time) again. For ongoing inter-BSC HO, the BSC shall return a
BSSLAP Abort. The location service request may then restart from the LCS
Client, VMSC or SGSN.
Case 2: When the RRLP request comes to BSC from SMLC, BSC sends the \"RRLP
request\" to the MS if there is no ongoing HO or other RR management procedure
at that point. If an intra-BSC HO or other RR management procedure is
initiated in BSC, the BSC sends the HO or other RR management command to MS. A
timer will then be started in BSC, the duration of which is network dependent,
but typically 6 (six) seconds. Upon receiving the HO of other RR management
command, the MS will stop the location procedure and start on handover or
other RR management procedure, since this has higher priority than location.
The MS will then send the HO complete or other RR management response message
to BSC. When this message is received before the expiration of BSC timer, a
BSSLAP Reset message will be sent to SMLC from BSC. The Reset will tell SMLC
to start another location service request if there is enough time.
Case 3: During intra-BSC HO or other intra-BSC RR management procedure, if a
HO complete or RR management procedure completion was not received in BSC and
the corresponding timer expired. In this case a reset or abort message will be
sent to SMLC indicating MS timeout. The location service may then restart from
either the SMLC if a reset was sent or from the LCS Client, VMSC or SGSN if an
abort was sent.
Case 4: If an inter-BSC handover is needed during a location procedure or if
the BSC times out on an RRLP response from the target MS, the BSC shall send a
BSSLAP Abort to the SMLC. The location service attempt may then be restarted
from the LCS Client, VMSC, or SGSN.

### 9.4.5a Error Handling for E-OTD and A-GNSS in PS Domain
Case 1: When the RRLP request comes to BSS for E-OTD and A-GNSS, the BSS will
send a BSSLAP reject message to SMLC if the request cannot be supported in the
BSS.
Case 2: When the RRLP request comes to BSS from SMLC, BSS sends the \"RRLP
request\" to the MS via the SGSN and starts position supervision timer. After
this, if the BSS determines that the current location procedure cannot be
continued, the BSS sends an abort message to the SMLC. Notice that an MS
reselection to a new cell is not a reason for the BSS to abort the procedure.
Case 3: If the position supervision timer times out in BSS before the RRLP
response from the target MS is received, the BSS shall send a BSSLAP Abort to
the SMLC. The location service attempt may then be restarted from the LCS
Client, VMSC, or SGSN.

### 9.4.6 Broadcast of Assistance Data
In MS Based E-OTD, MS Based GPS and MS Assisted A-GNSS systems, there may be a
need for assistance data to be broadcast to the MS. The assistance data to be
broadcast for MS Based E-OTD contains the Real Time Difference (RTD) values
(in case of a non-synchronised network) and Base Transceiver Station (BTS)
coordinates. In addition, the broadcast data contains other information
simplifying the E-OTD measurements. The broadcast of A-GNSS assistance data
may make available the same information as in A-GNSS point-to-point
signalling. It improves the location accuracy for MS Based implementations,
increases the sensitivity, enables LMU-independent time dissemination and
assists the acquisition of satellite signals for both MS Based and MS Assisted
implementations.
The CS mechanism (Cell Broadcast on CBCH) is used for broadcast of assistance
data for all MSs, irrespective of which domain (CS or PS) they are located in.
Notice that it may take longer for an MS in the PS domain compared to the CS
domain to read all the broadcast data. This is because the PBCCH is not co-
ordinated with the CBCH and therefore, the MS may have to skip reading a CBCH
slot in order to listen for a potential paging message.
The E-OTD assistance data to be broadcast is in compressed format where the
redundant information is not included. The MS is capable to reconstruct the
E-OTD assistance data using the message header information. The length of the
message is depending on how many neighbours are included in the E-OTD
assistance data as well as whether the redundant information can be removed
from the message. The typical size of one broadcast message will be less than
82 octets. Part of the broadcast message (serving and neighbour base station
coordinates) may be ciphered.
The contents of the broadcast message for the E-OTD and A-GNSS assistance data
is described in 3GPP TS 44.035 [16]. The support for these broadcast messages
is optional for network and MS.
The broadcast channel which is used to broadcast the E-OTD and A-GNSS
assistance data make use of the existing basic or extended CBCH and SMSCB DRX
service. The LCS broadcast messages need to be either scheduled, or
prioritised over other broadcast messages to avoid any delay.
#### 9.4.6.1 Point-To-Multipoint Assistance Data Broadcast Flow
This signalling flow is generic for MS Based E-OTD, MS Based A-GNSS and MS
Assisted A-GNSS methods. The E-OTD/A-GNSS Assistance Data Broadcast Message is
created in SMLC and the whole message including the ciphered parts and
parameters to control the transfer are transferred with below flow from SMLC
to MS. SMSCB DRX service is used for LCS assistance data broadcast. Prior
receiving the first schedule message MS should read first block of each
message lot to be able to receive the LCS Broadcast Data or the schedule
message. After receiving the schedule message MS should receive the LCS
Broadcast Data messages according the schedule information.
{width="6.6090277777777775in" height="3.1166666666666667in"}
Figure 33: E-OTD/A-GNSS Broadcast Data Flow
1) SMLC sends the complete broadcast message to CBC with LCS Broadcast Data
message. This LCS Broadcast Data message contains the data to be broadcasted
as well as parameters that indicate to which BTS the broadcast message is
targeted and what time the broadcast should happen. LCS Broadcast Data (data &
parameters) message may also contain the SMSCB scheduling information which
can be utilised for the SMSCB DRX feature specified in 3GPP TS 44.012 [13]
specification. SMSCB DRX operation is required in order that MS performance
can be optimised.
2) CBC starts message transfer to BSC and BTS according to 3GPP TS 23.041 [6].
3) LCS Broadcast Data Response message from CBC to SMLC is used to indicate
that the LCS Broadcast Data has been delivery request has been fulfilled. This
message is not mandatory
4) BTS starts the message transfer to MS according to 3GPP TS 23.041 [6].
Implementations that have SMLC and/or CBC integrated into BSC may use other
message signalling.
#### 9.4.6.2 Ciphering
In order for the operators to control the access to the assistance data, parts
of the broadcast data may be ciphered. Ciphering is done with a specific key
delivered by the network for this purpose. The deciphering keys may be
requested by the MS as described in 3GPP TS 23.271 [7]. The LCS Broadcast
Data, when ciphered, will be partially ciphered according to the LCS broadcast
message definitions specified in 3GPP TS 44.035 [16]. The parts that will be
ciphered in E-OTD LCS Broadcast Data message are neighbour RTD values, serving
and neighbour BTS coordinates. For A-GNSS, all assistance data may be
ciphered, The MS is capable to decipher the broadcast message (ciphered parts)
using the cipher key (56 bits) delivered from the Core Network to MS and using
the Ciphering Serial Number (16 bits) included in the broadcast message.
##### 9.4.6.2.1 Algorithm
The algorithm used for ciphering is the standard 56-bit DES algorithm. The
deciphering of broadcast messages is done in the MS. SMLC ciphers the LCS
Broadcast Data message (part of message is ciphered) using the deciphering
keys (56 bits) and Ciphering Serial Number (16 bits) included in broadcast
message using 56-bit DES algorithm.
The ciphered part is variable length with one bit resolution. From LCS
Broadcast Data message header MS can compute what part of message is ciphered.
Inputs to the 56-bit DES algorithm are the following:
\- 56-bit key K (deciphering key);
\- 16-bit Ciphering Serial Number from broadcast message which is denoted here
by IV (initialisation vector);
\- plaintext bits (the ciphered part of broadcast message).
Encryption is done by producing a mask bit stream which is then added bit-by-
bit to the plaintext data (XOR-operation) to obtain the cipher text data.
First IV is concatenated with 0-bits in order to achieve a 64-bit block I~1~.
This block is then encrypted by the DES algorithm using the key K. Output is a
64-bit block I~2~. This constitutes the first 64 bits of the mask bit stream.
If the message is longer than 64 bits, then more bits are needed. Those are
produced by encrypting I~2~ again by the DES algorithm using the key K. Output
is a 64-bit block I~3~. This constitutes the next 64 bits of the mask bit
stream. This iteration is continued until enough bits are produced. The
unnecessary bits from the last 64-bit block I~j~ are discarded. Below figure
describes the first two mask bit generations and the two ciphered 64-bit
blocks.
{width="6.479861111111111in" height="4.406944444444444in"}
Figure 34 : Ciphering Algorithm
Decryption is done similarly. The same mask bit stream is produced. This time
the mask stream bits are added bit-by-bit (XORed) to the ciphertext data bits.
The result will be the plain text data.
#### 9.4.6.3 Deciphering key control and delivery to MS
The deciphering keys are needed in MS if the LCS Broadcast Data (ciphered
parts) is ciphered. The deciphering keys\' control system contains two keys
(the Current Deciphering Key and the Next Deciphering Key) and the Ciphering
Key Flag (indicating the current Ciphering Key Flag state in the location area
in the time that the deciphering key set is delivered from SMLC to MS). Two
Deciphering Keys are needed in order to overcome the problem of unsynchronised
nature of the periodic location updates that MSs make in the location area.
The SMLC controls the keys and there are following requirements related to the
deciphering keys:
\- Deciphering Key Set (Current and Next Deciphering Key, Ciphering Key Flag)
are always location area specific.
\- One SMLC controls the deciphering key set changes inside the location area
and in case several SMLCs in the location area then one coordinating SMLC for
the deciphering key set control must be nominated. The SMLC configuration is
done with O&M procedures.
\- The coordinating SMLC delivers the new deciphering key set to the other
SMLCs with SMLCPP protocol when the deciphering key set changes. The Ciphering
Key Flag in the LCS Broadcast Data message is changed only when the
coordinating SMLC changes the deciphering key set and delivers the new set to
other SMLCs in the same location area.
\- The SMLCs upon receiving the new deciphering key set, start using
immediately the new set in the LCS Broadcast Data message. The coordinating
SMLC also starts using the new set same time.
The deciphering key set changes always following way when the new set is
generated:
\- The Next Deciphering Key comes to the Current Deciphering Key in the new
set.
\- One new key is taken into use and named as the Next Deciphering Key.
\- The Ciphering Key Flag changes the state.
The Ciphering Key Flag controls the MS key usage (Current/Next Deciphering
Key) as follows:
\- After receiving the new deciphering key set, MS starts using the new set
immediately.
\- The Ciphering Key Flag in the LCS Broadcast Data message and the one
received returned to the MS should have same polarity. This means that MS
starts using the Current Deciphering Key immediately.
\- When the Ciphering Key Flag state changes in the LCS Broadcast Data message
then MS starts to use the Next Deciphering Key for deciphering the broadcast
message. The Next Deciphering Key becomes now the Current Deciphering Key in
MS.
Figure 35 describes the deciphering key delivery mechanism.
{width="6.575694444444444in" height="3.6840277777777777in"}
Figure 35: Deciphering key delivery
\- First the key A is the Current Deciphering Key and key B is the Next
Deciphering Key.
\- When the SMLC changes to use the key B (Next Deciphering Key) then the
Deciphering Key Flag state is changed in the LCS Broadcast Data message. At
this point the coordinating SMLC delivers the new deciphering key set to other
SMLCs in the same location area as well as to MS when MS is requesting the
keys during the location update (IMSI Attach, Normal or Periodic Location
Update).
\- The new deciphering key set contains now key B as the Current Deciphering
Key, key C as new Next Deciphering Key and the Ciphering Key Flag currently in
use in that location area.
\- When the SMLC changes to use the key C (Next Deciphering Key) then the
Ciphering Key Flag state is changed in the LCS Broadcast Data message. At this
point the coordinating SMLC delivers the new deciphering key set to other
SMLCs in same location area as well as to MS when MS is requesting the new set
during the location update (IMSI Attach, Normal or Periodic Location Update).
\- The new deciphering key set contains now key C as the Current Deciphering
Key, key D as new Next Deciphering Key and the Ciphering Key Flag currently in
use in that location area.
The process continues as above when the keys are changed. The lifetime of one
key (Current/Next Ciphering Key) is minimum one periodic location update
period used in the location area.
## 9.5 U-TDOA Positioning Procedures
### 9.5.0 General
Following the receipt of a location request message from the BSC, the U-TDOA
capable SMLC interrogates the BSS for the RF channel information associated
with the MS to be located. The SMLC uses this information to task the LMUs at
the serving and surrounding cells. The LMUs are tasked to measure the
identified RF channel(s) and thus provide a time reference from different
LMUs. The time-of-arrival information from the tasked LMUs is returned to the
SMLC where the MS location is calculated.
### 9.5.1 U-TDOA Positioning in CS Domain for A/Gb-mode
#### 9.5.1.1 General Procedures
The U-TDOA location method uses the uplink energy transmitted by an MS to make
a location determination. If the MS was in the dedicated mode, carrying
subscriber traffic prior to the beginning of the location process, the energy
associated with this subscriber traffic can be used to locate the MS. If the
MS was placed in the dedicated mode by the MSC specifically for location
determination purposes, either the SDCCH or TCH can be used for U-TDOA
location purposes.
#### 9.5.1.2 CS U-TDOA Messages and Procedures on the Lb Interface
The following section describes the positioning procedure for CS U-TDOA
location determination on the Lb interface.
{width="6.7in" height="2.9784722222222224in"}
Figure 36: CS U-TDOA Positioning Procedure
  1. The SMLC sends a BSSMAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message to the BSC that contains the embedded BSSLAP U-TDOA Request message. The U-TDOA Request message may contain the delta timer value. The BSC starts the delta timer, received or internal, immediately after sending the U-TDOA Response message to the SMLC. The purpose of this timer is to define the maximum time during which the BSC supervises the location request.
  2. The BSC sends a BSSMAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message to the SMLC that contains the embedded BSSLAP U-TDOA Response message. The U-TDOA Response message contains the physical channel information (frequencies, hopping sequence, channel type, time slot, sub-channel number, etc.), the intended Power-Up Starting Time (if the power-up procedure for U-TDOA is supported), the MS power, the cell identifier, and the TA. If frequency hopping is used, the U-TDOA Response message also includes the frequency list. The U-TDOA Response message also contains the ciphering key (Kc) if ciphering is used on the air interface and the version of the applied A5 ciphering algorithm (A5/x). The Kc is ciphered if sent from the SMLC to any LMU. The SMLC and any LMU with which it interacts shall also be mutually authenticated. These requirements shall be met using a security mechanism meeting the capabilities of the Zb interface of NDS/IP (TS 33.210) or TLS (RFC 2246). The LMU installation shall meet the same physical security requirements as a BTS installation. For locations on channels that are not ciphered, the algorithm identifier will show the same.
  3. If the power-up procedure for U-TDOA is supported, the BSC may use the normal power-control command to order the MS to go to the maximum power allowed by the BTS. After the MS has been at full power for a period of one second, the BSC shall return to normal power-control. During the time the MS is ordered to the maximum power, the BSC may temporarily suspend uplink DTX, if in use.
#### 9.5.1.3 RR Procedure effecting the CS U-TDOA channel description
The location determination process is not an instantaneous event and it can
take a few seconds to collect and calculate location determination related
data. If changes happen to the last reported channel description and the
location determination is not complete, an updated channel description needs
to be sent to the SMLC.
The BSC considers the location determinations complete if; it receives a
BSSAP-LE Perform Location response message; or the delta timer expires; or it
receives a valid BSSLAP message for a new positioning method.
The RR procedures that effect the U-TDOA channel description are listed in
Table 9.5.1. The "Treatment" column lists the appropriate BSSLAP message to be
sent by the BSC to the SMLC. The Reset message is defined in 3GPP TS 48.071
and shall contain the updated channel description. After sending the Reset
message the BSC shall restart the delta timer and continue supervision of the
location request.

* * *
If the BSC receives the BSSLAP U-TDOA Request message during one of the
identified RR procedures in Table 9.5.1, it will complete the ongoing RR
procedure and then respond with the BSSLAP U-TDOA Response message.
#### 9.5.1.4 BSC Error Handling during CS U-TDOA Positioning Procedure
There are three (3) BSSLAP messages defined to handle error scenarios that
occur during the U-TDOA location process: Reset, Reject and Abort. Please
refer to 3GPP TS 48.071 for the messages' details. The BSSLAP Reset message is
used to update the U-TDOA channel description as outlined in 9.5.1.3.
In Table 9.5.2, all identified RR procedures are listed that result in the
BSSLAP Abort message to be sent from the BSC to the SMLC. The Abort message is
only sent if the U-TDOA location determination is not complete. The BSC
considers the location determinations complete if; it receives a BSSAP-LE
Perform Location response message; or the delta timer expires; or it receives
a valid BSSLAP message for a new positioning method.

If the BSC receives the BSSLAP U-TDOA Request message during one of the
identified RR procedures in Table 9.5.2, it will respond with the BSSLAP Abort
message.
If the BSC is unable to perform the U-TDOA positioning for other reasons than
those related to the items listed in Table 9.5.1 and Table 9.5.2, it will
respond to the BSSLAP U-TDOA Request message with the BSSLAP Reject message.
### 9.5.2 U-TDOA Positioning in PS Domain for A/Gb-mode
#### 9.5.2.1 Introduction
The U-TDOA location method uses information transmitted by an MS to make a
location determination. The initial state of the MS will be identified and
will dictate the procedure to be followed in the location process. If the MS
was in the packet transfer mode, sending uplink RLC/MAC blocks prior to the
beginning of the location process, the energy associated with this continuing
uplink data can be used to locate the MS. If the MS was previously idle in the
uplink direction and placed in the active state by the SGSN specifically for
U-TDOA location determination purposes, it is necessary to cause the MS to
send uplink information using the Packet polling procedure (see 3GPP TS
44.060).
An uplink block of data containing the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message
is equivalent to any other RLC/MAC block for U-TDOA location purposes; i.e.
one uplink RLC/MAC block is equivalent to one execution of the Packet polling
procedure. This applies only to the lowest numbered timeslot in the case of a
multi-slot uplink TBF. The Polling Repetition information element in the
U-TDOA Request message defines the total number of RLC/MAC uplink blocks
required to achieve the desired location QoS within a recommended period of
two seconds, including any PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message received due
to the execution of a Packet polling procedure.
#### 9.5.2.2 General Procedures
The U-TDOA location method procedures depend on the initial condition of the
MS. If the MS is initially in packet idle mode the Packet Polling method shall
be applied as described in sub-clause 9.5.2.2.1. When the MS is initially in
the packet transfer mode it may or may not be sending uplink data. If the MS
is not sending uplink data the Packet polling procedure shall be applied. The
application of the U-TDOA location method in the packet transfer mode is
described in sub-clause 9.5.2.2.2.
##### 9.5.2.2.1 MS in packet idle mode
For an MS that is in packet idle mode, application of the U-TDOA location
method requires that a single timeslot downlink TBF be established. This
downlink TBF shall be used for repeated executions of the Packet polling
procedure in order to cause a mobile to transmit for a time sufficient to
achieve the requested level of location accuracy. The number of repetitions of
the Packet polling procedure required to achieve the desired level of accuracy
shall be indicated in the U-TDOA REQUEST message sent from the SMLC to the
BSS.
The BSS shall execute the indicated number of Packet polling procedures after
an implementation dependent interval to allow assignment of the Location
Measurement Units (LMU) to the indicated ARFCN and timeslot(s). The RRBP field
shall be used to schedule the resulting PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
messages. The BSS must indicate a PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT response
containing the TLLI by setting the TYPE OF ACK information element to RLC/MAC
control block in all PACKET POLLING REQUEST messages associated with U-TDOA
positioning.
If the MS is allocated an uplink TBF prior to completion of the required
number of Packet polling procedures, the BSS may suspend the Packet polling
procedure and send a Reset message to the SMLC containing the physical channel
information for the allocated uplink TBF. Following sending of a Reset
message, the BSS shall reset the Polling Repetition counter to zero and
restart the U-TDOA positioning procedure after an implementation dependent
interval.
The downlink TBF established for U-TDOA location purposes should be used if a
single timeslot downlink TBF is required during the execution of the U-TDOA
location procedure. If a multi-slot downlink TBF is required during the
execution of the U-TDOA location procedure, the assignment of this TBF may be
delayed until the completion of the U-TDOA location procedure, otherwise the
BSS shall send a Reset message to the SMLC and reset the Polling Repetition
counter as described previously.
If both an uplink TBF and a downlink TBF are required during the execution of
the U-TDOA location procedure, the Packet polling procedure may be restarted
and the uplink RLC/MAC blocks can be used for U-TDOA location as described
subsequently.
##### 9.5.2.2.2 MS in packet transfer mode
If only a downlink TBF exists it shall be used to execute the Packet polling
procedure, on the lowest numbered timeslot transmitted before the last PACKET
POLLING REQUEST/PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT cycle has been completed, the
BSS shall not set the FBI bit in the RLC/MAC header of the last data block.
The TBF shall be terminated after the last cycle of the Packet polling
procedure using a PACKET TBF RELEASE message from the BSS. If the MS is
allocated an uplink TBF prior to completion of the required number of Packet
polling procedures, the BSS may suspend the Packet polling procedure and send
a Reset message to the SMLC as described in sub-clause 9.5.2.2.1.
If only an uplink TBF exists and RLC/MAC blocks are available for transmission
(on the lowest numbered timeslot for a multi-slot TBF), those blocks shall be
used to locate the MS using the U-TDOA location method. If the number of
uplink blocks pertaining to the uplink TBF is insufficient to satisfy the
requested number of uplink data blocks within an implementation dependent
period recommended to be two seconds, the Packet polling procedure shall be
executed on the existing uplink TBF for the balance of the requested blocks.
The lowest numbered timeslot shall be used for the Packet polling procedure if
the existing uplink TBF is a multi-slot TBF. The uplink TBF shall not be
terminated until the Packet polling procedures have been completed.
If both an uplink and downlink TBF exist, either TBF may be used for MS
location using the U-TDOA location method as described previously. The TBF
should not be terminated until the Packet polling procedures have been
completed.
#### 9.5.2.3 PS U-TDOA Messages and Procedures on the Lb Interface
The following section describes the positioning procedure for PS U-TDOA
location determination on the Lb interface.
Figure 37: PS U-TDOA Positioning Procedure
  1. The SMLC sends a BSSMAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message to the BSS that contains the embedded BSSLAP U-TDOA Request message. The U-TDOA Request message contains the required number of received uplink RLC/MAC blocks, repetitions of the RLC/MAC Packet polling request procedure or combination of both. The inclusion of this Polling Repetition information element in the U-TDOA Request message indicates that the location determination shall occur in the PS domain.
2\. The BSS sends a BSSMAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message to the
SMLC that contains the embedded BSSLAP U-TDOA Response message. The U-TDOA
Response message contains; the physical channel information (frequencies, time
slot, TFI, TLLI, start time, etc.); the MS power; the cell identifier; and the
Timing Advance. For MS without an existing uplink or downlink TBF the BSS
establishes a downlink TBF, if one does not currently exist. The BSS monitors
any uplink TBF until the requested number of RLC/MAC blocks has been received,
executes the specified number of Packet polling procedures on the lowest
numbered timeslot in the case of a multi-slot TBF or a combination of both as
described in sub-clause 9.5.2.1. The BSS releases any downlink TBF established
solely for U-TDOA location.
#### 9.5.2.4 RLC/MAC Procedure affecting the PS U-TDOA TBF description
The RLC/MAC procedures that effect the U-TDOA channel description are listed
in Table 9.5.3. The "Treatment" column lists the message to be sent by the BSS
to the SMLC. The Reset message is defined in 3GPP TS 48.071 and shall contain
the updated channel description. After sending the Reset message the BSS shall
wait for an implementation dependent interval to allow reconfiguration of the
LMUs, start the U-TDOA location process from the beginning and continue
supervision of the location request.

If the BSS receives the BSSLAP U-TDOA Request message during one of the
identified RLC/MAC procedures in Table 9.5.3, it will complete the ongoing
RLC/MAC procedure and then respond with the BSSLAP U-TDOA Response message.
The Reset message must be sent after completion of the listed RLC/MAC
procedure if that procedure must be executed during an ongoing U-TDOA location
event.
#### 9.5.2.5 Error Handling during PS U-TDOA Positioning Procedure
In Table 9.5.4, all identified RLC/MAC procedures are listed that result in
the BSSLAP Abort message to be sent from the BSS to the SMLC. The Abort
message is only sent if the U-TDOA location determination is not complete. The
BSS considers the location determinations complete if; it receives a BSSAP-LE
Perform Location response message; or it receives a valid BSSLAP message for a
new positioning method.

If the BSS is unable to perform the U-TDOA positioning for other reasons than
those related to the items listed in Table 9.5.3 and Table 9.5.4, it will
respond to the BSSLAP U-TDOA Request message with the BSSLAP Reject message.
# 10 Information storage
This clause describes information storage structures that are mandatory (M),
conditional (C) or optional (O) for LCS in GERAN, and the recovery and
restoration procedures needed to maintain service if inconsistencies in
databases occur and for lost or invalid database information.
## 10.1 SMLC
Common Data
Table 2 holds permanent BTS data:
Table 2: Permanent SMLC Data for a BTS

The SMLC holds data for its associated LMUs. The main key to LMU data in the
SMLC is the IMSI for a Type A LMU and a cell site identifier for a Type B LMU.
LMU data provides the location capabilities of the LMU (e.g. which location
and assistance measurements are supported). The following permanent data shall
be administered for any LMU.

The SMLC also holds the following temporary data for each LMU for which there
has been any previous signalling interaction.
Table 4: Temporary SMLC Data for an LMU

Temporary LMU Data Item Status Description Position Measurements O Ongoing and
scheduled position measurements ordered in the LMU by the SMLC -- details are
outside the scope of the present document Assistance Measurements O Ongoing
and scheduled assistance measurements ordered by the SMLC -- details are
outside the scope of the present document O&M Activities O Ongoing and
scheduled O&M activities ordered in the LMU by the SMLC -- details are outside
the scope of the present document
* * *
An LMU contains no mandatory data regarding its associated SMLC. An LMU shall
contain permanent data regarding its measurement and O&M capabilities and may
contain pre-administered data regarding location assistance measurements and
O&M activities that the LMU is to perform without the need for any command
from the SMLC. The content of such location measurement and O&M related data
is outside the scope of the present document.
## 10.2 Recovery and Restoration Procedures
The LCS recovery and restoration procedures allow temporary data to be
recovered or re-initialized following loss or corruption of data, such that
normal LCS service is rapidly restored and inconsistency between the data held
by different LCS network elements is removed. For a full description, refer to
3GPP TS 23.007 [4].
