## 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**example:** text used to clarify abstract rules by applying them literally.
For the sake of easy explanation the following short terms are defined:
**Legacy MSC Server:** \ The Legacy MSC server does not support AoIP.
**Legacy MGW:** \ The Legacy MGW does not support AoIP.
**Legacy BSS:** \ The Legacy BSS does not support AoIP.
**New MSC Server:** \ The New MSC Server supports only the AoIP-interface.\
Legacy BSSes are not supported by a New MSC Server.
**Upgraded MSC Server:** \ The Upgraded MSC Server supports both, the TDM
A-interface and the IP A-interface. Both kinds of interfaces could work
simultaneously for different BSSs. It is claimed by some companies (e.g.
Ericsson) that it is necessary to support AoTDM and AoIP also for the same,
Upgraded BSS.\ Also legacy BSS, i.e. without any change, is supported by an
Upgraded MSC Server.
**New MGW:** \ The New MGW supports all UMTS and GSM Codecs as specified in
3GPP TS 26.103 [18] and has only an IP interface towards the BSS. The New MGW
does not support AoTDM, not TFO and not PCMoIP.
**Upgraded MGW:\** The Upgraded MGW supports most or all UMTS and GSM Codecs
as specified in 3GPP TS 26.103 [9] and has an IP interface towards the BSS.
The Upgraded MGW supports both, AoIP and AoTDM. It supports PCMoIP and
optionally TFO on any PCM link.\ _\_**New Core Network:\** A New Core Network
has only New MSC Servers and New MGWs.
**Upgraded Core Network:\ A Core Network, where at least one MSC-Server or one
MGW is upgraded to handle AoIP, while AoTDM, TFO or PCMoIP may be handled by
some MSC-Servers or MGWs still.**
**Transcoder-less BSS:** \ A **Transcoder-less** BSS supports only AoIP, not
AoTDM any longer. There is no way to use transcoders in a **Transcoder-less**
BSS. It is not compatible to legacy core networks.
**Upgraded BSS:\** An Upgraded BSS starts from AoTDM with transcoders in BSS
and ends potentially in AoIP without any transcoders in BSS and without AoTDM,
i.e. as \"**Transcoder-less** BSS\". But several intermediate deployment
scenarios are allowed for a safe and flexible migration. In order to be able
to interwork with any kind of core network it seems obvious that AoTDM and
AoIP will be needed in parallel for some time in most BSS vendors development
strategies.\ The Upgraded BSS has the option to report its capability to the
CN.
For the purposes of the present document, the following concepts apply:
**Codec Type** Any of the existing GSM Codec Types, like\ GSM_FR, GSM_HR,
GSM_EFR, FR_AMR, HR_AMR,\ FR_AMR-WB, see 26.103.
**Codec Configuration** mainly used in context of AMR and AMR-WB to specify
the mode set to be used during the call, e.g.\ NB-Set1 = {(12.2) -- 7.4 -- 5.9
-- 4.75}\ WB-Set0 = {12.65 -- 8.85 -- 6.60}
**Compatible Codec Configurations** Codec Configurations that do not require
transcoding, although the Codec Types and Configurations may be different,
e.g. FR_AMR(set 1) to HR_AMR (set 1), i.e. .\ FR_AMR {12.2 -- 7.4 -- 5.9 --
4.75} to\ HR_AMR { 7.4 - 5.9 - 4.75}
**Interface Type** The A-Interface will exist in various types, e.g. as\ AoTDM
or AoIP (target)

# 5 Overview
## 5.1 Background
BSS (Base Station System) over IP is a technique trend in wireless network
evolution, which can construct high bandwidth, high efficiency and low cost
basic networks. BSS over IP involves Gb interface and A interface over IP. For
Gb interface over IP, it has been standardised in 3GPP Release 4. For A
interface over IP, control plane signalling over IP (SIGTRAN) has been
introduced in 3GPP Release 7 while certain features (e.g. MSC in Pool and
Layered Architecture) require an intermediate signalling network for best
performance.
During the specification drafting of A interface control plane signalling over
IP in 3GPP Release 7, some operators expressed the concern that in order to
take full advantage of IP based technologies the protocols of A interface user
plane should be adapted for IP based transport.
The IP based transport protocols provide a low cost intermediate network which
is very attractive to the operators because CAPEX and OPEX can be
significantly reduced.
A interface over IP can also simplify the implementation of MSCs in a pool.
Furthermore, UTRAN network and more advanced RAN can use a common IP backhaul
with GERAN.
In mobile networks many domains and interfaces within and between those
domains have already been adapted to IP technology or are on the way to
introduce IP as an alternative to ATM and TDM based technologies. For example
the BICN (Bearer Independent Core Network [2]) has introduced IP in the CS
domain and there is support of IP at the Iu interface towards the 3G radio
network [3]. While IP based A-interface signaling is introduced in 3GPP
release 7 [4], the user plane of the A-interface is still solely based on TDM
transmission technology.
{width="5.997916666666667in" height="2.8847222222222224in"}
**Figure 5.1.1:** Today only the TDM based user plane prevents operators\ from
achieving an ALL-IP implementation in the GSM radio and core networks
One of the main advantages of having IP based A-interface for the user plane
is a much more flexible network design between the BSS and the CS core.
Furthermore IP hardware in the nodes and IP site and backbone infrastructure
can be shared by the A-interface control plane and the user plane. A
separation of the signaling network from the user plane can be achieved by
using technologies like VLAN tagging, virtual routing etc. This will allow the
operator to abolish TDM hardware and TDM infrastructure and by that reduce
OPEX and CAPEX.
Further on in most of the current networks, both BSS and CN have transcoding
functionality, i.e. Transcoder in BSS and Media Gateway (MGW) in CN. Some core
networks have been upgraded to convey compressed speech over IP transport. In
this case, removing TC from BSS and transfer compressed speech over A
interface will reduce cost of transcoder device, reduce cost of transport
resource and improve voice quality by implementing TrFO.
## 5.2 Architecture
### 5.2.1 Legacy Architecture
The current A-interface has signaling over IP defined (SIGTRAN) in addition to
the original signaling using TDM signaling transport. But, as stated before,
for the user plane only TDM transmission is defined, with transcoding always
located inside the BSS. The only Codec defined for this TDM A-Interface is PCM
(G.711). In addition TFO may exist, which tunnels compressed speech through
this PCM link between TRAU and MGW.
{width="6.322222222222222in" height="3.2256944444444446in"}
Note: the TRAU boxes include the transcoders, located somewhere in BSS.
Figure 5.2.1.1: Current legacy architecture
### 5.2.2 PCM encoded speech (G.711) over IP
A first improvement, which is seen as an \"interim\" solution, can be
introduced with no changes on the functional division between Base Station
System (BSS) and CS Core Network, as specified in TS 48.002 [5]. Specifically
the transcoding is left within the BSS. This approach focuses on migrating the
existing A interface to IP; the network architecture is not really impacted.
It will specify how to carry 64 kbps A-interface channels between the BSC and
the MGW over an underlying IP based transport protocol; for both voice
services as well as for data and fax services.
The Codec defined for the A-Interface is still PCM, again TFO is an option.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="3.7597222222222224in"}
**Figure 5.2.2.1:** Architecture for the G.711 over IP \"interim solution\"
In this case the recommended network architecture is that Media Gateways
(MGWs) are co-located at the same site where the transcoders are. This is
always desirable, but the high transport volume makes it quite important. To
achieve better bandwidth efficiency at the A interface IP-multiplexing
techniques shall become an option. The packetization time may be either 5 ms
or 20 ms (FFS).
The main advantage of this approach relates to the fact that IP solves
problems related to the inflexible physical connectivity of TDM. The solution
introduces the freedom to place a BSC/TRAU somewhere in an IP network. To
scale the capacity of the A interface becomes much easier because another MGW
can be added without considering adding TDM connectivity to local BSC/TRAUs.
And obviously the deployment of A-flex will be much easier, because the
BSC/TRAUs have to be \"connected\" with all MGWs belonging to the MSC in Pool.
And, as already said above, IP hardware in the nodes and IP site and backbone
infrastructure can be shared by the A-interface control plane and user plane.
In this approach, these advantages can be achieved by using the existing
transcoder pools within BSS, without requiring any new transcoder resources in
MGW. This may be of especial importance for legacy Codecs, like GSM_FR and
GSM_HR, where no future growth is expected, but which will disappear over
time.
### 5.2.3 Compressed speech over IP
The target solution aims at carrying compressed speech in an efficient way
across the A interface over the RTP/UDP/IP protocol stack. In contrast to TFO
in this case the compressed speech is formatted directly and there is no PCM
stream in parallel, and this allows to support TrFO.
This solution implies a deviation from the current BSS architecture, where
today PCM is used on the A interface and transcoders are functionally
integrated into the BSS.
In fact, compressed speech on the A interface can rely on transcoder resources
in the Core Network and allow removal of transcoder resources from the BSS,
thus impacting the functional division between the BSS and the CN. Besides
improving the end-to-end speech quality, reducing the overall speech path
delay and reducing the bit rate on the A interface, this approach would also
reduce the overall need for transcoder resources in BSS and Core Network and
could be considered as the target deployment scenario. But it will require
additional transcoder resources\ (e.g. more DSP-power for transcoding in all
Mobile-to-PSTN calls) within the Core Network and possibly new transcoder
types (e.g. GSM_HR) within the Core Network.
For the following discussion it is exactly define what the term \"transcoder\"
means. So far it was in GERAN used for the transcoding between the 3GPP-Codec
used on the radio interface and the G.711 Codec used on the A-Interface. The
installed transcoder base is exactly performing this kind of transcoding and
G.711 is an \"integral part\" of the transcoder pools.
In contrast to that the transcoding between two different 3GPP-Codecs, e.g.
between GSM_HR and GSM_EFR should be termed \"transcoder-pair\", with
implicitly knowing that this transcoding is done in several steps, e.g. 1)
from GSM_HR to lin.PCM then 2) from lin.PCM to G.711 then 3) from G.711 to
lin.PCM and finally 4) from lin.PCM to GSM_EFR. (lin.PCM stands for 8kHz
sampled speech with 16 bit per sample). Using the installed transcoder base
involves in fact three (3!) Codecs and only the \"middle one\", i.e. G.711,
could potentially be left out -- with quite some consequences in TRAU-Pool
organization and interfaces. Any other \"direct\" transcoding between two
different 3GPP Codecs is currently NOT allowed by 3GPP Standards, because it
would violate the mandatory bit exactness. If any such direct transcoding
should be considered, then 3GPP-SA4 shall be consulted for evaluation and
potential standardisation. Any \"proprietary\" shortcut is currently not
allowed, since it could lead into unpredictable speech quality problems.
Consequently in the following the terms \"transcoder\" and \"transcoder-pair\"
are use, where appropriate.
{width="6.689583333333333in" height="3.8020833333333335in"}
**Figure 5.2.3.1:** Architecture for Compressed speech over IP, with
transcoder-less BSS
This approach yields to align the BSS network architecture with the 3G CS core
network architecture. This will allow concentrating development and deployment
of transcoders within the core network. They will become part of the media
gateway (MGW) and will be controlled by the MSC servers.
When deploying a transcoder-less BSS together with a new Core Network, the
transcoders (if a transcoder or transcoder-pair is needed at all for this
call) are allocated in the MGW. The transcoder resource can be shared by
several BSSs. A transcoder-less BSS can not be connected to a legacy Core
Network. An upgraded BSS therefore has transcoders and supports AoIP.
The Codec to be used on the radio interface and the A interface is negotiated
between BSC and MSC with the goal to allow TrFO operation. In the successful
case no transcoder resources are needed, neither in the BSS nor in the CN.
Please note: BSC and MSC can not negotiate two different Codecs for the radio
and the A interface, except when PCM is used on the A interface.
As an (other) implementation option, that aims at exploiting the huge amount
of transcoding resources installed in today\'s GSM networks, Transcoder-pairs
in the BSS could be used to cover the scenarios where TrFO is not possible or
not desirable, e.g. if both radio legs must use different Codecs and
transcoding between the different Codecs used on both ends of the call is
necessary.
The typical approach in 3G networks is, however, to insert a transcoder or a
transcoder-pair in the MGW to cover the scenarios where TrFO is not
possible/desirable. In this way the MSC-Servers have full control over the
end-to-end transcoder combination and therefore full control over the achieved
speech quality.
An important case for a transcoder-pair could be when Codec adaptation is
required on one radio leg during a call (e.g. switch to GSM_HR on the radio in
overload condition or intra-BSS handover to an incompatible cell), and an end-
to-end Codec re-negotiation to maintain TrFO operation is not desirable due to
high signalling load. In this specific case the Codec adaptation can be
\"performed locally\" within the BSS by inserting the pair of transcoders
there (or remove it again at the following handover). This BSS-internal Codec
change would be communicated to the rest of the network by means of the
\'handover performed\' message, containing the information of the Codec used
on the radio interface. But the need to maintain transcoder resources in the
BSS - to be used when TrFO operation is not possible/desirable -- would not
allow exploiting a 3G-like architecture.
**Note:** In this case, if a \'handover performed\' message contains a
different Codec than the one used on the A-interface, the MSC would have to
assume that a transcoder-pair has been introduced by the BSS (this needs to be
discussed further).
Since the rest of the network will be informed that the BSS inserted a
transcoder-pair, situations where the voice quality can be unpredictably
decreased, could be prevented. For instance, in case both radio legs perform
such a Codec adaptation (e.g. both from FR_AMR to GSM_HR), MSC-Servers would
be informed and, instead of maintaining the situation where transcoding is
performed from GSM_HR to G.711 to FR_AMR(set 12.2) to G.711 and to GSM_HR,
they could trigger a Codec re-negotiation in the core network to achieve a
much better call quality by using GSM_HR end-to-end in such high-overload
situations. Optimal would be to use FR_AMR (set 1) and HR_AMR (set 1), because
these allow always end-to-end transcoding free operation.
This implementation option (transcoder-pair in BSS) shall not imply any
changes to the control plane and user plane signalling of the future standard
for AoIP.

**Figure 5.2.3.2:** Architecture for the Compressed speech over IP solution,
with transcoders in the BSS
### 5.2.4 Example Deployment Scenarios
There is an enormous amount of transcoder resources installed in today\'s GSM
radio networks. Therefore the \"final solution\" in the standard shall be
flexible and allow the use of transcoders placed in the BSS or removed from
the BSS and located, when needed, in the CS Core Network. In addition, e.g.
for the purpose of migrating the A interface from a TDM to an IP interface,
both TDM and IP based A interface should be supported concurrently, at least
for the migration phase.
**Note** : TFO is not mandated. As long as transcoders are kept in the BSS and
G.711 is used on A (either in AoTDM or AoIP), it is an option for the operator
to utilize TFO. It is not foreseen that TFO will have impacts on the AoIP work
item.
The table below shows example deployment scenarios that shall be
[evaluated]{.underline} for potential support by the signalling in the
standard. It is not required that an operator has to go through different
deployment scenarios. In contrast the intention is that the standard shall not
hinder an operator from implementing his specific deployment strategy for
AoIP.

In these example deployment scenarios it is assumed that first the MSC-Server
software is upgraded in one step to an upgraded MSC Server. This will then
support all listed deployment scenarios (and maybe more), from legacy scenario
(Deployment 1) to \"Transcoder-less BSS\" scenario (Deployment 4), based on
O&M parameter setting in BSS and MSC and maybe on sophisticated load sharing
algorithms, not detailed here. In case of optimal signalling support on BSSMAP
the BSS parameters need not to be administered in the MSC a second time, which
would always be error prone.
If the MGW is also upgraded to the optimal, final deployment, i.e. including
all necessary hardware and firmware for AoIP and all transcoder capabilities,
then only the BSS-O&M-parameters define the upgrading steps.
For legacy deployment, it is necessary to allow an incremental migration of
all transcoder resources to the MGW. Therefore MGW capability must be
administered in the MSC by O&M (unless also MGW capability signalling is
introduced).
The Technical Specification of AoIP shall define means to allow the
coexistence of TDM and IP between the Core Network and the same BSS.
In the following the example deployment scenarios are described in more
details and with some block diagrams to illustrate the most important aspects.
Please note that the \"transcoder resource\" shall be considered for each
individual Codec Type separately. It is possible that some Codec Types are
supported in BSS, while others are already moved completely out of BSS.
**Deployment Scenario 1 (legacy):** Only AoTDM with G.711 coded speech is used
on the A interface. TFO is an option, on a Codec-by-Codec base. TFO/TrFO
Interworking exists in the core network and OoBTC is quite efficient to manage
in many cases transcoding free operation in MS-to-MS calls. In the example
below (see figure.5.2.4.1) only AMR is used in OoBTC, because this is also an
UTRAN Codec. Of course also EFR could be used in OoBTC in other examples.
Instead of OoBTC the CN may, however, still use ISUP, then Codec Negotiation
is not possible and PCM is used on Nb. In nearby future also SIP-I will be
standardized for the Core Network Nc interface and then compressed speech is
possible on Nb in RTP framing.
In Deployment Scenario 1 the MSC has only a vague knowledge on BSS Codec
capabilities by static O&M. The MSC has no temporary and locally accurate
information on BSS capabilities for a specific call. This limits the
capability of the core network to negotiate a common Codec end-to-end. The BSS
in turn has also only static O&M knowledge on the AMR Configurations used in
CN. TFO between BSS and CN is not guaranteed.

**Figure.5.2.4.1:** Deployment Scenario 1 for legacy BSS
**Deployment Scenario 2:** IP transport is introduced, transcoders stay all in
the BSS, and G.711 is the only allowed Codec on the A-Interface. A TDM-to-IP
converter in BSS is needed for interfacing. The upgraded BSS works on AoTDM
and AoIP concurrently (see left BSS in figure below).
{width="5.510416666666667in" height="1.5520833333333333in"}
**Figure.5.2.4.2:** Deployment Scenario 2 for an upgraded BSS and CN
Signalling between BSC and MSC should be introduced to decide on a call-by-
call basis and Codec-by-Codec basis, which Interface Type to use. It should be
noted that parallel support for both types of interface in the BSS should not
be mandated, but supported by the standard, since an operator should have the
freedom to transmit voice traffic on either link to ensure there is no traffic
lost during the transition. The parallel support of AoTDM and AoIP allows also
a smooth extension of transport capacity by keeping the existing TDM links,
while investing extensions only in IP links.
During the BSS upgrading phase the MSC Server could know the available
Interface Types by MSC-O&M configuration per BSS. There is thus no absolute
need to introduce Interface Type capability related signalling on BSSMAP. But
this MSC-O&M could be quite cumbersome and especially annoying, since it is
maybe only necessary for a short time, until the next migration step. It would
also be inflexible and would not allow a dynamic resource sharing. Attention
should also be given to A-Flex scenarios (MSC in Pool), where a change in a
BSS would affect all connected MSCs immediately. It seems questionable if a
simultaneous update of MSC can be handled by separate O&M.
It is therefore proposed (by Ericsson) to define Interface Type capability
signalling to avoid cumbersome and error prone O&M in BSS and MSC during the
migration phase and to allow a flexible load sharing. When introducing this
signalling extension then it is not a big step to provide it on a per Codec
basis.
In an other example IP transport is introduced, transcoders stay all in the
BSS, G.711 is the only allowed Codec on the A-Interface. AoTDM is shut down at
the same time (see right BSS in figure above), there is no fallback to AoTDM,
the upgraded BSS works on AoIP solely. This is a direct migration from AoTDM
to AoIP in one step without link by link transition from the legacy BSC.
**Deployment Scenarios 3a/3b** : AoTDM is still allowed, AoIP is used in
addition, and the decision is done call-by-call. Transcoder resources stay in
the BSS on a per-Codec-base; compressed speech on the A interface is possible
for Codecs both supported and not supported by transcoders in BSS, in case the
MGW has sufficient capability.
The difference between scenarios 3a and 3b is as follows: while scenario 3a
allows the use of G.711 for AoIP (and thus allows a faster migration from TDM
to IP), scenario 3b allows the use of G.711 only for AoTDM, which allows a
smoother migration from TDM to IP and prevents from managing 3 configurations
in parallel.

**Figure.5.2.4.3a:** Deployment Scenario 3a for an Upgraded BSS
{width="5.510416666666667in" height="1.5520833333333333in"}
**Figure.5.2.4.3b:** Deployment Scenario 3b for an Upgraded BSS
Transcoders in the BSS may be used to still support the G.711 Codec on the A
interface, e.g. in case of a local MS-to-PSTN call.
As an implementation option transcoder-pairs in BSS could also be used to
support transcoding between the Codec used on the radio interface and the
Codec used on the A over IP interface. This could happen after BSS-internal
handover.
It should be possible for a specific Codec Type, e.g. EFR, to use the existing
EFR-TRAU pool in the BSS, while extending EFR-transcoder capability only in
the MGW. On a call-by-call basis BSC and MSC would negotiate where to locate
the EFR-transcoding function. One strategy could be to first fill the EFR-TRAU
pool in the BSS and only when this is fully deployed locate the EFR-
transcoding
function for the next call within the MGW. The BSC would then for this next
call indicate that EFR is supported only with compressed on AoIP
Deployment scenarios 3a/3b are the most demanding scenarios in terms of
necessary signalling between BSC and MSC server.
**Deployment Scenario 4** : Transcoders are completely removed from the BSS.
IP transmission and compressed speech on A interface are mandatory. The Core
Network does not support AoTDM any longer. This is a proposed target
deployment scenario for a Transcoder-lessBSS. Transcoder resources only exist
in the MGW; IP transmission and compressed speech is used over the A
interface.
{width="5.510416666666667in" height="1.5520833333333333in"}
**Figure.5.2.4.4** : Deployment Scenario 4 for a New BSS
It is BSS-internal implementation strategy, whether to use existing BTSes with
TDM interfaces and convert to IP in a new functional device (e.g. TDM-IP
Converter), or to integrate the IP interface directly into the New BTS. The
TDM-IP Converter could also take care of BSS-internal handovers with
unmodified Codec Type, or a separate Handover-Handler could do that.
Introducing such a Transcoder-less BSS could be the simplest and most
efficient way for deployment of AoIP by two upgrading steps:
Step 1: Upgrade MSC Server and MGW to an Upgraded MSC Server and Upgraded MGW.
Step 2: Commission and deployment of Transcoder-less BSS.
This migration strategy may, however, require more interim Transcoder
resources in the Core Network.
After all BSS are upgraded to Transcoder-less BSS the final step could be to
remove all AoTDM support from the Core Network, i.e. migrate all MSC Servers
and MGWs to \"New\" ones.
## 5.3 Functional Impacts
This TR investigates the functional impact and required specification work for
the support of an A interface over IP.
### 5.3.1 G.711 and compressed speech over IP
\"A interface over IP\" requires to setup IP connections for each call. That
means IP terminations have to be seized on both sides of the A interface. The
related IP end point address information of the transport connection between
MGW and BSS must be exchanged. This will impact the assignment and handover
procedures of the BSSMAP protocol [6] and the GCP.
The payload formats need to be defined. It is proposed to adopt RTP/UDP/IP as
the user plane protocol stack.
An option is to use for PCM speech (i.e. G.711 A/u-law Codec) the RTP profile
according to RFC 3551 [19]. Furthermore for G.711 20 ms or 5 ms packetization
time may be used. The increase in speech path delay, when using 20ms
packetization time, is acceptable.
The RTP payload format for compressed speech shall be based on existing RFC
profiles, or, if needed RFCs may be created (e.g. for GSM_HR).
It is proposed to specify RTP bearers multiplexing and RTP header compression
as a means to achieve better bandwidth efficiency. 3GPP has already specified
for BICC-based circuit switched core networks (CNCS) an RTP bearers
multiplexing and RTP header compression scheme for Nb and similar work is
ongoing for SIP-I based CSCNs; the possibility to reuse these solutions shall
be studied.
Solutions based on tunneling E1 or other TDM channels over IP would remove one
main advantage of IP transport, which is the ability to dynamically set up
connections between the BSS and any MGW. Therefore it is proposed to exclude
those from the study.
When compressed speech is used on the A interface over IP, then it is easier
to achieve \"true end-to-end Codec negotiation\". The existing Codec
Negotiation within the Core Network as specified in OoBTC (see TS 23.153) and
the future Codec Negotiation in SIP-I (see TR 29.802) will benefit from better
knowledge about the BSS resource situation. This will improve the speech
quality further. \"True end-to-end\" Codec negotiation impacts the BSC,
because it should provide the CS core network with its Codec capability. A
Codec negotiation procedure between BSS and CN is required, having impacts on
the assignment procedure.
Having no transcoders in the BSS any more requires adaptations of the handover
procedures. When the handover requires a change of the Codec, then existing
mechanisms should be reused that involves the MSC Server. Intra BSC handover
that do not require a change of the Codec should be handled without MSC
impacts.
### 5.3.2 Support for Data and Fax Services
Regarding to the target deployment scenario where Transcoders are removed from
the BSS, a simple and economic migration procedure should be investigated.
AoIP must support data and fax calls. There are 2 approaches further discussed
in chapter 6.2 of this TR. The first one leaves rate adaptation functionality
in BSS and transfers 64 kbps over the A-interface using clearchannel according
to RFC 4040 [18] as RTP profile. The second one moves rate adaptation
functionality to the core network and needs new RTP profiles for the
A-Interface for lower bit rate.
### 5.3.3 Functional Impacts for Migration
To support smooth migration it should be possible to support transcoders
placed in the BSS as well as in the MGWs simultaneously, see deployment
scenario 1. Therefore on a call basis BSSMAP signaling is needed to decide
whether compressed or PCM (G7.11) coded speech shall be used on the A
interface. The BSC is impacted because even though it still controls the radio
Codec finally selected on the radio bearer it does not anymore control the
transcoder equipment for calls where the transcoder is removed from.
# 6 Study Results, User Plane
## 6.1 User Plane Principles
### 6.1.1 Transport network User Plane for A over IP
#### 6.1.1.1 PCM coded speech (G.711) over IP
The following figure shows the proposed protocol stack for the A interface
transport over RTP/UDP/IP.
* * *
G.711 RTP UDP IP Link layer Physical layer
* * *
#### 6.1.1.2 Compressed speech and data/fax over IP
Payloads of both speech and CS data/fax are encapsulated into RTP packet, and
are carried on the UDP/IP protocol. The specific carrying way at physical
layer and corresponding link layer of IP protocol are not limited. If Ethernet
is adopted, link layer will be MAC protocol, while if POS or IPoE1 is adopted
for carrying, link layer will be PPP protocol.
The user plane of the A interface is shown in figure 6.1.1.2.1.

**Figure 6.1.1.2.1:** User Plane: AoIP protocol stack
### 6.1.2 Transport network Control Plane for A over IP
It is proposed that the exchange of IP address and other transport related
information (see chapters 7.1 and 7.2) between the core network and BSS takes
place transparently via GCP and BSSAP.
### 6.1.3 Potential impact on the Nb and Nc interfaces
The transport of G.711-coded or 3GPP-compressed speech across the A-interface
over IP has not necessarily any impact on the Nb or Nc interfaces.
However, if end-to-end transcoding free operation is desired for all defined
3GPP Codec Types, then the Nb interface needs to transmit also GSM_FR- and
GSM_HR-coded speech. These two \"legacy\" Codec Types are currently not
allowed for the Nb interface, because no Nb framing is defined for these. All
other 3GPP Codec Types are already supported in the standards for Nb and Nc.
Nb framing may need to be specified for GSM_FR and GSM_HR for the case that
OoBTC/BICC is used on Nc. For the case that SIP-I is used on Nc only the RTP
Profile for GSM_HR needs to be defined. This could be based on\ RFC 3551 [19].
For the Codec Negotiation on the Nc interface these two Codec Types have
already a code point associated, see TS 26.103. Since no Nb framing exists
they can not be used on Nc so far.
## 6.2 Payload Formats
### 6.2.1 Existing TRAU Frames for Speech
This chapter discussed all control bits of the existing TRAU Frames to
identify, which are potentially needed in a future AoIP framing (i.e. RTP).
The discussion is performed for the example AMR, but the result of the
discussion can be applied to other speech Codec Types.
The conclusion first: the defined RTP profiles are sufficient for all GSM
Codecs except for GSM_HR for which a new RTP profile needs to be defined.
The detailed discussion follows below.
The existing TRAU frame layout for the FR_AMR identifies 25 \"C\"ontrol bits
for AMR [3]. Only these need discussion for AMR over AoIP. The synchronisation
bits and the The \"T\" bits at the end are not relevant for AoIP. The \"D\"ata
bits are contained in the RTP payload format for AMR.
**Table 6.2.1.1-1:** TRAU frame layout for the AMR_FR frame [7].

The TRAU Frames for other Codec Types are similar or simpler than for FR_AMR
and thus it is sufficient to analyse the FR_AMR case.
Detailed discussion on the control bits using description from [7] is provided
below.\ _All comments are edited in italic._
Detailed Description:
**Frame Type:** \ The coding of the Frame_Type (also called \"Codec_Type\")
for AMR is identical in uplink and downlink.\ C1...C5:\ **0.0.1.1.0** :
Adaptive Multi-Rate Codec.\ _Discussion: The Codec Type is included in the RTP
Header._
**Time Alignment Field:\** The Time Alignment Field (Bits C6...C11) is used to
carry either the Time Alignment Command (TAC), the Phase Alignment Control
(PAC) or the TFO and Handover Information. The Time Alignment Command is coded
as for the Full Rate and Enhanced Full Rate (clause 5.5.1.1.1).
Time Alignment Command (TAC):
In the uplink direction (BTS to TRAU) the TAC indicates the required timing
adjustment for the downlink TRAU frame to be made by the TRAU in 250/500Î¼s
steps.\ C6...C11:\ **0.0.0.0.0.0** No change in frame timing\ **0.0.0.0.0.1**
Delay frame 1 x 500Î¼s (send four additional T-Bit-pairs after the end of the
TRAU Frame)\ **0.0.0.0.1.0** Delay frame 2 x 500Î¼s (send eight additional
T-Bit-pairs after the end of the TRAU Frame)\ ...\ **1.0.0.1.1.1** Delay frame
39 x 500Î¼s (send 156 additional T-Bit-pairs after the end of the TRAU Frame)
(1.0.1.0.0.0 to 1.1.0.1.1.1: 16 code-points, unused, reserved)\ _Discussion:
support of Time Alignment for A over IP is FFS._
If Time Alignment is not supported then the corresponding control bits would
not be needed. Otherwise, possible solutions are investigated in sub-clause
6.5.
(1.1.1.0.0.0 to 1.1.1.0.1.1: 4 code-points, reserved for TFO)\ \
(**1.1.1.1**.0.0 reserved for TFO)\ _Discussion: TFO is not used for all calls
where the AMR transcoder is not in the BSS, but in the MGW. So these bits are
irrelevant for AoIP with compressed AMR speech on AoIP._ \ \ (**1.1.1.1.0.1**
reserved for AMR CMI/CMR Phase Alignment Command (PAC), no change in frame
timing)\ _Discussion: The RTP Profile transports both, the CMI and the CMR in
parallel. No change in CMI/CMR phase is necessary. So this code point is not
necessary in AoIP._ \ \ **1.1.1.1.1.0** Delay frame by 250Î¼s (send two
additional T-Bit-pairs after the end of the TRAU Frame)\ **1.1.1.1.1.1**
Advance frame by 250Î¼s (do not send the two T-Bit-pairs at the end of the TRAU
Frame).\ Discussion: See above comments on Time Alignment.
**Phase Alignment Command (PAC) (useful when TFO is not supported or
disabled):** [\ ]{.underline}The Phase Alignment Command (PAC) can be used by
the BTS to command the TRAU to change (invert) the phase of CMI/CMR,
respectively RIF, in downlink TRAU frames, see clause 6.6.1.2.1.\ C6...C11:\
**1.1.1.1.0.1** AMR CMI/CMR Phase Alignment Command (PAC), no change in frame
timing.
In No_Speech frames the Phase Alignment Command may optionally be transmitted
by one additional bit (PAB, see subclause 5.5.1.2.2) that allows a direct time
and phase alignment in one step.
_Discussion: no Phase Adjustment is needed any longer.\ This may as a
consequence result in up to 20ms more delay in DL for local MS-to-PSTN calls
and for all long distance calls where the (local) MGW must transcode._
**TFO Information** (defined when TFO is supported, see 3GPP TS 28.062
[16]):**[\ ]{.underline}** C6...C11\ **1.1.1.0**.0.0\ **1.1.1.0**.0.1\
**1.1.1.0**.1.0\ **1.1.1.0**.1.1\ **1.1.1.1**.0.0\ These five codes are
reserved for Tandem Free Operation (see 3GPP TS 28.062 [16]). They result in
no change in frame timing. If the BTS does not support TFO or TFO is disabled
these codes shall not be used in uplink and shall be ignored in downlink. The
procedure to exchange this information between BTS and TRAU is described in\
3GPP TS 28.062 [16].\ _Discussion: Not needed on AoIP._
**Request or Indication Flag (RIF):\** This flag indicates the phase of the
Codec_Mode_Indication (RIF == 0) respectively the Codec_Mode_Request (RIF ==
1). It has the same meaning in uplink and in downlink. Typically this flag
toggles every frame. Exceptions may occur at handover and CMI/CMR phase
alignment, see clause 6.6.1.2.1.\ _Discussion: The RTP Profile carries both,
CMI and CMR in parallel. So the RIF is not needed in AoIP._
**Uplink Frame Error (UFE):\** In downlink the UFE indicates that the most
recently received uplink TRAU frame had detectable errors. In uplink this bit
shall be set to \"1\".\ UFE == 0: \"Uplink Frame received with Errors\";\ UFE
== 1: \"Uplink Frame received without Errors\".\ Note: the UFE is not related
to the frame classification (Rx_Type) as computed by the BTS radio receiver.
It is related to inconsistencies in the TRAU frame synchronization, control
bits or CRCs within the TRAU frame.\ _Discussion: This is a question of link
supervision. It is assumed that new methods will be introduced._
**Config_Prot** \ This field is reserved for the Configuration Protocol in
case of Tandem Free Operation (see 3GPP TS 28.062 [16]). If the BTS does not
support TFO or TFO is disabled, then this field shall be set to \"0.0.0\".
**Message_No\** This field is reserved for the Configuration Protocol in case
of Tandem Free Operation (see 3GPP TS 28.062 [16]). If the BTS does not
support TFO or TFO is disabled, then this field shall be set to \"0.0\".\ In
AoIP TFO is not used\ _Discussion: TFO is not used for calls where the
transcoder is not longer in BSCs, but in MGW. So these bits are irrelevant for
AoIP._ \ \ **DTX in downlink requested (DTXd)\** See clause 6.6.2.2.\
_Discussion: The decision whether or not to use DTX shall be moved from the
BSC to the MSC.\ In end-to-end transcoding free operation this decision is
anyway on the distant side and it is therefore mandatory for the BSS to
support DTX in downlink always. So this bit is not needed in AoIP._
**TFO Enabled (TFOE)\** This bit enables or disables Tandem Free Operation in
the TRAU. If the BTS does not support TFO or TFO is disabled, then this bit
shall be set to \"0\". Coding:\ TFOE == 0: TFO Disabled;\ TFOE == 1: TFO
Enabled.\ _Discussion: Not needed in AoIP._
**Frame_Classification:\** This field classifies the contents of the TRAU
frame as seen by the radio receiver, see 3GPP TS 26.093 [17]:\ C21...C22:\ 1 1
\"Speech_Good\" the frame can be decoded without restriction\ 1 0
\"Speech_Degraded\" the frame might contain undetected errors\ 0 1
\"Speech_Bad\" the frame contains errors that can not be corrected\ 0 0
\"No_Speech\" the frame is not a speech frame, see below.
In the uplink direction the Frame_Classification is also called \"Rx_Type\"
and is always set by the BTS.\ \ In the downlink direction the
Frame_Classification is also called \"Tx_Type\".\ If Tandem Free Operation is
not ongoing, then the codes \"Speech_Degraded\", and \"Speech_Bad\" shall not
be used in the downlink direction. If Tandem Free Operation is ongoing, then
all codes may be used in the downlink direction. For the handling within the
downlink BTS, see 3GPP TS 28.062 [16]).\ *Discussion: The RTP Profile for AMR
contains this frame classification (to some extend).\ *
**Codec_Mode_Indication / Codec_Mode_Request:\** This 3-bit field has three
different meanings, depending on the Frame_Classification field and the
Request_or_Indication_Flag (RIF):\ If Frame_Classification is different than
\"0.0\" then this field contains\ either the Codec_Mode_Indication (CMI), if
RIF equals 0;\ or the Codec_Mode_Request (CMR), if RIF equals 1.\ If
Frame_Classification is equal to \"0.0\", i.e. when a No_Speech frame is
transmitted, then this field shall be set to \"0.0.0\". CMI and CMR are then
simultaneously transmitted in the Data Bits.\ The coding is identical in
uplink and downlink.\ C23 . C24. C25:\ 0 0 0 Codec_Mode 4,75 kBit/s\ 0 0 1
Codec_Mode 5,15 kBit/s\ 0 1 0 Codec_Mode 5,90 kBit/s\ 0 1 1 Codec_Mode 6,70
kBit/s\ 1 0 0 Codec_Mode 7,40 kBit/s\ 1 0 1 Codec_Mode 7,95 kBit/s\ 1 1 0
Codec_Mode 10,2 kBit/s\ 1 1 1 Codec_Mode 12,2 kBit/s\ The CMI indicates the
Codec_Mode to be used for decoding the associated speech parameters in the
same and the next frame. The CMR indicates the highest allowed Codec_Mode to
be used for encoding in the opposite direction.\ _Discussion: The RTP Profile
contains CMI and CMR in parallel._
### 6.2.2 RTP profiles for speech
#### 6.2.2.1 RTP profiles for G.711 encoded speech on the A over IP interface
Whenever PCM (G.711) encoded speech is used on the A interface, with or
without embedded TFO frames (TFO is optional), it is proposed to use RFC 3551
[19]. However, RFC 3551 [19] does not consider the embedded TFO frames. It
must therefore be ensured by other means that possibly inserted in-path
equipment is TFO compatible in case TFO is used.
**Working Assumption:\** For the case of PCM-encoded speech on AoIP 20 ms
framing is used.
#### 6.2.2.2 RTP profiles for compressed speech on the A over IP
The Codec Types that are currently used in GSM and the available RTP profiles
are listed below:
**GSM_FR:** RFC 3551 for GSM_FR
**GSM_HR:** No RTP profile exists.\ A new profile needs to be specified in
case GSM_HR is to be supported at the A-interface.\ **GSM_EFR:** RFC 3551 for
EFR\ **AMR:** RFC 4867 [25] for AMR. It covers both FR_AMR and HR_AMR.
**AMR-WB:** RFC 4867 [25] for AMR-WB. It covers FR_AMR-WB.
**Working Assumption:\** For the case of compressed speech on AoIP 20 ms
framing is used.
#### 6.2.2.3 RTP profiles for compressed speech on Nb interface
While different approaches are applied to single-rate GSM Codec and multi-rate
GSM Codec at Nb interface. UP transparent mode is applied for single-rate GSM
Codec, and UP Support mode is applied for multi-rate GSM Codec as it is today.
### 6.2.3 RTP profiles for data and fax calls
#### 6.2.3.1 RTP profiles for data and fax calls with rate adaptation in BSS
In this **Alternative 1** [the legacy architecture split]{.underline} between
the GSM Radio Access Network and the Core Network for data and fax calls [is
kept]{.underline}. In uplink direction the BTS extracts the payload of the CS
data or fax service from the radio interface and rate-adapts it to 16 kbps via
four V.110 frames with 72 bits each and sends this in TRAU frames (or E-TRAU
frames) in uplink every 20ms. Between 300 bps and 14.4 kbps net bit rate of
data may be contained in this uplink stream on one 16kbps Abis/Ater link.
The TRAU (or an equivalent function) in BSS extracts the data from these TRAU
frames and rate-adapts them to 64 kbps.
In case of [High Speech Circuit Switched Data]{.underline} (HSCSD) up to four
of these channels are multiplexed within the BSS into one 64kbps stream. Up to
4*14.4kbps = 57.6kbps net bit rate of data may be contained in this uplink
stream on one A-Interface.
The transmission on the A-interface over IP uses a 64 kbps channel carried
over IP. The RTP profile defined in RFC 4040 is used for this purpose. This
RFC has been created for the purpose of transparently transporting a 64 kbps
channel over IP. The data rate on the A-Interface is comparably high and
constant.
The default Packetization Time is 20ms. If 1+1 redundancy is applied, then the
delay is increased by 20ms, if this redundancy is exploited at receiver side.
The service is processed comparably at reverse direction from IWF to MGW to
BSS to BTS and to the downlink radio interface.
**Working Assumption** : This Alternative 1 is the default,
[mandatory]{.underline} Alternative for all BSS and Core Networks for AoIP,
mainly for backward compatibility and ease of migration. The packetization
time for this alternative 1 is fixed to 20ms. It will not be negotiated.
#### 6.2.3.2 RTP profiles for data and fax calls with rate adaptation in CN
In this **Alternative 2** [the legacy architecture split]{.underline} between
the GSM Radio Access Network and the Core Network for data and fax calls [is
modified]{.underline}. In uplink direction the BTS extracts the payload of the
CS data or fax service from the radio interface and rate-adapts it to 16 kbps
via four V.110 frames with 72 bits each and sends this in TRAU frames (E-TRAU
frames) in uplink every 20ms. Between 300 bps and 14.4 kbps net bit rate of
data may be contained in this uplink stream on one 16kbps Abis/Ater link.
Maybe we need to consider also 8 kbps and 64 kbps here?
So far this is as in Alternative 1.
Some new function in the BSS extracts the data from these TRAU frames and
directly encapsulates four V.110 frames of 72 bits, as carried in one TRAU
frame of 16kbps sub-multiplexing (see 3GPP TS 48.060), into one RTP packet and
sends it to the MGW.
The default Packetization Time is 20ms. If 1+1 redundancy is applied, then the
delay is increased by 20ms, if this redundancy is exploited at receiver side.
**A new RTP Profile needs to be defined.** The average bandwidth on the
A-Interface is about 4 times smaller than in Alternative 1 and also constant.
Between 300 bps and 14.4 kbps net bit rate of data may be contained in this
uplink stream on one A-Interface RTP stream.
The case of [High Speech Circuit Switched Data]{.underline} (HSCSD),
especially the question, where the combining is performed, is FFS.
The MGW performs Rate Adaptation to 64kbps (new functionality) and delivers
the resulting frames to the Interworking Function (IWF) for processing as
today. In an alternative (new) implementation (e.g. if MGW and IWF are
integrated) the IWF gets the RTP packages with V.110 frames directly.
The service is processed comparably at reverse direction from IWF to MGW to
BSS to BTS and to the downlink radio interface.
**Working Assumption** : This Alternative 2 will not be included in the Stage
3 Technical Specifications.
## 6.3 Transport Layer
### 6.3.1 Link Layer and Physical Layer
Neither link layer nor physical layer need to be standardized.
### 6.3.2 UDP and IP
IPv.4 (RFC 791 [21] and RFC 792 [22]) is proposed to be mandatory.\ IPv.6 (RFC
2460 [23] and RFC 4443 [24]) is proposed to be optional.\ In this way, lack of
IPv.6 support will not delay the introduction of AoIP.
UDP is specified in RFC 768 [20].
Each user plane connection is identified by an IP address and an UDP port
number in the MGW and another IP address and UDP port number in BSS. These
addresses are exchanged via GCP and BSSAP prior to user plane establishment.
The port numbers that are exchanged are the port numbers associated with the
RTP data stream. These port numbers are even. Corresponding odd port numbers
are used for the associated RTCP protocol.
RTP/UDP/IP packets multiplexing mechanism already defined for Nb interface in
3GPP TS, 29.414 may be re-used on AoIP.
### 6.3.3 RTP
See above.
### 6.3.4 RTCP
RTCP is a control protocol included in the RTP specification. The multiplexing
mechanism mentioned in chapter 5.3.5 makes use of RTCP messages to control
multiplexing.\ Other usage of RTCP is ffs.
### 6.3.5 IP Multiplexing
In order to increase bandwidth utilization on the A-interface, multiplexing
several RTP/UDP/IP packets together into larger but fewer IP packets should be
specified as optional functionality. It is proposed to re-use the mechanisms
already defined for the Nb interface in 3GPP TS 29.414. These mechanisms
require the usage of RTCP for negotiation of multiplexing between the nodes.
## 6.4 Handover Procedure (User Plane)
### 6.4.1 Alternative 1
#### 6.4.1.1 General Handover Procedure
For all solutions allowing compressed speech over the A interface the
assignment procedure at Call Setup, including the enhanced Codec negotiation
(as described in chapter 6.2), strives at best possible Codec setup to best
speech quality end-to-end. In the ideal case in a future architecture with
AoIP there is no transcoder in the BSS and also the MGW uses transcoders only,
if the call terminates in the PSTN or the Codec negotiation did not succeed in
end-to-end transcoding free operation.
Following the call setup there may be several reasons for BSS to change cell
and/or Codec Type and/or Codec Configuration. Also the Interface Type (AoIP or
AoTDM) may change. These changes may have influence on the User Plane.
#### 6.4.1.2 Intra-BSC Handover to a compatible target cell
It is assumed that the IP-address-plus-UDP-port does not change at Intra-BSC
Handover with compatible Codec Type, Codec Configuration and unmodified
Interface Type (BSS-internal implementation). The MGW sees only some
irregularities in the uplink RTP stream.
#### 6.4.1.3 Intra-BSC Handover to an incompatible target cell
At Intra-BSC handover and Intra-cell handover, if the BSC cannot or do not
want to keep the Codec Type or Codec Configuration compatible, or if there is
need to change the Interface Type (AoIP to AoTDM or vice versa), then the MGW
shall add a new termination towards the target cell and handle the handover
like in Inter-BSC handover, see below. As an exception, if the BSS supports
transcoding between the Codec used in the source cell and the one used in the
target cell, it can still handle the handover like in the \"Intra-BSC Handover
to a compatible target cell\" scenario described above.
#### 6.4.1.4 Inter-BSC Handover
At Inter-BSC handover the MGW will see for a transient time two terminations
towards the radio interface, one to the old, serving BSC and one to the new,
target BSC. The Codec Types, Codec Configuration and Interface Types may be
compatible or different on both MGW terminations. It is up to the MGW to
insert necessary transcoding equipment and to perform proper handover
handling. Details do not need to be standardized.
### 6.4.2 Alternative 2
In case of A over IP when compressed speech is transported over A-interface,
if handover occurs and voice Codec in the Um interface has changed, the MGW
needs to change its Codec Type accordingly. It can be achieved by BSS sending
a Channel Modify Prepare message to MSC server (below shown as alternative 1
in subclause 7.4.2.1).
Another alternative (below shown as alternative 2 in subclause 7.4.2.2)
solution can be user plane inband adaptation.
## 6.5 Time Alignment
### 6.5.1 Introduction
One of the features to improve end to end speech delay in GSM and UMTS is the
Time Alignment feature. Time Alignment provides a mechanism for aligning the
phase of the release of packets by the Media Gateway to the phase at which the
BSS or the RNC transmits packets downstream to a given mobile station. In
doing so, queuing delay and buffer memory resources in the BSS / RNC are
reduced and downlink delay can be decreased by up to 20 ms.
The support of the Time Alignment feature for A over IP solutions as well is
evaluated in the present section in the scope of the \"A interface over IP\"
Study Item aiming at ensuring that the \"End-to-end speech delay shall not be
increased\" (requirement 14 in section 4 of the present document).
### 6.5.2 Time Alignment principles
In this sub-clause the Time Alignment (also referred further to as \"TA\")
feature is described as it works for the UTRAN Iu interface [14]. For GSM the
same function is used but is internal to the BSS where the transcoder is
located (see sub-clause 6.2.1). If the transcoder is moved to the Core Network
as being allowed for \"A interface over IP\" solutions, TA information would
need to be exchanged between the BSS and the CN.
For UTRAN the Time Alignment function is intended to align the phase of the
MGW to that of the RNC to minimize RNC queuing delay and memory resource
utilization. The MGW combines speech samples into 20 ms frames and compresses
them by the AMR encoder. Compressed speech packets are sent to the RNC, which
will in turn send them downstream according to a fixed phase. Because MGW and
RNC are not synchronized, RNC has to queue compressed packets until the proper
transmit time. Added queuing time/delay due to the phase mismatch can range
from 0 up to 20 ms. The RNC measures the queuing delay and sends a TA request
to the MGW for a phase adjustment based on the measured queuing delay. The MGW
adjusts the framing boundary to match the requested phase (see figure
6.5.2.1).
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="2.4194444444444443in"}
Figure 6.5.2.1 MGW phase matching
In figure 6.5.2.2 below, **a** , **b** and **c** represent different phases of
arrival of packets (e.g. pertaining to different voice channels) from the MGW
to the RNC. **The values da** , **db** , and **dc** , represent the queuing
delay due to arrival of the phases **a** , **b** and **c** , respectively, as
measured between the time of arrival of packet to the RNC and the time of
transmission from RNC. In the example below the phase of **b** is better than
**a** , and **a** is better than **c** (due to lower delay). The purpose of TA
for the RNC is to request the appropriate phase shift (based on measured
queuing delay) from the MGW, in order to minimize the RNC queuing delay. TA
also reduces the amount of time that RNC buffer resources are allocated to a
given channel. Since the transmission period is 20 ms, the alignment of
arrival phase to transmission phase can reduce the RNC queuing delay by up to
20 ms.
{width="6.84375in" height="2.060416666666667in"}
Figure 6.5.2.2 RNC Time Alignment
It should also be noted that in case of G.711 usage on A interface (voice
transcoders in the BSS), Time Alignment feature could avoid considering the 5
ms packetization and the drawbacks of the resulting overhead (four times the
20 ms packetization overhead due to multiple packet headers).
### 6.5.3 Time Alignment performances evaluation
The ability of Time Alignment to satisfy the optimal phase requested by the
BSC (RNC) depends on the number of channels processed on the same CPU, as well
as the processor load; this is due to the fact that independent channels
processed on the same Media Gateway (MGW) CPU may have overlapping phase
requirements. As such, the overlap of optimal phase among channels sharing the
same CPU will act to diminish TA effectiveness. A lower loading factor will
reduce the overlap, thereby increasing TA effectiveness. Also, a higher CPU
channel capacity is likely to improve TA effectiveness in a statistical sense,
since a larger number of channels should allow for a better statistical spread
of optimal phases.
Given the considerations above, a set of results have been produced for
different CPU capacities, and for different loading factors in each case. More
specifically, figures 6.5.3.1, 6.5.3.2 and 6.5.3.3 provide the cumulative
delay distribution for CPU channel capacities of 10, 20 and 40, respectively,
representing different DSP device generations, each at loading factors of 50%,
75% and 100%. For reference, in each case the cumulative delay distribution
when TA is not supported is also provided.
{width="5.388194444444444in" height="3.0076388888888888in"}

channels

channels

**Figure 6.5.3.3:** Cumulative delay distribution for a CPU capacity of 40
channels
A number of observations are made with respect to figure 6.5.3.2, which can be
taken to be representative of contemporary CPU capacity:
\- With TA, a CPU running at full load can eliminate queuing delay for over
30% of the calls. By contrast, without TA the 30%-channel count with lowest
queuing delays will still experience delays of up to about 7 ms.
\- The percentage of calls experiencing no queuing delay with TA increases
with reduced load, such that at 50% load about 70% of calls will experience no
queuing delay. Without TA, the 70%-channel count with lowest queuing delays
will have queuing delays up to about 14 ms.
\- With TA, over 99% of the calls will experience queuing delay of less than 3
ms at full load. This delay figure is reduced with reduced CPU load; at 50%
load, over 99% of calls will have queuing delay of less than 2 ms. Without TA,
regardless off the CPU load, only 15% of calls will have queuing delay of 3 ms
or less, and only 10% of calls will have queuing delay of 2 ms or less; all
other calls will experience queuing delays of up to 20 ms.
Figure 6.5.3.3 shows that all of the performance figures cited above will
further improve as more modern DSP devices provide increased CPU capacity.
### 6.5.4 Proposed implementation
The following considerations should be kept in mind for deciding on a given
implementation path:
\- The feature should be optional in order to not constraint product
implementation / usage in networks for which the feature is not felt needed.
\- The standardization effort should be kept as a minimum in order to avoid
delaying the completion of the A over IP work.
A possible implementation could be based on a simplified version of the UP
(User Plane) protocol currently specified for the Iu and Nb interfaces (see
[14], [15]). This solution implements a request PDU, an acknowledgement PDU
and a timer providing the necessary means to support the TA feature (see
figure 6.5.4.1).
{width="2.604861111111111in" height="2.5215277777777776in"}
**Figure 6.5.4.1:** Successful Time Alignment procedure
Should the receiving MGW be in \"TrFO mode\", it shall relay the TIME
ALIGNMENT PDU transparently from the A interface over IP protocol to Nb.
Should the receiving MGW be transcoding to G.711, it may process the request
or respond with a negative acknowledgement indicating it either doesn\'t
support the procedure or it is not prepared to process the request at this
time. Should the BSS receive a negative acknowledgement, it should wait some
time before trying again.
The UP protocol on the A interface is based on RTP/UDP/IP transport and uses
an established RTP session for transferring frames between the two RTP
endpoints at both ends of the A interface User Plane access points. A single
PDU will be transported as RTP payload. Different PDU Types would allow
differentiating between user data transport (e.g. PDU Type 1 in [14]) and Time
Alignment control (e.g. PDU Type 14 in [14]).
Other features that are part of Iu / Nb UP protocols and are not required for
A over IP would not be ported to the A over IP UP protocol. The support of the
\"transparent\" mode of the UP protocol can be considered to avoid the
transmission of the UP header whenever the TA is not implemented / used.
This approach would:
\- Avoid the need to update the various RFCs for different Codecs and narrow
down the standardization work to 3GPP to prevent extra standardization delays.
\- Limit the standardization effort as the UP protocol specification is
already existing for Iu and Nb, and the UP protocol for A over IP would
consist in a be subset of the existing UP functions.
\- Maintain design coherence between Iu, Nb and A over IP interfaces.
\- Basically allows TA for being optional.
### 6.5.5 Summary
Time Alignment provides an enhancement of the end-to-end delay for A over IP.
It would therefore provide additional flexibility for the design and
management of the delay budget in reducing the downlink delay by up to 20 ms
for Land-to-Mobile calls (see sub-clause 6.5.3).
Time Alignment is available for GSM solutions with the transcoders in the BSS
(see [7] and [8]) and for UMTS on the Iu and Nb interfaces (see [14] and [15],
respectively). For GSM solutions with the transcoders in the Core Network,
porting the TA design elements into the definition of the new A over IP
interface would avoid restricting the usage of Time Alignment to established
architectures only and would maintain the consistency of 3GPP-based networks
regarding the support of this feature.
A solution based on a simplified version of the UP protocol currently
specified for the Iu and Nb interfaces would stringently limit the required
standardization effort to removing the features that are not required for A
over IP.
Preserving the optional nature of TA support for A over IP solutions as
provisioned by the original standard is felt essential for enabling vendors
and operators to take advantage of the feature, should they choose to do so,
while not enforcing extra implementation efforts wherever they are not felt
needed.
However, no consensus to support TA for A over IP was expressed during the
discussion.
**The current working assumption is that a mechanism to provide Time Alignment
is out of scope of a possible Work Item introducing A-interface over IP.**
# 7 Study Results, Control Plane
## 7.1 Control Plane Principles
Introducing IP as Transport Layer for the User Plane on the A-interface
necessitates accommodations of the BSSMAP and GCP signalling. The following
items are identified and discussed in the following sub-sections:
  1. Exchange of Transport Layer Information,\ i.e. exchange of IP-Address plus UDP-Port-Number between BSS and MGW
  2. Need for a Call Identifier for IP-based calls
  3. Exchange of Codec Information,\ i.e. BSS Capability and MSC Preference
  4. Location of Transcoder Resources in BSS or CN
  5. Exchange of RTP Parameters.
### 7.1.1 Exchange of Transport Layer Information
It is proposed that the A-interface User Plane connection between Core Network
and BSS is dynamically established for every call. Transport Layer information
has to be exchanged between the MGW and the MSC-Server (hereafter 'MSC') via
H.248 protocol and between the MSC and the BSS via BSSMAP.The following
information is identified as mandatory transport layer information:
> \- IP-Address
>
> \- UDP-Port-Number
>
> The conceptual view of the exchange procedure between MGW and MSC and
> between MSC and BSC is shown in figure 7.1.1.1.
{width="5.415277777777778in" height="2.1041666666666665in"}
**Figure 7.1.1.1:** Conceptual exchange of Transport Layer Information
After the MSC has received the Complete Layer 3 message and decided to
use/offer AoIP for the call the following signalling sequence is proposed:
  * The MSC sends an ADD.REQuest to the MGW to request the MGW to reserve the local IP Address and UDP Port. The MGW reserves the A interface IP termination and indicates the local IP address and UDP port number to the MSC in ADD.RESpond. That is done by using the existing H.248 procedure "Reserve RTP Connection Point".
  * The MSC forwards the MGW IP address and UDP port information in the new AoIP Container to the BSS using an enhanced BSSMAP Assignment Request message. The BSS performs channel assignment. As part of the assignment procedure the Transport Layer information of the local connection end point inside BSS is put into another AoIP Container, which is sent back to the MSC within the BSSMAP Assignment Complete message.
  * The MSC passes the received BSS IP address and UDP port to the MGW by using the existing procedure "Configure RTP Resources".
Figure 7.1.1.2 shows a possible signalling sequence to exchange Transport
Layer information between MGW and BSS.
{width="6.699305555555555in" height="4.271527777777778in"}
**Figure 7.1.1.2:** Exchange of Transport Layer Information via a new AoIP-
Container
It is for further study whether to use an AoIP-Container or to use individual
IEs for IP-Address and UDP-Port-Number.
**The current working assumption is to use an AoIP-Container in BSSMAP.**
### 7.1.2 Need for a Call Identifier for IP-based calls
In the legacy architecture, either the MSC or the BSC seizes a CIC (Circuit
Identity Code). If the MSC seizes the CIC, it sends it to the BSS at BSSMAP
Assignment Request. The CIC identifies a physical connection to be used in the
transport layer. This identifier is also used as Call Identifier Code.
For the new AoIP standard there is need for a similar Call Identifier Code
(named it here \"Call Identifier\"), by which an IP-based call in MSC and BSC
could be identified uniquely. This Call Identifier would be helpful in case
the SCCP connection between BSC and MSC gets lost and one side has to tell the
other, by means of the RESET RESOURCE message, which call has to be released.
The Call Identifier would be especially helpful in A-flex (MSC in Pool), where
in an error case a list of calls may need to be cleared. The Call Identifier
could be an IP-Version-independent (e.g. 32-bit) number, or it could be the
pair of (IP-address+UDP-port)s. The latter is -IP-Version-dependent and much
longer.
Another way of clearing calls could be to rely on User Plane RTCP signalling.
However, this would modify the current behaviour based on explicit BSSMAP
signalling.
**The current working assumption is to use BSSMAP signalling (RESET RESOURCE
and RESET RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE) to release hanging IP-based calls. The Call
Identifier is an IP-Version-independent 32-bit number, defined on a per MSC
basis. The Call Identifier is not used for TDM-based calls.**
### 7.1.3 Exchange of Codec Information
G.711 is used as Codec Type on the A-interface User Plane, when TDM is used as
bearer. Replacing the transport with IP suggests a change of the Codec,
because G.711 is not the most efficient Codec over IP. The 3GPP Codec Type
that is used on the air interface could be reused on the A-interface User
Plane, when IP is used as bearer, without any loss in quality. This is needed
at least when TrFO operation is required. This also supports the option of
moving transcoder resources from BSS to the Core Network.
### 7.1.3.1 Exchange of Codec Information at Call Establishment
The codec information has to be exchanged between MGW and MSC via H.248
protocol and between MSC and the user plane peer node in BSS via BSSMAP.
When the MSC reserves the (IP) termination in the MGW for the AoIP connection
endpoint, the MSC provides also Codec information to the MGW. It is proposed
to reuse the mechanism applied for the termination reservation on Mb and Nb
(SIP-I) (i.e. Reserve RTP Connection Point procedure).
The Codec information is provided in H.248 interface as defined in 3GPP TS
29.332 and 3GPP TS 29.232. The Codec Information passed to the MGW in
termination reservation phase reflects the "MSC-Preferred Codec Type and
Configuration", which has been determined by MSC after performing the codec
negotiation with the remote side MSC.
After MSC has reserved the (IP) termination, it constructs the MSC Preferred
Codec List (MSC-PCL) and initiates the codec negotiation towards BSS. The MSC
sends the Codec information (i.e. MSC-PCL) towards the BSS within the BSSMAP
Assignment Request message. The MSC-PCL contains the MSC Preferred Codec Type,
but also other, alternative Codec Types. The current Information Element
defined for AoTDM should be replaced, because in addition to the Codec Type
also Codec Configuration information should be sent in case of AMR and AMR-WB
Codec Types.
Therefore a new Information Element (called \"MSC-PCL\", MSC preferred Codec
List IE) is defined for transporting this Codec information to the BSS. The
MSC-PCL is a prioritized list of all Codecs offered to BSS for channel
assignment. The MSC-Preferred Codec Type is the first one in the MSC-PCL. It
matches the Selected Codec (SC) within the Core Network in the best possible
way. This MSC-PCL replaces the existing information (permitted speech version
identifier, also called Speech Coder Version List, SCVL) coded within Channel
Type IE octets 5, 5a, 5b and afterwards.
In addition the new MSC-PCL contains also information on transcoder resource
location and interface type.
The BSS has in principle the freedom to select any Codec Type from the
received MSC-PCL. The BSS is not mandated to select the MSC-Preferred Codec
Type, but it should do so whenever possible. BSS internal algorithms may
result in rare cases in the selection of another Codec Type from the MSC-PCL.
Therefore the BSS provides information about the finally chosen Codec
(\"Speech Version (chosen)\") within the BSSMAP Assignment Complete message.
If the chosen Codec is different to the MSC-Preferred Codec Type, already
selected within the MGW, then the MSC has to MODify the MGW termination with
the new Codec information.
**Note 1:** Also the information element \'Speech Version (chosen)\' should be
enhanced to include the chosen Codec Configuration for AMR and AMR-WB Codec
Types. It is proposed to introduce a new Information Element \"Speech Codec
(chosen)\" for that purpose.
In order to reduce the number of case, when the BSS has to select a Codec Type
different from the Codec Type prioritized by the MSC, the BSS informs the MSC
for each call about the availability of resources to support different 3GPP
Codec Types. This information has to be provided [before]{.underline} the MSC
starts the end-to-end Codec Negotiation.
**One proposal** is to use a \"per call\" approach by introducing a new
Information Element \"BSC-SCL\" (BSC Supported Codec List), which the BSC
appends the BSC-SCL to the BSSMAP Complete Layer 3 Information message. If MSC
detects that this new BSC-SCL is related to a speech call, then it uses this
information for end-to-end Codec negotiation and for Codec pre-selection for
the RAN interface. In case MSC receives the information for any other
transaction (for example MSC receives BSC-SCL for a data call), it is proposed
to store this BSC-SCL in case a subsequent speech call is triggered
afterwards, where the stored BSC-SCL can be used for this speech call\'s Codec
negotiation.
{width="4.363888888888889in" height="6.653472222222222in"}
* pCodec = MSC Preferred Codec type
** Codec = Speech Codec (chosen), indicated to MGW if the chosen Codec is
different to the MSC-Preferred Codec Type.
**Figure 7.1.3.1.1:** Exchange of Codec Information "per call"
**Another proposal** is to provide BSC-SCL information for the whole BSS area
(all Codec Types in all cells) in one or more messages in a periodical or on-
demand manner. In these messages the BSS could report all its Codec
capabilities or only the Codec capabilities it wants to dynamically
communicate to the MSC. It would be up to BSS implementation and operators\'
deployment strategy (by O&M setting) to decide which of the actual Codec
capabilities should be reported. The MSC would have to store the whole list of
BSC-SCLs until a new update is available. The BSC-SCL information could be
sent by reusing and slightly expanding the existing two BSSAP messages
RESOURCE REQUEST/RESOURCE INDICATION pair (see TS 48.008) on a cell basis. The
overall architecture and signalling are shown in figure 7.1.3.1.1.
**Figure 7.1.3.1.2:** BSC-SCL information exchange \"per whole BSS\"
**Note 2:** If there is concern that the stored BSC-SCL can be outdated for a
subsequent speech call, an optional \'pull BSC-SCL\' procedure can be
implemented to fetch the up to date Codec capabilities of the BSC whenever
needed.
**Example:** The BSS decided to prohibit the usage of full rate channels due
to high load in the served cell. In that case the BSS indicates within the
BSC-SCL to MSC that only half rate Codec Types are allowed.
**The current working assumption is to transmit the BSC-SCL per call.**
**Note 3** : The default Codec Type GSM-FR shall never be excluded by the BSS
in the BSC-SCL, but it will be used only in very rare cases, e.g. when the MS
does not support any other Codec Type.
#### 7.1.3.2 Exchange of Codec Information at Handover
In the (traffic channel) handover procedure the BSSMAP Complete Layer 3
message is not always exchanged. The MSC does therefore not always receive the
Codec resource information (BSC-SCL) of the new, target BSS before it requests
channel assignment in the BSSMAP Handover Request.
In these cases the MSC has to guess what the target BSS supports. It can be
shown, that this is not a serious drawback. The best an MSC can do - in every
handover situation - is to offer a Codec Type that is compatible to the
already fixed SC in the Core Network as Preferred BSS Codec Type. If this
Codec is accepted by the target BSC, then the optimal Codec combination is
reached for this handover case. If this Codec is not accepted by the target
BSC, then there are good reasons and the early knowledge of the BSC-SCL could
not change these.
The MSC does in general also not know, which Interface Types (AoIP and/or
AoTDM) the target BSS supports for this handover event. Consider that an
Interface Type may not be provided at all, or it could be temporarily
unavailable, e.g. due to overload or failure. Therefore both Interface Types
may be offered in the MSC-PCL. Alternatively the MSC could use a \'pull BSC-
SCL\' procedure to get the most updated target BSC-SCL to construct the MSC-
PCL for the BSSMAP Handover Request message. This is, however, slower and
needs more signalling on the A-Interface and has no obvious strong advantage.
**The current working assumption is that it shall be possible for the CN to
offer both, AoIP and AoTDM, Interface Types in parallel, if the MSC has no
other information to decide the Interface Type. But offering two termination
types will not be mandatory. In this case, if the interface type chosen by the
MSC cannot be supported -- for that call - by the target BSS, a new reject
cause (e.g. \"interface not available\") shall be used, so that the CN can
issue a new request using the other interface type.**
The new, target BSC may provide its BSC-SCL in the BSSMAP Handover Request
Acknowledge message or in the BSSMAP Handover Failure message. The MSC may use
this information for the potential, optional subsequent Codec Re-Negotiation
procedures within the Core Network or to initiate a new channel assignment
request in case the first channel assignment request failed (rare case).
### 7.1.4 Location of Transcoder Resource in BSS or CN
The proposed new Information Elements (BSC-SCL and MSC-PCL) provide flexible
means to negotiate and select the location of the transcoder resource, if
needed, either within the BSS or within the Core Network. By flexible setting
different bits within the BSC-SCL, the BSC can indicate to the MSC for each
Codec Type, whether the BSS has the transcoder resource or not. The MSC can
indicate by setting the corresponding bits within the MSC-PCL, whether it
requests the BSS to support the transcoding to PCM or whether the BSS shall
not perform transcoding.
In this way the existing transcoder resources of a legacy BSS can be
efficiently reused after the upgrade to AoIP. Existing transcoder pools within
the BSS for a specific Codec Type can be expanded within the MGW for growing
traffic demands.
### 7.1.5 Exchange of RTP Parameters
The IETF-standardized RTP Profiles for 3GPP Codecs offer quite some
flexibility.\ Examples are: Payload Type, Redundancy, Packetization Time, etc.
These RTP Parameters must be either pre-defined per 3GPP- standardization
(simplest, but least flexible solution) or the exchange of these RTP
Parameters must be defined.
**The current working assumptions are:**
  * pre-defined fixed RTP Payload Type per Codec shall be used,
  * pre-defined fixed RTP parameters per Codec shall be used:\ no redundancy shall be used, one RTP packet shall include only one speech or SID frame
  * it shall be possible to use Redundancy for CS data services.
Some CSD services, especially fax, are sensitive to data loss. For those CSD
services without re-transmisson scheme in the application layer (e.g. fax),
the loss of data blocks will cause distortion in the transmitted data or maybe
even the failure of the service. Although IP is an effective transportation
bearer, it does have some inherent flaws and packet loss is one of them. When
transport link quality is not so stable (e.g. ADSL, microwave relay, etc.) or
when there is congestion, the loss of packets is almost unavoidable. Because
data redundancy will reduce the data loss rate caused by packet lost, it will
improve the successful rate of CSD services for AoIP.
For data redundancy, several successive data blocks are packed into one RTP
packet, just as shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2. The number of successive data blocks
in an RTP packet is defined as Redundancy Level. Redundancy Level 1 denotes
the transmission without redundancy. The redundancy level is 2 in Fig.1, where
altogether 5 (n) data blocks are transferred in 6 (n+1) RTP packets with a
substantially increased payload size (n*2+2). The redundancy level is 3 in
Fig.2, where altogether 4 (m) data blocks are transferred in six RTP packets
(m+2) and substantially increased payload size (m*3+2).
For redundancy level 1, if one RTP packet is lost, one data block is lost,
too. The delay is at its minimum. For redundancy level 2, if one RTP packet is
lost, no data block will be lost. The delay at receiver side is increased by
the need to wait for one more RTP packet. For redundancy level 3, if two
successive RTP packets are lost, no data blocks will be lost. The delay at
receiver side is increased by the need to wait for two more RTP packets.
The format of the payload in the RTP packet that contains redundant data
blocks could use the format defined in RFC2198. In order to protect the head
data block and tail data block, dummy data blocks are inserted. The inserted
dummy data blocks eliminate the extra delay at sender side otherwise caused by
data redundancy. The idle frame could be used as dummy data block. The dummy
data blocks do not eliminate the delay at receiver side, if the receiver
decides to deploy the redundancy. Redundancy increases the bandwidth demand
substantially and the number of RTP packets and the transmission delay
noticeably. A change of the redundancy level during a call causes a jump of
the delay in the data path and therefore (most likely) a loss or distortion of
data. Redundancy and the change of the redundancy level shall therefore be use
with care -- if at all.
**Redundancy is always used symmetrically, i.e. the same redundancy level is
used in both directions across the A-Interface.**
Fig.1 Redundant Packet with redundancy level = 2
Fig.2 Redundant Packet with redundancy level = 3
In general, the redundancy level of the RTP packet transferred on the
A-interface should be negotiable at Assignment Request and/or Handover
Request. It should be finally determined by the **_BSS_** according to the
wire (IP) link quality and the bandwidth resource. For bad IP link quality,
where the disturbance is fairly high, the redundancy level should be a little
higher; while for lack of bandwidth resource, the redundancy level could be
adjusted to a lower value to reduce the bandwidth cost.

A mapping between both representations is possible. This alternative coding is
used in OoBTC on Nc. It needs more octets per AMR Codec. It allows more
flexibility, but has the substantial drawback of higher risk of end-to-end
incompatibility, higher implementation and verification effort.
It is current working assumption to use set 0 to set 15 on AoIP.

#### 7.2.1.11 Circuit Switched Data Codec (CSD Dummy Codec)
In order to support a flexible migration from fax and data via 64k TDM lines
to fax and date via IP, considering the redundancy for better packet loss
resilience, it is proposed to define a "CSD Dummy Codec" for the BSC-SCL, the
MSC-PCL, the "Speech Codec (used)" and "Speech Codec (chosen)" and the "Speech
Codec (MSC Chosen)". This CSD Dummy Codec is handled formally like any other
(Speech) Codec in the call setup and handover negotiations.
The direct code-space for Speech Codecs has only 15 entries. But this CSD
Dummy Codec is not a Speech Codec and is used comparably rare and so a
somewhat less efficient coding is allowed. It is therefore proposed that the
coding for the Dummy Codec is using an "extension" mechanism (similar to TS
28.062): the Code-Point "0xF" indicates that in fact the next octet in the IE
contains the real 8-bit Code-Point for the Codec. The code-point for this Fax
and Data "CSD Dummy Codec" should be "registered" in TS 26.103. There are
already two other Dummy Codecs defined for Multi-Media Applications. They have
Code-Values 0xFF and 0xFE, so the proposed value 0xFD for **Circuit Switched
Data Codec** is the next choice, counting downwards.
As discussed in chapter 6 it is necessary to differentiate two A-Interface
Types for Fax and Data calls (the alternative 2, i.e. 16kbps, is not included
in the working assumptions):\ \- 64k over legacy TDM lines\ \- 64k over IP
using RFC 4040.\ Two bits are reserved to flag these A-Interface Types.
As discussed in chapter 6, redundancy should be an option. The redundancy
field contains two flags (R2, R3) **indicating the support of the Redundancy
Level** 2 (optional) and 3 (optional), while support of Redundancy Level 1 is
mandatory.. The redundancy levels are not depending on each other, it is for
example allowed to support redundancy level 1 and 3 without supporting
redundancy level 2.

**Note 1:** In BSC-SCL and MSC-PCL more than one of these A-Interface Types
and redundancy options may be flagged to allow an open negotiation and to
restrict the negotiation as far as necessary. But in "Speech Codec (Used)",
"Speech Codec (Chosen)" and "Speech Codec (MSC Chosen)"exactly one A-Interface
Type and one redundancy option shall be specified. Redundancy Level 1 is
specified by flagging neither R2 nor R3.
**Note 2:** the existing "Channel Type" IE contains all the other parameters
for fax and data calls. This Channel Type IE and the CSD Dummy Codec shall
contain consistent data.

## 7.3 Procedures
### 7.3.1 Codec Negotiation at Call Setup
An optimal end-to-end Codec Negotiation shall be performed for each individual
call to achieve best quality of service, considering the Codec capabilities of
the MS, the BSS as well as the CN and the distant end.
Figure 7.3.1.1a shows an example MS-to-MS call, with end-to-end Codec
negotiation at call setup.
BSC1 sends to MSC1 its actual \"BSC Supported Codec List\" (BSC-SCL1) in the
first Complete Layer 3 Message that encapsulates the DTAP CM SERVICE REQUEST
message from MS1. BSC1 shall predict to its best possible knowledge at this
point in time for this specific call, which Codec Types, Configurations and
Interface Types could be used in this specific cell area. BSC1 shall not
include Codec Types in this BSC-SCL1 that are currently not available.
The Codec capabilities of MS1 (MS-SCL1) are received in MSC1 in DTAP SETUP,
which includes also other call set up details. Upon receiving SETUP, MSC1
shall construct the SCL taking into consideration MS-SCL1, BSC-SCL1 as well as
MGW1 capabilities. MSC1 then initiates Codec negotiation through OoBTC (or
SIP-I) towards the terminating side, including the SCL.

**Figure 7.3.1.1a:** Example, end-to-end Codec negotiation at call setup, MS-
to-MS call\ If cRanC1 == SC == cRanC2 then the call is end-to-end transcoding
free
Upon receiving the terminating call attempt, MSC2 initiates paging of the
terminating subscriber. BSC2 sends to MSC2 its actual \"BSC Supported Codec
List\" (BSC-SCL2) in the first Complete Layer 3 Message that encapsulates
PAGING RESPONSE message from MS2.
MS2 sends its Codec capabilities to MSC2 in the DTAP CALL CONFIRMED message.
Upon receiving CALL CONFIRMED, MSC2 selects a pair of Codecs to be used for
the call, one for the Core Network (called \"SC\") and one for the terminating
RAN (called \"pRanC2\", Preferred RAN Codec). For that selection MSC2 takes
into consideration MS-SCL2, BSC-SCL2, MGW2 capabilities as well as the SCL
received from MSC1. In the optimal case SC and pRanC2 are identical or at
least compatible. MSC2 considers also possible Interface Types and Transcoder
Resource Locations. Of course also the Codec Configurations are pre-decided by
MSC2.
MSC2 then sends the SC back to MSC1.
MSC1 selects now the Preferred RAN Codec for the originating side (pRanC1),
taking the SC, the MS-SCL1, BSC-SCL1 and MGW1 capabilities into account. In
the optimal case SC and pRanC1 are identical or at least compatible. MSC1
considers also possible Interface Types and Transcoder Resource Locations. Of
course also the Codec Configurations are pre-decided by MSC1.
MSC1 and MSC2 start now in parallel to construct their offers to BSC1,
respectively BSC2.
The MSC-PCL1 contains pRanC1 as first, most preferred Codec Type for the
originating side.
The MSC-PCL2 contains pRanC2 as first, most preferred Codec Type for the
terminating side.
MSC1/MSC2 sends MSC-PCL1/MSC-PCL2 to BSC1/BSC2 in Assignment Request.
BSC1/BSC2 will most likely choose finally the Preferred RAN Codecs for the
respective radio interface.
When the Codec Type is negotiated on the A interface, also the Codec
Configuration, the location of the Transcoder resource and the Interface Type
are negotiated and decided. This secures the flexible configuration and
deployment of A over IP according to different network situations.
**Note:** TFO in the BSC-SCL and MSC-PCL is optional, but not mandated to be
configured or used.
For data and fax call, codec negotiation should also been carried out to
select the proper CSD Dummy Codec. The purpose of CSD codec negotiation is to
determine the A-interface type and the redundancy level. Figure 7.3.1.1b shows
an example with CSD Codec Negotiation for the A-interface transport link at
call setup. There are two differences between CSD Codec Negotiation and normal
Speech Codec Negotiation:\ 1\. Because the circuit-switch data link for the
A-interface will always be terminated in the MGW, CSD Codec Negotiation is not
an end-to-end procedure. The negotiation will be carried out by the two
involved MSC-BSS pairs separately, each as shown in Figure 7.3.1.1b.\ 2\.
Redundancy level Negotiation will only happen for the A-Interface transport
link and will not affect the air interface.
Figure 7.3.1.1b: Example redundancy level negotiation at call setup for a
data/fax call
BSC1 sends MSC1 its actual \"BSC Supported Codec List\" (BSC-SCL1) in the
first Complete Layer 3 Message. In BSC-SCL1, BSC1 uses the CSD Dummy Codec to
indicate its capability of supported A-interface type(s) and the supported
redundancy levels (RED-Levels BS1 = RED1-RED2-RED3 of BSS1).
After receiving BSC-SCL1, MSC1 shall tell BSC1 its preferred/supported
A-interface type(s) by considering the link resource of MGW1 and the
capability of BSC1 comprehensively. Besides that, MSC1 shall also tell BSC1
its preferred/supported redundancy levels (RED-Levels MP1) by considering the
link resource of MGW1 and the capability of BSC1 (RED-Levels BS1). The
preference of MSC1 is indicated by the CSD Dummy Codec(s) included in MSC-PCL.
MSC1 sends MSC-PCL to BSC1 in the Assignment Request message. BSC1 will make
the final decision of which A-interface will be used and which redundancy
level will be used (RED-Level BD1). Only redundancy levels that are supported
by both entities (BSS and MSC) may be used. BSC1 tells MSC1 its final decision
by the Speech Codec (Chosen) included in the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message. MSC1
informs MGW1 accordingly.
### 7.3.2 Codec Negotiation at Handover
The assignment procedure at Call Setup, including the enhanced Codec
negotiation, aims for best possible Codec setup for best speech quality end-
to-end, with the minimal number of transcoding stages in the path and the
minimal transport bandwidth. Aiming for improving the successful rate of CSD
services, the CSD Codec negotiation is performed in assignment procedure at
data/fax Call setup.
Following the assignment at Call Setup there may be several reasons for the
BSS to change the cell and/or the Codec Type and/or the Codec Configuration
and/or the Interface Type. The BSC shall always try to keep the Codec Type and
Codec Configuration compatible as well as keep the same Interface Type to
create least impact on Core Network and distant termination. Sometimes this
is, however, not possible.
For data/fax calls handover might cause the change of the redundancy level
used in A-interface and/or the type of A-interface. When the redundancy level
and/or the type of A-interface has to be changed, a new CSD Codec shall be
negotiated between BSS and MSC.
The following subchapters discuss different handover cases.
#### 7.3.2.1 Intra-BSC Handover to a Compatible Target Cell
For an intra-cell or intra-BSC handover to the same Interface Type and a
compatible Codec Type and Codec Configuration, the BSS handles the handover
internally. One important Intra-Cell handover case is the cell repacking for
higher radio efficiency under high load conditions. The handover from FR_AMR
to HR_AMR is such an example.
For data/fax call in AoIP, a compatible target cell means that the CSD Codec
will not be changed after handover, i.e., neither the type of A interface nor
the redundancy level should be changed after Handover.
The MSC is merely informed about the handover by the Handover Performed
message. A new BSC-SCL, containing the up-to-date Codec capability of the BSC
may be included in the Handover Performed message. The MSC may use this in
future e.g. at Codec re-negotiation towards the remote end.
For data/fax call in AoIP, the Handover Performed message may contain a new
BSC-SCL which include a new CSD Codec of the target BSS after handover. The
MSC may use this for future CSD Codec negotiation.
#### 7.3.2.2 Intra-BSC Handover to an Incompatible Target Cell
At intra-cell and intra-BSC handover, if the BSC has to change to an
incompatible Codec Type or incompatible Codec Configuration, or if there is a
need to change the Interface Type, the BSC shall inform the MSC.
For data/fax call in AoIP, an incompatible target cell means that the A
interface type and/or redundancy level should be changed after handover.
One important Intra-Cell handover case is the cell repacking for higher radio
efficiency under high load conditions. The handover from GSM_EFR to GSM_HR is
such an example. Important may be that this cell-repacking affects only some
of the calls in this cell, not all. The BSC-SCL is therefore often only
relevant for the specific call, not for the whole cell. One possible strategy
is -- for example -- to handover only calls with good to best radio conditions
from GSM_EFR to GSM_HR, while keeping calls with low radio conditions in
GSM_EFR. Also starting new calls may preferably be done in GSM_EFR, until the
radio condition is known and a subsequent repacking to GSM_HR is possible. In
this way the overall speech quality is optimized on cost of more frequent
handovers. This Intra-BSC handover is therefore important and should be
performed with minimal impact and delay.
In general, the Intra-Cell handover will not affect the CSD Codec used for the
ongoing data/fax call because neither the type of A interface nor the
transport link for Abis and A interface will be affected by Intra-Cell
handover.
**One possibility** is to initiate a procedure similar to **Inter-BSC
handover** , i.e. Handover Required is send to the MSC, optionally including a
new, up-to-date BSC-SCL. This Handover Required may also include the new AoIP
Container for the new radio channel termination. The MSC may handle this
Intra-BSC handover like an Inter-BSC handover, see below. The advantage of
this possibility is that existing messages and procedures can be reused,
although new IEs have to be added. It needs further study how to handle the
potentially newly created SCCP connection between the MSC and the same BSC.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="4.134722222222222in"}
Figure 7.3.2.2.1**:** Intra-BSC Handover to a non-compatible Codec
**A second possibility** is to define a simplified **3-ways-signalling** [
]{.underline} MSC-controlled handover procedure, relying on the observation
that the source and the target BSS would be the same in this scenario so that
two messages used in the normal inter-BSC Handover procedure (namely the
\"Handover Request\" and \"Handover Request Acknowledge\" messages) would not
be needed.
A 3-ways-signalling procedure could be defined where the first message could
be a \"Channel Modify Required\" or a \"Internal Handover Required\" message
containing at least:
\- A target cell. This shall be a cell controlled by the same BSS
\- The up-to-date Codec capabilities in the target cell, i.e. the BSC-SCL
\- The new AoIP container with the new IP/UDP termination at the BSS for the
new radio channel termination.
When receiving the **\"Channel Modify Required\"** /\"Internal Handover
Required\" message from the BSS, the MSC would select its most preferred Codec
Type (pRanC) taking into account the BSC-SCL. The pRanC and the new IP/UDP
termination at the BSS would be communicated to the MGW in order to add
another termination towards the BSS. The MGW would then acknowledge the Add
request by sending back to the MSC the new IP/UDP termination at the MGW.
Similarly, for data/fax call, when receiving the **\"Channel Modify
Required\"** /\"Internal Handover Required\" message from the BSS, the MSC
would select its most preferred interface type and redundancy level (RED-Level
MP) by taking into account the BSC-SCL and the currently transport link
resource of MGW.
At this point in time the MSC could reuse existing messages on the A interface
to trigger the handover execution phase. In particular, to trigger the
handover, the \"Handover Command\" message would be sent to the BSS, including
the MSC-PCL (with pRanC as the first choice) and the new MGW IP/UDP
termination. A legacy handover procedure would be performed on the radio
interface and then the BSS would finally confirm the handover/Codec change to
the MSC with the \"Handover Complete\" message. See figure 7.3.2.2.2. For
data/fax call, the Codec(chosen) in "Handover Complete" message will indicate
the interface type and redundancy level chosen by BSS. In general, the whole
procedure illustrated in fig 7.3.2.2.2 is also applied to data/fax call.
{width="5.932638888888889in" height="5.036111111111111in"}
Figure 7.3.2.2.2: Simplified procedure for intra-BSS Handover to an
incompatible Codec\ (Codec change triggered by the BSS)
A variant of this procedure is also possible. For instance:
\- Instead of containing the BSC-SCL, the \"[Channel Modify
Required\"]{.underline}/\"Internal Handover Required\" could directly contain
the chosen Codec, i.e. the BSS could finally decide the Codec-type.
\- Instead of reusing the legacy Handover Command/Handover Complete handover
execution procedure, a new message could be defined to trigger the intra-BSS
handover and the Handover Performed message could be used to inform the CN of
the handover completion (in this case the Handover Performed message would be
used by the MSC-S as a trigger to remove the old MGW UDP/IP termination).
The advantages of a 3-ways-signalling MSC-controlled procedure would be a
faster handover handling.
The disadvantage could be higher implementation and verification effort.
The decision should be based on statistics from existing networks. If this
kind of Intra-BSC handover is expected to happen often, then the procedure
should be optimized. Otherwise the existing procedure should be sufficient.
**A third possibility** is to rely on **User Plane procedures** , whereby the
MSC allows multiple Codecs to be used in the MGW and whereby the BSS performs
a normal intra-BSS handover, finally sending the \"Handover Performed\"
message to the MSC, and the new target radio leg starts sending UL data to the
MGW (from a different, new BSS UDP/IP termination) encoded according the new
Codec Type. The MGW would have to detect the Codec change and, before
receiving any Control Plane message, add automatically a new termination to
the Context, if necessary with transcoder resources, and start sending DL data
to the new BSS UDP/IP termination encoded according the new Codec Type. In
uplink a smart handover combining could take place and finally the MGW would
send a Notify Request to inform the MSC. See figure 7.3.2.2.3.

**Figure 7.3.2.2.3:** User Plane procedure for intra-BSS Handover to an
incompatible Codec\ (Codec change triggered by the BSS)
**The suggested User Plane procedure seems attractive, but needs further study
and coordination with other groups (e.g. CT4).**
**The current working assumption is to introduce a simplified 3-ways-
signalling MSC-controlled handover procedure.**
#### 7.3.2.3 Inter-BSC Handover
Inter-BSC handovers can not be handled BSC-internally and the MSC and MGW need
to be involved, regardless whether or not the Codec Type, Codec Configuration,
A-Interface Type, redundancy level (for data/fax call) or Transcoder Resource
location has to be changed.
The source BSC sends Handover Required to the MSC.
As described above this Handover Required may optionally contain a new BSC-SCL
and a new AoIP Container for the Intra-BSC handover case. For the \'real\'
Inter-BSC handover case the source BSC is taken out of the call path and thus
it\'s BSC-SCL is useless.
The reason to include a new BSC-SCL (for Intra-BSC handover case) is to have
the latest BSC capability communicated to the MSC. The MSC could then decide
whether or not this new BSC-SCL is to be used e.g. in deciding the Codec Type
and Codec Configuration and Interface Type for the target cell for Intra-BSC
handover to an incompatible target cell. The MSC may also use this new BSC-SCL
after handover for Codec Re-Negotiation towards the remote end.
**For a real Inter-BSC handover,** MSC does _in general_ not know the target
BSC\'s capability. In that case the MSC may construct the MSC-PCL taking into
consideration the currently Selected Codec (Type and Configuration) on the Nb
interface. The first Codec in the MSC-PCL shall be compatible to the SC. The
other Codecs in the MSC-PCL are determined by the known MS-SCL and the MGW
capabilities.
For data/fax call, the CSD Codecs in MSC-PCL indicates the A interface types
preferred by MSC and the types will be ordered according to the preference of
MSC. CSD Codec in MSC-PCL also indicates the MSC preferred redundancy level,
which could be determined by the current transport link resource of MGW and
the redundancy level used by the old BSS.
In general the MSC does also not know the supported Interface Types of the
target BSS. Therefore the MSC may offer all Interface Types in the MSC-PCL,
which is send in the Handover Request Message. This Handover Request Message
contains also the AoIP Container, if AoIP is offered.
The target BSC selects finally the Codec Type, Codec Configuration,
A-Interface Type, redundancy level (for data/fax call) and Transcoder Resource
Location out of the MSC-PCL. The target BSC reports this back to the MSC in
Speech Codec (chosen), included in Handover Request Acknowledge. This Handover
Request Acknowledge contains also the AoIP Container, if AoIP is chosen and
the new, up-to-date BSC-SCL*.
The MSC updates the MGW accordingly. If more than one Interface Type was
seized in the MGW, then the not used one has to be SUBtracted from the MGW
context.
If, for whatever reasons, the MSC knows the capabilities of the target BSC,
partly or fully, then the MSC may pre-decide the Interface Type and offer only
one Interface Type in MSC-PCL. In that case the update of the MGW is sometimes
not necessary (except the MODification of the connection address). See figure
7.3.2.3-1 below.
{width="5.988888888888889in" height="3.6347222222222224in"}

Interface Type
### 7.3.3 Codec Re-Negotiation after Inter-BSC Handover
After the handover is completed and the BSC-SCL of the now serving BSC and the
Speech Codec (chosen) is known to the MSC, the MSC may (optional) evaluate,
based on the SC and the Available Codec List received earlier from the distant
call leg, whether or not Mid-Call Codec Re-Negotiation may result in a better
overall end-to-end Codec selection. For data/fax call, MSC may also initiate
the procedures to adjust the currently used A-interface type. Different from
Speech Codec Re-Negotiation, the CSD Codec re-negotiation procedure in
data/fax call is not an end-to-end one. It only happens between a MSC and its
connected BSS.
One important scenario for such a potential Codec Re-Negotiation is the
upgrade from narrowband (NB) speech telephony to wideband (WB) speech
telephony, when the old BSC was not able to support AMR-WB, but the new BSC is
capable to offer AMR-WB speech.
Although Codec Re-Negotiations are currently possible within the Core Network,
there is currently no defined procedure to trigger a Codec change from the
Core Network to the BSS.
One possibility for the Core Network to trigger a Codec Type change (e.g. to
re-establish TrFO) could be to trigger a new assignment procedure on the same
SCCP connection. This approach would reuse existing messages, but there could
be a few drawbacks as well:
  * A new Assignment message would replace the UDP/IP termination at the BSS (and at the MGW), but it would be preferable to have the 2 terminations (old and new) in place during the Codec change, like in the handover case
  * The Core Network would not be aware of the current BSS capabilities when initiating the new Assignment procedure.
In fact, the main issue is to provide a mechanism whereby the BSS informs the
Core Network about the Codec Types it can support for the ongoing call, before
the Core Network triggers a Codec change. Although the BSS communicates its
Codec capabilities at call setup, this is a dynamic information related to a
specific time instant in a specific cell so that this might change in time,
e.g. due to overload conditions. Therefore a mechanism is needed to update
this information for an ongoing call.
One possibility would be to rely on the simplified MSC-controlled handover
procedure defined in section 7.3.2.2, in this case initiated by a preliminary
signalling message sent by the MSC to the BSS to trigger a feedback from the
BSS about its current Codec capabilities regarding a specific ongoing call.
This message could be named \"Channel Modify Enquiry\" or \"Internal Handover
Enquiry\", and it would be different from a legacy \"Handover Request\" sent
to the target BSS during the preparation phase of an inter-BSS handover: its
goal is to get back the updated BSS Codec capabilities to handle a specific
call and no specific target cell is indicated in the message (the primary goal
is to change the Codec, not necessarily the cell, and typically an intra-cell
handover would be finally triggered in this case). On the other hand a MSC-PCL
(MSC-Preferred Codec List) could be included in the \"Internal Handover
Enquiry\" message to inform the BSS about the MSC Codec preferences. If the
goal is to re-establish TrFO, the MSC-PCL in this case should reflect the
remote end indicated Codec. The BSS might use this information to decide a
possible target cell that meets such requirements.
The BSS response to the \"Channel Modify Enquiry\"/\"Internal Handover
Enquiry\" message would be the \"Channel Modify Required\"/\"Internal Handover
Required\" message described in the section 7.3.2.2. The target cell indicated
in the message could be the same cell where the call is currently ongoing;
alternatively this could also be a cell where the BSS could better satisfy the
MSC Codec preferences expressed in the MSC-PCL contained in the \"Internal
Handover Enquiry\" message. The current BSC-SCL and the new UDP/IP BSS
termination for the new radio channel termination would also be added.
As described in section 7.3.2.2, when receiving the **\"Channel Modify
Required\"** /\"Internal Handover Required\" message from the BSS, the MSC
would select its most preferred Codec Type (pRanC) taking into account the
BSC-SCL. If the goal of the Codec change is to re-establish TrFO, and the BSS
could not meet the request in the MSC-PCL contained in the \"Internal Handover
Enquiry\" message (i.e. if the BSC-SCL in the \"Internal Handover Required\"
message does not contain the MSC-PCL), then the MSC could also decide it\'s
not beneficial to finally trigger a Codec change and could avoid sending the
Handover Command at all (of course this means that TrFO would not be re-
established at the end). In data/fax call, if MSC preferred CSD Codec is the
same to the BSS selected CSD Codec, MSC could send the Handover Command to
change the interface type used by BSS. Otherwise, MSC should avoid sending out
the Handover Command message.
Note: One possible way for the MSC to detect whether the BSS is actually
waiting for the Handover Command is to add a flag in the \"Internal Handover
Required\" message to clarify whether this message is:
> \- sent by the BSS in response to an \"Internal Handover Enquiry\" -> the
> BSS doesn\'t have a real need to perform the intra-BSS HO -> no problem if
> Handover Command is not received;
>
> \- sent by the BSS because of a real need to perform the intra-BSS HO (e.g.
> to an incompatible Codec Type) -> Handover Command is finally expected.
If the MSC decides to continue with the handover, the message exchange with
the MGW and the signaling procedure on the A interface for the handover
execution phase would be the same as described in section 7.3.2.2 The overall
procedure is described in figure 7.3.3.1.

Figure 7.3.3.1: Codec change triggered by the Core Network
**Note:** A potential, optional Codec Re-Negotiation may lead to a change of
all Codecs in the speech path, also the one just selected by the BSC during
handover. This will result in a short interruption of the speech path and it
costs not negligible signalling load.
Codec Re-Negotiation is therefore considered as optional.
The definition of the triggers to initiate a Codec Re-Negotiation is not in
the scope of a possible Work Item on \"AoIP\".
## 7.4 Impacts on the A Interface Control Plane
In this section some examples are provided showing how the relevant
Information Elements could look like.
### 7.4.1 New Information Element: BSC-SCL
As described above a new Information Element (BSC-SCL) is defined to transfer
the BSC capabilities from the BSC to the MSC in the Complete L3 message at
call setup. This BSC-SCL is constructed as shown above and reprinted here for
ease of reading:

_optional_

_conditional_
* * *
The table shows a maximum-length example of a BSC-SCL. In a specific call case
the sequence of Codecs and the number of Codecs may vary. It is allowed to
flag more than one Interface Type for a given Codec Type. In case of AMR and
AMR-WB it is also allowed to flag more than one Configuration (set).
The BSC-SCL is not ordered according to any preference. It must at least
contain the GSM_FR Codec Type with at least one Interface Type.
The BSC informs the MSC by BSC-SCL, which Codec Types, Codec Configurations,
Interface Types and Transcoder Resource Locations it supports in this very
moment for this very call.
For each Codec Type, there are four bits to indicate the Transcoder Resource
location, the Interface Type and the optional support of TFO. These four bits
are:
**Full IP**
> \'1\' means: AoIP with compressed speech via RTP/UDP/IP is supported for
> this Codec Type.\ No Transcoder resource is necessary in BSS.\ If Full IP is
> selected, then the Codec Type on the radio interface\ is identical to the
> Codec Type on the A-interface
>
> \'0\' means: compressed speech via RTP/UDP/IP is not supported for this
> Codec Type.
**TFO**
> \'1\' means: TFO supported for this Codec Type
>
> \'0\' means: TFO is not supported for this Codec Type
>
> TFO is only applicable, if at the same time the Interface Types PCMoIP
> and/or PCMoTDM\ are set to \'1\', too.
**PCMoIP**
> \'1\' means: A Transcoder Resource for this (radio) Codec Type may be
> located in BSS.\ PCM may be transmitted over the A interface with
> PCM/RTP/UDP/IP.\ If this Interface Type is selected, then the Codec Type on
> the radio interface is different to the\ Codec Type on the A-Interface
> (PCM).\ If TFO is supported then the parameters of the radio Codec may be
> tunnelled through the\ PCM link on the A interface.
>
> \'0\' means: PCM over A interface with IP as transport is not supported for
> this Codec Type
**PCMoTDM**
> \'1\' means: A Transcoder Resource for this (radio) Codec Type may be
> located in BSS.\ PCM may be transmitted over A interface with TDM.\ If this
> Interface Type is selected, then the Codec Type on the radio interface is
> different to the\ Codec Type on the A-Interface (PCM).\ If TFO is supported,
> then the parameters of the radio Codec may be tunnelled through the\ PCM
> link on the A interface.\ \'0\' means: PCM over A interface with TDM as
> transport is not supported for this Codec Type.
**Note:** Full IP, PCMoIP and PCMoTDM can be simultaneously supported in the
same BSC.
**Example 1:** For the target Deployment Scenario, with only compressed speech
over AoIP, the coding of these four bits for all supported Codec Types would
be:
* * *
**Full IP** **TFO** **PCMoIP** **PCMoTDM** 1 0 0 0
* * *
**Examples 2 to 5:** For deployment scenarios, where the transcoders may
reside either inside the BSS or in the Core Network and where the Codec Type
may be supported for either TDM or IP or both, the coding of these four bits
in the BSC-SCL can for example be one of the following configurations:
* * *
**Full IP** **TFO** **PCMoIP** **PCMoTDM** 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
* * *
The coding of BSC-SCL gives the flexibility to allow different location of
Transcoder resources for different Codec Types, i.e. for one Codec Type the
Transcoder may be located in the BSS and for another Codec Type the Transcoder
can be located in core network (or is not needed at all). It is even possible
to allocate for the same Codec Type for one call the Transcoder within the BSS
and for another call within the CN.
### 7.4.2 New Information Element: MSC-PCL
A new Information Element \"MSC-PCL\" is defined to transfer the MSC preferred
Codec List from the MSC to the BSC at call setup and in handover cases. This
MSC-PCL is constructed as shown above and reprinted here for ease of reading
in the order of decreasing speech quality:
* * *
# Comments Coding mandatory\

_2_ _Length_ _\"Length of IE after length byte\" = 11_ _mandatory_

_13_ _Codec_ _Full IP_ _TFO_ _PCMoIP_ _PCMoTDM_ _\"HR\" = 0001_ _optional_
* * *
The table shows a maximum-length example of an MSC-PCL. In a specific call
case the sequence of Codecs and the number of Codecs may vary. It is allowed
to flag more than one Interface Type for a given Codec Type. In case of AMR
and AMR-WB it is also allowed to flag more than one Configuration (set).
The MSC-PCL is ordered according to the MSC preference with the highest
priority Codec being put at the top of the list. The MSC expects the BSC to
choose the preferred Codec Type. It must at least contain one Codec Type with
at least one Interface Type. The MSC informs the BSC by MSC-PCL, which Codec
Types, Codec Configurations, Interface Types and Transcoder Resource Locations
it supports in this very moment for this very call.
For each Codec Type, there are four bits to indicate the Transcoder Resource
location, the Interface Type and the optional support of TFO. These four bits
are:
**Full IP**
> \'1\' means: AoIP with compressed speech via RTP/UDP/IP is supported for
> this Codec Type.\ No Transcoder resource is necessary in BSS.\ If Full IP is
> selected, then the Codec Type on the radio interface\ is identical to the
> Codec Type on the A-interface
>
> \'0\' means: compressed speech via RTP/UDP/IP is not supported for this
> Codec Type.
**TFO**
> \'1\' means: TFO supported for this Codec Type
>
> \'0\' means: TFO is not supported for this Codec Type
TFO is only applicable, if at the same time the Interface Types PCMoIP and/or
PCMoTDM\ are set to \'1\', too.
**PCMoIP**
> \'1\' means: A Transcoder Resource for this (radio) Codec Type may be
> located in BSS.\ PCM may be transmitted over the A interface with
> PCM/RTP/UDP/IP.\ If this Interface Type is selected, then the Codec Type on
> the radio interface is different to the\ Codec Type on the A-Interface
> (PCM).\ If TFO is supported, then the parameters of the radio Codec may be
> tunnelled through the\ PCM link on the A interface.
>
> \'0\' means: PCM over A interface with IP as transport is not supported for
> this Codec Type
**PCMoTDM**
> \'1\' means: A Transcoder Resource for this (radio) Codec Type may be
> located in BSS.\ PCM may be transmitted over A interface with TDM.\ If this
> Interface Type is selected, then the Codec Type on the radio interface is

> then the parameters of the radio Codec may be tunnelled through the\ PCM

> transport is not supported for this Codec Type.
Full IP, PCMoIP and PCMoTDM can be simultaneously supported in the same
MSC/MGW.
If more than one Interface Type is flagged in the MSC-PCL, then the priority
order is per definition:\ Full IP > PCMoIP+TFO > PCM oTDM+TFO > PCMoIP >
PCMoTDM.
### 7.4.3 New Information Element: Speech Codec (Chosen)
The existing Information Element \"Speech Version (Chosen)\" is not sufficient
for AoIP, because neither Codec Configuration nor Interface Type nor
Transcoder Location can be specified. It is therefore proposed to introduce a
new Information Element \"Speech Codec (chosen)\".
* * *
**#** **Comments** **Coding** mandatory\  
or optional
_1_ _IE-Identifier_ _\" Speech Codec (chosen)\"_ _mandatory_
_2_ _Length_ _\"Length of IE after length byte\" = 1, 2, 3_ _mandatory_

* * *
Speech Codec (Chosen) shall contain exactly one Codec Type with one Codec
Configuration (conditional) with one Interface Type and the exact Transcoder
Location.
### 7.4.4 New Information Element: Speech Codec (Used)
The existing Information Element \"Speech Version (Used)\" is not sufficient
for AoIP, because neither Codec Configuration nor Interface Type nor
Transcoder Location can be specified. It is therefore proposed to introduce a
new Information Element \"Speech Codec (Used)\".
* * *
**#** **Comments** **Coding** mandatory\

_2_ _Length_ _\"Length of IE after length byte\" = 1, 2, 3_ _mandatory_

* * *
Speech Codec (Used) shall contain exactly one Codec Type with one Codec
Configuration (conditional) with one Interface Type and the exact Transcoder
Location.
**Note:** It is for further study if and where and when Speech Codec (Used) is
necessary for AoIP.
**Current Working Assumption is that Speech Codec (Used) is necessary, e.g.
for Inter-MSC Handover.**

# 10 Summary and Conclusion
This Technical Report shows the feasibility for introducing the User Plane
transport over IP for the A-interface (BSS -- MGW interface) into 3GPP
specifications.
In particular it\'s possible to define a solution that, at the same time:
  * will benefit from the flexibility of the IP transport on the A-interface,
  * will improve bandwidth efficiency through the use of 3GPP Codecs on the A-interface,
  * will allow to reuse installed Transcoder equipment,
  * will allow to remove Transcoders from the BSS,
  * will enable TRanscoder Free Operation (TrFO) in the BSS,
  * will maximize the likelihood for end-to-end TRanscoding Free Operation and therefore improve the service quality compared to existing TDM-based BSS.
A detailed analysis has been performed for all requirements, except:
  * 7) All teleservices, bearer services, VGCS and supplementary services defined for GSM shall be supported on the BSC-MGW interface\ Comment: Not studied in full detail, but no issues are expected.
  * 13) GSM/AMR Codec adaptation shall be possible, e.g. due to overloading of the BSC or radio conditions. The GSM/AMR Codec adaptation delay shall be in the same order as in the current A-interface solution.\ Comment: This requirement could be understood as \"Codec Type\" adaptation or as \"AMR Codec Mode\" adaptation. AMR Codec Mode adaptation is addressed under Requirement 18, see below. Codec Type adaptation has been studied in chapter 7. Several feasible solutions have been identified.
  * 14) End-to-end speech delay shall not be increased. Congestion in the IP transport may introduce additional delay; however the end-to-end delay shall not exceed the ITU recommendation [G.114]\ Comment: Not studied in the present TR. This will be investigated further. It is, however, expected that the selected solution complies with this requirement.
  * 15) It shall be possible to secure the BSC-MGW interface (see item e) below.\ Comment: Not studied in full detail, but the same method as for SIGTRAN should be applicable.
  * Speech interruption times during handovers shall be in the same order as in the current TDM implementations\ Comment: Not studied in the present TR. This will be investigated further. It is, however, expected that the selected solution complies with this requirement.
  * The interaction of dynamic AMR Codec change and TrFO shall not degrade the overall quality of the speech in the case of MS to MS calls.\ Comment: Not studied in full detail. No issues are expected because AMR Codec Mode adaptation for MS-to-MS calls in transcoding free operation is already specified in TS 45.009.
From the items under \"further investigation\" two items have not been
addressed in detail:
  * _e) Since IP transport is vulnerable to unauthorised intrusions, > security aspects shall be investigated\ > _Comment: Not studied in full detail, but the same method as for > SIGTRAN should be applicable, see requirement 15.
  * _Support for GAN\ > _Comment: Not studied in detail, no issues expected.
The investigated solution allows a smooth migration from the legacy, TDM-based
A-interface to the new, IP-based A-interface.
Working Assumptions were formulated to guide the specification phase.
The investigated solution assumes support on the MSC-MGW- (Mc) and the MGW-
MGW- (Nb) interfaces and therefore cooperation with CT and SA groups is
required.
A new Work Item for the specification work shall be defined to progress and
finalize the work within REL-8.
