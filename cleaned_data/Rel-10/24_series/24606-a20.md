# 4 Message Waiting Indication (MWI)
## 4.1 Introduction
The **Message Waiting Indication (MWI)** service enables the network, upon the
request of a controlling user to indicate to the receiving user, that there is
at least one message waiting.
## 4.2 Description
### 4.2.1 General description
The MWI service enables the AS to indicate to the subscriber, that there is at
least one message waiting.
The indication is delivered to the subscriber\'s UE after successful
subscription to the Message Waiting Indication service as described in the
present document.
Other modes of MWI service invocation are not applicable.
NOTE: Having received this indication, the subscriber user can subsequently
access the message account, to have the deposited message delivered. The means
by which the subscriber accesses and manages the message account are outside
the scope of the present document.
## 4.3 Functional entities
### 4.3.1 User Equipment (UE)
The UE shall implement the MWI Subscriber User Agent role as described in
subclause 4.4.1.
### 4.3.2 Application Server (AS)
An AS shall implement the role of a MWI Notifier User Agent as described in
subclause 4.4.2.
An AS implementing the role of MWI Notifier User Agent shall implement the
role of the AS acting as terminating UA as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [2],
subclause 5.7.2.
Additionally an AS may implement other roles for the receipt and storage of
the messages for example Web Server, Mail Transfer and Delivery Agent, Short
Message Service centre, etc.
The definition of additional roles for an MWI AS is out of the scope for the
current specification.
## 4.4 Roles
### 4.4.1 MWI Subscriber User Agent (MSUA)
A MSUA is an entity that is subscribed or requests information about status
change of message account from an MWI AS.
Actions performed by a MSUA as a part of the UE are described in subclause
4.7.2.1.
### 4.4.2 MWI Notifier User Agent (MNUA)
The MNUA is an entity that provides information about changes in message
account status to the MSUA.
Actions performed by a MWI Notifier User Agent as a part of the AS are
described in subclause 4.7.2.5.
### 4.4.3 Message Account (MA)
#### 4.4.3.0 General

intended to a particular subscriber.
#### 4.4.3.1 Identification of the message account for the message deposit
Since messages may be intended to the different public user identities that
belong to the same subscriber, the message account may be configured to retain
messages for any of the subscriber\'s public user identities.
Configuration of a message account to retain messages for each public user
identity, for a group of public user identities or for all of public user
identities that belong to the same subscriber is subject to the operator\'s
policy.
#### 4.4.3.2 Identification of the message account for the MWI subscription

service any of a subscriber\'s public user identities can be used (see
examples in subclause A.1.1.2).
## 4.5 Operational requirements
### 4.5.1 Provision/withdrawal
The MWI service is provided after prior arrangement with the service provider.
The MWI service shall be withdrawn at the subscriber\'s request or for
administrative reasons.
Any of the subscriber\'s public user identities can be used to access the MWI
service, see annex B.
### 4.5.2 Requirements on the originating network side
No specific requirements are needed on the originating network side.
NOTE: Annex B includes an example of an iFC that can be used to invoke the MWI
supplementary service.
### 4.5.3 Requirements in the network
No specific requirements are needed in the network.
### 4.5.4 Requirements on the terminating network side

###### ## Annex A (informative): Example signalling flows of Message Waiting
Indication (MWI) service operation
# A.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for the Message Waiting
Indication service within the IM CN subsystem based on the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP).
## A.1.1 Introduction
### A.1.1.1 General
The signalling flows provided in the following subclauses follow the
methodology developed in 3GPP TS 24.228 [12]. The following additional
considerations apply.
### A.1.1.2 Key required to interpret signalling flows
The key to interpret signalling flows specified in 3GPP TS 24.228 [12]
subclauses 4.1 and 4.2 applies with the additions specified below:
  * mwi.home1.net: an MWI AS in the home network of the service provider;
  * user1_public1\@home1.net: subscriber\'s first public user identity assigned to the message account;
  * user1_public2\@home1.net: subscriber\'s second public user identity assigned to the message account;
  * user2_public1\@home2.net: first correspondent of messages in the message account;
  * user3_public1\@home3.net: second correspondent of messages in the message account.
Each signalling flow table contains descriptions for headers where the content
of the header is new to that signalling flow, as is already performed in 3GPP
TS 24.228 [12].
However, 3GPP TS 24.228 [12] includes extensive descriptions for the contents
of various headers following each of the tables representing the contents of
the signalling flows. Where the operation of the header is identical to that
shown in 3GPP TS 24.228 [12], then such text is not reproduced in the present
document.
Headers following the tables that are represented in **_fat cursive_** style
describe the contents of the application/simple-message-summary MIME body.
Additional text is also found on the contents of headers within 3GPP TS 24.228
[12] in addition to the material shown in the present document.
## A.1.2 Signalling flows demonstrating how UE subscribes to message waiting
indication event notification
### A.1.2.1 Introduction
Subclause A.1.2 covers the signalling flows that show how UE can request
message waiting indication information from an application server.
### A.1.2.2 MWI Subscriber subscribing to the status of his message account,
MWI AS is in the subscriber\'s network
Successful subscription, UE in visited network. This example shows the case
when the originating S-CSCF, routes the SUBSCRIE request to an AS that
provides the MWI service, based on the resolution of the public service
identity of the message account.
For the purpose of the subscriber\'s identity verification, the AS is located
within the same trusted domain as the subscriber, see 3GPP TS 24.229 [2]
subclause 5.7.1.4.

Figure A.1: UE subscription for the message-summary event package
Figure A.1 shows a user equipment subscribing to the message waiting
indication notification. The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1\. **SUBSCRIBE request (UE to P-CSCF) - see example in table A.1**
A subscriber agent in a UE wishes to receive message waiting indication
information from an application server. To initiate a subscription, the UE
generates a SUBSCRIBE request containing the \"messageâ€‘summary\" event that it
wishes to be notified of, together with an indication of the length of time
this periodic subscription intends to last.
Table A.1: SUBSCRIBE request (UE to P-CSCF)

Content-Length: 0
**Request URI:** Public service identity of the user of the message account
whose events the subscriber subscribes to. In this case the subscriber
subscribes to the message waiting indication events.
**Event:** This field is populated with the value \"message-summary\" to
specify the use of the Message Summary Package.
**Accept:** This field is populated with the value \"application/simple-
message-summary\" as described in RFC 3842 [3].
**To:** Same as the Request-Uri.
2\. **SUBSCRIBE request (P-CSCF to S-CSCF) - see example in table A.2**
The SUBSCRIBE request is forwarded to the I-CSCF.
The P-CSCF looks up the serving network information for the public user
identity that was stored during the registration procedure. The SUBSCRIBE
request is forwarded to S-CSCF#1. A Route header is inserted into SUBSCRIBE
request. The information for the Route header is taken from the service route
determined during registration.

3\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
The S-CSCF validates the service profile of this subscriber and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. Assuming that sip:user1_mwiacc1\@home1.net is a
statically created PSI, sip:user1_mwiacc1\@home1.net is included in the
service profile of user1_public1\@home1.net as part of an originating initial
Filter Criteria with Service Trigger Point of Method = SUBSCRIBE AND Event =
\"message-summary\" AND Request-URI = sip:user1_mwiacc1\@home1.net, that
informs the S-CSCF to route the SUBSCRIBE request to the application server
sip:mwi.home1.net.
If there is no initial filter criteria for this PSI
(sip:user1_mwiacc1\@home1.net), the assumption is that the PSI is a sub
domain-based PSI. The procedure defined in RFC 3263 [9] with DNS NAPTR and SRV
queries aligned with the operator policy is then be used for the resolution of
the PSI.
4\. **SUBSCRIBE (S-CSCF to AS) - see example in table A.3**
The S-CSCF forwards the SUBSCRIBE request to AS.

5\. **Identification of the message account and subscriber authorization**
Based on the Request-URI the MWI AS identifies the requested message account.
P-Asserted-Identity header information authorizes the subscriber to subscribe
to status change of the message account, as one of the identities is
authorized for this account.
In this example the authorization is successful, so the AS sends a 200 (OK)
response to the S-CSCF. If the previous condition failed, then a 403
(Forbidden) response would be sent to the S-CSCF.
> 6\. **200 (OK) response (MWI AS to S-CSCF) -- see example in table A.4**
The MWI AS forwards the response to the S-CSCF.

The S-CSCF forwards the 200 (OK) response to the P-CSCF.
8\. **200 (OK) response (P-CSCF to UE)**
P-CSCF forwards the 200 (OK) response to the UE.
9\. **NOTIFY request (MWI AS to S-CSCF) - see example in table A.5**
As required by the RFC 3265 [4] the MWI AS immediately after successful
subscription sends the NOTIFY request to the S-CSCF to synchronize the current
state of the message account at the subscriber\'s UE. This initial
notification contains no extended information about available message. Further
notifications sent by MWI AS is contain either extended or basic set of
message waiting information as described in\ RFC 3842 [3].
In this example it is assumed that the message account at the moment of
subscription has thee voice messages (two new and one old, with one new
message being urgent), one old video message and two fax messages (one new and
one old with the old message being urgent).

>
> **_Fax-Message_ :** The MWI AS populates this filed with the information

12\. **200 (OK) response (UE to P-CSCF)**
The UE acknowledges the NOTIFY request with a 200 (OK) response to the P-CSCF.
15\. **notifications on message-summary event package**
After the MWI AS generated a NOTIFY request to inform the subscriber\'s UE
about the subscription state, the MWI AS waits for the change of the message
account status. As soon as new messages(s) are deposited into the message
account the MWI AS generates a NOTIFY request to indicate the change in the
message account status to the subscriber\'s UE.
16\. **NOTIFY request (AS to S-CSCF) -- see example in table A.6**
The MWI AS uses available information from the interaction with correspondents
and message left in the message account to fill the headers in the simple-
message-summary MIME body of the NOTIFY request. This notification sent by the
MWI AS contains an extended set of message waiting information about newly
deposited messages since the last notification as described in RFC 3842 [3].
In this example it is assumed that the subscriber\'s message account has

message) since the successful immediate NOTIFY transaction from the
correspondents sip:user2_public1\@home1.net and sip:user3_public1\@home3.net.

Figure A.5: Correspondent depositing a message into the subscriber\'s MA
Figure A.5 shows a correspondent user equipment creating, interacting over RTP
and terminating a session with the MWI AS. The details of the signalling flows
are as follows:
1\. **INVITE request (Correspondent to P-CSCF) -- see example in table A.15**
A correspondent wishes to initiate a session with the MWI subscriber. To
initiate the session, the correspondent generates an INVITE request to MWI
subscriber.

The message body includes the SDP information.
2\. **INVITE request (P-CSCF to S-CSCF) -- see example in table A.16**
The INVITE request is forwarded to the S-CSCF in MWI subscriber\'s home
network.

3\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
The S-CSCF validates the service profile of this subscriber and evaluates the
initial filter criteria. Assuming that MWI service is included in the service
profile of user1_public1\@home1.net as part of an terminating initial Filter
Criteria with Service Trigger Point of Method = INVITE AND Request-URI =
sip:user1_public1\@home1.net AND subscriber state = logout, that informs the
S-CSCF to route the INVITE request to the application server sip:mwi.home1.net
when the state of [user1_public1\@home1.net]{.underline} is logout.
4\. **INVITE (S-CSCF to AS) -- see example in table A.17**
The S-CSCF forwards the INVITE request to AS.
