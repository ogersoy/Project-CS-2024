# 4 Background
There are two new bands: 3.4-3.6 GHz and 3.6-3.8 GHz decided for Broadband
Wireless Access, which are already widely available for licensing in Europe.
These bands have earlier been allocated to the Fixed Service on a primary
basis in Region 1. Furthermore, the 3.4-3.6 GHz band was allocated to the
mobile service on a primary basis and identified for IMT at WRC 07.
These bands constitute a substantial amount of spectrum that _will be_
available in many countries in the short term. In Europe (Region 1) both bands
can be used so block sizes could be large for any duplex arrangement.
The ECC Decision (07)02 [7] not only designates the band 3.4-3.8 GHz for BWA
deployment, it provides condition for 'flexible usage modes within authorised
BWA deployments'. This regulatory provision will allow licence holders to
deploy various types of terminal stations, from fixed to mobile.
## 4.1 Task description
The purpose of this work item is to:
\- Study of UMTS/LTE 3500 for a potential deployment in Europe as well as in
other regions. The current band plans, where they exist, shall be studied with
respect to feasibility for WCDMA as well as LTE and band arrangement shall be
proposed for all applicable regions.\ Generate a new technical report based on
study results.
\- The specific bands to be studied are:
\- 3.4-3.6 GHz
\- 3.6-3.8 GHz
\- Generate CR's to update the appropriate documents. All CRs will be
delivered as one complete package for UMTS and LTE.
\- TSG RAN WG2 - study signalling issues related to UMTS/LTE 3500.
\- The WI should introduce the UMTS/LTE 3500 in the specifications for
UTRA/E-UTRA.
\- Any additional related issues.
# 5 Frequency band arrangements
The description of band arrangements in this clause is based on the input in
[4], [5] and [6], which is also summarized in [3].
In Europe, a majority of countries already license the band 3.4-3.6 GHz for
Fixed Wireless Access, in some countries also for mobile use. Licensing of
3.6-3.8 GHz for Wireless Access is more limited. CEPT/ECC has generated
documentation including a spectrum decision for 3.4-3.8 GHz with "Flexible
usage modes" for deployment of fixed, nomadic and mobile networks. A European
commission decision for harmonised conditions was made in May 2008 [21],
making the band 3.4-3.6 GHz available from 2008 and the band 3.6-3.8 GHz from
2012. Frequency arrangements considered in the ECC decision include FDD use
with 100 MHz block offset between paired blocks and/or TDD use as shown in
Annex A. It shall be noted that ECC PT1 is working on channeling arrangements
in the band 3400- 3800 MHz for IMT and plan to finalize a draft deliverable in
January 2011.
In Japan, not only 3.4-3.6GHz but also 3.6-4.2GHz will be available to
terrestrial mobile service such as IMT to use after 2010. No discussion has
started yet on the detailed frequency arrangements.
In Latin America, the band 3.4-3.6 GHz was licensed in Mexico and Peru to
operators that have acquired paired frequency blocks with 100 MHz separation.
Both FDD and TDD operation is allowed. The situation is similar in Argentina,
but blocks have been paired with both 50 and 100 MHz separation, see also
Annex C.
## 5.1 Band status in Europe
The source of this information is the contributions in [4] and [13].
### 5.1.1 CEPT/ECC studies and decisions
The band 3.4-3.8 GHz was studied extensively by CEPT Electronic Communications
Committee (ECC) in the last few years, resulting in several reports,
recommendations and decision [7,8,9,10]. The studies clearly identify the band
3400-3600 MHz as the widest available choice for current and future BWA
deployment in Europe. The band 3600-3800 MHz is identified as a possible
additional or alternative frequency band. An ERO survey indicated that a clear
majority of European countries already use the 3400-3600 MHz band for Fixed
Wireless Access (FWA), while the use of the 3600-3800 MHz band for wireless
access systems was limited to a few European countries at the time of the
survey (2006). In some countries the bands are licensed also for mobile use.
The ECC Decision (07)02 [7] designates the bands 3.4-3.6 and 3.6-3.8 GHz for
BWA deployment. The designation gives considerations for "Flexible usage
modes", allowing a license holder to deploy various types of terminal stations
for Fixed, Nomadic or Mobile Wireless Access (FWA, NWA or MWA). Technical
conditions for implementation of flexible usage mode are given in ECC
Recommendation (04)05 [8]. For Mobile Wireless Access, additional requirements
limit the radiated power, the TPC range and the block edge emissions.
WRC-07 identified the 3400 - 3600 MHz band for IMT in 41 European countries
and 40 others in Region 1. Therefore, the ECC has tasked ECC Project Team 1
(PT1) to develop appropriate ECC Deliverables which define band plans for the
usage of this band in the CEPT countries. The deliverables should also address
the band 3600 - 3800 MHz. According to the guidance given by the ECC, an
optimised solution has to be found for the band 3400 - 3800 MHz, which would
facilitate the convergence between cellular and broadband wireless access
systems already planned for the band 3400 - 3800 MHz in some European
countries.
### 5.1.2 European harmonised conditions for 3.4-3.8 GHz
CEPT/ECC has produced a report [10] to the European commission on BWA,
concluding that the deployment of fixed, nomadic and mobile networks is
technically feasible within the frequency band 3.4-3.8 GHz. Another CEPT/ECC
report to the commission on the technical conditions for different frequency
bands in the context of WAPECS[^1] also addresses 3.4‑3.8 GHz [9].
It is expected that early in 2008, there will be a European commission
decision to harmonise the conditions for the 3.4‑3.8 GHz band, where member
states shall allow the use of the band for fixed, nomadic and mobile
electronic communication services. The decision will include technical
conditions to ensure co-existence, but also allowing for less stringent
conditions to be applied if agreed between operators.
The band 3.4-3.6 GHz will be made available from 2008 and the band 3.6-3.8 GHz
from 2012.
### 5.1.3 Frequency arrangements
The ECC decision [7] considers that within the two frequency bands, pairing of
sub-bands 3400-3500/3500-3600 MHz and 3600-3700/3700-3800 provide suitable
frame conditions for FDD and TDD systems or their combination.
Two examples of frequency arrangements in line with those considerations are
given in the ECC Recommendation [8]. The example arrangements contain paired
blocks or combinations of paired and unpaired blocks, with a 100 MHz offset
between the paired low and high blocks. No specific consideration has been
made for the necessary duplex gap. The ECC example arrangements are shown in
Figure 5.1.3-1 and 5.1.3-2 below and are also discussed in [11].

and 3.6-3.8 GHz bands (from [8])
In the subclauses below, several regional band plans for the band 3400 to 3600
MHz in Europe are presented, which were collected from the various available
documents published by European administrations.
### 5.1.4 Band plan in UK
In the UK the 3400 to 3600 MHz band plan pretty much follows ECC REC (04)05
[8]. Spectrum is typically assigned in blocks of 20 MHz. Most of the spectrum
is assigned for PMSE ENG/OB applications. In this band also two blocks with a
duplex distance of 100 MHz are assigned to broadband wireless applications.
Figure 5.1.4-1: UK band plan for 3400 to 3600 MHz (source: [14])
### 5.1.5 Band plan in Germany
In Germany the 3400 to 3600 MHz band was auctioned in December 2006 for
broadband wireless access (BWA) systems. Figure 5.1.5-1 shows the band plan,
which was used for the auction. The band plan is based on a 7 MHz raster with
altogether 8 blocks. Two blocks with a duplex distance of 100 MHz are grouped
to one package:
\- Package A: 3410-3431 & 3510-3531 MHz
\- Package B: 3431-3452 & 3531-3552 MHz
\- Package C: 3452-3473 & 3552-3573 MHz
\- Package D: 3473-3494 & 3573-3594 MHz
Figure 5.1.5-1: Band plan Germany (source: [15])
From the band plan it can be seen that no external guard band between the
blocks is provided. The assignment of blocks is assumed under the provision of
ECC REC(04)05 [8], which defines an internal guard of half the system channel
bandwidth at the block edge. At the 3400 MHz boarder the first block starts at
3410 MHz with a guard band of 10 MHz to protect services below 3400 MHz.
### 5.1.6 Band plan in France
Also France is following in principle a similar approach like Germany. For BWA
three packets with two blocks each of 15 MHz in the 3.5 GHz band are defined.
Figure 5.1.6-1 shows the arrangement for BWA blocks.
Figure 5.1.6-1: Band plan France (source: [16])
The 3 packages (2x 15 MHz) have a duplex distance of 100 MHz with the
following arrangement:
\- Package A: 3432.5-3447.7 & 3532.5-3547.7 MHz
\- Package B: 3465-3480 & 3565-3580 MHz
\- Package C: 3480-3495 & 3580-3595 MHz
### 5.1.7 Band plan in Austria
As a further example of a European band plan, the band plan from Austria is
shown in Figure 5.1.7-1. In Austria two possible band plan arrangements are
available depending on the region. Like other countries (e.g. Germany or
France) the 3.5 GHz licenses are divided in different geographical regions,
however typically using the same band plan arrangement. Austria is divided in
six regions with the option that in each region either arrangement A, B and C
or the blocks D and E can be used. At the moment the arrangement D and E is
only used in one small rural region. In all the other regions the block
arrangement A, B and C is used.
Between the blocks an external guard band of 7 MHz is established and the
first block starts at 3410 MHz with a 10 MHz guard band to protect
applications below 3400 MHz. All blocks are based on a 7 MHz raster and two
blocks are grouped to a package with a duplex distance of 100 MHz:
Block arrangement 1:
\- Package A (2x 21 MHz): 3410-3431 & 3510-3531 MHz
\- Package B (2x 28 MHz): 3438-3466 & 3538-3566 MHz
\- Package C (2x 21 MHz): 3473-3494 & 3573-3594 MHz
Block arrangement 2:
\- Package D (2x 35 MHz): 3410-3445 & 3510-3545 MHz
\- Package E (2x 42 MHz): 3452-3494 & 3552-3594 MHz
Figure 5.1.7-1: Band plan Austria (source: [17])
### 5.1.8 Summary of band arrangement in Europe
At the recent ECC PT1 meeting, a report was put together based on an "ERO
questionnaire on the use of 3400-3600 MHz and 3600 - 3800 MHz bands" [19]. It
is based on the replies from 32 European countries, including the four
countries presently documented in the present document. The detail of
information reported differs from country to country, but for at least sixteen
countries there is detailed information of existing band arrangements,
channelization and duplex in the band 3400-3600 MHz. That information is
summarized below in Table 5.1.8-1 and also illustrated in Figure 5.1.8-1.

Several observations can be made when analyzing the survey results summarized
above:
\- Blocks with FDD arrangements are possible in all listed countries and TDD
arrangements in all but two.
\- For FDD arrangements, the duplex separation is consistently 100 MHz.
\- Block sizes are large, in general ≥14 MHz.
\- While there are some variations in the frequency ranges, only one country
has frequency blocks below 3410 MHz. For many countries, the frequency range
3400-3410 MHz is designated as a "guard band".
\- Most countries have frequency ranges ending at 3494 (and 3594) MHz, while a
few have the whole range up to 3600 MHz designated.
Several countries reference give reference to ERC Recommendation 14-03E Annex
B [20], where harmonised 100 MHz arrangements for these bands are given. The
arrangements in [20] are for channel spacing of 1.75, 3.5, 7 and 14 MHz, but
can easily be extended to multiples of those numbers, such as 21, 28, 35 and
42 MHz. The recommendation [20] also gives channel raster for the
arrangements. For any channel spacing ≥7 MHz, the edge of the uppermost
channel will be at 3494 MHz. This is also reflected in the frequency ranges
for the arrangements in these countries in Table 5.8.1-1.
The conclusion from the ERO survey is that an FDD arrangement where 3410-3500
MHz is paired with 3510-3600 MHz covers a substantial part of the existing
band arrangements in Europe.

### 5.1.9 Additional frequency arrangements in the 3.4-3.6/3.6-3.8 GHz band
The recently approved EC Decision 2008/411/EC for the identification of the
band 3.4-3.8 GHz for BWA applications [7] supports the introduction of
Mobility in the band 3.4-3.6 GHz and 3.6-3.8 GHz. This introduction should be
made according to some technical constraints reported in Annex to the
Decision; these constraints were identified by CEPT after careful study of the
consequences of the extension to Mobility of the usages in this band.
It should be noted that technical conditions in the Annex of the EC Decision
have been defined on the basis of full neutrality with no hypothesis of TDD of
FDD usage of any block; as a consequence the technical conditions at edge
blocks are very stringent. In case neighbour operators both use FDD or
synchronized TDD networks, these technical conditions could be considerably
relaxed.
Because of this technology neutrality, a plurality of allocation scenarios can
be met. These scenarios include:
  * Operation of TDD and FDD in adjacent frequency allocations
  * Operation of different or same RAT in adjacent spectrum blocks allocations
There are numerous cases where a part of the spectrum will be occupied by
another RAT, before LTE is deployed. It is important to offer dual operation,
or smooth migration to LTE perspectives.
The 3 following generic scenarios are described and commented in this
contribution. Note that these scenarios are compatible with the ECC
recommendation (04)05 [8]
Figure 5.1.9-1: Scenario A1 FDD and TDD in adjacent blocks
Figure 5.1.9-2: Scenario A2 FDD and TDD in adjacent blocks, variant of A1
Figure 5.1.9-3: Scenario A3 TDD only scenario
GB refers to guard bands which may be necessary between TDD and FDD blocks,
and possibly between TDD blocks when they are not synchronized, and frames
properly configured.
RB refers to Restricted Blocks. RB can be allowed provided that the risk of
adjacent channel interference is not increased.
Comments on scenarios:
**Scenario A1: FDD and TDD operation in adjacent blocks**
● As a consequence of their support to neutrality, CEPT and EC allow the
implementation of TDD solutions in paired blocks.
**Scenario A2: FDD and TDD operation in adjacent blocks (variant)**
● As a further improvement for the implementation of TDD, two TDD Operators
assigned with adjacent paired blocks are allowed to swap their spectrum to
create larger unpaired blocks.
**Scenario A3: TDD only operation in adjacent blocks**
● Note that guard bands may or may not be required depending on frame and
switching points alignments. Figure 5.1.9.3 assumes that Operator A operator B
are synchronized, while operators B and C are not synchronized.
## 5.2 Band status in Japan
The source of this information is the contribution in [5] and [13].
### 5.2.1 Information on the future usage of 3.4-4.2GHz in Japan
In Japan, not only 3.4-3.6GHz but also 3.6-4.2GHz will be available to
terrestrial mobile service such as IMT to use after 2010. No discussion has
started yet on the frequency arrangement (i.e. the band or part(s) of the band
should be TDD, FDD uplink or FDD downlink) in the band.
In addition, 4.4-4.9 GHz will also be available to terrestrial mobile service
such as IMT to use after 2010.
Figure 5.2.1-1 shows the spectrum allocation plan from the Ministry Internal
affairs and Communication in Japan.

## 5.3 Band status in Latin America
The source of this information is the contribution in [6].
Several countries in Latin America (Region 2) have auctioned spectrum in the
3.4-3.6 GHz band. Many of these bands are currently being used for broadband
wireless services. This paper gives some background information on the
allocation of spectrum in the 3.4-3.6 GHz band in three countries in Latin
America: Mexico, Peru and Argentina.
### 5.3.1 Mexico and Peru
In Mexico and Peru, the spectrum from 3.4-3.6 GHz was divided into 8 blocks of
25 MHz each. The blocks were auctioned off individually, but acquired in pairs
by operators. The result was 4 paired bands with 100 MHz offset between the
low and high band. Operation in both FDD and TDD mode is permitted in each of
these bands.
Figure 5.3-1 Band arrangement in Mexico and Peru
### 5.3.2 Argentina
Argentina also auctioned spectrum between 3.4 and 3.6 GHz. The blocks in
Argentina were also auctioned off individually, and acquired in paired by the
operators. Some of the blocks, as paired by the licensees, have 100 MHz of
separation and some have 50 MHz of separation. Operation in both FDD and TDD
mode are permitted in these bands.
## 5.4 Band status in North America
The source of this information is the contribution in [13].
### 5.4.1 US status
In the US in the 3.5 GHz band only 50 MHz of spectrum from 3650 to 3700 MHz
are available for terrestrial mobile applications. The band 3500 to 3650 MHz
is used by the federal government for high power radars and above 3.7 GHz the
band is used for broadcasting.
Figure 5.4.1-1: US band plan for 3.5 to 4.2 GHz
For the available 50 MHz the following FCC rules apply [18]:
\- Nationwide non-exclusive licensees for entire 50 MHz
\- Registration required for individual fixed stations operating under
nationwide license
\- 10 year license
\- Equipment employing unrestricted contention-based protocol (i.e. one
capable of avoiding co-frequency interference with devices using all other
types of contention-based protocols) may operate throughout the entire 50 MHz.
\- Equipment incorporating a restricted contention-based protocol (i.e. one
that does not qualify as unrestricted) may only operate in the lower 25 MHz.
\- Governed under Part 90 of the FCC's rules [18].
### 5.4.2 Canada
Figure 5.4.2-1 shows the Canadian band plan for the band 3400 MHz to 3650 MHz.
Spectrum is assigned in blocks of 25 MHz continuously. The band is limited to
fixed wireless access systems and in 3400 to 3450 MHz grandfathered operations
are deployed. In addition, the band has been extended from 3650 to 3700 MHz
and harmonized with the US for Wireless Broadband Service (WBS).

## 5.5 Conclusion on frequency band arrangements
### 5.5.1 Summary of regional band plans
The frequency band arrangements were studied and reported above for the
following regions:
● **Europe:** The harmonised conditions determined by ECC and in the EU
decision for BWA use in the bands are summarized in subclause 5.1. In
addition, the local band plans applied in UK, Germany, France and Austria for
the band 3.4-3.6 GHz is documented.
● **Japan:** The present use of the band 3.4-4.2 GHz is reported in subclause
5.2. The band will be made available for terrestrial mobile services such as
IMT, but there is currently no band plan.
● **Latin America:** The situation in Mexico, Peru and Argentina is documented
in subclause 5.3. Many of the bands are used for BWA services.
● **North America:** The situation in US and Canada is documented in subclause
5.4. Canada has band plans for FWA in 225 MHz of spectrum with the upper 50
MHz (3650 -- 3700 MHz) designated for Wireless Broadband Services which is
capable of supporting mobile applications as well. Only 50 MHz is available
for terrestrial mobile services in the US.
Some observations can be made of the studies above. Looking first at Europe,
it can be noted that all countries studied except UK have paired band plans in
use today that are aligned with the ECC decision [7] and the band plans given
in the ECC recommendation [8]. The ECC plan is based on pairing of the bands
3.4-3.6 GHz and 3.6-3.8 GHz as shown in Figure 5.5-1, with use of the spectrum
for either FDD or TDD. For FDD, the uplink-downlink duplex frequency
separation is 100 MHz. There is no given duplex band gap for the FDD
arrangement in this proposal. There is a need to find solution for this
further during the work by e.g. half-duplex operation or flexible arrangements
on national basis.
Figure 5.5.1-1FDD and TDD band plan in 3.4-3.6 GHz and 3.6-3.8 GHz.
For Latin America, it can be noted that the plans for Mexico and Peru are very
similar to the European allocations. They have a 100 MHz uplink-downlink
separation and fit within the plan in Figure 5.5-1. Some blocks in Argentina
also have 100 MHz uplink-downlink spacing, while others have 50 MHz.
The North American plans differ from the European and Latin American,
especially for the US. In Canada, it remains to be seen if paired spectrum,
unpaired spectrum, or any combination would be made available in future for
mobile services within 3400-3800 MHz and/or harmonized with European band
plans.
### 5.5.2 Band plan working assumption
The studies performed above shows that the band plan in Figure 5.5.1-1 has
good support throughout Europe and also in some other parts of the world where
a band plan compatible with the arrangement in Figure 5.1.3-1 and/or Figure
5.1.3-2 is assumed. The plan calls for the bands to be paired with 100 MHz
uplink-downlink duplex frequency separation of 100 MHz. Alternatively, any of
the bands can be used as unpaired.
A _framework frequency arrangement_ based on the studies would then be as
follows (see also Figure 5.5-1):
**3.4-3-6 GHz band** :
● FDD Uplink 3400-3500 MHz
● FDD Downlink 3500-3600 MHz
● _or_ TDD Unpaired 3400-3600 MHz
**3.6-3-8 GHz band** :
● FDD Uplink 3600-3700 MHz
● FDD Downlink 3700-3800 MHz
● _or_ TDD Unpaired 3600-3800 MHz
Continued studies of deployment aspects and specific RF and signaling
requirements would use this framework frequency arrangement above as a working
assumption.
The _framework frequency arrangement_ as described above is to be applied for
the UMTS/LTE 3500 work.
### 5.5.3 Baseline frequency arrangements in 3400-3600 MHz
The FDD arrangement where 3410-3490 MHz is paired with 3510-3590 MHz is taken
as the baseline FDD pairing to use for further work on the band 3400-3600 MHz,
as shown in Figure 5.5.3-1.
From an implementation point of view, the following is noted:
\- It would be difficult to implement a complete arrangement larger than 2x80
MHz with a single duplexer in a UE. A single duplexer for 2x80 MHz is deemed
feasible with some extrapolation of current technology and would be available
in the next few years.
\- A dual duplexer approach would make UE implementation easier from self
desense point of view but would not help the UE to UE co-existence at the edge
of the other DL band.
\- For the Base Station implementation, full band duplexers larger than 2x80
MHz have been identified as being difficult. The feasibility is further
discussed in subclause 5.5.3.1.
A TDD arrangement should cover the whole frequency range 3400-3600 MHz.
Figure 5.5.3-1 Baseline FDD pairing arrangement for 3400-3600 MHz.
#### 5.5.3.1 Feasibility of 2x80 MHz BS filters
As pointed in 5.5.3, implementing a 2x80 MHz single duplex filter can be
difficult from the BS side. Figure 5.5.3.1-1 shows simulations for a full band
duplexer on the BS. The DL passband is defined as 3510-3590 MHz and the UL
passband is 3410-3490 MHz. It has been considered that the UL should have
enough rejection towards its own DL (90dB) as well as to be able to fulfill
3GPP general blocking requirements (20dB). It has also been taken into account
that the DL should protect its own UL (90dB) and be able to co-exist with TDD
systems at 3600MHz (40dB). It can be observed that it is feasible to create a
single 80 MHz duplexer, with 3 zeros and 9 poles, on the BS side with the
proposed requirements above and having an acceptable Insertion Loss in the
passband, as shown in Figure 5.5.3.1-2
{width="6.266666666666667in" height="3.2708333333333335in"}

{width="4.772916666666666in" height="2.2625in"}
Figure 5.5.3.1-2. Insertion loss of the BS duplexer for the TX and RX path.
#### 5.5.3.2 Feasibility of a 2x80 MHz arrangement for the UE
A 2 x 80 MHz arrangement using a single duplexer is deemed feasible within the
next few filter generations, but it is relevant to start defining requirements
based on a split duplexer solution for initial deployment. One possible
implementation is to cover the 80 MHz passband with two 50 MHz filters with a
20 MHz overlap as shown in Figure 5.5.3.2-1.
{width="6.845138888888889in" height="2.1006944444444446in"}
Figure 5.5.3.2-1: split duplexer arrangement with a 20 MHz overlap.
The overlap is 20 MHz, which means that all E-UTRA carrier bandwidths can be
supported. A possible UE implementation with a split duplexer is shown in
Figure 5.5.3.2-2. This architecture is used as a baseline to discuss the FDD
requirements in 3.4-3.6 GHz. The requirements are defined as single
requirements and should be met by either a split-duplexer or a single duplexer
solution.

# 6 Deployment aspects
## 6.1 Deployment based on European scenarios
### 6.1.1 Possible interference scenarios from ERC/REC(04)05
The band arrangement presented in clause 5.5 is mainly based on European
conditions, as expressed in a recent EU decision [21] and ECC/REC(04)05 [3].
The ECC recommendation considers both paired arrangements for FDD and unpaired
for TDD. Potentially, an implementation of the recommendation in [3] may be
mix of FDD/TDD and/or unsynchronized TDD.
Band plans that mix FDD and TDD within one or both bands shall be avoided to
prevent difficult interference scenarios and inefficient spectrum use, for the
following reasons:
\- Mix of FDD and TDD in the same geographical area gives adjacent up and
downlink transmissions, which may result in unreasonable terminal requirements
to avoid mobile-to-mobile interference.
\- The mix of FDD and TDD in the same geographical area results in spectrum
inefficiency due to the need for large guard bands. Especially, when
considering large bandwidths of 20 MHz and above for LTE-Advanced, it is
important to avoid spectrum fragmentation and not waste spectrum for large
guard bands
\- LTE needs large channel bandwidths and use of multiple antennas to achieve
the high data throughput requirements for IMT systems. Mixing TDD/FDD is a
major technical challenge for mobile terminal equipment requiring multiple
duplexers for each antenna.
\- For LTE Advanced carrier aggregation, 3GPP is currently not studying a
mixture of FDD and TDD operation.
The aim must be to avoid multiple interference scenarios in band plans, in
order not to create difficulties in deriving a common equipment standard. If
such an interference scenario were to occur in a country where UMTS/LTE 3500
MHz is to be deployed, the primary solution should be deployment and site
solutions tailored to that specific situation.
### 6.1.2 Assumptions for deriving requirements
Based on the conclusions in subclause 6.1.2, the following taken as a working
assumption for deriving RF requirements for deployment based on European
scenarios:
\- Any deployment is based on ECC/REC(04)05 [8], but local variations and
additional restrictions may exist that vary between countries and regions.
\- It is assumed that FDD and TDD are not deployed in the same frequency
range, i.e. 3400-3600 MHz and 3600-3800 MHz respectively are either deployed
with TDD only or FDD only.
\- For TDD deployment in a band, it is assumed that systems are synchronized.
\- Other services in the band, mix of FDD/TDD and/or unsynchronized TDD will
not be reflected through specific RF requirements.
Based on these assumptions, there will be no new interference scenarios
specific to the bands 3400-3600 MHz and 3600-3800 MHz, making it possible to
re-use RF requirements from other bands.
# 7 Study of UTRA requirements
## 7.1 General aspects
## 7.1.1 UTRA Channel raster and numbering
It was shown in Table 5.1.8-1 that the frequency allocations in 3.4-3.6 GHz
throughout Europe are made in blocks of from 2x11 up to 2x42 MHz. Block sizes
are generally large, so there does not seem to be a need to have any UARFCN in
addition to the default 200 kHz raster.
For the band 3400-3600 MHz, a 2x80 MHz FDD duplex arrangement was concluded in
Subclause 5.5.3 and illustrated in Figure 5.5.3-1:
  * FDD Uplink 3410-3490 MHz
  * FDD Downlink 3510-3590 MHz
This band allocation is for UTRA referred to as Band XXII.
UARFCN can be defined as in Table 7.1.1-1, by reserving a part of the unused
numbers that follow the Band XX allocation.
Table 7.1.1-1: UARFCN allocated for UTRA FDD Band XXII

|  |  |  | Stop res. | 4824 | 3489.8 |  | Stop res. | 5049 | 3589.8  
### 7.1.2 Spurious emissions frequency bandwidth
In order to cover spurious emissions up to the 5^th^ harmonic, as recommended
in ITU-R SM.329 [1], s2.5 table 1 [22], the upper frequency limit for
"Transmitter spurious emissions" and "Receiver spurious emissions" in TS
25.101, TS 25,104 and TS 25.141 needs to be extended from 12.75 GHz to 19 GHz
for Band 42, Band 43 and Band XXII.
## 7.2 Void
## 7.3 Specific BS RF requirements for UTRA
### 7.3.1 Unwanted emissions
The "Transmitter spurious emissions" in T25.104 and TS 25.141 require
alteration to accommodate the LTE3500 frequency band for FDD, as follows.
Also, the tables on minimum co-location emissions requirements similarly
require alteration. Limits are the same as in other bands.
It is assumed that FDD and TDD are not deployed in the same frequency range in
the same area. Thus, co-existence and co-location requirements for this
scenario are not treated.

### 7.3.2 Blocking requirements

# 8 Study of E-UTRA requirements
## 8.1 General aspects
### 8.1.1 E-UTRA Channel raster and numbering
It was shown in Table 5.1.8-1 that the frequency allocations in 3.4-3.6 GHz
throughout Europe are made in blocks of from 2x11 up to 2x42 MHz. E-UTRA is
based on channel bandwidths from 1.4 to 20 MHz and a 100 kHz raster that
supports carrier deployment anywhere within those block sizes.
For the band 3400-3600 MHz, a 2x80 MHz FDD duplex arrangement was concluded in
Subclause 5.5.3 and illustrated in Figure 5.5.3-1:
  * FDD Uplink 3410-3490 MHz
  * FDD Downlink 3510-3590 MHz
This band allocation is for E-UTRA referred to as Band 22.
E-UARFCN can be defined as in Table 8.1.1-1, by reserving a part of the unused
numbers that follow the band [21] allocation.

* * *
It was concluded in Subclause 5.5.3 that TDD can be deployed in 3400-3600 MHz.
Using the complete frequency range available in 3400-3600 MHz would cover all
possible arrangements. As indicated in subclause 5.5.2, the band 3600-3800 MHz
can also be used for unpaired arrangement, in line with ECC recommendation
(04)05 [8].
Two unpaired arrangements for TDD are therefore defined for E-UTRA TDD:
  * 3400-3600 MHz
  * 3600-3800 MHz
The band allocations are for E-UTRA referred to as Band 42 and 43
respectively.
E-UARFCN can be defined as in Table 8.1.1-2, by reserving a part of the unused
numbers that follow the band 41 allocation.

### 8.1.2 MSR BS operating band and categories
The tables identifying the band designations of unpaired bands in TS 37.104
and TS 37.141 will require alteration to accommodate the new LTE3500 frequency
band parameters, as follows.
Table 8.1.2-1: Unpaired bands in E-UTRA and UTRA.

### 8.1.3 Spurious emissions frequency bandwidth
"Transmitter spurious emissions" and "Receiver spurious emissions" in TS
36.101, TS 36,104, TS 36.141, TS 37.104 and TS 37.141 need to extend the
frequency range from 12.75 GHz to 19 GHz for Band 22, Band 42 and Band 43 to
cover spurious emissions from those bands up to the 5^th^ harmonic, as
recommended in ITU-R SM.329 [1], s2.5 table 1 22.
## 8.2 Specific UE RF requirements for E-UTRA
### 8.2.1 Void
### 8.2.2 Receiver performance
#### 8.2.2.1 Reference sensitivity
The reference sensitivity requirements for Band 22 should be specified such
that it can be met by either a split-duplexer or a single duplexer solution.
The duplex spacing is 100 MHz and we assume passband of 50 MHz of the
constituent duplexers as shown in Figure 5.5.3.2-1. In view of transmitter
noise, one may look at Band 3 and Band 9 that has a similar spacing, and
assume a performance in between these bands, e.g. like Band 2\. Then losses of
the switches in Figure 5.5.3.2-2 should be added, and 0.5 dB per switch should
be possible at 3.5 GHz suggesting Band 3 performance altogether. This
performance may also be reasonable for a future single-duplexer arrangement
with an 80 MHz passband. The proposed requirements for Band 22 are shown in
Table 8.2.2.1-1.
Table 8.2.2.1-1: Reference sensitivity QPSK P~REFSENS~
+-------------------+---------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------+-------------+ | Channel bandwidth | | | | | | | | +-------------------+---------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------+-------------+ | E-UTRA Band | 1.4 MHz | 3 MHz | 5 MHz | 10 MHz | 15 MHz | 20 MHz | Duplex Mode | | | | | | | | | | | | (dBm) | (dBm) | (dBm) | (dBm) | (dBm) | (dBm) | | +-------------------+---------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------+-------------+ | 22 | | | -97 | -94 | -92.2 | -91 | FDD | +-------------------+---------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------+-------------+
The uplink allocation for Band 22 should be similar to Band 2 and Band 3 that
have a similar duplex spacing.

## 8.3 Specific BS RF requirements for E-UTRA
### 8.3.1 Unwanted emissions
For the "Operating band unwanted emissions" in TS 36.104 and TS 36.141, the
existing tables of requirements are applicable to warrant addition of Bands 22
(3410-3490MHz/3510-3590 MHz), 42 (3400-3600 MHz) and 43 (3600-3800 MHz).
The "Transmitter spurious emissions" in TS 36.104 and TS 36.141 require
alteration to accommodate the LTE3500 frequency bands for TDD and FDD, as
follows. Also, the tables on minimum co-location emissions requirements
similarly require alteration. Limits are the same as in other bands.
Co-existence or co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using
the same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-existence
or co-location requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-
existence or co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications. This is not applicable to Home BS. In this case, a study
on the synchronization requirement is needed in order to decide the
applicability of co-existence/co-location requirements. This study is not in
the scope of the present WI.
It is assumed that FDD and TDD are not deployed in the same frequency range in
the same area. Thus, co-existence and co-location requirements for this
scenario are not treated.

### 8.3.2 Blocking requirements
The blocking performance requirements in TS 36.104 and 36.141 require
alteration to accommodate the LTE3500 frequency bands for TDD, as follows.

requires alteration to accommodate the new LTE3500 frequency band parameters,
see subclause 8.1.1. 6.6.1.5.1. Mandatory TX spurious emissions (Category A)
The upper frequency limit needs to be extended from 12.75 GHz to 19 GHz for
Band 42 and Band 43 6.6.1.5.2. Mandatory TX spurious emissions (Category B)
The upper frequency limit needs to be extended from 12.75 GHz to 19 GHz for
Band 42 and Band 43 6.6.1.5.5 Additional spurious emissions requirement for
co-existence with systems operating in other frequency bands Add requirements
for co-existence with Bands 42 and 43, with same limits as for other bands.
According to Note 1, the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the
downlink operating band is excluded. 6.6.1.5.6 Spurious emissions limits for
BS co-located with another BS Add requirements for co-existence with Bands 42
and 43, with same limits as for other bands. According to Note 1, the 10 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the downlink operating band is excluded.
7.4.5.1 General blocking test requirement Bands 42 and 43 are added to the
same entry as the other TDD bands, giving the same limits as for bands 33 to
40. 7.4.5.5 Additional BC3 blocking test requirement Bands 42 and 43 are added
to the same entry as the other TDD bands, giving the same limits as for other
bands 33 to 40. 7.5.5.1 General minimum requirement for out-of-band blocking
Bands 42 and 43 are added to the same entry as the other TDD bands, giving the
same limits as for bands 33 to 40. 7.5.5.2 Co-location test requirement Add
requirements for co-existence with Bands 42 and 43, with same limits as for
other bands. According to Note 2, the 10 MHz frequency range immediately
outside the downlink operating band is excluded. 7.6.5.1 RX spurious emissions
