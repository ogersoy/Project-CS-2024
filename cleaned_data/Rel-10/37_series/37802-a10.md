The present document is the technical report for the work item on Multi-
standard radio Base Station RF requirements for non-contiguous spectrum
deployments, which was approved at TSG RAN#48. The objective of the WI is to
specify RF requirements for MSR specifications such that common RF components
can be used for multi-RAT deployments where more than one spectrum block is in
use, and where the blocks are non-contiguous in frequency within a band.

# 4 General
A work item to specify RF performance requirements for Multi-Standard Radio
(MSR) Base Stations (BS) was completed in RAN#47. However, the specification
work only considered multi-RAT deployments where the spectrum transmitted
within a band using common RF components was considered to be a single
contiguous spectrum block. Therefore the scenario where common RF components
are transmitting multiple non-contiguous spectrum blocks within a band is not
currently considered within the MSR specifications, and the assumption is that
different RF components would need to be used for each block to ensure
coexistence with other operators using the spectrum in between these blocks.
Given that the above non-contiguous block scenario exists in today's networks,
it is essential that MSR BS requirements cover this case to allow operators to
maximise the usage of MSR in the field, and for the cost saving benefits it
brings.
Note that such requirements are already available for MC-BTS in GERAN.
## 4.1 Work item objective
The objective of the MSR-NC work item is to specify RF requirements for MSR
specifications such that common RF components can be used for multi-RAT
deployments where more than one spectrum block is in use, and where the blocks
are non-contiguous in frequency within a band. It is originally proposed in
the WID to primarily focus on the following scenario:
\- Non-contiguous spectrum operation in 900MHz and 1800MHz where LTE, UTRA,
and GSM deployment is considered, also considering the possibility that LTE is
deployed in smaller spectrum blocks than 5MHz as well as equal and larger than
5MHz.
The objective of the WI will be to finalize MSR-NC requirements for all bands
in BC1 and BC2. The reason is that most requirement are operating band
agnostic and it is possible to write generic requirements that do not depend
on specific scenarios for non-contiguous spectrum.
The work will focus on following steps:
1\. Definition of the configuration scenarios to be reflected in
specifications to ensure predictable MSR operation in practical deployed
configurations.
2\. Analyze if new requirements are needed in core specifications, only
applicable in non-contiguous spectrum allocations.
3\. Creation of the core requirements for dealing with the non-contiguous
spectrum (for agreed cases)
4\. Development of test configurations and specification of the test
requirements corresponding to the core requirements applicable in non-
contiguous spectrum allocations.
5\. Requirements for MSR BS operating in contiguous spectrum shall remain
unchanged.
The following specification work is required:
a. Core requirements RAN4 MSR specifications
b. Test requirements in RAN4 MSR specifications
## 4.2 Relation to other RAN and GERAN specifications
The core requirements for MSR are in most parts specified explicitly in TS
37.104 [6], while many requirements are also specified through normative
references to the respective single-RAT specifications. These are in TR 37.900
[12] divided into three types:
1\. **Generic MSR requirement:** A common generic requirement that applies for
all RATs and for BS configured for both multi-RAT and single-RAT operation. In
some cases, there are additional requirement(s) that apply only in some Band
Category. There are no references to the single-RAT specifications.
2\. **Generic MSR requirement, with additional single-RAT requirements:** A
common generic requirement which applies as in point 1\. In addition some
single RAT requirement(s) apply, included by normative reference(s) to the
single-RAT specification(s).
3\. **Single-RAT only requirements:** In this case, no common generic
requirement is defined. The existing single-RAT requirement applies for each
RAT, included by normative reference(s) to the single-RAT specification(s).
The same requirements will apply for MSR in non-contiguous spectrum and the
relation to other RAN and GERAN specifications will be the same, where single-
RAT requirements are included by reference.
For single-RAT references to GERAN specifications [5][10], the GERAN
requirement are in general applicable in non-contiguous spectrum, since that
is within the scope of the GERAN specification. The requirements for GSM
single RAT in MSR refer to the MCBTS specifications. The relationship to GERAN
is the same as contiguous spectrum MSR. The details of how they apply are
specified by TSG GERAN and do not require any specific treatment in TS 37.104
[6].
The scope of the UTRA specifications cover contiguous spectrum. For single-RAT
references to the UTRA specifications [2][7], the single-RAT requirement will
however apply also for non-contiguous spectrum, unless otherwise stated.
The scope of the E-UTRA specifications in Rel-10 presently covers contiguous
spectrum. Non-contiguous spectrum aggregation is planned to be introduced in
Rel-11. For this reason, definitions and terminology in non-contiguous
spectrum should be aligned between MSR-NC in the MSR specifications [6][11]
and LTE Carrier aggregation, which will be applied in both MSR and E-UTRA
specifications [4][9]. For single-RAT references to the E-UTRA specifications
[4][9], the single-RAT requirement will apply also for non-contiguous
spectrum, unless otherwise stated.
The relation to the single-RAT specification can be kept unchanged for non-
contiguous spectrum operation. No changes will be needed for TS 37.104 [6] in
the general subclause 4.1 for "Relation to other RAN and GERAN
specifications". If the applicability of any requirement is changed, that
should be reflected in clause 5 of TS 37.104 [6].
The applicability of each requirement for MSR BS is described in TS 37.104 [6]
clause 5.
## 4.3 Regional requirements
Since all the regional requirements listed in Table 4.4-1 of specification
TS37.104 [6] are operation configuration independent, no changes are needed.
## 4.4 Manufacturer's declaration
The manufacturer shall declare which operational configurations the BS
supports by declaring the following parameters:
a) General Parameters:
● Support of the BS in non-contiguous spectrum operation.
● The supported operating bands defined in subclause 4.4.
● The frequency range within the above frequency band(s) supported by the BS.
● Supported capability set
● The maximum RF bandwidth supported by a MSR BS within an operating band when
the BS is configured with carriers of different RATs
  * for contiguous spectrum operation.
  * for non-contiguous spectrum operation
● The rated total output power as a sum over all RATs
  * for contiguous spectrum operation
  * for non-contiguous operation
● Maximum supported power difference between carriers
● Total number of supported carriers
If the rated total output power and total number of supported carriers are not
simultaneously supported in Multi-RAT operations, the manufacturer shall
declare the following additional parameters:
● The reduced number of supported carriers at the rated total output power in
Multi-RAT operations(i.e. \ 10 MHz.
\- In order to maintain equivalence also with scenarios where the individual
sub-blocks in a non-contiguous spectrum allocation are generated using
separate BS transmitters, a cumulative approach is applied in the sub-block
gap for sub block gaps for the 1st adjacent channel for sub block gaps with 5
≤ Wgap \
