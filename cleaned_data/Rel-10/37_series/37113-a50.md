# 1 Scope
The present document covers the assessment of E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/EDGE Multi-
Standard Radio (MSR) Base Stations and associated ancillary equipment in
respect of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC).
The present document specifies the applicable test conditions, performance
assessment and performance criteria for E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/EDGE Base
Stations and associated ancillary equipment in one of the following
categories:
\- Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) Base Stations for E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/EDGE
meeting the requirements of TS 37.104 [6], with conformance demonstrated by
compliance to TS 37.141 [11].
\- Base Stations for E-UTRA meeting the requirements of TS 36.104 [4], with
conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 36.141 [9].
\- Base Stations for UTRA FDD meeting the requirements of TS 25.104 [2], with
conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 25.141 [7].
\- Base Stations for UTRA TDD meeting the requirements of TS 25.105 [3], with
conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 25.142 [8].
\- Base Stations for GSM/EDGE meeting the requirements of TS 45.005 [5], with
conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 51.021 [10].
In addition to MSR base stations, the present document covers other BS
supporting more than one RAT.
Technical requirements related to the antenna port of Base Stations are not
included in the present document. These are found in the relevant product
standards [2-11].
The environment classification used in the present document refers to the
environment classification used in IEC 61000-6-1 [12] and IEC 61000-6-3 [13].
The EMC requirements have been selected to ensure an adequate level of
compatibility for apparatus at residential, commercial and light industrial
environments. The levels, however, do not cover extreme cases which may occur
in any location but with low probability of occurrence.

## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [x] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Ancillary equipment:** Equipment (apparatus), used in connection with a
receiver, transmitter or transceiver is considered as an ancillary equipment
(apparatus) if:

# 4 Test conditions
## 4.1 General
The equipment shall be tested in normal test environment defined in base
station conformance testing specification TS 37.141 [11]. The test conditions
shall be recorded in the test report.
For an EUT which contains more than one BS, it is sufficient to perform tests
relating to ports of each representative type of the BS forming part of the
EUT. For an MSR BS or other BS supporting more than one RAT, tests shall be
performed relating to each port, but need not be repeated for each RAT that
use the same port unless the test configuration in subclause 4.5 calls for a
multi-RAT test configuration. For other BS supporting more than one RAT
however (other than MSR BS), tests relating to the antenna port(s) shall
always be performed for each supported RAT.
The manufacturer shall declare the supported operating band(s) according to
subclause 4.4 of TS 37.141 [11]. Requirements apply only for the declared
operating band and corresponding Band Category.
The manufacturer shall declare the supported capability set(s) according to
subclause 4.7 of TS 37.141 [11]. Tests performed on a Base Station according
to a declared Capability Set cover all single RAT and multi-RAT configurations
included in the declared Capability Set.
## 4.2 Arrangements for establishing a communication link
The wanted RF signal nominal frequency shall be selected by setting the
channel number according to the following:
\- The Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) for E-UTRA carrier
\- The Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (UARFCN) for UTRA carrier
\- The Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (ARFCN) for GSM/EDGE carrier
A communication link shall be set up with a suitable test system capable of
evaluating the required performance criteria (hereafter called \"the test
system\") at the radio interface and telecommunication port/ports (the
S1/Iub/Abis interface). The test system shall be located outside of the test
environment.
When the EUT is required to be in the transmit/receive mode, the following
conditions shall be met:
\- The EUT shall be commanded to operate at maximum rated transmit power;
\- Adequate measures shall be taken to avoid the effect of the unwanted signal
on the measuring equipment;
\- The wanted RF input signal level shall be set to a level where the
performance is not limited by the receiver noise floor or strong signal
effects.
\- For E-UTRA, the wanted signal can be set e.g. 15 dB above the reference
sensitivity level as defined in TS 36.141 [9] to provide a stable
communication link.
\- For UTRA FDD and TDD, the wanted signal can be set e.g. 15 dB above the
reference sensitivity level as defined in TS 25.141 [7] or TS 25.142 [8]
respectively, to provide a stable communication link.
\- For GSM/EDGE the wanted receiver input signal level shall be set to a
nominal value of -47 dBm.
For immunity tests subclause 4.3 shall additionally apply.
### 4.2.1 Multiple enclosure BS solution
For a BS with multiple enclosures, the BS part with Radio digital unit and the
Radio unit may be tested separately. Communication link shall be set up in the
same way as if they are in single BS enclosure. The Radio Digital unit and the
Radio unit shall communicate over an interface enabling establishment of a
communication link.
## 4.3 Narrow band responses on receivers
Responses on receivers or duplex transceivers occurring during the immunity
test at discrete frequencies which are narrow band responses (spurious
responses), are identified by the following method:
\- if during an immunity test the quantity being monitored goes outside the
specified tolerances (clause 6), it is necessary to establish whether the
deviation is due to a narrow band response or to a wide band (EMC) phenomenon.
Therefore, the test shall be repeated with the unwanted signal frequency first
increased, and then decreased by an offset f~offset~, where
\- For E-UTRA, f~offset~ = 2 x BW~Channel~, where BW~Channel~ is the channel
bandwidth as defined in TS 36.104 [9];
\- For UTRA, f~offset~ = 10 MHz
\- For GSM/EDGE, f~offset~ = 400 kHz
\- if the deviation disappears in either or both of the above offset cases,
then the response is considered as a narrow band response;
\- if the deviation does not disappear, this may be due to the fact that the
offset has made the frequency of the unwanted signal correspond to the
frequency of another narrow band response. Under these circumstances the
procedure is repeated with the increase and decrease of the frequency of the
unwanted signal set to 1.25 x f~offset~;
\- if the deviation does not disappear with the increased and/or decreased
frequency, the phenomenon is considered wide band and therefore an EMC problem
and the equipment fails the test.
Narrow band responses are disregarded.
## 4.4 Exclusion bands
An exclusion band is a band of frequencies over which no tests of radiated
immunity are made.
### 4.4.1 Transmitter exclusion band
For testing of radiated immunity there shall be no transmitter exclusion band.
### 4.4.2 Receiver exclusion band
The receiver exclusion band for base stations extends from the lower frequency
of the Base Station receive band minus 20 MHz to the upper frequency of the
Base Station receive band plus 20 MHz. The exclusion bands for the MSR,
E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/EDGE paired and unpaired operating bands are as set out
in Tables 4.4-2 and 4.4-3 respectively.
Table 4.4-2: Receiver exclusion band for base stations (paired bands).

## 4.5 BS test configurations
The present clause defines the BS test configurations that shall be used for
demonstrating conformance. This is specified in Table 4.5-1 for multi-RAT
capable MSR Base Stations and in Table 4.5-2 for single-RAT capable BS. For
other BS supporting more than one RAT (other than MSR BS), Table 4.5-2 applies
separately for each RAT supported.
The Test configurations apply according to the declared RAT Capability Set
(CS) of the MSR Base Station according to subclause 4.7 of TS 37.141 [11] and
the Band Category of the declared operating band (BC1, BC2 or BC3), as listed
in the heading of each table.
T he test configurations (TCx) are defined in TS 37.141 [11], subclause 4.8.
For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous operation only, the test
configuration(s) in Tables 4.5-1 and 4.5-2 denoted by a "C" shall be used for
testing.
For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous operation and
where the parameters in the manufacture's declaration according to subclause
4.7.2 of TS 37.141 [11] are identical for contiguous and non-contiguous
operation, the test configurations denoted by "CNC" shall be used.
For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous operation and
where the parameters in the manufacture's declaration according to subclause
4.7.2 of TS 37.141 [11] are not identical for contiguous and non-contiguous
operation, the test configurations denoted by "C/NC" shall be used for
testing.
For immunity tests
> \- The communication link for the RAT(s) listed in the table shall be
> established according to subclause 4.2
\- Tests for ports relating to the RAT(s) supported shall be performed
according to clause 4.1.

\- The value of the BLER shall be monitored in case of UTRA FDD and UTRA TDD
\- The value of the BER shall be monitored in case of GSM/EDGE (see Annex A.2)
## 5.4 Ancillary equipment
At the manufacturer\'s discretion the test may be performed on the ancillary
equipment separately or on a representative configuration of the combination
of radio and ancillary equipment. In each case EUT is tested against all
applicable immunity and emission clauses of the present document and in each
case, compliance enables the ancillary equipment to be used with different
radio equipment.
# 6 Performance criteria
The test should, where possible, be performed using a bearer with the
characteristics of data rate and performance criteria defined for E-UTRA, UTRA
and GSM/EDGE below. If the test is not performed using one of these bearers
(for example, if none of them are supported by the BS) the characteristics of
the bearer used shall be recorded in the test report.
## 6.1 Performance criteria for continuous phenomena for BS
### 6.1.1 E-UTRA performance criteria
The throughput in Table 6.1.1-1 is stated relative to the maximum throughput
of the FRC. The maximum throughput for an FRC is equal to the payload size *
the number of uplink subframes per second.
The BS Uplink and Downlink paths shall each meet the performance criteria
defined in Table 6.1.1-1 during the test. If the Uplink and Downlink paths are
evaluated as a one loop then the criteria is two times the throughput
reduction shown in Table 6.1.1-1. After each test case BS shall operate as
intended with no loss of user control function, stored data and the
communication link shall be maintained.
Table 6.1.1-1: E-UTRA BS Performance criteria for continuous phenomena for BS
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **E-UTRA Channel |** Bearer Information | **Performance | | Bandwidth [MHz]** | Data Rate**| Criteria ^1,2^** | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 1.4 | **FRC A1-1 in Annex | Throughput > 95 % | | | A.1 in TS 36.104 | | | | [2]** | No loss of service | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 3 | **FRC A1-2 in Annex | Throughput > 95 % | | | A.1 in TS 36.104 | | | | [2]** | No loss of service | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 5 | **FRC A1-3 in Annex | Throughput > 95 % | | | A.1 in TS 36.104 | | | | [2]** | No loss of service | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 10 | **FRC A1-3 in Annex | Throughput > 95 % | | | A.1 in TS 36.104 | | | | [2]** ^3^ | No loss of service | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 15 | **FRC A1-3 in Annex | Throughput > 95 % | | | A.1 in TS 36.104 | | | | [2]** ^3^ | No loss of service | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 20 | **FRC A1-3 in Annex | Throughput > 95 % | | | A.1 in TS 36.104 | | | | [2]** ^3^ | No loss of service | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
NOTE 1: The performance criteria, \"Throughput > 95 % / No loss of service\",
applies also if a bearer with another characteristics is used in the test.
NOTE 2: The performance criteria, \"Throughput > 90 % / No loss of service\",
applies instead if the Uplink and Downlink paths are evaluated as a one loop.
NOTE 3: This is the information data rate of a single instance of the bearer
mapped to 25 resource blocks. The performance criteria shall be met for each
consecutive application of a single instance of the bearer mapped to disjoint
frequency ranges with a width of 25 resource blocks each.
### 6.1.2 UTRA performance criteria
The BS Uplink and Downlink paths shall each meet the performance criteria
defined in Table 6.1.2-1 during the test. If the Uplink and Downlink paths are
evaluated as a one loop then the criteria is two times the value shown in
Table 6.1.2‑1.After each test case BS shall operate as intended with no loss
of user control function, stored data and the communication link shall be
maintained.
Table 6.1.2-1: UTRA BS Performance criteria for continuous phenomena for BS
+------------------------------+----------------------+ | Bearer Information Data Rate | Performance Criteria | +------------------------------+----------------------+ | 12.2 kbps | BLER \ NOTE: This BER is the upper limit in TS 45.008 [32] for RXQUAL = 3.
If the test method of Annex A.1.2 is used, the value of RXQUAL shall not
exceed 3 during the test.
At the conclusion of the test the EUT shall operate as intended with no loss
of user control functions or stored data, and the communication link shall
have been maintained.
#### 6.1.3.1 GSM/EDGE uplnik
The BER of the uplink shall be assessed during the test according to one of
the test methods of Annex A.2.
If the test method of Annex A.2.1 is used, the value of RXQUAL shall not
exceed 3 during the test.
If the test method of Annex A.2.2 is used, the measured BER of the class 2
bits of TCH/FS shall not exceed 1,6 % during the test.
NOTE: This BER is the upper limit in TS 45.008 [32] for RXQUAL = 3.
For a base station, the RXQUAL of the uplink shall not exceed three (3)
measured during the test sequence.
At the conclusion of the test the EUT shall operate as intended with no loss
of user control functions or stored data, and the communication link shall
have been maintained.
## 6.2 Performance criteria for transient phenomena for BS
At the conclusion of each exposure the EUT shall operate with no user
noticeable loss of the communication link.
At the conclusion of the total test comprising the series of individual
exposures the EUT shall operate as intended with no loss of user control
functions or stored data, as declared by the manufacturer, and the
communication link shall have been maintained.
## 6.3 Performance criteria for continuous phenomena for Ancillary equipment
The apparatus shall continue to operate as intended during and after the test.
No degradation of performance or loss of function is allowed below the
performance level specified by the manufacturer, when the apparatus is used as
intended. The performance level may be replaced by a permissible performance
loss. If the minimum performance level or the permissible performance loss is
not specified by the manufacturer, either of these may be derived from the
product description and documentation and what the user may reasonably expect
from the apparatus if used as intended.
## 6.4 Performance criteria for transient phenomena for Ancillary equipment
The apparatus shall continue to operate as intended after the test. No
degradation of performance or loss of function is allowed below the
performance level specified by the manufacturer, when the apparatus is used as
intended. The performance level may be replaced by a permissible performance
loss. During the test, degradation of performance is however allowed. If the
minimum performance level or the permissible performance loss is not specified
by the manufacturer, either of these may be derived from the product
description and documentation and what the user may reasonably expect from the
apparatus if used as intended.

# 8 Emission
## 8.1 Test configurations
This subclause defines the configurations for emission tests as follows:
\- the equipment shall be tested under normal test conditions as specified in
the functional standards;
\- the test configuration shall be as close to normal intended use as
possible;
\- if the equipment is part of a system, or can be connected to ancillary
equipment, then it shall be acceptable to test the equipment while connected
to the minimum configuration of ancillary equipment necessary to exercise the
ports;
\- if the equipment has a large number of ports, then a sufficient number
shall be selected to simulate actual operation conditions and to ensure that
all the different types of termination are tested;
\- the test conditions, test configuration and mode of operation shall be
recorded in the test report;
\- ports which in normal operation are connected shall be connected to an
ancillary equipment or to a representative piece of cable correctly terminated
to simulate the input/output characteristics of the ancillary equipment, Radio
Frequency (RF) input/output ports shall be correctly terminated;
\- ports which are not connected to cables during normal operation, e.g.
service connectors, programming connectors, temporary connectors etc. shall
not be connected to any cables for the purpose of EMC testing. Where cables
have to be connected to these ports, or interconnecting cables have to be
extended in length in order to exercise the EUT, precautions shall be taken to
ensure that the evaluation of the EUT is not affected by the addition or
extension of these cables;
\- the test arrangements for transmitter and receiver sections of the
transceiver are described separately for the sake of clarity. However, where
possible the test of the transmitter section and receiver section of the EUT
may be carried out simultaneously to reduce test time.
## 8.2 Radiated emission from Base Station and ancillary equipment
### 8.2.1 Radiated emission for Base Stations
This test is applicable to Base stations, except for BS that are only single-
RAT GSM/EDGE capable. This test shall be performed on a representative
configuration of the Base station.
For Base Stations that are only single-RAT GSM/EDGE capable, the test method
and limits in clause 8 of TS 51.021 [10] apply.
#### 8.2.1.1 Definition
This test assesses the ability of BS to limit unwanted emission from the
enclosure port.
#### 8.2.1.2 Test method
a) A test site fulfilling the requirements of ITU-R SM. 329 [15] shall be
used. The BS shall be placed on a non-conducting support and shall be operated
from a power source via a RF filter to avoid radiation from the power leads.
Mean power of any spurious components shall be detected by the test antenna
and measuring receiver (e.g. a spectrum analyser). At each frequency at which
a component is detected, the BS shall be rotated and the height of the test
antenna adjusted to obtain maximum response, and the effective radiated power
(e.r.p.) of that component determined by a substitution measurement. The
measurement shall be repeated with the test antenna in the orthogonal
polarization plane.
NOTE: Effective radiated power (e.r.p.) refers to the radiation of a half wave
tuned dipole instead of an isotropic antenna. There is a constant difference
of 2,15 dB between e.i.r.p. and e.r.p.
e.r.p. (dBm) = e.i.r.p. (dBm) − 2,15 Ref: ITU-R SM.329 ANNEX 1 [15].
b) The BS shall transmit with maximum power declared by the manufacturer with
all transmitters active. Set the base station to transmit a signal as stated
in subclause 4.5.
c) The received power shall be measured over the frequency range 30 MHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding 10 MHz below the lower RF bandwidth edge to 10 MHz above
the upper RF bandwidth edge The measurement bandwidth shall be 100 kHz between
30 MHz and 1 GHz and 1 MHz above 1 GHz as given in ITU-R SM.329 [15]. The
video bandwidth shall be approximately three times the resolution bandwidth.
If this video bandwidth is not available on the measuring receiver, it shall
be the maximum available and at least 1 MHz. Unless otherwise stated, all
measurements are done as mean power (RMS).
#### 8.2.1.3 Limits
The frequency boundary and reference bandwidths for the detailed transitions
of the limits between the requirements for out of band emissions and spurious
emissions are based on ITU-R Recommendations SM.329 [10] and SM.1539 [23].
The BS shall meet the limits below:
Table 8.2.1.3-1: Limits for radiated emissions from BS
* * *
**Frequency range** **Minimum requirement (e.r.p.)/Reference Bandwidth** 30
MHz≤ f \1 m** Effective radiated RF power between 30 MHz to 180 MHz ±6 dB
±6 dB Effective radiated RF power between 180 MHz to 4 GHz ±4 dB ±6 dB
Effective radiated RF power between 4 GHz to 12,75 GHz ±6 dB ±9* dB *NOTE:
This value may be reduced to ±6 dB when further information on the potential
radiation characteristic of the EUT is available.
* * *
NOTE: If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in Table 8.2.2, this equipment can still be used,
provided that an adjustment is made follows:
Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified in
Table 8.2.1.4-1 is used to tighten the Test Requirements - making the test
harder to pass. This procedure will ensure that a Test System not compliant
with Table 8.2.1.4-1 2 does not increase the probability of passing an EUT
that would otherwise have failed a test if a Test System compliant with Table
8.2.1.4-1 had been used.
### 8.2.2 Radiated emission, ancillary equipment
This test is applicable to ancillary equipment. This test shall be performed
on a representative configuration of the ancillary equipment.
#### 8.2.2.1 Definition
This test assesses the ability of ancillary equipment to limit unwanted
emission from the enclosure port.
#### 8.2.2.2 Test method
The test method shall be in accordance with CISPR 22 [17].
#### 8.2.2.3 Limits
The ancillary equipment shall meet the limits according to CISPR 22 [17] shown
in Table 8.2.2.3-1 and Table Table 8.2.2.3-2.

## 8.3 Conducted emission DC power input/output port
This test is applicable to equipment which may have DC cables longer than 3 m.
If the DC power cable of the radio equipment is intended to be less than 3 m
in length, and intended only for direct connection to a dedicated AC to DC
power supply, then the measurement shall be performed only on the AC power
input of that power supply as specified in subclause 8.4.
This test shall be performed on a representative configuration of the radio
equipment, the associated ancillary equipment, or representative configuration
of the combination of radio and ancillary equipment.
### 8.3.1 Definition
This test assesses the ability of radio equipment and ancillary equipment to
limit internal noise from the DC power input/output ports.
### 8.3.2 Test method
The test method shall be in accordance with CISPR 22 [17] and the Artificial
Mains Network (AMN) shall be connected to a DC power source.
In the case of DC output ports, the ports shall be connected via a AMN to a
load drawing the rated current of the source.
A measuring receiver shall be connected to each AMN measurement port in turn
and the conducted emission recorded.
The equipment shall be installed with a ground plane as defined in CISPR 22
[17]. The reference earth point of the AMNs shall be connected to the
reference ground plane with a conductor as short as possible.
The measurement receiver shall be in accordance with the requirements of
section one of CISPR 16‑1-1 [18].
### 8.3.3 Limits
The equipment shall meet the limits below (including the average limit and the
quasi‑peak limit) when using, respectively, an average detector receiver and a
quasi‑peak detector receiver and measured in accordance with the method
described in subclause 8.3.2 above. If the average limit is met when using a
quasi‑peak detector, the equipment shall be deemed to meet both limits and
measurement with the average detector receiver is not necessary.
The equipment shall meet the limits given in Table 8.3.3-1.
