\
### 5.1.1 The allocation in the Radio Regulations
The starting point is the Radio Regulations according to which the band
806-849/851-894 MHz is part of 790-960 MHz allocated to the MOBILE SERVICE on
a primary basis subject to footnotes 5.316 in 790-862 and 5.317A (reproduced
below) above 862 MHz.
**5.317A** Administrations wishing to implement International Mobile
Telecommunications (IMT-2000) may use parts of the band 806-960 MHz which are
allocated to the mobile service on a primary basis or planned to be used for
mobile systems (see Resolution **224 (WRC-2000)**). This indentification does
not preclude the use of these bands by any application of the service to which
they are allocated and does not establish priority in the Radio Regulations.
### 5.1.2 Use of the additional spectrum in various regions
#### 5.1.2.1 Region 1
#### 5.1.2.2 Region 2
The allocation in the United States after re-banding is shown in Figure
5.1.2.2-X. The upper frequencies in the 800 MHz range are mobile or control-
station transmit frequencies, the lower frequencies for base-station transmit
frequencies. For the 700 MHz band it is the converse (swapped band).
Figure 5.1.2.2-X: band plan for the United States.
Numerous public safety radio systems (such as those used by police,
firefighters and emergency medical technicians) operate at 806-824 MHz/851-869
MHz in the United States. A number of private mobile radio systems also
operate in the 800 MHz band; many utility companies use the band for internal
communications for example. The band is also home to Specialized Mobile Radio
(SMR) systems that provide commercial mobile service to businesses and the
public, and can also be used for UTRA or E-UTRA. ESMR operators occupy upper
band segment, adjacent to the cellular band (Band 5). Public safety and other
high-site systems occupy lower band segment, adjacent to the 700 MHz public
safety.
Figure 5.1.2.2-Y shows the general band plan for iDEN in South America. Other
regions may have slightly different band plans. As we can see from the figure,
there are different types of RF networks operating in adjacent spectrum
blocks, which may result in additional RF requirements.
Figure 5.1.2.2-Y: Generic iDEN band plan in South America.
#### 5.1.2.3 Region 3
The 850MHz frequency allocation in China is illustrated in Figure 5.1.2.3-X.
\- 825-835/870-880MHz for CDMA
\- 885-915/930-960MHz for GSM
{width="6.313194444444444in" height="0.5729166666666666in"}
Figure 5.1.2.3-X 850MHz frequency allocation in China
Since the guard band between CDMA downlink and GSM uplink is only 5MHz in
China, the CDMA base station transmitter will cause interference to GSM900
base station receiver in the same geographical area. The extending of 850MHz
will further increase the coexistence inference. Furthermore, current
extension band plan assumption of 806-849/851-894 MHz is overlapping with
existing GSM900 frequency band in China. Therefore, the extension of 850MHz
band is not applicable for China.
## 5.2 Possible duplexer arrangements
### 5.2.1 Split duplexer arrangement
#### 5.2.1.1 UE aspects
The entire band 806-849/851-894 MHz is not possible to cover using a single
duplexer in the UE using any available technology: the duplex gap is only 2
MHz. The option is then to use a split-duplexer arrangement using two
duplexers each covering a sub-part of the band. Figure 5.2.1 shows the general
concept of splitting of the band with a possible overlap between the sub-
bands.
Figure 5.2.1.1: split-band arrangement for 806-849/851-894 MHz (blue part the
entire band under study).
An example of a UE implementation of the arrangement is shown in Figure
5.2.1.2 (note that this is only one possible implementation), two switches "S"
are typically needed for sufficient overall duplexer performance. Each
duplexer filter pair covers a sub-band in Figure 5.2.1.1.
Figure 5.2.1.2: a possible split-duplexer architecture in the UE.
\
#### 5.2.1.1 BS aspects
\
### 5.2.2 Sub-band arrangement
In the LS [2] The International iDEN Operator's Forum requests that one of the
sub-bands be 806-824/851-869 MHz recognizing that the entire band cannot be
covered by a single duplexer. This group of operators is interested in
deploying UMTS or LTE in the aforementioned sub-band. Furthermore, Band 5
could be extended by 10 MHz with a view to cover Band 5, 6, 18 and 19 in a
single duplexer to harmonize existing bands and to increase the amount of
available spectrum in certain regions:
Figure 5.2.2.1: extension of the general 850 MHz band (E850).
These two proposals would suggest choosing F~U_1~ = 814 MHz, F~U_2~ = 824 MHz,
F~D_1~ = 859 MHz and F~D_2~ = 869 MHz in Figure 5.2.2.1, see Figure 5.2.2.2.
Figure 5.2.2.2: option with extended Band 5.
### 5.2.3 UE duplexer filter characteristics for proposed sub-bands
The duplexer characteristics of the band are important for assessment of
specific UE requirements like spurious emission and reference sensitivity as
well as co-existence with other technologies. Provisional duplexer performance
is given for different filter technologies: SAW that is a common technology
for high-volume products and has good performance below 2.5 GHz, and FBAR/BAW
that is becoming available but is more expensive.

We observe that
● there is no significant difference in typical insertion loss according to
5.2.3.2.1.X and 5.2.3.2.1.Z for operation in the Band 5 frequency range at
ambient temperature;
● there is no significant difference for Band 19 implemented with a Band 5
duplexer;
● the influence of temperature variation (across -20 C to +85 C) is smaller
for the Band 5 duplexer, the pass-band of which is narrower;
● the specified performance accounting for temperature and batch variation
better for Band 5 duplexer.

[The specified performance for isolation at RX for the range 814-849/859-894

## 5.3 Specific deployments aspects

### 5.3.1 Region 1
### 5.3.2 Region 2
#### 5.3.2.1 Emission requirements
While there might be different emission rules for different countries, we
recommend the FCC Rules and Industry Canada rules for the iDEN band as an
initial baseline for coexistence studies. The emissions mask requirements are
found in the FCC rules under sections 90.210(g) [4] and 90.691 [5] and for
Industry Canada under RSS-119 [6] which is close to 90.210(g). These rules
apply to both devices and BTSs.
90.210(g) is typically used for single carrier system and 90.691 for multi-
carrier. 90.691 emission limits are as follows:
(a) Out-of-band emission requirement shall apply only to the "outer" channels
included in an EA license and to spectrum adjacent to interior channels used
by incumbent licensees.
(1) For any frequency removed from the EA licensee\'s frequency block by up to
and including 37.5 kHz, the power of any emission shall be attenuated below
the transmitter power (P) in watts by at least 116 Log[10](f/6.1) decibels or
50 + 10 Log[10](P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser
attenuation, where f is the frequency removed from the center of the outer
channel in the block in kilohertz and where f is greater than 12.5 kHz.
(2) For any frequency removed from the EA licensee\'s frequency block greater
than 37.5 kHz, the power of any emission shall be attenuated below the
transmitter power (P) in watts by at least 43 + 10Log[10](P) decibels or 80
decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation, where f is the frequency
removed from the center of the outer channel in the block in kilohertz and
where f is greater than 37.5 kHz.
The measurement bandwidth is not defined in the FCC rules but RSS-119 does
define the measurement bandwidth as 300 Hz at frequency offset less than 37.5
kHz from channel edge and 100 kHz for frequency offsets greater than 37.5 kHz.
Historically, 300 Hz for frequency offsets less than 37.5kHz and 100 kHz for
frequency offsets greater than 37.5kHz have been used for narrow band product
certification in that band. With the 1MHz guard band assumption, the emission
requirement would be 100 kHz. Therefore, the emission limits that would apply
would be -13dBm/100 kHz at a 1MHz offset from the edge of the channel
bandwidth.

### 7.2.1 The range 806-824/851-869 MHz
This section addressed some of the potential coexistence issues that could
occur depending on the markets.
#### 7.2.1.1 LTE vs. Public Safety
Public Safety typically uses lower number of and higher towers than a LTE
system. In addition, Public Safety operators typically design their networks
to operate down to the noise floor. With LTE and Public Safety deployments
being quite different, interference issues could arise.
##### 7.2.1.1.1 LTE BTS Tx OOBE  NB PS portable
Assuming
● The Tx noise from an LTE BS is at most 6dB below NB PS Portable Rx noise
floor.
● NB PS Portable NF = 9dB
● NB PS Portable antenna gain = -6dB
The Tx noise must be less than -127.0dBm/6.25kHz
Assuming FCC rule 90.691 [4] and Industry Canada RSS-119 [5] are used for the
BS Unwanted Emission limits, the LTE BTS Tx emission levels are -3dBm/MHz or
-25dBm/6.25kHz.
Assuming an LTE BS antenna gain of 16dB, antenna feed loss of 3dB and 70dB
path loss between the LTE BS and NB PS portable, an additional 45dB of
attenuation is required.
If using 70 dB port to port isolation, which is less stringent than 70dB MCL
assumption, TX filter requirement = 38dB.
At least 1MHz guard band with RF filter is potentially needed to obtain the
additional isolation.
#### 7.2.1.2 LTE vs. iDEN and other users of the band
While co-location of LTE with iDEN should help the interference, co-location
might not always be possible. If LTE and iDEN deployments are not co-located,
interference could be an issue, especially if the deployments are very
different (e.g., cell size, antenna height, etc).
The interference between LTE and iDEN is studied here.
##### 7.2.1.2.1 LTE BTS TX OOBE  iDEN portable
If FCC rule 90.691 [4] and Industry Canada RSS-119 [5] are for the BS Unwanted
Emission limits, the LTE BS Tx emission levels are -3dBm/MHz as noted in the
previous section or -19dBm/25kHz The maximum tolerable interference level is
-127dBm assuming a 1dB desense criteria, and the interference from LTE BS Tx noise is -89dBm/25 KHz assuming 70dB port to port isolation. Therefore 38dB of additional attenuation is required.
Guard band potentially needed is at least 1 MHz.
##### 7.2.1.2.2 LTE BTS TX Power  iDEN portable (Blocking)
Assuming iDEN portable adjacent channel selectivity of 80dB and a receiver
noise floor of -121dBm, the maximum tolerable interference level at the iDEN
receiver is -41dBm. With the LTE BTS Tx power of 43dBm/5MHz and 70 dB port to
port isolation, no additional attenuation is required.
#### 7.2.1.3 UE to UE and BS to BS coexistence issues at 849-851 MHz
While BS to BS coexistence might be feasible with filters and site
engineering, the UE to UE coexistence might be more difficult to achieve and
is FFS.
##### 7.2.1.3.1 LTE BTS Tx Power  LTE BTS Receiver (Blocking)
LTE TX Pout = 43dBm/5MHz
Assuming minimal coupling loss between LTE BTS and LTE BTS is 50dB, then the
interferer level at LTE BTS is -7dBm/5MHz
From 3GPP TS 36.104 Table 7.5.1-3 Adjacent channel selectivity for Wide Are BS
and Table 7.6.1.1-1 Blocking performance requirement for Wide Area BS, the
minimum LTE receiver protection assuming 6dB desense is -52dBm for adjacent
channels and -43dBm for other in-band channels. Adjusting for a more realistic
1dB desense allowance, the corresponding adjacent and alternate channel
protection becomes -63dBm and -54dBm respectively.
Therefore an additional 56dB of protection is required for an interferer in
the adjacent channel spectrum, while interferers elsewhere in band will only
require an additional 47dB of protection.
##### 7.2.1.3.2 LTE BTS Tx OOBE  LTE BTS Receiver
Assuming a 1dB desense criteria, the Tx noise from LTE BS (5MHz channel) must
be more than 6dB below the LTE BS Rx noise floor. With an LTE BS NF of 5dB,
the Tx noise must be less than -1[1]{.underline}5dBm/MHz. Assuming FCC rule
90.691 [4] and Industry Canada RSS-119 [5] has emission limits, the LTE Tx
power in the LTE Rx bandwidth is -13dBm/100KHz or -3dBm/MHz. Assuming a
coupling loss between LTE Base Stations of 70dB or less, an additional 32dB of
suppression is required.
The 2MHz guard band (849-851 MHz) with RF filter on the BTSs could be enough
for certain typical deployments.
#### 7.2.1.4 LTE vs. Broadcast TV below the band
Interference from TV stations below the proposed UL band to LTE BS can be
mitigated with filters on LTE BS, guard bands, site planning and separation
distances. While these techniques will help with the receiver blocking issue,
the out-of-band emissions from the TV transmitters can only be mitigated with
additional filtering at the TV site or with frequency separation. Interference
from LTE UEs to TV receivers is a similar issue to that found in Band 12 and
will also need further investigation.
**_Two interference mechanisms are considered: OOBE and blocking._**

**_Assume requirement = TX noise \
