# 1 Scope
The present document is part of a series of documents that specify charging
functionality and charging management in GSM/UMTS networks. The GSM/UMTS core
network charging architecture and principles are specified in 3GPP TS 32.240
[2], which provides an umbrella for other charging management TSs that
specify:
  * the content of the CDRs per domain / subsystem / service (offline > charging);
  * the content of real-time charging messages per domain / subsystem / > service (online charging);
  * the functionality of online and offline charging for those domains / > subsystems / services;
  * the interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer > the charging information (i.e. CDRs or charging events).
The complete document structure for these TSs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.240
[2].
The present document specifies the Offline and Online Charging description for
the Short Message Service (SMS), based on the functional description in 3GPP
TS 23.040 [7] and on the SMS over IP in 3GPP TS 23.204 [8]. The present
document does not replace existing offline SMS charging functionality and
therefore is in addition to that defined in 3GPP TS 32.250 [9] and 3GPP TS
32.251 [10]. This charging description includes the offline and online
charging architecture and scenarios specific to SMS, as well as the mapping of
the common 3GPP charging architecture specified in 3GPP TS 32.240 [1] onto
SMS. It further specifies the structure and content of the CDRs for offline
charging, and the charging events for online charging. The present document is
related to other 3GPP charging TSs as follows:
  * The common 3GPP charging architecture is specified in 3GPP TS 32.240 > [2];
  * The parameters, abstract syntax and encoding rules for the CDRs are > specified in 3GPP TS 32.298 [3];
  * A transaction based mechanism for the transfer of CDRs within the > network is specified in TS 32.295 [6];
  * The file based mechanism used to transfer the CDRs from the network > to the operator's billing domain (e.g. the billing system or a > mediation device) is specified in 3GPP TS 32.297 [5];
  * The 3GPP Diameter application that is used for SMS offline and > online charging is specified in 3GPP TS 32.299 [4].
Furthermore, requirements that govern the charging work are specified in 3GPP
TS 22.115 [102].

# 5 SMS charging principles and scenarios
## 5.1 SMS charging principles
### 5.1.1 General principles
The Short Message Service comprises 4 main operational scenarios:
\- Person to Person: The message is sent by a UE as originator and received by
a UE as destination.
\- Person to Application: The message is sent by a UE as originator and
received by a third party application as destination.
\- Application to Person: The message is sent by a third party application as
originator and received by a UE as destination.
\- Application to Application: The message is sent by a third party
application as originator and received by another third party application as
destination.
In addition SMS Nodes may apply services such as value added services
specified in 3GPP TS 22.142 [16], services defined in industry standard
protocols for SM submission from applications in a fixed network (protocols
such as SMPP, UCP/EMI, OIS, CIMD, etc.) or vendor specific services as
endorsed by 3GPP TS 23.040 [7].
As such, the SMS node collects charging information such as:
\- the destination and source addresses applied for an SM;
\- an indication of origination or termination handling;
\- identification of the node(s) and connection(s) involved in the SM
transaction;
\- SM validity period;
\- in scenarios involving an application / VASP, the charging information
describes the identification of the application / VASP;
\- requested SM service type.
### 5.1.2 Segmentation and concatenation
Information about concatenated messages should be sent to the charging systems
in order to apply the appropriate charging models. The charging system may be
required to be stateful to process information about segmented messages.
### 5.1.3 Triggers for generation of charging information
The following service level events shall, based on operator configuration,
trigger the generation of charging information:
\- Simple submission -- based on reception at the SMS node.
\- Enhanced submission -- based on completion of the transaction handling at
the SMS node.
\- Origination retry -- based on the enhanced submission where the initial
handling fails and a redelivery attempt is initiated.
\- Delivery report
\- Termination -- Application to Person scenario only.
\- Termination retry -- Application to Person scenario only -- reattempt
delivery of an SM to a terminating entity;
\- SM service request.
Depending on the charging model applied, a \"refund\" may be necessary for
unsuccessful delivery.
See clause 5.3 for detailed procedures associated with the triggers above.
## 5.2 SMS offline charging scenarios
### 5.2.1 Basic principles
Editor\'s Note: For Further Study.
### 5.2.2 Rf message flows
Editor\'s Note: For Further Study.
### 5.2.3 CDR generation
#### 5.2.3.1 Triggers for xxx-CDR charging information collection
Editor\'s Note: For Further Study.
#### 5.2.3.2 Triggers for xxx-CDR Charging Information Addition

Editor\'s Note: For Further Study.
### 5.2.4 Ga record transfer flows
Editor\'s Note: For Further Study.
### 5.2.5 B~xx~ CDR file transfer
Editor\'s Note: For Further Study.
## 5.3 SMS online charging scenarios
### 5.3.1 Basic principles
SMS online charging uses the Credit Control application as specified in 3GPP
TS 32.299 [4].
SMS charging may use the Immediate Event Charging (IEC) principle or the Event
Charging with Unit Reservation (ECUR) principle as specified in 3GPP TS 32.299
[4]. The chargeable events for subscriber charging are associated with SM
transactions.
An implementation may use either IEC or ECUR for charging events based on
operator configuration.
The units used for quota shall be service specific and based on an SM.
The selection of the OCS is implementation specific as there is no guaranteed
means of providing the OCS address to the CTF.
In addition, SMS charging may use the Refund Account principle when the
operation has not been successfully completed after an Immediate Event
Charging (IEC).
NOTE: For SMSIP, the IP-SM-GW may receive information relevant for online
charging through signalling in IMS.
### 5.3.2 Ro message flows

credit control session is sent to OCS when:
\- Validity time for granted quota expires
\- Granted quota runs out (i.e. a successful event has occurred)
\- Abort-Session-Request is received from the OCS
The expiration of the validity time for quota does not require the SMS
procedures to be terminated. The CTF shall be configurable as to whether on
expiration of validity time, the service should be aborted or not; i.e.
whether the stored message should be deleted and no further (re-)delivery
attempt should be made.
#### 5.3.3.2 Triggers for providing interim information for a SMS Credit

## 6.2 Data description for SMS online charging
### 6.2.1 Ro message contents
#### 6.2.1.0 General
The SMS node generates Debit / Reserve Units information that can be
transferred from the CTF to the OCF. For this purpose, SMS online charging
utilises the _Debit Units and Reserve Units_ procedure that is specified in
the 3GPP Debit / Reserve Units operation in 3GPP TS 32.299 [4].
The SMS node generates refund information that can be transferred from the CTF
to the OCF. For this purpose, it uses REFUND procedure defined in IETF RFC
4006 [12] with extended AVPs.
The _Debit / Reserve Units_ procedure employs the _Debit / Reserve Units
Request_ and _Debit / Reserve Units Response_ messages.
The Refund Account procedure employs the Debit Units Request (Refund Account)
request and response messages.
Table 6.2.1 describes the use of these messages for SMS online charging.

NOTE 1: The case of multi-destinations of SMS refers to SMS and Internet
Electronic Mail interworking as specified in subsclause 3.8 of TS 23.040 [7]
NOTE 2: Implementations vary as to the originator address that is presented to
an end user for a Delivery Report. Typically the originator address either
identifies the SMS node that generated the Delivery Report or the originator
address of a Delivery Report identifies the recipient of the original message
that triggered this Report. It is expected that the charging event contains
the information presented to the end user.
NOTE 3: There is a distinction between short numbers (as conveyed in
originator and/or recipient address fields) and the identification of SM
applications (as carried in SM Originator Interface and/or SM Destination
Interface). Short numbers are used by end users to address a service of an
applications. Multiple short numbers may map to one application capable of
multiple services. The identification of an application is how an application
is know to the operator.
