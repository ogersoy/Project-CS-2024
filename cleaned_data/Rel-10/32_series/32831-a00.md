# Introduction
Performance Management (PM) is a key functionality that provides the operator
with visibility into how its network is performing. Performance measurements
and KPIs are critical inputs into optimization of networks. Accurate and a
rich set of counters delivered in a timely manner is essential for *_trouble
shooting purposes and enable support for_ automatic identification of network
problems and automatic error correction and optimization of the network. ***
**_To that effect, there is a need to provide consistent counters for all
elements in a converged network._**
3GPP has specified with the PM IRP (3GPP TS 32.41x ) an interface for
Performance Management. TMF has in MTOSI and OSSJ capabilities for Performance
Management as well. Currently TMF TIP studies how Performance Management can
be aligned inside TMF.
However, there is no reason why PM functions should be different, and an
aligned management approach would greatly benefit the industry. An example of
alignment within 3GPP SA5 IRP work is that multiple Solution Sets are aligned
in that their supported management features are identical. Advantages of
alignment include:
  * CAPEX reduction (less development cost, less integration cost)
  * OPEX reduction (consistent handling of performance measurements collection)
# 1 Scope
The present document provides consistent and aligned PM and PM interfaces in
3GPP and TMF. The present document:
  * identifies similarities and differences of the PM capabilities in > 3GPP and TMF TIP PM BA;
  * proposes enhancements to 3GPP PM solutions for converged networks > and to satisfy TMF TIP PM BA requirements;
  * identifies any required changes in the 3GPP specifications;
  * identifies any required changes in the TMF specifications (to be > communicated to TMF).
Backwards compatibility of the PM IRP should be maintained as much as possible
by re-using existing specifications to the maximum extent.
The counter collected by each of the Network Elements (NE) and the definition
of those are NE specific and there is no intention to harmonize those.
However KPIs with a network view should be explored.

### 4.1.2 TMF TIP BA Performance Management
This clause provides a comparison between existing 3GPP PM related
specifications and TMF TIP Performance Management Business Agreement. For a
potential harmonization of 3GPP and TMF Performance Management functions, it
is necessary to compare the Business Agreement (BA) requirements and to
understand what already exists.
The comparison is done between the existing and stable 3GPP PM IRP
specifications and TMF PM BA requirements. The goal is to analyze and
determine any recommendations for updates of the PM IRP, which would satisfy
TMF TIP PM BA requirements and identify areas where this work is synergetic
with the model harmonization and FM harmonization work.

## 4.2 Interface (operations) comparison
There are difference in the operations defined in PM IRP and MTOSI PM
interface but at this time harmonization of the two interfaces is seen as low
priority in order to focus on fault and model harmonization needs.
Both TMF BA and 3GPP allow and support sftp as one of the interfaces for
collection and that provides a common mechanism between TMF and 3GPP for PM
collection . The file transfer mechanism is common and more popularly
deployed.
## 4.3 Performance collection methods comparison
The performance management and collection of PM counters business requirements
have been compared and compliance addressed in earlier sections. Some of the
enhancements that can be addressed in the 3GPP specs to comply with all the
requirements have been identified.
Some of the key enhancements identified to align with the BA:
  1. R_TMF_PM_BA_I_0001: 3GPP supports 5,15,30,60 min granularities for production of counters. Reporting Period in 3GPP (Collection) is multiples of GP. The Reporting periods allow for collection of PM counter as multiples of GP. BA requirements as for GP of
  2. 1 minute
  3. 5 minutes
  4. 15 minutes
  5. 30 minutes
  6. 1 hour
  7. X hours (any multiplication of 1 hour, X \ **[3GPP enhancements]{.underline}** : 3GPP to analyse this need and update
> specification accordingly.
  1. R_TMF_PM_BA_I_0004: [Supported file formats]{.underline}
i. The performance API shall support:
ii. 3GPP file format
iii. MTOSI file format
> **[3GPP discussion]{.underline}** : Even though the requirements state both
> formats, is it really necessary to have two different formats? Perhaps here
> is an area where adopting a single format will save integration cost with no
> functional value lost.
  1. R_TMF_PM_BA_I_0033: Proprietary format
> **[3GPP discussion]{.underline}** : This requirement asks for proprietary
> format. It is not clear if that helps with off the shelf OSS to provide post
> processing of PM counters. It seems like the best solution would be to have
> a standard format. This will save integration cost with no functional value
> lost. Should the BA be changed? Guidance from Operators required here.

> []{.underline}

> **[3GPP enhancements]{.underline}** : Enhancement needed to support this.

  1. R_TMF_PM_BA_II_0021: The Performance Management API shall support a query that returns the supported output file formats per producing application (data source) in a case where file based transport mechanism is used

**[3GPP discussion]{.underline}** : If we converge on a single file format
there may be no need to have this support.

  1. R_TMF_PM_BA_II_0041: Ad-hoc collection - The Performance Management API shall support the ability to query performance measurements by sending an ad-hoc query
> []{.underline}
**[3GPP enhancements]{.underline}** : Currently there is no support of ad hoc
collection. Ad hoc collection may not make sense for all PM counters but may
apply to some counters. Enhancements needed to 3GPP to support this
capability. This applies to R_TMF_PM_BA_II_0042, R_TMF_PM_BA_II_0046,
R_TMF_PM_BA_II_0044.

MTOSI 2.0 PM file format can be found at:
http://www.tmforum.org/browse.aspx?catID=6076&linkID=35252&docID=10580
The file formats can be harmonized so the integration/parsing and analysing of
the PM counters form various systems can be cost effective.
One of the top 10 requirements was to move to a simplified, lightweight PM
file format. More analysis will be done on the exact file format and that will
become part of the work item.
# 5 Discussion of PM IF Standards Alignment Options
There are difference in the operations defined in PM IRP and MTOSI PM
interface but at this time harmonization of the two interfaces is seen as low
priority in order to focus on fault and model harmonization needs.
# 6 Recommendations for PM IF Standards Alignment
Conclusions drawn from various discussions related to PM collection, interface
and file format discussion is detailed in section 4 and summarized below.
There are difference in the operations defined in PM IRP and MTOSI PM
interface but at this time harmonization of the two interfaces is seen as low
priority in order to focus on fault and model harmonization needs.
Both TMF BA and 3GPP allow and support sftp as one of the interfaces for
collection and that provides a common mechanism between TMF and 3GPP for PM
collection . The file transfer mechanism is common and more popularly
deployed.
Performance measurement types, definition of counters and KPIs are very
specific to different domains and are being defined for each Network elements
by groups/SDOs that are most knowledgeable in that area. Enhancement of KPIs
and clear, rich definition of counters in a manner that is consistent and
valid in the domain and cross domain based on various converged management
scenarios needs consideration.
The model harmonization work will drive the object modelling and the
association of the PM data with the appropriate object. This is addressed in
3GPP TS 32.828 and TS 32.833.
The performance management business requirements have been compared and
compliance addressed. Some of the enhancements that can be addressed in the
3GPP specs to reduce the gaps have been identified and can be introduced as
CRs.
PM file format in 3GPP and MTOSI are different and there is really no
necessity for it to be different. It is proposed to move to a converged PM
file format taking into account the recommendation in the top 10 to move to a
lightweight format (CSV, ascii, etc).
It is agreed to pursue the relevant changes to address some of the
harmonization and enhancements identified in the TR using CRs.
