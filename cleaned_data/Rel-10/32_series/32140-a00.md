Subscription Management (SuM) is a feature which will develop over a number of
3GPP releases. It is intended to permit Service Providers, Value Added Service
Providers and Mobile Operators to provision services for a specific
subscriber. The feature is necessary to allow Service Providers and Operators
to provision, control, monitor and bill the configuration of services that
they offer to their subscribers. SuM focuses on the OAM processes to manage
subscription information. These correspond to the \'Fulfilment\' Process areas
of the TeleManagement Forum Telecom Operations Map [3].
Within the current version of the present document this is limited to a single
operator\'s network.
SuM is an area of service operation management that sets a complex challenge
for Service Providers and Operators in their support of new or existing
subscribers during their every day network operation.
In 2G solutions the main repository of the subscription information is in the
Home Locations Register (HLR). However the management and administration
interfaces for controlling this information is proprietary to each vendor. The
use of proprietary interfaces is inconvenient for those Operators using
multiple vendors\' equipment since their provisioning systems have to
accommodate multiple proprietary interfaces, which perform essentially
identical functions. Moreover, it makes it more difficult to generate customer
self care applications that allow subscribers to provision, and amend
subscription data.
The 3G environment requires more complex service delivery mechanisms than in
2G and SuM is no longer simply an internal matter for a single operator but a
capability that is achieved by linking together features across multiple
Service Providers and Operators Operations Support Systems (OSS).
Historically, the services provided by Operators have been defined within
standards groups such as ETSI or 3GPP. With the advent of Open Services Access
(OSA) being adopted by 3GPP the User Service Definitions will be replaced by
Service Capabilities traded amongst Service Providers and Network Operators.
This will allow Operators and Service Providers to define customized service
environments that roam with users as they move amongst networks - this is the
Virtual Home Environment (VHE) 3GPP TR 22.121 [9]. This customized service
environment means that subscription information is held in a number of
locations including the Home Network, the Visited Network, the User Equipment,
Application VASP Equipment (e.g. servers accessed by the subscriber for
content and information based services) and the Operations Systems of the
Service Providers, and Operators supporting the subscriber\'s service
subscription.
Service delivery and support across multiple vendors\' solutions and
organizations is a feature of other industries, and the solutions adopted are
secure supply chain solutions based upon mainstream e-commerce principles,
methods and technologies.
Integration Reference Points (IRPs) are specified in separate TSs.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the service requirements and high-level
architecture for SuM.
SuM is expected evolve in stages over several releases of 3GPP specifications.
The present document provides additional supporting material, which whilst not
within the scope of this release, provides an insight towards the future
evolution. This is in order that initial work may be done with an appreciation
of the wider context expected in future releases of 3GPP specifications.
SuM for 3GPP is primarily concerned with the ability to define subscription
profiles and associate the profile with subscribers, users and services that
are authorized by agreements. The subscription profile may be used in the
process of configuring various network resources (access and core) to make the
service a reality for the user.
The management capabilities extend to the creation, modification,
synchronization, and re application of subscription profiles.
The present document is oriented towards a standardized interface into the
Home Subscriber Server (HSS) in order that services can be provisioned and
maintained.
The present document includes information applicable to Network Operators,
content providers, and terminal and network manufacturers.
The present document contains the core requirements for SuM, which are
sufficient to provide management services.
The method by which applications subscribe to OSA is not within the scope of
the present document.

# 4 General description
## 4.1 Subscription Management (SuM) concept
The 3G environment requires more complex service delivery mechanisms than in
2G. The following drivers are leading to a need to standardize SuM Interfaces:
  * Use of different vendor\'s equipment for 2G/2.5G and 3G.
  * The trend in 2/2.5G toward the support of Virtual Network Operators > and Content Providers requiring standardized interfaces amongst > them.
Service delivery and support across multiple vendors\' solutions and
organizations is a feature of other industries, and the solutions are adopted
are secure supply chain solutions based upon mainstream e-commerce principles,
methods and technologies.
SuM is an area of service operation management that permits Service Providers
and Operators to provision services for a specific customer service
subscription.
Specific 3G areas that SuM requirements must address are:
  * Subscription information is distributed across in a number of > locations including the Home Network, the Visited Network, the > User Equipment, Application VASP equipment (e.g. servers accessed > by the subscriber for content and information based services).
  * SuM will allow Service Providers and Operators to provision, control > and monitor the subscription information.
  * SuM is not simply an internal matter for a single operator but a > capability that is achieved by linking together features across > multiple Operators\' Operations Support Systems (OSSs).
  * SuM will need to manage subscription information in e.g. the OSSs, > HSS, UE, OSA, MMS and IMS subsystems.
The conceptual model for SuM is illustrated in figure 1.
Figure 1: High level view of Subscription Management (SuM)
SuM is concerned with provisioning the subscription profile throughout all the
systems and trading partners needed to realize the customer service, SuM
provides specifications that define the interfaces and the procedures that
interconnect the three points of the SuM triangle: Customer Care Center, the
User and the network (s) where the Subscription profile resides (such as HSS,
USIM, etc.).
## 4.2 Partnership with Enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM)
The Enhanced Telecom Operations Map as defined in ITU-T M.3050 [19] [20]
provides a comprehensive framework for operating and running a network.
SuM, in particular the configuration of resources, aligns with subset of the
eTOM model in the area of fulfilment.

## 4.3 SuM operations viewpoint
Figure 2 positions SuM from the viewpoint of operations management.
Figure 2: SuM context within operations management
SuM manages Subscriptions in the form of Subscription profile components. The
subscription profile components may be distributed across Service Management
&Operations (SM&O), Resource Management & Operations (RM&O) and Network
domains in order to easily configure resources and support services at the
Network Operations Management level.
There may also be mappings of subscription profile components between the
SM&O, RM&O and Network domains. In particular, such mapping may exist between
a model of services and service parameters in the SM&O layer and the model of
service parameters in the SuM NRM. Similarly, such mapping may also exists for
identifiers and the concepts of user and subscriber as found in the SuM NRM
to/from other representations of these concepts in the SM&O layer. These
mappings are outside the scope of the SuM NRM.
### 4.3.1 Functional overview
As the telecommunications now entering into the 3G, more powerful terminal and
access technology allows the telecommunications networks to offer new wireless
Multimedia and Internet services.
Accordingly, SuM is a telecommunications management framework that allows the
Operators to leverage their network resources to:
  * Validate (register, authenticate, and authorise.) a request for service from a user;
  * Collect, store, update, and distribute the Service Profile information for the user;
  * Select the trusted network resources to manage access, distribution, and control of the profile data information for the user; and
  * Direct the network resources to promptly deliver the service requested to the user according to said profile information.
SuM fulfils the following essential 3G requirements:
  * The \"**Device Diversity** \" allows access to telecommunications networks by a variety of UEs and devices that are available for the user at the time.
  * The \"**Access Diversity** \" allows the telecommunications networks to offer a variety of access network options such as UTRAN, GERAN, WLAN, etc. to the user.
  * The \"**Service Diversity** \" allows the Telecommunications networks to provide a variety of services delivered to the user from third party application Service Providers (VASP) or from other telecommunications networks (VPLMN).
## 4.4 Management of subscription profiles
Figure 2: Architecture for management of subscription profile components
### 4.4.1 Requirements for subscription profile component management
SuM does not extend to the management of services.
However it is necessary to provide network entities with the subscription
profile components needed for service fulfilment:
1\. Subscription profile management shall support the fulfilment of requests
for service from users, application services, and user equipment.
2\. Subscription profile management shall support requests for subscription
creation, modification and deletion. These requests may originate from users,
subscribers, Network Operators, and Service Providers.
3\. The above requests may be associated with service entities such as the
MMS, IMS etc.
4\. It shall be possible to relate each request for service with the
corresponding Service Profile (SProf) information
5\. The subscription profile information shall be maintained in the HSS.
6\. In order to fulfil services, subscription profile information shall be
distributed among the various network entities.
7\. A subscription profile log shall be created to track changes related to
creation and modification of subscription profiles and subscription profile
components.
8\. A backup copy of the subscription profile shall be created.
9\. Subscription profile information shall be secured by authorised access and
control mechanisms.
### 4.4.2 Requirements for network and terminal provisioning
Figure 3: SuM network and service provisioning
The following steps define a logical sequence of events required for granting
a request for service.
a) A request for service is issued by a user (via the UE).
b) Network receives the request for service and attempts to locate a >
subscriber ID.
c) Once a subscriber ID is identified, it is authenticated if there has > not
already been an initial authentication.
d) A request for service shall be denied if the subscriber cannot be >
identified and authenticated.
e) For those requests for service that are authenticated, the > corresponding
subscription profile components are obtained if they > have not already been
obtained at initial authorization.
f) The subscription profile component provides information on the > services
that are available to the subscriber and correlate the > service request with
a specific subscribed service.
The service is properly set up according to the profile (e.g. QoS, etc.) in
order to prepare for the fulfilment and delivery of the service.
### 4.4.3 Profile management evolution
For SuM stage 2 or 3, SP can expand from the current definition of subscriber
data (e.g. 3GPP TS 23.008 [7]) when appropriate.
Subscription profile supports:
  * Preference management;
  * Service customization;
  * Terminal management;
  * Information sharing;
  * Access permission via a unique key identifier.
The profile data will be distributed (using the Service Profile download
capability) to configure the necessary architectural entities (UE, Servers
etc.).
Subscription profile data needs to be consistently managed across all the
entities within the network that use the profile. The data may be controlled
from a central point, or be distributed, hence the logical database depicted
in figure 4.\ The management capabilities relate to the definition,
modification and synchronization of the data mainly in core network entities.
This may extend to data needed in Terminal Devices, Network Elements, Core
Network entities and Application Servers.
## 4.5 SuM: relationship to Network Entities and other subsystems
### 4.5.1 General
The SuM Feature provides management functions for subsystems, domains and
components some of which are defined in the 3GPP Network Architecture 3GPP TS
23.002 [2]. However the Network Architecture does not address the Mobile
Equipment or the Open Services Architecture nor non 3GPP defined subsystems.
Figure 5 shows this relationship with these entities, many of which are
closely related to the Home Subscriber Server (HSS).
Figure 4: Examples of SuM relationships with Network Architecture
Figure 5 is based upon entities identified in the 3GPP Network Architecture
3GPP TS 23.002 [2].
The Network Architecture identifies a number of entities that use subscription
profile information for their operation.
The SuM feature provisions and audits the subscription profile information
(either directly, or indirectly):
  * **Core Network entities:**
1) Home Subscriber Server (HSS) including Home Location Register (HLR),
Authentication Centre and HSS Logical functions;
2) Visitor Location Register (VLR);
3) Equipment Identity Register (EIR);
4) SMS.- GMSC;
5) SMS Interworking MSC.
  * **Circuit Switched Domain:**
1) MSC Server;
2) Gateway MSC (GMSC).
  * **User Equipment/Mobile Station:**
```{=html}
``` \- Specific entities of the Mobile System as:
    1.  IP Multimedia System (IMS);
    2.  CAMEL Entities;
    3.  Number Portability Database (NPDB);
    4.  Global Text Telephony (GTT) entities.
SuM also provides capabilities to support B2B trading interfaces to other
trading partners: VASP, Virtual mobile Operators etc.
Figure 5 also implies a set of relationships from SuM to:
  * User Equipment Management that is assumed to configure and provision > all aspects of the User Equipment and Terminals, including the > possibility of configuring UICC/USIM profile information, using > MeXe where appropriate.
  * Application Service provided by third parties including trusted > third parties that may configure some USIM via network interfaces, > for example banks and other financial institutions. These services > may also be provided by the Network Operator performing the role > of Application Service provider.
  * Network Service provided by Network Operators (e.g. SMS, presence).
### 4.5.2 Void
# 5 SuM assumptions and methods
The following assumptions are made in developing the SuM requirements.
## 5.1 Business model assumptions
1\. The provider of the service package to the subscriber may be different
from either the Service Provider or the Network Operator.
2\. The model shall allow for retailers, distributors and third parties that
are independent of the Service Provider and the Network Operator.
## 5.2 Network and control assumptions
1\. The invocation of a service feature in real time shall be the
responsibility of the network and any associated control.
## 5.3 Use case method
Use cases are developed using the techniques defined in 3GPP TR 32.803 [18].
An illustrative set of use cases using the method can be found in annex B.
# 6 High-level requirements
## 6.1 General
Figure 5: SuM Entities - Relations
Figure 7 shows the relationships between users, subscribers, subscriptions and
services.
According to the way in which Operators do business:
  * Each Operator has many subscribers;
  * Each subscriber can have several users; and
  * Users can request a service. The request will be granted if for the > user, a contract for the requested service has been signed between > the service provider and a subscriber.
### 6.1.1 Pre-requisites for service
These assertions address some of the operator\'s concerns, prior to granting a
service request to a user:
1\. find a subscriber entity that can match with the user;
2\. identify and verify the subscriber\'s subscription profile; and
3\. ensure the request for service is consistent with the subscription
profile.
## 6.2 Feature requirements
SuM shall provide:
1\. The management of the subscription profile information in the home PLMN.
> 2\. It shall be possible to replicate and distribute the subscription
> profile components.

and systems domains (e.g. VLR in visited networks).
3\. The control and modification of subscription profile information
consistent with the customer care needs including self help, self diagnosis
and fault diagnosis.
\- SuM shall provide a process to support subscribers wishing to check their
Subscription Configuration (e.g. support self care).
### 6.2.1 Requirements on HSS/HLR
The master database where subscription profile components are stored is in the
HSS/HLR, which is used by the network for distribution and replication of this
data in other subsystems such as the PS, CS and IM domains, CAMEL, etc.
1\. SuM shall allow for the creating, reading, updating and deleting of
subscription profile data in the HSS/HLR.
2\. SuM shall support the data described in 3GPP TS 23.008 [7].
### 6.2.1.1 PS domain
1\. SuM shall manage subscription profile components within the HSS for the PS
Domain.
### 6.2.1.2 CS domain
1\. SuM shall manage subscription profile components within the HSS for the CS
Domain.
### 6.2.1.3 IM CN Sub-system (IMS)
1\. SuM shall manage subscription profile components within the HSS for the
IMS defined in reference 3GPP TS 23.228 [8].

the HSS for the EIR
2\. SuM shall support Subscription Data defined in reference 3GPP TS 22.041
[13], 3GPP TS 23.015 [14].
## 6.3 Security
1\. Specific local, national, and regional security regulations shall be
complied with.
2\. SuM data shall be safeguarded against unapproved disclosure or usage.
3\. SuM data shall be provided in a secure and reliable manner that ensures
the information is neither lost nor corrupted.
4\. Access to SuM data shall only be permitted in an authorised and secure
manner
5\. Secure mechanisms shall be available for the transfer of SuM data to, from
or between authorised entities.\ The secure mechanisms to be applied shall be
appropriate to the level of confidentiality of the data, the endpoints of the
transfer and the routes that are available for the transfer of the data.
6\. Audit records should be maintained for all SuM transactions to facilitate
resolution of security violations.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Business model
# A.1 Processes
Processes involved in SuM can be described by the e-Business Telecom
Operations Map (TOM) version 2.1. It is the Fulfilment part that describes
those processes. The present document mainly focus on the Development and
Operations Process, Network and System Management Processes and on the Network
Element Management process.
The MWIF business model MTR-002 [4] shows an organizational model for Trading
partners co-operating to provide wireless mobile services, the terms used in
this example may not coincide exactly with those used in other parts of the
present document, e.g. Subscriber and Customer are believed to be equivalent.
{width="6.652083333333334in" height="3.670138888888889in"}
Figure A.1: Assumed Business Model
In this business model the Subscriber is a customer of the Service Provider
(SP).
Commercial agreements are set up and maintained between them for the provision
of services from the SP to the User via the Network Operator.
The Subscriber may have contracts with multiple SPs and maintains these on
behalf of one or more users.
The Subscriber informs the SP which services each user should have access to
and may choose to set limits on how much a User can use a particular service.
For instance the Subscriber may authorize \$x a day of video calls with a high
QoS and unlimited video calls with a lower QoS.
The SP must enter into contract(s) with one or more Network Operators in order
to deliver services to Users. Other companies may wish to sell services
without having a contract with a Network Operator. This can be achieved by
adopting the role of Third Party Service Provider and selling service via the
SP. Other Companies may wish to sell just content. This is made possible by
developing a commercial relationship with either a SP or a Third Party Service
Provider.
It is important to note that Service Use, Customer Service Negotiation, etc
are roles , and that one Actor may adopt more than one role. For instance an
individual may adopt the roles of both Service Use and Customer Service
Negotiation. A Company may adopt the roles of Network Operator, SP and Content
Provider.
A user initiates a service by requesting it from the Service Provider, not the
Network Operator. On receipt of a service request the Service Provider uses
Network Operators and Third Party Service Providers to service the request in
the best way possible. In the example of the video call the Service Provider
may choose to use different Network Operators for high and low QoS calls.
Taking the VHE concept, where HE, HE-VASP are defined and VASP is used:
  * The roles Service Provider and Network Operator can be mapped to the > actor HE (See 3GPP TS 22.121 [9]).
  * The role Service Provider can be mapped to the actor VASP.
  * The role Third Party Service Provider can be mapped to the actor > HE-VASP, because they both provide services on behalf of an actor > having the Service Provider role.
The Subscriber-to-Service Provider relation (indicated as a Commercial Link
between Service Provider and Subscriber) defines the agreements under which
the Service Provider provides services to a Subscriber. The users associated
to the Subscriber consume these services. (See Subscriber definition in 3GPP
TR 21.905 [1].)
There are also Business-to-Business relations in the picture, where several
actors may be involved in the delivery of services. Examples of such are the
Commercial Link between Service Provider and Third Party Service Provider, the
Commercial Link between Third Party Service Provider and Content Provider and
the Commercial Link between Service Provider and Network Operator.
The present document has the focus on the Subscriber-Service Provider role
relation.
# A.2 Assumptions concerning actors and roles
Below follows assumptions originated from figure A.1:
  * An actor taking the role as a Service Provider offers services to > one or several Subscribers.
  * An actor Network Operator can take the role as a Service Provider > and provide access network services (e.g. PLMN services according > to 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] definition) to one or several Subscribers.
  * An actor Service Provider may fulfil his role and provide value > added services to one or several Subscribers. He can do so by:
```{=html}
``` \- A pure value added service offering, which may result in established >
B2B agreements with Network Operators.
  * An aggregated offering of access network services (Network Operator > role) and value added services (offering a home environment).
```{=html}
``` \- An actor Service Provider may establish B2B agreements with Network >
Operators and become an MVNO.
  * An actor Service Provider may have B2B agreements with one or > several Content Providers, from which he can provide content based > services.
  * An actor Service Provider may have B2B agreements with and one or > several 3^rd^ party Service Providers, from which he can package > and provide services from.
  * An actor 3^rd^ party Service Provider may have B2B agreements with > one or several Content Providers, which can provide content.
  * An actor taking the role as a Service Provider may establish one or > several subscriptions with a Subscriber.
  * When, based on an agreement between a Subscriber and a Service > Provider, an access to a provided service exists; it can be > associated to a subscription.
  * A User consumes services, where the user role in this context is > defined by the service consumed.
# A.3 SuM scope from actor/role model
SuM is about managing subscriptions tied to one actor taking the Service
Provider Role. Systems affected are those within the Service Provider domain
(systems that a Service Provider controls and manages) and those systems
outside that take part in the service delivery to the user of the service
provided. The latter means: Actors having those systems have B2B agreements
with a Service Provider for the purpose of delivering services (examples are:
3^rd^ party Service Providers, Content Providers and Network Operators).
# A.4 Business model requirements
1\. SuM feature shall support the distribution of SuM components across intra
operator organizations and administrative domains to support industry business
model.\ Annex A provides an example business model from MWIF MTR-002 [4].
2\. SuM shall allow for the optional use of third parties to facilitate
trading relationship between organizations. This requirement is needed for
trusted third parties but not limited to trusted third parties
###### ## Annex B (informative): Example use case
There are an expanding number of services that 3G can offer. The network and
infrastructure resources that are needed to support the new services are
complex, and require a systematic technique to consider the many factors
involved.
Use cases provide an iterative analysis technique helpful in determining
market potential, business transactions, and the user interactions, etc.
When a use case has been developed (i.e. become stable), possible network
solution(s) may be developed.
It is anticipated that future complex services will require a systematic
analysis method to evaluate the network impacts.
There is a desire to migrate away from developing a solution for each service
opportunity on an individual case-by-case basis, and to deploy a consistent
approach in order that the network architecture solution may be used to
provide many different service needs.
