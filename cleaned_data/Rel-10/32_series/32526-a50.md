# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TS 32.101 [2], 3GPP TS 32.102 [3] and TR 21.905 [1] and the following
apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the
definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TS 32.522 [4], 3GPP TS 32.101
[2], 3GPP TS 32.102 [3] and TR 21.905 [1], in that order.
**XML file:** file containing an XML document
**XML document:** composed of the succession of an optional XML declaration
followed by a root XML element
NOTE 1: See [7]; in the scope of the present document.
**XML declaration:** it specifies the version of XML being used
NOTE 2: See [7].
**XML element:** has a type, is identified by a name, may have a set of XML
attribute specifications and is either composed of the succession of an XML
start-tag followed by the XML content of the XML element followed by an XML
end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag; each XML element may
contain other XML elements
NOTE 3: See [7].
**empty XML element:** having an empty XML content; an empty XML element still
possibly has a set of XML attribute specifications; an empty XML element is
either composed of the succession of an XML start-tag directly followed by an
XML end-tag, or composed simply of an XML empty-element tag
NOTE 4: See [7].
**XML content (of an XML element):** empty if the XML element is simply
composed of an XML empty-element tag; otherwise the part, possibly empty, of
the XML element between its XML start-tag and its XML end-tag
**XML start-tag:** the beginning of a non-empty XML element is marked by an
XML start-tag containing the name and the set of XML attribute specifications
of the XML element
NOTE 5: See [7].
**XML end-tag:** the end of a non-empty XML element is marked by an XML end-
tag containing the name of the XML element
NOTE 6: See [7].
**XML empty-element tag:** composed simply of an empty-element tag containing
the name and the set of XML attribute specifications of the XML element
NOTE 7: See [7].
**XML attribute specification:** has a name and a value
NOTE 8: See [7].
**DTD:** defines structure and content constraints to be respected by an XML
document to be valid with regard to this DTD
NOTE 9: See [7].
**XML schema:** more powerful than a DTD, an XML schema defines structure and
content constraints to be respected by an XML document to conform with this
XML schema; through the use of XML namespaces several XML schemas can be used
together by a single XML document; an XML schema is itself also an XML
document that shall conform with the XML schema for XML schemas
NOTE 10: See [8], [9] and [10].
**XML namespace:** enables qualifying element and attribute names used in XML
documents by associating them with namespaces identified by different XML
schemas
NOTE 11: See [11], in the scope of the present document.
**XML complex type:** defined in an XML schema; cannot be directly used in an
XML document; can be the concrete type or the derivation base type for an XML
element type or for another XML complex type; ultimately defines constraints
for an XML element on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML content
NOTE 12: See [8], [9] and [10].
**XML element type:** declared by an XML schema; can be directly used in an
XML document; as the concrete type of an XML element, directly or indirectly
defines constraints on its XML attribute specifications and/or its XML
content; can also be the concrete type or the derivation base type for another
XML element type
NOTE 13: See [8], [9] and [10].
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905
[1], 3GPP TS 32.522 [4] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TS 32.522 [4], 3GPP TS 32.101 [2], 3GPP TS
32.102 [3] and TR 21.905 [1], in that order.

# 4 Solution Set definitions
This specification defines the following 3GPP SON Policy NRM IRP Solution Set
definitions:
\- 3GPP SON Policy NRM IRP CORBA SS (see Annex A)
\- 3GPP SON Policy NRM IRP XML definitions (see Annex B)
###### ## Annex A (normative): CORBA Solution Set
This annex contains the CORBA Solution Set for the IRP whose semantics is
specified in SON Policy NRM IRP: Information Service (3GPP TS 32.522 [4]).
# A.1 Architectural Features
The overall architectural feature of CS IRP is specified in 3GPP TS 32.522
[4].
This clause specifies features that are specific to the CORBA SS.
## A.1.1 Syntax for Distinguished Names and Versions
The syntax of a Distinguished Name is defined in 3GPP TS 32.300 [12].
# A.2 Mapping
## A.2.1 General mapping
Attributes modelling associations as defined in the NRM (here also called
\"reference attributes\") are in this SS mapped to attributes. The names of
the reference attributes in the NRM are mapped to the corresponding attribute
names in the MOC. When the cardinality for an association is 0..1 or 1..1 the
datatype for the reference attribute is defined as an MOReference. The value
of an MO reference contains the distinguished name of the associated MO. When
the cardinality for an association allows more than one referred MO, the
reference attribute will be of type MOReferenceSet, which contains a sequence
of MO references.

###### ## Annex B (normative): XML definitions
The annex specifies the XML definitions for the SON Policy NRM IRP as it
applies to Itf-N, in accordance with SON NRM IRP IS definitions [4].
An application of these XML definitions is to build a configuration file for
transfer with the Bulk CM IRP using either CORBA Solution Set or the SOAP
Solution Set of 3GPP TS 32.616 [5]. For this annex, the basic part of the XML
file format definition is provided by 3GPP TS 32.616 [5].
Other applications of these XML definitions are the SOAP solution sets of
other IRPs that perform operations on managed objects, for example the Basic
CM IRP SOAP SS of 3GPP TS 32.606 [6].
# B.1 Architectural features
The overall architectural feature of SON Policy Network Resource Model IRP is
specified in 3GPP TS 32.522 [4]. This clause specifies features that are
specific to the XML definitions.
The XML definitions of this document specify the schema for a configuration
content.
When using the XML definitions for a configuration file transfer with the Bulk
CM IRP, using either CORBA Solution Set or SOAP Solution Set of 3GPP TS 32.616
[5], the basic part of the XML file format definition is provided by 3GPP TS
32.616 [5]. The XML definitions of this document provide the schema for the
configuration content to be included in such a configuration file.
When using the XML definitions with a SOAP solution set of any interface IRP
that perform operations on managed objects, for example the Basic CM IRP SOAP
SS of 3GPP TS 32.606 [6], the XML definitions of this document provides the
schema for the configuration content operated on by the interface IRP. Such
configuration content can be name of managed object and, if applicable, IOC
attributes.
## B.1.1 Syntax for Distinguished Names
The syntax of a Distinguished Name is defined in 3GPP TS 32.300 [12].
# B.2 Mapping
## B.2.1 General mapping
An IOC maps to an XML element of the same name as the IOC\'s name in the IS.
An IOC attribute maps to a sub-element of the corresponding IOC\'s XML
element, and the name of this sub-element is the same as the attribute\'s name
in the IS.
## B.2.2 Information Object Class (IOC) mapping
The overall description of the file format of configuration data XML files is
provided by 3GPP TS 32.616 [5].
Annex A of the present document defines the NRM-specific XML schema
sonPolicyNrm.xsd for the SON Policy NRM IRP IS defined in 3GPP TS 32.522 [4].
XML schema sonPolicyNrm.xsd explicitly declares NRM-specific XML element types
for the related NRM.
The definition of those NRM-specific XML element types complies with the
generic mapping rules defined in 3GPP TS 32.616 [5].
# B.3 Solution Set definitions
## B.3.1 XML definition structure
Clause B.3.2 provides XML definitions of SON Policy NRM IRP IOCs as defined in
3GPP TS 32.522 [4].
## B.3.2 XML Schema "sonPolicyNrm.xsd"
The following XML schema sonPolicyNrm.xsd is the NRM-specific schema for the
SON Policy Network Resource Model IRP NRM defined in 3GPP TS 32.522 [4]:
