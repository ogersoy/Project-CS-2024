# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
**32.661 Configuration Management (CM); Kernel CM Requirements**
**32.662 Configuration Management (CM); Kernel CM Information Service (IS)**
32.666: Configuration Management (CM); Kernel CM Integration Reference Point
(IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions
Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines, in addition to the requirements defined in [1],
[2] and [3], the requirements for the present IRP: Kernel Configuration
Management IRP. It is the intent of Kernel Configuration Management to provide
an IRP that contains the configuration management functionality that is basic
and minimal. It is the functionality that is common to and required by both
Basic CM and Bulk CM. While neither the Basic CM IRP nor Bulk CM IRP requires
the other, they each require the Kernel CM IRP.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**data:** any information or set of information required to give software or
equipment or combinations thereof a specific state of functionality
**Element Manager (EM):** provides a package of end-user functions for
management of a set of closely related types of Network Elements (NEs). These
functions can be divided into two main categories:
_Element Management Functions_ for management of NEs on an individual basis.
These are basically the same functions as supported by the corresponding local
terminals.
_Sub-Network Management Functions_ that are related to a network model for a
set of NEs constituting a clearly defined sub-network, which may include
relations between the NEs. This model enables additional functions on the sub-
network level (typically in the areas of network topology presentation, alarm
correlation, service impact analysis and circuit provisioning).
**IRP:** See 3GPP TS 32.101 [1].
**IRP Information Model:** See 3GPP TS 32.101 [1].
**IRP Information Service:** See 3GPP TS 32.101 [1].
**IRP Solution Set:** See 3GPP TS 32.101 [1].
**Managed Object (MO):** abstract entity, which may be accessed through an
open interface between two or more systems, and representing a Network
Resource (NR) for the purpose of management. The Managed Object (MO) is an
instance of a Managed Object Class (MOC) as defined in a Management
Information Model (MIM). The MIM does not define how the MO or NR is
implemented; only what can be seen in the interface.
**Managed Object Class (MOC):** description of all the common characteristics
for a number of MOs, such as their attributes, operations, notifications and
behaviour
**Managed Object Instance (MOI):** instance of a MOC, which is the same as a
MO as described above
**Management Information Base (MIB):** set of existing managed objects in a
management domain, together with their attributes, constitutes that management
domain\'s MIB. The MIB may be distributed over several OS/NEs.
**Management Information Model (MIM):** also referred to as NRM -- see the
definition below. There is a slight difference between the meaning of MIM and
NRM -- the term MIM is generic and can be used to denote any type of
management model, while NRM denotes the model of the actual managed
telecommunications Network Resources (NRs).
**Network Element (NE):** discrete telecommunications entity, which can be,
managed over a specific interface e.g. the RNC
**Network Manager (NM):** provides a package of end-user functions with the
responsibility for the management of a network, mainly as supported by the
EM(s) but it may also involve direct access to the NEs. All communication with
the network is based on open and well-standardised interfaces supporting
management of multi-vendor and multi-technology NEs.
**Network Resource (NR):** component of a NE, which can be identified as a
discrete separate entity and is in an object oriented environment for the
purpose of management represented by an abstract entity called Managed Object
(MO)
**Network Resource Model (NRM):** model representing the actual managed
telecommunications Network Resources (NRs) that a System is providing through
the subject IRP. An NRM describes Managed Object Classes (MOC), their
associations, attributes and operations. The NRM is also referred to as
\"MIM\" (see above) which originates from the ITU-T TMN.
**Object Management Group (OMG):** See http://www.omg.org.
**Operations System (OS):** indicates a generic management system, independent
of its location level within the management hierarchy

# 4 Requirements
## 4.1 General Requirements
This requirements specification defines requirements for the IS for this IRP.
As such, capabilities specified here as being required in the IS are not
necessarily required in the product implementation. That which is required in
the product implementation will be specified in the IS itself.
The following general and high-level requirements apply for the present IRP:
A. IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.101 [1].
B. IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
C. IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.600 [3].
In addition to the above, the following more specific requirements apply:
1\. The IS defined by this IRP shall enable an NM to operate on (access) any
NRMs defined in any NRM IRPs, such as those defined in [4], [5], [6], [7] and
[8].
2\. The IS defined by this IRP shall as far as possible be independent of any
specific definitions of MOCs, attributes etc. in the NRMs referred to in item
1.
## 4.2 Kernel CM Requirements
The IS defined by this IRP shall include the following operations that may be
invoked by the IRP Manager to retrieve management information from the
IRPAgent:
\- An operation to retrieve the Network Resource IRP SS document versions
(IRPVersions) of the NRM Solution Sets that are supported by each Network
Resource IRP present in the subject implementation.
The IS defined by this IRP shall include a notification capability by which
the IRPAgent sends management information to the IRPManager whenever an event
of a specific type occurs. Whether these notifications are mandatory or
optional is specified in the Information Service (3GPP TS 32.662 [8]).
Specifically, the following types of notifications shall be supported:
  * A notification that identifies the instance of a managed object that was created.
  * A notification that identifies one or more instances of a managed object that were deleted.
  * A notification that identifies the values of one or more attributes of a managed object instance that were changed.
  * A notification that enables reporting of state and status changes of a managed object instance.
  * A notification which identifies that part of or the whole configuration information of managed system should be synchronized.
