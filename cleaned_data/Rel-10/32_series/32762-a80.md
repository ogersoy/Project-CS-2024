# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:

definitions
# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
E-UTRAN Network Resource Model (NRM) IRP, through which an IRPAgent can
communicate configuration management information to one or several IRPManagers
concerning E-UTRAN resources. The E-UTRAN NRM IRP comprises a set of
specifications defining Requirements, a protocol neutral Information Service
and one or more Solution Set(s).
The present document specifies the protocol neutral E-UTRAN NRM IRP:
Information Service (IS). It reuses relevant parts of the Generic NRM IRP: IS
in 3GPP TS 32.622 [6], either by direct reuse or sub-classing, and in addition
to that defines E-UTRAN specific Information Object Classes.
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an Interface IRP such
as the \"Basic CM IRP\" is needed (3GPP TS 32.602 [7]). However, which
Interface IRP is applicable is outside the scope of the present document.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TS 32.150 [16], TS 32.101 [1], TS 32.102 [2] and TS 21.905 [17] and the
following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over
the definition of the same term, if any, in TS 32.150 [16], TS 32.101 [1], TS
32.102 [2] and TS 21.905 [17], in that order.
**Association** : In general it is used to model relationships between Managed
Objects. Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:
(1) [name bindings]{.underline},
(2) [reference attributes]{.underline}, and
(3) [association objects]{.underline}.
This IRP stipulates that containment associations shall be expressed through
name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other types of
associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate entities in
the object models (UML diagrams).
**Managed Element (ME)** : An instance of the Information Object Class
ManagedElement defined in TS 32.622 [6].
**eNodeB:** A logical node responsible for radio transmission/reception in one
or more cells to/from the User Equipment.\ It terminates the S1 interface
towards the EPC.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TS 32.150
[16], TS 32.101 [1], TS 32.102 [2] and TS 21.905 [17] and the following apply.
An abbreviation defined in the present document takes precedence over the
definition of the same abbreviation, if any, in TS 32.150 [16], TS 32.101 [1],
TS 32.102 [2] and TS 21.905 [17], in that order.

# 4 System overview
## 4.1 Compliance rules
The following defines the meaning of Mandatory and Optional IOC attributes and
associations between IOCs, in Solution Sets to the IRP defined by the present
document:
  * The IRPManager shall support all mandatory attributes/associations. The IRPManager shall be prepared to receive information related to mandatory as well as optional attributes/associations without failure; however the IRPManager does not have to support handling of the optional attributes/associations.
  * The IRPAgent shall support all mandatory attributes/associations. It may support optional attributes/associations.
An IRPAgent that incorporates vendor-specific extensions shall support normal
communication with a 3GPP SA5â€‘compliant IRPManager with respect to all
Mandatory and Optional information object classes, attributes and associations
without requiring the IRPManager to have any knowledge of the extensions.
Given that
  * rules for vendor-specific extensions remain to be fully specified, > and
  * many scenarios under which IRPManager and IRPAgent interwork may > exist,
it is recognised that the IRPManager, even though it is not required to have
knowledge of vendor-specific extensions, may be required to be implemented
with an awareness that extensions can exist and behave accordingly.
# 5 Modelling approach
The modelling approach adopted and used in this IRP is described in TS 32.622
[6].

NOTE 1: If an instance of the _ServesRN_ association is present, then a
corresponding instance of _ServedByEGC_ must be present. In this case, the
ENBFunction and RNFunction instances are under the management scope of the
same IRPAgent.\ If an instance of the _ServesExtRN_ association is present,
then a corresponding instance of _ServedByExtEGC_ must be present. In this
case, the ENBFunction and RNFunction instances are under the management scope
of two different IRPAgents.

NOTE: Attributes isRemoveAllowed and isHOAllowed each has 2 legal values,
allow (A) and prohibited (P). The two attributes are semantically equivalent
to one attribute with 4 legal values such as:
hOAllow; hOProhibited; hOWhiteListed; hOBlackListed;
where
\- hOAllow == isRemoveAllowed is A and isHOAllowed is A;
\- hOProhibited == isRemoveAllowed is A and isHOAllowed is P;
\- hOWhiteListed == isRemoveAllowed is P and isHOAllowed is A;
\- hOBlackListed == isRemoveAllowed is P and isHOAllowed is P.
Therefore, the choice of an option is FFS.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Notifications during a Cell Outage
Compensation
The following sequence diagrams and table show an example how notifications of
IOC CellOutageCompensationInformation and other notifications are used to
inform an IRPManager about the COC activities.
The sequence diagrams show the basic event flow, the table gives more details
on selected, most relevant, content of the notifications.
Figure A-1: Sequence diagram of COC, part 1
Figure A-2: Sequence diagram of COC, part 2
Legend for the table:\ Notifications in _italic font_ are not directly
triggered by COC activities, but help to give a full picture.:\ Notification
content in **bold font** indicates a changed attribute value.
