# Introduction
A number of issues with version handling in the current set of SA5 OAM
specifications have recently been detected.\ It is therefore important to make
an inventory of the current situation, identify issues and recommend a
solution.
# 1 Scope
The scope of the study is to:
  * Document current version handling capabilities in SA5 OAM > specifications (clause 5)
  * Identify and agree on the use cases and requirements (clause 6) for > a coherent approach for version handling capabilities for SA5 OAM > specifications
  * Identify solution(s) with pros and cons to support the identified > requirements (clause 7). The solutions may require enhancement or > modification of rules in the IRP methodology as well as > enhancements of existing or addition of new IRP specifications, > utilizing SOA capabilities where appropriate. This includes:
  * The identification of entities that require version control (clause > 7.1)
  * The protocol(s) by which the entity version can be discovered and > registered (clause 7.2)
  * Recommend a solution (clause 8).
Note: \"Version handling\" in the context of this study addresses what kind of
support for version information that is available over the Itf-N interface,
i.e. what the IRPManager can \"see\" regarding which versions of the 3GPP
specifications that are supported by the IRPAgent, for which object instances
etc.

# 4 Concepts and background
The majority of SA5 specifications today are specified as Integration
Reference Points (IRPs) following the concept and methodology outlined in the
32.15x-series specifications. There are three categories of IRP specifications
(see formal and more detailed definitions in clause 3.1 of 3GPP TS 32.150
[2]):
  * Interface IRPs
  * NRM IRPs
  * Data Definition IRPs
# 5 Current version handling capabilities
## 5.1 General
The version handling for Interface IRPs and NRM IRPs is managed with different
operations and parameters.\ Version handling for the Data Definition IRPs does
not exist.
However, there are a few specifications that are not IRPs and which do not
follow the same version handling concept. Some specifications do not have any
version handling support at all e.g.: Performance measurements, KPI and
Subscriber and Equipment Trace specifications.
Furthermore, the SOA architectural concept has been introduced in the 3GPP
Management Reference Model -- see clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 32.101 [3]. There is a
need to consider if there are any additional needs for version handling
support with respect to SOA.
## 5.2 Interface IRPs
### 5.2.1 Generic IRP Management
3GPP TS 32.311 [x] (Generic IRP Management ): Generic parameter definition
\"**IRP document version number string** \" (a.k.a \"IRPVersion\").
3GPP TS 32.311 [x] and 3GPP TS 32.312 [x]: Generic version retrieval function
**GetIRPVersion().** This operation is inherited by all \"domain specific\"
Interface IRPs, such as Alarm IRP IS [x], and mapped to local specific
operation/method names in the respective Solution Sets. This operation is used
for the IRPManager to find out which **Interface** IRP SS versions that are
supported by an IRPAgent.
The definition of GetIRPVersion is as follows: **\"**_IRPManager wishes to
find out the IRP SS versions supported by an IRP. The IRP shall respond with a
set of supported IRP SS version(s). The list of returned IRP versions is such
that the IRPManager can use any of these versions without having to specify an
IRPVersion to the IRPAgent_.\".
The definition of the operation's output parameter (except the \"status\")
named versionNumberSet is: \"_It indicates one or more SS version numbers
(IRPVersion, as defined by \"IRP document version number string\" in clause
3.1) supported by the IRP.\"_
### 5.2.2 Entry Point IRP (EP IRP)
EP IRP in 3GPP TS 32.362 [4] has an operation named getIRPOutline. It takes as
input an IRPVersion parameter which specifies one or all supported
IRPVersions. As output is returned a supportedIRPList parameter.
getIRPOutline is defined as follows:
The IRPManager uses this operation to request the EPIRP to return the outline
information of the supported IRPs. IRPManager could set a filter constraint on
the returned information according to specific requirements.
The EPIRP shall return the outline information of all the IRPs, including
itself and other EPIRP instances that it knows, supported by the IRPAgent that
contains the EPIRP.
The EPIRP may additionally return the outline information of all the IRPs,
including EPIRP instances, supported by other IRPAgents.
## 5.3 NRM IRPs
### 5.3.1 Operations for NRM IRP versions
3GPP TS 32.662 (Kernel CM IRP): Operation **getNRMIRPVersion**. This operation
is used for the IRPManager to find out which **NRM** IRP SS versions that are
supported by an IRPAgent. However, it does not indicate which NRM versions
that are supported in each of the instantiated managed objects of the MIB.
The first and main part of the definition of getNRMIRPVersion reads as
follows:
\"When the IRPManager invokes getNRMIRPVersion to find out the Network
Resource IRP SS document versions (IRPVersions) supported by the IRPAgent, the
IRPAgent shall respond, via the versionNumberList output parameter, with a
list of supported Network Resource IRPversions.\ The rule for deriving the IRP
document version number string is defined in 3GPP TS 32.311 [20].\ An example
of this return value can contain two IRPVersions, where one indicates the 3GPP
Generic Network Resource IRPVersion (e.g. \"32.623 V4.2\" in case of CORBA
implementation) while the other indicates the 3GPP UTRAN Network Resource
IRPVersion (e.g. \"32.643 V4.1\" in case of CORBA implementation).
It is expected that vendors may provide vendor-specific extended capabilities
and features (VSE) that are based on a 3GPP published specification. It is
further expected that the vendor will publish these VSE in a document with an
unambiguous identification. \".
getNRMIRPVersion returns two parameters (except the \"status\"):
  * versionNumberList: \"It carries one or more SS version numbers supported by this IRP agent.\", and
  * vSEVersionNumberList: \"It carries one or more identifications of vendor published documents containing VSE NRMs specifications.\".
### 5.3.2 Generic NRM IRP
The two IOCs ManagedElement and ManagementNode contain the following
attribute: **swVersion**. It is defined as \"The software version of the
ManagementNode or ManagedElement (this is used for determining which version
of the vendor specific information is valid for the ManagementNode or
ManagedElement).\".
The IOC VsDataContainer contains the following attribute:
**vsDataFormatVersion**. It is defined as \"Name of the data format file,
including version.\".
## 5.4 Data Definition IRPs
### 5.4.1 State Management IRP
Version handling for the Data Definition IRPs does not exist (currently State
Management IRP is the only DD IRP).
## 5.5 Other management definitions
### 5.5.1 Performance measurements and KPIs
PM file format has version handling, consisting of
  * File format version
  * NE SW version
Measurement definitions do not have version handling.
KPIs are FFS.
### 5.5.2 Trace functions
The Trace file XML schema (see 32.423 [11] Annex A.1) file header contains a
version number.
### 5.5.3 SOA entities
FFS.
## 5.6 Release 9 features
This clause gives an overview of the current version handling capabilities by
listing the 3GPP Release 9 features/capabilities allowing IRPManager to
discover version information of certain managed entities, e.g. PM file format
version, IRPVersion of an YyyIRP, etc.

## 5.7 Issues
The following issues and inconsistencies with version handling have been
identified in the current set of SA5 specifications.
Issue 1: Network Resource Model (NRM) object version handling
> In today's set of standard IRP specifications, there is support for an
> IRPManager to retrieve a list from the IRPAgent about which IRPVersion(s)
> (of the NRM IRP SSs) that the IRPAgent supports, one or more. But if the
> IRPAgent supports more than one IRPVersion, there is no standardised way to
> know which IRPVersion that a particular Managed Object (MO) instance belongs
> to. Thus, there is an information gap on Itf-N which needs to be filled.
Issue 2: Version handling of Interface IRPs versus NRM IRPs
> For IRPManager to obtain the IRPVersion(s) of an IRPAgent\'s supported
> Interface IRPs and supported NRM IRPs, IRPManager needs different
> operations. It might be beneficial for IRPManager to use
> identical/similar/same operation (to achieve some level of consistency) to
> obtain the two different kind of information.
Issue 3: Version handling of management information such as alarms,
measurements and trace data
> Currently there is no version handling defined in SA5 for management
> information such as alarms, measurements and trace data.
Issue 4: SOA support
> As SA5 have recently (Rel-9) introduced SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)
> for IRPs, SA5 should also study if and how the version handling can satisfy
> the needs of SOA, and how SOA may provide capabilities for a coherent
> version handling (e.g. registration & discovery).
# 6 Use cases and requirements
The objective of this clause is to Identify and agree on the use cases and
