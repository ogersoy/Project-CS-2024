# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project: Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:
32.411: \"Performance Management (PM) Integration Reference Point (IRP):
Requirements\"
**32.412: \"Performance Management (PM) Integration Reference Point (IRP):
Information Service (IS)\"**
32.416: \"Performance Management (PM) Integration Reference Point (IRP);
Solution Set (SS) definitions\"
The present document is part of a set of TSs which describes the requirements
and information model necessary for the Telecommunication Management (TM) of
3G systems. The TM principles and TM architecture are specified in 3GPP TS
32.101 [1] and 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
A 3G system is composed of a multitude of Network Elements (NE) of various
types and, typically, different vendors, which inter-operate in a co-ordinated
manner in order to satisfy the network users\' communication requirements. Any
evaluation of PLMN-system behaviour will require performance data collected
and recorded by its NEs according to a schedule established by the EM.
This aspect of the management environment is termed Performance Management.
The purpose of any Performance Management activity is to collect performance
related data, which can be used to locate potential problems in the network.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Information Service for the Performance
Management Integration Reference Point (PM IRP) as it applies to the Itf-N.
This IRP IS defines the semantics of operations (and their parameters) visible
across the Itf-N in a protocol and technology neutral way. It does not define
the syntax or encoding of the operations and their parameters.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

### 6.2.1 Attributes and relationships
This clause introduces the set of Information Object Classes (IOCs) that
encapsulate information within the IRPAgent. The intent is to identify the
information required for the PMIRP Agent implementation of its operations and
notification emission. This clause provides the overview of all support object
classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed specification of
various aspects of these support object classes.

## 6.3 Information Object Class (IOCs) definitions
### 6.3.1 MeasurementJob
#### 6.3.1.1 Definition
It represents a task that monitors and collects the performance measurement
data, i.e. values of multiple measurementTypes of multiple ManagedEntity
instances, at regular time intervals defined in JobMeasurementSchedule.
The target measurementTypes are those measurementTypes, whose names are in the
related MeasuredAttribute. measurementTypeName, of the related ManagedEntity
instances. The attributes of MeasurementJob, JobMeasurementSchedule and
MeasuredAttribute can not be modified (except jobStatus) once a measurement
job is created.
The MeasurementJob shall use its information and the information of the
related JobMeasurementSchedule and the information of MeasuredAttribute(s) to
perform measurement data collection during the MeasurementJob life-time. At
the time of data collection, if MeasurementJob suspects the validity of the
collected monitored values, the MeasurementJob should convey the fact to the
IRPManager using the suspectFlag (3GPP TS 32.401 [7]) of the Report. The
MeasurementJob will not emit any notification about this fact. Furthermore,
the MeasurementJob shall continue to monitor the same target measurementTypes.
Even in the worst possible case when the MeasurementJob cannot collect a
single value from the target measurementTypes, the MeasurementJob must
continue its activities according to the schedule created at MeasurementJob
creation time.
The PMIRP Agent may decide to stop a MeasurementJob because of a PMIRP Agent
internal problem or other problems such as in the case when the related
managed resource is not accessible (e.g. uninstalled) or there exist a
prolonged communication link problem between the PMIRP Agent and the related
managed resource. In such case, the PMIRP Agent can stop the MeasurementJob
resulting in the MeasurementJob.jobStatus == \"Stopped\". Additionally, \"
notifyMeasurementJobStatusChanged\" notification shall be emitted to notify
all subscribed IRPManagers about the stopping of a MeasurementJob.
The PMIRP Agent may also selectively suspend one or more MeasurementJobs
without any operator's action in case of overload. In such case, the PMIRP
Agent suspends all the chosen MeasurementJob(s) resulting in the
MeasurementJob.jobStatus == "Suspended" and emit
"notifyMeasurementJobStatusChanged" notification for each MeasurementJob to
notify all subscribed IRPManager(s) about the suspension. The behaviour on
threshold monitors of PMIRP Agent after suspending is the same as the one
after calling suspendMeasurementJob.
Then it should be possible, at any time, for the operator to resume a
MeasurementJob suspended by the system. PMIRP agent may also resume the
measurementJob by itself after detecting the end of the overload. When PMIRP
Agent does not support the resumeMeasurementJob operation, PMIRP Agent shall
resume the measurementJob automatically after detecting the end of overload.
The behaviour of PMIRP Agent after resuming the measurementJob is the same as
the one after calling resumeMeasurementJob. PMIRPAgent may suspend the
corresponding measurementJob(s) when it can decide which one/ones cause(s) the
overload; otherwise, PMIRP Agent can take jobPriority as a reference. The
criterion for suspending one or another measurementJob of equal job priority
is vendor specific.
The way to detect the beginning and the end of overload is out of the scope of
the present document.

### 6.3.7 ManagedEntity
#### 6.3.7.1 Definition
The IOC ManagedEntity represents an IOC defined in Network Resources Models,
e.g. Generic Network Resource Model, Core Network Resource Model, UTRAN
Network Resource Model or GERAN Network Resource Model. It also can represent
VSE subclass of 3GPP defined NRM IOCs or VSE defined NRM IOCs. Besides, it can
also represent a "private Object Class" as defined in TS 32.404, e.g. RA.
ManagedEntity is used in the specification of PMIRP operations to represent an
IOC defined in these Network Resource Models and private Object Classes.
### 6.3.8 Monitor
#### 6.3.8.1 Definition
It represents a capability to determine the (a) threshold-crossing or (b)
threshold-reaching and the threshold-clearing. This class is abstract in that
it cannot be instantiated. The ThresholdMonitor inherits this class.
It is the IRPAgent's choice to support (a) or (b) (but not both). The support
is on an IRPAgent system wide basis and is not on a per threshold basis. The
IRPAgent's behaviour regarding which approach (i.e., (a) or (b) above) to use,
shall be the same for emitting alarms and for clearing alarms.
The instances of a class derived from this abstract class shall emit
notifyThresholdMonitorObjectCreation when they are first created; and shall
emit a notifyThresholdMonitorObjectDeletion when deleted.
The instances of a class derived from this abstract class shall also emit
notifyNewAlarm, notifyChangedAlarm and notifyClearedAlarm according to the
rules specified in Annex B: Threshold Alarm Triggering Events.\ The
objectClass and objectInstance parameter of these notifications carry the
class and DN of the ManagedEntity whose measurementType is being monitored and
whose threshold condition has been triggered. The eventType of these
notifications carry \"Quality of Service Alarm\". See 3GPP TS 32.111-2 [4].

#### 6.3.10.1 Definition
In order to monitor the overall health of the network, the thresholds are set
by the authorized users to generate network performance related alarms. The
ThresholdMonitor contains the values of the threshold settings for the PM
parameters. If the threshold is (a) crossed or (b) reached (see 6.3.8.1 for
clarification of the alternatives (a) and (b)), a performance alarm will be
emitted (see 3GPP TS 32.401 [7]). The name of the monitored measurementType is
captured by MeasuredAttribute.measurementTypeName and the value of it is

## 7.2 Generic rules
\- **Rule 1:** each operation with at least one input parameter supports a
pre-condition valid_input_parameter which indicates that all input parameters
shall be valid with regards to their information type. Additionally, each such
operation supports an exception operation_failed_invalid_input_parameter which
is raised when pre-condition valid_input_parameter is false. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
\- **Rule 2:** each operation with at least one optional input parameter
supports a set of pre-conditions supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx where
\"xxx\" is the name of the optional input parameter and the pre-condition
indicates that the operation supports the named optional input parameter.
Additionally, each such operation supports an exception
operation_failed_unsupported_optional_input_parameter_xxx which is raised when
(a) the pre-condition supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx is false and (b)
the named optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
\- **Rule 3:** each operation shall support a generic exception
operation_failed_internal_problem which is raised when an internal problem
occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception has the same
entry and exit state.
NOTE: These rules are mapped at the solution set level. Pre-conditions and
exceptions, generated by these rules, need not appear explicitly in the
present document.
## 7.3 PMIRPOperations_1 Interface (M)
### 7.3.1 Operation createMeasurementJob (M)
#### 7.3.1.1 Definition
This operation supports IRPManager\'s request to create a MeasurementJob
through Itf-N.
Once created, the attributes of MeasurementJob (except
MeasurementJob.jobStatus) and the related JobMeasurementSchedule and
MeasuredAttribute will not be modified during the life-time of the
MeasurementJob.
One MeasurementJob can collect the value of one or multiple measurementTypes.
When a measurementType is collected by one MeasurementJob for a given
instance, another MeasurementJob which wants to collect the same
measurementType for the same instance with different or the same
jobGranularityPeriod may be rejected. This behaviour shall be consistent for a
given implementation by a specific vendor.

### 7.3.3 Operation suspendMeasurementJob (O)
#### 7.3.3.1 Definition
This operation supports IRPManager\'s request to suspend a MeasurementJob
through Itf-N. When the MeasurementJob is suspended, the collection of
measurement result data by the MeasurementJob will stop, regardless of its
schedule, but the MeasurementJob still exists. The suspend operation is
necessary in following situation:
\- High work load experienced by managed system.
\- The specified measurement data is not needed in a specific duration.
\- Other specific requirement.
After the job has been suspended, the notifyFileReady or
notifyFilePreparationError notification shall be emitted immediately or when

## 7.4 PMIRPOperations_2 Interface (O)
### 7.4.1 Operation createThresholdMonitor (M)
#### 7.4.1.1 Definition
This operation supports IRPManager\'s request to create a ThresholdMonitor
that defines the thresholds for some specific measurementTypes. If the
threshold defined is (a) crossed or (b) reached, the related performance
alarms will be emitted to subscribed IRPManager(s).
Two cases are allowed:
\- One case only accepts threshold monitoring of measurementType(s) that are
already under monitoring by an existing MeasurementJob. This kind of PMIRP
will not monitor a measurementType for (a) threshold-crossing or (b) threshold
reaching or for clearing if that measurementType is not already subject to a
MeasurementJob monitoring. This kind of PMIRP will only determine the (a)
threshold crossing or (b) threshold reaching and clearing events when the
related MeasurementJob(s) are in Active states. The IRPManager, when
interacting with this kind of PMIRP, must first start a MeasurementJob to
monitor the measurementTypes and then invoke this operation for the same
measurementTypes.
  * The other case is that it can accept threshold monitoring of measurementType(s) regardless if they are already under monitoring by existing MeasurementJob(s). ThresholdMonitor is independent of any existing MeasurementJob(s) and no new MeasurementJob(s) are created for threshold monitoring purposes.

###### ## Annex A (normative): Illustration of the state described in the
state Diagram
# A.1 Definition of state
## A.1.1 Scheduled
\"Scheduled\" means that the job has been created and the start time has not
been reached.
## A.1.2 Suspended
\"Suspended\" means that the job has been suspended for some reason.
## A.1.3 Active
\"Active\" means that the start time of a MeasurementJob has been reached.
There are two sub-states: \"Busy\" and \"Idle\".
\"Busy\" means that the MeasurementJob is monitoring the measurementTypes.
\"Idle\" means that the MeasurementJob is not monitoring the measurementTypes.
When a MeasurementJob becomes active, it does not mean that the job is
immediately busy. IRPManager can set the detailed time frame (e.g.
dailySchedule or weeklySchedule) for a MeasurementJob to be busy. If there is
no time frame schedule for a job, it immediately monitors the measurement
types when it becomes active.
## A.1.4 Stopped
\"Stopped\" means that the MeasurementJob is deleted via the Itf-N. Whether
the managed system removes the MeasurementJob immediately or later is vendor
specific.
# A.2 State transition scenarios
The following scenarios give examples of state transitions.
## A.2.1 Scenario 1
A MeasurementJob is created at 11:00, and the startTime is 14:00, stopTime is
18:00. At 12:00, the MeasurementJob is suspended, and at 13:00, the
MeasurementJob is resumed.
At 11:00: the MeasurementJob becomes scheduled after it was created.
At 12:00: the MeasurementJob is suspended and the jobStatus is \"Suspended\".
At 13:00: the MeasurementJob is resumed, and the jobStatus is \"Scheduled\"
because the start time has not been reached.
At 14:00: the MeasurementJob becomes active because start time has been
reached.
Figure A.2.1: Scenario 1
## A.2.2 Scenario 2
A MeasurementJob is created at 11:00, and the startTime is 12:00, stopTime is
18:00. At 13:00, the MeasurementJob is suspended, and at 14:00, the
MeasurementJob is resumed.
At 11:00: the MeasurementJob becomes scheduled after it was created.
At 12:00: the start time is reached, and the jobStatus is \"Active\".
At 13:00: the MeasurementJob is suspended, and the jobStatus is \"Suspended\".
At 14:00: the MeasurementJob is resumed, and the jobStatus is \"Active\".
Figure A.2.2: Scenario 2
## A.2.3 Scenario 3
A MeasurementJob is created at 11:00 and the startTime is 12:00, stopTime is
never stop. There is no other schedule defined. IRPManager stops the job at
14:00.
At 12:00: the MeasurementJob becomes active when start time is reached. Since
there is no schedule for the job, it starts monitoring measurement types
immediately.
At 14:00: the MeasurementJob is stopped when IRPManager stops the job.
Figure A.2.3: Scenario 3
## A.2.4 Scenario 4
A MeasurementJob is created at 11:00 and the startTime is 12:00, stopTime is
14:00. There is no other schedule defined.
At 12:00: the MeasurementJob becomes active when start time is reached. Since
there is no schedule for the job, it starts monitoring measurement types
immediately.
At 14:00: the MeasurementJob is stopped automatically when stop time is
reached.
Figure A.2.4: Scenario 4
## A.2.5 Scenario 5
A MeasurementJob is created at 11:00 and the startTime is 12:00, stopTime is
\"never stop\". There is a dailySchedule defined, which is 13:00\~14:00 and
15:00\~16:00 every day.
At 12:00: the MeasurementJob becomes active when start time has been reached.
Since there is a schedule for the job, the job monitors measurement types only
during the specified schedule. During other times, the job is idle.
> At 13:00 and 15:00: the MeasurementJob becomes busy when the daily schedule
> has been reached.
Figure A.2.5: Scenario 5
## A.2.6 Scenario 6
A MeasurementJob is created at 11:00 and the startTime is 12:00, stopTime is
13:30. The MeasurementJob.granularityPeriod is 30 minutes and the
MeasurementJob.reportingPeriod is 1 hour. There is no other schedule defined.
At 12:00: the MeasurementJob becomes active when start time is reached. Since
there is no detailed time frame for the job, the job begins to work at the
same time.
At 13:00: the file(s) of the MeasurementJob are available, and PMIRP emits the
notifyFileReady notification to subscripted IRPManager.
At 13:30: the MeasurementJob is automatically stopped when stop time is
reached.
At 14:00: PMIRP will emit the last notifyFileReady notification.

###### ## Annex B (normative): Threshold related performance alarms Triggering
Events
This annex defines the Triggering Events for the various performance alarms.
The Triggering Events normally are defined by each notification type, such as
notifyChangedAlarm, under the clause \"Triggering Events\". The Triggering
Events related to thresholding are defined here collectively for ease of
reference.
The Triggering Events are defined in a state transition table. The column
labels (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3 of table in clause B.1) denote the to-state while the
row labels denote the from-state. The cell denotes the emission action.
There are two clauses. Clause B.1 defines the Triggering Events for IRPAgent
that supports notifyChangedAlarm. Clause B.2 defines those for IRPAgent that
does not support notifyChangedAlarm.
Clause B.3 provides samples of triggering events.

The horizontal \'0\', \'1\', \'2\', \'3\' and \'4\' are the to-states
indicating the current measurementType value with respect to the different
threshold levels. Threshold levels are associated with severity level
(thresholdSeverity). Higher threshold level associates with higher severity
level (thresholdSeverity).
EXAMPLE: If direction = \'Increasing\', state-0 means the measurementType
value is below all thresholds. Stateâ€‘2 means that the measurementType value is
above threshold level 2 but below threshold level 3. If direction =
\'Decreasing\', state-0 means the measurementType value is above all
thresholds. Stateâ€‘2 means that the measurementType value is below threshold
level 2 but above threshold level 3.
The vertical \'0\', \'1\', \'2\'\', \'3\' and \'4\' are the from-states
indicating the last-read measurementType value with respect to the threshold
levels.
A threshold has a value and may have a hysteresis. A threshold with hysteresis
has a thresholdâ€‘high value and a thresholdâ€‘low value that are different from
the threshold value. A threshold without hysteresis can be considered as a
threshold whose threshold-high and threshold-low values are equal to the
threshold value.
For the direction = \'Increasing\', the shaded cells indicate transitions
caused by measurementType values (a) rising across or (b) reach one or more
thresholdâ€‘high values. The non-shaded cells indicate transition caused by
measurementType values falling across one or more thresholdâ€‘low values.
For the direction = \'Decreasing\', the shaded cells indicate transitions
caused by measurementType values (a) falling across or (b) reach one or more
thresholdâ€‘low values. The non-shaded cells indicate transition caused by
measurementType values rising across one or more thresholdâ€‘high values.
Each cell indicates the performance alarm emission when from-state transits to
to-state. The notifyNewAlarm and notifyChangedAlarm shall carry the severity
level (perceivedSeverity) associated with the to-state (thresholdSeverity).
The ThresholdMonitor determines, at monitorGP=X, if a threshold has been (a)
crossed or (b) reached by comparing the value read at monitorGP==X with the
value read at monitorGP==X-1. In initial condition (i.e. when the
ThresholdMonitor reads the value at monitorGP=1), the (hypothetical) value
read at monitorGP==X-1 is assumed to be at state-0.

The Monitor determines, at monitorGP=X, if a threshold has been crossed by
comparing the value read at monitorGP ==X with the value read at monitorGP
==X-1. In initial condition (i.e. when the Monitor reads the value at
monitorGP =1), the (hypothetical) value read at monitorGP ==X-1 is assumed to
be at state-0.
# B.3 Examples
## B.3.1 Example 1
Figure B.3.1 illustrates multi-level thresholdSeverity thresholding behaviour.
The horizontal axis indicates the time intervals specified by the
Monitor.monitorGranularityPeriod (monitorGP). The vertical axis indicates the
monitored measurementType values. The measurementType of this example is of
type gauge. The Monitor.direction is set to \"Increasing\".
Further suppose that the measurementType is monitored for a (a) two-level-
severity-threshold-crossings or (b) two-level-severity-threshold reaching.
(See 6.3.8.1 for clarification of the alternatives (a) and (b))
The threshold for the lower-level-severity is set to 3 with a hysteresis low
and high levels set to 2 and 4 respectively (i.e. hysteresis value = 1). The
thresholdSeverity level is Minor.
The threshold for the higher-level-severity is set to 7 with a hysteresis low
and high levels set to 6 and 8 respectively (i.e. hysteresis value = 1). The
thresholdSeverity level is Major.
The performance alarm triggering events are:
1\. At monitorGP interval 3, trigger a notifyNewAlarm with perceivedSeverity
(ps) = Minor.
2\. At monitorGP interval 5, if the IRPAgent supports notifyChangedAlarm,
trigger a notifyChangedAlarm with ps = Major; else a notifyClearAlarm and a
notifyNewAlarm with ps = Major.
3\. At monitorGP interval 8, if the IRPAgent supports notifyChangedAlarm,
trigger a notifyChangedAlarm with ps = Minor; else a notifyClearAlarm and a
notifyNewAlarm with ps = Minor.
4\. At monitorGP interval 15, trigger a notifyClearedAlarm clearing the last
emitted Minor alarm.
Figure B.3.1
## B.3.2 Example 2
Figure B.3.2 illustrates another multi-level thresholdSeverity thresholding
behaviour for IRPAgent supporting notifyChangedAlarm. The horizontal axis
indicates the time intervals specified by the GP. The vertical axis indicates
the monitored measurementType values. The measurementType of this example is
of type gauge. The Monitor.direction is set to \"Decreasing\".
Further suppose that the measurementType is monitored for a two-level
thresholdSeverity (a) threshold-crossing or (b) threshold reaching. (See
6.3.8.1 for clarification of the alternatives (a) and (b))
The threshold for the major-level thresholdSeverity is set to 7 with a
hysteresis high and low levels set to 6 and 8 respectively.
The threshold for the minor-level thresholdSeverity is set to 9 with a
hysteresis high and low levels set to 8 and 10 respectively.
The performance alarm triggering events are:
1\. At monitorGP interval 1, trigger a notifyNewAlarm with ps = Major. See
table B.1 table for transition Stateâ€‘0 to State-2.
2\. At monitorGP interval 5, trigger a notifyChangedAlarm with ps = Minor. See
table B.1 for transition Stateâ€‘2 to Stateâ€‘1.
3\. At monitorGP interval 8, trigger a notifyChangedAlarm with ps = Major. See
table B.1 for transition Stateâ€‘1 to Stateâ€‘2.
Figure B.3.2
## B.3.3 Example 3
Figure B.3.3 illustrates a single-level thresholding behaviour. The horizontal
axis indicates the time intervals specified by the monitorGP. The vertical
axis indicates the monitored measurementType values. The measurementType of
this example is of type gauge. The Monitor.direction is set to \"Increasing\".
The threshold is set to 4 with a hysteresis high and low levels set to 5 and 3
respectively. The thresholdSeverity level is Critical.
The performance alarm triggering events are:
1\. At monitorGP interval 3, trigger a notifyNewAlarm with ps = Critical.
2\. At monitorGP interval 11, trigger a notifyClearedAlarm with ps = Cleared.
