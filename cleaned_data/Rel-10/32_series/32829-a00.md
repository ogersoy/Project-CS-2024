# Introduction
Fault Management (FM) is a very basic functionality of network management. The
purpose of FM is to detect failures as soon as they occur and to minimize
their impact on the network services. Thus FM functionality consists of
functions for detecting, locating, isolating and correcting the failures.
These basic functions are same, or at least very similar regardless of the IT
environment.
FM functionalities had been specified and standardized by several
organizations. Even if the functions are same the specifications differ. The
differences lead to implementation of several variants of the same
functionality. This is an expensive aspect for both vendors and service
provides. This study aims to provide background information and
recommendations on how to get better alignment of FM specifications between
two telecom specification organizations, namely 3GPP and TMF.
# 1 Scope
The present document collects, compares and analyzes the specifications of
Fault Management (FM) as defined by 3GPP and TMF. These two organizations have
both a complete set of FM specifications consisting of requirement,
technology-independent and solution set specification for
\- Fault Management interface -- operations and notifications and
\- Alarm content
The present documentidentifies similarities and differences of the Fault
Management capabilities in 3GPP and TMF and provides recommendations to align
these capabilities.

# 4 Comparison of Fault Management standards
## 4.1 Reference Architectures
### 4.1.1 3GPP
### 4.1.2 TMF TIP
## 4.2 Fault Management standards in 3GPP and TMF TIP
### 4.2.1 3GPP Alarm IRP
3GPP is using the Integration Reference Point (IRP) concept for interface,
Network Resource Model (NRM) and data definition specifications see 3GPP TS
32.150 [1] for detailed description of IRP concept.\ The 3GPP Release 9
\"Telecommunication management; Fault Management;\" interface related
specifications are:
3GPP TS 32.111-1: \"Part 1: 3G fault management requirements\".
3GPP TS 32.111-2: \"Part 2: Alarm Integration Reference Point (IRP):
Information Service (IS)\".
3GPP TS 32.111-3: \"Part 3: Alarm Integration Reference Point (IRP): Common
Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) Solution Set (SS)\".
3GPP TS 32.111-5: \"Part 5: Alarm Integration Reference Point (IRP):
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) definitions\".
3GPP TS 32.111-7: \"Part 7: Alarm IRP SOAP Solution Set (SS)\".
The 3GPP Release 10 \"Telecommunication management; Fault Management;\"
interface related specifications are:
3GPP TS 32.111-1: \"Part 1: 3G fault management requirements\".
3GPP TS 32.111-2: \"Part 2: Alarm Integration Reference Point (IRP):
Information Service (IS)\".
3GPP TS 32.111-6: \"Part 6: Alarm Integration Reference Point (IRP): Solution
Set (SS) definitions\".
The above mentioned specifications define the requirements, semantics and
syntax of the Fault Management interface and Alarm content.\ The Alarm IRP is
utilizing the services defined in 3GPP TS 32.30x (Configuration Management;
Notification IRP) and inheriting object definitions from 3GPP TS 32.31x
(Generic IRP management) and 3GPP TS 32.62x (Generic network resources IRP).
### 4.2.2 TMF TIP Resource Trouble Management
Currently TIP ecosystem has two set of specifications:
\- OSS/J Fault Management API (JSR 263)
\- MTOSI Resource Trouble Management (TMF518_RTM) and the similar requirements
in TMF 513 (basically the MTNM requirements on FM
TMF TIP is harmonizing their fault management specifications. The goal is to
have one common TIP FM specification.
MTOSI RTM specification consist of a Document Delivery Package (DDP)
containing:
\- TMF518_RTM Resource Trouble, Business Agreement (BA)
\- RTM TMF612_RTM Resource Trouble, Information Agreement (IA)
\- RTM TMF864_RTM_XML Resource Trouble, Interface Implementation Specification
(IIS)
The above mentioned specifications define the requirements, semantics and
syntax of the Fault Management interface and Alarm content. Resource Trouble
Management interface is utilizing and inheriting the notification mechanism
and object definitions specified in Framework DDP, NetworkResourceBasic DDP
and NetworkResourceAssurance DDP. The document structure is similar to 3GPP.
For further information on MTOSI specification structure, see TMF RN306 [2].
OSS/J Fault Management API (JSR 263) consists of set of
specifications/documents: Overview Document, API User Guide Document, API
Source, XML Schema and Web Services WSDL. The Fault Monitoring API provides
interfaces, as specified by the OSS/J Design Guidelines, which allow clients
to collect and acknowledge alarms. The API enables reception of alarms, state
changes, and threshold crossing alerts from the network and maintaining a list
of active alarms.
## 4.3 Interface (operations) comparison
3GPP and TMF specifications define a set of operations by which one management
system may interact with another management system. The following table
contains a list of operations defined in 3GPP Alarm IRP and identifies the
same or similar operations defined in TMF MTOSI and OSS/J (Chapter 5.4 MTOSI
-- OSS/J Harmonization for Resource FM in [4]).
Table 4.3: Interface Operations Comparison
* * *
3GPP MTOSI OSS/J acknowledgeAlarms (M) acknowledgeAlarms acknowledgeAlarms (M)
unacknowledgeAlarms (O) unacknowledgeAlarms unAcknowledgeAlarms (M)
getAlarmList (M) getActiveAlarms getAlarmsByKeys and getAlarmsByTemplate
clearAlarms (O) no equivalent clearAlarms (M) setComments (O) no equivalent
commentAlarms getAlarmCount (O) getActiveAlarmsCount getAlarmCount no
equivalent? no equivalent unclearAlarms no equivalent no equivalent
createAlarm no equivalent no equivalent createAlarms
* * *
TMF MTOSI specifies also other alarm related operation which has no direct
equivalent operations in 3GPP.\ Some operations like setting alarm reporting
on and off may be implemented by other defined mechanisms.\ The TMF MTOSI
operation groups and operations are following (RTM ops tab in [3]):
> AlarmControl
>
> \- setAlarmReportingOff
>
> \- setAlarmReportingOn
>

## 4.4 Notification comparison
3GPP and TMF specifications define a set of notifications by which one
management system may inform/notify another management system. 3GPP and TMF
have chosen a different approach related the notification mechanism. 3GPP has
defined several notifications for changed alarm and/or alarm content where as
TMF has specified one notification and the content of that one notification is
changed accordingly.
3GPP Alarm IRP defines following notifications (see 3GPP TS 32.111-2 [5]):
> \- notifyNewAlarm (M)
>
> \- notifyAckStateChanged (M)
>
> \- notifyChangedAlarm (O)
>
> \- notifyComments (O)
>
> \- notifyClearAlarm (M)
>
> \- notifyAlarmListRebuilt (M)
>
> \- notifyPotentialFaultyAlarmList (O)
TMF MTOSI RTM DDP does not contain the alarm notification definition but
imports the definition from NRA DDP:
> \- AlarmNotification
AlarmNotifcation inherits attributes from CommonEventInformation and
EventInformation defined in MTOSI FMW.
Another difference between 3GPP and MTOSI is the treatment of threshold
crossing notifications. 3GPP notify threshold crossings utilizing the generic
alarm notification that contains the threshold info in attributes. MTOSI has a
separate notification for this purpose: TCANotification defined in NRA.
## 4.5 Alarm content comparison
### 4.5.1 3GPP
3GPP Alarm IRP defines alarm content, alarm attributes, as follows (see 3GPP
TS 32.111-2 [5]):
> \- alarmId
>
> \- notificationId
>
> \- alarmRaisedTime
>
> \- alarmChangedTime
>
> \- alarmClearedTime
>
> \- eventType
>
> \- probableCause
>
> \- perceivedSeverity
>
> \- specificProblem
>
> \- backedUpStatus
>
> \- trendIndication
>
> \- thresholdInfo
>
> \- stateChangeDefinition
>

> \- clearUserId
>
> \- clearSystemId
>
> \- serviceUser
>
> \- serviceProvider
>
> \- securityAlarmDetector
### 4.5.2 TMF MTOSI
MTOSI NRA defines the content of Alarm Notification as follows [6]:
> \- acknowledgeIndication
>
> \- additionalText
>
> \- affectedPtpRefList
>
> \- aliasNameList
>
> \- isClearable
>
> \- isEdgePointRelated
>
> \- layerRate
>
> \- nativeProbableCause
>
> \- perceivedSeverity
>
> \- probableCause
>
> \- probableCauseQualifier
>
> \- rootCauseAlarmIndication
>
> \- serviceAffecting
>
> \- x733_AdditionalInformation
>
> \- x733_BackUpObject
>
> \- x733_BackedUpStatus
>
> \- x733_CorrelatedNotificationList
>

>
> \- x733_MonitoredAttributeList
>
> \- x733_ProposedRepairActionList
>
> \- x733_SpecificProblems
>
> \- x733_TrendIndication
And following attributes are inherited from CommonEventInformation and
EventInformation objects defined in FMW:
> \- additionalInfo
>
> \- notificationId
>
> \- sourceTime
>
> \- objectName
>
> \- objectType

[Unmappable fields:]{.underline}
From the analysis above the following MTOSI data is not directly mappable to
3GPP:
\- isEdgePointRelated, aliasNameList, serviceAffecting, affectedPtpRefList,
rootCauseAlarmIndication, sourceTime, ru and contra.
In order to maintain backward compatibility it is proposed to send these
fields as (name, value) pairs in additionalInformation. This will allow the
client to identify if and when the information is provided, but without
impacting the existing model.
Proposal: Add additional constants.
This requires additional constants to be added to AdditionalInformation of the
form:
_const string AI_MTOSI_ISEDGEPOINTRELATED = \"ai_mtosi_isedgepointrelated\";_
#### 4.5.3.2 Alarm Life Cycle
Alarms in MTOSI are considered \"active\" in the raised state and inactive in
the \"cleared\" state, independently of the alarm acknowledgement state --
therefore it does not fit into either of the two models in 3GPP TS 32.111-2
[5]). .
_Proposal: Allow a lifecycle model in 3GPP which meets the MTOSI behaviour_
#### 4.5.3.3 Probable Cause, Native Probable Cause and Specific Problems
MTOSI and 3GPP have different definitions of the probable cause and specific
problems field -- in addition, MTOSI uses a native probable cause field as
follows:
* * *
                        Probable Cause                  Native Probable Cause              Specific Problems
Definition in 3GPP X.733 probable cause n/a X733 specific problem Definition
in MTOSI MTOSI probable cause grouping Name of the alarm on the EMS GUI X733
specific problem
* * *
_**Proposal** : Specific Problem can be used for the Name of the alarm. There
does not seem to be any need to create another native probable cause field for
3GPP._
_However, any probable cause values defined in MTOSI that are not in the
probable cause list in 32.111-3 should be added. The table below shows the
proposed mapping for each MTOSI ProbableCause value:_
+--------------------------------+------------------------------------+----------+ | MTOSI | 3GPP TS 32.111-3 [10] | New / | | | | | | ProbableCauseEnumType value | ProbableCause Value | Existing |

(Filters From Table 3-1 in the RTM)
_Proposal: No changes required._
#### 4.5.3.5 Alarm Uniqueness
In 3GPP alarm uniqueness is handled by the alarm id -- in MTOSI alarm
uniqueness is handled by the combination of { layerRate, probableCause.
probableCauseQualifier, objectName }. In the generation of 3GPP messages it
will be required to map the data in these fields into a single alarmId.
_Proposal: It is assumed a mechanism can be provided to do this mapping (EMS
specific)._
#### 4.5.3.6 Handling of ADMC alarms
For 3GPP it is not clear how ADMC alarms (transient conditions) should be
reported -- the following options are available:
* * *
Option# Forwarded when the alarm is raised Sent in resync data Clearable from
the n/b system 1 Yes No No 2 Yes Yes No 3 Yes Yes Yes
* * *
Proposal: Option 3 . Add something in the alarm notification to indicate
whether the alarm is ADAC or ADMC.
Alternatively add this in the additional info field.
## 4.6 3GPP FM and TIP RAM BA comparison
This clause provides a comparison between existing 3GPP Fault Management
related specifications and TMF TIP Resource Alarm Management Business
Agreement. TIP RAM BA is the requirement specification for TIP alarm
management (common FM interface for previous MTOSI/MTNM and OSS/J FM
interfaces) and is currently in member evaluation phase. The information
agreement (IS in 3GPP) is currently in draft status and assumed to be released
during 2011. Since this study is about potential harmonization of 3GPP and TMF
Fault Management functions the inclusion of this comparison is necessary. For
complete TIP RAM BA, see [7]. The BA contains additional information than
included in this clause.
The comparison is done between the existing and stable 3GPP Alarm IRP and TMF
FM requirements (BA [7], currently work in progress). The goal is to define
the recommendations for updates of the Alarm IRP, which would satisfy TMF TIP
FM requirements and that would allow the 3GPP Alarm IRP specifications to be
the solution for TMF TIP FM.

# 5 Discussion of FM IF Standards Alignment Options
**[Full alignment]{.underline}**. In case of full alignment, the compared
sources become one. This is the ultimate target for the
harmonization/alignment work in general i.e. one FM specification that fulfils
all the requirements of compared sources. The full alignment, considering
equally both requirements, would anyhow lead to a completely new interface. A
new interface means a discontinuity point that leads to new implementation and
new integration work thus increasing unnecessary the cost. This shall be
avoided.
**[Partial alignment]{.underline}**. Content and functionality wise a partial
alignment can be done in many different ways e.g. both specifications would be
updated with the missing main requirements of the other source or the updates
are done per need/evaluation. The target is to have one FM interface that
fulfils the requirements of converged network fault management thus one
specification needs to be extended with the requirement set by the other
specification. And to keep the changes in minimum the updates (adding new or
changing existing items) needs to be done selectively and considering the base
specification.
The FM alignment should minimize the cost factor both for the vendors and the
operators. And provide a stable and technology independent FM interface
solution for the converged networks. The target shall be one FM interface for
converged networks. TIP FM interface work is ongoing currently will lead to a
new interface. Whereas 3GPP Alarm IRP is stable, and has been stable for years
already. The best way to do the FM alignment is to enhance the existing Alarm
IRP to capture the main requirements of TMF TIP FM and define Alarm IRP to be
the only FM interface for converged networks.

# 6 Recommendations for FM IF Standards Alignment
This clause identifies the recommended changes based on comparison in clause 4
and harmonization options in clause 5. The main input to the recommended
changes is the 3GPP FM and TIP RAM BA comparison in clause 4.6.
The recommendation is to change 3GPP Alarm IRP only. 3GPP Alarm IRP is a
mature and stable interface and can be extended to support converged network
fault management requirements with minor modifications.
This study identified two areas of enhancements for 3GPP alarm management
interface capabilities:
  * Improvement on alarm correlation and root cause analyzis
  * NM-layer alarm management interface capabilities
Improvement on alarm correlation and root cause analyzis:
  * Operator Top-10-Requirements [8] identified a deficiency in current Alarm management capabilities: alarm correlation and root cause analysis capabilities are missing. 3GPP has studied this topic and documented its analyzis and recommendation in TR 32.832 [11].
NM-layer alarm management interface capabilities:
  * 3GPP Alarm IRP is usable also on NM-layer interactions (as sufficiently generic and providing required functionality for transfer and management of alarm information)
  * 3GPP recommends that if additional functionality is needed on NM-layer interactions (supported by agreed use cases and architectural definitions), such interaction should be defined in a separate interface specification.
3GPP Alarm IRP (3GPP TS 32.111-x), with the recommendations listed above, will
satisfy all the converged network FM requirements. The target is to provide
only one FM solution without any competing solutions to eliminate silo
management solutions. The planned TMF TIP FM interface would mean a partially
duplicated FM interface as well as continuation of silo management. The
recommendation to TMF TIP is to accept 3GPP Alarm IRP as their FM interface
and not to develop a competing interface.
