# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication management; as identified below:

# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
Self Organizing Networks (SON) Policy Network Resource Model (NRM) IRP,
through which an IRPAgent can communicate management information to one or
several IRPManagers concerning SON policies. The SON policy NRM IRP comprises
a set of specifications defining Requirements, a protocol neutral Information
Service and one or more Solution Set(s).
The present document specifies the protocol neutral SON policy NRM IRP:
Information Service (IS).
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an Interface IRP such
as the \"Basic CM IRP\" is needed (3GPP TS 32.602 [11]). However, which
Interface IRP is applicable is outside the scope of the present document.
The present document also contains stage 2 descriptions for those
functionalities for the Self-**Optimization OAM**.

### 4.3.3 Optimization Method
#### 4.3.3.1 Problem Detection
HO Parameter Optimization Function shall focus on detecting the problem
scenarios described in TS 32.521 [5]; namely: too early handovers, too late
handovers and inefficient use of NW resources due to HOs. For more information
about these scenarios see TS 32.521 [5] section 6.1.3.
The following inputs may be used for the identification of the problem
scenarios:
\- Event capture and analysis
\- UE measurements
\- Performance measurements
In event capture and analysis, the eNodeB exploits event information
associated with a UE context, such as evidence of previous handovers (UE
History, see TS 36.423 [7]) and HO failure details (such as in which cell the
handover failed and where the UE re-established the connection).
UE measurements are sent within UE measurement reports and they may indicate
whether HOs are too early or too late.
HO-related performance measurements (PMs) collected at the source and / or
target eNB can be useful in detecting HO-related issues on the cell level.
Since the impact of incorrect HO parameter setting will also be on the cell-
level, PMs can provide useful information that can be used to detect and
resolve HO-related issues due to incorrect parameter settings.
#### 4.3.3.2 Problem Solution
HO Parameter Optimization Function will aim at optimizing the HO parameters
listed in Section 4.3.2 in such way to mitigate the problem scenarios
discussed in Section 4.3.3.1. The optimization algorithms will not be
specified. The exact set of HO parameters that may be adjusted by the
algorithms is dictated by the choice of triggered HO measurements made by the
RRM entity in an eNodeB.
### 4.3.4 Architecture
#### 4.3.4.1 Definition of Logical Functions
**HO Parameter Optimization Monitor Function:** This function is used for
monitoring the handover parameter optimization (e.g. monitoring related
performance counters or alarms).
**HO Parameter Optimization Policy Control Function:** This function is used
for configuring the handover parameter optimization policies.
#### 4.3.4.2 Location of Logical Functions
For HandOver (HO) parameter optimization there are several options for the
location of the SON algorithm:
  1. The SON algorithm is located in the eNB(s).
  2. The SON algorithm is located in the EM, the parameter changes are executed in the eNBs.
An example for the first option is shown in figure 4.3.4.2:
Figure 4.3.4.2: Example when the SON algorithm is located in the eNB(s)
The detailed SON functionalities in eNB are out of scope of this
specification.
### 4.3.5 PM
IRPManager shall collect HO-related performance measurements from the source
and / or target eNB which can be useful in detecting HO-related issues on the
cell level. The following input can be used for the identification of the
problem scenarios specified:
The number of RLF event happened within an interval after handover success.
Performance Measurements related to handover failure are captured in the table
below.
The Performance Measurements are for outgoing handovers. Further, they should
be available on a cell relation basis.
* * *
Performance measurement name Description Related targets Number of handover
events Includes successful handovers plus all identified failures Rate of
failures related to handover Number of HO failures All failure cases Rate of
failures related to handover Number of too early HO failures Too early HO
failure cases Rate of failures related to handover Number of too late HO
failures Too late HO failure cases Rate of failures related to handover Number
of HO failures to wrong cell HO failures to wrong cell Rate of failures
related to handover

NOTE: The monitoring of performance measurements will make use of existing PM
IRP.
## 4.4 Interference Control Function
## 4.5 Capacity and Coverage Optimization Function
### 4.5.1 Objective and Targets
The objective of capacity and coverage optimization is to provide optimal
coverage and capacity for the radio network. A tradeoff between capacity and
coverage needs to be considered.
The detailed target(s) FFS.
### 4.5.2 Parameters to be optimized
To reach capacity and coverage optimization targets, the following parameters
may be optimized:
  * Downlink transmit power
  * Antenna tilt
  * Antenna azimuth
### 4.5.3 Optimization Method
#### 4.5.3.1 Problem Detection
The main symptoms of capacity and coverage optimization problems (see TS
37.320 [15]) are:
**Coverage hole:** A coverage hole is an area where the pilot signal strength
is below a threshold which is required by a UE to access the network, or the
SINRs of both serving and neighbor cells is below a level needed to maintain
the basic service. Coverage holes are usually caused by physical obstructions
such as new buildings, hills, or by unsuitable antenna parameters, or just
inadequate RF planning. UE in coverage hole will suffer from call drop and
radio link failure. Typical phenomenon of coverage hole is either HO failure
happens frequently and cannot be optimized by HO parameter optimization or
call drop happens frequently and cannot be rescued by RRC re-establishment.
**Weak coverage:** Weak coverage occurs when the pilot signal strength or the
SNR (or SINR) of serving cell is below the level needed to maintain a planned
performance requirement (e.g. cell edge bit-rate).
**Pilot pollution:** In areas where coverage of different cells overlap a lot,
interference levels are high, power levels are high, energy consumption is
high and cell performance may be low. Typically in this situation UEs may
experience high SNR to more than one cell and high interference levels.
**Overshoot coverage:** Overshoot occurs when coverage of a cell reaches far
beyond what is planned. It can occur as an "island" of coverage in the
interior of another cell, which may not be a direct neighbor. Reasons for
overshoot may be reflections in buildings or across open water, lakes etc. UEs
in this area may suffer call drops or high interference.
**DL and UL channel coverage mismatch:** DL channel coverage is larger than UL
channel coverage is one typical scenario of DL and UL channel coverage
mismatch. The UE will suffer UL problems when it moves into the mismatch area.
In a realistic network, these symptoms may be tolerated to a certain level.
These symptoms may indicate a real problem when combined with other factors
such as frequency of symptoms, duration of symptoms, or affected population.
The following inputs may be used for the identification of the problem
scenarios:
  * UE measurements
  * Performance measurements
  * Alarms, other monitoring information e.g. trace data
UE measurements are sent within UE measurement reports and they may indicate
the capacity and coverage problem.
Capacity and coverage related performance measurements collected at the source
and / or target eNB can be useful in detecting capacity and coverage related
issues on the cell level. Minimizing Driver Test (MDT) or HO-related
performance measurements may be used also in detecting capacity and coverage
related issues on the cell level.
Alarms, other monitoring information e.g. trace data can be correlated to get
an unambiguous indication of capacity and coverage problem.
#### 4.5.3.2 Problem Solution
Capacity and coverage optimization function will aim at optimizing the
parameters listed in Section 4.5.2 in such way to mitigate the problem
scenarios discussed in Section 4.5.3.1.
### 4.5.4 Architecture
#### 4.5.4.1 Definition of Logical Functions
**CCO Monitor Function:** This function is used for monitoring the capacity
and coverage optimization (e.g. monitoring related performance counters, UE
measurements or alarms).
**CCO Policy Control Function:** This function is used for configuring the
capacity and coverage optimization policies.
#### 4.5.4.2 Location of Logical Functions
For capacity and coverage optimization (CCO), there are several options for
the location of the centralized CCO SON algorithm:
  1. The CCO SON algorithm is located in the DM. The capacity and coverage optimization decision is made by the DM centralized CCO algorithm.
  2. The CCO SON algorithm is located in the NM. The capacity and coverage optimization decision is made by the NM centralized CCO algorithm.
An example for the first option is shown in figure 4.5.4.2:
Figure 4.5.4.2: Example when the CCO SON algorithm is located in DM
The detailed CCO SON algorithm in OAM (NM centralized or EM centralized) is
out of scope of this specification.
4.5.5 PM
The IRPAgent shall support a capability allowing the IRPManager to collect CCO
related performance measurements to know the situation of coverage or
interference which may then trigger corresponding optimization procedures.
Performance measurements related with CCO are captured in the table below:

## 4.6 RACH Optimization Function
### 4.6.1 Objective and Targets

related to the performance of RACH. One of the following targets shall be
used. The specific target value shall be configured by operators.
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Target Name | Definition | Legal Values | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Access Probability, | The probability that | CDF of access | | _AP_ | the UE has access | attempts. See | | | after a certain | section 5.5.1 | | | random access | | | | attempt number. | | | | | | | | The target is met if | | | | the actual access | | | | probability is | | | | higher than the | | | | target probability | | | | value. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Access Delay | The probability | CDF of delays.

### 4.6.2 Parameters to be optimized
To achieve RACH optimization target, RACH optimization function may optimize
several parameters defined in TS 36.300 [14] section 22.4.3.
### 4.6.3 Optimization Method
#### 4.6.3.1 Problem Detection
The problem detection is out of scope of this specification since the RACH
optimization entity resides in the eNB.
#### 4.6.3.2 Problem Solution
The problem solution is out of scope of this specification since the RACH
optimization entity resides in the eNB.
### 4.6.4 PM
The IRPAgent shall support a capability allowing the IRPManager to collect
RACH optimization related performance measurements. Performance measurements
related with RACH optimization are captured in the table below:
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Performance | Description | Related targets | | measurement name | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Distribution of RACH | Refer to _3GPP TS | Access Probability, | | preambles sent | 32.425 [8]_ | AP | | | | | | | Cumulative | | | | Distribution of RACH | | | | preambles sent by UE | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Distribution of RACH | Refer to 3GPP TS | Access Delay | | access delay | 32.425 [8] | Probability, ADP | | | | | | | Cumulative | | | | Distribution of RACH | | | | Access Delay | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
## 4.7 Optimization coordination
### 4.7.1 Introduction
For coordination of SON Functions whose outputs are not standardized, the
context of optimization coordination is:
  1. IRPManager uses standardized capabilities to set the SON Function(s) targets, and where needed their weights.
> Operators should assign weights for targets being used. The weights are used
> also for the evaluation of the targets. For details see Annex A.
For coordination of SON Functions whose outputs are standardized, the context
of optimization coordination is FFS.
### 4.7.2 Coordination between **SON functions below Itf-N and CM operations
over itf-N**
FFS
### 4.7.3 Coordination between different SON functions
Note: The coordination between different SON functions should be decided case
by case.
#### 4.7.3.1 Coordination between Cell Outage Compensation and Energy Saving
Management
##### 4.7.3.1.1 Description
A conflict could arise between energy saving and cell outage compensation in
the following scenario.
One or more candidate cells are configured to possibly take coverage of the
original cell. The original cell is in energySaving state or is about to enter
energySaving state. One or more candidate cells go into outage with the
consequence that coverage of the original cell can not be provided any more.
##### 4.7.3.1.2 Prevention
Prevention is hardly possible, except making the cells as outage proof as
possible. But cell outages can happen even to the most stable cell in a
network.
##### 4.7.3.1.3 Resolution
If the original cell is in energySaving state, it shall leave energySaving
state.
If the original cell is about to enter energySaving state, it shall not go
into energySaving state until candidate cell outage is recovered and candidate
cell is able to provide the coverage.
The original cell may go into the energySaving state after the candidate cell
outage is recovered and coverage of the original cell can be taken over by
candidate cell again.

## 5.3 Information Object Class (IOC) definitions
### 5.3.1 SONTargets
#### 5.3.1.1 Definition
This IOC represents targets for SON functions and their relative weights.
Target hierarchy rule:
> An NRM IOC instance X may name-contain an IOC SONTargets instance T. The
> rule states that:
\- If X name-contains a SONTargets instance T, then T is applicable to X.
\- If X and all its superior instances do not name-contain any SONTargets
instance, then no SONTargets instance is applicable to X.
\- If X does not name-contain any SONTargets instance, but one or more of X's
superior instances name-contain a SONTargets instance, then the SONTargets
instance of the superior instance closest to X, in X's naming tree, is
applicable to X.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Target Achievement Evaluation
> To evaluate the result of the optimization the target achievement needs to
> be evaluated. This can be done by calculating the Total Target Achievement
> as follows.
>
> The Total Target Achievement is the sum of the products of the individual
> target achievement (difference between target and performance) and the
> individual targetWeights:
>
> Total Target Achievement =\ Sum ~i=1..n~ [ ( minTarget ~i~ -- performance
> ~i~ ) x weight~i~ ]\ \+ Sum ~j=1..n~ [ performance ~j~ -- maxTarget ~j~ ) x
> weight ~j~ ]
>
> where minTarget is a target to be minimized and maxTarget is a target to be
> maximized.
>
> For targets with a substructure (like *Characteristic, see Â§5.5.1) the above
> formula is applied to each individual substructure target.
>
> The higher the Total Target Achievement, the better is the result of the
> optimization.
