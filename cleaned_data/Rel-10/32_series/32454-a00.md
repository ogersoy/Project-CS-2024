###### ## Annex A (informative): Use case for KPIs
## A.1 Use case for initial registration success rate of S-CSCF related KPI
It is useful to evaluate accessibility performance provided by IMS and network
performance. This KPI is helpful to learn the user registration status. This
KPI is focusing on network and user view.
## A.2 Use case for session setup time (mean) related KPI
It is necessary to evaluate accessibility performance provided by IMS and
network performance. This KPI can influence the users' satisfaction directly
and reflect network transaction performance. This KPI is focusing on network
and user view.
## A.3 Use case for session establishment success rate related KPI
It is necessary to evaluate the session establishment performance provided by
IMS including user behaviour factors. This KPI is focusing on network and user
view. It is necessary to define session establishment success rate (SESR) with
differentiating originating and terminating, otherwise when the operator wants
to consider SESR from whole IMS network perspective, the value of SESR will be
much bigger than real situation due to one success session being counted twice
(both at originating side and terminating side).
## A.4 Use case for third party registration success rate related KPI
It is useful to evaluate accessibility performance provided by IMS and network
performance. Third Party Registration is the process of S-CSCF to inform the
Application Server (AS) about the user's registration status and it is a
necessary procedure to perform services involving AS. This KPI (Third Party
Registration Success Rate) is defined to fulfil the need of the operator to
evaluate the service and network accessibility performance. This KPI is
focusing on network and user view.
## A.5 Use case for re-registration success rate of S-CSCF related KPI
Periodic application level re-registration is initiated by the UE either to
refresh an existing registration or in response to a change in the
registration status of the UE. A re-registration procedure can also be
initiated when the capabilities of the UE have changed or the IP CAN has
changed [3GPP TS 23.228]. This KPI is useful for evaluate accessibility of the
IMS network, including the user behaviour factors. This KPI is helpful to
learn the user's re-registration status. This KPI is focusing on network and
user view.
## A.6 Use case for call drop rate of IMS sessions related KPI
It is necessary to evaluate retainability performance of IMS including user
causes, as well as IMS reliability and stability should be reflected. This KPI
is focusing on network view.
## A.7 Use case for session set-up time originated from CS and IMS related KPI
When IMS operator provides transit functionality to other network operators,
in this case the operator is serving as an IMS session based routing backbone
for a PSTN operator or another IP network and provides connectivity to both
PSTN and IP endpoints. So it is necessary to define session set-up time
originated from CS and IMS KPI to indicate accessibility performance of IMS
network for other networks, also it is useful for other network operators to
do trouble shooting.
This KPI is focusing on network and user view.
## A.8 Use case for mean session utilization related KPI
The mean number of simultaneous online and answered sessions together with
maximum number of sessions provided by IMS network can reflect system resource
utilization. If the value of this KPI is very high, it indicates system
capacity is not enough, and needs to be increased.
This KPI is focusing on network view.
## A.9 Use case for immediate messaging success rate related KPI
With Immediate messaging the sender expects immediate message delivery in what
is perceived as real time. Immediate messaging allows the exchange of any type
of multimedia content, now the immediate messaging services are widely used
both in the wired and wireless environment. If the immediate messaging success
rate is very low, it will impact on the satisfactory of user and service
providers. So it is necessary to evaluate immediate messaging success rate
performance provided by IMS.
This KPI is focusing on network and user view.
