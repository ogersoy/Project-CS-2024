The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor 3G-system.
During the lifetime of a 3G network, its logical and physical configuration
will undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise
the utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed
through network configuration management activities and/or network
engineering, see TS 32.600 [3].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of a 3G network require data on which to base decisions. This data
refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In
order to produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs,
which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external
system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further
evaluation. The purpose of the present document is to describe the mechanisms
involved in the collection of the data and the definition of the data itself.
Annex B of TS 32.404 helps in the definition of new performance measurements
that can be submitted to 3GPP for potential adoption and inclusion in the
present document. Annex B of TS 32.404 discusses a top-down performance
measurement definition methodology that focuses on how the end-user of
performance measurements can use the measurements.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements for Core Network (CN) Packet
Switched (PS) domain of UMTS or combined UMTS/GSM network.
TS 32.401 [1] describes Performance Management concepts and requirements.
The present document is valid for all measurement types provided by an
implementation of a CN PS domain of UMTS network or combined UMTS/GSM network.
Only measurement types that are specific to CN PS domain of UMTS or combined
UMTS/GSM network are defined within the present documents.
Vendor specific measurement types used in CN PS domain of UMTS or combined
UMTS/GSM network are not covered. Instead, these could be applied according to
manufacturer\'s documentation.
Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as ATM or IP) as
described by \"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or IETF) shall only be
referenced within this specification, wherever there is a need identified for
the existence of such a reference.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
The structure of the present document is as follows:
\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. RNC related measurements);
\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. soft handover measurements);
\- Header 3: Measurements.

### 5.1.2 Network-initiated session establishments
The performance counters presented in this subclause focus on network
initiated PDP context activation procedure, that allows the GGSN to initiate
the activation of a PDP context on receipt of a PDP PDU on the Gi interface.
The counters proposed are mainly intended to
  * monitor the signalling exchanged between the HLR and the GGSN during > this procedure; and
  * monitor the success rate for network-initiated session > establishments. It has to be noted that measurements proposed > enable to distinguish between the establishment failures occurring > before and after the SGSN has sent the context activation request > to the MS.
These counters are associated to the Mobile Application Part (MAP) protocol
layer (defined in TS 29.002 [4]) and to GPRS Tunnelling Protocol signalling
(GTP-C for the control plane), between the SGSN and the GGSN (defined in TS
29.060 [6]).

establish a subscriber profile. Such a profile details the number of
elementary procedures per active subscriber (PDP context activations,
modifications, updates, ...), usually during a busy hour. This profile may be
used for 2 main purposes:

## 5.2 Per APN measurements
These measurements will only be provided for a subset of all the APNs of the
GGSN (see TS 23.003 [9] for APN definition). The way the list of monitored
APNs is configured is outside the scope of the present document.
### 5.2.1 Session establishments
The performance counters presented in this subclause are intended to bring a
more detailed view on session activations compared to counters defined in
subclause 1.1. Especially, they enable to monitor the session establishment
success rate when user authentication is required and when a dynamic PDP
address is to be allocated by the GGSN.
Furthermore, the definition of \"per APN\" measurements allows to let
performance monitoring focus on a \"specific service\" handled by a GGSN: TS
23.003 [9] indicates that an APN Network Identifier may be used to access a
service associated with a GGSN and that this may be achieved by defining:
  * an APN that corresponds to a DNS name of a GGSN and is locally > interpreted by the GGSN as a request for a specific service; or
  * an APN Network Identifier consisting of 3 or more labels and > starting with a Reserved Service Label, or an APN Network > Identifier consisting of a Reserved Service Label alone, that > indicates a GGSN by the nature of the requested service.
The figure below, from TS 29.061 [10] details the message sequence during a
PDP context activation for the non-transparent IP case, where a dynamic PDP
address is to be allocated and user authentication is required.

## 5.4 GTP\' measurements
The performance counters presented in this subclause are intended to monitor
the transfer of G-CDRs to the CGF; in particular
  * The number of CDR transfer attempts, together with the cause > triggering the transfer enables to dimension both the CGF / > Billing System and the Ga interface. The breakdown of causes for > transfer attempts may also help in tuning the parameters > associated to partial CDR creation.
  * The breakdown of causes for transfer failure is provided to track > and investigate any problem that could be detected thanks to the > CDR transfer success rate.
These counters are associated to the GTP\' protocol between the GGSN and the
CGF, as defined in TS 29.060 [6] and TS 32.015.
The figure below from TS 32.015 shows a normal CDR transfer between a GSN and

These counters are associated to IP protocol on the Gi interface.
These counters are proposed to be screened with regards to the protocol
configuration options, as defined in TS 24.008 [15] and TS 29.061 [10], i.e. a

  * user data encryption (IPSec, ...);
  * tunnelling of packets onto the Gi interface.
Any valid combination of these options fully defines a \"Gi reference point\".

## 5.6 AAA Authentication measurements
The performance counters presented in this subclause are mainly intended to:
  * monitor the AAA server performance;
  * monitor the network connectivity.
These counters are associated to the AAA server, which is playing a more and
more important role in a 3G environment, and is defined in RFC 2903 [17].
The figure below presents the message sequence during an AAA authentication
procedure initiated by the GGSN.
{width="2.8743055555555554in" height="2.107638888888889in"}
Figure: AAA authentication procedure initiated by GGSN
NOTE: In Radius, the AAA Authentication Request message is Access-Request and
AAA Authentication Response is Access-Accept/ Access-Reject/ Access-Challenge
(RFC 2138 [18]), where the AAA successful authentication response message is
Access-Accept.
### 5.6.1 Attempted Authentication Procedures, per APN
a) This measurement provides the number of attempted authentication procedures
per APN.
b) CC.
c) Transmission by the GGSN of an AAA authentication request message to the
AAA server.
d) A single integer value.
e) AAA.AttAuthQuery.Apn.
f) GgsnFunction, per APN.
g) Valid for packet switched traffic.
h) Combined
### 5.6.2 Successful Authentication Procedures, per APN
a. This measurement provides the number of successful authentication
procedures per APN.
b. CC.
c. Receipt by the GGSN of an AAA successful authentication response message
from the AAA server.
d. A single integer value.
e. AAA.SuccAuthResp.Apn.
f. GgsnFunction, per APN.
g. Valid for packet switched traffic.
h. Combined.
