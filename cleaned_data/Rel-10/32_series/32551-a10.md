# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Centralized ES:** ES solution where ES algorithms are executed in the OAM
system. Centralized ES has two variants:
  * **NM-Centralized ES:** ES solution where ES algorithms are executed at the Network Management level.
  * **EM-Centralized ES:** ES solution where ES algorithms are executed at the Element Management level.
**Distributed ES:** ES solution where ES algorithms are executed at the
Network Element level.
**notEnergySaving state: the default state in peak-traffic situation, with no
specific energy saving in progress.**
**energySaving state: in an off-peak-traffic situation, some functions of a
cell or a network element are powered-off or restricted in resource usage in
other ways, whereas the cell or network element is still controllable.**
**_compensatingForEnergySaving state:_** in an off-peak traffic situation, a
network element is remaining powered on, e.g. taking over the coverage areas
of neighbor base station in _energySaving state_.
**ES activation:** the procedure to switch off a cell or network element or
restrict the usage of physical resources for energy saving purposes. As a
result, a specific network element transitions is in energySaving state.
**ES compensation: the** procedure to change a cell's or network element's
configuration to remain powered on for compensating energy saving activation
on other cells or network elements, e.g. by increasing a base station's
coverage area. As a result, the network element is in
_compensatingForEnergySaving_ state.
**ES deactivation:** the procedure to switch on a cell ornetwork element or
resume the usage of physical resources which had been ES activated before. As
a result, a specific network element is in notEnergySaving state.
**Enable ES:** ES (including ES activation/compensation/deactivation, related
computations etc.) is allowed to be performed.
**Disable ES:** ES is prohibited to be performed. When ES is disabled, subject
cells or NEs are in notEnergySaving state.
**Candidate cell:** candidate cell is a cell which can provide coverage when
the original cell goes into energySaving state.

# 4 Concepts and Backgrounds
## 4.1 Energy Savings Management (ESM) concept
Protecting the environment and combating climate change are challenges that we
face today. In the telecom environment, as energy prices increase, there is
added incentive for Network Operators to look for means to reduce energy
costs.
OAM of mobile networks can contribute to energy saving by allowing the
operator to set policies to minimize consumption of energy, while maintaining
coverage, capacity and quality of service. The permitted impact on coverage,
capacity and quality of service is determined by operator's policy.
In addition, the use of the renewable energy sources (e.g. wind, solar energy)
should be encouraged in mobile networks.
The following ESM concepts can apply to different RATs, e.g. UMTS and LTE.
Nevertheless some of these ESM concepts may be limited to specific RATs and
network elements, and specific solutions may be required for them.
### 4.1.1 Fundamental concepts
Two energy saving states can be conceptually identified for a cell or a
network element:
Conceptually, a cell or a network element may be on one of these two states
with respect to energy saving:
\- notEnergySaving state
\- energySaving state
_Based on the above energy saving states, a full energy saving solution
includes two elementary procedures:_
\- Energy saving activation
\- Energy saving deactivation
### 4.1.2 Additional concepts for selected uses cases
For selected ESM use cases, a network element may additionally transition to
the
\- compensatingForEnergySaving.
_Correspondingly, such use cases may provide these additional procedures:_
\- Energy saving compensation activation.
\- Energy saving compensation deactivation: the procedure to decrease a
previously increased coverage area.
### 4.1.3 Operator control
Three general architectures are candidates to offer energy savings
functionalities:
Distributed, NM-Centralized, EM-Centralized as defined in TS 32.500 [6].
Energy savings in cells can be initiated in several different ways. Some of
the mechanisms are:
\- IRPManager instructs the cells to move to energySaving state.
\- IRPManager sets policies and conditions and when these policies/conditions
are met, the cells will move to energy saving state.
\- The eNB moves itself to energySaving state autonomously based on its
knowledge of the network without any input for energy savings from the
IRPManager and/or based on operators instruction/policies/conditions set in
non-standard manner.
When a cell is in energy savings state it may be need that neighboring cells
to pick up the load. However a cell in energySaving state cannot cause
coverage holes or create undue load on the surrounding cells. All traffic on
that cell is expected to be drained to other overlaid/umbrella cells before
any cells moves to energySaving state.
A cell in energySaving state is not considered a cell outage or a fault
condition. No alarms should be raised to the IRPManager for any condition that
is a consequence of a NE moving into energySavings state.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Use case details: Capacity-limited network
use case
**Capacity-limited networks (e.g. UMTS networks in an urban environment) are
normally dimensioned to cope with peak time traffic demand and can hence be
under-utilized in off-peak times, e.g. at certain hours of the night, when the
overall load as well as the load distribution onto the different cells may
differ significantly from peak times.**
**For energy saving management in such networks, the objective is therefore to
adapt the network to these changing conditions by activating energy saving on
selected cells. One approach is to concentrate the load into a few selected**
cells **that remain active during low traffic demand periods with increased
coverage area and to deactivate the remaining less loaded** cells**.**
_This use case is generally RAT-independent, but may provide specific
requirements and leverage specific mechanisms of individual RATs. This use
case is only applicable to macro base stations._
##### **Overview** {#overview .H6}
_In this use case the coverage area of a cell can be configured dynamically,
where an operator would employ smaller coverage areas per cell (to increase
capacity per geographic area) in a peak traffic situation. In that case some
base stations would be enabled to adjust their transmission power and other
configuration parameters for their cells at off-peak times in order to provide
coverage for other neighboring cells -- which could then be transferred to
energy saving state, after handing currently associated UEs over to remaining
neighboring cells. Activating energy saving on certain base stations and
modifying radio parameters for increasing coverage for other cells can lead to
different neighbor relations as well as different cell and frequency layouts,
which should be addressed by automatic neighbor relation, interference
control, e.g. through OAM-driven configuration or SON functions, depending on
the specific RAT in use. Depending on the specific scenarios, activating
energy saving on base stations could ultimately lead to switching off all
radio-transmission-related functions at a site, which would lead to reduced
energy consumption and could implicitly lead to even further energy saving,
e.g. when air condition systems at a site adapt to the reduced cooling
requirements -- which is not considered here in detail._
_The energy saving management in the scenario would ideally lead to situation
for an off-peak time as depicted in figure A.1 -- where one base station would
remain powered one (depicted as ES-Compensate), taking over the coverage areas
of neighbor base stations in energySaving state (depicted as eSaving)._
Figure A.1: Different network arrangements corresponding to capacity demand
variation for energy saving purposes
As depicted in figure A.1, a certain part of a network, e.g. base stations in
a geographical area, can be in two different situations:
1\. Peak traffic situation: no particular energy saving is on-going, and
network elements are in No-ES state.
2\. Off-peak Traffic situation: energy saving is on-going, and some network
elements may be in energySaving state, while others are in
compensatingForEnergySaving state.
_Peak-traffic situation_ and _off-peak-traffic situation_ refer to the
disposition of a network. For this use case, the following three different
states are applicable to individual network elements: 1) notEnergySaving, 2)
energySaving, and 3) compensatingForEnergySaving state.
These states are entered and left using the procedures energy saving
activation, energy saving deactivation, energy saving compensation activation,
and energy saving compensation deactivation.
It should be noted that the concrete actions for transferring a network
element into an energySaving state (depicted as "eSaving" in figure A.1)
depend on the specific scenario and capabilities of the network element.
This use case can be implemented in the ES-below-Itf-N architecture and in the
ES-above-Itf-N architecture. Depending on the architecture, energy saving
decisions and corresponding state transfers are made by network elements (or
element / domain managers) or by network management systems.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Use Case details: eNB overlaid use case
In order to assure the service connectivity and make no side effect on the
service (there is a possible case that a UE may power on in the area of an eNB
in ES), only the eNB overlaid by other eNBs (i.e. the area served by the eNB
also covered by other eNBs) can enter into ES.
In this scenario, legacy systems, e.g. 2G/3G provide radio coverage together
with E-UTRAN. Another case similar with this is that an area covered by
different frequencies in E-UTRAN, i.e. inter-frequency case.

Figure B.1: ENB Overlaid Scenario
According to the definition of base station classes in [3] section 4.2, base
stations can be categorized by Macro Cell (Wide Area Base Station), Micro Cell
(Medium Range Base Station), Pico Cell (Local Area Base Station) and Femto
Cell (characterized by Home Base Station). This category of base station can
be applied to enhance the scenarios of inter-frequency eNB overlaid.
**UC1: Inter-Frequency E-UTRAN eNB/Cell Coverage**
In this scenario, two E-UTRAN cells (Cell A, Cell B) with separate frequency
bands cover the same geographical area. Cell B has a smaller size (Pico Cell
or Micro Cell) than Cell A (Macro Cell) and is covered totally by Cell A.
Generally, Cell A is deployed to provide continuous coverage of the area,
while Cell B increases the capacity of the special sub-areas, such as hot
spots. The energy saving procedure in the coverage of Cell B (ES area) may be
triggered in case that light traffic in Cell B is detected. Cell B
deactivation of energy saving may also be triggered when the traffic of ES
area (measured by Cell A) resumes to a high level.
Figure B.2: Inter-Frequency E-UTRAN Cell Coverage
The inter-frequency E-UTRAN cell coverage use case also has a variation of
hybrid deployment of Macro Cell and Femto Cell, which means different cell
classes (Macro and Femto) cover the same geography area.
**UC1a: Hybrid E-UTRAN Macro Cell and Femto Cell Coverage**
In this scenario, two E-UTRAN cells (Cell A, Cell B) with different cell types
cover the same geographical area. Cell B (Femto Cell) is covered totally by
Cell A (Macro Cell). Generally, Cell A is deployed by eNB to provide
continuous coverage of the area, while Cell B is deployed by Home eNB to
increase the capacity of the special sub-areas, such as home or business mall
or office. The energy saving procedure in the coverage of Cell B (ES area) may
be triggered in case that light traffic or no traffic in Cell B is detected.
Cell B deactivation of energy saving may also be triggered when the traffic of
ES area resumes to a high level. Home eNB which deploys the femto cell can be
totally switched off during the ES procedure.
Figure B.3: Hybrid E-UTRAN Macro Cell and Femto Cell Coverage
**UC2: Inter-RAT Cell Coverage**
In this scenario, E-UTRAN Cell B is totally covered by inter-RAT Cell A (such
as legacy system UMTS or GSM). Cell A is deployed to provide basic coverage of
the voice or medium/low-speed data services in the area, while Cell B enhances
the capability of the area to support high-speed data or multi-media services.
The energy saving procedure in the coverage of Cell B (ES area) may be
triggered in case that no high-speed data or multi-media traffic in Cell B is
detected. Cell B deactivation of energy saving may be triggered when the high-
speed data or multi-media service request in ES area is restarted again.
