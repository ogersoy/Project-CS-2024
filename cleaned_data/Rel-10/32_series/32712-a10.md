Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
\"Transport Network (TN) Interface Network Resource Model (NRM) IRP \",
through which an \"IRPAgent\" (typically an Element Manager or Network
Element) can communicate Configuration Management information to one or
several \"IRPManagers\" (typically Network Managers) concerning Transport
resources. The \"Transport Network (TN) Interface Network Resource Model (NRM)
IRP\" comprises a set of specifications defining Requirements, a protocol
neutral Network Resource Model (NRM) and corresponding Solution Set(s).
> The present document:
  1. specifies the protocol neutral Transport Network Interface Resources IRP: Network Resource Model. It reuses relevant parts of the generic NRM in TS 32.622 [6], either by direct reuse or sub-classing, and in addition to that defines Transport specific Managed Object Classes.
The Configuration Management (CM) area is very large. The intention is to
split the specification of the related interfaces in several IRPs - as
described in the Introduction clause above. An important aspect of such a
split is that the Network Resource Models (NRMs) defined in different IRPs
containing NRMs are consistent, and that NRMs supported by an IRPAgent
implementation can be accessed as one coherent model through one IRP
Information Service.
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an IRP Information
Service (IS) is needed, such as the Basic CM IRP: IS (TS 32.602 [7]) or the
Bulk CM IRP: IS (TS 32.612 [8]). However, which Information Service that is
applicable is outside the scope of this document.
Finally, regarding the support of the State Management IRP: IS (TS 32.672
[3]), all NRM\'s of one release shall support the same State Management IRP
version.
This specification is related to 3GPP TS 32.672.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TS 32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2], 3GPP TS 32.150 [3] and the following
apply:
**Association:** in general it is used to model relationships between Managed
Objects. Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:
> 1\. name bindings;
>
> 2\. reference attributes; and
>
> 3\. association objects.
This IRP stipulates that containment associations shall be expressed through
name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other types of
associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate entities in
the object models (UML diagrams)
**Managed Element (ME):** an instance of the Managed Object Class
ManagedElement defined in 3GPP TS 32.622 [6].
**Managed Object (MO):** in the context of the present document, a Managed
Object (MO) is a software object that encapsulates the manageable
characteristics and behaviour of a particular Network Resource. The MO is
instance of a MO class defined in a MIM/NRM. This class, called **Information
Object Class (IOC)** has **attributes** that provide information used to
characterize the objects that belong to the class (the term \"attribute\" is
taken from TMN and corresponds to a \"property\" according to CIM).
Furthermore, the IOC can have **operations** that represent the behaviour
relevant for that class (the term \"operation\" is taken from TMN and
corresponds to a \"method\" according to CIM). The IOC may support the
emission of **notifications** that provide information about an event
occurrence within a network resource
**Management Information Model (MIM):** also referred to as NRM - see the
definition below
**Network Resource Model (NRM):** A model representing the actual managed
telecommunications network resources that a System is providing through the
subject IRP. An NRM identifies and describes the IOCs, their associations,
attributes and operations. The NRM is also referred to as \"MIM\" (see above),
which originates from the ITU-T TMN
**Node B:** A logical node responsible for radio transmission/reception in one
or more cells to/from the User Equipment. It terminates the Iub interface
towards the RNC

# 4 Information Object Classes
## 4.1 Imported information entities and local labels
IOCs ManagedElement, IubLink, and vsDataComtainer are imported.

### 4.2.1 Attributes and relationships
This sub clause depicts the set of IOCs that encapsulate information relevant
for this service. This sub clause provides the overview of all information
object classes in UML. Subsequent subclasses provide more detailed
specification of various aspects of these information object classes.
Figure 4.2.1.1 shows the name-containment relation and other types of
relations of the Transport Network NRM.
Figure 4.2.1.1: Transport Network NRM Containment/Naming and Association
diagram
Each IOC is identified with a Distinguished Name (DN) according to 3GPP TS
32.300 [4] that expresses its containment hierarchy. As an example, the DN of
a IOC representing a ATMPathTerminationPoint could have a format like:
SubNetwork=Sweden,meContext=MEC-Gbg-1,ManagedElement=RNC-Gbg-1,
TransportNetworkInterface=ATM-1, ATMPathTerminationPoint=Gbg-1.
NOTE 1: The listed cardinality numbers represent transient as well as steady-
state numbers, and reflect all managed object creation and deletion scenarios.

Association diagram
### 4.2.2 Inheritance
This sub-clause depicts the inheritance relationships that exist between IOCs.
