# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.641: \"Configuration Management (CM); UTRAN network resources Integration
Reference Point (IRP): Requirements\".
**32.642: \"Configuration Management (CM); UTRAN network resources Integration
Reference Point (IRP): Network Resource Model (NRM)\".**

Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources, and they
may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations Systems
(OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
CM, in general, provides the operator with the ability to assure correct and

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply. For terms and definitions not found here, please refer to 3GPP TS
32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2] and 3GPP TS 32.600 [14].
**Antenna** : Within the present document an Antenna is the set of radiating
elements involved in the transmission and reception of Radio Frequency energy
to support the Uu interface of a UTRAN cell. See Annex B for more detail.
**Association** : In general it is used to model relationships between Managed
Objects. Associations can be implemented in several ways, such as:
1) name bindings,
2) reference attributes, and
3) association objects.
This IRP stipulates that containment associations shall be expressed through
name bindings, but it does not stipulate the implementation for other types of
associations as a general rule. These are specified as separate entities in
the object models (UML diagrams).
**Managed Element (ME)** : An instance of the Information Object Class
ManagedElement defined in TS 32.622 [16].
**Managed Object (MO)** : In the context of the present document, a Managed
Object (MO) is a software object that encapsulates the manageable
characteristics and behaviour of a particular Network Resource. The MO is
instance of a MO class defined in a MIM/NRM. This class, called **Information
Object Class (IOC)** has [attributes]{.underline} that provide information
used to characterize the objects that belong to the class (the term
\"attribute\" is taken from TMN and corresponds to a \"property\" according to
CIM). Furthermore, the IOC can have [operations]{.underline} that represent
the behaviour relevant for that class (the term \"operation\" is taken from
TMN and corresponds to a \"method\" according to CIM). The IOC may support the
emission of [notifications]{.underline} that provide information about an
event occurrence within a network resource.
**Management Information Model (MIM)** : Also referred to as NRM -- see the
definition below.
**Network Resource Model (NRM)** : A model representing the actual managed
telecommunications network resources that a System is providing through the
subject IRP. An NRM identifies and describes the IOCs, their associations,
attributes and operations. The NRM is also referred to as \"MIM\" (see above),
which originates from the ITU-T TMN.
**Node B:** A logical node responsible for radio transmission/reception in one
or more cells to/from the User Equipment.\ It terminates the Iub interface
towards the RNC.
**TMA Subunit** : See TS 25.466 [21].
**Tower Mounted Amplifier:** See TS 25.466 [21].

# 4 System overview
## 4.1 Void
## 4.2 Compliance rules
The following defines the meaning of Mandatory and Optional IOC attributes and
associations between IOCs, in Solution Sets to the IRP defined by the present
document:
\- The IRPManager shall support all mandatory attributes/associations. The
IRPManager shall be prepared to receive information related to mandatory as
well as optional attributes/associations without failure; however the
IRPManager does not have to support handling of the optional
attributes/associations.
\- The IRPAgent shall support all mandatory attributes/associations. It may
support optional attributes/associations.
An IRPAgent that incorporates vendor-specific extensions shall support normal
communication with a 3GPP SA5â€‘compliant IRPManager with respect to all
Mandatory and Optional information object classes, attributes and associations
without requiring the IRPManager to have any knowledge of the extensions.
Given that
\- rules for vendor-specific extensions remain to be fully specified, and
\- many scenarios under which IRPManager and IRPAgent interwork may exist,
it is recognised that the IRPManager, even though it is not required to have
knowledge of vendor-specific extensions, may be required to be implemented
with an awareness that extensions can exist and behave accordingly.
# 5 Modelling approach
The modelling approach adopted and used in this IRP is described in TS 32.622
[16].

## 6.2 Class diagram
### 6.2.1 Attributes and relationships
This clause depicts the set of IOCs that encapsulate information relevant for
this service. This clause provides the overview of all information object
classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed specification of
various aspects of these information object classes.
The following figures show the containment/naming hierarchy and the
associations of the information object classes defined in the present
document. They are split in several figures only for a readability purpose.
NOTE 1: The listed cardinality numbers, in particular the use of cardinality
number zero, do not represent transient states. The transient state is
considered an inherent property of all IOC instances and therefore there is no
need to represent them by individual IOC cardinality numbers.
NOTE 2: The IOC AntennaFunction is required when supporting RET, For a
description and clarification of RET, please refer to Annex B.
NOTE 3: The instances of the AntennaFunction associated with a particular
instance of NodeBFunction shall be contained by the same ManagedElement
instance.
NOTE 4: The instances of the TmaFunction associated with a particular instance
of NodeBFunction shall be contained by the same ManagedElement instance.
NOTE 5: Please see TS 32.792 [24] for the definitions of the associations
EUtranCell-AntennaRelation, EUtranCell-SectorRelation, EUtranCell-TmaRelation,
SectorEquipment-AntennaRelation and SectorEquipment-TmaRelation.

NOTE 1: The listed cardinality numbers, in particular the use of cardinality
number zero, do not represent transient states. The transient state is
considered an inherent property of all IOC instances and therefore there is no
need to represent them by individual IOC cardinality numbers.
NOTE 2: The relation between GsmRelation and GsmCell is optional. It may be
present if both the UtranGenericCell and the GsmCell are managed by the same
management node.
NOTE 3: The UtranRelation and GsmRelation can be name-contained under IOCs
defined in other NRMs.
NOTE 4: ExternalUtranGenericCell is contained under SubNetwork or
ExternalRncFunction.

NOTE 1: The listed cardinality numbers, in particular the use of cardinality
number zero, do not represent transient states. The transient state is
considered an inherent property of all IOC instances and therefore there is no
need to represent them by individual IOC cardinality numbers.
NOTE 2: Each instance of the VsDataContainer shall only be contained under one
IOC.\ The VsDataContainer can be contained under IOCs defined in other NRMs.
Figure 6.2.1.3: VsDataContainer Containment/Naming and Association in UTRAN
NRM diagram
NOTE 1: The ATMChannelTerminationPoint is name-contained under IOCs defined in
the Transport Network NRM.
NOTE 2: The group of ATMChannelTerminationPoints associated with an IubLink\
(the relation AssociatedWith1) represent the RNC end of the ATM Virtual
Channel Connections (transport connection) between an RNC and a NodeB.
NOTE 3: An ATMChannelTerminationPoint can be associated with more than one
IubLink for the case of AAL2 multiplexing/switching.\ I.e. to allow an ATM
Channel at the RNC to be connected to multiple NodeBs.
Figure 6.2.1.4: UTRAN Transport Network NRM Containment/Naming and Association
diagram
The VsDataContainer is only used for the Bulk CM IRP.
Each IOC is identified with a Distinguished Name (DN) according to 3GPP TS
32.300 [13] that expresses its containment hierarchy. As an example, the DN of
an IOC instance representing a cell could have a format like:
SubNetwork=Sweden, MeContext=MEC-Gbg-1,ManagedElement=RNC-Gbg-1,
RncFunction=RF-1,UtranCell=Gbg-1.

### 6.3.5 UtranRelation
#### 6.3.5.1 Definition
The UtranRelation IOC contains radio network related parameters for the NR
from a source cell to a UtranGenericCell or ExternalUtranGenericCell instance.
The source cell can be a UtranGenericCell instance. This is the case for an
Intra-UTRAN NR.
The source cell can be an EUtranGenericCell instance. This is the case for an
Inter-RAT NR from E-UTRAN to UTRAN. See 3GPP TS 32.762 [26].
The source cell can be a GsmCell instance. This is the case for an Inter-RAT
NR from GERAN to UTRAN. See 3GPP TS 32.652 [6].
NRs are unidirectional.
The UtranGenericCell and the ExternalUtranGenericCell may be an FDD mode cell,
a lcr (low chip rate) 1.28 Mcps TDD mode cell or a hcr (high chip rate) 3.84
(7.68) Mcps TDD mode cell.
NOTE: In handover relation terms, the cell containing the UTRAN Relation
object is the source cell for the handover. The cell referred to in the UTRAN
relation object is the target cell for the handover.\ This defines a one-way
handover relation where the direction is _from_ source cell _to_ target cell.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Void
###### ## Annex B (informative): RET Control Architecture
The Itf-N provides an abstraction of resources to allow the monitor and
control of physical resource from the network level management systems. For
RET, the antenna tilt is controlled via a control unit which is located within
the NodeB (from a management perspective). The control unit sends commands to
actuators located at the tower top, in order to read, and to adjust antenna
tilt values.
The AntennaFunction class will report failures and malfunctions of either the
control unit, or the tilt.
There are several configurations of antennae. Some support the transmission of
several frequencies from a single radome while others are deployed as an array
in order to provide effective coverage.
Hence in the UTRAN model there is an N:M relationship between the UtranCell
class and the AntennaFunction class, permitting the model to support all
possibilities. The figure B.1 below illustrates the RET architecture.
