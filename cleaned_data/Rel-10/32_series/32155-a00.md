# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

# 1 Scope
The present document contains the template to be used for the production of
all Requirements TSs for the 3GPP Telecommunication management.
This template is mainly based on the requirements template (mainly Annex A) in
the ITU-T M.3020 recommendation [6].
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
  * References are either specific (identified by date of publication, > edition number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
  * For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
  * For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the > case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), > a non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version > of that document _in the same Release as the present document_.

# 4 Requirements template
This template is mainly based on the requirements template (mainly Annex A) in
the ITU-T M.3020 recommendation [6], and shall be used for the production of
all Requirements TSs for the 3GPP Telecommunication management. The template
contains two options: Option 1 specified in subclause 4.1, which shall be used
for all high-level Requirements TSs for the 3GPP Telecommunication management,
and option 2 specified in subclause 4.2, which shall be used for all
Integration Reference Point (IRP) specific Requirements TSs such as 3GPP TS
32.761 [7].
The clauses in this template that shall be used in the Requirements TS are
numbered starting with \"X\", which shall correspond to clause 4 that is the
beginning of the main part of the TS, followed by "Y" which shall correspond
to clause 5 in the TS, and "Z" (for the full template) which shall correspond
to clause 6 in the TS.
Instructions in _italics_ below shall not be included in the Requirements TS.
The introductory clauses (from clause 1 to clause 3) for the Requirements TS
should be taken from the 3GPP TS template (i.e. not this requirements
template) -- see
[http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Information/TS_TR_Templates/]{.underline}.
Usage of fonts shall be according to the 3GPP TS template.
## 4.1 Template for high-level Requirements TSs
# X Concepts and background
_\"X\" represents clause number 4 in the actual Requirements TS._
_For production of the contents of this clause, follow the instructions in
M.3020 [6] subclause "A.2.1"._
# Y Business level requirements
_\"Y\" represents clause number 5 in the actual Requirements TS. For
production of the contents of this subclause, follow the instructions in
M.3020 [6] subclause "A.2.2"._
# Z Specification level requirements
_\"Z\" represents clause number 6 in the actual Requirements TS._
_For production of the contents of this subclause, follow the instructions in
M.3020 [6] subclause "A.2.3"._
## 4.2 Template for Integration Reference Point (IRP) specific Requirements
TSs
# X Concepts and background
_\"X\" represents clause number 4 in the actual Requirements TS._
_For production of the contents of this clause, follow the instructions in
M.3020 Amendment 1 [8] subclause "A.3.1"._
# Y Requirements
_\"Y\" represents clause number 5 in the actual Requirements TS. For
production of the contents of this subclause, follow the instructions in
M.3020 Amendment 1 [8] subclause "A.3.2"._
