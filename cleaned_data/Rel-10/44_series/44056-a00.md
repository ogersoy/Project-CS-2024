# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the procedures used at the CTS radio interface
(Reference Point Um*, see GSM 03.56) for Call Control (CC), Mobility
Management (MM), Radio Resource (RR).
When the notations for \"further study\" or \"FS\" or \"FFS\" are present in
the present document they mean that the indicated text is not a normative
portion of the present document.
These procedures are defined in terms of messages exchanged over the control
channels of the radio interface. The CTS control channels are described in GSM
03.52.
The structured functions and procedures of this protocol and the relationship
with other layers and entities are described in general terms in GSM 04.07.
## 1.1 Scope of the Technical Specification
The procedures currently described in the present document are for the call
control of circuit-switched connections, mobility management and radio
resource management for circuit-switched services over the CTS radio
interface.
GSM 04.10 contains functional procedures for support of supplementary
services.
GSM 04.11 contains functional procedures for support of point-to-point short
message services.
NOTE: \"layer 3\" includes the functions and protocols described in the
present document. The terms \"data link layer\" and \"layer 2\" are used
interchangeably to refer to the layer immediately below layer 3.
## 1.2 Application to the interface structures
The layer 3 procedures apply to the interface structures defined in GSM 04.03.
They use the functions and services provided by layer 2 defined in GSM 04.05
and GSM 04.06. GSM 04.07 gives the general description of layer 3 including
procedures, messages format and error handling.
## 1.3 Structure of layer 3 procedures
A building block method is used to describe the layer 3 procedures.
The basic building blocks are \"elementary procedures\" provided by the
protocol control entities of the three sublayers, i.e. radio resource
management, mobility management and connection management sublayer.
Complete layer 3 transactions consist of specific sequences of elementary
procedures. The term \"structured procedure\" is used for these sequences.
## 1.4 Test procedures
Test procedures of the GSM-CTS radio interface signalling are described in GSM
11.10 and GSM 11.56 series.
## 1.5 Use of logical channels
The logical control channels are defined in GSM 03.52. In the following those
control channels are considered which carry signalling information or specific
types of user packet information: [to be completed]:
i) CTS Beacon CHannel (CTSBCH): downlink only, used to broadcast Cell specific
information and fixed part identification information;
ii) CTS Paging CHannel (CTSPCH): downlink only, used to send page requests to
Mobile Stations (MSs);
iii) CTS Access Random CHannel (CTSARCH): uplink only, used to request a
Dedicated Control CHannel;
iv) CTS-Access Grant CHannel (CTSAGCH): downlink only, used to allocate a
Dedicated Control CHannel;
v) Fast Associated Control CHannel (FACCH): bi-directional, associated with a
Traffic CHannel;
vi) Slow Associated Control CHannel (SACCH): bi-directional, associated with a
Traffic CHannel;
Two service access points are defined on signalling layer 2 which are
discriminated by their Service Access Point Identifiers (SAPI) (see GSM
04.06):
i) SAPI 0: supports the transfer of signalling information including user-user
information;
ii) SAPI 3: supports the transfer of user short messages.
Layer 3 selects the service access point, the logical control channel and the
mode of operation of layer 2 (acknowledged, unacknowledged or random access,
see GSM 04.05 and GSM 04.06) as required for each individual message.

# 3 Definitions, abbreviations and Random values
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
GSM 04.08 and the following apply:
**CTS-idle mode:** in this mode, the mobile station is not allocated any
dedicated channel; it listens to the BCH and to the CCH when requested
NOTE: In CTS‑RR connected mode, main DCCH means FACCH.4 CTS-Radio Resource
management procedures
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in GSM 01.04
apply.
## 3.3 Random values
In a number of places in the present document, it is mentioned that some value
must take a \"random\" value, in a given range, or more generally with some
statistical distribution.
It is required that there is a low probability that two equipment\'s in the
same conditions (including the case of two equipment\'s of the same type from
the same manufacturer) will choose the same value. Moreover, it is required
that, if it happens that two equipment\'s in similar conditions choose the
same value, the probability of their choices being identical at the next
occasion is the same as if their first choices had been different.
The meaning of such a specification is that any statistical test for these
values, done on a series of similar events, will obtain a result statistically
compatible with the specified distribution. This shall hold even in the cases
where the tests are conducted with a subset of possible events, with some
common parameters. Moreover, basic tests of independence of the values within
the series shall pass.
Data against which correlation with the values shall not be found are the
protocol state, or the IMSI, or identities or other unrelated information
broadcast by the network, or the current TDMA frame number.
# 4 Overview/General
## 4.1 Overview
### 4.1.1 General
CTS-Radio Resource management procedures include the functions related to the
management of the common transmission resources, e.g. the physical channels
and the data link connections on control channels.
The general purpose of CTS-Radio Resource procedures is to establish, maintain
and release RR connections that allow a point-to-point dialogue between the
CTS‑FP and a mobile station. Moreover, Radio Resource management procedures at
the CTS‑MS side include the reception of the uni-directional CTSBCH and CTSPCH
when no RR connection is established. This permits automatic cell
selection/reselection.
### 4.1.2 Services provided to upper layers
A CTS‑RR connection is a physical connection used by the two peer entities to
support the upper layers\' exchange of information flows.
#### 4.1.2.1 CTS-Idle mode
In CTS-idle mode no CTS-RR connection exists.
The RR procedures include (on the mobile station side) those for automatic
cell selection/reselection. The RR entity indicates to upper layers the
unavailability of a CTSBCH/CTSPCH and the cell change when decided by the RR
entity. Upper layers are advised of the CTSBCH broadcast information when a
new cell has been selected, or when a relevant part of this information
changes.
In Idle mode, upper layers can require the establishment of an CTS-RR
connection.
In Idle-mode, RR procedures provide the following service:
\- alive check (CTS‑FP side);
\- hunting;
\- connectionless group alerting;
\- CTS system information broadcasting.
Connectionless group alerting is a point-to-multipoint unidirectional
transmission on the CTSPCH. It can only be initiated by the CTS‑FP.
#### 4.1.2.2 Dedicated mode
In dedicated mode, the CTS‑RR connection is a physical point-to-point bi-
directional connection, and includes a SAPI 0 data link connection operating
in multiframe mode on the main DCCH. If dedicated mode is established, RR
procedures provide the following services:
\- establishment/release of multiframe mode on data link layer connections
other than SAPI 0, on the main DCCH or on the SACCH associated with the
channel carrying the main signalling link;
\- transfer of messages on any data link layer connection;
\- indication of temporary unavailability of transmission (suspension,
resuming);
\- indication of loss of CTS-RR connection;
\- setting/change of the transmission mode on the physical channels, including
change of type of channel, change of the coding/decoding/transcoding mode and
setting of ciphering;
\- release of an CTS-RR connection.
### 4.1.3 Services required from data link and physical layers
The CTS-RR sublayer uses the services provided by the data link layer as
defined in GSM 04.05.
Moreover, the RR sublayer directly uses services provided by the physical
layer such as CTSBCH searching, as defined in GSM 04.04.
### 4.1.4 Change of dedicated channels
NOTE: for this version of the protocol, no intra-cell handover is to be
defined.
#### 4.1.4.1 Change of dedicated channels using SAPI = 0
In case a change of dedicated channels is required using a dedicated
assignment procedure, the RR sublayer will request the data link layer to
suspend multiple frame operation before the mobile station leaves the old
channel. When the channel change has been completed, layer 3 will request the
data link layer to resume multiple frame operation again. The layer 2
suspend/resume procedures are described in GSM 04.05 and 04.06.
These procedures are specified in such a way that a loss of a layer 3 message
cannot occur on the radio interface. However, messages sent from the mobile
station to the CTS‑FP may be duplicated by the data link layer if a message
has been transmitted but not yet completely acknowledged before the mobile
station leaves the old channel (see GSM 04.06).
As the RR sublayer is controlling the channel change, a duplication of RR
messages does not occur. However, there are some procedures for which a
duplication is possible, e.g. DTMF procedures. For all upper layer procedures
using the transport service of the RR sub-layer (e.g. MM and CM procedures),
the request messages sent by the mobile station contain a sequence number in
order to allow the CTS‑FP to detect duplicated messages, which are then
ignored by the CTS‑FP. The procedures for sequenced transmission on layer 3
are described in subclause 4.1.4.2.
#### 4.1.4.2 Change of dedicated channels using other SAPIs than 0
For SAPIs other than 0, the data link procedures described in GSM 04.06 do not
provide any guarantee against message loss or duplication.
Therefore, if an application uses a SAPI other than 0 and if this application
is sensitive to message loss or duplication, then it has to define its own
protection mechanism. No general protection mechanism is provided by the
protocol defined in the present document.
#### 4.1.4.3 Sequenced message transfer operation
Upper layer messages sent using the RR sub-layer transport service from the
mobile station to the CTS-FP can be duplicated by the data link layer in the
following case:
\- a channel change of dedicated channels is required (assignment procedure)
and the last layer 2 frame has not been acknowledged by the peer data link
layer before the mobile station leaves the old channel.
In this case, the mobile station does not know whether the CTS-FP has received
the message correctly. Therefore, the mobile station has to send the message
again after the new dedicated channel is established (see GSM 04.06).
The CTS-FP must be able to detect the duplicated received message. Therefore,
each concerned upper layer message must be marked with a send sequence number.
For historical reasons (see GSM 04.08), messages sent with the CC, SS and MM
PDs share the same sequence numbering.
##### 4.1.4.3.1 Variables and sequence numbers
###### 4.1.4.3.1.1 Send state variable V(SD)
The RR sublayer of the mobile station shall have one associated send state
variable V(SD) (\"Send Duplicated\") for each upper layer message flow. The
send state variable denotes the sequence number of the next in sequence
numbered message in the flow to be transmitted. The value of the corresponding
send state variable shall be incremented by one with each numbered message
transmission. Arithmetic operations on V(SD) are performed modulo 2.
###### 4.1.4.3.1.2 Send sequence number N(SD)
At the time when such a message to be numbered is designated for transmission,
the value of N(SD) for the message to be transferred is set equal to the value
of the send state variable V(SD). See GSM 04.07.
##### 4.1.4.3.2 Procedures for the initiation, transfer execution and
termination of the sequenced message transfer operation
###### 4.1.4.3.2.1 Initiation
The sequenced message transfer operation is initiated by establishing a RR
connection. The send state variables V(SD) are set to 0.
###### 4.1.4.3.2.2 Transfer Execution
The CTS-FP must compare the send sequence numbers of pairs of subsequent
messages in the same upper layer messages flow. In case the send sequence
numbers of two subsequent messages in a flow are not identical, no duplication
has occurred. In case the send sequence numbers are identical, the CTS-FP must
ignore the second one of the received messages.
###### 4.1.4.3.2.3 Termination
The sequenced message transfer operation is terminated by the RR connection
release procedure.
### 4.1.5 Procedure for Service Request and Contention Resolution
Upon seizure of the assigned dedicated channel, the mobile station establishes
the main signalling link on this channel by sending a layer 2 SABM frame
containing a layer 3 service request message. The data link layer will store
this message to perform the contention resolution. The service request message
will be returned by the CTS‑FP in the UA frame.
The data link layer in the mobile station compares the content of the
information field (i.e. the layer 3 service request message) received in the
UA frame with the stored message and leaves the channel in case they do not
match. This procedure resolves contentions in the case where several mobile
stations have accessed at the same random access slot and with the same random
reference and one has succeeded due to capture. The full description of the
procedure is given in GSM 04.06.
The purpose of the service request message is to indicate to the CTS‑FP which
service the mobile station is requesting. This then allows the CTS‑FP to
decide how to proceed (e.g. to authenticate or not).
The service request message must contain the identity of the mobile station
and may include further information which can be sent without encryption.

## 4.2 Idle mode procedures
### 4.2.1 Mobile Station side
#### 4.2.1.1 CTSBCH and CTSPCH monitoring
In CTS-idle mode, a MS which has recognised a known FPBI, listens to the
CTSBCH and to the CTSPCH when CTSPCH indicator flags indicates \"_CTSPCH to
decode_ \".
#### 4.2.1.2 Alive check response
When the CTSPCH contains an CTS ALIVE CHECK REQUEST message, the addressed
CTS‑MS shall send a CTS ALIVE CHECK RESPONSE message. A CTS ALIVE CHECK
RESPONSE message shall be send by the CTS‑MS in response to each CTS ALIVE
CHECK REQUEST message received with the corresponding CTSMSI.
The CTS ALIVE CHECK RESPONSE messages are sent on the CTSARCH and contain as
parameters:
\- an establishment cause which corresponds to \"_attachment update_ \" given
by the RR entity in response to a CTS ALIVE CHECK REQUEST message;
\- the CTS‑MS Mobile Subscriber Identity.
### 4.2.2 CTS-FP side
#### 4.2.2.1 CTSBCH information broadcasting
FPBI and CTS-FP status are regularly broadcast by the CTS-FP on the CTSBCH.
Based on this information, the CTS-MS is able to decide whether it may gain
access to the CTS-FP.
The information broadcast may be grouped in the following classes:
\- information giving unique identification of the current CTS-FP cell;
\- information describing the Training Sequence Code to be used in dedicated
mode;
\- information describing the Radio Resource availability at the CTS-FP side;
\- information describing the presence of a Paging Channel;
\- information describing the timeslot number to be used by the CTSCCH except
CTSBCH (i.e. CTSARCH, CTSPCH and CTSAGCH);
\- information describing the shifting status of the CTSBCH.
#### 4.2.2.2 CTSPCH information broadcasting
In pure idle mode, the Paging Channel is not used. The CTS-FP shall set the
CTSPCH indicator flag to \"_no CTSPCH_ \" value.
#### 4.2.2.3 Alive check
The CTS-FP initiates the alive check procedure by broadcasting a CTS PAGING
REQUEST message with an indication of Alive Check, and start timer TC3101. The
CTSPCH indicator flag shall be set to \"_CTSPCH to decode_ \" and the
CTSBCH‑SB Status field shall be set to idle. The alive check procedure shall
not be triggered if the CTS‑FP is in a busy state (no radio resources
available); i.e. CTS‑FP RR layer shall reject upper layer alive check
procedure initiation request.
When receiving a CTS PAGING REQUEST with an indication of Alive Check, the
CTS-MS shall send 2 CTS ACCESS REQUEST messages.
When receiving a valid CTS ACCESS REQUEST, the CTS‑FP shall stop timer TC3101.
The CTS‑FP RR sublayer shall end the alive check procedure when:
\- a CTS ACCESS REQUEST with a valid cause has been received from the polled
CTS‑MS; or
\-- timer TC3101 expires; or
\- an end of alive check procedure is triggered by the upper layer; or
\- a paging procedure requiring a new PAGING REQUEST message to be started; or
\- a busy state occurs (i.e. no more radio resource available).
The CTS‑FP shall ignore unsolicited or out of sequence CTS ACCESS REQUEST.

#### 4.2.2.4 Hunting
The CTS-FP initiates the hunting procedure by continuously broadcasting CTS
HUNTING REQUEST messages on the CTSPCH channel, and start timer TC3102. The
CTSPCH indicator flag shall be set to \"_CTSPCH to decode_ \". The value of
TC3102 is manufacturer dependant, but shall be less than 120 s. The hunting
procedure shall not be triggered if the CTS‑FP is in a busy state (no radio
resources available); i.e. CTS‑FP RR layer shall reject upper layer hunting
procedure initiation request.
Upon receipt of a CTS HUNTING REQUEST, the CTS‑MSs shall act as following:
\- if group alerting was requested, the CTS‑MS shall alert if the received
connectionless group CTSMSI is equal to its assigned connectionless group
CTSMSI (if any);
\- if collective alerting was requested, the CTS‑MS shall start alerting.
Hunted CTS‑MS are required to receive and analyse the message sent on the next
CTSPCH occurrence. The CTS‑MSs shall consider that the hunting procedure has
been ended by the CTS‑FP when no CTS HUNTING REQUEST message has been received
within the 3 latest occurrences of the CTSPCH. The CTS-MSs shall stop
alerting.
The CTS‑FP shall end the hunting procedure when:
\- T~C3102~ expires; or
\- a paging procedure is to be started; or
\- an end of hunting procedure is triggered by the CTS‑FP user; or
\- a busy state occurs (i.e. no more radio resource available).
A CTS‑MS shall stop alerting when requested by the user.

## 4.4 Procedures in dedicated mode
Procedures described in this subclause apply to the dedicated mode.
Direct transition between dedicated mode and group transmit mode is possible
in both directions by use of the following procedures:
\- Channel assignment procedure;
\- Channel mode modify procedure.
### 4.4.1 SACCH procedures
#### 4.4.1.1 General
In RR connected mode, the SACCH is used in signalling at least for measurement
results transmission from the CTS‑MS. Continuous transmission must occur in
both directions. For that purpose, in CTS‑MS to CTS‑FP direction, measurement
result messages are sent at each possible occasion when nothing else has to be
sent. Similarly, empty UI frames are sent in the CTS‑FP to CTS‑MS direction
when nothing else has to be sent.
#### 4.4.1.2 Measurement report
When in RR connected mode, the CTS‑MS regularly sends CTS MEASURMENT REPORT
messages to the CTS‑FP. These messages contain measurement results about
reception characteristics from the current cell. They are sent on the slow
ACCH, in unacknowledged mode. If no other message is scheduled on the SACCH at
the instant when a layer 2 frame is due to be sent, then the CTS‑MS shall send
a CTS MEASUREMENT REPORT message. The interval between two successive layer 2
frame containing CTS MEASUREMENT REPORT messages shall not exceed one layer 2
frame.
### 4.4.2 Transfer of messages and link layer service provision
When in dedicated mode or in group transmit mode, upper layers can send
messages in multiframe or unacknowledged mode on SAPI 0.
Moreover, but only when in dedicated mode, upper layers have access to the
full link layer services for SAPIs other than 0, with the exception of the
error indication and local end release that are directly treated by the RR
sublayer, as specified in particular places of clause 4.
### 4.4.3 Intracell handover procedure
In dedicated mode, an intracell change of channel can be requested by upper
layers for changing the channel type, or decided by the RR sublayer, e.g. for
an internal handover. This change may be performed through the dedicated
channel assignment procedure.
The purpose of the channel assignment procedure is to completely modify the
physical channel configuration of the mobile station without frequency
redefinition or change in synchronisation while staying in the same CTS-cell.
This procedure shall not be used for changing between dependent
configurations, i.e. those sharing Radio Resource for the main signalling
link. An example of dependent channels is a full rate channel and one of the
corresponding half rate channels. In multislot operation however, it is
allowed to use the same timeslots before and after the assignment, as long as
the main signalling link has been changed. The only procedures provided for
changing between dependent configurations for the main signalling link are the
additional assignment and the partial release procedures.
The channel assignment procedure happens only in dedicated mode. This
procedure cannot be used in the idle mode; in this case the immediate
assignment procedure is used.
The channel assignment procedure includes:
\- the suspension of normal operation except for RR management (layer 3);
\- the release of the main signalling link, and of the other data links as
defined in subclause 4.1.4, and the disconnection of TCHs if any;
\- the deactivation of previously assigned channels (layer 1);
\- the activation of the new channels and their connection if applicable;
\- the triggering of the establishment of the data link connections for SAPI =
0.
The channel assignment procedure is always initiated by the CTS‑FP.
#### 4.4.3.1 Intracell handover initiation
The CTS‑FP initiates the intracell handover procedure by sending a CTS
INTRACELL HANDOVER COMMAND message to the CTS‑MS on the main signalling link.
The CTS‑FP then starts timer T~C3105~. When sending this message on the CTS‑FP
side, and receiving it on the CTS‑MS side, all transmission of signalling
layer message except for those RR messages needed for this procedure and for
abnormal cases is suspended until resumption is indicated.
Upon receipt of the CTS INTRACELL HANDOVER COMMAND message, the CTS-MS
initiates a local end release of link layer connections, disconnects the
physical channels, commands the switching to the assigned channel and
initiates the establishment of lower layer connections.
The CTS‑MS shall wait up to the starting time before accessing the channel. If
the starting time has already elapsed, the CTS‑MS shall access the channel as
an immediate reaction to the reception of the message.
#### 4.4.3.2 Intracell handover completion
After the main signalling link is successfully established, the CTS‑MS returns
a CTS INTRACELL HANDOVER COMPLETE message specifying cause \"normal event\'\'
to the CTS‑FP on the main DCCH.
The sending of this message on the CTS‑MS side and its receipt on the CTS‑FP
side allow the resumption of the transmission of signalling layer messages
other than those belonging to RR management.
At the receipt of the CTS INTRACELL HANDOVER, the CTS‑FP releases the
previously allocated resources and stops timer TC3105.
#### 4.4.3.3 Abnormal cases
If the CTS INTRACELL HANDOVER COMMAND instruct the CTS‑MS to use a parameter
that it is not capable of, then the CTS-MS shall return a CTS INTRACELL
HANDOVER FAILURE message, and the CTS-MS shall remain on the current
channel(s) and use the old channel description or channel mode.
When receiving a CTS INTRACELL HANDOVER FAILURE message, the CTS‑FP stops
TC3105.
On the CTS‑FP side, if timer T~C3105~ elapses before either the CTS INTRACELL
HANDOVER COMPLETE message has been receive on the new channel or a CTS
INTRACELL HANDOVER FAILURE message is received or the CTS‑MS has re-
established the call, the old and the new channels are released and all
contexts related to the connection with that CTS‑MS are cleared.
### 4.4.4 Intercell handover procedure
Intercell handover is a CTS phase 2 issue.
### 4.4.5 Frequency hopping definition procedure
This procedure is used by the CTS‑FP to update the Total Frequency Hopping
List and Total Frequency Hopping parameters in the MS. The CTS‑FP send a CTS
FREQUENCY HOPPING DEFINITION message containing the new parameters together
with a reference time indication. The TFH parameters are split in general
static parameters and current dynamic parameters which are valid for a given
TDMA frame number. The values indicated by the current parameters IE are those
used by the TFH algorithm at the frame number indicated by the reference time.
These parameters shall be used after the RR connection is released when the MS
is returning in idle mode.
### 4.4.6 Channel mode modify procedure
In dedicated mode, higher layers can request the setting of the channel mode.
The channel mode modify procedure allows the CTS‑FP to request the mobile
station to set the channel mode for one channel or one channel set. The
channel mode covers the coding, decoding and transcoding mode used on the
indicated channel.
This procedure is always initiated by the CTS‑FP.
NOTE: Direct transitions between full rate speech coder version 1 and full
rate speech coder version 2 (and vice versa) may cause unpleasant audio
bursts.
#### 4.4.6.1 Normal channel mode modify procedure
##### 4.4.6.1.1 Initiation of the channel mode modify procedure
The FP initiates the procedure by sending a message CTS CHANNEL MODE MODIFY to
the CTS‑MS. This message contains:
\- a channel description of the channel(s) on which the specified mode shall
be applied; and
\- the mode to be used on that channel.
##### 4.4.6.1.2 Completion of channel mode modify procedure
When it has received the CTS CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message, the CTS‑MS sets the
mode for the indicated channel, and if that is in a multislot configuration,
the whole channel set and then replies by a CTS CHANNEL MODE MODIFY
ACKNOWLEDGE message indicating the ordered channel mode.
This applies whether the mode commanded by the CTS CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message
is different from the one used by the CTS‑MS or whether it is already in use.
##### 4.4.6.1.3 Abnormal cases
No specific action for a lower layer failure is specified in this subclause.
If the mobile station does not support the indicated mode, it shall retain the
old mode and return the associated channel mode information in CTS CHANNEL
MODE MODIFY message.
### 4.4.7 Ciphering mode setting procedure
In dedicated mode, the ciphering mode setting procedure is used by the FP to
set the ciphering mode, i.e. whether or not the transmission is ciphered, and
if so which algorithm to use. The procedure shall only be used to change from
\"not ciphered\" mode to \"ciphered\" mode, or vice-versa, or to pass a CTS
CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message to the mobile station while remaining in the
\"not ciphered\" mode. The ciphering mode setting procedure is always
triggered by the FP and it only applies to dedicated resources.
#### 4.4.7.1 Ciphering mode setting initiation
The CTS‑FP initiates the ciphering mode setting procedure by sending a CTS
CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message to the mobile station on the main signalling
link, indicating whether ciphering shall be used or not, and if yes which
algorithm to use.
The new mode is applied for reception on the CTS‑FP side after the message has
been sent.
#### 4.4.7.2 Ciphering mode setting completion
Whenever the CTS‑MS receives a CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message, it shall,
if a SIM is present and considered valid by the mobile equipment and the
ciphering key sequence number stored on the SIM indicates that a CTS ciphering
key is available, load the ciphering key stored on the SIM into the ME. A
valid CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message is defined to be one of the
following:
\- one that indicates \"start ciphering\" and is received by the mobile
station in the \"not ciphered\" mode;
\- one that indicates \"no ciphering\" and is received by the MS in the \"not
ciphered\" mode; or
\- one that indicates \"no ciphering\" and is received by the mobile station
in the \"ciphered\" mode.
Other CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND messages shall be regarded as erroneous, an
CTS RR STATUS message with cause \"Protocol error unspecified\" shall be
returned, and no further action taken.
Upon receipt of the CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message indicating ciphering,
the mobile station shall start transmission and reception in the indicated
mode.
When the appropriate action on the CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND has been taken,
the mobile station sends back a CTS CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message. If the
\"cipher response\" field of the cipher response information element in the
CTS CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message specified \"IMEI must be included\" the
mobile station shall include its IMEISV in the CTS CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE
message.
Upon receipt of the CTS CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message or any other correct
layer 2 frame which was sent in the new mode, the CTS‑FP starts transmission
in the new mode.

# 8 Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data
## 8.1 General
The procedures specified in GSM 04.56 and call-related supplementary service
handling in GSM 04.10 apply to those messages which pass the checks described
in this subclause.
This subclause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown,
unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity. These
procedures are called \"error handling procedures\", but in addition to
providing recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility
mechanism for future extensions of the protocols.
Error handling concerning the value part of the Facility IE and of the SS
Version Indicator IE are not in the scope of the present document. It is
defined in GSM 04.10 and the GSM 04.8x series.
Subclauses 8.1 to 8.8 shall be applied in order of precedence.
Most error handling procedures are mandatory for the CTS‑MS.
Detailed error handling procedures in the CTS‑FP are implementation dependent
and may vary. However, when extensions of this protocol are developed, CTS-FP
will be assumed to have the error handling that is indicated in this subclause
as mandatory (\"shall\") and that is indicated as strongly recommended
(\"should\"). Subclauses 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.7.2 do not apply to the
error handling in the CTS‑FP applied to the receipt of initial layer 3
message: If the CTS-FP diagnoses an error described in one of these subclauses
in the initial layer 3 message received from the CTS‑MS, it shall either:
\- try to recognise the classmark and then take further implementation
dependent actions; or
\- release the RR-connection.
Also, the error handling of the CTS‑FP is only considered as mandatory or
strongly recommended when certain thresholds for errors are not reached during
a dedicated connection.
In this subclause the following terminology is used:
\- An IE is defined to be syntactically incorrect in a message if it contains
at least one value defined as \"reserved\" in clause 10, or if its value part
violates rules of clause 10. However it is not a syntactical error that a type
4 IE specifies in its length indicator a greater length than defined in clause
10.
\- A message is defined to have semantically incorrect contents if it contains
information which, possibly dependent on the state of the receiver, is in
contradiction to the resources of the receiver and/or to the procedural part
(i.e. clauses 4 and 5) of GSM 04.58, GSM 04.10, or relevant GSM 04.8X series.
## 8.2 Message too short
When a message is received that is too short to contain a complete message
type information element, that message shall be ignored, see GSM 04.07.
## 8.3 Unknown or unforeseen transaction identifier
See GSM 04.08 clause 8.3. The CTS-FP shall act as the \"network\", whereas it
is stated so.
## 8.4 Unknown or unforeseen message type
If a CTS‑MS receives a message with message type not defined for the PD and
SPD or not implemented by the receiver in unacknowledged mode, it shall ignore
the message.
If a CTS‑MS receives a message with message type not defined for the PD and
SPD or not implemented by the receiver in acknowledged mode, it shall return a
status message (STATUS, CTS RR STATUS or MM STATUS depending on the protocol
discriminator and sub-protocol discriminator) with cause # 97 \"message type
non-existent or not implemented\".
If the CTS‑FP receives an RR message or MM message with message type not
defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver in a protocol state
where reception of an unsolicited message with the given PD from the CTS‑MS is
not foreseen in the protocol, the CTS‑FP actions are implementation dependent.
Otherwise, if the CTS-FP receives a message with message type not defined for
the PD and the SPD or not implemented by the receiver, it shall ignore the
message except that it should return a status message (STATUS, CTS RR STATUS
or MM STATUS depending on the protocol discriminator and Sub-Protocol
Discriminator) with cause #97 \"message type non-existent or not
implemented\".
NOTE: A message type not defined for the PD and SPD in the given direction is
regarded by the receiver as a message type not defined for the PD and SPD, see
GSM 04.07 [20].
If the CTS‑MS receives a message not compatible with the protocol state, the
CTS‑MS shall ignore the message except for the fact that, if an RR connection
exists, it returns a status message (STATUS, CTS RR STATUS or MM STATUS
depending on the protocol discriminator and sub-protocol discriminator) with
cause #98 \"Message type not compatible with protocol state\".
If the CTS‑FP receives a message not compatible with the protocol state, the
CTS‑FP actions are implementation dependent.
## 8.5 Non-semantical mandatory information element errors
When on receipt of a message:
\- an \"imperative message part\" error; or
\- a \"missing mandatory IE\" error;
is diagnosed or when a message containing:
\- a syntactically incorrect mandatory IE; or
\- an IE unknown in the message, but encoded as \"comprehension required\"
(see subclause 10.5); or
\- an out of sequence IE encoded as \"comprehension required\" (see subclause
10.5)
is received,
\- the CTS‑MS station shall proceed as follows:
If the message is not one of the messages listed in subclauses 8.5.1, 8.5.2,
and 8.5.3, the CTS‑MS shall ignore the message except for the fact that, if an
RR connection exists, it shall return a status message (STATUS, CTS RR STATUS
or MM STATUS depending on the protocol discriminator and sub-protocol
discriminator) with cause # 96 \"invalid mandatory information\".
\- the CTS‑FP shall proceed as follows:
When the message is not one of the messages listed in subclause 8.5.3 b), c),
d) or e), the CTS‑FP shall either
\- try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation
dependent); or
\- ignore the message except that it should return a status message (STATUS,
CTS RR STATUS, or MM STATUS depending on the protocol discriminator and sub-
protocol discriminator) with cause # 96 \"invalid mandatory information\".
### 8.5.1 Radio resource management
For the CTS‑MS the following procedures shall apply:
\- If the message is a CTS CHANNEL RELEASE message, the actions taken shall be
the same as specified in subclause 4.4.13 \"RR connection release\".
### 8.5.2 Mobility management
No exceptional cases are described for mobility management messages.
### 8.5.3 Call control
See GSM 04.08 subclause 8.5.3.
## 8.6 Unknown and unforeseen IEs in the non-imperative message part
### 8.6.1 IEIs unknown in the message
The CTS‑MS shall ignore all IEs unknown in a message which are not encoded as
\"comprehension required\".
The CTS‑FP shall take the same approach.
### 8.6.2 Out of sequence IEs
The CTS‑MS shall ignore all out of sequence IEs in a message which are not
encoded as \"comprehension required\".
The CTS-FP should take the same approach.
### 8.6.3 Repeated IEs
If an information element with format T, TV, or TLV is repeated in a message
in which repetition of the information element is not specified in clause 9 of
the present document, only the contents of the information element appearing
first shall be handled and all subsequent repetitions of the information
element shall be ignored. When repetition of information elements is
specified, only the contents of specified repeated information elements shall
be handled. If the limit on repetition of information elements is exceeded,
the contents of information elements appearing first up to the limit of
repetitions shall be handled and all subsequent repetitions of the information
element shall be ignored.
The CTS‑FP should follow the same procedures.
## 8.7 Non-imperative message part errors
This category includes:
\- syntactically incorrect optional IEs;
\- conditional IE errors.
### 8.7.1 Syntactically incorrect optional IEs
The CTS‑MS shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in a
message as not present in the message.
The CTS‑FP shall take the same approach.
### 8.7.2 Conditional IE errors
When the CTS‑MS upon receipt of a message diagnoses a \"missing conditional
IE\" error or an \"unexpected conditional IE\" error or when it receives a
message containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE, it
shall ignore the message except for the fact that, if an RR connection exists,
it shall return a status message (STATUS, CTS RR STATUS, or MM STATUS
depending on the PD and SPD) with cause value # 100 \"conditional IE error\".
When the CTS‑FP receives a message and diagnose a \"missing conditional IE\"
error or an \"unexpected conditional IE\" error or when it receives a message
containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE, the CTS‑FP
shall either:
\- try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation
dependent); or
\- ignore the message except that it should return a status message (STATUS,
CTS RR STATUS or MM STATUS depending on the protocol discriminator and sub-
protocol discriminator) with cause # 100 \"conditional IE error\".
## 8.8 Messages with semantically incorrect contents
When a message with semantically incorrect contents is received, the foreseen
reactions of the procedural part of GSM 04.56 (i.e. of clauses 5, 5, 6) are
performed. If however no such reactions are specified, the CTS‑MS shall ignore
the message except for the fact that, if an RR connection exists, it returns a
status message (STATUS, CTS RR STATUS, or MM STATUS depending on the PD and
SPD) with cause value # 95 \"semantically incorrect message\".
The CTS‑FP should follow the same procedure except that a status message is
not normally transmitted.
Semantic checking of the Facility information element value part (defined in
GSM 04.80) is the subject of the technical specifications GSM 04.10 and the
GSM 04.8x series.
# 9 Message functional definitions and contents
This subclause defines the structure of the messages of those layer 3
protocols defined in GSM 04.56. These are standard L3 messages as defined in
GSM 04.07 with the exception of those sent on the SCH, ARCH.
Each definition given in the present subclause includes:
a) a brief description of the message direction and use, including whether the
message has:
1\. Local significance, i.e. relevant only on the originating or terminating
access;
2\. Access significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating
access, but not in the CTS‑FP;
3\. Dual significance, i.e. relevant in either the originating or terminating
access and in the network; or
4\. Global significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating
access and in the network.
b) a table listing the information elements known in the message and their
order of their appearance in the message. All information elements that may be
repeated are explicitly indicated. (V and LV formatted IEs, which compose the
imperative part of the message, occur before T, TV, and TLV formatted IEs
which compose the non-imperative part of the message, see GSM 04.07.) In a
(maximal) sequence of consecutive information elements with half octet length,
the first information element with half octet length occupies bits 1 to 4 of
octet N, the second bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third bits 1 to 4 of octet N+1
etc. Such a sequence always has an even number of elements.
For each information element the table indicates:
1\. the information element identifier, in hexadecimal notation, if the IE has
format T, TV, or TLV. Usually, there is a default IEI for an information
element type; default IEIs of different IE types of the same protocol are
different. If the IEI has half octet length, it is specified by a notation
representing the IEI as a hexadecimal digit followed by a \"-\" (example: B-).
NOTE: The same IEI may be used for different information element types in
different messages of the same protocol.
2\. the name of the information element (which may give an idea of the
semantics of the element). The name of the information element (usually
written in italics) followed by \"IE\" or \"information element\" is used in
GSM 04.08 as reference to the information element within a message.
3\. the name of the type of the information element (which indicates the
coding of the value part of the IE), and generally, the referenced subclause
of clause 10 of GSM 04.08 describing the value part of the information
element.
4\. the presence requirement indication (M, C, or O) for the IE as defined in
GSM 04.07.
5\. The format of the information element (T, V, TV, LV, TLV) as defined in
GSM 04.07.
6\. The length of the information element (or permissible range of lengths),
in octets, in the message, where \"?\" means that the maximum length of the IE
is only constrained by link layer protocol, and in the case of the Facility IE
by possible further conditions specified in GSM 04.10. This indication is non-
normative.
c) subclauses specifying, where appropriate, conditions for IEs with presence
