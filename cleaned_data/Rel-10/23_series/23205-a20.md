# 1 Scope
The present document defines the stage 2 description for the bearer
independent CS core network. The stage 2 shall cover the information flow
between the GMSC server, MSC server and media gateways. Note that nothing in
the present document shall preclude an implementation of a combined MSC Server
and MGW. The present document shall show the CS core network termination of
the Iu interface in order to cover the information flow stimulus to the core
network and describe the interaction with the supplementary and value added
services and capabilities.
For the purposes of the present document, the protocol used over the Nc
interface is an enhanced call control protocol supporting call bearer
separation such as BICC (which is specified in [22]). The protocol used over
the Mc interface is H.248 (which is specified in 3GPP TS 29.232 [6]). Existing
specifications and recommendations shall not be repeated, as such the relevant
specification shall be referred to.
SIP-I based CS core network is further specified in 3GPP TS 23.231 [42].
Local Call Local Switch (LCLS) functionality is further specified in 3GPP TS
23.284 [45].
The present document is applicable only for ATM or IP transport in the CS core
network.

# 4 Main Concepts
## 4.1 General
The circuit switched core network enables the support of different transports
(e.g. ATM or IP) in a bearer-independent fashion. For the ATM and IP
transport, there is a strict separation between the call control level and the
bearer control level. In the case of ATM or IP transport, the passage of
compressed speech at variable bit rates is possible through the CS core
network.
The CS core network shall employ the MSC server, GMSC server and media
gateways. The GMSC server and MSC server shall provide the call control and
mobility management functions, and the media gateway shall provide the bearer
control and transmission resource functions. The media gateway shall contain
the stream manipulating functions.
The GMSC server and MSC servers are connected to the media gateway via the Mc
reference point. The MSC servers and GMSC servers are connected with the Nc
reference point. There may be a number of call control transit nodes between
the MSC server and GMSC server in the Nc reference point. The MGWs are
connected with the Nb reference point.
The users connected to the CS core network shall not be aware whether a MSC
server -- media gateway combination is used, or a monolithic MSC is used.
## 4.2 Bearer-Independent Call Control
The protocol used on the Nc interface shall be a call control protocol
supporting IP and ATM transports in a bearerâ€‘independent manner for the ISDN
service set, allowing the physical separation of the call control entities
from the bearer control entities.
An exception to this bearer independence concept is if Iu interface is on IP
and the IP addresses are to be exchanged via call control plane signalling
(known by the MSC due to configuration data). In this case the specific
handling is described separately.
Another exception to the bearer independence concept is the case of A
interface user plane over IP (AoIP). In that case the IP addresses/UDP port
numbers are to be exchanged via call control plane signalling. Specific
handling is also described separately for this case.
## 4.3 H.248/MEGACO
H.248/MEGACO has been jointly developed within the ITU-T and the IETF, and
supports a separation of call control entities from bearer control entities,
and a separation of bearer control entities from transport entities. H.248 is
used on the Mc interface between the (G)MSC servers and the media gateway.
# 5 General Circuit Switched Core Network Domain Architecture
## 5.1 Logical Architecture
The overall CS core network logical architecture is shown in figure 1.
### 5.1.1 CS Core Network Nodes
#### 5.1.1.1 MSC Server
The MSC server mainly comprises the call control and mobility control parts of
a GSM/UMTS MSC as described in 3GPP TS 23.002 [2]. It is also integrated with
a VLR to hold the mobile subscriber\'s service data and CAMEL related data.
The MSC server terminates the user-network signalling (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [4])
and translates it into the signalling over the Nc interface. The MSC Server
terminates the Iu control plane signalling and its transport bearer (see 3GPP
TS 25.413 [26] and 3GPP TS 25.412 [30]). It also terminates the signalling
over the Mc interface with the Media Gateway.
The MSC server controls the parts of the call state model that pertain to
connection control for media channels in an MGW. It also contains the \"Call
Control Function\" in the BICC model.
#### 5.1.1.2 GMSC Server
The GMSC server mainly comprises the call control and mobility control parts
of a GSM/UMTS GMSC as described in 3GPP TS 23.002 [2].
The GMSC server terminates the signalling over the Nc interface and the call
control interfaces to the external networks. It also terminates the signalling
over the Mc interface towards the Media Gateway.
The GMSC server controls the parts of the call state model that pertain to
connection control for media channels in an MGW. It also contains the \"Call
Control Function\" in the BICC model.
#### 5.1.1.3 Media Gateway
The Media Gateway terminates the signalling over the Mc interface from the
(G)MSC servers. The Media Gateway terminates the Iu transport network control
plane signalling with its transport bearer (see 3GPP TS 25.410 [31] and 3GPP
TS 25.414 [32]). The Media Gateway also terminates the Iu user plane protocol
(see 3GPP TS 25.415 [20]). It also terminates the bearer control signalling
and the transport bearer over the Nb interface (see 3GPP TS 29.414 [21] and
3GPP TS 29.415 [7]).
The Media Gateway contains bearer terminations and media manipulation
equipment (e.g. transcoders, echo cancellers, or tone senders). It may perform
media conversion and framing protocol conversion.
### 5.1.2 CS Core Network Interfaces and Reference Points
#### 5.1.2.1 Mc Interface
The Mc reference point in the present document considers the aspects of the
interface between the (G)MSC server and the MGW. The H.248 protocol [5]
together with 3GPP specific extensions/packages shall be used over the Mc
interface.
#### 5.1.2.2 Nc Interface
The Network-Network based call control is used over the Nc interface. Any
suitable call control protocol may be used over the Nc interface (e.g. BICC).
#### 5.1.2.3 Nb Interface
The bearer control signalling and transport are carried over the Nb interface.
## 5.2 Network Interworking
### 5.2.1 Interworking on the Nc Reference Point
Interworking between the Nc reference point, call control protocols and ISUP
is defined within the 3GPP stage 3 documentation for each protocol (or by
references specified in stage 3 documentation [6]).
### 5.2.2 Interworking on the Nb Reference Point
The interworking is specified in 3GPP TS 29.415 [7] and 3GPP TS 29.414 [21].
# 6 Call Establishment
NOTE1: All message sequence charts in this clause are examples. All valid call
establishment message sequences can be derived from the example message
sequences and associated message pre-conditions.
NOTE2: The continuity indication in the IAM is not used to indicate that a
continuity check will be performed on the current leg of the call, but it is
used to indicate that a Continuity message can be expected as a result of a
continuity check on a preceding ISUP circuit, or establishment of a preceding
bearer connection.
## 6.1 Basic Mobile Originating Call
### 6.1.1 Forward bearer establishment
The mobile originating call shall be established in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.108 [17]. The following clauses describe the additional requirements for
the bearer independent CS core network. If out-of-band transcoder control is
applied for a speech call, it shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.153 [3].
#### 6.1.1.1 MGW selection
The MSC server shall select an MGW for the bearer connection before it
performs the access bearer assignment or the network side bearer
establishment. This may happen either before sending the IAM or after
receiving the Bearer Information message. In the latter case, the MGW
selection may be based on a possibly received MGW-id from the succeeding node
(bullet 1 or bullet 2 in figure 6.2). For GSM, if performing Service based
handover (see 3GPP TS 48.008 [27]) the MSC Server may omit MGW selection at
this time.
#### 6.1.1.2 Initial addressing
The MSC server shall indicate in the IAM that forward bearer establishment is
to be used. If access bearer assignment has not been completed, the MSC server
shall indicate that the Continuity message will follow. However, if late
access bearer assignment (assignment after alerting or answer) is used the MSC
server shall not indicate that the Continuity message will follow. The MSC
server provides the bearer characteristics to the succeeding node in the IAM.
If the MGW is selected at an earlier stage the MGW-id may also be provided in
the IAM (bullet 1 in figure 6.2).
#### 6.1.1.3 Network side bearer establishment
The MSC server shall select bearer characteristics for the network side bearer
connection before sending the IAM. After the succeeding node has provided a
bearer address and a binding reference in the Bearer Information message the
MSC server uses the Establish Bearer procedure to request the MGW to establish
a bearer towards the destination MGW. The MSC server provides the MGW with the
bearer address, the binding reference and the bearer characteristics (bullet 2
in figure 6.2).
#### 6.1.1.4 Access bearer assignment
The MSC server shall select bearer characteristics for the access bearer.
For UMTS, before the MSC server starts the access bearer assignment, the MSC
server requests the MGW to prepare for the access bearer establishment using
the Prepare Bearer procedure. The MSC server requests the MGW to provide a
bearer address and a binding reference, provides the MGW with the bearer
characteristics and requests notification that the bearer can be modified. For
speech calls, the MSC server shall provide the MGW with the speech coding
information and conditionally GTT related information in accordance with 3GPP
TS 23.226 [28] for the bearer. For a non-speech call the MSC server also
provides the MGW with a PLMN Bearer Capability [4]. After the MGW has replied
with the bearer address and the binding reference the MSC server requests
access bearer assignment using the provided bearer address and binding
reference (bullet 3 in figure 6.2) in accordance with 3GPP TS 25.413 [26]. The
MSC shall only be notified by the MGW using Bearer Modification Support
procedure if the existing link characteristics of the access bearer can be
modified at a later stage, see subclause 13.18.1.
For GERAN Iu mode the MSC Server receives the GERAN capabilities within the
RANAP INITIAL UE MESSAGE, indicating the services (e.g. for CS speech services
the supported codec types and, for an adaptive codec type, the supported codec
modes (for definition see [27])), which will be available at the RAB
establishment procedure. The MSC server shall take the indicated GERAN
capabilities into account as well as the received MS capabilities when
negotiating a service. Additionally, when requesting the access bearer
assignment the MSC server shall indicate to the GERAN the selected service
(e.g. selected codec type). The MSC server shall not set codec information in
the NAS Synchronisation Indicator (see [4]). Instead it shall set codec
information in the GERAN BSC container.
For GSM, before the MSC server starts the access bearer assignment, the MSC
server uses the Reserve Circuit procedure to seize a TDM circuit. For a non-
speech call the MSC server also provides the MGW with a PLMN Bearer Capability
[4] and a GSM channel coding. After the MGW has replied to the TDM circuit
seizure, the MSC server requests access bearer assignment (bullet 4 in figure
6.2) in accordance with 3GPP TS 48.008 [27]. If performing Service based
handover (see 3GPP TS 48.008 [27]) the MSC Server may omit to perform Reserve
Circuit procedure.
#### 6.1.1.5 Framing protocol initialisation
In 3GPP CS CN speech and data shall be carried using the Iu/Nb User Plane
Protocol. The specification for the Iu UP protocol is defined in [20] and the
Nb UP Protocol in [7] and [21]. The Iu/Nb UP Protocol is established through
the CN in a forward direction. This is established independently of the bearer
establishment direction. The MGW derives the forward direction from
information sent by the MSC server within the Establish Bearer and Prepare
Bearer procedures [6].
##### 6.1.1.6 Confirmation of bearer establishment
If the IAM which was sent to the succeeding node indicated that the Continuity
message will follow, the MSC server sends the Continuity message when the
access bearer assignment has been completed (bullet 5 in figure 6.2).
#### 6.1.1.7 Through-Connection
During any one of the Prepare Bearer, Reserve Circuit and Establish Bearer
procedures, the MSC server will use the Change Through-Connection procedure to
request the MGW to through-connect the bearer terminations so that the bearer
will be backward through-connected (bullet 2, and bullet 3 or 4 in figure
6.2).
For a multimedia call, the MSC may request the MGW to both-way through-connect
the bearer using the Change Through-Connection procedure to generate a
multimedia CAT (see subclause 14.10.3.1).
Otherwise when MSC server receives the answer indication, it requests the MGW
to both-way through-connect the bearer using the Change Through-Connection
procedure (bullet 6 in figure 6.2).
#### 6.1.1.8 Interworking function
The MGW may use an interworking function that is based on the PLMN Bearer
Capability [4] of the bearer termination. The activation of the possible
interworking function in both bearer terminations will be requested by the MSC
server at reception of the answer indication using the Activate Interworking
Function procedure (bullet 6 in figure 6.2).
#### 6.1.1.9 Codec handling
The MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each bearer termination.
#### 6.1.1.10 Voice Processing function
A voice processing function located on the MGW may be used to achieve desired
acoustic quality on the bearer terminations. The MSC server shall request the
activation of voice processing functions in the bearer terminations. For non-
speech calls, the MSC server has the ability to instruct the MGW to disable
the voice processing functions (bullet 6 in figure 6.2).
#### 6.1.1.11 Failure handling in MSC server
If any procedure between the MSC server and the MGW has not completed
successfully or the MSC server receives a Bearer Released procedure from the
MGW, the call shall be cleared as described in clause 7.3, (G)MSC server
initiated call clearing or in clause 7.4, MGW initiated call clearing.
Alternatively, the MSC server may only release the resources in the MGW that
caused the failure, possibly select a new MGW for the bearer connection and
continue the call establishment using new resources in the selected MGW.
#### 6.1.1.12 Example
Figure 6.1 shows the network model for the mobile originating call. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling (not applicable in A/Gb mode for the
A-interface) and the bearer. The MSC server seizes one context with two bearer
terminations in the MGW. The bearer termination T1 is used for the bearer
towards the RNC/BSC and the bearer termination T2 is used for the bearer
towards the succeeding MGW.

Figure 6.1: Basic Mobile Originating Call, Forward Bearer Establishment
(network model)
Figure 6.2 shows the message sequence chart example for the mobile originating
call. In the example the MSC server requests seizure of the network side
bearer termination and establishment of the bearer when the Bearer Information
message is received from the succeeding node. After the network side bearer
termination is seized the MSC server requests seizure of the access side
bearer termination. When the MSC server receives an answer indication, it
shall requests the MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer terminations.
The MSC shall also request the possible activation of the interworking
function in both terminations and the possible activation of the voice
processing functions for the bearer terminations.

(message sequence chart continue)
### 6.1.2 Backward bearer establishment
The basic mobile originating call shall be established in accordance with 3GPP
TS 23.108 [17]. The following clauses describe the additional requirements for
the bearer independent CS core network. If out-of-band transcoder control is
applied for a speech call, it shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.153 [3].
#### 6.1.2.1 MGW selection
The MSC server shall select an MGW for the bearer connection before it
performs the access bearer assignment or the network side bearer
establishment. This happens before sending the IAM (bullet 1 or 2 in figure
6.4). For GSM, if performing Service based handover (see 3GPP TS 48.008 [27])
the MSC Server may omit MGW selection at this time.
#### 6.1.2.2 Network side bearer establishment
The MSC server shall select bearer characteristics for the network side bearer
connection before sending the IAM. The MSC server requests the MGW to prepare
for the network side bearer establishment using the Prepare Bearer procedure.
The MSC server requests the MGW to provide a bearer address and a binding
reference, and provides the MGW with the bearer characteristics (bullet 3 in
figure 6.4). After the MGW has replied with the bearer address and the binding
reference, the MSC server sends the IAM to the succeeding node.
#### 6.1.2.3 Initial addressing
The MSC server shall indicate in the IAM that backward bearer establishment is
to be used. If access bearer assignment has not been completed, the MSC server
shall indicate that the Continuity message will follow. However, if late
access bearer assignment (assignment after alerting or answer) is used the MSC
server shall not indicate that the Continuity message will follow. The MSC
server provides the bearer characteristics, the bearer address and the binding
reference to the succeeding node in the IAM. The MSC server may also provide
the MGW-id in the IAM (bullet 4 in figure 6.4).
#### 6.1.2.4 Access bearer assignment
The MSC server shall select bearer characteristics for the access bearer.
For UMTS, before the MSC server starts the access bearer assignment, the MSC
server requests the MGW to prepare for the access bearer establishment using
the Prepare Bearer procedure. The MSC server requests the MGW to provide a
bearer address and a binding reference, provides the MGW with the bearer
characteristics and requests notification that the bearer can be modified. For
speech calls, the MSC server shall provide the MGW with the speech coding
information and conditionally GTT related information in accordance with 3GPP
TS 23.226 [28] for the bearer. For a non-speech call the MSC server also
provides the MGW with a PLMN Bearer Capability [4]. After the MGW has replied
with the bearer address and the binding reference the MSC server requests
access bearer assignment using the provided bearer address and binding
reference (bullet 1 in figure 6.4) in accordance with 3GPP TS 25.413 [26]. The
MSC shall only be notified by the MGW using the Bearer Modification Support
procedure if the existing link characteristics of the access bearer can be
modified at a later stage, see subclause 13.18.1.
For GERAN Iu mode the MSC Server receives the GERAN capabilities within the
RANAP INITIAL UE MESSAGE, indicating the services (e.g. for CS speech services
the supported codec types and, for an adaptive codec type, the supported codec
modes (for definition see [27])), which will be available at the RAB
establishment procedure. The MSC server shall take the indicated GERAN
capabilities into account as well as the received MS capabilities when
negotiating a service. Additionally, when requesting the access bearer
assignment the MSC server shall indicate to the GERAN the selected service
(e.g. selected codec type). The MSC server shall not set codec information in
the NAS Synchronisation Indicator (see [4]). Instead it shall set codec
information in the GERAN BSC container.
For GSM, before the MSC server starts the access bearer assignment, the MSC
server uses the Reserve Circuit procedure to seize a TDM circuit. For a non-
speech call the MSC server also provides the MGW with a PLMN Bearer Capability
[4] and a GSM channel coding. After the MGW has replied the TDM circuit
seizure the MSC server requests access bearer assignment (bullet 2 in figure
6.4) in accordance with 3GPP TS 48.008 [27]. If performing Service based
handover (see 3GPP TS 48.008 [27]) the MSC Server may omit to perform Reserve
Circuit procedure.
#### 6.1.2.5 Framing protocol initialisation
In 3GPP CS CN speech and data shall be carried using the Iu/Nb User Plane
Protocol. The specification for the Iu UP protocol is defined in [20] and the
Nb UP Protocol in [7] and [21]. The Iu/Nb UP Protocol is established through
the CN in a forward direction. This is established independently of the bearer
establishment direction. The MGW derives the forward direction from
information sent by the MSC server within the Establish Bearer and Prepare
Bearer procedures [6].
#### 6.1.2.6 Confirmation of bearer establishment
If the IAM was sent to the succeeding node indicating that the Continuity
message will follow, the MSC server sends the Continuity message when the
access bearer assignment has been completed.
#### 6.1.2.7 Through-Connection
During the Prepare Bearer or Reserve Circuit procedures, the MSC server will
use the Change Through-Connection procedure to request the MGW to through-
connect the bearer terminations so that the bearer will be backward
throughâ€‘connected (bullet 1 or 2, and bullet 3 in figure 6.4).
For a multimedia call, the MSC may request the MGW to both-way through-connect
the bearer using the Change Through-Connection procedure to generate a
multimedia CAT (see subclause 14.10.1).
Otherwise when the MSC server receives the answer indication, it requests the
MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer using the Change Through-Connection
procedure (bullet 5 in figure 6.4).
#### 6.1.2.8 Interworking function
The MGW may use an interworking function that is based on the PLMN Bearer
Capability [4] of the bearer termination. The activation of the possible
interworking function in both bearer terminations will be requested by the MSC
server at reception of the answer indication using the Activate Interworking
Function procedure (bullet 5 in figure 6.4).
#### 6.1.2.9 Codec handling
The MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each bearer termination.
#### 6.1.2.10 Voice Processing function
A voice processing function located on the MGW may be used to achieve desired
acoustic quality on the bearer terminations. The MSC server shall request the
activation of the voice processing functions in the bearer terminations. For
non-speech calls, the MSC server has the ability to instruct the MGW to
disable the voice processing functions (bullet 5 in figure 6.4).
#### 6.1.2.11 Failure handling in MSC server
If any procedure between the MSC server and the MGW has not completed
successfully or the MSC server receives a Bearer Released procedure from the
MGW, the call shall be cleared as described in clause 7.3, (G)MSC server
initiated call clearing or in clause 7.4, MGW initiated call clearing.
Alternatively, the MSC server may only release the resources in the MGW that
caused the failure, possibly select a new MGW for the bearer connection and
continue the call establishment using new resources in the selected MGW.
#### 6.1.2.12 Example
Figure 6.3 shows the network model for the mobile originating call. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling (not applicable in A/Gb mode for the
A-interface) and the bearer. The MSC server seizes one context with two bearer
terminations in the MGW. The bearer termination T1 is used for the bearer
towards the RNC/BSC and the bearer termination T2 is used for the bearer
towards the succeeding MGW.

Figure 6.4 shows the message sequence chart example for the mobile originating
call. In the example the MSC server requests seizure of the access side bearer
termination and network side bearer termination. As the access bearer
assignment has been completed before the IAM, no Continuity message will be
sent. When the MSC server receives an answer indication, it requests the MGW
to both-way through-connect the bearer terminations. The MSC server, shall
also request the possible activation of the interworking function in both
bearer terminations. The MSC server shall request the possible activation of
the voice processing functions for the bearer terminations.

### 6.1.3 Originating Call Establishment For Iu Interface on IP
If IuCS on IP is supported by the MSC server, the Core Network side procedures
described in 6.1.1 or 6.1.2 shall apply. For the access side termination, the
exchange of IP addresses via call control procedures is described in this
clause.
Before the MSC server starts the access bearer assignment, the MSC server
requests the MGW to prepare for the access bearer using the
Prepare_IP_Transport procedure. The MSC server requests the MGW to provide an
IP Transport Address and a Iu UDP Port and provides the MGW with the bearer
characteristics. For speech calls, the MSC server shall provide the MGW with
the speech coding information and conditionally GTT related information in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.226 [28]. For a non-speech call the MSC server also
provides the MGW with a PLMN Bearer Capability [4]. After the MGW has replied
with the IP address and UDP Port the MSC server requests access bearer
assignment using the provided IP address and UDP Port in accordance with 3GPP
TS 25.413 [26]. The IP addresses and UDP Ports of the MGW and the RNC are
exchanged via the RANAP procedures. If the bearer transport is IP and IuUP
mode is Transparent, when the MSC receives the RANAP RAB assignment response
it shall send the RNC IP address and UDP Port to the MGW Access bearer
termination using the Modify_IP_Transport_Address procedure.
If the bearer transport is IP and IuUP mode is Support, the MGW shall use the
source IP address and UDP Port of the IuUP Init packet received from the radio
access network as the destination address for subsequent downlink packets.
The sequence is shown in figure 6.1.3/1.
Figure 6.1.3/1: Call Establishment for Iu on IP
### 6.1.4 Forward bearer establishment with Trace Session Activation
The mobile originating call shall be established in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.108 [17]. The following clause describe the additional requirement for the
bearer independent CS core network if a trace session is activated from a MSC
Server to a MGW.
#### 6.1.4.1 Trace activation
When a Trace Session is activated in the MSC Server and the trace control and
configuration parameters requires Trace Session activation to the MGW, the MSC
Server activates the Trace Session to the MGW by using the trace activation
procedure.
#### 6.1.4.2 Example
Figure 6.1.4.1 shows the network model for the mobile originating call. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling (not applicable in A/Gb mode for the
A-interface) and the bearer. The MSC server seizes one context with two bearer
terminations in the MGW. The bearer termination T1 is used for the bearer
towards the RNC/BSC and the bearer termination T2 is used for the bearer
towards the succeeding MGW.

Figure 6.1.4.2 shows the message sequence chart example for the mobile
originating call. In the example the MSC server activates the Trace Session to
MGW when it request the creation of the incoming and outgoing termination with
ADD request. MGW sends the Trace Session Activation result with NOTIFY request
to MSC Server.

### 6.1.5 Originating Call Establishment for A interface over IP
If AoIP is supported by the MSC server, the Core Network side procedures
described in 6.1.1 or 6.1.2 shall apply. For the access side termination, the
exchange of IP addresses and UDP port numbers via call control procedures is
described in this clause.
Before the MSC server sends the Assignment Request to the BSC, the MSC server
requests the MGW to reserve an RTP bearer termination using the Reserve RTP
Connection Point procedure. The MSC server requests the MGW to reserve an IP
Address and UDP Port and also may indicate that the IP interface type is for
AoIP.The MGW reserves the RTP termination and indicates the IP address and UDP
port number to the MSC server. MSC server then requests access bearer
assignment using the provided IP address and UDP Port. When MSC server
receives the BSSMAP ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message, it shall send the BSC IP
address and UDP Port to the MGW Access bearer termination using the Configure
RTP Connection Point procedure.
The sequence is shown in figure 6.1.5.1.

## 6.2 Basic Mobile Terminating Call
### 6.2.1 Forward bearer establishment
The basic mobile terminating call shall be established in accordance with 3GPP
TS 23.108 [18]. The following clauses describe the additional requirements for
the bearer independent CS core network. If out-of-band transcoder control is
applied for a speech call, it shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.153 [3].
#### 6.2.1.1 GMSC server
##### 6.2.1.1.1 MGW selection
The GMSC server shall select an MGW for the bearer connection before it
performs the incoming side bearer establishment or the outgoing side bearer
establishment. This may happen either before sending the IAM or after
receiving the Bearer Information message. If the GMSC server received an MGW-
id from the preceding node and/or from the succeeding node, then it may use
one of them for the MGW selection (bullet 1 or bullet 4 in figure 6.6).
NOTE: As an implementation option, if there is no need for the GMSC server to
manipulate the bearer, the GMSC server may perform call control signalling
without any associated MGW. In that case the bearer related information shall
be passed transparently through the GMSC server.
##### 6.2.1.1.2 Initial addressing
The GMSC server shall indicate in the IAM that forward bearer establishment is
to be used. The GMSC server shall also indicate in the IAM that the Continuity
message will follow if either of the following conditions is satisfied before
sending the IAM:
1\. the incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, but no
Continuity message has been received;
2\. the GMSC server selected an MGW, but a notification of successful bearer
establishment on the incoming side has not been received from the MGW.
The GMSC server shall provide the bearer characteristics to the succeeding
node in the IAM. If the MGW is selected at an early stage the MGW-id may also
be provided in the IAM (bullet 1 in figure 6.6).
##### 6.2.1.1.3 Outgoing side bearer establishment
The GMSC server shall select bearer characteristics for the outgoing side
bearer connection before it sends the IAM. After the GMSC server has received
a bearer address and a binding reference in the Bearer Information message
from the succeeding node the GMSC server requests the MGW to establish a
bearer to the given destination MGW using the Establish Bearer procedure. The
GMSC server shall provide the MGW with the bearer address, the binding
reference and the bearer characteristics (bullet 4 in figure 6.6).
##### 6.2.1.1.4 Incoming side bearer establishment
The GMSC server requests the MGW to prepare for the incoming side bearer
establishment using the Prepare Bearer procedure. The GMSC server requests the
MGW to provide a bearer address, a binding reference and to notify when the
bearer is established (bullet 5 in figure 6.6). The GMSC server also provides
the MGW with the bearer characteristics that was received from the preceding
node in the IAM. After the MGW has replied with the bearer address and the
binding reference, the GMSC server sends the Bearer Information message to the
preceding node. The GMSC server may also include the MGW-id in the Bearer
Information message (bullet 6 in figure 6.6).
NOTE: The incoming side bearer establishment may take place either before or
after HLR interrogation.
##### 6.2.1.1.5 Framing protocol initialisation
In 3GPP CS CN speech and data shall be carried using the Iu/Nb User Plane
Protocol. The specification for the Iu UP protocol is defined in [20] and the
Nb UP Protocol in [7] and [21]. The Iu/Nb UP Protocol is established through
the CN in a forward direction. This is established independently of the bearer
establishment direction. The MGW derives the forward direction from
information sent by the MSC server within the Establish Bearer and Prepare
Bearer procedures [6].The notification of bearer establishment shall not be
sent until the Iu/Nb UP has been initialised.
##### 6.2.1.1.6 Through-Connection
During the Prepare Bearer and Establish Bearer procedures, the GMSC server
will use the Change Through-Connection procedure to request the MGW to both-
way through-connect the bearer termination (bullet 4 and bullet 5 in figure
6.6).
##### 6.2.1.1.7 Confirmation of bearer establishment
If the IAM which was sent to the succeeding node indicated that the Continuity
message will follow, the Continuity message shall be sent when both of the
following conditions are satisfied:
1\. Either:
a. The incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, and a
Continuity message has been received from the preceding node (bullet 8 in
figure 6.6), or
b. The incoming IAM did not indicate that the Continuity message will follow;
2\. Either:
a. The GMSC server has selected an MGW, and a notification of successful
bearer establishment in the incoming side has been received from the MGW
(bullet 7 in figure 6.6), or
b. MGW selection is not required for this call.
##### 6.2.1.1.8 Voice Processing function
A voice processing function located on the MGW may be used to achieve desired
acoustic quality on the bearer terminations. The GMSC server shall request the
activation of the voice processing functions in the bearer terminations. For
non-speech calls, the GMSC server has the ability to instruct the MGW to
disable the voice processing functions (bullet 13 in figure 6.6). The voice
activation request from the GMSC server to MGWa may be issued as soon as
bullet 8 in figure 6.6, and may be issued as late as bullet 13 in figure 6.6
as illustrated.
##### 6.2.1.1.9 Failure handling in GMSC server
If any procedure between the GMSC server and the MGW has not completed
successfully or the GMSC server receives a Bearer Released procedure from the
MGW, the call shall be cleared as described in clause 7.3, (G)MSC server
initiated call clearing or in clause 7.4, MGW initiated call clearing.
Alternatively, the GMSC server may only release the resources in the MGW that
caused the failure, possibly select a new MGW for the bearer connection and
continue the call establishment using new resources in the selected MGW.
#### 6.2.1.2 MSC server
##### 6.2.1.2.1 Paging
If the network side bearer establishment is delayed whilst the paging
procedure is completed, the MSC server starts the Start_Bearer_Establishment
timer when the paging procedure is started. The Start_Bearer_Establishment
timer is stopped when the paging procedure is completed, or optionally when
the Call Confirmed message is received in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3].
If the Start_Bearer_Establishment timer expires, the MSC server starts the
network side bearer establishment.
##### 6.2.1.2.2 Call setup
The MSC server indicates to the UE in the SETUP message that early access
bearer assignment is used in order to establish the bearer end-to-end before
the UE starts alerting. The MSC server indicates to the UE in SETUP message
that early access bearer assignment is used if either of the following
conditions is satisfied before sending the SETUP message (bullet 2 in figure
6.6):
1\. The incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, but no
Continuity message has been received;
2\. A notification of successful bearer establishment in the network side has
not been received from the MGW.
##### 6.2.1.2.3 MGW selection
The MSC server shall select an MGW for the bearer connection before it
performs the network side bearer establishment or the access bearer
assignment. This happens at latest after the UE has sent the Call Confirmed
message. If the MSC server received an MGW-id from the preceding node, it may
use this for the MGW selection (bullet 3 in figure 6.6). For GSM, if
performing Service based handover (see 3GPP TS 48.008 [27]) the MSC Server may
omit MGW selection at this time.
##### 6.2.1.2.4 Network side bearer establishment
The MSC server requests the MGW to prepare for the network side bearer
establishment using the Prepare Bearer procedure. The MSC server requests the
MGW to provide a bearer address, a binding reference and to notify when the
bearer is established (bullet 3 in figure 6.6). The MSC server also provides
the MGW with the bearer characteristics that was received from the preceding
node in the IAM. After the MGW has replied with the bearer address and the
binding reference, the MSC server provides the Bearer Information message to
the preceding node. The MSC server may also provide the MGW-id in the Bearer
Information message.
##### 6.2.1.2.5 Access bearer assignment
The access bearer assignment shall be started only when both of the following
conditions are satisfied:
1\. Either:
a. The incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, and a
Continuity message has been received from the preceding node, or
b. The incoming IAM did not indicate that the Continuity message will follow;
2\. A notification of successful bearer establishment in the network side has
been received from the MGW (bullet 6 in figure 6.6).
The MSC server shall select bearer characteristics for the access bearer.
For the access bearer assignment in UMTS the MSC server requests the MGW to
prepare for the access bearer establishment using the Prepare Bearer
procedure. The MSC server requests the MGW to provide a bearer address and a
binding reference, provides the MGW with the bearer characteristics and
requests notification that the bearer can be modified. For speech calls, the
MSC server shall provide the MGW with the speech coding information and
conditionally GTT related information in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.226 [28]
for the bearer. For a non-speech call the MSC server also provides the MGW
with a PLMN Bearer Capability [4]. After the MGW has replied with the bearer
address and the binding reference the MSC server requests the access bearer
assignment using the provided bearer address and the binding reference (bullet
9 in figure 6.6) in accordance with 3GPP TS 25.413 [26]. The MSC shall only be
notified by the MGW using the Bearer Modification Support procedure if the
existing link characteristics of the access bearer can be modified at a later
stage, see subclause 13.18.1.
For GERAN Iu mode the MSC Server receives the GERAN capabilities within the
RANAP INITIAL UE MESSAGE, indicating the services (e.g. for CS speech services
the supported codec types and, for an adaptive codec type, the supported codec
modes (for definition see [27])), which will be available at the RAB
establishment procedure. The MSC server shall take the indicated GERAN
capabilities into account as well as the received MS capabilities when
negotiating a service. Additionally, when requesting the access bearer
assignment the MSC server shall indicate to the GERAN the selected service
(e.g. selected codec type). The MSC server shall not set codec information in
the NAS Synchronisation Indicator (see [4]). Instead it shall set codec
information in the GERAN BSC container.
For GSM, before the MSC server starts the access bearer assignment, the MSC
server uses the Reserve Circuit procedure to seize a TDM circuit. For a non-
speech call the MSC server also provides the MGW with a PLMN Bearer Capability
[4] and a GSM channel coding. After the MGW has replied the TDM circuit
seizure the MSC server requests access bearer assignment (bullet 10 in figure
6.6) in accordance with 3GPP TS 48.008 [27]. If performing Service based
handover (see 3GPP TS 48.008 [27]) the MSC Server may omit to perform Reserve
Circuit procedure.
##### 6.2.1.2.6 Framing protocol initialisation
In 3GPP CS CN speech and data shall be carried using the Iu/Nb User Plane
Protocol. The specification for the Iu UP protocol is defined in [20] and the
Nb UP Protocol in [7] and [21]. The Iu/Nb UP Protocol is established through
the CN in a forward direction. This is established independently of the bearer
establishment direction. The MGW derives the forward direction from
information sent by the MSC server within the Establish Bearer and Prepare
Bearer procedures [6]. The notification of bearer establishment shall not be
sent until the Nb UP has been initialised.
##### 6.2.1.2.7 Called party alerting
For a speech call, when the MSC server receives an Alerting message, it
requests the MGW to provide a ringing tone to the calling party using the Send
Tone procedure (bullet 11 in figure 6.6).
NOTE: Other kind of tones may be provided to the calling party at an earlier
stage of the call establishment.
##### 6.2.1.2.8 Called party answer
For a speech call, when the MSC server receives a Connect message, it requests
the MGW to stop providing the ringing tone to the calling party using the Stop
Tone procedure (bullet 12 in figure 6.6).
##### 6.2.1.2.9 Through-Connection
During the Prepare Bearer and Reserve Circuit procedures, the MSC server will
use the Change Through-Connection procedure to request the MGW to through-
connect the bearer terminations so that the bearer will be not
throughâ€‘connected (bullet 3, and bullet 9 or 10 in figure 6.6).
When the MSC server receives the Connect message, it requests the MGW to both-
way through-connect the bearer using the Change Through-Connection procedure
(bullet 12 in figure 6.6).
##### 6.2.1.2.10 Interworking function
The MGW may use an interworking function that is based on the PLMN Bearer
Capability [4] of the bearer termination. The activation of the possible
interworking function in both bearer terminations will be requested by the MSC
server at reception of the Connect message using the Activate Interworking
Function procedure (bullet 12 in figure 6.6).
##### 6.2.1.2.11 Codec handling
The MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each bearer termination.
##### 6.2.1.2.12 Voice Processing function
A voice processing function located on the MGW may be used to achieve desired
acoustic quality on the bearer terminations. The MSC server shall request the
activation of the voice processing functions in the bearer terminations. For
non-speech calls, the MSC server has the ability to instruct the MGW to
disable the voice processing functions (bullet 12 in figure 6.6).
##### 6.2.1.2.13 Failure handling in MSC server
If any procedure between the MSC server and the MGW is not completed
successfully, the call shall be cleared as described in clause 7.3, (G)MSC
server initiated call clearing. Alternatively, the MSC server may only release
the resources in the MGW that caused the failure, possibly select a new MGW
for the bearer connection and continue the call establishment using new
resources in the selected MGW.
##### 6.2.1.2.14 Example
Figure 6.5 shows the network model for the basic mobile terminating call. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling (not applicable in A/Gb mode for the
A-interface) and the bearer. The MSC server seizes one context with two bearer
terminations in MGWb. The bearer termination T1 is used for the bearer towards
the RNC/BSC and the bearer termination T2 is used for the bearer towards the
GMSC server selected MGWa. The GMSC server seizes one context with two bearer
terminations in MGWa. The bearer termination T3 is used for the bearer towards
the MSC server selected MGWb and the bearer termination T4 is used for the
bearer towards the preceding MGW.

Figure 6.5: Basic Mobile Terminating Call Forward Bearer Establishment\
(network model)
Figure 6.6 shows the message sequence example for the basic mobile terminating
call. In the example the GMSC server requests seizure of the outgoing side
bearer termination and establishment of the bearer when the Bearer Information
message is received from the MSC server. After the outgoing side bearer
termination is seized the GMSC server requests seizure of the incoming side
bearer termination. The MGW sends a notification of an established incoming
side bearer. The MSC server requests seizure of the network side bearer
termination when Call Confirmed message is received from the UE. The MGW sends
a notification of an established network side bearer. When the Continuity
message is received from the GMSC server, the MSC server requests seizure of
the access side bearer termination. For a speech call the MSC server requests
MGW to provide a ringing tone to the calling party at alerting. At answer the
MSC server requests MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer. For a speech
call the MSC server requests MGW to stop the ringing tone to the calling party
at answer. When the MSC server receives an answer indication, it shall request
the possible activation of the interworking function in both bearer
terminations. The (G)MSC server shall request the possible activation of the
voice processing functions for the bearer terminations.

message that early access bearer assignment is used, if and only if, either of
the following conditions are satisfied before sending the SETUP message
(bullet 5 in figure 6.8):
  1. If the IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, but no Continuity message has been received.
  2. A notification of successful bearer establishment in the network side has not been received from the MGW.
##### 6.2.2.2.3 MGW selection
The MSC server shall select an MGW for the bearer connection before it
performs the network side bearer establishment or the access bearer
assignment. This happens at latest after the UE has sent the Call Confirmed
message. If the MSC server received an MGW-id from the preceding node, it may
use this for the MGW selection (bullet 6 in figure 6.8). For GSM, if
performing Service based handover (see 3GPP TS 48.008 [27]) the MSC Server may
omit MGW selection at this time.
##### 6.2.2.2.3 Network side bearer establishment
The MSC server requests the MGW to establish a bearer to the given destination
MGW and to notify when the bearer is established using the Establish Bearer
procedure. The MSC server provides the MGW with the bearer address, the
binding reference and the bearer characteristics that were received from the
preceding node in the IAM (bullet 6 in figure 6.8).
##### 6.2.2.2.4 Access bearer assignment
The access bearer assignment shall be started only when both of the following
conditions are satisfied:
  1. Either:
```{=html}
``` a. The incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, and
a Continuity message has been received from the preceding node, or
b. The incoming IAM did not indicate that the Continuity message will follow;
```{=html}
``` 2\. A notification of successful bearer establishment in the network side
has been received from the MGW (bullet 7 in figure 6.8).
The MSC server shall select bearer characteristics for the access bearer.
For the access bearer assignment in UTRAN the MSC server requests the MGW to
prepare for the access bearer establishment using the Prepare Bearer
procedure. The MSC server requests the MGW to provide a bearer address and a
binding reference, provides the MGW with the bearer characteristics and
requests notification that the bearer can be modified. For speech calls, the
MSC server shall provide the MGW with the speech coding information and
conditionally GTT related information in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.226 [28]
for the bearer. For a non-speech call the MSC server also provides the MGW
with a PLMN Bearer Capability [4]. After the MGW has replied with the bearer
address and the binding reference the MSC server requests the access bearer
assignment using the provided bearer address and the binding reference (bullet
8 in figure 6.8) in accordance with 3GPP TS 25.413 [26]. The MSC shall only be
notified by the MGW using the Bearer Modification Support procedure if the
existing link characteristics of the access bearer can be modified at a later
stage, see subclause 13.18.1.
For GERAN Iu mode the MSC Server receives the GERAN capabilities within the
RANAP INITIAL UE MESSAGE, indicating the services (e.g. for CS speech services
the supported codec types and, for an adaptive codec type, the supported codec
modes (for definition see [27])), which will be available at the RAB
establishment procedure. The MSC server shall take the indicated GERAN
capabilities into account as well as the received MS capabilities when
negotiating a service. Additionally, when requesting the access bearer
assignment the MSC server shall indicate to the GERAN the selected service
(e.g. selected codec type). The MSC server shall not set codec information in
the NAS Synchronisation Indicator (see [4]). Instead it shall set codec
information in the GERAN BSC container..
For GSM, before the MSC server starts the access bearer assignment, the MSC
server uses the Reserve Circuit procedure to seize a TDM circuit. For a non-
speech call the MSC server also provides the MGW with a PLMN Bearer Capability
[4] and a GSM channel coding. After the MGW has replied the TDM circuit
seizure the MSC server requests access bearer assignment (bullet 9 in figure
6.8) in accordance with 3GPP TS 48.008 [27]. If performing Service based
handover (see 3GPP TS 48.008 [27]) the MSC Server may omit to perform Reserve
Circuit procedure.
##### 6.2.2.2.5 Framing protocol initialisation
In 3GPP CS CN speech and data shall be carried using the Iu/Nb User Plane
Protocol. The specification for the Iu UP protocol is defined in [20] and the
Nb UP Protocol in [7] and [21]. The Iu/Nb UP Protocol is established through
the CN in a forward direction. This is established independently of the bearer
establishment direction. The MGW derives the forward direction from
information sent by the MSC server within the Establish Bearer and Prepare
Bearer procedures [6]. The notification of bearer establishment shall not be
sent until the Nb UP has been initialised.
##### 6.2.2.2.6 Called party alerting
For a speech call, when the MSC server receives an Alerting message, it
requests the MGW to provide a ringing tone to the calling party using the Send
Tone procedure (bullet 10 in figure 6.8).
NOTE: Other kind of tones may be provided to the calling party at an earlier
stage of the call establishment.
##### 6.2.2.2.7 Called party answer
For a speech call, when the MSC server receives a Connect message, it requests
the MGW to stop providing the ringing tone to the calling party using the Stop
Tone procedure (bullet 11 in figure 6.8).
##### 6.2.2.2.8 Through-Connection
During any one of the Prepare Bearer, Reserve Circuit and Establish Bearer
procedures, the MSC server will use the Change Through-Connection procedure to
request the MGW to through-connect the bearer terminations so that the bearer
will be not through-connected (bullet 6, and bullet 8 or 9 in figure 6.8).
When the MSC server receives the Connect message, it requests the MGW to both-
way through-connect the bearer using the Change Through-Connection procedure
(bullet 11 in figure 6.8).
##### 6.2.2.2.9 Interworking function
The MGW may use an interworking function that is based on the PLMN Bearer
Capability [4] of the bearer termination. The activation of the possible
interworking function in both bearer terminations will be requested by the MSC
server at reception of the Connect message using the Activate Interworking
Function procedure (bullet 11 in figure 6.8).
##### 6.2.2.2.10 Codec handling
The MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each bearer termination.
##### 6.2.2.2.11 Voice Processing function
A voice processing function located on the MGW may be used to achieve desired
acoustic quality on the bearer terminations. The MSC server shall request the
activation of the voice processing functions in the bearer terminations. For
non-speech calls, the MSC server has the ability to instruct the MGW to
disable the voice processing functions (bullet 11 in figure 6.8).
##### 6.2.2.2.12 Failure handling in MSC server
If any procedure between the MSC server and the MGW is not completed
successfully or the MSC server receives a Bearer Released procedure from the
MGW, the call shall be cleared as described in clause 7.3, (G)MSC server
initiated call clearing or in clause 7.4, MGW initiated call clearing.
Alternatively, the MSC server may only release the resources in the MGW that
caused the failure, possibly select a new MGW for the bearer connection and
continue the call establishment using new resources in the selected MGW.
##### 6.2.2.2.13 Example
Figure 6.7 shows the network model for the basic mobile terminating call. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling (not applicable in A/Gb mode for the
A-interface) and the bearer. The MSC server seizes one context with two bearer
terminations in MGWb. The bearer termination T1 is used for the bearer towards
the RNC/BSC and the bearer termination T2 is used for the bearer towards the
GMSC server selected MGWa. The GMSC server seizes one context with two bearer
terminations in MGWa. The bearer termination T3 is used for the bearer towards
the MSC server selected MGWb and the bearer termination T4 is used for the
bearer towards the preceding MGW.

Figure 6.7: Basic Mobile Terminating Call, Backward Bearer Establishment\
(network model)
Figure 6.8 shows the message sequence example for the basic mobile terminating
call. In the example the GMSC server requests seizure of the incoming side
bearer termination and establishment of the bearer first. After a notification
of incoming side bearer establishment has been received from the MGW, the GMSC
server requests seizure of the outgoing side bearer termination. The MSC
server requests seizure of the network side bearer termination and
establishment of the bearer when the Call Confirmed message is received from
the UE. After a notification of the network side bearer establishment has been
received from the MGW the MSC server requests seizure of the access side
bearer termination. For a speech call, When the MSC server receives an
alerting message, it requests MGW to provide a ringing tone to the calling
party. When the MSC server receives an answer indication, it requests MGW to
both-way through-connect the bearer. For a speech, when the MSC server
receives an answer indication, it requests MGW to stop the ringing tone to the
calling party and requests the possible activation of the interworking
function in both bearer terminations. The (G)MSC server shall request the
possible activation of the voice processing functions for the bearer
terminations.

### 6.2.3 Terminating Call Establishment For Iu Interface on IP
If IuCS on IP is supported by the MSC server, the Core Network side procedures
described in 6.2.1 or 6.2.2 shall apply. For the access bearer termination,
the exchange of IP addresses via call control procedures is described in this
clause.
Before the MSC server starts the access bearer assignment, the MSC server
requests the MGW to prepare for the access bearer using the
Prepare_IP_Transport procedure. The MSC server requests the MGW to provide an
IP Transport Address and UDP Port and provides the MGW with the bearer
characteristics. For speech calls, the MSC server shall provide the MGW with
the speech coding information and conditionally GTT related information in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.226 [28]. For a non-speech call the MSC server also
provides the MGW with a PLMN Bearer Capability [4]. After the MGW has replied
with the IP address and UDP Port the MSC server requests access bearer
assignment using the provided IP address and UDP Port in accordance with 3GPP
TS 25.413 [26]. The IP addresses and UDP Ports of the MGW and the RNC are
exchanged via the RANAP procedures. If the bearer transport is IP and IuUP
mode is Transparent, when the MSC receives the RANAP RAB assignment response
it shall send the RNC IP address and UDP Port to the MGW Access bearer
termination using the Modify_IP_Transport_Address procedure.
If the bearer transport is IP and IuUP mode is Support, the MGW shall use the
source IP address and UDP Port of the IuUP Init packet received from the radio
access network as the destination address for subsequent downlink packets.
The sequence is shown in figure 6.2.3/1.
Figure 6.2.3/1 Terminating Call Establishment For Iu Interface on IP
### 6.2.4 Terminating Call Establishment For A Interface over IP
If AoIP is supported by the MSC server, the Core Network side procedures
described in 6.2.1 or 6.2.2 shall apply. For the access side termination, the
exchange of IP addresses via call control procedures is described in this
clause.
Before the MSC server sends the Assignment Request to the BSC, the MSC server
requests the MGW to reserve an RTP bearer termination using the Reserve RTP
Connection Point procedure. The MSC server requests the MGW to reserve an IP
Address and UDP Port and also may indicate that the IP interface type is for A
interface over IP. The MGW reserves the AoIP termination and indicates the IP
address and UDP port number to the MSC server. MSC server then requests access
bearer assignment using the provided IP address and UDP Port. When MSC server
receives the BSSMAP ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE message, it shall send the BSC IP
address and UDP Port to the MGW Access bearer termination using the Configure
RTP Connection Point procedure.
The sequence is shown in figure 6.2.3/1.

# 7 Call Clearing
NOTE: All message sequence charts in this clause are examples. All valid call
establishment message sequences can be derived from the example message
sequences and associated message pre-conditions.
## 7.1 Network Initiated
The terms \"incoming\" and \"outgoing\" in the following text refers to the
direction of propagation of the Release message, not to the direction of
establishing the original call.
### 7.1.1 GMSC server
#### 7.1.1.1 Call clearing from the incoming side
Once the Release message has been received from the preceding node, the GMSC
server releases any MGW allocated resources for the incoming side. If any
resources were seized in the MGW, the GMSC server shall use the Release Bearer
and Release Termination procedures to indicate to the MGW to remove the
incoming side bearer termination and that the bearer can be released towards
the preceding MGW. After the resources in the MGW are released the GMSC server
sends the Release Complete message to the preceding node.
#### 7.1.1.2 Call clearing to the outgoing side
The GMSC server sends the Release message to the succeeding node. Once the
succeeding node has sent the Release Complete message, the GMSC server
releases any MGW allocated resources for the outgoing side. If any resources
were seized in the MGW, the GMSC server shall use the Release Bearer and
Release Termination procedures to indicate to the MGW to remove the outgoing
side bearer termination and that the bearer can be released towards the
succeeding MGW.
### 7.1.2 MSC server
The network initiated call clearing shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP
TS 23.108 [18]. The following clauses describe the additional requirements for
the bearer independent CS core network.
#### 7.1.2.1 Call clearing from the network side
Once the Release message has been received from the preceding/succeeding node,
the MSC server releases any MGW allocated resources for the network side. If
any resources were seized in the MGW, the MSC server shall use the Release
Bearer and Release Termination procedures to indicate to the MGW to remove the
network side bearer termination and that the bearer can be released towards
the preceding/succeeding MGW. After the resources in the MGW are released the
MSC server sends the Release Complete message to the preceding/succeeding node
(bullet 1 in figure 7.2).
#### 7.1.2.2 Call clearing to the UE
The MSC server initiates call clearing towards the UE and requests release of
the associated radio resources as described in 3GPP TS 23.108[18]. Once the
call clearing and the release of the associated radio resources have been
completed, the MSC server releases any MGW allocated resources for the access
side. If any resources were seized in the MGW, the MSC server uses the Release
Termination procedure to requests the MGW to remove the access side bearer
termination (bullet 2 or bullet 3 in figure 7.2).
#### 7.1.2.3 Example
Figure 7.1 shows the network model for a network initiated clearing of the
mobile call. The \"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The
\"dotted\" line represents the bearer control signalling (not applicable in
A/Gb mode for the A-interface) and the bearer. The MSC server seizes one
context with two bearer terminations in the MGW. Bearer termination T1 is used
for the bearer towards RNC/BSC and bearer termination T2 is used for the
bearer towards succeeding MGW.

## 7.2 User Initiated
The user initiated call clearing shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.108 [18]. The following clauses describe the additional requirements for
the bearer independent CS core network.
### 7.2.1 Void
### 7.2.2 MSC server
#### 7.2.2.1 all clearing from the UE
The UE initiated call clearing is performed and the release of the associated
radio resources is performed as described in 3GPP TS 23.108 [18]. Once the
call clearing and the associated radio resources release have been completed,
the MSC server releases any MGW allocated resources for the access side. If
any resources were seized in the MGW the MSC server uses the Release
Termination procedure to requests the MGW to remove the access side bearer
termination (bullet 1 or bullet 2 in figure 7.4).
#### 7.2.2.2 Call clearing to the network side
The MSC server sends the Release message to the preceding/succeeding node.
Once the preceding/succeeding node has sent the Release Complete, the MSC
server releases any MGW allocated resources for the network side. If any
resources were seized in the MGW server shall use the Release Bearer and
Release Termination procedures to indicate to the MGW to remove the network
side bearer termination and that the bearer can be released towards the
preceding/succeeding MGW (bullet 3 in figure 7.4).
#### 7.2.2.3 Example

## 7.4 MGW Initiated
The following clauses describe the additional requirements for MGW initiated
call clearing in the bearer independent CS core network.
### 7.4.1 GMSC server
#### 7.4.1.1 Bearer released on the destination side
After the GMSC server has received the Bearer Released procedure from the MGW,
it shall send the Release message to the succeeding node. Once the succeeding
node has sent the Release Complete message, the GMSC server releases any MGW
allocated resources for the destination side. The GMSC server uses the Release
Termination procedure to request the MGW to remove the destination side bearer
termination.
The call clearing to the incoming side is performed as described in clause
7.1.1.2, call clearing to the outgoing side.
#### 7.4.1.2 Bearer released on the originating side
After the GMSC server has received the Bearer Released procedure from the MGW,
the GMSC server sends the Release message to the preceding node. Once the
preceding node has sent the Release Complete message, the GMSC server releases
any MGW allocated resources for the originating side. The GMSC server uses the
Release Termination procedure to request the MGW to remove the originating
side bearer termination.
If the call is already established towards the destination side, call clearing
to the destination side is performed as described in clause 7.1.1.2, call
clearing to the outgoing side.
### 7.4.2 MSC server
#### 7.4.2.1 Bearer released on the access side
After the MSC server has received the Bearer Released procedure from the MGW,
the MSC server initiates the call clearing towards the UE and requests release
of the allocated radio resources as described in 3GPP TS 23.108 [18]. Once the
call clearing and the radio resources release have been completed, the MSC
server releases any MGW allocated resources for the access side. The MSC
server uses the Release Termination procedure to request the MGW to remove the
access side bearer termination.
If the call is already established towards the network side, call clearing to
the network side is performed as described in clause 7.2, call clearing to the
network side.
#### 7.4.2.2 Bearer released on the network side
After the MSC server has received the Bearer Released procedure from the MGW,
the MSC server sends the Release message to the preceding/succeeding node.
Once the preceding/succeeding node has sent the Release Complete message, the
MSC server releases any MGW allocated resources for the network side. The MSC
server uses the Release Termination procedure to request the MGW to remove the
network side bearer termination (bullet 1 and bullet 2 in figure 7.8).
Call clearing to the UE is performed as described in clause 7.1.2.2, call
clearing to the UE (bullet 3 in figure 7.8).

## 7.5 Call Clearing for Iu Interface on IP
Procedures for Call Clearing where the Iu Interface is on IP are as described
in sections 7.1 to 7.4, with the exception that only the Access side
procedures apply and the Release Bearer procedure is not sent. For Iu
Interface on IP, the Release Termination procedures for IP are used to clear
the MGW termination from the (G)MSC.
##### Example {#example-9 .H6}
Figure 7.9 shows the network model for a network initiated clearing of the
mobile call when IP transport is used on the Iu interface. The \'squared\'
line represents the call control signalling. The \'dotted\' line represents
the bearer. The MSC server releases one context with two bearer terminations
in the MGW. Bearer termination T1 is used for the bearer towards RNC/BSC and
bearer termination T2 is used for the bearer towards succeeding MGW.
Figure 7.9 Network Initiated Call Clearing (Network model)
Figure 7.10 shows the message sequence example for the network initiated
clearing of a mobile call when IP transport is used on the Iu Interface. In
the example when the call clearing indication is received from the
preceding/succeeding node, MSC server indicates that network bearer can be
released and to release the network side bearer termination. After the release
of the network side bearer termination the MSC server indicates to the
preceding/succeeding node that call clearing has been completed. The MSC
server initiates call clearing towards the UE and requests release of the
radio resource. After the response of the radio resource release is received
then the MSC server requests release of the access side bearer termination.

# 8 Handover/Relocation
NOTE: All message sequence charts in this clause are examples. All valid
handover/relocation message sequences can be derived from the example message
sequences and associated message pre-conditions.
## 8.1 UMTS to UMTS
In the context of the following clauses, the terms RNS or RNC refer also to a
GERAN BSS or BSC (respectively) when serving an UE in Iu mode.
### 8.1.1 Intra-MSC SRNS/SBSS Relocation
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.009 [8] for \"Intra-3G_MSC SRNS
Relocation\" shall be followed. The following clauses describe the additional
requirements for the bearer independent CS core network.
#### 8.1.1.1 Relocation Required
When the Relocation Required message is received, the MSC server requests the
MGW to provide a binding reference and a bearer address, using the Prepare
Bearer procedure. For speech calls, the MSC server shall provide the MGW with
the speech coding information for the bearer. For non-speech calls the MSC
server also provides the MGW with the same PLMN Bearer Capability [4] as was
provided at the last access bearer assignment. The MSC server uses the Change
Flow Direction Procedure to request the MGW to set the Handover Device to
initial state. The MSC server sends the Relocation Request message, containing
the bearer address and the binding reference, to RNC-B (bullet 1 in figure
8.2/1).
For Relocation towards GERAN Iu mode the GERAN capabilities of the target cell
will be indicated to the MSC-Server within the RANAP RELOCATION REQUIRED
message if the target cell provides different capabilities than the current
cell. If no information about the GERAN capabilities of the target cell are
received within this message, the MSC-Server shall assume that the GERAN
target cell will provide the same capabilities as the current cell (for
details see [29]). The MSC server shall indicate to GERAN the selected
services within the RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message. The MSC server shall not
set codec information in the NAS Synchronisation Indicator (see [4]). Instead
it shall set codec information in the GERAN BSC container.
#### 8.1.1.2 Relocation Command/Relocation Detect
When the MSC server sends the Relocation Command message or alternatively if
it receives the Relocation Detect message, the MSC server uses the Change Flow
Direction procedure to request the MGW to set the Handover Device to
intermediate state (bullet 2 in figure 8.2/1).
#### 8.1.1.3 Relocation Complete
When the MSC server receives the Relocation Complete message, it requests
RNC-A to release the IU. The MSC server also requests the MGW to set the
Handover Device to its final state by removing the bearer termination towards
RNCâ€‘A, using the Release Termination procedure (bullet 3 in figure 8.2/2).
#### 8.1.1.4 Interworking function
The interworking function used by the MGW before relocation will also be used
after relocation.
#### 8.1.1.5 Codec handling
The MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each bearer termination.
#### 8.1.1.6 Voice Processing function
After relocation, the MGW may continue or modify voice-processing function(s)
provided to each bearer termination.
#### 8.1.1.7 Handling of multiple bearers (multicall)
If the UE is engaged with multiple bearers all procedures related to the
handling of bearers and terminations described for the relocation of a single
bearer shall be repeated for each bearer.
#### 8.1.1.8 Failure Handling in MSC server
When a procedure between the MSC server and the MGW fails the MSC server shall
handle the failure as an internal error in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.009 [8]
and 3GPP TS 29.010 [23]. If MGW resources have been already seized at the
target access side then the resources shall be released using the Release
Termination procedure. If the call is to be cleared, then it shall be handled
as described in clause 7.3.
#### 8.1.1.9 Example
Figure 8.1 shows the network model for the Intra-MSC SRNS Relocation. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. The bearer
termination T1 is used for the bearer towards RNC-A, bearer termination T3 is
used for the bearer towards RNC-B and the bearer termination T2 is used for
the bearer towards the succeeding/preceding MGW.

Figure 8.2 shows the message sequence example for the Intra-MSC SRNS
Relocation.\ It is assumed that the Handover Device is located in the MGW,
which has been selected for the call establishment by the MSC server. The MSC
server controls the call and the mobility management. It is also assumed that
only one bearer has been established towards RNC-A.**[\ ]{.underline}** In the
example the MSC server requests seizure of RNC-B side bearer termination with
specific flow directions. The MSC server orders the establishment of the
bearer by sending Relocation Request towards RNC-B. When the relocation is
detected in RNC-B the MSC server requests to change the flow directions
between the terminations within the context. When the MSC server receives a
Relocation Complete indication from RNC-B it orders RNC-A to release the IU.
This action causes release of the bearer between the RNC and the MGW. Finally
the MSC server requests the MGW to release RNC-A side bearer termination.

Procedure Requiring a Circuit Connection between 3G_MSCâ€‘A and 3G_MSCâ€‘B\" shall
be followed. The following clauses describe the additional requirements for
the bearer independent CS core network.
#### 8.1.2.1 MSC-A/MGW-A
##### 8.1.2.1.1 Relocation Required
For Relocation towards GERAN Iu mode the GERAN capabilities of the target cell
will be indicated to the MSC-A server within the RANAP RELOCATION REQUIRED
message if the target cell provides different capabilities than the current
cell. If no information about the GERAN capabilities of the target cell are
received within this message, the MSC-A server shall assume that the GERAN
target cell will provide the same capabilities as the current cell (for
details see [29]).
The MSC-A server shall indicate to the MSC-B server the GERAN capabilities of
the target cell, if available, with the MAP Prepare Handover request. For
speech calls, the MSC-A server shall additionally indicate to the MSC-B server
the selected codec, the list of supported codecs, and the currently used
codec.
Furthermore, the MSC-A server shall indicate to the GERAN the selected service
within the RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message and shall set the RAB parameters
within the RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message according to the selected service.
The MSC server shall not set codec information in the NAS Synchronisation
Indicator (see [4]). Instead it shall set codec information in the GERAN BSC
container..
##### 8.1.2.1.2 Bearer establishment between MGW-A and MGW-B
The handling of the bearer establishment is as described for a Basic Mobile
Originating Call, using either forward or backward bearer establishment. For
speech calls, the MSC-A server shall provide the MGW-A with the speech coding
information for the bearer. For non-speech calls, the MSC-A server shall
provide MGW-A with the same PLMN Bearer Capability [4] as was provided at the
last access bearer assignment. The MSC-A server also uses the Change Flow
Direction procedure to request MGW-A to set the Handover Device to initial
state (bullet 3 in figure 8.4/1).
##### 8.1.2.1.3 Relocation Command/Relocation Detect
When the MSC-A server sends the Relocation Command message or alternatively if
it receives the Relocation Detect message, the MSC-A server uses the Change
Flow Direction procedure to requests MGW-A to set the Handover Device to
intermediate state (bullet 4 in figure 8.4/2).
##### 8.1.2.1.4 Relocation Complete
When the MSC-A server receives the Relocation Complete message, it requests
RNC-A to release the IU. The MSC-A server also requests MGW-A to set the
Handover Device to its final state by removing the bearer termination towards
RNC-A, using the Release Termination procedure (bullet 5 in figure 8.4/2).
##### 8.1.2.1.5 Interworking function
The interworking function used by MGW-A before relocation will also be used
after relocation.
##### 8.1.2.1.6 Codec handling
The MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each bearer termination.
##### 8.1.2.1.7 Voice Processing function
Voice processing function(s) provided by MGW-A before relocation, may be
modified or disabled by MGW-A after relocation.
##### 8.1.2.1.8 Handling of multiple bearers (multicall)
If the UE is engaged with multiple bearers all procedures related to the
handling of bearers and terminations described for the relocation of a single
bearer shall be repeated for each bearer.
##### 8.1.2.1.9 Failure Handling in MSC server
When a procedure between the MSC-A server and MGW-A fails the MSC-A server
shall handle the failure as an internal error in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.009 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.010 [23]. If call establishment towards MSC-B has
already started then the call towards MSC-B server shall be cleared as
described in clause 7.3. If the original call is to be cleared, then it shall
be handled as described in clause 7.3.
#### 8.1.2.2 MSC-B/MGW-B
##### 8.1.2.2.1 MGW selection
The MSC-B server selects an MGW when it receives Prepare Handover Request
message (bullet 1 in figure 8.4/1).
##### 8.1.2.2.2 Bearer establishment towards RNC-B
When the MSC-B server has selected MGW-B it requests MGW-B to provide a
binding reference and a bearer address, using the Prepare Bearer procedure.
For speech calls, the MSC-B server shall provide the MGW-B with the speech
coding information for the bearer. The MSC-B server sends the Relocation
Request message to the RNC-B containing the bearer addresses and binding
references (bullet 2 in figure 8.4/1).
For Relocation towards GERAN Iu mode, if the selected service is speech and
the MSC-B server cannot provide the codec requested by the MSC-A server, the
MSC-B server shall select another codec according to the received GERAN
capabilities of the target cell and the received list of supported codecs, and
shall set the RAB parameters within the RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message
according to the new selected codec. Furthermore, the MSC-B server shall
report the chosen codec and codec modes back to the MSC-A server with MAP
Prepare Handover response.
##### 8.1.2.2.3 Bearer establishment between MGW-A and MGW-B
The handling of the bearer establishment is as described at Basic Mobile
Terminating Call, using either forward or backward bearer establishment.

continued or modified by MGW-B after relocation.
##### 8.1.2.2.6 Handling of multiple bearers (multicall)
If the UE is engaged with multiple bearers all procedures related to the
handling of bearers and terminations described for the relocation of a single
bearer shall be repeated for each bearer.
##### 8.1.2.2.7 Failure Handling in MSC server
When a procedure between the MSC-B server and MGW-B fails the MSC-B server
shall handle the failure as an internal error in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.009 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.010 [23]. If MGW-B resources have been already
seized at the target access side then the resources shall be released using
the Release Termination procedure. The call from MSC-A server shall be
released as described at clause 7.1.
##### 8.1.2.2.8 Example
Figure 8.3 shows the network model for the Basic Inter-MSC SRNS Relocation.
The \"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\"
line represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. In MGW-A the
bearer termination T1 is used for the bearer towards RNC-A, bearer termination
T3 is used for the bearer towards MGW-B, and the bearer termination T2 is used
for the bearer towards the succeeding/preceding MGW. In MGW-B the bearer
termination T4 is used for the bearer towards RNC-B, bearer termination T5 is
used for the bearer towards MGW-A.

Figure 8.4 shows the message sequence example for the Basic Inter-MSC SRNS
Relocation. It is assumed that the Handover Device is located in the MGW
(MGW-A) selected for the call establishment by the MSC server (MSC-A server)
which controls the call and the mobility management. It is also assumed that
only one bearer has been established towards RNC-A. In the example the MSC-B
server requests MGW-B to seize an RNC-B side bearer. The MSC-B server orders
the establishment of the bearer towards RNC-B by sending Relocation Request.
The call is established between MSC-A and MSC-B servers, and the bearer is
established between MGW-A and MGW-B. When the relocation is detected in RNC-B
the MSC-A server requests to change the flow directions between the
terminations within the context in MGW-A. When MSC-A server receives
Relocation Complete indication from MSC-B server it orders RNC-A to release
the IU. This action causes release of the bearer between RNC-A and MGW-A.
Finally MSC-A server requests MGW-A to remove RNC-A side bearer termination.

### 8.1.3 Subsequent Inter-MSC SRNS/SBSS Relocation back to the Anchor MSC
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.009 [8] for \"Subsequent Relocation
from 3G_MSCâ€‘B to 3G_MSCâ€‘A requiring a Circuit Connection between 3G_MSCâ€‘A and
3G_MSCâ€‘B\" shall be followed. The following clauses describe the additional
requirements for the bearer independent CS core network.
#### 8.1.3.1 MSC-A/MGW-A
##### 8.1.3.1.1 Relocation Request
When the MSC-A server receives the MAP Prepare Subsequent Handover request
containing a Relocation Request message, it requests MGW-A to provide a
binding reference and a bearer address using the Prepare Bearer procedure. For
speech calls, the MSC-A server shall provide the MGW-A with the speech coding
information for the bearer. For non-speech calls the MSC-A server shall
provide MGW-A with the same PLMN Bearer Capability [4] as was provided at the
last access bearer assignment. The MSC-A server uses the Change Flow Direction
procedure to request the MGW-A to set the Handover Device to initial state.
The MSC-A server sends the Relocation Request message, containing the bearer
address and the binding reference, to RNC-B (bullet 1 in figure 8.6/1).
For Relocation towards GERAN Iu mode, if the selected service is speech and
the MSC-A server cannot provide the codec requested by the MSC-B server, the
MSC-A server shall select another codec according to the received GERAN
capabilities of the target cell and the list of supported codecs.
##### 8.1.3.1.2 Relocation Command/Relocation Detect
When the MSC-A server sends the MAP Prepare Subsequent Handover response
message or alternatively if it receives the Relocation Detect message, the
MSC-A server uses the Change Flow Direction procedure to requests MGW-A to set
the Handover Device to intermediate state (bullet 2 in figure 8.6/1).
##### 8.1.3.1.3 Relocation Complete
When the MSC-A server receives the Relocation Complete message, it informs the
MSC-B server about reception of this message. The MSC-A server then initiates
call clearing towards the MSC-B server as described in clause 7.3.
##### 8.1.3.1.4 Interworking function
The interworking function used by MGW-A before relocation will also be used
after relocation.
##### 8.1.3.1.5 Codec handling
The MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each bearer termination.
##### 8.1.3.1.6 Voice Processing function
Voice processing function(s) provided by MGW-A and MGW-B before relocation,
may be continued or modified by MGW-A after relocation.
##### 8.1.3.1.7 Handling of multiple bearers (multicall)
If the UE is engaged with multiple bearers all procedures related to the
handling of bearers and terminations described for the relocation of a single
bearer shall be repeated for each bearer.
##### 8.1.3.1.8 Failure Handling in MSC server
When a procedure between the MSC-A server and the MGW fails the MSC-A server
shall handle the failure as an internal error in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.009 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.010 [23]. If MGW resources have already been seized
at the target access side then the resources shall be released using the
Release Termination procedure. If the call is to be cleared, then it shall be
handled as described in clause 7.3.
#### 8.1.3.2 MSC-B/MGW-B
##### 8.1.3.2.1 Relocation Required
For Relocation towards GERAN Iu mode the GERAN capabilities of the target cell
will be indicated to the MSC-B server within the RANAP RELOCATION REQUIRED
message if the target cell provides different capabilities than the current
cell. If no information about the GERAN capabilities of the target cell are
received within this message, the MSC-B server shall assume that the GERAN
target cell will provide the same capabilities as the current cell (for
details see [29]). The different interworking scenarios (e.g. interworking to
pre-Rel5 UTRAN) are described in [29].
The MSC-B server shall indicate to the MSC-A server the GERAN capabilities of
the target cell, if available, with the MAP Prepare Subsequent Handover
request. For speech calls, the MSC-B server shall additionally indicate to the
MSC-A server the selected codec and the currently used codec.
Furthermore, the MSC-B server shall indicate to the GERAN the selected service
within the RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message and shall set the RAB parameters
within the RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message according to the selected service.
The MSC server shall not set codec information in the NAS Synchronisation
Indicator (see [4]). Instead it shall set codec information in the GERAN BSC
container...
##### 8.1.3.2.2 Relocation Complete
When the MSC-B server receives the Relocation Complete message, it requests
RNC-A to release the IU. The MSC-B server requests MGW-B to remove the bearer
termination towards RNC-A using the Release Termination procedure (bullet 3 in
figure 8.6/2).
##### 8.1.3.2.3 Release of bearer towards MGW-A
When the MSC-B server receives a call clearing indication from the MSC-A
server, the MSC-B server handles it as described in clause 7.2.
##### 8.1.3.2.4 Handling of multiple bearers (multicall)
If the UE is engaged with multiple bearers all procedures related to the
handling of bearers and terminations described for the relocation of a single
bearer shall be repeated for each bearer.
##### 8.1.3.2.5 Example
Figure 8.5 shows the network model for the Subsequent Inter-MSC SRNS
Relocation back to the Anchor MSC. The \"squared\" line represents the call
control signalling. The \"dotted\" line represents the bearer control
signalling and the bearer. In MGW-A the bearer termination T6 is used for the
bearer towards RNC-B, bearer termination T3 is used for the bearer towards
MGW-B, and the bearer termination T2 is used for the bearer towards the
succeeding/preceding MGW. In MGW-B the bearer termination T4 is used for the
bearer towards RNC-A, bearer termination T5 is used for the bearer towards
MGW-A.

is located in the MGW (MGW-A) selected for the call establishment by the MSC
server (MSC-A server) which controls the call and the mobility management.
Also assumed that only one bearer has been established towards RNC-A. In the
example the MSC-A server requests MGW-A to seize RNC-B side bearer termination
with specific flow directions. The MSC server orders the establishment of the
bearer towards RNC-B by sending Relocation Request. When the relocation is
detected in RNC-B the MSC-A server requests to change the flow directions
between the terminations within the context in MGW-A. When the MSC-A server
receives a Relocation Complete indication from RNC-B it transfers this
indication to MSC-B server. MSC-B server orders RNC-A to release the IU. This
action causes release of the bearer between RNC-A and the MGW-B. MSC-A server
initiates call clearing towards MSC-B server.

(message sequence chart)
### 8.1.4 Subsequent Inter-MSC SRNS/SBSS Relocation to a third MSC
The relocation to a third MSC server (from MSC-B server to MSCâ€‘B server) is
the combination of the two previous inter-MSC handover cases:
\- for MSC-B server a subsequent relocation from MSC-B server back to MSC-A
server as described in clause 8.1.3; and
\- for MSC-B server a basic relocation from MSC-A server to MSCâ€‘B server as
described in clause 8.1.2.
MSC-A server implements the corresponding parts of each handover case; i.e.
access handling in MSC-A server is not included.
### 8.1.5 SRNS/SBSS Relocation with Iu on IP
If IuCS on IP is supported by the MSC server, the Core Network side procedures
described in 8.1.1, 8.1.2, 8.1.3 and 8.1.4 shall apply. For the access bearer
termination, the exchange of IP addresses via call control procedures is
described in this clause.
Before the MSC server starts the access bearer assignment, the MSC server
requests the MGW to prepare for the access bearer using the
Prepare_IP_Transport procedure. The MSC server requests the MGW to provide an
IP Transport address and UDP Port and provides the MGW with the bearer
characteristics. For speech calls, the MSC server shall provide the MGW with
the speech coding information and conditionally GTT related information in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.226 [28] for the bearer. For a non-speech call the
MSC server also provides the MGW with a PLMN Bearer Capability [4]. After the
MGW has replied with the IP address and UDP Port the MSC server requests
access bearer assignment using the provided IP address and UDP Port in
accordance with 3GPP TS 25.413 [26]. The IP addresses and UDP Ports of the MGW
and the RNC are exchanged via the RANAP procedures. If the bearer transport is
IP and IuUP mode is Transparent, when the MSC receives the RANAP Iu Relocation
Request response, it shall send the RNC IP address and UDP Port to the MGW
Access bearer termination using the Modify_IP_Transport_Address procedure.
If the bearer transport is IP and IuUP mode is Support, the MGW shall use the
source IP address and UDP Port of the IuUP Init packet received from the radio
access network as the destination address for subsequent downlink packets.
The sequence is shown in figure 8.1.5/1.
Figure 8.1.5/1 SRNS Relocation with Iu on IP
### 8.1.6 Intra-MSC enhanced SRNS Relocation
#### 8.1.6.1 Introduction
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.009 [8] for \"Intra-3G_MSC SRNS
Relocation\" shall be followed. The following clauses describe the additional
requirements for the bearer independent CS core network. The support of the
enhanced SRNS Relocation is optional.
#### 8.1.6.2 Enhanced Relocation Complete Request
When the Enhanced Relocation Complete Request message is received, the MSC
server requests the MGW to provide a binding reference and a bearer address,
using the Prepare Bearer procedure. For speech calls, the MSC server shall
provide the MGW with the speech coding information for the bearer. For non-
speech calls the MSC server also provides the MGW with the same PLMN Bearer
Capability [4] as was provided at the last access bearer assignment. The MSC
server uses the Change Flow Direction Procedure to request the MGW to set the
Handover Device to initial state. If required the MSC Server shall set-up an
interconnection between the \"anchor\" and the \"target\" MGW. The MSC server
then sends the Enhanced Relocation Complete Response message, containing the
bearer address and the binding reference, to RNC-B (bullet 1 in figure
8.1.6/2).
#### 8.1.6.3 Enhanced Relocation Complete Confirm
When the MSC server receives the Enhanced Relocation Complete Confirm message,
the MSC server uses the Change Flow Direction procedure to request the MGW to
set the Handover Device to intermediate state (bullet 2 in figure 8.1.6/1).
After that the MSC Server requests RNC-A to release the IU. The MSC server
also requests the MGW to set the Handover Device to its final state by
removing the bearer termination towards RNCâ€‘A, using the Release Termination
procedure (bullet 3 in figure 8.1.6/2).
#### 8.1.6.4 Interworking function
The interworking function used by the MGW before relocation will also be used
after relocation.
#### 8.1.6.5 Codec handling
The MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each bearer termination.
#### 8.1.6.6 Voice Processing function
After relocation, the MGW may continue or modify voice-processing function(s)
provided to each bearer termination.
#### 8.1.6.7 Handling of multiple bearers (multicall)
If the UE is engaged with multiple bearers all procedures related to the
handling of bearers and terminations described for the relocation of a single
bearer shall be repeated for each bearer.
#### 8.1.6.8 Failure Handling in MSC server
When a procedure between the MSC server and the MGW fails the MSC server shall
send an IU-ENHANCED-RELOCATION-COMPLETE-FAILURE message to RNS-B in accordance
with 3GPP TS 23.009 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.010 [23]. If MGW resources have been
already seized at the target access side then the resources shall be released
using the Release Termination procedure. If the call is to be cleared, then it
shall be handled as described in clause 7.3.
#### 8.1.6.9 Example
Figure 8.1.6/1 shows the network model for the Intra-MSC enhanced SRNS
Relocation. The \"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The
\"dotted\" line represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. The
bearer termination T1 is used for the bearer towards RNC-A, bearer termination
T3 is used for the bearer towards RNC-B and the bearer termination T2 is used
for the bearer towards the succeeding/preceding MGW.

Figure 8.1.6/1: Intra-MSC Enhanced SRNS Relocation (network model)
Figure 8.1.6/2 shows the message sequence example for the Intra-MSC enhanced
SRNS Relocation.\ It is assumed that the Handover Device is located in the
MGW, which has been selected for the call establishment by the MSC server. The
MSC server controls the call and the mobility management. It is also assumed
that only one bearer has been established towards RNC-A.**[\ ]{.underline}**
In the example the MSC server requests seizure of RNC-B side bearer
termination with specific flow directions. The MSC server orders the
establishment of the bearer by sending Enhanced Relocation Complete Response
towards RNC-B. When the MSC server receives an Enhanced Relocation Complete
Confirm indication from RNC-B the MSC server requests to change the flow
directions between the terminations within the context. MSC Server also orders
RNC-A to release the IU. This action causes release of the bearer between the
RNC-A and the MGW. Finally the MSC server requests the MGW to release RNC-A
side bearer termination.
Figure 8.1.6/2: Intra-MSC Enhanced SRNS Relocation (message sequence chart)
### 8.1.7 Intra-MSC enhanced SRNS Relocation with Iu on IP
If IuCS on IP is supported by the MSC server, the Core Network side procedures
described in 8.1.x shall apply. For the access bearer termination, the
exchange of IP addresses via call control procedures as described in 8.1.5
applies with the following exception. The Prepare_IP_Transport procedure is
used after the MSC Server receives the RANAP Enhanced Relocation Complete
Request. If the bearer transport is IP and IuUP mode is Transparent, when the
MSC Server receives the RANAP Enhanced Relocation Complete Response, it shall
send the RNC IP address and UDP Port to the MGW Access bearer termination
using the Modify_IP_Transport_Address procedure.
The sequence is shown in figure 8.7/1.
Figure 8.1.7/1 Enhanced SRNS Relocation with Iu on IP
## 8.2 UMTS to GSM
In the context of the following clauses, the terms RNS or RNC refer also to a
GERAN BSS or BSC (respectively) when serving an UE in Iu mode.
### 8.2.1 Intra-MSC UMTS to GSM Handover
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.009 [8] for \"Intra-3G_MSC Handover
from UMTS to GSM\" shall be followed. The following clauses describe the
additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core network.
#### 8.2.1.1 Relocation Required
When the MSC server receives the Relocation Required message, it requests the
MGW to seize a TDM circuit, using the Reserve Circuit procedure. For non-
speech calls the MSC server shall provide the MGW with the GSM Channel coding
properties and the same PLMN Bearer Capability [4] as was provided at the last
access bearer assignment. The MSC server uses the Change Flow Direction
procedure to request the MGW to set the Handover Device to initial state. The
MSC server sends the Handover Request message, containing the CIC, to BSC-B
(bullet 1 in figure 8.8/1).
#### 8.2.1.2 Handover Request Acknowledge
For non-speech calls after receiving the Handover Request Acknowledge message
if the assigned GSM Channel coding properties differ from the previously
provided ones the MSC server provides the MGW with the assigned GSM Channel
coding properties using the Modify Bearer Characteristics procedure (bullet 2
in figure 8.8/1).
#### 8.2.1.3 Relocation Command/Handover Detect
When the MSC server sends the Relocation Command message or alternatively if
it receives the Handover Detect message, the MSC server uses the Change Flow
Direction procedure to requests the MGW to set the Handover Device to
intermediate state (bullet 3 in figure 8.8/1).
#### 8.2.1.4 Handover Complete
When the MSC server receives the Handover Complete message, it requests RNC-A
to release the IU. The MSC server also requests the MGW to set the Handover
Device to its final state by removing the bearer termination towards RNCâ€‘A,
using the Release Termination procedure (bullet 4 in figure 8.8/2).
#### 8.2.1.5 Interworking function
The interworking function used by the MGW before handover will also be used
after handover.
#### 8.2.1.6 Voice Processing function
After handover, the MGW may continue or modify voice processing function(s)
provided to each bearer termination.
#### 8.2.1.7 Handling of multiple bearers (multicall)
If the UE is engaged with multiple bearers then one bearer is selected to be
handed over according to 3GPP TS 23.009 [8]. The calls carried by the bearers
that have not been selected will be cleared after the reception of the
Handover Complete message, as described in clause 7.3.
#### 8.2.1.8 Failure Handling in MSC server
When a procedure between the MSC server and the MGW fails the MSC server shall
handle the failure as an internal error in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.009 [8]
and 3GPP TS 29.010 [23]. If MGW resources have been already seized at the

### 8.2.4 Subsequent Inter-MSC UMTS to GSM Handover to a third MSC
The UMTS to GSM handover to a third MSC server (from MSC-B server to MSCâ€‘B
server) is the combination of the two previous inter-MSC handover cases:
\- for MSC-B server a subsequent UMTS to GSM handover from MSC-B server back
to MSC-A server as described in clause 8.2.3; and
\- for MSC-B server a basic UMTS to GSM handover from MSC-A server to MSCâ€‘B
server as described in clause 8.2.2.
MSC-A server implements the corresponding parts of each handover case; i.e.
access handling in MSC-A server is not included.

the speech coding information for the bearer. For non-speech calls the MSC
server shall provide the MGW with the same PLMN Bearer Capability [4] as was
provided at the last channel assignment. The MSC server uses the Change Flow
Direction procedure to request the MGW to set the Handover Device to initial
state. The MSC server sends the Relocation Request message to the RNC-B
containing the bearer address and binding reference (bullet 1 in figure 8.14).
For Relocation towards GERAN Iu mode the GERAN capabilities of the target cell
will be indicated to the MSC-Server within the Handover Required message if
the target cell provides different capabilities than the current cell. If no
information about the GERAN capabilities of the target cell are received
within this message, the MSC-Server shall assume that the GERAN target cell
will provide the same capabilities as the current cell (for details see [29]).
The MSC server shall indicate to GERAN the selected services within the RANAP
RELOCATION REQUEST message. The MSC server shall not set codec information in
the NAS Synchronisation Indicator (see [4]). Instead it shall set codec
information in the GERAN BSC container.
#### 8.3.1.2 Handover Command/Relocation Detect
When the MSC server sends the Handover Command message or alternatively if it
receives a Relocation Detect message, the MSC server uses the Change Flow
Direction procedure to requests the MGW to set the Handover Device to
intermediate state (bullet 2 in figure 8.14).
#### 8.3.1.3 Relocation Complete
When the MSC server receives the Relocation Complete message, it releases the
A-interface line towards BSC-A and requests the MGW to set the Handover Device
to its final state removing the bearer termination towards BSC-A, using
Release Termination procedure (bullet 3 in figure 8.14).
#### 8.3.1.4 Interworking function

information provided to each bearer termination.
#### 8.3.1.6 Voice Processing function
After handover, the MGW may continue or modify voice processing function(s)
provided to each bearer termination.
#### 8.3.1.7 Failure Handling in MSC server
When a procedure between the MSC server and the MGW fails the MSC server shall
handle the failure as an internal error in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.009 [8]
and 3GPP TS 29.010 [23]. If MGW resources have already been seized at the
target access side then the resources shall be released using the Release
Termination procedure. If the call is to be cleared, then it shall be handled
as described in clause 7.3.
#### 8.3.1.8 Example
Figure 8.13 shows the network model for the Intra-3G_MSC GSM to UMTS Handover.

the target cell provides different capabilities than the current cell. If no
information about the GERAN capabilities of the target cell are received
within this message, the MSC-A server shall assume that the GERAN target cell
will provide the same capabilities as the current cell (for details see [29]).
The MSC-A server shall indicate to the MSC-B server the GERAN capabilities of
the target cell, if available, with the MAP Prepare Handover request. For
speech calls, the MSC-A server shall additionally indicate to the MSC-B server
the selected codec, the list of supported codecs, and the currently used
codec.
##### 8.3.2.1.2 Bearer establishment between MGW-A and MGW-B
The handling of the bearer establishment between MGW-A and MGW-B is as
described for a Basic Mobile Originating Call, using either forward or
backward bearer establishment. For speech calls, the MSC-A server shall
provide the MGW-A with the speech coding information for the bearer. For non-
speech calls the MSC-A server shall provide MGW-A with the same PLMN Bearer
Capabilities [4] as were provided at the last access bearer assignment. The
MSCâ€‘A server also uses the Change Flow Direction procedure to request MGW-A to
set the Handover Device to initial state (bullet 3 in figure 8.16/1).
##### 8.3.2.1.3 Handover Command/Handover Detect
When the MSC-A server sends the Handover Command message or alternatively if
it receives the Handover Detect message, the MSC-A server uses the Change Flow
Direction procedure to requests MGW-A to set the Handover Device to
intermediate state (bullet 4 in figure 8.16/2).

is applicable to GERAN A/Gb mode only.
The MSC-B server shall indicate to the GERAN the selected service within the
RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message and shall set the RAB parameters within the
RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message according to the selected service. The MSC
server shall not set codec information in the NAS Synchronisation Indicator
(see [4]). Instead it shall set codec information in the GERAN BSC container..
For speech calls, the MSC-B server shall report the chosen codec and codec
modes back to the MSC-A server with MAP Prepare Handover response.
##### 8.3.2.2.3 Bearer establishment between MGW-A and MGW-B
The handling of the bearer establishment is as described at Basic Mobile
Terminating Call, using either forward or backward bearer establishment.

The MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each bearer termination.
##### 8.3.2.2.5 Voice Processing function
Voice processing function(s) provided by MGW-A before handover, may be
continued or modified by MGW-B after handover.
##### 8.3.2.2.6 Failure Handling in MSC server
When a procedure between the MSC-B server and MGW-B fails the MSC-B server
shall handle the failure as an internal error in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.009 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.010 [23]. If MGW-B resources have already been
seized at the target access side then the resources shall be released using
the Release Termination procedure. The call from MSC-A server shall be
released as described at clause 7.1.

Figure 8.16 shows the message sequence example for the Basic Inter-MSC GSM to
UMTS Handover.\ It is assumed that the Handover Device is located in the MGW
(MGW-A) selected for the call establishment by the MSC server (MSC-A server)
which controls the call and the mobility management.
In the example the MSC-B server requests MGW-B to seize RNC-B side bearer
termination. The call is established between MSC-A server and MSC-B server,
and the bearer is established between MGW-A and MGW-B. When the relocation is
detected in RNC-B the MSC-A server requests to change the flow directions
between the terminations within the context in MGW-A. When MSC-A server
receives Handover Complete indication from MSC-B server it releases the
A-interface line towards the BSC-A. Finally MSC-A server requests MGW-A to
remove BSC-A side bearer termination.

### 8.3.3 Subsequent Inter-MSC GSM to UMTS Handover back to the Anchor MSC
The following handling shall be applied for a call that started as UMTS call.
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.009 [8] for \"Subsequent Inter-MSC GSM
to UMTS Handover back to the Anchor MSC\" shall be followed. The following
clauses describe the additional requirements for the bearer independent CS
core network.
#### 8.3.3.1 MSC-A
##### 8.3.3.1.1 Handover Request
When the MSC-A server receives a MAP Prepare Subsequent Handover request
containing a Handover Request message, it requests the MGW-A to provide a
binding reference and a bearer address using the Prepare Bearer procedure. For
speech calls, the MSC-A server shall provide the MGW-A with the speech coding
information for the bearer. For non-speech calls the MSC-A server shall
provide MGW-A with the same PLMN Bearer Capability [4] as was provided at the
last channel assignment. The MSC-A server uses the Change Flow Direction
Procedure to request the MGW-A to set the Handover Device to initial state.
The MSC-A server sends the Relocation Request message to the RNC-B containing
the bearer address and binding reference (bullet 1 in figure 8.18/1).
For Handover towards GERAN Iu-mode, the MSC-A Server shall select a service
according to the Channel Type received with the Handover Request message and
the capabilities of the GERAN target cell, if the GERAN classmark was
received. For speech calls, the MSC-A server shall additionally take into
account the selected codec and the currently used codec received with MAP
Prepare Subsequent Handover request, and the list of supported codecs.
The MSC-A server shall indicate to the GERAN the selected service within the
RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message and shall set the RAB parameters within the
RANAP RELOCATION REQUEST message according to the selected service. The MSC
server shall not set codec information in the NAS Synchronisation Indicator
(see [4]). Instead it shall set codec information in the GERAN BSC container.
##### 8.3.3.1.2 Handover Command/Relocation Detect
When the MSC-A server sends the MAP Prepare Subsequent Handover response
message or alternatively if it receives a Relocation Detect message, the MSC-A
server uses the Change Flow Direction procedure to requests the MGW-A to set
the Handover Device to intermediate state (bullet 2 in figure 8.18/2).
##### 8.3.3.1.3 Relocation Complete
When the MSC-A server receives a Relocation Complete message, it informs the
MSC-B server about reception of this message. MSC-A server then initiates call
clearing towards the MSC-B server as described in clause 7.3.
##### 8.3.3.1.4 Interworking function
The interworking function used by MGW-A before handover will also be used
after handover.
##### 8.3.3.1.5 Codec handling
The MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each bearer termination.
##### 8.3.3.1.6 Voice Processing function
Voice processing function(s) provided by MGW-A and MGW-B before handover, may
be continued or modified by MGW-A after handover.
##### 8.3.3.1.7 Failure Handling in MSC server
When a procedure between the MSC-A server and the MGW fails the MSC-A server
shall handle the failure as an internal error in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.009 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.010 [23]. If MGW resources have been already seized
at the target access side then the resources shall be released using the
Release Termination procedure. If the call is to be cleared, then it shall be
handled as described in clause 7.3.
#### 8.3.3.2 MSC-B / MGW-B
##### 8.3.3.2.1 Handover Required
For Handover towards GERAN Iu mode the GERAN capabilities of the target cell
will be indicated to the MSC-B server within the Handover Required message if
the target cell provides different capabilities than the current cell. If no
information about the GERAN capabilities of the target cell are received
within this message, the MSC-B server shall assume that the GERAN target cell
will provide the same capabilities as the current cell (for details see [29]).
The MSC-B server shall indicate to the MSC-A server the GERAN capabilities of
the target cell, if available, with the MAP Prepare Subsequent Handover
request. For speech calls, the MSC-B server shall additionally indicate to the
MSCâ€‘A server the selected codec and the currently used codec.
##### 8.3.3.2.2 Handover Complete
When the MSC-B server receives the Handover Complete message, it releases the
A-interface line towards the BSC-A and requests the MGW-B to remove the bearer
termination towards the BSC-A using the Release Termination procedure (bullet
3 in figure 8.18/2).
##### 8.3.3.2.3 Release of bearer towards MGW-A
When the MSC-B server receives a call clearing indication from the MSC-A
server, the MSC-B server handles it as described in subclause 7.2.
##### 8.3.3.2.4 Example
Figure 8.17 shows the network model for Subsequent Inter-MSC GSM to UMTS
Handover back to the Anchor MSC. The \"squared\" line represents the call
control signalling. The \"dotted\" line represents the bearer control
signalling (not applicable in case of GSM access) and the bearer. In the MGW
the bearer termination T1 is used for the bearer towards RNC-B, the bearer
termination T3 is used for the bearer towards MSC-A server, and the bearer
termination T2 is used for the bearer towards the succeeding/preceding MGW. In
MGW-B the bearer termination T4 is used for the bearer towards BSC-A, bearer
termination T5 is used for the bearer towards MGW-A.

Device is located in the MGW (MGW-A) selected for the call establishment by
the MSC server (MSC-A server) which controls the call and the mobility
management.
In the example the MSC-A server requests MGW-A to seize RNC-B side bearer
termination with specific flow directions. When the relocation is detected in
RNC-B the MSC-A server requests to change the flow directions between the
terminations within the context in MGW-A. When MSC-A server receives Handover
Complete indication from RNC-B it transfers this indication to MSC-B server.
MSC-B server releases the A-interface line towards the BSC-A. MSC-A server
initiates call clearing towards MSC-B server.

MSC\ (message sequence chart)
### 8.3.4 Subsequent Inter-MSC GSM to UMTS Handover to a third MSC
The GSM to UMTS handover to a third MSC server (from MSC-B server to MSCâ€‘B
server) is the combination of the two previous inter-MSC handover cases:
\- for MSC-B server a subsequent GSM to UMTS handover from MSC-B server back
to MSC-A server as described in clause 8.3.3; and
\- for MSC-B server a basic GSM to UMTS handover from MSC-A server to MSCâ€‘B
server as described in clause 8.3.2.
MSC-A server implements the corresponding parts of each handover case; i.e.
access handling in MSC-A server is not included.
### 8.3.5 GSM to UMTS Handover with Iu on IP
If IuCS on IP is supported by the MSC server, the Core Network side procedures
described in clauses 8.3.1, 8.3.2, 8.3.3, 8.3.4 shall apply. For the access
bearer termination, the exchange of IP addresses via call control procedures
is described in this clause.
Before the MSC server starts the access bearer assignment, the MSC server
requests the MGW to prepare for the access bearer using the
Prepare_IP_Transport procedure. The MSC server requests the MGW to provide an
IP Transport address and UDP Port and provides the MGW with the bearer
characteristics. For speech calls, the MSC server shall provide the MGW with
the speech coding information and conditionally GTT related information in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.226 [28] for the bearer. For a non-speech call the
MSC server also provides the MGW with a PLMN Bearer Capability [4]. After the
MGW has replied with the IP address and UDP Port the MSC server requests
access bearer assignment using the provided IP address and UDP Port in
accordance with 3GPP TS 25.413 [26]. The IP addresses and UDP Ports of the MGW
and the RNC are exchanged via the RANAP procedures. If the bearer transport is
IP and IuUP mode is Transparent, when the MSC receives the RANAP Iu Relocation
Request response, it shall send the RNC IP address and UDP Port to the MGW
Access bearer termination using the Modify_IP_Transport_Address procedure.
If the bearer transport is IP and IuUP mode is Support, the MGW shall use the
source IP address and UDP Port of the IuUP Init packet received from the radio
access network as the destination address for subsequent downlink packets.
The sequence is shown in figure 8.3.5/1.

for the bearer independent CS core network.
#### 8.4.1.1 Handover Required
When the MSC server receives a Handover Required message, it requests the MGW
to seize a TDM circuit, using the Reserve Circuit procedure. For non-speech
calls the MSC server shall provide the MGW with the GSM Channel coding
properties and the same PLMN Bearer Capability [4] as was provided at the last
access bearer assignment. The MSC server uses the Change Flow Direction
procedure to request the MGW to set the Handover Device to initial state. The
MSC server sends the Handover Request message to the BSC-B containing the CIC
(bullet 1 in figure 8.20/1).
#### 8.4.1.2 Handover Request Acknowledge
For non-speech calls after receiving Handover Request Acknowledge message if
the assigned GSM Channel coding properties differ from the previously provided
ones the MSC server provides the MGW-A with the assigned GSM Channel coding
properties using the Modify Bearer Characteristics procedure (bullet 2 in
figure 8.20/1).
#### 8.4.1.3 Handover Command/Handover Detect
When the MSC server sends the Handover Command message or alternatively if it
receives the Handover Detect message, the MSC server uses the Change Flow
Direction procedure to requests the MGW to set the Handover Device to
intermediate state (bullet 3 in figure 8.20/1).
#### 8.4.1.4 Handover Complete
When the MSC server receives the Handover Complete message, it releases the
A-interface line towards BSC-A. The MSC server also requests the MGW to set
the Handover Device to its final state by removing the bearer termination
towards the BSC-A, using the Release Termination procedure (bullet 4 in figure
8.20/2).
#### 8.4.1.5 Interworking function
The interworking function used by the MGW before handover will also be used
after handover.
#### 8.4.1.6 Voice Processing function
After handover, the MGW may continue or modify voice processing function(s)
provided to each bearer termination.
#### 8.4.1.7 Failure Handling in MSC server
When a procedure between the MSC server and the MGW fails the MSC server shall
handle the failure as an internal error in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.009 [8]
and 3GPP TS 29.010 [23]. If MGW resources have already been seized at the
target access side then the resources shall be released using the Release
Termination procedure. If the call is to be cleared, then it shall be handled
as described in clause 7.3.
#### 8.4.1.8 Example
Figure 8.19 shows the network model for the Intra-MSC GSM to GSM Handover. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer. The bearer termination T1 is used for the bearer

server, the MSC-B server handles it as described in clause 7.2.
##### 8.4.3.2.3 Example
Figure 8.24 shows the network model for the Subsequent Inter-MSC GSM to GSM
Handover back to the Anchor MSC. The \"squared\" line represents the call
control signalling. The \"dotted\" line represents the bearer. In MGW-A the
bearer termination T6 is used for the bearer towards BSC-B, bearer termination
T3 is used for the bearer towards MGW-B, and the bearer termination T2 is used
for the bearer towards the succeeding/preceding MGW. In MGW-B the bearer
termination T4 is used for the bearer towards BSC-A, bearer termination T5 is
used for the bearer towards MGW-A.

(network model)
Figure 8.24 shows the message sequence example for the Subsequent Inter-MSC
GSM to GSM Handover back to the Anchor MSC. It is assumed that the Handover
Device is located in the MGW (MGW-A) selected for the call establishment by
the MSC server (MSC-A server) which controls the call and the mobility
management.
In the example the MSC-A server requests MGW-A to seize BSC-B side bearer
termination with specific flow directions. When the handover is detected in
BSC-B the MSC-A server requests to change the flow directions between the
terminations within the context in MGW-A. When MSC-A server receives
Relocation Complete indication from BSC-B it transfers this indication to
MSC-B server. MSC-B server releases the A-interface line towards the BSC-A.
MSC-A server initiates call clearing towards MSC-B server.

#### 8.4.3.3 Subsequent Inter-MSC GSM to GSM Handover back to the anchor MSC
for A Interface over IP
When the MSC-A server receives the MAP Prepare Subsequent Handover Request
message, it requests the MGW-A to reserve an RTP bearer termination using the
Reserve RTP Connection Point procedure. The MSC-A server requests the MGW-A to
reserve an IP address and UDP port. The MSC-A server uses the Change Flow
Direction procedure to request the MGW-A to set the Handover Device to initial
state.
The MGW-A reserves the RTP termination and indicates the IP address and UDP
port number to the MSC-A server. The IP addresses and UDP ports of the MGW-A
is sent to the BSC-B in the BSSMAP Handover Request message. When the MSC-A
server receives the BSSMAP Handover Request-Ack message, it shall send the
BSC-A IP address and UDP Port number to the MGW-B using the Configure RTP
Connection Point procedure.
The sequence is shown in Figure 8.4.3.3/1.

MSC for AoIP (message sequence chart)
### 8.4.4 Subsequent GSM to GSM Handover to a third MSC
The GSM to GSM handover to a third MSC server (from MSC-B server to MSCâ€‘B
server) is the combination of the two previous inter-MSC handover cases:
\- for MSC-B server a subsequent GSM to GSM handover from MSC-B server back to
MSC-A server as described in clause 8.4.3; and
\- for MSC-B server a basic GSM to GSM handover from MSC-A server to MSCâ€‘B
server as described in clause 8.4.2.
MSC-A server implements the corresponding parts of each handover case, i.e.
access handling in MSC-A server is not included.
### 8.4.5 BSS Internal Handover
#### 8.4.5.1 Introduction
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.009 [8] for \"BSS Internal Handover\"
shall be followed. The protocol messages are defined in 3GPP TS 48.008 [27].
The following clauses describe the additional requirements for the bearer
independent CS core network due to BSS internal handover for A-Interface User
Plane over IP (AoIP).
A BSS Internal Handover may be initiated by the BSS on its own, or triggered
by the MSC server with the transmission of an Internal Handover Enquiry
message to the BSS.
#### 8.4.5.2 Internal Handover Required
When the MSC server receives an Internal Handover Required message, it
requests the MGW to seize a TDM circuit using the Reserve Circuit procedure or
an RTP termination using the Reserve and Configure RTP Connection Point
procedure. In the latter case, the MSC server sends the BSC IP address and UDP
port and the determined A-Interface Codec Type/Configuration to the MGW and
requests the MGW to reserve a local IP address and UDP port.
NOTE: During a BSS Internal handover procedure involving an IP-based target
A-Interface Type before and after the handover, the BSC IP addresses and UDP
ports used before and after the handover may be identical or different. This
is transparent to the MSC Server. In the former case, the BSC can receive on
its BSC IP address and UDP port identical RTP flows received from the source
and target access terminations reserved in the MGW.
For non-speech calls the MSC server shall provide the MGW with the GSM Channel
coding properties and the same PLMN Bearer Capability as was provided at the
last access bearer assignment. The MSC server uses the Change Flow Direction
procedure to request the MGW to set the Handover Device to initial state.
The MGW reserves the TDM circuit or RTP termination and indicates in the
latter case its own IP address and UDP port to the MSC server. The MSC server
then sends the Internal Handover Command message to the BSC containing the
speech codec type/configuration chosen and either the CIC or the MGW IP
address and UDP port.
If the resources requested by the BSS in the Internal Handover Required
message (e.g. codec type or codec configuration, interface type, etc.) are not
available, an Internal Handover Required Reject message shall be returned to
the BSS with the appropriate failure cause, and the procedure shall be
terminated.
#### 8.4.5.3 Internal Handover Command/Handover Detect
When the MSC server sends the Internal Handover Command message or
alternatively if it receives the Handover Detect message, the MSC server uses
the Change Flow Direction procedure to requests the MGW to set the Handover
Device to intermediate state (bullet 2 in figure 8.4.5.8.2).
#### 8.4.5.4 Handover Complete
When the MSC server receives the Handover Complete message, it requests the
MGW to set the Handover Device to its final state by removing the bearer
termination towards the source BSC IP address and UDP port number, using the
Release Termination procedure (bullet 3 in figure 8.4.5.8.2).
#### 8.4.5.5 Interworking function
The interworking function used by the MGW before handover will also be used
after handover.
#### 8.4.5.6 Voice Processing function
After handover, the MGW may continue or modify voice processing function(s)
provided to each bearer termination.
#### 8.4.5.7 Failure Handling in MSC server
When a procedure between the MSC server and the MGW fails the MSC server shall
handle the failure as an internal error in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.009 [8]
and 3GPP TS 29.010 [23]. If MGW resources have already been seized for BSS
internal handover then the resources shall be released using the Release
Termination procedure. If the call is to be cleared, then it shall be handled
as described in clause 7.3.
If the MSC server receives the Handover Failure message during BSS internal
handover procedure, it shall release MGW resources if they have been seized
for BSS internal handover using the Release Termination procedure.
#### 8.4.5.8 Example for a successful BSS Internal Handover
Figure 8.4.5.8.1 shows the network model for the BSS Internal Handover, where
IP transport is used on the A interface before and after the BSS Internal
Handover procedure. The \"squared\" line represents the call control
signalling. The \"dotted\" line represents the bearer. The bearer termination
T1 is used for the bearer towards the source BSC IP address and UDP port
number Ta, bearer termination T3 is used for the bearer towards the target BSC
IP address and UDP port number Tb and the bearer termination T2 is used for
the bearer towards the succeeding/preceding MGW.

Figure 8.4.5.8.1: Intra-MSC BSS Internal Handover (network model)
Figure 8.4.5.8.2 shows the message sequence example for the Intra-MSC BSS
Internal Handover.
In the example, the MSC server receives the Internal Handover Required message
and requests the MGW to reserve an RTP bearer termination (T3) using the
Reserve and Configure RTP Connection Point procedure with specific flow
directions.
The MSC server starts the Internal Handover execution by sending the Internal
Handover Command towards the BSC in which it provides the IP address and UDP
port of the target MGW RTP termination (T3). When the handover is detected in
the BSC, the MSC server requests the MGW to change the flow directions between
the terminations within the context. When the MSC server receives the Handover
Complete indication from the BSC it requests the MGW to release the bearer
termination T1 towards the source BSC IP address and UDP port number Ta that
was used before the BSS Internal Handover was initiated. The sequence is shown
in Figure 8.4.5.8.2.

## 8.5 Handling of GSM Services after UMTS to GSM Handover
The handling of GSM services after handover in the Bearer Independent CS Core
Network architecture is as for the corresponding UMTS services, if not stated
differently.
# 9 Compatibility Issues
A Release 4 (or later) node, according to 3GPP TS 23.205, is backward
compatible with a Release 99 (or earlier) node.
## 9.1 Interworking with GERAN (A i/f)
### 9.1.1 Introduction
The A-interface signalling terminates in the MSC server and the user plane
terminates in the MGW. TDM and/or IP transports may be supported on the
A-interface. The MSC server uses the Mc interface to remotely control the TDM
or IP resources in the MGW.
For intra-MSC handover, the target A-interface is handled as described in
clause 8. If the target A-interface user plane terminates in a different MGW
from the MGW that terminates the serving A-interface user plane, a bearer has
to be established between the two MGWs using Prepare Bearer and Establish
Bearer procedures. Because the same MSC server controls both MGWs, no external
call control signalling is involved.
It is important to note that the separation between the user and control
planes remains the same before and after interaction with services in the 3G
BICC CSCN.
### 9.1.2 A interface over TDM
Only one MSC server may control the TDM circuits connected to one GERAN node.
For each TDM circuit a physical termination is provisioned in the MGW. The TDM
circuit is identified by the termination Id in the Mc interface. Since TDM
circuits are also grouped together, the physical termination Ids are
structured in accordance with the grouping of TDM circuits. The MSC server
also knows the termination Ids and the grouping of termination Ids. The
physical termination exists as long as the TDM circuit(s) exists in the MGW.
Figure 9.1 shows the network model for the A-interface. The \"squared\" line
represents the call control signalling and the \"dotted\" line represents the
TDM circuits. The terminations T1-Tn represent the TDM circuits in the MGW.
The MSC server has a mapping table between circuits CIC1-CICn and the
terminations T1-Tn.

Figure 9.1 TDM circuits used for A-interface (network model)
For call-independent transactions the general (G)MSC server-MGW procedures, as
described in clause 10, apply to the physical terminations in the same way as
to any other terminations.
For call related transactions the handling as described in the clauses 6, 7
and 8 apply to physical terminations in the same way as any other
terminations. All call related procedures, except Prepare Bearer, Establish
Bearer, Release Bearer and Tunnel Information Up/Down, as described in clause
16, apply to the physical terminations in the same way as any other
terminations.
# 10 General (G)MSC server-MGW Procedures
## 10.1 MGW Unavailable
The (G)MSC server recognises that the MGW is unavailable in the following 4
cases:
1\. The signalling connection is unavailable
{width="2.9479166666666665in" height="1.7291666666666667in"}
Figure 10.1: Signalling connection failure
2\. The MGW indicates the failure condition to all connected (G)MSC servers
{width="2.9381944444444446in" height="2.0215277777777776in"}
Figure 10.2: MGW indicates the Failure/Maintenance locking
The failure indication indicates that the MGW will soon go out of service and
that no new connections should be established using this MGW. The MGW can
choose between the \"graceful\" and the \"forced\" method. In the graceful
method the connections are cleared when the corresponding calls are
disconnected. In the forced method all connection are cleared immediately.
  1. The (G)MSC server recognises that the MGW is not functioning correctly, e.g. because there is no reply on periodic sending of Audits. The periodic sending of Audits by (G)MSC server should go on.
  2. The MGW indicates the maintenance locking condition to all concerned (G)MSC servers.
The maintenance locking indication indicates that the MGW is locked for new
calls and that no new connections shall be established using this MGW. The MGW
can choose between the \"graceful\" and the \"forced\" method. In the graceful
method the connections are cleared when the corresponding calls are
disconnected. In the forced method all connection are cleared immediately
In all of the above cases the (G)MSC server shall prevent the usage of the MGW
until the MGW has recovered or the communication with the MGW is restored. The
(G)MSC server shall prohibit the surrounding network from seizing circuits
connected to the unavailable TDM access by sending blocking messages.
## 10.2 MGW Available
The (G)MSC server discovers that the MGW is available when it receives an MGW
Communication Up message or an MGW Restoration message. If the (G)MSC does not
wish to sustain an association with the MGW, the response sent to the MGW may
indicate an alternative MGCId signalling address, in which case the MGW shall
not consider itself registered and should preferably attempt to re-register
with this alternative MGC before any further alternate MGCs. Otherwise, the
response shall not indicate any alternative MGCId signalling address.
When the (G)MSC server discovers that the MGW is available the following shall
occur:
1\. Signalling recovery
The MGW indicates to all connected (G)MSC servers that the signalling
connection is restored. Any changes to the physical termination state during
the loss of communication shall be reported by the MGW using Termination Out
Of Service (10.7) or Termination Restoration (10.8), otherwise the (G)MSC
Server can assume that Terminations service state has not changed. To avoid
unsuccessful calls for physical terminations which went out of service during
the loss of communication but have not yet been reported by the MGW the MSC
Server may Audit the physical terminations before it uses them.
NOTE: Auditing in this case will cause duplicate signalling.
{width="2.9479166666666665in" height="2.03125in"}
Figure 10.3: Communication goes up
2\. MGW restoration/maintenance unlocking indication.
The MGW indicates to all connected (G)MSC servers that normal operation has
resumed. Changes of the physical termination state during the connection break
shall be reported by the MGW using Termination Out Of Service (10.7) and
Termination restoration (10.8) procedures, otherwise the (G)MSC Server can
assume that Terminations service state has not changed. To avoid unsuccessful
calls for physical terminations which went out of service during the loss of
communication but have not yet been reported by the MGW the (G)MSC Server may
Audit the physical terminations before it uses them.
NOTE: Auditing in this case will cause duplicate signalling.
Figure 10.4: MGW indicates recovery from a failure/or maintenance unlocking
NOTE: This procedure may be used after recovery from a signalling failure.
3\. The (G)MSC server recognises that the MGW is now functioning correctly,
e.g. because there is a reply on periodic sending of Audits.
After this the (G)MSC server can use the MGW. If the corresponding devices of
the surrounding network are blocked, unblocked messages shall be sent to the
nodes concerned for devices that are in service: the (G)MSC Server has
determined the actual state of the physical devices either by receiving
Termination Restoration procedure (10.8) or by performing an Audit..
If none of 1,2, and 3 happens the (G)MSC server can initiate the (G)MSC Server
Ordered Re-register procedure.
## 10.3 MGW Recovery
If the MGW recovers from a failure, is maintenance unlocked, or it has been
restarted, it registers to its known (G)MSC servers using the MGW Restoration
procedure or the MGW Registration procedure. The MGW can indicate whether the
Service has been restored or whether it has restarted with a cold or warm
boot. If the (G)MSC does not wish to sustain an association with the MGW, the
response sent to the MGW may indicate an alternative MGCId signalling addres,
in which case the MGW shall not consider itself registered and should
preferably attempt to re-register with this alternative MGC before any further
alternate MGCs. Otherwise, the response shall not indicate any alternative
MGCId signalling address.
Figure 10.5/1: MGW Restoration
Figure 10.5/2 MGW Registration
After the recovery the (G)MSC server can use the MGW. After a MGW warm boot or
service restored, the (G)MSC Server can assume the physical terminations state
has not changed. Changes of the physical termination state during the
connection break shall be reported by the MGW using Termination Out Of Service
(10.7) and Termination restoration (10.8) procedures. To avoid unsuccessful
calls for physical terminations which went out of service during the loss of
communication but have not yet been reported by the MGW the MSC Server may
Audit the physical terminations before it uses them.
NOTE: Auditing in this case will cause duplicate signalling.
After receiving a MGW Register (with cold boot) the (G)MSC Server shall audit
the termination state of all physical terminations (10.9) if it has not been
specifically informed of the actual service state since receiving the MGW
service change on ROOT (Register) via independent service change commands
(10.7 or 10.8). The (G)MSC Server shall thereby determine the actual Service
State of devices. If the corresponding devices of the surrounding network are
blocked, unblocked messages are sent to the nodes concerned for all devices
that are in service.
## 10.4 (G)MSC server Recovery
### 10.4.1 General
If an MGW-unavailable condition is provoked by a failure/recovery action, the
(G)MSC server recovery sequence will, from an information flow point of view,
look like MGW unavailable and then MGW available. If an MGW-unavailable
condition is not provoked, the (G)MSC server recovery sequence will look like
MGW available.
After the information flow, the terminations affected by the recovery action
are released.
### 10.4.2 (G)MSC Server Restoration
Figure 10.6: (G)MSC Server Restoration
NOTE: Normal release procedure may also be initiated.
After the recovery action is complete and it is possible to signal to the MGW
the (G)MSC server starts a timer Tw. If recovery indications are not received
(MGW Communication Up or MGW Restoration) from the MGW during Tw an Audit is
sent. If the (G)MSC server receives a recovery indication or MGW communication
up indication, it shall acknowledge the indication before the (G)MSC Server
Restoration may be sent or the release procedure is initiated.
## 10.5 MGW Re-register
When the (G)MSC requests an MGW to perform a registration (see clause 10.2,
10.3 and 10.6), the MGW performs a re-registration to the (G)MSC which is
defined in the (G)MSC address. If the (G)MSC Server is uncertain of the
termination service state of physical terminations after the Re-Register it
shall use the Audit Procedure (10.9). Changes of the physical termination
state during the connection break shall be reported by the MGW using
Termination Out Of Service (10.7) and Termination restoration (10.8)
procedures.
{width="2.9381944444444446in" height="2.0215277777777776in"}
Figure 10.7: Re-registration of an MGW
## 10.6 MGW Re-registration Ordered by (G)MSC server
If the (G)MSC server knows that communication is possible, but the MGW has not
registered, the (G)MSC server can order re-registration of the MGW.
{width="2.9381944444444446in" height="2.0215277777777776in"}
Figure 10.8: Re-registration ordered by the (G)MSC server
If the re-registration request is accepted the MGW uses the MGW Re-register
procedure to register with the (G)MSC server.
## 10.7 Removal from Service of a Physical Termination
The MGW indicates the removal from service of a physical termination using the
Termination Out-of-Service procedure. In this procedure the MGW indicates
which termination is to be removed from service and whether the \"graceful\"
or \"forced\" method will be used. In the graceful method a possible
connection is cleared when the corresponding call is disconnected. In the
forced method the possible connection is cleared immediately.
{width="2.9479166666666665in" height="2.03125in"}
Figure 10.9: Removal from service of a Physical Termination
The (G)MSC server shall prevent the use of the Termination(s) concerned until
the physical termination is restored to service.
## 10.8 Restoration to Service of a Physical Termination
If the physical termination is restored to service, the MGW shall report it to
the (G)MSC server(s) using the Termination Restoration procedure.
{width="2.9479166666666665in" height="2.03125in"}
Figure 10.10: Restoration to service of a Physical Termination
The (G)MSC server can use the physical termination when the termination has
been restored to service. If the corresponding devices of the surrounding
network are blocked, the (G)MSC server sends an unblocked message to each node
concerned.
## 10.9 Audit of MGW
### 10.9.1 Audit of Value
The (G)MSC server may request the MGW to report the current values assigned to
distinct objects in the MGW. Objects, which can be addressed, are listed in
3GPP TS 29.232 [6]. This procedure shall be used when a change has occurred in
the (G)MSC server such that the server is unsure of the current Service State
of Terminations, such as restart or new trunks configured in the server. For
any situation where a change to the Service State occurs in the MGW the (G)MSC
server shall expect the Service State to be reported by Termination
Restoration (10.8) or Termination Out Of Service (10.7).

Figure 10.14: (G)MSC Server Out of Service
If a (G)MSC server discovers that it wants to go out of service it starts a
(G)MSC Server Out of Service procedure. The (G)MSC server can indicate whether
it requires the context to be cleared immediately (forced) or cleared as the
bearer control protocol clears the bearer (Graceful). Physical terminations
are always cleared when the (G)MSC Server Out of Service indication reaches
the MGW.
## 10.13 MGW Resource Congestion Handling - Activate
When the (G)MSC server requires that a MGW congestion notification mechanism
be applied in the MGW, the (G)MSC server shall use the MGW Resource Congestion
Handling - Activate procedure towards the MGW.
{width="2.9381944444444446in" height="1.4152777777777779in"}
Figure 10.15: MGW Resource Congestion Handling - Activate
## 10.14 MGW Resource Congestion Handling -Indication
When the (G)MSC server receives a load reduction notification from the MGW via
the MGW Resource Congestion Handling - Indication procedure, the (G)MSC server
tries to reduce the processing load that the (G)MSC server creates on the MGW.
The MGW shall decide the actual level of traffic reduction.
{width="2.9381944444444446in" height="1.4152777777777779in"}
Figure 10-17: MGW Resource Congestion Handling -- Indication
## 10.15 Control association monitoring
Monitoring of the H.248 control association may be performed by monitoring the
status of the transport link association where the transport protocol provides
sufficient coupling to the H.248.1 protocol, i.e. if the transport link
association is disconnected when no local H.248.1 protocol connection exists.
An alternative method for the MGW to detect loss of the MGC may be achieved by
requesting the MGW to poll the (G)MSC periodically
Upon registration of a MGW, the (G)MSC server may use the Inactivity Timeout -
Activate procedure towards the MGW to request the MGW to monitor incoming
messages for periods of silence exceeding the maximum inactivity timer value.
{width="4.084722222222222in" height="1.6666666666666667in"}
Figure 10.15.1: Inactivity Timeout - Activate
Upon receipt of an inactivity timeout notification from the MGW via the
Inactivity Timeout -Indication procedure, the (G)MSC server shall send a reply
to the MGW. If the MGC has failed, the MGW will not receive a reply.
{width="4.076388888888889in" height="1.679861111111111in"}
Figure 10.15.2: Inactivity Timeout - Indication
If no Inactivity Timeout -- Indication Ack reply is received, the MGW shall
consider the (G)MSC to have failed. The MGW may then attempt to recontact its
controlling (G)MSC by performing MGW Communication UP. If not successful, the
MGW may then attempt to register to a new (G)MSC.
## 10.16 Hanging termination detection
Whenever requesting new ephemeral bearer terminations, the (G)MSC shall
request the MGW to periodically report termination heartbeat indications to
detect hanging context and termination in the MGW that may result e.g. from a
loss of communication between the MSC-S and the MGW. This may also be done
when requesting TDM terminations, though alternative means exist for the
(G)MSC to detect hanging TDM terminations, e.g. via receipt of the error #433
when seizing the termination.
When the (G)MSC server receives a termination heartbeat notification from the
MGW via the Termination heartbeat - Indication procedure, the (G)MSC shall
return a Termination heartbeat --Indication Ack (without an error) if the
context id / termination identity combination exists in the (G)MSC. If it does
not exist, the (G)MSC shall return an error and shall correct the mismatch,
e.g. by requesting the MGW to subtract the indicated termination and to clear
any associated context.

Figure 10.16.1: Termination heartbeat -- Indication
# 11 Identities
## 11.1 Bearer Address and Binding Reference
The Bearer Address is exchanged on the Nc and Mc interfaces to identify the
termination point of the bearer control signalling within the peer Media
Gateway.
A Binding Reference is an identity, unique within the scope of one bearer
control function, which identifies a bearer network connection. This
information is exchanged on the Nc and Mc interfaces. The bearer control
function is identified by the Bearer Address.
## 11.2 MGW-Id
The Media Gateway Identity (MGW-Id) is information sent on the Nc interface to
aid Media Gateway selection by the succeeding/preceding node.
The MGW-Id is bearer independent and it can be translated into a signalling
address towards the appropriate MGW.
## 11.3 (G)MSC server Address
The (G)MSC server Address defines the signalling address associated with the
(G)MSC server that is used to interact with the Media Gateway over the Mc
interface. This is a unique address in the network service supplier domain.

NOTE 2: The continuity indication in the IAM is not used to indicate that a
continuity check will be performed on the current leg of the call, but it is
used to indicate that a Continuity message can be expected as a result of a
continuity check on a preceding ISUP circuit, or establishment of a preceding
bearer connection.
## 13.1 Enhanced Multi-Level Precedence and Pre-emption service (eMLPP)
No impact.
## 13.2 Call Deflection Service
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.072 [9] for the Call Deflection
supplementary service shall be followed. The following clauses describe the
additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core network.
### 13.2.1 MGW selection and incoming side bearer establishment
The MGW selected for the mobile terminating call is used. The incoming side
bearer has already been established by the mobile terminating call procedures.
### 13.2.2 IU/A-interface release
If the call deflection request from a served subscriber is accepted the call
towards the served mobile subscriber shall be released as described in the
clause for call clearing.
### 13.2.3 Notification to the Calling Subscriber
If the served mobile subscriber has requested that the calling subscriber
shall receive a notification about the call forwarding, a notification is sent
to the calling party. If the notification is implemented using intermediate
tones or announcements the MSC server requests the MGW to play an
announcement/tone to the calling party, as described in clause 14.6, before
establishing the call to the forwarded-to subscriber.
### 13.2.4 Initial addressing
The call towards the deflected-to subscriber is established as for basic call.
If out-of-band transcoder control is applied for a speech call, it shall be
performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3]. After the possible generation
of in-band information has been completed the MSC server shall indicate in the
IAM that forward or backward bearer establishment is to be used. The MSC
server shall indicate in the IAM that no Continuity message will follow since
the incoming bearer has already been established.
The MGW-id can be provided to the succeeding node in the IAM.
### 13.2.5 Establishment of bearer towards the forwarded-to subscriber
The bearer establishment towards the forwarded-to subscriber is performed as
described for the mobile originating call, network side bearer establishment,
using either forward or backward bearer establishment. The MSC server also
requests the MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer.
### 13.2.6 Failure handling in MSC server
The failures are handled as described for the basic mobile originating call.
### 13.2.7 Example
Figure 13.1 shows the network model for call deflection. The \"squared\" line
represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line represents the
bearer control signalling and the bearer. Note that for a TDM access case
there is no separation of call and bearer control signalling. The MSC server
replaces the bearer termination for the served mobile subscriber (T~B~) with
the bearer termination for the deflected-to subscriber (T~C~) in an existing
context in the MGW. The bearer termination T~A~ is used for the bearer towards
the preceding MGW (calling subscriber).

Figure 13.1: Call deflection (Network model)
Figure 13.2 shows the message sequence example for the call deflection with a
possible notification to the calling party using an announcement. In the
example, after the call and the bearer towards the access side have been
released the MSC server requests the MGW to remove the bearer termination for
the served mobile subscriber, and optionally requests the MGW to play an
announcement and to notify the announcement completion. The MSC server shall
request the establishment of the call towards the deflected-to subscriber
after the possible announcement has completed.

No impact.
### 13.3.3 Connected Line Identification Presentation (COLP)
No impact.
### 13.3.4 Connected Line Identification Restriction (COLR)
No impact.
## 13.4 Call Forwarding Services
### 13.4.1 Call Forwarding Unconditional (CFU)
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.082 [12] for the Call Forwarding
Unconditional supplementary service shall be followed. The following clauses
describe the additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core
network.
#### 13.4.1.1 MGW selection
If in-band information is to be provided to the calling subscriber the GMSC
server shall select the MGW before providing the in-band information. The MGW
selection can be based on a possibly received MGW-Id from the preceding node.
If in-band information is to not to be provided to the calling subscriber the
GMSC server shall select the MGW for the bearer as described for the basic
mobile terminating call.
#### 13.4.1.2 Incoming side bearer establishment
The incoming side bearer establishment is handled in the GMSC server as
described for the mobile terminating call using either forward or backward
bearer establishment.
#### 13.4.1.3 Notification to the Calling Subscriber
If the served mobile subscriber has requested that the calling subscriber
shall receive a notification about the call forwarding, a notification is sent
to the calling party. If the notification is implemented using intermediate
tones or announcements the GMSC server requests the MGW to play an
announcement/tone to the calling party, as described in clause 14.6, before
establishing the call to the forwarded-to subscriber.
#### 13.4.1.4 Initial addressing
If the incoming call is to be forwarded without being offered to the served
mobile subscriber the call towards the forwarded-to subscriber is established
as for a basic call. If out-of-band transcoder control is applied for a speech
call, it shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3]. After the
possible generation of in-band information has been completed the initial
addressing towards the forwarded-to subscriber is performed as described for
the basic mobile terminating call indicating either forward or backward bearer
establishment.
#### 13.4.1.5 Establishment of bearer towards the forwarded-to subscriber
The bearer establishment towards the forwarded-to subscriber is performed as
described for the mobile originating call, network side bearer establishment,
using either forward or backward bearer establishment. The GMSC server also
requests the MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer.
#### 13.4.1.6 Confirmation of bearer establishment
> The confirmation of the bearer establishment is handled as described for the
> basic mobile terminating call.
#### 13.4.1.7 Failure handling in GMSC server
> The failures are handled as described for the basic mobile terminating call.
#### 13.4.1.8 Example
Figure 13.3 shows the network model for call forwarding unconditional. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. The GMSC server
seizes one context with two bearer terminations in the MGW. The bearer
termination T~A~ is used for the bearer towards the preceding MGW (calling
subscriber) and the bearer termination T~C~ is used for the bearer towards the
succeeding MGW (forwarded-to subscriber).

Figure 13.3: CFU (Network model)
Figure 13.4 shows the message sequence example for the call forwarding
unconditional with a possible notification to the calling party using an
announcement. In the example the GMSC server optionally requests the MGW to
play an announcement and to notify the announcement completion, after the
bearer to the incoming side has been established. When the possible
announcement has completed the GMSC server requests the establishment of the
call and the bearer towards the forward-to subscriber.

### 13.4.2 Call Forwarding on mobile subscriber Busy (CFB)
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.082 [12] for the Call Forwarding on
Busy supplementary service shall be followed. The following clauses describe
the additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core network.
#### 13.4.2.1 Network Determined User Busy (NDUB)
If the mobile is Network Determined User Busy the incoming call for the
specified basic service(s) shall be forwarded without being offered to the
served mobile subscriber.
##### 13.4.2.1.1 MGW selection
The MSC server shall select an MGW for the bearer connection either before
sending the IAM or after receiving the Bearer Information message. If the MSC
server received an MGW-id from the preceding node and/or from the succeeding
node, then it may use one of them for the MGW selection.
If in-band information is to be provided to the calling subscriber the MSC
server shall select the MGW before providing the in-band information. The MGW
selection can be based on a possibly received MGW-Id from the preceding node.
NOTE: As an implementation option, if there is no need for the MSC server to
manipulate the bearer, the MSC server may only perform call control signalling
without any associated MGW. In that case the bearer related information shall
be provided transparently through the MSC server.
##### 13.4.2.1.2 Incoming side bearer establishment
The incoming side bearer establishment is handled in the MSC server as
described for the mobile terminating call using either forward or backward
bearer establishment. The incoming side bearer establishment can take place
either before or after the detection of NDUB condition.
##### 13.4.2.1.3 Notification to the calling subscriber
If the served mobile subscriber has requested that the calling subscriber
shall receive a notification about the call forwarding, a notification is sent
to the calling party. If the notification is implemented using intermediate
tones or announcements the MSC server requests the MGW to play an
announcement/tone to the calling party, as described in clause 14.6, before
establishing the call to the forwarded-to subscriber.
##### 13.4.2.1.4 Initial addressing
The call towards the forwarded-to subscriber is established as for basic call.
If out-of-band transcoder control is applied for a speech call, it shall be
performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3]. In-band information may be
played to the calling subscriber.
If no in-band information is to be played to the calling subscriber, in order
to withhold the call completion until the establishment of the bearer is
complete.
The MSC server shall indicate in the IAM that the Continuity message will
follow from the preceding node if either of the following conditions is
satisfied before sending the IAM:
1\. The incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, but no
Continuity message has been received, or
2\. The incoming side bearer has not been established.
If the MGW is selected at an early stage the MGW-id can be provided to the
succeeding node in the IAM.
##### 13.4.2.1.5 Establishment of bearer towards the forwarded-to subscriber
The bearer establishment towards the forwarded-to subscriber is performed as
described for mobile originating call, network side bearer establishment,
using either forward or backward bearer establishment. The MSC server also
requests the MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer.
##### 13.4.2.1.5 Confirmation of bearer establishment
If the outgoing IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, the
Continuity message is sent when both of the following conditions are
satisfied:
  1. Either:
```{=html}
``` a. The incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, >
and a Continuity message has been received, or
b. The incoming IAM indicated that no Continuity message will follow.
```{=html}
``` 2\. Either:
```{=html}
``` a. The MSC server has selected an MGW, and a notification indicating
successful completion of the incoming side bearer set-up has been received
from the MGW using the Bearer Established procedure, or
b. MGW selection is not required for this call.
##### 13.4.2.1.6 Failure handling in MSC server
The failures are handled as described for the basic mobile originating call.
##### 13.4.2.1.7 Example
Figure 13.5 shows the network model for call forwarding busy (network
determined user busy). The \"squared\" line represents the call control
signalling. The \"dotted\" line represents the bearer control signalling and
the bearer. The MSC server seizes one context with two bearer terminations in
the MGW. The bearer termination T~A~ is used for the bearer towards the
preceding MGW (calling subscriber) and the bearer termination T~C~ is used for
the bearer towards the succeeding MGW (forwarded-to subscriber).

#### 13.4.2.2 User Determined User Busy (UDUB)
##### 13.4.2.2.1 MGW selection
The MGW selected for the mobile terminating call is used, if already selected
by the mobile terminating call procedures.
The MSC server selects an MGW for the bearer either before sending the IAM of
after receiving the Bearer Information message. If the MSC server received an
MGW-id from the preceding node and/or from the succeeding node, then it may
use one of them for the MGW selection.
If in-band information is to be provided to the calling subscriber the MSC
server shall select the MGW before providing the in-band information. The MGW
selection can be based on a possibly received MGW-Id from the preceding node.
NOTE: As an implementation option, if there is no need for the MSC server to
manipulate the bearer, the MSC server may only perform call control signalling
without any associated MGW. In that case the bearer related information shall
be provided transparently through the MSC server.
##### 13.4.2.2.2 Incoming side bearer establishment
For bearer establishment, the sending of bearer information is handled in the
MSC server as described for the basic mobile terminating call indicating
either forward or backward bearer establishment. The incoming side bearer
establishment can take place either before or after the detection of UDUB
condition.
##### 13.4.2.2.3 IU/A-interface release
If the mobile is not Network Determined User Busy (NDUB as defined in GSM TS
02.01) the incoming call is offered (as a normal or waiting call) to the
served mobile subscriber. If the mobile indicating \"User Busy\" subsequently
releases the call, the call towards the served mobile subscriber is released
as described in the clause for call clearing.
NOTE: The MSC server orders the MGW to remove the bearer termination towards
the served mobile subscriber only in the case where the radio resources had
already been allocated in the MGW (bullet 1 in figure 13.8).
##### 13.4.2.2.4 Notification to the Calling Subscriber
If the served mobile subscriber has requested that the calling subscriber
shall receive a notification about the call forwarding, a notification is sent
to the calling party. If the notification is implemented using intermediate
tones or announcements the MSC server requests the MGW to play an
announcement/tone to the calling party as described in clause 14.6 before
establishing the call to the forwarded-to subscriber.
##### 13.4.2.2.5 Initial addressing
The call towards the forwarded-to subscriber is established as basic call. If
out-of-band transcoder control is applied for a speech call, it shall be
performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3]. In-band information may be
played to the calling subscriber.
If no in-band information is to be played to the calling subscriber, in order
to withhold the call completion until the establishment of the bearer is
complete. The MSC server shall indicate in the IAM that the Continuity message
will follow from the preceding node if either of the following conditions is
satisfied before sending the IAM:
1\. The incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, but no
Continuity message has been received, or
2\. The incoming side bearer has not been established.
If the MGW is selected at an early stage the MGW-id can be provided to the
succeeding node in the IAM.
##### 13.4.2.2.6 Establishment of bearer towards the forwarded-to subscriber
The bearer establishment towards the forwarded-to subscriber is performed as
described for the mobile originating call, network side bearer establishment,
using either forward or backward bearer establishment. The MSC server also
requests the MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer.
##### 13.4.2.2.7 Confirmation of bearer establishment
If the outgoing IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, the
Continuity message is sent when both of the following conditions are
satisfied:
1\. Either:
a. The incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, and a
Continuity message has been received from the preceding node (bullet 8 in
figure 6.6), or
b. The incoming IAM indicated that no Continuity message will follow;
2\. Either:
a. The MSC server has selected an MGW, and a notification of successful bearer
establishment in the incoming side has been received from the MGW (bullet 7 in
figure 6.6), or
b. MGW selection is not required for this call.
##### 13.4.2.2.8 Failure handling in MSC server
The failures are handled as described for the basic mobile originating call.

The MGW selected for the mobile terminating call is used. The incoming side
bearer has already been established by the mobile terminating call procedures.
#### 13.4.3.2 IU/A-interface release
If the call is not answered within the period defined by the no reply
condition timer the call towards the served mobile subscriber will be released
as described in the clause for call clearing.
#### 13.4.3.3 Notification to the Calling Subscriber
If the served mobile subscriber has requested that the calling subscriber
shall receive a notification about the call forwarding, a notification is sent
to the calling party. If the notification is implemented using intermediate
tones or announcements the MSC server requests the MGW to play an
announcement/tone to the calling party, as described in clause 14.6, before
establishing the call to the forwarded-to subscriber.
#### 13.4.3.4 Initial addressing
The call towards the forwarded-to subscriber is established as a basic call.
If out-of-band transcoder control is applied for a speech call, it shall be
performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3]. After the possible generation
of in-band information has been completed (bullet 2 in figure 13.10) the MSC
server shall indicate in the IAM that no Continuity message will follow from
the preceding node because the incoming side bearer has already been
established.
The MGW-id can be provided to the succeeding node in the IAM.
#### 13.4.3.5 Establishment of bearer towards the forwarded-to subscriber
The bearer establishment towards the forwarded-to subscriber is performed as
described for the mobile originating call, network side bearer establishment,
using either forward or backward bearer establishment. The MSC server also
requests the MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer.
#### 13.4.3.6 Failure handling in MSC server
The failures are handled as described for the basic mobile originating call.
#### 13.4.3.7 Example
Figure 13.9 shows the network model for call forwarding no reply. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. Note that for a TDM
access case there is no separation of call and bearer control signalling. The
MSC server replaces the bearer termination for the served mobile subscriber
(T~B~) with the bearer termination for the forwarded-to subscriber (T~C~) in
an existing context in the MGW. The bearer termination T~A~ is used for the
bearer towards the preceding MGW (calling subscriber).

### 13.4.4 Call Forwarding on mobile subscriber Not Reachable (CFNRc)
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.082 [12] for the Call Forwarding on Not
Reachable supplementary service shall be followed. The following clauses
describe the additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core
network.
#### 13.4.4.1 Rerouting by HLR
The same handling as for Call Forwarding Unconditional applies.
#### 13.4.4.2 Rerouting by VLR
If the mobile is not reachable the incoming call for the specified basic
service(s) will be forwarded without being offered to the served mobile
subscriber.
##### 13.4.4.2.1 MGW selection
If in-band information is to be provided to the calling subscriber the MSC
server shall select the MGW before providing the in-band information. The MGW
selection can be based on a possibly received MGW-Id from the preceding node.
NOTE: As an implementation option, if in-band information is not to be
provided to the calling subscriber the MSC server may either perform call
control without any associated MGW, or reserve resources from an MGW and
request bearer establishment through that MGW. In the latter case the MSC
server selects an MGW for the bearer either before sending the IAM or after
receiving the Bearer Information message. If the MSC server received an MGW-Id
from the preceding node and/or from the succeeding node, those can be used for
the MGW selection.
##### 13.4.4.2.2 Incoming side bearer establishment
The incoming side bearer establishment is handled in the MSC server as
described for the mobile terminating call, using either forward or backward
bearer establishment. The incoming side bearer establishment can take place
either before or after the detection of the not reachable condition.
##### 13.4.4.2.3 Notification to the calling subscriber
If the served mobile subscriber has requested that the calling subscriber
shall receive a notification about the call forwarding, a notification is sent
to the calling party. If the notification is implemented using intermediate
tones or announcements the MSC server requests the MGW to play an
announcement/tone to the calling party, as described in clause 14.6, before
establishing the call towards the forwarded-to party.
##### 13.4.4.2.4 Initial addressing
The call towards the forwarded-to subscriber is established as a basic call.
If out-of-band transcoder control is applied for a speech call, it shall be
performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3]. In-band information may be
played to the calling subscriber.
If no in-band information is to be played to the calling subscriber, in order
to withhold the call completion until the establishment of the bearer is
complete the MSC server shall indicate in the IAM that the Continuity message
will follow from the preceding node, if either of the following conditions is
satisfied before sending the IAM:
1\. The incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, but no
Continuity message has been received, or
2\. The incoming side bearer has not been established.
If the MGW is selected at an early stage the MGW-id can be provided to the
succeeding node in the IAM.
##### 13.4.4.2.5 Establishment of bearer towards the forwarded-to subscriber
The bearer establishment towards the forwarded-to subscriber is performed as
described for mobile originating call, network side bearer establishment,
using either forward or backward bearer establishment. The MSC server also
requests the MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer.
##### 13.4.4.2.6 Confirmation of bearer establishment
If the outgoing IAM indicated that a Continuity message will follow, the
Continuity message shall be sent when both of the following conditions are
satisfied:
  1. Either:
```{=html}
``` a. The incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, >
and a Continuity message has been received, or
b. The incoming IAM indicated that no Continuity message will follow.
```{=html}
``` 2\. Either:
```{=html}
``` a. The MSC server has selected an MGW, and a notification indicating >
successful completion of the incoming side bearer set-up has been > received
from the MGW using the Bearer Established procedure, or
b. MGW selection is not required for this call.
##### 13.4.4.2.7 Failure handling in MSC server
The failures are handled as described for the basic mobile originating call.
##### 13.4.4.2.8 Example
Figure 13.11 shows the network model for call forwarding on not reachable. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. The MSC server seizes
one context with two bearer terminations in the MGW. The bearer termination
T~A~ is used for the bearer towards the preceding MGW (calling subscriber) and
the bearer termination T~C~ is used for the bearer towards the succeeding MGW
(forwarded-to subscriber).

## 13.5 Call Waiting (CW)
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.083 [13] for the Call Waiting
supplementary service shall be followed. The following clauses describe the
additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core network. The
following clauses assume subscriber A to be the served subscriber with the
call waiting supplementary service, subscriber B to be the one who is engaged
in a call with user A, subscriber C to be the one who has originated a call to
subscriber A which causes the call waiting supplementary service to be
invoked.
##### Call confirmation to the waiting call {#call-confirmation-to-the-
waiting-call .H6}
The MSC server shall, on reception of the call confirmation, select the MGW
that will be used for the waiting call. The MSC server should select the MGW
which is already in use for the active call. If out-of-band transcoder control
is applied for the waiting speech call, it shall be performed in accordance
with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3].
##### Existing call on hold {#existing-call-on-hold .H6}
The clause \"Hold request\" in clause 13.6 applies.
##### Existing call released {#existing-call-released .H6}
If the active call is disconnected while another call is waiting, the bearer
termination towards the waiting party (C) as well as to the called party (A)
is not removed.
##### Acceptance of waiting call {#acceptance-of-waiting-call .H6}
If the mobile subscriber decides to accept the waiting call, it handles
(according to 3GPP TS 23.083 [13]) the existing call as described in clause
13.5 (i.e. it either puts the call on hold or the call is released). When the
MSC server receives the connect indication from subscriber A, if required the
MSC server shall modify the access bearer as described in subclause 13.18.1.
Finally, the MSC server shall connect the access side bearer termination to
the previously created bearer termination of the remote party in the waiting
call and modify the waiting call\'s bearer termination so that it is both-way
through-connected.
If a different MGW is selected for the incoming call, then a bearer from the
new MGW (MGW2) shall be connected towards the old MGW (MGW1) before offering
the call to the subscriber A.
If out-of-band transcoder control is applied for the waiting speech call, it
shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153[3].
##### Waiting call released by calling subscriber (subscriber C) {#waiting-
call-released-by-calling-subscriber-subscriber-c .H6}
The respective resources already allocated at the selected MGW for the waiting
call shall be released.
##### Example {#example-29 .H6}
Figure 13.13 shows the network model for a waiting call at the serving MSC
server/MGW. The \"thick, squared\" line represents the call control signalling
for the existing call and, on the Iu interface, the already existing control
plane toward the serving RNC. The \"thin, squared\" line represents the call
control signalling for the waiting call. The \"thick, dotted\" line represents
the bearer control signalling and the bearer for the existing call, whereas
the \"thin, dotted\" line represents the ones for the waiting call. Note that
for a TDM access there is no separation of call and bearer control signalling.
NOTE: There shall be only one instance of bearer resource/bearer control
signalling on the radio side.
If the CW condition applies, the MSC server seizes a new context with one
bearer termination, T~C~, in the MGW. T~A~ and T~B~ are the terminations of
the already existing call.

### 13.5.1 Call Confirmation of the waiting call
Figure 13.14 shows the sequence chart for the actions necessary within the
bearer independent CS core network during call confirmation of the waiting
call. Call and bearer establishment shall be as described for the mobile
terminating call. When the MSC server receives the Alerting indication from
the called subscriber (subscriber A), it shall apply the ringing tone to the
waiting termination (T~C~).

### 13.5.2 Acceptance of the Waiting Call
Figure 13.15 shows the sequence chart for the actions necessary within the
bearer independent CS core network for the acceptance of a waiting call. When
the MSC server receives the Connect indication from the UE (subscriber A)
(bullet 1 in figure 13.15), it shall request the MGW to disconnect subscriber
C from the applied ringing tone (bullet 2 in figure 13.15) and move T~A~ to
the context of the waiting call (bullet 3 in figure 13.15). The MSC server
then requests the MGW to change the through-connection of the termination T~C~
so that it will be both way through-connected (bullet 4 in figure 13.15).

## 13.6 Call Hold (CH)
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.083 [13] for the Call Hold
supplementary service shall be followed. The following clauses describe the
additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core network.
### 13.6.1 Hold request
When the UE makes a request for the hold function the MSC server requests the
MGW to interrupt the communication on the bearer by changing the through-
connection of the bearer termination towards the served mobile subscriber to
\"not through-connected\" or by using the Isolate Bearer Termination
Procedure. Announcements may be applied to the held party as described in
clause 14.6.
### 13.6.2 Retrieval request
When the UE makes a request to retrieve a held call the MSC server requests
the MGW to re-establish communication to the held party by changing the
through-connection of the bearer termination towards the served mobile
subscriber to be both-way through-connected or by using the Join Bearer
Termination Procedure.
### 13.6.3 Setting up another call
The call towards the C party is established as described for the mobile
originating call. A new MGW may be selected in the course of setting up the
new call. If out-of-band transcoder control is applied for a speech call, it
shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3]. If required, the MSC
server shall modify the access bearer for the new call as described in
subclause 13.18.1. The MSC server will request the MGW to connect the access
side bearer termination to the bearer termination of the remote party.
### 13.6.4 Alternate from one call to the other
When the hold request for the active call is immediately followed by a
retrieve request for the held call the MSC server shall request the MGW to
connect the bearer termination of the served mobile subscriber to the bearer
termination of the held party. The MSC server also requests the MGW to both-
way through-connect the bearer for the previously held call.
### 13.6.5 Disconnect
If the active call is disconnected while another call is on hold, the bearer
termination towards the served mobile subscriber is not removed but the call
towards the active party is disconnected as described in the clause for call
clearing.
If the held call is disconnected while the served mobile subscriber is
connected to an active call the bearer termination towards the served mobile
subscriber shall not be removed but the call towards the held party is
disconnected as described in the clause for call clearing.
### 13.6.6 Failure handling in MSC server
If any procedure between the MSC server and the MGW has not completed
successfully, the MSC server shall reject the hold/retrieve request.
### 13.6.7 Example 1
Figure 13.16 shows the network model for the call hold with an establishment
of a new call. The \"squared\" line represents the call control signalling.
The \"dotted\" line represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer.
The MSC server isolates the flow connection between the served mobile and the
termination in the MGW that is used for the held call. If an announcement is
to be played to the held party the MSC Server may seize a new context in the
MGW. If a new call is made to C subscriber the MSC server seizes a new context
in the MGW if not previously done. The new context is used for the new call
and the old context is used for the held call. The bearer termination T~A~ is
moved with the bearer towards the RNC (served mobile subscriber) and the
bearer termination T~C~ is used for the bearer towards the succeeding MGW
(C-party).
NOTE: The main advantage with example 1 is that if B party is connected to a
radio access and a handover occurs then the announcement termination is
unaffected and therefore there is no break in the announcement. It is also an
option to put the B-party on hold using the isolate bearer procedure
immediately but this is not shown in this example.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="2.3958333333333335in"}
Figure 13.16: Call hold and establishment of a new call (Network model)
example 1
Figure 13.17 shows the message sequence for example 1 for the call hold
procedure. In the example the MSC server requests the MGW to change the
through-connection of the bearer so that it will not be through-connected when
the hold request is received from the served mobile subscriber (bullet 2 in
figure 13.17). Subsequently if an announcement is to be applied then
Termination T~A~ may be isolated from the held party (bullet 3 in figure
13.17) and a new announcement termination T~A2~ is added to context CTX~AB~
and announcement applied to termination T~A2~ (bullet 3a in figure 13.17). For
setting up a new call to the C-party the termination T~A~ is moved to a new
context if not done previously (bullet 4 in figure 13.17) and a new
termination T~C~ is reserved (bullet 5 in figure 13.17) and the call shall
continue with the appropriate stream mode settings as for a normal call
establishment in accordance with Clause 6.1, see figure 6.2.

Figure 13.17: Hold request (message sequence chart) , example 1
Figure 13.18 shows the message sequence for example 1 for the retrieval
procedure. In the example the MSC server requests the MGW to move the
connection of the bearer back to be both-way through-connected (bullet 3 and 4
in figure 13.18) to the held party, after the held party has been disconnected
from an optionally applied announcement (bullet 2 in figure 13.18). The MOVE
command (Join Bearer termination procedure) is not required (bullet 3 in
figure 13.18) if T~A~ has not previously been moved into the CTX~AC~. The
Change Through-Connection is only required if the retrieval occurs prior to
any connection to C-party.

### 13.6.8 Example 2
Figure 13.18a shows the network model for the call hold with an establishment
of a new call. The \"squared\" line represents the call control signalling.
The \"dotted\" line represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer.
The MSC server isolates the flow connection between the served mobile and the
termination in the MGW that is used for the held call. After the request to
establish a new call is made the MSC server seizes a new context in the MGW,
the new context is used for the new call and the old context is used for the
held call. The bearer termination T~A~ for the bearer towards the RNC (served
mobile subscriber) is moved to this context and the bearer termination T~C~ is
used for the bearer towards the succeeding MGW (C-party). In this example the
announcement is played directly to Termination T~B.~
NOTE: if B party is connected to a radio access and a handover occurs during
the announcement then the announcement will be interrupted. It is also
possible to put B-party on hold using the isolate bearer termination but if
the announcement is still played directly to termination T~B~ as proposed by
this example and a handover occurs then the problem still arises.

Figure 13.18b shows the message sequence for example 2 for the call hold
procedure. In the example the MSC server requests the MGW to change the
through-connection of the bearer to inactive when the hold request is received
from the served mobile subscriber (bullet 2 in figure 13.18b). Subsequently an
announcement may be applied to termination T~B~ (bullet 3 in figure 13.18b).
Then the new call is established via a new context with served mobile
subscriber termination T~A~ being moved to this new context (bullet 4 in
figure 13.18b) and a new termination T~C~ is reserved (bullet 5 in figure
13.18b) and the call shall continue with the appropriate stream mode settings
as for a normal call establishment in accordance with Clause 6.1, see figure
6.2.

Figure 13.18c shows the message sequence example for the retrieval procedure.
In the example the MSC server moves the served mobile subscriber back to the

connection of the bearer to be both-way through-connected (bullet 3 and 4 in
figure 13.18c) after the held party has been disconnected from an optionally
applied announcement (bullet 2 in figure 13.18c). The MOVE command (Join
Bearer Termination procedure) is not required (bullet 3 in figure 13.18c) if
T~A~ has not been in the CTX~AC~. The Change Through-Connection is only
required if the retrieval occurs prior to any connection to C-party.

## 13.7 Multiparty (MPTY)
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.084 [14] for the Multi Party
supplementary service shall be followed. The following clauses describe the
additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core network. If out-of-
band transcoder control is applied for the call, it shall be performed in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3].
### 13.7.1 Beginning the Multi Party call
When the served mobile subscriber invokes a Multi Party service the MSC server
selects an MGW that provides the Multi Party bridge capabilities. If the
selected MGW is different from the MGW that is used for the active call, the
MSC server requests the MGW(s) to connect the bearer terminations of the
participants to the selected MGW. The bearer terminations are connected
together.
### 13.7.2 Managing an active Multi Party call
When the served mobile subscriber puts the Multi Party call on hold the MSC
server requests the MGW to interrupt the connection between the served mobile
subscriber and the Multi Party bridge.
When the served mobile subscriber retrieves a held Multi Party call the MSC
server requests the MGW to re-establish the connection between the served
mobile subscriber and the Multi Party bridge.
When the served mobile subscriber requests private communication with one of
the remote parties (e.g. B-party), the MSC server shall request the MGW to
interrupt the connection between the served mobile subscriber and the Multi
Party bridge, and connection between the remote B party and the Multi Party
bridge. The MSC server requests the MGW to connect the bearer termination of
the served mobile subscriber to the bearer termination of the remote party (or
vice versa) within a same context.
### 13.7.3 Disconnect
If a remote party is disconnected while other parties still remain the call
towards the remote party is disconnected as described in the clause for call
clearing.
### 13.7.4 Failure handling in MSC server
If resources for the Multi Party service cannot be allocated in any of the MGW
resources assigned to the MSC server, then the MSC server shall reject the
MPTY request.
### 13.7.5 Example 1 -- Multiparty call establishment
Figure 13.19 shows the network model for multi party call. The \"squared\"
line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line represents
the bearer control signalling and the bearer. Note that for a TDM access there
is no separation between the call and bearer control signalling. In the
following example it is assumed that each party participating in the Multi
Party conference is handled in a separate context representing the call leg
between the Multi Party bridge and the Multi Party participant. The Multi
Party bridge itself is handled in a separate context. This separation to
several contexts is done in order to simplify interactions with other
functionality, such as handover, even though other implementation options are
not excluded.
{width="5.639583333333333in" height="2.938888888888889in"}
Figure 13.19: Multi Party call (Network model)
For the purposes of the information flow diagrams it is assumed that there are
only two remote parties. Party A is the subscriber controlling the Multi Party
service (served mobile subscriber). Party B is the held party and party C is
the active party.
It is assumed that the Multi Party bridge is located in the MGW that has been
selected for the served mobile subscriber.
Figure 13.20 shows the message sequence example for the beginning of multi
party call. When the served mobile subscriber invokes a Multi Party service
the MSC server requests the MGW to create a separate context for the Multi
Party bridge. The MSC server seizes a bearer termination for each party in
that context. In addition, each call leg is represented by a separate context.
Therefore the parties in the active call will be split in separate contexts.
The MSC server requests the MGW to create a new context and to move the bearer
termination for the served mobile subscriber from the active call context to
the new context. To connect the parties to the Multi Party bridge the MSC
server requests the MGW to establish internal Nb connections between the
bearer terminations in the Multi Party bridge context and the call leg
contexts, using the standard external bearer setup procedures. The held party
is informed about the retrieval of the held call, and the both remote parties
are informed about the multi party call establishment.

### 13.7.6 Example 2 -- Private call establishment during multiparty call
Figure 13.20b shows the network model for private call. The \"squared\" line
represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line represents the
bearer control signalling and the bearer. Note that for a TDM access there is
no separation between the call and bearer control signalling.

NOTE: The two MOVE commands may be sent in different transactions.
For the purposes of the information flow diagrams it is assumed that there are
only two remote parties and the private call is established between the served
mobile subscriber (Party A) and the remote C-party.
Figure 13.20c shows the message sequence example for the beginning of private
communication between the served mobile subscriber and the remote parties
(e.g. C-party).
## 13.8 Closed User Group (CUG)
No impact.
## 13.9 Advice of Charge (AoC)
No impact.
## 13.10 User-to-User Signalling (UUS)
No impact.
## 13.11 Call Barring Services
### 13.11.1 Barring of outgoing calls
No impact.
### 13.11.2 Barring of incoming calls
No impact.
## 13.12 Explicit Call Transfer (ECT)
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.091 [15] for the Explicit Call Transfer
supplementary service shall be followed. The following clauses describe the
additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core network.
Party A is the subscriber controlling the Explicit Call Transfer Call (served
mobile subscriber). Party B is the first remote called party (held party).
Party C is the second remote called party.
### 13.12.1 Connection of remote parties
If the result of the ECT checks is successful the MSC server will order the
MGW to connect the bearer termination of the C-party to the bearer termination
of the B-party (bullet 1 in figure 13.24 or in figure 13.21). As a result of
this action the held party will be retrieved.
If the call towards the C-party has not been answered, the MSC server requests
the MGW to both-way through-connect the bearer termination towards the
C-party.
### 13.12.2 IU/A-interface release
The served party is disconnected after a successful transfer request. The call
towards the served mobile subscriber shall be released as described in the
clause for call clearing.
### 13.12.3 Failure handling in MSC server
If the bearer terminations for the remote parties can not be connected
successfully, the MSC server shall reject the ECT request.
### 13.12.4 Example
Figure 13.23 shows the network model for call explicit call transfer. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. Note that for a TDM
access case there is no separation of call and bearer control signalling. The
MSC server moves the bearer terminations of the remote parties in the same
context and removes the bearer termination for the served mobile subscriber.
The bearer termination T~A~ is used for the bearer towards the served mobile
subscriber, the bearer termination T~B~ is used for the bearer towards the
B-party and the bearer termination T~C~ is used for the bearer towards the
C-party.
{width="6.6375in" height="2.64375in"}
Figure 13.23: ECT (Network model)
Figure 13.24 shows the message sequence example for the explicit call transfer
when both calls have been answered. In the example the MSC server requests the
MGW to move the bearer termination for the C-party in the active call to the
same context which contains the bearer termination for the B-party. The held
party is informed about the retrieval of the held call. Both the remote
parties are informed about the call transfer. After the move the MSC server
releases the call and the bearer connection towards the served mobile
subscriber and requests the MGW to remove the bearer termination for the
served mobile subscriber.

Figure 13.25 shows the message sequence example for the explicit call transfer
when one call is answered and the other call has been delivered. In the
example the MSC server requests the MGW to move the bearer termination for the
C-party in the active call to the same context which contains the bearer
termination for the B-party. The held party is informed about the retrieval of
the held call. Both the remote parties are informed about the call transfer.
After the move the MSC server releases the call and the bearer connection
towards the served mobile subscriber and requests the MGW to remove the bearer
termination for the served mobile subscriber. The B-party is informed about
the active call when the C-party sends the Answer indication.

## 13.13 Completion of Calls to Busy Subscriber (CCBS)
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.093 [16] for the Completion of Calls to
Busy Subscriber supplementary service and 3GPP TS 23.108 [18] shall be
followed. The following clauses describe the additional requirements for the
bearer independent CS core network.
### 13.13.1 Clearing when tones/announcements are provided to the calling
subscriber
If an announcement is to be provided for the purpose of notifying the
subscriber that CCBS activation is possible, the MSC server shall select an
MGW. The MGW performs the traffic channel assignment if the bearer termination
has not been through-connected (as described in clause 6.1 for the basic
mobile originating call). The MGW through-connects the bearer before providing
the in-band information. The MSC server requests the MGW to play an
announcement/tone using the Play Announcement or Send Tone procedure. When the
announcement has completed the MGW notifies the MSC server (using the
Announcement Completed procedure as described in clause 14.6) that the
announcement is complete.
Otherwise the MSC server handles the call clearing as described in clause 7.
### 13.13.2 Network initiated mobile originated call
The call is established as described in clause 6.1 for basic mobile
originating call.
#### 13.13.2.1 Early Traffic Channel Assignment
Within CCBS there is an option for a CCBS call to establish a bearer before
setup in state \"CC-establishment confirmed\". In this case the MSC server
shall check whether an access bearer assignment modification has to be
performed after receiving the setup message from UE.
##### 13.13.2.1.1 Example
For the network model, please refer to figure 6.1.
Figure 13.26 shows the message sequence chart for the network initiated mobile
originating call using the option assignment after A and B party alerting. In
the following, the case with backward bearer establishment is considered.
{width="6.614583333333333in" height="6.5in"}
Figure 13.26: Network initiated mobile originating call establishment with
assignment\ after A and B party alerting (message sequence chart)
### 13.13.3 CCBS Information conveyed by Call Signalling
For CCBS, application specific information needs to be conveyed via the call
signalling. Specific details of the CCBS information are described in 3GPP TS
23.093 [16].
## 13.14 Multiple Subscriber Profile (MSP)
No impact.
## 13.15 Multicall
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.135 [17] for the Multicall
supplementary service shall be followed. The following clauses describe the
additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core network. If out-of-
band transcoder control is applied for a speech call, it shall be performed in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3].
### 13.15.1 Mobile Originating
When the UE is in active mode and it makes a request for the multicall
function on a new traffic channel, call and bearer establishment shall be as
described for mobile originating call.
When the UE is in active mode and it makes a request for the multicall
function using an existing traffic channel, call and bearer establishment
shall be as described for call hold function. An active call will be placed on
hold and the additional originating call will be initiated.
### 13.15.2 Mobile Terminating
When the UE is in active mode and it makes a request for the multicall
function on a new traffic channel, call and bearer establishment shall be as
described for mobile terminating call. Access bearer assignment shall occur
either after a Call Confirmed or a Connect message is received from the UE.
When the UE is in active mode and it makes a request for the multicall
function using an existing traffic channel, call and bearer establishment
shall be as described for call hold function. An active call will be placed on
hold and the additional terminating call will be initiated.
## 13.16 Calling Name Presentation (CNAP)
No impact.
## 13.17 Alternate Speech/Fax
The procedures for facsimile group 3 transparent/non-transparent shall be
followed in accordance with 3GPP TS 43.045 [24] and 3GPP TS 23.146 [25]. The
following clauses describe the additional requirements for the bearer
independent CS core network. If out-of-band transcoder control is applied for
a speech call, it shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3].
Call and bearer establishment shall be handled as described in the Call
Establishment clause. In order to change from speech to fax (or vice versa),
the MSC server shall modify the access bearer as described in subclause
13.18.1.
If the MGW responds with an error to any of the procedures initiated by the
MSC server, or the MSC server receives a Bearer Failure procedure from the
MGW, the MSC server may either clear the call or reject the change from speech
to fax (or vice versa).
After this possible modification, the MGW shall seize an interworking function
if a PLMN Bearer Capability [4] has been supplied to the access side bearer
termination. When the MSC server receives an answer indication, it shall
request activation of the interworking function using the Activate
Interworking Function procedure.
## 13.18 Modification of the Access Bearer
### 13.18.1 Modification of Bearer Characteristics
The modification of the access bearer is possible during a call establishment
and during an active call. If the MSC server needs to modify the access
bearer, the existing bearer termination in the MGW is modified or a new access
side bearer termination is created. The modification of the access bearer
shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 25.413 [26] or 3GPP TS 48.008
[27].
#### 13.18.1.1 Iu mode
If the link characteristics for the existing access bearer need to be changed
and the MSC server previously received a notification from the MGW that
modification of link characteristics of the current transport connection is
supported [refer to 26], the MSC server shall use the Modify Bearer
Characteristics procedure to provide the MGW with the new bearer
characteristics for the existing access side bearer termination. After the MGW
has replied, the MSC server shall initiate the access bearer modification
towards RAN.
If the MSC server has not previously received a notification from the MGW that
modification of existing link characteristics is supported, the MSC server
shall use the Prepare Bearer procedure to request the MGW to add a new context
and a new access side bearer termination, and to provide a bearer address and
a binding reference. After the MGW has replied, the MSC server shall initiate
the access bearer modification towards RAN using the provided bearer address
and the binding reference. Upon successful access bearer modification, the MSC
server shall connect the new access side bearer termination to the old context
and release the old access side bearer termination.
If the user plane mode of the modified access bearer is \"Support Mode\", the
Iu UP will also be re-initialised as defined in [20].
#### 13.18.1.2 A/Gb mode
The MSC server shall use the Modify Bearer Characteristics procedure for A
interface TDM termination and may use the Modify Bearer Characteristics
procedure or the Configure RTP Connection procedure for AoIP termination to
the MGW to provide the new bearer characteristics for the existing access side
bearer termination. After the MGW has replied, the MSC server shall initiate
the access bearer modification towards GERAN.
### 13.18.2 IWF Protocol Change
If the MSC server has requested indication on IWF protocol events, the MGW
informs the MSC server about changes related to IWF protocol, using the
Protocol Negotiation Result and Rate Change procedures.
For AoIP terminations there shall be no change to the AoIP Transport Layer
Address (MGW) and AoIP Transport Layer Address (BSS) for Rate Changes in data
calls. Instead the MSC shall include the previously returned Local Connection
Address in any subsequent Assignment request to the BSS.
## 13.19 GSM Fax
The procedures for facsimile group 3 transparent service toward a GSM BSS
shall be followed in accordance with 3GPP TS 43.045 [24]. The following
clauses describe the additional requirements for the bearer independent CS
core network.
Call and bearer establishment shall be handled as described in the Call
Establishment clause with the addition that the Rate Change Event Notification
shall be requested. If the MGW detects a mismatch between the radio channel
rate to the facsimile transmission speed then it shall indicate this to the
MSC server by use of the rate change procedure. The MSC server shall initiate
a new Assignment towards the GSM RAN and if successful modify the PLMN Bearer
Capability and GSM Channel Coding at the associated access bearer termination
using the Modify Bearer Characteristics procedure as described in 16.2.41 to
signal to the MGW that fax transmission can continue. The sequence is shown in
Figure 13.19/1.
Figure 13.19/1: GSM access Channel Mode Modify message
For AoIP terminations the Configure RTP Connection Point Procedure may be used
instead of the Modify Bearer Characteristics procedure.
## 13.20 Voice group call service (VGCS), Voice broadcast service (VBS)
### 13.20.1 Beginning the Voice group call
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 43.068 [39] for the Voice group call
service shall be followed. For a Voice broadcast call the procedures in 3GPP
TS 43.069 [40] shall be followed. When the served mobile subscriber invokes a
Voice group call service the MSC server selects an MGW that provides the
conference bridge capabilities with enhancements to support Voice group calls.
The MSC server shall estimate the size of the Conference terminations needed
for the VGCS call from the data retrieved from GCR and reserves the requested
number of Conference terminations for that call. The number of needed
conference terminations is provided within prepare bearer procedure.
### 13.20.2 Talker change in Voice group call (1 channel model)
If the MSC server decides that the talker shall use the uplink associated to
the downlink of the ASCI broadcast (common group call) channel (1channel
model, see 3GPP TS 43.068 [39]), the talkers speech is transferred via the
uplink channel of the ASCI broadcast channel of the cell. The stream arrives
within the MGW on the termination of the traffic channel serving the cell or
BSS (enhanced A-interface) and is transferred to the conference function where
the summarized conference signal is calculated. The resulting stream is then
transferred to all conference terminations. The normal behaviour of a
conference bridge is to substract for each conference member its own speech
(incoming stream) from the summarized signal otherwise it hears itself
(outgoing stream). Therefore the Talker context need to be modified by adding
a new termination to the context which is connected to the listener context
(see figure 13.20.5/3 and 13.20.5/5). The topology within the talker context
is set oneway from uplink of the ASCI broadcast channel in direction to
Confernce bridge (old termination of the talker context) and the topology is
set to Oneway from the new added termination towards the termination connected
to the downlink of the ASCI broadcast channel. This is performed using
establish bearer procedure and change flowdirection. To avoid, that the talker
hear himself, the UE internally switch off the loudspeaker (muting/unmuting
functionality, 3GPP TS 43.068 [39]) on request of the MSC server.
### 13.20.3 Disconnect
A dispatcher can leave or reenter the call at any time without any influence
of the ongoing call. Only the dispatcher is disconnected as described in the
clause for call clearing (see 3GPP TS 43.068 [39], 3GPP TS 43.069 [40]).
The Voice group call can only be released by an authorised subscriber (see
3GPP TS 43.068 [39], 3GPP TS 43.069 [40]). If an authorised subscriber
triggers the release of the group call all other parties are disconnected as
described in the clause for call clearing.
### 13.20.4 Failure handling in MSC server
If resources for the Voice group call service cannot be allocated in any of
the MGW resources assigned to the MSC server (e.g. not enough conference
terminations are available with cause \"510 - Insufficient resources\"), then
the MSC server shall reject the VGCS request.
### 13.20.5 Example
Figure 13.20.5/1 shows a possible network model of an anchor MSC for a voice
group call when the Talker is on the dedicated channel. At call setup
Dispatchers, R-MSC and the talker can been seen as a multi party call. The
listners are connected oneway in their context (bullet 1 and 2 in figure
13.20.5/2). In the example every kind of termination is shown in its own
context.
Figure 13.20.5/1: VGCS call (termination overview for talker on dedicated
channel)
If the talker is on a dedicated channel, the talker context contains two
terminations which are connected bothway a termination overview is given in
figure 13.20.5/1.
Figure 13.20.5/2 shows the message flow establishment of a VGCS call with two
cells and the talker is located in cell1 when the Talker is on the dedicated
channel. To connect the parties to the VGCS Multi Party Bridge the MSC server
requests the MGW to establish internal Nb connections between the bearer
terminations in the VGCS Multi Party bridge context and the call leg contexts,
using the standard external bearer setup procedures. VGCS call acknowledge
(bullet 3 in figure13.20.5/2) should be send after the ASCI broadcast channel
is established in the cell where the talker is located (see 3GPP TS 43.068
[39], 3GPP TS 43.069 [40]).
Figure 13.20.5/2: Talker on dedicated channel (Message sequence chart)
Figure 13.20.5/3 shows a possible network model of an anchor MSC for a voice
group call when the Talker is on one channel mode.
Figure 13.20.5/3: VGCS call (termination overview for Talker on one channel
model)
Figure 13.20.5/4 shows the message flow establishment of a VGCS call with two
cells and the talker is located in cell1 when the Talker is on one channel
mode.
Figure 13.20.5/4: Talker on one channel mode (Message sequence chart)
Figure 13.20.5/5 shows the message flow of the talker move to uplink.
If the MSC server decides that the talker shall use the uplink of the cell.
The MSC server adds a termination to the talker context which is connected to
the Listener context and changes the topology of the talker context (bullet 1
and 2 in figure 13.20.5/5). Substract of the termination of the talker is only
performed when the MSC server decides to move an active talker to the ASCI
broadcast channel (bullet 3 in figure 13.20.5/5). The termination towards the
cell where the talker is located is moved to the talker context. Further
talker changes or cell changes of the current talker would be handled with
move commands related to the termination towards the cell where the talker is
located (bullet 4 in figure 13.20.5/5). Thus the talker\'s speech to all the
listeners in that cell is transmitted (broadcast channel). The termination
overview after the talker is moved to the uplink is given in figure 13.20.5/3.

# 14 Interactions with Other Network Features and Services
NOTE: All message sequence charts in this clause are informative examples.
## 14.1 Customised Applications for Mobile network Enhanced Logic (CAMEL)
If the gsmSRF is co-located with the (G)MSC server, the gsmSRF is divided into
a gsmSRF server and an MGW. The gsmSRF server terminates the CAP protocol and
signals over the Mc interface to instruct its MGW to provide the required
resource. All the logic of the gsmSRF is located in the gsmSRF server. The MGW
provides only simple resources for playing a single announcement or tone, or
detection of single DTMF tone pair. If one single resource in the MGW does not
fulfil the requirement of the gsmSCF, the gsmSRF server has to use different
resources in sequence to fulfil the whole requirement.
The gsmSSF uses the capabilities of the (G)MSC server and the MGW to play
announcements or send tones to the server.
NOTE 1: In the subsequent figures within clause 14.1, the \"Connect To
Resource\" scenario is used. However the other CAMEL Intelligent Peripheral
(IP) scenarios are not intended to be excluded. No impacts are identified when
applying these other CAMEL scenarios.
NOTE 2: The gsmSRF functionality may be deployed within the MSC server, and
either the current serving MGW or any MGW resource under the control of the
current MSC server.
### 14.1.1 Play Announcement/Send Tone
The playing of an announcement or sending of a tone shall be performed in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.078 [10]. It is assumed that the MGW selected for
the call has the capabilities to provide announcements and tones.
When the gsmSCF requests the gsmSRF to play a specified announcement or tone,
the gsmSRF orders the MGW to play the announcement or tone as described in
clause 14.6.
After the gsmSRF has received the announcement or tone completed notification
from its MGW, it reports the announcement or tone completion to the gsmSCF.
If the gsmSCF requests the gsmSRF to cancel the earlier started announcement
or tone, the gsmSRF orders the MGW to stop playing the announcement or tone as
described in clause 14.6.
#### 14.1.1.1 Example of playing announcement by the gsmSRF
{width="6.041666666666667in" height="3.0625in"}
Figure 14.1: CAMEL Announcement Playing (message sequence chart)
### 14.1.2 User Interaction
The user interaction shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.078
[10]. It shall be assumed that the MGW selected for the call has the
capabilities to provide announcements. In bearer independent CS core network
the DTMF digits can be propagated inband or out-of-band.
#### 14.1.2.1 Play announcement
When the gsmSCF requests the gsmSRF/SSF to play a specified announcement and
to collect digits that are sent by the user the gsmSRF/SSF requests the MGW to
play the announcement as described in clause 14.6.
#### 14.1.2.2 Detect DTMF tones
The gsmSRF/gsmSSF starts detecting DTMF tones, as describes in clause 14.4.2,
before it receives the announcement or tone completed notification (see clause
14.6).
#### 14.1.2.3 Report DTMF tones
The DTMF tones are reported to the gsmSRF/SSF as described in clause 14.4.2.
After all requested digits are received the gsmSRF/SSF reports the digits to
the gsmSCF.
#### 14.1.2.4 Cancel prompt and collect user information
If the gsmSCF requests the gsmSRF to cancel the prompt and collect user
information procedure, which had been started earlier, the gsmSRF orders the
MGW to stop playing the announcement or sending tone, if they are still in
progress , using the Stop Announcement or the Stop Tone procedure. The gsmSRF
shall also order the MGW to stop detecting DTMF tones using the Stop DTMF
Detection procedure.
{width="6.291666666666667in" height="2.9270833333333335in"}
Figure 14.2: CAMEL User Interaction (message sequence chart)
NOTE: Since gsmSRF don not know whether DTMF digits are provided inband or
out-of-band the gsmSRF has to be able to collect DTMF tones both inband and
out-of-band.
### 14.1.3 Call Party Handling (CPH)
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.078 [10] for Call Party Handling (CPH)
shall be followed. The following clauses describe the additional requirements
for the bearer independent CS core network.
In contrast with HOLD and MPTY, the call parties created on instruction from
the gsmSCF are not seen as separate calls in the Mobile Station, i.e. all call
parties in a CPH configuration use the same _transaction id_ towards the MS.
In addition, CPH may take place in an MSCâ€‘S different from the one where the
CAMEL served subscriber is registered. Furthermore, in CPH it is possible to
have multiple call parties in separate _call segments_ whereas the call hold
supplementary service has a limit of one held call party and one active call.
The gsmSCF always triggers the elementary procedures which are described in
this subclause. CPH elementary procedures can be used in more complex
procedures to provide useful services, but the more complex procedures are out
of scope of this specification.
NOTE: For simplicity, the figures below which show network models do not show
the gsmSCF. The gsmSCF is in the HPLMN of the served (CAMEL) party. The GMSCâ€‘S
is in the interrogating network (IPLMN). The MSCâ€‘S is in the VPLMN of the
served party.
##### Use of a multi-party (conference) bridge {#use-of-a-multi-party-
conference-bridge .H6}
When the gsmSCF invokes a CPH procedure which requires the connection of three
or more legs in a multi-party configuration, the MSC server selects an MGW
which provides multi-party bridge capabilities. The timing of the selection of
the MGW with the multi-party bridge capabilities is vendor specific. If the
selected MGW is not the MGW which is used for the active call, the MSC server
requests the MGW(s) to connect the bearer terminations of the participants to
the selected MGW. The bearer terminations are connected together.
#### 14.1.3.1 Call Party Handling concepts
The relationship between Call Segments and voice connections is explained in
3GPP TS 23.078 [10] subclause 4.5.1.
#### 14.1.3.2 Initiate Call Attempt procedure
The Initiate Call Attempt (ICA) procedure is used either:
  * To create a new call (out-of-the-blue), in which case the gsmSCF makes the initial contact with the MSCâ€‘S, or
  * To create an additional call party in an existing call. The new call party is always created in a new call segment. The existing call may have triggered contact with the gsmSCF based on CAMEL subscription information (MO or MT in VMSC, MT in GMSC, call forwarding etc), or the gsmSCF may have initiated the contact using the ICA procedure (out-of-the-blue).
The gsmSCF may create additional call parties before it establishes the bearer
to the calling party. The MSCâ€‘S/GMSCâ€‘S shall establish bearers to the
additional call parties independently of the other parties, including the
calling party.
The leg which is created by the Initiate Call Attempt procedure is initially
in the held state.
##### 14.1.3.2.1 Example
Figure 14.1.3/1 shows an example network model for the Initiate Call Attempt
procedure with an establishment of a new call leg. The \"squared\" line
represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line represents the
bearer control signalling and the bearer. The MSCâ€‘S seizes a new context with
one bearer termination in the MGW which is used for the new call leg.
Figure 14.1.3/1 Initiate Call Attempt procedure (Network model)
Figure 14. 1.3/2 shows an example message sequence for the Initiate Call
Attempt procedure.
In this example a new call leg to the C-party is established.
Figure 14. 1.3/2 Information flow for Initiate Call Attempt (message sequence
chart)
#### 14.1.3.3 Move Leg procedure
The Move Leg procedure is used to move a leg from its current call segment to
the (existing) target call segment.
Using Move Leg to add a leg to a call segment which already includes 2 call
legs requires the establishment of a multiparty call (if it does not already
exist for the served CAMEL subscriber) as described in clause 13.7. Other call
parties may be involved in independent Multiparty calls due to MPTY SS or CPH.
If the call segment to which the specified leg is added is already using a
multi-party bridge, the MSC server requests the MGW to establish the
connection between the specified leg and the multi-party bridge.
##### Example {#example-34 .H6}
Figure 14. 1.3/3 shows an example network model for the Move Leg procedure.
The \"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\"
line represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer
Figure 14. 1.3/3 Move Leg procedure (Network model)
Figure 14. 1.3/4 shows an example message sequence for the Move Leg procedure.
In this example the leg of the C-party is moved to an existing call segment.
The MSCâ€‘S requests the MGW to move the bearer termination for the C-party to
the same Context which contains the bearer termination for the A-party
Figure 14. 1.3/4 Information flow for Move Leg (message sequence chart)
#### 14.1.3.4 Split Leg procedure
The Split Leg procedure is used to separate a call leg from a source call
segment and place it in a (new) target call segment.
When the gsmSCF uses the Split Leg procedure to put a call leg on hold, the
MSC server instructs the MGW to interrupt the connection between the specified
call leg and the other party/parties in the call segment. If the call segment
is using a multi-party bridge, the connection from the specified call leg to
the multi-party bridge is interrupted.
##### Example {#example-35 .H6}
Figure 14. 1.3/5 shows an example network model for Split Leg procedure. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer.
Figure 14. 1.3/5 Split Leg procedure (Network model)
Figure 14. 1.3/6 shows an example message sequence for the Split Leg
procedure.
In this example the leg of the B-party is moved to a new call segment. The
MSCâ€‘S requests the MGW to move the bearer termination for the B-party in the
active call to a new context.
Figure 14. 1.3/6 Information flow for Split Leg (message sequence chart)
#### 14.1.3.5 CAMEL User interaction procedure
In accordance with 3GPP TS 23.078 [10] the gsmSCF may order the MSCâ€‘S/gsmSSF
to play an announcement or control user interaction as specified in subclauses
14.1.1 and 14.1.2 respectively. The tones are provided in accordance with
subclause 14.6 of the present document. As part of Call Party Handling,
announcements or tones can be played to an individual party or to all the
parties connected in the call segment.
The gsmSCF may also instruct the MSCâ€‘S to establish a temporary connection to
an external device which provides the user interaction.
#### 14.1.3.6 Failure handling in the MSCâ€‘S
If resources for Call Party Handling cannot be allocated in any of the MGWs
assigned to the MSCâ€‘S, then the MSCâ€‘S shall reject the request for the Call
Party Handling procedure.
## 14.2 IST
The handling of IST shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 42.032 [19].
This clause describes the additional requirements for the Bearer Independent
CS Core Network.
The clearing of calls due to IST is the same as for (G)MSC server initiated
call clearing, refer to clause 7.3,(G)MSC server Initiated.
## 14.3 Operator Determined Barring (ODB)
NOTE: The subsequent clauses in 14.3 describe the impacts of \"Barring of
Outgoing Calls\" and \"Barring of Incoming Calls\" on Bearer Independent CS
CN. Other flavours of Operator Determined Barring may be supported by the
Bearer Independent CS CN. However no impacts caused by these other flavours
are identified.
### 14.3.1 Barring of Outgoing Calls
If the mobile station attempts to connect to an address determined to be
barred by the Operator Determined Barring service, the call shall be cleared
as described in clause 7, Call Clearing.
Otherwise, the call is established as described in clause 6, Call
Establishment.
### 14.3.2 Barring of Incoming Calls
If the incoming call to the mobile station is determined to be barred by the
Operator Determined Barring service, the call shall be barred. Otherwise the
call shall be delivered as described in clause 6, Call Establishment.
If the GMSC connects the call to a recorded announcement due to Operator
Determined Barring, the GMSC server selects the MGW before providing the in-
band information. It is possible that the MGW selection is based on an MGW-Id
received from the preceding node.
The incoming side bearer establishment is handled in the GMSC server as
described for the mobile terminating call using either forward or backward
bearer establishment.
In-band information may be provided to the calling subscriber only when both
of the following conditions are satisfied:
1\. Either:
a. The incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, and a
Continuity message has been received, or
b. The incoming IAM did not indicate that the Continuity message will follow;
2\. Notification indicating successful completion of the incoming side bearer
set-up has been received from the MGW using the Bearer Established procedure.
The GMSC server provides the MGW with the announcement identification and
requests the MGW to notify the announcement completion using the Play
Announcement procedure as described in clause 4.6.
After the possible announcement has been completed the GMSC server initiates
the call release as described in the clause 7, Call Clearing.
## 14.4 DTMF
DTMF information can be transported either inband or out of band. In order to
minimise the interworking between out of band and in band DTMF signalling, the
general principle is to use the DTMF signalling method of the preceding node
whenever possible. A node supporting OoB DTMF shall also be able to receive
inband DTMF digits, but no DTMF digits shall be duplicated, i.e. any detected
digit shall either be sent forward by inband or out-of-band, but never by both
methods. Transitions between inband and out-of-band may occur due to changes
to an ongoing call (Explicit Call Transfer for example) but digits shall not
be sent both inband and OoB for the same link.
If out-of-band transcoder control is applied for a speech call, it shall be
performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3]
### 14.4.1 DTMF Tone Generation
#### 14.4.1.1 Inband DTMF Tone Generation
This option uses inband signalling to transport DTMF digits in the core
network.
The DTMF tone generation shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.108
[18]. The following clauses describe the additional requirements for the
bearer independent CS core network.
##### 14.4.1.1.1 Start DTMF
When the MSC server receives the Start DTMF message from the UE, it uses the
Send DTMF procedure to request the MGW to modify the bearer termination to
play a tone for the pressed digit. The result of the tone sending by the
bearer termination will be received by the MSC server and sent to the UE
(bullet 1 in figure 14.3).
##### 14.4.1.1.2 Stop DTMF
When the MSC server receives the Stop DTMF message from the UE, it uses the
Stop DTMF procedure to request the MGW to modify the bearer termination to
stop digit playing. When the response is received from the MGW, the MSC server
will acknowledge the Stop DTMF (bullet 2 in figure 14.3).
The MGW shall check the minimum duration and minimum interval in accordance
with the DTMF timing defined in TS 23.014 [33].
##### 14.4.1.1.3 Example
Figure 14.3 shows an example where out-of-band signalling of DTMF information
is not supported by the call control protocol. When the UE sends Start DTMF
and Stop DTMF messages , the MSC server uses resources in the MGW to generate
tones by modifying the bearer termination.
{width="6.614583333333333in" height="3.6041666666666665in"}
Figure 14.3: Inband DTMF generation (message sequence chart)
#### 14.4.1.2 Out-of-Band DTMF Tone Generation
This option uses out-of-band network signalling to transport DTMF digits in
the core network, where the information is sent on a call control layer.
The DTMF Tone Generation shall be performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.108
[18]. The following clauses describe the additional requirements for the
bearer independent CS core network.
##### 14.4.1.2.1 Start DTMF
When the MSC server receives a Start DTMF message from the UE, it indicates
digit playing using out-of-band signalling. The corresponding result received
from the preceding/succeeding node will be sent to the UE (bullet 1 in figure
14.4).
##### 14.4.1.2.2 Stop DTMF
When the MSC server receives a Stop DTMF message from the UE, it indicates
stop digit playing using out-of-band signalling. The succeeding node will
indicate that digit playing is stopped. The MSC server will send the result
back to the UE (bullet 2 in figure 14.4).
##### 14.4.1.2.3 Example
Figure 14.4 shows the message sequence example for the out-of-band DTMF during
a call. When the MSC server receives the Start DTMF and Stop DTMF messages
from the UE, it shall send the information using signalling on call control
layer. The MSC server will not use any dedicated resources of the MGW.

Figure 14.4: Out-of-Band DTMF generation (message sequence chart)
### 14.4.2 DTMF Detection
#### 14.4.2.1 Inband DTMF Detection
The (G)MSC server/gsmSSF/gsmSRF requests the MGW to detect DTMF tones using
Detect DTMF procedure (bullet 1 in figure 14.5).
At detection of the DTMF tone the MGW reports the digit to the (G)MSC
server/gsmSSF/gsmSRF using the Report DTMF procedure (bullet 2 in figure
14.5). At reception of the DTMF tone report the (G)MSC server/gsmSSF/gsmSRF
either expects the MGW to detect other DTMF tones (in which case no new Detect
DTMF request needs to be sent) or requests the MGW to stop the detection of
DTMF tone (bullet 3 in figure 14.5) using the Stop DTMF Detection procedure.
{width="6.291666666666667in" height="2.8020833333333335in"}

#### 14.4.2.2 Out-of-Band DTMF Detection
The (G)MSC server/gsmSSF/gsmSRF starts collecting out-of-band DTMF tones. One
DTMF tone consists of Start DTMF (bullet 1 in figure 14.6) and Stop DTMF
messages (bullet 2 in figure 14.6).

## 14.5 OR
The procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.079 [11] for the Optimal Routeing
network service shall be followed. The following clauses describe the
additional requirements for the bearer independent CS core network.
### 14.5.1 Optimal routeing for basic mobile-to-mobile calls
The optimally routed call from one mobile subscriber to another mobile
subscriber is established as a normal basic call.
### 14.5.2 Optimal routeing for conditional call forwarding; Early call
forwarding
For early call forwarding the same procedures as described for CFU and CFNRc
(rerouting by HLR) shall apply.
### 14.5.3 Optimal routeing for conditional call forwarding; Late call
forwarding
#### 14.5.3.1 MSC server
##### 14.5.3.1.1 Resume Call Handling and clearing of connection to GMSC
server
When the MSC server determines that the call should be forwarded because the
called mobile subscriber is busy (NDUB, UDUB), not reachable or has not
replied to the call before the no-reply timer has expired, the MSC server
sends a request to resume call handling to the GMSC server.
If the GMSC server determines that the call can be forwarded to the forwarded-
to destination it sends a Release message to the MSC server. If no bearer has
been established yet the MSC server handles the release only on call control
level. If the bearer had been established, the MSC server handles the network
side bearer release as described in the clause for the call clearing.
##### 14.5.3.1.2 IU release
When the MSC server determines that the call should be forwarded because the
called mobile subscriber is busy (UDUB) or it has not replied to the call
before the no-reply call timer has expired, the MSC server shall release the
call and bearer connection to the served mobile subscriber as described in the
clause for call clearing.
#### 14.5.3.2 GMSC server
##### 14.5.3.2.1 Resume Call Handling and Clearing of Connection to visited
MSC server
If the GMSC server determines that the call can be forwarded to the forwarded-
to destination it sends a Release message to the MSC server and handles the
outgoing side bearer release as described in the clause for call clearing, if
the bearer had already been established.
##### 14.5.3.2.2 MGW selection
The GMSC server shall select an MGW for the bearer connection as described for
the CFU and CFNRc (in HLR) supplementary services, if not already selected by
the mobile terminating call procedures.
##### 14.5.3.2.3 Incoming side bearer establishment
The bearer establishment towards the preceding MGW is handled in the GMSC
server as described for the mobile terminating call, if not already
established by the mobile terminating call procedures.
##### 14.5.3.2.4 Notification to the Calling Subscriber
The GMSC server sends the possible notification towards the calling subscriber
according to the procedures described for the CFU and CFNRc (in HLR)
supplementary services.
##### 14.5.3.2.5 Establishment of call and bearer towards the forwarded-to
subscriber
The GMSC server establishes the call and bearer towards the forwarded-to
subscriber according to the procedures described for the CFU and CFNRc (in
HLR) supplementary services.
##### 14.5.3.2.6 Example
Figure 14.7 shows the network model for optimal routeing when no bearer has
been established before the invocation of late call forwarding. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. The GMSC server
seizes one context with two bearer terminations in the MGW. The bearer
termination T~A~ is used for the bearer towards the preceding MGW (calling
subscriber) and the bearer termination T~C~ is used for the bearer towards the
succeeding MGW (forwarded-to subscriber).

(Network model)
Figure 14.8 shows the message sequence example for the optimal routeing with
late call forwarding without any notification to the calling party. In the
example below no bearer has been established for the connection when the MSC
server sends the Resume Call Handling request to the GMSC server. After the
call towards the visited MSC server has been released the GMSC server
establishes the call and the bearer as described for Call Forwarding
Unconditional.

been established before the invocation of late call forwarding. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. The GMSC server
replaces the bearer termination towards the visited MSC server (T~MSC~) with
the bearer termination for the forwarded-to subscriber (T~C~) in an existing
context in the MGW. The bearer termination T~A~ is used for the bearer towards
the preceding MGW (calling subscriber).

Figure 14.10 shows the message sequence example for the optimal routeing for
late call forwarding with a forward bearer release. In the example the MSC
server requests the MGW to remove the termination towards the served mobile
subscriber after the bearer towards the RNC has been released. At reception of
the release message from the GMSC server the MSC server requests the MGW to be
prepared for the bearer release. When the GMSC server receives the Release
Complete it requests the MGW to release the bearer.

## 14.6 Providing tones or announcements [ ]{.underline}
It shall be assumed that the MGW selected for the call has the capabilities to
provide announcements and tones.
### 14.6.1 Preconditions when providing in-band information to the calling
subscriber
For a mobile terminating/forwarded call, announcements/tones may be provided
to the calling subscriber only when both of the following conditions are
satisfied:
  1. Either:
```{=html}
``` a. The incoming IAM indicated that the Continuity message will follow, >
and a Continuity message has been received, or
b. The incoming IAM did not indicate that the Continuity message will >
follow;
```{=html}
``` 2\. Notification indicating successful completion of the incoming side >
bearer set-up has been received from the MGW using the Bearer > Established
procedure.
For a mobile originating call, the traffic channel assignment shall be
completed before providing the in-band information to the calling subscriber.
### 14.6.2 Preconditions when providing in-band information to the called
subscriber
The called party is selected by the calling party, or a supplementary service
(call forwarding, call deflection, CAMEL redirection etc), or a call is
initiated by the gsmSCF using the Initiate Call Attempt procedure. The called
party may also be in the PSTN.
Announcements/tones may be provided to the called subscriber only when both of
the following conditions are satisfied:
  1. The called party has answered and is still active in the call.
  2. Notification indicating successful completion of the outgoing side bearer set-up has been received from the MGW using the Bearer Established procedure.
### 14.6.3 Preconditions when providing in-band information to multiple
subscribers
The gsmSCF may instruct the MSCâ€‘S/gsmSSF to provide announcements or tones for
multiple subscribers. For each calling and called subscriber the precondition
for calling and called subscriber (respectively) shall be fulfilled. If the
preconditions are not fulfilled for all subscribers (e.g. one of the called
parties is in the alerting phase), then the announcements/tones shall not be
played to the subscribers who do not meet the preconditions, but the
announcements/tones shall be played to the subscribers (if any) who meet the
preconditions.
### 14.6.4 Request to play an announcement/tone
The (G)MSC server/gsmSSF/gsmSRF provides the MGW with the announcement/tone
identification and optionally requests the MGW to notify the announcement/tone
completion using the Play Announcement or Send Tone procedure (bullet 1 in
figure 14.13).
### 14.6.5 Stopping an announcement/tone
The (G)MSC server/gsmSSF/gsmSRF can order the MGW to stop the current
announcement/tone using the Stop Announcement or Stop Tone procedure (bullet 2
in figure 14.13).
### 14.6.6 Announcement/tone completed
If notification of the announcement/tone completion was requested in the Play
Announcement or Send Tone procedure, the MGW notifies the (G)MSC
server/gsmSSF/gsmSRF when the announcement/tone has been completed using the
Announcement Completed or Tone Completed procedure (bullet 3 in figure 14.13).
### 14.6.7 Example 1
Figure 14.12 shows the network model for providing in-band information to the
calling subscriber where the (G)MSC-S requests to play the announcement/tone
directly on the desired termination from which the signal shall be sent. The
\"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\" line
represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. The bearer
termination Tx is used for the bearer towards the preceding MGW (calling
subscriber).
A bearer termination Ty may exist in the same context towards the succeeding
MGW (called subscriber) and may be both-way connected and through-connected
with Tx. In that case, the exchange of media streams between the terminations
Tx and Ty is assumed to be normally interrupted during playing the
announcement in the direction towards which the announcement is played.

Figure 14.12: Providing in-band information\ (Network model)
Figure 14.13 shows the message sequence example for providing the calling
party with an announcement/tone. In the example the (G)MSC server requests the
MGW to play an announcement/tone and to notify the announcement/tone
completion. The (G)MSC server may stop the announcement while the current
announcement/tone is ongoing.

Figure 14.13: Playing an announcement/tone (message sequence chart)
### 14.6.8 Example 2
Figure 14.6.8/1 shows the network model for providing in-band information to
the calling subscriber where the (G)MSC-S requests to play the
announcement/tone on another termination in the context connected via topology
information to the desired termination(s). E.g. during the call setup, the
MSC-S requests the MGW to send a ring back tone to the calling subscriber when
receiving the indication that the called subscriber is being alerted.
The \"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The \"dotted\"
line represents the bearer control signalling and the bearer. The in-band
information applied on the T0 termination is forwarded to the bearer
termination(s) towards which the topology association is either \'oneway\' or
\'bothway\', i.e. towards the Ta termination in this example.
Figure 14.6.8/1: Proving in-band information\ (Network model)
Figure 14.6.8/2 shows the message sequence example for providing the calling
party with the announcement/tone. In the example the MSC requests the MGW to
play an announcement/tone by seizing a new ephemeral announcement/tone
termination with the indication that a tone or announcement shall be forwarded
internally to the bearer termination(s) towards which the topology association
is either \'oneway\' or \'bothway\'.
Figure 14.6.8/2: Playing an announcement/tone (message sequence chart)
## 14.7 Global Text Telephony
3GPP TS 23.226 [26] describes the high level architecture and functionality of
GTT. When text based conversation is needed by a subscriber, the call is
established with general call control functions like any other call. Within
the call control transactions the UE indicates the need for text conversation
(see 3GPP TS 24.008 [4]), which then requires actions in the core network
where the pooling mechanism is chosen for GTT feature. This section describes
only the option where the CTM pool is provided in the Media Gateway in the
Core Network.
MSC Server receives an indication by the UE about the need of text
conversation, allocates terminations in MGW with CTM (Cellular Text telephony
Modem) capabilities for the detection of CTM signals from radio access
network. The default action of the call path in the CTM-detection/conversion
function in MGW is to transfer audio transparently while monitoring for text
telephone signals. When valid text telephone signals are detected, the
converting action of the channel takes effect. The path converts between the
detected CTM at the access termination and PSTN text telephony signalling
methods on the network side. This mode of operation continues until text
signalling ceases. Then transparent audio transport is re-established, again
monitoring for text signals.
The CTM channel is created with Prepare bearer for Iu/ATM terminations,
Prepare IP Transport for Iu/IP terminations,Reserve circuit procedure for A
interface over TDM terminations or with Reserve RTP Connection Point for A
interface over IP by including Cellular Text Telephone package properties. The
core network bearer shall be established with default PCM codec to carry the
T.140 protocol.
The outcome of CTM negotiation towards the CTM user in the user plane is
reported in the CTM report procedure.
At release the MGW may report the number of bits of Global Text Telephony data
in accordance with ITU recommendation T.140 sent for the call.
## 14.8 Emergency Calls
Emergency Calls shall be handled as in clause 6.1 Basic Mobile Originating
Call. and clause 6.2 Basic Mobile Terminating Call. The Procedure Emergency
Call Indication may be used for informing the MGW about the emergency call.
## 14.9 Subscriber and equipment trace
For the subscriber and equipment trace the MSC server may be activated for
tracing (see 3GPP 32.421 [34]). Besides performing trace record generation, if
Signalling based activation the MSC server shall forward the Trace Session
activation to GERAN with BSSAP signaling, UTRAN with RANAP signaling (see 3GPP
TS 25.413) and if the trace control and configuration parameters are defined
so, the MGW. For detailed description of trace session activation mechanism
see 3GPP TS 32.422 [35]. The activation to the MGW is sent using a trace
package which is included either to the Add or Modify command(s) in mobile
originated call or mobile terminating call. In the case of handovers where new
termination is created the trace package is also included into the Add
command. If the MSC does not receive the optional trace interface list IE in
the trace activation request it shall request tracing on all terminations that
support the total MGW trace interfaces as defined in TS 32.422. The MSC Server
shall only set the trace interface list value that is associated to the
interface that the termination supports and optionally the Mc interface trace
value if requested from the HLR. The content of the trace records generated in
the MSC server and the MGW will follow the rules of 3GPP TS 32.421[34] and
3GPP TS 32.422[35], 3GPP TS 32.423 [36]. The content of the MGW and MSC Server
trace record is described in TS 32.423 [36].
## 14.10 Customized Alerting Tone
## 14.10.1 General
Customised Alerting Tone may be provided from a \"CAT Server\" switched into
the call at appropriate trigger points. The \"CAT Server\" is out of the scope
of the 3GPP architecture and therefore the signalling procedures towards the
CAT Server (if not collocated) are not described.
The Forward CAT indicators and Backward CAT indicators information elements
are specified in 3GPP TS 29.205 [22].
The following sub-clauses describe extensions to basic call handling and
unless explicit exceptions are made all basic call protocol handling support
is unchanged.
### 14.10.2 Audio CAT
#### 14.10.2.1 Audio CAT Activated by the Calling Party
If the calling party subscriber has activated the CAT service (CAT-A) for
audio and the subscriber is in its Home PLMN and the calling party subscriber
gives priority to CAT-A, the originating MSC Server supporting the audio CAT-A
service shall connect that calling party UE towards the CAT Server during
alerting phase. The MSC Server is responsible for switching the user plane
towards the CAT Server during alerting phase and then on receipt of answer
message from the called party the MSC Server shall switch the user plane
towards the called party and releasing the connection to the CAT Server.
The originating MSC may indicate the CAT priority to the terminating network
by setting the CAT Priority indicator of the Forward CAT indicators
information element when sending an IAM to the succeeding node.
If the calling party subscriber supports CAT-A but gives priority to CAT-B and
the originating MSC receives an ACM or CPG from the succeeding network with
the CAT content Indicator in the Backward CAT indicators information element
set to \"inband media content available\" then it shall not switch the user
plane towards the CAT Server. If however the originating MSC does not receive
an indication that CAT-B is present then it shall switch the user plane
towards the CAT server as described above for the CAT-A priority case.
NOTE: Providing alerting tone at the calling party rather than from the called
party network can cause voice clipping if the called party answers and speaks
while the calling party network has not disconnected the inband alerting tone.
#### 14.10.2.2 Audio CAT Activated by the Called Party
If the called party subscriber has activated the CAT service (CAT-B) for
audio, the GMSC Server supporting the audio CAT-B service shall check the CAT
Priority indicator if the Forward CAT indicators information element is
received. If CAT-A priority is requested the GMSC Server shall handle the call
in accordance with normal call handling not supporting CAT-B service. If no
CAT-A priority is received the GMSC Server shall connect the calling party
network to the CAT Server during alerting phase. The GMSC Server should
indicate in ACM or CPG message if CAT-B is inserted by setting the CAT content
Indicator in the Backward CAT indicators information element. The GMSC Server
is responsible for switching the user plane towards the CAT Server during
alerting phase and then on receipt of answer message from the called party the
GMSC Server shall switch the user plane towards the called party and releasing
the connection to the CAT Server.
### 14.10.3 Multimedia CAT
#### 14.10.3.1 Introduction
The following subclauses specify the mobile originated and mobile terminated
multimedia call procedures to generate a multimedia CAT to a UE supporting the
multimedia CAT capability.
A UE supporting multimedia CAT will indicate support of this capability to the
MSC server as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [4].
To play a multimedia CAT to such a UE, upon receiving the indication that the
called party is being alerted and that a multimedia CAT is available, the MSC
Server supporting multimedia CAT shall request the MGW to both-way through-
connect the bearer towards the source of the multimedia CAT using the Change
Through-Connection procedure, and then request the calling UE to attach to the
user connection for multimedia as soon as an appropriate channel in multimedia
mode is available and to set up an H.324 call by indicating \"inband
multimedia CAT available\" within an ALERTING message or a PROGRESS message as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [4] subclause 5.3.6.4.
#### 14.10.3.2 Multimedia CAT Activated by the Calling Party
If the calling party subscriber has activated CAT service (CAT-A) for
multimedia and the subscriber is in its Home PLMN and the calling party
subscriber gives priority to CAT-A, the originating MSC Server supporting
multimedia CAT-A service for multimedia it shall connect that calling UE
towards the CAT Server during alerting phase. The MSC Server is responsible
for switching the user plane towards the CAT Server during alerting phase and
then on receipt of answer message from the called party the MSC Server shall
switch the user plane towards the called party and release the connection to
the CAT Server.
The originating MSC may indicate CAT-A has priority to the terminating network
by setting the CAT Priority indicator of the Forward CAT indicators
information element to \'Priority given to Calling party (CAT-A)\' when
sending an IAM to the succeeding node.
NOTE: As the Forward CAT indicators information element is required to be sent
by the originating MSC with the Multimedia CAT capability Indicator set to to
\"MCAT supported\" if it permits multimedia CAT-B, the inclusion of the
Forward CAT indicators information element is not strictly required since if
no CAT parameters are included it has the same effect as indicate CAT-A has
priority however it does provide explicit indication that the calling party
supports CAT-A.
If CAT-B is given priority then the Multimedia CAT capability Indicator of the
Forward CAT indicators information element shall be set as described in
subclause 14.10.3.3.1.
If the calling party subscriber supports CAT-A but gives priority to CAT-B and
the originating MSC receives an ACM or CPG from the succeeding network with
the CAT content Indicator in the Backward CAT indicators information element
set to \"inband media content available\" then it shall not switch the user
plane towards the CAT Server and shall follow the procedures defined in
subclause 14.10.3.3.1. If however the originating MSC does not receive an
indication that CAT-B is present then it shall switch the user plane towards
the CAT server as described above for the CAT-A priority case.
#### 14.10.3.3 Multimedia CAT Activated by the Called Party
##### 14.10.3.3.1 Mobile originated multimedia call
If the calling UE supports the multimedia CAT service and no CAT-A priority
exists, the originating MSC supporting the multimedia CAT service shall inform
the succeeding node that multimedia CAT is supported by setting the Multimedia
CAT capability Indicator of the Forward CAT indicators information element to
\"MCAT supported\" in the IAM message sent to the succeeding node.
The MSC Server supporting the multimedia CAT service shall consider that a
multimedia CAT is available if it receives an ACM or CPG message including the
Multimedia CAT content Indicator in the Backward CAT indicators information
element set to \"inband media content available\".
##### 14.10.3.3.2 Mobile terminated multimedia call
If the called party subscriber supports the \"CAT-B\" service for multimedia
and if the GMSC Server supporting the optional CAT-B service for multimedia
receives the Multimedia CAT capability Indicator in the Forward CAT indicators
information element set to \"MCAT supported\" in the IAM from the preceding
node, the GMSC Server shall connect the calling party to the CAT Server during
the alerting phase.
To play a multimedia CAT to the calling subscriber, upon receiving the
indication that the called party is being alerted, the GMSC supporting
multimedia CAT shall request the MGW to establish, and both-way through-
connect, a bearer connection towards a CAT Server.
The GMSC shall inform the originating MSC that a multimedia CAT is available
(if any) by setting the Multimedia CAT content Indicator of the Backward CAT
indicators information element to \"inband media content available\" in the
ACM or CPG message.
##### 14.10.3.3.3 Example
Figure 14.10.3.3.3.1 shows the message sequence chart example for providing
multimedia CAT activated by the called party during a basic multimedia call
establishment. In the example, the calling UE, the originating MSC and GMSC
support the multimedia CAT capability.
The calling UE initiates a multimedia call establishment during which it
indicates that it supports multimedia CAT capability (bullet 1). The
originating MSC sends an Initial Address message to the GMSC of the called
party indicating that Multimedia CAT is supported.
The GMSC server determines that the called party has a multimedia CAT
subscription (bullet 6) e.g. based on OSS code retrieved from the HLR.
Upon receiving the indication that the called party is being alerted, the GMSC
sets up a UDI call towards the CAT Server. Upon reception of an Address
Complete message from the CAT server, it returns to the originating MSC an
Address Complete or Call Progress message indicating that multimedia CAT is
available (bullet 13). This leads the originating MSC to request the calling
UE (supporting multimedia CAT) to attach to the user connection and to set up
a H.324 call to the CAT server (bullet 14).
When the called party accepts the call, the GMSC releases the call towards the
CAT server (bullet 18), waits for the Release Complete message from the CAT
Server, and then through-connects the calling and called legs and returns an
answer indication to the originating MSC.
Upon reception of the CONNECT message, the calling UE releases any on-going
H.324 call and establishes a new H.324 call towards the called party.

call (message sequence chart)
# 15 Tunnelling
NOTE: All message sequence charts in this clause are examples. All valid call
establishment message sequences can be derived from the example message
sequences and associated message pre-conditions.
## 15.1 Forward Bearer Establishment
The following clauses describe the requirements for tunnelling transport
mechanism within the bearer independent CS core network. These requirements
are supplementary to those already stated in the Call Establishment clause. If
out^â€‘^ofâ€‘band transcoder control is applied for a speech call, it shall be
performed in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153 [3].
### 15.1.1 Outgoing Side
#### 15.1.1.1 Tunnel Selection
If the MGW selection occurs before the IAM is sent, the (G)MSC server uses the
Prepare Bearer procedure to indicate a tunnel support to the MGW. Depending
upon the received value, the MGW shall determine whether tunnelling shall
actually be used and when to send the tunnel data (bullet 1 in figure 15.2).
If the (G)MSC server indicated that tunnelling is not supported, the bearer
will be established as described in clause Call Establishment.
If the (G)MSC server indicated that fast tunnelling is supported, the MGW may
select which tunnelling method to use. In this case the MGW shall select
either fast tunnelling or the non-tunnelling method.
If the (G)MSC server indicated that delayed tunnelling is supported, the MGW
may select which tunnelling method to use. In this case the MGW shall select
either delayed tunnelling or the non-tunnelling method.
If the MGW is allowed to choose whether tunnelling is to be used, it shall
select either fast, delayed, or the nonâ€‘tunnelling method.
The MGW shall respond to the Prepare Bearer procedure with the used tunnel
indication, when the type of tunnelling mechanism has been decided.
NOTE: For a given bearer type, other specifications may describe the mechanism
to be used to transport bearer control information. An MGW is only required to
comply with that specification.
#### 15.1.1.2 Initial addressing
If the MGW selection has occurred, the MGW shall respond to the Prepare Bearer
procedure indicating whether tunnelling is allowed and what type of tunnelling
is used -- fast or delayed forward. The (G)MSC server provides a tunnel
indicator to the succeeding node in the IAM to indicate that tunnelling is to
be used. For fast tunnelling, the (G)MSC server waits for the MGW to use the
Tunnel Information Up procedure to provide the tunnel data before the IAM is
sent.
If the MGW indicates that tunnelling is not to be used, then tunnel indicator
is not included in the Initial Address message and the bearer will be
established as described in clause Call Establishment.
If the MGW has not been selected yet, then the (G)MSC server decides whether
delayed tunnelling is supported or not. If the delayed tunnelling is supported
the tunnel indicator is included to the Initial Address message to indicate
that. Otherwise the tunnel indicator is not included to the Initial Address
message and the bearer will be established as described in clause Call
Establishment.
#### 15.1.1.3 Fast forward tunnelling
The tunnel data is transferred in the IAM and the subsequent Tunnel
Information message(s).
Before the IAM is sent, the (G)MSC server waits for the MGW to use the Tunnel
Information Up procedure to supply the tunnel data. The (G)MSC server sends
the received tunnel data to the succeeding node in the IAM (bullet 2 in
example, clause 15.2).
When the (G)MSC server receives a Tunnel Information message from the
succeeding node the (G)MSC server uses the Tunnel Information Down procedure
to supply the MGW with the received tunnel data (bullet 5 in example sequence
15.2).
#### 15.1.1.4 Delayed forward tunnelling
The tunnel data is transferred in the Tunnel Information messages following
the Bearer Information message.
If tunnel indicator was included in the IAM indicating that delayed tunnelling
is supported, the succeeding node may include the tunnel indicator to the
Bearer Information message. If the tunnel indicator is received the (G)MSC
server indicates the delayed tunnel support in the Establish Bearer procedure.
When the MGW sends the Tunnel Information Up procedure, the (G)MSC server
sends the received tunnel data in the Tunnel Information message to the
succeeding node.
When the (G)MSC server receives a Tunnel Information message from the
succeeding node, the (G)MSC server uses the Tunnel Information Down procedure
to send the received tunnel data to the MGW.
#### 15.1.1.5 Bearer control signalling transfer
The tunnelling of the bearer control signalling is transported transparently
through the (G)MSC server during the call establishment and at any other time
until Release is sent or received.
### 15.1.2 Incoming Side
#### 15.1.2.1 Initial addressing
The (G)MSC server receives the possible tunnel indicator and the tunnel data
in IAM. Based on received information it provides the tunnel support
indication and the tunnel data to the MGW.
#### 15.1.2.2 Tunnel Selection
If the tunnel indicator was received in the IAM, the (G)MSC server uses the
received tunnel indicator to indicate the support of tunnel to the MGW. If the
tunnel indicator is received in the IAM without tunnel data, the (G)MSC server
checks the value of the tunnel indicator. If the tunnel indicator indicates
that tunnel mechanism is to be used then delayed tunnelling is indicated to
the MGW. If the tunnel indicator indicates that tunnel mechanism is supported
the (G)MSC server decides whether the delayed tunnel is supported or non
tunnelling mechanism is used. If both tunnel indicator and tunnel data are
received in the IAM, fast tunnelling is indicated to the MGW.
If no tunnel indicator was received in the IAM, then the preceding node has
indicated that non-tunnelling mechanism is to be used.
The (G)MSC server uses the Prepare Bearer procedure to supply the tunnel
support indication to the MGW.
The MGW decides based on the received tunnel support indication from the
(G)MSC server whether to use delayed tunnelling or not. In the response the
MGW provides the used tunnel indication to the (G)MSC server.
#### 15.1.2.3 Fast forward tunnelling
The tunnel data is transferred in the IAM and the subsequent Tunnel
Information message(s).
The (G)MSC server sends the tunnel data received in the IAM to the MGW using
the Tunnel Information Down procedure (bullet 3 in example, clause 15.2).
When the MGW sends the Tunnel Information Up procedure, the (G)MSC server
sends the received tunnel data in the Tunnel Information message to the
preceding node (bullet 4 in example, clause 15.2).
#### 15.1.2.4 Delayed forward tunnelling
The tunnel data is transferred in the Tunnel Information messages following
the Bearer Information message.
If tunnel indicator was received in the IAM indicating that delayed tunnel is
supported and delayed tunnelling was indicated by the MGW, the (G)MSC server
shall include the tunnel indicator to the Bearer Information message which is
sent to the preceding node.
When the (G)MSC server receives a Tunnel Information message from the
preceding node, the (G)MSC server uses the Tunnel Information Down procedure
to send the received tunnel data to the MGW.
When the MGW sends the Tunnel Information Up procedure, the (G)MSC server
sends the received tunnel data in the Tunnel Information message to the
preceding node.
#### 15.1.2.5 Bearer control signalling transfer
The tunnelling of bearer control signalling is transported transparently
during the call establishment and at any other time until Release is sent or
received.
#### 15.1.2.6 Example
Figure 15.1 shows the network model for the forward tunnelling transport
mechanism. The \"squared\" line represents the call control signalling. The
\"dotted\" line represents the bearer control signalling. The (G)MSCa seizes
one context with two bearer terminations in MGWa. The bearer termination T1 is
used for the bearer towards the incoming side of (G)MSCa and the bearer
termination T2 is used for the tunnelling towards the succeeding MGW. The
(G)MSCb seizes one context with two bearer terminations in MGWb. The bearer
termination T3 is used for the bearer towards the outgoing side of (G)MSCb and
the bearer termination T4 is used for the tunnelling towards the preceding
MGW.
{width="5.1305555555555555in" height="2.0625in"}
Figure 15.1: Forward Tunnelling Transport Mechanism (network model)
Figure 15.2 shows the message sequence example for fast forward tunnelling
transport mechanism. In the example (G)MSCa indicates to MGWa that fast
tunnelling is requested. After MGWa has notified the (G)MSCa of the tunnel
data, the IAM is sent to the (G)MSCb. The (G)MSCb indicates to MGWb that fast
tunnelling is supported and sends the received tunnel data to MGWb. Once MGWb
has sent the tunnel data to the (G)MSCb, the (G)MSCb sends a Tunnel
Information message with the tunnel data to the (G)MSCa. The (G)MSCa sends the
received tunnel data to MGWa. The handling of Continuity message, through-
connection and answer is as normal for non-tunnelled forward bearer
establishment.

Figure 15.2: Fast Forward Tunnelling Transport Mechanism (message sequence
chart)
## 15.2 Backward Bearer Establishment
The following clauses describe the additional requirements for tunnelling
transport mechanism within the bearer independent CS core network. If out-of-
band transcoder control is applied for a speech call, it shall be performed in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.153[3].
### 15.2.1 Outgoing Side
#### 15.2.1.1 Tunnel Selection
The (G)MSC server uses the Prepare Bearer procedure to indicate a tunnel
support to the MGW. Depending upon the received value, the MGW shall determine
whether tunnelling shall actually be used and when to send the tunnel data
(bullet 1 in example, clause 15.4).
If the (G)MSC server indicated that tunnelling will be not supported, the
bearer is established as described in clause Call Establishment.
If the (G)MSC server indicated that fast tunnelling is supported, the MGW may
select which tunnelling method it can use. In this case the (G)MSC may select
either fast tunnelling or the non-tunnelling method.
If the (G)MSC server indicated that delayed tunnelling is supported, the MGW
may select which tunnelling method it can use. In this case the (G)MSC server
may select either delayed tunnelling the non-tunnelling method.
If the MGW is allowed to choose whether tunnelling is to be used, it shall
select either fast, delayed or the nonâ€‘tunnelling method.
After MGW has decided which tunnelling mechanism to use , it responds to the
Prepare Bearer procedure with the used tunnel indication.
#### 15.2.1.2 Initial addressing
The MGW shall respond to the Prepare Bearer procedure to indicate whether
tunnelling is allowed and what type of tunnelling is used -- fast or delayed
forward. The (G)MSC server provides a tunnel indicator to the succeeding node
in the IAM. For fast tunnelling, the (G)MSC server waits for the MGW to use
the Tunnel Information Up procedure to provide the tunnel data before the IAM
is sent.
If the MGW indicates that tunnelling is not to be used, the bearer will be
established as described in clause Call Establishment.
#### 15.2.1.3 Fast forward tunnelling
The tunnel data is transferred in the IAM and the subsequent Tunnel
Information message(s).
Before the IAM is sent, the (G)MSC server waits for the MGW to use the Tunnel
Information Up procedure to supply the tunnel data. The (G)MSC server sends
the received tunnel data to the succeeding node in the IAM.
When the (G)MSC server receives a Tunnel Information message from the
succeeding node the (G)MSC server uses the Tunnel Information Down procedure
to supply the MGW with the received tunnel data.
#### 15.2.1.4 Delayed backward tunnelling
The tunnel data is transferred in the Tunnel Information messages following
the IAM.
When the (G)MSC server receives a Tunnel Information message from the
succeeding node the (G)MSC server uses the Tunnel Information Down procedure
to supply the MGW with the received tunnel data (bullet 4 in example, clause
15.4).
When the MGW sends the Tunnel Information Up procedure, the (G)MSC server
sends the received tunnel data in the Tunnel Information message to the
succeeding node (bullet 5 in example, clause 15.4).
#### 15.2.1.5 Bearer control signalling transfer
The tunnelling of bearer control signalling is transported transparently
through the (G)MSC server during the call establishment and at any other time
until Release is sent or received.
### 15.2.2 Incoming Side
#### 15.2.2.1 Initial addressing
The (G)MSC server receives the possible tunnel indicator and the tunnel data
in the IAM. Based on received information it provides the tunnel support
indication and the tunnel data to the MGW.
#### 15.2.2.2 Tunnel Selection
If the tunnel indicator was received in the IAM, the (G)MSC server uses the
received tunnel indicator to indicate the support of tunnel to the MGW. If the
tunnel indicator is received in the IAM without tunnel data, delayed
tunnelling is indicated to the MGW. If tunnel indicator and tunnel data are
received in the IAM, fast tunnelling is indicated to the MGW.
The (G)MSC server uses the Establish Bearer procedure to supply the tunnel
support indication to the MGW (bullet 2 in example, clause 15.4).
#### 15.2.2.3 Fast forward tunnelling
The tunnel data is transferred in the IAM and the subsequent Tunnel
Information message(s).
The (G)MSC server sends the tunnel data received in the IAM to the MGW using
the Tunnel Information Down procedure.
When the MGW sends the Tunnel Information Up procedure, the (G)MSC server
sends the received tunnel data in the Tunnel Information message to the
preceding node.
#### 15.2.2.4 Delayed backward tunnelling
When the MGW sends the Tunnel Information Up procedure, the (G)MSC server
sends the received tunnel data in the Tunnel Information message to the
preceding node (bullet 3 in example, clause 15.4).
When the MGW receives an Nb User Plane Initialisation message (bullet 5a in
example sequence 15.4). before the subsequent Tunnel Information Down
procedure (bullet 6 in example sequence 15.4) , t he MGW may acknowledge this
Nb User Plane Initialisation message without waiting for the Tunnel
Information Down procedure, and send the acknowledge message towards the IP
address and port that were supplied as source within the IP packet
transporting the Nb User Plane Initialisation message (bullet 5b in example
sequence 15.4). The MGW shall use the same RTP Payload-Type number for the
acknowledge message, which was used in the RTP header of the packet
transporting the Nb User Plane Initialisation message.
Alternatively, when the MGW receives an Nb User Plane Initialisation message
(bullet 5a in example sequence 15.4). before the subsequent Tunnel Information
Down procedure (bullet 6 in example sequence 15.4), the MGW may wait for the
Tunnel Information Down procedure, before sending the Nb User Plane
Initialisation acknowledge message (bullet 6a in example sequence 15.4). While
waiting for the Tunnel Information Down procedure, the MGW may receive
repetition(s) of the Nb User Plane Initialisation message and shall not treat
this as error case.
When the (G)MSC server receives a Tunnel Information message from the
preceding node, the (G)MSC server uses the Tunnel Information Down procedure
to send the received tunnel data to the MGW (bullet 6 in example, clause
15.4).
After receiving the Tunnel Information Down procedure (bullet 6 in example
sequence 15.4) and acknowledging the NbFP Init message (bullet 5b or 6a in
example sequence 15.4), the MGW shall notify the MSC server about the bearer
establishment (bullet 7 in example sequence 15.4).
#### 15.2.2.5 Bearer control signalling transfer
The tunnelling of bearer control signalling is transported transparently
through the (G)MSC server during the call establishment and at any other time
until Release is sent or received.
#### 15.2.2.6 Example
Figure 15.3 shows the network model for the backward delayed tunnelling
transport mechanism. The \"squared\" line represents the call control
signalling. The \"dotted\" line represents the bearer control signalling. The
(G)MSCa seizes one context with two bearer terminations in MGWa. The bearer
termination T1 is used for the bearer towards the incoming side of (G)MSCa and
the bearer termination T2 is used for the tunnelling towards the succeeding
MGW. The (G)MSCb seizes one context with two bearer terminations in MGWb. The
bearer termination T3 is used for the bearer towards the outgoing side of
(G)MSCb and the bearer termination T4 is used for the tunnelling towards the
preceding MGW.

Figure 15.3: Delayed Backward Tunnelling Transport Mechanism (network model)
Figure 15.4 shows the message sequence example for backward tunnelling
transport mechanism. In the example the (G)MSCa indicates to MGWa that delayed
tunnelling is requested. After MGWa has responded the (G)MSCa of tunnelling,
the IAM is sent to (G)MSCb. The (G)MSCb indicates to MGWb that delayed
tunnelling is supported. Once MGWb has sent the tunnel data to the (G)MSCb,
the (G)MSCb sends the received tunnel data in the Tunnel Information message
to the (G)MSCa. The (G)MSCa sends the received tunnel data to MGWa. Once MGWa
has sent the tunnel data to the (G)MSCa, the (G)MSCa sends the received tunnel
data in the Tunnel Information message to the (G)MSCb. The (G)MSCb sends the
received tunnel data to MGWb. The handling of Continuity message, through-
connection and answer is as normal for non-tunnelled backward bearer
establishment.

H.248 command in order to perform required transactions. If several logical
procedures are combined, only one context/context request and only one bearer
termination/bearer termination request is sent in the H.248 command. Exemption
is the Change Flow Direction procedure, where the two bearer terminations are
related to a change of the context and not to a command of the bearer
termination. All the procedures below describe a successful operation. If the
procedure is rejected, a Command Reject is sent back to the entity that sent
the command request.

# 17 Bearer Redirect
The BICC [22] Bearer Redirect mechanism may be used for optimising the bearer
path when an endpoint of a call changes due to the operation of an application
layer service.
## 17.1 Example of use of Bearer Redirect with Call Forwarding on No Reply
(CFNRy)
{width="5.13125in" height="2.6in"}
Figure 17.1A: Before CFNRy (Network model)
{width="5.13125in" height="2.6in"}
Figure 17.1B: CFNRy and Bearer Redirect (Network model)
Figure 17.2 shows the message sequence example for the call forwarding on no
reply with Bearer Redirect. In the example, after the call and the bearer
towards the access have been released MSC server A requests the MGW A to
remove the bearer termination for the served mobile subscriber. MSC server A
requests the GMSC server to redirect the bearer to the forwarded to subscriber
(interactions towards the access are not shown), using MSC server A as a call
control anchor. Once the bearer towards MGW B is established the GMSC server
instructs MGW G to connect the incoming bearer to the new bearer (towards MGW
B) and informs MSC server A. Once informed that the new bearer has been
established MSC server A instructs the GMSC server to removes the old bearer
termination (towards MGW A).

Figure 17.2: Information flow for CFNRy with Bearer Redirect (message sequence
chart)
# 18 (G)MSC MGW Tandeming
In all call flow examples a (G)MSC server may tandem (either during call setup
or during an active call, as part of an application layer service invocation)
the bearer through one or more MGWs under its control, in order to access
bearer resources which may be distributed over a number of specialised MGWs.
## 18.1 Example of use of MSC MGW Tandeming during call setup to provide
bearer access to specialised MGW resources
{width="5.13125in" height="2.6in"}
Figure 18.1A: MSC before MGW Tandeming during call setup to provide bearer
access\ to specialised MGW resources (Network model)
{width="5.13125in" height="2.6in"}
Figure 18.1B: MSC after MGW Tandeming during call setup to provide bearer
access\ to specialised MGW resources (Network model)
The figure 18.2 below shows the message sequence example for MSC MGW Tandeming
during call setup to provide bearer access to specialised MGW resources. In
the example, after the signalling towards MSC server A and the bearer towards
the MGW B is established, MSC server A requests the MGW B to tandem the bearer
and terminate it at MGW C, where specialised bearer resources which are not
available at MGW B may be provided.

Start_Bearer_Establishment 1 -- 14 seconds Paging procedure is started.
Applied only if network side bearer establishment is delayed until paging
procedure is completed. Paging procedure is completed or optionally when Call
Confirmed message is received. The network side bearer establishment is
started.

# 20 Multiple IP Realms
Figure 20/1 shows a scenario to support multiple IP realms when the Iu
interface or Nb interface supports IP bearer.
Figure 20/1 Multiple IP realms scenario for Iu or Nb interface
The RAN1, RAN2, CN1 and CN2 represents separate IP realm. The definition of IP
realm is specified in IETF RFC 2663 [41].
The Logical Port 1/2/3/4 represents a logical port connected with the IP realm
in the MGW.
For establishing session when multiple IP realms are used in the MGW, the MGC
may indicate the IP realm identifier to the MGW. The MGW shall assign the IP
termination in the IP realm indicated.
A default IP realm may be configured such that if the MGW has not received the
IP realm identifier and the MGW supports multiple IP realms then the default
IP realm shall be used.
If the MGW does not support the option to indicate an IP realm then it is free
to select an IP port as per implementation permitted in previous releases.
