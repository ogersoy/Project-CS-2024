# 1 Scope
The present document defines an intermediate universal Geographical Area
Description which subscriber applications, GSM or UMTS services can use and
the network can convert into an equivalent radio coverage map.
For GSM or UMTS services which involve the use of an \"area\", it can be
assumed that in the majority of cases the Service Requester will be forbidden
access to data on the radio coverage map of a particular PLMN and that the
Service Requester will not have direct access to network entities (e.g.
BSC/BTS or RNC/Node B).
The interpretation by the PLMN operator of the geographical area in terms of
cells actually used, cells that are partly within the given area and all other
technical and quality of service aspects are out of the scope of the present
document.
This specification also provides a description of velocity that may be
associated with a universal Geographical Area Description when both are
applied to a common entity at a common time.

GPS Global Positioning System
WGS World Geodetic System
# 4 Reference system
The reference system chosen for the coding of locations is the World Geodetic
System 1984, (WGS 84), which is also used by the Global Positioning System,
(GPS). The origin of the WGS 84 co-ordinate system is the geometric centre of
the WGS 84 ellipsoid. The ellipsoid is constructed by the rotation of an
ellipse around the minor axis which is oriented in the North-South direction.
The rotation axis is the polar axis of the ellipsoid, and the plane orthogonal
to it and including the centre of symmetry is the equatorial plane.
The relevant dimensions are as follows:
Major Axis (a) = 6378137 m
Minor Axis (b) = 6356752,314 m
First eccentricity of the ellipsoid
Co-ordinates are then expressed in terms of longitude and latitude relevant to
this ellipsoid. The range of longitude is ‑180° to +180°, and the range of
latitude is -90° to +90°. 0° longitude corresponds to the Greenwich Meridian,
and positive angles are to the East, while negative angles are to the West. 0°
latitude corresponds to the equator, and positive angles are to the North,
while negative angles are to the South. Altitudes are defined as the distance
between the ellipsoid and the point, along a line orthogonal to the ellipsoid.
# 5 Shapes
The intention is to incorporate a number of different shapes, that can be
chosen according to need.
\- Ellipsoid Point;
\- Ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle;
\- Ellipsoid point with uncertainty ellipse;
\- Polygon;
  * Ellipsoid point with altitude;
  * Ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid;
  * Ellipsoid Arc.
Each shape is discussed individually.
## 5.1 Ellipsoid Point
The description of an ellipsoid point is that of a point on the surface of the
ellipsoid, and consists of a latitude and a longitude. In practice, such a
description can be used to refer to a point on Earth's surface, or close to
Earth's surface, with the same longitude and latitude. No provision is made in
this version of the standard to give the height of a point.
Figure 1 illustrates a point on the surface of the ellipsoid and its co-
ordinates.
The latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and the perpendicular
to the plane tangent to the ellipsoid surface at the point. Positive latitudes
correspond to the North hemisphere. The longitude is the angle between the
half-plane determined by the Greenwich meridian and the half-plane defined by
the point and the polar axis, measured Eastward.

## 5.2 Ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle
The \"ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle\" is characterised by the co-
ordinates of an ellipsoid point (the origin) and a distance _r_. It describes
formally the set of points on the ellipsoid which are at a distance from the
origin less than or equal to _r_ , the distance being the geodesic distance
over the ellipsoid, i.e., the minimum length of a path staying on the
ellipsoid and joining the two points, as shown in figure 2.
As for the ellipsoid point, this can be used to indicate points on the Earth
surface, or near the Earth surface, of same latitude and longitude.
The typical use of this shape is to indicate a point when its position is
known only with a limited accuracy.
Figure 2: Description of an uncertainty Circle
## 5.3 Ellipsoid point with uncertainty ellipse
The \"ellipsoid point with uncertainty ellipse\" is characterised by the co-
ordinates of an ellipsoid point (the origin), distances _r1_ and _r2_ and an
angle of orientation _A_. It describes formally the set of points on the
ellipsoid which fall within or on the boundary of an ellipse with semi-major
axis of length _r1_ oriented at angle _A_ (0 to 180^o^) measure clockwise from
north and semi-minor axis of length _r2_ , the distances being the geodesic
distance over the ellipsoid, i.e., the minimum length of a path staying on the
ellipsoid and joining the two points, as shown in figure 2a.
As for the ellipsoid point, this can be used to indicate points on the Earth's
surface, or near the Earth's surface, of same latitude and longitude. The
confidence level with which the position of a target entity is included within
this set of points is also included with this shape.
The typical use of this shape is to indicate a point when its position is
known only with a limited accuracy, but the geometrical contributions to
uncertainty can be quantified.

## 5.4 Polygon
A polygon is an arbitrary shape described by an ordered series of points (in
the example pictured in the drawing, A to E). The minimum number of points
allowed is 3, and the maximum number of points allowed is 15. The points shall
be connected in the order that they are given. A connecting line is defined as
the line over the ellipsoid joining the two points and of minimum distance
(geodesic). The last point is connected to the first. The list of points shall
respect a number of conditions:
\- a connecting line shall not cross another connecting line;
\- two successive points must not be diametrically opposed on the ellipsoid.
The described area is situated to the right of the lines with the downward
direction being toward the Earth's centre and the forward direction being from
a point to the next.
NOTE: This definition does not permit connecting lines greater than roughly 20
000 km. If such a need arises, the polygon can be described by adding an
intermediate point.
Computation of geodesic lines is not simple. Approximations leading to a
maximum distance between the computed line and the geodesic line of less than
3 metres are acceptable.

## 5.5 Ellipsoid Point with Altitude
The description of an ellipsoid point with altitude is that of a point at a
specified distance above or below a point on the earth's surface. This is
defined by an ellipsoid point with the given longitude and latitude and the
altitude above or below the ellipsoid point. Figure 3a illustrates the
altitude aspect of this description.
> Figure 3a: Description of an Ellipsoid Point with Altitude
## 5.6 Ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid
The \"ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid\" is
characterised by the co-ordinates of an ellipsoid point with altitude,
distances r1 (the \"semi-major uncertainty\"), r2 (the \"semi-minor
uncertainty\") and r3 (the \"vertical uncertainty\") and an angle of
orientation _A_ (the \"angle of the major axis\")_._ It describes formally the
set of points which fall within or on the surface of a general (three
dimensional) ellipsoid centred on an ellipsoid point with altitude whose real
semi-major, semi-mean and semi-minor axis are some permutation of r1, r2, r3
with r1 ≥ r2. The r3 axis is aligned vertically, while the r1 axis, which is
the semi-major axis of the ellipse in a horizontal plane that bisects the
ellipsoid, is oriented at an angle _A_ (0 to 180 degrees) measured clockwise
from north, as illustrated in Figure 3b.
> Figure 3b: Description of an Ellipsoid Point with Altitude and Uncertainty
> Ellipsoid
The typical use of this shape is to indicate a point when its horizontal
position and altitude are known only with a limited accuracy, but the
geometrical contributions to uncertainty can be quantified. The confidence
level with which the position of a target entity is included within the shape
is also included.
## 5.7 Ellipsoid Arc
An ellipsoid arc is a shape characterised by the co-ordinates of an ellipsoid
point _o_ (the origin), inner radius _r1,_ uncertainty radius _r2_ , both
radii being geodesic distances over the surface of the ellipsoid, the offset
angle (θ) between the first defining radius of the ellipsoid arc and North,
and the included angle (β) being the angle between the first and second
defining radii. The offset angle is within the range of 0° to 359,999...°
while the included angle is within the range from 0,000...1° to 360°. This is
to be able to describe a full circle, 0° to 360°.
This shape-definition can also be used to describe a sector (inner radius
equal to zero), a circle (included angle equal to 360°) and other circular
shaped areas. The confidence level with which the position of a target entity
is included within the shape is also included.

# 6 Coding
## 6.1 Point
The co-ordinates of an ellipsoid point are coded with an uncertainty of less
than 3 metres.
The latitude is coded with 24 bits: 1 bit of sign and a number between 0 and
2^23^-1 coded in binary on 23 bits. The relation between the coded number N
and the range of (absolute) latitudes X it encodes is the following (X in
degrees):
$N \leq \frac{2^{\text{23}}}{\text{90}}X  except for N=2^15^-1 for which the range is extended to include all greater
> values of _a._
The direction of altitude is encoded by a single bit with bit value 0
representing height above the WGS84 ellipsoid surface and bit value 1
representing depth below the WGS84 ellipsoid surface.
## 6.4 Uncertainty Altitude
The uncertainty in altitude, h, expressed in metres is mapped from the binary
number K, with the following formula:
{width="1.0555555555555556in" height="0.25in"}
with _C_ = 45 and _x_ = 0,025. With 0 ≤ K ≤ 127, a suitably useful range
between 0 and 990 meters is achieved for the uncertainty altitude. The
uncertainty can then be coded on 7 bits, as the binary encoding of K.
Table 2: Example values for the uncertainty altitude Function
* * *
Value of K Value of uncertainty altitude 0 0 m 1 1,13 m 2 2,28 m \- - 20 28,7
m \- - 40 75,8 m \- - 60 153,0 m \- - 80 279,4 m \- - 100 486,6 m \- - 120
826,1 m \- - 127 990,5 m
* * *
## 6.5 Confidence
The confidence by which the position of a target entity is known to be within
the shape description, (expressed as a percentage) is directly mapped from the
7 bit binary number K, except for K=0 which is used to indicate 'no
information', and 100 \ Except for N=2^16^-1 for which the range is extended to include all greater
> values of _r._ This provides a true maximum radius of 327,675 meters.
The uncertainty radius is encoded as for the uncertainty latitude and
longitude.
## 6.7 Angle
Offset and Included angle are encoded in increments of 2° using an 8 bit
binary coded number N in the range 0 to 179. The relation between the number N
and the range offset (ao) and included (ai) of angles (in degrees) it encodes
is described by the following equations:
