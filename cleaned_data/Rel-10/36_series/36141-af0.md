# 4 General test conditions and declarations
Many of the tests in this specification measure a parameter relative to a
value that is not fully specified in the E-UTRA specifications. For these
tests, the Minimum Requirement is determined relative to a nominal value
specified by the manufacturer.
Certain functions of a BS are optional in the E-UTRA specifications. Some
requirements for the BS may be regional as listed in subclause 4.3.
When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal value of
a parameter, or whether an option is supported.
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and Test Requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification.
The Minimum Requirements are given in 36.104 [2] and test requirements are
given in this specification. Test Tolerances are defined in Annex G of this
specification. Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The
Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in 36.104 [2] to
create Test Requirements.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the stimulus
signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified tolerance and
the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the
specified values. All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and
are valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the Shared Risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 [3].
The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the measurement of
each parameter shall be included in the test report.
The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in subclause 4.1.2
of this specification.
If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in subclause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to use
this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.
Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified in
subclause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the Test Requirement, making the test
harder to pass. (For some tests e.g. receiver tests, this may require
modification of stimulus signals). This procedure (defined in Annex G) will
ensure that a Test System not compliant with subclause 4.1.2 does not increase
the chance of passing a device under test where that device would otherwise
have failed the test if a Test System compliant with subclause 4.1.2 had been
used.
## 4.2 Base station classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Station, Local
Area Base Station and Home Base Station unless other wise stated.
Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 70 dB. The Wide
Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the base station for
General Purpose application in Release 8.
Local Area Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell** scenarios with **a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB**.
Home Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Femto
Cell** scenarios.
The manufacturer shall declare the intended class of the BS under test.
## 4.3 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements or set by local and regional regulation as
mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances that the requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.3-1 lists all requirements that may be applied differently in
different regions.
Table 4.3-1: List of regional requirements

applied regionally. 5.6 Channel bandwidth Some channel bandwidths may be
applied regionally. 5.7 Channel arrangement The requirement is applied
according to what operating bands in Clause 5.5 that are supported by the BS.
6.2. Base station maximum output power In certain regions, the minimum
requirement for normal conditions may apply also for some conditions outside
the range of conditions defined as normal. In certain regions, additional
regional requirement specified in subclause 6.2.2 in [1] is applied for rated
output power declared by the manufacturer. 6.6.3.5.1 Operating band unwanted
emissions (Category A) This requirement is mandatory for regions where
Category A limits for spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation
SM.329 [5] apply. 6.6.3.5.2 Operating band unwanted emissions (Category B)
This requirement is mandatory for regions where Category B limits for spurious
emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [5], apply. 6.6.3.5.3
Additional requirements These requirements may apply in certain regions as
additional Operating band unwanted emission limits. 6.6.4.5.1 Spurious
emissions (Category A) This requirement is mandatory for regions where
Category A limits for spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation
SM.329 [5] apply. 6.6.4.5.2 Spurious emissions (Category B) This requirement
is mandatory for regions where Category B limits for spurious emissions, as
defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [5], apply. 6.6.4.5.4 Additional
spurious emission requirements These requirements may be applied for the
protection of system operating in frequency ranges other than the E-UTRA BS
operating band. 6.6.4.5.5 Co-location with other base stations These
requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers when a BS
operating in another frequency band is co‑located with an E‑UTRA BS. 7.6.5.2
Co-location with other base stations These requirements may be applied for the
protection of the BS receivers when a BS operating in another frequency band
is co‑-located with an E-UTRA BS.
* * *
## 4.4 Selection of configurations for testing
Most tests in the present document are only performed for a subset of the
possible combinations of test conditions. For instance:
\- Not all transceivers in the configuration may be specified to be tested;
\- Only one RF channel may be specified to be tested;
\- Not all channel bandwidths may be specified to be tested.
## 4.5 BS Configurations
### 4.5.1 Transmit configurations
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics in clause 6 are
specified at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any
external apparatus such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test
port B).
Figure 4.5-1: Transmitter test ports
#### 4.5.1.1 Transmission with multiple transmitter antenna connectors
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present document,
the requirement applies for each transmitter antenna connector in the case of
transmission with multiple transmitter antenna connectors.
Transmitter requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the
remaining antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the transmitter paths to be equivalent, it is sufficient to measure
the signal at any one of the transmitter antenna connectors,.
### 4.5.2 Receive configurations
Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics in clause 7 are
specified at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any
external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test
port B).
Figure 4.5-2: Receiver test ports
#### 4.5.2.1 Reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors, receiver
diversity
For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement applies at
each receiver antenna connector for receivers with antenna diversity or in the
case of multi-carrier reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors.
Receiver requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the remaining
receiver(s) disabled or their antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the
manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be equivalent, it is
sufficient to apply the specified test signal at any one of the receiver
antenna connectors.
### 4.5.3 Duplexers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer fitted,
if a duplexer is supplied as part of the BS. If the duplexer is supplied as an
option by the manufacturer, sufficient tests should be repeated with and
without the duplexer fitted to verify that the BS meets the requirements of
the present document in both cases.
The following tests shall be performed with the duplexer fitted, and without
it fitted if this is an option:
1) subclause 6.2, base station output power, for the highest static power step
only, if this is measured at the antenna connector;
2) subclause 6.6, unwanted emissions; outside the BS transmit band;
3) subclause 6.6.4.5.3, protection of the BS receiver;
4) subclause 6.7, transmit intermodulation; for the testing of conformance,
the carrier frequencies should be selected to minimize intermodulation
products from the transmitters falling in receive channels.
The remaining tests may be performed with or without the duplexer fitted.
NOTE 1: When performing receiver tests with a duplexer fitted, it is important
to ensure that the output from the transmitters does not affect the test
apparatus. This can be achieved using a combination of attenuators, isolators
and filters.
NOTE 2: When duplexers are used, intermodulation products will be generated,
not only in the duplexer but also in the antenna system. The intermodulation
products generated in the antenna system are not controlled by 3GPP
specifications, and may degrade during operation (e.g. due to moisture
ingress). Therefore, to ensure continued satisfactory operation of a BS, an
operator will normally select EARFCNs to minimize intermodulation products
falling on receive channels. For testing of complete conformance, an operator
may specify the EARFCNs to be used.
### 4.5.4 Power supply options
If the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply configurations,
it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each of the power supply
options, provided that it can be demonstrated that the range of conditions
over which the equipment is tested is at least as great as the range of
conditions due to any of the power supply configurations.
This applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be supplied
either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In this case, the
conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power supply options can be
tested by testing only the external DC supply option. The range of DC input
voltages for the test should be sufficient to verify the performance with any
of the power supplies, over its range of operating conditions within the BS,
including variation of mains input voltage, temperature and output current.
### 4.5.5 Ancillary RF amplifiers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with the ancillary RF
amplifier fitted. At tests according to clauses 6 and 7 for TX and RX
respectively, the ancillary amplifier is connected to the BS by a connecting
network (including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with applicable loss to
make sure the appropriate operating conditions of the ancillary amplifier and
the BS. The applicable connecting network loss range is declared by the
manufacturer. Other characteristics and the temperature dependence of the
attenuation of the connecting network are neglected. The actual attenuation
value of the connecting network is chosen for each test as one of the
applicable extreme values. The lowest value is used unless otherwise stated.
Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted and,
if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify that the BS
meets the requirements of the present document in both cases.
When testing, the following tests shall be repeated with the optional
ancillary amplifier fitted according to the table below, where x denotes that
the test is applicable:
Table 4.5-1: Tests applicable to Ancillary RF Amplifiers
* * *
Receiver Tests Subclause TX amplifier only RX amplifier only TX/RX amplifiers
combined (Note) 7.2 X X 7.5 (Narrowband blocking) X X 7.6 X X 7.7 x X 7.8 x  
Transmitter Tests 6.2 x X 6.6.1 X X 6.6.2 X x 6.6.3 X x 6.6.4 x X 6.7 x X
* * *
NOTE: Combining can be by duplex filters or any other network. The amplifiers
can either be in RX or TX branch or in both. Either one of these amplifiers
could be a passive network.
In test according to subclauses 6.2 and 7.2 highest applicable attenuation
value is applied.
### 4.5.6 BS with integrated Iuant BS modem
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the integrated
Iuant BS modem shall be switched off. Spurious emissions according to clauses
6.6.4 and 7.7 shall be measured only for frequencies above 20MHz with the
integrated Iuant BS modem switched on.
### 4.5.7 BS using antenna arrays
A BS may be configured with a multiple antenna port connection for some or all
of its transceivers or with an antenna array related to one cell (not one
array per transceiver). This subclause applies to a BS which meets at least
one of the following conditions:
\- the transmitter output signals from one or more transceiver appear at more
than one antenna port; or
\- there is more than one receiver antenna port for a transceiver or per cell
and an input signal is required at more than one port for the correct
operation of the receiver thus the outputs from the transmitters as well as
the inputs to the receivers are directly connected to several antennas (known
as \"aircombining\"); or
\- transmitters and receivers are connected via duplexers to more than one
antenna.
In case of diversity or spatial multiplexing, multiple antennas are not
considered as an antenna array.
If a BS is used, in normal operation, in conjunction with an antenna system
which contains filters or active elements which are necessary to meet the
E-UTRA requirements, the conformance tests may be performed on a system
comprising the BS together with these elements, supplied separately for the
purposes of testing. In this case, it must be demonstrated that the
performance of the configuration under test is representative of the system in
normal operation, and the conformance assessment is only applicable when the
BS is used with the antenna system.
For conformance testing of such a BS, the following procedure may be used.
#### 4.5.7.1 Receiver tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the receiver antenna connectors
shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied equals the
power of the test signal(s) specified in the test.
An example of a suitable test configuration is shown in figure 4.5.7.1-1.
.
Figure 4.5.7.1-1: Receiver test set-up
For spurious emissions from the receiver antenna connector, the test may be
performed separately for each receiver antenna connector.
#### 4.5.7.2 Transmitter tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the transmitter antenna connectors
**(P~i~)** shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied
equals the power of the test signal(s) **(P~s~)** specified in the test. This
may be assessed by separately measuring the signals emitted by each antenna
connector and summing the results, or by combining the signals and performing
a single measurement. The characteristics (e.g. amplitude and phase) of the
combining network should be such that the power of the combined signal is
maximised.
An example of a suitable test configuration is shown in figure 4.5.7.2-1.
Figure 4.5.7.2-1: Transmitter test set-up
For Intermodulation attenuation, the test may be performed separately for each
transmitter antenna connector.

## 4.10 Test configuration for non-single carrier operations
### 4.10.1 General test configuration
The purpose of the general multi-carrier test configuration is to test all BS
requirements excluding CA occupied bandwidth.
For test configurations used in receiver tests only the two outermost carriers
within each supported operating band need to be generated by the test
equipment.
#### 4.10.1.1 Test configuration generation
The general test configuration should be constructed on a per band basis using
the following method:
\- Declared maximum supported RF bandwidth shall be used;
\- Select the narrowest supported carrier and place it adjacent to the low
edge of the RF bandwidth. Place a 5 MHz carrier adjacent to the high edge of
the RF bandwidth.
\- For transmitter tests, select as many 5 MHz carriers that the BS supports
within a band and fit in the rest of the declared maximum supported RF
bandwidth. Place the carriers adjacent to each other starting from the high RF
bandwidth edge. The nominal carrier spacing defined in clause 5.7 shall apply;
\- If 5 MHz carriers are not supported by the BS the narrowest supported
channel BW shall be selected instead.
The test configuration should be constructed on a per band basis for all
component carriers of the inter-band CA bands declared to be supported by the
BS and are transmitted using the same antenna port. All configured component
carriers are transmitted simultaneously in the tests where the transmitter
should be on.
#### 4.10.1.2 Test configuration power allocation
_For a BS declared to support MC operation,_
Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the rated total output power according to the manufacturer's
declaration in sub clause 4.6.8.
_For a BS declared to support only CA operation,_
Set the power spectral density of each carrier to the same level so that the
sum of the carrier powers equals the rated total output power according to the
manufacturer's declaration in sub clause 4.6.8.
### 4.10.2 CA specific test configuration
The test configuration in this clause is used to test CA occupied bandwidth.
#### 4.10.2.1 Test configuration generation
The CA specific test configuration should be constructed on a per band basis
using the following method:
\- All CC combinations supported by the BS, which have different sum of
channel bandwidth of CC, shall be tested. For all CC combinations which have
the same sum of channel bandwidth of CC, only one of the CC combinations shall
be tested.
\- Of all CC combinations which have same sum of channel bandwidth of CC,
select those with the narrowest carrier at the lower edge.
\- Of the combinations selected in the previous step, select one with the
narrowest carrier at the higher edge.
\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select the
one with the smallest number of CC.
\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select the
one with the widest carrier being adjacent to the lowest carrier.
\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select the
one with the widest carrier being adjacent to the highest carrier
\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, select the
one with the widest carrier being adjacent to the carrier which has been
selected in the previous step.
\- If there are multiple combinations fulfilling previous steps, repeat the
previous step until there is only one combination left.
\- The nominal carrier spacing defined in clause 5.7.1A shall apply.
#### 4.10.2.2 Test configuration power allocation
Set the power spectral density of each carrier to be the same level so that
the sum of the carrier powers equals the rated total output power for E-UTRA
according to the manufacturer's declaration in sub clause 4.6.8.

The lower edge of the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth (BW~Channel_CA~) is defined
as F~edge_low~ = F~C_low~ - F~offset~. The higher edge of the aggregated
channel bandwidth is defined as F~edge_high~ = F~C_high~ + F~offset~. The
Aggregated Channel Bandwidth, **BW~Channel_CA,~** is defined as follows:
BW~Channel_CA~ = F~edge_high~ - F~edge_low~ [MHz]

NOTE 1: F~offset~ is calculated separately for the Lower Edge and the Higher
Edge of the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth.
NOTE 2: The values of BW~Channel_CA~ for UE and BS are the same if the lowest
and the highest component carriers are identical.
## 5.7 Channel arrangement
### 5.7.1 Channel spacing
The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the size
of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The nominal
channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined as following:
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted to optimize
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.7.1A CA Channel spacing
For intra-band contiguously aggregated carriers the channel spacing between
adjacent component carriers shall be multiple of 300 kHz.
The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated E-UTRA carriers is
defined as follows:
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA component carriers according to Table 5.6-1 with values in
MHz. The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation can be
adjusted to any multiple of 300 kHz less than the nominal channel spacing to
optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.7.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the carrier
centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz.
### 5.7.3 Carrier frequency and EARFCN
The carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the E-UTRA
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 - 65535\. The
relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the downlink is
given by the following equation, where F~DL_low~ and N~Offs-DL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1 and N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN.
F~DL~ = F~DL_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)
The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the uplink is
given by the following equation where F~UL_low~ and N~Offs-UL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1 and N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN.
F~UL~ = F~UL_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~)

# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in Clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. BS
configurations for the tests are defined in Clause 4.5, while Annex H provides
an informative description of E-UTRAN test cases.
#### 6.1.1 E-UTRA Test Models
The set-up of physical channels for transmitter tests shall be according to
one of the E-UTRA test models (E-TM) below. A reference to the applicable test
model is made within each test.
The following general parameters are used by all E-UTRA test models:
\- The test models are defined for a single antenna port (using p = 0); 1 code
word (q = 0), 1 layer, precoding is not used
\- Duration is 10 subframes (10 ms)
\- Normal CP
\- Virtual resource blocks of localized type, no intra-subframe hopping for
PDSCH
\- UE-specific reference signals are not used
Power settings of physical channels are defined by physical channel EPRE
relative to the EPRE of the RS. The relative accuracy of the physical channel
EPRE as referred to the EPRE of the RS shall have a tolerance of ±0.5 dB.
For E-UTRA TDD, test models are derived based on the uplink/downlink
configuration 3 and special subframe configuration 8 defined in TS36.211, i.e.
as showing in the table 6.1.1-1. Number of frames for the test models is 2.

#### 6.1.1.1 E-UTRA Test Model 1.1 (E-TM1.1)
This model shall be used for tests on:
• BS output power
• Unwanted emissions
• Occupied bandwidth
• ACLR
• Operating band unwanted emissions
• Transmitter spurious emissions
• Transmitter intermodulation
• RS absolute accuracy

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should
be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result
should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

after end of one transmitter ON period + 17μs to 35μs before start of next
transmitter ON period -- 17μs.
3) For BS supporting contiguous CA, measure the the mean power spectral
density over 70μs filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
Aggregated Channel Bandwidth **BW~Channel_CA~ centred on

Connect the signal analyzer to the base station antenna connector as shown in
Annex I.1.1.
##### 6.5.4.4.2 Procedure
Set-up BS transmission at maximum total power (Pmax) as specified by the
supplier. Channel set-up shall be according to E-TM 1.1.
Measure the RS transmitted power according to annex F.
#### 6.5.4.5 Test requirement
DL RS power of each E-UTRA carrier shall be:
within ± 2.9 dB of the DL RS power indicated on the DL-SCH for carrier
frequency f ≤ 3.0GHz.
within ± 3.2 dB of the DL RS power indicated on the DL-SCH for carrier
frequency 3.0GHz \20 Span [MHz] 10 10 10

height="0.475in"}
* * *
NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any effect on
the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW power are the same
as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected to have the Rayleigh
distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In any case where the
statistics are not the same, though, the detection mode must be power
responding. The analyser may be set to respond to the average of the power
(root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement cell.
2) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel units) of
all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1, the power
outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the total power
outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied percentage)) of P0.
For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005 times P0.
3) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds P1.
4) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from f2 to the end of the span exceeds P1.
5) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.
#### 6.6.1.5 Test requirements
The occupied bandwidth for each E-UTRA carrier shall be less than the channel
bandwidth as defined in Table 5.6-1. For contiguous CA, t**he occupied
bandwidth shall be less than or equal the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth as
defined in subclause 5.6**.
NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test and the explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed
by the Test Tolerance are given in Annex G.
### 6.6.2 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)

power centered on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power
centered on an adjacent channel frequency.
The requirements shall apply outside the Base Station RF bandwidth edges
whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier or multi-carrier).
It applies for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification. The requirement applies during the transmitter ON period.

or Table 6.6.2-2 (Unpaired spectrum case) respectively. In multiple carrier
case only offset frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier
frequency used shall be measured.
2) Repeat the test with the channel set-up according to E-TM1.2.
#### 6.6.2.5 Test Requirement

### 6.6.3 Operating band unwanted emissions
#### 6.6.3.1 Definition and applicability
Unless otherwise stated, the Operating band unwanted emission limits are
defined from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the downlink operating band
up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the downlink operating band (see
Table 5.5-1).
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by
the manufacturer\'s specification.
The unwanted emission limits in the part of the downlink operating band that
falls in the spurious domain are consistent with ITU-R Recommendation SM.329
[5].
For a multicarrier E-UTRA BS or BS configured for intra-band contiguous
carrier aggregation the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the
carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency and the higher edge of the
carrier transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a specified
operating band.
For Wide Area BS, the requirements of either subclause 6.6.3.5.1 (Category A
limits) or subclause 6.6.3.5.2 (Category B limits) shall apply.
For Local Area BS, the requirements of subclause 6.6.3.5.2A shall apply
(Category A and B).
For Home BS, the requirements of subclause 6.6.3.5.2X shall apply (Category A
and B).
The application of either Category A or Category B limits shall be the same as
for Transmitter spurious emissions (Mandatory Requirements) in subclause
6.6.4.5.
For Category B Operating band unwanted emissions, there are two options for
the limits that may be applied regionally. Either the limits in subclause
6.6.3.5.2.1 or subclause 6.6.3.5.2.2 shall be applied.
#### 6.6.3.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 6.6.3.
#### 6.6.3.3 Test purpose
This test measures the emissions of the BS, close to the assigned channel
bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.
#### 6.6.3.4 Method of test
##### 6.6.3.4.1 Initial conditions

in Annex I.1.1.
> As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
> should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
> measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
> leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
> bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
> bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in
> order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
2) Detection mode: True RMS.

1) Set the BS transmission at maximum total power (Pmax) as specified by the
supplier. Channel set-up shall be according to E-TM 1.1.
2) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and
measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges with the specified
measurement bandwidth.
3) Repeat the test with the channel set-up according to E-TM 1.2
#### 6.6.3.5 Test requirement
The measurement results in step 2 of 6.6.3.4.2 shall not exceed the maximum
levels specified in the tables below, where:
\- ∆f is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the nominal
-3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the
centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the downlink
operating band.
\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.
##### 6.6.3.5.1 Test requirements for Wide Area BS (Category A)

##### 6.6.4.5.4 Co-existence with other systems in the same geographical area
##### 6.6.4.5.4.1 Void {#void-5 .H6}
These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the E-UTRA BS operating band. The limits may apply
as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same
geographical area as the E-UTRA BS, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an E-UTRA operating band. It is in
some cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is
mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this
is set by local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements
in the present document is given in Clause 4.3.
Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS
and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM, CDMA, UTRA,
E-UTRA, etc.) as listed below. The power of any spurious emission shall not
exceed the limits of Table 6.6.4.5.4-1 for a BS where requirements for co-
existence with the system listed in the first column apply.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, except
for Band 25, the co-existence requirements in Table 6.6.4.5.4-1 do not apply
for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the downlink operating band
(see Table 5.5-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be
covered by local or regional requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.4.5.4-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the
same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are
synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without
additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.4.5.4-1a for a Home BS where requirements for co-existence with a Home BS
type listed in the first column apply.

frequency range may be covered by local or regional requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.4.5.4-1a assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 5.5-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the
same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are
synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without
additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between 10 MHz
below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and
10 MHz above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating
band (see Table 5.5-1).
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

##### 6.6.4.5.5 Co-location with other base stations
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with an E-UTRA BS.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.4.5.5-1 for a Wide Area BS where requirements for co-location with a BS

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in Table 6.6.4.5.5-1 and Table 6.6.4.5.5-2 do not apply
for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency
range of a downlink operating band (see Table 5.5-1). The current state-of-
the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location
with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30dB BS-BS minimum coupling
loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used.
These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [11].
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.4.5.5-1 and Table 6.6.4.5.5-2 assume that two operating
bands, where the corresponding eNode B transmit and receive frequency ranges
in Table 5.3-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical
area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in
the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that
are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
## 6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability
The transmit intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of the
transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non linear elements
caused by presence of the own transmit signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter via the antenna. The requirement applies during the
transmitter ON period and the transmitter transient period.
The transmit intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when an E-UTRA signal of channel bandwidth 5 MHz as an interfering
signal is injected into an antenna connector at a mean power level of 30 dB
lower than that of the mean power of the wanted signal.
The wanted signal is E-UTRA single carrier, or multi-carrier, or multiple
contiguously aggregated carriers. The interfering signal centre frequency
offset from the wanted signal carrier centre frequency shall be as in Table
6.7.1-1.
Table 6.7.1-1 Interfering signal centre frequency offset from wanted signal
carrier centre frequency
+--------------------------------------------------------+------------+ | Parameter | Value | +--------------------------------------------------------+------------+ | Interfering signal centre frequency offset from the | ± 2.5 MHz | | lower (higher) edge of the wanted signal | | | | ± 7.5 MHz | | | | | | ± 12.5 MHz | +--------------------------------------------------------+------------+ | NOTE 1: Interfering signal positions that are | | | partially or completely outside of the downlink | | | operating band of the base station are excluded from | | | the requirement, unless the interfering signal | | | positions fall within the frequency range of adjacent | | | downlink operating bands in the same geographical | | | area. | | | | | | NOTE 2: NOTE 1 is not applied in Band 1, 3, 8, 9, 11, | | | 18, 19, 21, 34 in certain regions. | | +--------------------------------------------------------+------------+
The wanted signal channel bandwidth BW~Channel~ shall be the maximum channel
bandwidth supported by the base station.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.
In case that none of the interfering signal positions according to the
conditions of Table 6.7.1-1 is applicable, a wanted signal channel bandwidth
BW~Channel~ less than the maximum channel bandwidth supported by the base
station shall be selected so that at least one applicable interfering signal
position according to Table 6.7.1-1 is obtained. If the BS does not support
any channel bandwidths less than the maximum supported bandwidth, an
interfering signal outside or partly outside the downlink operating band shall
used.
### 6.7.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 6.7.1.
### 6.7.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS transmitter to restrict
the generation of intermodulation products in its non linear elements caused
by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna to below specified levels.
### 6.7.4 Method of test
#### 6.7.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex D.2.
RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 4.7.
RF bandwidth position to be tested: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~; see
subclause 4.7.1.
Connect the signal analyzer to the base station antenna connector as shown in
Annex I.1.2.
#### 6.7.4.2 Procedures
1) Generate the wanted signal according to E-TM1.1 at specified maximum output
power, Pmax.
2) Generate the interfering signal according to E-TM1.1, with 5 MHz channel
bandwidth and a centre frequency offset according to the conditions of Table
6.7.1-1.
3) Adjust ATT1 so that level of the E-UTRA modulated interfering signal is as
defined in subclause 6.7.5.
4) Perform the Out-of-band emission tests as specified in subclauses 6.6.2 and
6.6.3, for all third and fifth order intermodulation products which appear in
the frequency ranges defined in subclauses 6.6.2 and 6.6.3. The width of the
intermodulation products shall be taken into account.
5) Perform the Transmitter spurious emissions test as specified in subclause
6.6.4, for all third and fifth order intermodulation products which appear in
the frequency ranges defined in subclause 6.6.4. The width of the
intermodulation products shall be taken into account.
6) Verify that the emission level does not exceed the required level with the
exception of interfering signal frequencies.
7) Repeat the test for the remaining interfering signal centre frequency
offset s according to the conditions of Table 6.7.1-1.
NOTE: The third order intermodulation products are centred at 2F1±F2 and
2F2±F1. The fifth order intermodulation products are centred at 3F1±2F2,
3F2±2F1, 4F1±F2, and 4F2±F1 where F1 represents the wanted signal centre
frequency and F2 represents the interfering signal centre frequency.\ The
width of intermodulation products are
\- (n*BW~Channel~ + m*5MHz) for the nF1±mF2 products
\- (n*5MHz + m*BW~Channel~) for the nF2±mF1 products
### 6.7.5 Test Requirements
In the frequency range relevant for this test, the transmit intermodulation
level shall not exceed the out-of-band emission requirements of subclauses
6.6.2 and 6.6.3 and transmitter spurious emissions requirements of subclause
6.6.4 in the presence of a E-UTRA modulated interfering signal with a mean
power 30 dB below the mean power of the wanted signal.
The measurements for out-of-band emissions and spurious emission requirements
due to intermodulation can be limited to the frequency ranges of all third and
fifth order intermodulation products, excluding the channel bandwidths of the
wanted and interfering signals.
NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test is defined in Annex G. The explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex G.
# 7 Receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
General test conditions for receiver tests are given in Clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. BS
configurations for the tests are defined in Clause 4.5, while Annex H provides
an informative description of E-UTRAN test cases.
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 7 apply during the base
station receive period.
The throughput requirements defined for the receiver characteristics in this
clause do not assume HARQ transmissions.
When the BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the throughput
requirements are applicable for each received carrier. For ACS, blocking and
intermodulation characteristics, the negative offsets of the interfering
signal apply relative to the lower edge and positive offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the higher edge.
## 7.2 Reference sensitivity level
### 7.2.1 Definition and applicability
The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power
received at the antenna connector at which a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel.
The test is set up according to Annex I.2.1 and performed without interfering
signal power applied to the BS antenna connector. For duplex operation, the
measurement configuration principle is indicated for one duplex branch in
Annex I.2.1. The reference point for signal power is at the input of the
receiver (antenna connector).
### 7.2.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 7.2.1.
### 7.2.3 Test purpose
To verify that at the BS Reference sensitivity level the throughput
requirement shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel.
### 7.2.4 Method of testing
#### 7.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see subclause D.2
RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 4.7.

## 7.6 Blocking
### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability
The blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver ability to receive a
wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted
interferer, which are either a 1.4MHz, 3MHz or 5MHz E-UTRA signal for in‑band
blocking or a CW signal for out-of-band blocking. The interfering E-UTRA
signal shall be as specified in Annex C.
The blocking performance requirement applies as specified in the Tables 7.6-1,
7.6-1a, 7.6-1b and 7.6-2 in clause 7.6.5.
### 7.6.2 Minimum Requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 7.6.1.
### 7.6.3 Test purpose
The test stresses the ability of the BS receiver to withstand high-level
interference from unwanted signals at specified frequency offsets without
undue degradation of its sensitivity.
### 7.6.4 Method of test
#### 7.6.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: M see subclause 4.7. The BS shall be configured to
operate as close to the centre of the operating band (see Table 5.5-1) as
possible.
RF bandwidth position to be tested: M~RFBW~, see subclause 4.7.1.
Channel bandwidths to be tested:
> a) In the interferer frequency range (F~UL_low~ -20) MHz to (F~UL_high~ +20)
> MHz the requirement shall be tested with the lowest and the highest
> bandwidth supported by the BS.
>
> b) In the interferer frequency ranges 1 MHz to (F~UL_low~ -20) MHz and
> (F~UL_high~ +20) MHz to 12750 MHz the requirement shall be tested only with
> the lowest bandwidth supported by the BS.
>
> 1) Connect the signal generator for the wanted signal and the signal
> generator for the interfering signal to the antenna connector of one Rx port
> as shown in Annex I.2.5.
2) Terminate any other Rx port not under test.
3) Start to transmit according to reference measurement channel in annex A.1
to the BS under test. The level of the wanted signal measured at the BS
antenna connector shall be set to the level specified in subclause 7.6.5.
#### 7.6.4.2 Procedure
1) For FDD BS start BS transmission according to E-TM 1.1 at Pmax, for multi-
carrier operation start BS transmission according to applicable test
configuration in 4.10 with the same carrier locations used for the wanted
signal with the sum of the carrier powers equal to Pmax.
The transmitter may be turned off for the out-of-band blocker tests when the
frequency of the blocker is such that no IM2 or IM3 products fall inside the
bandwidth of the wanted signal.
2) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals, levels and
the frequency offsets as specified in Tables 7.6-1, 7.6-2 and 7.6-3 for Wide
Area BS, in Tables 7.6-1a, 7.6-2 and 7.6-4 for Local Area BS and in Table
7.6-1b and 7.6-2 for Home BS. The E-UTRA interfering signal shall be swept
with a step size of 1 MHz starting from the minimum offset to the channel
edges of the wanted signal as specified in Table 7.6-2. The CW interfering
signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz within the range specified in
Table 7.6-1 and 7.6-3 for Wide Area BS, in Table 7.6-1a and 7.6-4 for Local
Area BS and in Table 7.6-1b for Home BS.
3) Measure the throughput of the wanted signal at the BS receiver according to
Annex E, for multi-carrier operation the throughput shall be measured for
relevant carriers specified by the test configuration in subclause 4.10.
4) Interchange the connections of the BS Rx ports and repeat the measurements
according to steps (1) to (3).
### 7.6.5 Test Requirements
#### 7.6.5.1 General requirement
For each measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted and an
interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the parameters in Table
7.6-1, 7.6-1a, 7.6-1b and 7.6-2. The reference measurement channel for the
wanted signal is identified in Tables 7.2-1 and 7.2-2 for each channel
bandwidth and further specified in Annex A.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The relationship between
Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements is defined in subclause 4.1 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex G.
#### 7.6.5.2 Co-location with other base stations
This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of
E-UTRA BS receivers when GSM, CMDA, UTRA or E-UTRA BS operating in a different
frequency band are co-located with an E-UTRA BS. The requirement is applicable
to all channel bandwidths supported by the E-UTRA BS.
The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and E-UTRA BS receiver and are based on co-location
with base stations of the same class.
For each measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted and an
interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the parameters in Table
7.6-3 for Wide Area BS and 7.6-4 for Local Area BS. The reference measurement
channel for the wanted signal is identified in Tables 7.2-1 and 7.2-2 for each
channel bandwidth and further specified in Annex A.

located with BS in other frequency bands.

## 7.7 Receiver spurious emissions
### 7.7.1 Definition and applicability
The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or amplified
in a receiver that appear at the BS receiver antenna connector. The
requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX antenna ports. The test
shall be performed when both TX and RX are on, with the TX port terminated.
For TDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the requirement applies during
the Transmitter OFF period. For FDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the
transmitter spurious emission as specified in clause 6.6.4 is valid.
### 7.7.2 Minimum Requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 7.7.1.
### 7.7.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS to limit the interference
caused by receiver spurious emissions to other systems.
### 7.7.4 Method of test
#### 7.7.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: M, see subclause 4.7.
RF bandwidth position to be tested: M~RFBW~, see subclause 4.7.1.
1) Connect a measurement receiver to the BS antenna connector as shown in
Annex I.2.6.
2) Enable the BS receiver.
3) Terminate the BS Tx antenna connector as shown in Annex I.2.6.
#### 7.7.4.2 Procedure
1) Start BS transmission according to E-TM 1.1 at Pmax, for multi-carrier
operation start BS transmission according to applicable test configuration in
4.10 with the sum of the carrier powers equal to Pmax.
2) Set measurement equipment parameters as specified in table 7.7-1.
3) Measure the spurious emissions over each frequency range described in
subclause 7.7.5.
4) Repeat the test using diversity antenna connector if available.
### 7.7.5 Test requirements
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in Table 7.7-1.
In addition to the requirements in Table 7.7-1, the power of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the levels specified for Protection of the E-UTRA
FDD BS receiver of own or different BS in Clause 6.6.4.5.3 and for Co-
existence with other systems in the same geographical area in Clause
6.6.4.5.4. In addition, the co-existence requirements for co-located base
stations specified in subclause 6.6.4.5.5 may also be applied.
Table 7.7-1: General spurious emission test requirement
* * *
Frequency range Maximum level Measurement Bandwidth Note 30MHz ‑ 1 GHz -57 dBm
100 kHz  
1 GHz ‑ 12.75 GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz  
12.75 GHz ‑ 5^th^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the UL operating
band in GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz Applies only for Bands 22, 42 and 43. NOTE: The
frequency range between 2.5 * BW~Channel~ below the first carrier frequency
and 2.5 * BW~Channel~ above the last carrier frequency transmitted by the BS,
where BW~Channel~ is the channel bandwidth according to Table 5.6‑1, may be
excluded from the requirement. However, frequencies that are more than 10 MHz
below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band or more than 10
MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band (see Table
5.5-1) shall not be excluded from the requirement.
* * *
NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The relationship between
Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements is defined in subclause 4.1 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex G.
## 7.8 Receiver intermodulation
### 7.8.1 Definition and applicability
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal. Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA signal as
specified in Annex C.
### 7.8.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 7.8.1.
### 7.8.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver to inhibit the
generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear elements caused by
the presence of two high-level interfering signals at frequencies with a
specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted signal.
### 7.8.4 Method of test
#### 7.8.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 4.7.
RF bandwidth position to be tested: B~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~, see subclause 4.7.1.
1) Set-up the measurement system as shown in Annex I.2.7.
#### 7.8.4.2 Procedures
1) Generate the wanted signal and adjust the signal level to the BS under test
to the level specified in Table 7.8-1.
2) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals, levels and
the frequency offsets as specified in Table 7.8-2 for intermodulation
requirement and Table 7.8-3, Table 7.8-4 and Table 7.8-5 for narrowband
intermodulation requirement.
3) Adjust the signal generators to obtain the specified level of interfering
signal at the BS input.
4) Measure the throughput according to Annex E, for multi-carrier operation
the throughput shall be measured for relevant carriers specified by the test
configuration in subclause 4.10.
5) Repeat the whole test for the port which was terminated.
### 7.8.5 Test requirements
For eahc measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the
assigned channel frequency and two interfering signals with the conditions
specified in Table 7.8-1 and Table 7.8-2 for intermodulation performance and
in Table 7.8-3, Table 7.8-4 and Table 7.8-5 for narrowband intermodulation
performance.. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in Table 7.2-1, Table7.2-2 and Table 7.2-3 for each channel
bandwidth and further specified in Annex A.
Table 7.8-1: Intermodulation performance requirement

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The relationship between
Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements is defined in subclause 4.1 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex G.
# 8 Performance requirement
## 8.1 General
Performance requirements are specified for a number of test environments and
multipath channel classes.
Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single carrier
only. Performance requirements for a BS supporting carrier aggregation are
defined in terms of single carrier requirements. The requirements only apply
to those measurement channels that are supported by the base station.
The performance requirements for High Speed Train conditions defined in Annex
B.3 are optional.
The performance requirements for UL timing adjustment scenario 2 defined in
Annex B.4 are optional.
For BS with receiver antenna diversity the required SNR shall be applied
separately at each antenna port.
In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may be
provided, from the base station to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.
For tests in clause 8 the transmitter may be off.
## 8.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
### 8.2.1 Performance requirements of PUSCH in multipath fading propagation
conditions transmission on single antenna port
#### 8.2.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction
of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The performance
requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.
A test for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the BS supports
it.
For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths and not supporting carrier
aggregation only the tests for the lowest and the highest channel bandwidths
supported by the BS are applicable.
For a BS supporting carrier aggregation only the CC combination with largest
aggregated bandwidth and the largest number of component carriers is used for
the test. For this CC combination the tests using full PRB allocation FRC are
conducted on per CC basis and measured by the required SNR levels
corresponding to the bandwidths used on the different CCs.
For a BS supporting carrier aggregation the tests with single PRB FRC are
conducted on any single component carrier only.
#### 8.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 8.2.1.1.
#### 8.2.1.3 Test Purpose
The test shall verify the receiver's ability to achieve throughput under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.
#### 8.2.1.4 Method of test
##### 8.2.1.4.1 Initial Conditions
Test environment: Normal, see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: M; see subclause 4.7.
1) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in Annex I.3.2.
##### 8.2.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth, defined in
Table 8.2.1.4.2-1.
Table 8.2.1.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input
* * *
Channel bandwidth [MHz] AWGN power level 1.4 -92.7dBm / 1.08MHz 3 -88.7dBm /
2.7MHz 5 -86.5dBm / 4.5MHz 10 -83.5dBm / 9MHz 15 -81.7dBm / 13.5MHz 20
-80.4dBm / 18MHz
* * *
> 2) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to
> the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A and
> the test parameters in Table 8.2.1.4.2-2. For reference channels using 1
> resource block the resource block in the middle of the channel bandwidth
> shall be used. In case the number of resource blocks in the channel
> bandwidth are even the one in the middle with lower number is to be used for
> testing.
Table 8.2.1.4.2-2 Test parameters for testing PUSCH
* * *
Parameter Value Maximum number of HARQ transmissions 4 RV sequence 0, 2, 3, 1,
0, 2, 3, 1 Uplink-downlink allocation for TDD Configuration 1 (2:2)
* * *
3) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex B.
4) Adjust the equipment so that required SNR specified in Table 8.2.1.5-1 to
8.2.1.5-6 is achieved at the BS input.
5) For each of the reference channels in Table 8.2.1.5-1 to 8.2.1.5-6
applicable for the base station, measure the throughput, according to annex E.
#### 8.2.1.5 Test Requirement
The throughput measured according to subclause 8.2.1.4.2 shall not be below
the limits for the SNR levels specified in Table 8.2.1.5-1 to 8.2.1.5-6.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test and the explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed
by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex G.
### 8.2.1A Performance requirements of PUSCH in multipath fading propagation
conditions transmission on two antenna ports
#### 8.2.1A.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction
of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The performance
requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.
A test for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the BS supports
it.
For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths only the tests for the lowest
and the highest channel bandwidths supported by the BS are applicable.
For the tests on two antenna ports the HARQ retransmissions for multiple
codewords are independent.
#### 8.2.1A.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 8.2.1.1.
#### 8.2.1A.3 Test Purpose
The test shall verify the receiver's ability to achieve throughput of two
layer spatial multiplexing transmission under multipath fading propagation
conditions for a given SNR.
#### 8.2.1A.4 Method of test
##### 8.2.1A.4.1 Initial Conditions
Test environment: Normal, see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: M; see subclause 4.7.
1) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in Annex I.3.6.
##### 8.2.1A.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth, defined in
Table 8.2.1A.4.2-1.
Table 8.2.1A.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input
* * *
Channel bandwidth [MHz] AWGN power level 1.4 -92.7dBm / 1.08MHz 3 -88.7dBm /
2.7MHz 5 -86.5dBm / 4.5MHz 10 -83.5dBm / 9MHz 15 -81.7dBm / 13.5MHz 20
-80.4dBm / 18MHz
* * *
2) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to
the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A and the
test parameters in Table 8.2.1A.4.2-2. For reference channels using 1 resource
block the resource block in the middle of the channel bandwidth shall be used.
In case the number of resource blocks in the channel bandwidth are even the
one in the middle with lower number is to be used for testing.
Table 8.2.1A.4.2-2 Test parameters for testing PUSCH
* * *
Parameter Value Maximum number of HARQ transmissions 4 RV sequence 0, 2, 3, 1,
0, 2, 3, 1 Uplink-downlink allocation for TDD Configuration 1 (2:2)
* * *
3) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex B.
4) Adjust the equipment so that required SNR specified in Table 8.2.1A.5-1 to
8.2.1A.5-6 is achieved at the BS input.
5) For each of the reference channels in Table 8.2.1A.5-1 to 8.2.1A.5-6
applicable for the base station, measure the throughput, according to annex E.
#### 8.2.1A.5 Test Requirement
The throughput measured according to subclause 8.2.1A.4.2 shall not be below
the limits for the SNR levels specified in Table 8.2.1A.5-1 to 8.2.1A.5-6.

### 8.2.2 Performance requirements for UL timing adjustment
#### 8.2.2.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput measured for the moving UE at given SNR. The required throughput is
expressed as 70% of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The
performance requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.
In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one being
transmitted by moving UE and the other being transmitted by stationary UE. The
transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC parameters in Table A.7-1 and
Table A.8-1 are applied for both UEs. The received power for both UEs is the
same. The resource blocks allocated for both UEs are consecutive. In Scenario
2, Doppler shift is not taken into account.
A test for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the BS supports
it.
For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths only the tests for the lowest
and the highest channel bandwidths supported by the BS are applicable.
This requirement shall not be applied to Local Area BS and Home BS.
#### 8.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 8.2.2.1.
#### 8.2.2.3 Test Purpose

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test is defined in subclause 4.1 and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex G.
### 8.2.3 Performance requirements for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH
#### 8.2.3.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH is determined by
the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK and the
probability of detection of ACK. The performance is measured by the required
SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of false
detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less at PUSCH power settings presented
in table 8.2.3.5-1.
The probability of detection of ACK on PUSCH is defined as conditional
probability of detection of the ACK when the ACK is transmitted on PUSCH
allocated RE.
The probability of false detection of the ACK on PUSCH is defined as a
conditional probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when data only is
sent on PUSCH allocated RE, where HARQ-ACK can be allocated (i.e. by
puncturing data). Pseudo‑random data shall be used as an input for PUSCH
coding and modulation purposes.
These tests shall be performed on one of RE's, where HARQ-ACK information was
multiplexed on PUSCH.
In the test for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH data is punctured by HARQ-ACK
information in both slots within a subframe on symbols as specified in 36.212
[13] subclause 5.2.2.8. Amount of resources for HARQ-ACK information is
calculated according to 36.212 [13] subclause 5.2.2.6. None of CQI, RI nor SRS
is to be transmitted in these tests. Tests are performed for one bit HARQ-ACK
information (O = 1).
This test is applied for QPSK 1/3 and 16QAM 3/4 modulation and coding schemes,
with appropriate fixed reference channels for performance requirement applied
as presented in table 8.2.3.5-1. Normal CP, 2 Rx antennas and ETU70
propagation conditions shall be used for this test.
A test for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the BS supports
it.
For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths only the tests for the lowest
and the highest channel bandwidths supported by the BS are applicable.
#### 8.2.3.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 8.2.4.1.
#### 8.2.3.3 Test Purpose
The test shall verify the receiver's ability to detect HARQ-ACK information
multiplexed on PUSCH under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given
SNR.
#### 8.2.3.4 Method of test
##### 8.2.3.4.1 Initial Conditions
Test environment: Normal, see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: M; see subclause 4.7.
1) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in Annex I.3.2.
##### 8.2.3.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth, defined in
Table 8.2.3.4.2-1.
Table 8.2.3.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input
* * *
Channel bandwidth [MHz] AWGN power level 1.4 -92.7 dBm / 1.08MHz 3 -88.7 dBm /
2.7MHz 5 -86.5 dBm / 4.5MHz 10 -83.5 dBm / 9MHz 15 -81.7 dBm / 13.5MHz 20
-80.4 dBm / 18MHz
* * *
2) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to
the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in Annex A and
details presented in chapter 8.2.3.1. For reference channels using 1 resource
block the RB in the middle of the channel bandwidth should be used. In case
the number of resource blocks in the channel bandwidth are even the one in the
middle with lower number is to be used for testing.
3) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to ETU70
channel model defined in Annex B.2.
4) Adjust the equipment so that required SNR specified in Table 8.2.3.5-1 is
achieved at the BS input during the ACK transmissions.
5) The signal generator sends a test pattern on one of RE's where HARQ-ACK
information can be multiplexed on PUSCH with the pattern outlined in figure
8.2.3.4.2-1. The following statistics are kept: the number of ACKs detected
during data only transmissions and the number of missed ACKs during PUSCH with
ACK transmission.

demodulation tests
#### 8.2.3.5 Test Requirement
The fraction of falsely detected ACKs measured according to subclause
8.2.3.4.2 shall be less than 1% and the fraction of correctly detected ACKs
shall be larger than 99% for the SNR listed in table 8.2.3.5-1.

### 8.3.6 NAK to ACK detection for PUCCH format 3
#### 8.3.6.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUCCH format 3 for NAK to ACK detection is
determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the NAK to ACK detection probability. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of the NAK to ACK detection equal to 0.001 or
less. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular bit position when
input is only noise. Each false bit detection is counted as one error.
The NAK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an ACK
bit when an NAK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NAK bit
erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously detected
NAK bits in the definition do not contain the NAK bits which are mapped from
DTX, i.e. NAK bits received when DTX is sent should not be considered.
The test is applicable to all BS. A test for a specific channel bandwidth is
only applicable if the BS supports it.
For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths only the tests for the lowest
and the highest channel bandwidth supported by the BS are applicable.
The number of encoded ACK/NAK bits per sub-frame is defined as presented
below, with random codeword selection assumed:
● 16AN bits: applicable for TDD
ACK/NAK repetitions are disabled for PUCCH transmission. Random codeword
selection is assumed.

## 8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
### 8.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection
#### 8.4.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is determined by
the two parameters: total probability of false detection of the preamble (Pfa)
and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd). The performance is measured
by the required SNR at probability of detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1%
or less.
Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of
the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only
noise.
Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble when the
signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several error cases --
detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not detecting a
preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong timing
estimation. For AWGN, a timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error
of the timing of the strongest path is larger than 1.04us. For ETU70, a timing
estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest
path is larger than 2.08us. The strongest path for the timing estimation error
refers to the strongest path (i.e. average of the delay of all paths having
the same highest gain = 310ns for ETU) in the power delay profile.
The normal mode test is applicable to all BS. The high speed mode test is
applicable to high speed BS.
#### 8.4.1.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.104 [2] subclause 8.4.1.1 and 8.4.2.1.
#### 8.4.1.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver's ability to detect PRACH preamble under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.
#### 8.4.1.4 Method of test
##### 8.4.1.4.1 Initial Conditions
Test environment: Normal, see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: M; see subclause 4.7
1) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all BS antenna connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in Annex I.3.1 or Annex I.3.2 as
applicable.
##### 8.4.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the channel bandwidth.

5) Adjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in Table 8.4.1.5-1 or
8.4.1.5-2 is achieved at the BS input during the PRACH preambles.
6) The test signal generator sends a preamble and the receiver tries to detect
the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure 8.4.1.4.2-1.
The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as described below. The
following statistics are kept: the number of preambles detected in the idle
period and the number of missed preambles.
Figure 8.4.1.4.2-1 PRACH preamble test pattern
The timing offset base value is set to 50% of Ncs. This offset is increased
within the loop, by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the
tested range, which is 0.9us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing
offset is set again to 50% of Ncs. The timing offset scheme is presented in

###### ## Annex B (normative): Propagation conditions
# B.1 Static propagation condition
The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist for this
propagation model.
# B.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
Tables B.2-1 - B.2-3 show multi-path delay profiles that are used for the
performance measurements in multi-path fading environment. All taps have
classical Doppler spectrum, defined as:
(CLASS) {width="1.7777777777777777in" height="0.25in"} for _f_ ∈ -_fD_ , _fD_.

A multipath fading propagation condition is defined by a combination of a
multi-path delay profile and a maximum Doppler frequency _f~D~_ which is
either 5, 70 or 300 Hz. In addidion, 200 Hz Doppler frequency is specified for
UL timing adjustment performance requirement.
## B.3 High speed train condition
High speed train conditions are as follows:
> Scenario 1: Open space
>
> Scenario 3: Tunnel for multi-antennas
The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance are
two non-fading propagation channels in both scenarios. For BS with Rx
diversity defined in scenario 1, the Doppler shift variation is the same
between antennas.
Doppler shift for both scenarios is given by:
$f_{s}\left( t \right) = f_{d}\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right)$ (B.3.1)
where $f_{s}\left( t \right)$ is the Doppler shift and $f_{d}$ is the maximum
Doppler frequency. The cosine of angle $\theta\left( t \right)$ is given by:
$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{D_{s}/2 -
\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( D_{s}/2 - \text{vt}
\right)^{2}}}$, $0 \leq t \leq D_{s}/v$ (B.3.2)
$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{- 1\text{.}5D_{s} +
\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( - 1\text{.}5D_{s} + \text{vt}
\right)^{2}}}$, $D_{s}/v  2D_{s}/v$ (B.3.4)
where $D_{s}/2$ is the initial distance of the train from BS, and
$D_{\text{min}}$ is BS-Railway track distance, both in meters; $v$ is the
velocity of the train in m/s, $t$ is time in seconds.
Doppler shift and cosine angle is given by equations B.3.1 and B.3.2-B.3.4
respectively, where the required input parameters listed in Table B.3-1 and
the resulting Doppler shift is shown in Figure B.3-1 and B.3-2 are applied for
all frequency bands.

# B.4 Moving propagation conditions
Figure B.4-1 illustrates the moving propagation conditions for the test of the
UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the reference
timing and the first tap is according Equation (B.4-1). The timing difference
between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ - (_T~A~_ −31)×16 _T~s~_.
The relative timing among all taps is fixed. The parameters for the moving
propagation conditions are shown in Table B.4-1.

for Band 1 with additional rounding applied to the Doppler frequency
calculated for the specified UE speed.

* * *
The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are defined in
Table B.5.2-2, B.5.2-3 and B.5.2-4 as below.
The values in Table B.5.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4 high
correlation cases to insure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite
after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using the equation:
{width="1.9722222222222223in" height="0.2638888888888889in"}
Where the value "a" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value is used
to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high correlation case,
a=0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case, a=0.00012.
The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in Table
B.5.2-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite after
round-off to 4 digit precision with a =0.00012.

NOTE: For completeness, the 1x2 cases were defined for high, medium and low
correlation but for Rel-8 onwards for 1Tx, performance requirements exist only
for low correlation.

###### ## Annex E (normative): General rules for statistical testing
\
###### ## Annex F (normative): Global In-Channel TX-Test
# F.1 General
The global in-channel Tx test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of the TX
under test in a single measurement process.
The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter, however,
are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for description inside
this annex places particular emphasis on the exclusion of all
interdependencies among the parameters.
## F.2.1 Basic principle
The process is based on the comparison of the actual **output signal of the TX
under test** , received by an ideal receiver, with a **reference signal** ,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal error
free received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent (generally
complex) baseband signals.
The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples. These
numbers are taken from frame structure 1 with normal CP length and a
transmission bandwidth configuration of _N_ ~RB~ = 100. The application of the
text below, however, is not restricted to this parameterset.
## F.2.2 Output signal of the TX under test
The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring equipment
and stored for further processsing. It is sampled at a sampling rate of 30.72
Msps and it is named z(ν). In the time domain it comprises at least 1 frame::
z(ν). It is modelled as a signal with the following parameters: demodulated
data content, carrier frequency, amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.
## F.2.3 Reference signal
Two types of reference signal are defined:
The reference signal i~1~(ν) is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following parameters:
demodulated data content, nominal carrier frequency, nominal amplitude and
phase for each subcarrier. It is represented as a sequence of samples at a
sampling rate of 30.72 Msps in the time domain. The structure of the signal is
described in the testmodells.
The reference signal i~2~(ν) is constructed by the measuring equipment
according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following parameters:
restricted data content: nominal Reference Symbols and the Primary
Synchronisation Channel, (all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),
nominal carrier frequency, nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable
subcarrier, nominal timing. It is represented as a sequence of samples at a
sampling rate of 30.72 Msps in the time domain.
## F.2.4 Measurement results
The measurement results, achieved by the global in channel TX test are the
following:
• Carrier Frequency error
• EVM (Error Vector Magnitude)
• Resource Element TX power
o RS TX power (RSTP)
o OFDM Symbol TX power (OSTP)
Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX chain
after equalisation.
## F.2.5 Measurement points
Resource element TX power is measured after the FFT as described below. EVM is
calculated after the Equalizer (Ampl./ Phase correction). The result of the
frequency synchronisation is the frequency offset. It is performed in the pre-
and/or post-FFT domain. The FFT window of 2048 samples out of 2194 samples
(data +CP) in the time domain is selected in the box CP removal.
Figure E.2.5-1: Measurement points
## F.3.1 Pre FFT minimization process
**Sample Timing, Carrier Frequency** in z(ν) are varied in order to minimise
the difference between z(ν) and i~1~ (ν) , after the amplitude ratio of z(ν)
and i~1~ (ν) has been scaled. Best fit (minimum difference) is achieved when
the RMS difference value between z(ν) and i(ν) is an absolute minimum.
The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: Carrier Frequency
Error.
From the acquired samples one carrier frequency error can be derived.
Note 1. The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be supported by
Post FFT operations. However the minimisation process defined in the pre FFT
domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it does not exclude the samples
inbetween the FFT widths and it does not exclude the bandwidth outside the
transmission bandwidth configuration.
Note 2. The algorithm would allow to derive Carrier Frequency error and Sample
Frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there are no
requirements for Sample Frequeny error. Hence the algorithm models the RF and
the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It returns one error and
does not distinuish between both.
After this process the samples z(ν) are called z^0^(ν).
## F.3.2 Timing of the FFT window
The FFT window length is 2048 samples per OFDM symbol. 140 FFTs (286720
samples) cover less than the acquired number of samples (30720 samples in 10
subframes) The position in time for FFT must be determined.
In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic prefix
without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the window. The EVM

###### ## Annex J (Informative): Unwanted emission requirements for multi-
carrier BS
# J.1 General
In section 6.6, unwanted emission requirements for single carrier or multi-
carrier BS are specified. This multi-carrier BS corresponds to a multi-carrier
BS for E-UTRA, or a BS supporting intra-band contiguous CA. The following two
pragmatic scenarios are considered in this annex:
\- multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths, covering all
scenarios except the channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier less than 5
MHz
\- multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA, covering all scenarios except the
channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier less than 5 MHz.
All scenarios for channel bandwidths of the outermost carrier less than 5 MHz
are for further study. Only multi-carrier BS with contiguous carriers are
considered. The guidelines below assumes that the power spectral density of
the multiple carriers is the same. All other combinations of multiple carriers
are ffs.
Note 1: Further information and analysis for these scenarios can be found in
TR 36.942 [14].
# J.2 Multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths
For a multi-carrier E-UTRA BS transmitting a group of carriers of different
channel bandwidths, the channel bandwidth of the outermost carriers (≥5 MHz)
should be considered for ACLR and Operating band unwanted emission
requirements. That is, the corresponding requirements for the channel
bandwidth of each of the outermost carriers should be applied at the
respective side of the group of transmitted carriers.
# J.3 Multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA
For a multi-carrier BS transmitting a group of carriers of E-UTRA and UTRA,
the RAT being used on the outermost carriers (≥5 MHz) should be considered for
ACLR and Operating band unwanted emission requirements. That is, the
corresponding requirements for the RAT being used on each of the outermost
carriers should be applied at the respective side of the group of transmitted
carriers.
