# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification TS 36.141 [4] Annex G defines
Test Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each
test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in this
specification to create Test Requirements.
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 [3].
## 4.2 Base station classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations, Local
Area Base Stations and Home Base Stations unless otherwise stated.
Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB. The Wide
Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the base station for
General Purpose application in Release 8.
Local Area Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell** scenarios with **a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB**.
Home Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Femto
Cell** scenarios.
## 4.3 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements or set by local and regional regulation as
mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances that the requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.3-1 lists all requirements that may be applied differently in
different regions.

The lower edge of the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth (BW~Channel_CA~) is defined
as F~edge_low~ = F~C_low~ - F~offset~. The higher edge of the aggregated
channel bandwidth is defined as F~edge_high~ = F~C_high~ + F~offset~. The
Aggregated Channel Bandwidth, **BW~Channel_CA,~** is defined as follows:
BW~Channel_CA~ = F~edge_high~ - F~edge_low~ [MHz]
F~offset~ is defined in Table 5.6-2 below where BW~Channel~ is defined in
Table 5.6-1.

NOTE 1: F~offset~ is calculated separately for the Lower Edge and the Higher
Edge of the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth.
NOTE 2: The values of BW~Channel_CA~ for UE and BS are the same if the lowest
and the highest component carriers are identical.
## 5.7 Channel arrangement
### 5.7.1 Channel spacing
The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the size
of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The nominal
channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined as following:
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted to optimize
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.7.1A CA Channel spacing
For intra-band contiguously aggregated carriers the channel spacing between
adjacent component carriers shall be multiple of 300 kHz.
The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated E-UTRA carriers is
defined as follows:
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA component carriers according to Table 5.6-1 with values in
MHz. The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation can be
adjusted to any multiple of 300 kHz less than the nominal channel spacing to
optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.7.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the carrier
centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz.
### 5.7.3 Carrier frequency and EARFCN
The carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the E-UTRA
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 - 65535\. The
relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the downlink is
given by the following equation, where F~DL_low~ and N~Offs-DL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1 and N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN.
F~DL~ = F~DL_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)
The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the uplink is
given by the following equation where F~UL_low~ and N~Offs-UL~ are given in
table 5.7.3-1 and N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN.
F~UL~ = F~UL_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~)

# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for a
single transmitter antenna connector. In case of multi-carrier transmission
with one or multiple transmitter antenna connectors, transmit diversity or
MIMO transmission, the requirements apply for each transmitter antenna
connector.
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified at the
BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for
the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus
such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used,
requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (port B).
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 6 applies at all times,
i.e. during the Transmitter ON period, the Transmitter OFF period and the
Transmitter transient period.

Figure 6.1-1: Transmitter test ports
## 6.2 Base station output power
Output power, Pout, of the base station is the mean power of one carrier
delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the
transmitter.
The maximum total output power (Pmax), of the base station is the mean power
level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period in a
specified reference condition.
Rated total output power of the base station is the mean power for BS
operating in single carrier, multi-carrier, or carrier aggregation
configurations that the manufacturer has declared to be available at the
antenna connector during the transmitter ON period.
Maximum output power (Pmax,c) of the base station is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period in
a specified reference condition.
Rated output power, PRAT, of the base station is the mean power level per
carrier for BS operating in single carrier, multi-carrier, or carrier
aggregation configurations that the manufacturer has declared to be available
at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period.
NOTE: Different PRATs may be declared for different configurations
The rated output power, PRAT, of the BS shall be as specified in Table 6.2-1.

## 8.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
### 8.2.1 Requirements in multipath fading propagation conditions
The performance requirement of PUSCH is determined by a minimum required
throughput for a given SNR. The required throughput is expressed as a fraction
of maximum throughput for the FRCs listed in Annex A. The performance
requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. For 2Tx test the HARQ
retransmissions for two codewords are independent.

#### 8.2.1.1 Minimum requirements
The throughput shall be equal to or larger than the fraction of maximum
throughput stated in the tables 8.2.1.1-1 to 8.2.1.1-6 at the given SNR for
1Tx and in tables 8.2.1.1-7 to 8.2.1.1-12 for 2Tx two layer spatial

### 8.2.2 Requirements for UL timing adjustment
The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a minimum
required throughput for the moving UE at given SNR. The performance
requirements assume HARQ retransmissions. The performance requirements for UL
timing adjustment scenario 2 defined in Annex B.4 are optional.
In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one being
transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a stationary UE.
The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC parameters in Table A.7-1 and
Table A.8-1 are applied for both UEs. The received power for both UEs is the
same. The resource blocks allocated for both UEs are consecutive. In Scenario
2, Doppler shift is not taken into account.
This requirement shall not be applied to Local Area BS and Home BS.

### 8.2.4 Requirements for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH
Two performance requirements are defined for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH:
ACK false detection and ACK missed detection requirements.
The ACK false detection probability for PUSCH is the probability that ACK is
detected when data only is sent on symbols where HARQ-ACK information can be
allocated (i.e. by puncturing data).
The ACK missed detection probability for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH is the
conditional probability of not detecting an ACK when it was sent on PUSCH
resources.
In the tests for ACK missed detection on PUSCH, data is punctured by the
control information (i.e. ACK/NAK) in both slots within subframe on symbols as
specified in 36.212.
In both tests none of CQI, RI nor SRS is transmitted. Tests are to be
performed for one bit HARQ-ACK information (O = 1).
#### 8.2.4.1 Minimum requirement
The ACK false detection probability as well as the ACK missed detection
probability for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH shall not exceed 1% at PUSCH
power settings presented in table 8.2.4.1-1.

number of NAK bits decoded as ACK bits at the receiver, i.e. the number of
received ACK bits
● NAK bits in the definition do not contain the NAK bits which are mapped from
DTX, i.e. NAK bits received when DTX is sent should not be considered.
ACK/NAK repetitions are disabled for PUCCH transmission. Random codeword

## 8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
### 8.4.1 PRACH False alarm probability
The false alarm requirement is valid for any number of receive antennas, for
all frame structures and for any channel bandwidth.
The false alarm probability is the conditional total probability of erroneous
detection of the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when
input is only noise.
#### 8.4.1.1 Minimum requirement
The false alarm probability shall be less than or equal to 0.1%.
### 8.4.2 PRACH detection requirements
The probability of detection is the conditional probability of correct
detection of the preamble when the signal is present. There are several error
cases -- detecting different preamble than the one that was sent, not
detecting a preamble at all or correct preamble detection but with the wrong
timing estimation. For AWGN, a timing estimation error occurs if the
estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than 1.04us.
For ETU70, a timing estimation error occurs if the estimation error of the
timing of the strongest path is larger than 2.08us. The strongest path for the
timing estimation error refers to the strongest path (i.e. average of the
delay of all paths having the same highest gain = 310ns for ETU) in the power
delay profile.
The test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.6-1 and the test
preambles for high speed mode are listed in A.6-2.
#### 8.4.2.1 Minimum requirements
The probability of detection shall be equal to or exceed 99% for the SNR
levels listed in table 8.4.2.1-1 and 8.4.2.1-2.
The requirements for Burst format 4 are optional and only valid for base
stations supporting TDD. The requirements for high speed mode (table
8.4.2.1-2) are only valid for the base stations supporting high speed mode.

###### ## Annex A (normative): Reference measurement channels
The parameters for the reference measurement channels are specified in clause
A.1 for reference sensitivity and in-channel selectivity and in clause A.2 for
dynamic range.
A schematic overview of the encoding process for the reference measurement
channels is provided in Figure A-1.
Receiver requirements in the present document are defined with a throughput
stated relative to the Maximum throughput of the FRC. The Maximum throughput
for an FRC equals the Payload size * the Number of uplink subframes per
second. For FDD, 1000 uplink sub-frames per second are used.

###### ## Annex B (normative): Propagation conditions
# B.1 Static propagation condition
The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist for this
propagation model.
# B.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
Tables B.2-1 -- B.2-3 show multi-path delay profiles that are used for the
performance measurements in multi-path fading environment. All taps have
classical Doppler spectrum, defined as:
(CLASS) {width="1.7743055555555556in" height="0.2534722222222222in"} for _f_ ∈

A multipath fading propagation condition is defined by a combination of a
multi-path delay profile and a maximum Doppler frequency _f~D~_ which is
either 5, 70 or 300 Hz. In addidion, 200 Hz Doppler frequency is specified for
UL timing adjustment performance requirement.
For carrier aggregation requirements, the fading of the signals for each
carrier shall be independent.
# B.3 High speed train condition
High speed train conditions are as follows:
> Scenario 1: Open space
>
> Scenario 3: Tunnel for multi-antennas
The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance are
two non-fading propagation channels in both scenarios. For BS with Rx
diversity defined in scenario 1, the Doppler shift variation is the same
between antennas.
Doppler shift for both scenarios is given by:
$f_{s}\left( t \right) = f_{d}\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right)$ (B.3.1)
where $f_{s}\left( t \right)$ is the Doppler shift and $f_{d}$ is the maximum
Doppler frequency. The cosine of angle $\theta\left( t \right)$is given by:
$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{D_{s}/2 -
\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( D_{s}/2 - \text{vt}
\right)^{2}}}$, $0 \leq t \leq D_{s}/v$ (B.3.2)
$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{- 1\text{.}5D_{s} +
\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( - 1\text{.}5D_{s} + \text{vt}
\right)^{2}}}$, $D_{s}/v  2D_{s}/v$ (B.3.4)
where $D_{s}/2$ is the initial distance of the train from BS, and
$D_{\text{min}}$ is BS-Railway track distance, both in meters; $v$ is the
velocity of the train in m/s, $t$ is time in seconds.
Doppler shift and cosine angle is given by equation B.3.1 and B.3.2-B.3.4
respectively, where the required input parameters listed in table B.3-1 and
the resulting Doppler shift shown in Figure B.3-1 and B.3-2 are applied for
all frequency bands.

# B.4 Moving propagation conditions
Figure B.4-1 illustrates the moving propagation conditions for the test of the
UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the reference
timing and the first tap is according Equation (B.4-1). The timing difference
between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ - (_T~A~_ −31)×16 _T~s~_.
The relative timing among all taps is fixed. The parameters for the moving
propagation conditions are shown in Table B.4-1.

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are defined in
Table B.5.2-2, B.5.2-3 and B.5.2-4 as below.
The values in Table B.5.2-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4 high
correlation cases to insure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite
after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using the equation:
Where the value "a" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value is used
to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high correlation case,
a=0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case, a=0.00012.
The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in Table
B.5.2-3 to insure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite after
round-off to 4 digit precision with a =0.00012.

###### ## Annex D (normative): Environmental requirements for the BS equipment
The BS equipment shall fulfil all the requirements in the full range of
environmental conditions for the relevant environmental class from the
relevant IEC specifications listed below
60 721-3-3 \"Stationary use at weather protected locations\" [13]
60 721-3-4 \"Stationary use at non weather protected locations\" [14]
Normally it should be sufficient for all tests to be conducted using normal
test conditions except where otherwise stated. For guidance on the use of test
conditions to be used in order to show compliance refer to TS 36.141.
###### ## Annex E (normative): Error Vector Magnitude
# E.1 Reference point for measurement
The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a zero-forcing (ZF)
equalizer in the receiver, as depicted in Figure E.1-1 below.
Figure E.1-1: Reference point for EVM measurement
# E.2 Basic unit of measurement
The basic unit of EVM measurement is defined over one subframe (1ms) in the
time domain and $N_{\text{BW}}^{\text{RB}}$ subcarriers (180kHz) in the
frequency domain:
where
$T$ is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active
within the subframe,
$F(t)$is the set of subcarriers within the $N_{\text{BW}}^{\text{RB}}$
subcarriers with the considered modulation scheme being active in symbol _t_ ,
$I(t,f)$ _is_ the ideal signal reconstructed by the measurement equipment in
accordance with relevant Tx models,
$Z'(t,f)$ is the modified signal under test defined in E.3.
Note: Although the basic unit of measurement is one subframe, the equalizer is
calculated over 10 subframe measurement periods to reduce the impact of noise
in the reference symbols. The boundaries of the 10 subframe measurement
periods need not be aligned with radio frame boundaries.
# E.3 Modified signal under test
Implicit in the definition of EVM is an assumption that the receiver is able
to compensate a number of transmitter impairments. The signal under test is
equalised and decoded according to:
where
$z(v)$ is the time domain samples of the signal under test.
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{t}$ is the sample timing difference between the FFT
processing window in relation to nominal timing of the ideal signal. Note that
two timing offsets are determined, the corresponding EVM is measured and the
maximum used as described in E.7.
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{f}$ is the RF frequency offset.
$\overset{\sim}{\phi}(f)$ is the phase response of the TX chain.
$\overset{\sim}{a}(f)$ is the amplitude response of the TX chain.
# E.4 Estimation of frequency offset
The observation period for determining the frequency offset
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{f}$ shall be 1 ms.
# E.5 Estimation of time offset
The observation period for determining the sample timing difference
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{t}$shall be 1 ms.
In the following $\Delta\overset{\sim}{c}$ represents the middle sample of the
EVM window of length $W$ (defined in E.5.1) or the last sample of the first
window half if $W$is even.
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{c}$is estimated so that the EVM window of length $W$ is
centred on the measured cyclic prefix of the considered OFDM symbol. To
minimize the estimation error the timing shall be based on the primary
synchronization signal and reference signals. To limit time distortion of any
transmit filter the reference signals in the 1 outer RBs are not taken into
account in the timing estimation
Two values for $\Delta\overset{\sim}{t}$ are determined:
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{t}}_{l} = \Delta\overset{\sim}{c} + \alpha -
\left\lfloor \frac{W}{2} \right\rfloor$ and
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{t}}_{h} = \Delta\overset{\sim}{c} + \left\lfloor
\frac{W}{2} \right\rfloor$ where $\alpha = 0$ if $W$ is odd and $\alpha = 1$
if $W$is even.
When the cyclic prefix length varies from symbol to symbol (e.g. time
multiplexed MBMS and unicast) then $T$ shall be further restricted to the
subset of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active and with
the considered cyclic prefix length type.
## E.5.1 Window length
Table E.5.1-1 below specifies EVM window length (W) for normal CP, the cyclic
prefix length $N_{\text{cp}}$ is 160 for symbols 0 and 144 for symbols 1-6.
Table E.5.1-2 specifies the EVM window length (W) for extended CP, the cyclic
prefix length $N_{\text{cp}}$ is 512.

# E.6 Estimation of TX chain amplitude and frequency response parameters
The equalizer coefficients $\overset{\sim}{a}(f)$and $\overset{\sim}{\phi}(f)$
are determined as follows:
1\. Calculate the complex ratios (amplitude and phase) of the post-FFT
acquired signal $Z'(t,f)$ and the post-FFT Ideal signal $I_{2}(t,f)$, for each
reference symbol, over 10 subframes. This process creates a set of complex
ratios:
Where the post-FFT Ideal signal $I_{2}(t,f)$ is constructed by the measuring
equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the following
parameters: restricted content: i.e. nominal Reference Symbols and the Primary
Synchronisation Channel, (all other modulation symbols are set to 0 V),
nominal carrier frequency, nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable
subcarrier, nominal timing.
2\. Perform time averaging at each reference signal subcarrier of the complex
ratios, the time-averaging length is 10 subframes. Prior to the averaging of
the phases $\phi\left( t_{i},f \right)$ an unwrap operation must be performed
according to the following definition: The unwrap operation corrects the
radian phase angles of $\phi\left( t_{i},f \right)$ by adding multiples of
2*PI when absolute phase jumps between consecutive time instances t~i~ are
greater then or equal to the jump tolerance of PI radians. This process
creates an average amplitude and phase for each reference signal subcarrier
(i.e. every third subcarrier with the exception of the reference subcarrier
spacing across the DC subcarrier).
Where _N_ is the number of reference symbol time-domain locations _t~i~_ from
Z'(f,t) for each reference signal subcarrier $f$.
3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase $\hat{a}(f)$ and
$\hat{\phi}(f)$ at the reference signal subcarriers are obtained by computing
the moving average in the frequency domain of the time-averaged reference
signal subcarriers, i.e. every third subcarrier. The moving average window
size is 19. For reference subcarriers at or near the edge of the channel the
window size is reduced accordingly as per figure E.6-1.
4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients $\hat{a}(f)$
and $\hat{\phi}(f)$ to compute coefficients $\overset{\sim}{a}(f)$,
$\overset{\sim}{\phi}(f)$ for each subcarrier.
Figure E.6-1: Reference subcarrier smoothing in the frequency domain
# E.7 Averaged EVM
EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of 10
downlink subframes:
For FDD the averaging in the time domain equals the 10 subframe duration of
the 10 subframes measurement period from the equalizer estimation step.
For TDD the averaging in the time domain can be calculated from subframes of
different frames and should have a minimum of 10 subframes averaging length.
TDD special fields (DwPTS and GP) are not included in the averaging.
_Where Ni_ is the number of resource blocks with the considered modulation
scheme in subframe _i_ and _N~dl~_ is the number of allocated downlink
subframes in one frame.
The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS average at
the window W extremities of the EVM measurements:
Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,\ l}}$ is calculated using
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{t} = \Delta{\overset{\sim}{t}}_{l}$in the expressions
above and ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame},h}$is calculated using
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{t} = \Delta{\overset{\sim}{t}}_{h}$ in the
$\overline{\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}}$ calculation.
Thus we get:
The averaged EVM with the minimum averaging length of at least 10 subframes is
then achieved by further averaging of the $\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ results
$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{frame}}}\sum_{k =
1}^{N_{\text{frame}}}\text{EVM}_{\text{frame},k}^{2}}$, $N_{\text{frame}} =
\left\lceil \frac{\text{10}}{N_{\text{dl}}} \right\rceil$
###### ## Annex F (Informative): Unwanted emission requirements for multi-
carrier BS
# F.1 General
In subclause 6.6, unwanted emission requirements for single carrier or multi-
carrier BS are specified. This multi-carrier BS corresponds to a multi-carrier
BS for E-UTRA, or a BS supporting intra-band contiguous CA. The following two
pragmatic scenarios are considered in this annex:
\- multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths, covering all
scenarios except the channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier less than 5
MHz
\- multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA, covering all scenarios except the
channel bandwidth of the outermost carrier less than 5 MHz.
All scenarios for channel bandwidths of the outermost carrier less than 5 MHz
are for further study. The guidelines below assumes that the power spectral
density of the multiple carriers is the same. All other combinations of
multiple carriers are ffs.
Note 1: Further information and analysis for these scenarios can be found in
TR 36.942 [9].
# F.2 Multi-carrier BS of different E-UTRA channel bandwidths
For a multi-carrier E-UTRA BS transmitting a group of carriers of different
channel bandwidths, the channel bandwidth of the outermost carriers (≥5 MHz)
should be considered for ACLR and Operating band unwanted emission
requirements. That is, the corresponding requirements for the channel
bandwidth of each of the outermost carriers should be applied at the
respective side of the group of transmitted carriers.
# F.3 Multi-carrier BS of E-UTRA and UTRA
For a multi-carrier BS transmitting a group of carriers of E-UTRA and UTRA,
the RAT being used on the outermost carriers (≥5 MHz) should be considered for
ACLR and Operating band unwanted emission requirements. That is, the
corresponding requirements for the RAT being used on each of the outermost
carriers should be applied at the respective side of the group of transmitted
carriers.
###### ## Annex G (Informative): Regional requirement for protection of DTT
The European Communications Committee (ECC) has adopted the "ECC Decision on
harmonised conditions for Mobile/Fixed Communications Networks operating in
the band 790-862 MHz" [12] applicable for BS operating in band 20. The
decision defines a requirement for "Out-of-block BEM baseline requirements for
'mobile/fixed communications network' (MFCN) base stations within the spectrum
allocated to the broadcasting (DTT) service", where three different cases A,
B, and C for protecting broadcasting DTT are defined. These cases can be
applied on a per-channel and/or per-region basis, i.e. for the same channel
different cases can be applied in different geographic areas (e.g. area
related to DTT coverage) and different cases can be applied to different
channels in the same geographic area.
For band 20, compliance with the regulatory requirements in Europe referenced
above can be assessed based on the manufacturer's declaration of P~EM,N~
specified in subclause 6.6.3.3, together with the deployment characteristics.
Maximum output Power in 10 MHz (P~10MHz~) is also declared by the
manufacturer. The parameters G~ant~ and N~ant~ are deployment specific
parameters related to the deployment of the BS, where G~ant~ is the antenna
gain and N~ant~ is the number of antennas.
For each channel (N) the EIRP level is calculated using: P~EIRP,N~ = P~EM,N~ +
G~ant~ + 10*log(N~ant~ ). The regulatory requirement in [12] limits the EIRP
level to the Maximum level in Table G-1 for the protection case(s) defined in
the regulation.
