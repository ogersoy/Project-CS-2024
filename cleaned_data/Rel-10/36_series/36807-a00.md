# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
## 4.2 Applicability of minimum requirements
## 4.3 Applicability of minimum requirements (CA, ULMA, DLMA, CPE)
a) In Annex B (Release 10 working assumptions ) the requirements are specified
as general requirements and additional requirements specific to CA, UL-MA,
DL_MA and CPE which are specified as suffix A, B, C, D where:
\- Suffix A additional requirements need to support CA
\- Suffix B additional requirements need to support DLMA
\- Suffix C additional requirements need to support ULMA
\- Suffix D additional requirements need to support CPE
b) A terminal which support these features need to meet both the general
requirements and the additional requirement applicable to the additional sub-
clause. Where there is a difference in requirement between the general
requirements and the additional sub-clause requirements the tighter
requirements are applicable unless stated otherwise in the additional sub-
clause
c) A terminal which support more than one additional requirements (CA, ULMA,
DLMA and CPE) would need to both sets of requirements
## 4.4 Method for specification of inter-band CA
For inter-band carrier aggregation, the following method should be used for
specifying minimum requirements for specific operating-band combinations:
1\. Classes of inter-band combinations are created with specific technical
characteristics
2\. Methods for specifying combinations belonging to a certain class are
developed
\- Once developed, newly proposed inter-band combinations within a class can
be specified readily
3\. Combinations will be introduced in a release independent manner into a
relevant class within the methodology of the frame work
The classes of combinations are defined using frequency separation between
operating bands as a coarse basis, and with subclasses based on technical
challenge:
\- Harmonic relation between bands combined;
\- Intermodulation products.
For each inter-band combination, the constituent operating bands are
designated a:
\- \"Low\" band if the maximum of the upper frequency limit of the transmit
and receive frequency band is \ 1.7 GHz
The following tentative classes are defined:
A1. Low-high band combination without harmonic relation between bands
A2. Low-high band combination with harmonic relation between bands
A3. Low-low or high-high band combination without intermodulation problem (low
order IM)
A4. Low-low or high-high band combination with intermodulation problem (low
order IM)
Combinations with operating bands in the 1.5 GHz are designated into the above
classes on a case-by-case basis.

derived from an operators list on Annex A those could be added on release
independent manner.

## 5.6A CA Channel bandwidth
**Principle for deriving an Aggregated Channel Bandwidth**
_Aggregated Channel Bandwidth_ can be defined as the bandwidth in which a UE
transmits (receives) multiple CCs simultaneously. The following principle
options exist to define this:
1\. Assume available spectrum blocks of size n*5 MHz (or n*20 MHz) as the
Aggregated Channel Bandwidth. Then derive suitable CA CC configurations
including appropriate internal transition (guard) bands at the edge CCs as
well as inter-CC carrier spacing.
2\. Derive the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth from the configuration of the CCs
by considering the nominal CC channel spacing and a guard bands above the
highest (below the lowest) transmitted/received CC.
The following can be observed:
1\. Available spectrum blocks might not always be of size n*5 MHz as was noted
in RAN4 e.g. for the 3.5 GHz band.
2\. Option 1.) tends to result in larger guard bands or addition of smaller
CCs to fill these.
3\. Option 1.) with n*20 MHz scales worse towards 60 ... 100 MHz as it results
in large guard bands (for closely spaced CCs).
4\. Option 2) better reflects actual physics / emissions which are driven by
the actual CC configuration, not license block sizes.
5\. The resulting Aggregated Channel Bandwidth in Option 2) will not be a
multiple of 5 MHz, but an \"odd\" number like 38.3 MHz for 100 + 100 RB CA. On
the other hand this it indicates the minimum needed spectrum for a CC
configuration (in form of 3GPP TX/RX requirements), and any additional
frequencies within n*5 MHz blocks could be available to enhance co-existence
to adjacent systems even further.
6\. For the BS option 2.) is used in for multi-carrier and MSR specifications.
Regarding the above points, option 2.) shall be applicable for the definition
of aggregated channel bandwidth.
**Guard bands at the edge CCs**
**Shall GB be symmetrical or asymmetrical?**
When considering a transmission where all component carriers are fully
populated and transmitted at highest possible maximum output power (typical
SEM test configuration) the spectral re-growth generated in PA is the dominant
OOB region noise contributor. In this case the bandwidths of individual
component carriers do not play significant role how the emissions are spread
into OOB region instead the aggregated channel bandwidth is the parameter that
defines this phenomenon. Thus it is logical to define guard bands to
symmetrical at each side of aggregated channel bandwidth.
Furthermore symmetrical GB would significantly simplify the filtering design
complexity because symmetrical GB enables the same transmitter/receiver
requirements to be defined at both edges of the transmitted/received signals.
It has been agreed that the same GB shall be applied at each side of
Aggregated Channel Bandwidth.
**Shall GB values be fixed or relative to the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth?**
Among others, the guard bands facilitate TX spectrum shaping filtering. In
REL-9 the guard bands are relative to BW_channel (\~10%). Scaling this upwards
to e.g. 80 MHz will lead to large guard bands, hence the need for this should
be investigated. Variable guard bands also complicate CA migration scenarios
like extending 2*100 RB CA towards 3*100 RB CA as the edges of Aggregated
Channel Bandwidth would accordingly move, requiring possibly some re-
arrangement of the CCs.
In neither the \"10 % rule\" is required for TX/RX filtering nor a single
fixed guard band value found feasible for the whole range of CA from 20 ...
100 MHz, then a middle and more flexible way could be to make the guard band
size a function of the Aggregated Transmission Bandwidth Configuration, with a
certain granularity, e.g.:
Table 5.6A-1: Definition of the Guard band size
+--------------------+----------------------------------+------------+ | CA Bandwidth Class | Aggregated Transmission | Guard band | | | Bandwidth Configuration, | | | | N~RB_\ agg~ | [MHz] | | | | | | | [RBs] | | +--------------------+----------------------------------+------------+ | A | N~RB,\ agg~ ≤ 100 | TBD | +--------------------+----------------------------------+------------+ | B | N~RB,\ agg~ ≤ 100 | TBD | +--------------------+----------------------------------+------------+ | C | 100 \ The maximum output power for UE supporting UL-MIMO is defined per UE. This
> is in accordance with the power control and power management mechanisms in
> which the total power of the UE from multiple antenna connectors is
> considered. UE power class is also determined based on the total maximum
> output power from the UE. The lower tolerance for maximum output power is
> relaxed due to the multiple transmitters used in closed-loop spatial
> multiplexing scheme.

### 6.2.3 UE Maximum Output power for modulation / channel bandwidth
**Channel arrangement**
In this chapter we present results of MPR study for an aggregated signal with
the following settings:
\- Total Aggregated Transmission Bandwidth Configuration: 100 + 100 RB, 75+75
RB and 50+100 RB
\- Component Carrier Spacing as defined in [1]: 19.8 MHz (for 100+100 RB
case), 15.0 MHz (for 75+75 RB Case) and 13.8 MHz (for 50+100 RB Case)
\- Guard bands are set to 1 MHz on either side of the aggregated channel
bandwidth (for 100+100 RB case),0.75 MHz (for 75+75 RB case) and 1 MHz (for
50+100 RB case)
\- Data Modulation: QPSK and 16QAM
\- RB allocations: contiguous i.e. no empty RB\'s between transmitted clusters
\- RB_Start is always 0
**Simulation assumptions**
Simulation assumptions used are listed in Table 6.2.3-1. PA operating point
was set so that for one fully allocated (100RB) carrier (LTE Rel-8 carrier)
the reported UTRA~ACLR1~ level was 33 dB when 1 dB of MPR was applied as
permitted by the specification 36.101. Backoff and MPR values are referred to
this PA operating point.

**Target requirements**
Following ACLR and SEM requirements were used when required backoff (MPR) was
searhed. These requirements are inline with the agreements done during
previous RAN4 meetings.
\- E-UTRA~ACLR~ = 30 dBc
\- UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33 dBc
\- UTRA~ACLR2~ = 36 dBc
\- CA E-UTRA~ACLR~ = 30 dBc

**Simulation results**
Results are presented in a form of a graphs Figures 6.2.3-1 and 6.2.3-2 and a
Table 6.2.3-3.
From the Figures 6.2.3-1 and 6.2.3-2, it can be seen that as the total number
of RBs in the contiguous allocation increases, the criterion that determines
the maximum backoff needed changes. This trend is depicted in Figure 6.2.3-1
for 100+100 RB allocation and Figure 6.2.3-2 for 75+75 RB allocation.

Table 6.2.3-3 below summarises the required backoff needed to satisfy the Tx
requirements as a function of number of RBs for both QPSK and 16-QAM signals.

Contiguous allocation in this contribution refers to case where no empty RB\'s
are located within an UL allocation. This is not a typical network behaviour
because in most cases there will be PUCCH regions reserved for other UE\'s to
send uplink control information. These PUCCH regions that will break the
contiguous nature of the allocation are the higher edge PUCCH of the lower
carrier and the lower edge PUCCH of the higher carrier which are located in
the middle of the aggregated signal. As a corner case it is how ever possible
to schedule full bandwidth to a single UE without PUCCH regions.
It should be also noted that even though called contiguous allocation in this
paper the allocations wide enough to extend to second carrier are not single
carrier transmissions therefore the PAR and the cubic metric are increased and
hence more MPR is required compared to truly single carrier transmission.
When the aggregated transmissions bandwidth configuration is such that it
allocates RB\'s from two component carriers then the needed backoff increases
strongly and this can be observed easily from the figures 1-5 and from table
1. As an example this means than if a UL signal having size of 100 RB is
allocated into two CC each having bandwidth of 15 MHz then more MPR is needed
than for single carrier signal consisting of a single CC having bandwidth of
20 MHz.
Also in the case where the allocation is limited to single carrier (Pcc) and
the other carrier (Scc) do not contain transmissions but the Tx is configured
to 2 CC mode one cannot directly compare the required MPR or emissions to
release 8/9 operation because the Tx bandwidth is wider and the carrier
leakage and IQ-image components are located differently compared to truly
single carrier transmission specified in REL-8/9. This will cause a fact that
the IMD products generated in PA are located differently in OOB and spurious
regions when one compares carrier aggregated signal to REL-8/9 signal even
though the allocation size would be same and it would be located on a same
position on single carrier.
#### 6.2.3.1 MPR for multi cluster allocations
**Issues that affect required MPR**
As noted in earlier studies defining a MPR scheme for non-contiguous multi-
cluster LTE transmission is challenging because there are many dimensions in
the signal that affect the required back off. In Figure 6.2.3.1-1 we
illustrate some of the parameters that affect the MPR. The following notation
applies:
G = the maximum gap between two adjacent RB clusters
A~n~ = the width of the nth cluster allocation
E~L~ = the distance from the edge of the first cluster to the left hand edge
of the first component carrier
E~R~ = the distance from the edge of the last cluster to the right hand edge
of the last component carrier
W = the distance from the left hand edge of the first cluster to the right
hand edge of the last cluster
In all cases the units are normalised to the total number of RBs in both
component carriers and therefore take values from 0 to 1. (The Edge
allocations, E~L~ and E~R~ are actually normalised to N~RB~ / 2 such that the
final value of E (defined subsequently) will be in the range 0 to 1).
As examples:
1) An allocation that extended the full width of both component carriers would
have a width W=1.
2) A 15 RB cluster in a 75+75 component carrier configuration would have A~n~
= 15 / (75+75) = 0.1.
We further define the following parameters:
A = sum(A~1,\ ...,~ A~n~) (i.e. the total RB allocation across all clusters).
E = min(E~L~, E~R~) (i.e. the minimum distance from the edge of the outside
clusters to the edge of the CCs).
B = abs(A~1~ -- A~N~) (i.e. the difference between the RB allocations of the
two edge clusters).
This yields the five key parameters, G, A, E, W and B that can be used to
parameterise the backoff.
Figure 6.2.3.1-1: Parameters affecting MPR
**Simulation campaign**
During the simulation campaign a large set of allocation scenarios were
simulated and appropriate MPR value was searched. The method used to define
these allocations was initially as described in R4-110265; to increase the
coverage of the simulations a number of random scenarios were added in each
case. Table 6.2.3.1-1 shows the minimum number of scenarios that were
simulated for each component carrier configuration. In some cases additional
simulations for other random configurations were also carried out.

Simulations were carried out using two different PA models, such that the
total number of configurations simulated was 110131. Simulation assumptions
were as follows:
● PA operating point REL-8 20 MHz CC UTRA~ACLR1~=33 dBc with Pout = 22 dBm
● Modulator IQ -- image = 28 dB
● Modulator carrier leakage = 28 dBc
● Modulator C_IM3 = 60 dBc
Note that the modulator IQ leakage and carrier leakage have been modified to
28 dBc; this is because the in-band mask limits for carrier and image
breakthrough are both 25 dBc, which led to most simulations providing marginal
failures on the in-band mask with the earlier simulation assumption of 25 dBc
(e.g. R4-10104335, R4-110265).
PA operating point was set so that for one fully allocated (100RB) carrier
(LTE Rel-8 carrier) the reported UTRAACLR1 level was 33 dB when 1 dB of MPR
was applied as permitted by the specification 36.101. Backoff and MPR values
are referred to this PA operating point.
**In-band mask definition**
As yet, the in-band mask has not been defined for aggregated carriers; however
in order to have something to benchmark the performance of the MPR rules, an
initial definition of in-band was assumed. This definition is overly-complex
in order to provide something that is coherent with the Release-8 in-band mask
definition. It is _not_ proposed that this definition be used in the RF
specification for LTE.
The definition for the mask is as given in table 6.2.3.1-2:

2) CA_X-Y (Inter band non contiguous CA)
The analysis for intra-band contiguous CA could also be applied.
3) DLMA (Down link multiple antenna)
4) ULMA (Up link multiple antenna)
The ON/OFF time mask defines the observation period between Transmit OFF and
ON power and between Transmit ON and OFF power on the corresponding physical
channels. The requirements for Transmit OFF power are specified at each
transmit antenna, therefore, the ON/OFF time mask requirements reflecting the
transient characteristics are specified for each transmit and the requirements
shall be the same as Rel-8/9.

### 6.3.5 Power Control
Currently power control is defined on sub-frame basis for a single component
carrier in REL8 in the RAN1 specification. For LTE-A, the architecture of
single or multiple PA can have an impact on the power control dynamics.
Another consideration for study is whether the multi-CC UL signal is combined
digitally (at the baseband) or in analogue ( at IF or RF) since the power
control accuracy in terms accurate power control ratio amongst different CC
will be less precise due to the analog component in the RF chain .
Requirements that need to be specified for the single and dual CC for the
following:
1) CA_X (Intra band contiguous CA)
2) CA_X-Y (Inter band non contiguous CA)
3) DLMA (Down link multiple antenna)
4) ULMA (Up link multiple antenna)
UL power control requirements in Rel-8/Rel-9 are used to test the UE power
setting accuracy. Three kinds of power tolerance are defined, including
absolute power tolerance, relative power tolerance and aggregate power control
tolerance. In Rel-10, with the assumption that most of the Rel-8/Rel-9 RF
components would be reused in Rel-10, the power tolerance per antenna port
would be the same as Rel-8/Rel-9.
UL PC for UL-MIMO has been discussed in RAN1 #62bis and RAN1 #63. In RAN1
#62bis, the following conclusions are drawn and agreed:
\- No per antenna fast TPC commands - i.e. single TPC command
\- Single path-loss estimation
\- In case of _k_ ~s~=0, power is divided between transmitting antennas in
accordance with the ratio of the precoding weights (assuming no antenna gain
imbalance compensation)
**I** n RAN1 #63, _it is agreed that No Tx chain imbalance compensation is
standardized in Rel-10._
So for Rel-10, the power control algorithm is defined per UE without
consideration on antenna gain imbalance. The transmit power per antenna port
is the total transmit power per UE with ratio of precoding weights. Then the
power control requirements should be defined per UE, similar as the
requirements for maximum output power and MOP tolerance. That is, the power
control requirements apply to the sum of power measured over each antenna
port.
Since the power control requirements, including the absolute power tolerance,
relative power tolerance and aggregate power control tolerance, apply to all
the allowable transmit power. Considering the power tolerance per antenna port
would be the same as Rel-8/Rel-9, with no Tx chain imbalance, the total power
tolerance per UE would be the same as Rel-8/Rel-9 when the transmit power is
equally divided among Tx chains for multiple antenna ports UE.
Table 6.3.5C shows the codebooks for multiple antenna ports mode with two
antenna port. We can see the transmit power is equally divided among Tx chains
except when the single-layer transmission with codebook index 4 or 5 is
configured. In this case, the actual transmit power is the calculated transmit
power minus 3 dB. The power tolerance should consider the possible additional
3 dB power step when move in or move out from other transmission mode to the
single-layer transmission with codebook index 4 or 5.

5) CPE (Customer Premises equipment)
## 6.4 Void
## 6.5 Transmit signal quality
Currently EVM performance is defined on slot bases for a single component
carrier in REL8 in the RAN1 specification. For LTE-A EVM would need to
consider the following scenarios; Requirements that need to be specified for
the single and dual CC for the following;
_Note the current RAN1 assumption assumes in the case of contiguous CC
carriers then RB can be freely allocated for the different CC carriers_
1) CA_X (Intra band contiguous CA)
2) CA_X-Y (Inter band non contiguous CA)
3) DLMA (Down link multiple antenna)
4) ULMA (Up link multiple antenna)
5) CPE (Customer Premises equipment)
### 6.5.1 Frequency error
\- CA_X (Intra band contiguous CA)
The UE modulated carrier frequency would be compared with the carrier
frequency of the primary carrier received from Node B.
\- CA_X-Y (Inter band non contiguous CA)
For inter-band CA, the UE may have separate PLLs for each band. The frequency
reference for each PLL would be from the corresponding DL CCs. The performance
requirements shall be the same as Rel-8/9.
### 6.5.2 Transmit modulation quality
### 6.5.2.1 In-band emission for intra-band carrier aggregation
Non-contiguous uplink transmission different LO and image configurations (more
exceptions) necessitate changes, but it could in fact be sufficient to test
the in-band emissions in a Rel-8 fashion. We consider a number of cases.
##### 6.5.2.1.1 In-band requirements and leakage from an unsynchronised
adjacent carrier
First we consider the aspect is the leakage of the secondary carrier into the
primary: this is normally governed by selectivity requirements like ACLR and
ACS that must be met for each CC. This adjacent CC may belong to the own
network or to an adjacent operator. The secondary CC will create additional
uplink intra-cell interference in addition to that originating from
multiplexed users. However, this case could already be a problem for Rel-8
operation since an adjacent operator would produce a similar type of
interference.
Figure 6.5.2.1.1-1 shows the case of one operator using two activated uplink
CC activated in the presence of an adjacent (interfering) operator on a single
CC. A specification of the in-band emission could potentially cover the
aggregated carriers with a possible LO component between the two carriers, the
image component of a transmission on one of the CC will appear in the other
CC. From a carrier leakage view point it may also be desirable to limit the
emission into the adjacent CC, but one may have to rely on the present Rel-8
emission floor (up to 30 dB below the allocated PRB) in any case. The power of
the interfering adjacent operator is uncoordinated and may be significantly
higher than the wanted signal levels within the own network, particularly if
site-sharing is not used. Hence the problem of leakage exists already for
Rel-8 operation and one must rely on the provisions of the Rel-8
specifications like ACLR for co-existence. Specifying leakage between CC(s)
within the same network in terms of in-band emission requirements would not
add much under this scenario, and all CC(s) must meet the ACLR requirements
anyway.
Figure 6.5.2.1.1-1: inter-operator interference scenario with CA.
Hence this suggests that the current in-band test is sufficient also for CA in
view of the inter-operator interference scenario that is already present for
Rel-8. The test would then be carried out separately for the primary and
secondary CC with due account for the fact that the LO and image frequency
positions may be different from the Rel-8 configuration when two UL CC(s) are
configured, and architectures with more than one LO are not impossible.
##### 6.5.2.1.2 In-band requirements for aggregated carriers within own
network
The adjacent interference is not only added onto the wanted signal. Next we
consider additional effects arising from the leakage or cross-talk between two
CC generated within the same device, e.g. generated by one single transmitter
chain through a single PA.
Even if the Rel-8 minimum performance requirements apply for the transmitter
chain, the in-band requirements have to be modified if applied to two
aggregated uplink CC in view of different LO and IQ image locations as
explained above. The centre position between the CC is the most likely: the
aggregation scenarios considered in Rel-10 are tailored to this case. Figure
6.5.2.1.2-1 shows a _very simplified_ picture of the transmitter emissions for
two aggregated carriers with the LO and image components shaded. Simultaneous
PUSCH and PUCCH are also transmitted on the PCC to exemplify the effects. We
remark that many more inter- and cross-modulation effects would appear for
this multi-tone scenario. The in-band emissions are measured after the FFT
which means that the impact of some of these latter effects will be reduced.
Should in-band emission requirements have to be specified for aggregated
carriers (non-contiguous transmission), it appears reasonable to allocate RB
in both component carriers in order to add to the existing single-carrier
requirements. This would necessitate additional \"exceptions\" for
\- possible LO locations
\- locations for image products originating from the allocated PRB
\- other inter-modulation products in view of non-contiguous transmission
Figure 6.5.2.1.2-1: In-band emissions for transmission on two uplink CC(s)
The shape of the general in-band mask may have to be modified since cross-
modulation products will appear around the allocated blocks, the magnitude of
these depend on the relative powers of the allocated PRB(s). The requirements
should be general and apply for any combinations of PRB sizes of the allocated
blocks. Specifying in-band emission requirement for clustered PUSCH or
simultaneous PUSCH and PUCCH will obviously necessitate multiple PRB
allocations on a single CC. Is such a test needed from a functionality, user-
and system performance standpoint?
If the SCC is deactivated and no simultaneous PUSCH and PUCCH on the PCC, the
scenario is similar to Rel-8 operation but the locations of the LO and image
are different, these are depicted in grey and black in Figure 6.5.2.1.2-2. The
magnitude of these responses would still be dictated by the Rel-8 transmitter
requirements. Similarly, if no simultaneous transmission is allowed from a
single UE (as in Figure 6.5.2.1.2-2), neither on a CC nor across two active
CC, the interference scenario would be similar to the Rel-8 case but with the
image responses smeared out across two CC(s). Here we neglect effect of e.g.
the independent power control on the two uplink CC(s) that may give rise to
differences in practice.
Figure 6.5.2.1.2-2: in-band emissions for a UE with a single PRB allocation
and the SCC deactivated (grey), and a UE in fall-back mode (blue)
The UE could also fall-back to Rel-8 operation, which would generate the
responses in blue in Figure 6.5.2.1.2-2 for a single PUSCH. The in-band
emission requirements for Rel-8 must then be satisfied to ensure coexistence
with legacy devices.
From a functionality viewpoint, it should be sufficient to verify a Rel-10 UE
supporting two UL CC(s) by using the existing in-band test case with a single
UL CC configured. This would also cover coexistence with legacy UE(s).
From a user- and system performance standpoint, the specification if in-band
emissions per CC would not reveal all effects on the in-band emission floor of
simultaneous transmission from a single UE. The following two scenarios,
\- transmission of a PUSCH and a PUSCH/PUSCH, both contiguous, on two separate
CC(s) compared to the case in which these two transmissions originate from two
separate UE(s) located on the PCC and SCC, respectively,
\- clustered DFT-SOFDM and/or simultaneous PUSCH and PUSCH transmissions from
one UE across two CC(s) compared to the case in which these transmissions
originate from multiple sources, could provide some insight on a link level.
However, the necessity to verify the in-band performance is not as obvious as
the verification of the unwanted emissions outside the allocated operator
block.
### 6.5.2.2 Error Vector Magnitude
For the intra-band contiguous CA, the Error Vector Magnitude requirement
should be defined for each CC.
When a single CC is transmitted Rel-8 EVM requirements apply.
When two CCs are transmitted with the same PSD the EVM requirements apply for
each CC. The requirements are according to Table 6.5.2.2-1. The EVM
requirements for carriers transmitted with different PSD are FFS.

## 6.6 Output RF spectrum emissions
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter
effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions, intermodulation
products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
As captured in TR36.803 the spectrum emission mask scales in proportion to the
channel bandwidth due to PA non-linearity for a single component carrier. In
the case of multiple contiguous CC scenarios should the spectrum mask be
proportional to the total number of contiguous channel bandwidth (REL8
approach) or be unchanged and be no different from that of a single CC
bandwidth?
R4-102739: Way forward
  1. Adopt the 40 MHz SEM agreed in RAN4 #52 (R4-093151) for 100+100 RB CA transmission bandwidth configuration noting that NS_x approach can be used to meet additional regional requirements.
  2. SEM requirement is defined per carrier aggregation bandwidth class.
## 6.6B Output RF spectrum emissions
The UE transmission power is controlled by the power control mechanism
specified in TS36.213, and the same power control algorithm is applied to
control the total UE transmission power for single-antenna connector
transmission and multi-antenna connector transmission. The same maximum output
power per UE is applied to both single-antenna connector transmission and
multi-antenna connector transmission, and the UE total transmission power is
always being controlled to be below the UE total maximum output power.
LTE Advanced coexistence study has been conducted and the results are captured
in Chapter 12 in TR36.942 (Rel-10), \"LTE Advance Coexistence\". For UE with
multiple transmit antenna, the coexistence study results shall be the same, if
same ACIR model is applied to the same total maximum output power for UE.
The average transmission power per antenna connector in 2 TX UL MIMO
transmission is reduced by 3 dB comparing with that of single antenna
connector transmission per UE. Therefore, the average unwanted emissions per
antenna would be basically reduced by 3 dB as well. As a result, the total
amount of unwanted emission of multi-antenna connector transmission per UE
would be the same as that of single-antenna connector transmission per UE.
Consequently, the impact of total amount of unwanted emissions from a Release
10 UE with UL-MIMO supported would be the same as a Release 8 UE in terms of
co-existence with legacy systems in the adjacent bands.
It is concluded that even when the \"per antenna connector\" approach is
adopted in the specifications, the total amount of unwanted emissions of a
Release 10 UE supporting UL-MIMO would be the same as that of a Release 8 UE
in real network if the same power control mechanism and the same total maximum
transmission power are applied. Therefore, there would be no co-existence
issue with other legacy systems in the adjacent bands even when the unwanted
emission requirements are defined as \"Release 8/9 requirements per antenna
connector\" which is also in line with the regulatory recommendation in ITU-R
SM.329.
In summary, the requirements for UE with two transmit antenna connectors are
\"to apply the Rel.-8/9 unwanted emission requirements at each antenna
connector\".
### 6.6.1 Occupied bandwidth
In some regions the concept of \"Occupied bandwidth\" is used in current
regulation to define the value of \"Necessary bandwidth\" (N.B.). N.B. may be
used in radio regulation as a parameter to separate the spurious domain from
the out-of-band domain.
As it is expected that \"Occupied bandwidth\" may be adopted as a regulatory
requirement in some regions also for contiguously aggregated CCs, it is
proposed to define in TS 36.101 an OBW requirement specifically for contiguous
CA.
Occupied bandwidth can be derived from the UE Aggregated Channel Bandwidth,
**BW~Channel_CA,\ ~** (see Clause 5.6), as follows:
Occupied bandwidth ≤ **BW~Channel_CA~ [MHz],**
in which the carrier spacing between component carriers shall be in accordance
with the nominal channel spacing defined for contiguously aggregated component
carriers in Clause 5.7.1.
The carrier spacing between component carriers is assumed as the nominal
channel spacing in order to obtain a well-defined, single requirement for the
UE equipment.
### 6.6.2 Out of band emission
#### 6.6.2.1 Spectrum emission mask
_Note the current RAN1 assumption assumes in the case of contiguous CC
carriers then RB can be freely allocated for the different CC carriers_
#### 6.6.2.2 Additional Spectrum Emission Mask
_Note the current RAN1 assumption assumes in the case of contiguous CC
carriers then RB can be freely allocated for the different CC carriers_
#### 6.6.2.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio
Depending on the adjacent channel bandwidth (single or multiple CC) it may be
necessary to investigate the impact of ALCR with different number of CC for
the following;
1) CA_X (Intra band contiguous CA)
R4-102739; Way forward:
Adopt REL-8/9 ACLR requirements for REL-10 carrier aggregation
UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33 dBc
UTRA~ACLR2~ = 36 dBc
In this chapter we present the results of a study were it was investigated
which of the ACLR requirement is dimensioning for aggregated signal which
consists of two component carriers. This study was not limited to those CC
combinations that are applicable for REL-10 instead all possible combinations
of REL-8 channel bandwidth were studied. Figure 6.6.2.3-1 below illustrates
the agreed ACLR requirements for REL-10.
{width="5.00625in" height="2.759027777777778in"}
Figure 6.6.2.3-1: REL-10 ACLR requirements
From the above figure, the following points can be noticed.
1) The guard bands around the aggregated signal are the maximum of the two
release-8 component carriers, GB~max~
2) EUTRA~aclr1~ is simulated as defined in chapter 6.6.2.3.1A in [2].
3) UTRA~aclr1~ and UTRA~aclr2~ are simulated as defined in chapter 6.6.2.3.2A
in [2].
4) The EUTRA_CA~aclr~ is simulated as defined in chapter 6.6.2.3.3A in [2].
5) It is evident from Figure 6.6.2.3-1 that the EUTRA~aclr1~ on the left and
right side of the CA signal would be different if the bandwidths of CC1 and
CC2 are different. Hence, the over all EUTRA~aclr1~ of the Rel-10 signal is
defined as the minimum of the EUTRA~aclr1~ on the left and right side.~.~
6) It is further noted that for a fully populated asymmetric configuration,
the EUTRA~aclr1~ measurements will typically be highest adjacent to the higher
bandwidth carrier.
In addition to agreed ACLR requirements also EUTRA~aclr2~ behaviour versus
agreed ACLR requirements were studied because it has been discussed in RAN4.
There is no intention to specify this requirement but the results are
presented for information. Figure 6.6.2.1-2 illustrates how EUTRAaclr2 is
defined.

Figure 6.6.2.3-2: E-UTRA~ACLR2~ definition
**Simulation procedure and assumptions**
First the operating point for the Rel-10 waveform as shown in 6.6.2.3-1 is
determined by adjusting the required backoff of the PA such way that the worst
of UTRA~aclr1~ ≥ 33 dB, UTRA~aclr2~ ≥ 36 dB and E-UTRA~aclr~ ≥ 30,
E-UTRA_CA~aclr~ ≥ 30 dB is just satisfied.
Secondly, the various other ACLR results are recorded at this operating point.
This process is repeated for all combinations of bandwidths of CC1 and CC2.
For the simulations the following RF parameters are used.

for the four limiting ACLR metrics used to define the modulator operating
point. The graph is divided into three regions corresponding to the limiting
metric.
It should be noted that the scenarios depicted on the far left of the figure
do not represent likely deployment scenarios, but they are included for
completeness.
This study showed the results of simulated ACLR values for EUTRA waveform
consisting of two component carriers. It is showed that for the channel
arrangement parameters agreed for REL-10 the EUTRA_CA~aclr~ is the limiting
ACLR metric for CA bandwidth Class C.

#### 6.6.2.4 Additional ACLR requirements
### 6.6.3 Spurious emissions
Table 6.6.3-1 is the guideline regarding spurious domain cited from ITU-R
SM.1541:
Table 6.6.3-1: Start and end of OOB domain
The offsets in table 6.6.3-1 above are from the centre carrier frequency.
Following the equation defined for wideband in the table 6.6.3-1 above, and by
assigning _BU_ to be 5 MHz, the spurious domain boundary for LTE Rel-8 channel
bandwidth is defined as Table 7.9-2 where Δf~OOB~ is the offset of frequency
range from channel edge for single carrier:
Table 6.6.3-2: Boundary between E-UTRA Δf~OOB~ and spurious emission domain
+-----------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | **Channel bandwidth** | **1.4** | **3.0** | **5** | **10** | **15** | **20** | | | | | | | | | | | **MHz** | **MHz** | **MHz** | **MHz** | **MHz** | **MHz** | +-----------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | Δf~OOB~ (MHz) | 2.8 | 6 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | +-----------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
In SM.1541, the spurious domain for multiple carrier emission is defined to
start from the edge of the assigned bandwidth. The guideline in SM.1539 and
SM.1541 can be followed to define the spurious domain for LTE-A UE supporting
intra-band contiguous CA. Therefore, the boundary of spurious domain, or
Δf~OOB~, which is the offset from CA channel edge can be calculated by the
formula below:
Δf~OOB~= _BU_ \+ (1.5  _BN_)=CA channel bandwidth+5MHz
It is recommended that the strict Category B requirements for spurious domain
emission as defined in ITU-R SM.329 [4] is followed for LTE-A UE supporting CA
in the CA spurious domain to allow global roaming and UE coexistence.

For the intra-band contiguous CA, the ACLR requirement has been defined as CA
E-UTRA~ACLR~= -30 dBc, though the second ACLR for CA is not defined now, but
we can assumed that the second ACLR=36 dBc for keeping the consistency with
R8/9, so we can get that the intermodualtion product requirement will the same
with R8/9.

## 6.8 Time alignment between transmitter branches for UL-MIMO
For UE(s) with multiple transmit antenna(s)/antenna connectors(s) supporting
closed-loop spatial multiplexing transmissions, the requirements for Time
Alignment Error (TAE) specify the maximum allowed time difference between the
signals from multiple transmit antenna(s)/antenna connectors(s). Two factors
are considered when specifying the time alignment requirements:
\- Performance impact: Time alignment error between different transmit
branches compromises the demodulation performance which eventually leading to
throughput loss.
\- Implementation consideration: Un-necessary tighter requirements on the time
alignment error impose additional cost to control the time differences
introduced by different components.
Based on the evaluation of performance loss due to TAE, it\'s proposed to
tentatively set the TAE requirements to be [130ns] for UE with two transmit
antennas.
# 7 Receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
Rx characteristic are specified for the following scenarios:
1) CA_X (Intra band contiguous CA)
2) CA_X-Y (Inter band non contiguous CA)
3) DLMA (Down link multiple antenna)
4) ULMA (Up link multiple antenna)
UE supporting closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme may be equipped with
multiple transmit antennas/antenna connector(s). For UE(s) with an integral
antenna only, a reference antenna(s) with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for each
antenna port(s). The UE antenna performance has a significant impact on system
performance, and the minimum requirements with antenna performance considered
are therefore FFS.
Unless otherwise stated the receiver characteristics are specified at the
antenna connector(s) of the UE. For UE in Single-Antenna Port Scheme before
eNodeB is aware of the UE transmit antenna configuration, Rel-8/9 requirements
shall be met by default. The requirements for Single-Antenna Port Scheme are
implementation agnostic.
UE receiver requirements with two receiver antenna connectors and two transmit
antenna connectors shall be considered in Rel-10 time frame. The receiver
requirements with more than two transmit and/or two receiver antennas are FFS.

The current reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean
power applied to both the UE antenna ports at which the throughput shall meet
or exceed the requirements for the specified reference measurement channel
_For LTE-A_
  * _Should this be applicable to all ports_
  * _Sensitivity defined per single CC or multiple CC._
Requirement that need to be specified for the single and dual CC for the
following;
1) CA_X (Intra band contiguous CA)
2) CA_X-Y (Inter band non contiguous CA)
3) DLMA (Down link multiple antenna)
4) ULMA (Up link multiple antenna)
5) CPE (Customer Premises equipment
The REFSENS requirement for carrier aggregation is defined in following
manner.
  1. One additional REFSENS test for intra-band CA and the UL allocation depends on UL-DL separation.
  2. Tx power is Pumax for both cases.
  3. The SCC is in same position always.
  4. Equal PSD for PCC and SCC
  5. No MSD requirement

Table 7.3-1 specifies the maximum number of allocated uplink resource blocks
for which the intra-band CA reference receive sensitivity requirement must be
met. . The PCC allocation follows Table 7.3.1-2 in 36.101 Rel-9. SCC and PCC
transmission forms a contiguous allocation.
PCC and SCC TX--RX frequency separations follow the specification in Subclause

### 7.3.2 Requirement for large transmission configurations
_Should the TX be specified for REFENSE be should be single RB, full
allocation (single or multiple CC)?_
Requirement that need to be specified for the single and dual CC for the
following;
1) CA_X (Intra band contiguous CA)
2) CA_X-Y (Inter band non contiguous CA)
3) DLMA (Down link multiple antenna)
4) ULMA (Up link multiple antenna)
For UL-MIMO with dual transmitters and dual receivers, the Rel-8/9 Refsens
level requirements shall apply for dual-layer transmission.
5) CPE (Customer Premises equipment)
## 7.4 Maximum input level
1) CA_X (Intra band contiguous CA)
One of the limiting factors for maximum input level is the dynamic range of UE
RFFE. For single carrier UEs, the requirement of maximum input level of -25
dBm is tested with only one radiating eNB within the frequency band. In both
single carrier and contiguous bandwidth carrier aggregation UEs, the front end
(LNA, AGC and mixer) is directly exposed to the duplexer pass band before the
Rx chain narrows down to the actual channel bandwidth. Hence, the receiver
performance would be impacted by the total power received over the operating
band for both single CC and CA UEs. In practice, a single carrier UE
performance is expected to degrade if neighboring frequencies are also loaded
since the RFFE will receive more than -25 dBm in the band of interest for the
same near base station coverage.
Two alternative proposals have been evaluated for intra-band contiguous
carrier aggregation maximum input level:
  * **_Proposal 1_** : Maintain -25 dBm requirement, change the definition
> \"This is defined as the maximum mean power received at the UE antenna port,
> at which the specified relative throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
> requirements for the specified reference measurement channel.\"
>
> to read as
>
> \"This is defined as the maximum mean power received at the UE antenna port
> [per component carrier]{.underline}, at which the specified relative
> throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum requirements for the specified
> reference measurement channel.\"
  * **_Proposal 2_** : no change to current definition, i.e., the maximum input level is defined as the total received power at the UE antenna port.
For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, each aggregated channel
contains multiple Rel9 channels. In this case, if each component carrier is
received at -25 dBm as in proposal 1, the LNA would receive a total of -22
dBm. If the performance requirement remains the same as for Rel-9 single
carrier UE, this effectively mandates 3 dB improvement in LNA dynamic range,
which requires further feasibility studies.
In order to understand the network side impact of maximum input level
requirements, let us consider a dual-carrier Rel-10 network with mixed
Rel-8/9/10 single carrier UEs and Rel-10 carrier aggregation UEs. The single
carrier UEs are expected to have 3 dB increased MCL to the base station in
this dual-carrier deployment compared to that of an isolated single carrier
deployment. Requiring carrier aggregation UEs to maintain -25 dBm maximum
input level per CC effectively tightened the coverage requirements for carrier
aggregation UEs compared to single carrier UEs. As we know, the main design
goal of carrier aggregation is to improve the UE peak rate and trunking
capability. Increasing near base station coverage for carrier aggregation UEs
relative to single CC UEs does not seem to be an essential feature. Note that
single CC Rel-10 UEs with eDL-MIMO and UL-MIMO will still have the same
maximum input level performance as in Rel-8/9.
Based on the discussion above, it is reasonable to adopt proposal 2, i.e.,
maintain the Rel-9 definition of maximum input level at the antenna port for
carrier aggregation UEs. This would allow a consistent near base station
coverage for all UEs.
_Proposal A: maintain the same definition of maximum input level for intra-
band carrier aggregation._
On the other hand, further studies might be required to verify potential
improvements in LTE UE FE dynamic range. In principle it should not be
expected that the maximum input level at the antenna port could increase with
the # of component carriers. In the case of DC-HDSPA, a maximum input level of
-22 dBm is defined for a dual-carrier 10 MHz receiver at both 16QAM and 64QAM
set points [3]. However, further studies are required to validate whether such
an input level is feasible for a wider band system such as CA_1C and CA_40C at
40 MHz bandwidth. We suggest to leave this requirement as [-25 dBm] as in
Rel-8/9 for the time being. The group should evaluate the receiver performance
at -22 dBm and revisit the requirements in the future.
_Proposal B: Leave the maximum input level is at [-25 dBm]._
2) CA_X-Y (Inter band non contiguous CA)
3) DLMA (Down link multiple antenna)
4) ULMA (Up link multiple antenna)
The maximum input level is defined as the maximum mean power received at the
UE antenna port, at which the specified relative throughput shall meet. And
the purpose of this test is to verify the dynamic range of a UE front end
(including LNA, AGC and mixer). For Rel-8/9 UE, the maximum input level of -25
dBm is calculated by the following formula:
Maximum input level = eNB Tx power -- MCL -- Body loss,
in which eNB Tx power is assumed to be 46 dBm, MCL between UE to eNB is 70 dB
and the body loss is 1 dB.
For UL-MIMO with dual transmitters and dual receivers, the maximum input level
at the UE receiver antenna port should keep the same as Rel-8/9 requirement
and shall be met for dual-layer transmission.
5) CPE (Customer Premises equipment)
## 7.5 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)
ACS is the ratio of the receive filter attenuation on the assigned channel
frequency to the receive filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).
Requirement that need to be specified for the single and dual CC for the
following;
1) CA_X (Intra band contiguous CA)
The REFSENS for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation is determined by
each CC meeting the requirements in R8/9. It means no total REFSENS for intra-
band contiguous carrier aggregation, so we propose that when we test ACS for
intra-band contiguous, the PCC and SCC downlinks are both activated, but each
is tested individually with its respective interferer, and the interferer
frequency offset refers to the center frequency of the adjacent CC being
tested. The PSD distribution diagram about ACS test for intra-band contiguous
CA is shown as follow.
So, when we test ACS for intra-band contiguous CA, the PCC and SCC downlinks
are both activated, and each is tested individually with its respective
interferer.
Figure 7.5-1: The PSD distribution diagram about ACS test for intra-band
contiguous CA with a 5 MHz interferer
For Rel-8, the minimum requirement of the ACS is 27 dB for the 20 MHz channel
bandwidth with its 1 MHz guard. For Rel-10 and CA Class C, the maximum
aggregated bandwidth is 39.8 MHz also with a 1 MHz symmetric guard. We propose
a _tentative_ ACS_CA for the aggregated carriers in the following including
effects of cross-modulation. ACS_CA is the ratio of the adjacent channel
interferer (ACI) and the total wanted aggregated signal. The proposed offset
for the wanted signal must be sufficiently above the TX noise generated by one
or two uplink CC depending on the operating band under test and the UE
capability.
The Primary CC shall fulfill the requirements in R8/9 with all other CCs are
deactivated.
For CA bandwidth class A(Table 5.6A-1), the CC meet the requirements of R8/9.
For CA bandwidth class C, there are two options to define ACS:
**Option1 is to consider the Pinterferer to the adjacent CC, then the
following requirements apply.**
The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5-1 for all
values of an adjacent channel interferer up to --25 dBm. The interferer shall
be placed adjacent to the PCC on the opposite side of the SCC, when testing
the PCC, and vice-versa when testing the SCC. The PCC and SCC downlinks are
both activated, but each is tested individually with its respective
interferer. The throughput on each CC shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and
A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

**Option2 is to consider the Pinterferer to the whole CA, then the following
requirements apply.**
The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5-4 for an
adjacent channel interferer on either side of two active aggregated CC at a
specified frequency offset and for an interferer power up to [-25] dBm.

A downlink Secondary CC shall be configured at nominal channel spacing to the
Primary CC with the Primary CC configured closest the uplink band. The uplink
output power shall be set as specified in Table 7.5-5 and Table 7.5-6 with the
uplink configuration according to Table 7.3.1A-1 for the applicable CA Band.
For UE(s) supporting one uplink, the uplink configuration of the Primary CC
shall be in accordance with Table 7.3.2.
The throughput on each CC shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the
respective reference measurement channel with the lower and upper range of
test parameters chosen from the respective Table 7.5-5 and Table 7.5-6 for the
following two cases;
> \- the interferer configured adjacent to the Primary CC,
>
> \- the interferer configured adjacent to the Secondary CC,
The reference channels for each CC are specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and
A.3.2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as
described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1). Both downlink CCs are active with the
wanted signal level on each component carrier _c_ and the interferer power set
relative to the following reference (Table 7.5-5 and Table 7.5-6)
> P~REF;c~ = P~REFSENS~ + 10 log~10~(_N_ ~RB,c~/_N_ ~RB,PCC~)
applied to both the UE antenna ports with
  * P~REFSENS~ the minimum mean power according to Table 7.3.1 for the Primary CC
  * _N_ ~RB,c~ the transmission bandwidth configuration of component carrier _c_ (Primary or Secondary) and _N_ ~RB,PCC~ the transmission bandwidth configuration of the Primary CC.
NOTE: The wanted power spectral density is equal on both CC.
The interferer power offset G~INT~ is defined by
> \- G~INT~ = 10 log~10~(1+_N_ ~RB,SCC~/_N_ ~RB,PCC~) + ACS_CA the interferer
> configured adjacent to the Primary CC,
>
> \- G~INT~ = 10 log~10~(1+_N_ ~RB,PCC~/_N_ ~RB,SCC~) + ACS_CA with the
> interferer configured adjacent to the Secondary CC,
where ACS_CA is the adjacent channel selectivity for the particular
combination of Primary/Secondary CC as specified in Table 7.5-4 and _N_
~RB,SCC~ the transmission bandwidth configuration of the Secondary CC.

**Results of a LTE REL-10 intra-band CA Rx requirements study**
**Background** LTE UE Rx requirements have been defined in REL-8 such way that
the wanted and interfering signal levels have been defined in relation to
REFSENS value with additional delta power. This delta power over REFSENS is
needed to be able to do the tests above thermal noise which would otherwise be
dominant factor in the tests. For the 15 and 20 MHz channel bandwidths the
delta over REFSENS is bigger than for smaller LTE bandwidths thus the test
configuration is relaxed for these bandwidths. The relaxation was required
because the filtering requirements get more stringent when wanted signal
bandwidth increases. The study presented below what are suitable wanted signal
levels for LTE REL-10 intra-band CA Rx requirements.

**SNIR definition**
SNIR (Signal to Noise plus Interference Ratio) was used as the figure of merit
for the purposes of this evaluation.
The noise-plus-interference power was determined by integrating the power in
the downlink component carrier allocated bandwidth for the case where the
downlink signal is absent. In this case, we have the following contributions:
(i) a transmit leakage signal from the UE, (ii) power from the interferer(s);
(iii) thermal noise; (iv) any intermodulation or cross modulation products
from these.
SNIR is then determined as the ratio of the signal power specified for the
given test to the determined noise-plus-interference power.
**Simulation Results**
In the simulations three different cases were studied and compared against
each other.
\- Rel8 specification with 20 MHz DL carrier. In figures below this is
\"Rel8\"
\- Rel8 specification applied to 20 MHz+20 MHz DL carriers. This case shows
the performance when the wanted signal levels per CC are kept at the same
level as in Rel8. In table and figures below this is \"Rel8 wanted signal
power levels per CC\"
\- Proposal [4]. This case shows the performance when the wanted signal levels
per CC are relaxed by 3 dB due to increased bandwidth. In figures below this
is \"Relaxed wanted signal power levels per CC\"
The simulations shown below are done with several receiver IIP3 values but we
use IIP3=-5 dB point as reference in our discussion when we compare the
relative difficulty between three cases listed above.
The wanted signal values are collected in table [below.
Interferer]{.underline} powers are defined in absolute terms and are same as
in REL-8 specification in all cases except in ACS [case 1 in case]{.underline}
marked with * where the interferer powers [are]{.underline} defined as
aggregated power +22.5 dB. The wanted signal power in ACS case 2 in case
marked with ** is different to Rel8 because the interferer at -25 dBm and ACS
value set the wanted signal power [level per CC]{.underline}.

Figure 7.5-8: Intermodulation
Figure 7.5-8 shows that if the rel8 wanted signal power per CC is adopted to
Rel10, the SNIR performance degrades by roughly 1.5 dB (at LNA IIP3 of -5 dB).
If the wanted signal level per CC is increased by 3dB [4], the SNIR
performance increases roughly by 1.5 dB.
**Additional Analog filtering simulations**
Below we present simple simulation results of the unwanted/wanted signal
ratios after analog filter. As said earlier, we think analog filtering
requirements should not be excessively tightened. These simulations are done
using a basic prototype analog filter with 3^rd^ or 5^th^ order Chebyshev
response. The simulation results with whole receiver chain show above should
be weighted more when deciding the actual CA UE RX parameters as they show the
effect to SNIR performance.
These analog filtering simulations shown below can be used to roughly estimate
whether the RX requirements should be changed or not.

Table 7.5-7 shows that in order not to excessively tighten analog filtering
requirements, the wanted signal power levels per CC should be relaxed in all
test cases except narrow-band blocking. This is line with receiver SNIR
simulations.
## 7.6 Blocking characteristics
The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to receive
a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an
unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of the spurious response
or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted input signal causing a
degradation of the performance of the receiver beyond a specified limit.
  * In-band blocking
  * Out of -band blocking
  * Narrow band blocking
For _LTE-A_
  * _Based on single and/or multiple CC channel bandwidths_
  * _Power allocation for RB single and/or multiple CC channel bandwidths_
  * _Per Rx antenna ports or across all antenna ports_
  * _Need to define power allocation and distribution for RB single and/or multiple CC Channel bandwidths due to UE Rx operating point (AGC)_
Requirement that need to be specified for the single and dual CC for the
following;

## 7.7 Spurious response
Spurious response is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to receive a wanted
signal on its assigned channel frequency without exceeding a given degradation
due to the presence of an unwanted CW interfering signal at any other
frequency at which a response is obtained i.e. for which the out of band
blocking limit is not met.

spurious response requirements apply for dual-layer transmission.
5) CPE (Customer Premises equipment)
## 7.8 Intermodulation characteristics
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receiver a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific frequency
relationship to the wanted signal.
_Note For LTE-A; Based on single and/or multiple CC channel bandwidths, Power

The wide band intermodulation requirement is defined following the same
principles using modulated E-UTRA carrier and CW signal as interferer. For UL-
MIMO with dual transmitters and dual receivers, the Rel-8/Rel-9 requirements
for wide band intermodulation apply for dual-layer transmission.
### 7.8.2 Void
## 7.9 Spurious emissions
The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or amplified
in a receiver that appear at the UE antenna connector.

# 9 CPE
## 9.1 General
This section looks at the specific RF requirements for CPE deployment. [Note-
To avoid duplication it is proposed that the general analysis can be included
in TR36.942 once the work in this section is completed].
## 9.2 CPE deployment scenarios
Two models are proposed for CPE deployment as shown on figure 9.2-1
  * **CPE indoor scenario (semi static indoor deployment)**. In this > case the form factor for the CPE terminal is similar to a WLAN/ > router product. The antenna for the CPE terminal fixed ands is > Omni-directional.
  * **CPE outdoor scenario (wall mounting fixed deployment).** In the > antenna is directional and is located on the outside wall of the > building. The CPE unit may be internal or external depending on > the form factor of the product.

To account for the different deployment scenario the following antenna gain
assumption are used;
\- Omni-direction antenna for CPE indoor form factor and deployment scenario.
\- Directional antenna for CPE outdoor form factor and deployment scenarios.
## 9.3 CPE operating band
E-UTRA CPE is designed to operate in operating bands defined in Table 9.3-1.

To account for the different deployment scenario and CPE power class the
following assumption are used;
\- Power Class 2 (27 dBm) would be considered for CPE indoor form factor and
deployment scenario.
\- Power Class 3 (23 dBm) would be considered for both CPE indoor and outdoor
form factor and deployment scenarios.
## 9.5 SEM and OOB emission
The spectrum emission mask of the UE applies to frequencies (Δf~OOB~) starting
from the edge of the assigned E-UTRA channel bandwidth. It proposed that the
requirements in TS36.101 would be unchanged and the existing band specific
requirements would be applicable.
## 9.6 ACLR
Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean
power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power
centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The current working assumptions for
UE ACLR are captured in 6.6.2.3 in TS 36.101 are based on the co-existence
simulations outlined in TR 36.942 [7]. These simulations are based on 24 dBm
maximum UE transmit power and 0 dBi antenna gain.
For CPE work item we need to review these requirements for the two specified
deployment scenarios:
\- Omni-directional antenna for CPE indoor deployment scenario with Power
Class 2.
\- directional antenna for CPE outdoor form deployment scenarios and Power
Class 2 and 3.
### 9.6.1 Simulation methodology and assumptions
In order to perform Band 13 CPE and Band 14 E-UTRA BS co-existence study using
static simulations to investigate the impact of CPE interference on E-UTRA BS
uplink throughput, the simulation methodology and assumptions specified in TR

The parameters of the uplink power control equation in [7] (shown in Table
9.6.1-2 below) is for UE with 23 dBm maximum power, so they can be reused for
Band 14 UE and Band 13 wall-mounted CPE to achieve the same receiver SINR
target at the BS [11].

For Band 13 desktop CPE with 27 dBm maximum power, the parameters should be
increased by 27 -- 23 = 4 dB to achieve the same receiver SINR target at the
BS [11]. This is shown in Table 9.6.1-3 below.

9.6.3 Minimum requirements
Based on the uplink coexistence studies between CPE and E-UTRA BS, it is
proposed that the ACLR requirement defined in TS 36.101 Clause 6.6.2.3 shall
be reused for CPE.
## 9.7 FFS
## 9.8 Band 13
This section looks at the band 13 specific requirements that would need to be
specified:
\- Spurious emission and CPE to UE co-existence
\- REFSENS
\- Others
### 9.8.1 B13 Spurious emission and CPE to UE co-existence
The main co-existence aspect that needs to be addressed is CPE to UE co-
existence as shown below in figure 9.8.1 and for the deployment assumptions
detailed in table 9.8-1.

The above deployment assumptions in Table 9.8-1 are based on worst case
deterministic analysis. Further work is needed to account for more realistic
deployment scenario to account for; power control, cell size, directional
antenna pattern etc.
#### 9.8.1.1 B13 CPE RFSENS
Self interference is a function of Tx -- Rx spacing, duplex filter
performance, Tx power and transmitted RB(s). For a fixed duplex gap the self
interference increases with channel bandwidth, transmit power class and RB
allocation.
###### ### Annex A: CA deployment scenarios
# A.1 General
# A.2 Intra - band Contiguous CA
As discussed so far, one of the most likely candidates for Intra-band
Contiguous CA is 3.5 GHz (Scenario #1 for LTE-A feasibility study). However,
the band arrangement in 3500 MHz for IMT-Advanced is still on-going or FFS in
ITU-R and each country, and it would be wise to postpone the RAN4 work for 3.5
GHz for LTE-Advanced until Release 11 (beyond 2010), in which the band
arrangement would be clarified in each country.
Other possible band scenarios for this scenario are 2600 MHz for FDD and
2300/2600 MHz for TDD based on the operators\' feedbacks. Therefore, it is
proposed that the following band scenarios should be studied for Intra-band
Contiguous CA in Release 10 WI. Band scenarios are presented in Table 1.
> **_(Proposed band scenarios)_**
  * **_FDD: UL: 40 MHz, DL: 40 MHz in Band 7 (2600 MHz)_**
  * **_TDD: UL/DL: 50 MHz in Band 40 (2300 MHz)_**
  * **_TDD: UL/DL: 40 MHz in Band 38 (2600 MHz)_**

Note: TBD means smaller carrier to maximize the spectrum allocations. It would
be carrier segment or extension carrier or normal component carrier.
# A.3 Inter band Non - Contiguous CA
Table 2-5 present band scenarios, which have been proposed so far by operators
co-signing this contribution. Based on the agreed approach, i.e.
prioritizing/limiting band scenarios per region, it is proposed that the
following band scenarios should be studied for Inter-band Non-contiguous CA in
Release 10 WI.
> **_(Proposed band scenarios)_**
  * **_Region 1_**
    * 40 MHz UL/DL: 20 MHz CC (Band 7) + 20 MHz CC (Band 20)
    * 40 MHz UL/DL: 20 MHz CC (Band 3) + 20 MHz CC (Band 20)
    * 40 MHz UL/DL: 20 MHz (Band 7) + 20 MHz CC (Band 3)
NOTE 1: The UL and DL transmission bandwidths are the maximum configurable
bandwidths considered for Rel-10. Re-8/Rel-9 LTE transmission bandwidths
should be possible to use in order to allow also for lower total bandwidth CC
combinations.
  * **_Region 2_**
    * 20 MHz UL/DL: 10 MHz CC (Band 5) + 10 MHz CC (Band 12), FDD
    * 10 MHz UL/DL:5 MHz CC (Band 17) + 5 MHz CC (Band 4), FDD
    * 20 MHz UL/DL: 10 MHz CC (Band 13) + 10 MHz CC (Band 4), FDD
    * 20 MHz UL/DL: 10 MHz CC (Band 13) + 10 MHz CC (Band 12), FDD
    * 20 MHz UL/DL:10 MHz CC (Band 2) + 10 MHz CC (Band 4), FDD
    * 10 MHz UL/DL: 5 MHz CC (Band 18) + 5 MHz CC (Band 2), FDD
  * **_Region 3_**
    * 20 MHz UL/DL: 10 MHz CC (Band 1) + 10 MHz CC (Band 19)
    * 20 MHz UL/DL: 10 MHz CC (Band 11) + 10 MHz CC (Band 18)
    * 40 MHz UL/DL: 20 MHz CC (Band 38) + 20 MHz CC (Band 40)
    * 20 MHz UL/DL: 10 MHz CC (Band 3) + 10 MHz CC (Band 5 or 8)
    * 20 MHz UL/DL: 10 MHz CC (Band 1) + 10 MHz CC (Band 5), FDD
    * 15 MHz UL/DL: 5 MHz CC (Band 1 + 10 MHz CC (Band 8), FDD

## A.3.1 Additional insertion losses
For inter-band CA when combining two bands there will be additional insertion
loss due to extra components needed (diplexer/quadplexer/switches). The figure
below gives an overview on how this additional insertion losses can be dealt
with.
{width="5.014583333333333in" height="3.75625in"}
Figure A.3.1-1: How to deal with additional insertion losses
# A.4 Intra - band Contiguous CA
As discussed so far, this seems more likely in bands already allocated, or
allocated prior to LTE-A deployments, where mergers or new auctions or
regional spectrum allocations lead to operators having non-contiguous
spectrum. From a Release 10 time frame point of view, however, it would be
premature to start the RAN4 work on this scenario and it would be acceptable
to delay it in later release. Band scenarios after Release 10 are presented in
Table 6.

4 General
4.1 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification TS 36.521-1 Annex F defines
Test Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each
test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in this
specification to create Test Requirements.
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 [3].
4.2 Applicability of minimum requirements
a) In this specification the Minimum Requirements are specified as general
requirements and additional requirements. Where the Requirement is specified
as a general requirement, the requirement is mandated to be met in all
scenarios
b) For specific scenarios for which an additional requirement is specified, in
addition to meeting the general requirement, the UE is mandated to meet the
additional requirements.
c) The reference sensitivity power levels defined in subclause 7.3 are valid
for the specified reference measurement channels.
d) Note: Receiver sensitivity degradation may occur when:
1) the UE simultaneously transmits and receives with bandwidth allocations
less than the transmission bandwidth configuration (see Figure 5.6-1), and
2) any part of the downlink transmission bandwidth is within an uplink
transmission bandwidth from the downlink center subcarrier.
e) The spurious emissions power requirements are for the long term average of
the power. For the purpose of reducing measurement uncertainty it is
acceptable to average the measured power over a period of time sufficient to
reduce the uncertainty due to the statistical nature of the signal.
4.3 Void
4.3A Applicability of minimum requirements (CA, UL-MIMO, eDL-MIMO, CPE)
The requirements which are specific to CA, UL-MA, DL_MA and CPE are specified
as suffix A, B, C, D where;
a) Suffix A additional requirements need to support CA
b) Suffix B additional requirements need to support UL-MIMO
c) Suffix C additional requirements need to support CPE
d) Suffix D additional requirements need to support eDL-MIMO
A terminal which supports the above features needs to meet both the general
requirements and the additional requirement applicable to the additional sub-
clause (suffix A, B, C and D). Where there is a difference in requirement
between the general requirements and the additional sub-clause requirements
(suffix A, B, C and D), the tighter requirements are applicable unless stated
otherwise in the additional sub-clause.
A terminal which support more than one feature (CA, UL-MIMO, eDL-MIMO and CPE)
shall meet all of the separate corresponding requirements.
4.4 RF requirements in later releases
The standardisation of new frequency bands may be independent of a release.
However, in order to implement a UE that conforms to a particular release but
supports a band of operation that is specified in a later release, it is
necessary to specify some extra requirements. TS 36.307 [8] specifies
requirements on UEs supporting a frequency band that is independent of
release.
NOTE: For terminals conforming to the 3GPP release of the present document,
some RF requirements in later releases may be mandatory independent of whether
the UE supports the bands specified in later releases or not. The set of
requirements from later releases that is also mandatory for UEs conforming to
the 3GPP release of the present document is determined by regional regulation.
5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
5.1 General
The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the operating
bands and channel bandwidths defined in the present release of specifications.
NOTE: Other operating bands and channel bandwidths may be considered in future
releases.

5.6A Channel bandwidth for CA
For intra-band contiguously aggregated component carriers _Aggregated Channel
Bandwidth_ , _Aggregated Transmission Bandwidth Configuration_ and _Guard
Bands_ are defined as follows, see Figure 5.6A-1.
Figure 5.6A-1. Definition of Aggregated Channel Bandwidth and Aggregated
Channel Bandwidth Edges
The _aggregated channel bandwidth,_ **BW~Channel_CA,~** is defined as
BW~Channel_CA~ = F~edge,high~ - F~edge,low~ [MHz].
The lower bandwidth edge F~edge,low~ and the upper bandwidth edge F~edge,high~
of the aggregated channel bandwidth are used as frequency reference points for
transmitter and receiver requirements and are defined by
F~edge,low~ = F~C,low~ - F~offset,low~
F~edge,high~ = F~C,high~ + F~offset,high~
The lower and upper frequency offsets depend on the transmission bandwidth
configurations of the lowest and highest assigned edge component carrier and
are defined as
F~offset,low~ = 0.18N~RB,low~ /2 + BW~GB~ [MHz]
F~offset,high~ = 0.18N~RB,high~/2 + BW~GB~ [MHz]
where N~RB,low~ and N~RB,high~ are the transmission bandwidth configurations
according to Table 5.6-1 for the lowest and highest assigned component
carrier, respectively. BW~GB~ denotes the _Nominal Guard Band_ and is defined
in Table 5.6A-1, and the factor 0.18 is the PRB bandwidth in MHz.
NOTE: The values of BW~Channel_CA~ for UE and BS are the same if the lowest
and the highest component carriers are identical.
Aggregated Transmission Bandwidth Configuration is the number of the
aggregated RBs within the fully allocated Aggregated Channel bandwidth and is
defined per CA Bandwidth Class (Table 5.6A-1).

6.5 Transmit signal quality
6.5.1 Frequency error

observed over a period of one time slot (0.5 ms) compared to the carrier
frequency received from the E-UTRA Node B
6.5.1A Frequency error for Intraband CA

PPM observed over a period of one timeslot compared to the carrier frequency
of primary component carrier received from the E-UTRA in the corresponding
band.
6.5.1B Frequency error for UL-MIMO
For UE(s) with multiple transmit antenna connectors, the UE modulated carrier
frequency at each transmit antenna connector shall be accurate to within ±0.1
PPM observed over a period of one time slot (0.5 ms) compared to the carrier
frequency received from the E-UTRA Node B.
6.5.2 Transmit modulation quality
Transmit modulation quality defines the modulation quality for expected in-
channel RF transmissions from the UE. The transmit modulation quality is
specified in terms of:
\- Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for the allocated resource blocks (RBs)
\- EVM equalizer spectrum flatness derived from the equalizer coefficients
generated by the EVM measurement process
\- Carrier leakage (caused by IQ offset)
\- In-band emissions for the non-allocated RB
All the parameters defined in clause 6.5.2 are defined using the measurement
methodology specified in Annex F.
6.5.2.1 Error Vector Magnitude
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called the
error vector. Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is corrected by
the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset. Then the IQ origin offset
shall be removed from the measured waveform before calculating the EVM.
The measured waveform is further modified by selecting the absolute phase and
absolute amplitude of the Tx chain. The EVM result is defined after the front-
end IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the
mean reference power expressed as a %.
The basic EVM measurement interval in the time domain is one preamble sequence
for the PRACH and is one slot for the PUCCH and PUSCH in the time domain..
When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing
with SRS, the EVM measurement interval is reduced by one symbol, accordingly.
The PUSCH or PUCCH EVM measurement interval is also reduced when the mean
power, modulation or allocation between slots is expected to change. In the
case of PUSCH transmission, the measurement interval is reduced by a time
interval equal to the sum of 5 μs and the applicable exclusion period defined
in subclause 6.3.4, adjacent to the boundary where the power change is
expected to occur. The PUSCH exclusion period is applied to the signal
obtained after the front-end IDFT. In the case of PUCCH transmission with
power change, the PUCCH EVM measurement interval is reduced by one symbol
adjacent to the boundary where the power change is expected to occur.
6.5.2.1.1 Minimum requirement
The RMS average of the basic EVM measurements for 10 sub-frames excluding any
transient period for the average EVM case, and 60 sub-frames excluding any
transient period for the reference signal EVM case, for the different
modulations schemes shall not exceed the values specified in Table 6.5.2.1.1-1
for the parameters defined in Table 6.5.2.1.1-2. For EVM evaluation purposes,
[all PRACH preamble formats 0-4 and] all PUCCH formats 1, 1a, 1b, 2, 2a and 2b
are considered to have the same EVM requirement as QPSK modulated.

6.5.2.2 Carrier leakage
Carrier leakage (The IQ origin offset) is an additive sinusoid waveform that
has the same frequency as the modulated waveform carrier frequency. The
measurement interval is one slot in the time domain.
6.5.2.2.1 Minimum requirements
The relative carrier leakage power is a power ratio of the additive sinusoid
waveform and the modulated waveform. The relative carrier leakage power shall
not exceed the values specified in Table 6.5.2.2.1-1.

6.5.2.3 In-band emissions
The in-band emission is defined as the average across 12 sub-carrier and as a
function of the RB offset from the edge of the allocated UL transmission
bandwidth. The in-band emission is measured as the ratio of the UE output
power in a non--allocated RB to the UE output power in an allocated RB.
The basic in-band emissions measurement interval is defined over one slot in
the time domain. When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to
multiplexing with SRS, the in-band emissions measurement interval is reduced
by one SC-FDMA symbol, accordingly.
6.5.2.3.1 Minimum requirements
The relative in-band emission shall not exceed the values specified in Table
6.5.2.3.1-1.

6.6.2B Out of band emission for UL-MIMO
For UE with multiple transmit antenna connectors, the requirements for Out of
band emissions resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the
transmitters are specified at each transmit antenna connector.
For UEs with two transmit antenna connectors, the requirements in sub-clause
6.6.2 apply to each transmit antenna connector with the uplink MIMO
configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B-2 for closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme.
6.6.3 Spurious emissions
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter
effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emissions, intermodulation
products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions
unless otherwise stated. The spurious emission limits are specified in terms
of general requirements inline with SM.329 [2] and E-UTRA operating band
requirement to address UE co-existence.
6.6.3.1 Minimum requirements
Unless otherwise stated, the spurious emission limits apply for the frequency
ranges that are more than Δf~OOB~ (MHz) in Table 6.6.3.1-1 from the edge of
the channel bandwidth. The spurious emission limits in Table 6.6.3.1-2 apply
for all transmitter band configurations (RB) and channel bandwidths.
Table 6.6.3.1-1: Boundary between E-UTRA Δf~OOB~ and spurious emission domain
+-----------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | **Channel bandwidth** | **1.4** | **3.0** | **5** | **10** | **15** | **20** | | | | | | | | | | | **MHz** | **MHz** | **MHz** | **MHz** | **MHz** | **MHz** | +-----------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+ | Δf~OOB~ (MHz) | 2.8 | 6 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | +-----------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
To improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution
bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be
integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent
noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
NOTE: In order that the measurement of spurious emissions falls within the
frequency ranges that are more than Δf~OOB~ (MHz) from the edge of the channel
bandwidth, the minimum offset of the measurement frequency from each edge of
the channel should be Δf~OOB~ + MBW/2. MBW denotes the measurement bandwidth
defined in Table 6.6.3.1-2.

6.6.3B Spurious emission for UL-MIMO
For UE with multiple transmit antenna connectors, the requirements for
Spurious emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as
harmonics emission, parasitic emissions, intermodulation products and
frequency conversion products are specified at each transmit antenna
connector.
For UEs with two transmit antenna connectors, the requirements in sub-clause
6.6.3 apply to each transmit antenna with the UL-MIMO configurations specified
in Table 6.2.2B-1 for closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme.

6.7 Transmit intermodulation
The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability of the
transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non linear elements
caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna.
6.7.1 Minimum requirement
User Equipment(s) transmitting in close vicinity of each other can produce
intermodulation products, which can fall into the UE, or eNode B receive band
as an unwanted interfering signal. The UE intermodulation attenuation is
defined by the ratio of the mean power of the wanted signal to the mean power
of the intermodulation product when an interfering CW signal is added at a
level below the wanted signal at each of the transmitter antenna port with the
other antenna port(s) if any is terminated. Both the wanted signal power and
the intermodulation product power are measured through E-UTRA rectangular
filter with measurement bandwidth shown in Table 6.7.1-1.
The requirement of transmitting intermodulation is prescribed in Table
6.7.1-1.

6.7.1A Minimum requirement for CA
User Equipment(s) transmitting in close vicinity of each other can produce
intermodulation products, which can fall into the UE, or eNode B receive band
as an unwanted interfering signal. The UE intermodulation attenuation is
defined by the ratio of the mean power of the wanted signal to the mean power
of the intermodulation product on both component carriers when an interfering
CW signal is added at a level below the wanted signal at each of the
transmitter antenna port with the other antenna port(s) if any is terminated.
Both the wanted signal power and the intermodulation product power are
measured through rectangular filter with measurement bandwidth shown in Table
6.7.1A-1.
The requirement of transmitting intermodulation is prescribed in Table
6.7.1A-1.

6.7.1B Minimum requirement for UL-MIMO
For UE with multiple antenna transmit connectors, the transmit intermodulation
requirements are specified at each transmit antenna connector and the wanted
signal is defined as the sum of output power at each transmit antenna
connector.
For UEs with two transmit antenna connectors supporting dual-layer
transmission, the requirements in sub-clause 6.7.1 apply to each transmit
antenna connector with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B-2.
6.8 Time alignment between transmitter branches for UL-MIMO
For UE(s) with multiple transmit antenna connectors, this requirement applies
to frame timing differences between transmissions on multiple transmit antenna
connectors in the closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme.
The time alignment error (TAE) is defined as the average frame timing
difference between any two transmissions on different transmit antenna
connectors.
6.8.1 Minimum Requirements
For UE(s) with multiple transmit antenna connectors, the Time Alignment Error
(TAE) shall not exceed [130] ns.
7 Receiver characteristics
7.1 General
Unless otherwise stated the receiver characteristics are specified at the
antenna connector(s) of the UE. For UE(s) with an integral antenna only, a
reference antenna(s) with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for each antenna port(s).
UE with an integral antenna(s) may be taken into account by converting these
power levels into field strength requirements, assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna.
. For UEs with more than one receiver antenna connector, identical interfering
signals shall be applied to each receiver antenna port if more than one of
these is used (diversity).
The levels of the test signal applied to each of the antenna connectors shall
be as defined in the respective sections below.
With the exception of Clause 7.3, the requirements shall be verified with the
network signalling value NS_01 configured (Table 6.2.4-1).
All the parameters in clause 7 are defined using the UL reference measurement
channels specified in Annexes A.2.2 and A.2.3, the DL reference measurement
channels specified in Annex A.3.2 and using the set-up specified in Annex
C.3.1
7.2 Diversity characteristics
The requirements in Section 7 assume that the receiver is equipped with two Rx
port as a baseline. These requirements apply to all UE categories unless
stated otherwise. Requirements for 4 ports are FFS. With the exception of
clause 7.9 all requirements shall be verified by using both (all) antenna
ports simultaneously.
7.3 Reference sensitivity power level
The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power
applied to both the UE antenna ports at which the throughput shall meet or
exceed the requirements for the specified reference measurement channel.
7.3.1 Minimum requirements (QPSK)
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in
Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 7.3.1-1 and table
7.3.1-2

The reference receive sensitivity (REFSENS) requirement specified in Table
7.3.1-1 shall be met for an uplink transmission bandwidth less than or equal
to that specified in Table 7.3.1-2.
Note: Table 7.3.1-2 is intended for conformance tests and does not necessarily
reflect the operational conditions of the network, where the number of uplink
and downlink allocated resource blocks will be practically constrained by
other factors. Typical receiver sensitivity performance with HARQ
retransmission enabled and using a residual BLER metric relevant for e.g.
Speech Services is given in the Annex X (informative).
For the UE which supports inter-band CA configuration in Table 7.3.1A-2 , the

7.5 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)
7.5.1 Minimum requirements
Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver\'s ability to
receive a E-UTRA signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the centre
frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the receive filter
attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the receive filter
attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).
The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.5.1-1 for all
values of an adjacent channel interferer up to --25 dBm. However it is not
possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and upper range of
test parameters are chosen in Table 7.5.1-2 and Table 7.5.1-3 where the
throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in
Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1).

For the UE that supports inter band CA with a single uplink in one band, the
adjacent channel requirements are defined with the single uplink active on the
band other than is the band whose downlink is being tested.
The UE shall meet the requirements specified in chapter 7.5.1 for each
component carrier while both downlink carriers are active.
7.5.1B Minimum requirements for UL-MIMO
For UE(s) with two transmitter antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the minimum requirements in Clause 7.5.1 shall be met
with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B-2. For UL-MIMO, the
parameter PCMAX_L is defined as the total transmitter power over the two
transmit antenna connectors.
7.6 Blocking characteristics
The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to receive
a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an
unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of the spurious response
or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted input signal causing a
degradation of the performance of the receiver beyond a specified limit. The
blocking performance shall apply at all frequencies except those at which a
spurious response occur.
7.6.1 In-band blocking
In-band blocking is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling into
the UE receive band or into the first 15 MHz below or above the UE receive
band at which the relative throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirement for the specified measurement channels..
7.6.1.1 Minimum requirements
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in
Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Tables 7.6.1.1-1 and

7.3.1.
The UE shall fulfil the minimum requirement in presence of an interfering
signal specified in Tables 7.6.1.1A-1 and Tables 7.6.1.1A-2 being on either
side of the aggregated signal. The throughput of each carrier shall be ≥ 95%
of the maximum throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified

For the UE that supports inter band CA with a single uplink in one band the
in-band blocking requirements are defined with the single uplink active on the
band other than is the band whose downlink is being tested. The UE shall meet
the requirements specified in chapter 7.6.1.1 for each component carrier while
both downlink carriers are active.
For the UE which supports inter band CA configuration in Table 7.3.1A-2 ,
P~Interferer~ power defined in table 7.6.1.1-2 is increased by the amount
given by ΔR~IB~ in Table 7.3.1A-2.
7.6.2 Out-of-band blocking
Out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal
falling more than 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band. For the first 15
MHz below or above the UE receive band the appropriate in-band blocking or
adjacent channel selectivity in sub-clause 7.5.1 and sub-clause 7.6.1 shall be
applied.
7.6.2.1 Minimum requirements
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in
Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Tables 7.6.2.1-1 and
7.6.2.1-2.
For Table 7.6.2.1-2 in frequency range 1, 2 and 3, up to
$\text{max}$exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each
assigned frequency channel when measured using a 1MHz step size, where
$N_{\text{RB}}$ is the number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission
bandwidth configuration (see Figure 5.4.2-1). For these exceptions the
requirements of clause 7.7 Spurious response are applicable.
For Table 7.6.2.1-2 in frequency range 4, up to $\text{max}$exceptions are
allowed for spurious response frequencies in each assigned frequency channel
when measured using a 1MHz step size, where $N_{\text{RB}}$ is the number of
resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth configurations (see
Figure 5.4.2-1) and $L_{\text{CRBs}}$ is the number of resource blocks
allocated in the uplink. For these exceptions the requirements of clause 7.7
spurious response are applicable.
