# 1 Scope
The present document establishes the essential EMC requirements for \"3^rd^
generation\" digital cellular mobile terminal equipment and ancillary
accessories in combination with a 3GPP E-UTRA user equipment (UE).
The equipment conforming to the requirements laid out in the present document
and used in its intended electromagnetic environment in accordance with the
manufacturers instructions
> \- shall not generate electromagnetic disturbances at a level which may
> interfere with the intended operation of other equipment;
>
> \- has an adequate level of intrinsic immunity to electromagnetic
> disturbances to operate as intended;
The present document specifies the applicable EMC tests, the methods of
measurement, the frequency range, the limits and the minimum performance
criteria for all types of E-UTRA UE´s and their accessories. E-UTRA base
station equipment operating within network infrastructure is outside the scope
of the present document. However, the present document does cover mobile and
portable equipment that is intended to be operated in a fixed location while
connected to the AC mains. E-UTRA base stations in the radio access network
are covered by the technical specification TS36.113 [2].
Requirements for the radiated emission from the enclosure port of integral
antenna equipment and ancillaries have been included. Technical specifications
for conducted emissions from the antenna connector are found in the 3GPP
specifications for the radio interface, e.g. TS36.521 [3], for the effective
use of the radio spectrum.
The immunity requirements have been selected to ensure an adequate level of
compatibility for apparatus in residential, commercial, light industrial and
vehicular environments. The levels however, do not cover extreme cases, which
may occur in any location but with low probability of occurrence.
The environment classification used in the present document refers to the
environment classification used in the Generic Standards IEC 61000-6-1 [4],
IEC 61000-6-3 [5], except the vehicular environment class which refers to ISO
7637 Part 1 [6] and Part 2 [7].
Compliance of radio equipment to the requirements of the present document does
not signify compliance to any requirement related to the use of the equipment
(i.e. licensing requirements).
Compliance to the requirements of the present document does not signify
compliance to any safety requirement. However, any temporary or permanent
unsafe condition caused by EMC is considered as non-compliance.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply.
**Ancillary equipment** : Equipment (apparatus), used in connection with a
user equipment (UE) is considered as an ancillary equipment (apparatus) if:
> \- the equipment is intended for use in conjunction with a UE to provide
> additional operational and/or control features to the UE, (e.g. to extend
> control to another position or location); and
>
> \- the equipment cannot be used on a stand alone basis to provide user
> functions independently of a UE; and
>
> \- the UE to which it is connected, is capable of providing some intended
> operation such as transmitting and/or receiving without the ancillary
> equipment (i.e. it is not a sub‑unit of the main equipment essential to the
> main equipment basic functions).
**Average power:** The average transmitter output power obtained over any
specified time interval, including periods with no transmission, when the
transmit time slots are at the maximum power setting.
**Camped on a cell:** The UE is in idle mode and has completed the cell
selection/reselection process and has chosen a cell. The UE monitors system
information and (in most cases) paging information. Note that the services may
be limited, and that the PLMN may not be aware of the existence of the UE
within the chosen cell.
**Channel bandwidth:** The RF bandwidth supporting a single E-UTRA RF carrier
with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or downlink of a
cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used as a reference for
transmitter and receiver RF requirements.
**Continuous phenomena (continuous disturbance):** Electromagnetic
disturbance, the effects of which on a particular device or equipment cannot
be resolved into a succession of distinct effects (IEC 60050-161 [8]).
**Data application ancillary:** Ancillary which provides send and/or receive
data access to UMTS services via UE.
**Enclosure port:** Physical boundary of the apparatus through which
electromagnetic fields may radiate or impinge. In the case of integral antenna
equipment, this port is inseparable from the antenna port.
**End- User data:** Manufacturer defined data patterns for data transfer
testing. Represents EUT´s typical user application (e.g. photo, video, text
file, message) in its characteristics.
**Idle mode:** Idle mode is the state of User Equipment (UE) when switched on
but with no Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection.
**Integral antenna:** Antenna designed to be connected directly to the
equipment with or without the use of an external connector and considered to
be part of the equipment. An integral antenna may be fitted internally or
externally to the equipment.
**Maximum throughput: The maximum achievable throughput for a reference
measurement channel.**
**Necessary bandwidth:** For a given class of emission, the width of the
frequency band which is just sufficient to ensure the transmission of
information at the rate and with the quality required under specified
conditions.
**Out of band emissions:** Emission on a frequency or frequencies immediately
outside the necessary bandwidth, which results from, the modulation process,
but excluding spurious emissions.
> NOTE: Any unwanted emission which falls at frequencies separated from the
> centre frequency of the emission by less than 250% of the necessary
> bandwidth of the emission will generally be considered out-of-band emission.
**Port:** particular interface, of the specified equipment (apparatus), with
the electromagnetic environment. For example, any connection point on an
equipment intended for connection of cables to or from that equipment is
considered as a port (see figure 1).
{width="4.770833333333333in" height="1.5833333333333333in"}
**Spurious emission from ITU-R SM 329 [9]:** Emission on a frequency, or
frequencies, which are outside the necessary bandwidth and the level of which
may be reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission of
information. Spurious emissions include harmonic emissions, parasitic
emissions, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products but
exclude out‑of‑band emissions.
**Telecommunication port:** Ports which are intended to be connected to
telecommunication networks (e.g. public switched telecommunication networks,
integrated services digital networks), local area networks (e.g. Ethernet,
Token Ring) and similar networks (see CISPR 22 [10]).
**Throughput: The number of payload bits successfully received per second for
a reference measurement channel in a specified reference condition.**
**Transient phenomena** : Pertaining to or designating a phenomena or a
quantity which varies between two consecutive steady states during a time
interval short compared with the time-scale of interest (IEC 60050-161 [8])
**Traffic mode:** Is the state of User Equipment (UE) when switched on and
with Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection established.
**Universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS):** The telecommunications
system, incorporating mobile cellular and other functionality, that is the
subject of specifications produced by 3GPP
**User equipment (UE)** : is a \"Mobile Station\" (MS) which is an entity
capable of accessing a set of UMTS services via one or more radio interfaces.
This entity may be stationary or in motion within the UMTS service area while
accessing the UMTS services, and may simultaneously serve one or more users.

# 4 Test conditions
## 4.1 General
The equipment shall be tested under normal test conditions according to the
relevant product and basic standards (See Annex E of TS 36.101 [11] for
environmental conditions). If these conditions are not specified then the
manufacturers declared range of humidity, temperature and supply voltage shall
be used. The test conditions shall be recorded in the test report.
Whenever the Equipment under test (EUT) is provided with a detachable antenna,
the EUT shall be tested with the antenna fitted in a manner typical of normal
intended use, unless specified otherwise.
Where the equipment incorporates an external 50 Ω RF antenna connector that is
normally connected via a coaxial cable, then the wanted signal to establish a
communication link also uses a coaxial cable.
Where the equipment has an external 50 Ω RF antenna connector that is not
normally connected via a coaxial cable or where the equipment has no external
50 Ω RF connector (i.e., integral antenna equipment), then the wanted signal,
to establish a communication link, shall be delivered from the equipment to an
antenna located within the test environment.
## 4.2 Arrangements for establishing a communication link
The wanted RF input signal nominal frequency shall be selected by setting the
E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) to an appropriate
number.
A communication link shall be set up with a suitable base station simulator
(hereafter called \"the test system\"). The test system shall be located
outside of the test environment
When the EUT is required to be in the traffic mode, a call is set up according
to the Generic call set-up procedure and the following conditions shall be
met:
See TS 36.508 [12] and TS 36.509 [24] for details regarding generic call set-
up procedure and throughput test loop scenarios.
> \- Set and send continuously positive TPC commands to the UE;
>
> \- the DTX shall be disabled;
>
> \- uplink power control shall be enabled;
>
> \- transmitting and/or receiving (UL/DL) bit rate for reference test channel
> shall be the reference measurement channel as specified in Annex C in TS
> 36.101 [11] with parameters specified in Table 7.3.1-1 and Table 7.3.1-2 in
> TS 36.101 [11];
>
> \- adequate measures shall be taken to avoid the effect of the unwanted
> signal on the measuring equipment;
>
> \- for immunity testing, the wanted input signal level shall be set to 40 dB
> above the reference sensitivity level to provide a stable communication
> link. The reference sensitivity level is defined in TS 36.101 [11];
>
> \- for emission testing, the wanted input signal level shall be no more than
> 15 dB above the reference sensitivity level, such that the performance of
> the measuring receiver is not limited by strong signal effects.
When the EUT is required to be in the idle mode, the following conditions
shall be met:
> \- UE shall be camped on a cell
>
> \- UE shall perform Location Registration (LR) before the test, but not
> during the test;
>
> \- UE´s neighbour cell list shall be empty;
>
> \- Paging repetition period and DRX cycle shall be set to minimum (shortest
> possible time interval);
For immunity tests subclause 4.3, shall apply and the conditions shall be as
follows:
## 4.3 Narrow band responses on receivers
Responses on receivers or duplex transceivers occurring during the test at
discrete frequencies, which are narrow band responses (spurious responses),
are identified by the following method:
> \- If during an immunity test the quantity being monitored goes outside the
> specified tolerances, it is necessary to establish whether the deviation is
> due to an unwanted effect on the receiver of the UE or on the test system
> (narrow band response) or to a wide band (EMC) phenomenon. Therefore, the
> test shall be repeated with the unwanted signal frequency increased or
> decreased by BW~Channel~ MHz, where BW~Channel~ is the channel bandwidth as
> defined in TS 36.101 [11];
>
> \- if the deviation does not disappear, the procedure is repeated the
> unwanted signal frequency increased or decreased by 2 x BW~Channel~ MHz,
> where BW~Channel~ is the channel bandwidth as defined in TS 36.101 [11];
>
> \- if the deviation does not disappear with the increased and/or decreased
> frequency, the phenomenon is considered wide band and therefore an EMC
> problem and the equipment fails the test.
Narrow band responses are disregarded.
The procedure above does not apply to conducted immunity tests in the
frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz.
## 4.4 Receiver exclusion band
The receiver exclusion band for terminals extends from the lower frequency of
the allocated receiver band minus 85 MHz to the upper frequency of the
allocated receiver band plus 85 MHz. The _receiver exclusion band_ for UE is
the frequency range over which no tests of radiated immunity of a receiver are
made. The exclusions bands are as set out below:
F~DL,low~ -- 85 \ \- the primary functions of the radio equipment to be tested during and
> after the EMC testing;
>
> \- if applicable, the method to be used to verify that a communications link
> is established and maintained;
>
> \- the intended functions of the radio equipment which shall be in
> accordance with the documentation accompanying the equipment;
>
> \- the user-control functions and stored data that are required for normal
> operation and the method to be used to assess whether these have been lost
> after EMC stress;
>
> \- the ancillary equipment to be combined with the radio equipment for
> testing (where applicable);
>
> \- information about ancillary equipment intended to be used with the radio
> equipment;
>
> \- an exhaustive list of ports, classified as either power or
> signal/control. Power ports shall further be classified as AC or DC power;
>
> \- the humidity range, temperature, and supply voltage for all equipment
> submitted for testing.
## 5.2 Equipment which can provide a continuous communication link
The test arrangement and signals, given in clause 4, apply to radio equipment
or a combination of radio equipment and ancillary equipment that permits the
establishment of a communication link. The assessment of equipment performance
shall be based on speech call and data transfer according to the criteria in
clause 6.
## 5.3 Equipment which can only provide a discontinuous communication link
(packet data/transmission)
If the equipment does not permit or allow for a communications link to be
established and maintained during the EMC tests (as in subclause 5.2), the
manufacturer shall define the performance assessment. The manufacturer shall
provide the method of observing the degradation of performance of the
equipment.
## 5.4 Equipment which does not provide a communication link
If the equipment is of a specialised nature which does not permit a
communication link to be established, the manufacturer shall define the method
of test to determine the acceptable level of performance or degradation of
performance during and/or after the test. The manufacturer shall provide the
method of observing the degradation of performance of the equipment.
The performance assessment carried out shall be simple, but at the same time
give adequate proof that the primary functions of the equipment are
operational.
## 5.5 Conformance of ancillary equipment
Ancillary equipment shall be tested with it connected to a UE in which case
compliance shall be demonstrated to the appropriate clauses of the present
document.
## 5.6 Equipment classification
Equipment is classified according to the source of power.
> \- if power is derived from a fixed AC or DC supply network installation the
> equipment is classified \"for fixed use\";
>
> \- if power is derived from a vehicular power supply (car battery +
> alternator) the equipment is classified \"for vehicular use\";
>
> \- if power is derived from an integral battery the equipment is classified
> \"for portable use\".
# 6 Performance criteria

indicator, which may be part of the test system or the equipment under test.
Specifically the equipment shall meet the minimum performance criteria as
specified in the following subclauses as appropriate.
Portable equipment intended for use whilst powered by the main battery of a
vehicle shall additionally fulfil the applicable requirements set out by the

Portable equipment intended for use whilst powered by AC mains shall
additionally fulfil the applicable requirements set out by the present
document for equipment for fixed use.
If an equipment is of such nature, that the performance criteria described in
the following subclauses are not appropriate, then the manufacturer shall
declare, for inclusion in the test report, his own specification for an
acceptable level of performance or degradation of performance during and/or
after testing, as required by the present document.
The performance criteria specified by the manufacturer shall give the same
degree of immunity protection as called for in the following subclauses.

# 8 Methods of measurement and limits for EMC emissions
## 8.1 Test configurations
This subclause defines the configurations for emission tests as follows:
> \- the equipment shall be tested under normal test conditions;
>
> \- the test configuration shall be as close to normal intended use as
> possible;
>
> \- if the equipment is part of a system, or can be connected to ancillary
> equipment, then it shall be acceptable to test the equipment while connected
> to the minimum configuration of ancillary equipment necessary to exercise
> the ports;
>
> \- if the equipment has a large number of ports, then a sufficient number
> shall be selected to simulate actual operation conditions and to ensure that
> all the different types of termination are tested;
>
> \- the test conditions, test configuration and mode of operation shall be
> recorded in the test report;
>
> \- ports which in normal operation are connected shall be connected to an
> ancillary equipment or to a representative piece of cable correctly
> terminated to simulate the input/output characteristics of the ancillary
> equipment, Radio Frequency (RF) input/output ports shall be correctly
> terminated;
>
> \- ports that are not connected to cables during normal operation, e.g.
> service connectors, programming connectors; temporary connectors etc. shall
> not be connected to any cables for the purpose of EMC testing. Where cables
> have to be connected to these ports, or interconnecting cables have to be
> extended in length in order to exercise the EUT, precautions shall be taken
> to ensure that the evaluation of the EUT is not affected by the addition or
> extension of these cables;
>
> \- emission tests shall be performed in two modes of operation:
>
> \- with a communication link established (traffic mode); and
>
> \- in the idle mode.
## 8.2 Radiated Emission
This test is applicable to radio communications equipment and ancillary
equipment.
This test shall be performed on the radio equipment and/or a representative
configuration of the ancillary equipment.
### 8.2.1 Definition
This test assesses the ability of radio equipment and ancillary equipment to
limit unwanted emissions from the enclosure port.
### 8.2.2 Test method
Whenever possible the site shall be a fully anechoic chamber (FAC) simulating
the free-space conditions. EUT shall be placed on a non-conducting support.
Mean power of any spurious components shall be detected by the test antenna
and measuring receiver (e.g. a spectrum analyser).
At each frequency at which a component is detected, the EUT shall be rotated
to obtain maximum response, and the effective radiated power (e.r.p.) of that
component determined by a substitution measurement, which shall be the
reference method. The measurement shall be repeated with the test antenna in
the orthogonal polarization plane.
> NOTE: Effective radiated power e.r.p. refers to the radiation of a half wave
> tuned dipole instead of an isotropic antenna. There is a constant difference
> of 2.15 dB between e.i.r.p. and e.r.p.
>
> e.r.p. (dBm) = e.i.r.p. (dBm) − 2.15 Ref. ITU-R SM. 329 ANNEX 1 [9]
Measurements are made with a tuned dipole antenna or a reference antenna with
a known gain referenced to an isotropic antenna. Unless otherwise stated, all
measurements are done as mean power (RMS).
If a different test site or method is used, this shall be stated in the test
report. The results shall be converted to the reference method values and the
validity of the conversion shall be demonstrated.
### 8.2.3 Limits
The references for these requirements are ITU-R SM 329 [9], SM.1539 [23] and
TS 36.101 subclauses 6.6.3.1 and 7.9.1 [11].
The frequency boundary and reference bandwidths for the detailed transitions
of the limits between the requirements for out of band emissions and spurious
emissions are based on ITU-R SM 329 [9].
These requirements are only applicable for frequencies in the spurious domain.
Table 3: Radiated spurious emissions requirements
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Frequency** | **Minimum |** Minimum | | | requirement | requirement (e.r.p.) | | | (e.r.p.)/ Reference | / Reference | | | Bandwidth**| Bandwidth** | | | | | | | **Idle mode** | **Traffic mode** | +======================+======================+======================+ | 30 MHz ≤ f \ NOTE: fc is the centre frequency of the TCH. The frequency range fc ± 2.5 x
> BW~Channel~ MHz are covered by the \"Out of Band\" emission requirements of
> TS 36.521[3].
>
> BW~Channel~: Channel bandwidth as defined in TS 36.101 [11].
### 8.2.4 Interpretation of the measurement results
The interpretation of the results recorded in a test report for the radiated
emission measurements described in the present document shall be as follows:
> \- the measured value related to the corresponding limit will be used to
> decide whether an equipment meets the requirements of the present document;
>
> \- the value of the measurement uncertainty for the measurement of each
> parameter shall be included in the test report;
>
> \- the recorded value of the measurement uncertainty shall be, for each
> measurement, equal to or lower than the figure in table 4.
Table 4 specifies the Maximum measurement uncertainty of the Test System. The
Test System shall enable the equipment under test to be measured with an
uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All tolerances and
uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a confidence level of 95
%, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
Table 4: Maximum measurement uncertainty
* * *
**Parameter** **Uncertainty** Effective radiated RF power between 30 MHz and
180 MHz ±6 dB Effective radiated RF power between 180 MHz and 12,75 GHz ±3 dB
* * *
> NOTE: If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement
> uncertainty greater than that specified in table 4, this equipment can still
> be used, provided that an adjustment is made follows:
>
> Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified
> in table 4 is used to tighten the Test Requirements - making the test harder
> to pass. This procedure will ensure that a Test System not compliant with
> table 4 does not increase the probability of passing an EUT that would
> otherwise have failed a test if a Test System compliant with table 4 had
> been used.
## 8.3 Conducted emission DC power input/output port

> \- the test level for ac mains power input ports shall be 1 kV line to
> ground and 0,5 kV line to line with the output impedance of the surge
> generator as given in the IEC 61000‑4‑5 [22];
>
> \- the test generator shall provide the 1,2/50 µsec pulse as defined in IEC
> 61000‑4‑5 [22].
### 9.8.3 Performance criteria
The performance criteria of sub-clause 6.2 shall apply.

# A.1 Calibration of audio levels
For the portable the audio calibration is performed as follows:
Set the EUT volume to provide the nominal audio level if specified by the
manufacturer. If no such level is specified, the centre volume step shall be
used.
Prior to the test sequence, the reference level of the speech output signal on
both the downlink and uplink shall be recorded on the test instrumentation, as
shown in figure A.1. The reference level shall be equivalent to the SPL of 0
dBPa at 1 kHz at the input of the acoustical coupler described in ETR 027
[25], for the downlink, and -5dBPs at 1 kHz at the mouth reference point (MRP)
defined in ITU_T recommendation P.64 [26] for the uplink.
> NOTE 1: The MRP is defined with respect to an artificial head defined in
> ITU‑T P 76 [27]. The handset shall be mounted on the artificial head such
> that the ear piece is centred at the artificial ear.
>
> NOTE 2: If the equipment does not include acoustical transducers (e.g. a
> microphone or loudspeaker) the manufacturer shall specify the equivalent
> electrical reference levels.
The voice processor may often apply noise and echo cancellation algorithms,
which attempt to eliminate or reduce steady state audio signals as e.g., the 1
kHz calibration signals. These algorithms may be disabled during the
calibration procedure. Specialised test software may be required. If the
algorithms can not be disabled then the reference level shall be measured
using a max-hold detection on the audio level meter in order to determine the
level before the noise and echo cancellation algorithms become effective.
In handsfree applications an external loudspeaker is used. The SPL from the
external loudspeaker is normally much higher than from the earpiece of the
portable in order overcome a high ambient noise level. The downlink reference
level shall be increased in order to compensate for the difference.
Alternatively, the distance between the loudspeaker and the measuring
microphone shall be adjusted during the measurement procedure in accordance
with the manufacturers specification. It is important that the dynamic range
of the test instrumentation is not exceeded.
Normally no corrections are made to the uplink reference level. In case it is
not possible to perform the above calibration (e.g., a PC card with headset)
the manufacturer shall specify the distance between the MRP and the
microphone.

# A.2 Measurement of audio levels
When the audio levels are measured during testing the EUT software shall be
configured for voice applications. If the algorithms for noise and echo
cancellation are not disabled, then the level shall be measured using a max-
hold detection on the audio level meter in order to determine the level before
the noise and echo cancellation algorithms become effective.
The level of the output signal from the downlink speech channel of the EUT at
the mobile or portable\'s ear piece shall be assessed by measuring the Sound
Pressure Level (SPL) as shown in figure A.2. When an external loudspeaker is
used the acoustical coupler shall be fixed to the loudspeaker in the position
used during the calibration. The level of the decoded output signal from the
uplink speech channel of the EUT at the analogue output of the test system
shall be measured. Pick up of extraneous background noise by the microphone of
the EUT shall be minimised.
> NOTE: If the equipment is designed for use with external transducers, they
> shall be included in the test configuration. If the equipment does not
> include acoustical transducers the line voltage developed across specified
> termination impedance may be measured

###### ## Annex B (normative): Performance assessment of data transfer call.
Throughput Percentages
# B.1 Calibration of data transfer
For the EUT, calibration of the data transfer may be performed by assessing
the throughput percentage before applying the RF immunity test signal (defined
in clauses 9.2 and 9.5).
# B.2 Derivation of Throughput Percentages
Known data patterns shall be transferred bi-directionally from end-to-end (the
whole of the UL and DL will be exercised). Performance assessment shall be
made at each frequency step. Comparison between maximum throughput and
achieved throughput shall result in the throughput percentage.
The data patterns used should be of sufficient length to give valid results
and should be equivalent to the used channel bit rate.
# B.3 EUT without data application ancillary
Data monitoring Devices are here considered as part of the Test System.
Arrangements should be made by the manufacturer, if needed, to couple the Data
monitoring Device by a method which does not affect the radiated
electromagnetic field (e.g. ultra sonic or optical).

application ancillary.
# B.4 EUT with data application ancillary
The Data monitoring Device is here considered as a part of the Test System.
The Data application ancillary should be part of the data transfer (UL and DL)
loop and is included in the EUT configuration.
