# 4 Background
The FCC designates the 2600MHz band in the US for, amongst other things,
provision of broadband services. This 2496 -- 2690MHz band is comprised of
three sub-bands or segments:
Lower band segment (LBS): 2496 to 2572MHz
Middle band segment (MBS): 2572 to 2614MHz
Upper band segment (UBS): 2614 to 2690MHz
During the most recent reorganisation of the band, the FCC revised the
regulations governing the use of this band to provide sufficient protection
for the allowed services in adjacent allocations within the band, as well as
for services adjacent to the lower edge of the LBS and upper edge of the UBS.
The band is divided into a number of channels, which in some cases are
concatenated into blocks. Licensing is on a geographical basis, meaning that
each block can potentially have a different owner within a specific geographic
area and, in certain areas, the availability of EBS channels (mainly in the
LBS) is limited sometimes to the extent that there are no EBS channels
available to lease. Consequently the amount of spectrum and exact channels
vary not only on a market-by-market basis, but also on a site-by-site basis.
This makes deployment by anything other than a TDD system challenging as it is
difficult or impossible to pair up spectrum to deploy FDD systems. This has
lead to operators to opt to use TDD technologies in this band. With the advent
of LTE and its inherent support for both FDD and TDD modes of operation, it is
now possible for operators to consider deploying LTE in this band operating in
TDD mode.
Thus, the proponents of this work item propose to introduce a new TDD band
compatible with the appropriate US regulations to enable deployment of 3GPP
LTE TDD technology in the 2496-2690 MHz band in the US. Accordingly
corresponding necessary work to introduce LTE 2.6GHz TDD band in the US is
proposed.
## 4.1 Task description
The purpose of this work item is to:
a) Study LTE TDD in 2600MHz band for a potential deployment in US, generating
a new technical report based on study results. The specific band to be studied
is 2496 to 2690MHz with TDD channel arrangement for the US and region 2 only.
b) Generate CR's to update the appropriate documents.
c) TSG RAN WG5 -- study UE conformance testing issues related to LTE TDD
2600MHz US band.
d) Any additional related issues.
The Work Item description for LTE TDD 2600MHz US was approved in RAN#47 [2].
## 4.2 Regulatory framework
In the United States the 2.6GHz band is designated by Part 27 of the FCC rules
and regulations, as specified in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations
[3]. The arrangement of the 2496 -- 2690MHz band is shown below in Figure
4.2-1.
Figure 4.2-1: BRS/EBS channel plan and LBS/MBS/UBS band segmentation
As shown in Figure 4.2-1, the band is comprised of three sub-bands or segments
[3]:
● Lower band segment (LBS): 2496 to 2572MHz
● Middle band segment (MBS): 2572 to 2614MHz
● Upper band segment (UBS): 2614 to 2690MHz
This band was originally used for Instructional Television Fixed Service
(ITFS) based on 6MHz channels to distribute educational content to remote
locations using broadcast technology. The band has since been rearranged and
the legacy ITFS stations that are still in operation are now re-located into
the MBS band segment, leaving the LBS and the UBS band segment free to provide
broadband wireless access services along with the MBS in areas where there are
no remaining broadcast stations.
Wireless broadband operators in the US use, or intend to use, much of the LBS
and UBS, and in limited cases, where no legacy broadcaster exists, the MBS to
provide fixed and mobile wireless broadband internet access.
Commercial operators can own the BRS blocks or lease EBS blocks (commercial
operators cannot own EBS blocks, only non-commercial operators such as
churches or educational institutions can) across various markets in order to
make up their spectrum holding. Due to the fragmented nature of ownership,
each block can potentially have a different owner within a specific geographic
area and, in certain areas, the availability of EBS blocks (mainly in the LBS)
is limited. As a result, in some cases there are no blocks available to lease.
The consequence of this ownership structure is that the amount of spectrum and
exact channels vary not only on a market-by-market basis, but sometimes on a
site-by-site basis.
This has lead to operators in the US preferring to operate TDD based systems
in order to make best use of the spectrum available
In terms of emissions, Part 27.53 of the FCC regulations [4] requires that:
● UEs with an output power (P) Watts must have an attenuation factor of 43 +
10 log (P) dB at the channel edge and 55 + 10 log (P) dB at 5.5MHz from the
channel edge;
● eNBs with an output power (P) Watts must have an attenuation factor not less
than 43 + 10 log (P) dB at the channel edge, unless a documented complaint is
received, in which case stricter requirements will be imposed if the complaint
cannot be resolved;
● Compliance with these rules is based on the use of measurement
instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or greater. However,
in the 1 MHz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block a
resolution bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the
fundamental emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution
bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided
the measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth
( i.e. 1 MHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified)
At the time of reorganisation of the band, these FCC measures were specified
following extensive study of coexistence issues [4, 5 and 6] in order to
afford proper protection to adjacent services.
# 5 Study of E-UTRA requirements
## 5.1 Band and channel arrangement
Technical aspects related to band definition of Band [41] have been studied in
[8] and as a result it is proposed that the frequency band for US 2.6G TDD LTE
band starts from 2496 to 2690MHz.
### 5.1.1 Operating bands
An unpaired arrangement for TDD is defined for E‑UTRA TDD in 2496-2690 MHz.
The band allocation for E‑UTRA is referred to as Band [41].
E-UTRA is designed to operate in the operating bands defined in Table 5.1-1.
Table 5.1-1: E-UTRA frequency bands for Band [41]

[41] 2496 MHz -- 2690 MHz 2496 MHz -- 2690 MHz TDD
* * *
### 5.1.2 Carrier frequency and EARFCN
The carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the E-UTRA
Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) in the range 0 - 65535\. The
relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the downlink is
given by the following equation, where F~DL_low~ and N~Offs-DL~ are given in
table 5.1.2-1 and N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN.
F~DL~ = F~DL_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)
The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the uplink is
given by the following equation where F~UL_low~ and N~Offs-UL~ are given in
table 5.1.2-1 and N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN.
F~UL~ = F~UL_low~ + 0.1(N~UL~ -- N~Offs-UL~)
E-UARFCN can be defined as in Table 5.1.2-1, by reserving a part of the unused
numbers that follow the band 40 allocation.

### 5.1.3 Channel bandwidths per operating band
The 2496-2690MHz band in US is divided into a number of channels, and the
majority of channel bandwidths are either 5.5MHz or 6MHz as shown in Figure
4.2-1. The minimum operating bandwidth of Band [41] is, therefore, proposed to
be 5MHz so as to fully utilize the spectrum in a channel with either 5.5MHz or
6MHz bandwidth. Furthermore, since multiple channels can be concatenated into
larger blocks, it is proposed that integer multiples of 5MHz channel
bandwidths, namely 10, 15 and 20MHz, are enabled for Band [41] as well.
For Band [41] specification of radio requirements are considered for the
bandwidths shown in Table 5.1-3. The transmission bandwidth configuration in
Table 5.1-3 shall be supported for each of the specified channel bandwidths.
The same (symmetrical) channel bandwidth is specified for both the TX and RX
path.

## 5.2 Specific UE RF requirements
### 5.2.1 Maximum output power with additional requirements
The UE Power Classes define the maximum output power for any transmission
bandwidth within the channel bandwidth. The period of measurement shall be at
least one sub frame (1ms). As other TDD bands, the maximum output power for
Class 3 Band [41] UE is defined to be 23dBm with ±2dB tolerance.
Additional ACLR and spectrum emission requirements for Band [41] can be
signalled by the network to indicate that the UE shall also meet additional
requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To meet these additional
requirements, Additional Maximum Power Reduction A-MPR is allowed for the
output power.
For UE Power Class 3 the specific requirements and identified sub-clauses are
specified in Table 5.2.1-1 along with the allowed A-MPR values that may be
used to meet these requirements. The allowed A-MPR values specified below in
Table 5.2.1.-1 and 5.2.1-2 are in addition to the allowed MPR requirements
specified in clause 6.2.3 of TS36.101. These requirements are based on an
analysis provided in [13] and the value of ≤2dB A-MPR for bandwidths greater
than 5MHz is based on simulation results presented in [14].

Note that it is assumed that in order to maintain PUCCH link budget that over
allocation of PUCCH resources will be applied in the case of bandwidths
greater than 5MHz to enable the PUCCH allocations to fall into RBs where no
A-MPR will be applied. The over allocated PUCCH resources can be reused for
PUSCH allocation to UEs where the application of an A-MPR is acceptable. This
operation was clarified as being allowed in [15].
### 5.2.2 Spurious emissions
In addition to the existing spurious emissions requirements specified in
clause 6.6.3 of TS36.101, the requirements in Table 5.2.2-1 for spurious
emissions band UE coexistence, as specified in clause 6.6.3.2 of TS36.101, are
required to provide protection to and from existing bands. Note that the
additional protection levels proposed are based on a study provided in [9].

### 5.2.3 Reference sensitivity power level
The reference sensitivity power level REFSENS is the minimum mean power
applied to both the UE antenna ports at which the throughput shall meet or
exceed the requirements for the specified reference measurement channel. In
E-UTRA, band specific RF receiver sensitivity is determined by the theoretical
thermal noise floor, receiver noise figure and implementation margin plus SINR
requirement to achieve reference throughput. The detailed analysis of REFSENS
for TDD bands was presented in [11], and it was agreed that the same 2dB
implementation margin (including Tx noise) applies to all TDD bands. The 2dB
implementation margin is consequently adopted to derive REFSENS for TDD bands
in TS36.101. Therefore, thanks to the same theoretical thermal noise floor and
receiver noise figure, the band agnostic implementation margin results in the
same UE REFSENS in same bandwidth for all TDD bands. Thus, the reference
sensitivity of Band [41] is defined to be the same as other TDD bands and is
given in Table 5.2.3-1.

In consideration of stringent filtering requirements for in-device ISM
coexistence, 1dB reference sensitivity relaxation is proposed for a Band 41 UE
and the reference sensitivity level of Band 41 is thus updated accordingly in
Table 7.3.1-1 in TS 36.101. However, no explicit requirement for ISM
coexistence or for filter rejection performance is specified by 3GPP. Yet, it
is worth noting that the minimum performance specification for reference
sensitivity may be exceeded. In particular, for devices which are not required
to facilitate in-device ISM coexistence, the sensitivity level could be 1 dB
better.
Also, with regard to minimum uplink configuration for reference sensitivity,
since Band 41 supports the operating bandwidths of 5, 10, 15 and 20MHz, it is
defined in alignment with other TDD bands in Table 5.2.3-2.

### 5.2.4 Blocking characteristics
The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to receive
a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an
unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of the spurious response
or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted input signal causing a
degradation of the performance of the receiver beyond a specified limit. The
blocking performance shall apply at all frequencies except those at which a
spurious response occur.
#### 5.2.4.1 In-band blocking
In-band blocking is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling into
the UE receive band or into the first 15 MHz below or above the UE receive
band at which the relative throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirement for the specified measurement channels.
##### 5.2.4.1.1 Minimum requirements
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 of
TS36.101 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal
as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1 of TS36.101) with parameters specified
in Tables 5.2.4.1.1-1 and 5.2.4.1.1-2.

#### 5.2.4.2 Out-of-band blocking
Out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal
falling more than 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band. For the first 15
MHz below or above the UE receive band the appropriate in-band blocking or
adjacent channel selectivity in sub-clause 7.5.1 and sub-clause 7.6.1 of
TS36.101 shall be applied.
##### 5.2.4.2.1 Minimum requirements
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 of
TS36.101 (with one sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal
as described in Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1 of TS36.101) with parameters specified
in Tables 5.2.4.2.1-1 and 5.2.4.2.1-2.
For Table 5.2.4.2.1-2 in frequency range 1, 2 and 3, up to
$\text{max}$exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each
assigned frequency channel when measured using a 1MHz step size, where
$N_{\text{RB}}$ is the number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission
bandwidth configuration (see Figure 5.4.2-1). For these exceptions the
requirements of clause 7.7 spurious response of TS36.101 are applicable.
For Table 5.2.4.2.1-2 in frequency range 4, up to $\text{max}$exceptions are
allowed for spurious response frequencies in each assigned frequency channel
when measured using a 1MHz step size, where $N_{\text{RB}}$ is the number of
resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth configurations (see
Figure 5.4.2-1) and $L_{\text{CRBs}}$ is the number of resource blocks
allocated in the uplink. For these exceptions the requirements of clause 7.7

### 5.2.5 Additional Spectrum Emission Mask
The additional spectrum emission mask requirements provided in 6.6.2.2.2 of
TS36.101 were intended to support this band [7]; however an editorial error
occurred in the definition of the requirements in Table 6.6.2.2.2-1. It is
therefore proposed that the table be corrected as shown in Table 5.2.5-1 in
order to properly specify the requirements associated with the band.

### 5.3.3 General blocking requirement
The blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver ability to receive a
wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted
interferer, which are either a 1.4MHz, 3MHz or 5MHz E-UTRA signal for in-band
blocking or a CW signal for out-of-band blocking. The interfering signal shall
be an E-UTRA signal as specified in TS 36.104 Annex C.
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS
antenna input using the parameters in Table 5.3.3-1, 5.3.3-1a, 5.3.3-1b and
5.3.3-2. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified
in TS 36.104 Table 7.2.1-1, Table 7.2.1-2, and 7.2.1-3 for each channel
bandwidth and further specified in TS 36.104 Annex A.

## 5.4 Specific UE RRM requirements
The relevant changes to be made to TS 36.133 on RRM can be summarized into the
following four categories:
\- RSRP and SCH_RP threshold to decide whether a cell is considered detectable
\- PRP threshold to decide whether the UE physical layer shall be capable of
reporting RSTD for positioning
\- Side conditions for relative and absolute RSRP/RSRQ accuracy
\- Introduction of US 2.6GHz band as test parameters for RSRP/RSRQ accuracy
requirement test cases.
The minimum level of RSRP and SCH_RP of certain cell to be considered as
detectable can be derived from RSRP/SCH
$\frac{{\hat{E}}_{s}}{I_{\text{ot}}}$level and band specific UE receiver
sensitivity. In E-UTRAN, such band specific UE RF receiver sensitivity defined
in TS 36.101 is determined by the theoretical thermal noise floor, receiver
noise figure and implementation margin plus SINR requirement to achieve
reference throughput [10]. Unlike FDD's band specific implementation margin
caused by different Tx noise as a result of band specific Rx-Tx duplexer
isolation [11], the implementation margin for TDD band is the same for all
bands, which is also the current implementation margin assumption to define
receiver sensitivity requirement in specifications TS 36.101. Therefore,
thanks to the same theoretical thermal noise floor and receiver noise figure,
the band agnostic implementation margin results in the same UE RF receiver
sensitivity for all TDD bands. In conclusion, the same RSRP/SCH_RP minimum
requirement as other TDD bands for certain cell considered as detectable is
applicable to US TDD 2.6GHz band.
The minimum level of PRP can be derived from PRS (Ês/Iot)~ref~ level and band
specific UE receiver sensitivity. It is determined similar to that for RSRP
and SCH_RP. Thus the same PRP minimum requirement as other TDD bands is also
applicable to US TDD 2.6GHz band.
The side conditions of RSRP/RSRQ measurement accuracy are defined as RSRP and
I~O~ level in E-UTRAN. Regarding to the RSRP side conditions, as
aforementioned, US 2.6GHz TDD band has no additional requirement compared to
other TDD bands in terms of receiver sensitivity. Therefore, the existing RSRP
side conditions for TDD bands is applicable for US 2.6GHz band as well.
Regarding to I~O~ level, as in [12], Io conditions for US 2.6GHz band is also
the same as other TDD bands. Thus, the same RSRP and IO side conditions as
other TDD bands for RSRP/RSRQ absolute and relative accuracy are applicable
for US 2.6GHz TDD band.
Regarding to test parameters, since RSRP and IO side conditions are the same
as other TDD Band for RSRP/RSRQ absolute and relative accuracy, US 2.6GHz band
can also be introduced as an applicable band for test parameters N~OC~, RSRP
and I~O~ in RSRP/RSRQ measurement accuracy test cases. As a result, US 2.6GHz
band is added as an applicable band in the test parameters NOC, RSRP and IO in
TS 36.133 section A9.1.2.2, A9.1.4.2 and A9.2.4.2.
