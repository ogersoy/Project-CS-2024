# 4 Background
This work item, targeted for the Rel-10 timeframe, proposes adding the 2 GHz
band LTE for ATC of MSS in North America to the 3GPP specifications for the
above purposes. The effort involves developing the minimum RF characteristics
and performance requirements for terrestrial FDD E-UTRA (LTE) networks.
In North America (US and Canada), the FCC and Industry Canada have studied and
approved rules granting authority to operator(s) to integrate Ancillary
Terrestrial Component (ATC) into their Mobile Satellite Services (MSS)
network(s).
## 4.1 Task description
The purpose of this band class standardization is to enable the operators to
offer enhanced mobile services through the terrestrial component with the
spectrum resources allocated and authorized for MSS and ATC in this band.
The FCC has authorized two operators to deploy ATC networks in the S-band
(Terrestar and DBSD North America, formerly ICO Global Communications) per the
following authorizations:
● FCC DA 10-60 Terrestar : 2000 -- 2010 MHz Uplink, 2190-2200 MHz Downlink
● FCC DA 09-38 DBSD: 2010 -- 2020 MHz Uplink, 2180-2190 MHz Downlink
Based on the band allocation, there are two Tx-Rx frequency separation
scenarios envisioned for this band: 170 and 190 MHz.
The ATC equipment will adhere to all 3GPP and FCC emission masks to protect
adjacent band services. It is expected that during the work item progress the
impacts will be studied.
## 4.2 Regulatory background
In 2003, the FCC and Industry Canada have approved rules permitting Mobile
Satellite Services (MSS) and Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) operations
in assigned 2 GHz frequency bands. In the US, these rules have been legislated
in Part 25 of the 47 Code of Federal Regulations, allowing ATC network
operations to coexist with neighboring bands and services. The arrangement of
the band is shown in Figure 4.2-1:
{width="6.5in" height="1.9902777777777778in"}
Figure 4.2-1: Band Arrangement
Two operators have been authorized in the band (Terrestar and DBSD North
America), 10+10 MHz each:
● Terrestar : 2000 -- 2010 MHz Uplink, 2190-2200 MHz Downlink (Authorization
provided by FCC Docket DA 10-60)
● DBSD: 2010 -- 2020 MHz Uplink, 2180-2190 MHz Downlink (Authorization
provided by FCC Docket DA 09-38)
As illustrated the allocation for the two operators demands two different
duplex spacing of 170 MHz and 190 MHz. It is proposed that this would be only
defined as one band and not split into two bands in order to keep the total
number of bands to a minimum and because there is such a high degree of
commonality and synergy between the two. It is anticipated that in defining
the performance requirements, the two duplex spacings will not yield separate
specification values due to the large separation. But in the case that they
do, the proposed methodology is to specify the worst case requirement between
the two as a single requirement for the band. Such findings will be captured
in the technical report.
The out of band emission (OOBE) requirements for this band are illustrated as
follows.
[Node B OOBE]{.underline}
[]{.underline}
ATC base stations authorized herein may transmit with power spectral density
levels up to 32 dBW/MHz EIRP. ATC base stations authorized herein must
attenuate out-of-band emissions by a factor of (43 + 10*log(P) dB) below the
transmitter power (P) on frequencies outside the 2180-2200 MHz band.
There also exists an Operator-to-Operator Agreement between S-band operator
and United States Federal Government Agencies Operating Earth Stations in the
2200-2290 MHz Band, and the EIRP spectral density of out-of-band emissions
from any base station authorized herein that is situated within 133 kilometers
of an existing Federal Government earth station operating in the 2200-2290 MHz
band shall not exceed -100.6 dBW/4kHz in any portion of that band.
ATC base stations also need to prescribe limits on the radiated power and
power spectral density of emissions in the 1559-1610 MHz band from 2 GHz ATC
base stations and mobile terminals.
+---------------+---------------+--------------+--------------------------------+ | | Frequency | dBW/MHz EIRP | dBW EIRP of discrete emissions | | | | | | | | | | of less than 700 Hz bandwidth | +---------------+---------------+--------------+--------------------------------+ | Base Stations | 1559-1610 MHz | -100 | -110 | +---------------+---------------+--------------+--------------------------------+
For a wideband carrier, the EIRP level is to be measured using a root mean
square (RMS) detector function with a resolution bandwidth of 1 MHz or
equivalent and the video bandwidth is not less than the resolution bandwidth.
For a narrowband carrier, the EIRP level is to be measured using an RMS
detector function with a resolution bandwidth of 1 kHz or equivalent. The
measurements are to be made over a 20 millisecond averaging period when the
base station is transmitting.
The eNB OOBE requires -13 dBm/MHz at the edge of the band, hence it will be
using the specifications defined in 3GPP TS 36.104. This OOBE is illustrated
in the figure below. The additional requirement for eNB for protection of the
Federal Government Earth stations will be met through an external filter and
will not be specified as part of the 3GPP specifications.

Figure 4.2-2:
The measurement instruments with a resolution bandwidth of one megahertz or
more shall be used to verify compliance with the emission limits Compliance
with this rule is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a
resolution bandwidth of 1 megahertz or greater. However, in the 1 megahertz
bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block a resolution
bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental
emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth
is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the
measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth
(i.e., 1 megahertz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). The
emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points,
one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center
frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below
the transmitter power.
[UE OOBE]{.underline}
[]{.underline}
The EIRP spectral density of ATC terminal transmissions in transmission
bandwidths less than 1.23 megahertz shall not exceed -60 dBW/Hz.
Emissions on frequencies lower than 1995 MHz shall be attenuated by at least
70 + 10 log P. Emissions in 1995-2000 MHz shall be attenuated by at least a
value as determined by linear interpolation from 70 + 10 log P at 1995 MHz, to
43 + 10 log P dB at the nearest MSS band edge at 2000 MHz or 2020 MHz
respectively.
ATC terminals also need to prescribe limits on the radiated power and power
spectral density of emissions in the 1559-1610 MHz band from 2 GHz ATC base
stations and mobile terminals.

Figure 4.2-3: the UE OOBE
The UE OOBE requires -13 dBm/MHz at the edge of the band, hence it will be
specified similarly to section 6.6.2 of TS 36.101 at the edge of the band to
meet this requirement. There is an additional -40 dBm/MHz protection at 5 MHz
away, only at the lower part of the band which needs to be met to protect PCS
operations. Detailed requirements to comply with this mask will be included in
the technical report.
S-Band UE will meet the 3GPP spurious emission requirements for UE-to-UE co-
existence per 3GPP TS 36.101. Spurious emission requirements from the addition
of this new band are expected to be the same as those required from the
addition of other new US bands in 3GPP.
The measurement instruments with a resolution bandwidth of one megahertz or
more shall be used to verify compliance with the emission limits Compliance
with this rule is based on the use of measurement instrumentation employing a
resolution bandwidth of 1 megahertz or greater. However, in the 1 megahertz
bands immediately outside and adjacent to the frequency block a resolution
bandwidth of at least one percent of the emission bandwidth of the fundamental
emission of the transmitter may be employed. A narrower resolution bandwidth
is permitted in all cases to improve measurement accuracy provided the
measured power is integrated over the full required measurement bandwidth
(i.e., 1 megahertz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified). The
emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two points,
one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier center
frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB below
the transmitter power.
## 4.3 MSS/ATC Bandwidth Deployment Scenarios
Figure 4.3-1 illustrates the S-band Mobile Satellite Services with an
Ancillary Terrestrial Component (MSS/ATC) spectrum:

4.3-1: S-band Mobile Satellite Services with an Ancillary Terrestrial
Component (MSS/ATC) spectrum
Two operators have been authorized in the band (Terrestar and DBSD North
America), 10+10 MHz each:
● Terrestar : 2000 -- 2010 MHz Uplink, 2190-2200 MHz Downlink
● DBSD: 2010 -- 2020 MHz Uplink, 2180-2190 MHz Downlink
MSS and ATC services are meant to coexist in this band and could be deployed
differently in each market. The services also need to be offered with respect
to regulatory requirements and therefore carrier placements are going to be
such to reduce potential interference. The following scenarios are envisioned
for these services. Please note that even though the figures show a specific
10 MHz spectral range (2180 -2190 MHz), it is for illustration purposes and
the same deployment could be in 2190-2200 MHz. Also the notations of forward
and reverse links in these figures signify that the downlink and uplink will
be deployed in a symmetrical manner of bandwidth allocation.

# 5 Study of E-UTRA requirements
## 5.1 Operating bands and channel arrangement
Two operators, namely TerreStar and DBSD North America, have been authorized
by the FCC to deploy networks in this band. Each of them is assigned a 10 MHz
pair: 13
• Terrestar block : 2000 -- 2010 MHz Uplink, 2190-2200 MHz Downlink
(Authorization provided by FCC Docket DA 10-60) 13
• DBSD block: 2010 -- 2020 MHz Uplink, 2180-2190 MHz Downlink (Authorization
provided by FCC Docket DA 09-38) 13
The two company's spectrum blocks are adjacent to each other forming an "inner
block" and an "outer block," but have different duplex spacings: 190 MHz for
the Terrestar block and 170 MHz for the DBSD block. Thus, defining this as a
single band necessitates that two duplex spacings be supported. 13
### 5.1.1 Frequency bands
The S-band is being specified as a single operating band supported by a single
duplexer, a default duplex spacing of 180 MHz which allows a variability of
±10 MHz. This would cover the two operator allocations defined above and is
defined in Table 5.1.1-1:

The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the downlink
is given by the following equation, where F~DL_low~ and N~Offs-DL~ are given
in Table 5.1.3-1 and N~DL~ is the downlink EARFCN.
F~DL~ = F~DL_low~ + 0.1(N~DL~ -- N~Offs-DL~)
The relation between EARFCN and the carrier frequency in MHz for the uplink is
given by the following equation where F~UL_low~ and N~Offs-UL~ are given in
Table 5.1.3-1 and N~UL~ is the uplink EARFCN.

## 5.2 Specific UE RF requirements
### 5.2.1 Dual duplex spacing
Two operators, namely TerreStar and DBSD North America, have been authorized
by the FCC to deploy networks in this band. Each of them is assigned a 10 MHz
pair:
• Terrestar block : 2000 -- 2010 MHz Uplink, 2190-2200 MHz Downlink
(Authorization provided by FCC Docket DA 10-60)
• DBSD block: 2010 -- 2020 MHz Uplink, 2180-2190 MHz Downlink (Authorization
provided by FCC Docket DA 09-38)
The two company's spectrum blocks are adjacent to each other forming an "inner
block" and an "outer block," but have different duplex spacings: 190 MHz for
the Terrestar block and 170 MHz for the DBSD block. Thus, defining this as a
single band necessitates that two duplex spacings be supported.
#### 5.2.1.1 Signaling support of variable duplex spacing
The signaling support for variable duplex spacing is already available in the
current Release 8 LTE specifications. In TS 36.331, as shown below, the
_SystemInformationBlockType2_ (SIB2) includes the _ul-CarrierFreq_ field. For
FDD systems, if this field is absent, the value determined from the default
TX-RX frequency separation defined in TS 36.101 applies. To enable variable
duplex spacing in a band, the UL carrier frequency can be explicitly defined.

#### 5.2.1.2 RF architecture
Although the proposed 2GHz band has two duplex spacings, a terminal
implementation is not necessarily required to use two duplexers to support
this band. As an example, a possible UE radio block implementation as shown in
Figure 5.2.1.2-1 below where the same antenna, duplexer, transceiver, PA, and
baseband sections are used regardless of the duplex or frequency of operation
within the band. Here, it is assumed that the RF components are sufficiently
wideband to support the aggregate bandwidth of the two blocks. For example,
the duplexer is required to have a passband of at least 20MHz and a duplex
spacing of 180 MHz. Operating with different duplex spacings can be managed in
software to provide tuning control for the Rx and Tx LO's. Frequency tracking
is always maintained on the uplink so that the UE is synchronized with the
basestation no matter the duplex spacing. The limitation with this
architecture is that only a single duplex spacing can be supported at any
given instant in time; however, a variable duplex band only operates with a
single duplex spacing until it is reconfigured by SIB messaging.
{width="6.5in" height="3.9208333333333334in"}
Figure 5.2.1.2-1: Example radio architecture supporting variable duplex
spacing in US 2GHz band.
####
#### 5.2.1.3 Impacts to radio transmission and reception requirements
To help understand the impact to radio requirements of dual duplex spacing in
this band, it may be convenient to compare this to the conventional case of
single duplex spacing. Consider as shown in Figure 5.2.1.3-1a, the proposed
spectrum allocation of the 2GHz S-band with dual duplex spacing. The outer
block (assigned to Terrestar) has 190 MHz duplex spacing while the inner block
(assigned to DBSD) has 170 MHz duplex spacing. For comparison, also consider
as shown in Figure 5.2.1.3-1b, a fictitious allocation of the same band with
single 180 MHz duplex spacing. In both of these two cases, the duplex spacing
is at least 17 times the maximum channel bandwidth (10 MHz).
Figure 5.2.1.3-1: Comparison of the dual duplex spacing S-band with a
fictictious single duplex spacing band.
#####
##### 5.2.1.3.1 Self interference and desense
On important distinction between treating the band with two duplex spacing vs.
single duplex spacing is the self interference due to transmitter PA noise and
intermodulation products extending into the receive band. In the case of this
2GHz band, however, the spacing from Tx to Rx is very large so that the self-
interference is expected to be negligible. To evaluate the self interference
at such large duplex spacing, a measurement of PA noise was made using a
commercially available Band 1 PA. Band 1 is close in frequency to S-band and
shares a similar large duplex spacing of 190 MHz; therefore, its performance
should be similar to that expected of S-band. With 28dBm output power, the
Band 1 PA noise density reaches its floor and is flat at the receiver band
with a measured power level of -141 dBm/Hz. Factoring in the 45 dB attenuation
from the duplexer, the expected self interference at the receiver input is
-186 dBm/Hz, which is much lower than the receiver thermal noise floor.
Therefore, for the 2 GHz S-band in interest, the impact from self interference
is negligible. Furthermore, because of the large separation between Tx and Rx,
intermodulation terms from the transmitter are also expected to be negligible.
##### 5.2.1.3.2 Receiver requirements
We now consider the reception requirements (i.e., reference sensitivity,
adjacent channel selectivity, blocking, intermodulation, etc). Given the above
conclusion that self-interference is negligible for this band, the reception
requirements are mainly driven by the performance of receiver chain and
interference from neighboring bands, which depends only on the location of the
DL block. Comparing the diagrams of Figure 5.2.1.3-1, it can be seen that
there is no difference between the receiver requirements for the block defined
by the inner block (i.e., DBSD DL block) and a block X DL if the band were
defined with single duplex. Similarly, the outer block (i.e., Terrestar DL
block) is identical to the block Y DL block in terms of receiver requirements.
##### 5.2.1.3.3 Transmitter requirements
The transmitter emissions (i.e., ACLR, out of band, spurious, etc) are mainly
driven by requirements limiting interference to other bands and within its own
band. We have already established that self-interference is not a
consideration for this 2 GHz S-band. Interference to other bands is a function
of the location of the UL block, the channel bandwidth, and the size of the
uplink allocation. Comparing the diagrams of Figure 5.2.1.3-1, it can be seen
that there is no difference between the transmitter requirements for the block
defined by the inner block (i.e., DBSD UL block) and a block Y UL if the band
were defined with single duplex. Similarly, the outer block (i.e., Terrestar
UL block) is identical to the block X UL block in terms of transmitter
requirements.
##### 5.2.1.3.4 Specification differences between one band and two bands
approach
The analysis and reasoning in the previous section shows that, in general,
there is no difference in the specification between defining the S-band as a
single band with dual duplex spacing compared to defining it as a single band
with fictitious single duplex spacing. . The large duplex separation makes
self interference negligible for this band so that the actual separation,
whether it be 170 MHz or 190 MHz does not affect the performance requirements.
In the Table 5.2.1.3.4-1 all UE RF requirements in 36.101 that may potentially
need changes for this 2 GHz S-band are listed. A brief discussion is also
provided to compare the difference between one-band with dual duplex spacing
solution versus two-band solution. In general, there should be no difference
in requirements between defining the band as a single band vs. defining the
band as two bands. Where there are possible differences, the worst case
specification is proposed to be used when defining as a single band. Detailed
analysis as appropriate will be provided in future contributions to support
any requirement changes needed.

S-Band.

#### 5.2.3.1 A-MPR Study for frequency range of 2000 -- 2010 MHz
Based on the assumptions shown below this chapter presents results of a study
which aims to define appropriate A-MPR for frequency range of 2000 \-- 2010
MHz belonging to Band 23. The final MPR values are subject to change based on
RAN4 determining the coexistence values for both band [23] and band 2.

**Emissions requirements and simulation assumptions**
Following emission requirements have been taken into account in this
contribution.
1\. NS_03 Mask
2\. H-Block requirement as specified in [1]
3\. G-Block -- 40 dBm / 1 MHz (This emission value was not agreed during the
time the study was made)
4\. Band 2 (PCS) -- 50 dBm / 1 MHz (This emission value was not agreed during
the time the study was made)
Following simulation assumptions have been used in this contribution
1\. PA Operating point UTRA~ACLR1~ = 33 dBc
2\. Carrier leakage = -25 dBc
3\. IQ Image = - 25 dBc
4\. Counter-IM3 = - 60 dBc
**A-MPR needed for 1.4 MHz bandwidth**
Simulations showed that when 1.4 MHz carrier is placed on worst case position
Fc=2000.7 MHz the margin with full allocation to H-block requirement is 2 dB.
Keeping in mind the fact that PA and modulator were driven with minimum
requirements this margin could be satisfactory hence no A-MPR is required.

Table 1 is divided into four sections by colouring those with different
colours. These sections map to A-MPR table presented below so that one section
corresponds one A-MPR value. A-MPR value for Fc >=2007 is the NS_03
requirement and hence not derived from table 1.

Table 5.2.3.1-5 is divided into three sections by colouring those with
different colours. These sections map to A-MPR table presented 5.2.3.1-6 so
that one section corresponds one RB_Start region.

**Summary**
Next we combine results from previous chapters into a single A-MPR table see
below.
Table5.2.3.1-7 NS_12 A-MPR table for band 23
In figure 5.2.3.1-3 below we have illustrated some possible carrier
arrangements that could be done based on the proposed A-MPR table above.

Figure 5.2.3.1-3 Possible channel arrangements for lower block of band 23
To summarize following observations can be made from A-MPR table 7 and figure
3.
1\. For 1.4 MHz no A-MPR is needed hence can be used freely but because of
large control signal overhead this is not attractive bandwidth but could be
used in combination with other channel bandwidths
2\. If frequency range is filled up with 3 MHz carriers then only the lowest
one required A-MPR also there will be room for 1 MHz guard band against
H-block. Higher block requires the A-MPR indicated by the NS_03 requirement.
3\. If 5 MHz carriers are used then the lower carrier requires A-MPR but
higher one does not require any additional A-MPR in addition to NS_03
requirement.
4\. If 10 MHz carrier is used a over provisioned PUCCH must be used like with
band 13. Then RB's locatred at RB_start =15 -- 35 do not require A-MPR but the
PUCCH carrier must be located into this region which reduced the amount of
contiguous RB's for PUSCH. Maximum contiguous allocation for PUCCH is
approximately 15.
5\. If a combination of 1.4, 3 and 5 MHz carriers is used those can be placed
such way that no A-MPR is required to any of the carriers in addition to the
NS_03 A-MPR. In addition there will be room for 600 kHz guard band against
G-Block.
6\. If satellite carriers are also placed into the band there will be several
possibilities to have feasible LTE channel arrangements.
### 5.2.4 Output RF spectrum emissions
The following figures overlay the FCC-S-Band emission requirements with LTE
OOBE additional emission mask for NS_03. It is always assumed in these figures
that the LTE channel is located at the edge of the Lower Block or Upper Block.
The unit of emission is dBm/MHz. It should be noted that the FCC requirement
within the first 1 MHz outside of the channel edge is not drawn in the
figures. According to the FCC ruling on S-band, within the the first 1 MHz
immediately outside of channel edge, the maximum emission power level is -13
dBm and the measurement bandwidth used can be 1% of the emission bandwidth.
This conforms with definition of general OOBE emission mask for the first 1
MHz.
From the figures below, it was found that the FCC has more stringent emission
requirement than that of LTE OOBE in the frequency range from 1995 to 2000
MHz. We prefer to address this emission requirement difference in UE Co-
Existence requirements instead of adding a new OOBE mask for S-band due to the
following reasons. First, the strict FCC emission requirement of -40dBm/MHz at
1995 MHz frequency range is intended to protect G-block so this is an UE
coexistence issue. Second, LTE OOBE is defined with respect to the LTE channel
instead of operation band, while the FCC emission requirements for the
1995-2000 MHz range is the requirement for the S-band. If this FCC requirement
is reflected in a new OOBE mask, it has to assume the worst case that the LTE
channel edge is located at 2000 MHz, ie.lower boundary of the S-band, as shown
in the Figure 5.2.4-2 a). The OOBE has to drop to the level of -40 dBm/MHz
just 5 MHz away from the channel edge. This requirement is unnecessarily
stringent for a LTE channel allocated not on the lower edge of S-band. For
example, for a LTE channel located in the upper half of the S-band, as shown
in the Figure 5.2.4-1 a), as far as the OOBE drops to -40dBm/MHz after 15 MHz,
the FCC requirement is still satisfied. This requirement difference for
different LTE channel locations can not be reflected in the OOBE mask.

This requirement is specified in terms of an \"additional spectrum emission\"
requirement.
##### 5.2.4.1.1 Minimum requirement (network signalled value \"NS_03\" and
"NS_11")
S-band uses the additional spectrum emission mask of NS_03 and NS_11.
Additional spectrum emission requirements are signalled by the network to
indicate that the UE shall meet an additional requirement for a specific
deployment scenario as part of the cell handover/broadcast message.
When \"NS_03\" or "NS_11" is indicated in the cell, the power of any UE
emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table 5.2.4.1.1-1.

### 5.2.5 Receiver characteristics
The frequency range of S-band (UL 2000 to 2020 MHz, DL 2180 to 2200 MHz) is
very similar to the Band 1 (UL 1920 to 1980 MHz, DL 2110 to 2170 MHz). Both
bands have very large duplex spacing so the self interference is
insignificant. It is also expected that UE coexistence emissions requirements
will be addressed by A-MPR rather than by imposing additional requirements on
the Tx filtering. Therefore, it is expected the receiver characteristics of
S-band should be the same as those of Band 1.
#### 5.2.5.1 Reference sensitivity power level
##### 5.2.5.1.1 Minimum requirements (QPSK)
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in
Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Table 5.2.5.1.1-1 and

#### 5.2.5.2 Requirement for large transmission configurations
For some combinations of bandwidths and operating bands, a certain relaxation
of the UE performance is allowed when the transmission configuration is larger
than that in Table 5.2.5.2-1. Table 5.2.5.2-1 specifies the allowed maximum
sensitivity degradation (MSD) when the UL resource block allocation is the
maximum supported transmission bandwidth configuration _N_ ~RB~ (Table 5.6.1-1
of TS 36.101). Unless given by Table 7.3.1-3 of TS 36.101, the MSD shall be
verified with the network signalling value NS_01 (Table 6.2.4-1 of TS 36.101)
configured.

### 5.2.6 Blocking characteristics
#### 5.2.6.1 In-band blocking
In-band blocking is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling into
the UE receive band or into the first 15 MHz below or above the UE receive
band at which the relative throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirement for the specified measurement channels.
##### 5.2.6.1.1 Minimum requirements
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in

#### 5.2.6.2 Out-of-band blocking
Out-of-band band blocking is defined for an unwanted CW interfering signal
falling more than 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band. For the first 15
MHz below or above the UE receive band the appropriate in-band blocking or
adjacent channel selectivity in TS 36.101 sub-clause 7.5.1 and sub-clause
7.6.1 shall be applied.
##### 5.2.6.2.1 Minimum requirements
. The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channels as specified in Annexes A.2.2, A.2.3 and A.3.2 (with one
sided dynamic OCNG Pattern OP.1 FDD/TDD for the DL-signal as described in
Annex A.5.1.1/A.5.2.1) with parameters specified in Tables 5.2.6.2.1-1 and
5.2.6.2.1-2.
For Table 5.2.6.2.1-2 in frequency range 1, 2 and 3, up to
$\text{max}$exceptions are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each
assigned frequency channel when measured using a 1MHz step size, where
$N_{\text{RB}}$ is the number of resource blocks in the downlink transmission
bandwidth configuration (see Figure 5.4.2-1). For these exceptions the
requirements of clause 7.7 Spurious response are applicable.
For Table 5.2.6.2.1-2 in frequency range 4, up to $\text{max}$exceptions are
allowed for spurious response frequencies in each assigned frequency channel
when measured using a 1MHz step size, where $N_{\text{RB}}$ is the number of
resource blocks in the downlink transmission bandwidth configurations (see
Figure 5.4.2-1 of TS 36.101) and $L_{\text{CRBs}}$ is the number of resource
blocks allocated in the uplink. For these exceptions the requirements of
clause 7.7 spurious response are applicable.

### 5.2.7 UE Co-existence Consideration
Below are presented measurement results from [3].

{width="6.297916666666667in" height="3.8402777777777777in"}
5.2.7-4: LTE band2 results
In results analysis, Power level of -44dBm is used as a blocking requirement
in all test cases presented in contribution [3].
On GSM1900 band there is at least 20 dB margin (worst case) and typically
margin is > 25 dB.
On WCDMA band 2 there is at least 22 dB margin (worst case) and typically
margin is > 20 dB.
On CDMA2000 (1900) there is at least 27 dB margin (worst case) and typically
margin is > 30 dB.
On LTE band 2 there is at least 18 dB margin (worst case) and typically margin
is > 25 dB.
Based on measured devices [3], conclusion is that Band 23 UE (simulated by
signal generator) is not causing blocking interference to measured UE's
operating in 1900 MHz band. From the results it can be seen also that measured
UE's are having significant margin to required blocking levels. This
conclusion is based on a single round of measurements with eight (8) UEs and
additional measurements, if performed, can be presented later on. If the
results of future measurements are different, this conclusion can be revised.
## 5.3 Specific BS RF requirements
### 5.3.1 Operating band unwanted emissions
The operating band unwanted emission limits are defined from 10 MHz below the
lowest frequency of the downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest
frequency of the downlink operating band. The requirements shall apply
whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier or multi-carrier)
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.
As discussed in Section 4, the BS out-of-band-emission limits mandated by the
FCC for this band are the same as those of the PCS (E-UTRA Band 2) and AWS-1
(E-UTRA Band 4), i.e. attenuate out-of-band emissions by a factor of (43 +
10*log(P) dB) below the transmitter power (P) for a resolution bandwidth of 1
MHz or greater. Therefore, the general limits for Category A (as specified in
Tables 6.6.3.1-4 to 6.6.3.1-6 of TS 36.104) and the additional limits for
E‑UTRA bands >1GHz as specified in Table 6.6.3.3-2 of TS 36.104 for E-UTRA
Bands 2 and 4 shall also be applied for this band. When the E-UTRA channel
edge is aligned with a licensee's band edge, the additional limits outside the
E-UTRA channel in Table 6.6.3.3-2 are identical to the FCC emission limits
outside the licensee's band. The general (Category A) limits for E‑UTRA bands
>1GHz and the additional (FCC) limits for this band are shown in Figure
5.3.1-1 below for the 1.4MHz, 3MHz, 5MHz and 10MHz channel bandwidth options.
Note that the general limits for Category B are not applicable in North
America, and thus need not be specified for this band.

### 5.3.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements
These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the E-UTRA BS downlink operating band. The limits
may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the
same geographical area as the E-UTRA BS, or they may be set by local or
regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an E-UTRA operating band.
Through the RAN4 process there have been coexistence challenges identified
between the proposed Bands [23] and [25], as well as potentially Band 2. After
many months of analysis and negotiation, the coexistence values captured in
this Technical Report represent the best compromise feasible at present, and
may need to be revisited in the future.
The E-UTRA BS spurious emissions limits currently specified for co-existence
with systems operating in other frequency bands are more stringent than the
out-of-band emissions limits by the FCC. To ensure sufficient protection to
the co-existing systems, the same limits as the other E-UTRA bands BS shall be
specified for this band in Clause 6.6.4.3 of TS 36.104 and Clause 6.6.4.5.4 of
TS 36.141. And to ensure sufficient protection from the co-existing systems,
the same limits as the other E-UTRA bands BS shall be specified for
coexistence with the BS in this band in Clause 6.6.4.3 of TS 36.104 and Clause
6.6.4.5.4 of TS 36.141. This is shown in Table 5.3.2-1.
For operation of a BS in Band [25], parts of the limits in Table 5.3.2-1
covering 2000-2005 MHz would according to the definition of spurious emissions
not be applicable, since it is less than 10 MHz from the highest frequency of
the downlink operating band. In order for the limit to apply, the Band [25]
requirement will have to be identified as an exception in the introduction of
clause 6.6.4 of TS 36.104, which will be normative. Also, for information,
Note 1 below Table 6.6.4.3.1-1 of TS 36.104 will have to be modified to
indicate that Band [25] is an exception to Note 1.
Table 5.3.2-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for E-UTRA BS for co-existence
with systems operating in other frequency bands:
* * *
System type for E-UTRA to co-exist with Frequency range for co-existence
requirement Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note E-UTRA Band [23] 2180 ‑
2200 MHz -52 dBm 1 MHz This requirement does not apply to E-UTRA BS operating
in Band [23]. 2000 - 2020 MHz -49 dBm 1 MHz This requirement does not apply to
E-UTRA BS operating in Band [23], since it is already covered by the
requirement in subclause 6.6.4.2. This requirement does not apply for BS
operating in Bands 2 or [25], where the limits are defined separately. 2000 --
2010 MHz **-30** dBm 1 MHz This requirement only applies to E-UTRA BS
operating in Band 2 or [25]. This requirement applies starting 5 MHz above the
Band [25] downlink operating band. (Note 3) 2010 -- 2020 MHz -49 dBm 1 MHz  
NOTE 3: This requirement does not apply to a Band 2 E-UTRA BS of an earlier
release. In addition, it does not apply to an E-UTRA Band 2 BS from an earlier
release manufactured before 31 December, 2012, which is upgraded to support
Rel-10 features, where the upgrade does not affect existing RF parts of the
radio unit related to this requirement.
* * *
Moreover, as discussed in Section 4, the BS in this band shall meet the
following limits on emissions in the 1559-1610 MHz band as requested in FCC DA
09-38 and FCC DA 10-60 as shown in Table 5.3.2-2 below:
Table 5.3.2-2: FCC emission limits in the 1559-1610 MHz band:
+---------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | | Frequency | dBW/MHz EIRP | dBW EIRP of | | | | | discrete | | | | (Measurement | emissions | | | | bandwidth = 1 | | | | | MHz) | of less than | | | | | 700 Hz | | | | | bandwidth | | | | | | | | | | (Measurement | | | | | bandwidth = 1 | | | | | kHz) | +---------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | Base Stations | 1559-1610 MHz | -100 | -110 | +---------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+
Therefore, these requirements shall be specified as additional spurious
emissions requirements for this band in Clause 6.6.4.3 of TS 36.104 and Clause
6.6.4.5.4 of TS 36.141. Note that the limits by the FCC in the 1559-1610 MHz
band (as shown in Table 5.3-2) are defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the
antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss).
The EIRP level is calculated using: EIRP = P~Tx~ + G~ant~ where P~Tx~ denotes
the BS transmitted power at the antenna connector, G~ant~ equals the BS
antenna gain minus feeder loss.
### 5.3.3 Co-location with other base stations
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA BS are
co-located with an E-UTRA BS. The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss
between transmitter and receiver and are based on co-location with base
stations of the same class.
The E-UTRA BS spurious emissions limits currently specified for co-location
with another BS are more stringent than the out-of-band emissions limits by
the FCC. To ensure sufficient protection to the co-located BS, the same limits
as the other E-UTRA bands BS shall be specified for this band in Clause
6.6.4.4 of TS 36.104 and Clause 6.6.4.5.5 of TS 36.141. And to ensure
sufficient protection from the co-located BS, the same limits as the other
E-UTRA bands BS shall be specified for co-location with the BS in this band in
Clause 6.6.4.4 of TS 36.104 and Clause 6.6.4.5.5 of TS 36.141.
### 5.3.4 General blocking requirement
The blocking characteristics is a measure of the receiver ability to receive a
wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an unwanted
interferer, which are either a 1.4MHz, 3MHz or 5MHz E-UTRA signal for in-band
blocking or a CW signal for out-of-band blocking.
The general blocking requirements currently specified for E-UTRA BS apply the
in-band blocking signal within the +/-20 MHz of the UL frequency range of a
band, except when the DL frequency range of the same band falls within such
range. Since the duplex distance of this band is larger than 20 MHz and thus
no exception is needed, the same general blocking requirements as specified
for E-UTRA Bands 2 and 5 BS shall be specified for this band in Clause 7.6.1
of TS 36.104 and Clause 7.6.5.1 of TS 36.141 to ensure sufficient BS receiver
blocking ability.
### 5.3.5 Blocking requirement for co-location with other base stations
This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of
E-UTRA BS receivers when GSM, UTRA or E-UTRA BS operating in a different
frequency band are co-located with an E-UTRA BS. The requirements assume a 30
dB coupling loss between interfering transmitter and E-UTRA BS receiver and
are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.
The blocking requirements currently specified for E-UTRA BS when co-located
with BS in other frequency bands do not apply when the interfering signal
falls within the +/-10 MHz of the UL frequency range of a band, except for
Band 13 in order to allow co-location with Band 14 BS. The blocking
requirements shall be specified for this band in Clause 7.6.2 of TS 36.104 and
Clause 7.6.5.2 of TS 36.141 using the same interfering signal as the other
E-UTRA bands BS, but do not apply when the interfering signal falls within -10
MHz and +10 MHz of the UL frequency range of this band (i.e. 1990 -- 2030
MHz).
