# 4 UE radio access capability parameters
The following subclauses define the UE radio access capability parameters and
minimum capabilities for MBMS capable UE. Only parameters for which there is
the possibility for UEs to signal different values are considered as UE radio
access capability parameters. Therefore, mandatory capabilities that are the
same for all UEs are not listed here. Also capabilities which are optional or
conditionally mandatory for UEs to implement but do not have UE radio access
capability parameter are listed in this specification.
E-UTRAN needs to respect the signalled UE radio access capability parameters
when configuring the UE and when scheduling the UE.
All parameters shown in italics are signalled and correspond to a field
defined in TS 36.331 [5].
## 4.1 _ue-Category_
The field _ue-Category_ defines a combined uplink and downlink capability. The
parameters set by the UE Category are defined in subclause 4.2. Tables 4.1-1
and 4.1-2 define the downlink and, respectively, uplink physical layer
parameter values for each UE Category. A UE indicating category 6 or 7 shall
also indicate category 4\. A UE indicating category 8 shall also indicate
category 5. Table 4.1-4 defines the minimum capability for the maximum number
of bits of a MCH transport block received within a TTI for an MBMS capable UE.

component carriers which the UE can aggregate, regardless of whether or not
the UE indicates support of baseband capability for multi-cluster PUSCH
transmission within a component carrier using this field..

UE. For each band, support for either only half duplex operation, or full
duplex operation is indicated. For TDD, the half duplex indication is not
applicable.
#### 4.3.5.2 supportedBandCombination
This field defines the carrier aggregation and MIMO capabilities supported by
the UE for configurations with inter-band, intra-band non-contiguous, intra-
band contiguous carrier aggregation and without carrier aggregation. For each
band in a band combination the UE provides the supported CA bandwidth classes
and the corresponding MIMO capabilities for the downlink. The UE also has to
provide the supported uplink CA bandwidth class and the corresponding MIMO
capability for at least one band in the band combination. A MIMO capability
applies to all carriers of a bandwidth class of a band in a band combination.
In all non-CA band combinations the UE shall indicate a bandwidth class
supporting the maximum channel bandwidth defined for the band.
In all non-CA band combinations the UE shall indicate at least the number of
layers for spatial multiplexing according to the UE's Rel-8/9 category (Cat.
1-5). If the UE provides a Rel-10 category (Cat. 6-8) it shall indicate at
least the number of layers according to that category for at least one band
combination. In all other band combinations a UE indicating a category between
2 and 8 shall indicate support for at least 2 layers for downlink spatial
multiplexing for all bands. The indicated number of layers for spatial
multiplexing may exceed the number of layers required according to the
category indicated by the UE. The carrier aggregation and MIMO capabilities
indicated for at least one band combination shall meet the processing
requirements defined by the physical layer parameter values in the UE category
(i.e., maximum number of DL-SCH/UL-SCH transport block bits
received/transmitted within a TTI, maximum number of bits of a DL-SCH/UL-SCH
transport block received/transmitted within a TTI, and total number of soft
channel bits for downlink).
NOTE: For the purposes of determining whether the carrier aggregation and MIMO
capabilities indicated for a band combination meets the processing
requirements defined by the physical layer parameter values in the UE category
as described above, the carrier aggregation and MIMO capabilities indicated
for a band combination is considered to meet the processing requirements if
the UE supports the maximum processing requirements defined by the UE category
assuming 20MHz channel bandwidth is supported on all bands.
The UE shall support release of any SCell without requiring reconfiguration of
parameters related to UE radio access capabilities for the remaining serving
cells, except for release of an SCell from a contiguous CA band configuration
that results in a non-contiguous CA band configuration, and set the
_supportedBandCombination_ accordingly.

these measurements.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Guideline on maximum number of DL PDCP SDUs
per TTI
In order to help the dimensioning of the UE design, values for the maximum
number of DL PDCP SDUs per TTI from Table A-1 may be used.
Note: Due to the need for the network buffer data for efficient scheduling,
values for Category 1 and 2 are same. It is not expected that category 1 UE
has to sustain the same rate of PDCP SDUs per TTI as category 2 for prolonged
period of time.
Table A-1: Maximum values for DL PDCP SDUs per TTI
* * *
UE Category Maximum number of PDCP SDUs per TTI Category 1 10 Category 2 10
Category 3 20 Category 4 30 Category 5 50 Category 6 50 Category 7 50
