CA Carrier Aggregation
# 4 General
## 4.1 Base station classes
Unless stated otherwise in clause 4.2, CA related requirements would apply to
all BS classes.
It would need to be investigated if the LA and Home BS class specific
requirements for Base station output power remain appropriate under CA:
6.2 Base station output power (this might require co-existence studies)
6.2.4 Home BS output power for adjacent E-UTRA channel protection
6.2.4 Home BS output power for adjacent E-UTRA channel protection
● the Home BS output power behaviour with intra-band CA and two adjacent
operators is not defined and requires further considerations
Also the operating band unwanted emissions for LA and Home BS class would
require further considerations.
It is proposed to limit the FDD BS CA related RF requirements within the Rel10
timeframe to the WA BS class.
## 4.2 Regional requirements
No changes are foreseen for this clause.
## Applicability of requirements
For a BS conforming to both, 36- and 37-series of specifications there would
be a significant overlap among the core RF requirements and the related
conformance testing efforts. In many cases the corresponding MSR RF core
requirements are either identical or more stringent and hence any E-UTRA
capable BS compliant to 37-series is also compliant to 36-series for these
requirements.
It is proposed for a BS additionally conforming to TS 37.104, that conformance
to some of the RF requirements in TS36.104 can be demonstrated through the
corresponding requirements in TS 37.104. This can be captured within TS 36.104
by adding a new clause, '4.4 Applicability of requirements'.
# 5 Operating bands and channel arrangement
## 5.1 General
No changes are foreseen for this clause.
## 5.2 Void
## 5.3 Void
## 5.4 Void
## 5.5 Operating bands
**A** _Carrier aggregation configuration_ **is defined as** a set of one or
more operating bands across which the BS aggregates carriers with a specific
set of technical requirements. The carrier aggregation configurations shall be
defined in appropriate Tables.
The supported carrier aggregation configuration(s) and the maximum bandwidth
supported by the BS in which multiple carriers can be aggregated on the UL and
DL within an operating band shall be declared by the manufacturer.
## Channel bandwidth
Figure 5.6-1 below illustrates the channel bandwidth for contiguous carrier
aggregation.
Figure 5.6-1 Definition of Aggregated Channel Bandwidth for contiguous carrier
aggregation
The _lower edge_ of the _Aggregated Channel Bandwidth_ (**BW~Channel_CA~**) is
defined as F~edge_low~ = F~C_low~ -- F~offset.~
The _higher edge_ of the aggregated channel bandwidth is defined as
F~edge_high~ = F~C_high~ + F~offset.~
The _Aggregated Channel Bandwidth,_ **BW~Channel_CA,~** is defined as follows:
BW~Channel_CA~ = F~edge_high~ -- F~edge_low~ [MHz]
F~offset~ is defined in Table 5.6-1 below where BW~Channel~ is defined in
TS36.104, Table 5.6-1.
Table 5.6-1: Definition of F~offset~
* * *
Channel Bandwidth of the Lowest or Highest Carrier: BW~Channel~[MHz]
F~offset~[MHz] 5, 10, 15, 20 BW~Channel~/2 1.4, 3 FFS
* * *
The receiver and transmitter RF requirements shall apply from the frequency
reference point with offset F~offset~ from the carrier centre frequency of the
lowest/highest carriers received/transmitted. The frequency reference points
are defined as F~C_low~ -- F~offset~ and F~C_high~ + F~offset~, respectively,
with F~offset~ defined in Table 5.6-1. For contiguous carrier aggregation,
these frequency reference points coincide with lower/higher edge of the
aggregated channel bandwidth, which are F~edge_low~ or F~edge_high~
respectively.
## 5.7 Channel arrangement
### 5.7.1 Channel spacing
The nominal channel spacing between centre frequencies of contiguously
aggregated component carriers shall be a multiple of 300 kHz (in order to be
compatible with the 100 kHz frequency raster of LTE Rel-9 and at the same time
preserve orthogonality of the subcarriers with 15 kHz spacing). This
constraint would need to be added to Clause 5.7.1 Channel spacing.
The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated E-UTRA carriers is
defined as follows:
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA component carriers according to Table 5.6-1 in [2] with
values in MHz. The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous carrier
aggregation can be adjusted to any multiple of 300 kHz less than the nominal
channel spacing to optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.
The nominal channel spacing values for two adjacent aggregated E-UTRA carriers
are listed in table 5.7.1-1.

component carriers

# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
A BS supporting contiguous CA in a specified band transmits multiple component
carriers aggregated contiguously. A BS supporting non-contiguous CA transmits
multiple component carriers in the specified bands.
The BS RF performance requirements in the 25 series, 36 series and in 37
series have been characterized in the way that the requirements are applied at
each antenna connector. The same principle shall be adopted to define the
requirements for BS transmitter supporting multiple-carrier transmission
including carrier aggregation.
Therefore some clarifications regarding the transmit antenna connector
configurations for the applicable CA scenarios are needed. It is proposed to
cover not only multi-carrier transmission with CA, but to formulate it
generally for any multi-carrier transmission using multiple antenna
connectors, as this aspect is not adequately covered in the present TS36.104.
The proposal is to align with the statement already adopted for MSR in
TS37.104, i.e. that
> In case of _multi-carrier transmission with multiple transmitter antenna
> connectors_ , transmit diversity or MIMO transmission, the requirements
> apply for each transmitter antenna connector;
with the understanding that _multi-carrier transmission with multiple
transmitter antenna connectors_ includes the cases of
use of one or multiple PA's for intra-band multi-carrier transmission.
Use of one or multiple PA's for inter-band multi-carrier transmission.
For example, if three E-UTRA carriers are transmitted from two antenna
connectors with the first two carriers in one antenna and the third carrier
transmitter from another antenna, the requirements shall apply to each of
antenna connectors.
## Base station output power
For the definition of minimum requirements and test procedure for Base station
output power related to CA, it is proposed to align TS 36.104/141 with the
methodology used for MSR within TS 37.104/141 as much as possible. It's also
desirable to minimize the changes to TS 36.104/141 whenever possible. This
approach would allow carrier aggregation to be smoothly introduced into the
MSR specifications, while at the same time reflect requirements specific to
the support of CA in the core specifications TS36.104.
The Rel-9 definitions regarding "Base station output power" in TS 36.104 are
as follows:
> _Output power, Pout, of the base station is the mean power of one carrier
> delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of
> the transmitter._
>
> _Maximum output power, Pmax, of the base station is the mean power level per
> carrier measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period
> in a specified reference condition._
>
> _Rated output power, PRAT, of the base station is the mean power level per
> carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be available at the antenna
> connector during the transmitter ON period._
The corresponding definitions from MSR TS 37.104 regarding "Base station
output power" are as follows:
> _Output power of the base station is the mean power delivered to a load with
> resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the transmitter._
>
> _The configured carrier power is the target maximum power for a specific
> carrier for the operating mode set in the BS within the limits given by the
> manufacturer's declaration._
>
> _The maximum total output power, P~max~, of the base station is the mean
> power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON
> period in a specified reference condition._
>
> _The maximum RAT output power, P~max,RAT~, of the base station is the mean
> power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON
> period for a specific RAT in a specified reference condition._
>
> _The maximum carrier output power, P~max,c~ of the base station is the mean
> power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON
> period for a specific carrier in a specified reference condition._
Comparing the MSR 37 series with single-RAT E-UTRA in 36 series
specifications, they are largely consistent and the following commonalities
can be identified:
● Minimum requirements are specified for "maximum carrier output power" in TS
37.104 or "maximum output power per carrier" in TS 36.104, which are denoted
as P~max,c~ in TS 37.104 and P~max~ in TS 36.104, respectively.
● Tolerance is +/- 2dB in normal condition and +/-2.5 dB in extreme condition
for each "maximum carrier output power" in TS 37.104 or "maximum output power
per carrier" in TS 36.104.
Continuing the comparison between TS 37.104 and TS 36.104, some differences
can be identified regarding the "declared power":
● In MSR TS 37.104, the "configured carrier power" is obtained for each
"operating mode" according to the manufacturer's declaration.
● In TS 36.104, "rated output power per carrier" is given by manufacturer's
declaration. It's not clearly specified in TS 36.104 that the "rated output
power per carrier" is "operating mode" dependent in which the "operating mode"
can be the transmission of E-UTRA single carrier, multiple carriers, or
aggregated carriers.
However, it is specified in TS 36.141 subclause 4.6.3 that the BS rated output
power shall be declared for each supported transmit channel bandwidth by the
manufacturer. In order to fully capture the core requirements for BS output
power concerning multiple carriers and carrier aggregation, it shall be
clarified that the "rated output power per carrier" depends on the
transmission mode set.
The text proposal captured in R4-104924 is for TS 36.104. It's expected to
have corresponding changes in subclause 4.6.3 of TS 36.141.
## 6.3 Output power dynamics
### 6.3.1 RE Power control dynamic range
In TS36.104, it is defined that,
_"RE power control dynamic range is the difference between the power of an RE
and the average RE power for a BS at maximum output power for a specified
reference condition."_
The RE dynamic range (dB) can be positive or negative, depending on RE power
up/down. The requirements for these up/down limits are based on investigations
and discussions with considerations of eNB Tx characteristics such as EVM,
unwanted emissions. To extend the existing RE Power control dynamic range
requirements for LTE-A BS supporting carrier aggregation, the "total Tx power"
and the "maximum BS output power" shall be aligned with defined terms.
### 6.3.2 Total power dynamic range
The total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum and the
minimum output power of an OFDM symbol for a specified reference condition.
For E-UTRA BS, values for Total power dynamic range are derived from TX of 1
PRB when compared with full PRB allocation for each carrier. The existing
requirement defined in TS 36.104 Rel.9 Table 6.3.2.1-1 shall be adopted for
each component carrier supported by LTE-A CA BS.
## 6.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
The requirements in subclause 6.4 are only applied for LTE/LTE-A TDD BS.
### Transmitter OFF power
Transmitter OFF power requirement is only applied for LTE/LTE-A TDD BS. In
TS36.104 V9.3.0 Clause 6.4.1, it is described that,
"_Transmitter OFF power is defined as the mean power measured over 70 us
filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the transmission bandwidth
configuration of the BS (BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency
during the transmitter OFF period._ "
For BS supporting contiguous CA, the transmitter OFF power should be measured
while all the component carriers are OFF. And the bandwidth of the square
filter should be equal to the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth BWChannel_CA. In
addition, the same minimum requirement for transmitter OFF power spectral
density specified for LTE BS Rel.8/9 should be adopted, i.e. the transmitter
OFF power spectral density shall be less than -85dBm/MHz.
### Transmitter transient period
The transmitter transient period is the time period during which the
transmitter is changing from the OFF period to the ON period or vice versa.
For BS supporting contiguous CA, the same requirement specified for LTE BS
Rel.8/9 should be adopted.
## 6.5 Transmitted signal quality
### 6.5.1 Frequency error
Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual BS
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be used
for RF frequency and data clock generation.
#### Minimum requirement
For BS supporting CA, the modulated carrier frequency of each component
carrier supported by the BS shall be accurate to within the accuracy range
given in Table 6.5.1-1 observed over a period of one subframe (1ms).
Table 6.5.1.1-1: Frequency error minimum requirement
* * *
BS class Accuracy Wide Area BS ±0.05 ppm Local Area BS ±0.1 ppm Home BS ±0.25
ppm
* * *
### 6.5.2 Error Vector Magnitude
The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the ideal
symbols and the measured symbols after the equalization.For LTE-A BS
supporting CA, the same requirement in TS 36.104 can be adopted for each
component carrier in order to maintain the present system performance.
### 6.5.3 Time alignment between transmitter branches
Minimum requirement should be specified separately for
\- MIMO or TX diversity transmissions
\- intra-band carrier aggregation with or without MIMO or TX diversity
\- inter-band carrier aggregation, with or without MIMO or TX diversity
#### 6.5.3.1 TAE for specific scenarios of CA
A too large TAE between DL component carriers could cause spread of reception
timings on a UL carrier if single Timing Advance (TA) group is configured to
number of Ues, and BS demodulation performance might be degraded as a
consequence.
The followings were taken as assumptions to discuss the above mentioned issue:
\- (Assumption 1) 2 Ues (UE1 and UE2) are in a coverage area of 2 overlapping
carriers (Cell1 and Cell2) that operate CA.
\- (Assumption 2) UE1 is configured with Cell1 as the Pcell, and Cell2 as the
Scell. UE2 is configured with Cell2 as the Pcell, and Cell1 as the Scell.
\- (Assumption 3) Both UE1 and UE2 are configured with 2UL/2DL CA.
\- (Assumption 4) Both UE1 and UE2 are configured with single TA group.
{width="3.504861111111111in" height="0.7854166666666667in"}
Figure 6.5.3.1-1 Locations of Cells and Ues
With the above assumptions, UE1 adjust UL transmission timing aiming for the
DL transmission timing at the Cell1 (Timing A in Figure 6.5.3.1-2), and UE2
adjust that for the DL transmission timing at the Cell2 (Timing B in Figure
6.5.3.1-2). Then, the following uncertainties need to be taken into account in
order to calculate possible dispersion of reception timings on a UL carrier:
\- Accuracy of TA, i.e., ±8 Ts derived from the half of TA unit resolution
16Ts (expressed as (1) in Figure 6.5.3.1-2).
\- Allowed TA adjustment accuracy of the Pcell TA value, which is ±4T~S~ from
TS 36.133 subclause 7.3 (expressed as (2) in Figure 6.5.3.1-2).
\- Uncertainty of the reception time in the UE downlink (expressed as (3) in
Figure 6.5.3.1-2), taken as ±10 Ts.
\- Channel dispersion (expressed as (4) in Figure 6.5.3.1-2).
Figure 6.5.3.1-2: 2 Ues, Single TA group, 2 DL, 2 UL, 15rioritize, different
Pcells
However, the eNB does not know which carrier comes first. TAE is a relative
requirement. This is shown in figure 1, where both of two Ues use 2 UL (cells)
and are configured to use different carriers as the Pcells. The eNB transmits
the carriers with a relative difference of TAE
In order for the timing error in the UL not to impact the BS receiver
performance, the following equation shall be satisfied::
> 2*_TAE + 2 × [(1) + (2) + (3)] + (4) \  HARQ-ACK feedback is utilised in number of Rel-8 BS demodulation performance
> tests. HARQ-ACK physical transmission scheme on PHICH will be reused in
> Rel-10 from Rel-8. Therefore, no impact on the Rel-8 demodulation
> performance tests is foreseen from the PHICH point of view. PHICH will be
> transmitted only on the DL component carrier that was used to transmit the
> UL grant.
## 8.2 Performance requirements for PUSCH
### 8.2.1 Requirements in multipath fading propagation conditions
Both frequency-contiguous and frequency non-contiguous (i.e. clustered) PUSCH
resource allocation are considered to be supported on each carrier in CA.
Single RB allocation PUSCH performance requirements shall be re-used from
Rel-8 for single carrier allocation and shall not be considered for CA
purposes.
#### Requirements for frequency contiguous allocation
PUSCH performance requirements for frequency-contiguous resource allocation
will be re-used from Rel-8 specification, on per component carrier basis.
If the CA channel bandwidths of UL CC's are different, the test will be
conducted at different SNR level for each of those CC's, as the PUSCH
performance requirements at different channel bandwidths require different SNR
level, as defined in Rel-8.
In order to reduce number of test cases for CA testing purposes, one CC
combination for testing purposes is seen sufficient for maintaining PUSCH test
coverage. Selection criterion of such CC combination is suggested to select
the CC combination with largest aggregated bandwidth and the largest number of
CC's.
A note in 36.104 specification section 8.1 (General) was added (similar to the
DC‑HSUPA case), stating that PUSCH throughput requirements for a BS supporting
aggregated carriers are defined in terms of the existing Rel‑8 single carrier
throughput requirements.
#### 8.2.1.2 Requirements for frequency non-contiguous allocation
Performance requirements for frequency non‑contiguous RA (i.e. PUSCH/PUSCH and
PUCCH/PUSCH) were deprioritized due to ITU-R submission mandatory issues to be
covered first and the performance requirements for these transmit schemes will
not be defined for Rel-10 timeline. Rel-11 performance requirements for
frequency non‑contiguous RA are [FFS].
Frequency hopping is not supported simultaneously with non-contiguous PUSCH
resource allocation.
Maximum number of PUSCH clusters for clustered PUSCH resource allocation is 2
with the restriction of clustered allocation to be allowed only on one UL CC
(per UE).
Possible future BS performance requirements for clustered PUSCH will not cover
dynamic switching between single cluster Rel-8 scheme and clustered Rel-10
scheme.
### Requirements for UL timing adjustment
For Rel-10 timeframe, intra-band CA was prioritized, leading to only single TA
value in UL for carrier aggregation purposes. Therefore no changes are
foreseen for UL timing adjustment performance requirement.
In case of multiple TA values being allowed e.g. for inter band case, UL TA
requirement will require certain clarification.
The Rel-8/9 requirement is reused for the UL TA requirement tests, which are
conducted only for the lowest and the highest channel bandwidths supported by
the BS.
### Requirements for high speed train
No changes are foreseen for this clause.
The Rel-8/9 requirement is reused for the high speed train requirement tests,
which are conducted only for the lowest and the highest channel bandwidths
supported by the BS.
### Requirements for HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH
Irrespective of the conclusion on the possible simultaneous transmission of
PUCCH and PUSCH, Rel-8 mechanism of multiplexing UCI onto PUSCH is always
supported as the fallback mechanism when simultaneous PUSCH and PUCCH is
considered as not feasible. No changes are foreseen for this requirement due
to this agreement.
The Rel-8/9 requirement is reused for the HARQ-ACK multiplexed on PUSCH
requirement tests, which are conducted only for the lowest and the highest
channel bandwidths supported by the BS.
## Performance requirements for PUCCH
PUCCH transmission of A/N and periodic CSI reporting supporting up to 5 DL CCs
will be possible only within single, UE-specific UL component carrier.
Two PUCCH transmit schemes were introduced for CA purposes:
1\. PUCCH format 1b with channel selection: supporting up to 4 A/N bits
Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1b with channel selection will be
defined for Rel-10. The following performance measures will be evaluated for
PUCCH format 1b with channel selection:
\- DTX ACK: (1%);
\- ACK missed detection (ACK  NAK, DTX): 1%, after first transmission;
Performance requirements for this PUCCH mode will be defined with 4AN bits of
UL feedback, where both above listed measures shall be fulfilled at the same
time. One common requirement will be defined for FDD and TDD modes, based on
the alignment results analysis.
2\. PUCCH format 3 (DFT-S-OFDM): supporting full range of A/N bits
Performance requirements for PUCCH format 3 will be defined for Rel-10. The
following performance measures will be evaluated for PUCCH format 3:
\- ACK false alarm (DTX ACK): 1%;
\- ACK missed detection (ACK  NAK, DTX): 1%, after first transmission;
\- NAK ACK: 0,1%.
In case of ACK misdetection and NAKACK performance measures consideration,
the following structure of the requirement to be introduced:
\- ACK missed detection + ACK false alarm, as one requirement;
\- NAK  ACK + ACK false alarm, as second requirement.
For PUCCH format 3, generic requirements for the number of A/N bits less than
11 can be applied for both FDD and TDD. Requirements for the number of A/N
bits more than 11 apply only for TDD.
Performance requirements for this PUCCH mode will be defined for the following
UL feedback cases:
\- 4bits;
\- 16bits (TDD only).
Simultaneous PUCCH and PUSCH transmission from single UE was introduced by CA.
Performance requirements for simultaneous PUCCH and PUSCH will not be covered
within Rel-10 and are [FFS] for Rel-11 timeframe.
Simulation assumptions for Rel-10 PUCCH performance requirements were captured
in Annex B.
### DTX to ACK performance
The definition of DTX to ACK probability for multiple A/N bits for CA purposes
is as follows:
{width="4.651388888888889in" height="0.40069444444444446in"}
Where:
\- Each falsely received ACK bit is accounted as one error;
\- #(ACK/NAK bits) denote the number of encoded bits per subframe;
\- #(PUCCH DTX) denotes the number of DTX occasions.
For BS not supporting CA, current DTX  ACK definition is to be reused.
### 8.3.2 ACK missed detection requirements for single user PUCCH format 1a
No changes are foreseen for this clause.
### 8.3.3 CQI missed detection requirements for PUCCH format 2
No changes are foreseen for this clause.
### 8.3.4 ACK missed detection requirements for multi user PUCCH format 1a
No changes are foreseen for this clause.
## 8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
PRACH test can be reused from Rel-8 specification. The justification is that
despite of the fact that UE may be scheduled over multiple component carriers
in UL, only one random access procedure shall be ongoing at any time.
Therefore, no new test is foreseen to be needed due to introduction of CA.
Therefore, no changes are foreseen for this clause.
# 9 Propagation conditions
## 9.1 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
For carrier aggregation requirements it shall be clarified in the annex, that
the fading of the signals for each carrier shall be independent irrespective
of the resource allocation scenario.
###### ### Annex A: CA deployment scenarios
# A.1 General
RAN4 will adopt the following working assumptions in RP-100390 to complete the
CA WI for Rel-10:
\- The signaling and protocol specifications to support carrier aggregation
shall be designed in a generic way, and able to support carrier aggregation
scenarios that are introduced in later RAN4 Releases;
\- Specification of carrier aggregation shall be done in Release independent
manner;
\- Scenarios which are not treated in Release 10 timeframe should be captured
in appropriate TR for future reference;
\- New work items should be created when new carrier aggregation scenarios are
introduced in Rel-10 and future 3GPP specifications -- Noting that CA
operating bands are release independent.
The following way forward in RP-100380 is followed:
Rel-10 signalling (e.g., RRC, MAC, HARQ, CQI, SRS, ...) should support
aggregation of up to 5 DL CCs and 5 UL CCs, irrespective of intra- or inter-
band CA.
With regards to FDD DL:
\- Rel-10 should support both intra- and inter-band aggregation;
\- Rel-10 should support inter-band aggregation under deployments with RRH and
repeaters, i.e., with different signal reception timings across CCs of
different bands.
With regards to FDD UL:
\- Work on intra-band aggregation should be 23rioritized in RAN4 till March
2011;
\- Deployment scenarios with RRH and repeaters (and hence multiple TA
maintenance) should be supported when inter-band aggregation is supported,
e.g., in Rel-11.
With regards to TDD:
\- Work on intra-band aggregation should be 23rioritized in RAN4 till March
2011, for both DL and UL;
\- Deployment scenarios with RRH and repeaters (and hence multiple TA
maintenance) should be supported when inter-band aggregation is supported,
e.g., in Rel-11.
