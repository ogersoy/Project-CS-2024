# 4 Functional Overview
## 4.1 General
This document defines the EPC LCS Protocol (ELP) used on the SLg interface
between the GMLC and the MME in the Evolved Packet Core (EPC).
The location of the SLg interface within the LCS logical architecture is shown
in Figure 4.1-1.
Figure 4.1-1 SLg interface in the LCS Architecture
The high level functions of the ELP protocol are described in 3GPP TS 23.271
[2].
The main functions of the protocol are:
\- To allow the GMLC to request position estimates for a particular target UE
from the MME in order to support the EPC-MT-LR positioning procedures. This is
achieved using the Provide Subscriber Location message;
\- To allow the MME to return a position estimate or an error report to the
GMLC in response to a Provide Subscriber Location request as part of an EPC-
MT-LR positioning procedure;
\- To allow the MME to forward an unsolicited position estimate to the GMLC as
part of the EPC-MO-LR or EPC-NI-LR procedures;
\- To allow the GMLC to acknowledge receipt of an unsolicited position
estimate as part of the EPC-MO-LR or EPC-NI-LR procedures;
\- To support the procedures for handover of an IMS emergency call with
EPS/GPRS access.
# 5 ELP Message Transport
## 5.1 General
The ELP protocol is defined as a Vendor Specific diameter application (SLg
application). It reuses the basic mechanisms defined by the diameter base
protocol, and it defines a number of additional commands and AVPs to implement
the SLg specific procedures.
## 5.2 Use of Diameter base protocol
The Diameter Base Protocol as specified in IETF RFC 3588 [4] shall apply
except as modified by the defined support of the methods and the defined
support of the commands and AVPs, result and error codes as described in this
specification. Unless otherwise specified, the procedures (including error
handling and unrecognised information handling) shall be used unmodified.
## 5.3 Securing Diameter Messages
For secure transport of Diameter messages, see 3GPP TS 33.210 [13].
## 5.4 Accounting functionality
Accounting functionality (Accounting Session State Machine, related command
codes and AVPs) shall not be used on the SLg interface.
## 5.5 Use of sessions
Between the MME and the GMLC, Diameter sessions shall be implicitly
terminated. An implicitly terminated session is one for which the server does
not maintain state information. The client shall not send any re-authorization
or session termination requests to the server.
The Diameter base protocol includes the Auth-Session-State AVP as the
mechanism for the implementation of implicitly terminated sessions.
The client (server) shall include in its requests (responses) the Auth-
Session-State AVP set to the value NO_STATE_MAINTAINED (1), as described in
IETF RFC 3588 [4]. As a consequence, the server shall not maintain any state
information about this session and the client shall not send any session
termination request. Neither the Authorization-Lifetime AVP nor the Session-
Timeout AVP shall be present in requests or responses.
## 5.6 Transport protocol
Diameter messages over the SLg interface shall make use of SCTP (see IETF RFC
4960 [14]).
## 5.7 Routing considerations
This clause specifies the use of the Diameter routing AVPs Destination-Realm
and Destination-Host.
Destination-Realm AVP shall always be included in all diameter requests, and
therefore is declared as mandatory in the ABNF for all commands.
When a request is initiated by the GMLC, the name of the MME shall be
determined by querying the HSS over the SLh interface, and retrieve the
specific MME that is currently serving the UE. Therefore, Destination-Host AVP
shall always be included in the commands originated at the GMLC, and is
declared as mandatory in the ABNF.
When a request is initiated by the MME, the name of the GMLC may be either
locally configured in the MME (e.g., in the intra-domain scenario, when the
GMLC belongs to the same PLMN as the MME), or it is known from a previously
received location procedure initiated at the GMLC. Therefore, the Destination-
Host AVP is declared as mandatory in the ABNF of the commands originated at
the MME.
If the Vendor-Specific-Application-ID AVP is received in any of the commands,
it may be ignored by the receiving node, and it shall not be used for routing
purposes.
## 5.8 Advertising Application Support
The MME and GMLC shall advertise support of the Diameter SLg Application by
including the value of the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id
AVP within the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id grouped AVP of the Capabilities-
Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands.
The vendor identifier value of 3GPP (10415) shall be included in the
Supported-Vendor-Id AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-
Exchange-Answer commands, and in the Vendor-Id AVP within the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id grouped AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and
Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands.
The Vendor-Id AVP included in Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-
Exchange-Answer commands that is not included in the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVPs as described above shall indicate the manufacturer of the
Diameter node as per RFC 3588 [4].
# 6 ELP Procedures
## 6.1 General
The ELP procedures, between the GMLC and the MME, are used to exchange
messages related to location services over the SLg interface. The ELP can be
divided into the following sub-procedures.
\- Provide Subscriber Location
\- Subscriber Location Report
## 6.2 Provide Subscriber Location
### 6.2.1 General
The Provide Subscriber Location operation is used by a GMLC to request the
location of a target UE from the MME at any time. The response contains a
location estimate of the target UE and other additional information.
### 6.2.2 Successful Operation
> Figure 6.2.2-1: Provide Subscriber Location procedure. Successful operation.
The GMLC initiates the procedure by sending a PROVIDE SUBSCRIBER LOCATION
REQUEST message to the MME. This message carries the type of location
information requested (e.g. current location and optionally, velocity), the UE
subscriber\'s IMSI, LCS QoS information (e.g. accuracy, response time) and an
indication of whether the LCS client has the override capability.
Upon reception of PROVIDE SUBSCRIBER LOCATION REQUEST message, the MME shall
perform authentication privacy verification on the location request. After
that, the MME shall retrieve the location information of the target UE from
E-UTRAN according to the procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.271 [2].
The MME returns a PROVIDE SUBSCRIBER LOCATION RESPONSE to the GMLC. The
message shall contain the location estimate, its age and obtained accuracy. If
the MME failed to get the current location and the LCS client is requesting
the current or last known location, the MME may return the last known location
of the target UE if this is known.
This procedure is mapped to the commands Provide-Location-Request/Answer in
the Diameter application specified in sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2.

### 6.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation
On receipt of a PROVIDE SUBSCRIBER LOCATION RESPONSE with a Result-Code or
Experimental-Result AVP indicating failure the GMLC considers the positioning
request as failed.
## 6.3 Subscriber Location Report
### 6.3.1 General
The Subscriber Location Report operation is used by an MME to provide the
location of a target UE to a GMLC when a request for location has been
implicitly issued.
### 6.3.2 Successful Operation
> Figure 6.3.2-1: Subscriber Location Report procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending a SUBSCRIBER LOCATION REPORT
message to the GMLC. The message may carry the identity of the UE, the
location estimate and its age, and the event causing the location report.
Upon reception of SUBSCRIBER LOCATION REPORT message, the GMLC shall return a
SUBSCRIBER LOCATION REPORT ACK to the MME and process the location report
accordingly, e.g. transfer of the location estimate to an external LCS Client
according to procedure described in 3GPP TS 23.271 [2].
This procedure is mapped to the commands Location-Report-Request/Answer in the
Diameter application specified in sections 7.3.3 and 7.3.4.

# 7 ELP Messages and Message Formats
## 7.1 General
The Diameter Base Protocol as specified in IETF RFC 3588 [4] shall apply
except as modified by the defined support of the methods and the defined
support of the commands and AVPs, result and error codes as specified in this
specification. Unless otherwise specified, the procedures (including error
handling and unrecognised information handling) shall be used unmodified.
This clause specifies a Diameter application that allows a Diameter server and
a Diameter client:
\- to retrieve the location information of a target UE
\- to report the location information of a target UE
The SLg interface protocol is defined as an IETF vendor specific Diameter
application, where the vendor is 3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA
to 3GPP (http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
The Diameter application identifier assigned to the SLg interface application
is 16777255 (allocated by IANA).
## 7.2 Message Formats
This section defines Command-Code values for the SLg interface application.
Every command is defined by means of the ABNF syntax IETF RFC 2234 [5],
according to the rules in IETF RFC 3588 [4]. If the definition and use of an
AVP is not specified in this document, the guidelines in IETF RFC 3588 [4]
shall apply.
For these commands, the Application-ID field shall be set to16777255
(application identifier of the SLg interface application).
NOTE: For this release, the Vendor-Specific-Application-ID is included as an
optional AVP in all commands in order to ensure interoperability with diameter
agents following a strict implementation of IETF RFC 3588, by which messages
not including this AVP will be rejected. IETF RFC 3588 indicates that the AVP
shall be present in all proxiable commands, such as those specified here,
dispite that the contents of this AVP are redundant since the Application ID
is already present in the command header. This AVP may be removed in
subsequent revisions of this specification, once the diameter base protocol is
updated accordingly.
The following Command Codes are defined in this specification:
