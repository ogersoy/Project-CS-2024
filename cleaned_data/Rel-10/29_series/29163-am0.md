# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the principles of interworking between the 3GPP
IM CN subsystem and BICC/ISUP based legacy CS networks, in order to support IM
basic voice, data and multimedia calls.
The present document addresses the areas of control and user plane
interworking between the IM CN subsystem and CS networks through the network
functions, which include the MGCF and IM-MGW. For the specification of control
plane interworking, areas such as the interworking between SIP and BICC or
ISUP are detailed in terms of the processes and protocol mappings required for
the support of both IM originated and terminated voice and multimedia calls.
Other areas addressed encompass the transport protocol and signalling issues
for negotiation and mapping of bearer capabilities and QoS information.
The present document specifies the interworking between 3GPP profile of SIP
(as detailed according to TS 24.229 [9]) and BICC or ISUP, as specified in
ITU-T Recommendations Q.1902.1 to Q.1902.6 [30] and ITU-T Q761 to Q764 [4]
respectively.
The present document also specifies the interworking between circuit switched
multimedia telephony service, as described in TS 26.110 [78] TS 26.111 [79],
and ITU-T Recommendation H.324 [81] and packet switched multimedia services,
as described in TS 26.235 [80] and TS 26.236 [32], in particular and the
interworking between the 3GPP profile of SIP and the inband control protocols
for multimedia communication as specified in ITU-T Recommendations H.245 [82]
and H.324 Annex K [81].
The present document addresses two interworking scenarios with respect to the
properties of the CS network:
\- The CS network does not use any 3GPP specific additions.
\- The CS network uses 3GPP specific additions.

**BICC+STCmtp** : this terminology means that BICC signaling always need to be
used on top of STCmtp sublayer.
**diverting URI:** the URI of the node by which the existing communication was
last diverted/forwarded.
**diverted-to URI:** the URI to which the existing communication is
diverted/forwarded to.

# 4 General
## 4.1 General interworking overview
The IM CN subsystem shall interwork with BICC and ISUP based legacy CS
networks, e.g. PSTN, ISDN, CS PLMNs, in order to provide the ability to
support basic voice calls (see TS 22.228 [11]), between a UE located in the IM
CN subsystem and user equipment located in a CS network.
For the ability to support the delivery of basic voice calls between the IM CN
subsystem and CS networks, basic protocol interworking between SIP (as
specified in TS 24.229 [9]) and BICC or ISUP (as specified in ITU-T
Recommendations Q.1902.1-6 [30] and ITU-T Recommendations Q761 to Q764 [4]
respectively) has to occur at a control plane level, in order that call setup,
call maintenance and call release procedures can be supported. The MGCF shall
provide this protocol mapping functionality within the IM CN subsystem.
User plane interworking between the IM CN subsystem and CS network bearers
(e.g. 64k TDM, ATM/AAL2 circuit or IP bearer) are supported by the functions
within the IM-MGW. The IM-MGW resides in the IM CN subsystem and shall provide
the bearer channel interconnection. The MGCF shall provide the call control to
bearer setup association.
The IM CN subsystem shall interwork, at the control and user plane, with BICC
and ISUP based legacy CS networks. The support of supplementary services shall
be as defined in TS 22.228 [11]. The MGCF and IM-MGW shall support the
interworking of the IM CN subsystem to an external ISUP based CS network. They
may also support interworking to a BICC based CS network where no 3GPP
specific extension is applied. The MGCF and the IM-MGW may also support
interworking to a BICC based CS network where 3GPP specific extensions in
accordance with TS 29.205 [14] are applied.
# 5 Network characteristics
## 5.1 Key characteristics of ISUP/BICC based CS networks
This signalling interface to a PSTN is either based on BICC Capability Set 2
as specified in ITU-T Recommendations Q.1902.1 to Q.1902.6 [30], or on ISUP
(see ITU-T Recommendations Q.761 to Q.764 [4]).
The interface towards a CS-PLMN may either be one of the interfaces mentioned
in the paragraph above or a signalling interface based on BICC with 3GPP
specific extensions, as specified for the 3GPP Nc interface in TS 29.205 [14],
and the IM-MGW may support the 3GPP Nb interface, as specified in TS 29.414
[25] and TS 29.415 [26]. If the 3GPP Nc interface is applied as signalling
interface, the 3GPP Nb interface is used as user plane interface and the Nb UP
Framing protocol is applied.
## 5.2 Key characteristics of IM CN subsystem
The IM CN subsystem uses SIP to manage IP multimedia sessions in a 3GPP
environment, it also uses IPv6, as defined in RFC 2460 [39], as the transport
mechanism for both SIP session signalling and media transport. The 3GPP
profile of SIP defining the usage of SIP within the IM CN subsystem is
specified in TS 24.229 [9]. Example callflows are provided in TS 24.228 [8].
# 6 Interworking with CS networks
## 6.1 Interworking reference model
Figure 1 details the reference model required to support interworking between
the 3GPP IM CN subsystem and CS networks for IM basic voice calls.
NOTE 1: The logical split of the signalling and bearer path between the CS
network and the IM CN subsystem is as shown, however the signalling and bearer
may be logically directly connected to the IM-MGW.
NOTE 2: The SGW may be implemented as a stand-alone entity or it may be
located in another entity either in the CS network or the IM-MGW. The
implementation options are not discussed in the present document.
NOTE 3: The IM-MGW may be connected via the Mb to various network entities,
such as a UE (via a GTP Tunnel to a GGSN), an MRFP, or an application server.
NOTE 4: A SGW function is not required for certain signalling transports,
where M3UA+SCTP+IP is used in CS network and IM-MGCF.
Figure 1: IM CN subsystem to CS network logical interworking reference model
### 6.1.1 Interworking reference points and interfaces
The reference points and network interfaces shown in figure 1 are as
described:
Protocol for Mg reference point: The single call control protocol applied
across the Mg reference point (i.e. between CSCF and MGCF) will be based on
the 3GPP profile of SIP as defined in accordance with TS 24.229 [9].
Protocol for Mn reference point: The Mn reference point describes the
interfaces between the MGCF and IM-MGW, and has the properties as detailed in
TS 29.332 [15].
Protocol for Mj reference point: The single call control protocol applied
across the Mj reference point (i.e. between BGCF and MGCF) will be based on
the 3GPP profile of SIP as defined in accordance with TS 24.229 [9].
Protocol for Mb reference point: The Mb reference point is defined in
accordance with TS 23.002 [10] and is IPv6 based.
### 6.1.2 Interworking functional entities
#### 6.1.2.1 Signalling Gateway Function (SGW)
This component performs the call related signalling conversion to or from
BICC/ISUP based MTP transport networks to BICC/ISUP based SCTP/IP transport
networks, and forwards the converted signalling to or from the MGCF. The
functionality within SGW shall be in accordance with TS 23.002 [10].
#### 6.1.2.2 Media Gateway Control Function (MGCF)
This is the component within the IM CN subsystem, which controls the IM-MGW,
and also performs SIP to BICC or SIP to ISUP call related signalling
interworking.
The functionality defined within MGCF shall be defined in accordance with TS
23.002 [10].
#### 6.1.2.3 IP Multimedia - Media Gateway Function (IM-MGW)
This is the component within the IM CN subsystem, which provides the interface
between the PS domain and the CS domain, and it shall support the functions as
defined in accordance with TS 23.002 [10].
## 6.2 Control plane interworking model
Within the IM CN subsystem, the 3GPP profile of SIP is used to originate and
terminate IM sessions to and from the UE.
External CS networks use BICC or ISUP to originate and terminate voice calls
to and from the IM CN subsystem.
Therefore, in order to provide the required interworking to enable inter
network session control, the control plane protocols shall be interworked
within the IM CN subsystem. This function is performed within the MGCF (see
clause 6.1.2).
## 6.3 User plane interworking model
Within the IM CN subsystem, IPv6, and framing protocols such as RTP, are used
to transport media packets to and from the IM CN subsystem entity like UE or
MRFP.
External legacy CS networks use circuit switched bearer channels like TDM
circuits (e.g. 64 kbits PCM), ATM/AAL2 circuit or IP bearers to carry encoded
voice frames, to and from the IM CN subsystem.
Other CN networks use ATM/AAL 1 or AAL 2 or IP as a backbone, with different
framing protocols.
Therefore, in order to provide the required interworking to enable media data
exchange, the user plane protocols shall be translated within the IM CN
subsystem. This function is performed within the IM-MGW (see clause 6.1.2).
# 7 Control plane interworking
Signalling from CS networks to or from IM CN subsystem, where the associated
supported signalling protocols are SS7/M3UA+ SCTP+IP and M3UA+SCTP+IP
respectively, requires a level of interworking between the nodes across the
Control Plane, i.e. the SS7 signalling function, SGW (if applicable), MGCF and
SIP signalling function. This interworking is required in order to provide a
seamless support of a user part, i.e. SIP and BICC+STC~mtp~ or SIP and ISUP.
The transport of SS7 signalling protocol messages of any protocol layer that
is identified by MTP level 3, in SS7 terms, as a user part (MTP3-user) shall
be accomplished in accordance with the protocol architecture defined in the
following clauses. For the present document these protocol layers include, but
are not limited to, Bearer Independent Call Control (BICC)+STC~mtp~ and ISDN
User Part (ISUP).
## 7.1 General
The following clauses define the signalling interworking between the Bearer
Independent Call Control (BICC) or ISDN User Part (ISUP) protocols and Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) with its associated Session Description Protocol
(SDP) at a MGCF. The MGCF shall act as a Type A exchange (ITU-T Recommendation
Q.764 [4]) for the purposes of ISUP and BICC Compatibility procedures. The
services that can be supported through the use of the signalling interworking
are limited to the services that are supported by BICC or ISUP and SIP based
network domains.
BICC is the call control protocol used between Nodes in a network that
incorporates separate call and bearer control. The BICC/ISUP capabilities or
signalling information defined for national use is outside the scope of the
present document. It does not imply interworking for national-specific
capabilities is not feasible.
The capabilities of SIP and SDP that are interworked with BICC or ISUP are
defined in TS 24.229 [9].
Services that are common in SIP and BICC or ISUP network domains will
seamlessly interwork by using the function of the MGCF. The MGCF will
originate and/or terminate services or capabilities that do not interwork
seamlessly across domains according to the relevant protocol recommendation or
specification.
Table 1 lists the services seamlessly interworked and therefore within the
scope of the present document.

## 7.2 Interworking between CS networks supporting ISUP and the IM CN
subsystem
The control plane between CS networks supporting ISUP and the IM CN subsystem
supporting SIP, where the underlying network is SS7 and IP respectively is as
shown in figure 2.
Figure 2: Control plane interworking between CS networks supporting ISUP\ and
the IM CN subsystem
### 7.2.1 Services performed by network entities in the control plane
#### 7.2.1.1 Services performed by the SS7 signalling function
The SS7 signalling function provides the capabilities to deliver or receive
SS7 MTP3-User information (e.g. ISUP or BICC+STC~mtp~) across the SS7
signalling network. The functional interface of the MTP, the MTP User parts
and the signalling network are as detailed in ITU-T Recommendations Q.701 to
Q.709 [3].
#### 7.2.1.2 Services of the SGW
The SGW shall perform the functions as described in TS 23.002 [10].
In order to support the seamless operation of the MTP3-User part information
between networks incorporating SS7 and IP (either IPv4, see RFC 791 [16], or
IPv6, see RFC 2460 [39]), the SGW shall support the services of MTP as well as
the services of the M3UA (see TS 29.202 [20]) and SCTP (see RFC 2960 [18]).
#### 7.2.1.3 Services of the MGCF
The session handling and session control of the MGCF shall be as detailed in
TS 24.229 [9].
The MGCF shall provide the interaction, through the use of its interworking
function, between the SS7 MTP3-User part information, e.g. ISUP, and SIP. The
MGCF interworking function shall also provide the translation between the SS7
MTP3-User part information and SIP, where the interworking of SIP to ISUP and
BICC+STC~mtp~ are detailed below.
#### 7.2.1.4 Services of the SIP signalling function
The SIP signalling function is a logical entity that provides the capabilities
to deliver or receive multimedia session information across the IM CN
subsystem signalling system.
### 7.2.2 Signalling interactions between network entities in the control
plane
#### 7.2.2.1 Signalling between the SS7 signalling function and MGCF
The SGW shall enable the signalling interaction between the SS7 signalling
function and the MGCF.
##### 7.2.2.1.1 Signalling from MGCF to SS7 signalling function
For signalling from the MGCF to the SS7 signalling function, the SGW shall
terminate the SCTP and M3UA protocol layers and deliver the MTP3-User protocol
messages, e.g. ISUP messages, towards the SS7 signalling function. The SGW
transmits and receives SS7 Message Signalling Units (MSUs) to and from the SS7
signalling function over standard SS7 network interfaces, using MTP to provide
reliable transport of the messages.
##### 7.2.2.1.2 Signalling from SS7 signalling function to MGCF
For signalling from the SS7 signalling function to the MGCF, the SGW shall
terminate SS7 MTP2 and MTP3 protocol layers and deliver MTP3-User part
information messages, e.g. ISUP, towards the MGCF. In order to direct messages
received from the SS7 MTP3 network to the appropriate IP destination, e.g.
MGCF, the SGW shall perform a message distribution function using the
information received from the MTP3-User message. Message distribution at the
SGW shall be performed in accordance with TS 29.202 [20].
##### 7.2.2.1.3 Services offered by SCTP and M3UA
The SGW internal protocol mapping and transportation between BICC or ISUP
messages and IP encapsulated BICC or ISUP messages respectively is supported
by the services of the M3UA adaptation layer and the underlying SCTP layer.
The SGW shall allow for the transfer of MTP3-User signalling messages, e.g.
BICC or ISUP, to and from an MGCF, where the peer MTP3-User protocol exists.
##### 7.2.2.1.3.1 Services offered by SCTP {#services-offered-by-sctp .H6}
SCTP offers the ability to reliably transfer the SCTP User applications, e.g.
M3UA, between the SCTP User application peers. The initialization procedure
used for an association between two SCTP end-to-end peers, and the
initialization to the SCTP User applications shall be performed as detailed in
RCF 2960 [18].
##### 7.2.2.1.3.2 Services offered by M3UA {#services-offered-by-m3ua .H6}
When an association between two SCTP peers has been established, the use of
M3UA shall provide the transport service in accordance with MTP (see ITU-T
Recommendations Q.701 to Q.709 [3]) to the MTP3-User, e.g. ISUP.
#### 7.2.2.2 Signalling between the MGCF and SIP signalling function
Signalling between the SIP signalling function and the MGCF uses the services
of IP (RFC 2460 [39]), and transport protocol such as TCP (RFC 793 [24]) or
UDP (RFC 768 [17]) or SCTP (RFC 2960 [18]) (see TS 24.229 [9]), and SIP.
The naming and addressing concepts between the MGCF and SIP signalling
function shall be detailed in accordance with TS 23.228 [12]. The issues of
general IP address management are discussed in TS 23.221 [47].
### 7.2.3 SIP-ISUP protocol interworking
When a coding of a parameter value is omitted it implies that it is not
affected by the interworking and the values are assigned by normal protocol
procedures.
#### 7.2.3.1 Incoming call interworking from SIP to ISUP at I-MGCF
##### 7.2.3.1.1 Sending of IAM
On reception of a SIP INVITE requesting a session, the I‑MGCF shall send an
IAM message. The allowed sessions are given in clause 7.2.3.1.2.5.
An I-MGCF shall support both incoming INVITE requests containing SIP
preconditions and 100rel extensions in the SIP Supported or Require header
fields, and INVITE requests not containing these extensions, unless the Note
below applies.
NOTE: If the I-MGCF is deployed in an IMS network that by local configuration
serves no user requiring preconditions, the MGCF may not support incoming
requests requiring preconditions.
The I-MGCF shall interwork forked INVITE requests with different request URIs.
If the SIP precondition extension is not included in the Supported or Require
header field, the I-MGCF shall send an IAM immediately after the reception of
the INVITE, as shown in figure 3. The I-MGCF shall set the continuity
indicators to \"Continuity check not required\".
If a Continuity Check procedure is supported in the ISUP network and SIP
precondition extension are included in the SIP Supported or Require header
field, the I-MGCF shall send the IAM immediately after the reception of the
INVITE, as shown in figure 3. If the received SDP indicates that precondition
is fulfilled the I-MGCF shall set the continuity indicators to \"continuity
check is not required\". If the received SDP indicates that precondition is
not fulfilled the I-MGCF shall set the continuity indicators to \"continuity
check performed on a previous circuit\". The procedure in figure 3 applies
when the value of the continuity indicator is either set to \"continuity check
required\", \"continuity check performed on a previous circuit\" or
\"continuity check not required\". If the continuity indicator is set to
\"continuity check required\" the corresponding procedures at the Mn interface
described in clause 9.2.2.3 also apply.
Figure 3: Receipt of an INVITE request (continuity procedure supported in the
ISUP network)
If Continuity Check procedure is not supported in the ISUP network, and the
SDP in the received INVITE request contains preconditions not met, the I-MGCF
shall delay sending the IAM until the SIP preconditions are met and set the
continuity indicators in the resulting IAM to \"Continuity check not
required\".
Figure 4: Receipt of an INVITE request (continuity procedure not supported in
the ISUP network)
The I-MGCF shall reject an INVITE request for a session only containing
unsupported media types by sending a status code 488 \"Not Acceptable Here\".
If several media streams are contained in a single INVITE request, and if the
I-MGCF does not support multimedia interworking according to Annex E, then the
I-MGCF shall select one of the supported media streams, reserve the codec(s)
for that media stream, and reject the other media streams and unselected
codecs in the SDP answer, as detailed in IETF RFC 3264 [36]. If supported
audio media stream(s) and supported non-audio media stream(s) are contained in
a single INVITE request, an audio stream should be selected.
The I-MGCF shall include a To tag in the first backward non-100 provisional
response, in order to establish an early dialog as described in IETF RFC 3261
[19].
If an MGCF discovers an emergency call it shall, depending on national
requirements, map that to appropriate indication in ISUP.
According to IETF RFC 3261 [19] and IETF RFC 3264 [36], if an INVITE message
is received without an SDP offer, then the I-MGCF sends an SDP offer in the
first reliable non-failure message.
##### 7.2.3.1.2 Coding of the IAM
##### 7.2.3.1.2.0 General {#general-2 .H6}
The following ISDN user part parameters description can be found in ITU-T
Recommendation Q.763 [4].
##### 7.2.3.1.2.1 Called party number {#called-party-number .H6}

##### 7.2.3.1.2.5 Transmission medium requirement {#transmission-medium-
requirement .H6}
The I-MGCF may either transcode the selected codec(s) to the codec on the PSTN
side or it may attempt to interwork the media without transcoding. If the
I-MGCF transcodes, it shall select the TMR parameter to \"3.1 kHz audio\". If
the I-MGCF does not transcode, it should map the TMR, USI and Access Transport
parameters from the selected codec according to table 2a. However, if the
I-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option, and if a PSTN XML body
is received in the INVITE request and the I-MGCF selects media encoded in any
of the formats in table 2a (G.711, Clearmode or t38) among the offered media,
the I-MGCF shall derive these parameters from the XML body instead, as
detailed in table 2b. The I-MGCF should only apply the mapping in table 2b if
the TMR and USI values derived from the selected codec according to table 2a
are equivalent with the values within the first Bearer Capability element in
the PSTN XML, and otherwise the I-MGCF should apply the mapping according to
table 2a.
The support of any of the media listed in table 2a is optional.
If no SDP is received from the remote peer (as described in clause 7.2.3.1.1),
then the TMR parameter should be set to \"3.1 kHz audio\". Transcoding shall
be applied as required.

##### 7.2.3.1.2.5a Transmission medium requirement prime and USI prime
(optional) {#a-transmission-medium-requirement-prime-and-usi-prime-optional
.H6}
The procedures to support UDI-TA Fallback mechanism described in the present
clause shall only apply if two PSTN XML Bearer Capability elements appear
within the INVITE Request and the MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network
option.
When all the following conditions apply:
\- The INVITE request includes SDP with one m-line with at least two formats,
and with the coding of the first two formats appearing in table 2a;
\- the TMR and USI prime values derived from the first format in the m-line
according to table 2a are equivalent with the values within the second Bearer
Capability element in the PSTN XML;
\- the TMR prime and USI values derived from the second format in the m-line
according to table 2a are equivalent with the values within the first Bearer
Capability element in the PSTN XML; and.
\- the I-MGCF supports forwarding fallback signalling.
then the I-MGCF shall
\- if TMR \"64 kBit/s preferred\" is supported at the succeeding trunk:
\- map the first XML Bearer Capability element into the \"USI\" within the
IAM;
\- map the the first PSTN XML BearerCapability (InformationTransferCapability)
into the \"TMR prime\" within the IAM, applying the same mapping rules as
specified for the mapping into the \"TMR\" in table 2b;
\- map the second XML Bearer Capability element
(InformationTransferCapability) into the USI prime within the IAM;
\- set the TMR within the IAM to \"64 kBit/s preferred\";
\- configure the IM-MGW; and
\- store those values;
\- if TMR \"64 kBit/s preferred\" is not supported at the succeeding trunk:
\- apply the procedures as described within clause 7.2.3.1.2.5, using the
first Bearer Capability element in the PSTN XMLand the second format in the
m-line;
discard the second Bearer Capability element in the PSTN XML;
\- select the second format in the m-line within the SDP answer; and
\- configure the IM-MGW.
Otherwise (i.e. if some Bearer Capability element in the PSTN XML did not
match the SDP), the I-MGCF shall:
\- discard the XML Bearer Capability elements;
\- if the I-MGCF received at least two formats within the m-line, select one
of those formats, exept for the CLEARMODE codec, within the SDP answer;
\- apply the mapping for the selected format according to table 2a; and
\- configure the IM-MGW accordingly
##### 7.2.3.1.2.6 Calling party number {#calling-party-number .H6}
The SIP \"Privacy\" header is defined within IETF RFC 3323 [40]. The SIP
\"P-Asserted-Identity\" header is defined in IETF RFC 3325 [41].

##### 7.2.3.1.2.8 User service information {#user-service-information .H6}
For coding of the USI see 7.2.3.1.2.5.
##### 7.2.3.1.2.9 Hop Counter (National option) {#hop-counter-national-option
.H6}
The I-MGCF shall perform the following interworking procedure if the Hop
Counter procedure is supported in the CS network.
At the I‑MGCF the Max-Forwards SIP header shall be used to derive the Hop
Counter parameter if applicable. Due to the different default values (that are
based on network demands/provisions) of the SIP Max-Forwards header and the
Hop Counter, a factor shall be used to adapt the Max Forwards to the Hop
Counter at the I‑MGCF. For example, the following guidelines could be applied:
1) Max-Forwards for a given message should be monotone decreasing with each
successive visit to a SIP entity, regardless of intervening interworking, and
similarly for Hop Counter.
2) The initial and successively mapped values of Max-Forwards should be large
enough to accommodate the maximum number of hops that may be expected of a
validly routed call.
Table 7 shows the principle of the mapping:
Table 7: Max forwards -- hop counter
* * *
Max-Forwards = X Hop Counter = INTEGER part of (X /Factor) =Y NOTE: The
Mapping of value X to Y should be done with the used (implemented) adaptation
mechanism.
* * *
The Principle of adoption could be implemented on a basis of the network
provision, trust domain rules and bilateral agreement.
##### 7.2.3.1.2.10 Progress Indicator {#progress-indicator .H6}
If the I-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option and an INVITE
containing a PSTN XML body is received, an available \"ProgressIndicator\"
element in the PSTN XML body shall be mapped into a Progress Indicator in the
Access Transport Parameter of the sent IAM as shown in table 7.2.3.1.2.10.1.

* * *

indicator (NOTE) NOTE: A ProgressIndicator with Progress Description value 6
shall not be included into the ISUP ATP, and is mapped instead to Forward call

##### 7.2.3.1.2.11 Location Number {#location-number .H6}
Location Number is defined in section 3.30 of ITU-T Q.763 [4].
If the received INVITE message contains a P-Access-Network-Info header and the
P-Access-Network-Info header contains an access-type with the value \"GSTN\"
and a gstn-location parameter, the I-MGCF shall include an ISUP Location
Number parameter in the outgoing IAM.

character strings into an octet that has the equivalent hexadecimal
representation

##### 7.2.3.1.2A Coding of the IAM when Number Portability is supported
This clause describes optional coding procedures when Number Portability is
supported.
##### 7.2.3.1.2A.1 Coding of the IAM when a Number Portability Routing Number
is available {#a.1-coding-of-the-iam-when-a-number-portability-routing-number-
is-available .H6}
ITU-T Q.769.1 [92] describes three possible addressing methods for signalling
of the Called Party E.164 address and Number Portability Routing Number (ITU-T
Q.769.1 [92] uses the terms directory number and network routing number
respectively). The choice of these methods is based on network operator and
national requirements.
The following clauses describe how the IAM is populated, based on these
methods, when a Number Portability Routing Number is available in the Request
URI in the form of a Tel URI \"rn=\" parameter.
When the optional Number Portability Routing Number is available and
supported, these procedures take precedence over procedures for coding of the
Called Party Number described in clause 7.2.3.1.2.1.
If the Number Portability Database Dip Indicator is present within the
Request-URI the procedures described in clause 7.2.3.1.2A.2 apply. When a
Number Portability Routing Number is not available, the Called Party Number
parameter is populated as described in clause 7.2.3.1.2.1.

##### 7.2.3.1.2A.2 Number Portability Forward Information {#a.2-number-
portability-forward-information .H6}
Network Operator or National policy may allow forward transfer of number
portability status information, as described in ITU-T Q.769.1 [92]. In this
case, the following coding applies.

##### 7.2.3.1.2B Coding of the IAM for Carrier Routeing
This clause describes optional coding procedures for carrier-based routeing.
The interworking of the CIC parameter is defined.
##### 7.2.3.1.2B.1 Coding of the IAM when a Carrier Identification Code (CIC)
is present {#b.1-coding-of-the-iam-when-a-carrier-identification-code-cic-is-
present .H6}
The procedures followed in clause 7.2.3.1.2.1 apply with the following
addition.
Based on network configuration, if the tel-URI parameter in a tel-URI or the
userinfo part of a SIP URI with user=phone in the Request-URI of an initial
INVITE request, contains a \"cic=\" parameter, as defined in IETF RFC 4694
[93], the I-MGCF may extract the carrier identification code from the \"cic=\"
field for routeing the call. If the outgoing IAM message contains the Transit
Network Selection (TNS) parameter, as defined in ITU-T Q.763 [4], based on
network configuration the TNS may be populated using the carrier
identification code from the \"cic=\" field. The format of the \"cic\"
parameter (e.g. global-cic and local-cic) shall be compliant to IETF RFC 4694
[93].
##### 7.2.3.1.2B.2 Void {#b.2-void .H6}
##### 7.2.3.1.3 Sending of COT
Figure 5: Sending of COT
If the IAM has already been sent, the Continuity message shall be sent
indicating \"continuity check successful\", when all of the following
conditions have been met:
\- The requested remote preconditions (if any) in the IMS network have been
met.
\- The media stream previously set to inactive mode is set to active (as
specified in IETF RFC 4566 [56]).
\- Local preconditions have been fulfilled.
\- A possible outstanding continuity check procedure is successfully performed
on the outgoing circuit.
##### 7.2.3.1.3A Sending of SAM
##### 7.2.3.1.3A.1 General {#a.1-general .H6}
The procedures in the present clause are only applicable if the I-MGCF
supports the network option of overlap signalling, using either the in-dialog
method or the multiple INVITEs method. Within one IMS only a single of those
methods shall be used.
After the ISUP IAM message has been sent the I-MGCF can receive additional
digits. The additional digits may either, as a network option, be received in:
\- in-dialog SIP INFO requests (\"legacy\" mode of usage of the INFO method as
defined in IETF RFC 6086 [133]), in-dialog method as specified in clause
7.2.3.1.3A.2 or
\- in additional SIP INVITE requests, multiple INVITEs method as specified in
7.2.3.1.3A.3.
Figure 5a: Sending of SAM
##### 7.2.3.1.3A.2 Additional digits received in in-dialog SIP INFO requests
{#a.2-additional-digits-received-in-in-dialog-sip-info-requests .H6}
If interworking of overlap signalling using the in-dialog method is supported
by the I-MGCF, the ISUP IAM message has already been sent, but no ISUP ACM or
REL message has been received, and a SIP INFO request carrying additional
digits is received, then the I-MGCF shall generate a SAM and pass it to
outgoing BICC/ISUP procedures. The SAM shall contain in its Subsequent Number
parameter only the additional digits received in this SIP INFO request.
##### 7.2.3.1.3A.3 Additional digits received in SIP INVITE requests
{#a.3-additional-digits-received-in-sip-invite-requests .H6}
If interworking of overlap signalling using the multiple INVITEs method is
supported by the I-MGCF, the ISUP IAM message has already been sent, but no
ISUP ACM or REL message has been received, and the I-MGCF receives an INVITE
with the same Call‑ID and From tag as a previous INVITE which was associated
with a BICC/ISUP call/bearer control instance currently existing on the
BICC/ISUP side, then:
a) If the number of digits in the Request‑URI is greater than the number of
digits already received for the communication, the I-MGCF shall generate a SAM
and pass it to outgoing BICC/ISUP procedures. The SAM shall contain in its
Subsequent Number parameter only the additional digits received in this
Request‑URI compared with the digits already received for the communication.
The I-MGCF shall reply to any earlier INVITE with a 484 Address Incomplete
response if this has not already been done.
b) If the number of digits in the Request‑URI is equal or less than the number
of digits already received for the communication, then the I-MGCF shall
immediately send a 484 Address Incomplete response for this INVITE. In this
case, no SAM shall be sent to BICC/ISUP procedures.
Figure 5b: Receipt of subsequent INVITE for multiple INVITEs method overlap
signalling
On sending of a 484 Address Incomplete message for an INVITE transaction, the
I-MGCF considers any offer/answer exchange initiated by the INVITE to be
terminated. The new INVITE initiates a new offer/answer exchange. However, if
resources have already been reserved and they can be reused within the new
offer/answer exchange, the precondition signalling shall reflect the current
status of the affected preconditions.
##### 7.2.3.1.4 Sending of 180 ringing
##### 7.2.3.1.4.0 General {#general-3 .H6}
The I-MGCF shall send the SIP 180 Ringing when receiving any of the following
messages:
\- ACM with Called party\'s status indicator set to subscriber free.
[]{.underline}
NOTE: The P-Early-Media header field is a included if the received INVITE
contains a P-Early-Media header field with the \"supported\" parameter as
described in IETF RFC 5009 [89].
Figure 6: The receipt of ACM
\- CPG with Event indicator set to alerting
[]{.underline}
NOTE: The P-Early-Media header field is a included if the received INVITE
contains a P-Early-Media header field with the \"supported\" parameter as
described in IETF RFC 5009 [89].
Figure 7: Receipt of CPG (Alerting)
For a speech call, if the INVITE request includes the P-Early-Media header
field, the I-MGCF shall include in the SIP 180 Ringing response a P-Early-
Media header field authorizing early media, except when
\- the I-MGCF has already sent a reliable provisional response (see IETF RFC
3262 [54]) including a P-Early-Media header, as defined in IETF RFC 5009 [89],
and
\- the most recently sent P-Early-Media header field authorized early media.
NOTE: If the I-MGCF signals the P-Early-Media header field authorizing early
media, then the IMS can expect tones or announcements to the calling party to
flow from the CS network via an MGW controlled by the I-MGCF. In particular,
once the I-MGCF sends the 180 Ringing response, ringback is expected in media
from the CS network.
As a network option, an I-MGCF may generate a Call-Info header field, or an
Alert-Info header field according to rules and procedures of IETF RFC 3261
[19] to provide media instead of the in-band media received from the PSTN.
##### 7.2.3.1.4.0a PSTN XML body {#a-pstn-xml-body .H6}
The procedures in the present clause apply only if the I-MGCF supports the
PSTN XML body as a network option. The I-MGCF shall map the Access Transport
parameter received in the CPG or ACM into PSTN XML elements as shown in table
7a.0f and include this PSTN XML body in the 180 Ringing.

The I-MGCF shall map a possibly available \"Progress indicator\" element in
the ATP parameter within the ACM or CPG into a ProgressIndicator in the PSTN
XML body of the 180 Ringing. In addition, the I-MGCF shall map the Backward
call indicators parameter and the Optional backward call indicators parameter
(if present) within the ACM or CPG into other ProgressIndicator(s) in the PSTN
XML body of the 180 Ringing as shown in table 7a.0g.
NOTE: The order of ProgressIndicators within the same PSTN XML body is
irrelevant.

##### 7.2.3.1.4.0b Fallback by I-MGCF {#b-fallback-by-i-mgcf .H6}
If the I-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option and the I-MGCF
received two PSTN XML Bearer Capability elements within the INVITE Request,
but the succeeding trunk does not support TMR \"64 kBit/s preferred\" ( as
described in clause 7.2.3.1.2.5a), and if no corresponding elements were
received in the Access Transport Parameter (see table 7a.0f) , then the I-MGCF
shall create a PSTN XML body containing the following elements, and include it
in the 18x Response :
\- a BearerCapability element, which shall becopied from the first
BearerCapability element received in the PSTN XML in the INVITE;
\- if two HighLayerCompatibility elements were present in the PSTN XML body in
the INVITE, then a HighLayerCompatibility element, which shall be copied from
the first HighLayerCompatibility element received in the PSTN XML in the
INVITE; and
\- a ProgressIndicator element with \"Progress Description\" value 5
(\"Interworking has occurred and has resulted in a telecommunication service
change\"),\"Coding Standard\" value \"00 (ITU-T standardized coding)\", and
default value \"0011 (Transit Network)\" for the \"Location\" parameter.
##### 7.2.3.1.4.1 Fallback in a succeeding network: Transmission Medium Used
parameter (TMU) received {#fallback-in-a-succeeding-network-transmission-
medium-used-parameter-tmu-received .H6}
The procedures in the present clause apply only if the I-MGCF supports the
PSTN XML body as a network option and receives a Transmission Medium Used
parameter (TMU).
NOTE: The I-MGCF will only receive a TMU parameter if it has applied the
Fallback related procedures in clause 7.2.3.1.2.5a, including both a TMR and
TMR Prime in the IAM, and fallback to the bearer capability identified in TMR
Prime and USI occurred in a succeeding network.
If the I-MGCF receives a Transmission Medium Used parameter (TMU) , the I-MGCF
shall:
\- If an BC is not available in the ATP in the Address Complete Message (ACM)
or Call Progress Message (CPG), map the TMU value (Speech or 3.1 kHz audio) to
the PSTN XML BearerCapability;
\- If an BC is available in the ATP in the Address Complete Message (ACM) or
Call Progress Message (CPG), include the received BC value the PSTN XML
BearerCapability;
\- configure the IM-MGW to use the second format in the m-line in the SDP that
has been received in the INVITE as codec at the IMS termination; and
\- send SDP selecting the second format in the m-line of the SDP that has been
received in the INVITE as soon as allowed according to SIP rules.

##### 7.2.3.1.4A Sending of 183 Session Progress for early media scenarios
If SIP preconditions are used, the first 183 Session Progress will be sent
after the reception of the INVITE request, before any ISUP message has been
received from the CS network. The I-MGCF shall not include the P-Early-Media
header field in any SIP message before it receives an ISUP ACM.
For a speech call upon receipt of one of the following messages and if the
I-MGCF has received the P-Early-Media header field in the INVITE request, and
has not already sent a provisional response including a P-Early-Media header
field with parameters indicating authorization of early media, then the I-MGCF
shall send the 183 Session Progress response with a P-Early-Media header field
authorizing early media:
\- ACM with the value of the called party\'s status indicator \"no
indication\" and one of the options described in table 7.2.3.1.4A.1 If the
I-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option, the I-MGCF shall map
parameters within the ACM into the PSTN XML body within the 183 as indicated
in table 7.2.3.1.4A.1. Based on local configuration, the I-MGCF may also send
a 183 Session Progress response with a P-Early-Media header field authorizing
early media if it receives an ACM with other parameters than described in
table 7.2.3.1.4A.1.

NOTE 2: As a network option the I-MGCF can also map CPG into 183 in other
cases than those described in table 7.2.3.1.4A.1.
If the I-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option, the I-MGCF shall
map the Access Transport Parameter received in the CPG or ACM into PSTN XML
elements as shown in table 7a.0f and include this PSTN XML body in the 183
Session Progress. The I-MGCF shall include both a ProgressIndicator mapped
from possibly received Progress indicator element in the Access Transport
Parameter and ProgressIndicators derived according to table 7.2.3.1.4A.1 or
table 7.2.3.1.4A.2 in the PSTN XML body.
NOTE 3: The order of ProgressIndicators within the same PSTN XML body is
irrelevant.
If the I-MGCF has applied UDI-TA fallback related procedures in clause
7.2.3.1.2.5a, the I-MGCF shall also apply the procedures in clauses
7.2.3.1.4.0b and 7.2.3.1.4.1, including the PSTN XML body in the 183 Session
Progress.
As a network option, an I-MGCF may generate a Call-Info header field, or an
Alert-Info header field according to rules and procedures of IETF RFC 3261
[19] to provide media instead of the in-band media received from the PSTN.
If the ACM or CPG contains an ISUP Cause, the MGCF may add a Reason header
field containing the received Cause Value to the SIP 183 Session Progress
provisional response as a network option. The mapping of the Cause Indicators
parameter to the Reason header as shown in table 9a shall be applied. IETF RFC
6432 [115] describes the use of the Reason header field in responses. The
Reason header field itself is described in IETF RFC 3326 [116].
##### 7.2.3.1.4B Sending of 181Call is being forwarded
The I-MGCF shall send the SIP 181 Call is being forwarded when receiving any
of the following messages:
\- ACM with call diversion information not indicating that presentation is not
allowed and optional backward call indicators indicate that in-band
information is available.
[]{.underline}
NOTE 1: The P-Early-Media header field is a included if the received INVITE
contains a P-Early-Media header field with the \"supported\" parameter as
described in IETF RFC 5009 [89].

\- the I-MGCF has already sent a reliable provisional response including a
P-Early-Media header field, as defined in IETF RFC 5009 [89], or a 180 Ringing
response; and
\- the most recently sent P-Early-Media header field authorized early media.
NOTE: If the I-MGCF signals the P-Early-Media header field authorizing early
media, then the IMS can expect tones or announcements to the calling party to
flow from the CS network via an MGW controlled by the I‑MGCF.
##### 7.2.3.1.4C Sending of 183 Session Progress for overlap signalling using
the in-dialog method
If the I-MGCF supports the network option of overlap signalling using the in-
dialog method, and the SIP INVITE request contained an indication that the
100rel extension is supported or required, the I-MGCF shall send a reliable
183 (Session Progress) response immediately after the reception of an INVITE
request.
NOTE: If the INVITE request does not contain an indication that the 100rel
extension is supported or required, it is assumed that overlap is not used,
and that no further digits will be received.
##### 7.2.3.1.4D Sending of 183 Session Progress to carry ISUP Cause
If the I-MGCF receives an ACM or CPG message containing an ISUP Cause, and if
the I-MGCF does not send any SIP provisional response due to interworking
procedures described in clauses 7.2.3.1.4A, for the ACM or CPG message, the
I-MGCF may send a SIP 183 Session Progress with a Reason header field
containing the received Cause Value as a network option. The mapping of the
Cause Indicators parameter to the Reason header as shown in table 9a shall be
applied. IETF RFC 6432 [115] describes the use of the Reason header field in
responses. The Reason header field itself is described in IETF RFC 3326 [116].

The following cases are possible trigger conditions for sending the 200 OK
(INVITE):
\- The reception of the ANM.

\- The reception of the CON message.
Figure 9: Receipt of CON
If the I-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option, the I-MGCF shall
map the Access Transport Parameter received in the ANM or CON into PSTN XML
elements as shown in table 7.2.3.1.5.1 and include this PSTN XML body in the
200 OK (INVITE).
On receipt of an ANM/CON message containing the ATP including the Bearer
Capability set to \"unrestricted digital information with tones/announcement\"
without TMU parameter the 200 OK message shall contain the PSTN XML Bearer
Capability \"unrestricted digital information with tones/announcement\".
If the I-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option, the I-MGCF shall
map an available BCI element in the ANM or CON into a ProgressIndicator in the
PSTN XML body as shown in table 7.2.3.1.5.2; the I-MGCF shall include both a
ProgressIndicator mapped from possibly received Progress indicator element in
the Access Transport Parameter and ProgressIndicators derived according to
table 7.2.3.1.5.2 in the PSTN XML.
NOTE 1: The order of ProgressIndicators within the same PSTN XML body is
irrelevant.

If the I-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body and receives a Transmission Medium
Used (TMU) parameter,
NOTE 2: The I-MGCF will only receive a TMU parameter if it has applied the
Fallback related procedures in clause 7.2.3.1.2.5a, including both a USI and
TMR Prime parameter in the IAM, and fallback to the bearer capability
identified in USI and TMR Prime occurred at the terminating side.
then the I-MGCF shall:
\- if a BC is not available in the ATP in the ANM or CON, map the TMU value
(Speech or 3.1 kHz audio) to the PSTN XML BearerCapability element;
\- if a BC is available in the ATP in the ANM or CON, include the received BC
in the PSTN XML BearerCapability element;
\- configure the IM-MGW to use the second format in the m-line in the SDP that
has been received in the INVITE as codec at the IMS termination; and
\- send SDP selecting the second format in the m-line of the SDP that has been
received in the INVITE as soon as allowed according to SIP rules.
If the I-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body, has applied the Fallback related
procedures in clause 7.2.3.1.2.5a, including both a TMR and TMR Prime in the
IAM, and did not receive TMU in the ANM, CON, or any previous ISUP message,
NOTE 3: Fallback to the bearer capability identified in TMR did not occurre at
the terminating side.
then the I-MGCF shall:
\- configure the IM-MGW to use the first format in the m-line in the SDP offer
that has been received in the INVITE as codec at the IMS termination; and
\- send SDP selecting the first format in the m-line in the SDP offer at the
first possibility according to SIP rules.
##### 7.2.3.1.6 Sending of the Release message (REL)
The following are possible triggers for sending the Release message:
\- Receipt of the BYE method
Figure 10: Receipt of the Bye method
\- Receipt of the CANCEL method
Figure 11: Receipt of Cancel method
Additional triggers are contained in table 10.
##### 7.2.3.1.7 Coding of the REL
If the Reason header field with Q.850 Cause Value is included in the BYE or
CANCEL request, then the Cause Value shall be mapped to the ISUP Cause Value
field in the ISUP REL. The mapping of the Reason header to the Cause
Indicators parameter is shown in table 8a. Table 8 shows the coding of the
Cause Value in the REL if it is not available from the Reason header field. In
both cases, the Location Field shall be set to \"_network beyond interworking
point_ \".

NOTE: The mapping of reason headers towards the ISDN can be misused due to
possible user creation of the reason header since there is no screening in
IMS.
If the I-MGCF supports this PSTN XML body as a network option and the I-MGCF
interworks media encoded in any of the formats in table 2a (G.711, Clearmode
or t38) without transcoding, and if a PSTN XML body is received in the BYE or
CANCEL request, the I-MGCF shall derive the Access Transport Parameter in the

##### 7.2.3.1.8 Receipt of the Release Message
If the REL message is received and a final response (i.e. 200 OK (INVITE)) has
already been sent, the I-MGCF shall send a BYE message.
NOTE: According to SIP procedures, in the case that the REL message is
received and a final response (e.g. 200 OK (INVITE)) has already been sent
(but no ACK request has been received) on the incoming side of the I-MGCF then
the I-MGCF does not send a 487 Request terminated response and instead waits
until the ACK request is received before sending a BYE message.
If the REL message is received and the final response (i.e. 200 OK (INVITE))
has not already been sent, the I-MGCF shall send a Status-Code 4xx (Client
Error), 5xx (Server Error) or 6xx (Global Failure) response. The Status code
to be sent is determined by examining the Cause value received in the REL
message. Table 9 specifies the mapping of the cause values, as defined in
ITU-T Recommendation Q.850 [38], to SIP response status codes. Cause values
not appearing in the table shall have the same mapping as the appropriate
class defaults according to ITU-T Recommendation Q.850 [38].

A Reason header field containing the received (Q.850) Cause Value of the REL
shall be added to the SIP final response or BYE request sent as a result of
this subclause. The mapping of the Cause Indicators parameter to the Reason
header is shown in table 9a. IETF RFC 6432 [115] describes the use of the
Reason header field in responses. The Reason header field itself is described
in IETF RFC 3326 [116].

As a network option, an I-MGCF may generate an Error-Info header field
according to rules and procedures of IETF RFC 3261 [19] to provide media
instead of the in-band media received from the PSTN.
If the I-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option, the I-MGCF shall
map the Access Transport Parameter received in the REL into PSTN XML elements
as shown in table 9aa and include this PSTN XML body in the SIP final response
or BYE.

##### 7.2.3.1.9 Receipt of RSC, GRS or CGB (H/W oriented)
Upon receipt of a RSC, GRS or CGB (H/W oriented) message the following applies
independently for each affected circuit:
NOTE: For the RSC message, the circuit identified by the CIC is affected.\ For
the GRS message, the affected circuits are identified by the CIC and the Range
subfield of the Range and Status parameter.\ For the CGB message, the affected
circuits are identified by the CIC and the Range and Status parameter.
If an initial address message has been sent for the affected circuit and after
at least one backward message relating to that call has been received then:
\- If the final response (i.e. 200 OK (INVITE)) has already been sent, the
I-MGCF shall send a BYE message.
\- If the final response (i.e. 200 OK (INVITE)) has not already been sent, the
I-MGCF shall send a SIP response with Status-Code 480 Temporarily Unavailable.
A Reason header field containing the (Q.850) Cause Value of the REL message
generated by the ISUP procedures shall be added to the SIP message (BYE or 480
response) to be sent by the SIP side of the I‑MGCF.
##### 7.2.3.1.9a Receipt of REFER
Figure 11a: Receipt of REFER method
Upon receipt of a REFER request at the MGCF, the default behaviour of the
I-MGCF is to reject the REFER request with a 403 Forbidden response.
NOTE: The I-MGCF may also decide for example to execute the REFER request as
specified in IETF RFC 3515 [75] as an operator option, but such handling is
outside of the scope of the present document.
##### 7.2.3.1.10 Autonomous Release at I-MGCF
Table 10 shows the trigger events at the MGCF and the release initiated by the
MGCF when the call is traversing from SIP to ISUP/BICC.
A Reason header field containing the (Q.850) Cause Value of the REL message
sent by the I‑MGCF shall be added to the SIP Message (BYE request or final
response) sent by the SIP side of the I‑MGCF.

Figure 11b: Receipt of an IAM
Upon reception of an IAM message, the O-MGCF shall send a SIP INVITE request,
as further detailed in the clauses below.
An O-MGCF shall support both the SIP preconditions and 100 rel extensions and
indicate the support of the SIP preconditions and 100rel extensions in the
INVITE request, unless the Note below applies.
NOTE: If the O-MGCF is deployed in an IMS network that by local configuration
serves no user requiring preconditions, it may send the INVITE request without
indicating support of preconditions.
##### 7.2.3.2.1.2 Interaction with continuity check {#interaction-with-
continuity-check .H6}
If the Continuity Check indicator in the Nature of Connection Indicators
parameter in the incoming IAM is set to indicate either \"_continuity check
required on this circuit_ \" or \"_continuity check performed on previous
circuit_ \", the O-MGCF should defer sending the INVITE request until
receiving a COT message.
NOTE: If the Continuity Check indicator in the Nature of Connection Indicators
parameter in the incoming IAM is set to indicate either \"_continuity check
required on this circuit_ \" or \"_continuity check performed on previous
circuit_ \" and the O-MGCF sends the INVITE request before receiving a COT
message, the following considerations apply: If the receiving terminal is not
supporting the SIP precondition and the SIP UPDATE method, clipping may occur.
Furthermore, if the MGCF sets the SDP \"inactive\" attribute in the initial
INVITE request and the receiving terminal is not supporting the SIP
precondition, the interworking procedures within the present specification do
not describe all necessary signalling interactions required to set up a call,
in particular with respect to the sending of the re-INVITE that may also cause
additional delay in the call setup. In addition, the interworking of the
ringing indication might not be possible if the peer sends the ringing
indication only as response to a re-INVITE.
NOTE: Waiting for the COT is recommended, if the Continuity Check indicator in
the Nature of Connection Indicators parameter in the incoming IAM is set to
indicate either \"_continuity check required on this circuit_ \" or
\"_continuity check performed on previous circuit_ \"

If no calling party number is received in the incoming IAM message, as a
network option, the O-MGCF may send an INR message to request the calling
party number and not send the INVITE request until receiving an INF message
with calling party number. If no calling party number is received in the INF
message, O-MGCF may reject or continue the call based on local configuration.

##### 7.2.3.2.1.4 Terminating overlap signalling at MGCF {#terminating-
overlap-signalling-at-mgcf .H6}
Figure 13: Receipt of an IAM (Overlap signalling in CS network)
After initiating the normal incoming BICC/ISUP call establishment procedures,
determining the end of address signalling and selecting to route the call to
the IMS domain, the O‑MGCF shall send the initial INVITE.
The end of address signalling shall be determined by the earlier of the
following criteria:
a) by receipt of an end-of-pulsing (ST) signal; or
b) by receipt of the maximum number of digits used in the national numbering
plan; or
c) by analysis of the called party number to indicate that a sufficient number
of digits has been received to route the call to the called party; or
d) by observing that timer Ti/w1 has expired after the receipt of the latest
address message and the minimum number of digits required for routing the call
have been received.
If the end of the address signalling is determined in accordance with criteria
a) b) or c), the timer Ti/w2 is started when INVITE is sent. Also, if the PSTN
XML body is supported as a network option, the O-MGCF shall insert the PSTN
XML sendingCompleteIndication.
##### 7.2.3.2.1.5 Fallback (optional) {#fallback-optional .H6}
The Fallback mechanism described in the present clause shall only apply if the
O-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option, and propagates UDI-TA
fallback signalling into the IMS as a network option.
NOTE: If the Fallback related signalling is not forwarded according to the
procedures in the present sublause by the O-MGCF, the O-MGCF will apply the
ISUP Fallback procedures when the IAM includes a TMR and a TMR prime parameter
and a USI and USI Prime parameter.
When the IAM includes a TMR and a TMR prime parameter and a USI and USI Prime
parameter then the O-MGCF shall:
\- map the \"USI Prime\" into the \"InformationTransferCapability\" of the
second BearerCapability element in the PSTN XML body;
\- include SDP with one m-line of \"audio\" media type in the INVITE;
\- map the \"TMR\" and \"USI Prime\" into a first offerered format in the SDP
m-line according to table 10b;
\- map the \"USI\" into the first Bearer Capability element in the PSTN XML
body;
\- map the \"TMR prime\" into the \"InformationTransferCapability\" of the
first BearerCapability element in the PSTN XML body; and
\- map the TMR prime and USI into a second offerered format in the SDP m-line
according to table 10b.
##### 7.2.3.2.1a Sending of INVITE without determining the end of address
signalling
##### 7.2.3.2.1a.1 General {#a.1-general-1 .H6}
As a network option, the O-MGCF is not required to determine the end of
address signalling. In this case the O-MGCF shall send an initial INVITE when
a preconfigured number of digits has been reached.
When the MGCF receives ISUP SAM messages the additional digits received in the
SAMs may either be sent using the in-dialog overlap method as specified in
clause 7.2.3.2.1a.2 or using the multiple INVITEs overlap method as specified
in 7.2.3.2.1a.3. It depends on the network configuration which of these
methods is applied. However, within one IMS only a single method shall be
used.
##### 7.2.3.2.1a.2 Additional digits sent with in-dialog overlap method
{#a.2-additional-digits-sent-with-in-dialog-overlap-method .H6}
Figure 14: Overlap signalling using in-dialog INFOs in CS an IMS network
If the O-MGCF sends an initial SIP INVITE request before the end of address
signalling is determined, the O-MGCF shall:
\- use the SIP precondition extension within the SIP INVITE request;
\- start timer Ti/w2;
\- be prepared to process SAM as described below;
\- be prepared to handle incoming SIP 18x provisional responses, establishing
early dialogs; and
\- be prepared to handle incoming SIP 404 or 484 error responses as detailed
in clause 7.2.3.2.12.1.
NOTE 1: A SIP INVITE request with incomplete address information can be
rejected with a SIP 404 or 484 error response.
On receipt of a SAM from the BICC/ISUP side, unless the O-MGCF has received a
SIP 180 (Ringing) response for the call, the following O-MGCF procedures
apply:
\- The O-MGCF shall stop timer Ti/w3 (if it is running).
\- If no response has been received for the previous INVITE request of the
same call, the O-MGCF shall wait for the response and then apply the
procedures in the next bullets to transfer the digits received in the SAM. If
additional SAMs are received while the O-MGCF is waiting for the response for
the previous SIP INVITE request, the digits within shall be combined with the
digits of the previous SAMs.
\- If an early dialog has not been established, and a SIP 404 or 484 error
response has been received for the last previous SIP INVITE request for the
same call, the O-MGCF shall send a SIP INVITE request complying to the
following:
\- The SIP INVITE request shall use the SIP preconditions extension.
\- The SIP INVITE request shall include all digits received so far for this
call in the Request‑URI.
\- The SIP INVITE request shall include the same Call‑ID and From tag as the
previous SIP INVITE request for the call.
\- If an early dialog has been established, and a response has been received
for any previously sent SIP INFO request (\"legacy\" mode of usage of the INFO
method as defined in IETF RFC 6086 [133]), the O-MGCF shall send an in-dialog
SIP INFO request complying the following:
\- The SIP INFO request shall only include the digits received since the
previous SIP request with digits was sent (see Note).
\- If no response has been received for the previous SIP INFO request, the
O-MGCF shall wait for the response and then apply the procedures in the
previous bullet to transfer digits received in the SAM. If additional SAMs are
received while the O-MGCF is waiting for the response for the previous SIP
INFO request, the digits within shall be combined with the digits of the
previous SAMs.
\- Restart Ti/w2.
If timer Ti/w2 has expired, or the O-MGCF has received a SIP 180 (Ringing)
response for the call, the O‑MGCF shall ignore subsequent SAMs received.
NOTE 2: The encoding of the digits within the SIP INFO request is described in
clause 7.2.3.2.20.2.
##### 7.2.3.2.1a.3 Additional digits sent using the multiple INVITEs overlap
method {#a.3-additional-digits-sent-using-the-multiple-invites-overlap-method
.H6}
Figure 14a: Overlap signalling using multiple INVITEs in CS an IMS network
If the O-MGCF sends an SIP INVITE request before the end of address signalling
is determined, the O-MGCF shall:
\- use the SIP precondition extension within the SIP INVITE request;
\- start timer Ti/w2; and
\- be prepared to process SAM as described below; and
\- be prepared to handle incoming SIP 404 or 484 error responses as detailed
in clause 7.2.3.2.12.1.
NOTE: An SIP INVITE request with incomplete address information will be
rejected with a SIP 404 or 484 error response.
On receipt of a SAM from the BICC/ISUP side, unless the O-MGCF has received a
SIP 180 (Ringing) response for the call, the O‑MGCF shall:
\- stop timer Ti/w3 (if it is running);
\- send an INVITE request complying to the following:
\- The SIP INVITE request shall use the SIP preconditions extension.
\- The SIP INVITE request shall include all digits received so far for this
call in the Request‑URI.
\- The SIP INVITE request shall include the same Call‑ID and From tag as the
previous SIP INVITE request for the call.
\- restart Ti/w2;
If timer Ti/w2 has expired, or the O-MGCF has received a SIP 180 (Ringing)
response for the call, the O‑MGCF shall ignore subsequent SAMs received.
##### 7.2.3.2.2 Coding of the INVITE
##### 7.2.3.2.2.0 Overview {#overview .H6}
Table 10aa provides a summary of how the header fields within the outgoing
INVITE message are populated.

##### 7.2.3.2.2.1 REQUEST URI Header {#request-uri-header .H6}
The called party number parameter of the IAM message is used to derive Request
URI of the INVITE Request. The Request URI is a tel URI or SIP URI with
\"user=phone\" and shall contain:
\- an E.164 International public telecommunication number prefixed by a \"+\"
sign (e.g. tel:+4911231234567) , or
\- a non E.164 number (national operator option for service numbers),
expressed as a local number as per IETF RFC 3966 [97].

##### 7.2.3.2.2.2 SDP Media Description {#sdp-media-description .H6}
If the O-MGCF indicates support of the SIP preconditions in the initial INVITE
request and local preconditions have not been met, the SDP media description
shall contain precondition information as per TS 24.229 [9]. Depending on the
coding of the continuity indicators different precondition information (IETF
RFC 3312 [37]) is included. If the continuity indicator indicates \"continuity
performed on a previous circuit\" or \"continuity required on this circuit\",
and the INVITE is sent before receiving a COT, message (which is not
recommended according to clause 7.2.3.2.1.1), then the O-MGCF shall indicate
that the preconditions are not met. Otherwise the O-MGCF shall indicate
whether the preconditions are met, dependent on thestatus of the local
resource reservation. If the local preconditions are not met the O-MGCF should
set the media stream to inactive mode (by including an attribute
\"a=inactive\"). If the local configuration indicates that O-MGCF is deployed
in the IMS network that serves users supporting SIP precondition mechanism,
the attribute \"a=inactive\" may be omitted when the initial SDP offer
indicates local preconditions are not met. If the initial SDP offer indicates
local preconditions are fulfilled, the O-MGCF shall not set the media stream
to inactive mode.
If the O-MGCF determines that a speech call is incoming, the O-MGCF shall
include the AMR codec transported according to IETF RFC 4867 [23] with the
options listed in clause 5.1.1 of TS 26.236 [32] in the SDP offer, unless the
Note below applies. Within the SDP offer, the O-MGCF should also provide SDP
RR and RS bandwidth modifiers specified in IETF RFC 3556 [59] to disable RTCP,
as detailed in clause 7.4 of TS 26.236 [32]. The O-MGCF may include other
codecs according to operator policy.
NOTE: If the O-MGCF is deployed in an IMS network that by local configuration
serves no user equipment that implements the AMR codec, then the AMR codec may
be excluded from the SDP offer.
To avoid transcoding or to support non-speech services, the O-MGCF may add
media derived from the incoming ISUP information according to table 10b. The
support of the media listed in table 10b is optional. If the O-MGCF supports
the PSTN XML body as a network option and adds media derived from the incoming
ISUP information according to table 10b, the O-MGCF shall also map the media
related ISUP information into the XML body as shown in table 7.2.3.2.2.7.1.

##### 7.2.3.2.2.3A \"cpc\" URI Parameter in P-Asserted-Identity Header
{#a-cpc-uri-parameter-in-p-asserted-identity-header .H6}
See Annex C for normative interworking of a Calling party\'s category to a
\"cpc\" URI parameter within P-Asserted-Identity header field.
##### 7.2.3.2.2.3B \"oli\" URI Parameter in P-Asserted-Identity Header
{#b-oli-uri-parameter-in-p-asserted-identity-header .H6}
See Annex H for normative interworking of the \"oli\" URI parameter as a
network option.
##### 7.2.3.2.2.4 Max Forwards header {#max-forwards-header .H6}
If the Hop Counter procedure is supported in the CS network, the O‑MGCF shall
use the Hop Counter parameter to derive the Max-Forwards SIP header. Due to
the different default values (that are based on network demands/provisions) of
the SIP Max-Forwards header and the Hop Counter, an adaptation mechanism shall
be used to adopt the Hop Counter to the Max Forwards at the O‑MGCF. For
example, the following guidelines could be applied.
a) Max-Forwards for a given message should be monotone decreasing with each
successive visit to a SIP entity, regardless of intervening interworking, and
similarly for Hop Counter.
b) The initial and successively mapped values of Max-Forwards should be large
enough to accommodate the maximum number of hops that may be expected of a
validly routed call.
The table 17 shows the principle of the mapping:
Table 17: Hop counter-Max forwards
* * *
Hop Counter = X Max-Forwards = Y = Integer part of (X * Factor) NOTE: The
Mapping of value X to Y should be done with the used (implemented) adaptation
mechanism.
* * *
The factor used to map from Hop Counter to Max‑Forwards for a given call will
depend on call origin, and will be provisioned at the O‑MGCF based on network
topology, trust domain rules, and bilateral agreement.
The Principle of adaptation could be implemented on a basis of the network
provision, trust domain rules and bilateral agreement.
##### 7.2.3.2.2.5 IMS Communication Service Identifier {#ims-communication-
service-identifier .H6}
For speech and video calls, the O-MGCF shall insert an IMS Communication
Service Identifier, indicating the IMS Multimedia Telephony Communication
Service.
The IMS Communication Service Identifier for the IMS Multimedia Telephony
Communication Service is defined in TS 24.173 [88].
##### 7.2.3.2.2.6 P-Early-Media header field {#p-early-media-header-field .H6}
For a speech call the O-MGCF may include the P-Early-Media header field with
the \"supported\" parameter as described in IETF RFC 5009 [89] in each
outgoing INVITE request.
NOTE: The P-Early-Media header with the \"supported\" parameter can be ignored
by terminating devices when not supporting the procedures described in IETF
RFC 5009 [89].
##### 7.2.3.2.2.7 PSTN XML elements {#pstn-xml-elements .H6}
If the O-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option, the O-MGCF shall
map ISUP information into the XML body as shown in table 7.2.3.2.2.7.1 and
7.2.3.2.2.8.1.

##### 7.2.3.2.2A Coding of the INVITE when Number Portability is supported
This clause describes optional coding procedures when Number Portability is
supported.
##### 7.2.3.2.2A.1 REQUEST URI and To Header {#a.1-request-uri-and-to-header
.H6}
When Number Portability is supported, the method used for signalling of the
Called Party E.164 address and the Number Portability Routing Number
determines the parameters of the IAM message used to derive the Request URI of
the INVITE Request.
The number portability information (rn and npdi) shall not be mapped into the
To header field.
ITU-T Q.769.1 [92] describes three possible addressing methods for signalling
of the Called Party E.164 address and Number Portability Routing Number (ITU-T
Q.769.1 [92] uses the terms directory number and network routing number
respectively). The choice of these methods is based on network operator and
national requirements.
The following clauses describe how the Request URI and To header fields are
populated, based on these methods, when a Number Portability Routing Number is
available in the IAM.
When the optional Number Portability Routing Number is available and
supported, these procedures take precedence over procedures for coding of the
Request URI and To header fields described in clause 7.2.3.2.2.1.
When a Number Portability Routing Number is not available, the Request URI and
To Header fields are populated as described in clause 7.2.3.2.2.1, with the

##### 7.2.3.2.2C Coding of INVITE with instance-id in form of IMEI URN
An Emergency Access Transfer Function (EATF) that provides IMS-based
mechanisms for enabling service continuity of IMS emergency sessions is
described in TS 23.237 [118]. A correlation of the call legs at the EATF is
based on the equipment identifier.
A Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEI) parameter of the Mobile Service Transport
(MST) Application Transport Parameter is defined in TS 29.205 [14].
An instance-id is a SIP Contact header field parameter defined in IETF RFC
5626 [119]. When an IMEI is available, the instance-id shall take the form of
an International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI) URN as specified in
IETF RFC 7254 [120].
When an O-MGCF receives the Mobile Service Transport (MST) Application
Transport Parameter containing the Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEI) parameter
within the IAM the O-MGCF shall perform the mapping to the \"+sip.instance\"

##### 7.2.3.2.3 Receipt of CONTINUITY
This clause only applies if the O-MGCF has sent the INVITE request without
waiting for an outstanding COT message (see clause 7.2.3.2.1).
Figure 14a: Receipt of COT (success)
When the requested local preconditions (if any) have been met and if possible
outstanding continuity procedures have successfully been completed (COT with
the Continuity Indicators parameter set to \"continuity check successful\" is
received), a SDP offer (e.g. a SIP UPDATE request, as defined in IETF RFC 3311
[55]) shall be sent for each early SIP dialogue for which the received
provisional response indicated support of preconditions confirming that all
the required local preconditions have been met. If the O-MGCF previously
offered inactive media stream it shall set the media stream to active mode.
NOTE: This procedure applies regardless of whether the early SIP dialog
existed prior to the preconditions being fulfilled or is subsequently created.
##### 7.2.3.2.4 Sending of ACM and awaiting answer indication
If the Address Complete Message (ACM) has not yet been sent, the following
cases are possible trigger conditions that shall lead to the sending the
address complete message (ACM):
\- the detection of end of address signalling by the expiry of Timer T i/w~1~
or,
Figure 15: Sending of ACM T i/w1 elapses
\- the reception of the first 180 Ringing. An O-MGCF initiates the sending of
an awaiting answer indication only if according to IETF RFC 5009 [89] backward
early media is not authorized (the most recently received P-Early-Media header
field is received does not authorize the backward early media or the P-Early-
Media header field has not yet been received).
Figure 16: Sending of ACM (Receipt of first 180 Ringing and backward early
media is not authorized)
Based on local knowledge that the call is transited to a PSTN network, the
O-MGCF may decide not to generate the awaiting answer indication when
receiving the 180 Ringing message and backward early media is not authorized
according to IETF RFC 5009 [89].
Figure 16a: Sending of ACM (Receipt of first 180 Ringing and backward early
media is authorized)
\- the reception of the first 181 Call is Being Forwarded.

\- At an O-MGCF once all the following sub-conditions have been met: {1} the
reception of the first 183 Session Progress that includes a P-Early-Media
header field authorizing backward early media, and {2} SDP preconditions are
not used, or applicable SDP preconditions have been met.

includes authorization of early media)
\- As a network option, reception of 183 containing a SIP reason header with
an Q.850 Cause Value.

Reason header)
\- Ti/w 2 expires after the initial INVITE is sent.
Figure 17: Sending of ACM (Ti/w2 elapses)
The sending of an awaiting answer indication is described in clause 9.2.3.3.
When a 180 (Ringing) response is received with the Alert-Info header field at
an O-MGCF supporting capabilities associated with the Alert-Info header field
an O-MGCF may instruct the IM-MGW to play out early media available at the
associated URL to the PSTN leg of the communication.
If the O-MGCF receives a 18x response with a P-Early-Media header field that
changes the authorization of early media, the O-MGCF terminates the sending of
the awaiting answer indication if the header field authorizes backward early
media, and initiates the sending of the awaiting answer indication if the
header field removes authorization of backward early media and if the O-MGCF
has received the 180 Ringing response.

The procedures in the present clause shall only apply if the O-MGCF supports
the PSTN XML body, and has propagated UDI-TA fallback signalling according to
clause 7.2.3.2.1.5.
If a Bearer Capability element within a PSTN XML body is received within the
first 200 OK(INVITE) or has been previously stored from a 18x message relating
to the now established dialog (i.e. the dialogue for which the first 200 OK
has been received), the O-MGCF shall map the most recently received
information (if any) into a TMU within the ANM as shown in table
7.2.3.2.9.3.1. If the most recently received PSTN XML BearerCapability is
\"UDI-TA\", it shall be mapped into an ISUP Access Transport Parameter Bearer
Capability (see clause 7.2.3.2.9.2).
NOTE: The TMU is only included if both the TMR and TMR Prime were received in
the ISUP IAM and fallback has occurred.

##### 7.2.3.2.11A Receipt of a reINVITE request
When a reINVITE request is received from the network containing a Call-Info
header field the MGCF may instruct the IM-MGW to send media available at the
associated URL to the PSTN leg of the communication.
##### 7.2.3.2.12 Receipt of Status Codes 4xx, 5xx or 6xx
Figure 21: Receipt of Status codes 4xx, 5xx or 6xx
If a Reason header as described in IETF RFC 6432 [115] is included in a 4xx,
5xx, 6xx response, then the Cause Value of the Reason header shall be mapped
to the ISUP Cause Value field in the ISUP REL message. The Reason header field
itself is described in IETF RFC 3326 [116]. The mapping of the Reason header
to the Cause Indicators parameter is shown in table 8a (see clause 7.2.3.1.7).
Otherwise coding of the Cause value field in the REL message is derived from
the SIP Status code received according to table 18. The Cause Indicators
Parameter Values are defined in ITU-T Recommendation Q.850 [38].
In all cases where SIP itself specifies additional SIP side behaviour related
to the receipt of a particular INVITE response these procedures should be
followed in preference to the immediate sending of a REL message to BICC/ISUP.
If there are no SIP side procedures associated with this response, the REL
shall be sent immediately.
NOTE Depending upon the SIP side procedures applied at the O-MGCF it is
possible that receipt of certain 4xx/5xx/6xx responses to an INVITE may in
some cases not result in any REL message being sent to the BICC/ISUP network.
For example, if a 401 Unauthorized response is received and the O-MGCF
successfully initiates a new INVITE containing the correct credentials, the
call will proceed.

If the O-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option and if a PSTN XML
body is received within the 4xx/5xx/6xx, the O-MGCF shall map the contained
information into the Access Transport Parameter of the REL as shown in clause
7.2.3.2.9.2.
When a 4xx, 5xx or 6xx SIP response to an INVITE request is received from the
network containing an Error-Info header field, the O-MGCF, supporting the
capabilities associated with the Error-Info header field, may instruct the IM-
MGW to play out media available at the associated URL towards PSTN.
##### 7.2.3.2.12.1 Special handling of 404 Not Found and 484 Address
Incomplete responses after sending of INVITE without determining the end of
address signalling {#special-handling-of-404-not-found-and-484-address-
incomplete-responses-after-sending-of-invite-without-determining-the-end-of-
address-signalling .H6}
This clause is only applicable when the network option of Sending of INVITE
without determining the end of address signalling is being used (see clause
7.2.3.2.1.a).
On receipt of a 404 Not Found or 484 Address Incomplete response while Ti/w2
is running, the O-MGCF shall start timer Ti/w3, if there are no other pending
INVITE transactions for the corresponding call.
At the receipt of a SAM, a SIP 1xx provisional response or a SIP 200 OK
(INVITE), the O-MGCF shall stop Ti/w2 and Ti/w3.
The O-MGCF shall send a REL message with Cause Value 28 towards the BICC/ISUP
network if Ti/w3 expires.
##### 7.2.3 2.13 Receipt of a BYE
Figure 22: Receipt of BYE method
If a Reason header field with Q.850 Cause Value is included in the BYE
request, then the Cause Value shall be mapped to the ISUP Cause Value field in
the ISUP REL as shown in table 8a (see clause 7.2.3.1.7). Otherwise, the
O-MGCF sends a REL message with Cause Code value 16 (Normal Call Clearing).
If the O-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option and if a PSTN XML
body is received within the BYE, the O-MGCF shall map the contained
information into the Access Transport Parameter of the REL as shown in clause
7.2.3.2.9.2.
##### 7.2.3.2.14 Receipt of the Release Message
In the case that the REL message is received and a final response (i.e. 200 OK
(INVITE)) has already been received the O-MGCF shall send a BYE request. If
the final response (i.e. 200 OK (INVITE)) has not already been received the
O-MGCF shall send a CANCEL method.
A Reason header field containing the received (Q.850) Cause Value of the REL
message shall be added to the CANCEL or BYE request. The mapping of the Cause
Indicators parameter to the Reason header is shown in table 9a (see clause
7.2.3.1.8).
If the O-MGCF supports the PSTN XML body as a network option, the O-MGCF shall
map the contained information into a PSTN XML body within the BYE or CANCEL as
shown in table 9aa.
##### 7.2.3.2.15 Receipt of RSC, GRS or CGB (H/W oriented)
Upon receipt of a RSC, GRS or CGB (H/W oriented) message the following applies
independently for each affected circuit:
NOTE: For the RSC message, the circuit identified by the CIC is affected.\ For
the GRS message, the affected circuits are identified by the CIC and the Range
subfield of the Range and Status parameter.\ For the CGB message, the affected
circuits are identified by the CIC and the Range and Status parameter.
If a final response (i.e. 200 OK (INVITE) has already been received, the
O-MGCF shall send a BYE method. If a final response (i.e. 200 OK (INVITE)) has
not already been received, the O-MGCF shall send a CANCEL method.
A Reason header field containing the (Q.850) Cause Value of the REL message
generated by the ISUP procedures shall be added to the SIP message (BYE or
CANCEL request) to be sent by the SIP side of the O‑MGCF.
##### 7.2.3.2.16 Autonomous Release at O-MGCF
If the O-MGCF determines due to internal procedures that the call shall be
released then the MGCF shall send
\- A BYE method if the ACK has been sent.
\- A CANCEL method before 200 OK (INVITE) has been received.
NOTE: The MGCF shall send the ACK method before it sends the BYE, if 200 OK
(INVITE) is received.
A Reason header field containing the (Q.850) Cause Value of the REL message
sent by the O‑IWU shall be added to the SIP Message (BYE or CANCEL request) to
be sent by the SIP side of the O‑IWU.

Figure 23: Receipt of COT (failure).
CANCEL shall be sent if the Continuity message is received with the Continuity
Indicators parameter set to \"_continuity check failed_ \" or the ISUP (or
BICC) timer T8 expires.
A Reason header field containing the (Q.850) Cause Value 41 Temporary Failure
shall be added to the CANCEL request to be sent by the SIP side of the O‑MGCF.
##### 7.2.3.2.19 Receipt of SIP redirect (3xx) response
Figure 24: Receipt of SIP response code 3xx
When receiving a SIP response with a response code 3xx, the default behaviour
of the O-MGCF is to release the call with a cause code value 127 (Interworking
unspecified).
NOTE: The O-MGCF may also decide for example to redirect the call towards the
URIs in the Contact header field of the response as an operator option, but
such handling is outside of the scope of the present document.
##### 7.2.3.2.20 Sending of INFO for overlap signalling using the in-dialog
method
##### 7.2.3.2.20.1 General {#general-9 .H6}
SIP INFO request (\"legacy\" mode of usage of the INFO method as defined in
IETF RFC 6086 [133]) is used to carry additional digits when overlap
signalling is sent using the in-dialog method as described in clause
7.2.3.2.1a.2, which is a network option. clause 7.2.3.2.1a.2 also describes
when the O-MGCF sends a SIP INFO request.
##### 7.2.3.2.20.2 Encoding of the INFO {#encoding-of-the-info .H6}
Table 18b provides a summary of how the header fields within the outgoing INFO
messages are populated when in-dialog SIP INFO requests are used for overlap
dialling.

The through connection procedure is described in clauses 9.2.2.1.5 and
9.2.2.2.5.
##### 7.3.3.1.11 Out of Band DTMF
If a SIP UA sends DTMF tones to the IM-MGW, the IM-MGW may report this
information via the Mn interface to the MGCF. The MGCF shall send to the BICC
network the APM message with the following values for the different
parameters:
\- Action indicator in accordance with the requested DTMF transport function;
\- Signal in accordance with which DTMF digit to send;
\- Duration in accordance with the required duration of the DTMF digit.
If the BICC network sends an APM message with DTMF signal, duration and action
indicator to the MGCF, the MGCF may send this information to the IM-MGW via
the Mn interface. The IM-MGW shall send the corresponding DTMF signal and
duration information on the user plane of the IM CN subsystem according to RFC
4733 [105].
The interactions with the IM-MGW are shown in clause 9.2.8.
#### 7.3.3.2 Outgoing Call Interworking from BICC to SIP at O-MGCF
##### 7.3.3.2.1 Sending of INVITE
The following particularities apply for a BICC IAM received case, with regard
to the already specified in clause 7.2.3.2.1.
The O-MGCF should defer sending the INVITE request until the BICC bearer setup
and any local resource reservation is completed.
NOTE: If the O-MGCF sends the INVITE request before the BICC bearer setup and
any local resource reservation is completed, the following considerations
apply: If the receiving terminal is not supporting the SIP precondition,
clipping may occur. Furthermore, if the MGCF sets the SDP \"inactive\"
attribute in the initial INVITE request and the receiving terminal is not
supporting the SIP precondition and the SIP UPDATE method, the interworking
procedures within the present specification do not describe all necessary
signalling interactions required to set up a call, in particular with respect
to the sending of the re-INVITE that may also cause additional delay in the
call setup. In addition, the interworking of the ringing indication might not
be possible if the peer sends the ringing indication only as response to a re-
INVITE.
The BICC bearer setup is completed when one of the following conditions is
met:
\- The event Bearer Set-up indication -- for the forward bearer set-up case
where the incoming Connect Type is \"notification not required\", which
indicate successful completion of bearer set-up, is received by the Incoming
bearer set-up procedure (ITU-T Recommendation Q.1902.4 [30] clause 7.5);
\- Bearer Set-up Connect indication for the backward call set-up case, which
indicate successful completion of bearer set-up, is received by the Incoming
bearer set-up procedure (ITU-T Recommendation Q.1902.4 [30] clause 7.5);
\- BNC set-up success indication for cases using bearer control tunnelling
which indicate successful completion of bearer set-up, is received by the
Incoming bearer set-up procedure (ITU-T Recommendation Q.1902.4 [30] clause
7.5).
##### 7.3.3.2.1a Sending of INVITE without determining the end of address
signalling

##### 7.3.3.2.2 Coding of the INVITE
##### 7.3.3.2.2.1 REQUEST URI Header {#request-uri-header-1 .H6}
See clause 7.2.3.2.2.1
##### 7.3.3.2.2.2 SDP Media Description {#sdp-media-description-1 .H6}
If the O-MGCF sends the INVITE request without waiting for the BICC bearer
setup and any local resource reservation to complete, (which is not
recommended according to clause 7.3.3.2.1) it shall indicate that SIP
preconditions are not met when the initial INVITE request indicates support of
the SIP preconditions.
The SDP media description shall contain precondition information as per TS
24.229 [9]. If the local preconditions are not met the O-MGCF should set the
media stream to inactive mode (by including an attribute \"a=inactive\"). If
the local configuration indicates that O-MGCF is deployed in the IMS network
that serves users supporting SIP precondition mechanism, the attribute
\"a=inactive\" may be omitted when the initial SDP offer indicates local
preconditions are not met. If the initial SDP offer indicates local
preconditions are fulfilled, the O-MGCF shall not set the media stream to
inactive mode.
The O-MGCF shall include the AMR codec transported according to IETF RFC 4867
[23] with the options listed in clause 5.1.1 of TS 26.236 [32] in the SDP
offer. Within the SDP offer, the O-MGCF should also provide SDP RR and RS
bandwidth modifiers specified in IETF RFC 3556 [59] to disable RTCP, as
detailed in clause 7.4 of TS 26.236 [32].

For speech and video calls, the O-MGCF shall insert an IMS Communication
Service Identifier, indicating the IMS Multimedia Telephony Communication
Service.
The IMS Communication Service Identifier for the IMS Multimedia Telephony
Communication Service is defined in TS 24.173 [88].

See clause 7.2.3.2.2C.
##### 7.3.3.2.3 Sending of UPDATE
This clause only applies if the O-MGCF sends the INVITE request before SIP
preconditions are met (see clause 7.3.3.2.1) .
Figure 30: Receipt of COT (success)
The UPDATE request with a new SDP offer shall be sent for each early SIP
dialogue for which the received provisional response indicated support of
preconditions confirming that all the required local preconditions have been
met when all the following conditions are met.
1\. A Continuity message, with the Continuity Indicators parameter set to
\"continuity check successful\" shall be received.
2\. The reservation of requested local resources has been completed.
In addition, depending on which bearer set-up procedure used for the call one
of the following condition shall be met:
\- The event Bearer Set-up indication -- for the forward bearer set-up case
where the incoming Connect Type is \"notification not required\", which
indicate successful completion of bearer set-up, is received by the Incoming
bearer set-up procedure (ITU-T Recommendation Q.1902.4 [30] clause 7.5);
\- Bearer Set-up Connect indication for the backward call set-up case, which
indicate successful completion of bearer set-up, is received by the Incoming
bearer set-up procedure (ITU-T Recommendation Q.1902.4 [30] clause 7.5);
\- BNC set-up success indication for cases using bearer control tunnelling
which indicate successful completion of bearer set-up, is received by the
Incoming bearer set-up procedure, (ITU-T Recommendation Q.1902.4 [30] clause
7.5).
If the O-MGCF previously offered inactive media stream it shall set the media
stream to active mode.
NOTE: This procedure applies regardless of whether the early SIP dialog
existed prior to the preconditions being fulfilled or is subsequently created.

## 7.4 Supplementary Services
The following clauses describe the MGCF behaviour related to supplementary
services as defined in ITU-T Recommendations Q.730 to ITU-T Q.737 [42] when
interworking with an IMS which does not use a Multimedia Telephony Application
Server (MTAS) providing supplementary services according to 3GPP according to
TS 24.173 [88]. The support of these supplementary services is optional. If
the supplementary services are supported, the procedures described within this
clause shall be applied.
### 7.4.1 Calling line identification presentation/restriction (CLIP/CLIR)
The inter working between the Calling Party Number parameter and the
P-Asserted-ID header and vice versa used for the CLIP-CLIR service is defined
in the clauses 7.2.3.1.2.6 and 7.2.3.2.2.3. This inter working is essentially
the same as for basic call and differs only in that if the CLIR service is
invoked the \"Address Presentation Restriction Indicator (APRI)\" (in the case
of ISUP to SIP calls) or the \"priv value\" of the \"calling\" Privacy header
field (in the case of SIP to ISUP calls) is set to the appropriate
\"restriction/privacy\" value.
In the specific case of ISUP originated calls, use of the CLIP service
additionally requires the ability to determine whether the number was network
provided or provided by the access signalling system. Due to the possible SIP
indication of the P-Asserted-Identity the Screening indicator is set to
network provided as default. For the CLIP-CLIR service the mapping of the APRI
from privacy header at the O-MGCF is described within table 16 in clause
7.2.3.2.2.3.
At the O-MGCF the presentation restricted indication shall be mapped to the
Privacy header field values \"id\" and \"header\". This is described in table
12 in clause 7.2.3.2.2.3.
### 7.4.2 Connected line presentation and restriction (COLP/COLR)
#### 7.4.2.0 General
The COLP/COLR services are only to be interworked between trusted nodes \-
that is before passing any COLP/COLR information over the SIP-BICC/ISUP
boundary the MGCF shall satisfy itself that the nodes on the BICC/ISUP side to
which the information is to be passed are trusted.
The procedure within clause 7.5.2 for the generic number (\"additional
connected number\") mapping shall apply.
#### 7.4.2.1 Incoming Call Interworking from SIP to BICC/ISUP at the I-MGCF
##### 7.4.2.1.1 INVITE to IAM interworking (SIP to ISUP/BICC calls)
In the case of SIP to ISUP/BICC calls the I-MGCF may invoke the COLP service
as an operator option by setting the \"Connected Line Identity Request
indicator\" field of the \"Optional forward call indicators\" parameter of the
IAM to \"requested\".
NOTE: This implies that all outgoing calls will invoke the COLP service.
##### 7.4.2.1.2 ANM/CON to 200 OK (INVITE)
Tables 20 and 21 specify the interworking required in the case when the COLP
has been automatically requested on behalf of the originating SIP node. The
table also indicates the inter workings required if the COLP service has been
invoked and the called party has or has not invoked the COLR service.

#### 7.4.2.2 Outgoing Call Interworking from BICC/ISUP to SIP at O-MGCF
##### 7.4.2.2.1 IAM to INVITE interworking (ISUP to SIP calls)
The O-MGCF determines that the COLP service has been requested by the calling
party by parsing the \"Optional Forward Call Indicators\" field of the
incoming IAM. If the \"Connected Line Identity Request indicator\" is set to
\"requested\" then the BICC/ISUP to SIP interworking node shall ensure that
any backwards \"connected party\" information is interworked to the
appropriate parameters of the ISUP ANM or CON message sent backwards to the
calling party as detailed within this subclause.
The O-MGCF has to store the status of the \"Connected Line Identity Request
indicator\".
##### 7.4.2.2.2 1XX to ANM or CON interworking
If the P-Asserted-Identity header field is included within a 1XX SIP response,
the identity shall be stored within the O-MGCF together with information about
the SIP dialogue of the 1XX SIP response and shall be included within the ANM
or CON message if required by the procedures described in clause 7.4.2.2.3. In
accordance with ISUP procedures, a connected number shall not be included
within the ACM message. The mapping of the of the P-Asserted-Identity and
Privacy header fields is shown in tables 23 and 24.
##### 7.4.2.2.3 200 OK (INVITE) to ANM/CON interworking
Tables 23 and 24 specify the interworking required in the case when the
calling party has invoked the COLP service. The tables also indicate the
interworking procedures required if the calling party has invoked the COLP
service and the called party has or has not invoked the COLR service.
If no P-Asserted-Identity header field is provided within the 200 OK (INVITE)
message, the stored information previously received in the last provisional
1xx response of the same SIP dialogue shall be used.
NOTE: Due to forking, other P-Asserted-Identities might have been received in
different SIP dialogues.
If the Calling Party has requested the COLP service (as indicated by the
stored request status) but the 200 OK (INVITE) and previous 1XX provisional
responses do not include a P-Asserted-Identity header field, the O-MGCF shall
set up a network provided Connected Number with an Address not Available
indication.
If the P-Asserted-Identity is available then the Connected number has to be
setup with the screening indication network provided. The mapping of the
P-Asserted-Identity and Privacy (if available) is shown in table 24.

### 7.4.3 Direct Dialling In (DDI)
A direct dialling in call is a basic call and no additional treatment is
required by the MGCF.
### 7.4.4 Malicious call identification
The actions of the MGCF at the ISUP/BICC side are described in ITU-T
Recommendation Q.731.7 [42] under the clause \"Interactions with other
networks\".
### 7.4.5 Subaddressing (SUB)
### 7.4.5.1 General
The ISDN Subaddress in ISUP is transported within the Access Transport
Parameter. The Coding of the Subaddress parameter within the Access Transport
Parameter is described within ETSI EN 300 403‑1 [96]. The isdn-subaddress
parameter carried within a tel or sip URI is defined within RFC 3966 [97]. The
isdn-subaddress encoding type carried within a tel or sip URI is defined
within RFC 4715 [108].
### 7.4.5.2 Interworking at I-MGCF
The mapping in table 24ba of the isdn-subaddress parameter received within a
tel or sip URI to the ISUP Access Transport Parameter encapsulating the
Subaddress shall be applied.
The mapping in table 24bb of the Subaddress received within an ANM Message
containing the ISUP Access Transport Parameter to the isdn-subaddress of a tel
or sip URI to be sent within a 200 OK (INVITE) shall be applied.

### 7.4.6 Call Forwarding Busy (CFB)/ Call Forwarding No Reply (CFNR) / Call
Forwarding Unconditional (CFU) / Call Deflection (CD)
#### 7.4.6.1 General
A MGCF within an IMS network applying the Communication Diversion service uses
the procedures defined in clause 7.5.4.
This clause describes additional interworking of call forwarding service
information between a PSTN/PLMN network and an IMS network. This can also be
used when interworking between SIP networks (e.g., IMS network interworking
with enterprise networks making use of the History-Info header field with an
escaped Reason header field as described in IETF RFC 4244 [91]). The
procedures support the interworking of the diversion reason within the
History-Info header field using an escaped Reason header field defined by IETF
RFC 3326 [116] as described in IETF RFC 4244 [91] and also support the
diversion cause using the \"cause\" URI parameter as described by IETF RFC
4458 [113].
If the MGCF is supporting the interworking of Call Forwarding and also
applying the Communication Diversion services as defined by TS 24.604 [60], it
uses both IETF RFC 4244 [91] and IETF RFC 4458 [113] to signal the diversion
reason. An IMS network supporting the interworking of Call Forwarding and not
applying the IMS Communication Diversion supplementary service according to TS
24.604 [60] uses IETF RFC 4244 [91] and can also use IETF RFC 4458 [113] based
on network option.
When interworking the SIP History-Info header field to ISUP, and both the
diversion reason based on IETF RFC 4244 [91] and IETF RFC 4458 [113] are
present for the same diversion instance, the MGCF should use the \"cause\" URI
parameter per IETF RFC 4458 [113] for deriving the ISUP. When the \"cause\"
URI parameter per IETF RFC 4458 [113] is used, the corresponding interworking
as described in clause 7.5.4 shall be applied for that diversion instance.
Otherwise, the interworking as defined in the present clause should be
applied.
When interworking from ISUP to the History-Info header field, to signal the
diversion reason the MGCF should use the escaped Reason header field from IETF
RFC 4244 [91] and apply the interworking procedures in the present subclause.
The MGCF should also apply the interworking procedures described in clause
7.5.4 to use the \"cause\" URI parameter from IETF RFC 4458 [113] to signal
the diversion reason.
In the event that the interworking procedures described in this clause as well
as the interworking procedures in clause 7.5.4 are not applied, the actions of
the MGCF at the ISUP/BICC side as described in ITU-T Recommendation Q.732.2-5
[42] under the clause \"Interactions with networks not providing any call
diversion information\" may be applied as a network option.
#### 7.4.6.2 Interworking at the O-MGCF

This clause describes the optional mapping of Call Forwarding information at
the O-MGCF to the protocol-cause specified in IETF RFC 3326 [116].

The mapping described within table 7.4.6.2.2. 8 can only appear if the
communication has already undergone a **Communications diversion** in the IMS
and the 180 (Ringing) is the first provisional response sent in backward
direction.
The O-MGCF can indicate the call diversion information in the mapping of 180
(Ringing) provisional response to a CPG message in fact if the response before
was a 181 (Call Is Being Forwarded).

The mapping in table 7.4.6.2.2.9 appears when a 181 (Call Is Being Forwarded)
provisional response previously was mapped to an ACM. Therefore the state
machine of the O-MGCF knows that a CDIV is in progress.

##### 7.4.6.2.3 Interworking ISUP to SIP
For the interworking of 180 (Ringing) response and 200 (OK) response (to the
INVITE request) to the regarding ISUP messages and parameters no additional
procedures beyond the basic call procedures are needed.
To interwork the redirecting number at the O-MGCF it can be needed to create
placeholder History-Info hi-entries. Such a History-Info hi-entry has to
provide a hi-targeted-to-uri with a placeholder value
\"unknown\@unknown.invalid\", a Reason \"headers\" component with a cause
parameter and a hi-index as described within table 7.4.6.2.3.1.

### 7.4.9 Call Waiting
The actions of the MGCF at the ISUP/BICC side are described in ITU-T Q.733.1
[42] under the clause \"Interactions with other networks\".
### 7.4.10 Call Hold
The service is interworked as indicated in TS 23.228 [12].
#### 7.4.10.1 Session hold initiated from the IM CN subsystem side
The IMS network makes a hold request by sending an UPDATE or re-INVITE message
with an \"inactive\" or a \"sendonly\" SDP attribute (refer to RFC 3264 [36]),
depending on the current state of the session. Upon receipt of the hold
request from the IMS side, the MGCF shall send a CPG message to the CS side
with a \"_remote hold\"_ _Generic notification indicator_. To resume the
session, the IMS side sends an UPDATE or re-INVITE message with a \"recvonly\"
or \"sendrecv\" SDP attribute, depending on the current state of the session.
Upon receipt of the resume request from the IMS side, the MGCF shall send a
CPG message to the CS side with a \"_remove retrieval\" Generic notification
indicator_. However, the I-MGCF shall not send a CPG message upon reception of
SDP containing \"inactive\" media within an initial INVITE request
establishing a new SIP dialogue and upon reception of the first subsequent SDP
activating those media.
The user plane interworking of the hold/resume request is described in the
clause 9.2.9.
Figure 30a: Session hold/resume initiated from the IM CN subsystem side
#### 7.4.10.2 Session hold initiated from the CS network side
If an MGCF receives a CPG message with \"remote hold\" and there is no dialog
established towards the UE the MGCF shall send an UPDATE or re-INVITE request
containing an SDP offer with \"_sendonly_ \" or \"_inactive_ \" media, as
described in IETF RFC 3264 [36], when the first dialog is established. For an
early dialog only UPDATE shall be used.
When an MGCF receives a CPG message with a \"_remote hold\"_ Generic
notification indicator and the media on the IMS side are \"_sendrecv_ \" or
\"_recvonly_ \", the MGCF shall forward the hold request by sending an UPDATE
request on the early dialog which was last established containing an SDP offer
with \"_sendonly_ \" if the stream was previously \"_sendrecv_ \" or
\"_inactive_ \" if the stream was previously \"_recvonly_ \" media, as
described in IETF RFC 3264 [36].
If an additional early dialog is established during the \"_remote hold_ \"
condition the MGCF shall send an UPDATE request containing an SDP offer with
\"_sendonly_ \" or \"_inactive_ \" media on the new early dialog, as described
in IETF RFC 3264 [36].
If an UPDATE request with an SDP offer is received on one of the early dialogs
for a call in the \"_remote hold_ \" condition the MGCF shall send an
appropriate SDP answer followed by a new UPDATE request including SDP with
\"_sendonly_ \" or \"_inactive_ \" media on the dialog , as described in IETF
RFC 3264 [36].
If an MGCF receives a 200 OK (INVITE) response on an early dialog for which
the call is in a \"_remote hold_ \" condition the MGCF shall send an UPDATE or
re-INVITE request containing an SDP offer with \"_sendonly_ \" or \"_inactive_
\" media on the dialog where 200 OK (INVITE) was received, as described in
IETF RFC 3264 [36].
If the MGCF receives a CPG with Generic Notification Indicator \"_remote
retrieval_ \" and there is an early dialog on IMS side then a SIP UPDATE
request (indicating call retrieval) shall be sent if the call hold service had
been invoked on the early dialog before. For each subsequent early dialog for
which the MGCF receives an 18x response or an UPDATE request with an SDP
offer, the MGCF shall send SIP UPDATE indicating call retrieval after a
possible SDP answer to the SDP offer, if that dialog had received a call hold
indication before.
If the MGCF receives a CPG with Generic Notification Indicator \"_remote
retrieval_ \" and there is a confirmed dialog on IMS side then a SIP re-INVITE
or UPDATE request (according to implementation option) shall be sent for this
dialog only if the call hold service had been invoked for this dialog before.
When an MGCF receives a CPG message with a \"_remote retrieval_ \" Generic
notification indicator and the media on the IMS side are \"_sendonly_ \" or
\"_inactive_ \", the MGCF shall forward the resume request by sending an
UPDATE or re-INVITE message containing an SDP offer with \"_sendrecv_ \" if
the stream was previously \"_sendonly_ \" or \"_recvonly_ \" if the stream was
previously \"_inactive_ \" media, as described in IETF RFC 3264 [36].
If the MGCF receives a CPG with \"_remote hold_ \" or \"_remote retrieval_ \"
before answer, it shall forward the request using an UPDATE message. If the
MGCF receives a CPG with \"_remote hold_ \" or \"_remote retrieval_ \" after
answer, it should forward the request using re-INVITE but may use UPDATE.
If link aliveness information is required at the IM-MGW while the media are on
hold, the O-MGCF should provide modified SDP RR and RS bandwidth modifiers
specified in IETF RFC 3556 [59] within the UPDATE or re-INVITE messages
holding and retrieving the media to temporarily enable RTCP while the media
are on hold, as detailed in clause 7.4 of TS 26.236 [32]. If no link aliveness
information is required at the IM-MGW, the O-MGCF should provide the SDP RR
and RS bandwidth modifiers previously used.
The interworking does not impact the user plane, unless the MGCF provides
modified SDP RR and RS bandwidth modifiers within the UPDATE or re-INVITE
messages. If the MGCF provides modified SDP RR and RS bandwidth modifiers to
the IMS side, the MGCF shall also provide modified SDP RR and RS bandwidths to
the IM-MGW, as described in the clause 9.2.10.

available. As per TS 24.608 [64] the presence of \"from-change\" tag is not a
criterion for TIP service.
If a provisional or final response including the option tag \"from-change\" is
received, then the O-MGCF shall:
\- if a 200 (OK) response to the INVITE request is received, start timer
T~TIR1~; and
\- store the 200 (OK) response, without interworking it.
Otherwise the 200 (OK) response (to the INVITE request) shall be mapped as
described in clause 7.2.3.2.7a.
If an UPDATE request is received containing a changed From header field before
the timer TTIR1 expired, then the O‑MGCF shall:
\- stop timer T~TIR1;~
\- map the From header field received in the UPDATE request to the Generic
number in the ANM as shown in table 7.5.2.2.2 and table 7.5.2.2.3;
\- if the UPDATE request includes a P-Asserted-Identity header field that is
different from the one within the stored 200 (OK) response, the latest
received P-Asserted-Identity header field shall be mapped to the connected
number as described table 24; and
\- map the parameters needed to be mapped of the stored 200 (OK) response to
an ANM as described in clause 7.4.2.2.3, modified by the changed mapping steps
of the From and P-Asserted-Identity header fields.
When T~TIR1~ expires, then the stored 200 (OK) response (to the INVITE
request) response shall be mapped as described in clause 7.4.2.2.3.

For the mapping of INVITE request to IAM:
\- the bit H _Connected line identity request indicator_ of the Optional
forward call indicators parameter in the IAM shall be set to \"requested\".
Table 7.5.2.3.1: Void
If a received ISUP ANM includes an ISUP Generic Number (\"additional connected
number\") parameter, then the\ I-MGCF shall send a 200 (OK) response (to the
INVITE request) including an option tag \"from-change\" If the initial INVITE
was received and the Supported header field contains the \"from-change\" tag,
the 200 (OK) response is followed by an UPDATE request, containing the
\"additional connected number\" copied into the From header field as shown in
table 7.5.2.3.2.
The To header field of the UPDATE request is derived from the P-Asserted-

### 7.5.4 Communication Diversion (CDIV)
#### 7.5.4.1 General
The protocol specification of the Communication Diversion supplementary
service is described in TS 24.604 [60]. The mapping of Communication Diversion
supplementary service with Call Diversion services PSTN/ISDN supplementary
service including the mapping of the optional History-Info header field as
defined in IETF RFC 4244 [91] is described.
In case of interworking with networks which do not provide any notification of
the communication diversion or communication redirection information (e.g.
redirection counter) in the signalling system, the communication continues
according to the basic call procedures.
#### 7.5.4.2 Interworking at the O-MGCF
##### 7.5.4.2.1 General
For the mapping of IAM to the INVITE request no additional procedures beyond
the basic call and interworking procedures are needed unless Call forwarding
within the ISUP Network appeared.
With regard to the backward messages the following mapping is valid.

The mapping described within table 7.5.4.2.1.8 can only appear if the
communication has already undergone a Call Forwarding in the ISDN/PSTN and the
180 is the first provisional response sent in backward direction.
The IWU can indicate the call diversion in the mapping of 180 (Ringing) to CPG
in fact if the response before was a 181 (Call is being forwarded).

The mapping in table 7.5.4.2.1.9 appears when a 181 previously was mapped to
an ACM. Therefore the state machine of the MGCF knows that a CDIV is in
Progress.

##### 7.5.4.2.2 Call forwarding within the ISUP Network appeared
The following scenario shows if a Call Forwarding appears in the ISUP/PSTN and
the diverted-to number is within the SIP network. Table 7.5.4.2.2.1 should be
seen as an example.
For the mapping of 180 (Ringing) response and 200 (OK) response to the
regarding ISUP messages and parameters no additional procedures beyond the
basic call procedures are needed.
To interwork the redirecting number at the O-MGCF it can be needed to create
placeholder History entries. Such a History entry has to provide a hi-
targeted-to-uri with a placeholder value \"unknown\@unknown.invalid\", a

### 7.5.5 Communication Hold (HOLD)
The mapping of Communication Hold supplementary service with Call Hold
PSTN/ISDN Supplementary Service is the same mapping as described in clause
7.4.10. The Service itself is described within TS 24.610 [65].
### 7.5.6 Conference call (CONF)
#### 7.5.6.1 General
The protocol description of the CONF supplementary service is described in TS
24.605 [61]. In this clause the interworking from the conference event package
RFC 4575 [100] to the messages of the PSTN/ISDN CONF supplementary service is
described. Note that an interworking from the PSTN/ISDN to the IMS is out of
scope.
#### 7.5.6.2 Subscribing for the conference event package
Based on local policy, the MGCF may subscribe for the conference event package
on behalf of the PSTN/ISDN participant after the participant joins or is added
to a conference.
When the conference event package option is implemented, and one of the
following events occurs at the MGCF:
\- a 200 (OK) response is received as a response to an initial INVITE request
originated by the MGCF, where the Contact header field contains an \"isfocus\"
parameter; or
\- an ACK message is received which acknowledges a 200 (OK) response to the
initial INVITE request, and the initial INVITE request is originated by the
conferencing AS and contains an \"isfocus\" parameter in the Contact header
field;
then the following steps shall be performed:
1) a SUBSCRIBE request shall be created according to RFC 4575 [100];
2) the Request URI is set to the Contact address of the conferencing AS;
3) the P-Asserted-Identity header field, the From header field and the Privacy
header field are set with the same value as:
\- the P-Asserted-Identity header field, the From header field and the Privacy
header field in the initial INVITE request originated by the MGCF; or
\- the P-Asserted-Identity header field, the To header field and the Privacy
header field in a 1xx or 2xx response sent by the MGCF to the initial INVITE
request from the conferencing AS.
#### 7.5.6.3 Interworking the notification
NOTE: There is a need to differentiate between the procedures of interworking
for a full and a partial type of notification.
When a full type of notification is received a check is made of the content.
If the changes with respect a previous version of the notification have not
been sent on to the PSTN/ISDN for this session, the MGCF shall perform an ISUP
interaction towards the PSTN/ISDN. If the changes with respect a previous
version of the notification have been sent to the PSTN/ISDN for this session,
the MGCF shall not perform an ISUP interaction towards the PSTN/ISDN.
When a partial notification is received then it is assumed that a value of a
received notification has changed, so the MGCF performs an ISUP interaction
towards the PSTN/ISDN, as follows:
\- Conference established:
Upon the receipt of a conference information document with the \ element _active_ is set to \"true\", the MGCF shall send a CPG
message to the PSTN/ISDN with a notification \"_conference established_ \".
\- Participant added:
Upon the receipt of a conference information document with the \ and the element _status of endpoint‑status-type_ is set to \"connected\"
and it was not set to \"on-hold\" before and the Contact URI in the element
_entity_ is not the address of the served PSTN/ISDN participant, the MGCF
shall send a CPG message to the PSTN/ISDN with a notification \"_other party
added_ \".
\- Served PSTN/ISDN participant isolated:
Upon the receipt of a conference information document with the \ and the element _status of endpoint‑status-type_ is set to \"on-hold\"
and it was set to \"connected\" before and the Contact URI in the element
_entity_ is the address of the served PSTN/ISDN participant, the MGCF shall
send a CPG message to the PSTN/ISDN with a notification \"_isolated_ \".
\- Other participant isolated:
Upon the receipt of a conference information document with the \ and the element _status of endpoint‑status-type_ is set to \"on-hold\"
and it was set to \"connected\" before and the Contact URI in the element
_entity_ is not the address of the served PSTN/ISDN participant, the MGCF
shall send a CPG message to the PSTN/ISDN with a notification \"_other party
isolated_ \".
\- Served PSTN/ISDN participant reattached:
Upon the receipt of a conference information document with the \ and the element _status of endpoint‑status-type_ is set to \"connected\"
and it was set to \"on-hold\" before and the Contact URI in the element
_entity_ is the address of the served PSTN/ISDN participant, the MGCF shall
send a CPG message to the PSTN/ISDN with a notification \"_reattached_ \".
\- Other participant reattached:
Upon the receipt of a conference information document with the \ and the element _status of endpoint‑status-type_ is set to \"connected\"
and it was set to \"on-hold\" before and the Contact URI in the element
_entity_ is not the address of the served PSTN/ISDN participant, the MGCF
shall send a CPG message to the PSTN/ISDN with a notification \"_other party
reattached_ \".
\- Other party disconnected:
Upon the receipt of a conference information document with the \ and the element _status of endpoint‑status-type_ is set to
\"disconnected\" and the element _joining-method of joining-type_ is not set
to \"focus-owner\", the MGCF shall send a CPG message to the PSTN/ISDN with a
notification \"_other party disconnected_ \".

### 7.5.13 Customized Alerting Tones (CAT)
#### 7.5.13.1 General
The Customized Alerting Tones supplementary service is described in TS 24.182
[132].
The interworking procedures in this clause enable the transport of customized
alerting tones provided by an AS in the IM CN subsystem towards a caller in a
CS network.
Based on operator options, one of three different models described in TS
24.182 [132].is used in an IM CN subsystem to provide the CAT service. The CAT
interworking procedures at the O-MGCF differ between these models and are
described seperately for each model in the subsequent clauses. Support of the
interworking procedures for each of those models is optional.
I-MGCF procedures are not affected.
#### 7.5.13.2 Early session model

When CAT service is provided by using early session model as specificed in TS
24.182 [132], and if the O-MGCF supports early-sesssion as a network option,
then it shall include the option tag \"early-session\", as defined in IETF RFC
3959 [131], in Supported header field in each outgoing initial SIP INVITE
request.
After receiving the first SIP 18x response including an early-session SDP,
then the O-MGCF shall send the address complete message (ACM) or Call Progress
message (CPG) with the Optional backward call indicators parameter set to
\"in-band information or an appropriate pattern is now available\". If the SIP
18x response is the SIP 180 Ringing response, then additionally the Called
party\'s status indicator in the ACM message shall be set to \"subscriber
free\" or the Event information in the CPG message shall be set to
\"ALERTING\".
If the O-MGCF applies codec interworking procedures according to Annex B, it
shall interwork the \"session\" disposition SDP (rather than the \"early
session\" disposition SDP).
##### 7.5.13.2.2 MGCF -- IM-MGW Interaction for CAT service
##### 7.5.13.2.2.1 General {#general-28 .H6}

port. The MGCF shall indicate the local codec(s) if a change is required.
\- The MGCF may indicate that IP interface type is for MboIP.
The IM-MGW shall reply with the selected remote codec(s) and reserve resources
for these codec(s). If local codec(s) were received, the IM-MGW shall also
reply with the selected local codec(s) and reserve the corresponding
resources.
The MCGF shall send the local codec(s), UDP port and IP address in the early-

# 8 User plane interworking
## 8.1 Interworking between IM CN subsystem and bearer independent CS network
When the IM CN subsystem interworks with the bearer independent CS networks
(e.g. CS domain of a PLMN, TS 29.414 [25], TS 29.415 [26], TS 23.205 [27]),
the Transport Network Layer (TNL) of the bearer independent CS network can be
based e.g. on IP/UDP/RTP, or IP/UDP/RTP/IuFP, or ATM/AAL2/ framing protocol
(e.g. Iu framing) transport techniques. Figure 31 shows the user plane
protocol stacks for the IM CS subsystem and bearer independent CS network
interworking. If the same AMR configuration is used on the CS network side as
on the IMS side, transcoding is not required. However, there is still a need
to interwork between RTP/UDP/IP/L2/LI to TNL/LI.
Figure 31/1: IM CN subsystem to bearer independent CS network user plane
protocol stack
### 8.1.1 Transcoder-less Mb to Nb Interworking
Figure 31/2: IM CN subsystem to bearer independent CS network user plane
protocol stack (optional in the event the codecs on both sides are the same)
If no transcoder is inserted, the IM-MGW shall interwork the following
procedures between the Nb and Mb interfaces.
#### 8.1.1.1 Initialisation
There is no need to interwork initialisation procedures between Nb and Mb
interfaces see TS 29.415 [26].
#### 8.1.1.2 Time alignment
The purpose of the time alignment procedure on the Nb interface is to minimise
the buffer delay in the RNC for downlink transmissions by adjusting the
vocoder time reference within the network. No such procedure exists on the Mb
interface, so the IM-MGW shall return NACK indication time alignment not
supported according to TS 29.415 [26].
#### 8.1.1.3 Rate control
The rate control procedure signals to the peer entity the maximum rate among
the currently allowed rates at which it can receive codec frames. Rate control
only applies to AMR family codec configurations with multiple active modes. On
the Nb interface, IuFP provides for rate control via the exchange of RATE
CONTROL and RATE CONTROL ACK PDUs. On the Mb interface, IETF RFC 4867 [23]
provides for in-band rate control via the Codec Mode Request (CMR) field of
every codec frame.
Interworking of rate control procedures at an IM-MGW between an Mb interface
and a corresponding Nb interface only applies when the IM-MGW bridges
compatible codec configurations between the interfaces without applying a
transcoding function. An IM-MGW receiving a CMR from an Mb interface shall
initiate the IuFP rate control procedure on the corresponding Nb interface. An
IM-MGW receiving a rate control request on an Nb interface shall adjust the
CMR field of outgoing speech frames on the corresponding Mb interface.
A IM-MGW may support the MTSI service defined in TS 24.173 [88] and may then
support codecs according to TS 26.114 [104].
NOTE 1: Alternative codec specifications for the MTSI service are listed in TS
24.173 [88].
If the IM-MGW supports the MTSI service with the codecs according to TS 26.114
[104] the IM-MGW should support reception of RTCP-APP-CMR messages as
specified in the clause 10.2.1 of TS 26.114 [104] which can be sent by a MTSI
client in the terminal. If the IM-MGW is in TrFO then RTCP-APP-CMR messages
should be translated to the appropriate rate control method on the CS side
(e.g. IuFP rate control or RTP based CMR) in the same way as for an RTP based
CMR, described in the preceding paragraph.
NOTE 2: When the IM-MGW is transcoding at the Mb interface then any RTCP-APP-
CMR requests received from the MTSI client in the terminal when the IM-MGW is
transcoding will result in a change to to DL codec mode towards the MTSI
client terminal.
#### 8.1.1.4 Frame quality indication
The Nb interface signals frame quality with the Frame Quality Classification
(FQC) field of each speech frame PDU. See TS 26.102 [50] and TS 29.415 [26]
for details. The FQC may have possible values: 0=frame_good; 1=frame_bad;
2=frame_bad_due_to_radio; and 3=spare. The Mb interface signals frame quality
with the Q bit (frame quality indicator) field of each speech frame, as
defined in IETF RFC 4867 [23]. The Q bit may have values: 1=speech_good; and
0=speech_bad or sid_bad.
Tables 24a and 24b provide the mapping between Mb and Nb interfaces.
Table 24a: Mapping of Mb (Q bit) onto Nb (FQC)
* * *
Mb - Qbit Mb - FT Nb - FQC 1 X 0 0 X 1
* * *
Table 24b: Mapping Nb onto Mb
* * *
Nb - FQC Mb - Qbit Mb -- FT 0 1 NC 1 0 NO_DATA 2 0 NC
* * *
#### 8.1.1.5 Framing
Even when the IM-MGW bridges compatible codec configurations between the Nb
and Mb interfaces, the IM-MGW shall perform translation between the frame
formats defined for the two interfaces, since all codec configurations have
different framing procedures for the two interfaces. The framing details for
Nb are defined in TS 26.102 [50] and TS 29.415 [26], although they do not
describe the framing for ITU-T codecs other than G.711. The framing details
for Mb are defined in IETF RFC 4867 [23], IETF RFC 3550 [51], IETF RFC 3551
[52] and IETF RFC 3555 [53].
#### 8.1.1.6 Transcoding
Transcoding at the IM-MGW is avoided when the IM-MGW bridges compatible codec
configurations between the Nb and Mb interfaces. Otherwise transcoding is
necessary, which eliminates the need to interwork other user plane procedures
between the interfaces.
#### 8.1.1.7 Discontinuous transmission
When the IM-MGW bridges compatible codec configurations between the Nb and Mb
interfaces, the DTX procedures are normally interworked transparently by
translating between the framing formats on the interfaces. All the ITU-T and
AMR family codecs have configurations that are compatible between the Mb and
Nb interfaces.
#### 8.1.1.8 Timing and sequence information
The IM-MGW shall always correct out-of-sequence delivery between Nb and Mb
interfaces, either by re-ordering frames, or by dropping frames that are out
of sequence.
When the IuFP frame numbers are based on time and if the IM-MGW bridges
compatible codec configurations between the Nb and Mb interfaces, it shall
either correct jitter before forwarding PDUs or interwork the RTP timestamp
(see RFC 3550 [51]) with the IuFP Frame Number (see TS 29.415 [26]) so that
both the RTP timestamp and IuFP frame number similarly reflect the nominal
sampling instant of the user data in the packet.
NOTE: Correcting jitter may cause additional delay.
The RTP sequence number (see RFC 3550 [51]) is handled independently on Mb,
i.e. it is not interworked with the IuFP Frame Number (see TS 29.415 [26]).
## 8.2 Interworking between IM CN subsystem and TDM-based CS network
It shall be possible for the IM CN subsystem to interwork with the TDM based
CS networks (e.g. PSTN, ISDN or CS domain of a PLMN). Figure 32 describes the
user plane protocol stack to provide the particular interworking.
Figure 32: IM CN subsystem to TDM-based CS network user plane protocol stack
## 8.3 Transcoding requirements
The IM CN subsystem supports the AMR codec as the native codec for basic voice
services. For IM CN subsystem terminations, the IM MGW shall support the
transport of AMR over RTP according to IETF RFC 4867 [23]. The MGCF shall
support the options of IETF RFC 4867 [23] listed within clause 5.1.1 of TS
26.236 [32].
It shall be possible for the IM CN subsystem to interwork with the CS networks
(e.g. PSTN, ISDN or a CS domain of a PLMN) by supporting AMR to G.711
transcoding (see ITU-T Recommendation G.711 [1]) in the IM-MGW. The IM-MGW may
also perform transcoding between AMR and other codec types supported by CS
networks.
## 8.4 Diffserv code point requirements
The IM-MGW shall perform DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) markings (see RFC 2474
[21]) on the IP packets sent towards the IM CN subsystem entity like UE or
MRFP across the Mb interface to allow DiffServ compliant routers and GGSNs to
schedule the traffic accordingly.
The IETF Differentiated Services architecture (see RFC 2475 [22]) shall be
used to provide QoS for the external bearer service.
The DSCP shall be operator configurable.
## 8.5 DTMF handling
When sending DTMF inband towards the CS network, the MGW shall comply with the
encoding requirements in TS 23.014 [103]; in particular the requirements for
the minimum length of a tone and for the minimum gap between two subsequent
tones shall be ensured.
When detecting DTMF digits arriving from the CS side, the MGW shall comply
with TS 23.014 [103] (by checking that a valid digit with minimum duration and
minimum gap has been received) before initiating an RTP Telephony Event to the
IMS interface.
When sending DTMF towards the IMS side according to the IETF RFC 4733 [105]
RTP Payload format, the MGW shall comply with the DTMF encoding requirements
of Annex G.2 of TS 26.114 [104], in particular the minimum duration of 65ms
shall be ensured. It is optional if the RTP Telephony Event is sent as a
number of \"RTP Events\" with interim durations (e.g. every 20ms or 40ms in
line with the speech packetisation time) or as a single \"RTP Event\" with the
at least 65ms duration.
# 9 MGCF -- IM-MGW Interaction
## 9.1 Overview
The MGCF shall control the functions of the IM-MGW, which are used to provide
the connection between media streams of an IP based transport network and
bearer channels from a CS network.
The MGCF shall interact with the IM-MGW across the Mn reference point. The
MGCF shall terminate the signalling across the Mn interface towards the IM-MGW
and the IM-MGW shall terminate the signalling from the MGCF.
The signalling interface across the Mn reference point shall be defined in
accordance with ITU-T Recommendation H.248.1 [2] and shall conform to 3GPP
specific extensions as detailed in TS 29.332 [15].
The present specification describes Mn signalling procedures and their
interaction with BICC/ISUP and SIP signalling in the control plane, and with
user plane procedures. TS 29.332 [15] maps these signalling procedures to
H.248 messages and defines the required packages and parameters.
## 9.2 Mn signalling interactions
The following paragraphs describe the Mn interface procedures triggered by SIP
and BICC signalling relayed in MGCF.
The SIP signalling occurring at the MGCF is described in TS 24.229 [9].
All message sequence charts in this clause are examples.
### 9.2.1 Network model
Figure 33 shows the network model, applicable to BICC and ISUP cases. The
broken line represents the call control signalling. The dotted line represents
the bearer control signalling (if applicable) and the user plane. The MGCF
uses one context with two terminations in the IM-MGW. The termination T1 is
used towards the IM CN subsystem entity and the bearer termination T2 is used
for the bearer towards the succeeding CS network element.
Figure 33: Network model
### 9.2.2 Basic IM CN subsystem originated session
#### 9.2.2.1 BICC forward bearer establishment
##### 9.2.2.1.1 IM-MGW selection
The MGCF shall select an IM-MGW for the bearer connection before it performs
the CS network side bearer establishment. This may happen either before
sending the IAM or after receiving the APM message (signal 5 or signal 6 in
figure 34). In the latter case, the IM-MGW selection may be based on a
possibly received MGW-id from the succeeding node.
##### 9.2.2.1.2 CS network side bearer establishment
The MGCF shall either select bearer characteristics or request the IM-MGW to
select and provide the bearer characteristics for the CS network side bearer
connection before sending the IAM. In the latter case the MGCF shall use the
Prepare Bearer procedure, not shown in figure 34, to request the IM-MGW to
select the bearer characteristics. After the succeeding node has provided a
bearer address and a binding reference in the APM, the MGCF shall use the
Establish Bearer procedure to request the IM-MGW to establish a bearer towards
the destination CS-MGW. The MGCF shall provide the IM-MGW with the bearer
address, the binding reference and the bearer characteristics (signal 7 in
figure 34).
##### 9.2.2.1.3 IM CN subsystem side termination reservation
On receipt of an initial INVITE (signal 1 in figure 34) the MGCF shall
initiate the Reserve IMS Connection Point and Configure Remote Resources
procedure (signal 3 and 4 in figure 34). From the received SDP and local
configuration data the MGCF:
\- Shall send the appropriate remote codec(s), the remote UDP port and the
remote IP address to the IM-MGW. The remote UDP port and IP address refer to
the destination of user plane data sent towards the IM CN subsystem. The
remote codec(s) are the codec(s) the IM-MGW may select for user plane data
sent towards the IM CN subsystem.
\- Shall indicate to the IM-MGW the appropriate local codec(s) and request a
local IP address and UDP port. The local IP address and UDP port are used by
the IM-MGW to receive user plane data from the IM CN subsystem. The local
codec(s) are the codec(s) the IM-MGW may select to receive user plane data
from the IM CN subsystem.
\- If DTMF support together with speech support is required, the reserve value
indicator shall be set to \"true\".
\- May indicate that IP interface type is for MboIP.
The IM-MGW
\- Shall reply to the MGCF with the selected local codec(s) and the selected
remote codec(s) and the selected local UDP port and IP address.
\- Shall reserve resources for those codec(s).
The MCGF shall send the local codec(s), UDP port and IP address to the IMS in
the Session Progress (signal 9 in figure 34).
##### 9.2.2.1.4 IM CN subsystem side session establishment
Dependent on what the MGCF receives in the PRACK message (signal 10 in figure
34), the MGCF may initiate the Configure IMS Resources procedure. If no SDP is
received, or if the received SDP does not contain relevant changes compared to
the previous SDP sent to the IMS in signal 9 in figure 34, the procedure is
not invoked. Otherwise the MGCF shall use the Configure IMS Resources
procedure to provide to the IM-MGW:
\- The appropriate remote codec(s), the remote UDP port and the remote IP
address.
\- Optionally the appropriate local codec(s), UDP port and IP address.
\- If DTMF support together with speech support is required, the reserve value
indicator shall be set to \"true\".
\- May indicate that IP interface type is for MboIP.
The IM-MGW shall:
\- Reply to the MGCF with the selected remote codec(s),
\- Reply to the MGCF with the selected local codec(s)if the MGCF supplied
local codec(s),
\- Update the codec reservation and remote IP address and remote UDP port in
accordance with the received information.
The MGCF shall include the selected codec(s) and UDP port and IP address in a
200 OK (PRACK) (signal 11 in figure 34) sent back to the IMS.
##### 9.2.2.1.5 Through-connection
During the Prepare Bearer and Establish Bearer procedures, the MGCF shall
either use the Change Through-Connection procedure to request the IM-MGW to
backward through-connect the BICC terminations, or the MGCF shall use this
procedure to both-way through-connect the BICC termination already on this
stage (signal 7 in figure 34). During the Reserve IMS Connection Point
procedure, the MGCF shall use the Change IMS Through-Connection procedure to
request the IM-MGW to backward through-connect the IMS termination (signal 3
in figure 34).
When the MGCF receives the BICC:ANM answer indication, it shall request the
IM-MGW to both-way through-connect the termination using the Change Through-
Connection or Change IMS Through-Connection procedures (signal 22 in figure
34), unless those terminations are already both-way through-connected.
##### 9.2.2.1.6 Codec handling
The IM-MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each termination.
##### 9.2.2.1.7 Failure handling in MGCF
If any procedure between the MGCF and the IM-MGW is not completed successfully
the default action by the MGCF is to release the session, as described in
clause 9.2.6. If the MGCF receives a Bearer Released procedure from the IM-MGW
the default action by the MGCF is to release the session as described in
clause 9.2.7.
NOTE: As an implementation option the MGCF may also decide for example to only
release the resources in the IM-MGW that caused the failure, possibly select a
new IM-MGW for the connection and continue the call establishment using new
resources in the selected IM-MGW but such handling is outside of the scope of
the present document.
##### 9.2.2.1.8 Message sequence chart
Figure 34 shows the message sequence chart for the IM CN subsystem originating
session with BICC forward bearer establishment where the selection of IM-MGW
is done before the sending of the IAM. In the chart the MGCF requests the
seizure of an IM CN subsystem side termination. When the APM is received from
the succeeding node, the MGCF requests the seizure of a CS network side bearer
termination and the establishment of the bearer. When the MGCF receives an
answer indication, it requests the IM-MGW to both-way through-connect the
terminations. Dashed lines represent optional or conditional messages.
Figure 34: Basic IM CN Subsystem originating session, BICC forward bearer
establishment\ (message sequence chart)
#### 9.2.2.2 BICC backward bearer establishment
##### 9.2.2.2.1 IM-MGW selection
The MGCF shall select an IM-MGW for the bearer connection before it performs
the IM CN subsystem session establishment or the CS network side bearer
establishment, and before it sends the IAM (signal 8 in figure 35).
##### 9.2.2.2.2 IM CN subsystem side termination reservation
On receipt of an initial INVITE (signal 1in figure 35) the MGCF shall initiate
the Reserve IMS Connection Point and Configure Remote Resources procedure
(signal 3 and 4 in figure 35). From the received SDP and local configuration
data the MGCF:
\- Shall send the appropriate remote codec(s), the remote UDP port and the
remote IP address to the IM-MGW. The remote UDP port and IP address refer to
the destination of user plane data sent towards the IM CN subsystem. The
remote codec(s) are the codec(s) the IM-MGW may select for user plane data
sent towards the IM CN subsystem.
\- Shall indicate to the IM-MGW the appropriate local codec(s) and request a
local IP address and UDP port. The local UDP port and IP address are used by
the IM-MGW to receive user plane data from the IM CN subsystem. The local
codec(s) are the codec(s) the IM-MGW may select to receive user plane data
from the IM CN subsystem.
\- If DTMF support together with speech support is required, the reserve value
indicator shall be set to \"true\".
\- May indicate that IP interface type is for MboIP.
The IM-MGW shall
\- Reply to the MGCF with the selected local codec(s) and the selected remote
codec(s) and the selected local UDP port and IP address.
\- Reserve resources for those codec(s).
The MCGF shall send the local codec(s), UDP port and IP address to the IMS in
the Session Progress (signal 5 in figure 35).
##### 9.2.2.2.3 IM CN subsystem side session establishment
Dependent on what the MGCF receives in the PRACK message (signal 9 in figure
35) the MGCF may initiate the Select Configure IMS Resources procedure

subsystem side termination and CS network side bearer termination. When the
MGCF receives an answer indication, it requests the IM-MGW to both-way
through-connect the terminations. The MGCF may request the possible activation
of the voice processing functions for the terminations. Dashed lines represent
optional or conditional messages.

#### 9.2.3.4 Handling of Forking
The procedures described in clauses 9.2.3.1 to 9.2.3.3 shall be applied with
the following additions.
##### 9.2.3.4.1 Detection of Forking
According to SIP procedures, the O-MGCF inspects the tags in the \"to\" SIP
header fields of provisional and final responses to identify the SIP dialogue
the response belongs to. If responses belonging to different dialogues are
received (signals 8 and 13 in figure 39a), the INVITE request (signal 6 in
figure 39a) has been forked.
##### 9.2.3.4.2 IM CN subsystem side session establishment
If SDP is received in a provisional response and more than one SIP dialogue
exists (signal 13 in figure 39a), the MGCF may either refrain from
reconfiguring the IM-MGW, or it may use the Configure IMS Resources procedure
(signals 14 and 15 in figure 39a) as detailed below:
\- If the MGCF receives a SIP provisional response containing a P-Early-Media
header field that authorizes early media, the MGCF shall provide the remote IP
address and UDP port, and the remote codec selected from the received SDP and
local configuration data, corresponding to the SIP dialogue of the SIP
provisional response containing a P-Early-Media header field that authorizes
early media. The IM-MGW may be configured to use the remote IP address and
port information as source filter for incoming packages to prevent that early
media from other early SIP dialogues interfere. The MGCF may also provide an
IP address and port source filter that disallows early media from other early
dialogues without an early media authorization in order to prevent that such
unauthorized early media interfere with the authorized early media. (NOTE 1,
NOTE 2)
\- If the MGCF did not receive any SIP provisional response containing a
P-Early-Media header field that authorizes early media, the MGCF may compare
the selected local codecs of the different dialogues (which the MGCF selects
due to the received SDP answer and local configuration data). If different
local codecs are selected for the different dialogues, the MGCF may include
all these codecs in the \"local IMS resources\", and set the \"reserve value\"
to indicate that resources for all these codecs shall be reserved.
Alternatively, the MGCF may only include the codecs received in the last SDP
in the \"local IMS resources\".
\- If the MGCF did not receive any SIP provisional response containing a
P-Early-Media header field that authorizes early media, the MGCF may update
the \"remote IMS resources\" with the information received in the latest SDP.
The MGCF should provide the remote IP address and UDP port, and the remote
codec selected from the received SDP and local configuration data. (NOTE 3)
NOTE 1: The O-MGCF can use the P-Early-Media header field (IETF RFC 5009 [89])
to determine whether the media associated with a forked dialog is authorized
and thus eligible for a through connection. In the presence of early media for
multiple dialogs due to forking, if the IM-MGW is able to identify the media
associated with a dialog (i.e., if symmetric RTP is used by the peer and the
IM-MGW can use the remote SDP information to determine the source of the
media), then the O-MGCF/IM-MGW can selectively establish a through-connection
for an authorized early media flow.
NOTE 2: The behaviour of an O-MGCF upon the possible reception of SIP
provisional responses containing P-Early-Media header fields that authorize
early media for several early dialogues is left unspecified.
NOTE 3: The behaviour in the third bullet is beneficial if forking is applied
in a sequential manner.
##### 9.2.3.4.3 IM CN subsystem side session establishment completion
Upon reception of the first final 2xx response (signal 32 in figure 39a), the
MGCF shall use the Configure IMS Resources procedure (signals 35 and 36 in
figure 39a) as detailed below unless the IM-MGW is already configured
accordingly:
\- If the remote IMS resources configured at the IM-MGW do not match the
remote resources selected for the established dialogue of the final response,
the MGCF shall provide the remote IP address and UDP port from the latest
received SDP of this established dialogue, and the remote codec selected from
the latest received SDP of this established dialogue and local configuration
data within the \"remote IMS resources\".
\- If the local IMS resources configured at the IM-MGW contain more codecs
than selected for the established dialogue of the final response, the MGCF
should update the \"local IMS resources\" with the selected local codec
derived from the latest SDP of this established dialogue and local
configuration data. The \"reserve value\" may be cleared unless it is required
for DTMF.
\- The IM-MGW may be configured to use the remote IP address and port
information as source filter for incoming packages to prevent that early media
from other early SIP dialogues interfere with the media of the established
dialogue. The MGCF may also provide an IP address and port source filter that
disallows early media from other early dialogues in order to prevent that such
early media interfere with the media of the established dialogue. If the MGCF
has provided a source filter selecting media of another SIP early dialogue, it
shall remove or update this source filter.

originating Session Setup with ISUP, where forking occurs.

### 9.2.8 Handling of RTP telephone events
DTMF digits, telephony tones and signals (telephone events) can be transferred
using different mechanisms. For the IM CN Subsystem, TS 24.229 [9] defines the
usage of the RTP payload format defined for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones and
Telephony Signals in RFC 4733 [105]. When BICC signalling is used in the CS
network, telephony signals may be sent either inband or out-of-band as defined
in ITU-T Recommendation Q.1902.4 [30] and in ITU-T Recommendation Q.765.5
[35]. If ISUP signalling is used the DTMF tones are sent inband. The following
paragraphs describe the Mn interface procedures to transfer DTMF between RTP
format defined in RFC 4733 [105] and the CS CN.
Before the actual usage of the telephony signals can occur the
sending/receiving of telephone events need to be agreed with the SDP offer-
answer mechanism defined in RFC 3264 [36]. The outcome of the negotiation can
be e.g. that no telephone events are sent in RTP payload, telephone events are
sent only in one direction or in both directions. If the outcome of the
negotiation is that RTP payload telephone-events are sent in both directions,
the IM-MGW may nevertheless be configured to interwork only mobile originated
telephone-events.
When the offer-answer mechanism based session parameters negotiation results
in an agreement that telephone events are sent in the RTP payload and the
needed preconditions are fulfilled, telephone events can be sent in RTP
payload. This negotiation can be done at call control signalling phase or
during an ongoing call.
If the MGCF and IM-MGW support the reception and/or transmission of the RTP
MIME type \"telephone event\" (as defined in RFC 4733 [105]) with the IMS, the
following applies:
\- For CS Network Originating Sessions, the MGCF shall include the MIME type
\"telephone events\" with default events in the first SDP offer. After the
usage of telephone events is agreed in the subsequent offer-answer parameter
exchanges and the needed preconditions defined in RFC 3312 [37] are fulfilled,
telephone events can be sent as RTP payload.
\- In case of IM CN Subsystem Originating Sessions, the MGCF shall accept the
MIME type \"telephone events\" with default events in any SDP answer when it
received such an offer.
#### 9.2.8.1 Sending DTMF digits out-of-band to CS CN (BICC)
For the IM CN subsystem terminated session, the MGCF shall use the \"Configure
IMS Resources\" procedure as described in clause 9.2.3. For the IM CN
subsystem originating session, the MGCF shall use the \"Reserve IMS Connection
Point and Configure Remote Resources\" procedure as described in clause 9.2.2.
If DTMF is supported, the MGCF shall include \"telephone event\" along with
the selected speech codecs within the \"local IMS resources\" Parameter of
these procedures. The same termination shall be used to receive and transmit
DTMF and speech of the same call.
Furthermore, the MGCF shall use the \"Detect IMS RTP Tel Signal\" procedure to
request the MGW to detect incoming telephone events from the IMS and notify
the MGCF about the detected events. The MGW shall use the \"Notify IMS RTP Tel
Event\" procedure for this notification. The termination used to receive DTMF
shall be placed in the same context used for the speech of the same call. The
MGCF shall request to be notified when the MGW detects the end of a digit and
may also request to be notified when the MGW detects the start of a digit. An
IM-MGW not supporting the notification about the detection of the start of a
digit may ignore the request to provide this notification. If the IM-MGW
received a \"Detect IMS RTP Tel Event\" procedure for a termination, the IM-
MGW shall not forward inband to the CS network any DTMF received at this
termination.
Figure 48 shows an example message sequence chart when a DTMF digit is
received from the IM CN subsystem in the RTP payload and the MGCF has
requested to be notified only about the detection of the end of a digit.
Figure 48a shows an example message sequence chart when a DTMF digit is
received from the IM CN subsystem in the RTP payload and the MGCF has
requested to be notified about the detection of the start and the end of a
digit.

digit further when the start of the digit is recognized (message sequence
chart)
#### 9.2.8.2 Sending and receiving DTMF digits inband to/from CS CN (ISUP or
BICC)
For the IM CN subsystem terminated session, the MGCF shall use the \"Configure
IMS Resources\" procedure as described in clause 9.2.3. For the IM CN
subsystem originating session, the MGCF shall use the \"Reserve IMS Connection
Point and Configure Remote Resources\" procedure as described in clause 9.2.2.
If DTMF is supported and the MGCF wants to configure the IM_MGW to send and
receive DTMF to/from the CS network side, the MGCF shall include \"telephone
event\" along with the selected speech codecs within the \"local IMS
resources\" parameter of these procedures to request the MGW to detect
incoming telephone events and transform them into speech signals on the CS
side and shall not apply the \"Detect IMS RTP Tel Event\" procedure. When
receiving this configuration, an MGW supporting DTMF shall detect DTMF encoded
according as RTP Tel Event and transform this into DTMF tones encoded within
the speech codec used at the CS CN network and may in addition optionally
detect incoming telephone events received inband from the CS CN network and
transform them into telephone events on the IMS side. The same termination
shall be used to receive and transmit DTMF and speech of the same call.
Figure 49 shows the message sequence chart to configure the IM-MGW to receive
DTMF detection on the IMS side and transfer the DTMF inband on the CS side.
When receiving this configuration, the IM-MGW may in addition optionally
detect DTMF inband on the CS side and transmit DTMF on the IMS side.
Figure 49: Activation of processing of DTMF digits received in RTP for sending
the digits inband to CS CN (message sequence chart)
#### 9.2.8.3 Receiving DTMF digits out-of-band from CS CN (BICC)
For the IM CN subsystem terminated session, the MGCF shall use the \"Configure
IMS Resources\" procedure as described in clause 9.2.3. For the IM CN
subsystem originating session, the MGCF shall use the \"Reserve IMS Connection
Point and Configure Remote Resources\" procedure as described in clause 9.2.2.
If DTMF is supported, the MGCF shall include \"telephone event\" along with
the selected speech codecs within the \"local IMS resources\" Parameter of
these procedures. The same termination shall be used to receive and transmit
DTMF and speech of the same call.
Furthermore, the MGCF shall use the \"Send IMS RTP Tel Event\" and may use the
\"Stop IMS RTP Tel Event\" procedures to request the MGW to play out DTMF to
the IM CN subsystem whenever it receives out-of-band DTMF indications from the
BICC network.
Figure 49a shows an example message sequence chart when DTMF digits are
transmitted to the IM CN subsystem in the RTP payload. For the first digit,
the received APM message contains all information including the duration and
only a single notification is received. For the second digit, the start and
the end of the DTMF digit are notified separately.

transmitting them in RTP (message sequence chart)
### 9.2.9 Session hold initiated from IM CN subsystem
The network model in the clause 9.2.1 shall apply here.
**Hold request**
When the IMS network makes a hold request by sending an UPDATE or re-INVITE
message (signal 1 of figure 50), the MGCF shall request the IM-MGW to suspend
sending media towards the IMS side by changing the through-connection of the
IM CN subsystem side termination to \"not through-connected\" (signal 2 of
figure 50). If the IMS side provides modified SDP RR or RS bandwidth
modifiers, as specified in IETF RFC 3556 [59], within the hold request, the
MGCF shall use the Configure IMS Resources Mn procedure to forward this
information to the IM-MGW (not depicted in figure 50, but may be combined with
signal 2). The MGCF shall send a CPG (Hold) message to the succeeding CS
network node to indicate that the session is on hold (signal 4 of figure 50).
Simultaneously a SIP message acknowledging the Hold request is sent to the IMS
side (signal 7 of figure 50, acknowledged by signal 7.a if the INVITE method
is used). Announcements may be applied to the party on hold, depending on the
held party\'s status, using the Play Announcement procedure (for BICC) or the
Play TDM Announcement procedure (for ISUP, signal 5 in figure 50). The hold
operation shall not block RTCP flows.
**Resume request**
When the IMS network makes a request to retrieve the session on hold by
sending an UPDATE or re-INVITE message (signal 8 of figure 50), the MGCF shall
request the IM-MGW to re-establish communication towards the IMS network by
changing the through-connection of the IM CN subsystem side termination to
both-way through-connected (signal 11 of figure 50). If the IMS side provides
modified SDP RR or RS bandwidth modifiers, as specified in IETF RFC 3556 [59],
within the retrieve request, the MGCF shall use the Configure IMS Resources Mn
procedure to forward this information to the IM-MGW (not depicted in figure
50, but may be combined with signal 11). Possible announcements to the party
on hold shall be stopped using the Stop Announcement procedure (for BICC) or
the Stop TDM Announcement procedure (for ISUP, signal 9 in figure 50). The
MGCF shall send a CPG (Retrieve) message to the succeeding CS network node to
indicate that the session is retrieved (signal 13 of figure 50).
**Message sequence chart**
Figure 50 shows the message sequence chart for the call hold and retrieval
procedures.

When an MGCF receives a CPG message with a \"_remote hold\"_ Generic
notification indicator (signal 1 of figure 51), the MGCF forwards the hold
request by sending an UPDATE or re-INVITE message containing SDP with
\"_sendonly_ \" or \"inactive\" media (signal 4 of figure 51).
When an MGCF receives a CPG message with a \"_remote retrieval_ \" Generic
notification indicator (signal 6 of figure 51), the MGCF forwards the resume
request by sending an UPDATE or re-INVITE message containing SDP with
\"_sendrecv_ \" or \"recvonly\" media (signal 9 of figure 51).
If the MGCF receives a CPG with _\"remote hold\"_ or _\"remote retrieval\"_
before answer, it shall forward the request using an UPDATE message. If the
MGCF receives a CPG with _\"remote hold\"_ or _\"remote retrieval\"_ after
answer, it should forward the request using re-INVITE but may use UPDATE.
If link aliveness information is required at the IM-MGW while the media are on
hold, the MGCF should provide to the modified SDP RR and RS bandwidth
modifiers specified in IETF RFC 3556 [59] within the SDP offers in the UPDATE
or re-INVITE messages holding and retrieving the media to temporarily enable
RTCP while the media are on hold, as detailed in clause 7.4 of TS 26.236 [32].
If no link aliveness information is required at the IM-MGW, the MGCF should
provide the SDP RR and RS bandwidth modifiers previously used.
The interworking does not impact the user plane, unless the MGCF provides
modified SDP RR and RS bandwidth modifiers in the UPDATE or re-INVITE
messages. If the MGCF provides modified SDP RR and RS bandwidth modifiers in
the UPDATE or re-INVITE messages, the MGCF shall also provide modified SDP RR
and RS bandwidths to the IM-MGW using the Configure IMS Resoureces procedures
(signals 2-3 and 7-8 of figure 51).

### 9.2.11 Explicit Congestion Notification Support
#### 9.2.11.1 General
A MGCF and IM-MGW may support Multimedia Telephony using Explicit Congestion
Notification (see IETF RFC 3168 [129], IETF RFC 6679 [130], and TS 26.114
[104]), and may then act as an ECN endpoint to enable ECN with a local ECN-
capable terminal within a local network that properly handles ECN-marked
packets.
#### 9.2.11.1a Incoming Call Interworking from SIP to ISUP/BICC at I-MGCF
If the MGCF receives an SDP Offer containing ECN negotiation, see IETF RFC
6679 [130], and if all of the following statements are true:
\- the MGCF supports ECN according to TS 26.114 [104];
\- the IM-MGW supports ECN according to TS 26.114 [104];
\- the IM-MGW knows (via configuration) that the preceding (IMS) network
supports ECN according to TS 26.114 [104]; and
\- the IM-MGW supports at least some of the initialisation methods offered
within the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\",
NOTE 1: Only the \"leap\" initialisation method is supported over the Mn
interface in this release.
the MGCF shall:
\- act as an end point for ECN;
\- select an initialisation method supported by the IM-MGW;
\- determine if application specific feedback or ECN feedback messages shall
be used, taking into account whether the IM-MGW supports ECN feedback
messages, and the negotiation procedures in TS 26.114 [104];
\- determine if ECN XR summary reports can be used, taking into account
whether they are supported at the IM-MGW and the negotiation procedures in TS
26.114 [104];
\- return an SDP Answer according to TS 26.114 [104] and the capabilities of
the IM-MGW, containing the \"a=ecn-capable-rtp\" attribute; and
NOTE 2: ECN XR summary reports and RTCP AVPF ECN feedback message are not
supported in this release.
\- indicate to the IM-MGW that it shall apply the ECN procedures (according to
TS 26.114 [104]) and act as an ECT endpoint.
The IM-MGW should not send RTCP XR ECN summary reports.
#### 9.2.11.1b Outgoing Call Interworking from ISUP/BICC to SIP at O-MGCF
When creating the SDP Offer the MGCF may initiate ECN negotiation (in
accordance with TS 26.114 [104]) , indicating the capabilities of the IM-MGW
(e.g. supported initialisation methods, support of ECN feedback message, and
support of ECN XR summary reports).
NOTE: ECN XR summary reports and RTCP AVPF ECN feedback message are not
supported in this release.
If the MGCF receives the SDP Answer also containing ECN attributes (indicating
successful ECN negotiation) then it shall indicate to the IM-MGW that it shall
apply the ECN procedures (according to TS 26.114 [104]) and act as an ECT
endpoint.
The IM-MGW should not send RTCP XR ECN summary reports.
#### 9.2.11.1c Detection of ECN failures by IM-MGW
If the IM-MGW detects an ECN-related error case, for example non-ECT in the
received packets when ECT(0) was expected or detecting a very high packet loss
rate when ECN is used, the IM-MGW shall notify the MGCF. The MGCF should then
initiate a session re-negotiation to disable ECN.
#### 9.2.11.2 Message sequence chart
Figure 9.2.11.2.1 shows the message sequence chart example for requesting
Explicit Congestion Notification.
Figure 9.2.11.2.1: Procedure to Request ECN
Upon receipt of a request to apply Explicit Congestion Notification the IM-MGW
shall set the ECN field of the IP header in accordance with TS 26.114 [104]
when sending any data packets.
Upon receipt of any IP headers indicating ECN Congestion Experienced (ECN-CE)
the IM-MGW shall trigger rate adaptation in accordance with TS 26.114 [104].
Figure 9.2.11.2.2 shows the message sequence chart example for an ECN Failure
Event.
Figure 9.2.11.2.2: Procedure to Report ECN Failure
When the MGCF receives a Notification indicating that a failure has occurred,
the MGCF may trigger a new SDP offer to dissable ECN.

### 9.3.5 Multiple IP Realms
The procedures to support multiple IP realms in the present clause are
optional.
Figure 9.3.5.1 shows a scenario where multiple IP realms are applied.
Figure 9.3.5.1 Multiple IP realms scenario
Shown in Figure 9.3.5, the IM CN1 and CS CN1 represent separate IP realms. The
definition of IP realm is specified in IETF RFC 2663[90].
The termination1 and termination2 are connected with different IP realms in
the IM-MGW separately.
For establishing session when multiple IP realms are used in the IM-MGW, the
MGCF may indicate the IP realm identifier to the IM-MGW. The IM-MGW shall
assign the IP termination with the indicated IP realm.
A default IP realm may be configured in IM-MGW such that if the IM-MGW has not
received the IP realm identifier and the IM-MGW supports multiple IP realms
then the default IP realm shall be used.
If the IM-MGW does not support the option to indicate an IP realm then it is
free to select any IP port.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Void
###### ## Annex B (normative): Codec Negotiation between a BICC CS network and
the IM CN subsystem
# B.1 Introduction
This annex describes optional procedures for interworking of codec negotiation
between a BICC CS network and the IM CN subsystem.
# B.2 Control plane interworking
The following optional procedures apply in addition to the procedures of
clause 7.3 when both the BICC CS network and the IM CN subsystem support codec
negotiation. All five variations of the bearer set-up procedures defined in
clauses 7.4 and 7.5 of ITU-T Q.1902.4 [30] are supported. The codec
negotiation procedures are also independent of the procedures for interworking
between continuity procedures and SDP preconditions.
## B.2.1 Incoming call interworking from SIP to BICC at I-MGCF
### B.2.1.1 Sending of IAM
When the I-MGCF receives an INVITE with SDP offer, the I-MGCF shall follow the
procedures of clause B.2.5 to convert the list of codecs in the SDP offer into
a Supported Codec List for transmission in the outgoing IAM, according to
clause 8.3.1 of ITU-T Q.1902.4 [30], and deleting those codecs not supported
at the IM-MGW. When generating the Supported Codec List, the I-MGCF should add
to the SDP offer all codec configurations for which it can provide
transcoding. The I-MGCF shall allocate any IM-MGW resources as necessary to
support the chosen bearer set-up procedures towards the BICC CS network.
When the I-MGCF receives an INVITE without SDP offer, the I-MGCF shall
continue call establishment without interworking of codec negotiation
procedures. The mid-call interworking procedures of clause B.2.3 and clause
B.2.4 may still apply.
### B.2.1.2 Sending of SDP answer
The I-MGCF shall suspend the SDP answer procedure until it receives backward
codec information from the BICC serving node terminating codec negotiation.
When the I-MGCF receives the backward codec information, it shall select a
codec configuration for use on the bearer interface to the IM CN subsystem
from the codecs in the SDP offer, format an SDP answer based on this selected
codec, send the SDP answer to the offerer in the appropriate SIP message
(e.g., a reliable 18x response), and complete bearer establishment procedures.
To avoid allocating a transcoder at the IM-MGW, the I-MGCF should preferably
select a codec for the IM CN subsystem by converting the Selected Codec from
the BICC CS network into an SDP answer according to the procedures of clause
B.2.5, if allowed by the SDP offer/answer rules. Otherwise the I-MGCF should
select the highest priority codec from the codecs in the received SDP offer
supported by the IM-MGW for insertion in the SDP answer. Note that the I-MGCF
stores the Available Codec List and does not send it to the offerer in the SDP
answer. Codec negotiation is complete so it is not necessary for the offerer
to begin a second phase offer/answer exchange using the PRACK request.
## B.2.2 Outgoing call interworking from BICC to SIP at O-MGCF
### B.2.2.1 Sending of INVITE
When the O-MGCF receives an IAM, the O-MGCF shall follow the procedures of
clause B.2.5 to convert the Supported Codec List from the IAM into an SDP
offer for transmission in the outgoing INVITE request, according to RFC 3264,
deleting those codecs not supported at the IM-MGW. When generating the SDP
offer, the O-MGCF should include all codec configurations for which it can
provide transcoding in addition to those converted from the Supported Codec
List. The O-MGCF shall include at least one AMR codec configuration in the SDP
offer. The O-MGCF shall allocate any IM-MGW resources as necessary to support
the inclusion of session address information in the SDP offer towards the IM
CN subsystem.
### B.2.2.2 Responding to serving node initiating codec negotiation
The O-MGCF shall suspend the incoming bearer set-up procedure while waiting
for receipt of the SDP answer from the IM CN subsystem. When the O-MGCF
receives the SDP answer while suspending the incoming bearer set-up procedure,
it shall select a codec configuration for use on the bearer interface to the
IM CN subsystem from the codecs in the SDP answer, construct the Available
Codec List for the BICC CS network from the list of codecs received in the
Supported Codec List by removing codecs not supported at the IM-MGW, choose
the Selected Codec for the BICC CS network from the codecs in the Available
Codec List, initiate the second SDP offer/answer exchange with the IM CN
subsystem using the codec selected for the IM CN subsystem, if necessary, and
resume the incoming bearer set-up procedure in the BICC CS network. The O-MGCF
should select codecs for the bearer interfaces to the BICC CS network and IM
CN subsystem in such a way as to avoid transcoding at the IM-MGW and minimize
speech degradation, if possible, according to clause B.2.5. Otherwise the
O-MGCF should choose the highest priority codec from the Available Codec List
as the Selected Codec for the BICC CS network, and the highest priority codec
from the codecs in the SDP answer as the codec for the IM CN subsystem. If the
SDP answer only included a single voice codec, then there is no need for a
second SDP offer/answer exchange, and the codec selected for the IM CN
subsystem is the codec in the SDP answer.
Certain BICC timers or events can force completion of the incoming bearer set-
up procedure before the O-MGCF receives the SDP answer from the IM CN
subsystem. In this case, the O-MGCF shall perform the terminating codec
negotiation procedure according to clause 8.3.3 of ITU-T Q.1902.4 [30],
including all supported codecs in the Available Codec List, and shall resume
the incoming bearer set-up procedure without waiting any longer for the SDP
answer.
When an SDP answer arrives from the IM CN subsystem in response to the SDP
offer in an INVITE request after the BICC incoming bearer set-up procedure has
started, the O-MGCF shall select a codec configuration for use on the bearer
interface to the IM CN subsystem from the codecs in the SDP answer, choose a
new Selected Codec for the BICC CS network from the codecs in the Available
Codec List constructed during incoming bearer set-up, and initiate the second
SDP offer/answer exchange with the IM CN subsystem using the codec selected
for the IM CN subsystem, if necessary. The O-MGCF should select codecs for the
bearer interfaces to the BICC CS network and IM CN subsystem in such a way as
to avoid transcoding at the IM-MGW and minimize speech degradation, if
possible, according to clause B.2.5. Otherwise the O-MGCF should select the
highest priority codecs from the available options for the two bearer
interfaces. If the SDP answer only included a single voice codec, then there
is no need for a second SDP offer/answer exchange, and the codec selected for
the IM CN subsystem is the codec in the SDP answer. When the call in the BICC
CS network enters a state capable of supporting codec modification, if the new
Selected Codec is different from the Selected Codec chosen during the incoming
bearer set-up procedure for the BICC CS network, the O-MGCF should initiate
the codec modification procedure towards the BICC CS network using the new
Selected Codec, according to clause 10.4.1 of ITU-T Q.1902.4 [30].
## B.2.3 Mid-call interworking from SIP to BICC at I-MGCF or O-MGCF
### B.2.3.1 Receipt of SDP offer
When the MGCF receives a SIP message (e.g. UPDATE request or re-INVITE
request) with an SDP offer that is not associated with incoming call bearer
establishment or preconditions, if the call is in a state capable of
supporting BICC codec negotiation, the MGCF shall follow the procedures of
clause B.2.5 to convert the list of codecs in the SDP offer into a Supported
Codec List, delete those codecs in the Supported Codec List not supported at
the IM-MGW, and initiate the mid-call codec negotiation procedure according to
clause 10.4.4 of ITU-T Q.1902.4 [30], by sending an APM with the Supported
Codec List and an Action indicator set to \"mid-call codec negotiation\". When
generating the Supported Codec List, the MGCF should add to the SDP offer all
codec configurations for which it can provide transcoding.
When the MGCF receives a SIP message with an SDP offer that is not associated
with incoming call bearer establishment or preconditions, if the call is not
in a state capable of supporting BICC codec negotiation, the MGCF shall
respond to the SDP offer with existing procedures for the IM CN subsystem.
When the call is in a state capable of supporting BICC codec negotiation, the
MGCF may send a re-INVITE request without SDP towards the IM CN subsystem,
soliciting a response with an SDP offer, thereby restarting the codec
negotiation interworking procedure.
### B.2.3.2 Generating SDP answer
After initiating a BICC codec negotiation procedure towards the BICC CS
network in response to receipt of a SIP message with an SDP offer from the IM
CN subsystem, the MGCF shall suspend the SDP answer procedure until it
receives codec information from the succeeding BICC serving node. If the
succeeding serving node returns a successful response, the MGCF shall select a
codec configuration for use on the bearer interface to the IM CN subsystem
from the codecs in the SDP offer, format an SDP answer based on this selected
codec, send the SDP answer to the offerer in the appropriate SIP message (e.g.
200 OK (UPDATE) or 200 OK (INVITE)), send an APM to the succeeding serving
node with an Action indicator set to \"successful codec modification\", and
complete bearer establishment procedures. To avoid allocating a transcoder at
the IM-MGW, the MGCF should preferably select a codec for the IM CN subsystem
by converting the Selected Codec from the BICC CS network into an SDP answer
according to the procedures of clause B.2.5, if allowed by the SDP
offer/answer rules. Otherwise the MGCF should select the highest priority
codec from the codecs in the received SDP offer supported by the IM-MGW for
insertion in the SDP answer. Note that the MGCF stores the Available Codec
List and does not send it to the offerer in the SDP answer.
If the succeeding serving node returns an Action indicator set to \"mid-call
codec negotiation failure\", the MGCF either should send a 488 response to the
SDP offerer indicating rejection of the initial SDP offer, or should select
the highest priority codec from the codecs in the received SDP offer supported
by the IM-MGW, format an SDP answer based on this selected codec, and send the
SDP answer to the offerer in the appropriate SIP message. If the MGCF sends a
488 response to the SDP offerer, it should continue the call with the bearer
configuration in place before initiating this codec negotiation procedure.
## B.2.4 Mid-call interworking from BICC to SIP at I-MGCF or O-MGCF
### B.2.4.1 Receipt of mid-call codec negotiation request
When the MGCF receives an APM with an Action indicator set to \"mid-call codec
negotiation\", the MGCF shall follow the procedures of clause B.2.5 to convert
the Supported Codec List from the APM into an SDP offer for transmission in an
appropriate SIP message (e.g. re-INVITE request) towards the IM CN subsystem,
according to RFC 3264 [36], deleting those codecs not supported at the IM-MGW.
When generating the SDP offer, the MGCF should include all codec
configurations for which it can provide transcoding in addition to those
converted from the Supported Codec List. The MGCF shall include at least one
AMR codec configuration in the SDP offer.
### B.2.4.2 Responding to serving node initiating mid-call codec negotiation
The MGCF shall delay responding to the mid-call codec negotiation from the
BICC CS network until it receives a response to the SDP offer from the IM CN
subsystem. If the MGCF receives an SDP answer, it shall construct the
Available Codec List for the BICC CS network from the list of codecs received
in the Supported Codec List by removing codecs not supported at the IM-MGW,
choose the Selected Codec for the BICC CS network from the codecs in the
Available Codec List, and complete the mid-call codec negotiation procedure
towards the preceding serving node according to clause 10.4.5 of ITU-T
Q.1902.4 [30]. The MGCF should choose the Selected Codec for the BICC CS
network in such a way as to avoid transcoding at the IM-MGW and minimize
speech degradation, if possible, according to clause B.2.5. Otherwise the MGCF
should choose the highest priority codec from the Available Codec List for the
Selected Codec for the BICC CS network. If the MGCF receives an APM from the
preceding serving node with an Action indicator set to \"codec modification
failure\", then the MGCF may initiate a new SDP offer/answer exchange towards
the IM CN subsystem in an attempt to recreate the bearer configuration in
place before this codec negotiation procedure began.
If the MGCF receives a 488 response or other failure response (e.g. 3xx-6xx)
to the SDP offer, either it should reject the mid-call codec negotiation from
the BICC CS network by sending an APM with an Action indicator set to \"mid-
call codec negotiation failure\" towards the preceding serving node, or it
should continue as if it received an SDP answer with no change in codec
selected for the IM CN subsystem. If the MGCF sends an APM with an Action
indicator set to \"mid-call codec negotiation failure\", it should continue
the call with the bearer configuration in place before initiating this codec
negotiation procedure.
### B.2.4.3 Receipt of codec modification request
If the MGCF receives an APM from a BICC CS network that includes an Action
indicator set to \"modify codec\" with no change in the selected codec, it
shall act as a serving node terminating codec modification, according to
clause 10.4.2 of ITU-T Q.1902.4 [30], without interworking the procedure with
the IM CN subsystem.
If the MGCF receives an APM from a BICC CS network that includes an Action
indicator set to \"modify codec\" and the new selected codec in the message is
different from the Selected Codec at the IM-MGW bearer interface to the BICC
CS network, the MGCF either may act as a serving node terminating codec
modification, according to clause 10.4.2 of ITU-T Q.1902.4 [30], without
interworking the procedure with the IM CN subsystem, or may follow the
procedures of clause B.2.5 to convert the new Available Codec List (with new
priority order) from the APM into an SDP offer for transmission in an
appropriate SIP message (e.g. re-INVITE request) towards the IM CN subsystem,
according to RFC 3264 [36], deleting those codecs not supported at the IM-MGW.
When generating the SDP offer, the MGCF should include all codec
configurations for which it can provide transcoding in addition to those
converted from the new Available Codec List. The MGCF shall include at least
one AMR codec configuration in the SDP offer.
If the MGCF sends a SIP message with an SDP offer towards the IM CN subsystem
in response to receipt of a BICC codec modification request, then it shall
delay responding to the BICC codec modification request until it receives a
response to the SDP offer from the IM CN subsystem. When the MGCF receives
either an SDP answer or a rejection of the SDP offer within the appropriate
SIP message (e.g. 200 OK (INVITE)) from the IM CN subsystem, it shall decide
whether to accept or reject the BICC codec modification procedure and complete
the procedure for a BICC serving node terminating codec modification,
according to clause 10.4.2 of ITU-T Q.1902.4 [30].
If the MGCF sends an APM with an Action indicator set to \"codec modification
failure\" in response to receipt of a codec modification request, the
preceding BICC serving node may retry the request with a mid-call codec
negotiation using an APM including an Action indicator set to \"mid-call
negotiation\" and a Supported Codec List with a new priority order encouraging
selection of a new codec.
## B.2.5 Codec parameter translation between BICC CS network and the IM CN
subsystem
The IM CN subsystem uses the Session Description Protocol (SDP, defined in
IETF RFC 4566 [56]) to select and potentially re-negotiate the codec type and
configuration and associated bearer format attributes to be used in the user
plane. IETF RFC 3550 [51] defines the Real Time Protocol (RTP) for framing of
all codecs in the user plane, IETF RFC 3551 [52] and IETF RFC 3555 [53] define
the framing details for many of the ITU-T codecs, and IETF RFC 4867 [23]
defines framing details for the AMR family of codecs. This clause will focus
only on codec-specific SDP parameters not already constrained by clause 5.1.1
of TS 26.236 [32]. The signalling plane of the IM CN subsystem uses SDP
offer/answer procedures defined in IETF RFC 3264 [36] to select the desired
codec type and configuration for the user plane from a prioritized list of
codec types and configurations and to re-negotiate the user plane attributes
as necessary.
The bearer independent CS network uses the Single Codec and Codec List
information elements of the Application Transport Mechanism (APM) defined in
ITU-T Recommendation Q.765.5 [35] to negotiate (offer and select) and
potentially re-negotiate the codec type and configuration and associated
bearer format attributes to be used in the user plane. TS 29.414 [25] and TS
29.415 [26] define the IuFP framing protocol for all codecs in the user plane
for both ATM and IP transport, and TS 26.102 [50] provides the framing details
for AMR and PCM family codecs. The Codec List information element of the APM
comprises multiple instances of the Single Codec information element in
priority order, as shown in Figure 13 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.765.5 [35].
Figure 14 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.765.5 [35] defines the Single Codec
information element. clause 11.1.7.2 of ITU-T Recommendation Q.765.5 [35]
defines the encoding of the Single Codec information element for the ITU-T
codecs. TS 26.103 [57] defines the encoding of the Single Codec information
element for the 3GPP codecs, and table 7.11.3.1.3-2 of TS 28.062 [58] defines
the preferred configurations of the narrowband AMR codecs (Config-NB-Code) for
interoperation with TFO. The signalling plane of the bearer independent CS
network uses the APM to negotiate the desired codec type and configuration for
the user plane from the prioritized list of codec types and to re-negotiate
the user plane attributes as necessary.
The following clauses define the translations between the SDP payload format
parameters of the IM CN subsystem and the corresponding subfields of the
Single Codec information element of the bearer independent CS network for
certain 3GPP and ITU-T codecs. Following these translation rules will in many
cases allow the IM-MGW to perform interworking between the framing protocols
on the bearer interfaces to the BICC CS network and the IM CN subsystem
without transcoding. Implementations may signal other codec types not listed
herein or other codec configurations of codec types listed herein.
Implementations may also choose to perform transcoding between codec
configurations signalled separately for the bearer interfaces to the networks,
if necessary, but voice quality may suffer.
### B.2.5.1 Codec parameters for 3GPP AMR-NB codecs
Table B.1 shows the correspondence between the codec format parameters in the
Single Codec information element (TS 26.103 [57]) and the SDP for the 3GPP
narrowband AMR codecs (IETF RFC 4867 [23]).

**Definitions:**
**Supported Codec List** : contains the offered Codec Types and Configuration-
possibilities of the node initiating codec negotiation in BICC (see also TS
23.153). The Supported Codec List is sent from the initiating node forward to
the terminating node. The Supported Codec List corresponds to an SDP offer
during codec negotiation.
**Available Codec List** : contains the offered Codec Types and Configuration-
possibilities of the contiguous portion of the connection between initiating
and terminating BICC nodes, including all intermediate nodes through the BICC
network(s). The Available Codec List is sent from the BICC node terminating
codec negotiation backward to the initiating node. The Available Codec List
corresponds to information sometimes available in a first-round SDP answer.
The Available Codec List might not represent an end-to-end view of the
available Codec Types and Configuration-possibilities when traversing both
BICC and SIP networks.
**Selected Codec Type** : is determined by the node terminating codec
negotiation. It specifies exactly the Codec Type and one unique Codec
Configuration for the call. The Selected Codec Type corresponds to the final
SDP answer.
When translating from a Single Codec information element to the equivalent SDP
payload format parameters, where either OM=0 (in the Supported or Available
Codec List) or the information element is the Selected Codec Type, the SDP
shall include a single payload type and any associated parameters from the
corresponding row in table B.1. When translating from a Single Codec
information element to the equivalent SDP payload format parameters, where
OM=1 in the Supported or Available Codec List, the SDP shall only include
payload formats corresponding to Codec Configurations compatible with the
offered ACS, SCS and MACS, according to table B.1. Since the number of
compatible payload formats can be large, implementations should select a
reasonable subset of the higher-priority payload formats for inclusion in the
SDP. When translating a list of Single Codec information elements into SDP,
duplicate payload types (matching on all parameters) shall be removed.
The following guidelines shall apply when translating from an SDP payload
format specification to a Single Codec information element:
\- If there is no \"mode-set\" parameter for a payload format in the SDP and
the SDP is to be translated into a Supported or Available Codec List, then the
corresponding Single Codec subfields shall be OM=1, MACS=8, all SCS modes
offered, and ACS modes offered. Alternatively it is sufficient to specify only
the Codec Type (see below) and omit the other parameters.
\- If there is no \"mode-set\" parameter for a payload format in an SDP answer
that is to be translated into a Selected Codec Type, then the corresponding
Single Codec subfields shall be derived from the payload type in the SDP offer
(to which the SDP answer was sent in response).
\- If there is a \"mode-set\" parameter for a payload format in the SDP, then
the corresponding Single Codec subfields shall be OM=0 and ACS modes selected
according to the value of \"mode-set\". The SCS shall be set identical to the
ACS and MACS shall be set to the number of modes in the ACS. If this \"mode-
set\" does not represent a valid configuration for the Codec Type (determined
by OoBTC procedures), then the payload format shall not be translated.
\- If a payload format in an SDP offer that is to be translated into a
Supported Codec List includes \"mode-change-period=2\" parameter or includes
\"mode-change-capability=2\" parameter, then the Codec IDentification value
for the corresponding Single Codec shall be FR_AMR.
\- If a payload format in an SDP answer that is to be translated into a
Selected Codec Type or Available Codec List includes \"mode-change-period=2\",
then the Codec IDentification value for the corresponding Single Codec shall
be one of FR_AMR, HR_AMR, OHR_AMR or UMTS_AMR_2, if offered in the Supported
Codec List.
\- If a payload format in an SDP offer that is to be translated into a
Supported Codec List does not include \"mode-change-period=2\" parameter and
does not include \"mode-change-capability=2\" parameter, then the Codec
IDentification value for the corresponding Single Codec shall be UMTS_AMR.
\- If a payload format in an SDP answer that is to be translated into a
Selected Codec Type or Available Codec List does not include \"mode-change-
period=2\" parameter and does not include \"mode-change-capability=2\"
parameter, then the Codec IDentification value for the corresponding Single
Codec shall be one of UMTS_AMR_2, FR_AMR, HR_AMR, OHR_AMR or UMTS_AMR, if
offered in the Supported Codec List.
### B.2.5.2 Codec parameters for 3GPP AMR-WB codecs
Table B.2 shows the correspondence between the codec format parameters in the
Single Codec information element (TS 26.103 [57]) and the SDP for the 3GPP
wideband AMR codecs (IETF RFC 4867 [23]).

When translating from a Single Codec information element to the equivalent SDP
payload format parameters, the SDP shall include a distinct payload type and
any associated parameters for each row in the table that matches the Config-
WB-Code parameter. For example, OFR_AMR-WB with Config-WB-Code=3 can generate
three SDP payload types for AMR-WB, each including the \"mode-change-
period=2\" parameter, the \"mode-change-neighbor=1\" parameter, and the
\"mode-set\" parameter with value sets \"0,1,2,4\", \"0,1,2,8\", and
\"0,1,2\", respectively. When translating a list of Single Codec information
elements into SDP, duplicate payload types (matching on all parameters) shall
be removed.
The following guidelines shall apply when translating from one or more SDP
payload format specifications to a Single Codec information element:
\- Payload formats that match except for different values of \"mode-set\"
shall be represented with the fewest values of Config-WB-Code, while retaining
the priority represented by the order of the payload formats in the SDP. For
example, three SDP payload types for AMR-WB, each including the \"mode-change-
period=2\" parameter, the \"mode-change-neighbor=1\" parameter, and the
\"mode-set\" parameter with value sets \"0,1,2,4\", \"0,1,2,8\", and
\"0,1,2\", respectively, will generate Config-WB-Code=3.
\- If there is no \"mode-set\" parameter for a payload format in the SDP and
the SDP is to be translated into a Supported or Available Codec List, then the
corresponding Single Codec shall have a Config-WB-Code value of 1.
\- If there is no \"mode-set\" parameter for a payload format in an SDP answer
that is to be translated into a Selected Codec Type, then the corresponding
Config-WB-Code value shall be derived from the payload type in the SDP offer
(to which the SDP answer was sent in response).
\- If a payload format in an SDP offer that is to be translated into a
Supported Codec List includes \"mode-change-period=2\" parameter or includes
\"mode-change-capability=2\" parameter, then the Codec IDentification value
for the corresponding Single Codec shall be OFR_AMR-WB.
\- If a payload format in an SDP answer is to be translated into a Selected
Codec Type or Available Codec List, then the Codec IDentification value for
the corresponding Single Codec shall be one of OFR_AMR-WB, FR_AMR-WB, OHR_AMR-
WB or UMTS_AMR-WB, if offered in the Supported Codec List.
\- If a payload format in an SDP offer that is to be translated into a
Supported Codec List does not include \"mode-change-period=2\" parameter and
does not include \"mode-change-capability=2\" parameter, then the payload
format shall not be translated.
### B.2.5.3 Codec parameters for 3GPP non-AMR codecs
Table B.3 shows the correspondence between the codec format parameters in the
Single Codec information element (TS 26.103 [57]) and the SDP for the 3GPP
non-AMR codecs (IETF RFC 4867 [23], IETF RFC 3551 [52], IETF RFC 3555 [53] and
IETF RFC 5993 [114]).

### B.2.5.4 Codec parameters for ITU-T codecs
Table B.4 shows the correspondence between the codec format parameters in the
Single Codec information element (Clause 11.1.7 of ITU-T Q.765.5 [35]) and the
SDP for the ITU-T codecs (Table 4 of RFC 3551 [52], and RFC 3555 [53]).

NOTE: An \"x\" in a bit position of the Codec Configuration subfield indicates
a \"don\'t care\" value. The SDP payload description for each listed codec
includes a clock rate of 8000 Hz. TS 26.102 [50] only describes the BICC CS
network framing for the PCM codecs.
* * *
When translating from a Single Codec information element to the equivalent SDP
payload format parameters, the SDP shall include a distinct payload type and
any associated parameters for each matching instance of the Codec
Configuration subfield. For example, G.726 (ADPCM) with Codec Configuration
subfield \"0101\" shall generate SDP payload types for G726-32 and G726-16.
When translating from an SDP payload format specification to the Single Codec
information element, each SDP payload type should be represented by one
matching Single Codec information element. For example, SDP payload types for
G729 and G729E may generate one Single Codec information element for \"G.729
Annex B\" with Codec Configuration subfield \"110\". The G729 and G729E codecs
may alternately be represented by two Single Codec information elements for
\"G.729 Annex B\" with Codec Configuration subfields \"100\" and \"010\",
respectively, if it is necessary to indicate preference between them.
# B.3 MGCF -- IM-MGW interaction during interworking of codec negotiation
## B.3.1 Basic IM CN subsystem originated session
This clause shows an example of the interworking of codec negotiation between
an IM CN subsystem and a BICC CS network during session establishment for an
IM CN subsystem originated session. The example applies to BICC forward bearer
establishment. Similar procedures apply to the other four versions of bearer
establishment procedure applicable to the BICC CS network. The exchange of
codec information is identical in all five cases, but there are differences in
the sequence of operations associated with bearer establishment within the
BICC CS network.
## B.3.1.1 BICC forward bearer establishment
#### B.3.1.1.1 IM-MGW selection
The MGCF shall select an IM-MGW for the bearer connection before it performs
the CS network side bearer establishment. This may happen either before
sending the IAM or after receiving the APM message (signal 3 or signal 4 in
figure B.1). In the latter case, the IM-MGW selection may be based on a
possibly received MGW-id from the succeeding node.
#### B.3.1.1.2 CS network side bearer establishment
The MGCF shall either select bearer characteristics or request the IM-MGW to
select and provide the bearer characteristics for the CS network side bearer
connection before sending the IAM. In the latter case the MGCF shall use the
Prepare Bearer procedure, not shown in figure B.1, to request the IM-MGW to
select the bearer characteristics. After the succeeding node has provided a
bearer address and a binding reference in the APM, the MGCF shall use the
Establish Bearer procedure to request the IM-MGW to establish a bearer towards
the destination CS-MGW. The MGCF shall provide the IM-MGW with the bearer
address, the binding reference and the bearer characteristics (signal 5 in
figure B.1).
#### B.3.1.1.3 IM CN subsystem side session establishment
When the MGCF receives the Selected Codec from the succeeding serving node in
the CS network (signal 4 in figure B.1) and selects a codec for use in the IM
CN subsystem, the MGCF shall initiate the Reserve IMS Connection Point and
Configure Remote Resources procedure (signal 7 and 8 in figure B.1). From the
received SDP and selected configuration data the MGCF:
\- Shall send the appropriate remote codec(s), the remote UDP port and the
remote IP address to the IM-MGW. The remote UDP port and IP address refer to
the destination of user plane data sent towards the IM CN subsystem. The
remote codec(s) are the codec(s) the IM-MGW may select for user plane data
sent towards the IM CN subsystem.
\- Shall indicate to the IM-MGW the appropriate local codec(s) and request a
local IP address and UDP port. The local IP address and UDP port are used by
the IM-MGW to receive user plane data from the IM CN subsystem. The local
codec(s) are the codec(s) the IM-MGW may select to receive user plane data
from the IM CN subsystem.
\- If DTMF support together with speech support is required, the reserve value
indicator shall be set to \"true\".
The IM-MGW
\- Shall reply to the MGCF with the selected local codec(s) and the selected
remote codec(s) and the selected local UDP port and IP address.
\- Shall reserve resources for those codec(s).
The MCGF shall send the local codec(s), UDP port and IP address to the IMS in
the Session Progress (signal 9 in figure B.1).
#### B.3.1.1.4 Through-connection
During the Prepare Bearer and Establish Bearer procedures, the MGCF shall
either use the Change Through-Connection procedure to request the IM-MGW to
backward through-connect the BICC terminations, or the MGCF shall use this
procedure to both-way through-connect the BICC termination already on this
stage (signal 5 in figure B.1). During the Reserve IMS Connection Point
procedure, the MGCF shall use the Change IMS Through-Connection procedure to
request the IM-MGW to backward through-connect the IMS termination (signal 7
in figure B.1).
When the MGCF receives the BICC:ANM answer indication, it shall request the
IM-MGW to both-way through-connect the termination using the Change Through-
Connection or Change IMS Through-Connection procedures (signal 20 in figure
B.1), unless those terminations are already both-way through-connected.
#### B.3.1.1.5 Codec handling
The IM-MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each termination.
#### B.3.1.1.6 Failure handling in MGCF
If any procedure between the MGCF and the IM-MGW is not completed successfully
the default action by the MGCF is to release the session, as described in
clause 9.2.6. If the MGCF receives a Bearer Released procedure from the IM-MGW
the default action by the MGCF is to release the session as described in
clause 9.2.7.
NOTE: As an implementation option the MGCF may also decide for example to only
release the resources in the IM-MGW that caused the failure, possibly select a
new IM-MGW for the connection and continue the call establishment using new
resources in the selected IM-MGW but such handling is outside of the scope of
the present document.
#### B.3.1.1.7 Message sequence chart
Figure B.1 shows the message sequence chart for the IM CN subsystem
originating session with BICC forward bearer establishment where the selection
of IM-MGW is done after receipt of the APM. The MGCF then requests the seizure
of a CS network side bearer termination and the establishment of the bearer.
When the MGCF receives an answer indication, it requests the IM-MGW to both-
way through-connect the terminations.
Figure B.1: Basic IM CN Subsystem originating session, BICC forward bearer
establishment\ (message sequence chart)
## B.3.2 Basic CS network originated session
This clause shows an example of the interworking of codec negotiation between
a BICC CS network and an IM CN subsystem during session establishment for a
BICC CS network originated session. The example applies to BICC forward bearer
establishment. Similar procedures apply to the other four versions of bearer
establishment procedure applicable to the BICC CS network. The exchange of
codec information is identical in all five cases, but there are differences in
the sequence of operations associated with bearer establishment within the
BICC CS network.
### B.3.2.1 BICC forward bearer establishment
#### B.3.2.1.1 IM-MGW selection
The MGCF shall select an IM-MGW for the bearer connection before it performs
the IM CN subsystem session establishment or the CS network side bearer
establishment.
#### B.3.2.1.2 IM CN subsystem side termination reservation
The MGCF shall derive from the codec negotiation procedure one or several
appropriate local codec(s) the IM-MGW may use to receive user plane data from
the IM CN subsystem. The MGCF shall use the Reserve IMS Connection Point
procedure (signals 2 and 3 in figure B.2/1). Within this procedure, the MGCF
shall indicate the local codec(s) and request a local IP address and UDP port
from the IM-MGW. The local IP address and UDP port are used by the IM-MGW to
receive user plane data from the IM CN subsystem. If DTMF support together
with speech support is required, or if the resources for multiple speech
codecs shall be reserved at this stage, the reserve value indicator shall be
set to \"true\".
The IM-MGW shall reply to the MGCF with the selected local codec(s) and the
selected local IP address and UDP port.
The MGCF shall send this information in the INVITE (signal 4 in figure B.2/1)
to the IM CN subsystem.
#### B.3.2.1.3 IM CN subsystem side session establishment
The MGCF shall use the Configure IMS Resources procedure (signals 7 and 8 in
figure B.2/1) to provide configuration data (derived from SDP received in
signal 6 in figure B.2/1 and the codec negotiation procedure) to the IM-MGW as
detailed below:
\- The MGCF shall indicate the remote IP address and UDP port, i.e. the
destination IP address and UDP port for data sent in the user plane towards
the IM CN subsystem,
\- The MGCF shall indicate the remote codec(s), i.e. the speech codec(s) for
data sent in the user plane towards the IM CN subsystem.
\- The MGCF may indicate the local codec(s) and the local IP address and UDP
port. The MGCF shall indicate the local codec(s) if a change is required.
\- IF DTMF support together with speech support is required, the reserve value
indicator shall be set to \"true\".
The IM-MGW shall reply with the selected remote codec(s) and reserve resources
for these codec(s). If local codec(s) were received, the IM-MGW shall also
reply with the selected local codec(s) and reserve the corresponding
resources.
If the selected local codec(s) differ from the codec(s) received in the SDP of
signal 6 in figure B.2/1, the MGCF shall send the local reserved codec(s), and
the local IP address and UDP port in the PRACK (signal 9 in figure B.2/1) to
the IMS.
#### B.3.2.1.4 CS network side bearer establishment
The MGCF shall request the IM-MGW to prepare for the CS network side bearer
establishment using the Prepare Bearer procedure (signals 11 and 12 in figure
B.2/1). Within this procedure, the MGCF shall request the IM-MGW to provide a
bearer address, a binding reference and optionally notify when the bearer is
established. The MGCF shall also provide the IM-MGW with the bearer
characteristics determined by the codec negotiation procedure. After the IM-
MGW has replied with the bearer address and the binding reference, the MGCF
provides the APM message (signal 13 in figure B.2/1) to the preceding node.
The MGCF may also provide the IM-MGW-id in the APM message.
#### B.3.2.1.5 Called party alerting
The MGCF shall request the IM-MGW to provide an awaiting answer indication
(ringing tone) to the calling party using the Send Tone procedure (signals 21
and 22 in figure B.2/1), when the following condition is satisfied:
\- the MGCF receives the first 180 Ringing message
#### B.3.2.1.6 Called party answer
When the MGCF receives a 200 OK message (signal 23 in figure B.2/2), it shall
request the IM-MGW to stop providing the ringing tone to the calling party
using the Stop Tone procedure (signals 26 and 27 in figure B.2/2).
#### B.3.2.1.7 Through-Connection
During the Prepare Bearer procedure, the MGCF shall either use the Change
Through-Connection procedure to request the IM-MGW to backward through-connect
the BICC termination, or the MGCF shall use this procedure to both-way
through-connect the BICC termination already on this stage (signals 11 and 12
in figure B.2/1). During the Reserve IMS Connection Point procedure, the MGCF
shall use the Change IMS Through-Connection procedure to request the IM-MGW to
backward through-connect the IMS termination (signals 2 and 3 in figure
B.2/1).
When the MGCF receives the SIP 200 OK(INVITE) (signal 23 in figure B.2/2), it
requests the IM-MGW to both-way through-connect the terminations using the
Change IMS Through-Connection or Change Through-Connection procedures (signals
28 and 29 in figure B.2/2), unless those terminations are already both-way
through-connected.
#### B.3.2.1.8 Codec handling
The IM-MGW may include a speech transcoder based upon the speech coding
information provided to each termination.
#### B.3.2.1.9 Failure handling in MGCF
If any procedure between the MGCF and the IM-MGW is not completed
successfully, the default action by the MGCF is to release the session as
described in clause 9.2.6. If the MGCF receives a Bearer Released procedure
from the IM-MGW the default action by the MGCF is to release the session, as
described in clause 9.2.7.
NOTE: As an implementation option the MGCF may also decide for example to only
release the resources in the IM-MGW that caused the failure, possibly select a
new IM-MGW for the connection and continue the call establishment using new
resources in the selected IM-MGW but such handling is outside of the scope of
the present document.
#### B.3.2.1.10 Message sequence chart
Figures B.2/1 and B.2/2 show the message sequence chart for the CS network
originating session with BICC forward bearer establishment.

## B.3.3 CS network initiated mid-call codec negotiation
Figure B.3 shows the CS network initiated mid-call codec negotiation procedure
interworking with the IM CN subsystem. When the MGCF selects the codecs for
the CS network and the IM CN subsystem (after signal 3 in figure B.3), the
MGCF shall modify the CS network termination and the IM CN subsystem
termination on the IM-MGW to conform to the newly selected configuration data
on the two interfaces. The MGCF may perform bearer operations (not shown) at
the IM-MGW before interworking the initial codec modification request (signal
2 in figure B.3) to determine new connection information, if necessary, or to
verify resource availability.

## B.3.4 IM CN subsystem initiated mid-call codec negotiation
Figure B.4 shows the IM CN subsystem initiated mid-call codec negotiation
procedure interworking with a BICC CS network. When the MGCF selects the
codecs for the CS network and the IM CN subsystem (after signal 3 in figure
B.4), the MGCF shall modify the CS network termination and the IM CN subsystem
termination on the IM-MGW to conform to the newly selected configuration data
on the two interfaces. The MGCF may perform bearer operations (not shown) at
the IM-MGW before interworking the initial codec modification request (signal
2 in figure B.3) to determine new connection information, if necessary, or to
verify resource availability. The MGCF may also perform bearer operations (not
shown) at the IM-MGW after sending the final APM (signal 8 in figure B.4) to
modify transport bandwidth, if necessary.

###### ## Annex C (normative): Interworking of CPC parameter
The CPC extension to tel-URI Parameter is defined in clause 7.2A.12 of TS
24.229 [9]. The SIP \"Accept-Language\" header is defined in IETF RFC 3261
[19].
# C.1 Interworking SIP to ISUP
Table C.1.1 shows the mapping of a \"cpc\" URI parameter received within tel
URI or the userinfo part of SIP URI with user=\"phone\" in a P-Asserted-
Identity header in the initial INVITE request to the Calling party\'s category
parameter in the ISUP IAM. When the \"cpc\" URI parameter value \"operator\"
is received the I-MGCF shall use an Accept-Language header field to determine
the value of the Calling party\'s category parameter.
Table C.1.1: Mapping of the CPC parameter to the ISUP Calling party\'s

# E.2 Control plane interworking
## E.2.1 General
In addition to the control plane Interworking between SIP and ISUP or BICC,
interactions between the H.245 signalling at the CS side and SIP/SDP
signalling are described.
The establishment of the H.223 multiplexing protocol and the subsequent H.245
signalling procedures take place after the set-up and both-way through-
connection of the CS bearer.
## E.2.2 Functionalities required in the MGCF for multimedia calls support
In addition to the control plane Interworking between SIP and ISUP or BICC,
the MGCF needs to mediate interactions between the H.245 signalling or MONA
(Media Oriented Negotiation Acceleration) procedures at the CS side and
SIP/SDP signalling at the IMS side. The interactions between H.245 signalling
or MONA procedures and SIP/SDP signalling should aim at avoiding media
transcoding by selecting the same codec for the CS side and the PS side.
NOTE: Detailed procedures for the mapping between SDP parameters and H.245
parameters are not specified in the present release.
## E.2.3 IM CN subsystem originated session
### E.2.3.1 Preconditions used at IMS side
#### E.2.3.1.1 Interactions between H.245 or MONA and SIP/SDP
Figure E.2.3.1.1.1 shows examples of interactions between H.245 or MONA
procedures and SIP/SDP for IM CN subsystem originated session. Most SIP and
ISUP or BICC messages are intentionally omitted, since the SDP may be embedded
in various SIP messages and since the in‑band H.245 Messages are not tightly
coupled with out-of-band ISUP or BICC messages.
Figure E.2.3.1.1.1 assumes that the IMS peer uses the SIP precondition
extension to indicate that preconditions have not yet been met.
Figure E.2.3.1.1.1: Interactions between H.245 and SIP/SDP for IM CN subsystem
originated session\ IMS peer indicates unmet local preconditions
Upon receipt of a SIP INVITE request containing speech and video Codecs
(signal 1 in figure E.2.3.1.1.1) the Interworking Node (consisting of MGCF and
IM-MGW) starts the call set-up for multimedia call at the CS side by sending
an IAM requesting an UDI bearer (signal 2 in figure E.2.3.1.1.1).
If SDP local preconditions, which are not yet met, are contained in signal 1,
the Interworking node should immediately send an SDP answer to allow for the
IMS-side bearer set-up to progress. The Interworking node selects codecs
supported by the IM-MGW and likely to be supported within the CS network and
communicates the selected codecs towards the IMS side within an SDP answer
message (signal 3 in figure E.2.3.1.1.1). If theses codecs are contained in
the SDP offer, the Interworking Node should select the H.263 codec and may
select other codec from the SDP offer in addition. The interworking node
should include a b:AS bandwidth modifier with a bandwidth suitable for the
selected codec(s), but not higher than 64kbit/s plus RTP/UDP/IP overhead, in
the SDP answer to request that the peer does not send media with a higher
bandwidth.
The Interworking Node shall engage in an H.223 bearer setup (step 6 in figure
E.2.3.1.1.1). If the interworking Node supports MONA (Media Oriented
Negotiation Acceleration), it shall first attempt a MONA Channel establishment
method negotiation according to Annex K of ITU-T Recommendation H.324 [81]. If
the interworking node does not support MONA, it shall use the multiplexing
level negotiation procedures of Annex C of H.324 [81]. If the Interworking
Node supports MONA, but the remote peer does not do so, a fallback to the
multiplexing level negotiation procedures of Annex C of H.324 [81] will occur.
If both the Interworking Node and the remote CS terminal support MONA
procedures, the MONA procedures as per ITU-T Recommendation H.324 Annex K [81]
may be used to replace the H.245 negotiation (signals 7 -- 9) as shown in
figure E.2.3.1.1.1.
If MONA procedures are not used, the following applies:
\- After the completion of the H.223 bearer setup at the CS side, the
Interworking Node shall send a Terminal Capability Set message describing its
own capabilities (signal 7 in figure E.2.3.1.1.1). Unless the Interworking
Node supports transcoding, the Interworking Node shall only send codecs that
have been offered at the IM CN subsystem side (as received in signal 1 in
figure E.2.3.1.1.1) within this message.
\- The Interworking Node will receive an H.245 Terminal Capability Set message
describing the supported Codecs at the peer\'s side (signal 8 in figure
E.2.3.1.1.1).
\- The codecs contained both in the sent and received terminal capability set
messages may be selected at the CS side. The final decision of the selected
codecs at the CS side is taken when the H.245 open logical Channels message
(signal 9 in figure E.2.3.1.1.1) is sent or received. The direction of this
message is determined by the H.245 master-slave determination procedure.
If the Interworking Node does not transcode, it should indicate the codecs
selected within the H.245 negotiation (signal 11 in figure E.2.3.1.1.1) or
within the MONA procedures and enable any media that have previously been put
on hold at the IMS side after the completion of the H.245 negotiation or MONA
procedures.
The interworking node should include in step 11 of figure E.2.3.1.1.1 the SDP
\"a\" attribute \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\" indicating the maximum SDU size of the
application data that can be transmitted to the receiver without segmentation,
as specified in clause 12.2.4.6 of TS 26.114 [104].
### E.2.3.2 Preconditions not used at IMS side
#### E.2.3.2.1 Interactions between H.245 or MONA and SIP/SDP
Figure E.2.3.2.1.1 shows examples of interactions between H.245 or MONA
procedures and SIP/SDP for IM CN subsystem originated session. Most SIP and
ISUP or BICC messages are intentionally omitted, since the SDP may be embedded
in various SIP messages and since the in‑band H.245 Messages are not tightly
coupled with out-of-band ISUP or BICC messages.
Figure E.2.3.2.1.1 assumes that the IMS peer does not use the SIP precondition
extension.
Figure E.2.3.2.1.1 Interactions between H.245 and SIP/SDP for IM CN subsystem
originated session\ IMS peer does not use SIP preconditions.
Upon receipt of a SIP INVITE request containing speech and video Codecs
(signal 1 in figure E.2.3.2.1.1) the Interworking Node (consisting of MGCF and
IM-MGW) starts the call set-up for multimedia call at the CS side by sending
an IAM requesting an UDI bearer (signal 2 in figure E.2.3.2.1.1).
If no unmet local SDP preconditions are contained in signal 1, the
Interworking node should defer sending an SDP answer until the H.245
negotiation or MONA procedures is/are completed.
The Interworking Node shall engage in an H.223 bearer setup (step 5 in figure
E.2.3.2.1.1). If the interworking Node supports MONA (Media Oriented
Negotiation Acceleration), it shall first attempt a MONA Channel establishment
method negotiation according to Annex K of ITU-T Recommendation H.324 [81]. If
the interworking node does not support MONA, it shall use the multiplexing
level negotiation procedures of Annex C of H.324 [81]. If the Interworking
Node supports MONA, but the remote peer does not do so, a fallback to the
multiplexing level negotiation procedures of Annex C of H.324 [81] will occur.
If both the Interworking Node and the remote CS terminal support MONA
procedures, the MONA procedures as per ITU-T Recommenation H.324 [81] Annex K
may be used to replace the H.245 negotiation (signals 6 -- 8) as shown in
figure E.2.3.2.1.1.
If MONA procedures are not used, the following applies:
\- After the completion of the H.223 bearer setup at the CS side, the
Interworking Node shall send a Terminal Capability Set message describing its
own capabilities (signal 6 in figure E.2.3.2.1.1). Unless the Interworking
Node supports transcoding, the Interworking Node shall only send codecs that
have been offered at the IM CN subsystem side (as received in signal 1 in
figure E.2.3.2.1.1) within this message.
\- The Interworking Node will receive an H.245 Terminal Capability Set message
describing the supported Codecs at the peer\'s side (signal 7 in figure
E.2.3.2.1.1).
\- The codecs contained both in the sent and received terminal capability set
message may be selected at the CS side. The final decision of the selected
codecs at the CS side is taken when the H.245 open logical Channels message
(signal 8 in figure E.2.3.2.1.1) is sent or received. The direction of this
message is determined by the H.245 master-slave determination procedure.
If the Interworking Node does not transcode, it shall send an SDP answer
(signal 9 in figure E.2.3.2.1.1) indicating the codecs selected within the
H.245 negotiation or within the MONA procedures after the completion of the
H.245 negotiation or MONA procedures. The interworking node should include a
b:AS bandwidth modifier with a bandwidth suitable for the selected codec(s),
but not higher than 64kbit/s plus RTP/UDP/IP overhead, in the SDP answer to
request that the peer does not send media with a higher bandwidth.
The interworking node should include in Step 9 of figure E.2.3.2.1.1 the SDP
\"a\" attribute \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\" indicating the maximum SDU size of the
application data that can be transmitted to the receiver without segmentation,
as specified in clause 12.2.4.6 of TS 26.114 [104].
### E.2.3.3 Fallback to speech at session establishment
If SCUDIF Fallback (see TS 23.172 [121]) occurs on the CS side, the APM
message contains a speech codec as \"Selected Codec\". The MGCF shall then
disable the video \"m-line\" in the first SDP answer, if not yet sent, and
complete the call-setup in the same way as for a normal speech call. If the
SDP answer was already sent (precondition used), the MGCF shall update the SIP
session to speech by sending a SIP UPDATE message with a relevant SDP.
If in a non-SCUDIF case (ISUP or BICC without SCUDIF) the called CS terminal
or network rejects the video call setup by sending a REL message to the MGCF,
the MGCF releases the CS video call being established, re-establishes the CS
call in a speech only mode sending a new IAM with a speech BCIE to the CS
network and updates the IM CN leg codecs to a speech only codec. Then the
call/session continues as in a speech only case. If the interworking node does
not support the fallback, it shall release the session.
## E.2.4 CS network originated session
### E.2.4.1 Interactions between SIP/SDP and H.245 or MONA
#### E.2.4.1.1 Normal Call setup
Figure E.2.4.1.1 shows examples of interactions between H.245 or MONA and
SIP/SDP for the CS network originated session. Most SIP and ISUP or BICC
messages are intentionally omitted, since the SDP may be embedded in various
SIP messages and since the in‑band H.245 Messages are not tightly coupled with
out-of-band ISUP or BICC messages.
NOTE: Messages 3 and 5 may be combined in some scenarios.
Figure E.2.4.1.1: Interactions between H.245 and SIP/SDP for CS network
originated session
Upon receipt of an IAM request for a multimedia Call (signal 1 in figure
E.2.4.1.1) the Interworking Node (consisting of MGCF and IM-MGW) starts the
call set-up for multimedia call at the IM CN subsystem side by sending an
INVITE request (signal 2 in figure E.2.4.1.1). For the INVITE request, the
Interworking Node selects codecs supported by the IM-MGW and likely to be
supported within the CS Network. The Interworking Node should select the H.263
codec and may select other codec in addition. The interworking node should add
a b:AS bandwidth modifier with a bandwidth suitable for the selected codec(s),
but not higher than 64kbit/s plus RTP/UDP/IP overhead, in the SDP offer to
request that the peer does not send media with a higher bandwidth.
NOTE: The SDP coding to express that either a combined voice and video call,
or a voice call, or a Clearmode codec, or some other data call is desired is
not defined in the present release.
The Interworking Node shall engage in an H.223 bearer setup (step 7 in figure
E.2.4.1.1). If the interworking Node supports MONA (Media Oriented Negotiation
Acceleration), it shall first attempt a MONA Channel establishment method
negotiation according to Annex K of ITU-T Recommendation H.324 [81]. If the
interworking node does not support MONA, it shall use the multiplexing level
negotiation procedures of Annex C of H.324 [81]. If the Interworking Node
supports MONA, but the remote peer does not do so, a fallback to the
multiplexing level negotiation procedures of Annex C of H.324 [81] will occur.
If both the Interworking Node and the remote CS terminal support MONA
procedures, the MONA procedures as per ITU-T Recommendation H.324 [81] Annex K
may be used to replace the H.245 negotiation (signals 8, 11 and 12) as shown
in figure E.2.4.1.1. Furthermore, the SIP codec renegotiation in signals 9 and
10 is then also not applicable.
If MONA procedures are not used, the following applies:
\- After the completion of the H.223 bearer setup at the CS side the
Interworking Node will receive a H.245 Terminal Capability Set message
describing the supported Codecs at the peer\'s side (signal 8 in figure
E.2.4.1.1).
\- Due to information received in a Terminal Capability Set message (signal 8
in figure E.2.4.1.1), the Interworking node may send an SDP offer at the IMS
side (signal 9 in figure E.2.4.1.1), to offer additional codecs supported at
the CS side but not contained in the first SDP offer (signal 2 in figure
E.2.4.1.1), or to restrict the selected codecs at the IMS side to codecs which
are available at the CS side.
NOTE: It is not clear if the addition of codecs not included in previous SDP
exchange has any impacts on IMS procedures, e.g. resource reservation related
procedures.
\- The Interworking Node shall send a Terminal Capability Set message
describing its own capabilities (signal 11 in figure E.2.4.1.1). Unless the
Interworking Node supports transcoding, the Interworking node shall only send
codecs that are also negotiated at the IM CN subsystem side (as received in
signal 3 in figure E.2.4.1.1) within this message. The Interworking Node may
defer sending the Terminal Capability Set message for some time to attempt to
receive the peer\'s Terminal Capability set message and perform a possible
IMS-side codec re-negotiation. However, to avoid blocking situations, the
Interworking Node shall not defer sending the Terminal Capability Set message
for an excessive period of time.
\- The codecs contained both in the sent and received Terminal Capability Set
message may be selected at the CS side. The final decision of the selected
codecs at the CS side is taken when the H.245 open logical Channels message
(signal 12 in figure E.2.4.1.1) is sent or received. The direction of this
message is determined by the H.245 master-slave determination procedure.
If the Interworking Node does not transcode, it should indicate the codecs
selected within the H.245 negotiation or within MONA procedures after the
completion of the H.245 negotiation (signal 13 in figure E.2.4.1.1) or MONA
procedures.
The interworking node should include in Step 11 of figure E.2.4.1.1 the SDP
\"a\" attribute \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\" indicating the maximum SDU size of the
application data that can be transmitted to the receiver without segmentation,
as specified in clause 12.2.4.6 of TS 26.114 [104].
#### E.2.4.1.2 Call setup if multimedia call can not be recognized in an
unambiguous manner
If the Interworking Node is not able to determine from the information within
the IAM request whether a multimedia call or some other type of data call is
requested (for example, if only TMR=UDI but no BC IE is contained in the IAM),
the Interworking Node may also include appropriate codecs for other possible
types of data call it supports in the INVITE request. If video and audio
codecs are contained in the first SDP answer (signal 3), the Interworking Node
should continue to attempt to set up a multimedia call as described in clause
E.2.4.1.1. Otherwise, calls are set up as described in clause 7.2.3.2.
#### E.2.4.1.3 Fallback to speech during call setup
The called party can reject the video component in the SDP offer (signal 2 in
figure E.2.4.1.1) by returning an SDP answer where the video related m-line is
disabled (in signal 3 in figure E.2.4.1.1).
If the MGCF receives an SDP answer during call setup where the video related
m-line is disabled, it shall react as follows:
\- If the MGCF has received a SCUDIF call setup from the CS side (MuMe and
speech codecs in IAM message, see TS 23.172 [121]), the MGCF shall apply a
SCUDIF fallback to speech on the CS side. The MGCF shall use a speech codec as
Selected Codec and exclude the MuMe codec from the available codec list.
\- If the MGCF has received a multimedia call setup without SCUDIF from the CS
side, and the CS network supports CS fallback, the MGCF should terminate the
call.
NOTE 1: A call termination can trigger the caller\'s device to set up a new
speech call.
NOTE 2: Other procedures to maintain the CS call, e.g. disabling the video
component on the CS side or providing a suitable video announcement and
discarding received video media from the CS side, are FFS.
### E.2.4.2 CS originated - IM CN transit - CS terminated
Figure E.2.4.2.1 describes ISUP and SIP/SDP interactions in a CS originated -
IM CN transit - CS terminated case with a clear channel through the IM CN. An
interworking node A receives an IAM message with a UDI H.223 & H.245 video
call request (message 1). If the interworking node A supports both CS/IMS
video interworking and a clearmode codec / clear channel, it may send both
audio and video codecs and a clearmode codec and a UDI & H.223 & H.245 video
indication in the INVITE message towards the IMS (message 2). The message is
received by an interworking node B. The interworking node B sends an IAM
message with a UDI & H.223 & H.245 video call request to the terminating CS
network (message 3). If the interworking node B supports a clearmode codec /
clear channel, it may send a SIP response with a clearmode codec towards the
calling side to indicate that a clear channel can be established between the
IMS interworking nodes (message 5). After the called party answers, the
interworking node B sends a SIP 200 OK (Invite) with the clearmode codec to
the calling node to indicate that a clear channel can be established (message
11). After the called party has answered the call, either MONA procedures are
performed and the H.223 bearer is established or the H.223 bearer is
established and the H.245 signalling is performed (step 14 in figure
E.2.4.2.1).
If the interworking node A does not support CS-IMS video interworking, but
supports a clearmode codec / clear channel, it sends the INVITE message with a
clearmode codec and UDI & H.223 & H.245 indication, but without a video codec,
to allow the establishment of a CS video call through a clear channel. The
interworking node A may also send an audio codec (alone or with a clearmode
codec) to allow a fallback to speech. The interworking node B either accepts
the clearmode and sends the corresponding IAM message with a UDI & H.223 &
H.245 request (message 3) and SIP response with a clearmode codec (message 5
or 11), or accepts the speech mode and sends the corresponding IAM message
with a speech request (message 3) and SIP response with a speech codec
(messages 5, 11), or rejects the INVITE message if the requested codec(s)
cannot be supported.
The format of the indication of UDI & H.223 & H.245 from interworking node A
to interworking node B is defined in Annex F \"PSTN XML Scheme\". UDI & H.223
& H.245 indication is conveyed in PSTN XML body within \"BearerCapabilty\"
(\"InformationTransferCapability\" and \"UserInfoLayerProtocol\") and
\"LowLayerCompatibility\" elements. Elements are defined in ETSI EN 300 403‑1
(V1.3.2) [96] section 4.5.5 and in ISUP transported in the ATP is in
Q.761-Q.764 [4] section 3.5.

Figure E.2.5.2.1.1.1.1 shows an IM CN subsystem originated modification from
multimedia to speech during an ongoing session when the CS leg supports BICC.
The interworking node receives an INVITE message that indicates the dropping
of the video media from the session, message 1. The interworking node can only
accept the dropping of the media component and sends a corresponding codec
modification request to the BICC network, message 2, and acknowledges the
INVITE with a 200 OK message. The BICC network indicates a successful codec
modification, message 5.

speech to multimedia during an ongoing session when the CS leg supports BICC.
The interworking node receives an INVITE message that offers the adding of a
video media to the ongoing speech session, message 1. The interworking node
accepts the offer and sends a corresponding codec modification request to the
BICC network, message 2. The BICC network indicates a successful codec
modification, message 3. The interworking node acknowledges the INVITE with a
200 OK message after the MONA or H.245 in‑band negotiation in step 4 is
completed.
If the codec modification is not successful in the BICC network, the
interworking node responds to the INVITE message with the speech codec in the

interworking node receives a Modify Codec message that indicates the adding of
a video media to the ongoing speech session, message 1. The interworking node
accepts the offer and sends a corresponding INVITE message to the IM CN
subsystem, message 2. The IM CN subsystem acknowledges the INVITE adding the
video media with a 200 OK, message 3, and acknowledges the codec modification
request to the BICC network, message 4. The interworking node may have to
update the codecs, messages 7 and 8, after the MONA or H.245 in‑band
negotiation in step 6.
If the IM CN subsystem does not accept the addition of the video media to the

the video component to send an announcement to the CS terminal to inform the
user about the change of the end-to-end connection to audio only. Refer to
figure E.2.5.2.2.1.1.

## E.2.6 Call release
### E.2.6.1 Call release initiated from the IM CN subsystem side
When the MGCF has received a BYE message (signal 1 in figure E.2.6.1.1) from
the IM CN subsystem side, the MGCF may end the H.245 session between the IM-
MGW and the CS network side (signal 3 in figure E.2.6.1.1) firstly.
NOTE: A call release using only ISUP/BICC signalling at the CS side proceeds
faster. H.324 terminals can handle situations where they do not receive H.245
call release signalling (see clause 7.5.2 of ITU-T Recommendation H.324 [81]),
and this scenario also occurs e.g. at loss of coverage or when a node
transporting H.223 transparently releases the call.
The procedure of ending the H.245 session is defined in the clause E.4. After
receiving the BYE message, the MGCF shall also send a 200 OK [BYE] message
(signal 2 in figure E.2.6.1.1) towards the IM CN subsystem.
After ending the H.245 session, the MGCF shall send a REL message (signal 4 in
figure E.2.6.1.1) to the succeeding node. If the IM CN subsystem interworks
with ISUP based CS network, the interworking node shall release the resources
for the IMS side and the CS network side (signal 6 in figure E.2.6.1.1) after
sending the REL message. If the IM CN subsystem interworks with BICC based CS
network, the interworking node shall release the resources for the IMS side
and the CS network side (signal 6 in figure E.2.6.1.1) upon receiving the RLC
message (signal 5 in figure E.2.6.1.1) from the CS network side. The
procedures of releasing the resources for the IMS side and the CS network side
are specified in the present TS in clause 7.
Figure E.2.6.1.1 shows the message sequence chart for the multimedia call
release initiated from the IM CN subsystem side.
NOTE: Signal 7 is omitted when IM CN subsystem interworks with BICC based CS
network and Signal 5 is omitted when IM CN subsystem interworks with ISUP
based CS network.
Figure E.2.6.1.1: Call release initiated from the IM CN subsystem side
### E.2.6.2 Call release initiated from the CS network side
If the CS network side initiates the call release, it possibly ends the H.245
session with explicit signalling (signal 1 in figure E.2.6.2.1). The CS
network side sends a REL message (signal 2 in figure E.2.6.2.1) towards the IM
CN subsystem. The procedure of ending the H.245 session is defined in the
clause E.4.
When the MGCF receives a REL message (signal 2 in figure E.2.6.2.1) from the
preceding node, the MGCF sends a BYE message (signal 3 in figure E.2.6.2.1) to
the IM CN subsystem. After receiving the REL message, the interworking node
also releases the resources for the IMS side and the CS network side (signal 4
in figure E.2.6.2.1). The procedure of the releasing the resources for the IMS
side and the CS network side are specified in the present TS in clause 7.
After completion of resource release, the MGCF sends a RLC message (signal 5
in figure E.2.6.2.1) towards the preceding node. Figure E.2.6.2.1 shows the
message sequence chart for the multimedia call release initiated from the CS
network side.
Figure E.2.6.2.1: Call release initiated from the CS network side
### E.2.6.3 Call release initiated from the interworking node
The interworking node may end the H.245 session between the IM-MGW and the CS
network side (signal 1 in figure E.2.6.3.1) firstly. The procedure of ending
the H.245 session is defined in the clause E.4.
NOTE: A Call Release using only SIP and ISUP/BICC signalling may proceed
faster. H.324 terminals can handle situations where they do not receive H.245
call release signalling (see clause 7.5.2 of ITU-T Recommendation H.324 [81]),
and this scenario also occurs e.g. at loss of coverage or when a node
transporting H.223 transparently releases the call.
To release the call, the MGCF shall send a REL message (signal 2 in figure
E.2.6.3.1) to the succeeding node on the CS network side. The MGCF shall also
send a BYE message (signal 3 in figure E.2.6.3.1) to the IM CN subsystem side.
If the IM CN subsystem interworks with ISUP based CS network, the interworking
node shall release the resources for the IMS side and the CS network side
(signal 5 in figure E.2.6.3.1) after sending the REL message. If the IM CN
subsystem interworks with BICC based CS network, the interworking node shall
release the resources for the IMS side and the CS network side upon receiving
the RLC message (signal 4 in figure E.2.6.3.1) from the CS network side. The
procedures of releasing the resources for the IMS side and the CS network side
are specified in the present TS in clause 7. Figure E.2.6.3.1 shows the
message sequence chart for the multimedia call release initiated from the
interworking node.

# E.3 User plane interworking
## E.3.1 Functionalities required in the IM-MGW for multimedia calls support
To enable a multimedia Interworking, the IM-MGW needs to support the reframing
of the H.263 video codec and the AMR audio codec between CS transport and PS
transport as a minimum. The IM-MGW may also support the reframing of other
codecs and the transcoding of audio and/or video codecs.
At the CS side, the IM-MGW needs to terminate the H.223 protocol and multiplex
/ de-multiplex audio, video and H.245 signalling. How H.245 related
information (e.g. H.245 messages or extracted information) is communicated
between the MGCF and the IM-MGW is described in clause E.4.
# E.4 MGCF and IM-MGW interactions
## E.4.1 Introduction
This clause describes requirements for extensions to the Mn interface protocol
in TS 29.332 [15] needed to support the Interworking of multimedia calls.
ITU-T Recommendation H.248.1 [2] is used at the Mn interface.
The H.245 signalling shall be handled by the MGCF. Upon reception of the H.245
messages from the CS side at the IM-MGW, the IM-MGW shall forward those H.245
messages as binary data within H.248 messages over the Mn interface towards
the MGCF. Upon reception of encapsulated binary H.245 messages within H.248
messages, the IM-MGW shall forward those H.245 messages towards the CS side.
NOTE: Procedures to support MONA (see Annex K of ITU-T Recommendation H.324
[81]) over the Mn interface are not defined in the present Release.
Furthermore, the signalling flows in clause E.2 may not show MONA related
signalling in sufficient detail for MONA related Mn interface interactions.
## E.4.2 Mn signalling interactions
### E.4.2.1 Introduction
The following clauses describe the Mn interface procedures triggered by H.245
signalling received in the IM-MGW and SIP and RTCP and BICC or ISUP signalling
received in the MGCF.
All message sequence charts in these clauses are examples.
### E.4.2.2 H.248 Context Model
The H.248 context model depicted in figure E.4.2.2.1 shall be applied for
Multimedia Interworking.
Figure E.4.2.2.1: H.248 Context Model for Multimedia Interworking
### E.4.2.3 Transport of H.245 messages between the MGCF and IM-MGW
#### E.4.2.3.1 General
H.245 messages shall be transported between the IM-MGW and MGCF over the Mn
interface using H.248 Events (from the IM‑MGW towards the MGCF) and H.248
Signals (from the MGCF towards the IM-MGW). The Events/Signals shall contain
the following information:
\- H.245 message (binary).
#### E.4.2.3.2 Transport from MGCF to IM-MGW
Figure E.4.2.3.2.1: Mn signalling interactions for sending H.245 message
In Signal 1, the MGCF requests the IM-MGW to send an H.245 message to the CS
side. To request the IM-MGW to send a H.245 message to the CS side, the MGCF
shall sent an H.248 signal to the IM-MGW with the complete H.245 message
content.
NOTE: In order for this command to succeed, Termination T1 towards the CS side
needs to be configured. If a sending of an H.245 message and a removal of
termination T1 is desired, the MGCF needs to apply signal 1 before removing
T1.
Upon reception of this signal, the IM-MGW shall send the encapsulated H.245
message within the H.248 signal, through the H.245 control channel to the CS
side (signal 3).
#### E.4.2.3.3 Transport from IM-MGW to MGCF
Figure E.4.2.3.3.1: Mn signalling interactions for receiving H.245 message
In signal 1, the MGCF requests the IM-MGW to detect received H.245 message
from the CS side and forward them to the MGCF. To request the IM-MGW to detect
and forward a H.245 message to the CS side, the MGCF shall send a suitable
H.248 event to the IM-MGW. The event may be indicated through an H.248 ADD
command.
In signal 3, the IM-MGW receives an H.245 message from the CS side. Upon
reception of an H.245 message from the CS side, the IM-MGW shall de-multiplex
the H.245 message from the H.223 stream and forward the H.245 message to the
MGCF within an H.248 Notify command (signal 4).
### E.4.2.4 Call establishment procedure
The following information shall be provided from the MGCF towards the IM-MGW:
\- Properties to start H.223 Negotiation.
\- Request for events for Notification of H.245 message received by the IM-
MGW.
\- Signals to provide H.245 messages that the IM-MGW shall send towards the CS
side.
\- Properties to provide incoming and outgoing H.223 multiplex table.
\- Properties to provide H.223 logical channel parameters.
\- Property to provide remote H.223 capabilities.
The Highest Multiplexing Level shall be predefined in the IM-MGW.
NOTE 1: All H.245 messages (from Signal 9 to Signal 18) are transported
through the IM-MGW between the MGCF and the CS side, using the procedures
described in clause E.4.2.3
NOTE 2: Signals 21 and 22 are omitted if the same codec information has
already been provisioned in signal 3.
Figure E.4.2.4.1: Mn signalling interactions for H.245 termination at the MGCF
The MGCF shall request terminations towards the CS network (Signal 1 and 2)
and towards the IMS (Signal 3 and 4). For the terminations towards the IMS,
the MGCF provides an estimate about the applicable codecs in the required
information elements \"Local IMS Resources\" (for both \"Reserve IMS
Connection Point\" procedure and \"Reserve IMS Connection Point and Configure
Remote Resources\" procedure) and possibly \"Remote IMS Resources\" (only for
\"Reserve IMS Connection Point and Configure Remote Resources\" procedure).
The MGCF shall request that the H.223 stream is (de-)multiplexed at the MUX
termination T2, and that the H.245 control in H.223 Logical channel 0 is
separated (signal 6). Furthermore, the MGCF shall request that the H.223
negotiation is started, and shall request to be notified about all H.245
messages received by the IM-MGW.
The IM-MGW shall start the H.223 Multiplexing Level Negotiation after receipt
of the corresponding request from the MGCF and CS bearer establishment (Signal
8).
Upon reception of a H.245 Terminal Capability Set message (Signal 9), the MGCF
sends a H.245 Acknowledgment message (Signal 10).
The MGCF shall know the H.324 related capabilities of the IM-MGW before
starting the H.245 capability negotiation with the CS side, e.g. through
configuration. The H.245 Terminal Capability Set message send by the MGCF
(Signal 11) should include the codecs which are supported by both the IMS side
and the IM-MGW, and the codecs which could be transcoded by the IM-MGW from
the codecs supported by the IMS side.
The MGCF may defer sending the Terminal Capability Set message (Signal 11) for
some time to wait for codec information from the CS peer\'s Terminal
Capability Set message and perform a possible IMS-side codec re-negotiation.
To avoid blocking situations, the MGCF shall not defer sending the signal for
an excessive period of time.
To avoid the CS side selecting the codecs that need to be transcoded at the
IM-MGW, the MGCF should aim to be the master in the H.245 master-slave
determination procedure (Signals 9 to 12). The MGCF shall set the Terminal
Type parameter as a number larger than 128 in the H.245 Master Slave
Determination message. The H.245 master-slave determination procedure could be
combined with the messages used for the H.245 capability exchange.
The codecs contained both in the sent and received terminal capability set
message may be selected at the CS side. The final decision of the selected
codecs at the CS side is taken with the H.245 open logical channel procedure
(Signals 13 to 16).
After the completion of the H.245 multiplex table exchange procedure (Signals
17 to 20), the MGCF shall configure the multiplexing termination T2 by
indicating to the IM-MGW the contents of the incoming and outgoing multiplex
tables (Signal 21).
If codec information needs to be changed compared to what has been provisioned
in signal 3, the MGCF shall also configure T3 with the appropriate video
and/or speech codec(s) (signal 23).
The call is in the active state.
### E.4.2.5 Handling of H.245 indication message
#### E.4.2.5.1 Overview
The MGCF shall support the following H.245 indication messages: Function Not
Understood Indication / Function Not Supported Indication, Jitter Indication.
The MGCF may support the H.245 User Input Indication message. All these H.245
messages are conveyed between the MGCF and the CS side through the IM-MGW, as
described in clause E.4.2.3.
#### E.4.2.5.2 Function Not Understood / Function Not Supported message
This indication message is used to return requests, responses and commands
that are not understood back to the transmitter.
If the MGCF receives a Function Not Understood or Function Not Supported
message from the CS side, the MGCF may choose to attempt simpler H.245
interaction than the previous H.245 interaction that caused this indication.
If this is not possible, the MGCF may release the call.
If the MGCF receives a H.245 request, response or command that can not be
understood, the MGCF shall send H.245 Function Not Supported indication
message to the CS side.
#### E.4.2.5.3 User Input Indication message
The User-Input-Indication message is used e.g. to transport the in-band DTMF
information in the H.324 system.
The MGCF and IM-MGW may support transporting the DTMF information both from
the CS side to the IMS side, and from the IMS side to the CS side.
Upon Receipt of a H.245 User-Input-Indication message, the MGCF may apply the
procedures in clause 9.2.8.3 to request the IM-MGW to send corresponding RTP
telephone-event(s) towards the IMS side.
Upon receipt of RTP telephone events from the IMS, the MGCF will be notified
by the IM-MGW using the procedures in clause 9.2.8.1, if the MGCF has
previously configured the IM-MGW as also described in this subclause. Upon
receipt of the notification, the MGCF may send a H.245 User-Input-Indication
message to the CS side.
### E.4.2.6 Handling of H.245 Command message
#### E.4.2.6.1 Overview
The MGCF shall support the End Session command message. The MGCF may support
the Flow Control command message and the videoFastUpdatePicture message. All
these H.245 messages are conveyed between the MGCF and the CS side by the IM-
MGW, as described in clause E.4.2.3.
#### E.4.2.6.2 Flow control command
The flow control command is used to restrict the upper limit of bit rate of
either a single logical channel or the whole multiplex stream. The MGCF may
support the flow control command received from the CS side.
NOTE: It is very unlikely that the MGCF will receive a Flow control command,
as the capability of controlling the video bit rate during a video call was
neither implemented nor tested for UEs offering 3G-324M since R99, due to the
lack of such a necessity in WCDMA where a fixed 64 kbps bearer is maintained
to continuously transport 3G-324M PDUs.

Figure E.4.2.6.2.1: Mn procedure of Flow control command
In Signal 1, the MGCF receives the Flow Control Command from the CS side.
If the minimum bitrate of the current codec is larger than the bitrate
requested by the H.245 Flow Control Command message, the MGCF indicates the
IM-MGW to stop the transmission of the media stream over the logical channel
(signal 2). Then the MGCF may select another codec that can satisfy the
requested bitrate limit. In signal 4, the MGCF closes the old logical channel
and opens a new logical channel with new codec to satisfy the bitrate limit in
the CS side. In signal 6, the MGCF indicates the IM-MGW to modify the LCN,
codec and stream mode of the multiplexing termination. In signal 8, the MGCF
sends flow control indication message to CS side with the current maximum
bitrate. If the MGCF chooses to change the CS-side codec, the MGCF may also
adjust the codec at the IMS side accordingly. To do so, the MGCF may need to
re-negotiate the codec at the IMS side using a SIP re-INVITE message (signals
9 and 10). In addition, the MGCF may modify the codec of IMS termination
accordingly (signal 11).
The MGCF may also apply interworking procedure towards RTCP at the IMS side as
described in clause E.4.2.8 when receiving a H.245 Flow Control Command.
#### E.4.2.6.3 End Session Command
The end session command is used to close the H.245 control channel after all
the logical channels have been closed.
The MGCF may send an end session command to the CS side through the IM-MGW to
release a call.
If the MGCF receives an end session command from the CS side, it shall release
the call if the call is in the active state.
#### E.4.2.6.4 videoFastUpdatePicture
The MGCF may apply interworking procedure towards RTCP as described in clause
E.4.2.8 when receiving a H.245 videoFastUpdatePicture message. The MGCF may
also be triggered by the procedures in clause E.4.2.8 to send a H.245
videoFastUpdatePicture message.
When receiving frequent H.245 videoFastUpdatePicture messages for a SCUDIF
call (see TS 23.172 [121]), an MGCF should initiate a service-change from
multimedia to speech and remove the IMS MTSI video component with SIP/SDP
signalling. When receiving frequent H.245 videoFastUpdatePicture messages for
a non-SCUDIF call, an MGCF should disable the CS video and remove the IMS MTSI
video component with SIP/SDP signalling.
NOTE: In a congestion situation at the IMS side, frequent packet losses might
occur and dropping the video component may serve as a counter-measure to
reduce the packet loss frequency. However, CS terminals might not be able to
initiate such a switch-over to voice, but might rather react with repeated
H.245 videoFastUpdatePicture message.
### E.4.2.7 Mn Signalling Interactions to support the Media Oriented
Negotiation Acceleration (MONA)
#### E.4.2.7.1 Overview
Media Oriented Negotiation Acceleration (MONA), as specified in ITU-T H.324
[81] provides simplified procedures that allow for a faster call set-up of a
H.324 Multimedia call than standard H.324 procedures, and also allow for a
fallback to standard H.324 procedures if either party does not support the
enhanced procedures.
The support of MONA is optional for an IM-MGW and MGCF supporting multimedia
interworking, as no call failure but only a fallback to standard H.324 setup
procedures will occur if the procedures are not supported.
MONA \"preference message\" signalling is used instead of H.324 Multiplexing
level negotiation. Should standard H.324 Multiplexing level stuffing flags be
received, a fallback to standard H.324 procedures is triggered. The sending of
MONA preference messages is repeated by each MONA capable H.324 terminal until
a reception is acknowledged by the peer. During this phase, two PDU types may
optionally be attached by MONA terminals to these preference messages:
\- Media Preconfigured Channel (MPC) PDUs: MONA defines a small number of
preconfigured H.223 channels for the most widespread audio and video codecs
(AMR, AMR-WB, H.264 MPEG4 and H.263). Media PDUs for these codecs may be
attached to the MONA \"preference message\" during the call setup.
\- Signalling Preconfigured Channel (SPC) PDUs: These PDUs are H.245 generic
request messages with special parameters defined by MONA. These PDUs may also
be attached to MONA preference messages.
According to MONA, each MONA capable terminal shall support at least one of
these PDU types. The MONA capability of the IM-MGW can be audited by the MGCF.
The MONA preference message exchange in combination with attached MPC or SPC
PDUs may result in the establishment of the desired media channels without
further H.245 signalling. Otherwise, H.245 will be used after the MONA
preference message exchange is acknowledged to negotiate media channels, but
MONA defines some accelerated H.245 procedures (ACP) to speed up these H.245
procedures.
The design of Mn procedures to support MONA is guided by the following
considerations:
\- The H.245 handling should be performed in the MGCF to keep procedures
aligned as far as possible with standard Mn procedures to support H.324
interworking.
\- The MGCF should also control MONA preference message exchange procedures in
order to maintain the agreed architectural work split between MGCF and IM-MGW
in analogy to the H.245 handling.
\- However, the IM-MGW needs to understand the MONA preference messages at
least to a sufficient degree to de-encapsulate the possibly attached MPC and
SBC PDUs.
\- Furthermore, the frequent retransmissions of MONA preference messages
required by MONA procedures are to be performed by the IM-MGW autonomously to
avoid unnecessary load at the Mn interface and the MGCF.
\- Furthermore, for resource reservation at the IM-MGW, it is assumed that the
IM-MGW has knowledge about supported predefined Media Preconfigured Channel
configurations as specified in clause K.9.2 of H.324 [81] in order to limit
the amount of information transferred in the Mn interface when establishing
MPC channels. The offered channel resources are reserved by the IM-MGW.
\- In order to avoid increasing call establishment time when interworking with
legacy terminals and at the same time avoid unnecessary load at the Mn
interface, the MGCF may initiate both MONA and legacy H.245 procedures
simultaneously in parallel. The MGCF shall in this case arm a legacy detection
event with an embedded signal descriptor including the initial legacy H.245
message. The IM-MGW will only send the signal in case a fallback condition to
legacy is detected.
#### E.4.2.7.2 Mn Interactions for MONA preference messages
NOTE 1: MONA preference messages are repeated several times. One repetition is
shown for each such message, with the same signal number as the first message.
NOTE 2: The Context model in figure E.4.2.2.1 is assumed in this call flow.
Figure E.4.2.7.2.1: Mn signalling interactions for MONA preference messages
The MGCF shall request terminations towards the CS network (Signal 1 and 2)
and towards the IMS (Signal 3 and 4). For the terminations towards the IMS,
the MGCF provides an estimate about the applicable codecs in the required
information elements \"Local IMS Resources\" (for both \"Reserve IMS
Connection Point\" procedure and \"Reserve IMS Connection Point and Configure
Remote Resources\" procedure) and possibly \"Remote IMS Resources\" (only for
\"Reserve IMS Connection Point and Configure Remote Resources\" procedure).
The MGCF shall request that the H.223 stream is (de-)multiplexed at the MUX
termination T2 (signal 6). Furthermore, the MGCF shall request that MONA
preferences negotiation is started, and shall provision the MONA preferences
to be indicated by the IM-MGW. The MGCF shall encode the MONA preferences as
described in clause K.6 of ITU-T H.324 [81]. The MGCF shall take the H.324
related capabilities of the IM-MGW into account in the MONA preferences. The
MGCF can know these capabilities by configuration. The IM-MGW will only
support symmetric codec usage. If several codec alternatives are offered for
MPC, it is the responsibility of the MGCF to ensure that symmetric codecs are
established by not selecting transmit codec until the receive channel has been
opened by MPC media. The MGCF shall also request to be notified about the
reception of the remote MONA preferences and about the completion of the MONA
preference exchange, or an H.245 message on the H.223 control channel. The
MGCF may also initiate standard H.245 signalling in parallel in order to
minimize the time for a legacy interworking fallback. This is done by arming a
legacy detection event including an embedded signal descriptor. The embedded
signal is the initial H.245 message out signal (including H.245 TCS+MSD) to
send in case fallback to legacy interworking is detected. The IM-MGW will only
send the embedded signal in case it detects H.223 related indications of a
legacy interworking as specified in clause K.7.1.2 in H.324 [81]. Upon
receiving the legacy detected event, the MGCF continues with standard H.245
call setup procedures waiting for the reception of a remote H.245 TCS as well
as acknowledgements on the sent H.245 TCS+MSD. If the MGCF indicates the
capability to receive SPC PDUs within the MONA preferences, it shall also
request to be notified about incoming SPC PDUs, as detailed in clause
E.4.2.7.4. If the MGCF indicates the capability to receive any MPC PDUs within
the MONA preferences, it shall also request to be notified about incoming MPC
PDUs, as detailed in clause E.4.2.7.3.
The IM-MGW shall start sending MONA preference messages after receipt of the
corresponding request from the MGCF and CS bearer establishment (Signal 8).
The IM-MGW shall repeat sending those messages and increment the
acknowledgment bits of sent MONA preference messages when receiving incoming
MONA preference messages according to MONA procedures (signals 8, 10, 14).
After sending at least 10 MONA preference messages, while the IM-MGW continues
to send and receive MONA preference messages, it shall attach MPC or SPC PDUs
if requested to do so by the MGCF as described in clauses E.4.2.7.3 and
E.4.2.7.4, respectively. If the IM-MGW receives preference messages with an
attachment, it shall inspect the first octet of that attachment that will
contain a MUX code according to table K.15 of ITU-T H.324 [81] that identifies
the attached PDU as either a MPC PDU of one of the predefined channels or a
SPC PDU. The IM-MGW shall handle the attached MPC or SPC PDUs as described in
clause E.4.2.7.3 and E.4.2.7.4, respectively.
After sending at least 10 MONA preference messages, the IM-MGW should insert
stuffing flags indicating the multiplexing level received from the MGCF
between MONA preference messages as described in clause K.7.1.1 of ITU-T H.324
[81].
The IM-MGW shall notify the MGCF when receiving the first incoming MONA
preference message (Signals 11 and 12) and forward the received information.
Subsequent incoming MONA preference message will be identical apart from
possible increments in the acknowledgement bits. The IM-MGW shall not notify
the MGCF about these messages. Upon reception of the notification of a MONA
preference message, the MGCF shall compare the received MONA preferences
message with the preferences message it sent and react as described in clause
7.1 of ITU-T H.324 [81].
When receiving an incoming MONA preference message with acknowledgment bits 10
or receiving the first non-empty H.223 MUX PDU, the IM-MGW shall notify the
MGCF about the completion of the MONA preference exchange procedure (signals
16 and 17). The notification shall be only triggered by the one of the two
events which occurs first. If the IM-MGW is not configured to send and detect
SPCs, the IM-MGW shall then stop sending MONA preference messages and, if a
MONA preference message with acknowledgment bits 10 has been received, it
shall also stop receiving MONA preference messages. If the IM-MGW is
configured to send and detect SPCs, the IM-MGW shall continue sending and
receiving MONA Preference messages encapsulating the SPC/MOS messages until
the MGCF configures the IM-MGW stop sending and detecting SPCs.
NOTE: In the unlikely case that a first non-empty H.223 MUX-PDU is received
before the first MONA Preference Message has been received, the IM-MGW will
continue the detection of incoming MONA Preference Messages and will apply the
Notify-MONA-preference-Reception-procedure after the Notify-MONA-preference-
completed procedure.
After receiving the notification about the completion of the MONA preference
exchange procedure, and a completion of the possible subsequent accelerated
H.245 setup procedures, the MGCF shall configure the multiplexing termination
T2 by indicating to the IM-MGW the contents of the incoming and outgoing
multiplex tables (Signal 19), and may modify the selected codecs at both the
MUX and the IMS side (signal 21).
#### E.4.2.7.3 Mn Interactions for MONA MPCs
NOTE 1: MONA preference messages are repeated several times. One repetition is
shown for each such message, with the same signal number as the first message.
NOTE 2: The Context model in figure E.4.2.2.1 is assumed in this call flow.
Figure E.4.2.7.3.1: Mn interactions for MONA MPCs
If the MGCF indicates the ability to receive any predefined MPCs channel types
in the MONA preferences messages, the MGCF shall request the IM-MGW to report
the channel type of received MPC PDUs (Signal 1 in figure E.4.2.7.3.1, Event
\"MPC Reception\").
If the MGCF intends to use MPCs for sending media during the MONA setup, the
MGCF shall request the IM-MGW to send available media encoded according to the
media predefined channel types defined by MONA (signal 1 in figure
E.4.2.7.3.1, Signal \"MPC MUX Code\" ) while the MONA preference exchange
described in clause E.4.2.7.2 is ongoing. The MGCF should select channel types
for codecs which are supported by both the IMS side and the IM-MGW, and/or for
codecs which could be transcoded by the IM-MGW from the codecs supported by
the IMS side. The MGCF shall only include one channel type per each desired
media type (audio, video) in the \"MPC MUX Code\" signal. The MGCF may also
configure the MGW to receive these channels at the same time by supplying the
Incoming Multiplex Table IE in the Add Multiplex Termination Procedure.
Upon reception of this request, the IM-MGW shall forward any media received
from the IMS side in MPC PDUs of the corresponding predefined channel type
attached to MONA preference messages, transcoding the media if required
(Signal 4).
According to the procedures in clause E.4.2.7.2, the IM-MGW will notify the
MGCF (signal 6) when receiving the first incoming MONA preference message
(Signals 5). The MGCF shall then analyse the Media Preconfigured Channel
Receive bits within the MONA preference message and configure the MGW
accordingly:
\- If MPC(s) that the MGCF has previously configured within the \"MPC MUX
Code\" signal are supported according to these bits, the MGCF shall configure
the IM-MGW to send these MPC using the predefined channels (signal 10) by
supplying the corresponding Outgoing Multiplex Table in the Configure
Multiplex Termination procedure (signal 8).
\- If some of the MPC(s) that the MGCF has previously configured within the
\"MPC MUX Code\" signal are not supported according to these bits, the MGCF
shall configure the IM-MGW to terminate the media on those MPC(s) by modifying
the MPC Mux Code signal using the Configure Multiplex Termination procedure.
In addition, the MGCF may configure the IM-MGW to send media on other
supported MPC(s) by supplying the corresponding Outgoing Multiplex Table in
the Configure Multiplex Termination procedure (not shown in figure
E.4.2.7.3.1).
\- If all of the MPC(s) that the MGCF has previously configured within the
\"MPC MUX Code\" signal are not supported according to these bits, the MGCF
shall configure the IM-MGW to terminate MPC operations in those unsupported
channels. The MGCF shall either remove the MPC Mux Code signal using the Stop
MPC procedure or configure the IM-MGW to send media on other supported MPC(s)
by supplying the corresponding Outgoing Multiplex Table in the Configure
Multiplex Termination procedure (not shown in figure E.4.2.7.3.1).
When the MGCF provides an Outgoing Multiplex Table, the IM-MGW shall terminate
sending any MPC PDUs as attachments to MONA preference message.
NOTE: Any previously provisioned \"MPC MUX Code\" signal becomes irrelevant.
When being notified about the receipt of the first incoming MONA preference
message, the MGCF may also analyse the Media Preconfigured Channel Receive
bits within the MONA preference message and configure the MGW with a suitable
Incoming Multiplex Table using the Configure Multiplex Termination procedure
(not shown in figure E.4.2.7.3.1).
If the IM-MGW receives the first MONA preference message with attached MPC PDU
of a given predefined channel type (signal 12), or if the IM-MGW receives the
first non-empty H.223 MUX PDU of a given predefined channel type which has
been configured with the Incoming Multiplex Table, and the MGCF has requested
a notification about such an event, the IM-MGW shall notify the MGCF about the
received channel type (signal 13). The IM-MGW shall not notify the MGCF about
subsequent receptions of MPC PDUs of the same channel type.
Upon reception of such a notification, if the IM-MGW supports the indicated
channel type and has not yet been configured to receive media of that channel
type, and if the MGCF has previously indicated the capability to receive MPCs
of that channel type within MONA preference messages, the MGCF shall configure
the IM-MGW to receive media of that channel type and forward them to the IMS
side by supplying the Incoming Multiplex Table IE in the Configure Multiplex
Termination procedure (Signal 15).
If the MGCF determines (e.g. after receipt of signal 5 or signal 12) that some
desired media channels can not be established using the MPC procedures, the
MGCF should use accelerated H.245 procedures as defined by MONA to set up
media channels. Corresponding H.245 messages shall be transported
transparently between the IM-MGW and the MGCF using the \"Signal H.245
message\" and \"Notify H.245 message\" procedures.
The MGCF can receive a forwarded MONA preference message from the IM-MGW when
the MGCF has already configured the IM-MGW to send media on an MPC. If the
processing of this message in the MGCF leads to the conclusion that MPC
procedures need to be aborted because SPC preferred (SPP) is determined, the
MGCF shall configure the IM-MGW to terminate MPC operations by removing the
MPC related event MPC-reception and MPC Mux Code signal using the Stop MPC
procedure.
#### E.4.2.7.4 Mn Interactions for MONA SPCs
##### E.4.2.7.4.1 General
H.245 PDUs for SPC shall be transported between the IM-MGW and MGCF over the
Mn interface using H.248 Events (from the IM‑MGW towards the MGCF) and H.248
Signals (from the MGCF towards the IM-MGW). The Events/Signals shall contain
the following information:
\- H.245 message (binary).
The related procedures are distinct from the procedures in clause E.4.2.3,
since the PDUs are received or sent by the IM-MGW using the SPC, i.e. as
attachment to MONA preference messages.
If the MGCF supports SPCs, it shall comply with the SPC procedures in clause
K.8 of ITU-T H.324 [81]. The repetition of sending the same SPCs will be
handled by the IM-MGW. When the MGCF receives an acknowledgement from the CS
side it shall request the IM-MGW to stop the repetition sending of the SPCs,
Within the sent SPC PDUs, the MGCF should include the codecs which are
supported by both the IMS side and the IM-MGW, and the codecs which could be
transcoded by the IM-MGW from the codecs supported by the IMS side.
##### E.4.2.7.4.2 Transport from MGCF to IM-MGW
NOTE 1: MONA preference messages are repeated several times. One repetition is
shown for each such message, with the same signal number as the first message.
NOTE 2: The Context model in figure E.4.2.2.1 is assumed in this call flow.
Figure E.4.2.7.4.2.1: Mn interactions for sending MONA SPCs
In Signal 1, the MGCF requests the IM-MGW to send an H.245 message to the CS
side. To request the IM-MGW to send a H.245 message to the CS side, the MGCF
shall sent an H.248 signal to the IM-MGW with the complete H.245 message
content.
Upon reception of this signal, the IM-MGW shall send the encapsulated H.245
message within the H.248 signal, as attachment to a MONA preference message as
described in clause K.9.4 of ITU-T H.324 [81] (signal 3). It should repeat
sending this H.245 message as attachment to subsequent MONA preference
messages.
##### E.4.2.7.4.3 Transport from IM-MGW to MGCF
NOTE 1: MONA preference messages are repeated several times. One repetition is
shown for each such message, with the same signal number as the first message.
NOTE 2: The Context model in figure E.4.2.2.1 is assumed in this call flow.
Figure E.4.2.7.4.3.1: Mn interactions for receiving MONA SPCs
In signal 1, the MGCF requests the IM-MGW to detect received H.245 message
from the CS side in SPC PDUs attached to MONA preference messages and forward
them to the MGCF. To request the IM-MGW to detect and forward these H.245
message, the MGCF shall send a suitable H.248 event to the IM-MGW. The event
may be indicated through an H.248 ADD command.
In signal 3, the IM-MGW receives an H.245 message from the CS side attached as
SPC PDU to a MONA preference message. Upon reception of such an H.245 message
from the CS side, the IM-MGW may check, based on bitwise comparison of the
previously received H.245 message, if it has already forwarded the same H.245
message to the MGCF, in which case the IM-MGW may choose not to forward the
same H.245 message to the MGCF. Otherwise the IM-MGW shall forward the H.245
message to the MGCF within an H.248 Notify command (signal 4).
NOTE: According to H.324 [81] a MOS request Ack message shall be sent to every
received MOS request. If the IM-MGW chooses, based on the bitwise comparison,
not to forward the received H.245 message to the MGCF, no MOS request Ack
message will be generated. However, the MGCF will request the IM-MGW to
automatically retransmit the MOS request Ack message generated by the MGCF
itself.
If the IM-MGW does not support forwarding SPC PDUs or has not been requested
by the MGCF to forward these PDUs, it shall discard received SPC PDUs.
##### E.4.2.7.4.4 Termination of SPC procedure
NOTE 2: The Context model in figure E.4.2.2.1 is assumed in this call flow.
Figure E.4.2.7.4.4.1: Mn interactions for terminating SPC procedure.
If the processing of an incoming MONA Preference Message in the MGCF leads to
the conclusion that SPC procedures need to be aborted as a result of the test
of the SPC bits, the MGCF shall configure the IM-MGW to terminate SPC
operations by removing the SPC related event SPC-reception and SPCout signal
using the Stop SPC procedure. In this case, H.245 signalling may be started
simultaneously.
If the MGCF determines the completion of the SPC procedures according to
clause K.8 of ITU-T H.324 [81] (based on incoming signal 1 in figure
E.4.2.7.4.4.1), the MGCF shall configure the IM-MGW to stop sending and
detecting SPCs (signal 4 in figure E.4.2.7.4.4.1).
#### E.4.2.7.5 Mn Interactions for fallback from MONA procedures to standard
H.324 setup
NOTE 1: MONA preference messages are repeated several times. One repetition is
shown for each such message, with the same signal number as the first message.
NOTE 2: The Context model in figure E.4.2.2.1 is assumed in this call flow.
Figure E.4.2.7.5.1: Mn signalling interactions for fallback from MONA
procedures to standard H.324 setup
When the MGCF requests that the MONA preferences negotiation is started, the
MGCF may also initiate standard H.245 signalling towards the IM-MGW that shall
only be sent in case the IM-MGW detects legacy interworking. The MGCF arms an
event to detect legacy interworking with an embedded signal descriptor
including an H.245 message out signal. The embedded H.245 signal is the
initial H.245 TCS+MSD signal to send in case fallback to legacy interworking
is detected. The MGCF shall also request to be notified about a H.245 message
on the H.223 control channel. The MGCF shall also provision a multiplexing
level which will be advertised by the IM-MGW (Signal 6).
If the IM-MGW detects a legacy interworking condition (signal 9), it shall
stop sending MONA preference messages, including those MONA messages used to
encapsulate MPC or SPC. The IM-MGW shall engage in normal H.324 multiplexing
level negotiations. In case the MGCF armed a legacy detection event, the
embedded H.245 signal shall be sent by the IM-MGW (signal 10). The legacy
detection event is sent to the MGCF (signal 11).
The MGCF shall upon detection of legacy interworking stop MONA procedures and
continue with standard H.245 call set up procedures, as depicted in figure
E.4.2.4.1 starting with step 9.
If the IM-MGW receives a normal H.245 message (not depicted), it shall also
forward this message to the MGCF. If the MGCF receives such a H.245 message
during the MONA call setup, and this H.245 message is a normal Terminal
Capability Set message, the MGCF shall also stop MONA procedures and continue
with standard H.245 call set up procedures, as depicted in figure E.4.2.4.1
starting with step 9.
To stop MONA related procedures at the IM-MGW, the MGCF shall remove the MONA
related signals that were active (MONA Preferences, SPCout, MPC Mux Code; note
that MONA Preference and SPCout causes the MGW to send the MONA Preference
message or the contained H.245 message several times) and events
(MonaPreferenceReception, MonaPreferenceCompleted, SPC-reception and MPC-
reception, using the Stop MONA Negotiation procedure.
### E.4.2.8 Interworking between RTCP messages and H.245 messages
#### E.4.2.8.1 Overview
The following clauses describe the interworking procedures between the RTCP
messages listed in table E.4.2.8.1.1, which are used to enhance the quality of
the media distribution by MTSI terminals at the IMS side, and the
corresponding H.245 messages in 3G-324M at the CS side listed in Table
E.4.2.8.1.1.
As the H.245 protocol is terminated at the MGCF and RTCP is received at the
IM-MGW, Mn procedures to support the transfer of RTCP related information are
defined in the following clauses to support this interworking.
Table E.4.2.8.1.1: RTCP and H.245 messages that may be interworked
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | RTCP Messages | H.245 messages | Remarks | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Picture Loss | Vi | | | Indication (PLI) | deoFastUpdatePicture | | | ([109]) | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Temporary Maximum | Flow Control | This interworking | | Media Stream Bit | Command/ Flow | procedure is not | | Rate Request (TMMBR) | Control Indication | recommended. | | ([110]) | | | | | | The reception of | | | | TMMBR at the IMS | | | | side is expected to | | | | be more frequent | | | | than the reception | | | | of Flow Control | | | | Command at the CS | | | | side. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
NOTE 1: It is very unlikely that the MGCF will receive a Flow control command,
as the capability of controlling the video bit rate during a video call was
neither implemented nor tested for UEs offering 3G-324M since R99, due to the
lack of such a necessity in WCDMA where a fixed 64 kbps bearer is maintained
to continuously transport 3G-324M PDUs.
NOTE 2: Terminals are expected to support receiving the FlowControlCommand, as
this is a mandatory feature in clause 6.4.3 in H.324. But most terminals would
not really follow the received FlowControlCommand, but rather ignore it.
However, for older 3G-324M terminal lock-up or system crash was not uncommon
during IOTs. Therefore safe handling of this command is not guaranteed
absolutely.
The interworking shown in Table E.4.2.8.1.1 is only applicable if video is
relayed without transcoding.
If transcoding is applied, the IM-MGW should adopt its transcoder accordingly
if receiving the RTCP messages listed in Table E.4.2.8.1.1, and the MGCF
should configure the transcoder in the IM-MGW accordingly if it receives the
H.245 messages in Table E.4.2.8.1.1.
For an MGCF and IM-MGW that support video interworking as specified in the
present Annex E, the support of the procedures in the present clause E.4.2.8.2
and E.4.2.8.3 is optional.
#### E.4.2.8.2 IM CN subsystem originated RTCP messages
The MGCF may configure the IM-MGW to detect specific received RTCP packets and
forward information derived from it by providing a bit pattern(s) for bits
3-15 of incoming RTCP packets as filter criterion in an event descriptor of
event \"RTCP-interworking\". Bits 3-7 in the RTCP packet represent the
Feedback message type (FMT), and bits 8-15 in the RTCP packet represent the
Payload type (PT) RTCP header fields, see IETF RFC 4585 [109]. For instance,
to request that an AVPF Picture Loss Indication (PLI) packet is detected for
interworking, the MGCF needs to configure a combination of PT=206 (Payload-
specific FB message) and FMT=1 (see IETF RFC 4585 [109]). To request that a
AVPF Temporary Maximum Media Bit-rate Request (TMMBR) packet is detected for
interworking, the MGCF needs to configure a combination of PT=205 (transport
layer feedback message) and FMT=3 (see IETF RFC 5104 [110]).
A IM-MGW configured in this way shall check after receiving an incoming RTCP
Packet if it is of a desired type, as expressed by a bit pattern received from
the MGCF. An incoming RTCP message can be of compound format and contain
several RTCP packets. The IM-MGW shall then perform the check separately for
each packet. If the IM-MGW determines that the received RTCP packet is of a
desired type, the IM-MGW shall send information derived from the RTCP message
as ObservedEventsDescriptor Parameter(s) of event \"RTCP-interworking\" in an
H.248 \"Notify\" message to the MGCF.
The information derived from the RTCP message to be sent to the MGCF is listed
in table E.4.2.8.2.1. Information elements in table E.4.2.8.2.1 shall only be
sent if the corresponding RTCP message has been received.

IM CN subsystem originated feedback on the quality of the media distribution.
Figure E.4.2.8.2.2.1: Interactions between RTCP and H.245 for IM CN subsystem
originated RTCP feedback on the quality of the media distribution
In signal 1, the MGCF requests the IM-MGW to detect received RTCP feedback
message from the IMS side and notify the feedback information elements to the
MGCF when the interworking is required. To request the IM-MGW to detect and
notify these feedback information elements, the MGCF shall send the \"RTCP-
interworking\" H.248 event to the IM-MGW. The event may be indicated through
an H.248 MOD command.
In signal 3, the IM-MGW receives a RTCP feedback message from the IMS side.
In signal5, the IM-MGW notifies the feedback information elements from RTCP
message to the MGCF.
In signal7, the MGCF send the corresponding H.245 message to the CS side to
request for the media adaption.
#### E.4.2.8.3 CS network originated H.245 messages
Figure E.4.2.8.3.2.1 shows examples of interactions between H.245 and RTCP for
CS network originated feedback on the quality of the media distribution.
Figure E.4.2.8.3.2.1: Interactions between H.245 and RTCP for CS network
originated H.245 feedback on the quality of the media distribution
In signal 1, the MGCF receives an H.245 feedback message from the CS side.
In signal3, the MGCF requests the IM_MGW to send an RTCP message provisioning
the signal \"H.245 interworking\" with parameters identifying information to
be transported within this RTCP message.
In signal5, the IM-MGW send the corresponding RTCP message to the IMS side to
request for the media adaption.
To request the IM-MGW to send an RTCP message, the MGCF shall send the
corresponding information elements listed in table E.4.2.8.3.2.1 as parameters
of the \"H.245-interworking signal\" over the Mn interface.

## E.4.3 Mn Signalling procedures
### E.4.3.1 Overview
This clause describes the logical signalling procedures (i.e. message
identifiers are not part of the protocol) between the MGCF and IM-MGW. The
procedures within this clause are intended to be implemented using the
standard H.248 procedure as defined in ITU recommendation H.248.1 [2] with
appropriate parameter combinations.
### E.4.3.2 Add Multiplex Termination
This procedure is used to add a termination to multiplex/demultiplex H.223.

###### ## Annex I (normative): GTT interworking between the IP Multimedia Core
Network (CN) Subsystem (IMS) and Circuit Switched (CS) networks
# I.1 Overview of GTT interworking between the IMS and Circuit Switched (CS)
networks
The support of Global Text Telephony (GTT) is optional, but may be required by
national regulatory requirements. If GTT is supported, the procedures
described within this Annex shall be applied.
Global Text Telephony (GTT) offers real time conversation in text, optionally
combined with voice. GTT is mainly used for distant conversation with hearing
or speech impaired users.
GTT is supported in IMS via the Real-Time Text protocol over RTP, using IETF
SIP/SDP for the negotiation of the text media and IETF RFC 4103 [124] RTP-text
for transport, with text coded according to ITU‑T Recommendation T.140 [123].
See TS 23.226 [122], TS 26.114 [104], TS 26.235 [80] and TS 26.236 [32].
In PSTN, different specified systems for text telephony exist and are used in
different regions, e.g. Baudot (in US), EDT, V.21, Bell103, Minitel and V.18.
They all use different modem technologies within PCM and different character
coding for the transmission of text. They are described in the annexes of
ITU-T Recommendation V.18 [125]. ITU-T Recommendation V.18 [125] is an
international text telephone modem standard with an automoding mechanism that
enables communication with all the different kinds of PSTN text telephone
systems. Any party of a GTT call may at any time initiate text or send voice.
Speech and text may be used in an alternating manner during a conversation on
the PSTN. It is also possible that speech is transferred in one direction and
text in the opposite direction. However, speech and text can not be used in
the same direction at the same time in most sub-modes of V.18.
In the 3GPP CS radio interface, a dedicated CTM modem is used (see TS 26.226
[126]), which is terminated within the CS domain and interworked to PTSN
inband text telephony format.
Interworking between Real-Time Text over RTP within IMS and PSTN text
telephony is provided at the MGCF / IM-MGW by the MGCF triggering the
insertion of an Interworking (conversion) function within the IM-MGW which
then behaves in accordance with ITU‑T Recommendation V.18 [125] or any of its
specific sub-modes.
The support of this Interworking function between IP-based Real-Time Text over
RTP and modem based transmission of real-time text is optional both at the
MGCF and IM-MGW, but can be required by national regulatory bodies. If this
Interworking function is supported, the procedures described within this Annex
shall be applied.
The Interworking function in the IM-MGW shall support the detection of text
modem signals on the CS side and the conversion between text/modem signals and
Real-Time Text over RTP.
The IM_MGW shall support at least one of the sub-modes listed in ITU-T
Recommendation V.18 [125] (e.g. Baudot). The support of any of the sub-modes
is optional.
The procedures to detect and convert text/modem involve expensive MGW
resources. The present GTT interworking procedures intend to allow cost
effective implementations by avoiding additional load or resources in MGW for
calls not using text telephony (which represent most of the calls).
It is assumed that IMS terminals supporting text media will not automatically
offer text media, but that this will be instead governed by terminal
configuration options and user interactions to suit the communication
preferences and abilities of the user. However, an IMS terminal desiring to
set up a GTT call will offer Real-Time Text media, possibly in parallel to
voice media. The IMS-MGW shall then provide the conversion between Real-Time
Text over RTP and text/modem signals. On the contrary, if the mobile does not
request Real-Time Text support, no Interworking function is necessary. An IMS
Multimedia terminal configured to use Real-Time Text Telephony but receiving
an SDP offer for voice-only media will accept this offer and then send an own
subsequent SDP offer adding text media. When receiving such a subsequent offer
for text media, the IMS-MGW shall provide the conversion between Real-Time
Text over RTP and text/modem signals at the CS interface. On the contrary, if
the mobile does not offer Real-Time Text, no Interworking function is
necessary.
# I.2 Control plane interworking
## I.2.1 General
Before text conversation can begin, a call shall first be established, from
PSTN to IMS or vice-versa. The ISUP or BICC signalling to/from the PSTN
indicates a \"speech\" call, without any GTT indication.
The IMS user may request a text connection from the beginning of a call, or
add request for Real-Time Text media at a later stage in a call that was
originally established with audio only.
## I.2.2 Functionalities required in the MGCF for GTT calls support
In addition to the control plane interworking between SIP and ISUP or BICC
(see clause 7), the MGCF shall support the negotiation of the Real-Time Text
payload type (T.140 Text Conversation MIME media type as specified by IETF RFC
4103 [124]) in a distinct SDP m-line.
## I.2.3 IM CN subsystem originated session
### I.2.3.1 Initial INVITE with an SDP offer including a text media line
Figure I.2.3.1.1 shows an example call flow where the IMS terminal requests
Real-Time Text telephony by sending an SDP offer including one audio line and
one text media line within an initial INVITE message.
Figure I.2.3.1.1: IM CN subsystem originated session - Initial INVITE offering
audio and text
Upon receipt of a SIP INVITE request offering text media (possibly combined
with audio media) (signal 1 in figure I.2.3.1.1) the Interworking Node (MGCF)
starts the call set-up at the CS side by sending an IAM requesting a speech
with G.711 codec only or 3.1 Khz bearer (signal 2 in figure I.2.3.1.1), and
completes the call setup on IMS and CS side using the procedures specified in
clause 7, but returning an SDP answer including Real-Time Text media (possibly
combined with audio media if audio media has been offered) (signal 3 in figure
I.2.3.1.1).
The MGCF triggers the insertion an Interworking function in the IM-MGW for the
duration of the call if a Real-Time Text media stream is established.
The MGCF reserves corresponding Real-Time Text media resources in the IM-MGW
and activate the Interworking function, and if resources were available,
return an SDP answer with audio and Real-Time Text.
## I.2.4 CS network originated session
### I.2.4.1 General
When starting the session setup signalling from a CS based network towards the
IMS, the MGCF has no knowledge whether the CS side terminal supports and will
accept to use text telephony.
### I.2.4.2 Initial INVITE with an SDP offer including audio only
The MGCF offers only audio media when setting up a call towards the IMS and
waits for IMS terminals desiring Real-Time Text media to send a new offer
adding Real-Time Text media attribute prior to inserting an Interworking
function in the IM-MGW. If the MGCF receives a new offer adding Real-Time Text
media and applies signalling with OoBTC on the CS CN, the MGCF shall apply
appropriate OoBTC procedures to only select G.711 audio codec on the CS call
leg.
Figure I.2.4.2.1 shows an example call flow.
Figure I.2.4.2.1: CS originated session - Initial INVITE offering audio only
Upon receipt of an IAM request for a speech or 3.1 Khz audio call (signal 1 in
figure I.2.4.2.1) the Interworking Node (MGCF) starts the call set-up at the
IM CN subsystem side by sending an INVITE request (signal 2 in figure
I.2.4.2.1) offering audio media applying the interworking procedures in clause
7.
IMS terminals supporting GTT and configured to use it will send a new SDP
offer including an audio and a Real-Time Text media line within a subsequent
UPDATE or re-INVITE request.
When GTT interworking between IMS and CS networks is required, the MGCF shall
reserve corresponding Real-Time Text media resources in the IM-MGW and thereby
request the insertion of the Interworking function, and if resources were
available, return an SDP answer with audio and Real-Time Text media
attributes.
## I.2.5 Subsequent SDP offer/answer exchange adding text to an audio session
If only audio media has been offered in the initial SDP offer, the IMS
terminal can also request GTT support by sending a new SDP offer including
audio and Real-Time Text when a SIP dialogue (early or confirmed) has already
been established.
The MGCF shall then trigger the insertion of an Interworking function in the
IM-MGW following the same principles as those specified in clause I.2.3.14.
However, if OoBTC signalling is supported and a codec other than PCM (default
G.711) has been selected at the CS network, then a codec modification is
required to G.711. Otherwise No additional ISUP or BICC signalling towards the
CS network is required.
# I.3 User plane interworking
## I.3.1 Functionalities required in the IM-MGW for GTT support
An IM-MGW supporting GTT interworking between IMS and CS network shall
support:
\- Real-Time Text as specified in TS 26.235 [80], TS 26.236 [32] and TS 26.114
[104] for a Multimedia Telephony Service Indicator (MTSI) compliant IM-MGW;
this includes:
\- requirement to support ITU-T Recommendation T.140 [123] Text Conversation
MIME media type and RTP-text transport as specified by IETF RFC 4103 [124] and
ITU-T Recommendation T.140 [123] Text Conversation presentation coding;
\- recommended support of redundancy coding variant specified in IETF RFC 4103
[124] for error resilience;
\- PSTN based text telephony using ITU‑T Recommendation V.18 [4] or any of its
specific sub-modes.
NOTE: One specific text telephone protocol of the ITU-T Recommendation V.18
standard, called \"_Baudot Code_ \" (Baudot modulation at 45.45 baud), is
particularly important for support of emergency calls in US.
## I.3.2 Monitoring of text/modem signals on the CS side
When the IMS session is setup with text media (possibly combined with audio
media), the MGCF thereby requests the IM-MGW to monitor the CS termination for
possible receipt of text telephone signals, in order to detect whether the CS
user wishes to transit from voice to text during a voice call. The IM-MGW
shall be provisioned with the text telephone mode(s) for which the termination
should be monitored. The presence of the text media in the IMS session is an
explicit indication that monitoring of text telephone signals is required.
When monitoring for text telephony signals the IM-MGW should listen on the CS
side voice line for text telephone signals, and shall not transmit modem tones
from the CS side termination to IMS side termination until one of the
following occurs:
1) If the PSTN terminal is a carrier-based device and transmits answer tone.
The IM-MGW shall then resolve the text telephone mode according to V.18
procedures and then operate in that mode;
2) If the PSTN terminal is a carrier-less device, the end user starts sending
characters such that these may be detected by the IM-MGW. The IM-MGW shall
then detect the text telephone mode and then operate in that mode.
If the IMS terminal transmits text characters first the IM-MGW shall initiate
a text connection toward the CS network and resolve the textphone type, so
that communication can continue in text mode.
See ITU-T Recommendation V.18 [125] for a detailed description of those
procedures.
## I.3.3 Multiplexing between the CS and IMS streams
The IM-MGW should remain in speech mode until such time that text is detected
from either user. The IM-MGW shall detect modem signals on the CS termination
and decide based on this detection if the media received from the CS side is
interworked to the speech or the text media stream on the IMS side. In the
media direction towards the CS network, the IM-MGW needs to multiplex both
media streams into the PCM signal.
The following procedures provide further information on the procedures to be
followed by the IM-MGW, for normative behaviour the ITU-T Recommendation V.18
[125] shall be followed.
\- Carrier text phone:
\- After a carrier mode text connection is established, loss of carrier can be
taken as the indication that the audio stream on the IMS termination shall be
connected with the (PCM) interface of the line on the CS termination.
\- When the text carrier reappears on the CS termination, or text is received
from the text media stream on the IMS termination, the IM-MGW connects the
text stream on the IMS termination with the (PCM) interface of the line on the
CS termination.
\- Carrierless text phone:
\- When the V.18 modem detects text, the textphone CS termination stops
feeding the audio stream of the IMS termination, and instead inserts the
detected and T.140 converted characters into the text stream of the IMS
termination. This mode is continued as long as characters keep coming from the
PSTN textphone. When no more characters arrive, and no textphone signal is
received within 1 second, the audio channel is again fed to the audio stream
of the IMS termination. If new text comes from the V.18 side, the process is
repeated.
\- If text is received from the text stream of the IMS termination when V.18
is not actively receiving text, no media shall be applied to the IMS audio
stream, and the characters are sent to the V.18 modem for transmission. When
all text is transmitted and no more is received for two seconds, the audio
channels are enabled again. Since the carrierless systems are one-way
alternate transmission systems, transmission of characters is possible only in
one direction at a time. Once started, reception is given priority. Characters
received from text stream of the IMS termination while V.18 is busy receiving
should be buffered (up to a reasonable limit).
## I.3.4 Conversion between text/modem and Real-Time Text over RTP
The legacy PSTN textphone modes have limited character sets. For all legacy
modes, the text received through the V.18 modem shall be converted if
necessary in the RTP/T.140 format for the text stream on the IMS termination,
according to the rules in ITU-T Recommendation. T.140 [123] and IETF RFC 4103
[124], and vice-versa.
Redundancy may be used as specified in IETF RFC 4103 [124]. Use or not of
redundancy is derived from the text media description configured on the IMS
termination (RTP/RED/T.140).
# I.4 MGCF and IM-MGW interactions
## I.4.1 Introduction
This clause describes requirements for extensions to the Mn interface protocol
in TS 29.332 [15] needed to support the Interworking of Real-Time Text
Telephony media in IMS with text/modem calls in CS domain.
## I.4.2 Mn signalling interactions
### I.4.2.1 Introduction
The following clauses describe the Mn interface procedures.
All message sequence charts in these clauses are examples.
### I.4.2.2 H.248 Context Model
The H.248 context model depicted in figure I.4.2.2.1 shall be applied for
interworking Real-Time Text media in IMS to text/modem in CS.
Figure I.4.2.2.1: H.248 Context Model for GTT support
The H.248 context contains one IP termination (IMS side) with two streams (one
stream for Real-Time Text/RTP, another stream for audio/RTP), plus a TDM, AAL2
or IP termination (CS side) with one single stream carrying both voice via PCM
and V.18 text telephony.
### I.4.2.3 Specific Mn signalling for GTT
The following information shall be provided from the MGCF towards the IM-MGW:
\- SDP with audio and Real-Time Text m-lines for the IMS termination;
\- PCM (G.711) codec for the CS side termination.
This shall trigger the IM-MGW to insert an IWF to support RTT to PSTN text
telephony conversion. If the topology is incoming (or bothway) from the CS
network the IM-MGW shall monitor for text telephony and convert to RTT towards
the IMS network. If the topology is outgoing (or bothway) to the CS network
the IM-MGW shall multiplex RTT payload into the PCM stream.

session with audio and text
The Mn signalling interactions specified in clause 9.2.2.3 shall apply, with
the following differences.
When reserving the IMS termination, the MGCF shall configure two streams; one
for the audio and one for the Real-Time Text media line, with their respective
media description (signal 3 in figure I.4.2.4.1.1). Monitoring of text
telephony at the CS side termination is indicated by the inclusion of Real-
Time Text media at the IMS side termination and by the topology being bothway
or incoming from the CS side.
The text telephone mode(s) for which the CS side termination is monitored
shall be provisioned in the IM-MGW.
### I.4.2.5 CS network originated session
#### I.4.2.5.1 Initial INVITE with an SDP offer only including audio
Figure I.4.2.5.1.1: Mn signalling interactions for CS originated session \--
Initial INVITE with audio only
The Mn signalling interactions specified in clause 9.2.3.3 shall apply, with
the following differences.
Upon receipt of a subsequent SDP offer from the IMS terminal including the
audio and Real-Time Text media lines, the MGCF shall add an additional text
stream to the IMS termination and configure it with the remote media
description (signal 13 in figure I.4.2.5.1.1).
## I.4.3 Mn Signalling procedures
### I.4.3.1 Overview
This clause describes the logical signalling procedures (i.e. message
identifiers are not part of the protocol) between the MGCF and IM-MGW. The
procedures within this clause are intended to be implemented using the
standard H.248 procedure as defined in ITU recommendation H.248.1 [2] with
appropriate parameter combinations.
The procedures \"Reserve IMS connection point\" and \"Configure IMS
resources\" and \"Reserve IMS Connection point and configure remote
resources\" shall allow the configuration of two media streams; one for audio
and one for Real-Time Text on the IMS termination. See clause 9.3.1.
###### ## Annex J (informative): Call Flow for Customized Alerting Tone (CAT)
interworking between CS network and IMS
# J.1 Introduction
This annex describes procedures for interworking Customized Alerting Tone
(CAT) between the IMS and CS Networks.
# J.2 IMS CAT provided by the terminating IMS user using gateway model towards
user served in CS networks
Callflows for providing IMS CAT provided by the terminating IMS user towards
user served in CS networks are based on procedures specified in TS 24.182
[xx], with procedures for MGCF as shown in the following clauses.
## J.2.1 Callflow without using precondition mechanism
The following callflow shows the case when precondition mechanism is not used,
and 100rel extension is used.
Figure J.2.1: CAT gateway model callflow without using precondition mechanism
The content of the SDP message body described in figure J.2.1 is meant to be
as follows:
\- SDP_O in step 2 indicates the SDP offer inserted by the MGCF;
\- SDP_A_cat in step 3 indicates the SDP answer received by the MGCF, which in
general is the SDP answer generated by the CAT AS based on the content for CAT
media;
\- SDP_O_Regular in step 7 indicates the SDP offer received by the MGCF, which
in general is the SDP offer sent by the CAT AS based on the SDP answer
received by the terminating UE; and
\- SDP_A in step 8 indicates the SDP answer generated by the MGCF.
Upon receiving IAM (see figure J.2.1 step 1), MGCF sends SIP INVITE request
containing the SDP offer to terminating IMS (see figure J.2.1 step 2).
Upon receiving 183 (Session Progress) response to the SIP INVITE request
containing SDP answer (see figure J.2.1 step 3), MGCF sends ACM to the
originating CS network (see figure J.2.1 step 4). Also, MGCF sends a PRACK
request towards terminating IMS (see figure J.2.1 step 5). A 200 (OK) response
will be received later as a result of the PRACK request (see figure J.2.1 step
6).
Upon receiving SIP UPDATE request from terminating IMS with a SDP offer (see
figure J.2.1 step 7), MGCF sends a 200 (OK) response to the terminating IMS
with an SDP answer (see figure J.2.1 step 8).
Upon receiving 200 (OK) response to the INVITE request sent in figure J.2.1
step 2 (see figure J.2.1 step 9), MGCF sends an ANM to the originating CS
network (see figure J.2.1 step 10).
