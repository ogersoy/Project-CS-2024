# 4 General
The Diameter Base Protocol as specified in IETF RFC 3588 [4] shall apply
except as modified by the defined support of the methods and the defined
support of the commands and AVPs, result and event codes specified in clause 6
of this specification. Unless otherwise specified, the procedures (including
error handling and unrecognised information handling) are unmodified.
# 5 Use of the Diameter base protocol
The same clarifications of section 5 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [6] shall apply to the
Sh interface. An exception is that the application identifier for this
application is defined in chapter 6.
# 6 Diameter application for Sh interface
This clause specifies a Diameter application that allows a Diameter server and
a Diameter client:
\- to download and update transparent and non-transparent user data
\- to request and send notifications on changes on user data
The Sh interface protocol is defined as an IETF vendor specific Diameter
application, where the vendor is 3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA
to 3GPP ( http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
The Diameter application identifier assigned to the Sh interface application
is 16777217 (allocated by IANA).
## 6.1 Command-Code values
This section defines Command-Code values for this Diameter application.
Every command is defined by means of the ABNF syntax (as defined in RFC 2234
[5]), according to the rules in IETF RFC 3588 [4]. Whenever the definition and
use of an AVP is not specified in this document, what is stated in 3GPP TS
29.229 [6] shall apply.
The command codes for the Sh interface application are taken from the range
allocated by IANA in IETF RFC 3589 [7] as assigned in this specification. For
these commands, the Application-ID field shall be set to 16777217 (application
identifier of the Sh interface application, allocated by IANA).

### 6.2.3 Transient Failures
Errors that fall within the transient failures category are those used to
inform a peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time that it was
received. The request may be able to be satisfied in the future.
#### 6.2.3.1 DIAMETER_USER_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE (4100)
The requested user data is not available at this time to satisfy the requested
operation.
#### 6.2.3.2 DIAMETER_PRIOR_UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS (4101)
The request to update the repository data at the HSS could not be completed
because the related repository data is currently being updated by another
entity.

by 3GPP for its Diameter vendor-specific applications. See section 6.3 for the
assignment of the namespace in this specification.
### 6.4.2 Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
This specification has assigned Experimental-Result-Code AVP values 4100-4101
and 5100-5105. See section 6.2.
### 6.4.3 Command Code values
This specification assigns the values 306-309 from the range allocated by IANA
to 3GPP in IETF RFC 3589 [7].
### 6.4.4 Application-ID value
IANA has allocated the value 16777217 for the 3GPP Sh interface application.
# 7 Special Requirements
## 7.1 Version Control
The version control mechanisms specified in 3GPP TS 29.229 [6] clauses 7.1,
7.2 and 7.3 apply to this specification.
The following table of features shall apply to the Sh interface.
Table 7.1.1: Features of feature list 1 used in Sh
+-----------------------+------------+-----+-----------------------+ | Feature bit | Feature | M/O | Description | +-----------------------+------------+-----+-----------------------+ | 0 | Notif-Eff | M | This feature is | | | | | applicable to the | | | | | UDR/UDA, SNR/SNA and | | | | | PNR/PNA command | | | | | pairs. It requires | | | | | support in both HSS | | | | | and the AS. | | | | | | | | | | If multiple | | | | | subscriptions to | | | | | notifications are | | | | | associated with a | | | | | Public User Identity, | | | | | the HSS may combine | | | | | the notifications for | | | | | multiple Data | | | | | References,Service | | | | | Indications and | | | | | Identity Sets into a | | | | | single | | | | | Push | | | | | -Notification-Request | | | | | message. | | | | | | | | | | Similarly the | | | | | User-Data-Request / | | | | | Answer and the | | | | | Subscribe- | | | | | Notifications-Request | | | | | / Answer will allow | | | | | multiple Data | | | | | References, Service | | | | | Indications and | | | | | Identity Sets. The | | | | | User-Data-Answer will | | | | | be able to combine | | | | | DataReference items | | | | | resulting in the User | | | | | Data AVP including a | | | | | single XML document | | | | | with the separable | | | | | XML sections | | | | | populated. | +-----------------------+------------+-----+-----------------------+ | 1 | Update-Eff | O | This feature is | | | | | applicable to the | | | | | PUR/PUA and PNR/PNA | | | | | commands. If both the | | | | | HSS and the AS | | | | | support this feature, | | | | | a PUR command where | | | | | the Data reference | | | | | type is Repository | | | | | Data, may contain an | | | | | XML document with | | | | | several Repository | | | | | Data instances. If | | | | | this PUR command has | | | | | the effect to | | | | | generate | | | | | notifications of the | | | | | Repository Data | | | | | changes to another | | | | | AS, they may be | | | | | grouped into one PNR | | | | | command, if this | | | | | other AS supports | | | | | Update-Eff feature. | | | | | | | | | | The support of | | | | | Update-Eff feature | | | | | shall require the | | | | | support of the | | | | | Notif-Eff feature. | +-----------------------+------------+-----+-----------------------+ | Feature bit: The | | | | | order number of the | | | | | bit within the | | | | | **Supported-Features | | | | | AVP, e.g. "1".** | | | | | | | | | | **Feature: A short | | | | | name that can be used | | | | | to refer to the bit | | | | | and to the feature, | | | | | e.g. "MOM".** | | | | | | | | | | **M/O: Defines if the | | | | | implementation of the | | | | | feature is mandatory | | | | | ("M") or optional | | | | | ("O").** | | | | | | | | | | Description: A clear | | | | | textual description | | | | | of the feature. | | | | +-----------------------+------------+-----+-----------------------+
