# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply:
**Application Function (AF):** element offering application(s) that use IP
bearer resources
NOTE: One example of an AF is the P-CSCF of the IM CN subsystem.
**AF Session:** application level session established by an application level
signalling protocol offered by the AF that requires a session set-up with
explicit session description before the use of the service.
NOTE: One example of an application session is an IMS session.
**Attribute-Value Pair (AVP):** See RFC 3588 [5], corresponds to an
Information Element in a Diameter message.
**binding:** PCRF process of associating IP flows described in AF Service
Information with IP-CAN bearers.
**IP-CAN bearer:** IP transmission path of defined capacity, delay and bit
error rate, etc.\ See 3GPP TS 21.905 [1] for the definition of bearer.
**IP-CAN session:** association between a UE and an IP network (for GPRS,
APN).\ The association is identified by one UE Ipv4 address and/or one IPv6
prefix together with a UE identity information, if available, and a PDN
represented by a PDN ID (e.g. an APN). An IP-CAN session incorporates one or
more IP-CAN bearers. Support for multiple IP-CAN bearers per IP-CAN session is
IP-CAN specific. An IP-CAN session exists as long as the related UE IPv4
address and/or IPv6 prefix are assigned and announced to the IP network.
**IP flow:** unidirectional flow of IP packets with the same source IP address
and port number and the same destination IP address and port number and the
same transport protocol\ Port numbers are only applicable if used by the
transport protocol.
**MPS session:** A session for which priority treatment is applied for
allocating and maintaining radio and network resources to support the
Multimedia Priority Service (MPS). MPS is defined in 3GPP TS 22.153 [31].
**packet flow:** A specific user data flow carried through the PCEF. A packet
flow can be an IP flow.
**PCC rule:** set of information enabling the detection of a service data flow
and providing parameters for policy control and/or charging control
**service information: set of information conveyed from the AF to the PCRF
over the Rx interface to** be used as a basis for PCC decisions **at the PCRF,
including information about the AF session (e.g. application identifier, type
of media, bandwidth, IP address and port number)**
**service data flow:** An aggregate set of packet flows.

# 4 Rx reference point
## 4.1 Overview
The Rx reference point is used to exchange application level session
information between the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) and the
Application Function (AF). As defined in the stage 2 specifications (3GPP TS
23.203 [2]), this information is part of the input used by the PCRF for the
Policy and Charging Control (PCC) decisions. The PCRF exchanges the PCC rules
with the Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF) and QoS rules with
the Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function (BBERF) as specified in 3GPP
TS 29.212 [8].
Signalling flows related to the both Rx and Gx interfaces are specified in
3GPP TS 29.213 [9].
## 4.2 Rx reference model
The Rx reference point is defined between the PCRF and the AF. The
relationships between the different functional entities involved are depicted
in figure 4.1. and 4.2.
Figure 4.1: Rx reference point at the Policy and Charging Control (PCC)
architecture with SPR
With the UDC-based architecture, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.335 [29] and applied
in 3GPP TS 23.203 [7], the UDR replaces SPR and the Ud reference point
provides access to the subscription data in the UDR. The Ud interface as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.335 [30] is the interface between the PCRF and the
UDR.The relationships between the different functional elements are depicted
in figure 4.2. When UDC architecture is used, SPR and Sp, whenever mentioned
in this document, are replaced by UDR and Ud.
Figure 4.2: Rx reference point at the Policy and Charging Control (PCC)
architecture with UDR
NOTE 1: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified
in this Release. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
NOTE 2: The UDC Application Informational Model related to the PCRF is not
specified in this Release.
NOTE 3: PCEF is located in the Gateway node implementing the IP access to the
PDN. Refer to Annexes of 3GPP TS 23.203 [2] for application to specific IP-CAN
types.
NOTE 4: Refer to Annexes A.5 and H.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [2] for application of
AN-Gateways.
## 4.3 Functional elements
### 4.3.1 AF
The AF is an element offering applications that require the Policy and
Charging Control of traffic plane resources (e.g. UMTS PS domain/GPRS domain
resources). One example of an application function is the P-CSCF. The AF shall
use the Rx reference point to provide session information to the PCRF.
NOTE: The AFs may be deployed by the same operator offering the IP-CAN or may
be provided by external third party service provider.
### 4.3.2 PCRF
The PCRF (Policy Control and Charging Rules Function) is a functional element
that encompasses policy control decision and flow based charging control
functionalities. These 2 functionalities are the heritage of the release 6
logical entities PDF and CRF respectively. The PCRF provides network control
regarding the service data flow detection, gating, QoS and flow based charging
(except credit management) towards the PCEF. The PCRF receives session and
media related information from the AF and informs AF of traffic plane events.
The PCRF may check that the service information provided by the AF is
consistent with the operator defined policy rules before storing the service
information. The service information shall be used to derive the QoS for the
service. The PCRF may reject the request received from the AF and as a result
the PCRF shall indicate, in the response to the AF, the service information
that can be accepted by the PCRF.
The PCRF may use the subscription information as basis for the policy and
charging control decisions. The subscription information may apply for both
session based and non-session based services. _The subscription specific
information for each service may contain e.g. max QoS class and max bit rate._
If the AF requests it, the PCRF shall report IP-CAN session events (including
bearer events and events on AF signalling transport) to the AF via the Rx
reference point.
The PCRF PCC/QoS Rule decisions may be based on one or more of the following:
\- the session and media related information obtained from the AF via the Rx
reference point;
\- the bearer and subscriber related information obtained from the PCEF over
the Gx reference point;
\- the bearer and subscriber related information obtained from the BBERF over
the Gxx reference point;
\- subscriber and service related data the PCRF may be aware of by
configuration or through the Sp reference point;
\- pre-configured information in the PCRF.
NOTE: The details associated with the Sp reference point are not specified in
this Release. The SPR\'s relation to existing subscriber databases is not
specified in this Release.
The PCRF shall provision PCC/QoS Rules to the PCEF/BBERF via the Gx/Gxx
reference point.
## 4.4 PCC procedures over Rx reference point
### 4.4.1 Initial Provisioning of Session Information
When a new AF session is being established and media information for this AF
session is available at the AF and the related media require PCC supervision,
the AF shall open an Rx Diameter session with the PCRF for the AF session
using an AA-Request command. The AF shall provide the full IP address of the
UE using either Framed-IP-Address AVP or Framed-IPv6-Prefix AVP, and the
corresponding Service Information within Media-Component-Description AVP(s).
The AF shall not include circuit-switched bearer related media in the service
information sent to the PCRF. The AF shall indicate to the PCRF as part of the
Media-Component-Description whether the media IP flow(s) should be enabled or
disabled with the Flow-Status AVP.
NOTE: The AF does not need to open an Rx Diameter session with the PCRF, if
the SDP payload is only proposing to use a circuit-switched bearer (i.e.
\"c=\" line set to \"PSTN\" and an \"m=\" line set to \"PSTN\", refer to 3GPP
TS 24.292 [26]).
NOTE: The Rx Diameter session used for an AF session is different from the Rx
Diameter session possibly used for the notifications of the status of the AF
signalling transmission path. A new Rx Diameter session is established for
each new AF session.
The AF may include the AF-Application-Identifier AVP into the AA-Request in
order to indicate the particular service that the AF session belongs to. This
AVP can be provided at both AF session level, and Media-Component-Description
level. When provided at both levels, the AF-Application Identifier provided
within the Media-Component-Description AVP will have precedence.
The AF may include the AF-Charging-Identifier AVP into the AA-Request for
charging correlation purposes. The AF may also include the Specific-Action AVP
to request notification for certain user plane events, e.g. bearer
termination.
The AF may include the Service-URN AVP in order to indicate that the new AF
session relates to emergency traffic. If the PCRF receives the Service-URN AVP
indicating an emergency session, the PCRF may apply special policies, for
instance prioritising service flows relating to the new AF session or allowing
these service flows free of charge.
The AF may include the MPS-Identifier AVP in order to indicate that the new AF
session relates to an MPS session. If the PCRF receives the MPS-Identifier AVP
indicating an MPS session, the PCRF may take specific actions on the
corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the MPS session is prioritized as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. For Multimedia Priority Sevice handling, see
Annex A.9.
If the AF provides service information that has been fully negotiated (e.g.
based on the SDP answer), the AF may include the Service-Info-Status AVP set
to FINAL_SERVICE_INFORMATION. In this case the PCRF shall authorize the
session and provision the corresponding PCC/QoS rules to the PCEF/BBERF.
The AF may additionally provide preliminary service information not fully
negotiated yet (e.g. based on the SDP offer) at an earlier stage. To do so,
the AF shall include the Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to
PRELIMINARY SERVICE INFORMATION. Upon receipt of such preliminary service
information, the PCRF shall perform an early authorization check of the
service information. For GPRS, the PCRF shall not provision PCC rules towards
the PCEF unsolicitedly. However, the PCRF may authorize a PCC/QoS rule request
received from the PCEF/BBERF as per 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
For sponsored data connectivity, the AF shall provide the application service
provider identity and the sponsor identity to the PCRF byincluding the
Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP and the Sponsor-Identity AVP in the
Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP in the AA-Request.
NOTE: The relationship between the AF and Sponsor is out of scope of this
specification. A single AF can serve multiple ASPs and multiple sponsors, An
ASP can also be a sponsor.
To support the usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity, the AF may
also include the Granted-Service-Unit AVP in the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data
AVP and the Specific-Action AVP set to the value USAGE_REPORT in the AA-
Request to request notification when the usage threshold has been reached.
NOTE: If the AF is in the user plane, the AF can handle the usage monitoring
and therefore it is not required to provide a usage threshold to the PCRF as
part of the sponsored data connectivity information.
If the UE is roaming with the visited access case and the AF is located in the
HPLMN or roaming with the home routed case and operator policies do not allow
accessing the sponsored data connectivity with this roaming case, the H-PCRF
shall reject the service request indicating
UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY to the AF.
If the UE is roaming with the visited access case and the AF is located in the
VPLMN, the V-PCRF shall reject the service request indicating
UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY to the AF.
If the UE is in the non-roaming case or roaming with the home routed case and
the operator policies allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with
this roaming case, the following procedures apply:
\- If the PCEF does not support sponsored connectivity and the required
reporting level for that service indicates a sponsored connectivity level
according to 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], clause 4.5.20, then the PCRF shall reject the
request indicating REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED.
\- If the PCEF supports sponsored data connectivity feature or the required
reporting level is different from sponsored connectivity level as described in
3GPP TS 29.212[8], then the PCRF, based on operator policies, shall check
whether it is required to validate the sponsored connectivity data. If it is
required, it shall perform the authorizations based on sponsored data
connectivity profiles. If the authorization fails, the PCRF responds to the AF
with an AA-Answer including the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY. The profile may include a list of
Application Service Providers and their applications per sponsor.
NOTE: If the AF is in the operator\'s network and is based on the OSA/Parlay-X
GW, the PCRF is not required to verify that a trust relationship exists
between the operator and the sponsors.
When the PCRF receives an initial AA-Request from the AF, the PCRF shall
perform session binding as described in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9]. To allow the PCRF
to identify the IP-CAN session for which this request applies, the AF shall
provide either the Framed-IP-Address or the Framed-IPv6-Prefix containing the
full IP address applicable to an IP flow or IP flows towards the UE. In case
of private IP address being used, the AF may also provide PDN information if
available in the Called-Station-Id AVP for session binding.
If the PCRF fails in executing session binding, the PCRF responds to the AF
with an AA-Answer including the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
IP-CAN_SESSION_NOT_AVAILABLE. Further details on how the PCRF identifies
suitable IP-CAN sessions can be found in the binding mechanism described in
3GPP TS 29.213 [9].
If the request contains Media-Component-Description Attribute-Value Pair(s)
(AVP(s)) the PCRF shall store the received Service Information. The PCRF shall
process the received Service Information according to the operator policy and
may decide whether the request is accepted or not. The PCRF may take the
priority information within the Reservation-Priority AVP into account when
making this decision. If the service information provided in the AA-Request
command is rejected (e.g. the subscribed guaranteed bandwidth for a particular
user is exceeded), the PCRF shall indicate in the AA-Answer the cause for the
rejection with the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED. The PCRF may additionally provide the
acceptable bandwidth within the Acceptable-Service-Info AVP.
To allow the PCRF and PCEF to perform PCC rule authorization and bearer
binding for the described service IP flows, the AF shall supply both source
and destination IP addresses and port numbers within the Flow-Description AVP,
if such information is available.
NOTE: In SDP source port information is usually not available.
The AF may specify the Reservation-Priority AVP at request level in the AA-
Request in order to assign a priority to the AF Session as well as specify the
Reservation-Priority AVP at the media-component-description AVP level to
assign a priority to the IP flow. The presence of the Reservation-Priority in
both levels does not constitute a conflict as they each represent different
types of priority. Specifically the Reservation-Priority at the AA-Request
level provides the relative priority for a session while the Reservation-
Priority at the media-component-description level provides the relative
priority for an IP flow within a session. If the Reservation-Priority AVP is
not specified the requested priority is DEFAULT (0).
The AF may request notifications of specific IP-CAN session events through the
usage of the Specific-Action AVP in the AA-Request command. The PCRF shall
make sure to inform the AF of the requested notifications in the event that
they take place.
The PCRF shall check whether the received Service Information requires PCC/QoS
Rules to be created and provisioned and/or authorized QoS to be provisioned.
Provisioning of PCC/QoS Rules and Authorized QoS to the PCEF/BBERF shall be
carried out as specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The PCRF shall reply with an AA-Answer to the AF. The acknowledgement towards
the AF should take place before or in parallel with any required PCC Rule
provisioning towards the PCEF and shall include the **Access‑Network-Charging-
Identifier**(s) and may include the Access-Network-Charging-Address AVP, if
they are available. The AA-Answer message shall also include the IP-CAN-Type
AVP, if such information is available. In that case, the AA-Answer message
shall also include the RAT-Type AVP when applicable for the specific IP-CAN
Type (e.g. 3GPP IP-CAN Type). In addition, if IP flow mobility applies to
service data flows as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], such that a subset of
the flows within the AF session are affected, the PCRF shall also include IP-
CAN-type and RAT-type information (if applicable) to IP flow mobility related
flows, if such information is available. The IP flow mobility affected service
data flows are included within the Flows AVP at command level. If the PCRF
needs to terminate the Rx session before it has sent the AA Answer, the PCRF
shall send the AA Answer immediately and before the AS Request.
The behaviour when the AF does not receive the AA Answer, or when it arrives
after the internal timer waiting for it has expired, or when it arrives with
an indication different than DIAMETER_SUCCESS, are outside the scope of this
specification and based on operator policy.
If the PCRF fails in installing PCC/QoS rules based on the provided service
information due to resource allocation failure as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212
[8] and if requested by the AF, the PCRF shall send an RAR command to the AF
with the Specific-Action AVP set to the value
INDICATION_OF_FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION to report the resource allocation
failure. The AF shall send an RAA command to acknowledge the RAR command.
### 4.4.2 Modification of Session Information
The AF may modify the session information at any time (e.g. due to an AF
session modification or internal AF trigger) by sending an AA-Request command
to the PCRF containing the Media-Component-Description AVP(s) with the updated
Service Information. The AF shall send an AA-Request command to the PCRF, only
after the previous AA-Request has been acknowledged.
If the AF provides service information that has been fully negotiated (e.g.
based on the SDP answer), the AF may include the Service-Info-Status AVP set
to FINAL_SERVICE_INFORMATION. In this case the PCRF shall authorize the
session and provision the corresponding PCC rules to the PCEF.
The AF may additionally provide preliminary service information not fully
negotiated yet (e.g. based on the SDP offer) at an earlier stage. To do so,
the AF shall include the Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to
PRELIMINARY SERVICE INFORMATION. Upon receipt of such preliminary service
information, the PCRF shall perform an early authorization check of the
service information. For GPRS, the PCRF shall not provision PCC rules towards
the PCEF unsolicitedly. However, the PCRF may authorize a PCC/QoS rule request
received from the PCEF/BBERF as per 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The AF may include the MPS-Identifier AVP in order to indicate that the
modified AF session relates to an MPS session. If the PCRF receives the MPS-
Identifier AVP, it may take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to
ensure that the MPS session is prioritized as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
For Multimedia Priority Sevice handling, see Annex A.9.
For sponsored data connectivity, the AF shall provide the application service
provider identity and the sponsor identity to the PCRF by including
Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP and the Sponsor-Identity AVP in the
Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP in the AA-Request.
To support the usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity, the AF may
also include the Granted-Service-Unit AVP in the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data
AVP in the AA-Request.
NOTE: If the AF is in the user plane, the AF can handle the usage monitoring
and therefore it is not required to provide a usage threshold to the PCRF as
part of the sponsored data connectivity information.
The PCRF shall process the received Service Information according the operator
policy and may decide whether the request is accepted or not. If the updated
Service Information is not acceptable (e.g. subscribed guaranteed bandwidth
for a particular user is exceeded), the PCRF shall indicate in the AA-Answer
the cause for the rejection with the Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the
value REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED. The PCRF may additionally provide the
acceptable bandwidth within the Acceptable-Service-Info AVP.
If accepted, the PCRF shall update the Service Information with the new
information received. Due to the updated Service Information, the PCRF may
need to create, modify or delete the related PCC rules and provide the updated
information towards the PCEF following the corresponding procedures specified
at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. The procedures to update the Authorized QoS for the
affected IP-CAN bearer are also specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The PCRF shall reply with an AA-Answer to the AF. The acknowledgement towards
the AF should take place before or in parallel with any required PCC Rule
provisioning towards the PCEF and shall include the **Access‑Network-Charging-
Identifier**(s) and may include the Access-Network-Charging-Address AVP, if
they are available at this moment and have not been yet supplied earlier to
the AF. The AA-Answer message shall include the IP-CAN-Type AVP if such
information is available and has not yet been supplied earlier to the AF. In
that case, the AA-Answer message shall also include the RAT-Type AVP when
applicable for the specific IP-CAN Type (e.g. 3GPP IP-CAN Type). In addition,
if IP flow mobility applies to service data flows as specified in 3GPP TS
29.212 [8], such that a subset of the flows within the AF session are
affected, the PCRF shall also include IP-CAN-type and RAT-type information (if
applicable) to IP flow mobility related flows, if such information is
available and has not yet been supplied earlier to the AF. The IP flow
mobility affected service data flows are included within the Flows AVP at
command level. If the PCRF needs to terminate the Rx session before it has
sent the AA Answer, the PCRF shall send the AA Answer immediately and before
the AS Request.
If the PCRF modifies existing PCC/QoS rules based on the updated service
information and the modification fails due to resource allocation failure as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and if requested by the AF, the PCRF shall
send an RAR command to the AF with the Specific-Action AVP set to the value
INDICATION_OF_FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION to report the modification failure.
The AF shall send an RAA command to acknowledge the RAR command.
### 4.4.3 Gate Related Procedures
Depending on the application, in the Service Information provision, the AF may
instruct the PCRF when the IP flow(s) are to be enabled or disabled to pass
through the IP-CAN. The AF does this by sending the AA-Request message
containing the Media-Component- Description AVP(s) that contains the flow
status information (in the Flow-Status AVP) for the flows to be enabled or
disabled.
In response to this action the PCRF shall set the appropriate gate status for
the corresponding active PCC rule(s).
If a Media-Sub-Component AVP under a Media-Component-Description AVP contains
a Flow-Usage AVP with the value RTCP, then the corresponding RTCP IP Flows in
both directions shall be enabled even if the Flow-Status AVP under the Media-
Sub-Component AVP is set to ENABLED-UPLINK, ENABLED-DOWNLINK, ENABLED, or
DISABLED.
The PCRF shall reply with an AA-Answer and shall include the **Access‑Network-
Charging-Identifier**(s) available at this moment. The PCRF forwards the AF
decision to enable or disable the authorized IP flows.
The behaviour when the AF does not receive the AAA, or when it arrives after
the internal timer waiting for it has expired, or when it arrives with an
indication different than DIAMETER_SUCCESS, are outside the scope of this
specification and based on operator policy.
### 4.4.4 AF Session Termination
When an AF session is terminated, if the AF had received a successful AA-
Answer for the initial AA-Request, the AF shall send a Session-Termination-
Request command to the PCRF. Otherwise, the AF shall wait for the initial AA-
Answer to be received prior to sending the Session-Termination-Request command
to the PCRF.
When the PCRF receives a ST-Request from the AF, indicating an AF session
termination, it shall acknowledge that request by sending a ST-Answer to the
AF. Afterwards, it shall free the resources allocated for the corresponding
Service Data Flow(s). In order to do that, the PCRF shall initiate the request
for the removal of any related PCC/QoS rules from the PCEF/BBERF and for the
update of the Authorized QoS for the affected IP-CAN bearer following the
corresponding procedures specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
If the AF session being terminated corresponds to an MPS session, the PCRF may
revoke the actions related to the prioritization of the MPS session in the
corresponding IP-CAN as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. For Multimedia Priority
Sevice handling, see Annex A.9.
For sponsored data connectivity, and if a volume threshold was provided for
the sponsored data connection at initial provisioning of session information
(clause 4.4.1) or modification of session information (clause 4.4.2)
procedures, the PCRF shall provide the volume consumed to the AF. For such
purpose, the PCRF shall initiate the IP-CAN session modification procedure
according 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] in order to obtain the consumed volume. The PCRF
shall send then the ST-Answer to the AF including the Used-Service-Unit AVP
for reporting accumulated usage within the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP.
### 4.4.5 Subscription to Notification of Signalling Path Status
An AF may subscribe to notifications of the status of the AF Signalling
transmission path. To do so, the AF shall open an Rx Diameter session with the
PCRF for the AF signalling using an AA-Request command. The AF shall provide
the UE\'s IP address (using either the Framed-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-
IPv6-Prefix AVP) and the Specific-Action AVP requesting the subscription to
\"INDICATION_OF_LOSS_OF BEARER\" and/or \"INDICATION_OF_RELEASE_OF_BEARER\".
The AF shall additionally provide a Media-Component-Description AVP including
a single Media-Sub-Component AVP with the Flow-Usage AVP set to the value
\"AF_SIGNALLING\". The Media-Component-Description AVP shall contain the
Media-Component-Number AVP set to \"0\".
If the procedures in Clause 4.4.5a are not applied, the Media-Sub-Component
AVP shall contain the Flow-Number AVP set to \"0\", and the rest of AVPs
within the Media-Component-Description and Media-Sub-Component AVPs shall not
be used in this case.
When the PCRF receives an AA-Request as described in the preceding paragraph
from the AF, the PCRF shall perform session binding as described in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9] and acknowledges the AAR command by sending an AA‑Answer command to
the AF.
PCC/QoS Rules related to AF Signalling IP Flows should be provisioned to
PCEF/BBERF using the corresponding procedures specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]
at an earlier stage (e.g. typically at the establishment of the IP-CAN bearer
dedicated for AF Signalling IP Flows). The PCRF may install the corresponding
dynamic PCC/QoS rule for the AF signalling IP flows if none has been installed
before.
If the Rx Diameter Session is only used for subscription to Notification of
Signalling Path Status, the AF may cancel the subscription to notifications of
the status of the AF Signalling transmission path. In that case, the AF shall
use a Session-Termination-Request (STR) command to the PCRF, which shall be
acknowledged with a Session-Termination-Answer (STA) command.
NOTE: The Rx Diameter Session created for the AF signalling can also be used
when the AF requests notifications of IP-CAN type change and/or when the AF
provisions AF Signalling Flow Information.
### 4.4.5a Provisioning of AF Signalling Flow Information
An AF may provision information about the AF signalling IP flows between the
UE and the AF. To do so, the AF shall make use of an Rx Diameter session
already opened with the PCRF if an Rx Diameter session related to the AF
signalling is already established. The AF may modify an already open Rx
Diameter session related to the AF signalling (e.g. an Rx Diameter session
established for the purpose of subscription to notification of signalling path
status as described in 4.4.5) or it may open a new Rx Diameter session related
to the AF signalling if none exists.
To provision the AF signalling flow information the AF shall provide the UE\'s
IP address using either Framed-IP-Address AVP or Framed-IPv6-Prefix AVP. The
AF shall additionally provide a Media-Component-Description AVP including one
or more Media-Sub-Component AVP(s) representing the AF signalling IP flows.
The Media-Component-Description AVP shall contain the Media-Component-Number
AVP set to \"0\". Each Media-Sub-Component AVP representing an AF signalling
IP flow shall contain the Flow-Number AVP set according to the rules described
in Annex B and one or two Flow-Description AVP(s) set to the IP flows of the
AF signalling. Additionally, the Media-Sub-Component AVP shall include the
Flow-Usage AVP set to the value \"AF_SIGNALLING\", the Flow-Status AVP set to
\"ENABLED\" and the AF-Signalling-Protocol AVP set to the value corresponding
to the signalling protocol used between the UE and the AF.
When the PCRF receives from the AF an AA-Request as described in the preceding
paragraph, the PCRF shall perform session binding as described in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9] and shall acknowledge the AAR command by sending an AA‑Answer
command to the AF.
PCC/QoS Rules related to the AF signalling IP flows could have been
provisioned to PCEF/BBERF using the corresponding procedures specified in 3GPP
TS 29.212 [8] at an earlier stage (e.g. typically at the establishment of the
IP-CAN bearer dedicated for AF Signalling IP Flows). The PCRF shall install
the corresponding dynamic PCC/QoS rule for the AF signalling IP flows.
The AF may de-provision the information about the AF signalling IP flows at
any time. To do that, if the Rx Diameter session is only used to provide
information about the AF Signalling IP flows, the AF shall close the Rx
Diameter session by sending a Session-Termination-Request (STR) command to the
PCRF, which shall be acknowledged with a Session-Termination-Answer (STA)
command. Otherwise, the AF shall remove the IP flows within the Media-Sub-
Component- AVP by supplying the Flow-Status AVP with value \"REMOVED\".
### 4.4.6 Traffic Plane Events
#### 4.4.6.1 IP-CAN Session Termination
When an IP-CAN session is terminated, the PCRF shall inform the AF about the
IP-CAN session termination by sending an ASR (abort session request) command
to the AF on each active Rx Diameter session.
When the AF receives the ASR command, it shall acknowledge the command by
sending an ASA (abort session answer) command to the PCRF and indicate the
termination of the session by sending an STR (session termination request)
command to the PCRF. The PCRF shall acknowledge the termination of the session
by sending an STA (session termination answer) command to the AF.
Signalling flows for IP-CAN session termination cases are presented in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9].
#### 4.4.6.2 Service Data Flow Deactivation
It may happen that one or more PCC/QoS Rules (i.e. Service Data Flows) are
deactivated at the PCEF/BBERF at a certain time, either permanently or
temporarily. When the PCRF gets the knowledge that one or more SDFs have been
deactivated, (e.g. due to a bearer release or loss of bearer or out of credit
condition), the PCRF shall inform the AF accordingly if the AF has previously
subscribed using the Specific-Action AVP in the AAR command.
When not all the service data flows within the AF session are affected, the
PCRF shall inform the AF by sending an RAR (re-authorization request) command.
The RAR command shall include the deactivated IP Flows encoded in the Flows
AVP and the cause encoded in the Specific-Action AVP.
When the AF receives the RAR command, it shall acknowledge the command by
sending an RAA (re-authorization answer) command to the PCRF. The AF may also
update the session information by sending an AAR (AA-request) command to the
PCRF.
If the PCRF receives the AAR command, it shall acknowledge the command by
sending an AAA (AA-answer) command to the AF.
When all the service data flows within the AF session are affected, the PCRF
shall inform the AF by sending an ASR command on the Rx Diameter session
related to the AF session. When the AF receives the ASR command, it shall
acknowledge the command by sending an ASA (abort session answer) command to
the PCRF. After that the AF shall initiate an AF session termination procedure
as defined in clause 4.4.4.
Signalling flows for Service Data Flow Deactivation cases are presented in
3GPP TS 29.213 [9].
#### 4.4.6.3 Notification of Signalling Path Status
In the event that the PCRF is notified of the loss or release of resources
associated to the PCC/QoS Rules corresponding with AF Signalling IP Flows, the
PCRF shall inform the AF about the Loss of the Signalling Transmission path by
sending a Re‑Authorization Request (RAR) command to the AF. The RAR shall
include the Specific-Action AVP set to the value
\"INDICATION_OF_LOSS_OF_BEARER\" or \"INDICATION_OF_RELEASE_OF_BEARER\" and
the deactivated IP Flow encoded in the Flows AVP.
NOTE: If the IMS signalling specific PCC rules include a QCI corresponding to
a non-GBR bearer, the INDICATION_OF_LOSS_OF_BEARER will not be reported.
When the AF receives the RAR command, it shall acknowledge the command by
sending an RAA command to the PCRF.
The AF may then decide to terminate the Rx Diameter session used for the
notification of the status of the AF Signalling transmission path. The AF may
also decide to terminate any other active Rx Diameter session with the PCRF
related to the AF Signalling which is not available any longer. In that case,
the AF shall then initiate the AF Termination procedure towards the PCRF as
defined in clause 4.4.4.
#### 4.4.6.4 IP-CAN type change Notification
If the AF has successfully subscribed to change notifications in UE\'s IP-CAN
type and RAT type, the PCRF shall provide the UE's IP-CAN type and RAT type in
the AA-Answer if already known by the PCRF. The PCRF shall also send an RAR
command when a corresponding event occurs, i.e. when the UE\'s IP-CAN type or
RAT type (if the IP-CAN type is GPRS), changes or becomes available. In this
case the RAR from the PCRF shall include the Specific-Action AVP for the
subscribed event and include the IP-CAN-Type AVP and RAT-Type AVP (in case of
3GPP IP‑CAN) for the UE\'s new IP-CAN/RAT. If the PCRF is informed of an IP-
CAN type change due to IP flow mobility as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8],
where a subset the flows within the AF session are affected, the PCRF shall
include IP-CAN-type and RAT-type information (if applicable) to IP flow
mobility affected service data flows. The IP flow mobility affected service
data flows are included within the Flows AVP at command level.
NOTE: The RAT type event is only applicable for IP-CAN type GPRS, the PCRF
will provide the RAT type information to the AF not only in case of GPRS IP-
CAN type, but also in case of other 3GPP IP-CAN types.
#### 4.4.6.5 Access Network Charging Information Notification
If the AF has subscribed to a notification about Access Network Charging
Information, the PCRF shall provide the Access Network Charging Information in
the response, if already known by the PCRF. If not available, the PCRF shall
provide the Access Network Charging Information by sending a Re-Authorization-
Request (RAR) command when the Access Network Charging Information is received
from the PCEF. If different Access Network Charging Information is applicable
to the IP-CAN session, the PCRF shall notify the AF about the Access Network
Charging Information that applies to each authorized flow. The RAR shall
include the Specific-Action AVP set to the value
\"CHARGING_CORRELATION_EXCHANGE\" and shall include the assigned
**Access‑Network-Charging-Identifier**(s) and may include the Access-Network-
Charging-Address AVP.
#### 4.4.6.6 Reporting Usage for Sponsored Data Connectivity
When the AF session is associated with a sponsor and the AF provided usage
monitoring thresholds for such sponsor to the PCRF when the Rx Diameter
session was established or modified, the PCRF shall report accumulated usage
to the AF, when
\- the PCRF detects that the usage threshold provided by the AF has been
reached; or
\- the AF session is terminated by the AF; or
\- the AF session is terminated by the PCRF due to the IP-CAN session
termination, the termination of all the service data flows of the AF session
or the home operator policy disallowing the UE accessing the sponsored data
connectivity in the roaming case.
When the PCRF detects that the usage threshold has been reached, the PCRF
shall report the accumulated usage as provided by the PCEF to the AF in a RA-
Request (RAR) command with the Specific-Action AVP set to the value
USAGE_REPORT Otherwise, when the AF session is terminated by the AF or by the
PCRF, the PCRF shall report the accumulated usage as provided by the PCEF to
the AF in ST-Answer (STA) command.
The accumulated usage shall be reported in the Used-Service-Unit AVP within
the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP.
If the AF receives a RAR command indicating the usage threshold is reached,
the AF may terminate the AF session or provide a new usage threshold in the
Granted-Service-Unit AVP within the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP to the
PCRF in the AAR comand. Alternatively, the AF may allow the session to
continue without providing new usage threshold in the AAR command.
NOTE: After the PCRF reports the accumulated usage to the AF, the AF can
provide a new usage threshold to the PCRF. The monitoring will not start until
the PCRF receives the new threshold from the AF and provide it to the PCEF
# 5 Rx protocol
## 5.1 Protocol support
The Rx interface in the present release is based on Rx and Gq protocols
defined for Release 6 as specified in 3GPP TS 29.211 [7] and 3GPP TS 29.209
[5] respectively. However, to be able to separate the policy and charging
rules function (PCRF) of the present release from the **policy decision
function (PDF) and charging rules function (CRF) of Release 6** , the Rx
application in the present release has an own vendor specific Diameter
application.
The Rx application is defined as an IETF vendor specific Diameter application,
where the vendor is 3GPP and the Application-ID for the Rx application in the
present release is 16777236. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
NOTE: A route entry can have a different destination based on the application
identification AVP of the message. Therefore, Diameter agents (relay, proxy,
redirection, translation agents) must be configured appropriately to identify
the 3GPP Rx application within the Auth-Application-Id AVP in order to create
suitable routeing tables.
Due to the definition of the commands used in Rx protocol, there is no
possibility to skip the Auth-Application-Id AVP and use the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVP instead. Therefore the Rx application identification shall
be included in the Auth-Application-Id AVP.
With regard to the Diameter protocol defined over the Rx reference point, the
PCRF acts as a Diameter server, in the sense that it is the network element
that handles AF session authorization requests for a particular realm. The AF
acts as the Diameter client, in the sense that is the network element
requesting the authorization of resources for an AF session.
## 5.2 Initialization, maintenance and termination of connection and session
The initialization and maintenance of the connection between each AF and PCRF
pair is defined by the underlying protocol. Establishment and maintenance of
connections between Diameter nodes is described in RFC 3588 [10].
After establishing the transport connection, the PCRF and the AF shall
advertise the support of the Rx specific Application by including the value of
the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of the
3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP
contained in the Capabilities‑Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands. The Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-
Answer commands are specified in the Diameter Base Protocol (RFC 3588 [10]).
The termination of the Diameter user session is specified in RFC 3588 [10] in
clauses 8.4 and 8.5. The description of how to use of these termination
procedures in the normal cases is embedded in the procedures description
(clause 4.4).
## 5.3 Rx specific AVPs
Table 5.3.1 describes the Diameter AVPs defined for the Rx interface protocol,
their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values, whether or not the AVP may
be encrypted and which supported feature the AVP is applicable to. The Vendor-
Id header of all AVPs defined in the present document shall be set to 3GPP
(10415).
NOTE: Most of these AVPs have already been defined in 3GPP TS 29.209 [5] for
Rel-6. Their definition is based on the one used for Rel-6 with some possible
modifications to be applied to the Rel-7 protocols.

### 5.3.1 Abort-Cause AVP
The Abort-Cause AVP (AVP code 500) is of type Enumerated, and determines the
cause of an abort session request (ASR) or of a RAR indicating a bearer
release. The following values are defined:
BEARER_RELEASED (0)
This value is used when the bearer has been deactivated as a result from
normal signalling handling. For GPRS the bearer refers to the PDP Context.
INSUFFICIENT_SERVER_RESOURCES (1)
This value is used to indicate that the server is overloaded and needs to
abort the session.
INSUFFICIENT_BEARER_RESOURCES (2)
This value is used when the bearer has been deactivated due to insufficient
bearer resources at a transport gateway (e.g. GGSN for GPRS).
PS_TO_CS_HANDOVER (3)
This value is used when the bearer has been deactivated due to PS to CS
handover.SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY_ DISALLOWED (4)
> This value is used in the ASR when the PCRF needs to initiates the AF
> session termination due to the operator policy (e.g. disallowing the UE
> accessing the sponsored data connectivity in the roaming case).
### 5.3.2 Access-Network-Charging-Address AVP
The Access-Network-Charging-Address AVP (AVP code 501) is of type Address, and
it indicates the IP Address of the network entity within the access network
performing charging (e.g. the GGSN IP address). The Access‑Network‑Charging-
Address AVP should not be forwarded over an inter-operator interface.
### 5.3.3 Access-Network-Charging-Identifier AVP
The Access-Network-Charging-Identifier AVP (AVP code 502) is of type Grouped,
and contains a charging identifier (e.g. GCID) within the Access-Network-
Charging-Identifier-Value AVP along with information about the flows
transported within the corresponding bearer within the Flows AVP. If no Flows
AVP is provided, the Access‑Network‑Charging-Identifier-Value applies for all
flows within the AF session.
The Access-Network-Charging-Identifier AVP can be sent from the PCRF to the
AF. The AF may use this information for charging correlation with session
layer.
AVP Format:
Access-Network-Charging-Identifier ::= \
{ Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Value}
*[ Flows ]
### 5.3.4 Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Value AVP
The Access-Network-Charging-Identifier-Value AVP (AVP code 503) is of type
OctetString, and contains a charging identifier (e.g. GCID).
### 5.3.5 AF-Application-Identifier AVP
The AF-Application-identifier AVP (AVP code 504) is of type OctetString, and
it contains information that identifies the particular service that the AF
service session belongs to. This information may be used by the PCRF to
differentiate QoS for different application services.
For example the AF-Application-Identifier may be used as additional
information together with the Media-Type AVP when the QoS class for the bearer
authorization at the Gx interface is selected. The AF-Application-Identifier
may be used also to complete the QoS authorization with application specific
default settings in the PCRF if the AF does not provide full Session-
Component-Description information.
### 5.3.6 AF-Charging-Identifier AVP
The AF-Charging-Identifier AVP (AVP code 505) is of type OctetString, contains
the AF Charging Identifier that is sent by the AF. This information may be
used for charging correlation with bearer layer.
### 5.3.7 Codec-Data AVP
The Codec-Data AVP (AVP code 524) is of type OctetString.
The Codec-Data AVP shall contain codec related information known at the AF.
This information shall be encoded as follows:
\- The first line of the value of the Codec-Data AVP shall consist of either
the word \"uplink\" or the word \"downlink\" (in ASCII, without quotes)
followed by a new-line character. The semantics of these words are the
following:
\- \"uplink\" indicates that the SDP was received from the UE and sent to the
network.
\- \"downlink\" indicates that the SDP was received from the network and sent
to the UE.
NOTE: The first line indicates the direction of the source of the SDP used to
derive the information. The majority of the information within the Codec-Data
AVP indicating \"downlink\" describes properties, for instance receiver
capabilities, of the sender of the SDP, the network in this case and is
therefore applicable for IP flows in the uplink direction. Similarly, the
majority of the information within the Codec-Data AVP indicating \"uplink\"
describes properties, for instance receiver capabilities, of the sender of the
SDP, the UE in this case and is therefore applicable for IP flows in the
downlink direction.
\- The second line of the value of the Codec-Data AVP shall consist of either
the word \"offer\" or the word \"answer\", or the word \"description\" (in
ASCII, without quotes) followed by a new-line character. The semantics of
these words are the following:
\- \"offer\" indicates that SDP lines from an SDP offer according to RFC 3264
[18] are being provisioned in the Codec-Data AVP;
\- \"answer\" indicates that SDP lines from an SDP answer according to RFC
3264 [18] are being provisioned in the Codec-Data AVP;
\- \"description\" indicates that SDP lines from a SDP session description in
a scenario where the offer-answer mechanism of RFC 3264 [18] is not being
applied are being provisioned in the Codec-Data AVP. For instance, SDP from an
RTSP \"Describe\" reply may be provisioned.
\- The rest of the value shall consist of SDP line(s) in ASCII encoding
separated by new-line characters, as specified in IETF RFC 4566 [13]. The
first of these line(s) shall be an \"m\" line. The remaining lines shall be
any available SDP \"a\" and \"b\" lines related to that \"m\" line. However,
to avoid duplication of information, the SDP \"a=sendrecv\", \"a=recvonly \",
\"a=sendonly\", \"a=inactive\", \"b:AS\", \"b:RS\" and \"b:RR\" lines do not
need to be included.
### 5.3.8 Flow-Description AVP
The Flow-Description AVP (AVP code 507) is of type IPFilterRule, and defines a
packet filter for an IP flow with the following information:
\- Direction (in or out). The direction \"in\" refers to uplink IP flows, and
the direction \"out\" refers to downlink IP flows.
\- Source and destination IP address (possibly masked).
\- Protocol.
\- Source and destination port.
The IPFilterRule type shall be used over Rx interface with the following
restrictions:
\- The Source Port may be omitted to indicate that any source port is allowed.
Lists or ranges shall not be used.
\- Only the Action \"permit\" shall be used.
\- No \"options\" shall be used.
\- The invert modifier \"!\" for addresses shall not be used.
\- The keyword \"assigned\" shall not be used.
NOTE: For TCP protocol, destination port can also be omitted.
If any of these restrictions is not observed by the AF, the server shall send
an error response to the AF containing the Experimental-Result-Code AVP with
value FILTER_RESTRICTIONS.
For the Rx interface, the Flow description AVP shall be used to describe a
single IP flow.
### 5.3.9 Flow-Number AVP
The Flow-Number AVP (AVP code 509) is of type Unsigned32, and it contains the
ordinal number of the IP flow(s), assigned according to the rules in Annex B.
### 5.3.10 Flows AVP
The Flows AVP (AVP code 510) is of type Grouped, and it indicates IP flows via
their flow identifiers.
When reporting an out of credit condition, the Final-Unit-Action AVP indicates
the termination action applied to the impacted flows.
If no Flow-Number AVP(s) are supplied, the Flows AVP refers to all Flows
matching the media component number.
AVP Format:
Flows::= \
{Media-Component-Number}
*[Flow-Number]
[Final-Unit-Action]
### 5.3.11 Flow-Status AVP
The Flow-Status AVP (AVP code 511) is of type Enumerated, and describes
whether the IP flow(s) are enabled or disabled. The following values are
defined:
ENABLED-UPLINK (0)
This value shall be used to enable associated uplink IP flow(s) and to disable
associated downlink IP flow(s).
ENABLED-DOWNLINK (1)
This value shall be used to enable associated downlink IP flow(s) and to

### 5.3.16 Media-Component-Description AVP
The Media-Component-Description AVP (AVP code 517) is of type Grouped, and it
contains service information for a single media component within an AF session
or the AF signalling information. The service information may be based on the
SDI exchanged between the AF and the AF session client in the UE. The
information may be used by the PCRF to determine authorized QoS and IP flow
classifiers for bearer authorization and PCC rule selection.
Within one Diameter message, a single IP flow shall not be described by more
than one Media-Component-Description AVP.
Bandwidth information and Flow-Status information provided within the Media-
Component-Description AVP applies to all those IP flows within the media
component, for which no corresponding information is being provided within
Media-Sub-Component AVP(s).
If a Media-Component-Description AVP is not supplied by the AF, or if optional
AVP(s) within a Media-Component-Description AVP are omitted, but corresponding
information has been provided in previous Diameter messages, the previous
information for the corresponding IP flow(s) remains valid.
All IP flows within a Media-Component-Description AVP are permanently disabled
by supplying a Flow Status AVP with value \"REMOVED\". The server may delete
corresponding filters and state information.
Reservation-Priority provided within the Media-Component-Description AVP in
the request from the AF applies to all those IP flows within the media
component and describes the relative importance of the IP flow as compared to
other IP flows. The PCRF may use this value to implement priority based
admission. If the Reservation-Priority AVP is not specified the IP flow
priority is DEFAULT (0).
Each Media-Component-Description AVP shall contain either zero, or one, or two
Codec-Data AVPs. In the case of conflicts, information contained in other AVPs
either within this Media-Component-Description AVP, or within the
corresponding Media-Component-Description AVP in a previous message, shall
take precedence over information within the Codec-Data AVP(s). The AF shall
provision all the available information in other applicable AVPs in addition
to the information in the Codec-Data AVP, if such other AVPs are specified.
If the SDP offer-answer procedures of IETF RFC 3264 [18] are applicable for
the session negotiation between the two ends taking part in the communication
(e.g. for IMS), the following applies:
\- The AF shall provision information derived from an SDP answer and shall
also provision information derived from the corresponding SDP offer.
\- If the Media-Component-Description AVP contains two Codec-Data AVPs, one of
them shall represent an SDP offer and the other one the corresponding SDP
answer.
\- If the Media-Component-Description AVP contains one Codec-Data AVP, and
this AVP represents an SDP offer, the AF shall provision the corresponding SDP
answer information in a Codec-Data AVP within a subsequent Rx message.
NOTE: Some SDP parameters for the same codec in the SDP offer and answer are
independent of each other and refer to IP flows in opposite directions, for
instance some MIME parameters conveyed within \"a=fmtp\" SDP lines and the
packetization time within the \"a=ptime\" line. Other parameters within the
SDP answer take precedence over corresponding parameters within the SDP offer.
If SDP is applied without using the offer-answer procedures, zero or one
Codec-Data AVP shall be provisioned.
The PCRF may provide the Media-Component-Description AVP(s) within the
Acceptable-Service-Info AVP in the AA-Answer command if the service
information received from the AF is rejected. For this usage, the Media-
Component-Description AVP shall only include the appropriate Media-Component-
Number AVP and the Max-Requested-Bandwidth-UL and/or Max-Requested-Bandwidth-
DL AVPs indicating the maximum acceptable bandwidth.
AVP format:
Media-Component-Description ::= \
{ Media-Component-Number } ; Ordinal number of the media comp.
*[ Media-Sub-Component ] ; Set of flows for one flow identifier

The Media-Sub-Component AVP (AVP code 519) is of type Grouped, and it contains
the requested bitrate and filters for the set of IP flows identified by their
common Flow-Identifier. The Flow-Identifier is defined in Annex B.
Possible Bandwidth information and Flow-Status information provided within the
Media-Sub-Component AVP takes precedence over information within the
encapsulating Media Component Description AVP. If a Media-Sub-Component- AVP
is not supplied, or if optional AVP(s) within a Media-Sub-Component AVP are
omitted, but corresponding information has been provided in previous Diameter
messages, the previous information for the corresponding IP flow(s) remains
valid, unless new information is provided within the encapsulating
Media‑Component-Description AVP. If Flow-Description AVP(s) are supplied, they
replace all previous Flow‑Description AVP(s), even if a new Flow-Description
AVP has the opposite direction as the previous Flow‑Description AVP.
The AF-Signalling-Protocol AVP may be included only if the Flow-Usage AVP has
a value of \'AF_SIGNALLING\'.
All IP flows within a Media-Sub-Component- AVP are permanently disabled by
supplying a Flow Status AVP with value \"REMOVED\". The server may delete
corresponding filters and state information.

### 5.4.1 Use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Rx reference point
The Supported-Features AVP is used during session establishment to inform the
destination host about the required and optional features that the origin host
supports. The client shall, in the first request of a Diameter session
indicate the set of features required for the successul processing of the
session. If there are features supported by the client that are not advertised
as part of the required set of features, the client shall provide in the same
request this set of features that are optional for the successful processing
of the session. The server shall, in the first answer within the Diameter
session indicate the set of features that it has in common with the client and
that the server shall support within the same Diameter session. Any further
command messages shall always be compliant with the list of supported features
indicated in the Supported-Features AVPs during session establishment.
Features that are not advertised as supported shall not be used to construct
the command messages for that Diameter session. Unless otherwise stated, the
use of the Supported-Features AVP on the Rx reference point shall be compliant
with the requirements for dynamic discovery of supported features and
associated error handling on the Cx reference point as defined in clause 7.2.1
of 3GPP TS 29.229 [25].
The base functionality for the Rx reference point is the 3GPP Rel-7 standard
and a feature is an extension to that functionality. If the origin host does
not support any features beyond the base functionality, the Supported-Features
AVP may be absent from the Rx commands. As defined in clause 7.1.1 of 3GPP TS
29.229 [25], when extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature,
the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined
mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [25], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the Rx reference point, the Supported-Features AVP is used to identify
features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in
this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415).
If there are multiple feature lists defined for the Rx reference point, the
Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
On receiving an initial request application message, the destination host
shall act as defined in clause 7.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.229 [25]. The following
exceptions apply to the initial AAR/AAA command pair:
\- If the AF supports features that are required for the successful operation
of the session, the AAR shall include these required features within
Supported-Features AVP(s) with the 'M' bit set.
\- If the AF supports optional features that are not required for the
successful operation of the session, the AAR shall include these optional
features within Supported-Features AVP(s) with the 'M' bit cleared.
\- If the AAR command does not contain any Supported-Features AVP(s) and the
PCRF supports Rel-7 Rx functionality, the AAA command shall not include the
Supported-Features AVP. In this case, both AF and PCRF shall behave as
specified in the Rel-7 version of this document.
\- If the AAR command contains the Supported-Features AVP(s) and the PCRF
supports all the features advertised in the AAR command within Supported-
Features AVP(s) with the 'M' bit set, the AAA command from the PCRF shall
include the Supported-Features AVP(s), with the \'M\' bit cleared, indicating
only the features that both the PCRF and AF support.
Once the PCRF and AF have negotiated the set of supported features during
session establishment, the set of common features shall be used during the
lifetime of the Diameter session.
The table below defines the features applicable to the Rx interfaces for the
feature list with a Feature-List-ID of 1.

## 5.5 Rx specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP values
RFC 3588 [10] specifies the Experimental-Result AVP containing Vendor-ID AVP
and Experimental-Result-Code AVP. The Experimental-Result-Code AVP (AVP Code
298) is of type Unsigned32 and contains a vendor-assigned value representing
the result of processing a request. The Vendor-ID AVP shall be set to 3GPP
(10415).
Specific values of the Rx specific Experimental-Result-Code AVP are:
INVALID_SERVICE_INFORMATION (5061)
The PCRF rejects new or modified service information the service information
provided by the AF is invalid or insufficient for the server to perform the
requested action.
FILTER_RESTRICTIONS (5062)
The PCRF rejects new or modified service information because the Flow-
Description AVP(s) cannot be handled by the server because restrictions
defined in clause 5.3.7 are not observed.
REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED (5063)
The PCRF rejects new or modified service information because the requested
service, as described by the service information provided by the AF, is not
consistent with either the related subscription information, operator defined
policy rules and/or the supported features in the IP-CAN network.
DUPLICATED_AF_SESSION (5064)
The PCRF rejects a new Rx session setup because the new Rx session relates to
an AF session with another related active Rx session, e.g. if the AF provided
the same AF charging identifier for this new Rx session that is already in use
for the other ongoing Rx session.
IP-CAN_SESSION_NOT_AVAILABLE (5065)
The PCRF rejects a new Rx session setup when it fails to associate the
described service IP flows within the session information received from the AF
to an existing IP-CAN session.
UNAUTHORIZED_NON_EMERGENCY_SESSION (5066)
The PCRF rejects a new Rx session setup because the session binding function
associated a non-Emergency IMS session to an IP-CAN session established to an
Emergency APN.
UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY (5067)
> The PCRF rejects a new Rx session setup because the PCRF can't authorize the
> sponsored data connectivity based on the sponsored data connectivity profile
> or the operator policy (e.g. sponsored data connectivity not authorised in
> the roaming case).
## 5.6 Rx messages
Existing Diameter command codes from the Diameter base protocol RFC 3588 [10]
and the NASREQ Diameter application (RFC 4005 [12]) are used with the Rx
specific AVPs. An Rx specific Auth‑Application id is used together with the
command code to identify the Rx messages.
NOTE 1: The notion of NAS (Network Access Server) is not used here, NASREQ is
just used for protocol purposes, not for its functional meaning.
NOTE 2: Some of the AVPs included in the messages formats below are in bold to
highlight that these AVPs are used by this specific protocol and do not belong
to the original Diameter Base Protocol RFC 3588 [10].

###### ## Annex A (normative): IMS Related P-CSCF Procedures over Rx
# A.1 Provision of Service Information at P-CSCF
The P-CSCF shall send service information to the PCRF upon every SIP message
that includes an SDP answer payload for the purpose of authorizing the IP
flows and the QoS resources required for a negotiated IMS session, unless the
SDP payload only relates to a circuit-switched bearer (i.e. \"c=\" line set to
\"PSTN\" and an \"m=\" line set to \"PSTN\", refer to 3GPP TS 24.292 [26]).
The service information shall be derived both from the SDP offer and the SDP
answer. This ensures that the PCRF receives proper information to perform
media authorization for all possible IMS session set-up scenarios, and that
the PCRF is also capable of handling session modifications. The P-CSCF may
include the Service-Info-Status AVP with the value set to
FINAL_SERVICE_INFORMATION.
Additionally, the P-CSCF may send service information to the PCRF when
receiving a SIP message that includes an SDP offer payload for the purpose of
performing an early bandwidth authorization check or for enabling pre-
authorization for a UE terminated IMS session establishment or modification
with UE initiated resource reservation. The P-CSCF shall send service
information to the PCRF when receiving a SIP message that includes an SDP
offer payload when the IMS session is an MPS session that requires priority
treatment. For a UE terminated session the P-CSCF may send the service
information derived from the SDP offer when the SDP offer either does not
include any preconditions information or includes preconditions information
indicating that the local preconditions (i.e. the preconditions related to the
remote peer) are already met. In this case, the P-CSCF shall derive the
service information only from the SDP offer and shall include the Service-
Info-Status AVP with the value set to PRELIMINARY SERVICE INFORMATION.
NOTE: For a UE terminated session setup, when the SDP offer either does not
include any preconditions information or includes preconditions information
indicating that the local preconditions (i.e. the preconditions related to the
remote peer) are already met, the terminating UE can request a resource
modification prior to sending the SDP answer. Even if the IP address and port
information in the session information derived from the SDP offer can be
insufficient for PCC rule authorization, the policy to handle such UE
initiated requests at the PCRF can take into account the fact that an IMS
session establishment is ongoing, for instance in deciding whether to
authorize the request and in selecting an appropriate charging key and a
gating policy.
The P-CSCF shall derive Flow-Description AVP within the service information
from the SDP as follows:
\- An uplink Flow-Description AVP shall be formed as follows: The destination
address shall be taken from the SDP information received by the P-CSCF in
downlink direction, while the source IP address may be formed from the address
present in the SDP received by the P-CSCF in uplink direction (taking into
account only the 64 bit prefix of the IPv6 address) Source and destination
ports shall be derived according to rules provided in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9]
clause 6.2.
EXAMPLE 1: Assuming UE A sends an SDP to UE B, the PCRF of UE B uses the
address present in this SDP for the destination address of UE B\'s uplink
Flow-Description AVP, while the PCRF of the UE A uses the 64 bit prefix of the
same address for the source address of UE A\'s uplink Flow‑Description AVP. If
the source address is not formed from the 64 bit prefix, the source address
shall be wildcarded.
\- A downlink Flow-Description AVP shall be formed as follows: The destination
address shall be taken from the SDP information received by the P-CSCF in
uplink direction, while the source IP address may be formed (in order to
reduce the possibilities of bearer misuse) from the destination address in the
SDP received by the P-CSCF in downlink direction (taking into account only the
64 bit prefix of the IPv6 address) Source and destination ports shall be
derived according to rules provided in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2.
EXAMPLE 2: Assuming UE A sends an SDP to UE B, the PCRF of UE A uses the
address present in this SDP for the destination address of UE A\'s downlink
Flow-Description AVP, while the PCRF of UE B uses the 64 bit prefix of the
same address for the source address of UE B\'s downlink Flow‑Description AVP.
If the source address is not formed from the 64 bit prefix, the source address
shall be wildcarded.
The P-CSCF shall derive the bandwidth information within the service
information, from the \"b=AS\" SDP parameter, as detailed in 3GPP TS 29.213
[9] clause 6.2. For the possibly associated RTCP IP flows, the P-CSCF shall
use the SDP \"b=RR\" and \"b=RS\" parameters, if present, as specified in 3GPP
TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2. The \"b=AS\", \"b=RR\" and \"b=RS\" parameters in
the SDP contain all the overhead coming from the IP-layer and the layers
above, e.g. IP, UDP, RTP and RTCP payload, or IP, UDP and RTCP.
However, if service information is received containing the \"b=TIAS\" SDP
parameter that corresponds to an SDP answer payload, and if the P-CSCF
supports this parameter, the P-CSCF may derive the bandwidth from this
parameter rather than from the \"b=AS\" SDP parameter, as detailed in 3GPP TS
29.213 [9] clause 6.2.
When available, the P-CSCF shall also indicate to PCRF, as a complement to the
Service Information, the IMS Communication Service Identifier within the AF-
Application-Identifier AVP. The P-CSCF shall take the IMS Communication
Service Identifier value from the SIP response for which the corresponding SIP
request included the same IMS Communication Service Identifier value.
Otherwise, the P-CSCF may not be able to provide an IMS Communication Service
Identifier value to the PCRF. The format and specific headers where IMS
communication service identifiers are transported within SIP are defined in
3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
If the Service-URN AVP does not include an emergency service URN, i.e. a top-
level service type of \"sos\" as specified in IETF RFC 5031 [21] and possibly
additional sub-service information on the type of the emergency service and
the PCRF binds the IMS service session to an IP-CAN session established to an
Emergency APN, the PCRF shall return an AAA command with Experimental-Result-
Code AVP set to the value UNAUTHORIZED_NON_EMERGENCY_SESSION to the P-CSCF.
Upon receiving an AAA with Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
UNAUTHORIZED_NON_EMERGENCY_SESSION the P-CSCF shall apply the procedures
defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
NOTE: The PCRF determines whether an IP-CAN session is established to an
Emergency APN based on the information received over Gx and operator
configuration.
The PCRF may decide not to authorize requested service information. The PCRF
will indicate it to the P-CSCF by sending an AA-Answer with Experimental-
Result-Code AVP set to the value REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED. Upon
receiving an AA-Answer with Experimental-Result-Code AVP set to the value
REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED the P-CSCF shall apply the procedures defined
in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
# A.2 Enabling of IP Flows
Prior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, i.e. until the 200 OK
(INVITE) or any other 2xx response is received, the P-CSCF may enable or
disable media IP flows depending on operator policy, thus allowing or
forbidding early media in forward and/or backward direction. Only to disable
early media, the P-CSCF may modify the values of the Flow-Status AVPs derived
from SDP according to 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2. If the P-CSCF chooses to
modify the values, the P-CSCF shall store the last received SDP.
When a 2xx response is received, the P-CSCF shall enable all media IP flows
according to the direction attribute within the last received SDP, as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.213 [9] clause 6.2. When a 2xx response is received
and the P-CSCF previously provided modified values of the Flow-Status AVPs in
the session information, the P-CSCF shall provide service information with
values of the Flow-Status AVPs corresponding to the last received SDP.
NOTE: In most cases a 2xx response is a 200 OK.
If the P-CSCF receives SDP answers after the completion of the SIP session
set-up, i.e. after the 200 OK (INVITE) or any other 2xx response is received,
the P-CSCF shall provide the Flow-Status AVP, based on the last received SDP
answer. The Flow-Status AVP as derived from the SDP according to 3GPP TS
29.213 [9] clause 6.2.
# A.3 Support for SIP forking
The P-CSCF shall be able to handle forking when PCC is applied. Forking can
occur as specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [16]. The related UE procedures are
described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
## A.3.1 PCC rule provisioning for early media for forked responses
When a SIP session has been originated by a connected UE, the P-CSCF may
receive multiple provisional responses due to forking before the first final
answer is received. Multiple early media session may be established during
this process.
The UE and the P-CSCF become aware of the forking only when a subsequent
provisional response arrives for a new early dialogue. After the first early
media session is established, for each subsequent provisional response
establishing an additional early media session,, the P-CSCF shall use an AA
request within the existing Diameter session containing the SIP-Forking-
Indication AVP with value SEVERAL_DIALOGUES and include the service
information derived from the latest provisional response.
The P-CSCF shall also provision the service information derived from any
subsequent SDP offer-answer exchange within an early dialogue (e.g. in PRACK
and OK(PRACK), or UPDATE and OK(UPDATE) ) using an AA request within the
existing Diameter session containing the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value
SEVERAL_DIALOGUES and the derived service information.
When receiving an AA request containing the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with
value SEVERAL_DIALOGUES, the PCRF shall identify the existing authorization
information for that AF session. The PCRF shall send additional PCC Rules or
individual service data flow filters to already provide PCC rules as required
by the Flow Description AVPs within the session information to the PCEF. The
PCRF shall authorize any additional media components and any increased QoS
requirements for the previously authorized media components, as requested
within the service information. The PCRF shall authorize the maximum bandwidth
required by any of the dialogues, but not the sum of the bandwidths required
by all dialogues. Thus, the QoS authorized for a media component is equal to
the highest QoS requested for that media component by any of the forked
responses. The PCRF shall open or close the gates for service flows depending
on the flow status that is being provisioned. However, if a flow ID has been
enabled in uplink or downlink direction or both way within previous service
information, it shall remain enabled even if the PCRF receives service
information that disable this flow ID within an AA request containing the SIP-
Forking-Indication AVP with value SEVERAL_DIALOGUES.
## A.3.2 Updating the provisioned PCC rules at the final answer
The P-CSCF shall store the SDP information for each early dialogue separately
till the first final SIP answer is received. Then the related early dialogue
is progressed to an established dialogue to establish the final SIP session.
All the other early dialogues are terminated. The service information for the
SIP session is updated to match the requirements of the remaining early
dialogue only.
When receiving the first final SIP response, the P-CSCF shall send an AA
request without the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP and include the service
information derived from the SDP corresponding to the dialogue of the final
response. The P-CSCF shall provision the full service information including
the applicable Flow-Description AVP(s) and Flow-Status AVP(s).
When receiving an AA request with no SIP-Forking-Indication AVP or with a SIP-
Forking-Indication AVP with value SINGLE_DIALOGUE, the PCRF shall update
installed PCC Rules information and Authorized-QoS information to match only
the requirements of the service information within this AA request. The PCRF
should immediately remove PCC Rule(s) or individual service data flow filters
not matching IP flow(s) in the updated Service Information, to reduce the risk
for initial clipping of the media stream, and to minimize possible misuse of
resources. The PCRF shall also open or close the gates for service flows
according to the flow status in the received service information.
# A.4 Notification of AF Signalling Transmission Path Status
When the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message from an attached UE,
the P-CSCF may subscribe to notifications of the status of the AF Signalling
transmission path using the procedures specified in clause 4.4.5. Once the
P-CSCF has subscribed, the P-CSCF may receive notifications from the PCRF
according to clause 4.4.6.3.
NOTE: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for Emergency
sessions.
The P-CSCF shall cancel the subscription to notification of the status of the
AF Signalling transmission path when the AF Signalling to that particular user
is terminated (i.e. when the user is de-REGISTERED from the IM CN subsystem).
When the P-CSCF receives a notification of loss of signalling connectivity
from the PCRF, the P-CSCF shall behave as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
# A.5 Indication of Emergency Session
A SIP INVITE request can contain a service URN as defined in IETF RFC 5031
[21] within the request URI. If the service within this URN is \"sos\",
possibly with additional sub-service information, the P-CSCF shall provision
this service and sub-service information within the Service-URN AVP towards
the PCRF. The P-CSCF may also provision possible information about other
services received within the service URN.
# A.6 Notification IP-CAN Type Change
When the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message from an attached UE,
the P-CSCF mayrequest from the PCRF the information about the type of IP-CAN
the UE is attached to using the procedure specified in subclause 4.4.1.
NOTE: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for Emergency
sessions.
If the P-CSCF requests information about the type of IP-CAN, the P-CSCF shall
also subscribe within the same AAR command operation to notifications for
changes of the IP-CAN type used by the UE. The P-CSCF shall include a
Specific-Action AVP in the AAR that is set to the value of IP-CAN_CHANGE.
When the P-CSCF receives the AA-Answer or RA-Request from the PCRF, the P-CSCF
stores the IP-CAN type information and the RAT type information (if also
provided by the PCRF) and behaves as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
The P-CSCF may receive notifications for changes of the IP-CAN type from the
PCRF according to clause 4.4.6.4. When the P-CSCF receives a notification of
the change of the IP-CAN used by the UE, the P-CSCF stores the new IP-CAN type
information and behaves as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17].
The P-CSCF shall cancel the subscription to notification for changes of the
IP-CAN type used by the UE when the user is de-REGISTERED from the IM CN
subsystem.
# A.7 Support for Early Session disposition SDP
## A.7.1 General
As a network option, the P-CSCF may support the PCC procedures in the present
Clause to handle \"early session\" disposition type SDP, as standardised in
IETF RFC 3959 [27].
## A.7.2 Service Information Provisioning for Early Media
The P-CSCF can receive \"early session\" disposition SDP in addition to
\"session\" disposition SDP in SIP early dialogues.
The P-CSCF shall then provision service information derived both from the
\"early session\" disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP applying the
procedures in Clauses A.1, A.2, and A.3, and in the present Clause.
The P-CSCF shall apply the mapping rules in Annex B.1.2.2.2 to derive the flow
identifiers from \"early session\" disposition SDP.
If a single media line with one media type (e.g. \"audio\" or \"video\") is
contained in \"early session\" disposition SDP and a single media line with
the same media type is contained in the \"session\" disposition SDP of the
same SIP dialogue, and both media lines describe service flows of the same
directionality (uplink, downlink, or bidirectional), the P-CSCF should
describe those SDP media lines in the same session information media component
(with the same flow ID).
The \"early session\" disposition SDP can also contain media lines of a type
not included in the \"session\" disposition SDP, or several media lines of the
same type. Such media components shall be described in own media components in
the service information.
If the P-CSCF desires to invoke special policies or separate event
notifications for an \"early session\" disposition media line, it may choose
to provision a separate session information media component even if a media
line with the same media type and directionality is contained in \"session\"
disposition SDP.
NOTE 1: A PCRF is then likely to supply separate PCC rules for early media and
the corresponding final media. This may lead to an over provisioning of
resources during call establishment and a subsequent reconfiguration of the
radio bearer, or even to a call failure if the extra resources are not
authorized or available.
If the P-CSCF receives \"early session\" disposition SDP before any
\"session\" disposition SDP and supplies service information derived from the
\"early session\" disposition SDP at this point of time, it shall use
dedicated media components relating only to the \"early session\" disposition
SDP in the service information.
NOTE 2: The \"session\" disposition SDP offer will frequently occur before the
\"early session\" disposition SDP offer, but can also occur in parallel or in
exceptional cases afterwards. The \"session\" disposition SDP answer can be
contained in the same SIP message as the \"early session\" disposition SDP
offer, or can be sent in a 200 OK (INVITE), i.e. after the \"early session\"
disposition SDP answer.
If the P-CSCF includes any media component relating both to \"early session\"
disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP in the service information,
the P-CSCF shall:
\- provision the service information derived from \"early session\"
disposition SDP and the service information derived from \"session\"
disposition SDP in separate Rx AA-Requests, and shall send a new Rx AA-Request
only after any previous Rx AA-Request has been acknowledged; and
\- provision the first service information (either derived from \"early
session\" disposition SDP or \"session\" disposition SDP) without the SIP-
Forking-Indication AVP, or with the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value
SINGLE_DIALOGUE; and
\- provision all subsequent service information during ongoing call
establishment with the SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value
SEVERAL_DIALOGUES; and
\- if an SDP answer has been received and Codec-Data AVPs are provisioned
within a Media-Component-Description AVP, provision a Codec-Data AVP derived
from the corresponding offer together with a Codec-Data AVP derived from the
SDP answer.
NOTE 3: The P-CSCF needs to provision the service information derived from
\"early session\" disposition SDP and the service information derived from
\"session\" disposition SDP in separate Rx AA-Requests because the encoding of
the media-component does not allow for the simultaneous provisioning of two
corresponding filters.
NOTE 4: The PCRF will treat service information containing the SIP-Forking-
Indication AVP as described in Clause A.3.
## A.7.3 Updating the Provisioned Service Information when Dialogue is
established
The P-CSCF shall store the SDP information for the \"session\" disposition
type until the first final SIP answer is received. Then the early media
described in the \"early session\" disposition type SDP are terminated.
The P-CSCF shall then update the service information to match the requirements
of the media described in the \"session\" disposition type SDP only:
\- If the P-CSCF included any media component relating both to \"early
session\" disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP in the service
information, the P-CSCF shall send an AA request without the SIP-Forking-
Indication AVP or with a SIP-Forking-Indication AVP with value SINGLE_DIALOGUE
and shall include the service information derived from the \"session\"
disposition SDP. The P-CSCF shall provision the full service information
including the applicable Flow-Description AVP(s) and Flow-Status AVP(s).
\- The P-CSCF shall disable any media component(s) in the service information
that relate to early media only by setting their flow status to \"removed\".
## A.8 Provision of Signalling Flow Information at P-CSCF
When the P-CSCF has successfully concluded the initial registration of an
attached UE, i.e., when the P-CSCF has sent to the UE a SIP 200 (OK) response
to the SIP REGISTER request, the P-CSCF may provision information about the
SIP signalling flows between the UE and itself using the procedure specified
in subclause 4.4.5a. If the P-CSCF already has an open Rx Diameter session
with the PCRF related to the signalling with the UE, e.g. one that has been
opened according to the procedure described in subclause A.6 and/or in
subclause A.4, the P-CSCF shall reuse the already open session to provision
the SIP Signalling IP Flow information.
NOTE: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for Emergency
sessions.
If the P-CSCF provisions information about the SIP signalling flows,the P-CSCF
shall ensure that for each signalling IP flow information it provides, the
Flow-Description AVP shall accurately reflect the IP flow information as seen
in the IP header 'on the wire'. The P-CSCF shall set the value of the AF-
Signalling-Protocol AVP to \'SIP\'.
When the P-CSCF de-registers the UE and terminates SIP Signalling to the UE,
the P-CSCF shall de-provision the SIP Signalling IP flow information from the
PCRF as described in subclause 4.4.5a.
# A.9 Handling of MPS Session
When the P-CSCF receives an authorised Resource-Priority header field or a
temporarily authorised Resource-Priority header field containing an
appropriate namespace and priority value in SIP signaling, and recognizes the
need for priority treatment as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [17], the P-CSCF
shall include the MPS-Identifier AVP and Reservation-Priority AVP in the AAR
command towards the PCRF. The MPS-Identifier AVP shall contain the national
variant for MPS service name indicating an MPS session. The Reservation-
Priority AVP shall include the priority value of the related priority service.
The Reservation-Priority AVP shall be populated with a default value if the
priority value is unknown.
NOTE 1: Various mechanisms can be applied to recognize the need for priority
treatment in the P-CSCF (e.g., based on the dialled digits), according to
national regulation and network configuration, as stated in 3GPP TS 24.229
[17].
NOTE 2: Lowest user priority value shall be mapped in the corresponding lowest
enumerated value of the Reservation-Priority AVP.
Upon reception of a request that requires MPS treatment, the PCRF shall derive
the PCC/QoS Rules corresponding to the MPS session, as appropriate. The PCRF
shall take specific actions on the corresponding IP-CAN to ensure that the MPS
session is prioritized, as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], clause 4.5.19.1.3.
When the P-CSCF terminates the MPS session, the PCRF shall delete the PCC/QoS
Rules corresponding to the MPS session. The PCRF shall revoke the actions
related to the prioritization of the MPS session in the corresponding IP-CAN,
as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], subclause 4.5.19.1.3.
###### ## Annex B (normative): Flow identifiers: Format definition and
examples
# B.1 Format of a flow identifier
## B.1.1 General
A flow identifier is expressed as a 2-tuple as follows:
\
where both are numbered starting from 1. The encoding of the flow identifier
is as indicated in 3GPP TS 24.008 [12].
If UE and AF share an algorithm for a given application, which guarantees that
UE and AF assign the same ordinal number to each media component, the ordinal
numbers of the IP Flows within a media component shall be assigned according
to the following rules:
\- All IP flow(s) or bidirectional combinations of two IP flow(s) within the
media component, for which a downlink destination port number is available,
shall be assigned ordinal numbers in the order of downlink destination port
numbers.
\- All IP flows, where no downlink destination port number is available, shall
be assigned the next higher ordinal numbers in the order of uplink destination
port numbers.
The ordinal number of a media component shall not be changed when the session
description information is modified.
If no SDI with fixed and unique positions for media components is exchanged
between UE and AF, the UE and AF may assign the ordinal numbers of the media
components in another application-dependent algorithm which guarantees that UE
and AF assign the same ordinal number to each media component.
If UE and AF do not share an algorithm for a given application, which
guarantees that UE and AF assign the same ordinal number to each media
component, the ordinal number of the media component shall be set to zero and
the ordinal number of the IP flows shall be assigned according to the
following rules:
1\. If ordinal numbers for several IP flows are assigned at the same time, all
uplink IP flows shall be assigned lower ordinal number than all downlink IP
flows.
2\. If ordinal numbers for several IP flows are assigned at the same time, all
uplink and all downlink IP flows shall separately be assigned ordinal numbers
according to increasing internet protocol number assigned by IANA (e.g. 6 for
TCP and 17 for UDP)
3\. If ordinal numbers for several IP flows are assigned at the same time, for
each internet protocol with a port concept, all uplink and all downlink IP
flows of this internet protocol shall separately be assigned ordinal numbers
according to increasing port numbers.
4\. If IP flows are removed from an existing session, the previously assigned
binding info shall remain unmodified for the remaining IP flows.
5\. If IP flows are added to an existing session, the previously assigned
binding info shall remain unmodified and the new IP flows shall be assigned
ordinal numbers following the rules 1. to 3., starting with the first
previously unused ordinal number. The numbers freed in step 4. shall not be
reused.
If the IP flows correspond to AF signalling (e.g. SIP signalling IP Flows),
and no IP flow information is provided both the ordinal number of the media
component and the IP flows shall be set to zero. In the case when the IP flow
information of the AF signalling is provided, the ordinal number of the media
component will be set to zero, and the ordinal number(s) of the IP flows shall
follow the rules set above for the case when the UE and AF do not share an
algorithm for a given application.
## B.1.2 Derivation of Flow Identifiers from SDP
### B.1.2.1 Standard Procedure
The procedure in Table B.1.2.1.1 shall be applied for SDP of \"session\"
disposition type within SIP and for all SDP outside SIP.
Table B.1.2.1.1: Standard Procedure to derive Flow Identifiers from SDP
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | The ordinal number of the | The ordinal number of the IP | | position of the media component | flow(s) within the media | | | component description | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | The ordinal number of the | The ordinal number of the IP | | position of the \"m=\" line in | flow(s) within the \"m=\" line | | the SDP | assigned in the order of | | | increasing downlink destination | | | port numbers, if downlink | | | destination port numbers are | | | available.

### B.1.2.2 SDP with \"early session\" disposition type
The procedure in Table B.1.2.2.1 shall be applied for SDP of \"early session\"
disposition type within SIP. The \"early session\" disposition type is
specified within IETF RFC 3959 [27].
Table B.1.2.2.1: Procedure to derive Flow Identifiers from \"early session\"
disposition SDP
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | The ordinal number of the | The ordinal number of the IP | | position of the media component | flow(s) within the media | | | component description | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | If a single media component with | As in table B.1.2.1.1. | | one media type (e.g. \"audio\" | | | or \"video\") is contained in | | | \"early session\" disposition | | | SDP and a single media component | | | with the same media type is | | | contained in the \"session\" | | | disposition SDP of the same SIP | | | dialogue, and if both SDP media | | | components are described in a | | | single Rx service information | | | media component, that Rx service | | | information media component | | | shall obtain the media component | | | number derived from \"session\" | | | disposition SDP following the | | | rules in table B.1.2.1.1. | | | | | | Otherwise each media component | | | shall obtain the ordinal number | | | of the position of the \"m=\" | | | line in the \"early session\" | | | disposition SDP plus 1000 as | | | media component ordinal number. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

# B.4 Example 3 without media components.
The UE and AF do not exchange SDP for an application and do not share an
algorithm, which guarantees that UE and AF assign the same ordinal number to
each media component.
At the AF session initiation, the UE and AF agree to set up the following IP
flows:
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 100.
\- Downlink UDP flow with destination port 100.
\- Downlink TCP flow with destination port 100.
\- Uplink TCP flow with destination port 100.
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 200.
The following binding info is assigned to these IP flows.
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 100: (0, 2)
\- Downlink UDP flow with destination port 100: (0, 5)
\- Downlink TCP flow with destination port 100: (0, 4)
\- Uplink TCP flow with destination port 100: (0, 1)
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 200: (0, 3)
At a later stage in the session, the TCP IP flows are removed and the
following IP flows are added:
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 150.
\- Downlink UDP flow with destination port 50.
The following binding info is assigned to the IP flows existing at this stage:
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 100: (0, 2)
\- Downlink UDP flow with destination port 100: (0, 5)
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 200: (0, 3)
\- Uplink UDP flow with destination port 150: (0, 6)
\- Downlink UDP flow with destination port 50: (0, 7)
# B.5 Example 4
In this example, the SDP \"a=rtcp\" attribute defined in IETF RFC 3605 is
used.
An UE, as the offerer, sends a SDP session description, as shown in table
B.5.1, to an application server (only relevant SDP parameters are shown):
> Table B.5.1: The values of the SDP parameters sent by the UE in example 1.

and receives the SDP parameters, as shown in table B.5.2, from the application
server:
> Table C.5.2: The values of the SDP parameters sent by the application server
> in example 1.

From this offer--answer exchange of SDP parameters the UE and the PCRF each
creates a list of flow identifiers comprising the IP flows as shown in table
B.5.3:
