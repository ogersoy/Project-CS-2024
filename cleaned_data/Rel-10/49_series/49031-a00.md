# 1 Scope
The present document specifies procedures and information coding that are
needed to define and support the BSSAP LCS Extension (BSSAP-LE). The BSSAP-LE
message set is applicable to the following GSM interfaces defined in 3GPP TS
43.059:
\- Lb interface (BSC-SMLC).
\- Lp interface (SMLC-SMLC).
The present document defines message formats and encoding for BSSAP-LE and the
particular subsets of it that are applicable to each of the above interfaces.
The present document also defines the support for BSSAP-LE message transfer on
each of these interfaces using either ITU-T and ANSI versions of SS7 MTP or
IETF M3UA/SCTP and SCCP. Additional requirements for the above interfaces that
are applicable to BSSAP-LE are also defined -- e.g. usage of BSSAP (as defined
in 3GPP TS 24.008 and 48.008) on the Lb interface.

# 5 Procedures applicable to use of BSSAP-LE
## 5.1 Location Request
The Location Request procedure is applicable to the Lb interface. Its purpose
is to obtain a location estimate for a target MS that is already in dedicated
mode, in packet transfer mode, in packet idle mode, or in dual transfer mode.
It is also used to provide an MS with LCS assistance data or with a
deciphering key for LCS broadcast assistance data. The initiator of a location
request is the BSS. The procedure makes use of SCCP connection oriented
signaling on the Lb interface.
### 5.1.1 Successful Operation
The initiator of the location request sends a BSSMAP-LE Perform Location
Request to the SMLC associated with the current serving cell for the target
MS. The message contains the following mandatory (M), conditional (C) and
optional (O) information, where conditional parameters are required if
available.
\- Location Type (M).
\- GANSS Location Type (C)
\- Cell Identifier (M).
\- Classmark Information Type 3 (C).
\- LCS Client Type (C).
\- Chosen Channel (C).
\- LCS Priority (C).
\- LCS QoS (C).
\- Requested GPS Assistance Data (C).
\- BSSLAP APDU (C).
\- LCS Capability (O).
\- Packet Measurement Report (O).
\- Measured Cell Identity List (O).
\- IMSI of target MS (O).
\- IMEI of target MS (O).
\- Requested GANSS Assistance Data (C).
If requested, the SMLC performs positioning of the target MS using a
particular position method or a combination of more than one positioning
method. If neither the Classmark Information Type 3 IE nor the LCS Capability
IE is present, the SMLC shall instigate only network based positioning methods
(e.g. TA and U-TDOA but not GPS or E-OTD).
Alternatively, if requested otherwise, the SMLC may provide positioning
assistance data to the MS. The SMLC may invoke the following other BSSAP-LE
procedures to perform these procedures:
\- connection oriented information transfer;
\- connectionless information transfer;
\- LMU connection establishment;
\- LMU connection release;
\- DTAP-LE information transfer.
Additional procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 and 3GPP TS 48.008 may also be
performed. If a location estimate was requested and was subsequently obtained,
the SMLC shall return a BSSMAP-LE Perform Location Response to the initiator
of the location request. This message contains the following mandatory,
conditional and optional parameters.
\- Location Estimate (M).
\- Positioning Data (C).
\- GANSS Positioning Data (C).
Restrictions on the geographic shape encoded within the Location Estimate
parameter may exist for certain LCS client types. The SMLC shall comply with
any restrictions defined in 3GPP specifications and, in a particular country,
with any restrictions defined for a specific LCS client type in relevant
national standards. For example, in the US, national interim standard
TIA/EIA/IS-J-STD-036 [21] restricts the geographic shape for an emergency
services LCS client to minimally either an \"ellipsoid point\" or an
\"ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle and confidence\" as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.032.
If assistance data was instead requested for an MS and the SMLC was able
successfully to transfer this to the MS, the SMLC shall return a BSSMAP-LE
Perform Location Response to the initiator of the location request (serving
BSC). This message shall contain no parameters. The absence of an LCS Cause
parameter in this case implies that the transfer was successful.
Otherwise, if a deciphering key was requested for LCS broadcast assistance
data and the SMLC has access to the appropriate keys, the SMLC shall return a
BSSMAP-LE Perform Location Response to the initiator of the location request.
This message contains the following mandatory parameters.
\- Deciphering Keys (M).
### 5.1.2 Unsuccessful Operation
If the SMLC is unable to obtain any of the location information requested or
if requested LCS assistance data could not be transferred or requested
deciphering keys for broadcast assistance data could not be returned, the SMLC
shall return a BSSMAP-LE Perform Location Response to the initiator of the
Location Request carrying the following parameters:
\- LCS Cause (M);
\- Positioning Data (O).
\- GANSS Positioning Data (O).
If assistance data or deciphering keys for a specific positioning method is
not supported in the network or in the location area, the SMLC shall indicate
this with LCS Cause value \"Position method failure\" accompanied with
diagnostic value \"Position Method Not Available in Network\" or \"Position
Method Not Available in Location Area\".
### 5.1.3 Abnormal Conditions
If an ongoing location request is preempted at the initiator by an inter-BSC
handover or if the main signaling link to the target MS is lost or released or
if there is a timeout waiting for the positioning response, or if there is an
Inter NSE cell change in the PS Domain (e.g. detected by the BSS at receipt of
BSSGP FLUSH-LL PDU) for which the BSS is unable to maintain the positioning
procedure, the initiator shall send a BSSMAP-LE Perform Location Abort to the
SMLC containing the following parameters.
\- LCS Cause (M).
On receipt of this message, the SMLC shall stop positioning of the target MS
and may release any resources (e.g. LMUs) previously allocated. If the SMLC
has not yet returned a BSSMAP-LE Perform Location Response to the initiator,
it shall return this message containing an LCS Cause indicating an abort and,
optionally, positioning data, GANSS positioning data. The initiator shall then
release the SCCP connection. If the SMLC cannot proceed with positioning due
to some protocol violation or error condition (e.g. inter-BSC handover
indication received from the serving BSC), it shall return a BSSMAP-LE Perform
Location Response to the initiator containing an LCS cause and, optionally,
positioning data, GANSS positioning data. The initiator need not reply at the
BSSAP-LE level to this message. However, the initiator may return a BSSMAP-LE
perform Location Abort which shall not be treated as an error by the SMLC.
### 5.1.4 Overload
If the SMLC is in an overload condition, it may reject a BSSMAP-LE Perform
Location request by returning a BSSMAP-LE Perform Location response containing
an LCS Cause parameter indicating congestion. The initiator of the location
service request (BSC) may reduce the frequency of future location service
requests until rejection due to overload has ceased. In reducing the frequency
of location service requests, a BSC shall reduce lower priority requests, to
zero if necessary, before reducing the frequency of higher priority requests.
An SMLC shall similarly reject location service requests of a lower priority,
to zero if necessary, due to overload before rejecting location service
requests of a higher priority. An SMLC in an overload condition may optionally
employ the following procedures to alleviate overload:
a) Allow higher priority location service requests to preempt lower priority
requests for which location service procedures are already in progress.
b) Abort lower priority location service requests already in progress.
c) Reduce the supported QoS for lower priority requests for a location
estimate -- e.g. by reducing accuracy or increasing response time.
d) Employ MS based positioning methods, where supported by the target MS and
SMLC, rather than MS assisted or network based methods (except TA).
The priority of a location service request shall be defined according to the
value in the LCS Priority parameter. If this parameter is absent in a BSSMAP-
LE Perform Location request, the lowest priority shall be assumed.
## 5.2 Connection Oriented Information Transfer
The Connection Oriented Information transfer procedure is applicable to the Lb
interface. It enables two way transfer of BSSLAP messages between an SMLC and
the BSS serving a target MS. The initiator of the procedure can be either the
BSS serving the target MS or the SMLC. The procedure is only valid while a
location request procedure for the target MS is ongoing. The procedure makes
use of SCCP connection oriented signaling on the Lb interface and uses the
same SCCP connection as the location request procedure for the particular
target MS.
### 5.2.1 Successful Operation
An SMLC or BSS with a BSSLAP message to transfer concerning a particular
target MS sends a BSSMAP-LE Connection Oriented Information message to a
recipient carrying the following parameters:
\- BSSLAP APDU (M);
\- (Segmentation (C)).
If the sender is an SMLC, the message is transferred to the BSS. The BSS shall
then perform the positioning operation requested by the BSSLAP APDU (refer to
3GPP TS 48.071). If the BSSLAP APDU contains an RRLP APDU, the BSS shall
transfer this to the target MS.
If the sender is a BSS and the intended recipient is the SMLC for a target MS,
the message is transferred to the SMLC. The SMLC shall then perform
interpretation of the BSSLAP APDU.
### 5.2.2 Abnormal Conditions
At an intermediate entity, if a received BSSMAP-LE Connection Oriented
Information message contains unrecognized information or if the message cannot
be sent on, the message shall be discarded.
At the recipient entity, if a received BSSMAP-LE Connection Oriented
Information message contains invalid or unrecognized information as defined
for BSSAP-LE, any ongoing positioning procedure shall be terminated and
associated resources may be released. If the recipient is a BSS, the SMLC
shall be notified -- e.g. using a BSSLAP Reject or Abort. If the recipient is
an SMLC, a new positioning attempt (e.g. using a different position method)
may be started.
If a BSS receives an error from SGSN after having attempted to transfer the
information via SGSN to an MS for PS domain positioning, the BSS shall notify
the SMLC with a BSSLAP Abort message.
### 5.2.3 Segmentation
Segmentation is only included for support of interoperability with Legacy
(3GPP R4 and older) equipment when a segmented message is received from a
Legacy node. 3GPP R5 and later equipment shall not initiate the use of
segmentation.
The Segmentation parameter shall not be included if the BSSLAP message is not
segmented.
If the size of an embedded BSSLAP message is too large to fit into one BSSMAP-
LE message, the sending entity divides the BSSLAP message to a necessary
number of BSSMAP-LE messages each containing a BSSLAP APDU IE and a
Segmentation IE. In the BSSLAP APDU IE it includes as many octets as possible.
The segmentation IE contains a segment number field and an indication of the
final segment. Message identification shall not be used. The order number of a
segment in the Segment Number field in the Segmentation IE is incremented by
one starting from zero, i.e. the value is 0 for the first segment, 1 for the
next and so on. The receiving entity may use the segment number in order to
recognize the start of a new BSSLAP message and verify that all segments were
reliably transferred.
In case of handover interrupting the information transfer procedure, the
exception procedures described in 3GPP TS 43.059 shall be used.
## 5.3 Connectionless Information Transfer
The Connectionless Information transfer procedure is applicable to the Lb and
Lp interfaces. It enables two way transfer of LLP messages between an SMLC and
a Type B LMU. The procedure also enables two way transfer of SMLCPP messages
between two SMLCs. The initiator of the procedure can be a BSS or SMLC. The
procedure makes use of SCCP connectionless signaling.
### 5.3.1 Successful Operation
An SMLC or BSS needing to transfer an LLP message concerning a Type B LMU or
an SMLCPP message sends a BSSMAP-LE Connectionless Information message to a
recipient carrying the following parameters:
\- Source Entity (M);
\- Destination Entity (M);
\- APDU (M);
\- Segmentation (C);
\- Return Error Request (O).
The source entity identifies the sender. The recipient entity identifies the
final destination. The Segmentation IE provides segmentation and message
identification for a segmented APDU. The Return Error Request may be included
to request notification in the event of unsuccessful transfer and indicate the
type of notification needed. If the recipient entity is not the final
destination, the recipient shall transfer the BSSMAP-LE Connectionless
Information message to either the final destination or an intermediate entity
capable of onward transfer to the final destination.
### 5.3.2 Unsuccessful Operation
If the message cannot be transferred by an intermediate entity or destination
entity (e.g. reassembly of a segmented message fails) and the Return Error
Request is not included, the message shall be discarded. If the Return Error
Request is included, the intermediate or destination entity shall, depending
on the Return Error Request type, send a BSSMAPâ€‘LE Connectionless Information
message to, or towards, the original source containing the following
parameters:
\- Source Entity (M);
\- Destination Entity (M);
\- APDU (C);
\- Segmentation (C);
\- Return Error Cause (M).
The Source entity shall indicate the Destination Entity in the original
received message. The Destination Entity shall indicate the Source Entity in
the original message. The Return Error cause shall indicate the reason for
unsuccessful transfer. The APDU and Segmentation IEs shall, depending on the
Return Error Request type, contain any originally received APDU and
Segmentation IEs, respectively.
If a received BSSMAP-LE Connectionless Information message containing a Return
Error Cause cannot be transferred by an intermediate entity, it shall be
discarded with no return error message.
### 5.3.3 Abnormal Conditions
At an intermediate entity, if a received BSSMAP-LE Connectionless Information
message contains unrecognized or invalid information, the message shall be
discarded.
At the recipient entity, if a received BSSMAP-LE Connectionless Information
message contains invalid or unrecognized information as defined for BSSAP-LE,
the message shall be discarded.
### 5.3.4 Segmentation
The Segmentation parameter shall not be included if the APDU is not segmented.
If the size of an APDU containing an embedded SMLCPP message is too large to
fit into one BSSMAP-LE message, the sending entity divides the SMLCPP message
to a necessary number of BSSMAP-LE messages each containing an APDU IE and a
Segmentation IE. In the APDU IE it includes as many octets as possible.
The segmentation IE contains a segment number, an indication of the final
segment and the message ID. The order number of a segment in the Segment
Number field in the APDU IE is incremented by one starting from zero, i.e. the
value is 0 for the first segment, 1 for the next and so on. The receiving
entity recognizes that a segment is missing or duplicated, when:
\- There is more than one segment with the same segment number and same
Message ID.
\- The segment number does not increase by steps of one starting from zero.
If the recipient recognizes a missing or duplicated element, it shall discard
the entire message (i.e. all received segment with the message ID).
The message identity in the Message ID field in the APDU IE is used to
recognize a particular message to which that segment belongs. The sending
entity can select any of the available values (0-65535) that is not currently
used between it and the receiving entity.
If an APDU segment is received with Return Error cause IE (due to invocation
of the return error option), reassembly does not apply and the APDU segment
and error cause maybe returned to the original source application.
## 5.4 LMU Connection Establishment
The LMU Connection Establishment procedure is applicable to the Ls interface.
Its purpose is to establish a signaling connection between an SMLC and Type A
LMU via the visted MSC for the LMU. The procedure can be initiated by either
the SMLC or MSC. The procedure makes use of SCCP connection oriented signaling
on the Ls interface.
### 5.4.1 LMU Connection Establishment initiated by the SMLC
#### 5.4.1.1 Successful Operation
The SMLC sends a BSSMAP-LE LMU Connection Request message to the VMSC for the
LMU. This message contains the following parameters.
\- IMSI (M).
\- Sender Address (O).
\- Security (C).
The IMSI identifies the LMU. The sender address, if included, identifies the
SMLC. The Security parameter shall be included if authentication or ciphering
of the LMU are required. On receipt of this message, the MSC shall attempt to
establish a signalling link to the LMU (refer to 3GPP TS 43.071).
Authentication and ciphering shall be invoked if requested by the SMLC. Once
the signaling link has been established, the MSC shall return a BSSMAP-LE LMU
Connection Accept to the SMLC with the following parameters.
\- Call Number (O).
The call number shall be included if the MSC has the capability to support
signaling to an LMU using a traffic channel (refer to 3GPP TS 43.071).
#### 5.4.1.2 Unsuccessful Operation
If the LMU is not recognized in the MSC (e.g. no VLR record) or a signaling
link cannot be setup to the LMU (e.g. paging of the LMU fails) or
authentication or ciphering cannot be performed when requested by the SMLC,
any signaling link to the LMU shall be released, if not required for other MM
or CM procedures and a BSSMAP-LE LMU Connection Reject shall be returned to
the SMLC with the following parameters.
\- Reject Cause (M).
#### 5.4.1.3 Abnormal Conditions
If the SMLC or MSC detects release of the SCCP connection on the Ls interface
for an LMU, the connection establishment procedure shall be considered to have
failed and any associated resources may be released.
### 5.4.2 LMU Connection Establishment initiated by the MSC
#### 5.4.2.1 Successful Operation
The MSC shall initiate the LMU connection establishment procedure when no LMU
connection to the SMLC currently exists and the MSC receives a CM Service
Request from the LMU specifying the LCS service. The MSC shall then send a
BSSMAP-LE LMU Connection Request message to the SMLC associated with either
the IMSI or current cell location of the LMU. This message shall contain the
following parameters.
\- IMSI (M).
\- Sender Address (M).
\- Call Number (C).
The IMSI identifies the LMU. The sender address identifies the MSC. The call
number shall be included if the MSC has the capability to support signaling to
an LMU using a traffic channel (refer to 3GPP TS 43.071). On receipt of this
message, the SMLC shall return a BSSMAP-LE LMU Connection Accept to the MSC
with the following parameters.
\- Security (C).
The Security parameter shall be included if authentication or ciphering of the
LMU are required On receipt of this message, the MSC shall perform
authentication and/or ciphering if requested by the SMLC and shall complete
the establishment of an MM connection to the LMU to support LCS.
#### 5.4.2.2 Unsuccessful Operation
If the LMU is not recognized in the SMLC or a signaling connection cannot be
supported (e.g. due to congestion), a BSSMAP-LE LMU Connection Reject shall be
returned to the MSC with the following parameters.
\- Reject Cause (M).
The MSC shall then reject the CM service request from the LMU.
#### 5.4.2.3 Abnormal Conditions
If the SMLC or MSC detects release of the SCCP connection on the Ls interface
for an LMU, the connection establishment procedure shall be considered to have
failed and any associated resources may be released.
## 5.5 (void)
## 5.6 DTAP-LE Information Transfer
The DTAP-LE Information transfer procedure is applicable to the Lb interface.
It supports two way LLP message transfer between an SMLC and Type A LMU. The
procedure is only valid when a signaling connection between an SMLC and Type A
LMU has been established. The procedure uses SCCP connection oriented
signaling using the SCCP connection previously established between the SMLC
and BSC when the signaling connection between the SMLC and LMU was
established.
### 5.6.1 DTAP-LE Information Transfer Initiated by the SMLC
The SMLC initiates the procedure when it has an LLP message to transfer to a
type A LMU. The message may first be segmented. The SMLC shall then transfer
each LLP segment to the BSC inside a DTAP-LE REGISTER, FACILITY or RELEASE
COMPLETE message. The usage of these messages is as defined in 3GPP TS 44.071.
The BSC relays each DTAP-LE message to the LMU.
### 5.6.2 DTAP-LE Information Transfer Initiated by the BSC
The BSC initiates the procedure when a DTAP message is received from an LMU.
The BSC then relays the DTAP message to the SMLC.
## 5.7 Reset
The reset procedure is an optional procedure within a PLMN applicable to the
Lb interface. It enables an SMLC or BSS that has undergone a failure with loss
of memory of LMU signalling connections and location service transactions to
indicate this to a partner entity (SMLC or BSS). The recipient entity can then
release its own connection and transaction resources. The reset procedure may
not be applicable when only a limited part of an SMLC or BSS has suffered a
failure, since error recovery procedures specific to individual connections
and transactions may then be used.
### 5.7.1 Normal Operation
In the event of a failure at an SMLC or BSS that results in the loss of LMU
connection information and location service information, a Reset message may
be sent to the partner SMLC or BSS across the Lb interface. The message
carries no parameters and is sent using connectionless SCCP procedures. The
sending entity shall ensure that all information on LMU connections and
location service transactions to the other entity is reinitialized to indicate
no existing connections and transactions.
On receiving a Reset message, the recipient SMLC or BSS shall clear all
references and state information for LMU connections and location service
transactions to the sending entity and shall release any associated resources
including, in the case of a recipient BSS, any signaling connections or
circuit connections to LMUs controlled by a sending SMLC. The recipient entity
shall then return a Reset Acknowledge message.
For a reset on the Lb interface where the SMLC and BSS support circuit
connections to LMUs (in addition to signaling connections), the entity that
does not control assignment of circuits shall initiate blocking procedures
(Block or Circuit Group Block procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 48.008) for all
circuits that are locally blocked on its own side. The initiation of blocking
may occur before sending or receipt, whichever applies, of the Reset
Acknowledge.
### 5.7.2 Abnormal Conditions
If an initiating SMLC or BSS receives no response to a Reset message following
an O&M administered time period, it shall resend the Reset message. For
successive no response conditions, sending shall occur a maximum of \"n\"
times, where \"n\" is an O&M administered parameter. Following \"n\"
unsuccessful, reset attempts, the procedure shall be terminated and
maintenance shall be informed.
## 5.8 Perform Location Information
The Perform Location Information procedure is applicable to the Lb interface.
It enables an SMLC to be informed by the BSS when a target MS in the PS domain
(A/Gb-mode) has changed serving cell. The procedure is only valid while a
location request procedure for the target MS is ongoing. The procedure makes
use of SCCP connection oriented signaling on the Lb interface and uses the
same SCCP connection as the location request procedure for the particular
target MS.
The BSS initiates the procedure when a location request procedure for the
target MS is ongoing in the PS domain and the BSS has determined that the
target MS has changed cell (e.g. by reception of a BSSGP FLUSH-LL PDU). The
BSS sends a Perform Location Information message to the SMLC. This procedure
may also optionally be initiated by the BSS for Intra-BSC handover during

## 6.2 MTP Functions
Except where defined otherwise in the present document, MTP and M3UA/SCTP
requirements on the Lb interface for the BSS are the same as those defined for
the A interface in 3GPP TS 48.006 for the BSC. MTP and M3UA/SCTP requirements
on the Lb interface for the SMLC are the same as those defined for the A
interface in 3GPP TS 48.006 for the MSC. STP functions are not required in the
SMLC and a single signaling link set may be used between the BSS and SMLC. The
BSS shall be homed to a single SMLC and shall only use the Lb signaling
interface for signaling communication with the SMLC.
## 6.3 SCCP Functions
### 6.3.1 General
Except where defined otherwise in the present document, SCCP requirements on
the Lb interface for the BSS are the same as those defined for the A interface
in 3GPP TS 48.006 for the BSC. SCCP requirements on the Lb interface for the
SMLC are the same as those defined for the A interface in 3GPP TS 48.006 for
the MSC. Requirements concerning support of a type A LMU are the same as those
in 3GPP TS 48.006 regarding support of a normal MS. In particular, usage of
SCCP to transfer DTAP-LE messages between a type A LMU and SMLC are the same
as those regarding transfer of other DTAP messages.
### 6.3.2 Modifications for Connectionless SCCP
Connectionless SCCP messages and procedures are used to transfer BSSMAP-LE
Connectionless Information messages and those BSSMAP messages applicable to
the Lb interface for which connectionless SCCP transfer is defined in 3GPP TS
48.008. Refer to 3GPP TS 43.059 for a description of the procedures in the
SMLC and BSC. SCCP protocol class 1 shall be used when multiple BSSMAP-LE
messages are transferred containing segments of a single fragmented LLP or
SMLCPP message.
### 6.3.3 Modifications for Connection Oriented SCCP
> Use of connection oriented SCCP messages and procedures on the Lb interfaces
> to support signaling access to a type A LMU using DTAP-LE, DTAP and BSSMAP
> messages is the same as that defined in 3GPP TS 48.006 on the A interface to
> support access to a normal MS.
>
> To support positioning of a target MS, connection oriented SCCP messages and
> procedures using protocol class 2 shall be used to transfer BSSMAP-LE
> positioning messages and BSSMAP-LE Connection Oriented Information messages
> over the Lb interface. A separate dedicated SCCP connection shall be used to
> support positioning for each target MS. Connection establishment shall be
> instigated by the BSS when the positioning attempt commences. Connection
> release shall be instigated by either the BSS or SMLC when the positioning
> attempt has been completed or has failed. The SMLC is primarily responsible
> for ensuring release -- e.g. in the event that the BSS waits for the SMLC to
> instigate release.
>
> Transfer of BSSMAP-LE messages using an SCCP connection to support
> positioning of a particular target MS is shown in the following figure. In
> particular, a BSSMAP-LE message shall be included in the data field of the
> SCCP CR and a BSSMAP-LE message may be included in the data field of an SCCP
> CC, CREF or RLSD message.
Figure 6.3.3: SCCP Connection Oriented Signaling on Lb Interface for
Positioning
### 6.3.4 Contents of the SCCP Data Field
> The contents of the SCCP data field are the same as that defined for the A
> interface in 3GPP TS 48.006 for MSC-BSC signaling. In particular, the same
> conventions are used to transfer and discriminate between any BSSAP and DTAP
> message contained within the SCCP data field. Since all BSSAP-LE messages
> applicable to the Lb interface use the same encoding as for the A interface,
> the conventions used to discriminate a BSSMAP message are applicable to any
> BSSMAP-LE message on the Lb interface, while the conventions for a DTAP
> message apply to any DTAP-LE message.
### 6.3.5 Abnormal Conditions
If a user-out-of-service information or signalling-point-inaccessible
information is received by a BSS or SMLC, no new attempt to establish SCCP
connections towards the affected point code shall be started until the
corresponding user-in-service information or signalling-point-accessible
information is received.
When a user-out-of-service information or signalling-point-inaccessible is
received, an optional timer may be started. If the timer expires all the SCCP
connections towards the affected point code shall be released. When the user-
in-service or signalling-point-accessible is received, the timer is stopped.
If an SCCP connection is released, the optional timer expires or a connection
refusal is received, any dependent BSSAP-LE procedure between the SMLC and BSS
shall be terminated and, at a BSS, any associated SCCP connection or location
service transaction to an MSC, or any associated signaling or circuit
connection to an LMU, shall be released using appropriate signalling
procedures.
# 7 (void)
# 8 Use of BSSAP-LE on the Lp Interface
## 8.1 Applicable Message Sets
The following BSSAP-LE messages are applicable to the Lp interface between an
SMLC and a peer SMLC.
\- BSSMAP-LE Connectionless Information message.
## 8.2 MTP Functions
SS7 signaling on the Lp interface may be supported using 56 kbps or 64 kbps
digital signaling channels. These may be supported within either E1 or T1
physical links.
Two SMLCs may be connected by direct point-to-point SS7 signaling links or
links may be employed via intermediate STPs. Alternatively, signaling transfer
between two SMLCs may be supported via intermediate BSSs and/or MSCs using the
Lb and/or Ls interfaces. Signaling requirements to support message transfer on
the Lp interface via an intermediate Lb interface are the same as those
defined elsewhere in the present document for these interfaces. This sub-
clause defines the requirements applicable to direct SMLC-SMLC SS7 links and
SS7 links from an SMLC to an STP.
For E1 links or where ITU-T/ITU SS7 signaling is applicable, the MTP functions
as specified in ITU-T Recommendations Q.702, Q.703, Q.704 and Q.707 are
applicable. For T1 links or where ANSI SS7 signaling is applicable, the MTP
functions as specified in ANSI T1.111 are applicable. Only the requirements in
these recommendations for a signaling end point are applicable.
Where an SMLC has no signaling links to an STP, certain exceptions and
modifications to normal ITU-T and ANSI requirements may be applied within a
PLMN administration.
It is recommended that when IP transport (via M3UA/SCTP) is used, the data
link layer is implemented using Ethernet. A node using IP transport having
interfaces connected via low bandwidth PPP links like E1/T1 shall also support
IP Header Compression [25] and the PPP extensions ML/MC-PPP [26], [27]. In
this case, the negotiation of header compression [25] over PPP shall be
performed according to [28].
## 8.3 SCCP functions
### 8.3.1 General
For E1 links or where ITU-T/ITU SS7 signaling is applicable, the SCCP
functions as specified in either ITU-T Blue Book Recommendations Q.711, Q.712,
Q.713 and Q.714 or ITU White Book Recommendations Q.711, Q.712, Q.713 and
Q.714 are applicable, as amended by the exceptions and modifications defined
here. For T1 links or where ANSI SS7 signaling is applicable, the MTP
functions as specified in ANSI T1.112 are applicable, as amended by the
exceptions and modifications defined here. For M3UA/SCTP signalling, functions
as specified in 3GPP TS 29.202 [29] are applicable, as amended by the
exceptions and modifications defined here.

\- Inactivity Test (IT);
\- Subsystem Allowed (SSA);
\- Subsystem Prohibited (SSP);
\- Subsystem Status Test (SST);
\- Unitdata (UDT);
\- Unitdata Service (UDTS).
Support of only SCCP protocol classes 0 and 1 is required.
The SCCP called party address in a UDT may contain only the subsystem number
(SSN) or a signaling point code (SPC) plus SSN or a global title. Use of a
global title is not required for SMLC to SMLC signaling within the same PLMN.
SSN values applicable to the Lp interface are defined in 3GPP TS 23.003.
### 8.3.3 Allowed Exceptions to ANSI T1.112
Only the following SCCP messages are applicable to the Lp interface:
\- Inactivity Test (IT);
\- Subsystem Allowed (SSA);

# 10 Message format and information element coding
This sub-clause specifies the coding of the Information Elements used by the
BSSAP-LE protocol. The spare bits in the coding of an IE shall be set to zero
by the sender and shall be ignored by the receiver.
All unassigned codes (whether omitted or explicitely _Unassigned_ in the text)
shall be treated as unknown.
The following conventions are assumed for the sequence of transmission of bits
and bytes:
\- Each bit position is marked as 1 to 8. Bit 1 is the least significant bit
and is transmitted first.
\- In an element octets are identified by number, octet 1 is transmitted
first, then octet 2 etc.
When a field extends over more than one octet, the order of bit values
progressively decreases as the octet number increases. The least significant
bit of the field is represented by the lowest numbered bit of the highest
numbered octet of the field.
\- For variable length elements a length indicator is included, this indicates
the number of octets following in the element.
\- All fields within Information Elements are mandatory unless otherwise
specified. The Information Element Identifier shall always be included.
All spare bits are set to 0.
For any information element of format TLV, the length indicator octet, as in
3GPP TS 48.008, defines the number of octets in the information element that
follow the length indicator octet.
## 10.1 Message type
Message type uniquely identifies the message being sent. It is a single octet
element, mandatory in all messages.

**GANSS TOD**
This field contains the reference time of the first bit of the requested data
in integer seconds in GANSS system time. The time is given as modulo 60 s from
GANSS TOD.
**GANSS Signals: signal1 -- signal8 (Extension Octet 4)**
Each bit in Extension Octet 4 specifies the GANSS signal type of the GANSS
Data Bit Assistance requested. The GANSS Signals value shall be interpreted as
in Table A.59 of 3GPP TS 44.031 [4].
**GANSS Data Bit Interval**
This field represents the time length for which the Data Bit Assistance is
requested. The Data Bit Assistance shall be relative to the time interval
(GANSS TOD, GANSS TOD + Data Bit Interval).
The Data Bit Interval _r_ , expressed in seconds, is mapped to a binary number
K with the following formula:
_r_ =0.1* 2 ^K^
Value K=15 means that the time interval is not specified.
The number of bits sent by the SMLC shall be estimated exploiting information
about Data Bit Interval (sec) and Symbol Rate (sps). This number of bits shall
be rounded up to the next higher multiple of 8. The total number of bits for
each signal shall not exceed 1024 as defined in A.4.2.6.2 of 3GPP TS 44.031
[4].

**GANSS Week (bits 5-8 octet m+3+a and octet m+4+a)**
If GANSS ID does not indicate 'GLONASS', this field contains a 12 bit binary
representation of the GANSS Week of the assistance currently held by the MS.
The most significant bit of the GANSS Week is bit 8 in octet m+3+a and the
least significant bit is bit 1 in octet m+4+a.
If GANSS ID is set to 'GLONASS', this field contains a 11 bit binary
representation of the calendar number of day within the four-year interval
starting from 1^st^ of January in a leap year, as defined by the parameter
N~T~ in [31] of the assistance currently held by the MS. The most significant
bit of N~T~ is bit 7 in octet m+3+a and the least significant bit is bit 1 in
octet m+4+a. Bit 8 in octet m+3+a shall be set to zero.
**GANSS_Toe (octet m+5+a)**
If GANSS ID does not indicate 'GLONASS', this field contains a binary
representation of the GANSS time of ephemeris in hours of the newest ephemeris
set contained in handset memory (range 0-167 hours).
If GANSS ID is set to 'GLONASS', this field contains a binary representation
of the time of ephemeris in units of 15 minutes of the newest ephemeris set
contained in handset memory (binary range 0 to 95 representing time values
between 0 and 1425 minutes).
**NSAT (octet m+6+a, bits 5-8)**
This field contains a binary representation of the number of satellites to be
considered for the current GANSS assistance request. If the MS has no GANSS
ephemeris data, this field shall be set to zero. If the MS has GANSS ephemeris
data whose age exceeds the T-Toe limit, this field may be set to zero. If the
SMLC receives a zero value for this field, it shall ignore the GANSS Week/Day
and GANSS_Toe fields and assume that the MS has no GANSS ephemeris data.
**T-Toe limit (octet m+6+a, bits 1-4)**
If GANSS ID does not indicate 'GLONASS', this field contains a binary
representation of the GANSS ephemeris age tolerance of the MS to the network
in hours (range 0-10 hours).
If GANSS ID is set to 'GLONASS', this field contains a binary representation
of the GANSS ephemeris age tolerance of the MS to the network in units of 30
minutes (binary range 0 to 15 representing time values of 0 to 450 minutes).
**GANSSSatID x (x = 1,2, ... n) (octet m+5+a + 2x, bits 1-6)**
This field is present only if NSAT exceeds zero and contains a binary
representation of the identity of a GANSS satellite for which the assistance
request is applicable. The number of satellite fields is indicated in the
field NSAT.
**IOD x (x = 1,2, ... n) (bits 7-8 octet m+5+a+2x and octet m+6+a + 2x)**
This field is present only if NSAT exceeds zero and contains a binary
representation of the Issue of Data as defined in 3GPP TS 44.031 [4], Table
A.48.2 held in the MS, which identifies the GANSS Navigation Model for a
satellite x (x = 1, 2, ..., n). The SMLC shall derive the issue date and time
for the IOD of each GANSS satellite x from the GANSS Week/Day and GANSS_Toe
fields (e.g. when a particular IOD value for a GANSS satellite x was issued
more than once within the period of T-Toe limit). The most significant bit of
the IOD x is bit 8 in octet m+5+a+2x and the least significant bit is bit 1 in
octet m+6+a+2x.
