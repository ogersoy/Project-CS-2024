# Introduction
MBMS user services can be built on top of the MBMS bearer service. The present
document describes the usage of the two delivery methods, which are defined in
[6]. The two delivery methods are streaming and download. Examples of
applications using the download delivery method are news and software
upgrades. Delivery of live music is an example of an application using the
streaming delivery method.
The objective of the present document is to provide an overview of the MBMS
System, and describes how the MBMS User Services use the MBMS Bearer Services.

# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Phasing model
{width="5.998611111111111in" height="4.324305555555555in"}
Figure 1: Mapping between MBMS Bearer and User Service phases
This mapping is applicable for the MBMS Broadcast and Multicast Modes.
It is assumed that the MBMS bearer service phases \"Session start\" and \"MBMS
notification\" are handled autonomously and without interaction from the
receiver application perspective.
It is assumed, that the Session Start phase \"triggers\" MBMS Notification
phase.
## 4.2 System overview
Figure 2 gives an overview of functions for MBMS user services based on the
MBMS download and the MBMS streaming delivery methods. The figure includes the
MBMS User service provision phases (arrow on the right side of the figure).
The Phase \"MBMS User Service activation / deactivation\" is an individual
phase and is generally triggered by a user action. The break in the sequence
indicates that the service activation phases are independent from the session
start/stop and the data transfer phases. The service provider initiates the
establishment of the MBMS User Plane (Session Start/Stop and the Data Transfer
Phases) when there is content to be transmitted.
{width="6.3381944444444445in" height="4.690277777777778in"}
Figure 2: MBMS system overview
The MBMS Bearer Services are embedded in MBMS User Service procedures. The
major part of the data is transferred via the MBMS Bearer Service. MBMS User
Services include Associated-Delivery procedures (e.g. file repair) to augment
the original MBMS Bearer sessions. Security functions are incorporated into
the overview figure. One dedicated user authentication procedure is depicted
in conjunction with the MBMS Bearer Service Activation procedure within the
Session Establishment phase.
The figure contains client and network functions. Interactions, which are only
applicable for the MBMS Multicast Mode, are marked accordingly.
# 5 Description of User Service procedures
## 5.1 User Service Discovery / Announcement
The \"User Service Discovery / Announcement\" phase provides all necessary
information about available services and needed parameters to become member of
a service. User Service Discovery / Announcement mechanism can provide
information on available MBMS User services in pull mode, via the Web or WAP
Portals, or in push mode, via SMS or MBMS Download based User Service.
The User Service Discovery / Announcement phase provides all necessary
information for the \"Service Activation\" triggered by the UE. The necessary
session parameters to configure the service activation are provided according
to Session Description Protocol (SDP) specification (RFC 2327 [14]), which are
complemented by additional information containing additional service
parameters. Additionally, Service Discovery includes DRM/security
descriptions.
In the case of a size-limited delivery method (e.g. SMS, MMS) being used
during the Service Announcement / Discovery phase, it should be recognized
that Service Announcement messages are not of fixed length. Methods of
limiting the size of the message may be adopted. It is suggested that should a
size-limited delivery method be selected, parameters such as URI lengths and
the number of Connection data and Media announcement fields should be chosen
appropriately.
## 5.2 User Service Initiation / termination procedure
For MBMS User service activation, the UE needs to perform a security function
and the MBMS Bearer Service activation procedures. In the case of MBMS
Multicast Mode, an IGMP or MLD message is sent via a \"default\" PDP context
and triggers the creation of the MBMS UE context in various nodes. A MBMS
Bearer Service (BS) context is only created once when the very first MBMS UE
context is created in a node. In the case of MBMS Broadcast Mode, network-side
elements establish the MBMS BS context without requiring user initiated
messaging. The basic idea behind these procedures is that several UEs share
one single bearer. The IP Multicast address and information for the MBMS User
Service receiving application is given via the MBMS Service Discovery
mechanism.
In case the service requires user authentication, security procedures are
performed before the MBMS bearer Service Activation procedure. The \"user
authentication\" procedure is a service optional security procedure. A
password is derived from the shared secret (result of a GBA run) and used in
the http-digest security procedure to authenticate the user (see 3GPP TS
33.220 [7] and 3GPP TS 33.346 [8] for further details).
The \"User Authentication & Service Membership\" phase provides procedures to
register and authenticate users. The procedures shall follow the security
specifications. In the case of MBMS Multicast Mode, this phase may authorize
the service activation request from the UE. This function is present when
security procedures like authentication and traffic encryption are required.
## 5.3 Session Start / Stop
According to the 3GPP TS 23.246 [4], the BM-SC controls the activation and the
release of the MBMS User plane (switching of the MBMS BS context between
\"Active\" and \"Idle\"). The Service Provider might trigger this process on
the availability of new content. The release of the user plane resources
depends on the transmission duration of the content. The transmission duration
depends in case of the MBMS Download User Service on the content size, on the
(optional) Forward-Error-Correction (FEC) overhead for error protection and
the bitrate of the MBMS bearer.
## 5.4 Data transmission
The \"MBMS User Service Transmitter\" contains the MBMS User Service specific
transmission protocols. Optionally, the content is protected by a Forward
Error Correction (FEC) code. The traffic is sent using either IP unicast
addressing or IP Multicast addressing via the BM-SC onto the MBMS Bearer
Service. Note, the BM-SC is able to take IP Unicast and IP Multicast traffic
as input according to 3GPP TS 23.246 [4].
In case of IP Unicast, the BM-SC is directly addressed by the MBMS User
Service Transmitter and relays the traffic to IP Multicast. In case of IP
Multicast, the traffic is forwarded by the BM-SC and the MBMS User Service
Transmitter forwards the data to an IP Multicast group. Additionally the MC-
Relay in the BM-SC may perform additional source authentication procedures to
avoid unauthorized traffic entering the Core Network.
The \"MBMS User Service Receiver\" combines the reception via the MBMS Bearer
Service and interactive bearer services in a controlled way. Optional
\"Associated-Delivery Processing Servers\" are invoked after the actual MBMS
data reception from the clients. A typical associated-delivery procedure is a
point-to-point file repair mechanism for delivering missing data to clients of
an MBMS Download session, which perceived packet losses that are unrecoverable
during the broadcast/multicast transmission. The load of the point-to-point
repair mechanism may be spread randomly in time and also across network
elements. The MBMS Bearer Service may be configured to provide a constant or
variable bit rate as requested by the MBMS User Service. The MBMS Bearer
Service is expected to be service independent and can be configured by a
Network Provider for MBMS Download and MBMS Streaming User Services.
## 5.5 Associated-Delivery procedures
Associated-delivery procedures may also include the usage of MBMS bearers.
### 5.5.1 File Repair service
It should be possible for UEs to repair erroneous files, delivery by the
download delivery method, by means of repair request and response operations.
### 5.5.2 Content reception reporting
It should be however possible for the operator to collect statistical data
such as lost frames, assigned resources, bit-rates achieved, etc. (3GPP TS
22.246 [3]).
# 6 Delivery methods
## 6.1 Download delivery method
The MBMS Download Delivery Method allows the error-free transmission of files
via the unidirectional MBMS Bearer Services. The files are \"downloaded\" and
stored in the local files-system of the user equipment. The network triggers
the transmission since the users are registered to the download service. There
is no further user request necessary after the service registration. Files may
contain multimedia components or any other binary data. The MBMS Download
Delivery Method allows the transmission of an arbitrary number of files within
a single data transfer phase.
{width="5.99375in" height="1.5291666666666666in"}
Figure 3: Definition of MBMS Download Sessions
Figure 4 is an example of an MBMS User Service based on the Download Delivery
Method. The file transmission events are organized in MBMS Download Sessions.
Each session is started with a File Delivery Table (FDT) instance, which
describes in this example each file within the MBMS Download Session in terms
of file name and file type (MIME Content Type). The service operator and the
actual service would determine the timing of MBMS Download Sessions.
Users of the download-based MBMS User Service are not required to recognize
the MBMS Downloading process itself, the reception may be happening completely
in background. The user may be only informed about the completion of a MBMS
download and that there is new content available on the terminal. Depending on
the service, the MBMS Download session may require time-critical delivery of
content.
### 6.1.1 SDL diagram of the download delivery method for the MBMS UE
Figure 4 and figure 5 describes the operation of an MBMS download receiver.
The MBMS UE performs the steps described in the SDL diagram for each received
Transport Object. An MBMS FDT may include a number of transmission objects,
each identified by a unique Transmission Object Identifier (TOI).
The SDL identifies four states of the MBMS UE. A brief description of these
states follows:
\- The \"**standby** \" state reflects the state of the MBMS UE, in which MBMS
download receiver is initialized and bound to one specific download channel
(IP Multicast Address/Port plus Source Address). Note, the MBMS bearer is not
in active state.
\- The \"**Object Reception** \" state reflects the state of the MBMS UE, in
which the MBMS UE is receiving data for transport objects. The Transport
Object Identifier (TOI) identifies one transport object. The UE may receive
FDT Instance updates related to the object being downloaded, in which case it
should update the corresponding information for that object.
\- The \"**defer file repair** \" state reflects the state of the MBMS UE, in
which the MBMS UE deferring the file repair request message. Deferring the
file repair request message is described in clause 9.3.4 of 3GPP TS26.346 [6].
\- The \"**defer reception reporting** \" state reflects the state of the MBMS
UE, in which the MBMS UE deferring the file repair request message. Deferring
the file repair request message is described in clause 9.4.4 of 3GPP TS 26.346
[6].

NOTE: Statistical Reports for download are only sent, if either a \"Close
session flag\" (see clause 7.2.6) is received or a the \"time to\" value of
the session description (from \"t=\" in SDP) is reached or a UE decides to
exit the session.

of the MBMS UE
### 6.1.2 Transport of MBMS download data
This clause explains briefly how files are constructed for and transported
during a FLUTE session.
The BM-SC takes a file, e.g. a video clip or a still image, which is used as
the transport object for FLUTE (see figure 6). The BM-SC constructs source
block by breaking the file into contiguous portions of approximately equal
size. Each source block is broken into source symbols. One or more encoding
symbols are carried as the payload of a FLUTE packet, thus the encoding symbol
size must divide the FLUTE packet size. The target FLUTE packet size is
configured by the BM-SC and, together with the file size, is used to determine
the encoding symbol length. Note that when FEC is used with smaller files it
is often necessary to include several symbols in each FLUTE packet. This means
that the FLUTE packets cannot be fixed at a specific arbitrary size by the
operator, because they must be a multiple of the number of symbols required
per packet in size. Based on the transport object length, the encoding symbol
length and the maximum source block length, FLUTE calculates the source block
structure (i.e., the number of source blocks and their length).
{width="5.34375in" height="1.7243055555555555in"}
Figure 6: Constructing FLUTE packets
The BM-SC communicates the transport object length, the encoding symbol length
and the file size to the receivers within the FLUTE session transmission. Thus
the receiver can also calculate the source block structure in advance of
receiving a file.
The FLUTE packet is constructed from FLUTE header and payload containing one
or more encoding symbols.
The distinction between file and transport object is that the file is the
object provided to the BM-SC and played-out or stored at the MBMS UE. Within
the scope of FLUTE sessions, content encoding may be used, for instance to
compress the file with gzip for delivery. In the presence of FLUTE session
content encoding, the file and the transport object will be different binary
objects, and in the absence of content encoding the transport object will be
identical to the file. Any symbol calculations (including FEC) are performed
on transport objects.
EXAMPLE 1: File size: 1 MB (1 048 576 bytes)\ Target packet size (payload):
500 bytes\ Maximum source symbols: 8 192 (defined by FEC code)\ Minimum source
block target: 1 024 (recommended by FEC code)\ Symbol alignment parameter: 4
bytes
Based on the recommendations of 3GPP TS 26.346 [6], clause B.3.4.1, then the
above parameters would lead to 1 symbol of 500 bytes per packet and the file
would be treated as a single source block with 2 098 symbols.
EXAMPLE 2: File size: 16 MB (16 777 216 bytes)\ Target packet size (payload):
250 bytes\ Maximum source symbols: 8 192 (defined by FEC code)\ Minimum source
block target: 1 024 (recommended by FEC code)\ Symbol alignment parameter: 4
bytes
This would result in 1 symbol of 248 bytes per packet and the file being
broken into 9 source blocks, 2 source blocks will have size 7616 symbols and
the remaining 7 will have size 7 517 symbols.
EXAMPLE 3: File size: 256 KB (262 144 bytes)\ Target packet size (payload):
500 bytes\ Maximum source symbols: 8 192 (defined by FEC code)\ Minimum source
block target: 1 024 (recommended by FEC code)\ Symbol alignment parameter: 4
bytes
This would result in 2 symbols of 248 bytes each per packet and the file being
treated as a single source block of 1 058 symbols.
### 6.1.3 Repair Symbol Request
In 3GPP TS 26.346 [6], clause 9.3.3, on \"Identification of Missing Data from
an MBMS Download\", it is stated that an MBMS UE is able to identify the ESI
values of required source and/or repair symbols that would complete the
reconstruction of a source block (of a file) and that the corresponding
symbols can be requested from the server. Especially for the case when MBMS
FEC scheme is used, the MBMS client should either:
1\. identify a minimal set of source symbols that, combined with the already
received symbols, allow the MBMS FEC decoder to recover the file; or
2\. identify a number, _r_ , of symbols such that reception of _r_ previously
non-received symbols will allow the MBMS FEC decoder to recover the file.
Option 1 (clause 6.1.3.1) is more appropriate if only very few symbols are
lost as the signalling of only very few symbols is more efficient. In
contrast, option 2 (clause 6.1.3.3) is appropriate in the case where a
significant amount of symbols are not available. To minimize the uplink
traffic, sending only the initial symbol ESI and the amount of requested
consecutive symbols is more appropriate. The decision which option to use is
up to the MBMS client.
For both options, example algorithms to determine a suitable set of repair
symbols are presented in the following. For option 1 the derivation of a
minimum set of source symbols and for option 2 the derivation of a sufficient
set of consecutive repair symbols is described based on the initial matrix
**A** as constructed in 3GPP TS 26.346 [6], clause C.2.1. In both cases, a
maximum Gaussian elimination as described below is performed on **A**. Then,
the matrix is virtually extended by those rows which, for option 1, represent
the missing source symbols and, for option 2, a set of consecutive repair
symbols. Maximum Gaussian elimination is again performed on this new matrix.
With appropriate tracking of row and column labels this process allows finding
an appropriate set of ESIs for repair of the source block as requested in 3GPP
TS 26.346 [6], clause 9.3.3. Note that almost all parts of described
algorithms can be included in the regular FEC decoding process as specified in
annex C such that the decoding complexity is minimized. Nevertheless, the
description of the following algorithms is based on the unmodified matrix
**A**.
#### 6.1.3.1 Option 1: Determination of a minimum set of source symbols for
repair
The following algorithm operating on matrix **A,** is used to determine a
minimum set of source symbols for successful recovery:
1\. Assume **c** to be the column index vector of length _L_ with labels such
that column exchanges can be tracked, e.g. for all _i_ =0, ..., _L_ -1
c[_i_]=_i_.
2\. Apply the maximum Gaussian elimination process, as described below, to
**A** , with tracking of column labels **c**. The process returns matrices
**U** and **W** as well as the modified column label vector **c\'** of
dimension _L_.
3\. Generate an _m_ by _L_ matrix **G\'** , whereby _m_ is equal to the number
of non-received source symbols as follows. Consider **GLT** to be the _K_ by
_L_ generator matrix that corresponds to the outer LT encoder of the Raptor
code generating the first _K_ encoding symbols according to figure 3GPP TS
26.346 [6], clause B.5.2.5.2-1. The matrix **G** \' is constructed from matrix
**GLT** by deleting the rows corresponding to already received encoding
symbols and by exchanging the columns according to **c** \'. In addition, the
rows in **G\'** get assigned the corresponding ESIs and these labels are
tracked in **v** \'.
4\. A new decoding matrix **A** \' is constructed in the following way:
* * *
U W G\'
* * *
Figure 7: New decoding matrix A\'
5\. In addition, a row label vector **v** is generated by the vertical
stacking of **n** and **v\'** , i.e. **v** =[**n** T **v** \'T]T whereby **n**
represents a vector containing any rank(**U**)=dim(**U**) entries such that
any label of **n** can be distinguished from any label in **v** \'. In the
remainder we assume **n** being an all -1 vector of dimension rank(**U**).
6\. Apply the maximum Gaussian elimination process to **A** \', as described
in clause 6.1.3.3, with tracking of row labels **v**. The process returns the
exchanged row labels **v***.
7\. The ESIs of the encoding symbols forming a minimum set of repair symbols
are obtained by the labels in **v*** which are not -1.
#### 6.1.3.2 Option 2: Determination of a sufficient set of consecutive
encoding symbols for repair
The following algorithm operating on matrix **A** is used to determine a
sufficient set of consecutive encoding symbols for successful repair:
1\. Assume **c** to be the column index vector of length _L_ with labels such
that column exchanges can be tracked, e.g. for all _i_ =0, ..., _L_ -1
c[_i_]=_i_.
2\. Apply the maximum Gaussian elimination process, as described below, to
**A** , with tracking of column labels **c**. The process returns matrices
**U** and **W** as well as the modified column label vector c\' of dimension
_L_.
3\. Assume that _R_ low is one higher than the largest ESI received and that
_R_ high= _R_ low+_m_ -1. Generate an _m_ by _L_ matrix G\', whereby _m_ is
equal to or only slightly greater than the minimum number of missing repair
symbols _L_ -rank(U) by vertically stacking rows that correspond to the outer
LT encoder of the Raptor code for all ESI from _R_ low, ..., _R_ high.
4\. A new decoding matrix **A** \' is constructed according to figure 7.
5\. Apply the maximum Gaussian elimination process to **A** \' which returns
some different **U** and **W** as described in clause 6.1.3.3.
6\. If **W** is not the empty matrix, then:
  * Set _R_ high= _R_ high+1
  * Generate an 1 by L matrix **G** \' constructed according to the outer > LT encoder of the Raptor code for ESI=_R_ high.
  * Go to 4
7\. the ESIs of the encoding symbols forming a minimum set of repair symbols
are obtained by requesting all symbols with ESI from _R_ low, ..., _R_ high.
#### 6.1.3.3 Maximum Gaussian elimination
Assume that we have given any matrix **X** as well as possibly a vector of row
labels **v** or possibly a column label vector **c** or possibly both. A
maximum Gaussian elimination is an algorithm similar to standard Gaussian
elimination, in which the main diagonal is extended to its maximum limit,
i.e., the number of 1s in the main diagonal after this algorithm has been
applied, correspond to the rank of the input matrix **X** , i.e.,
rank(**X**)..
To be more specific assume that matrix **X** is conceptually divided into 4
parts as shown in figure 8.
* * *
U W Z B
* * *
Figure 8: Conceptual division of X into 4 blocks
where **U** is a square-upper-matrix with 1s in the main diagonal and zeros
below the main diagonal, **Z** is a zero matrix and **W** and **B** are any
arbitrary matrices with appropriate dimensions. Initially, **U** , **W** , and
**Z** have dimensions such that **B** =**X**.
In the maximum Gaussian elimination process, the matrix **X** and if present,
the row label vector **v** and column label vector **c** , are now processed
and modified in the following way:
1\. Partition the matrix **X** in **U** , **Z** , **W** , and **B** as shown
in figure 8 such that **U** is a square-upper-matrix with 1s in the main
diagonal and zeros below the main diagonal, **Z** is a zero matrix and **W**
and **B** are any arbitrary matrices with appropriate dimensions.
2\. If **B** is the zero matrix, the algorithm stops and returns matrices
**U** and **W** , if **v** is present, the first rank(**U**) components of
**v** in some vector **v** \', and if **c** is present, the entire vector
**c**.
3\. Otherwise, **B** is transformed using row/column exchange(s) into a matrix
with a 1 the in upper-left corner. The following operations on **B** are
allowed:
a) row exchange, accompanied by the exchange of row labels in **v** , if
present.
b) column exchange, accompanied by the exchange of column labels in **c** , if
present.
4\. by means of row additions, the rows of **B** (except the first row) are
eliminated, i.e. 0s are produced in all rows of the first column of **B**
except for the first row.
5\. the process restarts with the updated matrix **X** in 1.
### 6.1.4 On choosing the SDU size
This clause provides a simple analysis that suggests how to choose the SDU
size. The crux of the analysis is to notice that there is a fundamental
tradeoff between two competing factors that suggest how to choose the SDU
size. The two factors are the relative length of the SDU header compared to
the SDU size, and the SDU loss rate induced by PDU loss. Generally the SDU
header size is fixed by other considerations, and the PDU loss rate is
determined by characteristics of the underlying network. Given a fixed SDU
header size and PDU loss rate, making the SDU larger means the header wastes
less space per SDU, whereas making the SDU smaller means the SDU loss induced
by PDU loss is smaller. The MBMS FEC code has the property that data (which is
a source file in the case of the file download service or a source block in
the case of the streaming service) can be recovered with high probability from
the reception of any set of encoding packets only slightly greater in length
to the data, independent of packet loss amounts or patterns. The loss of SDUs
has the same negative impact on wasted bandwidth in terms of delivering the
data as the wasted (but necessary) SDU header space. Thus, the goal is to
choose an SDU length so that the bandwidth wasted due to headers and SDU loss
induced by PDU loss is minimized. (It is important to note that this is not
trying to minimize total SDU loss, only the contribution to SDU loss due to
PDU loss. Other sources of SDU loss, e.g. cell change loss, cell congestion
loss, backbone loss, UE unavailable loss, all independently contribute to
bandwidth wastage but do not affect the analysis of how to choose the SDU size
based on balancing the header wastage against the PDU loss induced wastage.)
#### 6.1.4.1 Analysis
Let _H_ be the SDU header size (which for example consists of the IP/UDP/FLUTE
headers), let _B_ be the PDU size and let _p_ be the PDU loss probability, and
all of these parameters are fixed. Let _P_ be the overall SDU size (including
headers) that is to be set based on the fixed parameters. Let _h_ = _H_ /_P_
be the fractional header wastage. For example, if _H_ = 44 bytes, _P_ = 440
bytes then _h_ = 0.1. Let _q_ be the SDU loss probability induced by PDU loss.
To optimize the value of _P_ , one would want to choose the value of _P_ to
make _h_ \+ _q_ minimal. The contribution [1] derives the value of _q_ as a
function of _P_ and _B_ and _p_. From 3GPP TR 21.905 [1], and using _N_ Â· _p_
as an upper bound on the probability that _N_ PDUs are lost, an upper bound on
the value of _q_ is (1+_P_ /_B_)Â· _p_. The actual value of _q_ is at least (1
- Îµ/2) times this upper bound when _N_ Â· _p_ \

## 7.2 MBMS download delivery method
The MBMS Download Services use the functionality of the MBMS Download Delivery
Method, although other user services may also build on this delivery method.
Users are informed, via the UI, that new information is locally available.
However, this is not a constraint or a requirement of an MBMS download user
service. User notification and user-interaction with the download process may
or may not be part of a download application UI.
After the data transmission phase the MBMS User Service Receiver may request
missing data from a \"Associated-Delivery Processing Server\". Output of the
MBMS Receiver is in case of the MBMS Download delivery method a \"file\". The
further processing of the received data and the proper presentation is not in
scope of the present document. It is assumed existing user play-out.
### 7.2.1 Example: Video clip download service use-case
#### 7.2.1.1 Use-case description
The UE has activated a video-clip distribution service. The service starts 5th
of August 2005 and ends on 18th of December (half football season). The UE
receives every Saturday afternoon (during a time of 4 hours) approximately
every 30 minutes a video clip. The BM-SC has the Ipv4 address: 192.168.1.1 and
uses the multicast IP address 224.20.20.4 for service distribution.
#### 7.2.1.2 Announced Metadata Fragments
The MBMS User Service is active from the 5th of August until the 18th of
December. The MBMS bearers are activated, if there is any video clip to
distribute. Video clips are mostly distributed during weekends, seldom during
the week.
To activate the video clip service, the client has received the following
metadata fragments through a service announcement procedure:

The t= lines includes the session start and session stop information. Session
start is 3332188800 (== 5th of August 2005) and session stop is 3343766400 (==
18th of December 2005).
The User service description and the session description fragments are used to
activate the MBMS bearer service with multicast IP address 224.20.20.4 and
TMGI 1234. The user service uses in this use-case an MBMS broadcast bearer
service. The bearer service remains active until the 18th of December.
File Repair Procedure Fragment:
The post delivery file repair procedure is configured with a back-off window
of 40 seconds. It was assumed, that a group of 5 000 UEs need 10 kByte each of
repair data, assuming that the file repair server can provide repair data with
a capacity of 10 Mbps.

#### 7.2.1.3 Reception of a video clip
The download transmission session starts on the 7th of August 2005, 19:18h in
this use-case. The download transmission session contains only one FLUTE file
delivery table (FDT), one file and an update of the Associated Delivery
Procedure Description (ADPD) instance. The size of the file is 300 kbyte. The
file transmission is FEC protected using the MBMS FEC code. A redundancy
overhead of 16 % is added to the file transmission. The FDT instance and ADPD
instance are not FEC protected because they are too small in size to benefit
from FEC protection. To ensure their reliable delivery, FDT instance and ADPD
instance may be transmitted repeatedly.
Note that ADPD has critical information relevant to point-to-point file repair
and delivery verification reports. If the ADPD is sent in-band alone and is
lost during in-band FLUTE transmission, then point-to-point file repair is not
possible. Hence it is recommended to provide a default ADPD instance in User
Service Description. The most recently delivered configuration file takes
priority. ADPD received in-band with the download session, overwrites earlier
received parameters. In this example, the update of the Associated Procedure
Description instance contains the URI of an additional repair server.

Figure 9: Delivery of video clip
The FLUTE File delivery table is transmitted using the Transport Object ID
number 0. The BM-SC starts sending the FLUTE FDT packets at 19:18h.
The TSI and the TOI fields are set to 16bit respectively. The TSI value for
the session is 116. TOI value for FLUTE FDT packets is 0. The length of the
FDT Instance object is 681 byte. The Compact No Code FEC is used for FDT
transmission. The symbol length is set to 512 byte. Maximum source block
length is set to 1000.

Figure 10: FLUTE FDT packet header
The FLUTE File Delivery Table instance for this use-case is depicted below.
The FDT instance expires on the 7th of August 2005, 19:58:46h (3332430520 in
NTP format).
\
\
\
\
\
The FEC Encoding ID field identifies the MBMS FEC scheme (i.e. Raptor Code).
The value \"1\" is assigned by IETF to the Raptor Code.
The value of the FEC scheme specific info is base64 Binary encoded. The base
64 value \"MDAwMTAyMDQ=\" decodes to 0x10204hex (Z = 1; N = 2; A = 4).
The FDT expiration time (i.e. \"expire\" attribute) is an unsigned integer
representing the time in seconds relative to 0 hours 1 January 1900 (i.e. the
32 most significant bits of a 64 bit Network Time Protocol (NTP) time value).
If a UE is not time synchronized with the mobile network, then the UE must
calculate an expiration time, which is relative to the reception of the FLUTE
FDT packet.
#### 7.2.1.4 File Repair procedure
The file correction use case is based on the file reception use-case described
in clause 7.2.1.3.
The post delivery file repair procedure (i.e. one possible associated delivery
procedure) is configured with a back-off window of 40 seconds. It was assumed,
that a group of 5 000 UEs would need 10 kByte each of repair data, assuming
that the file repair server can provide repair data with a capacity of 10
Mbps.
\
\
\
\http://mbmsrepair.operator.umts/path/repair-service\
\http://mbmsrepair2.operator.umts/path/repair-
service\
\http://mbmsrepair3.operator.umts/path/repair-
service\
\
\
The following table is created assuming the recommended MBMS FEC parameter
configurations.
* * *
File-Size 300 kbyte FEC Overhead 16% Z (Number of Source Blocks) 1 N (Number
of sub-blocks) 2 A (Alignment factor) 4 P (Payload size) 512 byte G (Symbols
per packet) 2 T (Symbol Size) 256 byte
Generated Source Packets 600 Generated Repair Packets 96
* * *
**UE_A:**
It is assumed that UE_A switched from a very good coverage to almost no
coverage 20 seconds before the transmission ended. It is assumed for UE_A,
that a user enters a subterranean garage or a sub-way station while receiving
an MBMS download transmission session.
The UE_A misses the last half of the MBMS transmission, thus packet 348 until
packet 696 are lost. The file transmission was organized such that the repair
packets are transmitted after the source packets. Thus, a part of the source
and all repair packets are lost. Since there are two symbols per packet, the
corresponding start ESI of the lost packets is 696.
After the FDT instance has expired (thus 46 seconds after receiving the FLUTE
FDT packet), the UE_A starts the file repair procedure with calculating the
procedure back-off time.
Backoff-time = rnd() Ã— 40 s + 5 s
The UE_A selects randomly one server URI from the Associated delivery
procedure. In this use-case the UE chooses the second server URI:
http://mbmsrepair2.operator.umts.
For this use-case the rnd() function has returned \"0.275\" as result. Thus,
the UE defers the opening of the TCP connection to the host
mbmsrepair2.operator.umts by 16 seconds. As soon as the TCP connection is
established, the UE sends the following HTTP GET request to the file repair
server.
The File Repair request line:
GET http://mbmsrepair2.operator.umts/path/repair-
service?fileURI=www.example.com/bundesliga/VideoClip-10.3gp&SBN=1;ESI=696-1198
HTTP/1.1
Since the MBMS UE has successfully received the first part of the source
block, it needs to request only the remaining part of the source block to
completely recover the file. The MBMS FEC decoder need not be invoked in this
example.
The UE_A gets the remaining parts of the file as response.
**UE_B:**
UE_B switched from a very good coverage to almost no coverage 20 seconds
before the transmission ended and re-entered good coverage 15 seconds later.
The UE_B thus misses packets 348 to packet 607 (inclusive). The file
transmission was organized such that the repair packets are transmitted after
the source packets. Thus, a part of the source is lost (i.e. 251 source
packets), but most repair packets have been received (i.e. 88). The total
number of received packets is 435 and since there are two symbols per packet,
then 870 symbols have been received.
After the FDT instance has expired (thus 46 seconds after receiving the FLUTE
FDT packet), the UE_A starts the file repair procedure with calculating the
procedure back-off time.
Backoff-time = rnd() Ã— 40 s + 5 s
The UE_B selects randomly one server URI from the Associated delivery
procedure. In this use-case the UE chooses the second server URI:
http://mbmsrepair2.operator.umts
For this use-case the rnd() function has returned \"0.275\" as result. Thus,
the UE defers the opening of the TCP connection to the host
mbmsrepair2.operator.umts by 16 seconds. As soon as the TCP connection is
established, the UE sends the following HTTP GET request to the file repair
server.
A minimum of 330 additional symbols are required to ensure successful decoding
of the file. The UE should use one of the algorithms defined in clause 6.1.3
to determine a range of ESIs that will result in successful reception. In this
case, the UE determines that an additional 12 symbols (1 %) will be sufficient
to ensure recovery. The UE thus requests an additional 342 symbols with ESIs
of 1 392 (one greater than the highest ESI received) or above.
The File Repair request line:
GET http:// mbmsrepair2.operator.umts/path/repair-
service?fileURI=www.example.com/bundesliga/VideoClip-10.3gp&SBN=1;ESI=1392+342
HTTP/1.1
UE_B receives the repair symbols in response and can thus decode the file.
Note that the UE is not permitted to request all missing source symbols, since
this would result in an unnecessary load on the repair server (in this case
504 symbols).
### 7.2.2 The usage of the MBMS session Identity in file download delivery
#### 7.2.2.1 Introduction
The MBMS Identity field can be used by the BM-SC and terminal to establish an
n-to-m mapping between the files of a file download sessions and their
corresponding MBMS bearer sessions over which the files are transported.
According to 3GPP TS 23.246 [4], the UEs are notified about the starting (or
ongoing) data transmission through MBMS notification procedure (see the
example of GERAN in figure 11). Both the TMGI and an optional Session ID are
paged to the terminals, independent of their current state (idle or
connected), to inform them about the starting data transmission. The UEs use
the TMGI and the Session ID to decide whether they are interested in the MBMS
session or not. In case of session repetitions, the BM-SC assigns the same
TMGI and Session ID to the MBMS session. This allows the UEs to recognize that
the session is repeated and decide not to receive the data in case they
already received it correctly.
The usage of the Session ID field is optional. Both UE and BM-SC may decide to
ignore the Session ID field. The UE will then assume that the MBMS session is
a new session and make its decision independently. The BM-SC may decide not to
use the Session ID field, in which case it will not signal it to the UEs
within the FDT nor during the notification.
{width="4.095833333333333in" height="3.8645833333333335in"}
Figure 11: Notification process in the GERAN
The BM-SC uses the FDT of a file download session to indicate for a file or a
file group the Session ID value of the MBMS session to carry the file(s). The
UE establishes a table to save the mappings between the Session IDs and the
files. Each record has a validity time, which is signalled by the \"MBMS-
Session-Identity-Expiry\" in the FDT-Instance. This expiry time applies to all
MBMS Session Identity values declared in the same FDT Instance.
In the following we give some examples of the usage of the MBMS Session
Identity.
#### 7.2.2.2 Example 1: Usage of the Session ID to detect repetition
Figure 12 depicts the scenario where the terminal receives a notification
about a pending MBMS bearer session with session ID value 5\. The UE is not
aware of the content of the new bearer session, so that it assumes that it is
interested in that session. Hence, the UE replies to the notification message
to declare to the network that it will receive the data over that MBMS bearer
session (which is identified by the TMGI and the Session ID).
Later on, during the download delivery session, the BM-SC decides to
retransmit the same files and then uses the same Session ID. In the FDT of the
repeated transmission, the same files are declared to belong to the same
bearer session. The UE is notified about the new session using the paging
information. The UE detects that it has already seen and received the files of
that MBMS bearer session correctly. Hence, it decides not to reply to the
paging messages and will not receive the corresponding data.
Figure 12: **Example** of the usage of the Session ID
#### 7.2.2.3 Example 2: Declaration of files of a different MBMS bearer
session in the FDT
Figure 13 depicts the scenario where the BM-SC sends an FDT Instance that
declares files, which are sent over a different MBMS bearer session. Although
file #2 itself is not sent over MBMS bearer session #3, it is declared in the
FDT Instance. The UE will detect this and will know the content (or a subset
of it) of a forthcoming MBMS bearer session with the Session ID 5.
Figure 13: Example of an FDT that declares files of a different FDT
#### 7.2.2.4 Example 3: Declaration of files of an MBMS bearer session in
several FDT Instances
Figure 14, the example of splitting the declaration of files carried over a
given MBMS bearer service is split over several FDT Instances. It also shows
that if one of the FDT Instances and the corresponding files are lost, the UE
will not be aware about the full content of the MBMS bearer session. This may
lead to a wrong behaviour of the UE, in that it may decided not to receive
session repetitions, assuming that it correctly received all files.
It is hence recommended that a single FDT Instance is used to declare all
files to be carried over the MBMS bearer session.
Figure 14: Example of several FDT Instances declaring files for a given MBMS
bearer session
## 7.3 MBMS streaming delivery method
The MBMS Streaming receiver application may be started upon user interaction.
In the case of immediate play-out upon reception, the user would be fully
aware of the MBMS Streaming reception. The MBMS Streaming User Service is
likely a fully integrated application (such as PSS).
The \"MBMS User Service Transmitters\" sends in case of the MBMS Streaming
User service a number of continuous RTP-streams via the MBMS Bearer Service to
the \"MBMS User Service Receivers\". The number of streams per MBMS User
Service depends on the multimedia components of the Service.
Output of the MBMS User Service Receiver is in case of the MBMS Streaming User
Service a number of continuous media streams (e.g. audio and video stream).
The required codecs for reception of MBMS Streaming User Service are provided
during the MBMS Service Discovery phase.
The \"MBMS User Service Transmitter\" starts and stops sending the RTP-streams
according to the \"Transmission Controller\". Users do not have a direct
influence on the transmission duration or on the quality of the transmitted
media.
# 8 Codecs and formats
The H.264 (AVC) decoder in an MBMS client should infer missing macroblocks in
a coded picture. When gaps_in_frame_num_value_allowed_flag is equal to 0 in
the active sequence parameter set and the value of frame_num syntax element in
the current picture is invalid according to clause 7.4.3 of ITU-T
Recommendation H.264 [17], the H.264 (AVC) decoder in an MBMS client should
infer an unintentional reference picture loss. When
gaps_in_frame_num_value_allowed_flag is equal to 1 in the active sequence
parameter set and any value of frame_num pertaining to \"non-existing\"
pictures is referred to in the inter prediction process, is referred to in the
reordering commands for reference picture lists for short-term pictures
(clause 8.2.4.3.1 of ITU-T Recommendation H.264 [17]), or is referred to in
the assignment process of a LongTermFrameIdx to a short-term picture (clause
8.2.5.4.3 of ITU-T Recommendation H.264 [17]), the H.264 (AVC) decoder in an
MBMS client should infer an unintentional reference picture loss. The H.264
(AVC) decoder in an MBMS client should infer a syntax violation, when decoding
causes any syntax or semantics violation other than specified above.
When the H.264 (AVC) decoder in an MBMS client infers missing macroblocks in a
non-reference picture, it should continue decoding no later than from the next
access unit in decoding order. When the H.264 (AVC) decoder in an MBMS client
infers an unintentional reference picture loss or missing macroblocks in a
reference picture, it may or may not continue decoding \"immediately\", i.e.
from the NAL unit in which the loss is inferred. If the H.264 (AVC) decoder in
an MBMS client continues decoding \"immediately\", it should be aware that
such a stream may contain references to macroblocks or pictures that are not
available in the decoded picture buffer. The H.264 (AVC) decoder in an MBMS
client should continue decoding after an unintentional reference picture loss,
missing macroblocks in a reference picture or a syntax violation no later than
it receives the next IDR access unit or the next recovery point SEI message,
whichever is earlier in decoding order.
NOTE: When the H.264 (AVC) decoder in an MBMS client continues decoding
\"immediately\" after an inferred reference picture loss or missing
macroblocks in a reference picture, it does not have to parse recovery point
SEI messages to comply with the paragraph above.
**Encoding and Packetization Recommendations**
The following recommendations are given to MBMS encoders and packetizers to
optimize the tradeoff between loss rates and throughput for MBMS video
services:
  * The encoder/packetizer **should** choose a suitable IP packet size > for the loss regime and other network characteristics.
  * When H.264/AVC is in use and FEC is in use, the encoder **may** > produce NAL units larger than the suitable IP/RTP packet size.
  * When H.264/AVC is in use and in any case when larger NAL units are > produced by the encoder, the packetizer **should** use NAL Unit > fragmentation as specified in RFC 3984 [18], section 5.8, to > adapt the RTP packet size to the network, and not produce large > RTP packets (which would imply either IP fragmentation or IP > packets which use several transmission units, both of which are > undesirable).
NOTE: When H.263 is in use, follow-on packets **should** be used for similar
purposes as fragmentation units.
###### ### Annex A: MBMS Forward Error Correction performance
This annex provides details of the performance of the MBMS Forward Error
Correction code which can be used in dimensioning MBMS services.
# A.1 Theoretical performance
The theoretical performance of the MBMS FEC code depends on the amount of data
received by the terminal. If less data has been received than the size of the
file or block to which FEC protection has been applied then recovery of the
original data is obviously impossible. If an amount of data has been received
which is not less than the size of the file or block then recovery may be
possible.
As a general rule, if at least one source packet has been lost and if an
amount of data has been received which is 1 % greater than the source size,
then the probability of recovery is around 99.9 % or greater. If an amount of
data has been received which is 2 % greater than the source size then the
probability of recovery is 99.9999 % or greater.
In practice, the recovery probabilities are often higher than these figures,
in particular when the number of FEC encoding symbols in the block is large.
# A.2 Simulation results
This clause provides results of simulations which were carried out during the
development of 3GPP TS 26.346 [5]. These results may be used as guidelines for
the provisioning of MBMS services. In general, provisioning should be based on
first determining the available resources for the MBMS service and the
coverage required. The service should then be dimensioned to provide
acceptable quality of service at the edge of the coverage area.
It should be noted that as discussed in clause 6.1.4, the IP packet loss rate
may be quite sensitive to the chosen SDU size. Therefore care should be taken
when using the figures presented here with SDU sizes, or other configuration
parameters, which differ significantly from those used for the simulations.
