# 1 Scope
The present document describes the UTRAN functions by means of signalling
procedure examples (Message Sequence Charts). The signalling procedure
examples show the interaction between the UE, the different UTRAN nodes and
the CN to perform system functions. This gives an overall understanding of how
the UTRAN works in example scenarios.

## 3.3 Notation for the signalling procedures
Complex signalling procedures may involve several protocols in different
nodes.
In order to facilitate the understanding of these procedures, the following
rules in the drawing of Message Sequence Chart (MSC) are applied:
− Messages are always exchanged between nodes, i.e. the sender and the
receiver of a message are nodes and not single protocol entities;
− The protocol entity inside a node that is sending/receiving a message is
represented by means of an ellipse, containing the protocol entity name;
− Each message is numbered, so that a numbered list with explanations can be
added below the figure;
− Message parameters may be specified as shown in Figure 1 only when required
for a clear understanding of the procedures;
− Explicit signalling is represented by means of continuous arrows;
− Inband signalling is represented by means of dotted arrows;
− A description of the relevant actions may be included as shown in Figure 1;
− The Setup and Release of Iub/Iur and Iu Data Transport Bearer with the ALCAP
protocol is represented as shown in Figure 1;
− The transport channel used by the MAC protocol or the logical channel used
by the RLC and RRC protocols may be indicated before the message name as shown
in figure 1

## 4.6 ALCAP
ALCAP is a generic name to indicate the protocol(s) used to establish data
transport bearers on the Iu, Iur and Iub interfaces. ITU-T Rec. Q.2630.2
(Q.AAL2) [17] is one of the selected protocols to be used as ALCAP. Q.2630.2
adds new optional capabilities to ITU-T Rec. Q.2630.1 [18].
The following should be noted:
• data transport bearers may be dynamically established using ALCAP or
preconfigured;
• transport bearers may be established before or after allocation of radio
resources.
### 4.6.1 Q.2630.2 (Q.AAL2)
The following figure is showing an example of use of Q.2630.2 in the UTRAN
context, for the different interfaces.

# 5 UTRAN Signalling Procedures
The signalling procedures shown in the following sections do not represent the
complete set of possibilities, nor do they mandate this kind of operation. The
standard will specify a set of elementary procedures for each interface, which
may be combined in different ways in an implementation. Therefore these
sequences are merely examples of a typical implementation.
The list of parameters is not be complete, but should only be seen as help for
the understanding of the examples.
# 6 Procedures not related to a specific UE (global procedures)
This clause presents some signalling procedures not related to a specific UE.
## 6.1 System Information Broadcasting
This example shows an example of System Information broadcasting.
Figure 3: System Information Broadcasting
1\. The RNC forwards the request to the pertinent node(s) B for via NBAP
message **System** **Information Update Request**.\ Parameters: Master/Segment
Information Block(s) (System information to be broadcasted), BCCH modification
time.
2\. The Node B confirms the ability to broadcast the information sending
**System** **Information Update Response** message to the RNC via NBAP. (If
the Node B can not Broadcast the information as requested, System Information
Update Failure is return to the RNC).
3./4./5. The information is broadcasted on the air interface by RRC message
**System Information**.\ Parameters: Master/Segment Information Block(s)
(System information).
## 6.2 Service Area Broadcast
This example shows an example of broadcasting of Cell Information. UTRAN
transports this broadcast information transparently.
Figure 4: Service Area Broadcast
1\. The CN asks the RNC for an information Broadcast via SABP message **Write-
replace**.\ Parameters: Broadcast-Message-Content, Service-Area-List.
2\. The RNC confirm the ability to broadcast the information sending **Write-
Replace Complete** message to the CN via SABP. (If the RNC can not Broadcast
the information as requested, Write-replace Failure message is return to the
CN).
3./4./5. The information is broadcasted on the air interface by BMC message
**CBS Message**. carried over CTCH channel.\ Parameters: Message ID, CB Data.
Note that the Node B is transparent to this messaging because (as mentioned in
TS 25.324 [10], TR 25.925 [11] and TS 23.041 [12]) the BMC protocol is
terminated in RNC (see also TS 25.301 [7]).
# 7 Procedures related to a specific UE
This clause presents a number of signalling procedures related to a specific
UE.
## 7.1 Paging
This subclause presents two examples of Paging procedures for both the cases
of a UE in RRC Idle Mode and RRC Connected Mode.
### 7.1.1 Paging for a UE in RRC Idle Mode and RRC connected mode (CELL_PCH
and URA_PCH states)
This example shows how paging is performed for a UE in RRC Idle Mode. The UE
may be paged for a CS or PS service. Since the UE is in RRC Idle Mode, the
location is only known at CN level and therefore paging is distributed over a
defined geographical area (e.g. LA).
NOTE: Example below illustrates scenario where LA spans across 2 RNCs.
Figure 5: Paging for a UE in RRC Idle Mode
1\. CN initiates the paging of a UE over a LA spanning two RNCs (i.e. RNC1 and
RNC2) via RANAP message **Paging**.\ Parameters: CN Domain Indicator,
Permanent NAS UE Identity, Temporary UE Identity, Paging Cause.
2\. Paging of UE performed by cell1 using **Paging Type 1** message.
3\. Paging of UE performed by cell2 using **Paging Type 1** message.
The UE detects page message from RNC1 (as example) and the procedure for NAS
signalling connection establishment follows. NAS message transfer can now be
performed.
This procedure described for RRC idle mode, applies also to the RRC connected
mode in the case of CELL_PCH and URA_PCH states.
### 7.1.2 Paging for a UE in RRC Connected Mode (CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH
states)
This can occur in case of two core network domains, with the mobility
management independent of each other. Two possible solutions exists:
• The UTRAN coordinates the paging request with the existing RRC connection.
• The UE coordinates the paging request with the existing RRC connection.
The following example shows how paging is performed for a UE in RRC Connected
Mode (CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH states) when the UTRAN coordinates the paging
request with the existing RRC connection using DCCH.
Figure 6: Paging for a UE in RRC Connected Mode (CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH
states)
1\. CN initiates the paging of a UE via RANAP message **Paging**.\ Parameters:
CN Domain Indicator, Permanent NAS UE Identity, Temporary UE Identity, Paging
Cause.
2\. SRNC sends RRC message **Paging Type 2**.
## 7.2 NAS Signalling Connection Establishment
This example shows establishment of a NAS Signalling Connection.
This establishment could be request by the terminal by itself (for example to
initiate a service) or could be stimulated by a paging from the CN.
Figure 7: NAS Signalling Connection Establishment
1\. RRC Connection is established (see 7.3.1 or 7.3.2).
2\. UE sends RRC **Initial Direct Transfer** to SRNC.\ Parameters: Initial NAS
Message (could for a GSM based CN be e.g. CM Service Request, Location Update
Request etc.) CN node indicator (it indicates the correct CN node into which
the NAS message shall be forwarded).
3\. SRNC initiates signalling connection to CN, and sends the RANAP message
**Initial UE Message**.\ Parameters: NAS PDU (could for a GSM based CN be e.g.
CM Service Request, Location Update Request etc.), CN domain indicator
(indicating the CN domain towards which this message is sent).
The NAS signalling connection between UE and CN can now be used for NAS
message transfer.
## 7.3 RRC Connection Establishment

dedicated transport channel (DCH) state or in common transport channel
(RACH/FACH) state.

(RACH/FACH). The procedure starts from a radio access bearer assignment
because does not exist a special message to modify a radio access bearer,
instead an "assignment" message is used.
### 7.8.1 DCCH on DCH - Synchronised
This example shows modification of a radio access bearer established on a
dedicated channel (DCH) with UE in macrodiversity between two RNCs. A NSAP
synchronised procedure is used and a successful case is shown. For an
unsuccessful case it's important to note that a failure message can be sent in
any point of the Message Sequence Chart (MSC); in particular could be in RRC
reconfiguration response.
A radio access bearer modification procedure (via radio access bearer
assignment message) is shown with mapping to Radio Bearer reconfiguration.
Note that this is not possible if the used transport channel or logical
channel is changed because the Radio Bearer reconfiguration does not permit a
change in type of channel (see TS 25.331 [8]).

### 7.8.2 DCCH on RACH/FACH
This example shows reconfiguration of a radio access bearer using a common

Radio Access Bearer Assignment Request.

3\. RNC starts an Iu Data Transport Bearer Modification between the CN and the
RNC using the ALCAP protocol with AAL2 bindings carried by radio access bearer
assignment message (this step is not required towards PS domain). This has to
be done before Radio Reconfiguration itself because the transport channel must
be ready when the radio channel will be ready.

channel you use, because Radio Bearer reconfiguration does not permit a change
in type of channel (see TS 25.331 [8]).

• Radio link Deletion (Branch Deletion);
• Radio link Addition & Deletion (Branch Addition & Deletion -
simultaneously).
Soft Handover applies only to FDD mode.
### 7.10.1 Radio Link Addition (Branch Addition)
This example shows establishment of a radio link via a Node B controlled by
another RNC than the serving RNC. This is the first radio link to be
established via this RNS, thus macro-diversity combining/splitting with
already existing radio links within DRNS is not possible.
Figure 24: Soft Handover - Radio Link Addition (Branch Addition)
1\. SRNC decides to setup a radio link via a new cell controlled by another
RNC. SRNC requests DRNC for radio resources by sending RNSAP message **Radio
Link Setup Request**. If this is the first radio link via the DRNC for this
UE, a new Iur signalling connection is established. This Iur signalling
connection will be used for all RNSAP signalling related to this UE.\
Parameters: Cell id, Transport Format Set per DCH, Transport Format
Combination Set, frequency, UL scrambling code.
2\. If requested resources are available, DRNC sends NBAP message **Radio Link
Setup Request** to Node B.\ Parameters: Cell id, Transport Format Set per DCH,
Transport Format Combination Set, frequency, UL scrambling code.\ Then Node B
starts the UL reception.
3\. Node B allocates requested resources. Successful outcome is reported in
NBAP message **Radio Link Setup Response**.\ Parameters: Signalling link
termination, Transport layer addressing information (AAL2 address, AAL2
Binding Identitie(s)) for Data Transport Bearer(s).
4\. DRNC sends RNSAP message **Radio Link Setup Response** to SRNC.\
Parameters: Transport layer addressing information (AAL2 address, AAL2 Binding
Identity) for Data Transport Bearer(s), Neighbouring cell information.
5\. SRNC initiates setup of Iur/Iub Data Transport Bearer using ALCAP
protocol. This request contains the AAL2 Binding Identity to bind the Iub Data
Transport Bearer to DCH.\ This may be repeated for each Iur/Iub Data Transport
Bearer to be setup.
6./7. Node B achieves uplink sync on the Uu and notifies DRNC with NBAP
message **Radio Link Restore Indication**. In its turn DRNC notifies SRNC with
RNSAP message **Radio Link Restore Indication.**
8./9. Node B and SRNC establish synchronism for the Data Transport Bearer(s)
by means of exchange of the appropriate DCH Frame Protocol frames **Downlink
Synchronisation** and **Uplink Synchronisation** , relative already existing
radio link(s). Then Node B starts DL transmission.
10\. SRNC sends RRC message **Active Set Update** (Radio Link Addition) to UE
on DCCH.\ Parameters: Update type, Cell id, DL scrambling code, Power control
information, Ncell information.
11\. UE acknowledges with RRC message **Active Set Update Complete**.
NOTE: The order of transmission of **Radio Link Restore Indication** messages
(steps 6 and 7) is not necessarily identical to that shown in the example.
These messages could be sent before the ALCAP bearer setup (step 5) or after
the transport bearer synchronisation (steps 8 and 9).
### 7.10.2 Radio link Deletion (Branch Deletion)
This example shows deletion of a radio link belonging to a Node B controlled
by another RNC than the serving RNC.
Figure 25: Soft Handover - Radio Link Deletion (Branch Deletion)
1\. SRNC decides to remove a radio link via an old cell controlled by another
RNC. SRNC sends RRC message **Active Set Update** (Radio Link Deletion) to UE
on DCCH.\ Parameters: Update type, Cell id.
2\. UE deactivates DL reception via old branch, and acknowledges with RRC
message **Active Set Update** **Complete**.
3\. SRNC requests DRNC to deallocate radio resources by sending RNSAP message
**Radio Link Deletion Request**.\ Parameters: Cell id, Transport layer
addressing information.
4\. DRNC sends NBAP message **Radio Link Deletion Request** to Node B.\
Parameters: Cell id, Transport layer addressing information.
5\. Node B deallocates radio resources. Successful outcome is reported in NBAP
message **Radio Link Deletion Response**.
6\. DRNC sends RNSAP message **Radio Link Deletion Response** to SRNC.
7\. SRNC initiates release of Iur/Iub Data Transport Bearer using ALCAP
protocol.
### 7.10.3 Radio link Addition & Deletion (Branch Addition & Deletion -
simultaneously)
This example shows simultaneous deletion of a radio link belonging to a Node B
controlled by the serving RNC and the establishment of a radio link via a Node
B controlled by another RNC than the serving RNC. This is the first radio link
to be established via this RNS, thus macro-diversity combining/splitting with
already existing radio links within DRNS is not possible.
This procedure is needed when the maximum number of branches allowed for the
macrodiversity set has already been reached.
Figure 26: Soft Handover - Radio link Addition & Deletion (Branch Addition &
Deletion - simultaneously)
1\. ⇒ 9. See description 1. ⇒ 9. in subclause 7.10.1.
10\. SRNC sends RRC message **Active Set Update** (Radio Link Addition &
Deletion) to UE on DCCH.\ Parameters: Update type, Cell id, DL scrambling

in which the UE is connected to two CN nodes simultaneously node and will be
using one node B directly under the target RNC after the hard handover.
Figure 29: Hard Handover with switching in the CN using SRNS Relocation (UE
connected to two CN nodes, DCH state)
Serving RNC makes the decision to perform the Hard Handover via CN. Serving
RNC also decides into which RNC (Target RNC) the Serving RNC functionality is
to be relocated.
1./2. SRNC sends **Relocation Required** messages to both CN nodes.
Parameters: target RNC identifier, Information field transparent to the CN
node and to be transmitted to the target RNC.\ Upon reception of **Relocation
Required** message CN element prepares itself for the switch and may also

Request** message to the target RNC to allocate resources.
Parameters: bearer ID\'s requested to be rerouted towards the CN node, from
which the **Relocation Request** originated.\ CN indicates in the message
whether it prefers point to multipoint type of connections within CN or hard

links to be used after completion of the Hard Handover procedure.
5\. Target RNC and CN node establish the new Iu transport bearers for each
Radio Access Bearer related to the CN node.

Request** to the target Node-B.\ Parameters: Cell id, Transport Format Set,
Transport Format Combination Set, frequency, UL scrambling code [FDD], Time
Slots [TDD], User Codes [TDD], Power control information etc.

correct Iu transport bearer. DL data arriving from the new Iu link is routed
to newly established RLC entities, to the MAC and to the MD-splitter and Nodes
B

communication link between the CN and UE is all the time existing and working
and the procedure execution can be stopped and original configuration easily
restored. If any such unexceptional thing occurs a **Relocation Failure**
message may be sent instead of any message numbered 3-10 and 13-15 described

### 7.11.2 Forward Hard Handover
This subclauses shows some examples of hard handover in the case of mobile
initiated forward handovers.
Some examples of Cell Update procedures are shown, i.e. those procedures that
update the position of the UE when a RRC connection exists and the position of
the UE is known on cell level in the UTRAN. The UE is in CELL_PCH or
CELL_FACH.
#### 7.11.2.1 Cell Update
##### 7.11.2.1.1 Using Cell Update with SRNS relocation
This example shows Inter-RNS Cell Update with switching in the CN (therefore
with SRNS relocation) and RNTI reallocation.
Figure 30: Cell Update with SRNS Relocation
1\. UE sends a RRC message Cell Update to the UTRAN, after having made cell
re-selection. Upon reception of a CCCH message from a UE, target RNC allocates
a C-RNTI for the UE.
2\. Controlling target RNC forward the received message (on CCCH) via **Uplink
Signalling Transfer Indication** RNSAP message towards the SRNC. Message
includes, besides target RNC-ID, also the allocated C-RNTI, which is to be
used as UE identification within the C-RNC, and the D-RNTI. Upon reception of
the RNSAP message SRNC decides to perform SRNS Relocation towards the target
RNC.
3\. Serving RNC relocation procedure is executed as defined in subclause 'SRNS
Relocation Relocation (UE connected to a single CN node)'. After completing
SRNS Relocation, target RNC allocates new S-RNTI for the UE, becoming the new
serving RNC.
4\. Target RNC responds to UE by RRC **Cell Update Confirm** , including old
S-RNTI and SRNC ID as UE identifiers. Message contains also the new S-RNTI,
SRNC-ID and C-RNTI.
5\. UE acknowledges the RNTI reallocation by sending the RRC message **UTRAN
Mobility Information Confirm**.
##### 7.11.2.1.2 Using Enhanced SRNS Relocation
This example shows Inter-RNS Cell Update with switching in the CN (therefore
with SRNS relocation) and RNTI reallocation.
Figure xy: Cell Update with Enhanced SRNS Relocation
1\. UE sends a RRC message Cell Update to the UTRAN, after having made cell
re-selection. Upon reception of a CCCH message from a UE, target RNC allocates
a C-RNTI for the UE.
2\. Controlling target RNC forward the received message (on CCCH) via **Uplink
Signalling Transfer Indication** RNSAP message towards the SRNC. Message
includes, besides target RNC-ID, also the allocated C-RNTI, which is to be
used as UE identification within the C-RNC, and the D-RNTI. Upon reception of
the RNSAP message SRNC decides to perform Enhanced Relocation towards the
target RNC.
3\. Serving RNC Enhanced Relocation procedure is executed as defined in
subclause 'SRNS Enhanced Relocation (UE connected to a single CN node)'. After
completing SRNS Enhanced Relocation, target RNC allocates new S-RNTI for the
UE, becoming the new serving RNC.
#### 7.11.2.2 Cell Update via Iur without SRNS relocation
This example shows an Inter RNS cell update in DRNS without SRNS relocation
when no Iur RACH/FACH transport bearer exists. In this example target DRNS,
source DRNS and serving RNS are all located separately from each other. Other
scenarios can be easily derived from this most comprehensive signalling
procedure.
Figure 31: Cell Update via Iur without SRNS Relocation
1\. UE sends an RRC message Cell Update to the UTRAN (Target DRNC), after
having made cell re-selection.
2\. Upon reception of a CCCH message from a UE, the target DRNC decodes the
SRNC-ID and the S-RNTI. The UE is not registered in the target DRNC, thus the
target DRNC allocates C-RNTI and D-RNTI for the UE. The target DRNC forwards
the received uplink CCCH message towards the SRNC in the RNSAP **Uplink
Signalling Transfer** **Indication** message. The Uplink Signalling Transfer
message includes also the cell-ID of the cell from which the CCCH message was
received, the D-RNC ID and the allocated C-RNTI and D-RNTI.
3\. Upon reception of the Uplink Signalling Transfer message the SRNC decides
not to perform an SRNS Relocation towards the target RNC. The SRNC initialises
the UE context in the target RNC with the **RNSAP Common Transport Channel
Resources Initialisation Request** message. The message includes the D-RNTI
and the cell identity previously received in the Uplink Signalling Transfer
indication message, as well as a request for transport layer address and
binding identity if there exists no appropriate Iur transport bearer to be
used for the UE.
4\. The target DRNC sends the transport layer address, binding identity and
optionally PHY parameters (FACH code, ) to the SRNC with the RNSAP **Common
Transport Channel Resources Initialisation Response** message
5\. If there does not already exist an appropriate Iur transport bearer to be
used for the UE, a transport bearer is established from the SRNC.
6\. The SRNC sends RRC **Cell Update Confirm** to the UE. The message is sent
in the Iur user plane. It will be sent by the target DRNC to the UE on the
FACH coupled to the RACH. Subsequent FACH data may be sent on a different FACH
if so decided by the target DRNC.
7\. UE acknowledges the RNTI reallocation by sending the RRC message **UTRAN
Mobility Information Confirm**.
8\. The SRNC releases the UE context in the source DRNC by sending a **Common
Transport Channel Resources Release** message. The source DRNC releases the
D-RNTI.
#### 7.11.2.3 Cell Update via Iur without SRNS relocation (with C-RNTI
reallocation)
This example is similar to the previous one (7.11.2.2) with minor changes. It
shows a cell update in DRNS without SRNS relocation when an Iur RACH/FACH
transport bearer exists and the UE is already known in the DRNS. The DRNC
decides to allocate a new C-RNTI for the UE but not a new D-RNTI because D-RNC
does not change. Therefore the two columns DRNC of picture 31 merge themselves
to represent this case.
#### 7.11.2.4 Cell Update via Iur with USCH/DSCH, without SRNS relocation
[TDD]
This example shows an inter-RNS cell update without SRNS relocation, when the
UE is in Cell_FACH state and has been allocated DSCH and USCH before the Cell
Update and when no Iur RACH/FACH transport bearer exists. In this example
target RNS, source RNS and serving RNS are all located separately from each
other. The procedure includes an implicit release of the USCH and DSCH, which
includes release of the Radio Link in the old cell. A potential restoration of
USCH and DSCH after the cell update, triggered by the SRNC, is not shown.
NOTE 1: These messages are not necessary if the Target RNC and the SRNC are
identical.
NOTE 2: These messages are not necessary if the Source RNC and the SRNC are
identical.
Figure 32: Backward Cell Update via Iur (Cell_FACH State with USCH/DSCH) --
successful case.
1\. When the UE decides that a cell update is necessary, it sends an RRC
message **Cell Update** to the Target RNC. This is a _CCCH_ message carried on
the _RACH_ in the new cell. Upon reception of a CCCH message from a UE, the
target DRNC decodes the SRNC ID and the S-RNTI. Supposing that the UE is not
registered in the target DRNC (RNC ID and SRNTI unknown), the target DRNC
allocates a C-RNTI and a D-RNTI for the UE.
2\. The Target RNC forwards the **Cell Update** to the SRNC via an RNSAP
**Uplink Signaling Transfer** message (see note 1). The Uplink Signalling
Transfer message includes also the cell-ID of the cell from which the CCCH
message was received, the D-RNTI and the allocated C-RNTI. Upon reception of
the Uplink Signalling Transfer message the SRNC decides not to perform a SRNS
Relocation towards the target RNC.
3\. The SRNC initialises the UE context in the target RNC with the **RNSAP
Common Transport Channel Resource Request** message. The message includes the
D-RNTI and the cell identity previously received in the Uplink Signalling
Transfer indication message, as well as a request for transport layer address
and binding identity if there exists no appropriate Iur transport bearer to be
used for the UE (see note 1)
4\. The Target RNC responds with an RNSAP message **Common Transport Channel
Resources Response** including the transport layer address, binding identity
and optionally PHY parameters (FACH code, ..) (see note 1).
5\. If there does not already exist an appropriate Iur transport bearer to be
used for the UE, a transport bearer is established from the SRNC (see note 1).
6\. The SRNC sends an RRC message **Cell Update** **Confirm** within the
_DCCH_ on _FACH_ to the UE. The message is sent in the Iur user plane. It will
be sent by the target DRNC to the UE on the FACH coupled to the RACH.
Subsequent FACH data may be sent on a different FACH if so decided by the
target DRNC.
7\. UE acknowledges the RNTI reallocation by sending the RRC message **UTRAN
Mobility Information Confirm**.
8\. The SRNC releases the UE context in the source DRNC by sending a **Common
Transport Channel Resource Release** message. The source DRNC releases the
D-RNTI (_see note 2)._
9\. The SRNC sends an RNSAP message **Radio Link Deletion** to the source RNC
(see note 2)_._
10\. The source RNC sends NBAP message **Radio Link Deletion** to the source
Node B.\ Parameters: Cell id, Transport layer addressing information.
11\. The source Node B deletes the previous Radio link and the Communication
Context. Successful outcome is reported in NBAP message **Radio Link Deletion
Response**.
12\. The source RNC initiates release of the corresponding Iub Data Transport
bearers using ALCAP protocol.
13\. When the source RNC has completed the release, the RNSAP message **Radio
Link Deletion Response** is sent to the SRNC (see note 2)_._
14\. SRNC initiates release of Iur Data Transport bearer using ALCAP protocol.
The request for release of Iur Data Transport bearer is acknowledged by the
Source RNC _(see note 2)._
## 7.12 URA Update
This subclause presents some examples of URA Update procedures, i.e. those
procedures that update the UTRAN registration area of a UE when a RRC
connection exists and the position of the UE is known on URA level in the
UTRAN.
### 7.12.1 Inter-RNS URA Update
#### 7.12.1.1 Inter-RNS URA Update using SRNS Relocation
This example shows Inter-RNS URA Update with switching in the CN (SRNS
relocation).
Figure 33: Inter RNS URA Update with switching in CN using SRNS Relocation.
1\. UE sends a RRC message URA Update to the UTRAN, after having made cell re-
selection. Upon reception of a CCCH message from an unknown UE, the target RNC
becomes a controlling RNC and it allocates a new C-RNTI and a new D-RNTI for
the UE.
2\. The target RNC forwards the received uplink CCCH message towards the SRNC
by RNSAP **Uplink Signalling Transfer Indication** message to the old
Source/Controller RNC. Message includes, besides target RNC-ID, also the
allocated C-RNTI, which is to be used as UE identification within the C-RNC,
and the D-RNTI. Upon reception of the RNSAP message SRNC decides to perform
SRNS Relocation towards the target RNC.
3\. Serving RNC relocation procedure is executed as defined in subclause
\'SRNS Relocation (UE connected to a single CN node)\'. After having completed
SRNS Relocation, target RNC allocates new S-RNTI for the UE becoming the new
serving RNC. New SRNC also deletes the allocated C-RNTI, since it is not
needed for an UE in URA_PCH state.
4\. Serving RNC acknowledges the message by RRC **URA Update Confirm** ,
including old S-RNTI and SRNC ID as UE identifiers. Message contains also the
new S-RNTI and RNC-ID.
5\. UE acknowledges the RNTI reallocation by sending the RRC message **UTRAN
Mobility Information Confirm** on DCCH.
#### 7.12.1.2 Using Enhanced SRNS Relocation
This example shows Inter-RNS URA Update with switching in the CN (SRNS
Enhanced Relocation).
Figure 33A: Inter RNS URA Update with switching in CN using Enhanced SRNS
Relocation.
1\. UE sends a RRC message URA Update to the UTRAN, after having made cell re-
selection. Upon reception of a CCCH message from an unknown UE, the target RNC
becomes a controlling RNC and it allocates a new C-RNTI and a new D-RNTI for
the UE.
2\. The target RNC forwards the received uplink CCCH message towards the SRNC
by RNSAP **Uplink Signalling Transfer Indication** message to the old
Source/Controller RNC. Message includes, besides target RNC-ID, also the
allocated C-RNTI, which is to be used as UE identification within the C-RNC,
and the D-RNTI. Upon reception of the RNSAP message SRNC decides to perform
SRNS Enhanced Relocation towards the target RNC.
3\. Serving RNC Enhanced Relocation procedure is executed as defined in
subclause \'SRNS Enhanced Relocation (UE connected to a single CN node)\'.
After having completed SRNS Enhanced Relocation, target RNC allocates new
S-RNTI for the UE becoming the new serving RNC. New SRNC also deletes the
allocated C-RNTI, since it is not needed for an UE in URA_PCH state.
### 7.12.2 Inter-RNS URA Update via Iur without SRNS relocation
This example shows an Inter RNS URA update in DRNS without SRNS relocation. In
this example target RNS, source RNS and serving RNS are all located separately
from each other. Other scenarios can be easily derived from this most
comprehensive signalling procedure.
Please note that this example shows the case when no ciphering is required;
for this case no channels on Iur are required and therefore the message flow 5
(Cell Update Confirm) is sent on CCCH. In the case that ciphering is required,
that message must be sent on the DCCH (ciphering is performed at MAC-d level)
and the flow becomes similar to the one shown for the Cell Update in section
\"Cell Update via Iur without RNS relocation\".
Figure 34: Inter-RNS URA Update via Iur without SRNS relocation
1\. UE sends a RRC message URA Update to the UTRAN, after having made cell re-
selection and URA has changed.
2\. Upon reception of the message from a UE, Target RNC decodes the RNC ID and
the S-RNTI. The UE is not registered in the target RNC (RNC ID and SRNTI
unknown), thus RNC allocates C-RNTI and D-RNTI for the UE. The Target RNC
forward the received Uu signalling message towards the SRNC by RNSAP **Uplink
Signalling Transfer Indication** message. The message includes also the cell-
ID from which the message was received and the allocated C-RNTI and D-RNTI.
3\. Upon reception of the RNSAP message SRNC decides not to perform an SRNS
relocation towards the target RNC. The target RNC become C-RNC while SRNC
remains unchanged.
4\. SRNC delivers to Target RNC information upon, eventually new, RNTIs via a
**Downlink Signalling Transfer Request** , transporting a URA Update Confirm.
5\. The **URA Update Confirm** is forwarded to the UE (via CCCH with new
RNTIs) from the target RNC.
### 7.12.3 SRNS Relocation (UE connected to two CN nodes)
#### 7.12.3.1 Using SRNS Relocation
This example show SRNS Relocation, in situation in which the UE is connected
to two CN nodes simultaneously (this means that RNC is connected to a SGSN and
a MSC). It is assumed that:
• all cells in the active set are in one DRNC;
• the CN performs hard switching of the user traffic.
Figure 35: SRNS Relocation (UE connected to two CN nodes)
Note that the SRNC makes the decision to perform the Serving RNC relocation
procedure. The Serving RNC also decides into which RNC (Target RNC) the
Serving RNC functionality is to be relocated.
> 1./2. The source SRNC sends **Relocation Required** messages to both CN

At any phase, before the **Relocation Complete** message is sent, the old
communication link between the CN and UE is all the time existing and working
and the procedure execution can be stopped and original configuration easily
restored. If any such abnormal thing occurs a **Relocation Failure** may be
sent instead of any message numbered 3-13 described.
#### 7.12.3.2 Using Enhanced SRNS Relocation
This example show SRNS Relocation, in situation in which the UE is connected
to two CN nodes simultaneously (this means that RNC is connected to a SGSN and
a MSC). It is assumed that:
• all cells in the active set are in one DRNC;
• the CN performs hard switching of the user traffic.
Figure 35A: Enhanced SRNS Relocation (UE connected to two CN nodes)
Note that the SRNC makes the decision to perform the Serving RNC Enhanced
Relocation procedure. The Serving RNC also decides into which RNC (Target RNC)
the Serving RNC functionality is to be relocated.
1\. SRNC sends **Enhanced Relocation Request** messages to a neighboring RNC
(Target RNC).
Parameters: Relocation Type, Cause, SRNC-ID, S-RNTI, Chosen Integrity
Protection Algorithm, Integrity Protection Key, Target Cell ID, RRC Container
and RANAP Container. The source RNC shall set Relocation Type to \"UE Not
Involved\".
2\. Target RNC decides to accept the request and replies an RNSAP **Enhanced
Relocation Response** containing RRC Reconfiguration message in RRC Container
to be sent to UE to the Source RNC. After the reception of the Enhanced
Relocation Response, the Source RNC may begin forwarding of DL data to the
Target RNC after the establishment of transport bearer and UP initialization.
3\. Source RNC may send RNSAP **Relocation Commit** to the Target RNC. The
message contains SRNS Context including the sequence number of GTP-PDU next to
be transmitted in UL/DL and the next PDCP sequence number that would have been
used to send and received from UE in case delivery order is required or case
of PDCP reservation.
4\. Target RNC sends UE e.g. RRC UTRAN Mobility Information to inform the new
S-RNTI for the UE
5\. Target RNC receives the UTRAN Mobility Information Confirm from the UE.
6\. Target RNC sends the **RANAP Enhanced Relocation Complete Request**
message to the MSC, indicating that relocation is happened on the UE. In MSS-
MGW case, the MSS exchanges some messages with the MSS over Mc interface after
reception of the **RANAP: Enhanced Relocation Complete Request** message.
7\. Target RNC sends the **RANAP Enhanced Relocation Complete Request**
message to the SGSN, indicating that relocation is happened on the UE.
8\. MSC configures the necessary Iu resources for the Target RNC and
acknowledges with "**RANAP Enhanced Relocation Complete Response** " message
to the Target RNC. In case ATM Transport option is deployed over Iu-CS UP, the
MSC contains the Transport Layer Information in the message. After reception
of the message in the Target RNC, the RNC initiates to establish AAL2
connection and executes Iu UP initialization.
9\. SGSN configures the necessary Iu resources for the Target RNC and
acknowledges with "**RANAP Enhanced Relocation Complete Response** " message
to the Target RNC.
10\. After completion of UP initialization, the Target RNC sends **RANAP
Enhanced Relocation Complete Confirm** message to the MSC.
11\. MSC initiates release of the resources in the source RNC by sending
RANAP: **Iu Release Command**
12\. SGSN initiates release of the resources in the source RNC by sending
RANAP: **Iu Release Command**
> 13./14. SRNC confirm the IU release to the CN nodes sending the message **Iu
> Release Complete.**
## 7.13 HO & Cell Reselection between UTRAN and GSM/BSS
This subclause presents some examples of handover procedure from UTRAN to
GSM/BSS and vice versa.
The case of a UTRAN connected to UMTS CN connected to a 2G-MSC (i.e. via MAP/E
interface) is shown. The case of an UTRAN connected a GSM CN trough an IWF
(where RANAP is interworked with BSSMAP) is not shown, because is equivalent
from the point of view of the UTRAN.

### 7.13.1 UTRAN ⇒ GSM/BSS
#### 7.13.1.1 UTRAN ⇒ GSM/BSS
This example shows how handover (Hard Handover) is performed from UTRAN to
GSM/BSS between a UMTS CN and a 2G-MSC.
NOTE: Procedures between CN and MSC, and between MSC and BSC are out of the
scope of WG3, and are only included for clarity.
Figure 36: UTRAN ⇒ GSM/BSS handover
1\. Upon detection of a trigger SRNC sends RANAP message **Relocation
Required** to the CN.
2\. The UMTS CN will forward this request to the GSM MSC (indicated in the
received message) over the MAP/E interface (MAP message **Prepare Handover**).
Steps 3 & 4 follow the normal GSM procedures and are shown only for clarity.
5\. Once initial procedures are complete in GSM MSC/BSS the MSC returns MAP/E
message **Prepare** **Handover Response**.
6\. CN responds to the initial request from SRNC by sending RANAP message
**Relocation Command** to the SRNC.
7\. Via existing RRC connection, SRNC sends RRC message Handover from UTRAN
command to the UE One or several message from the other system can be included
in this message.
Procedures related to synchronisation etc. to GSM BSS are not shown.
Steps 8 & 10 follow normal GSM procedures and are shown only for clarity.
11\. Detection of the UE within the GSM coverage results in the MSC sending
MAP/E message **Send** **End** **Signal Request** to the CN.
12\. CN initiates release of resources allocated by the former SRNC (**Iu
Release Command**).
13\. Previously allocated bearer resources are released within UMTS (e.g.
using RANAP and ALCAP protocols [ALCAP not shown]) (Iu Release Complete).
14\. Procedure is concluded from UMTS point of view by CN sending MAP/E
message Send End Signal Response (this message is not sent until the end of
the call).
#### 7.13.1.2 Service Based Intersystem Handover
If the _Service Handover_ IE is included in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST
message, the service based intersystem handover from UMTS to GSM can be
performed. The following example shows the signalling flow.
Figure 36a: Service based UTRAN to GSM/BSS Intersystem Handover
1\. CN initiates establishment of the radio access bearer with RANAP message
**Radio Access Bearer Assignment Request**.\ Parameters: Service Handover.
2 RRC message **Radio Bearer Setup** is sent by RNC to UE.
3 UE sends RRC message **Radio Bearer Setup Complete** to RNC.
4 RNC sends RANAP message **Radio Access Bearer Assignment Response** to CN.
5 Being based on the value assumed from _Service Handover_ IE, the RNC decides
to perform handover towards GSM.
6 RNC sends RANAP message **Relocation Required** to the CN.
Steps 7 to 19 are the same as 2 to 14 in subclause 7.13.1.1.
#### 7.13.1.3 Directed Retry
Directed retry could be used to avoid the assignment phase, allowing direct
assignment of resources on GSM system by CN. The following figure shows the
signalling flow.
Figure 36b: Directed Retry
1\. CN initiates establishment of the radio access bearer with RANAP message
**Radio Access Bearer Assignment Request**.
2\. RNC decides to perform relocated avoiding the Radio Bearer Setup phase.

### 7.13.2 GSM/BSS ⇒ UTRAN
This example shows how handover (Hard Handover) is performed from GSM/BSS to
UMTS between a UMTS CN and a 2G-MSC.
NOTE: Procedures between CN and MSC, and between MSC and BSC are out of the
scope of WG3, and are only included for clarity.
Figure 37: GSM/BSS ⇒ UTRAN handover
1\. The BSC sends **Handover Required** message to the GSM MSC.
2\. The MSC sends MAP/E message **Prepare** **Handover** to the UMTS CN.
3\. The CN sends RANAP message **Relocation Request** to the Target RNC.
4\. Response **Relocation Request Acknowledge** is returned to the CN by the
target RNC via RANAP.
5\. MAP/E message **Prepare** **Handover Response** is sent by the UMTS CN to
the MSC.
Steps 6 and 7 follow normal GSM procedures and are shown only for clarity.
8\. When target RNC has detected the UE, **Relocation Detect** message is sent
to the CN node.
9\. When the RRC connection is established with the target RNC and necessary
radio resources have been allocated the UE sends RRC message **Handover to
UTRAN Complete** to the target RNC.
10\. Once complete the target RNC sends RANAP message **Relocation Complete**
to the CN.
11\. CN sends MAP/E message **Send End Signal Request** to the MSC.
12\. The MSC sends **Clear Command** message to the BSC.
13\. The BSC responds with **Clear Complete** message to the GSM
15\. The MSC sends MAP/E message **Send End Signal Response** to the UMTS CN
to conclude the procedure (this message is not sent until the end of the
call).

The SRNC initiates a Radio Link Reconfiguration by sending the RNSAP message **Radio Link Reconfiguration Prepare** to DRNC.\ Parameters: HS-DSCH information and a SRNC selected HS-PDSCH RL ID.
  2. The DRNC requests the respective Node B to prepare the synchronised RL reconfiguration by sending the NBAP message **Radio Link Reconfiguration Prepare**.\ Parameters: HS-DSCH Information, a DRNC selected HS-DSCH RNTI and the HS-PDSCH RL ID.
  3. Node B configures resources for the HS-DSCH and responds with the NBAP message **Radio Link Reconfiguration Ready**.\ Parameters: HS-DSCH Information Response.
  4. When the DRNC has completed the preparation phase, the RNSAP message **Radio Link Reconfiguration Ready** is sent to the SRNC.\ Parameters: HS-DSCH Information Response and the DRNC selected HS-DSCH-RNTI.
  5. The RNSAP message **Radio Link Reconfiguration Commit** is sent from SRNC to DRNC.
  6. The NBAP message **Radio Link Reconfiguration Commit** is sent from DRNC to Node B.
  7. The DRNC initiates set-up of Iub Data Transport Bearers using ALCAP protocol. This request contains the AAL2 Binding Identity to bind the Iub Data Transport Bearer to the HS-DSCH.
  8. The SRNC initiates set-up of Iur Data Transport bearer using ALCAP protocol. This request contains the AAL2 Binding Identity to bind the Iur Data Transport Bearer to the HS-DSCH.
  9. The SRNC sends the RRC message **Radio Bearer Reconfiguration** to the UE to establish the requested HS-DSCH.
  10. The UE replies with the RRC message **Radio Bearer Reconfiguration Complete**. At this point in time, the HS-DSCH Transport Channel has been set up, and it is assumed that the MAC-hs in the Node B has already been configured earlier to have access to a pool of HS-PDSCH resources for HS-DSCH scheduling.
  11. As soon as the SRNC detects the necessity to send HS-DL data on one HS-DSCH, it sends an HS-DSCH **Capacity Request** control frame within the HS-DSCH Frame Protocol to the CRNC.\ Parameters: Common Transport Channel Priority Indicator and User Buffer Size.
  12. The CRNC forwards this message (HS-DSCH **Capacity Request** control frame) to the Node B. So in this example sequence, the CRNC does not interfere with the HS-DSCH scheduling.\ Parameters: Common Transport Channel Priority Indicator and User Buffer Size.
  13. The Node B determines the amount of data (credits) that can be transmitted on the HS-DSCH and reports this information back to the DRNC in a HS-DSCH **Capacity Allocation** control frame in the HS-DSCH Frame Protocol.\ Parameters: Common Transport Channel Priority Indicator, HS-DSCH Credits, HS-DSCH Interval, HS-DSCH Repetition period, Maximum MAC-d PDU length.

  15. The SRNC starts sending DL data to the Node B. This is done via the two HS-DSCH Frame Protocol \"hops\" on Iur and Iub interface. The Node B schedules the DL transmission of DL data on HS-DSCH which includes allocation of PDSCH resources.
  16. The Node B transmits the control information for the concerned UE using the HS-SCCH.
  17. The Node B sends the HS-DSCH data to the UE on the HS-PDSCH(s).
## 7.18 Channel and Mobile State Switching on Iur
### 7.18.1 General Description
This subclause shows an example of switching of a mobile protocol state to
another, which Iur is used, thus involving RNSAP procedure.
### 7.18.2 Switching from Cell_FACH to Cell_DCH State
The following examples show switching of protocol state from Cell_FACH to
Cell_DCH providing UE with information on RACH/FACH flows and involving DRNC
and Iur.
The resulting sequence is the following:
Figure 45b Switching from Cell_FACH to Cell_DCH State via Iur
1\. SRNC decides to switch to CELL_DCH state, setting up a new radio link via
a new cell controlled by DRNC.\ SRNC requests DRNC for radio resources by
sending RNSAP message **Radio Link Setup Request**. If this is the first radio
link via the DRNC for this UE, a new Iur signalling connection is established.
This Iur signalling connection will be used for all RNSAP signalling related
to this UE.\ Parameters: Cell id, Transport Format Set per DCH, Transport
Format Combination Set, frequency, UL scrambling code.
2\. DRNC sends NBAP message **Radio Link Setup Request** to Node B.\
Parameters: Cell id, Transport Format Set per DCH, Transport Format
Combination Set, frequency, UL scrambling code.
3\. Successful outcome is reported in NBAP message **Radio Link Setup
Response**.\ Parameters: Signalling link termination, Transport layer
addressing information (AAL2 address, AAL2 Binding Identitie(s)) for Data
Transport Bearer(s).
Then Node B starts the UL reception.
4\. DRNC sends RNSAP message **Radio Link Setup Response** to SRNC.\
Parameters: Transport layer addressing information (AAL2 address, AAL2 Binding
Identity) for Data Transport Bearer(s), Neighbouring cell information.
5\. SRNC initiates setup of Iur, while DRNC is in charge to setup Iub, Data
Transport Bearer using ALCAP protocol. This request contains the AAL2 Binding
Identity to bind the Iub Data Transport Bearer to DCH.\ Note: there is not a
time relation between set up of Iur and Iub. Both must be carried out before
next step.
6\. Node B and SRNC establish synchronism for the Data Transport Bearer by
means of exchange of the appropriate DCH Frame Protocol frames via **Downlink
Synchronisation** and **Uplink Synchronisation** , relative to already
existing radio link(s).\ Then Node B starts DL transmission.
7\. SRNC sends RRC message **Physical Channel Reconfiguration** to UE on
DCCH.\ Parameters: Update type, Cell id, DL scrambling code, Power control
information, Ncell information.
8\. Node B achieves uplink sync on the Uu and notifies DRNC with NBAP message
**Radio Link Restore Indication**.
9\. DRNC sends RNSAP message **Radio Link Restore Indication** to notify SRNC
_that uplink sync has been achieved on the Uu._
10\. After the reconfiguration, the UE sends RRC message **Physical Channel
Reconfiguration Complete** to SRNC.
11\. The SRNC releases the UE context for CELL_FACH state in the source DRNC
by sending a **Common Transport Channel Resources Release** message.
### 7.18.3 Switching from Cell_DCH to Cell_FACH State
In the this scenario the SRNC needs to get the C-RNTI from DRNC to be able to
indicate to the UE a new C-RNTI and which cell it is valid in (given by the
Primary Scrambling Code).
The SRNC also needs to get either:
  1. information in the RACH and/or FACH to be used (if the DRNC selects RACH and/or FACH in a different way than the UE would do based on broadcast information) including User Plane flow control information for the Iur FACH FP.
  2. User Plane flow control information for the FACH (Secondary CCPCH) that the UE selects if no Secondary CCPCH information is provide to the UE in the RRC Physical Channel Reconfiguration message
If receiving the C-ID the DRNC shall allocate a C-RNTI and provide it together
with the Primary CPICH information to the SRNC. Further more, if the DRNC
would like to select another RACH and/or FACH than the UE would select based
on the broadcast information the DRNC also provides information on the DRNC
Selected RACH and/or FACH (alternative 1). If the DRNC does not select any
FACH the DRNC shall provide the user plane flow control information
(alternative 2).
The above solution would result in the following sequence:
Figure 45c Switching from Cell_DCH to Cell_FACH State via Iur
1\. SRNC decides to switch to CELL_FACH state, releasing its present radio
link via a cell controlled by DRNC.\ The SRNC decides to setup a common
channel for the UE via DRNC, informing DRNC with C-ID IE of the UE in order to
obtain C-RNTI (allocated in the next step by DRNC) needed for RRC messages.
This setup is done with the RNSAP **Common Transport Channel Resources
Initialisation Request** message.
2\. The target DRNC sends the transport layer address, binding identity and
C-RNTI to the SRNC with the RNSAP **Common Transport Channel Resources
Initialisation Response** message
3\. SRNC initiates setup of Iur/Iub Data Transport Bearer (if needed) using
ALCAP protocol. This request contains the AAL2 Binding Identity to bind the
Iub Data Transport Bearer
4\. SRNC sends RRC message **Physical Channel Reconfiguration** to UE on DCCH,
with new C-RNTI and identification of the cell where it is valid.
5\. After the reconfiguration, the UE sends RRC message **Physical Channel
Reconfiguration Complete** to SRNC. Parameters: Update type, Cell id, DL
scrambling code, Power control information, Ncell information.
6\. SRNC releases DRNC for radio resources allocated for DCH by sending RNSAP
message **Radio Link Deletion Request** \ Parameters: Cell id, Transport
Format Set per DCH, Transport Format Combination Set, frequency, UL scrambling
code.
7\. DRNC sends NBAP message **Radio Link Deletion Request** to Node B.
8\. Successful outcome is reported in NBAP message **Radio Link Deletion
Response**.\ DRNC sends RNSAP message **Radio Link Deletion Response** to
SRNC.
9\. Not used resources in DRNC and Node B (Drift RNS) are released. DRNC
initiates release of Iub and SRNC of Iur Data Transport bearer using ALCAP
protocol.
NOTE: there is not a time relation between set up of Iur and Iub. Both must be
carried out before next step.

### 7.20.2 Soft Handover [FDD]
Radio Link Addition (Branch Addition):
This example shows establishment of a radio link via a Node B controlled by
another RNC than the serving RNC.
Figure 53: Soft Handover - Radio Link Addition (Branch Addition)
1\. SRNC decides to setup a radio link with E-DCH via a new cell controlled by
another RNC. The E-DCH serving RL is not in the new NodeB. So, this scenario
is a soft HO branch addition without simultaneous serving E-DCH RL change.
SRNC requests DRNC for radio resources by sending RNSAP message **Radio Link
Setup Request**. If this is the first radio link via the DRNC for this UE, a
new Iur signalling connection is established. This Iur signalling connection
will be used for all RNSAP signalling related to this UE.\ Parameters: E-DPCH
Information **(TFCS, TTI)** , E-DCH FDD Information.
2\. If requested resources are available, DRNC sends NBAP message **Radio Link
Setup Request** to Node B.\ Parameters: Cell id, **UL DPDCH Indicator for
E-DCH operation** , **E-DPCH Information** , E-DCH FDD Information.\ Then Node
B starts the UL reception of DPCCH only. Reception of DPDCH, E-DPCCH and
E-DPDCH will start only after Iub TBs are setup and UL sync is achieved.
3\. Node B selects for each Radio Link of the specific UE, one of the
E-RGCH/E-HICH codes, allocates an E-RGCH sequence number and an E-HICH
sequence number, and sends this info to the RNC. Similarly, the Node B selects
for the E-DCH serving Radio Link one of the E-AGCH codes, allocates an E-RNTI
and sends this info to the RNC with NBAP message **Radio Link Setup
Response**.\ Parameters: E-DCH RL Set ID, E-DCH FDD DL Control Channel
Information, E-DCH FDD Information Response.
4\. DRNC sends RNSAP message **Radio Link Setup Response** to SRNC.\
Parameters: E-DCH FDD Information Response, E-DCH RL Set ID, E-DCH FDD DL
Control Channel Information.
5\. SRNC initiates setup of Iur/Iub Data Transport Bearer using ALCAP
protocol. This request contains the AAL2 Binding Identity to bind the Iub Data
Transport Bearer to E-DCH.\ This may be repeated for each Iur/Iub Data
Transport Bearer to be setup.
6./7. Node B achieves uplink sync on the Uu and notifies DRNC with NBAP
message **Radio Link Restore Indication**. In its turn DRNC notifies SRNC with
RNSAP message **Radio Link Restore Indication.**
8./9. Node B and SRNC establish synchronism for the Data Transport Bearer(s)
by means of exchange of the appropriate DCH Frame Protocol frames **Downlink
Synchronisation** and **Uplink Synchronisation** , relative already existing
radio link(s). Then Node B starts DL transmission.
10.SRNC sends RRC message **Active Set Update** (Radio Link Addition) to UE on
DCCH.\ Parameters: Update type, Cell id, DL scrambling code, Power control
information, Ncell information.
11\. UE acknowledges with RRC message **Active Set Update Complete**.
