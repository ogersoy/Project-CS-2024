# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following definitions apply:
**Enhanced performance requirements type 1** : This defines performance
requirements which are optional for the UE. The requirements are based on UEs
which utilise receiver diversity.
**Enhanced performance requirements type 2** : This defines performance
requirements which are optional for the UE, The requirements are based on UEs
which utilise a chip equaliser receiver structure.
**Enhanced performance requirements type 3** : This defines performance
requirements which are optional for the UE, The requirements are based on UEs
which utilise a chip equaliser receiver structure with receiver diversity.
**Enhanced performance requirements type 3i** : This defines performance
requirements which are optional for the UE, The requirements are based on UEs
which utilise an interference-aware chip equaliser receiver structure with
receiver diversity.
**Power Spectral Density:** The units of Power Spectral Density (PSD) are
extensively used in this document. PSD is a function of power versus frequency
and when integrated across a given bandwidth, the function represents the mean
power in such a bandwidth. When the mean power is normalised to (divided by)
the chip-rate it represents the mean energy per chip. Some signals are
directly defined in terms of energy per chip, (DPCH_E~c~, E~c~, OCNS_E~c~ and
S-CCPCH_E~c~) and others defined in terms of PSD (I~o~, I~oc~, I~or~ and
Î~or~). There also exist quantities that are a ratio of energy per chip to PSD
(DPCH_E~c~/I~or~, E~c~/I~or~ etc.). This is the common practice of relating
energy magnitudes in communication systems.\ It can be seen that if both
energy magnitudes in the ratio are divided by time, the ratio is converted
from an energy ratio to a power ratio, which is more useful from a measurement
point of view. It follows that an energy per chip of X dBm/3.84 MHz can be
expressed as a mean power per chip of X dBm. Similarly, a signal PSD of Y
dBm/3.84 MHz can be expressed as a signal power of Y dBm.
**Maximum Output Power:** This s a measure of the maximum power the UE can
transmit (i.e. the actual power as would be measured assuming no measurement
error) in a bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio
access mode. The period of measurement shall be at least one timeslot. For DC-
HSUPA the maximum output power is defined by the sum of the broadband transmit
power of each carrier in the UE.
**Mean power:** When applied to a W-CDMA modulated signal this is the power
(transmitted or received) in a bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip
rate of the radio access mode. The period of measurement shall be at least one
timeslot unless otherwise stated.
**Nominal Maximum Output Power:** This is the nominal power defined by the UE
power class.
**Primary uplink frequency** : If a single uplink frequency is configured for
the UE, then it is the primary uplink frequency. In case more than one uplink
frequency is configured for the UE, then the primary uplink frequency is the
frequency on which the E-DCH corresponding to the serving E-DCH cell
associated with the serving HS-DSCH cell is transmitted. The association
between a pair of uplink and downlink frequencies is indicated by higher
layers.
**RRC filtered mean power:** The mean power as measured through a root raised
cosine filter with roll-off factor α and a bandwidth equal to the chip rate of
the radio access mode.
NOTE 1: The RRC filtered mean power of a perfectly modulated W-CDMA signal is
0.246 dB lower than the mean power of the same signal.
NOTE 2: The roll-off factor α is defined in section 6.8.1.
**Secondary serving HS-DSCH cell(s)** : In addition to the serving HS-DSCH
cell, the set of cells where the UE is configured to simultaneously monitor an
HS-SCCH set and receive the HS-DSCH if it is scheduled in that cell. There can
be up to 3 secondary serving HS-DSCH cells.
**Secondary uplink frequency** : A secondary uplink frequency is a frequency
on which an E-DCH corresponding to a serving E-DCH cell associated with a
secondary serving HS-DSCH cell is transmitted. The association between a pair
of uplink and downlink frequencies is indicated by higher layers.
**Throughput: Number of information bits per second excluding CRC bits
successfully received on HS-DSCH by a HSDPA capable UE.**
**1^st^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell:** If the UE is configured with two
uplink frequencies, the 1^st^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell is the secondary
serving HS-DSCH cell that is associated with the secondary uplink frequency.
If the UE is configured with a single uplink frequency, the 1^st^ secondary
serving HS-DSCH cell is a secondary serving HS-DSCH cell whose index is
indicated by higher layers.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship between Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification 34.121 Annex F defines Test
Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test.
The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in this
specification to create Test Requirements.
The measurement results returned by the test system are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 section 6.5.
## 4.2 Power Classes
For UE power classes 1 and 2, a number of RF parameter are not specified. It
is intended that these are part of a later release.
## 4.3 Control and monitoring functions
This requirement verifies that the control and monitoring functions of the UE
prevent it from transmitting if no acceptable cell can be found by the UE.
### 4.3.1 Minimum requirement
The power of the UE, as measured with a thermal detector, shall not exceed
-30dBm if no acceptable cell can be found by the UE.
## 4.4 RF requirements in later releases
The standardisation of new frequency bands may be independent of a release.
However, in order to implement a UE that conforms to a particular release but
supports a band of operation that is specified in a later release, it is
necessary to specify some extra requirements. TS 25.307 [9] specifies
requirements on UEs supporting a frequency band that is independent of
release.
NOTE: For terminals conforming to the 3GPP release of the present document,
some RF requirements in later releases may be mandatory independent of whether
the UE supports the bands specified in later releases or not. The set of
requirements from later releases that is also mandatory for UEs conforming to
the 3GPP release of the present document is determined by regional regulation.
# 5 Frequency bands and channel arrangement

single/dual band 4C-HSDPA with dual UL frequencies, the TX-RX frequency
separation in Table 5.0A shall be applied to the primary UL frequency and DL
frequency of the serving HS-DSCH cell, and to the secondary UL frequency and
the frequency of the 1^st^ secondary serving HS-DSCH cell respectively.
g) For bands XII, XIII and XIV, all the requirements in TS 25.101 are
applicable only for a single uplink carrier frequency, however dual cell
uplink operation may be considered in future releases.
## 5.4 Channel arrangement
### 5.4.1 Channel spacing
The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario. In DC-HSDPA and DB-DC-HSDPA
mode, the UE receives two cells simultaneously. In context of DC-HSDPA and DB-
DC-HSDPA, a cell is characterized by a combination of scrambling code and a
carrier frequency, see [21.905].
### 5.4.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 200 kHz, for all bands which means that the centre
frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition a number of
additional centre frequencies are specified according to table 5.1A, which
means that the centre frequencies for these channels are shifted 100 kHz
relative to the general raster.
### 5.4.3 Channel number
The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (UARFCN). For each operating Band, the UARFCN values are
defined as follows:
Uplink: N~U~ = 5 * (F~UL~ - F~UL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~UL_low~ ≤ F~UL~ ≤ F~UL_high~
Downlink: N~D~ = 5 * (F~DL~ - F~DL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~DL_low~ ≤ F~DL~ ≤ F~DL_high~
For each operating Band, F~UL_Offset~, F~UL_low~, F~UL_high~, F~DL_Offset~,,
F~DL_low~ and F~DL_high~ are defined in Table 5.1 for the general UARFCN. For
the additional UARFCN, F~UL_Offset~, F~DL_Offset~ and the specific F~UL~ and

NOTE: If the UE is on a network with Mobile Country Code set to Japan then it
may assume that any DL UARFCN sent by the network from the overlapping region
of Band V and Band VI is from Band VI. If the UE is on a network with a Mobile
Country Code other than Japan then it may assume that any DL UARFCN sent by
the network from the overlapping region of Band V and Band VI is from Band V.
# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified at the
antenna connector of the UE. For UE with integral antenna only, a reference
antenna with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed. Transmitter characteristics for UE(s)
with multiple antennas/antenna connectors are FFS.
The UE antenna performance has a significant impact on system performance, and
minimum requirements on the antenna efficiency are therefore intended to be
included in future versions of the present document. It is recognised that
different requirements and test methods are likely to be required for the
different types of UE.
UEs supporting DC-HSUPA shall support both minimum requirements, as well as
additional requirements for DC-HSUPA.
Unless otherwise stated, for the additional requirements for DC-HSUPA, all the
parameters in clause 6 are defined using the UL E-DCH reference measurement
channel, specified in subclause A.2.6. For the additional requirements for DC-
HSUPA, the spacing of the carrier frequencies of the two cells shall be 5 MHz.
## 6.2 Transmit power
### 6.2.1 UE maximum output power
The following Power Classes define the nominal maximum output power. The
nominal power defined is the broadband transmit power of the UE, i.e. the
power in a bandwidth of at least (1+α) times the chip rate of the radio access
mode. The period of measurement shall be at least one timeslot. For DC-HSUPA,
the nominal transmit power is defined by the sum of the broadband transmit
power of each carrier in the UE.
Table 6.1: UE Power Classes

given in Table 6.2.5A-3 of TS 36.101[10] for those UTRA operating bands
corresponding to the E-UTRA operating bands that belong to the supported
inter-band carrier aggregation configurations. The tolerance in Table 6.2.5A-3
of TS 36.101[10] does not apply to supported UTRA operating bands with
frequency range below 1 GHz that correspond to the E-UTRA operating bands that
belong to the supported inter-band carrier aggregation configurations when
such bands are belonging only to band combination(s) where one band is \1.7GHz and there is no harmonic relationship between the
low band UL and high band DL.
In case the UE supports DB-DC-HSDPA or dual band 4C-HSDPA configurations and
one or more of the E-UTRA inter-band carrier aggregation configurations listed
in Table 6.2.5A-3 of TS36.101[10] with a UTRA operating band that belongs to
UTRA and E-UTRA carrier aggregation configurations, then
\- When the UTRA operating band frequency range is ≤ 1GHz, the applicable
additional tolerance shall be the average of the applicable tolerances,
truncated to one decimal place for that operating band among the supported DB-
DC-HSDPA, dual band 4C-HSDPA, and E-UTRA CA configurations, with the DB-DC-
HSDPA, dual carrier 4C-HSDPA, and E-UTRA CA configurations counted separately.
In case there is a harmonic relation between low band UL and high band DL,
then the maximum tolerance among the different supported carrier aggregation
configurations involving such band shall be applied
\- When the UTRA operating band frequency range is >1GHz, the applicable
additional tolerance shall be the maximum tolerance that applies for that
operating band among the supported DB-DC-HSDPA, dual band 4C-HSDPA, and E-UTRA
CA configurations.
### 6.2.2 UE maximum output~,~ power with HS-DPCCH and E-DCH
The Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the nominal maximum output power defined
in 6.2.1 is specified in table 6.1A for the values of β~c~^,^ β~d~^,^ β~hs,~
β~ec~ and β~ed~ defined in [8] fully or partially transmitted during a DPCCH

The required accuracy of the UE relative CDP is given in table 6.1B. The UE
relative CDP accuracy shall be maintained over the period during which the
total of all active code powers remains unchanged or one timeslot, whichever
is the longer.
The reference measurement channels for the requirements in subclause 6.2.3A
are provided in subclause A.2.6 and A.2.7.
## 6.3 Frequency Error
The UE modulated carrier frequency shall be accurate to within ±0.1 PPM
observed over a period of one timeslot compared to the carrier frequency
received from the Node B. For the PRACH preambles the measurement interval is
lengthened to 3904 chips (being the 4096 chip nominal preamble period less a
25 μs transient period allowance at each end of the burst). These signals will
have an apparent error due to Node B frequency error and Doppler shift. The
signals from the Node B must be averaged over sufficient time that errors due
to noise or interference are within the above ±0.1PPM figure. The UE shall use
the same frequency source for both RF frequency generation and the chip clock.
## 6.3A Frequency Error for DC-HSUPA
The UE modulated carrier frequencies shall be accurate to within ±0.1 PPM
observed over a period of one timeslot compared to the average of the carrier
frequencies received from the Node B. When the signal from one Node B cell is
out-of-sync, the UE modulated carrier frequency shall be compared to the
remaining carrier frequency received from the other Node B cell. These signals
will have an apparent error due to Node B frequency error and Doppler shift.
The signals from the Node B must be averaged over sufficient time such that
errors due to noise or interference are within the above ±0.1PPM figure. The
frequency error of the carrier frequencies received from the Node B shall be
the same in average. The UE shall use the same frequency source for both RF
frequency generation and the chip clock.
## 6.4 Output power dynamics
Power control is used to limit the interference level.
### 6.4.1 Open loop power control
Open loop power control is the ability of the UE transmitter to sets its
output power to a specific value. The open loop power control tolerance is
given in Table 6.3
#### 6.4.1.1 Minimum requirement
The UE open loop power is defined as the mean power in a timeslot or ON power
duration, whichever is available.

#### 6.4.1.1A Additional requirement for DC-HSUPA
The open loop power control tolerance per carrier is given in Table 6.3.
### 6.4.2 Inner loop power control in the uplink
Inner loop power control in the Uplink is the ability of the UE transmitter to
adjust its output power in accordance with one or more TPC commands received
in the downlink.
#### 6.4.2.1 Power control steps
The power control step is the change in the UE transmitter output power in
response to a single TPC command, TPC_cmd, derived at the UE.
##### 6.4.2.1.1 Minimum requirement
The UE transmitter shall have the capability of changing the output power with
a step size of 1, 2 and 3 dB according to the value of ∆~TPC~ or ∆~RP-TPC~, in
the slot immediately after the TPC_cmd as follows
a) The transmitter output power step due to inner loop power control shall be
within the range shown in Table 6.4.
b) The transmitter average output power step due to inner loop power control
shall be within the range shown in Table 6.5. Here a TPC_cmd group is a set of
TPC_cmd values derived from a corresponding sequence of TPC commands of the
same duration.
The inner loop power step is defined as the relative power difference between
the mean power of the original (reference) timeslot and the mean power of the
target timeslot, not including the transient duration. The transient duration
is from 25μs before the slot boundary to 25μs after the slot boundary.

The UE shall meet the above requirements with the exceptions defined below for
inner loop power control over the power range bounded by the Minimum output
power as defined in subclause 6.4.3, and the Maximum output power supported by
the UE (i.e. the actual power as would be measured assuming no measurement
error). This power shall be in the range specified for the power class of the
UE in subclause 6.2.1. For each direction, up to 2 exceptions to the
transmitter power control range defined in table 6.4 shall be allowed. The
transmitter power control range for exceptions is defined in table 6.4A.
6.4.2.1.1A Additional requirement for DC-HSUPA
The UE transmitter shall have the capability of changing the output power in
each assigned carrier in the uplink with a step size of 1, 2 and 3 dB
according to the value of ∆~TPC~ or ∆~RP-TPC~, in the slot immediately after
the TPC_cmd for the corresponding carrier as follows
a) The transmitter output power step due to inner loop power control in each
assigned carrier in the uplink shall be within the range shown in Table 6.4
with the exceptions defined below, when the total transmit power in each of
the assigned carriers is equal to each other.
b) The transmitter average output power step due to inner loop power control
in each assigned carrier in the uplink shall be within the range shown in
Table 6.5 with the exceptions defined below, when the total transmit power in
each of the assigned carriers is equal to each other. Here a TPC_cmd group is
a set of TPC_cmd values derived from a corresponding sequence of TPC commands
of the same duration.
c) The requirements can be tested by sending the same TPC commands for each of
the assigned carriers, assuming that the signal powers for the carriers (in
terms of DPCCH code power and total power) have been aligned prior to the
beginning of the test procedure.
The inner loop power step is defined as the relative power difference between
the mean power of the original (reference) timeslot and the mean power of the
target timeslot in each carrier, not including the transient duration. The
transient duration is from 25μs before the slot boundary to 25μs after the
slot boundary. For each direction, up to 2 exceptions to the transmitter power
control range defined in table 6.4 shall be allowed. The transmitter power
control range for exceptions is defined in table 6.4A.
### 6.4.3 Minimum output power
The minimum controlled output power of the UE is when the power is set to a
minimum value.
#### 6.4.3.1 Minimum requirement
The minimum output power is defined as the mean power in one time slot. The
minimum output power shall be less than -50 dBm.
#### 6.4.3.1A Additional requirement for DC-HSUPA
The minimum output power is defined as the mean power in one time slot in each
carrier. The minimum output power in each carrier shall be less than -50 dBm,
when both carriers are set to minimum output power.
### 6.4.4 Out-of-synchronization handling of output power
The receiver characteristics in this section are specified at the antenna
connector of the UE. For UE(s) with an integral antenna only, a reference
antenna with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed. UE with an integral antenna may be
taken into account by converting these power levels into field strength
requirements, assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna. For UEs with more than one
receiver antenna connector the AWGN signals applied to each receiver antenna
connector shall be uncorrelated. The levels of the test signal applied to each
of the antenna connectors shall be as defined in section 6.4.4.2 below.
The UE shall monitor the DPCCH quality in order to detect a loss of the signal
on Layer 1, as specified in TS 25.214. The thresholds Q~out~ and Q~in~ specify
at what DPCCH quality levels the UE shall shut its power off and when it shall
turn its power on respectively. The thresholds are not defined explicitly, but
are defined by the conditions under which the UE shall shut its transmitter
off and turn it on, as stated in this subclause.
The DPCCH quality shall be monitored in the UE and compared to the thresholds
Q~out~ and Q~in~ for the purpose of monitoring synchronization. The threshold
Q~out~ should correspond to a level of DPCCH quality where no reliable
detection of the TPC commands transmitted on the downlink DPCCH can be made.
This can be at a TPC command error ratio level of e.g. 30%. The threshold
Q~in~ should correspond to a level of DPCCH quality where detection of the TPC
commands transmitted on the downlink DPCCH is significantly more reliable than
at Q~out~. This can be at a TPC command error ratio level of e.g. 20%.
#### 6.4.4.1 Minimum requirement
When the UE estimates the DPCCH quality or the quality of the TPC fields of
the F-DPCH frame received from the serving HS-DSCH cell over the last 160 ms
period or quality of the TPC fields of the F-DPCH from the serving HS-DSCH
cell over the previous 240 slots in which the TPC symbols are known to be
present when the discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission operation is enabled
to be worse than a threshold Q~out~, the UE shall shut its transmitter off
within 40 ms. The UE shall not turn its transmitter on again until the DPCCH
quality exceeds an acceptable level Q~in~. When the UE estimates the DPCCH
quality or the quality of the TPC fields of the F-DPCH frame received from the
serving HS-DSCH cell over the last 160 ms period or quality of the TPC fields
of the F-DPCH from the serving HS-DSCH cell over the previous 240 slots in
which the TPC symbols are known to be present when the discontinuous uplink
DPCCH transmission operation is enabled to be better than a threshold Q~in~,
the UE shall again turn its transmitter on within 40 ms.
The UE transmitter shall be considered \"off\" if the transmitted power is
below the level defined in subclause 6.5.1 (Transmit off power). Otherwise the
transmitter shall be considered as \"on\".
#### 6.4.4.2 Test case
This subclause specifies a test case, which provides additional information
for how the minimum requirement should be interpreted for the purpose of
conformance testing.
The quality levels at the thresholds Q~out~ and Q~in~ correspond to different
signal levels depending on the downlink conditions DCH parameters. For the
conditions in Table 6.6, a signal with the quality at the level Q~out~ can be
generated by a DPCCH_Ec/Ior ratio of -25 dB, and a signal with Q~in~ by a
DPCCH_Ec/Ior ratio of -21 dB. For a UE which supports the optional enhanced
performance requirements type1 for DCH a signal with the quality at the level
Q~out~ can be instead generated by a DPCCH_Ec/Ior ratio of -28 dB, and a
signal with Q~in~ by a DPCCH_Ec/Ior ratio of -24 dB for the conditions in
Table 6.6. The DL reference measurement channel (12.2) kbps specified in
subclause A.3.1 and with static propagation conditions. The downlink physical
channels, other than those specified in Table 6.6, are as specified in Table
C.3 of Annex C.
Figure 6.1 shows an example scenario where the DPCCH_Ec/Ior ratio varies from
a level where the DPCH is demodulated under normal conditions, down to a level
below Q~out~ where the UE shall shut its power off and then back up to a level
above Q~in~ where the UE shall turn the power back on. Figure 6.1A shows an
example scenario for a UE which supports the optional enhanced performance
requirements type1 for DCH, where the DPCCH_Ec/Ior ratio varies from a level
where the DPCH is demodulated under normal conditions, down to a level below
Q~out~ where the UE shall shut its power off and then back up to a level above
Q~in~ where the UE shall turn the power back on.

In this test case, the requirements for the UE are that:
1\. The UE shall not shut its transmitter off before point B.
2\. The UE shall shut its transmitter off before point C, which is T~off~ =
200 ms after point B.
3\. The UE shall not turn its transmitter on between points C and E.
4\. The UE shall turn its transmitter on before point F, which is T~on~ = 200
ms after point E.
## 6.5 Transmit ON/OFF power
### 6.5.1 Transmit OFF power
Transmit OFF power is defined as the RRC filtered mean power when the
transmitter is off. The transmitter is considered to be off when the UE is not
allowed to transmit or during periods when the UE is not transmitting DPCCH
due to discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission. During UL compressed mode
gaps, the UE is not considered to be off.
#### 6.5.1.1 Minimum requirement
The transmit OFF power is defined as the RRC filtered mean power in a duration
of at least one timeslot excluding any transient periods. The requirement for
the transmit OFF power shall be less than -56 dBm.
#### 6.5.1.1A Additional requirement for DC-HSUPA
The transmit OFF power is defined per carrier as the RRC filtered mean power
in a duration of at least one timeslot excluding any transient periods. The
requirement for the transmit OFF power in each carrier shall be less than -56
dBm, when the transmitters in both carriers are turned off.
### 6.5.2 Transmit ON/OFF Time mask
The time mask for transmit ON/OFF defines the transient period allowed for the
UE between transmit OFF power and transmit ON power. During the transient
period there are no additional requirements on UE transmit power beyond what
is required in subclause 6.2 maximum output power observed over a period of at
least one timeslot. ON/OFF scenarios include PRACH preamble bursts, the
beginning or end of PRACH message parts, the beginning or end of each
discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission gap and the beginning or end of UL
DPCH transmissions.
#### 6.5.2.1 Minimum requirement
The transmit power levels versus time shall meet the requirements in figure
6.2 for PRACH preambles, the requirements in figure 6.2A for discontinuous
uplink DPCCH transmission and the requirements in figure 6.3 for all other
cases. The off power observation period is defined as the RRC filtered mean
power in a duration of at least one timeslot excluding any transient periods.
The on power observation period is defined as the mean power over one timeslot
excluding any transient periods. For PRACH preambles, the on power observation
period is 3904 chips (4096 chips less the transient periods).
The off power specification in figures 6.2 and 6.3 is as defined in 6.5.1.1.
The average on power specification in figures 6.2 and 6.3 depends on each
possible case.
\- First preamble of RACH: Open loop accuracy (Table 6.3).
\- During preamble ramping of the RACH, and between final RACH preamble and
RACH message part: Accuracy depending on size of the required power difference
(Table 6.7). The step in total transmitted power between final RACH preamble
and RACH message (control part + data part) shall be rounded to the closest
integer dB value. A power step exactly half-way between two integer values
shall be rounded to the closest integer of greater magnitude.
\- After transmission gaps due to discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission:
Accuracy as defined in Table 6.7A. The uplink transmitter power difference
tolerance after a transmission gap of up to 10 sub-frames shall be within the
range as defined in Table 6.7A. The TPC_cmd value shown in Table 6.7A
corresponds to the last TPC_cmd value received before the transmission gap and
applied by the UE after the transmission gap when discontinuous uplink DPCCH
transmission is activated.
\- After transmission gaps in compressed mode: Accuracy as in Table 6.9.

### 6.5.3 Change of TFC
A change of TFC (Transport Format Combination) in uplink means that the power
in the uplink varies according to the change in data rate. DTX, where the
DPDCH is turned off, is a special case of variable data, which is used to
minimise the interference between UE(s) by reducing the UE transmit power when
voice, user or control information is not present.
#### 6.5.3.1 Minimum requirement
A change of output power is required when the TFC, and thereby the data rate,
is changed. The ratio of the amplitude between the DPDCH codes and the DPCCH
code will vary. The power step due to a change in TFC shall be calculated in
the UE so that the power transmitted on the DPCCH shall follow the inner loop
power control. The step in total transmitted power (DPCCH + DPDCH) shall then
be rounded to the closest integer dB value. A power step exactly half-way
between two integer values shall be rounded to the closest integer of greater
magnitude. The accuracy of the power step, given the step size, is specified
in Table 6.8. The power change due to a change in TFC is defined as the
relative power difference between the mean power of the original (reference)
timeslot and the mean power of the target timeslot, not including the
transient duration. The transient duration is from 25μs before the slot
boundary to 25μs after the slot boundary.

The mean power of successive slots shall be calculated according to Figure
6.4.
Figure 6.4: Transmit template during TFC change
### 6.5.4 Power setting in uplink compressed mode
Compressed mode in uplink means that the power in uplink is changed.
#### 6.5.4.1 Minimum requirement
A change of output power is required during uplink compressed frames since the
transmission of data is performed in a shorter interval. The ratio of the
amplitude between the DPDCH codes and the DPCCH code will also vary. The power
step due to compressed mode shall be calculated in the UE so that the energy
transmitted on the pilot bits during each transmitted slot shall follow the
inner loop power control.
Thereby, the power during compressed mode, and immediately afterwards, shall
be such that the mean power of the DPCCH follows the steps due to inner loop
power control combined with additional steps of 10Log~10~(N~pilot.prev~ /
N~pilot.curr~) dB where N~pilot.prev~ is the number of pilot bits in the
previously transmitted slot, and N~pilot.curr~ is the current number of pilot
bits per slot.
The resulting step in total transmitted power (DPCCH +DPDCH) shall then be
rounded to the closest integer dB value. A power step exactly half-way between
two integer values shall be rounded to the closest integer of greatest
magnitude. The accuracy of the power step, given the step size, is specified
in Table 6.8 in subclause 6.5.3.1. The power step is defined as the relative
power difference between the mean power of the original (reference) timeslot
and the mean power of the target timeslot, when neither the original timeslot
nor the reference timeslot are in a transmission gap. The transient duration
is not included, and is from 25μs before the slot boundary to 25μs after the
slot boundary.
In addition to any power change due to the ratio N~pilot.prev~ /
N~pilot.curr~, the mean power of the DPCCH in the first slot after a
compressed mode transmission gap shall differ from the mean power of the DPCCH
in the last slot before the transmission gap by an amount Δ~RESUME~, where
Δ~RESUME~ is calculated as described in clause 5.1.2.3 of TS 25.214.
The resulting difference in the total transmitted power (DPCCH + DPDCH) shall
then be rounded to the closest integer dB value. A power difference exactly
half-way between two integer values shall be rounded to the closest integer of
greatest magnitude. The accuracy of the resulting difference in the total
transmitted power (DPCCH + DPDCH) after a transmission gap of up to 14 slots
shall be as specified in Table 6.9.
Table 6.9: Transmitter power difference tolerance after a transmission gap of
up to 14 slots
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Power difference (Up or down) | Transmitter power step tolerance | | | after a transmission gap [dB] | | ∆P [dB] | | +-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Δ P ≤ 2 | +/- 3 | +-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | 3 | +/- 3 | +-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | 4 ≤ Δ P ≤10 | +/- 3.5 | +-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | 11 ≤ Δ P ≤15 | +/- 4 | +-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | 16 ≤ Δ P ≤20 | +/- 4.5 | +-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | 21 ≤ Δ P | +/- 6.5 | +-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
The power difference is defined as the difference between the mean power of
the original (reference) timeslot before the transmission gap and the mean
power of the target timeslot after the transmission gap, not including the
transient durations. The transient durations at the start and end of the
transmission gaps are each from 25μs before the slot boundary to 25μs after
the slot boundary.
The mean power of successive slots shall be calculated according to figure
6.5.

The transmission of Ack/Nack or CQI over the HS-DPCCH may cause the
transmission power in the uplink to vary. The ratio of the amplitude between
the DPCCH and the Ack/Nack and CQI respectively is signalled by higher layers.
#### 6.5.5.1 Minimum requirement
The nominal sum power on DPCCH+DPDCH is independent of the transmission of
Ack/Nack and CQI unless the UE output power when Ack/Nack or CQI is
transmitted would exceed the maximum value specified in Table 6.1A or fall
below the value specified in 6.4.3.1, whereupon the UE shall apply additional
scaling to the total transmit power as defined in section 5.1.2.6 of TS.25.214
[8].
The composite transmitted power (DPCCH + DPDCH+HS-DPCCH) may then also be
rounded to the closest integer dB value. If rounding is done a power step
exactly half-way between two integer values shall be rounded to the closest
integer of greater magnitude.
The nominal power step due to transmission of Ack/Nack or CQI is defined as
the difference between the nominal mean powers of two power evaluation periods
either side of an HS-DPCCH boundary. The first evaluation period starts 25μs
after a DPCCH slot boundary and ends 25μs before the following HS-DPCCH slot
boundary. The second evaluation period starts 25μs after the same HS-DPCCH
slot boundary and ends 25μs before the following DPCCH slot boundary. This is
described graphically in figure 6.6.

The tolerance of the power step due to transmission of the HS-DPCCH shall meet
the requirements in table 6.9A. For each direction, up to 2 exceptions to the
transmitter power step tolerance defined in table 6.9A shall be allowed. The
transmitter power control range for exceptions is defined in table 6.9B.
Exceptions are applicable only if the change in UL power is measured per 1-dB
step size.

## 6.6 Output RF spectrum emissions
### 6.6.1 Occupied bandwidth
Occupied bandwidth is a measure of the bandwidth containing 99 % of the total
integrated power of the transmitted spectrum, centered on the assigned channel
frequency. The occupied channel bandwidth shall be less than 5 MHz based on a
chip rate of 3.84 Mcps.
### 6.6.1A Occupied bandwidth for DC-HSUPA
In the case dual adjacent carriers are assigned in the uplink, occupied
bandwidth is a measure of the bandwidth containing 99 % of the total
integrated power of the transmitted spectrum, centered at the center of the
assigned channel frequencies. The occupied channel bandwidth shall be less
than 10 MHz on a chip rate of 3.84 Mcps.
### 6.6.2 Out of band emission
Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the nominal
channel resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the
transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This out of band emission limit
is specified in terms of a spectrum emission mask and Adjacent Channel Leakage
power Ratio.
#### 6.6.2.1 Spectrum emission mask
The spectrum emission mask of the UE applies to frequencies, which are between
2.5 MHz and 12.5 MHz away from the UE centre carrier frequency. The out of
channel emission is specified relative to the RRC filtered mean power of the
UE carrier.
##### 6.6.2.1.1 Minimum requirement
The power of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in Table
6.10. The absolute requirement is based on a -50 dBm/3.84 MHz minimum power
threshold for the UE. This limit is expressed for the narrower measurement
bandwidths as -55.8 dBm/1 MHz and -71.1 dBm/30 kHz. The requirements are
applicable for all values of β~c~, β~d~, β~hs~, β~ec~ and β~ed~ as specified
in [8].

For operation in band II, IV, V, X, XII, XIII, XIV and XXV the minimum
requirement is calculated from the minimum requirement in table 6.10 or the

##### 6.8.3a.1.1a Additional requirement for DC-HSUPA
When 16QAM is not used on any of the UL code channels in a carrier, the
Relative Code Domain Error in that carrier shall meet the requirements in
Table 6.15B for the parameters specified in Table 6.15AA.
When 16QAM is used on any of the UL code channels in a carrier, the Relative
Code Domain Error of the codes not using 16QAM in that carrier shall meet the
requirements in Table 6.15C for the parameters specified in Table 6.15AA.
When 16QAM is used on any of the UL code channels in a carrier, the Nominal
CDP Ratio-weighted average of the Relative Code Domain Errors measured
individually on each of the codes using 16QAM in that carrier shall meet the
requirements in Table 6.15D for the parameters specified in Table 6.15AA.
For the purposes of evaluating the requirements specified in Table 6.15D, the
ECDP value is determined as the minimum of the individual ECDP values
corresponding to the codes using 16QAM.
The reference measurement channels for the requirements in subclause
6.8.3a.1.1a are provided in subclause A.2.6 and A.2.7.
### 6.8.3b In-band emission for DC-HSUPA
The in-band emission is measured as the ratio of the UE output power in one
carrier in dual cells to the UE output power in the other carrier, where the
power in the former carrier shall be set to the minimum output power and the
power in the latter carrier to the maximum output power. The reference
measurement channel for the requirements in subclause 6.8.3b.1 is provided in
subclause A.2.6 with an adjusted power imbalance to set the power in one
carrier to the minimum output power and the power in the other carrier to the
maximum output power. The basic in-band emission measurement interval is
defined over one slot in the time domain.
#### 6.8.3b.1 Minimum requirement for DC-HSUPA
The in-band emission shall not exceed the value specified in Table 6.15E.
Table 6.15E: In-band emission minimum requirements for DC-HSUPA
* * *
Parameter Description Unit Limit In-band emission dBc -24 Note : The
measurement bandwidth is 3.84 MHz centered on each carrier frequency and the
limit is expressed as a ratio of RRC filtered mean power in one carrier,
transmitting at minimum output power, to the RRC filtered mean power in the
other carrier, transmitting at maximum output power.
* * *
### 6.8.4 Phase discontinuity for uplink DPCH
Phase discontinuity is the change in phase between any two adjacent timeslots.
The EVM for each timeslot (excluding the transient periods of 25 μs on either
side of the nominal timeslot boundaries), shall be measured according to
subclause 6.8.2. The frequency, absolute phase, absolute amplitude and chip
clock timing used to minimise the error vector are chosen independently for
each timeslot. The phase discontinuity result is defined as the difference
between the absolute phase used to calculate EVM for the preceding timeslot,
and the absolute phase used to calculate EVM for the succeeding timeslot.
#### 6.8.4.1 Minimum requirement
The rate of occurrence of any phase discontinuity on an uplink DPCH for the
parameters specified in table 6.16 shall not exceed the values specified in
table 6.17. Phase shifts that are caused by changes of the UL transport format
combination (TFC), compressed mode and HS-DPCCH are not included. When
calculating the phase discontinuity, the requirements for frequency error and
EVM in subclauses 6.3 and 6.8.2 for each timeslot shall be met.

### 6.8.5 Phase discontinuity for HS-DPCCH
Phase discontinuity for HS-DPCCH is the change in phase due to the
transmission of the HS-DPCCH. In the case where the HS-DPCCH timeslot is
offset from the DPCCH timeslot, the period of evaluation of the phase
discontinuity shall be the DPCCH timeslot that contains the HS-DPCCH slot
boundary. The phase discontinuity for HS-DPCCH result is defined as the
difference between the absolute phase used to calculate the EVM for that part
of the DPCCH timeslot prior to the HS-DPCCH slot boundary, and the absolute
phase used to calculate the EVM for remaining part of the DPCCH timeslot
following the HS-DPCCH slot boundary. In all cases the subslot EVM is measured
excluding the transient periods of 25 μs.
Since subslot EVM is only defined for intervals of at least one half timeslot,
the phase discontinuity for HS-DPCCH is only defined for non-aligned timeslots
when the offset is 0.5 slots.
#### 6.8.5.1 Minimum requirement
The phase discontinuity for HS-DPCCH shall not exceed the value specified in
table 6.18 90% of the time. When calculating the phase discontinuity, the
requirements for frequency error and EVM in sub clauses 6.3 and 6.8.2,
respectively shall be met.

### 6.8.6 Phase discontinuity for E-DCH
Phase discontinuity for E-DCH is the change in phase due to the transmission
of DPCCH, HS-DPCCH, E-DPCCH and E-DCH with the combined transmit power profile
as defined in Table 6.19. The phase discontinuity for E-DCH result is defined
as the difference between the absolute phase used to calculate the EVM for the
preceding timeslot, and the absolute phase used to calculate the EVM for the
succeeding timeslot.

phase discontinuity for E-DCH shall not exceed the value specified in table
6.20 for the specified amount of time in table 6.20. The requirement applies

#### 6.8.7.1 Minimum requirement
The time alignment error shall not exceed ¾ Tc.
# 7 Receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
Unless otherwise stated the receiver characteristics are specified at the
antenna connector of the UE. For UE(s) with an integral antenna only, a
reference antenna with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed. UE with an integral antenna
may be taken into account by converting these power levels into field strength
requirements, assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna. For UEs with more than one
receiver antenna connector the AWGN signals applied to each receiver antenna
connector shall be uncorrelated. The levels of the test signal applied to each
of the antenna connectors shall be as defined in the respective sections
below.
The UE antenna performance has a significant impact on system performance, and
minimum requirements on the antenna efficiency are therefore intended to be
included in future versions of the present document. It is recognised that
different requirements and test methods are likely to be required for the
different types of UE.
UEs supporting DC-HSDPA, regardless of MIMO configuration, shall support both
minimum requirements, as well as additional requirements for DC-HSDPA.
UEs supporting DB-DC-HSDPA shall support both minimum requirements as well as
additional requirements for DB-DC-HSDPA.
UEs supporting DC-HSUPA shall support both minimum requirements, as well as
additional requirements for DC-HSUPA.
UEs supporting single band 4C-HSDPA shall support minimum requirements,
additional requirements for DC-HSDPA as well as additional requirements for
single band 4C-HSDPA.
UEs supporting dual band 4C-HSDPA shall support minimum requirements,
additional requirements for DC-HSDPA, additional requirements for DB-DC-HSDPA
as well as additional requirements for dual band 4C-HSDPA.
For minimum requirements, all the parameters in clause 7 are defined using the
DL reference measurement channel (12.2 kbps) specified in subclause A.3.1 and
unless otherwise stated with DL power control OFF.
For the additional requirements for DC-HSDPA, DB-DC-HSDPA, DC-HSUPAor single
band/dual band 4C-HSDPA, all the parameters in clause 7 are defined using the
DL reference measurement channel H-Set 12, specified in subclause A.7.1.12 and
the downlink physical channel setup according to table C.12C.
For the additional requirements for DC-HSDPA, the spacing of the carrier
frequencies of the two cells in downlink shall be 5 MHz, and it is assumed
that the UE is configured with a single uplink carrier frequency.
For the additional requirements for DC-HSUPA, the spacing of the carrier
frequencies of the two cells in both downlink and uplink shall be 5 MHz.
For the additional requirements for single band/dual band 4C-HSDPA, the
spacing of the adjacent carrier frequencies in downlink and uplink shall be 5
MHz.
For each single band/dual band 4C-HSDPA configuration, the UL-DL carrier
separation is defined as minimum (maximum) when the UL carrier is placed at
minimum (maximum) possible distance in frequency from the closest carrier in
the corresponding DL band for which the requirement applies.
The requirements specified in Section 7 in general could be different for each
single band/dual band 4C-HSDPA configuration within the same operating
band(s).
## 7.2 Diversity characteristics
A suitable receiver structure using coherent reception in both channel impulse
response estimation and code tracking procedures is assumed. Three forms of
diversity are considered to be available in UTRA/FDD.
Table 7.1: Diversity characteristics for UTRA/FDD

Multi-path diversity Rake receiver or other suitable receiver structure with
maximum combining. Additional processing elements can increase the delay-
spread performance due to increased capture of signal energy. Antenna

optionally in the UE. Possibility for downlink transmit diversity in the Node
B.

## 7.3 Reference sensitivity level
The reference sensitivity level \ is the minimum mean power received
at the UE antenna port at which the specified minimum requirement shall be
met.

## 7.5 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)
Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) is a measure of a receiver's ability to
receive a W-CDMA signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the centre
frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the receive filter
attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the receive filter
attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).
### 7.5.1 Minimum requirement
The UE shall fulfill the minimum requirement specified in Table 7.4 for all
values of an adjacent channel interferer up to -25 dBm.
However it is not possible to directly measure the ACS, instead the lower and
upper range of test parameters are chosen in Table 7.5 where the BER shall not
exceed 0.001.

## 7.6 Blocking characteristics
The blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver's ability to receive
a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an
unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of the spurious response
or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted input signal causing a
degradation of the performance of the receiver beyond a specified limit. The
blocking performance shall apply at all frequencies except those at which a
spurious response occur.
### 7.6.1 Minimum requirement (In-band blocking)
The BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the parameters specified in Table 7.6. In-
band blocking is defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling into the
UE receive band or into the first 15 MHz below or above the UE receive band.

### 7.6.2D Additional requirement for dual band 4C-HSDPA (Out-of-band
blocking)
The BLER measured on each individual cell shall not exceed 0.1 for the
parameters specified in Table 7.7AE and Table 7.7AF. Out-of-band blocking is
defined for an unwanted interfering signal falling at frequencies outside of
frequency regions defined as the UE receive bands extended by 15 MHz at their
lower and upper ends. The requirement is not applicable for dual uplink
operation.
For Table 7.7AF in frequency range 1, 2 and 3, up to 24 exceptions per
received cell are allowed for spurious response frequencies in each assigned
frequency channel when measured using a 1 MHz step size. For these exceptions
the requirements of clause 7.7 Spurious response are applicable.
For Table 7.7AF in frequency range 4, up to 8 exceptions per received cell are
allowed for spurious response frequencies in each assigned frequency channel
when measured using a 1 MHz step size. For these exceptions the requirements
of clause 7.7 Spurious response are applicable.

The bit error rate characteristics of UE is determined during an inter-cell
soft handover. During the soft handover a UE receives signals from different
cells. A UE has to be able to demodulate two PCCPCH channels and to combine
the energy of DCH channels. Delay profiles of signals received from different
cells are assumed to be the same but time shifted by 10 chips.
The receive characteristics of the different channels during inter-cell
handover are determined by the average Block Error Ratio (BLER) values.

sets
#### 8.7.2.1 Minimum requirement
Test parameters are specified in Table 8.27. The delay profiles of the signals
received from the different cells are the same but time-shifted by 10 chips.
For Test 1, the sequence of uplink power changes between adjacent slots shall
be as shown in Table 8.28 over the 4 consecutive slots more than 99% of the
time. Note that this case is without an additional noise source I~oc~.
For Test 2, the Cell1 and Cell2 TPC patterns are repeated a number of times.
If the transmitted power of a given slot is increased compared to the previous
slot, then a variable \"Transmitted power UP\" is increased by one, otherwise
a variable \"Transmitted power DOWN\" is increased by one. The requirements
for \"Transmitted power UP\" and \"Transmitted power DOWN\" are shown in Table

### 8.7.3 Combining of reliable TPC commands from radio links of different
radio link sets
#### 8.7.3.1 Minimum requirement
Test 1 verifies that the UE follows only the reliable TPC commands in soft
handover. Test 2 verifies that the UE follows all the reliable TPC commands in
soft handover.
Test parameters are specified in Table 8.28B. Before the start of the tests,
the UE transmit power shall be initialised to -15 dBm. An actual UE transmit
power may vary from the target level of -15 dBm due to inaccurate UE output
power step.
During tests 1 and 2 the UE transmit power samples, which are defined as the
mean power over one timeslot, shall stay 90% of the time within the range
defined in Table 8.28C.

## 8.8 Power control in downlink
Power control in the downlink is the ability of the UE receiver to converge to
required link quality set by the network while using as low power as possible
in downlink . If a BLER target has been assigned to a DCCH (See Annex A.3),
then it has to be such that outer loop is based on DTCH and not on DCCH.
The requirements in this subclause were derived with the assumption that the
UTRAN responds immediately to the uplink TPC commands by adjusting the power
of the first pilot field of the DL DPCCH that commences after end of the
received TPC command.
### 8.8.1 Power control in the downlink, constant BLER target
#### 8.8.1.1 Minimum requirements
For the parameters specified in Table 8.29 the downlink {width="0.625in"
height="0.30694444444444446in"} power ratio measured values, which are
averaged over one slot, shall be below the specified value in Table 8.30 more
than 90% of the time. BLER shall be as shown in Table 8.30. If the UE supports
optional enhanced performance requirements type1 for DCH then for the
parameters specified in Table 8.30A the downlink {width="0.625in"
height="0.30694444444444446in"} power ratio measured values, which are
averaged over one slot, shall be below the specified value in Table 8.30B more
than 90% of the time. BLER shall be as shown in Table 8.30B and Test 2 shall
be replaced by Test 2a. Power control in downlink is ON during the test.

### 8.8.2 Power control in the downlink, initial convergence
This requirement verifies that DL power control works properly during the
first seconds after DPCH connection is established
#### 8.8.2.1 Minimum requirements
For the parameters specified in Table 8.31 the downlink DPCH_Ec/Ior power
ratio measured values, which are averaged over 50 ms, shall be within the
range specified in Table 8.32 more than 90% of the time. For UE supporting the
enhanced performance requirements type1 for DCH with the parameters specified
in Table 8.32A the downlink DPCH_Ec/Ior power ratio measured values, which are
averaged over 50 ms, shall be within the range specified in Table 8.32B more
than 90% of the time. T1 equals to 500 ms and it starts 10 ms after the DPDCH
physical channel is considered established and the first uplink frame is
transmitted. T2 equals to 500 ms and it starts when T1 has expired. Power
control is ON during the test. If the UE supports optional enhanced
performance requirements type1 for DCH, Test 1, Test 2, Test 3 and Test 4
shall be replaced by Test 1a, Test 2a, Test 3a and Test 4a.
The first 10 ms shall not be used for averaging, ie the first sample to be
input to the averaging filter is at the beginning of T1. The averaging shall
be performed with a sliding rectangular window averaging filter. The window
size of the averaging filter is linearly increased from 0 up to 50 ms during
the first 50 ms of T1, and then kept equal to 50ms.

## 8.9 Downlink compressed mode
Downlink compressed mode is used to create gaps in the downlink transmission,
to allow the UE to make measurements on other frequencies.
The requirements in this subclause were derived with the assumption that the
UTRAN responds immediately to the uplink TPC commands by adjusting the power
of the first pilot field of the DL DPCCH that commences after end of the
received TPC command.
### 8.9.1 Single link performance
The receiver single link performance of the Dedicated Traffic Channel (DCH) in
compressed mode is determined by the Block Error Ratio (BLER) and transmitted
DPCH_Ec/Ior power ratio in the downlink.
The compressed mode parameters are given in clause A.5.
#### 8.9.1.1 Minimum requirements
For the parameters specified in Table 8.35 the downlink {width="0.625in"
height="0.30694444444444446in"} power ratio measured values, which are
averaged over one slot, shall be below the specified value in Table 8.36 more

During the Fixed Reference Channel tests the behaviour of the Node-B emulator
in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the HS-DPCCH is specified in
Table 9.1A:
Table 9.1A: Node-B Emulator Behaviour in response to ACK/NACK/DTX
* * *
HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK Field State Node-B Emulator Behaviour ACK ACK: new
transmission using 1^st^ redundancy and constellation version (RV) NACK NACK:
retransmission using the next RV (up to the maximum permitted number or RV's)
DTX DTX: retransmission using the RV previously transmitted to the same H-ARQ
process
* * *
NOTE: Performance requirements in this section assume a sufficient power
allocation to HS-SCCH_1 so that probability of reporting DTX is very low.
### 9.2.1 Single Link performance
The receiver single link performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in different multi-path fading environments are
determined by the information bit throughput R
#### 9.2.1.1 Requirement QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set
1/2/3/3A/3B/3C
The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 1/2/3/3A/3A/3B (QPSK version)
specified in Annex A.7.1.1, A.7.1.2 and A.7.1.3 respectively, with the
addition of the parameters in Table 9.2 and the downlink physical channel
setup according to table C.8.
Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum

### 9.2.4 MIMO Performance
The MIMO performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-
DSCH) in multi-path fading environments is determined by the information bit
throughput R.
#### 9.2.4.1 Requirement Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 9/9A/9B/9C
The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 9/9A/9B/9C specified in Annex
A.7.1.9, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.22E1 and the downlink
physical channel setup according to Table C.9 and Table C.12D. Precoding
weight set restriction shall not be enabled.
The primary precoding vector signalled on the HS-SCCH and applied on the
associated HS-DSCH subframe shall correspond to the preferred primary
precoding vector reported immediately before the start of the HS-SCCH
subframe.
The determination of applied precoding vector for single transport block
transmission shall be as follows: the reported preferred primary precoding
vector shall be applied to the primary transport block.
The determination of applied precoding vector for two transport block
transmission shall be as follows: If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a
preference for a single transport block, the preferred primary precoding
vector shall be applied to the primary transport block. If the CQI reported by
the UE indicates a preference for two transport blocks, and the preferred
primary precoding vector corresponds to the highest reported CQI value, the
preferred primary precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport
block. If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a preference for two transport
blocks, and the preferred primary precoding vector does not correspond to the
highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding vector shall be
applied to the secondary transport block.
Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in Table 9.22E2 with the downlink physical channel
setup in Table C.9, and the minimum requirements specified in Table 9.22E3
with the downlink physical channel setup in Table C.12D.

The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-Set 11/11A/11B/11C specified in
Annex A.7.1.11, with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.22F1 and the
downlink physical channel setup according to Table C.9 and Table C.12D.

vector shall be applied to the primary transport block. If the CQI reported by
the UE indicates a preference for two transport blocks, and the preferred
primary precoding vector corresponds to the highest reported CQI value, the
preferred primary precoding vector shall be applied to the primary transport
block. If the CQI reported by the UE indicates a preference for two transport
blocks, and the preferred primary precoding vector does not correspond to the
highest reported CQI value, the preferred primary precoding vector shall be
applied to the secondary transport block.
Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum

## 9.3 Reporting of Channel Quality Indicator
The propagation conditions for this subclause are defined in table B.1C for
non-MIMO operation under fading conditions, in subclause B.2.6.1 for MIMO
operation under single stream conditions, and in subclause B.2.6.2 for MIMO
operation under dual stream conditions.
For the cases in this subclause where CQI reporting is evaluated under fading
conditions or under MIMO single/dual stream conditions it is expected that the
UE will not always detect the HS-SCCH, resulting in a DTX for the uplink
ACK/NACK transmission. The downlink configuration for evaluating CQI
performance does not use retransmission. Therefore any BLER calculations must
exclude any packets where the UE may have attempted to combine data from more
than one transmission due to having missed one or more new data indicators or
initial transmissions in MIMO operation from lost HS-SCCH transmissions.
For the requirements for UEs supporting HS-DSCH categories 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32, when the carriers are located in the same
frequency band, the spacing of the carrier frequencies of the two cells shall
be 5 MHz.
### 9.3.1 Single Link Performance
#### 9.3.1.1 AWGN propagation conditions
The reporting accuracy of channel quality indicator (CQI) under AWGN
environments is determined by the reporting variance and the BLER performance
using the transport format indicated by the reported CQI median.
##### 9.3.1.1.1 Minimum Requirement -- UE HS-DSCH categories 1-20
For the parameters specified in Table 9.23, and using the downlink physical
channels specified in table C.8, the reported CQI value shall be in the range
of +/-2 of the reported median more than 90% of the time. If the HS-PDSCH BLER
using the transport format indicated by median CQI is less than or equal to
0.1, the BLER using the transport format indicated by the (median CQI +2)
shall be greater than 0.1. If the HS-PDSCH BLER using the transport format
indicated by the median CQI is greater than 0.1, the BLER using transport
format indicated by (median CQI -1) shall be less than or equal to 0.1.

For the parameters specified in Table 9.26, and using the downlink physical
channels specified in table C.8, with a serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary
serving HS-DSCH cell(s) configured, for each of the serving cells, the
requirements are specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported

#### 9.3.1.3 Periodically varying radio conditions.
The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) when subject to
AWGN propagation conditions with periodically varying , is determined by the
reporting variance as measured during selected parts of a predetermined
pattern, as depicted in Figure 9.1.
Figure 9.1 Test scenario for CQI reporting test under varying interference
conditions. is varied between α1 and α2 according to a predetermined square
wave pattern.
##### 9.3.1.3.1 Minimum Requirement -- UE HS-DSCH categories 1-20
For the parameters specified in Table 9.27C, and using the downlink physical
channels specified in table C.8, let M~1~ be defined as the median CQI that
the UE reports in static propagation conditions, with Ior/Ioc set to α~1~, and
M~2~ be the median CQI that the UE reports in static propagation conditions,
with set to α~2~. The minimum difference between M~1~ and M~2~ is required to
be larger than 6.

The measurement equipment is allowed to start the ramping of 13 slots before
the start of the HS-DPCCH slot that contains the first CQI report in
T~measure~.
The measurement equipment shall have settled to its nominal value 10 slots
before the start of the HS-DPCCH slot that contains the first CQI report in
T~measure~.
An illustration of these timing relations is provided in Figure 9.2.

#### 9.3.3.3 Periodically varying radio conditions.
The reporting accuracy of the channel quality indicator (CQI) when subject to
AWGN propagation conditions with periodically varying , is determined by the
reporting variance as measured during selected parts of a predetermined
pattern, as depicted in Figure 9.1.
##### 9.3.3.3.1 Minimum Requirement -- UE HS-DSCH categories 1-20
For the parameters specified in Table 9.45A, and using the downlink physical
channels specified in table C.10, let M~1~ be defined as the median CQI that
the UE reports in static propagation conditions, with Ior/Ioc set to α~1~, and
M~2~ be the median CQI that the UE reports in static propagation conditions,
with set to α~2~. The minimum difference between M~1~ and M~2~ is required to
be larger than 6.
For the parameters specified in Table 9.45A, and using the downlink physical
channels specified in table C.10, 90% of the reported CQI values, during
T~measure~ as depicted in Figure 9.1, shall be in the range of +/-3 of M1, for
the cases when T~measure~ occurs during time-periods where is set to α~1,~ and
in the range of +/-3 of M2, for the cases when T~measure~ occurs during time-
periods where is set to α~2~ .
The measurement equipment is allowed to start the ramping of 13 slots before
the start of the HS-DPCCH slot that contains the first CQI report in
T~measure~.
The measurement equipment shall have settled to its nominal value 10 slots
before the start of the HS-DPCCH slot that contains the first CQI report in
T~measure~.
An illustration of these timing relations is provided in Figure 9.2.

### 9.3.4 MIMO Performance
#### 9.3.4.1 MIMO Single Stream Fading Conditions
The minimum performance requirements of channel quality indicator (CQI)
reporting under MIMO single stream conditions are defined based on a CQI Type
A versus Type B reporting ratio of 1 / 2, i.e. the parameters _N_ _cqi_typeA
and _M_ _cqi (see [8]) are assumed to be set to 1 and 2, respectively. The
propagation conditions assumed for minimum performance requirements of CQI
reporting under MIMO single stream conditions are defined in subclause
B.2.6.1. The precoding used at the transmitter is one randomly picked but
fixed precoding vector for single transport block transmission out of the set
of possible precoding vectors as defined in [8]. The same precoding vector
shall be used to generate the resulting channel coefficients as described for
MIMO single stream conditions in subclause B.2.6.1.
The reporting accuracy of CQI under MIMO single stream conditions is
determined by the BLER performance when transmitting with a transport format
indicated by the reported CQI median determined over all single transport
block Type A CQI reports and all Type B CQI reports that were reported
together with PCI reports matching the precoding vector embedded in the
propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.1.
##### 9.3.4.1.1 Minimum Requirement - UE HS-DSCH categories 15-20
For the parameters specified in Table 9.46, and using the downlink physical
channels specified in Table C.9 and Table C.12D, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs when
transmitting a fixed transport format given by the CQI median as shown in
Table 9.47. The CQI median shall be determined over all single transport block
Type A CQI reports and all Type B CQI reports that were reported together with
PCI reports matching the precoding vector embedded in the propagation channel
as defined in subclause B.2.6.1. The BLER at a particular reported CQI is
obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement period for all
single transport block Type A CQI reports and all Type B CQI reports that were
reported together with PCI reports matching the precoding vector embedded in
the propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.1with the HS-PDSCH
subframe overlapping with the end of this CQI reference measurement period and
calculating the fraction of erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes to which the same CQI
value was associated.

With a serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cell(s) configured,
using the parameters specified in Table 9.47A, and using the downlink physical
channels specified in Table C.9 and Table C.12D, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs when
transmitting a fixed transport format given by the cell-specific CQI median as
shown in Table 9.47B. The requirement is applicable for each cell
individually, that is the median reported CQI, as well as corresponding BLERs,
are to be separately determined for each cell and independently verified
against the requirement in Table 9.47B. The cell-specific CQI median shall be
determined over all single transport block Type A CQI reports and all Type B
CQI reports that were reported together with PCI reports matching the

#### 9.3.4.2 MIMO Dual Stream Fading Conditions
The minimum performance requirements of channel quality indicator (CQI)
reporting under MIMO dual stream conditions are defined based on a Type A
reporting fraction of 100%, i.e. the parameters _N_ _cqi_typeA and _M_ _cqi
(see [8]) are assumed to be both set to 1. The propagation conditions assumed
for minimum performance requirements of CQI reporting under MIMO dual stream
conditions are defined in subclause B.2.6.2. The precoding used at the
transmitter is one randomly picked but fixed precoding matrix for dual
transport block transmission out of the set of possible precoding matrices as
defined in [8]. The same precoding matrix shall be used to generate the
resulting channel coefficients as described for MIMO dual stream conditions in
subclause B.2.6.2.
The reporting accuracy of CQI under MIMO dual stream conditions is determined
by the BLER performance of two streams of transport blocks using the transport
formats indicated by the respective stream specific reported CQI median over
all dual transport block CQI reports for each stream that were reported
together with PCI reports matching the precoding matrix embedded in the
propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.2.
##### 9.3.4.2.1 Minimum Requirement -- UE HS-DSCH categories 15-20
For the parameters specified in Table 9.48, and using the downlink physical
channels specified in Table C.9 and Table C.12D, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs for each
stream when transmitting a fixed transport format per stream given by the
stream specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.49. The stream specific CQI
median shall be determined over all dual transport block CQI reports that were
reported together with PCI reports matching the precoding matrix embedded in
the propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.2. When the reported
preferred primary precoding vector is matching with the first column of the
precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause
B.2.6.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used respectively to
determine the median CQI values for stream #1 and stream #2 as depicted in
Figure B.5 in subclause B.2.6.2. When the reported preferred primary precoding
vector is matching with the second column of the precoding matrix embedded in
the propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.2, the reported values
CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used to determine the median CQI values for stream
#2 and stream #1, respectively.The stream specific BLER at a particular
reported CQI is obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement
period for all dual transport block CQI reports that were reported together
with a PCI report that was matching the precoding matrix embedded in the
propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.2 with the two transport
blocks of the HS-PDSCH subframe overlapping with the end of this CQI reference
measurement period and calculating the fractions of erroneous HS-PDSCH

##### 9.3.4.2.2 Minimum Requirement -- UE HS-DSCH categories 19-20
For the parameters specified in Table 9.49A, and using the downlink physical
channels specified in table C.9 and Table C.12D, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs for each
stream when transmitting a fixed transport format per stream given by the
stream specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.49B. The stream specific CQI
median shall be determined over all dual transport block CQI reports that were
reported together with PCI reports matching the precoding matrix embedded in
the propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.2. When the reported
preferred primary precoding vector is matching with the first column of the
precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined in subclause
B.2.6.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used respectively to
determine the median CQI values for stream #1 and stream #2 as depicted in
Figure B.5 in subclause B.2.6.2. When the reported preferred primary precoding
vector is matching with the second column of the precoding matrix embedded in
the propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.2, the reported values
CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used to determine the median CQI values for stream
#2 and stream #1, respectively.The stream specific BLER at a particular
reported CQI is obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement
period for all dual transport block CQI reports that were reported together
with a PCI report that was matching the precoding matrix embedded in the
propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.2 with the two transport
blocks of the HS-PDSCH subframe overlapping with the end of this CQI reference
measurement period and calculating the fractions of erroneous HS-PDSCH
subframes to which the same CQI values were associated.

With a serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cell(s) configured,
using the parameters specified in Table 9.49BA, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in Table C.9 and Table C.12D, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs for each
stream when transmitting a fixed transport format per stream given by the
stream specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.49BB. The requirement is
applicable for each cell and stream individually, that is the median reported
CQI, as well as corresponding BLERs, are to be separately determined for each
cell and stream, and independently verified against the requirement in Table
9.49BB. The stream and cell-specific CQI median shall be determined over all
dual transport block CQI reports that were reported together with PCI reports
matching the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined
in subclause B.2.6.2. When the reported preferred primary precoding vector is
matching with the first column of the precoding matrix embedded in the
propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.2, the reported values
CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used respectively to determine the median CQI
values for stream #1 and stream #2 as depicted in Figure B.5 in subclause
B.2.6.2. When the reported preferred primary precoding vector is matching with
the second column of the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel
as defined in subclause B.2.6.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall
be used to determine the median CQI values for stream #2 and stream #1,
respectively.The stream and cell-specific BLER at a particular reported CQI is
obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement period for all
dual transport block CQI reports that were reported together with a PCI report
that was matching the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as
defined in subclause B.2.6.2 with the two transport blocks of the HS-PDSCH
subframe overlapping with the end of this CQI reference measurement period and
calculating the fractions of erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes to which the same
CQI values were associated.

With a serving HS-DSCH cell and secondary serving HS-DSCH cell(s) configured,
using the parameters specified in Table 9.49BC, and using the downlink
physical channels specified in Table C.9 and Table C.12D, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs for each
stream when transmitting a fixed transport format per stream given by the
stream specific CQI median as shown in Table 9.49BD. The requirement is
applicable for each cell and stream individually, that is the median reported
CQI, as well as corresponding BLERs, are to be separately determined for each
cell and stream, and independently verified against the requirement in Table
9.49BB. The stream and cell-specific CQI median shall be determined over all
dual transport block CQI reports that were reported together with PCI reports
matching the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as defined
in subclause B.2.6.2. When the reported preferred primary precoding vector is
matching with the first column of the precoding matrix embedded in the
propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.2, the reported values
CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall be used respectively to determine the median CQI
values for stream #1 and stream #2 as depicted in Figure B.5 in subclause
B.2.6.2. When the reported preferred primary precoding vector is matching with
the second column of the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel
as defined in subclause B.2.6.2, the reported values CQI~1~ and CQI~2~ shall
be used to determine the median CQI values for stream #2 and stream #1,
respectively.The stream and cell-specific BLER at a particular reported CQI is
obtained by associating a particular CQI reference measurement period for all
dual transport block CQI reports that were reported together with a PCI report
that was matching the precoding matrix embedded in the propagation channel as
defined in subclause B.2.6.2 with the two transport blocks of the HS-PDSCH
subframe overlapping with the end of this CQI reference measurement period and
calculating the fractions of erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes to which the same
CQI values were associated.

(see [8]) are assumed to be both set to 1. The propagation conditions assumed
for minimum performance requirements of CQI reporting under MIMO dual stream
static orthogonal conditions are defined in subclause B.2.6.3.

### 9.3.5 MIMO only with single-stream restriction Performance
#### 9.3.5.1 MIMO only with single-stream restriction Fading Conditions
The propagation conditions assumed for minimum performance requirements of CQI
reporting under MIMO single stream conditions are defined in subclause
B.2.6.1. The precoding used at the transmitter is one randomly picked but
fixed precoding vector for single transport block transmission out of the set
of possible precoding vectors as defined in [8]. The same precoding vector
shall be used to generate the resulting channel coefficients as described for
MIMO single stream conditions in subclause B.2.6.1.
The reporting accuracy of CQI under MIMO with single-stream restriction is
determined by the BLER performance when transmitting with a transport format
indicated by the reported CQI median determined over all CQI reports that were
reported together with PCI reports matching the precoding vector embedded in
the propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.1.
##### 9.3.5.1.1 Minimum Requirement
For the parameters specified in Table 9.49E1, and using the downlink physical
channels specified in Table C.9 and Table C.12D, the requirements are
specified in terms of maximum BLERs at particular reported CQIs when
transmitting a fixed transport format given by the CQI median as shown in
Table 9.4E2. The CQI median shall be determined over all CQI reports that were
reported together with PCI reports matching the precoding vector embedded in
the propagation channel as defined in subclause B.2.6.1. The BLER at a
particular reported CQI is obtained by associating a particular CQI reference
measurement period for all Type B CQI reports that were reported together with
PCI reports matching the precoding vector embedded in the propagation channel
as defined in subclause B.2.6.1with the HS-PDSCH subframe overlapping with the
end of this CQI reference measurement period and calculating the fraction of
erroneous HS-PDSCH subframes to which the same CQI value was associated.

## 9.4 HS-SCCH Detection Performance
The detection performance of the HS-SCCH is determined by the probability of
event _E_ ~m~, which is declared when the UE is signaled on HS-SCCH-1, but DTX
is observed in the corresponding HS-DPCCH ACK/NACK field. The probability of
event _E_ ~m~ is denoted _P_(_E_ ~m~).
### 9.4.1 HS-SCCH Type 1 Single Link Performance

## 9.5 HS-SCCH-less demodulation of HS-DSCH (Fixed Reference Channel)
The receiver performance of the High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel
(HS-DSCH) with HS-SCCH-less operation in multi-path fading environment is
determined by the information bit throughput R.
The propagation conditions for this subclause are defined in table B.1C.
During the Fixed Reference Channel tests the behaviour of the Node-B emulator
in response to the ACK/NACK signalling field of the HS-DPCCH is specified in
Table 9.1A.
Performance requirements in this section assume sufficient power allocation to
HS-SCCH_1, so that the probability of detection failure, when the HS-SCCH-1
uses the identity of the UE under test, is very low.
### 9.5.1 Requirement QPSK, Fixed Reference Channel (FRC) H-Set 7
The requirements are specified in terms of a minimum information bit
throughput R for the DL reference channels H-set 7 specified in Annex A.7.1.7,
with the addition of the parameters in Table 9.58 and the downlink physical
channel setup according to table C.8.
Using this configuration the throughput shall meet or exceed the minimum
requirements specified in table 9.59. Enhanced performance requirements type 1
specified in Table 9.60 are based on receiver diversity.

# 10 Performance requirement (E-DCH)
## 10.1 General
The performance requirements for the UE in this subclause are specified for
the propagation conditions specified in Annex B.2.2 and the Downlink Physical
channels specified in Annex C.3.2.
Unless otherwise stated the receiver characteristics are specified at the
antenna connector of the UE. For UE(s) with an integral antenna only, a
reference antenna with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed. UE with an integral antenna
may be taken into account by converting these power levels into field strength
requirements, assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna. For UEs with more than one
receiver antenna connector the fading of the signals and the AWGN signals
applied to each receiver antenna connector shall be uncorrelated. The levels
of the test signal applied to each of the antenna connectors shall be as
defined in the respective sections below. Enhanced performance requirements
Type 1 are based on receiver diversity.
## 10.2 Detection of E-DCH HARQ ACK Indicator Channel (E-HICH)
### 10.2.1 Single link performance
The receive characteristics of the E-DCH HARQ ACK Indicator Channel (E-HICH)
in different multi-path fading environments are determined by the missed ACK
and false ACK values.

reference antenna with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed. UE with an integral antenna
may be taken into account by converting these power levels into field strength
requirements, assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna. For UEs with more than one
receiver antenna connector the fading of the signals and the AWGN signals
applied to each receiver antenna connector shall be uncorrelated. The levels
of the test signal applied to each of the antenna connectors shall be as
defined in the respective sections below.
## 11.1 Demodulation of MCCH
The receive characteristic of the MCCH is determined by the RLC SDU error rate
(RLC SDU ER). The requirement is valid for all RRC states for which the UE has

## C.5.2 OCNS Definition
The selected channelization codes and relative power levels for OCNS
transmission during for HSDPA performance assessment for other than enhanced
performance type 3i are defined in Table C.13. The selected codes are designed
to have a single length-16 parent code. The test definition for the enhanced
performance type 3i is defined in section C.5.3.

Note 1: The relative level setting specified in dB refers only to the
relationship between the OCNS channels. The level of the OCNS channels
relative to the Ior of the complete signal is a function of the power of the
other channels in the signal with the intention that the power of the group of
OCNS channels is used to make the total signal add up to 1.
## C.5.3 Test Definition for Enhanced Performance Type 3i
This section defines additional test definition for enhanced performance type
3i including: number of interfering cells and their respective powers;
transmitted code and power characteristics (OCNS) for serving and interfering
cells; and frame offsets for interfering cells. For DC-HSDPA, DB-DC-HSDPA and
4C-HSDPA requirements, the number of interfering cells and their respective
powers; transmitted code and power characteristics (OCNS) for serving and
interfering cells; and frame offsets for interfering cells shall be the same
for each carrier frequency. The transmitted OCNS and data signals shall be
independent for each cell.
DIPi = $\frac{{\hat{I}}_{\text{or}(i + 1)}}{I_{\text{oc}}}'$where _Î_ ~or _j_
~ is the average received power spectral density from the _j-_ th strongest
interfering cell (_Î_ ~or _1_ ~ is assumed to be the power spectral density
associated with the serving cell), and I~oc~' is given by$I_{\text{oc}}' =
\sum_{j = 2}^{3}{{\hat{I}}_{\text{orj}} + I_{\text{oc}}}$where Ioc is the
average power spectral density of a band limited white noise source consistent
with the definition provided in section 3.2.
### C.5.3.1 Transmitted code and power characteristics for serving cell
The downlink physical channel code allocations for the serving cell are
specified in Table C.14. Ten HS-PDSCH codes have been reserved for the user of
interest, based upon the use of QPSK with FRC H-Set 6. The other user codes
are selected from 46 possible SF = 128 codes. Note not all 46 of these codes
are used, and in addition only 16 codes are used at a given instance in time.
Table C.15 summarizes the power allocations of different channels for the
serving cell for 50% and 25% HS-PDSCH power allocation. Note the power
allocations in the last row of Table C.15 are to be split between the HS-SCCH
and the other users' channels in order to ensure proper operation of the HS-
SCCH during testing.
Table C.16 summarizes the channelization codes to be used for the other users
channels (OCNS) along with their respective relative power allocations in dB
when HS-PDSCH is allocated 25% or 50% of the total power. As shown in Table
C.16, there are two groups of 16 codes, which are randomly selected with equal
probability on a symbol-by-symbol basis. This random selection is done per
code pair, where a code pair occupies the same row, as opposed to selecting
all of the codes within group 1 or group 2. This random selection between
these two groups is for purposes of modelling a simplified form of DTX. Note
that the switching time for the symbols with SF = 64 would be the symbol
timing associated with an SF 64 channel, and the switching time for the
symbols with SF = 128 would be the symbol timing for SF = 128 channel. Thus,
there would be two different symbol times dependent upon the SF. For SF = 64,
symbol time \~ 16.67 microseconds, and for SF = 128, symbol time \~ 33.33
microseconds. Each of these users is also power controlled as described in
section C.5.3.3.
The scrambling code of the serving cell is set to 0.

Note: The relative level settings specified in dB refer only to the
relationship between the OCNS channels. For the serving cell, the sum of the
powers of the OCNS channels plus the power allocated to the HS-SCCH must add
up to the values specified in the last row of Table C.15. For the interfering
cells, the sum of the powers of the OCNS channels must add up to the value
shown in the last row of Table C.17.
### C.5.3.2 Transmitted code and power characteristics for interfering cells
The downlink physical channel code allocations for the interfering cells are
same as for the serving cell as given in Table C.14. The modelling approach
for the interfering cells is summarized in Table C.17. The modelling of the
other users' dedicated channels is done in the same way as in the case of the
serving cell except that the HSDPA power allocation is fixed at 50% and the
total power allocated is not shared with the HS-SCCH. Thus, the two groups of
channelization codes defined in Table C.16 apply, along with the specified
relative power levels.

> Note: The values given in decibel are only for information.
The HS-PDSCH transmission for interfering cells is modelled to have randomly
varying modulation and number of codes. The predefined modulation and number
of codes are given in Table C.18, with the actual codes selected per the code
allocation given in Table C.14. The transmission from each interfering cell is
randomly and independently selected every HSDPA TTI among the four options
given in Table C.18.
The scrambling codes of the interfering cells are set to 16 and 32,
respectively. The frame offsets for the interfering cells are set to 1296 and
2576 chips relative to the serving cell. The scrambling code value of 16 and

### C.5.3.3 Model for power control sequence generation
In this section the modelling of power control for the other users' channels
is described. There are two powers that are calculated for each user, I at
each slot, n. The first is an interim power calculation, which develops a
power $P_{n}^{i}$ in dB. The second is the actual applied transmit power,
${\hat{P}}_{n}^{i}$ in the linear domain, which is normalized such that the
total power for all users remains the same as that originally allocated. The
interim power calculation is described first followed by the applied,
normalized power calculation.
The interim power is varied randomly, either by increasing or decreasing it by
1 dB steps in each slot, i.e.
$P_{n}^{i} = P_{n - 1}^{i} + \Delta$, where $\Delta \in \left{ - 1, + 1
\right}$ (EQ.C.5.3.3.1)
The probability of ∆ having a value of +1 for the _i_ ^th^ user at time
instant _n_ can be determined as
$\text{Pr}_{n}^{i}(\Delta\text{=+}1) = 0\text{.}5 - (P_{n - 1}^{i} -
P_{0}^{i})\frac{0\text{.}5}{L}$ **(EQ.C.5.3.3.2)**
where, $P_{n - 1}^{i}$ is the interim power at time instant _n_ -1 and
$P_{0}^{i}$ is the initial value given in Table C.16 after conversion to dB
for each of the two possible HS-PDSCH power allocations. _L_ is a scaling
factor which can be used to determine the range to which the variation of
power is confined. The value of _L_ is set to 10, leading to a variance of \~5
dB.
The applied, normalized power is given by
${\hat{P}}_{n}^{i} =
\frac{P_{\text{lin},n}^{i}}{\sum_{i}^{}P_{\text{lin},n}^{i}}\sum_{i}^{}P_{\text{lin},0}^{i}$
(EQ.C.5.3.3.3)
where is the interim power of the user I at time instant n in the linear
domain, and is the initial value of the i^th^ user's power also in the linear
domain. Each summation is over all 16 possible values for and where the latter
summation is equal to either 0.5551 or 0.3049 for HS-PDSCH allocations of 25%
and 50%, respectively, see Table C.16. The total instantaneous output power of
the OCNS is now always equal to its allocated power. One other subtle point to
note is that at each iteration of interim power generation using
(EQ.C.5.3.3.1) that the value of$P_{n - 1}^{i}$ is set to $P_{n}^{i}$of the
previous iteration as opposed to ${\hat{P}}_{n}^{i}$of the previous iteration.
In summary, two sets of power control sequences are developed using
(EQ.C.5.3.3.1) and (EQ.C.5.3.3.3), respectively, where the interim outputs
developed by (C.1) are used to develop the applied, normalized values
described by (EQ.C.5.3.3.3) and to which the actual channel powers are set.
## C.5.4 Simplified Multi Carrier HSDPA testing method
For DC-HSDPA, DB-DC-HSDPA or 4C-HSDPA tests which require more than 8
independent faders, the resulting propagation channel(s) shall be generated by
considering a number of independent faders needed for one carrier and
connecting them to the signal of randomly chosen carrier(s). The maximum
number of channel faders on the test will be less than or equal to 8. The
remaining carrier(s) shall be connected without a channel fader but with AWGN.
The throughput shall be collected only for the carrier(s) connected to channel
faders.
The test shall be repeated by choosing carrier(s) excluding already chosen
carrier(s) until all the carrier(s) are tested under fading conditions. The
sum of all the collected throughputs from each carrier shall be compared
against the reference value in the requirements.
All supported carriers shall be configured and activated during the test.

###### ## Annex E (informative): UARFCN numbers
# E.1 General
This Annex lists the UARFCN numbers used for the frequency bands implemented
in the current specification.
# E.2 List of UARFCN used for UTRA FDD bands
The UARFCN numbering scheme detailed in clauses 5.4.3 and 5.4.4 of this
specification is summarized for information in Table E.1. The table shows the
UARFCN assigned to all UTRA FDD operating bands, starting with the lowest
UARFCN and continuing up to the highest one assigned.
Each band may have two table entries, one for the "general" numbers and one
for the "additional" ones, as specified in Table 5.2. The entries in Table E.1
are explained as follows:
**Band range:** The size of the frequency range for the UTRA FDD band
specified in Table 5.0.
**Range res.:** The size of the frequency range corresponding to the UARFCN
range that has been "reserved" in 3GPP for possible future extensions of the
band.
**Formula offset:** The offset parameter (F~UL_Offset~ or F~DL_Offset~) in the
formula, used to calculate the UARFCN as specified in Clause 5.4.3.
**Assigned/reserved:** Indicates the significance of the UARFCN and
corresponding frequencies listed as follows:
**Start res**. Start of the UARFCN range reserved for the band.
**Min.** The lowest UARFCN assigned to the band.
**Max.** The highest UARFCN assigned to the band.
**End res.** End of the UARFCN range reserved for the band.
**N~U~, N~D~:** Uplink and downlink UARFCN.
**F~UL~, F~DL~:** Corresponding uplink and downlink frequencies.
**(Add.):** Refers to the additional UARFCN (on the 100 kHz raster) as
specified in Table 5.1A.
Note that bands V and VI are shown with common entries in Table E.1, since
their UARFCN ranges are completely overlapping.
