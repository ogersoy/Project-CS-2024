# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document establishes Over the Air antenna minimum requirements for
User Equipment (UE) and Mobile Station (MS).
Requirements are defined for roaming bands for the speech position (beside the
head). All bands are potential roaming bands, and the requirements for roaming
bands shall therefore be fulfilled for all bands supported by a UE/MS.
Requirements for operating bands are dependent on how the network has been
built and are thus operator specific and can not be specified here.
Recommended performance values for operating bands (Annex \) are however
included in this specification for information. It should be recognised that
the ability to meet the recommended performance values depends on the number
of frequency bands supported by the UE/MS.

TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Primary mechanical mode:** the mode that is most often used during a call
beside the head. Other mechanical modes are secondary. Every terminal has at
least one primary mechanical mode.
**Speech position:** UE used close to head phantom (Specific Anthropomorphic
Mannequin).

# 4 General
## 4.1 Minimum Requirements for Roaming Bands
The minimum requirements for roaming bands apply only to the primary
mechanical mode in the environmental conditions specified in Annex A. All
bands are potential roaming bands, and a UE/MS shall fulfil the minimum
requirements for roaming bands for all bands supported by the UE/MS.
## 4.2 Relationship between Minimum Requirements for Roaming Bands and Test
Requirements
The Minimum Requirements for roaming bands given in this specification make no
allowance for measurement uncertainty. The test specification 34.114 [4] Annex
F defines Test Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated
for each test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements
in this specification to create Test Requirements.
The measurement results returned by the test system are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ETR 273 [5] Part 1 sub-part 2 section
6.5.
## 4.3 Terminal Classes
### 4.3.1 Mechanical modes
The mechanical modes of a terminal are declared by the manufacturer. A
terminal shall have at least one mechanical mode. If only one mode is
supported, then this is defined as the primary.
# 5 Frequency bands
The requirements defined in this specification apply to the frequency bands
defined below.
## 5.1 General
The information presented in this subclause is based on a chip rate of 3.84
Mcps and 1.28 Mcps (TDD).
NOTE: Other chip rates may be considered in future releases.
## 5.2 FDD Frequency bands
a) UTRA/FDD is designed to operate in the following paired bands:

###### ## Annex A (normative): Environmental conditions
# A.1 General
This normative annex specifies the environmental requirements of the UE.
Within these limits the requirements of the present documents shall be
fulfilled.
# A.2 Environmental requirements
The requirements in this clause apply to all types of UE(s) and MS(s).
## A.2.2 Temperature
All the OTA requirements are applicable in room temperature [e.g. 25°C)].
## A.2.3 Voltage
The UE shall be equipped with a real battery that is fully charged (in the
beginning of the Test).
###### ## Annex B (informative): Recommended performance
# B.1 General
This annex introduces the concept of recommended OTA performance for operating
bands. This requirement is not mandatory but is recommended.
The concept of recommended performance is to ensure that UE/MS OTA performance
is maximised in order to improve user experience and network performance. It
is recognised that the ability to meet the recommended performance depends on
the number of frequency bands supported by the UE/MS.
# B.2 Total Radiated Power
The OTA performance for FDD, GSM and UTRA LCR TDD should be greater or equal
than the recommended values shown in Tables B.1, B.2 and B.3, respectively.
