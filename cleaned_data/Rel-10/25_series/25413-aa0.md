# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
below apply. Terms and definitions not defined below can be found in TR 21.905
[35].
**Cell Load-Based Inter-System Handover:** This mechanism, which is contained
within a UTRAN RNC, consists of three primary functions:
1\. The RNC has the capability to generate and send Cell Load Information
towards the target/source system.
2\. The RNC has the capability to receive Cell Load Information from the
target/source system, and is able to interpret this information.
3\. The ability of the RNC to make a handover decision by comparing the Cell
Load Information that it has received from the target system with the Cell
Load Information it has about its own cells.
**Ciphering Alternative:** defines both the Ciphering Status (started/not
started) together with the Ciphering Algorithm considered altogether**.**
**Core Network operator** : as defined in TS 23.251 [39].
**Corresponding RNC-ID:** RNC-ID corresponding to an eNB ID, which enables a
source RNC to address a target eNB for handover purposes via CN elements that
cannot interprete an eNB ID (see TS 23.401 [48]).
**CSG Cell** : a UTRAN cell broadcasting a CSG Indicator and a CSG identity.
This cell operates in Closed Access Mode as defined in TS 22.220 [56].
**Default CN node** : An RNC with an inactive or not implemented NAS Node
Selection Function TS 23.236 [26] has one single permanent default CN node per
CN domain. It always initiates the Initial UE Message procedure towards its
default CN node. If the NAS Node Selection Function is active, then no Default
CN node exists.
**Directed retry** : Directed retry is the process of assigning a User
Equipment to a radio resource that does not belong to the serving RNC e.g. in
situations of congestion. It is triggered by the RAB Assignment procedure and
employs relocation procedures.
**Elementary Procedure:** RANAP protocol consists of Elementary Procedures
(EPs). An Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between the RNS and
the CN. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to
be used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the
independence between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the
relevant EP description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs
may be invoked independently of each other as stand alone procedures, which
can be active in parallel. Examples on using several RANAP EPs together with
each other and EPs from other interfaces can be found in reference TR 25.931
[4].
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Three
kinds of EPs are used:
\- **Class 1:** Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).
\- **Class 2:** Elementary Procedures without response.
\- **Class 3:** Elementary Procedures with possibility of multiple responses.
For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful:
\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure
successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful:
\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
\- On time supervision expiry (i.e. absence of expected response).
Successful and Unsuccessful:
\- One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for
the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined
for successful outcome.
Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.
Class 3 EPs have one or several response messages reporting both successful,
unsuccessful outcome of the requests and temporary status information about
the requests. This type of EP only terminates through response(s) or EP timer
expiry.
**Enhanced relocation** : denotes a method where the relocation of the SRNS
functionality is prepared via RNSAP means. The CN is not informed until the
preparation and execution of the relocation has taken place.
**Gateway Core Network: as defined in TS 23.251 [39].**
**GERAN BSC in Iu mode:** In the context of this specification no distinction
between an UTRAN RNC and a GERAN BSC in Iu mode is made. The GERAN BSC in Iu
mode will behave as a RNC unless explicitely stated (see TS 43.051 [27]).
**Hybrid Cell** : a UTRAN cell broadcasting a CSG Identity and operating in
Hybrid Access Mode as defined in TS 22.220 [56].
**Integrity Protection Alternative: defines both the Integrity Protection
Status (started/not started) together with the Integrity Protection Algorithm
considered altogether.**
**Management Based Activation:** as defined in TS 32.421 [37].
**MBMS Bearer Service:** as defined in TS 23.246 [41].
**MBMS Iu signalling connection:** as defined in TS 25.346 [42].
**MBMS RAB:** as defined in TS 25.346 [42].
**MBMS Service Area:** as defined in TS 23.246 [41].
**MBMS Service Context:** as defined in TS 25.346 [42].
**MBMS Session:** as defined in TS 25.346 [42].
**MBMS session start:** as defined in TS 25.346 [42].
**MBMS session stop:** as defined in TS 25.346 [42].
**Multicast Service:** as defined in TS 22.146 [40].
**Multi-Operator Core Network** : as defined in TS 23.251 [39].
**Network sharing non-supporting UE:** as defined in TS 23.251 [39].
**Network sharing supporting UE:** as defined in TS 23.251 [39].
**Packet System Information** : as defined in TS 44.060 [46].
**PUESBINE feature:** as defined in TS 23.195 [33].
**Relocation of SRNS:** relocation of SRNS is a UMTS functionality used to
relocate the serving RNS role from one RNS to another RNS. This UMTS
functionality is realised by several elementary procedures executed in several
interfaces and by several protocols and it may involve a change in the radio
resources used between UTRAN and UE
It is also possible to relocate the serving RNS role from:
\- one RNS within UMTS to another relocation target external to UMTS;
\- functionality equivalent to the serving RNS role from another relocation
source external to UMTS to another RNS.
**RAN Information Management: as defined in TS 48.018 [36].**
**RNSAP Relocation: see definition in TS 25.467 [55].**
**Trace Recording Session:** as defined in TS 32.421 [37].
**Trace Recording Session Reference:** as defined in TS 32.421 [37].
**Trace Reference:** as defined in TS 32.421 [37].

**Serving RNS:** role an RNS can take with respect to a specific connection
between an UE and UTRAN. There is one serving RNS for each UE that has a
connection to UTRAN. The serving RNS is in charge of the radio connection
between a UE and the UTRAN. The serving RNS terminates the Iu for this UE
**Signalling Based Activation:** as defined in TS 32.421 [37].
**Source RNC:** source RNC is the RNC belonging to source RNS
**Source RNS:** role, with respect to a specific connection between UTRAN and
CN, that RNS takes when it decides to initiate a relocation of SRNS
**System Information in GERAN:** as defined in TS 44.018 [45].
**Target RNC:** target RNC is the RNC belonging to target RNS
**Target RNS:** role an RNS gets with respect to a specific connection between
UTRAN and CN when it is being a subject of a relocation of SRNS which is being
made towards that RNS
**UE Specific Behaviour Information -- Iu:** as defined in TS 23.195 [33].

# 4 General
## 4.1 Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional
behaviour of the RNC exactly and completely. The CN functional behaviour is
left unspecified. The EPs Relocation Preparation, Reset, Reset Resource and
Overload Control are exceptions from this principle.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure
text in clause 8:
\- The procedure text discriminates between:
1) Functionality which \"shall\" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall\" perform a
certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports
procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST
message of a Class 1 of Class 3 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the
message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an
appropriate cause value.
2) Functionality which \"shall, if supported\" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall, if supported,\"
perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node
shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting
node about the not supported functionality.
\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not
explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response
message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including
_Criticality Diagnostics_ IE, see section 10. For examples on how to use the
_Criticality Diagnostics_ IE, see Annex A.2.
## 4.2 Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by
mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related
IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format
that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded
regardless of the standard version.
## 4.3 Specification Notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the
Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case
characters followed by the word \"procedure\", e.g. RAB Assignment procedure.
Message When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is
written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word
\"message\", e.g. RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message.
IE When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the
_Information Element Name_ is written with the first letters in each word in
upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the
abbreviation \"IE\", e.g. _User Plane Mode_ IE.
Value of an IE When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in
the specification the \"Value\" is written as it is specified in subclause 9.2
enclosed by quotation marks, e.g. \"Abstract Syntax Error (Reject)\" or
\"Geographical Coordinates\".
# 5 RANAP Services
RANAP provides the signalling service between UTRAN or GERAN (in Iu mode) and
CN that is required to fulfil the RANAP functions described in clause 7. RANAP
services are divided into four groups. The first three are based on Service
Access Points (SAP) defined in TS 23.110 [16]:
1\. General control services: They are related to the whole Iu interface
instance between RNC and logical CN domain, and are accessed in CN through the
General Control SAP. They utilise connectionless signalling transport provided
by the Iu signalling bearer.
2\. Notification services: They are related to specified UEs or all UEs in
specified area, and are accessed in CN through the Notification SAP. They
utilise connectionless signalling transport provided by the Iu signalling
bearer.
3\. Dedicated control services: They are related to one UE, and are accessed
in CN through the Dedicated Control SAP. RANAP functions that provide these
services are associated with Iu signalling connection that is maintained for
the UE in question. The Iu signalling connection is realised with connection
oriented signalling transport provided by the Iu signalling bearer.
4\. MBMS control services: They are related to one MBMS Bearer Service. RANAP
functions that provide these services are associated with one or several Iu
signalling connection that is maintained for the MBMS Bearer Service in
question during the MBMS Session. The Iu signalling connection is realised
with connection oriented signalling transport provided by the Iu signalling
bearer.
# 6 Services Expected from Signalling Transport
Signalling transport (See TS 25.412 [5]) shall provide two different service
modes for the RANAP.
1\. Connection oriented data transfer service. This service is supported by a
signalling connection between RNC and CN domain. It shall be possible to
dynamically establish and release signalling connections based on the need.
Each active UE shall have its own signalling connection. Each MBMS Bearer
Service during a given MBMS Session shall have one or several signalling
connections. The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of
RANAP messages. RANAP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
2\. Connectionless data transfer service. RANAP shall be notified in case a
RANAP message did not reach the intended peer RANAP entity.
# 7 Functions of RANAP
RANAP protocol has the following functions:
\- Relocating serving RNC. This function enables to change the serving RNC
functionality as well as the related Iu resources (RAB(s) and Signalling
connection) from one RNC to another.
\- Overall RAB management. This function is responsible for setting up,
modifying and releasing RABs.
\- Queuing the setup of RAB. The purpose of this function is to allow placing
some requested RABs into a queue, and indicate the peer entity about the
queuing.
\- Requesting RAB release. While the overall RAB management is a function of
the CN, the RNC has the capability to request the release of RAB.
\- Release of all Iu connection resources. This function is used to explicitly
release all resources related to one Iu connection.
\- Requesting the release of all Iu connection resources. While the Iu release
is managed from the CN, the RNC has the capability to request the release of
all Iu connection resources from the corresponding Iu connection.
\- SRNS context forwarding function. This function is responsible for
transferring SRNS context from the RNC to the CN for intersystem change in
case of packet forwarding.
\- Controlling overload in the Iu interface. This function allows adjusting
the load in the control plane of the Iu interface.
\- Resetting the Iu. This function is used for resetting an Iu interface.
\- Sending the UE Common ID (permanent NAS UE identity) to the RNC. This
function makes the RNC aware of the UE\'s Common ID.
\- Paging the user. This function provides the CN for capability to page the
UE.
\- Controlling the tracing of the subscriber or user equipment activity. This
function allows setting the trace mode for a given subscriber or user
equipment. This function also allows the deactivation of a previously
established trace.
\- MDT function. This function is to enable the transfer of MDT measurements
collected by the UE.
\- Transport of NAS information between UE and CN (see TS 24.008 [8]). This
function has two sub-classes:
1\. Transport of the initial NAS signalling message from the UE to CN. This
function transfers transparently the NAS information. As a consequence also
the Iu signalling connection is set up.
2\. Transport of NAS signalling messages between UE and CN, This function
transfers transparently the NAS signalling messages on the existing Iu
signalling connection. It also includes a specific service to handle
signalling messages differently.
\- Controlling the security mode in the UTRAN. This function is used to send
the security keys (ciphering and integrity protection) to the UTRAN, and
setting the operation mode for security functions.
\- Controlling location reporting. This function allows the CN to operate the
mode in which the UTRAN reports the location of the UE.
\- Location reporting. This function is used for transferring the actual
location information from RNC to the CN.
\- Data volume reporting function. This function is responsible for reporting
unsuccessfully transmitted DL data volume over UTRAN for specific RABs.
\- Reporting general error situations. This function allows reporting of
general error situations, for which function specific error messages have not
been defined.
\- Location related data. This function allows the CN to either retrieve from
the RNC deciphering keys (to be forwarded to the UE) for the broadcast
assistance data, or request the RNC to deliver dedicated assistance data to
the UE.
\- Information Transfer. This function allows the CN to transfer information
to the RNC.
\- Uplink Information Exchange. This function allows the RNC to transfer or
request information to the CN. For instance the RNC has the capability to
request MBMS specific information to the CN e.g. the Multicast Service lists
for a given UE or the IP Multicast Address and APN for one or several MBMS
Bearer Services.
\- MBMS RANAP overall function. This function allows the following different
sub-functions:
\- MBMS RAB management. This function is responsible for setting up, updating
and releasing the MBMS RAB as well as the MBMS Iu signalling connection
corresponding to one MBMS Session. The MBMS RAB is defined for the CN PS
domain only.
\- MBMS CN (PS domain) de-registration. This function makes the RNC aware that
a given Multicast Service is no longer available.
\- MBMS UE linking/de-linking. This function makes the RNC aware that a given
UE, with existing Iu-ps signalling connection, has joined/left some Multicast
Service(s).
\- Requesting MBMS Service registration/de-registration. While the overall
MBMS CN de-registration is a function of the CN (PS domain), the RNC has the
capability to register/de-register to a specific Multicast Service.
These functions are implemented by one or several RANAP elementary procedures
described in the following clause.
# 8 RANAP Procedures

## 8.2 RAB Assignment
### 8.2.1 General
The purpose of the RAB Assignment procedure is to establish new RABs and/or to
enable modifications and/or releases of already established RABs for a given
UE. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 1: RAB Assignment procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message.
When sending the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, the CN shall start the T
~RABAssgt~ timer.
The CN may request the UTRAN to:
\- establish,
\- modify,
\- release
one or several RABs with one RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message.
The CN shall include in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message at least one
request to either establish/modify or release a RAB.
The message shall contain the information required by the UTRAN to build the
new RAB configuration, such as:
\- list of RABs to establish or modify with their bearer characteristics;
\- list of RABs to release;
\- UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (if available).
For each RAB requested to be established, the message shall contain:
\- RAB ID;
\- NAS Synchronisation Indicator (only when available);
\- RAB parameters (including e.g. Allocation/Retention Priority);
\- User Plane Information (i.e. required User Plane Mode and required UP Mode
Versions);
\- Transport Layer Information;
\- PDP Type Information (only for PS) or PDP Type Information extension (only
for PS);
\- Data Volume Reporting Indication (only for PS);
\- DL GTP-PDU sequence number (only when GTP-PDU sequence number is available
in cases of intersystem change from GPRS to UMTS or when establishing a RAB
for an existing PDP context or in some further cases described in TS 23.060
[21]);
\- UL GTP-PDU sequence number (only when GTP-PDU sequence number is available
in cases of intersystem change from GPRS to UMTS or when establishing a RAB
for an existing PDP context or in some further cases described in TS 23.060
[21]);
\- DL N-PDU sequence number (only when N-PDU sequence number is available in
case of intersystem change from GPRS to UMTS or in some further cases
described in TS 23.060 [21]);
\- UL N-PDU sequence number (only when N-PDU sequence number is available in
case of intersystem change from GPRS to UMTS or in some further cases
described in TS 23.060 [21]).
The RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message shall, if supported, include the
_Correlation ID_ IE for each RAB established towards a L-GW collocated with
the RNC.
For each RAB requested to be modified, the message may contain:
> \- RAB ID (mandatory);
\- NAS Synchronisation Indicator;
\- RAB parameters;
\- Transport Layer Information;
\- User Plane Information.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is present in the RAB ASSIGNMENT
REQUEST message, the UTRAN shall, if supported, store the received UE
Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate parameters to control the aggregate data rate of
non-GBR traffic for this UE.
The _Transport Layer Information_ IE may be present at a RAB modification
except in the case when the only other present IE, besides the _RAB ID_ IE, is
the _NAS Synchronisation Indicator_ IE.
At a RAB modification that does not include transfer of the _NAS
Synchronisation Indicator_ IE, the _RAB Parameters_ IE shall be present in the
RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message only when any previously set value for this IE
is requested to be modified.
At a RAB modification, the _User Plane Information_ IE shall be present in the
RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message only when any previously set value for this IE
is requested to be modified.
For a RAB setup, the _SDU Format Information Parameter_ IE in the _RAB
Parameters_ IE shall be present only if the _User Plane Mode_ IE is set to
\"support mode for pre-defined SDU sizes\" and the _Traffic Class_ IE is set
to either \"Conversational\" or \"Streaming\".
For a RAB setup or modification, when the maximum bit rate (respectively the
guaranteed bit rate when applicable) to be signalled for the RAB exceeds the
maximum value of the _Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Guaranteed Bit Rate_
IE), either the _Extended Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Extended
Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) shall be included together with the _Maximum Bit
Rate_ IE (respectively _Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) set to its maximum value or
the _Supported_ _Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Supported Guaranteed Bit
Rate_ IE) shall be used.
For a RAB setup or modification, if the _Extended Maximum Bit Rate_ IE
(respectively _Extended Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) is present, the RNC shall
consider it and ignore the _Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Guaranteed Bit
Rate_ IE).
For a RAB if _Extended Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Extended Guaranteed
Bit Rate_ IE when applicable) is signalled in one direction RNC shall use the
_Extended Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Extended Guaranteed Bit Rate_
IE) also for the other direction for this RAB. If the _Supported_ _Maximum Bit
Rate_ IE (respectively _Supported Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) is present, it
shall be used in both directions.
For a RAB setup or modification, if the _Supported_ _Maximum Bit Rate_ IE
(respectively _Supported Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) is present, the RNC shall
consider it and ignore the _Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Guaranteed Bit
Rate_ IE).
For a RAB setup, the _RAB Parameters_ IE may contain the _Signalling
Indication_ IE. The _Signalling Indication_ IE shall not be present if the
_Traffic Class_ IE is not set to \"Interactive\" or if the _CN Domain
Indicator_ IE is not set to \"PS domain\".
If the _RAB Parameters_ IE is present for a RAB modification, the _SDU Format
Information Parameter_ IE in the _RAB Parameters_ IE shall be present only if
the _Traffic Class_ IE is set to either \"Conversational\" or \"Streaming\"
and if
\- either the User Plane mode is currently \"support mode for pre-defined SDU
sizes\" and the _User Plane Mode_ IE is not contained in the RAB ASSIGNMENT
REQUEST message
\- or if the _User Plane Mode_ IE optionally contained within the RAB
ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message is set to \"support mode for pre-defined SDU
sizes\".
If, for a RAB requested to be modified, one (or more) of these IEs except _RAB
ID_ IE are not present in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message the RNC shall
continue to use the value(s) currently in use for the not present IEs.
If, for a RAB requested to be modified, _the Signalling Indication_ IE is not
present and the _Traffic Class_ IE is set to \"interactive\", this indicates
that the signalling nature of the RAB is not changed by the modification.
For each RAB requested to be released, the message shall contain:
\- RAB ID;
\- Cause.
Upon reception of the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, the UTRAN shall execute
the requested RAB configuration. The CN may indicate that RAB QoS negotiation
is allowed for certain RAB parameters and in some cases also which alternative
values to be used in the negotiation in the Alternative _RAB parameters
values_ IE.
If some of the alternative maximum bit rates (respectively alternative
guaranteed bit rates when applicable) to be signalled for the RAB exceed the
maximum value of the _Alternative Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively
_Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE), they shall be included either in the
_Extended Alternative Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Extended Alternative
Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE, or in the _Supported Alternative Maximum Bit Rate_ IE
(respectively _Supported Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE). If the
_Supported Alternative Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Supported
Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) is used it shall be used for all
alternative bitrate definitions for the RAB.
For a RAB setup or modification, if the _Extended Alternative Maximum Bit
Rate_ IE (respectively _Extended Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) is
present, the RNC shall consider these rates together with the bit rates
signalled within the _Alternative_ _Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively
_Alternative_ _Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) if present.
For an entry in the list or for a discrete value if the _Extended Alternative
Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Extended Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate_
IE when applicabale) is signalled in one direction RNC shall use the _Extended
Alternative Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Extended Alternative
Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) also for the other direction of this entry or
discrete value. If the _Supported Alternative Maximum Bit Rate_ IE
(respectively _Supported Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) is present it
shall be used in both directions for **all** entr**ies** in the list or
discrete value**s.**
For a RAB setup or RAB requested to be modified, the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST
message may also include an alternative RAB configuration specified in the
_Alternative RAB configuration_ IE in the _Alternative RAB Parameter Values_
IE. If _Alternative RAB configuration_ IE for a RAB is included in the RAB
ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, the RNC is allowed after the successful RAB setup
or RAB modification to request the CN to trigger the execution of this
alternative RAB configuration. No negotiation is allowed during the RAB
Assignment procedure between the requested RAB configuration and this
alternative RAB configuration.
If the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message contains a request of a RAB
configuration with _Extended Maximum Bit Rate_ IE and/or _Extended Guaranteed
Bit Rate_ IE respectively if _Supported Maximum Bit Rate_ IE and/or _Supported
Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE are greater than 16 Mbps in _RAB parameters_ IE, the
CN should indicate that RAB QoS negotiation is allowed. If this RAB
Configuration is for a UE that is not able to support the requested bit rates
according to the _Access Stratum Release Indicator_ IE in TS 25.331 [10]:
\- The UTRAN shall, if supported, perform RAB QoS negotiation.
\- If RAB QoS negotiation is performed, the RNC shall signal the assigned bit
rate indications within the _Assigned RAB Parameter Values_ IE in the
following way:
\- _Extended Assigned Maximum Bit Rate_ IE and _Extended Assigned Guaranteed
Bit Rate_ IE shall not be set in _Assigned RAB Parameter Values_ IE;
\- if the _Supported Assigned Maximum Bit Rate_ IE and _Supported Assigned
Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE are used, they shall be set to a value less than or
equal to 16 Mbps.
The same RAB ID shall only be present once in the whole RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST
message.
The RAB ID shall uniquely identify the RAB for the specific CN domain and for
the particular UE, which makes the RAB ID unique over the Iu connection on
which the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message is received. When a RAB ID already in
use over that particular Iu instance is used, the procedure is considered as
modification of that RAB.
The RNC shall pass the contents of the _RAB ID_ IE to the radio interface
protocol for each RAB requested to be established or modified.
The RNC shall establish or modify the resources according to the values of the
_Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE (priority level, pre-emption indicators,
queuing) and the resource situation as follows:
\- The RNC shall consider the priority level of the requested RAB, when
deciding on the resource allocation.
\- If the requested RAB is allowed for queuing and the resource situation
requires so, the RNC may place the RAB in the establishment queue.
\- The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (singularly or in
combination) be used to determine whether the RAB assignment has to be
performed unconditionally and immediately. If the requested RAB is marked as
\"may trigger pre-emption\" and the resource situation requires so, the RNC
may trigger the pre-emption procedure which may then cause the forced release
of a lower priority RAB which is marked as \"pre-emptable\". Whilst the
process and the extent of the pre-emption procedure is operator-dependent, the
pre-emption indicators, if given in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, shall
be treated as follows:
1\. The values of the last received _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE and
_Priority Level_ IE shall prevail.
2\. If the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE is set to \"may trigger pre-emption\",
then this allocation request may trigger the pre-emption procedure.
3\. If the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE is set to \"shall not trigger pre-
emption\", then this allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption
procedure.
4\. If the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE is set to \"pre-emptable\", then
this connection shall be included in the pre-emption process.
5\. If the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE is set to \"not pre-emptable\", then
this connection shall not be included in the pre-emption process.
6\. If the _Priority Level_ IE is set to \"no priority\" the given values for
the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE and _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE shall not
be considered. Instead the values \"shall not trigger pre-emption\" and \"not
pre-emptable\" shall prevail.
> \- If the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE is not given in the RAB
> ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, the allocation request shall not trigger the
> pre-emption process and the connection may be pre-empted and considered to
> have the value \"lowest\" as priority level. Moreover, queuing shall not be
> allowed.
\- The UTRAN pre-emption process shall keep the following rules:
1\. UTRAN shall only pre‑empt RABs with lower priority, in ascending order of
priority.
2\. The pre-emption may be done for RABs belonging to the same UE or to other
UEs.
If the _NAS Synchronisation Indicator_ IE is contained in the RAB ASSIGNMENT
REQUEST message, the RNC shall pass it to the radio interface protocol for
transfer to the UE.
If the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message includes the _PDP Type Information_ IE
or _PDP Type Information_ extension IE, the UTRAN may use it to configure any
compression algorithms.
If included, the _Service Handover_ IE tells if the requested RAB
\- should be handed over to GSM, i.e. from a NAS point of view, the requested
RAB should be handed over to GSM as soon as possible although the final
decision whether to perform a handover to GSM is still made in the UTRAN.
\- should not be handed over to GSM, i.e. from a NAS point of view, the
requested RAB should remain in UMTS as long as possible although the final
decision whether to perform a handover to GSM is still made in the UTRAN.
\- shall not be handed over to GSM, i.e. the requested RAB shall never be
handed over to GSM. This means that the UTRAN shall not initiate handover to
GSM for the UE unless the RABs with this indication have first been released
with the normal release procedures.
The value of the _Service Handover_ IE is valid throughout the lifetime of the
RAB or until changed by a RAB modification.
The _Service Handover_ IE shall only influence decisions made regarding UTRAN-
initiated inter-system handovers.
If the _Service Handover_ IE is not included during RAB Setup and all
subsequent RAB Modifications, the decision whether to perform an inter-system
handover to GSM is only an internal UTRAN matter.
If included, the _E-UTRAN_ _Service Handover_ IE tells if the requested RAB is
allowed to be handed over to E-UTRAN
The value of the _E-UTRAN_ _Service Handover_ IE is valid throughout the
lifetime of the RAB or until changed by a RAB modification.
If the _E-UTRAN_ _Service Handover_ IE is not included during RAB Setup and
all subsequent RAB Modifications, the decision whether to perform an inter-
system handover to E-UTRAN is only an internal UTRAN matter.
The UTRAN shall report to the CN, in the first RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE
message, the result for all the requested RABs, such as:
\- List of RABs successfully established or modified.
\- List of RABs released.
\- List of RABs queued.
> \- List of RABs failed to establish or modify.
>
> \- List of RABs failed to release.
The same RAB ID shall only be present once in the whole RAB ASSIGNMENT
RESPONSE message.
For each RAB successfully established towards the PS domain or towards the CS
domain when an ALCAP is not used, the RNC shall include the _Transport Layer
Address_ IE and the _Iu Transport Association_ IE in the RAB ASSIGNMENT
RESPONSE message.
For each RAB successfully released towards the PS domain, for which data
volume reporting had been requested when the RAB was established, the RNC
shall include the _DL Data Volumes_ IE in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
The _DL Data Volumes_ IE shall contain in the _Unsuccessfully Transmitted DL
Data Volume_ IE the total amount of unsuccessfully transmitted DL data for the
RAB since its establishment and may contain the _Data Volume Reference IE._
For each RAB successfully released towards the PS domain, the RNC shall
include in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message the _DL GTP-PDU Sequence
Number_ IE and the _UL GTP-PDU Sequence Number_ IE, if available and if the
release was initiated by the UTRAN.
The RNC shall report in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message at least one RAB:
\- setup/modified or
\- released or
\- queued or
\- failed to setup/modify or
\- failed to release.
If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used when establishing or
modifying a RAB, these RAB parameter values shall be included in the RAB
ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message within the _Assigned RAB Parameter Values_ IE.
If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used from the _Extended
Alternative Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Extended Alternative
Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE), these RAB parameter values shall be included in the
RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message within the _Extended Assigned Maximum Bit
Rate_ IE (respectively _Extended Assigned Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE).
For a RAB if the _Extended Assigned Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively
_Extended Assigned Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE when applicable) is signalled in
one direction RNC shall signal the _Extended Assigned Maximum Bit Rate_ IE
(respectively _Extended Assigned Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) also in the other
direction for this RAB. If the _Supported Assigned Maximum Bit Rate_ IE
(respectively _Supported Assigned Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) is used it shall be
used in both directions.
If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used from the _Supported
Alternative Maximum Bit Rate Information_ IE (respectively _Supported
Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate Information_ IE), these RAB parameter values
shall be included in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message within the _Supported
Assigned Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Supported Assigned Guaranteed Bit
Rate_ IE).
For the CS domain, when an ALCAP is used, UTRAN shall report the successful
outcome of a specific RAB to establish or modify only after the Iu user plane
at RNL level is ready to be used in UL and DL. At a RAB establishment, the
transport network control plane signalling required to set up the transport
bearer shall use the _Transport Layer Address_ IE and _Iu Transport
Association_ IE. At a RAB modification when _Transport Layer Address_ (IE) and
_Iu Transport Association_ IEs are included, the RNC shall establish a new
transport bearer. The transport network control plane signalling shall then
use the included _Transport Layer Address_ IE and _Iu Transport Association_
IE. Then the switch over to this new transport bearer shall be done
immediately after transport bearer establishment and initialisation of the
user plane mode. If _Transport Layer Address_ (IE) and _Iu Transport
Association_ IEs are not included, then the RNC may modify the already
existing transport bearer.
For the PS domain or for the CS domain when an ALCAP is not used, when they
are present at a RAB modification, the RNC shall use the embedded _Transport
Layer Address_ IE and _Iu Transport Association_ IEs as the termination point
of the new transport bearer.
For the PS domain or for the CS domain when an ALCAP is not used, for each RAB
successfully modified, if the RNC has changed the _Transport Layer Address_ IE
and/or the _Iu Transport Association_ IE, it shall include the new value(s) in
the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
Before reporting the successful outcome of a specific RAB to establish or
modify, the RNC shall have executed the initialisation of the user plane, if
necessary.
Re-initialisation of the user plane shall not be performed if:
\- the _RAB Parameters_ IE is not included, for example during transfer of
_NAS Synchronisation Indicator_ IE;
\- the _RAB Parameters_ IE is included but the _SDU Format Information
Parameter_ IE is not changed for the existing RAB and the _NAS Synchronisation
Indicator_ IE is not included.
Re-initialisation of the user plane shall be performed if the _RAB Parameters_
IE and _NAS Synchronisation Indicator_ IE are included.
If the RNC can not initialise the requested user plane mode for any of the
user plane mode versions in the _UP Mode Versions_ IE according to the rules
for initialisation of the respective user plane mode versions, as described in
TS 25.415 [6], the RAB Assignment shall fail with the cause value \"RNC unable
to establish all RFCs\".
In case of establishment of a RAB for the PS domain, the CN must be prepared
to receive user data before the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message has been
received.
If none of the RABs have been queued, the CN shall stop timer T ~RABAssgt~ and
the RAB Assignment procedure terminates. In that case, the procedure shall
also be terminated in the UTRAN.
When the request to establish or modify one or several RABs is put in a queue,
the UTRAN shall start the timer T~QUEUING~. This timer specifies the maximum
time for queuing of the request for establishment or modification. The same
timer T~QUEUING~ supervises all RABs of the request being queued.
For each RAB that is queued the following outcomes are possible:
\- successfully established or modified;
\- failed to establish or modify;
\- failed due to expiry of the timer T~QUEUING~.
For RABs indicated as queued in the first RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message, the
UTRAN shall report the outcome of the queuing for every RAB individually or
for several RABs in subsequent RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message(s). This is
left to implementation. The UTRAN shall stop T~QUEUING~ when all RABs have
been either successfully established or modified or failed to establish or
modify. The RAB Assignment procedure is then terminated both in the CN and the
UTRAN when all RABs have been responded to.
When the CN receives the response that one or several RABs are queued, it
shall expect the UTRAN to provide the outcome of the queuing function for each
RAB before expiry of the T ~RABAssgt~ timer. In case the timer T ~RABAssgt~
expires, the CN shall consider the RAB Assignment procedure terminated and the
RABs not reported shall be considered as failed.
In case the timer T~QUEUING~ expires, the RAB Assignment procedure terminates
in the UTRAN for all queued RABs, and the UTRAN shall respond for all of them
in one RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message. The RAB Assignment procedure shall
also be terminated in the CN.
In case a request to modify or release a RAB contains the RAB ID of a RAB
being queued, the RAB shall be taken out of the queue and treated according to
the second request. The first request shall be responded to as a RAB failed to
setup or modify with the cause value \"Request superseded\".
If the UTRAN failed to modify a RAB, it shall keep the RAB as it was
configured prior to the modification request.
When UTRAN reports unsuccessful establishment/modification of a RAB, the cause
value should be precise enough to enable the core network to know the reason
for unsuccessful establishment/modification. Typical cause values are:
\"Requested Traffic Class not Available\", \"Invalid RAB Parameters Value\",
\"Requested Maximum Bit Rate not Available\", \"Requested Maximum Bit Rate for
DL not Available\", \"Requested Maximum Bit Rate for UL not Available\",
\"Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate not Available\", \"Requested Guaranteed Bit
Rate for DL not Available\", \"Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate for UL not
Available\", \"Requested Transfer Delay not Achievable\", \"Invalid RAB
Parameters Combination\", \"Condition Violation for SDU Parameters\",
\"Condition Violation for Traffic Handling Priority\", \"Condition Violation
for Guaranteed Bit Rate\", \"User Plane Versions not Supported\", \"Iu UP
Failure\", \"Iu Transport Connection Failed to Establish\", \"T~QUEUING~
Expiry\".
If the RAB ID of a RAB requested to be released is unknown in the RNC, this
shall be reported as a RAB failed to release with the cause value \"Invalid
RAB ID\".
The RNC may indicate an impending directed retry attempt to GSM by sending a
RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message with a RAB ID included in the list of RABs
failed to setup and a cause value of \"Directed Retry\".
The RNC shall be prepared to receive a RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message
containing a _RABs To Be Released_ IE at any time and shall always reply to
it. If there is an ongoing RAB Assignment procedure for a RAB indicated within
the _RABs To Be Released_ IE, the RNC shall discard the preceding RAB
Assignment procedure for that specific RAB, release any related resources and
report the released RAB within the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
After sending a RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message containing RAB ID within the
_RABs Released_ IE, the RNC shall be prepared to receive a new establishment
request for a RAB identified by the same RAB ID.
In case SIPTO at Iu-PS functionality is supported by the UTRAN, the following
applies in addition for the successful operation of the RAB Assignment
procedure:
\- If the _MSISDN_ IE is present in the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message, then
the UTRAN may offload the RAB(s) where the _Offload RAB Parameters_ IE is
present in the _RABs To Be Setup_ _Or Modified Item IEs_ IE. The _Access Point
Name_ IE and the _Charging Characteristics_ IE within the _Offload RAB
Parameters_ IE and the _MSISDN_ IE may only be used for the SIPTO at Iu-PS
function and according to the description in TS 23.060 [21].
#### 8.2.2.1 Successful Operation for GERAN Iu-mode
For GERAN Iu-mode the following shall apply in addition for the successful
operation of the RAB Assignment procedure:
\- In case of GERAN Iu-mode, for a RAB requested to be setup or modified from
the CS domain, the RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message may contain the _GERAN BSC
Container_ IE in order to provide GERAN-specific information to GERAN (see TS
43.051 [27]).
\- In case of GERAN Iu-mode (only for CS), if the BSC cannot provide an
appropriate RAB corresponding to the content of the _GERAN BSC Container_ IE
(if received), the BSC shall report unsuccessful RAB
establishment/modification indicating the cause value \"GERAN Iu-mode
Failure\" and the _GERAN Classmark_ IE in the _GERAN Iu mode specific RABs
Failed To Setup Or Modify List_ IE within the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
### 8.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation
The unsuccessful operation for this Class 3 Elementary procedure is described
under the Successful Operation chapter.
### 8.2.4 Abnormal Conditions
For a RAB requested to be modified, if only the _RAB ID_ IE, the _NAS
Synchronisation Indicator_ IE and the _Transport Layer Information_ IE are
included in the _First Setup or Modify Item_ IE, the RAB shall not be
modified, and the corresponding _RAB ID_ IE and _Cause_ IE shall be included
in the \"RABs Failed To Setup Or Modify List\" in the RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE
message.
If, for a RAB requested to be setup towards the PS domain, any of the
following IEs:
\- _PDP Type Information_.
\- _PDP Type Information extension._
\- _Data Volume Reporting Indication_.
is not present, the RNC shall continue with the procedure.
**Interactions with Relocation Preparation/Enhanced Relocation procedure:**
If the relocation or enhanced relocation becomes necessary during the RAB
Assignment procedure, the RNC may interrupt the ongoing RAB Assignment
procedure and initiate the Relocation Preparation or Enhanced Relocation
procedure as follows:
1\. The RNC shall terminate the RAB Assignment procedure indicating
unsuccessful RAB configuration modification:
\- for all queued RABs;
\- for RABs not already established or modified, and
\- for RABs not already released;
with the cause \"Relocation triggered\".
2\. The RNC shall terminate the RAB Assignment procedure indicating successful
RAB configuration modification:
\- for RABs already established or modified but not yet reported to the CN,
and
\- for RABs already released but not yet reported to the CN.
3\. The RNC shall report the outcome of the procedure in one RAB ASSIGNMENT
RESPONSE message.
4\. The RNC shall either invoke relocation by sending a RELOCATION REQUIRED
message to the active CN node(s) or enhanced relocation by sending the Iur
ENHANCED RELOCATION REQUEST message to the target RAN node.
5\. The CN shall terminate the RAB Assignment procedure at reception of the
RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
Directed retry from UMTS to GSM (CS domain only):
In the case where the RNC has no RAB configuration for a particular UE in the
CS domain, and the RNC receives a RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message for that UE
requesting the establishment of one RAB only, a directed retry to perform
inter-system handover to GSM may be initiated. In this case the RNC may
interrupt the ongoing RAB Assignment procedure and initiate the Relocation
Preparation procedure as follows:
1\. The RNC shall terminate the RAB Assignment procedure indicating
unsuccessful RAB configuration modification of that RAB with the cause
\"Directed retry\".
2\. The RNC shall report the outcome of the procedure in one RAB ASSIGNMENT
RESPONSE message.
3\. The RNC shall invoke relocation by sending a RELOCATION REQUIRED message
to the active CN node, with the cause \"Directed Retry\".
4\. The CN shall terminate the RAB Assignment procedure at reception of the
RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE message.
For a RAB setup or modification, if the _Supported_ _Maximum Bit Rate_ IE
(respectively _Supported Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) is present in the _RAB
Parameters_ IE, the RNC shall ignore the corresponding bitrate and/or extended
bitrate definition in this IE.
For a RAB setup or modification, if the _Supported Alternative Maximum Bit
Rate_ IE (respectively _Supported Alternative Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) is
present in the _Alternative RAB Parameter Values_ IE, the RNC shall ignore the
corresponding alternative bitrate and/or extended alternative bitrate
definitions in this IE.
## 8.3 RAB Release Request
### 8.3.1 General
The purpose of the RAB Release Request procedure is to enable the UTRAN to
request the release of one or several radio access bearers. The procedure uses
connection oriented signalling.
### 8.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 2: RAB Release Request procedure. Successful operation.
The RNC initiates the procedure by generating a RAB RELEASE REQUEST message
towards the CN. The _RABs To Be Released_ IE shall indicate the list of RABs
requested to release and the _Cause_ IE associated to each RAB shall indicate
the reason for the release, e.g. \"RAB pre-empted\", \"Release due to UTRAN
Generated Reason\", \"Radio Connection With UE Lost\".
The RNC shall indicate the _Cause_ IE set to \"GTP Resources Unavailable\" for
the reasons specified in TS 23.007 [53].
Upon reception of the RAB RELEASE REQUEST message, the CN should normally
initiate the appropriate release procedure for the RABs identified in the RAB
RELEASE REQUEST message as defined below. It is up to the CN to decide how to
react to the request.
**Interaction with Iu Release Command:**
If no RABs will remain according to the RAB RELEASE REQUEST message, the CN
should initiate the Iu Release procedure if it does not want to keep the Iu
signalling connection. The cause value to use is \"No Remaining RAB\".
**Interaction with RAB Assignment (release RAB):**
If the CN decides to release some or all indicated RABs, the CN should invoke
the RAB Assignment procedure (release RAB) to this effect.
### 8.3.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.4 Iu Release Request
### 8.4.1 General
The purpose of the Iu Release Request procedure is to enable the UTRAN to
request the CN to release the Iu connection for a particular UE due to some
UTRAN generated reason (e.g. \"O&M Intervention\", \"Unspecified Failure\",
\"User Inactivity\", \"Repeated Integrity Checking Failure\" , \"Release due
to UE generated signalling connection release\", \"Radio Connection With UE
Lost\", \"Access Restricted Due to Shared Networks\"). The procedure uses
connection oriented signalling.
### 8.4.2 Successful Operation
Figure 3: Iu Release Request procedure. Successful operation.
The RNS controlling the Iu connection(s) of that particular UE initiates the
procedure by generating an IU RELEASE REQUEST message towards the affected CN
domain(s). The procedure may be initiated for instance when the contact with a
particular UE is lost or due to user inactivity.
The IU RELEASE REQUEST message shall indicate the appropriate cause value for
the requested Iu connection release. It is up to the CN to decide how to react
to the request.
**Interactions with Iu Release procedure:**
The Iu Release procedure should be initiated upon reception of an IU RELEASE
REQUEST message when the cause is different than \"User Inactivity\". When the
cause is set to \"User Inactivity\", it is optional to initiate the Iu Release
procedure.
### 8.4.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.5 Iu Release
### 8.5.1 General
The purpose of the Iu Release procedure is to enable the CN to release an Iu
connection for a particular UE and all UTRAN resources related only to that Iu
connection. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
The Iu Release procedure can be initiated for at least the following reasons:
\- Completion of transaction between the UE and the CN.
\- UTRAN-generated reasons, e.g. reception of an IU RELEASE REQUEST message.
\- Completion of successful relocation of SRNS.
\- Cancellation of relocation after successful completion of a Relocation
Resource Allocation procedure.
\- Detection of two Iu connections in the same domain toward one UE.
The Iu release procedure should also be initiated when there is a period of Iu
signalling inactivity with no existing RAB.
### 8.5.2 Successful Operation
Figure 4: Iu Release procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending an IU RELEASE COMMAND message to the
UTRAN.
After the IU RELEASE COMMAND message has been sent, the CN shall not send
further RANAP connection-oriented messages on this particular connection.
The IU RELEASE COMMAND message shall include a _Cause_ IE indicating the
reason for the release (e.g. \"Successful Relocation\", \"Normal Release\",
\"Release due to UTRAN Generated Reason\", \"Relocation Cancelled\", \"No
Remaining RAB\").
When the RNC receives the IU RELEASE COMMAND message:
1\. Clearing of the related UTRAN resources is initiated. However, the UTRAN
shall not clear resources related to other Iu signalling connections the UE
might have. The Iu transport bearers for RABs subject to data forwarding and
other UTRAN resources used for the GTP-PDU forwarding process, are released by
the RNC only when the timer T~DATAfwd~ expires.
2\. The RNC returns any assigned Iu user plane resources to idle i.e. neither
uplink user data nor downlink user data can be transferred over the Iu
interface anymore. Then the RNC sends an IU RELEASE COMPLETE message to the
CN. (The RNC does not need to wait for the release of UTRAN radio resources or
for the transport network layer signalling to be completed before returning
the IU RELEASE COMPLETE message.) When an IU RELEASE COMPLETE message is sent,
the procedure is terminated in the UTRAN.
If the IU RELEASE COMMAND message included the _End Of CSFB_ IE, the RNC may
use the indication to determine which of the existing mechanisms that should
be used to move the UE to E UTRAN.
In case the UE has been linked to Multicast Service(s) in UTRAN and the RNC
receives the IU RELEASE COMMAND message from PS domain or from CS domain when
no Iu signalling connection exists towards the other domain the RNC shall
perform UE de-linking as described in TS 25.346 [42].
The IU RELEASE COMPLETE message shall include within the _RABs Data Volume
Report List_ IE for each RAB towards the PS domain successfully addressed and
for which data volume reporting was requested during RAB establishment, the
total amount of unsuccessfully transmitted DL data _for the RAB since its
establishment_.
If the release was initiated by the UTRAN, for each RAB towards the PS domain
for which the _DL GTP-PDU Sequence Number_ IE and/or the _UL GTP-PDU Sequence
Number_ IE are (is) available, the RNC shall include the available sequence
number(s) in the _RABs Released Item_ IE (within the _RAB Released List_ IE)
in the IU RELEASE COMPLETE message.
The _RAB Release Item_ IE shall not be present if there is no sequence number
to be reported for that RAB.
Reception of an IU RELEASE COMPLETE message terminates the procedure in the
CN.
**[Interaction with Trace:]{.underline}**
In case of simultaneous Iu signalling connections for both CS and PS domains,
if a trace session was activated by both domains, the successful release of
one of the connections should not close this trace session. If the trace
session was activated by only one domain and the Iu connection for this domain
is successfully released, this trace session shall be stopped in UTRAN.
### 8.5.3 Abnormal Conditions
If the Iu Release procedure is not initiated towards the source RNC from the
CN before the expiry of timer T~RELOCoverall~, the source RNC should initiate
the Iu Release Request procedure towards the CN with a cause value
\"T~RELOCoverall~ expiry\".
## 8.6 Relocation Preparation
### 8.6.1 General
The purpose of the Relocation Preparation procedure is to prepare relocation
of SRNS either with involving the UE or without involving the UE. The
relocation procedure shall be co-ordinated over all Iu signalling connections
existing for the UE in order to allow Relocation co-ordination in the target
RNC. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
The source RNC shall not initiate the Relocation Preparation procedure for an
Iu signalling connection if a Prepared Relocation exists in the RNC for that
Iu signalling connection or if a Relocation Preparation procedure is ongoing
for that Iu signalling connection or in the case of a MOCN configuration if
the Rerouting Function is ongoing.
### 8.6.2 Successful Operation
Figure 5: Relocation Preparation procedure. Successful operation.
The source RNC initiates the procedure by sending a RELOCATION REQUIRED
message. The source RNC shall decide whether to initiate an intra-system
Relocation or an inter-system handover.
The source RNC shall indicate the appropriate cause value for the Relocation
in the _Cause_ IE. Typical cause values are \"Time critical Relocation\",
\"Resource optimisation relocation\", \"Relocation desirable for radio
reasons\" , \"Directed Retry\", \"Reduce Load in Serving Cell\", \"Access
Restricted Due to Shared Networks\", \"No Iu CS UP relocation\".
The source RNC shall determine whether the relocation of SRNS shall be
executed with or without involvement of the UE. The source RNC shall set
accordingly the _Relocation Type_ IE to \"UE involved in relocation of SRNS\"
or \"UE not involved in relocation of SRNS\".
In case of intra-system Relocation, the source RNC:
\- shall indicate in the _Source ID_ IE the RNC-ID of the source RNC and in
the _Target ID_ IE the RNC-ID of the target RNC only including the RAC if the
message is sent towards the PS domain;
\- shall in case SRVCC is performed include the _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE in
the RELOCATION REQUIRED message. The value of _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE shall
be set by the source RNC. In case the source RNC decides to involve at the
target side only CS domain, the _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE shall be set to \"CS
only\", to \"PS and CS\" in case CS and PS domain at the target side shall be
involved;
NOTE: The _Number of Iu Instances_ IE within the _Source RNC to Target RNC
Transparent Container_ IE shall be set according to the _SRVCC HO Indication_
IE.
\- shall include in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message the _Source to Target
Transparent Container_ IE. This container shall be encoded according to the
_Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE definition. The _Source
RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE shall include:
\- the _Relocation Type_ IE and the _Number of Iu Instances_ IE containing the
number of Iu signalling connections existing for the UE.
\- the _Integrity Protection Key_ IE from the last received domain on which
the Security Mode Control procedure has been successfully performed, and the
associated _Chosen Integrity Protection Algorithm_ IE that has been selected
for this domain.
\- the _Ciphering Key_ IE for the signalling data from the last received
domain on which the Security Mode Control procedure has been successfully
performed if the ciphering has been started, together with the associated
_Chosen Encryption Algorithm_ IE that has been selected for this domain. If
the ciphering has not been started, the RNC may include the _Ciphering Key_ IE
and the _Chosen Encryption Algorithm_ IE if they are available.
\- for each domain where the Security Mode Control procedure has been
successfully performed in the source RNC, the _Chosen Encryption Algorithm_ IE
of CS (PS respectively) user data corresponding to the ciphering alternative
that has been selected for this domain. If the Security Mode Control procedure
had not been successful or performed for one domain or had proposed no
ciphering alternative, the _Chosen Encryption Algorithm_ IE for the user data
of this domain shall not be included. When both the CS and the PS user data
_Chosen Encryption Algorithm_ IEs are provided, they shall be the same.
\- the _RRC Container_ IE. If the _Relocation Type_ IE is set to \"UE not
involved in relocation of SRNS\" and the UE is using DCH(s), DSCH(s), USCH(s),
HS-DSCH and/or E-DCH, the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE
shall:
\- for each RAB include the RAB ID, the _CN Domain Indicator_ IE and the
mapping between each RAB subflow and transport channel identifier(s) over Iur,
i.e. if the RAB is carried on a DCH(s), the DCH ID(s) shall be included, and
when it is carried on DSCH(s), USCH(s), HS-DSCH and/or E-DCH, the DSCH ID(s),
USCH ID(s), HS-DSCH MAC-d Flow ID and/or E-DCH MAC-d Flow ID respectively
shall be included.
\- only in the case the active SRBs in SRNC are not all mapped onto the same
DCH, include the _SRB TrCH Mapping_ IE containing for each SRB the SRB ID and
the associated transport channel identifier over Iur, i.e. if the SRB is
carried on a DCH, the DCH ID shall be included, and when it is carried on
DSCH, USCH, HS-DSCH and/or E-DCH, the DSCH ID, USCH ID,HS-DSCH MAC-d Flow ID
and/or E-DCH MAC-d Flow ID respectively shall be included.
\- the _d-RNTI_ IE, if the _Relocation Type_ IE is set to \"UE not involved in
relocation of SRNS\".
\- the _Target Cell ID_ IE, if the _Relocation Type_ IE is set to \"UE
involved in relocation of SRNS\".
\- in the _PS RAB To Be Replaced_ IE the RAB ID of the voice RAB which is
relocated from the PS to the CS CN domain, in case SRVCC is performed.
\- the _d-RNTI for No IuCS UP_ IE, if the source RNC doesn\'t have an Iu-CS
user plane connection, the _Relocation Type_ IE is set to \"UE involved in
relocation of SRNS\" and the reason for the relocation is the source RNC
cannot support CS service. The _Cause_ IE shall be set as \"No Iu CS UP
relocation\" in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message.
\- the _MBMS Linking Information_ IE, if available, in case the UE has been
linked to at least one Multicast Service.
\- the _UE History Information_ IE and the source RNC shall add the stored
information to the _Last Visited Cell List_ IE, in case the source RNC is
configured to collect UE history information.
\- the Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority IE if available in the
source RNC.
\- the _Management Based MDT Allowed_ IE if this has been provided to the RNC
and if the Source RNC selects the same serving PLMN in the target RNC.
\- may in case a Trace Recording Session is active in the Source RNC due to a
Signalling Based Activation (see ref TS 32.421 [37]), include the _Trace
Recording Session Information_ IE containing information identifying the Trace
Record being generated in the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_
IE.
In case of inter-system handover to GSM CS domain, the RNC:
\- the source RNC shall indicate in the _Source ID_ IE the Service Area
Identifier and in the _Target ID_ IE the cell global identity of the cell in
the target system;
\- shall include the _MS Classmark 2_ and _MS Classmark 3_ IEs received from
the UE in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message to the CN;
\- shall include the _Old BSS to New BSS_ _Information_ IE within the
RELOCATION REQUIRED message only if the information is available. This
information shall include, if available, the current traffic load in the
source cell, i.e. prior to the inter-system handover attempt. This information
shall also include the source cell identifier the included traffic load values
correspond to. In the case the UE is using, prior to the inter-system handover
attempt, radio resources of more than one cell, it is implementation specific
for which cell the source RNC should report the current traffic load and the
cell identifier.
\- shall in case SRVCC is performed include the _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE in
the RELOCATION REQUIRED message. The value of _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE shall
be set to \"CS only\" by the source RNC;
In case of inter-system handover to GSM PS domain, the RNC:
\- shall indicate in the _Source ID_ IE the Service Area Identifier, in the
_Target ID_ IE the cell global identity of the cell in the target system and
shall also indicate routing area code for the relevant cell in the target
system;
\- shall include the _Source BSS to Target BSS Transparent Container_ IE
within the RELOCATION REQUIRED message to the CN. It may indicate in this
container whether it requests to receive the SI/PSI container from the
external inter-system handover target in the RELOCATION COMMAND message.
In case of inter-system handover towards the GSM CS domain and GSM PS domain
in parallel, the source RNC:
\- shall include in the _Target ID_ IE the same cell global identity of the
cell in the target system for CS domain and PS domain and set the appropriate
information about the nature of the CS/PS inter-system handover (see ref TS
43.055 [47]) in the _Old BSS to New BSS Information_ IE and _Source BSS to
Target BSS Transparent Container_ IE accordingly.
\- shall in case SRVCC is performed include the _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE in
the RELOCATION REQUIRED message. The value of _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE shall
be set to \"PS and CS\" by the source RNC;
In case of inter-system handover to E-UTRAN (as specified in TS 23.401 [48]),
the RNC:
\- shall indicate in the _Source ID_ IE the RNC-ID of the source RNC and in
the _Target ID_ IE either the eNB-ID or the Corresponding RNC-ID of the target
eNodeB in the target system (see subclause 9.2.1.25);
\- shall include the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE within the
RELOCATION REQUIRED message. The information in the container shall be encoded
according to the _Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container_ IE
definition as specified in TS 36.413 [49].
When the source RNC sends the RELOCATION REQUIRED message, it shall start the
timer T~RELOCprep.~
When the preparation including resource allocation in the target system is
ready and the CN has decided to continue the relocation of SRNS, the CN shall
send a RELOCATION COMMAND message to the source RNC and the CN shall start the
timer T~RELOCcomplete~.
If the _CSG Id_ IE and no _Cell Access Mode_ IE are received in the
_RELOCATION_ REQUIRED message, the _CN_ shall perform the access control
according to the CSG Subscription _Data_ of that UE and if the access control
is successful, or if one of the RABs has some particular ARP values (see TS
23.060 [21]), it shall continue the relocation and propagate the _target CSG
Id_ IE to the target side. If the access control is unsuccessful but at least
one of the RABs has some particular ARP values (see TS 23.060 [21]) the CN
shall also provide the _CSG Membership Status_ IE set to \"non-member\" to the
target side.
If the _CSG Id_ IE and the _Cell Access Mode_ IE set to \"hybrid\" are
received in the _RELOCATION_ REQUIRED message, the _CN_ shall provide the _CSG
Membership Status_ IE of the UE and the _target_ CSG Id to the target side.
If the _Target To Source Transparent Container_ IE or the _L3 information_ IE
or the _Target BSS to Source BSS Transparent Container_ IE is received by the
CN from the relocation target, it shall be included in the RELOCATION COMMAND
message.
The RELOCATION COMMAND message may also contain the _Inter-System Information
Transparent Container_ IE.
In case of SRVCC operation, when the target system is GERAN the RELOCATION
COMMAND message shall contain the _SRVCC Information_ IE.
If the _Target BSS to Source BSS Transparent Container_ IE is received in the
RELOCATION COMMAND message, only the value part of the UE related containers
received shall be sent to the UE.
For each RAB successfully established in the target system and originating
from the PS domain, the RELOCATION COMMAND message shall contain at least one
pair of Iu transport address and Iu transport association to be used for the
forwarding of the DL N-PDU duplicates towards the relocation target. If more
than one pair of Iu transport address and Iu transport association is
included, the source RNC shall select one of the pairs to be used for the
forwarding of the DL N-PDU duplicates towards the relocation target. Upon
reception of the RELOCATION COMMAND message from the PS domain, the source RNC
shall start the timer T~DATAfwd.~
The Relocation Preparation procedure is terminated in the CN by transmission
of the RELOCATION COMMAND message.
If the target system (including target CN) does not support all existing RABs,
the RELOCATION COMMAND message shall contain a list of RABs indicating all the
RABs that are not supported by the target system. This list may include
information on RABs from the PS domain not existing in the source RNC which
shall be ignored by the source RNC. This list is contained in the _RABs to Be
Released_ IE. The source RNC shall use this list to avoid transferring
associated contexts where applicable and may use this list e.g. to decide if
to cancel the relocation or not. The resources associated with not supported
RABs shall not be released until the relocation is completed. This is in order
to make a return to the old configuration possible in case of a failed or
cancelled relocation.
Upon reception of the RELOCATION COMMAND message the source RNC shall stop the
timer T~RELOCprep~, start the timer T~RELOCOverall~ and terminate the
Relocation Preparation procedure. The source RNC is then defined to have a
Prepared Relocation for that Iu signalling connection.
When the Relocation Preparation procedure is successfully terminated and when
the source RNC is ready, the source RNC should trigger the execution of
relocation of SRNS.
**Interactions with the SRVCC Preparation procedure:**
In case of SRVCC operation, the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent
Container_ IE shall include the _Integrity Protection Key_ IE, the _Ciphering
Key_ IE for the signalling data and the SRVCC Information as received during
the SRVCC Preparation procedure.
**Interactions with other procedures:**
If, after a RELOCATION REQUIRED message is sent and before the Relocation
Preparation procedure is terminated, the source RNC receives a RANAP message
initiating another connection oriented RANAP class 1 or class 3 procedure
(except IU RELEASE COMMAND message, which shall be handled normally) via the
same Iu signalling connection, the source RNC shall either:
1\. cancel the Relocation Preparation procedure i.e. execute the Relocation
Cancel procedure with an appropriate value for the _Cause_ IE, e.g.
\"Interaction with other procedure\", and after successful completion of the
Relocation Cancel procedure, the source RNC shall continue the initiated RANAP
procedure;
or
2\. terminate the initiated RANAP procedure without any changes in UTRAN by
sending the appropriate response message with the cause value \"Relocation
Triggered\" to the CN. The source RNC shall then continue the relocation of
SRNS.
If during the Relocation Preparation procedure the source RNC receives a
DIRECT TRANSFER message it shall be handled normally up to the anticipated
limit according to section 14.12.4.2 TS 25.331 [10].
If during the Relocation Preparation procedure the source RNC receives
connection oriented RANAP class 2 messages (with the exception of DIRECT
TRANSFER message) it shall decide to either execute the procedure immediately
or suspend it. In case the relocation is cancelled, the RNC shall resume any
suspended procedures (if any).
After the Relocation Preparation procedure is successfully terminated, all
RANAP messages (except IU RELEASE COMMAND message, which shall be handled
normally) received via the same Iu signalling bearer shall be ignored by the
source RNC.
#### 8.6.2.1 Successful Operation for GERAN Iu-mode
The relocation between UTRAN and GERAN Iu-mode shall be considered in the
Relocation Preparation procedure as intra-system relocation from RANAP point
of view.
For GERAN Iu-mode and to support Relocation towards a GERAN BSC in Iu mode the
following shall apply in addition for the successful operation of the
Relocation Preparation procedure:
\- In case of a Relocation to GERAN Iu-mode (only for CS), the RNC shall
include, if available, the _GERAN Classmark_ IE within the RELOCATION REQUIRED
message in those cases where the transmission of the _GERAN Classmark IE_ is
required, as defined in TS 43.051 [27].
### 8.6.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 6: Relocation Preparation procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the CN or target system is not able to even partially accept the relocation
of SRNS, or a failure occurs during the Relocation Preparation procedure in
the CN, or the CN decides not to continue the relocation of SRNS, the CN shall
send a RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message to the source RNC.
The RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message shall contain the appropriate value
for the _Cause_ IE, e.g. \"T~RELOCalloc~ expiry\", \"Relocation Failure in
Target CN/RNC or Target System\", \"Relocation not supported in Target RNC or
Target System\", \"Relocation Target not allowed\", \"No Radio Resources
Available in Target Cell\" or \"Traffic Load In The Target Cell Higher Than In
The Source Cell\".
Transmission of the RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message terminates the
procedure in the CN. Reception of the RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message
terminates the procedure in UTRAN.
When the Relocation Preparation procedure is unsuccessfully terminated, the
existing Iu signalling connection can be used normally.
If the Relocation Preparation procedure is unsuccessfully terminated, the CN
shall release the possibly existing Iu signalling connection for the same UE
and related to the same relocation of SRNS towards the target RNC by
initiating the Iu Release procedure towards the target RNC with an appropriate
value for the _Cause_ IE, e.g. \"Relocation Cancelled\".
The RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message may contain the _Inter-System
Information Transparent Container_ IE.
If the _CSG Id_ IE and no _Cell Access Mode_ IE are received in the RELOCATION
REQUIRED message and the access control is unsuccessful and if none of the
RABs has some particular ARP values (see TS 23.060 [21]), the CN shall send
the RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value to
the source RNC. Upon reception, the source RNC may decide to prevent
relocation for that UE towards closed access mode cells with corresponding CSG
Id.
**Interactions with Relocation Cancel procedure:**
If there is no response from the CN to the RELOCATION REQUIRED message before
timer T~RELOCprep~ expires in the source RNC, the source RNC shall cancel the
Relocation Preparation procedure by initiating the Relocation Cancel procedure
with the appropriate value for the _Cause_ IE, e.g. \"T~RELOCprep~ expiry\".
### 8.6.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the target RNC indicated in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message is not known to
the CN:
1\. The CN shall reject the relocation of SRNS by sending a RELOCATION
PREPARATION FAILURE message to the source RNC with _Cause_ IE set to \"Unknown
target RNC\".
2\. The CN shall continue to use the existing Iu connection towards the source
RNC.
NOTE: In case two CN domains are involved in the SRNS Relocation Preparation
procedure and the Source RNC receives the _Target RNC to Source RNC
Transparent Container_ IE via two CN domains, it may check whether the content
of the two _Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container_ IE is the same. In
case the Source RNC receives two different _Target RNC to Source RNC
Transparent Container_ IEs, the RNC behaviour is left implementation-specific.
NOTE: In case two CN domains are involved in the SRNS Relocation Preparation
procedure due to the inter-system handover towards the GSM CS domain and GSM
PS domain in parallel and the Source RNC receives the _L3 Information_ IE from
CS domain and the _Target BSS to Source BSS Transparent Container_ IE from PS
domain, it may check whether the content of the _L3 Information_ IE and the
content of the _Target BSS to Source BSS Transparent Container_ IE is the
same. In case the Source RNC receives two IEs with different contents, the RNC
behaviour is left implementation-specific.
### 8.6.5 Co-ordination of Two Iu Signalling Connections
If the RNC decides to initiate the Relocation Preparation procedure for a
UTRAN to UTRAN relocation, the RNC shall initiate simultaneously a Relocation
Preparation procedure on all Iu signalling connections existing for the UE.
The source RNC shall also include the same _Source RNC to Target RNC
Transparent Container_ IE, _Relocation Type_ IE, _Source ID_ IE and _Cause_ IE
in the RELOCATION REQUIRED message towards the two domains.
For intersystem handover to GSM, the Relocation Preparation procedure shall be
initiated either only towards the circuit-switched CN or only towards the
packet-switched CN, if the inter-system handover towards the GSM CS domain and
GSM PS domain in parallel is not supported. Otherwise the Relocation
Preparation procedure shall be simultaneously initiated towards both the
circuit-switched CN and the packet-swithched CN.
The source RNC shall not trigger the execution of relocation of SRNS unless it
has received a RELOCATION COMMAND message from all Iu signalling connections
for which the Relocation Preparation procedure has been initiated, except the
case where the relocation is to a target CSG cell where the UE is a non-member
of the target CSG, and where there is at least one of the RABs that has a
particular ARP value (see TS 23.060 [21]).
If the source RNC receives a RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message from the
CN, the RNC shall initiate the Relocation Cancel procedure on the other Iu
signalling connection for the UE if the other Iu signalling connection exists
and if the Relocation Preparation procedure is still ongoing or the procedure
has terminated successfully in that Iu signalling connection, except the case
where the relocation is to a target CSG cell where the UE is a non-member of
the target CSG, and where is at least one of the RABs that has a particular
ARP value (see TS 23.060 [21]) in the other domain.
## 8.7 Relocation Resource Allocation
### 8.7.1 General
The purpose of the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure is to allocate
resources from a target RNS for a relocation of SRNS. The procedure shall be
co-ordinated over all Iu signalling connections existing for the UE. The
procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
NOTE: In case of SRVCC operation, the procedure shall be co-ordinated in the
domains which the source RNC decides to involve in the SRVCC operation.
### 8.7.2 Successful Operation
Figure 7: Relocation Resource Allocation procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by generating a RELOCATION REQUEST message. In
a UTRAN to UTRAN relocation, the message shall contain the information (if
any) required by the UTRAN to build at least the same set of RABs as existing
for the UE before the relocation, except the relocation due to SRVCC
operation. The CN may indicate that RAB QoS negotiation is allowed for certain
RAB parameters and in some cases also which alternative values to be used in
the negotiation.
The RELOCATION REQUEST message may also include an alternative RAB
configuration for a RAB specified in the _Alternative RAB configuration_ IE in
the _Alternative RAB Parameter Values_ IE. If _Alternative RAB configuration_
IE for a RAB is included in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the target RNC is
allowed after the successful relocation to request the CN to trigger the
execution of this alternative RAB configuration. No negotiation is allowed
during the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure between the requested RAB
configuration and this alternative RAB configuration.
When the CN transmits the RELOCATION REQUEST message, it shall start the timer
T~RELOCalloc.~
When a RELOCATION REQUEST message is sent from a CN node towards an RNC for
which the sending CN node is not the default CN node, the _Global CN-ID_ IE
shall be included.
Upon reception of the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall
initiate allocation of requested resources.
The RELOCATION REQUEST message shall contain the following IEs:
\- _Permanent NAS UE Identity_ IE (if available);
\- _Cause_ IE;
\- _CN Domain Indicator_ IE;
\- _Source RNC To Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE;
\- _Iu Signalling Connection Identifier_ IE;
\- _Integrity Protection Information_ IE (if available);
\- _SNA Access Information_ IE (if available);
\- _UESBI-Iu IE_ (if available);
\- _Selected PLMN identity_ IE if in MOCN or GWCN configuration;
\- _CN MBMS Linking Information_ IE (if available);
\- _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE (if available)_.
For each RAB requested to relocate (or to be created e.g. in the case of
inter-system handover), the message shall contain the following IEs:
\- _RAB-ID_ IE;
\- _NAS Synchronisation Indicator_ IE (if the relevant NAS information is
provided by the CN);
\- _RAB parameters_ IE;
\- _User Plane Information_ IE;
\- _Transport Layer Address_ IE;
\- _Iu Transport Association_ IE;
\- _Data Volume Reporting Indication_ IE (only for PS);
\- _PDP Type Information_ IE (only for PS).
The RELOCATION REQUEST message may include the following IE:
_\- Encryption Information IE (shall not be included if the Integrity
Protection Information IE is not included);_
_\- CSG Membership Status_ IE (shall be included in cases of relocation of CSG
capable UEs to hybrid cells);
_PDP Type Information extension_ IE (may be included if _PDP Type Information_
IE is included).
For each RAB requested to relocate the message may include the following IEs:
\- _Service Handover_ IE;
_\- Alternative RAB Parameter Values_ IE;
_\- E-UTRAN Service Handover_ IE.
The following information elements received in RELOCATION REQUEST message
require the same special actions in the RNC as specified for the same IEs in
the RAB Assignment procedure:
\- _RAB-ID_ IE;
\- _User plane Information_ IE (i.e. required User Plane Mode and required
User Plane Versions);
\- _Priority level_ IE, _Pre-emption Capability_ IE and _Pre-emption
Vulnerability_ IE;
\- _Service Handover_ IE;
_\- E-UTRAN Service Handover_ IE.
The _SDU Format Information Parameter_ IE in the _RAB Parameters_ IE shall be
present only if the _User Plane Mode_ IE is set to \"support mode for pre-
defined SDU sizes\" and the _Traffic Class_ IE is set to either
\"Conversational\" or \"Streaming\".
For a RAB setup, the _RAB Parameters_ IE may contain the _Signalling
Indication_ IE. The _Signalling Indication_ IE shall not be present if the
_Traffic Class_ IE is not set to \"Interactive\" or if the _CN Domain
Indicator_ IE is not set to \"PS domain\".
If the RELOCATION REQUEST message includes the Permanent NAS UE identity (i.e.
IMSI), the RNC shall associate the permanent identity to the RRC Connection of
that user and shall save it for the duration of the RRC connection.
If the RELOCATION REQUEST message includes the _PDP Type Information_ IE or
_PDP Type Information extension_ IE, the UTRAN may use this IE to configure
any compression algorithms.
If the _CSG Id_ IE is received in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the UTRAN
shall validate it by comparing it with the CSG ID broadcast by the target
cell. If it is valid and if the _CSG Membership Status_ IE is received set to
\"member\", the target RNC may apply appropriate handling to the UE.
If the _CSG Membership Status_ IE and the _CSG Id_ IE are received in the
RELOCATION REQUEST message and the CSG Id does not correspond to the CSG Id
broadcast by the target cell, the RNC may provide the QoS to the UE as for a
non member and shall send back in the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message
the actual CSG Id broadcast by the target cell.
If the target RNC receives the _CSG Id_ IE and the _CSG Membership Status_ IE
is set to \"non-member\" in the RELOCATION REQUEST message and the target cell
is a closed cell and at least one of the RABs has some particular ARP values
(see TS 23.060 [21]) the RNC shall send back the RELOCATION REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE to the CN accepting those RABs and failing the other RABs,
The _Cause_ IE shall contain the same value as the one received in the related
RELOCATION REQUIRED message.
The _Iu Signalling Connection Identifier_ IE contains an Iu signalling
connection identifier which is allocated by the CN. The value for the _Iu
Signalling Connection Identifier_ IE shall be allocated so as to uniquely
identify an Iu signalling connection for the involved CN node. The RNC shall
store and remember this identifier for the duration of the Iu connection.
The RNC shall, if supported, use the _UESBI-Iu_ IE when included in the
RELOCATION REQUEST message.
If the _CN MBMS Linking Information_ IE is included in the RELOCATION REQUEST
message, the RNC shall, if supported, use the _CN MBMS Linking Information_ IE
to perform suitable UE linking as described in TS 25.346 [42].
The algorithms within the _Integrity Protection Information_ IE and the
_Encryption Information_ IE shall be ordered in preferred order with the most
preferred first in the list.
The _Permitted Encryption Algorithms_ IE within the _Encryption Information
IE_ may contain \"no encryption\" within an element of its list in order to
allow the RNC not to cipher the respective connection. This can be done either
by not starting ciphering or by using the UEA0 algorithm. In the absence of
the _Encryption Information_ IE, the RNC shall not start ciphering.
The _Source To Target Transparent Container_ IE is encoded as the _Source RNC
To Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE. The following applies for the _Source
RNC To Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE:
\- In case of intra-system relocation, if no _Integrity Protection Key_ IE
(_Ciphering Key_ IE respectively) is provided within the _Source RNC to Target
RNC Transparent Container_ IE, the target RNC shall not start integrity
protection (ciphering respectively).
\- In case of intra-system relocation, when an _Ciphering Key_ IE is provided
within the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE, the target RNC
may select to use a ciphering alternative where an algorithm is used. It shall
in this case make use of this key to cipher its signalling data whatever the
selected algorithm. The _Encryption Key_ IE that is contained within the
_Encryption Information_ IE of the RELOCATION REQUEST message shall never be
considered for ciphering of signalling data.
\- In case of intra-system relocation, when an _Integrity Protection Key_ IE
is provided within the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE,
the target RNC shall select one integrity algorithm to start integrity and
shall in this case make use of this key whatever the selected algorithm. The
integrity protection key that is contained within the _Integrity Protection
Information_ IE of the RELOCATION REQUEST message shall never be considered.
\- In case of intra-system relocation, when a _Trace Recording Session
Information_ IE is provided within the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent
Container_ IE, the Target RNC should store that information to include it in a
potential future Trace Record for that UE.
\- If the _Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority_ IE is contained
in the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE, the target RNC
shall store the received Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority and
use it as defined in TS 36.300 [52].
\- If the _CSFB Information_ IE is contained in the _Source RNC to Target RNC
Transparent Container_ IE, the target RNC may apply special treatment.
\- The RELOCATION REQUEST message may contain the _Cell Load Group
Information_ IE in the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE.
In case of inter-system relocation, the integrity protection and ciphering
information to be considered shall be the ones received in the _Integrity
Protection Information_ IE and _Encryption Information_ IE of the RELOCATION
REQUEST message.
The _Global CN-ID_ IE contains the identity of the CN node that sent the
RELOCATION REQUEST message, and it shall, if included, be stored together with
the Iu signalling connection identifier. If the _Global CN-ID_ IE is not
included, the RELOCATION REQUEST message shall be considered as coming from
the default CN node for the indicated CN domain.
The following additional actions shall be executed in the target RNC during
the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure:
If included in the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the _Target to
Source Transparent Container_ IE shall be encoded as the _Target RNC to Source
RNC Transparent Container_ IE.
If the _Relocation Type_ IE is set to \"UE involved in relocation of SRNS\":
\- except the relocation due to SRVCC operation, the target RNC should not
accept a requested RAB if the RAB did not exist in the source RNC before the
relocation. In case of SRVCC operation, the target RNC may accept CS RAB even
if it did not exist in the source RNC before the relocation.
\- The target RNC may accept a requested RAB only if the RAB can be supported
by the target RNC.
\- Other RABs shall be rejected by the target RNC in the RELOCATION REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE message with an appropriate value in the _Cause_ IE, e.g. \"Unable
to Establish During Relocation\".
\- The target RNC shall include information adapted to the resulting RAB
configuration in the target to source RNC transparent container to be included
in the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message sent to the CN. If the target
RNC supports triggering of the Relocation Detect procedure via the Iur
interface, the RNC shall assign a d-RNTI for the context of the relocation and
include it in the container. If two CNs are involved in the relocation of
SRNS, the target RNC may, however, decide to send the container to only one
CN.
\- If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used when allocating the
resources, these RAB parameter values shall be included in the RELOCATION
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message within the _Assigned RAB Parameter Values_ IE.
\- If _d-RNTI for No IuCS UP_ IE is contained in the RELOCATION REQUEST
message, the target RNC shall use this information to configure the resource
for the UE over Iur during the relocation.
If the _Relocation Type_ IE is set to \"UE not involved in relocation of
SRNS\":
\- The target RNC shall not accept a requested RAB if the RAB did not exist in
the source RNC before the relocation.
\- The target RNC may accept a RAB only if the radio bearer(s) for the RAB
either exist(s) already and can be used for the RAB by the target RNC, or
do(es) not exist before the relocation but can be established in order to
support the RAB in the target RNC.
\- If existing radio bearers are not related to any RAB that is accepted by
the target RNC, the radio bearers shall be ignored during the relocation of
SRNS and the radio bearers shall be released by the radio interface protocols
after completion of relocation of SRNS.
\- If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used when allocating the
resources, these RAB parameter values shall be included in the RELOCATION
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message within the _Assigned RAB Parameter Values_ IE. It
should be noted that the usage of alternative RAB parameter values is not
applicable to the UTRAN initiated relocation of type \"UE not involved in
relocation of SRNS\".
If the _UE History Information_ IE is included in the RELOCATION REQUEST
message and the target RNC is configured to collect the information, the
target RNC shall collect the same type of information as that included in the
_UE History Information_ IE.
After all necessary resources for accepted RABs including the initialised Iu
user plane, are successfully allocated, the target RNC shall send a RELOCATION
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to the CN.
For each RAB successfully setup the RNC shall include the following IEs:
_\- RAB ID_
_\- Transport Layer Address_ (when no ALCAP has been used)
_\- Iu Transport Association_ (when no ALCAP has been used)
Two pairs of _Transport Layer Address_ IE and _Iu Transport Association_ IE
may be included for RABs established towards the PS domain.
For each RAB the RNC is not able to setup during the Relocation Resource
Allocation procedure, the RNC shall include the _RAB ID_ IE and the _Cause_ IE
within the _RABs Failed To Setup_ IE. The resources associated with the RABs
indicated as failed to set up shall not be released in the CN until the
relocation is completed. This is in order to make a return to the old
configuration possible in case of a failed or cancelled relocation.
The RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message sent to the CN shall, if applicable
and if not sent via the other CN domain, include the _Target RNC To Source RNC
Transparent Container_ IE. This container shall be transferred by the CN to
the source RNC or the external relocation source while completing the
Relocation Preparation procedure.
If the target RNC supports cell load-based inter-system handover, then in the
case of inter-system handover, the _New BSS to Old BSS Information_ IE may be
included in the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message. This information shall
include, if available, the current traffic load in the target cell assuming a
successful completion of the handover in progress.
In case of inter-system relocation, the RNC shall include the _Chosen
Integrity Protection Algorithm_ IE (_Chosen Encryption Algorithm_ IE
respectively) within the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, if, and only
if the _Integrity Protection Information_ IE (_Encryption Information_ IE
respectively) was included in the RELOCATION REQUEST message.
In case of intra-system relocation, the RNC shall include the _Chosen
Integrity Protection Algorithm_ IE (_Chosen Encryption Algorithm_ IE
respectively) within the RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, if, and only
if the _Integrity Protection Key_ IE (_Ciphering Key_ IE respectively) was
included within the _Source RNC-to-Target RNC transparent container_ IE.
If one or more of the RABs that the target RNC has decided to support can not
be supported by the CN, then these failed RABs shall not be released towards
the target RNC until the relocation is completed.
If the _NAS Synchronisation Indicator_ IE is contained in the RELOCATION
REQUEST message, the target RNC shall pass it to the UE.
If the _SNA Access Information_ IE is contained in the RELOCATION REQUEST
message, the target RNC shall store this information and use it to determine
whether the UE has access to radio resources in the UTRAN. The target RNC
shall consider that the UE is authorised to access only the PLMNs identified
by the _PLMN identity_ IE in the _SNA Access Information_ IE. If the
_Authorised SNAs_ IE is included for a given PLMN (identified by the _PLMN
identity_ IE), then the target RNC shall consider that the access to radio
resources for the concerned UE is restricted to the LAs contained in the SNAs
identified by the _SNAC_ IEs.
If the _SNA Access Information_ IE is not contained in the RELOCATION REQUEST
message, the target RNC shall consider that no access restriction applies to
the UE in the UTRAN.
Transmission and reception of a RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message
terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
Before reporting the successful outcome of the Relocation Resource allocation
procedure, the RNC shall have executed the initialisation of the user plane
mode as requested by the CN in the _User Plane Mode_ IE. If the RNC can not
initialise the requested user plane mode for any of the user plane mode
versions in the _UP Mode Versions_ IE according to the rules for
initialisation of the respective user plane mode versions, as described in TS
25.415 [6], the RAB Relocation shall fail with the cause value \"RNC unable to
establish all RFCs\".
If the _Selected PLMN identity_ IE is contained in the RELOCATION REQUEST
message, the target RNC shall use this information to send it to the UE.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is included in the RELOCATION
REQUEST message, the UTRAN shall, if supported, store the received UE
Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate parameters to control the aggregate data rate of
non-GBR traffic for this UE.
In case SIPTO at Iu-PS functionality is supported by the UTRAN, the following
applies in addition for the successful operation of the Relocation Resource
Allocation procedure:
\- If the _MSISDN_ IE is present in the RELOCATION REQUEST message, then the
UTRAN may offload the RAB(s) where the _Offload RAB Parameters_ IE is present
in the _RABs To Be Setup Item IEs_ IE. The _Access Point Name_ IE and the
_Charging Characteristics_ IE within the _Offload RAB Parameters_ IE and the
_MSISDN_ IE may only be used for the SIPTO at Iu-PS function and according to
the description in TS 23.060 [21].
**Interactions with Uplink Information Exchange procedure:**
In case of UTRAN to UTRAN CS only relocation, if the RELOCATION REQUEST
message includes the _MBMS Linking Information_ IE in the _Source RNC To
Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE, the RNC shall, if supported, initiate
the Uplink Information Exchange procedure to retrieve the Multicast Service
list for the UE, create relevant MBMS Service Context, store this information
and perform the relevant UE linking as defined in TS 25.346 [42].
#### 8.7.2.1 Successful Operation for GERAN Iu-mode
The relocation between UTRAN and GERAN Iu-mode shall be considered in the
Relocation Resource Allocation procedure as intra-system relocation from RANAP
point of view.
For GERAN Iu-mode and to support Relocation towards a GERAN BSC in Iu mode the
following shall apply in addition for the successful operation of the
Relocation Resource Allocation procedure:
\- In case of GERAN Iu-mode, for RAB requested to be relocated from the the CS
domain, the RELOCATION REQUEST message may contain the _GERAN BSC Container_
IE in order to provide GERAN specific information to the target BSC (see TS
43.051 [27]).
### 8.7.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8: Relocation Resource Allocation procedure: Unsuccessful operation.
If the target RNC can not even partially accept the relocation of SRNS or a
failure occurs during the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure in the
target RNC, the target RNC shall send a RELOCATION FAILURE message to the CN.
The RELOCATION FAILURE message shall contain the _Cause_ IE with an
appropriate value.
If the target RNC cannot support any of the integrity protection (ciphering
respectively) alternatives provided in the _Integrity Protection Information_
IE or _Encryption Information_ IE, it shall return a RELOCATION FAILURE
message with the cause \"Requested Ciphering and/or Integrity Protection
algorithms not supported\".
If the target RNC cannot support the relocation due to PUESBINE feature, it
shall return a RELOCATION FAILURE message with the cause \"Incoming Relocation
Not Supported Due To PUESBINE Feature\".
If the target RNC does not receive the _CSG Membership Status_ IE but does
receive the _CSG Id_ IE in the RELOCATION REQUEST message and the _CSG Id_ IE
is not valid, it shall send the RELOCATION FAILURE message to the CN with an
appropriate cause value.
If the _CSG ID_ IE is not received in the RELOCATION REQUEST message and the
access control for the relocation to a CSG cell is unsuccessful and if none of
the RABs has some particular ARP values (see TS 23.060 [21]), the target RNC
shall return a RELOCATION FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value,
e.g. \"Relocation Target not allowed\".
Transmission and reception of a RELOCATION FAILURE message terminate the
procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
When the CN receives a RELOCATION FAILURE message from the target RNC, it
shall stop timer T~RELOCalloc~ and shall assume possibly allocated resources
within the target RNC completely released.
In case of inter-system handover, and if the target RNC supports cell load-
based inter-system handover, then
\- the _NewBSS to Old BSS Information_ IE may be included in the RELOCATION
FAILURE message. This information shall include, if available, the current
traffic load in the target cell.
\- the RELOCATION FAILURE message shall contain the _Cause_ IE with an
appropriate value, e.g. \"No Radio Resources Available in Target Cell\" or
\"Traffic Load In The Target Cell Higher Than In The Source Cell\".
\- If the _Cause_ IE received in the RELOCATION REQUEST message contains the
value \"Reduce Load in Serving Cell\" and the load in the target cell is
greater than in the source cell then, if the target cell is not in a congested
or blocked state, the RNC shall return a RELOCATION FAILURE message which may
include the cause \"Traffic Load In The Target Cell Higher Than In The Source
Cell\".
\- When the RNC returns a RELOCATION FAILURE message with the cause \"Traffic
Load In The Target Cell Higher Than In The Source Cell\", it shall also
include the _NewBSS to Old BSS Information_ IE. This information shall include
the current traffic load in the target cell.
#### 8.7.3.1 Unsuccessful Operation for GERAN Iu-mode
For GERAN Iu-mode and to support Relocation towards a GERAN BSC in Iu mode the
following shall apply in addition for the unsuccessful operation of the
Relocation Resource Allocation procedure:
\- In case a Relocation to GERAN Iu-mode fails (only for CS), because the
Target BSC cannot provide an appropriate RAB corresponding to the content of
the _GERAN BSC Container_ IE (if received), the Target BSC shall report the
unsuccessful Relocation Resource Allocation by indicating the cause value
\"GERAN Iu-mode Failure\" within the RELOCATION FAILURE message and shall
include the _GERAN Classmark_ IE.
### 8.7.4 Abnormal Conditions
If after reception of the RELOCATION REQUEST message, the target RNC receives
another RELOCATION REQUEST message on the same Iu connection, then the target
RNC shall discard the latter message and the original Relocation Resource
Allocation procedure shall continue normally.
If the target RNC receives a _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_
IE containing _Chosen Integrity Protection_ (_Encryption_ respectively)
_Algorithm_ IE without _Integrity Protection_ (_Ciphering_ respectively) _Key_
IE, it shall return a RELOCATION FAILURE message with the cause \"Conflict
with already existing Integrity protection and/or Ciphering information\".
**Interactions with Iu Release procedure:**
If the CN decides to not continue the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure
(e.g. due to T~RELOCalloc~ expiry) before the Relocation Resource Allocation
procedure is completed, the CN shall stop timer T~RELOCalloc~ (if timer
T~RELOCalloc~ has not already expired) and the CN shall, if the Iu signalling
connection has been established or later becomes established, initiate the Iu
Release procedure towards the target RNC with an appropriate value for the
_Cause_ IE, e.g. \"Relocation Cancelled\".
NOTE: In case two CN domains are involved in the Relocation Resource
Allocation procedure, the target RNC may check whether the content of the two
_Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IEs or the two _SNA Access
Information_ IEs is the same. In case the target RNC receives two different
_Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IEs or two different _SNA
Access Information_ IEs, the RNC behaviour is left implementation specific.
### 8.7.5 Co-ordination of Two Iu Signalling Connections
Co-ordination of two Iu signalling connections during Relocation Resource
Allocation procedure shall be executed by the target RNC when the _Number of
Iu Instances_ IE received in the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent
Container_ IE in the RELOCATION REQUEST message indicates that two CN domains
are involved in relocation of SRNS.
When both the CS and PS user data _Chosen Encryption Algorithm_ IE are
received within the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE and if
these two received _Chosen Encryption Algorithm_ IE are not the same, the
target RNC shall fail the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure by sending
back a RELOCATION FAILURE message.
The integrity protection (ciphering respectively) alternatives provided in the
_Integrity Protection Information_ IE (_Encryption Information_ IE
respectively) of the RELOCATION REQUEST messages received from both CN domains
shall have at least one common alternative, otherwise the Relocation Resource
Allocation shall be failed by sending back a RELOCATION FAILURE message.
If two CN domains are involved, the following actions shall be taken by the
target RNC:
\- The target RNC shall utilise the _Permanent NAS UE Identity_ IE, received
explicitly from each CN domain within the RELOCATION REQUEST messages, to co-
ordinate both Iu signalling connections.
\- The target RNC shall generate and send RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
messages only after all expected RELOCATION REQUEST messages are received and
analysed, except for the case where the relocation is to a target CSG cell
where the UE is a non-member of the target CSG, and where there is at least
one of the RABs that has a particular ARP value (see TS 23.060 [21]).
\- In case the SRVCC operation is performed and the source system is E-UTRAN,
the target RNC shall generate and send RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message
to the CN in CS domain if the relocation of SRNS is accepted for the CS domain
but not accepted for the PS domain.
\- If the relocation is to a target CSG cell where the UE is a non-member of
the target CSG, and where there is at least one of the RABs that has a
particular ARP value (see TS 23.060 [21]) in one domain, the target RNC shall
accept those RABs with a particular ARP value (see TS 23.060 [21]) and fail
the other RABs, and send RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE messages without
waiting for the RELOCATION REQUEST message in the other domain.
\- If the target RNC decides to send the _Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent
Container_ IE via the two CN domains, the target RNC shall ensure that the
same _Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container_ IE is included in
RELOCATION REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE messages transmitted via the two CN domains and
related to the same relocation of SRNS.
If the target RNC receives the _UESBI-Iu_ IE on the Iu-CS but not on the Iu-PS
interface (or vice versa), the RNC shall, if supported, use the _UESBI-Iu_ IE
for both domains.
## 8.8 Relocation Detect
### 8.8.1 General
The purpose of the Relocation Detect procedure is to indicate to the CN the
detection by the RNC of an SRNS relocation execution. The procedure shall be
co-ordinated over all Iu signalling connections existing for the UE. The
procedure uses connection-oriented signalling.
### 8.8.2 Successful Operation
Figure 9: Relocation Detect procedure: Successful operation.
The target RNC shall send a RELOCATION DETECT message to the CN when a
relocation execution trigger is received.
If the type of relocation of SRNS is \"UE involved in relocation of SRNS\",
the relocation execution trigger may be received either from the Uu interface
or as an implementation option from the Iur interface. If the type of
relocation of SRNS is \"UE not involved in relocation of SRNS\", the
relocation execution trigger is received from the Iur interface.
When the RELOCATION DETECT message is sent, the target RNC shall start SRNC
operation.
Upon reception of the RELOCATION DETECT message, the CN may switch the user
plane from the source RNC to the target RNC.
### 8.8.3 Abnormal Conditions
**Interactions with Relocation Complete procedure:**
If the RELOCATION COMPLETE message is received by the CN before the reception
of the RELOCATION DETECT message, the CN shall handle the RELOCATION COMPLETE
message normally.
### 8.8.4 Co-ordination of Two Iu Signalling Connections
When the Relocation Detect procedure is to be initiated by the target RNC, the
target RNC shall initiate the Relocation Detect procedure on all Iu signalling
connections existing for the UE between the target RNC and the CN.
## 8.9 Relocation Complete
### 8.9.1 General
The purpose of the Relocation Complete procedure is to indicate to the CN the
completion by the target RNC of the relocation of SRNS . The procedure shall
be co-ordinated over all Iu signalling connections existing for the UE. The
procedure uses connection-oriented signalling.
### 8.9.2 Successful Operation
Figure 10: Relocation Complete procedure. Successful operation.
When the new SRNC-ID and serving RNC Radio Network Temporary Identity are
successfully exchanged with the UE by the radio protocols, the target RNC
shall initiate the Relocation Complete procedure by sending a RELOCATION
COMPLETE message to the CN. Upon reception of the RELOCATION COMPLETE message,
the CN should stop the T~RELOCcomplete~ timer.
If the _Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag_ IE is included in the RELOCATION
COMPLETE message then the CN shall, if supported, use the IE as described in
TS 23.060 [21].
### 8.9.3 Abnormal Conditions
If the timer T~RELOCcomplete~ expires:
\- The CN should initiate release of Iu connections towards the source and the
target RNC by initiating the Iu Release procedure with an appropriate value
for the _Cause_ IE, e.g. \"T~RELOCcomplete~ expiry\".
**Interactions with the Relocation Detect procedure:**
If the RELOCATION DETECT message is not received by the CN before reception of
the RELOCATION COMPLETE message, the CN shall handle the RELOCATION COMPLETE
message normally.
### 8.9.4 Co-ordination of Two Iu Signalling Connections
When the Relocation Complete procedure is to be initiated by the target RNC,
the target RNC shall initiate the Relocation Complete procedure on all Iu
signalling connections existing for the UE between the target RNC and the CN.
## 8.10 Relocation Cancel
### 8.10.1 General
The purpose of the Relocation Cancel procedure is to enable a source RNC to
cancel an ongoing relocation of SRNS. The Relocation Cancel procedure may be
initiated by the source RNC during and after the Relocation Preparation
procedure if either of the following conditions is fulfilled:
1\. The source RNC has not yet initiated the execution of relocation of SRNS,
neither via the Iur interface nor via the Uu interface.
2\. After having initiated the execution of relocation of SRNS, the UE has
returned to the source RNC by transmitting an RRC message which indicates that
the UE considers the source RNC as its serving RNC.
The procedure shall be co-ordinated in all Iu signalling connections for which
the Relocation Preparation procedure has been initiated. The procedure uses
connection oriented signalling.
### 8.10.2 Successful Operation
Figure 11: Relocation Cancel procedure. Successful operation.
The RNC initiates the procedure by sending a RELOCATION CANCEL message to the
CN. This message shall indicate the reason for cancelling the relocation of
SRNS by the appropriate value of the _Cause_ IE. Upon reception of a
RELOCATION CANCEL message, the CN shall send a RELOCATION CANCEL ACKNOWLEDGE
message to the source RNC.
Transmission and reception of a RELOCATION CANCEL ACKNOWLEDGE message
terminate the procedure in the CN and in the source RNC respectively. After
this, the source RNC does not have a prepared relocation for that Iu
signalling connection.
**Interactions with Relocation Preparation procedure:**
Upon reception of a RELOCATION CANCEL message from the source RNC, the CN
shall locally terminate the possibly ongoing Relocation Preparation procedure
towards that RNC and abandon the relocation of SRNS.
If the source RNC receives a RELOCATION COMMAND message from the CN after the
Relocation Cancel procedure is initiated, the source RNC shall ignore the
received RELOCATION COMMAND message.
If the source RNC receives a RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message from the
CN after the Relocation Cancel procedure is initiated, then the source RNC
shall terminate the ongoing Relocation Cancel procedure.
### 8.10.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
### 8.10.4 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
### 8.10.5 Co-ordination of Two Iu Signalling Connections
If the Relocation Cancel procedure is to be initiated due to other reasons
than reception of a RELOCATION PREPARATION FAILURE message, the Relocation
Cancel procedure shall be initiated on all Iu signalling connections existing
for the UE in which the Relocation Preparation procedure has not terminated
unsuccessfully.
## 8.11 SRNS Context Transfer
### 8.11.1 General
The purpose of the SRNS Context Transfer procedure is to trigger the transfer
of SRNS contexts from the source RNC to the CN (PS domain) in case of
intersystem change or in some further cases described in TS 23.060 [21]. The
procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.11.2 Successful Operation
Figure 12: SRNS Context Transfer procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending an SRNS CONTEXT REQUEST message to
the source RNC. The SRNS CONTEXT REQUEST message shall include the list of
RABs whose contexts should be transferred, and may include the _RAT Type_ IE,
when available to indicate the RAT from which the context request originates.
The source RNC shall respond to the CN with an SRNS CONTEXT RESPONSE message
containing all the referenced RABs, including both successful and unsuccessful
RABs transfers. For each RAB whose transfer is successful, the following
context information elements shall be included:
\- _RAB ID_ IE;
\- always when available, the sequence number for the next downlink GTP‑PDU to
be sent to the UE, i.e. the _DL GTP-PDU Sequence Number_ IE;
\- always when available, the sequence number for the next uplink GTP‑PDU to
be tunnelled to the GGSN, i.e. the _UL GTP-PDU Sequence Number_ IE;
\- always when available, the radio interface sequence number (PDCP) TS 25.323
[17] of the next downlink N-PDU (PDCP SDU) that would have been sent to the UE
by a source system, i.e. the _DL N-PDU Sequence Number_ IE;
\- always when available, the radio interface sequence number (PDCP) TS 25.323
[17] of the next uplink N-PDU (PDCP SDU) that would have been expected from
the UE by a source system, i.e. the _UL N-PDU Sequence Number_ IE.
Transmission and reception of the SRNS CONTEXT RESPONSE message terminate the
procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
### 8.11.3 Unsuccessful Operation
For each RAB for which the UTRAN is not able to transfer the RAB context, e.g.
if the RAB ID is unknown to the RNC, the RAB ID is included in the SRNS
CONTEXT RESPONSE message together with a _Cause_ IE, e.g. \"Invalid RAB ID\".
### 8.11.4 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.12 SRNS Data Forwarding Initiation
### 8.12.1 General
The purpose of the SRNS Data Forwarding procedure is to trigger the transfer
of N-PDUs from the RNC to the CN (PS domain) in case of intersystem change or
in some further cases described in TS 23.060 [21]. The procedure uses
connection oriented signalling.
### 8.12.2 Successful Operation
Figure 13: SRNS Data Forwarding Initiation procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending an SRNS DATA FORWARD COMMAND message
to the UTRAN. The SRNS DATA FORWARD COMMAND message includes the list of RABs
towards the PS domain whose data should be forwarded, and the necessary
information for establishing a GTP tunnel to be used for data forwarding. For
each indicated RAB, the list shall include the _RAB ID_ IE, the _Transport
Layer Address_ IE and the _Iu Transport Association_ IE.
Upon reception of the SRNS DATA FORWARD COMMAND message the RNC starts the
timer T~DATAfwd~.
### 8.12.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.13 SRNS Context Forwarding from Source RNC to CN
### 8.13.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer SRNS contexts from the source RNC
to the CN (PS domain) in case of handover via the CN. The procedure uses
connection oriented signalling. SRNS contexts are sent for each concerned RAB
among those that are supported by the target system, and for which at least
either GTP-PDU or PDCP sequence numbering is available. The SRNS contexts
contain the sequence numbers of the next GTP-PDUs to be transmitted in the
uplink and downlink directions, if available, and the next PDCP sequence
numbers that would have been used to send and receive data from the UE, if
available. The Source RNC PDCP context info shall be sent if available.
### 8.13.2 Successful Operation
Figure 14: SRNS Context forwarding from source RNC to CN. Successful
operation.
The source RNC initialises the procedure by sending a FORWARD SRNS CONTEXT
message to the CN. The FORWARD SRNS CONTEXT message contains the RAB Context
information for each referenced RAB. For each RAB the following information
shall be included:
\- _RAB ID_ IE;
\- always when available, the sequence number for the next downlink GTP‑PDU to
be sent to the UE, i.e. the _DL GTP-PDU Sequence Number_ IE;
\- always when available, the sequence number for the next uplink GTP‑PDU to
be tunnelled to the GGSN, i.e. the _UL GTP-PDU Sequence Number_ IE;
\- always when available, the radio interface sequence number (PDCP) TS 25.323
[17] of the next uplink N-PDU (PDCP SDU) that would have been expected from
the UE by a source system i.e. the _UL N-PDU Sequence Number_ IE;
\- always when available, the radio interface sequence number (PDCP) TS 25.323
[17] of the next downlink N-PDU (PDCP SDU) that would have been sent to the UE
by a source system i.e. the _DL N-PDU Sequence Number_ IE.
### 8.13.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.14 SRNS Context Forwarding to Target RNC from CN
### 8.14.1 General
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer SRNS contexts from the CN (PS
domain) to the target RNC in case of handover via the CN. The procedure uses
connection oriented signalling. SRNS contexts are sent for each referenced
RAB, for which at least either GTP-PDU or PDCP sequence numbering is
available. The SRNS contexts contain the sequence numbers of the next GTP-PDUs
to be transmitted in the uplink and downlink directions, if available, and the
next PDCP sequence numbers that would have been used to send and receive data
from the UE, if available. The source RNC PDCP context info shall be sent if
available.
### 8.14.2 Successful Operation
Figure 15: SRNS Context forwarding to target RNC from CN. Successful
operation.
The CN initialises the procedure by sending FORWARD SRNS CONTEXT message to
the target RNC. The FORWARD SRNS CONTEXT message contains the RAB Context
information for each referenced RAB. For each RAB the following information
shall be included:
\- _RAB ID_ IE;
\- always when available, the sequence number for the next downlink GTP‑PDU to
be sent to the UE, i.e. the _DL GTP-PDU Sequence Number_ IE;
\- always when available, the sequence number for the next uplink GTP‑PDU to
be tunnelled to the GGSN, i.e. the _UL GTP-PDU Sequence Number_ IE;
\- always when available, the radio interface sequence number (PDCP) TS 25.323
[17] of the next uplink N-PDU (PDCP SDU) that would have been expected from
the UE by a source system i.e. the _UL N-PDU Sequence Number_ IE;
\- always when available, the radio interface sequence number (PDCP) TS 25.323
[17] of the next downlink N-PDU (PDCP SDU) that would have been sent to the UE
by a source system i.e. the _DL N-PDU Sequence Number_ IE.
### 8.14.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.15 Paging
### 8.15.1 General
The purpose of the Paging procedure is to enable the CN to request the UTRAN
to contact that UE. The procedure uses connectionless signalling.
### 8.15.2 Successful Operation
Figure 16: Paging procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a PAGING message. The PAGING message
shall contain the following IEs:
\- _CN Domain Indicator_
\- _Permanent NAS UE Identity_
> _\- DRX Cycle Length Coefficient_ (if available)
The PAGING message may contain following IEs:
\- _Temporary UE Identity_
\- _Paging Area_
\- _Paging Cause_
> \- _Non Searching Indication_
>
> _\- Global CN-ID_
>
> _\- CSG Id List_
The _CN Domain Indicator_ IE shall be used by the RNC to identify from which
CN domain the paging request originates.
The _Permanent NAS UE Identity_ IE (i.e. IMSI) shall be used by the UTRAN
paging co-ordination function to check if a signalling connection towards the
other CN domain already exists for this UE. In that case, the radio interface
paging message shall be sent via that connection instead of using the paging
broadcast channel.
The _Temporary UE Identity_ IE (e.g. TMSI) is the temporary identity of the
user (allocated by that CN Domain) which can be used in a radio interface
paging message. If the _Temporary UE Identity_ IE is not included in the
PAGING message, the RNC shall use the _Permanent NAS UE Identity_ instead --
if no signalling connection exists.
If NNSF is active, and the _Temporary UE Identity_ IE is not included in the
PAGING message, the PAGING message shall include the _Global CN-ID_ IE and, in
case this PAGING message is originated from the CS domain, the RNC may start
the T ~NNSF~ timer and store the _Permanent NAS UE Identity_ IE along with the
related _Global CN-ID_ IE until the T ~NNSF~ timer has expired _._
The _Paging Area_ IE shall be used by the RNC to identify the area in which
the radio interface paging message shall be broadcast in case no signalling
connection, as described above, already exists for the UE. If the _Paging
Area_ IE is not included in the PAGING message, the whole RNC area shall be
used as Paging Area -- if no signalling connection exists for that UE.
The _Paging Cause_ IE shall indicate to the RNC the reason for sending the
PAGING message. The paging cause is transferred transparently to the UE.
The _Non Searching Indication_ IE shall, if present, be used by the RNC to
decide whether the UTRAN paging co-ordination function needs to be activated
or not. In the absence of this IE, UTRAN paging co-ordination shall be
performed.
The _DRX Cycle Length Coefficient_ IE may be included in the PAGING message,
and if present, the UTRAN shall, when applicable, use it for calculating the
paging occasions for the UE.
A list of CSG IDs may be included in the PAGING message. If included, the
UTRAN may use the list of CSG IDs to avoid paging the UE at CSG cells whose
CSG ID does not appear in the list.
It should be noted that each PAGING message on the Iu interface relates to
only one UE and therefore the RNC has to pack the pages into the relevant
radio interface paging message.
The core network is responsible for the paging repetition over the Iu
interface.
### 8.15.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.16 Common ID
### 8.16.1 General
The purpose of the Common ID procedure is to inform the RNC about the
permanent NAS UE Identity (i.e. IMSI) of a user. This is used by the RNC e.g.
to create a reference between the permanent NAS UE identity of the user and
the RRC connection of that user for UTRAN paging co-ordination. The procedure
may also be used to provide the _SNA Access Information_ IE to the RNC or to
provide the _Management Based MDT Allowed_ IE to the RNC.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.16.2 Successful Operation
Figure 17: Common ID procedure. Successful operation.
After having established an Iu signalling connection, and if the Permanent NAS
UE identity (i.e. IMSI) is available, the CN shall send to the RNC a COMMON ID
message containing the _Permanent NAS UE Identity_ IE and optionally the _SNA
Access Information_ IE. The COMMON ID message may also include the _UESBI-Iu_
IE. The RNC shall associate the permanent identity to the RRC Connection of
that user and shall save it for the duration of the RRC connection.
The RNC shall, if supported, use the _UESBI-Iu_ IE when received in the COMMON
ID message.
If the _CSG Membership Status_ IE is included in the COMMON ID message the RAN
shall, if supported, take the following actions:
  * If the cell that serves the UE is a Hybrid cell, the RNC shall store the value contained in the _CSG Membership Status_ IE and replace any previously stored memberhip status value by this new one. The RNC may use such information to perform differentiated treatment for member and non-member UEs.
  * If the cell that serves the UE is a CSG cell, and the _CSG Membership Status_ IE is set to "non-member", the RNC should initiate actions to ensure that the UE is no longer served by the CSG cell as defined in TS 25.467 [55].
If the _SNA Access Information_ IE is contained in the COMMON ID message, the
RNC shall store this information and use it to determine whether the UE has
access to radio resources in the UTRAN. The RNC shall consider that the UE is
authorised to access only the PLMNs identified by the _PLMN identity_ IEs in
the _SNA Access Information_ IE. If the _Authorised SNAs_ IE is included for a
given PLMN (identified by the _PLMN identity_ IE), then the RNC shall consider
that the access to radio resources for the concerned UE is restricted to the
LAs contained in the SNAs identified by the _SNAC_ IEs.
**In case of GWCN configuration for a network sharing non-supporting UE, the
COMMON ID message shall include, if available, the** _Selected PLMN identity_
IE**. If received, the RNC shall store this information.**
**In case SRVCC functionality is supported by the UE and CN, the CN shall
include _SRVCC Operation Possible_ IE in COMMON ID message.**
**If the _Management Based MDT Allowed_ IE is included in the the COMMON ID
message, the RNC shall use it, if supported, to allow subsequent selection of
the UE for management based MDT as defined in TS 32.422 [38].**
Upon receipt of the COMMON ID message the RNC shall
\- store the Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority IE and use it as
defined in TS 36.300 [52].
### 8.16.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.17 CN Invoke Trace
### 8.17.1 General
When used for signalling based activation, the purpose of the CN Invoke Trace
procedure is to inform the RNC that it should begin a trace session with the
parameters indicated by the CN and related to the UE, the Iu connection is
used for.
When used for management based activation, the purpose of the CN Invoke Trace
procedure is to provide the RNC with the equipment identity of the UE for
which the RNC should begin a trace recording session.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.17.2 Successful Operation
Figure 18: CN Invoke Trace procedure. Successful operation.
The CN Invoke Trace procedure is invoked by the CN by sending a CN INVOKE
TRACE message to the RNC as defined in TS 32.422 [38].
The CN INVOKE TRACE message shall include the following IEs:
\- The _Trace Reference_ IE, which uniquely identifies the trace session it
refers to.
\- The _UE Identity_ IE, which indicates the UE to which this trace session
pertains.
\- The _Trace Propagation Parameters_ IE, only in case of a signalling based
activation.
If present, the _Trace Propagation Parameters_ IE shall include the following
IEs:
\- The _Trace Recording Session Reference_ IE, which is allocated by the CN.
\- The _Trace Depth_ IE, which defines how detailed information should be
recorded for this trace session in the RNC.
The _Trace Propagation Parameters_ IE may also include the _List Of Interfaces
To Trace_ IE, which defines which interfaces should be traced in the RNC. If
the _List Of Interfaces To Trace_ IE is not included, the RNC should trace all
the following interfaces, if available: Iu-CS, Iu-PS, Uu, Iur and Iub.
Upon receiving the CN INVOKE TRACE message, which includes the _Trace
Propagation Parameters_ IE, the RNC should begin a trace recording session
according to the parameters indicated in the CN INVOKE TRACE message. If the
RNC does not support the requested value \"Minimum\" or \"Medium\" of the
_Trace Depth_ IE, the RNC should begin a trace recording session with maximum
trace depth.
Upon receiving the CN INVOKE TRACE message, which does not include the _Trace
Propagation Parameters_ IE, the RNC should begin a trace recording session
according to the parameters configured in the RNC for the indicated equipment
identity in the CN INVOKE TRACE message.
The RNC may not start a trace recording session if there are insufficient
resources available within the RNC.
The _Trace Reference IE, UE identity_ IE and, if the _Trace Propagation
Parameters_ IE is present, the _Trace Recording Session Reference_ IE are used
to tag the trace record to allow simpler construction of the total record by
the entity which combines trace records.
If the _MDT Configuration_ IE is included in the CN INVOKE TRACE message and
includes the _MDT Activation_ IE set to "Immediate MDT and Trace" then the RNC
shall, if supported, initiate the requested trace function and MDT function as
described in TS 32.422 [38].
If the _MDT Configuration_ IE is included in the CN INVOKE TRACE message and
includes the _MDT Activation_ IE set to to "Immediate MDT Only" or "Logged MDT
only", then the RNC shall, if supported, initiate the requested MDT function
as described in TS 32.422 [38] and shall ignore the _List of Interfaces to
Trace_ IE and the _Trace Depth_ IE.
If _Trace Collection Entity IP Address_ IE is included and if the _MDT
Configuration_ IE is also included then the RNC shall, if supported, store the
Trace Collection Entity IP address and use it when transferring Trace records,
otherwise if _MDT Configuration_ IE is not included, the RNC may use the Trace
Collection Entity IP address when transferring trace records.
**[Interaction with Relocation and Enhanced Relocation:]{.underline}**
In case of signalling based activation, the order to perform tracing is lost
in UTRAN at successful Relocation of SRNS. If the tracing shall continue also
after the relocation has been performed, the CN Invoke Trace procedure shall
thus be re-initiated from the CN towards the future SRNC after the Relocation
Resource Allocation or the Enhanced Relocation procedure has been executed
successfully.
#### 8.17.2.1 Successful Operation for GERAN Iu mode
The CN INVOKE TRACE message shall include the _Trace Type_ IE to indicate the
events and parameters to be recorded.
The message shall include a _Trace Reference_ IE which is allocated by the
entity which triggered the trace.
The message may include the _OMC ID_ IE, which if present, indicates the OMC
to which the record is destined.
The message may include the UE Identity IE, which if present, indicates the UE
to which this record pertains to.
The message may include the _Trigger ID_ IE, which if present, indicates the
entity which triggered the trace.
The _Trace Reference_ and _Trigger ID_ IEs are used to tag the trace record to
allow simpler construction of the total record by the entity which combines
trace records.
### 8.17.3 Abnormal Conditions
If the _MDT Configuration_ IE is included in the CN INVOKE TRACE message and
the _Trace Collection Entity IP Address_ IE is not included, the RNC shall
ignore the MDT Configuration.
#### 8.17.3.1 Abnormal Conditions for GERAN Iu mode
Not applicable.
## 8.18 Security Mode Control
### 8.18.1 General
The purpose of the Security Mode Control procedure is to pass ciphering and
integrity mode information to the UTRAN. The UTRAN uses this information to
select and load the encryption device for user and signalling data with the
appropriate parameters, and also to store the appropriate parameters for the
integrity algorithm. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.18.2 Successful Operation
Figure 19: Security Mode Control procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message. The
message may contain the _Encryption Information_ IE and shall contain the
_Integrity Protection Information_ IE, specifying, in preferred order with the
most preferred first in the list, which ciphering, if any, and integrity
protection algorithms may be used by the UTRAN.
The _Permitted Encryption Algorithms_ IE within the _Encryption Information
IE_ may contain \"no encryption\" within an element of its list in order to
allow the RNC not to cipher the respective connection. This can be done either
by not starting ciphering or by using the UEA0 algorithm. In the absence of
the _Encryption Information_ group IE in SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the
RNC shall not start ciphering.
Upon reception of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UTRAN shall
internally select appropriate algorithms, taking into account the UE/UTRAN
capabilities. If a signalling connection already exists towards the other core
network domain and integrity has been started, the same ciphering and
integrity alternatives as being used for that core network domain shall be
selected. If a signalling connection already exists towards the other core
network domain and the Security Mode Control procedure is ongoing on that core
network domain, the same ciphering and integrity alternative shall be selected
for the two domains. This means in particular for encryption that if \"no
encryption\" or no _Encryption Information_ IE has been received from the
first core network domain and integrity has been started but ciphering has not
been started, ciphering shall also not be started for the second core network
domain. The UTRAN shall then trigger the execution of the corresponding radio
interface procedure and, if applicable, start/restart the encryption device
and also start/modify the integrity protection.
The CN may send a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message towards the RNC also when
integrity protection and possibly ciphering has already been started for an
existing signalling connection towards that core network domain. This may be
used to activate new integrity protection and ciphering keys. The included
integrity protection and ciphering information shall then support (at least)
the integrity protection alternative and the ciphering alternative presently
being used and the _Key Status_ IE shall have the value \"New\".
When the execution of the radio interface procedure is successfully finished,
the UTRAN shall return a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message to the CN. This
message shall include the _Chosen Integrity Protection Algorithm_ IE and may
include the _Chosen Encryption Algorithm_ IE.
The _Chosen Encryption_ _Algorithm_ IE shall be included in the SECURITY MODE
COMPLETE message if, and only if the _Encryption Information_ IE was included
in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
The set of permitted algorithms specified in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
shall remain applicable for subsequent RAB Assignments and Intra-UTRAN
Relocations.
In case of a UE with Radio Access Bearers towards both core networks, the user
data towards CS shall always be ciphered with the ciphering key received from
CS and the user data towards PS with the ciphering key received from PS. The
signalling data shall always be ciphered with the last received ciphering key
and integrity protected with the last received integrity protection key from
any of the two CNs.
### 8.18.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 20: Security Mode Control procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the UTRAN or the UE is unable to support the ciphering and/or integrity
protection algorithms specified in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, then the
UTRAN shall return to the CN a SECURITY MODE REJECT message with cause value
\"Requested Ciphering and/or Integrity Protection Algorithms not Supported\".
If the radio interface Security Mode Control procedure fails, a SECURITY MODE
REJECT message shall be sent to the CN with cause value \"Failure in the Radio
Interface Procedure\".
### 8.18.4 Abnormal Conditions
If, when establishing a signalling connection towards a second core network
domain, the integrity has already been started by the first domain and the
integrity protection and ciphering information specified in the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message does not support the integrity protection alternative and the
ciphering alternative presently being used, a SECURITY MODE REJECT message
shall be sent to the second core network domain with cause value \"Conflict
with already existing Integrity protection and/or Ciphering information\".
If, upon reception of a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message from a core network
domain with an already existing signalling connection from that core network
domain and for which integrity protection and possibly ciphering have already
been started, the _Key Status_ IE has the value \"Old\", a SECURITY MODE
REJECT message shall be returned with cause value \"Conflict with already
existing Integrity protection and/or Ciphering information\".
If, upon reception of a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message from a core network
domain with an already existing signalling connection and for which integrity
protection and possibly ciphering have already been started, the included
integrity protection and ciphering information does not support the integrity
protection alternative and the ciphering alternative presently being used, a
SECURITY MODE REJECT message shall be returned with cause value \"Conflict
with already existing Integrity protection and/or Ciphering information\".
## 8.19 Location Reporting Control
### 8.19.1 General
The purpose of the Location Reporting Control procedure is to allow the CN to
request information on the location and optionally velocity of a given UE. The
procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.19.2 Successful Operation
Figure 21: Location Reporting Control procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL
message.
The _Request Type_ IE shall indicate to the serving RNC whether:
\- to report directly;
\- to stop a direct report;
\- to report periodically;
\- to stop periodic reporting;
\- to report upon change of Service area, or
\- to stop reporting at change of Service Area.
If reporting upon change of Service Area is requested, the Serving RNC shall
report whenever the UE moves between Service Areas. For this procedure, only
Service Areas that are defined for the PS and CS domains shall be considered.
The _Request Type_ IE shall also indicate what type of location information
the serving RNC shall report. The location information is either of the
following types:
\- Service Area Identifier, or
\- Geographical area, including geographical coordinates with or without
requested accuracy. If the _Vertical Accuracy Code_ IE is included, the
_Accuracy Code_ IE in the _Request Type_ IE shall be present. The _Accuracy
Code_ IE shall be understood as the horizontal accuracy code.
A request for a direct report or for periodic reporting can be done in
parallel with having an active request to report upon change of Service Area
for the same UE. The request to report upon change of Service Area shall not
be affected by this.
Any of the _Vertical Accuracy Code_ IE, _Response Time_ IE _, Positioning
Priority_ IE, _Client Type_ IE or _Periodic Location Info_ IE shall be
included according to the following rules:
\- Vertical Accuracy Code shall be included, if available, in connection with
Geographical Area,
\- Response time shall be included, if available, in connection with request
for start of direct reporting of Geographical Area,
\- Client type shall be included in connection with request for start of
direct reporting of Geographical Area and, if available, in request for direct
reporting of SAI or periodic reporting,
\- Positioning Priority shall be included, if available, in connection with
request for start of direct reporting or in connection with request for start
of reporting upon change of Service Area,
\- Periodic Location Info shall be included in connection with a request for
start of periodic reporting of Geographical Area.
When no _Positioning Priority_ IE is included, the RNC shall consider the
request as if \"Normal Priority\" value had been received.
When no _Response Time_ IE is included, the RNC shall consider the request as
if \"Delay Tolerant\" value had been received.
**[Interaction with Relocation and Enhanced Relocation:]{.underline}**
The order to perform location reporting at change of Service Area is lost in
UTRAN at successful Relocation of SRNS. If the location reporting at change of
Service Area shall continue also after the relocation has been performed, the
Location Reporting Control procedure shall thus be re-initiated from the CN
towards the future SRNC after the Relocation Resource Allocation procedure or
the Enhanced Relocation procedure has been executed successfully.
### 8.19.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.20 Location Report
### 8.20.1 General
The purpose of the Location Report procedure is to provide the UE\'s location
and optionally velocity information to the CN. The procedure uses connection
oriented signalling.
### 8.20.2 Successful Operation
Figure 22: Location Report procedure. Successful operation.
The serving RNC initiates the procedure by generating a LOCATION REPORT
message. The LOCATION REPORT message may be used as a response to a LOCATION
REPORTING CONTROL message. Also, when a user enters or leaves a classified
zone set by O&M, e.g. a zone where a disaster has occurred, a LOCATION REPORT
message including the Service Area of the UE in the _Area Identity_ IE shall
be sent to the CN. The _Cause_ IE shall indicate the appropriate cause value
to the CN, e.g. \"User Restriction Start Indication\" and \"User Restriction
End Indication\". The CN shall react to the LOCATION REPORT message with CN
vendor specific actions.
For this procedure, only Service Areas that are defined for the PS and CS
domains shall be considered.
In case reporting at change of Service Area is requested by the CN, then the
RNC shall issue a LOCATION REPORT message:
\- whenever the information given in the previous LOCATION REPORT message or
INITIAL UE MESSAGE message is not anymore valid.
\- upon receipt of the first LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message following a
Relocation Resource Allocation procedure, with the _Event_ IE included in the
_Request Type_ IE set to \"Change of Service Area\", as soon as SAI becomes
available in the new SRNC and the relocation procedure has been successfully
completed.
In case a Service Area is reported, the RNC shall include in the _Area
Identity_ IE of the LOCATION REPORT message a Service Area that includes at
least one of the cells from which the UE is consuming radio resources.
In case the LOCATION REPORT message is sent as an answer to a request for a
direct report, for periodic reporting or for reports at a change of Service
Area, the _Request Type_ IE from the LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message shall
be included.
If the LOCATION REPORT message is sent as an answer to a request for a direct
report of Service Area and the current Service Area can not be determined by
the RNC, then the _Area Identity_ IE shall be omitted and a cause value shall
be included to indicate that the request could not be fulfilled, e.g.
\"Requested Information Not Available\" or \"Location Reporting Congestion\".
The RNC may also include the _Last Known Service Area_ IE.
If the RNC can not deliver the location information as requested by the CN,
due to either the non-support of the requested event or the non-support of the
requested report area, or if the RNC is currently not able to reach the UE,
the RNC shall indicate the UE location to be \"Undetermined\" by omitting the
_Area Identity_ IE. A cause value shall instead be added to indicate the
reason for the undetermined location, e.g. \"Requested Request Type not
supported\", \"Location Reporting Congestion\" or \"No Resource Available\".
In case of periodic reporting is requested by the CN, the RNC shall issue the
first LOCATION REPORT message one reporting interval as indicated in the
_Reporting Interval_ IE contained in the LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message
after reception of the LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message and continue to send
LOCATION REPORT messages one reporting interval after the previous LOCATION
REPORT message until the desired amount of reports as given in the _Reporting
Amount_ IE has been attained, or until the periodic reporting is canceled by
the CN or aborted by the RNC. When no location estimate is available at the
RNC when the reporting criteria are fulfilled (e.g., due to failure of a
position method itself), the RNC shall indicate the UE location to be
\"Undetermined\" by omitting the _Area Identity_ IE. A cause value shall
instead be added to indicate the reason for the undetermined location, e.g.
\"Periodic Location Information not Available\".
If the Location Report procedure was triggered by a LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL
message, which included a request to report a geographical area with a
specific accuracy, the LOCATION REPORT message shall include:
\- the _Geographical Area_ IE within the _Area Identity_ IE containing either
a point with indicated uncertainty or a polygon or an other type, which
fulfils the requested accuracy, and
\- the _Accuracy Fulfilment Indicator_ IE with the value \"requested accuracy
fulfilled\".
If the Location Report procedure was triggered by a LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL
message, which included a request to report with a geographical area and
whenever one of the geographic area shapes _Ellipsoid point with uncertainty
Ellipse_ IE, _Ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty Ellipsoid_ IE or
_Ellipsoid Arc_ IE is reported, the _Confidence_ IE shall indicate the
probability that the UE is located within the uncertainty region of the shape.
The value of the _Confidence_ IE shall be in the interval of \"1\" to \"100\".
If any of the requested accuracy cannot be fulfilled, the LOCATION REPORT
message shall include:
\- the _Geographical Area_ IE within the _Area Identity_ IE containing either
a point with indicated uncertainty or a polygon or an other type, with the
best possible accuracy, and
\- the _Accuracy Fulfilment Indicator_ IE with the value \"requested accuracy
not fulfilled\".
If the _Confidence_ IE received from the UE has value \"0\", the RNC shall
consider the requested accuracy as not fulfilled and if the received position
is reported or forwarded then the confidence and uncertainty shape shall not
be included (i.e. either the _Point_ IE or the _Ellipsoid point with altitude_
IE shall be used).
If, on the other hand, no specific accuracy level was requested in the
LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL message, the LOCATION REPORT message shall include
the _Geographical Area_ IE within the _Area Identity_ IE, the reported
_Geographical Area_ IE may include an accuracy.
The LOCATION REPORT message shall also include, if available, the _Position
Data_ IE containing the positioning method (or list of positioning methods)
used successfully to obtain the location estimate, together with the usage
information.
If the Location Report procedure was triggered by a LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL
message which included a request to report with a geographical area and in
which the _IncludeVelocity_ IE was set to \"requested\", the LOCATION REPORT
message shall include a _Velocity Estimate IE, if available and if the
handling of velocity is supported by the RNC._
If the Location Report procedure was triggered by a LOCATION REPORTING CONTROL
message, which included a request to report with a geographical area and in
which the _Client Type_ IE was not included, the RNC shall answer with the
_Point_ IE, or the _Point With Uncertainty_ IE or the _Polygon_ IE within the
_Geographical Area_ IE of the LOCATION REPORT message.
### 8.20.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.21 Data Volume Report
### 8.21.1 General
The Data Volume Report procedure is used by CN to request the unsuccessfully
transmitted DL data volume for specific RABs. This procedure only applies to
the PS domain. The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
NOTE: In line with TS32.240 [61], this procedure is not used and the RNC
should ignore a DATA VOLUME REPORT REQUEST message if received.
### 8.21.2 Successful Operation
Figure 23: Data Volume Report procedure. Successful operation.
The procedure is initiated by CN by sending DATA VOLUME REPORT REQUEST message
to UTRAN. This message shall contain the list of _RAB ID_ IEs to identify the
RABs for which the unsuccessfully transmitted DL data volume shall be
reported.
At reception of a DATA VOLUME REPORT REQUEST message, the UTRAN shall produce
a DATA VOLUME REPORT message. For each RAB successfully addressed within the
_RAB Data Volume Report List_ IE of the DATA VOLUME REPORT REQUEST message,
the DATA VOLUME REPORT message shall include in the _Unsuccessfully
Transmitted DL Data Volume_ IE the amount of unsuccessfully transmitted DL
data since the last data volume reported to the CN for the RAB and with the
same data volume reference, if present. The message may also contain the _Data
Volume Reference_ IE.
The message may contain for each RAB successfully addressed a maximum of two
_RAB Data Volume Report Item_ IEs within the _RAB Data Volume Report List_ IE
for the case when there is a need to report two different data volumes since
the last data volume indication to the CN. The UTRAN shall also reset the data
volume counter for the reported RABs. The UTRAN shall send the DATA VOLUME
REPORT message to the CN. Transmission and reception of the DATA VOLUME REPORT
message terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
The _Data Volume Reference_ IE, if included, indicates the time when the data
volume is counted.
### 8.21.3 Unsuccessful Operation
The _RAB ID_ IE for each RAB for which UTRAN is not able to transfer a data
volume report is included in the DATA VOLUME REPORT message together with a
_Cause_ IE, e.g. \"Invalid RAB ID\".
### 8.21.4 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.22 Initial UE Message
### 8.22.1 General
The purpose of the Initial UE Message procedure is to establish an Iu
signalling connection between a CN domain and the RNC and to transfer the
initial NAS-PDU to the CN node as determined by the NAS Node Selection
Function - if this function is active, or otherwise to the default CN node- or
by the Rerouting Function (see TS 25.410 [2]) in case of MOCN configuration.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.22.2 Successful Operation
Figure 24: Initial UE Message procedure. Successful operation.
When the RNC has received from radio interface a NAS message (see TS 24.008
[8]) to be forwarded to a CN domain to which no Iu signalling connection for
the UE exists, the RNC shall initiate the Initial UE Message procedure and
send the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message to the CN. If NNSF is active, the
selection of the CN node is made according to TS 23.236 [26].
In addition to the received NAS-PDU, the RNC shall add the following
information to the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message:
\- CN domain indicator, indicating the CN domain towards which this message is
sent.
\- For CS domain, the LAI which is the last LAI indicated to the UE by the
UTRAN via the current RRC connection, or if the UTRAN has not yet indicated
any LAI to the UE via the current RRC connection, then the LAI of the cell via
which the current RRC connection was established.
\- For PS domain, the LAI+RAC which are the last LAI+RAC indicated to the UE
by UTRAN via the current RRC connection, or if the UTRAN has not yet indicated
any LAI+RAC to the UE via the current RRC connection, then the LAI+RAC of the
cell via which the current RRC connection was established.
\- Service Area corresponding to at least one of the cells from which the UE
is consuming radio resources.
\- Iu signalling connection identifier.
\- Global RNC identifier.
\- Selected PLMN Identity, if received from radio interface by a network
sharing supporting UE in shared networks.
\- Redirect Attempt Flag, in MOCN configuration for a network sharing non
supporting UE in order to indicate that the CN should respond with a
Redirection Indication IE or a Redirection Completed IE.
The _Iu Signalling Connection Identifier_ IE contains an Iu signalling
connection identifier which is allocated by the RNC. The value for the _Iu
Signalling Connection Identifier_ IE shall be allocated so as to uniquely
identify an Iu signalling connection for the RNC. The CN should store and
remember this identifier for the duration of the Iu connection.
Whereas several processing entities within the CN (e.g. charging,
interception, etc.) may make use of the location information given in the
_SAI_ IE and the _LAI_ (and _RAC for PS domain_) IE, the mobility management
within the CN shall rely on the information given within the _LAI_ IE
(respectively _LAI_ and _RAC_ IEs for PS domain) only.
If the establishment of the Iu signalling connection towards the CN is
performed due to an RRC connection establishment originating from a CSG cell
and if the UE is CSG capable, the _CSG Id_ IE shall be included in the INITIAL
UE MESSAGE message.
If the establishment of the Iu signalling connection towards the CN is
performed due to an RRC connection establishment originating from a Hybrid
cell and if the UE is CSG capable, the _CSG Id_ IE and _Cell Access Mode_ IE
shall be included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message.
If the RNC has a co-located L-GW, it shall include the _L-GW Transport Layer
Address_ IE in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message.
If the _Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag_ IE is included in the INITIAL UE
MESSAGE message then the CN shall, if supported, use the IE as described in TS
23.060 [21].
**Interaction with Direct Transfer procedure**
In MOCN configuration, if the RNC receives the _Redirection Indication_ IE in
the DIRECT TRANSFER message from a CN node which is not the last attempted, it
shall initiate the Initial UE Message procedure towards another CN operator
when possible (or possibly to the same CN in case when CS/PS coordination is
required), with the following additional information in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE
message:
\- _NAS Sequence Number_ IE, if received from previously attempted CN
operator;
\- _Permanent NAS UE Identity_ IE, if received from one of previously
attempted CN operators.
#### 8.22.2.1 Successful Operation for GERAN Iu-mode
For GERAN Iu-mode, the following shall apply in addition for the successful
operation of the Initial UE Message procedure:
\- In case of establishment of a signalling connection towards the CS domain
in GERAN Iu-mode, the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message shall contain the _GERAN
Classmark_ IE in order to provide the CN with GERAN-specific information (see
TS 43.051 [27]).
## 8.23 Direct Transfer
### 8.23.1 General
The purpose of the Direct Transfer procedure is to carry UE -- CN signalling
messages over the Iu Interface. The UE ‑ CN signalling messages are not
interpreted by the UTRAN, and their content (e.g. MM or CC message) is outside
the scope of this specification (see TS 24.008 [8]). The UE -- CN signalling
messages are transported as a parameter in the DIRECT TRANSFER messages. The
procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.23.2 Successful Operation
#### 8.23.2.1 CN Originated Direct Transfer
Figure 25: Direct Transfer, CN originated. Successful operation.
If a UE - CN signalling message has to be sent from the CN to the UE, the CN
shall send a DIRECT TRANSFER message to the RNC including the UE \- CN
signalling message as a _NAS-PDU_ IE.
If the DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent in the downlink direction, it shall
include the _SAPI_ IE and shall not include the _LAI_ \+ _RAC_ IE and the
_SAI_ IE. The use of the _SAPI_ IE included in the DIRECT TRANSFER message
enables the UTRAN to provide specific service for the transport of the
included NAS message.
Upon receipt of the DIRECT TRANSFER message the RNC shall
\- store the Subscriber Profile ID for RAT/Frequency priority IE and use it as
defined in TS 36.300 [52].
**[In case of rerouting in MOCN configuration:]{.underline}**
If the CN can serve the network sharing non-supporting UE, the _NAS-PDU_ IE -
i.e. the accept NAS message - and the _Redirection completed_ IE shall be
included in the DIRECT TRANSFER message for the downlink direction.
If the CN cannot serve the network sharing non-supporting UE, the _NAS-PDU_ IE
- i.e. the reject NAS message - and a _Redirection Indication_ IE shall be
included in the DIRECT TRANSFER message for the downlink direction.
If the CN can serve the network sharing non-supporting UE, but CS/PS
coordination is required, the _NAS-PDU_ IE - i.e. the reject NAS message \-
and a _Redirection Indication_ IE shall be included in the DIRECT TRANSFER
message for the downlink direction.
The _Redirection Indication_ IE shall contain:
\- The _initial NAS-PDU_ IE received from the UE;
\- The _Reject Cause Value_ IE;
\- The _NAS Sequence Number_ IE, if available for CS;
\- The Permanent NAS UE Identity IE, if available.
Upon reception of the downlink DIRECT TRANSFER message including the
_Redirection Indication_ IE, the RNC shall store as part of the Rerouting
Function the associated _Reject Cause Value_ IE and _NAS-PDU_ IE related to
this CN. In case the _Reject Cause Value_ IE is set to \"CS/PS coordination
required\", then the RNC shall perform CS/PS coordination based on the
received _Permanent NAS UE Identity_ IE. In this case the _Reject Cause Value_
IE and the associated _NAS-PDU_ IE shall not be stored.
In case all attempted CN operators have replied with the _Redirection
Indication_ IE, the RNC shall select the most appropriate NAS-PDU among the
_NAS-PDU_ IEs received from the attempted CN nodes based on the stored
information as part of the Rerouting function and send it back to the UE.
Upon reception of the downlink DIRECT TRANSFER message including the
_Redirection Completed_ IE, the RNC shall send back the included NAS-PDU IE to
the UE and terminate the Rerouting Function.
#### 8.23.2.2 UTRAN Originated Direct Transfer
Figure 26: Direct Transfer, RNC originated. Successful operation.
If a UE - CN signalling message has to be sent from the RNC to the CN without
interpretation, the RNC shall send a DIRECT TRANSFER message to the CN
including the UE - CN signalling message as a _NAS-PDU_ IE.
If the DIRECT TRANSFER message shall be sent to the PS domain, the RNC shall
also add the _LAI_ and the _RAC_ IEs, which were the last LAI + RAC indicated
to the UE by the UTRAN via the current RRC connection, or if the UTRAN had not
yet indicated any LAI + RAC to the UE via the current RRC connection, then the
LAI + RAC of the cell via which the current RRC connection was established. If
the DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent to the PS domain, the RNC shall also add a
Service Area corresponding to at least one of the cells from which the UE is
consuming radio resources. If the DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent in uplink
direction, the RNC shall not include the _SAPI_ IE.
If the RNC has a co-located L-GW, it shall include the _L-GW Transport Layer
Address_ IE in the DIRECT TRANSFER message.
### 8.23.3 Abnormal Conditions
If the DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent by the RNC to the PS domain, and any of
the _LAI_ IE, _RAC_ IE or _SAI_ IE is missing, the CN shall continue with the
Direct Transfer procedure, ignoring the missing IE.
If the DIRECT TRANSFER message is sent by the CN to the RNC without the _SAPI_
IE, the RNC shall continue with the Direct Transfer procedure.
## 8.24 Void
## 8.25 Overload Control
### 8.25.1 General
This procedure is defined to give some degree of signalling flow control. At
the UTRAN side, \"Processor Overload\" and \"Overload in the Capability to
Send Signalling Messages to the UE\" are catered for, and at the CN side,
\"Processor Overload\" is catered for. The procedure uses connectionless
signalling.
The philosophy used is to stem the traffic at source with known effect on the
service. The algorithm used is:
At the CN side:
\- If T~igOC~ is not running and an OVERLOAD message or \"Signalling Point
Congested\" information is received, the traffic should be reduced by one
step. It is also possible, optionally, to indicate the number of steps to
reduce the traffic within the _Number of Steps_ IE. At the same time, timers
T~igOC~ and T~inTC~ should be started.
\- During T~igOC~ all received OVERLOAD messages or \"Signalling Point
Congested\" information should be ignored.
\- This step by step reduction of traffic should be continued until maximum
reduction is obtained by arriving at the last step.
\- If T~inTC~ expires, the traffic should be increased by one step and T~inTC~
should be re-started unless the number of steps by which the traffic is
reduced is back to zero.
At the UTRAN side:
\- If T~igOR~ is not running and an OVERLOAD message not including the
_Priority Class Indicator_ IE or \"Signalling Point Congested\" information is
received, all the traffic should be reduced by one step. It is also possible,
optionally, to indicate the number of steps to reduce the traffic within the
_Number of Steps_ IE. At the same time, timers T~igOR~ and T~inTR~ should be
started.
\- If T~igOR~ is not running and an OVERLOAD message including the _Priority
Class Indicator_ IE is received and a procedure for reduction of all traffic
is not being processed , then signalling traffic for the indicated priority
class should be reduced by one step. It is also possible, optionally, to
indicate the number of steps to reduce the traffic within the _Number of
Steps_ IE. At the same time, timers T~igOR~ and T~inTR~ should be started.
\- During T~igOR~ all received OVERLOAD messages or \"Signalling Point
Congested\" information should be ignored.
\- This step-by-step reduction of traffic should be continued until maximum
reduction is obtained by arriving at the last step.
\- If T~inTR~ expires, the traffic should be increased by one step and T~inTR~
should be re-started unless the number of steps by which the traffic is
reduced is back to zero.
The number of steps and the method for reducing the load are implementation-
specific.
There may be other traffic control mechanisms from O&M activities occurring
simultaneously.
### 8.25.2 Philosophy
Void.
### 8.25.3 Successful Operation
#### 8.25.3.1 Overload at the CN
Figure 27: Overload at the CN. Successful operation.
The CN should indicate to the RNC that it is in a congested state by sending
an OVERLOAD message. The _CN Domain Indicator_ IE may be included, if the CN
can determine the domain suffering from the signalling traffic overload. A
specific CN node shall send this message only towards those RNCs from which it
can receive the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message.
Reception of the message by the UTRAN should cause reduction of signalling
traffic towards the CN. If the _CN Domain Indicator_ IE is included in the
OVERLOAD message, and the _Global CN-ID_ IE is not, the RNC should apply
signalling traffic reduction mechanisms towards the indicated domain. If the
_Priority Class Indicator_ IE is included then the RNC should take the
appropriate action to reduce the traffic for the priority class indicated in
the IE.
If the NNSF is active, the CN shall include the _Global CN-ID_ IE within the
OVERLOAD message, and the RNC should apply signalling traffic reduction
mechanisms towards the indicated CN node only.
#### 8.25.3.2 Overload at the UTRAN
Figure 28: Overload at the UTRAN. Successful operation.
If the UTRAN is not capable of sending signalling messages to UEs due to
overloaded resources, the UTRAN should send an OVERLOAD message to the CN. The
RNC shall include the _Global RNC-ID_ IE in this message. The message shall be
sent only towards those CN nodes towards which theRNC can send the INITIAL UE
MESSAGE message. If the _Priority Class Indicator_ IE is included it shall be
ignored.
### 8.25.4 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.26 Reset
### 8.26.1 General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to initialise the UTRAN in the event of
a failure in the CN or vice versa. The procedure uses connectionless
signalling.
### 8.26.2 Successful Operation
#### 8.26.2.1 Reset Procedure Initiated from the CN
Figure 29: Reset procedure initiated from the CN. Successful operation.
In the event of a failure at the CN, which has resulted in the loss of
transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the RNC.
When a CN node sends this message towards an RNC for which it is not the
default CN node, the _Global CN-ID_ IE shall be included. This message is used
by the UTRAN to release affected Radio Access Bearers and to erase all
affected references for the specific CN node that sent the RESET message, i.e.
the CN node indicated by the _Global CN-ID_ IE or, if this IE is not included,
the default CN node for the indicated CN domain.
After a guard period of T~RatC~ seconds a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message shall be
returned to the CN, indicating that all references at the UTRAN have been
cleared. The RNC does not need to wait for the release of UTRAN radio
resources or for the transport network layer signalling to be completed before
returning the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
The RNC shall include the _Global RNC-ID_ IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
The _Global RNC-ID_ IE shall not be included in the RESET message.
**Interactions with other procedures:**
In case of interactions with other procedures, the Reset procedure shall
always override all other procedures.
#### 8.26.2.2 Reset Procedure Initiated from the UTRAN
Figure 30: Reset procedure initiated from the UTRAN. Successful operation.
In the event of a failure at the UTRAN which has resulted in the loss of
transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to all CN
nodes towards which the RNC has Iu signalling connections established. This
message is used by the CN to release affected Radio Access Bearers and to
erase all affected references for the sending RNC.
The RNC shall include the _Global RNC-ID_ IE in the RESET message.
After a guard period of T~RatR~ seconds a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message shall be
returned to the UTRAN indicating that all references have been cleared.
When a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message is sent from a CN node towards an RNC for
which the sending CN node is not the default CN node, the _Global CN-ID_ IE
shall be included.
**Interactions with other procedures:**
In case of interactions with other procedures, the Reset procedure shall
always override all other procedures.
### 8.26.3 Abnormal Conditions
#### 8.26.3.1 Abnormal Condition at the CN
If the CN sends a RESET message to the RNC and receives no RESET ACKNOWLEDGE
message within a period T~RafR~ then it shall repeat the entire Reset
procedure. The sending of the RESET message shall be repeated a maximum of
\"n\" times where n is an operator matter. After the n-th unsuccessful
repetition the procedure shall be stopped and e.g. the maintenance system be
informed.
#### 8.26.3.2 Abnormal Condition at the UTRAN
If the RNC sends a RESET message to the CN and receives no RESET ACKNOWLEDGE
message within a period T~RafC~ then it shall repeat the entire Reset
procedure. The sending of the RESET message shall be repeated a maximum of
\"n\" times where n is an operator matter. After the n-th unsuccessful
repetition the procedure shall be stopped and e.g. the maintenance system be
informed.
#### 8.26.3.3 Crossing of Reset Messages
When an entity that has sent a RESET message and is waiting for a RESET
ACKNOWLEDGE message, instead receives a RESET message from the peer entity, it
shall stop timer T~RafC~ or T~RafR~ and send a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message to
the peer entity.
## 8.27 Error Indication
### 8.27.1 General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node to report detected
errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an
appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising
dedicated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses connection
oriented signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses connectionless signalling.
### 8.27.2 Successful Operation
Figure 31: Error Indication procedure, CN originated. Successful operation.
Figure 32: Error Indication procedure, RNC originated. Successful operation.
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication
procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving
node.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the _Cause_ IE or
the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE.
Examples for possible cause values for protocol error indications are:
\- \"Transfer Syntax Error\"
> \- \"Semantic Error\"
\- \"Message not compatible with receiver state\".
If the ERROR INDICATION message is sent connectionless, the _CN Domain
Indicator_ IE shall be present.
If the ERROR INDICATION message is sent connectionless towards the CN, the
_Global RNC-ID_ IE shall be present.
When an ERROR INDICATION message is sent connectionless from a CN node towards
an RNC for which the sending CN node is not the default CN node, the _Global
CN-ID_ IE shall be included.
### 8.27.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.28 CN Deactivate Trace
### 8.28.1 General
The purpose of the CN Deactivate Trace procedure is to inform the RNC to stop
the trace session, initiated by a signalling based activation, for the
indicated trace reference and related to the UE the Iu connection is used for.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.28.2 Successful Operation
Figure 33: CN Deactivate Trace procedure. Successful operation.
The CN invokes the CN Deactivate Trace procedure by sending a CN DEACTIVATE
TRACE message to the UTRAN as defined in TS 32.422 [38].
The CN DEACTIVATE TRACE message shall contain the _Trace Reference_ IE. The
RNC shall stop the trace session for the indicated trace reference in the
_Trace Reference_ IE. In case of simultaneous CS/PS connections, the trace
session for the indicated trace reference shall be closed upon reception of
the CN DEACTIVATE TRACE message from any of the CN domain, whether it was the
one which initiated trace session activation or not.
#### 8.28.2.1 Successful Operation for GERAN Iu mode
The CN DEACTIVATE TRACE message shall contain the _Trace Reference_ IE and may
contain the _Trigger ID_ IE. The _Trace Reference_ IE and, if present, the
_Trigger ID_ IE are used to indicate which trace shall be stopped.
### 8.28.3 Abnormal Conditions
Void
## 8.29 Reset Resource
### 8.29.1 General
The purpose of the Reset Resource procedure is to initialise part of the UTRAN
in the event of an abnormal failure in the CN or vice versa (e.g. Signalling
Transport processor reset). The procedure uses connectionless signalling.
#### 8.29.1.1 Reset Resource procedure initiated from the RNC
Void
#### 8.29.1.2 Reset Resource procedure initiated from the CN
Void.
### 8.29.2 Successful Operation
#### 8.29.2.1 Reset Resource procedure initiated from the RNC
Figure 34: RNC initiated Reset Resource procedure. Successful operation.
The RNC initiates the procedure by sending a RESET RESOURCE message to the CN.
The RESET RESOURCE message shall include the _CN Domain Indicator_ IE, the
_Global RNC-ID_ IE, the _Cause_ IE with the appropriate cause value (e.g.
\"Signalling Transport Resource Failure\") and a list containing _Iu
Signalling Connection Identifier_ IEs.
On reception of this message the CN shall release locally the resources and
references (i.e. resources and Iu signalling connection identifiers)
associated to the Iu signalling connection identifiers indicated in the
received message. The CN shall always return the RESET RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE
message to the RNC when all Iu-related resources and references have been
released and shall include the _CN Domain Indicator_ IE and a list of _Iu
Signalling Connection Identifier_ IEs. The list of _Iu Signalling Connection
Identifier_ IEs within the RESET RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message shall be in the
same order as received in the RESET RESOURCE message. Unknown signalling
connection identifiers shall be reported as released.
When a RESET RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message is sent from a CN node towards an
RNC for which the sending CN node is not the default CN node, the _Global CN-
ID_ IE shall be included.
Both the CN and the RNC shall provide means to prevent the immediate re-
assignment of released Iu signalling connection identifiers to minimise the
risk that the Reset Resource procedure releases the same Iu signalling
connection identifiers re-assigned to new Iu connections.
#### 8.29.2.2 Reset Resource procedure initiated from the CN
Figure 35: CN initiated Reset Resource procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a RESET RESOURCE message to the RNC.
The RESET RESOURCE message shall include the _CN Domain Indicator_ IE, the
_Cause_ IE with the appropriate cause value (e.g. \"Signalling Transport
Resource Failure\") and a list containing _Iu Signalling Connection
Identifier_ IEs.
When a RESET RESOURCE message is sent from a CN node towards an RNC for which
the sending CN node is not the default CN node, the _Global CN-ID_ IE shall be
included.
On reception of this message the RNC shall release locally the resources and
references (i.e. radio resources and Iu signalling connection identifiers)
associated to the specific CN node and Iu signalling connection identifiers
indicated in the received message. The _Global RNC-ID_ IE shall not be
included in the RESET RESOURCE message. If no _Global CN-ID_ IE is included in
the RESET RESOURCE message to indicate the sending CN node, the default CN
node for the indicated CN domain shall be considered as sender. The RNC shall
always return the RESET RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the CN when all Iu-
related resources and references have been released and shall include the _CN
Domain Indicator_ IE, a list of _Iu Signalling Connection Identifier_ IEs and
the _Global RNC-ID_ IE. The list of _Iu Signalling Connection Identifier_ IEs
within the RESET RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message shall be in the same order as
received in the RESET RESOURCE message. Unknown signalling connection
identifiers shall be reported as released.
Both the RNC and the CN shall provide means to prevent the immediate re-
assignment of released Iu signalling connection identifiers to minimise the
risk that the Reset Resource procedure releases the same Iu signalling
connection identifiers re-assigned to new Iu connections.
## 8.30 RAB Modification Request
### 8.30.1 General
The purpose of the RAB Modification Request procedure is to allow the RNC to
initiate renegotiation of RABs for a given UE after RAB establishment. The
procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.30.2 Successful Operation
Figure 36: RAB Modification procedure.
The RNC initiates the procedure by generating a RAB MODIFY REQUEST message
towards the CN and shall include a list of _RABs To Be Modified_ IEs. For each
RAB requested to be modified the _RABs To Be Modified_ _Item_ IE of the RAB
MODIFY REQUEST message shall include the _RAB ID_ IE, and the corresponding
_Requested RAB Parameter Values_ IE. The _Requested RAB Parameter Values_ IE
shall either list those RAB parameters the RNC would like modified and the
associated new RAB parameter values it is requesting or shall indicate that
the execution of the alternative RAB configuration is requested. For any given
RAB, the RNC shall be able to propose modifications to any negotiable RAB
parameters.
If the requested maximum bit rate (respectively the requested guaranteed bit
rate when applicable) exceeds the maximum value of the _Requested Maximum Bit
Rate_ IE (respectively _Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE), either the
_Extended Requested Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Extended Requested
Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) shall be used or the _Supported Requested Maximum Bit
Rate_ IE (respectively _Supported Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) shall be
used.
For a RAB if _Extended Requested Maximum Bit Rate_ IE (respectively _Extended
Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE when applicable) is signalled in one
direction RNC shall signal the _Extended Requested Maximum Bit Rate_ IE
(respectively _Extended Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) also in the other
direction for this RAB. If _Supported Requested Maximum Bit Rate_ IE
(respectively _Supported Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) is used it shall
be used in both directions.
If supported the RNC may include the _Supported Requested Maximum Bit Rate_ IE
(respectively _Supported Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate_ IE) in _Requested RAB
Parameter Values_ IE to define the RAB parameters the RNC would like modified
and the associated new RAB parameter values.
If the RNC is allowed to request an alternative RAB Configuration, the RNC may
request the CN to trigger the execution of this alternative RAB configuration
by including the _Alternative RAB Configuration Request_ IE in the RAB MODIFY
REQUEST message.
Upon reception of the RAB MODIFY REQUEST message, it is up to the CN to decide
how to react to the request.
### 8.30.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.31 Location Related Data
### 8.31.1 General
The purpose of the Location Related Data procedure is to provide the means to
handle additional location-related requests over the Iu interface: it allows
the CN to either retrieve from the RNC deciphering keys (to be forwarded to
the UE) for the broadcast assistance data, or request the RNC to deliver
dedicated assistance data to the UE. The procedure uses connection oriented
signalling.
### 8.31.2 Successful Operation
Figure 37: Location Related Data procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by generating a LOCATION RELATED DATA REQUEST
message to the RNC.
Upon reception of the LOCATION RELATED DATA REQUEST message, the RNC shall
initiate the requested function indicated in the _Location Related Data
Request Type_ IE.
The _Location Related Data Request Type_ IE indicates to the RNC whether:
\- to start dedicated assistance data delivery to the UE, or
\- to send deciphering keys for broadcast assistance data to the CN.
If the LOCATION RELATED DATA REQUEST message included a request for dedicated
assistance data delivery to the UE, and if the dedicated assistance data was
successfully delivered to the UE, the RNC shall respond to the CN with a
LOCATION RELATED DATA RESPONSE message containing no data.
If the LOCATION RELATED DATA REQUEST message included a request for
deciphering keys of broadcast assistance data, the RNC shall respond to the CN

The RNC shall, if supported, use the _UESBI-Iu_ IE when received in the UE
SPECIFIC INFORMATION INDICATION message.
## 8.34 Direct Information Transfer
### 8.34.1 General
The purpose of the Direct Information Transfer procedure is to transfer some
information from the RNC to the CN or vice versa in unacknowledged mode.
This procedure uses connectionless signalling.
### 8.34.2 Successful Operation
#### 8.34.2.1 Direct Information Transfer initiated from the RNC
Figure 42: Information Request procedure. Successful operation.
The procedure is initiated with a DIRECT INFORMATION TRANSFER message sent
from the RNC to the CN.
The DIRECT INFORMATION TRANSFER message shall include the following IEs:
\- Inter-system Information Transfer Type,
\- Global RNC-ID,
\- _CN Domain Indicator,_
The _Inter-system Information Transfer Type_ IE indicates the nature of the
transferred information.
When the transferred information is of RIM nature, the _RIM Information_ IE
within the _RIM Transfer_ IE shall contain a BSSGP RIM PDU. The final RAN
destination node where the RIM information needs to be routed by the CN shall
be indicated in the _RIM Routing Address_ IE within the _RIM Transfer_ IE and

\- Inter-system Information Transfer Type,
\- _CN Domain Indicator,_
The DIRECT INFORMATION TRANSFER message may include the following IEs:
\- Global CN-ID.
The _Global CN-ID_ IE shall be included only when the CN node sending the
message is not the default CN node of the RNC.
The _Inter-system Information Transfer Type_ IE indicates the nature of the
transferred information.
When the transferred information is of RIM nature, the _RIM Information_ IE
within the _RIM Transfer_ IE shall contain a BSSGP RIM PDU. The _RIM Routing
Address_ IE shall not be present since the RNC is the final destination node.
### 8.34.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.35 Uplink Information Exchange
### 8.35.1 General
The purpose of the Uplink Information Exchange procedure is to transfer or
request some information to the CN.
This procedure uses connectionless signalling.
### 8.35.2 Successful Operation
Figure 44: Uplink Information Exchange procedure. Successful operation.
The procedure is initiated with an UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUEST message
sent from the RNC to the CN.
The UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUEST message shall contain the following
IEs:
\- Information Exchange ID
\- Information Exchange Type
\- _CN Domain Indicator_
\- Global RNC-ID
The _Information Exchange Type_ IE indicates whether the RNC asks the CN to
either transfer or request specific information. If the _Information Exchange
Type_ IE is set to the value \"transfer\", the RNC shall also include in the
UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUEST message the _Information Transfer Type_ IE
which indicates the nature of the information transferred.
If the _Information Exchange Type_ IE is set to the value \"request\", the RNC
shall also include in the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUEST message the
_Information Request Type_ IE which indicates the nature of the information
requested.
When the transferred information in the _Information Transfer Type_ IE relates
to a Trace Session in the RNC, the _Trace Activation Indicator_ IE indicates
whether the Trace Session identified by the _Trace Reference_ IE is activated
or deactivated in the RNC. In case the Trace Session is activated, the
_Equipments To Be Traced_ IE gives the Equipment Identity of the UEs that the
RNC has to trace.
When the requested information in the _Information Request Type_ IE relates to
the Multicast Service list for a given UE identified by its Permanent NAS UE
Identity in the _Information Request Type_ IE, this requested information,
i.e. the list of Multicast Services the UE has joined, shall be included in
the _Information Requested_ IE in the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE
message.
When the requested information in the _Information Request Type_ IE relates to
the IP Multicast Address and APN for one or several MBMS bearer service
identified by their respective TMGIs in the _Information Request Type_ IE,
this requested information, i.e. IP Multicast Address and APN, shall be
included in the _Information Requested_ IE in the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE
RESPONSE message.
If the CN node is capable of processing the request or the transfer, the RNC
shall be informed by the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE message. The
UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE message shall contain the _Information
Exchange ID_ IE and the _CN Domain Indicator_ IE. If the RNC has not sent the
UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUEST message to the default CN node, the UPLINK
INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE message shall also include the _Global CN-ID_
IE.
Upon reception of the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE message including
the IP Multicast Address and APN list in the _Information Requested_ IE, the
RNC shall store this information in the relevant MBMS Service Contexts.
Upon reception of the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE RESPONSE message including
the Multicast Service list in the _Information Requested_ IE, the RNC shall
perform, for each TMGI received, the corresponding UE linking as described in
TS 25.346 [42].
### 8.35.3 Unsuccessful Operation

transfer, the RNC shall be informed by the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE FAILURE
message. The UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE FAILURE message shall contain the
_Information Exchange ID_ IE and the _CN Domain Indicator_ IE. If the RNC has
not sent the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUEST message to the default CN
node, the UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE FAILURE message shall include the
_Global CN-ID_ IE.
The UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE FAILURE message shall inform the RNC about the
reason for unsuccessful operation with an appropriate cause value e.g. \"MBMS
- No Multicast Service For This UE\", \"MBMS - Unknown UE ID\".
### 8.35.4 Abnormal Conditions
Not Applicable.
## 8.36 MBMS Session Start
### 8.36.1 General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Start procedure is to request the UTRAN to
notify UEs about an upcoming MBMS Session of a given MBMS Bearer Service and
to establish a MBMS RAB and MBMS Iu signalling connection for this MBMS
Session. The MBMS Session Start procedure is triggered by the CN (PS domain).
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.36.2 Successful Operation
Figure 46: MBMS Session Start procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS SESSION START message.
The MBMS SESSION START message shall contain:
\- TMGI;
\- MBMS Bearer Service Type;
\- MBMS Session Identity, if available;
\- Iu Signalling Connection Identifier IE;
\- RAB parameters (including e.g. Allocation/Retention Priority);
\- PDP Type Information, if available;
\- PDP Type Information extension, if available;
\- MBMS Session Duration;
\- MBMS Service Area;
\- Frequency Layer Convergence Flag, if available;
\- RA List of Idle Mode UEs, if available;
\- Global CN-ID IE, only when the MBMS SESSION START message is sent from a CN
node towards an RNC for which the sending CN node is not the default CN node;
\- MBMS Session Repetition Number, if available;
\- Time to MBMS Data Transfer;
\- MBMS Counting Information, if available.
Upon reception of the MBMS SESSION START message, the RNC shall store the _Iu
Signalling Connection Identifier_ IE for the duration of the MBMS Iu
signalling connection. The _Iu Signalling Connection Identifier_ IE contains
an Iu signalling connection identifier which is allocated by the CN. The value
for the _Iu Signalling Connection Identifier_ IE shall be allocated so as to
uniquely identify an Iu signalling connection for the involved CN node.
The _Global CN-ID_ IE contains the identity of the CN node that sent the MBMS
SESSION START message, and it shall, if included, be stored together with the
Iu signalling connection identifier. If the _Global CN-ID_ IE is not included,
the MBMS SESSION START message shall be considered as coming from the default
CN node.
Upon reception of the MBMS SESSION START message, the RNC shall store, if not
already, and remember the _TMGI_ IE, the _RAB parameters_ IE and the other
attributes of the session as part of the MBMS Service Context. The _TMGI_ IE
contains the TMGI identifier which uniquely identifies the MBMS Bearer
Service.
If the _MBMS Bearer Service Type_ IE is set to \"Multicast\", upon reception
of the MBMS SESSION START message, the RNC shall initiate allocation of
requested resources for the MBMS RAB at a proper point in time if at least one
of the following two conditions is fulfilled:
\- the RNC controls at least one cell contained in the indicated MBMS Service
Area and, if the _RA List of Idle Mode UEs_ IE is included in MBMS SESSION
START message, at least one RNC´s RA is contained in this list, or if
_Empty/Full RA List of Idle Mode UEs_ IE included in MBMS SESSION START
message is set to \"fulllist\",
\- the RNC serves UEs consuming radio resources from cells contained in the
indicated MBMS Service Area.
If no mapping is configured for a certain MBMS Service Area Identity in the
_MBMS Service Area_ IE in the RNC it shall simply ignore it
The RNC may optimise the point in time when the resource allocation is
initiated based on the _Time to MBMS Data Transfer_ IE.
In case the _RA List of Idle Mode UEs_ IE is included in MBMS SESSION START
message but none of above conditions is fulfilled, the RNC may decide to wait
for either an update of the RA List of Idle Mode UEs or a UE linking to
finally establish the MBMS RAB. If the RNC decides so, it shall report it
immediately to the CN in the MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message with the
cause value \"Successful MBMS Session Start - No Data Bearer Necessary\" and
maintain an Iu signalling connection.
If the _Empty/Full RA List of Idle Mode UEs_ IE included in MBMS SESSION START
message is set to \"fulllist\", the RNC shall initiate the MBMS Notification
over the Uu interface in all the cells under its control which belong to the
indicated MBMS service area.
If the _MBMS Bearer Service Type_ IE is set to \"Broadcast\", the _MBMS
Counting Information IE_ shall be included in the MBMS SESSION START message
_._ If the _MBMS Counting Information_ IE is set to \"counting\", the RNC may
apply MBMS counting.
If the _MBMS Bearer Service Type_ IE is set to \"Broadcast\" upon reception of
the MBMS SESSION START message, the RNC shall initiate allocation of requested
resources for the MBMS RAB at a proper point in time if it controls at least
one cell contained in the indicated MBMS Service Area.
If the _MBMS Bearer Service Type_ IE is set to \"Multicast\" the _MBMS
Counting Information_ IE shall be ignored.
The allocation of requested resources shall be made according to the values of
the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE (priority level, pre-emption
indicators) and the resource situation as follows:
\- The RNC shall consider the priority level of the requested MBMS RAB, when
deciding on the resource allocation.
\- The _Queuing Allowed_ IE shall be ignored for MBMS RAB.
\- The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (singularly or in
combination) be used to determine whether the MBMS RAB establishment has to be
performed unconditionally and immediately. If the requested MBMS RAB is marked
as \"may trigger pre-emption\" and the resource situation requires so, the RNC
may trigger the pre-emption procedure which may then cause the forced release
of a lower priority RAB which is marked as \"pre-emptable\". Whilst the
process and the extent of the pre-emption procedure is operator-dependent, the
pre-emption indicators, if given in the MBMS SESSION START message, shall be
treated as follows:
1\. If the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE is set to \"may trigger pre-emption\",
then this allocation request may trigger the pre-emption procedure. UTRAN
shall only pre‑empt RABs (other MBMS RABs or UE specific RABs) with lower
priority, in ascending order of priority.
2\. If the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE is set to \"shall not trigger pre-
emption\", then this allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption
procedure.
3\. If the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE is set to \"pre-emptable\", then
this connection shall be included in the pre-emption process.
4\. If the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE is set to \"not pre-emptable\", then
this connection shall not be included in the pre-emption process.
5\. If the _Priority Level_ IE is set to \"no priority\" the given values for
the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE and _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE shall not
be considered. Instead the values \"shall not trigger pre-emption\" and \"not
pre-emptable\" shall prevail.
> \- If the _Allocation/Retention Priority_ IE is not given in the MBMS
> SESSION START message, the allocation request shall not trigger the pre-
> emption process and the connection may be pre-empted and considered to have
> the value \"lowest\" as priority level. Moreover, queuing shall not be
> allowed.
The UTRAN shall use the _PDP Type Information_ IE or _PDP Type Information
extension_ IE to configure any compression algorithms.
The MBMS SESSION START message may contain the _MBMS Synchronisation
Information_ IE, consisting of the
\- _MBMS HC Indicator_ IE;
\- _IP Multicast Address_ IE;
\- _GTP DL TEID_ IE;
\- _IP Source Address_ IE, if available.
In case of successful MBMS RAB establishment, if the _MBMS Synchronisation
Information_ IE was not received within the MBMS SESSION START message, the
RNC shall include the _Transport Layer Address_ IE and the _Iu Transport
Association_ IE in the MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message. The RNC may answer
successfully even though the MBMS resources have not been established in all
relevant cells.
If NNSF is active, the RNC may receive from several CN nodes for a certain
MBMS Bearer Service the MBMS SESSION START message. In this case, if the RNC
decides to establish the requested MBMS RAB, it shall only establish one MBMS
Iu bearer and shall inform the selected CN node accordingly i.e. with MBMS
SESSION START RESPONSE message including the _Transport Layer Address_ IE and
the _Iu Transport Association_ IE.
If the _MBMS Synchronisation Information_ IE was received within the MBMS
SESSION START message, even if the RNC received related information more than
once due to NNSF, if supported, it shall not include the _Transport Layer
Address_ IE and the _Iu Transport Association_ IE in the MBMS SESSION START
RESPONSE message and shall join the indicated IP Multicast group only once for
the indicated MBMS Service Id. In case of successful joining the indicated IP
Multicast group, the RNC shall inform all the CN nodes from which it has
received a MBMS SESSION START message for that MBMS service with the _Cause_
IE set to \"Successful MBMS Session Start -- IP Multicast Bearer
established\". If the _IP Source Address_ IE is contained in the _MBMS
Synchronisation Information_ IE, the RNC shall use this information for
joining the IP Multicast group.
If the RNC receives from several CN nodes for a certain MBMS Bearer Service
the MBMS SESSION START message and all the MBMS SESSION START messages include
the _RA List of Idle Mode UEs_ IE, the RNC shall, if supported, maintain an
MBMS Iu signalling connection towards all the CN nodes and inform them
accordingly i.e. with MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message and cause value
\"Successful MBMS Session Start - No Data Bearer Necessary\" to all the CN
nodes except the one, if any, towards which the RNC confirmed the successful
MBMS RAB establishment.
The _MBMS Session Repetition Number_ IE may be included in the MBMS SESSION
START message in case the _MBMS Session Identity_ IE is included in the same
message. The _MBMS Session Repetition Number_ IE may be used by RNC to
recognise retransmissions of a particular session of a MBMS Bearer Service
with identical contents. This IE may be used for counting purpose.
When the _Frequency Layer Convergence Flag_ IE is set to \"no-FLC-flag\", the
RNC is being requested to not apply any frequency layer convergence mechanism.
The service shall then be delivered to all cells of all the MBMS Service Area
Identities indicated in the _MBMS Service Area_ IE.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message terminate
the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
### 8.36.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 47: MBMS Session Start procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the RNC is not capable of correctly processing the request (e.g. the MBMS
resources could not be established at all in any cell), the CN shall be
informed by the MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message.
If the _MBMS Bearer Service Type_ IE is set to \"Broadcast\" upon reception of
the MBMS SESSION START message and the RNC doesn't have any cell contained in
the indicated MBMS Service Area, it shall report it immediately to the CN in
the MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message with the cause value \"MBMS - No cell
in MBMS Service Area\".
If NNSF is active and the RNC received from several CN nodes for a certain
MBMS Bearer Service the MBMS SESSION START message, but not all of the MBMS
SESSION START messages include the _RA List of Idle Mode UEs_ IE, the RNC
shall inform the respective CN nodes accordingly i.e. with MBMS SESSION START
FAILURE message and cause value \"MBMS - Superseded Due To NNSF\" to all the
CN nodes except the one towards which the RNC confirmed the successful MBMS
RAB establishment with MBMS SESSION START RESPONSE message.
When UTRAN reports failure of the MBMS Session Start procedure, the cause
value should be precise enough to enable the core network to know the reason
for the failure. Typical cause values are: \"MBMS - Superseded Due To NNSF\",
\"Requested Traffic Class not Available\", \"Invalid RAB Parameters Value\",
\"Requested Maximum Bit Rate not Available\", \"Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate
not Available\", \"Requested Transfer Delay not Achievable\", \"Invalid RAB
Parameters Combination\", \"Condition Violation for Guaranteed Bit Rate\",
\"Iu Transport Connection Failed to Establish\", \"No Resource Available\".
Transmission and reception of a MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message terminate
the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
### 8.36.4 Abnormal Conditions
If, for a MBMS RAB requested to be set up, the _PDP Type Information_ IE
and/or _PDP Type Information_ _extension_ IE is not present, the RNC shall
continue with the procedure.
If an MBMS SESSION START message from a given CN Node provides a _TMGI_ IE
that is used for an already established and running MBMS Session provided by
the same CN Node, and the indicated _MBMS Service Area_ IE refers to an MBMS
Service Area that is partially or completely overlapping with the MBMS Service
Area of the already established and running MBMS Session, then the RNC shall
return an MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message with the cause value \"TMGI in
Use and overlapping MBMS Service Area \".
If an MBMS SESSION START message from a given CN Node provides a _TMGI_ IE
that is used for an already established and running MBMS Session provided by
another CN Node, and the indicated _MBMS Service Area_ IE refers to a
different MBMS Service Area that is partially overlapping with the MBMS
Service Area of the already established and running MBMS Session, then the RNC
shall return an MBMS SESSION START FAILURE message with the cause value \"TMGI
in Use and overlapping MBMS Service Area \".
## 8.37 MBMS Session Update
### 8.37.1 General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Update procedure is to inform the RNC during a
MBMS Session whenever the RA List of Idle Mode UEs changes compared to one
previously sent. The MBMS Session Update procedure is triggered by the CN (PS
domain).
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.37.2 Successful Operation
Figure 48: MBMS Session Update procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS SESSION UPDATE message.
The MBMS SESSION UPDATE message shall contain the _Delta RA List of Idle Mode
UEs_ IE and the _Session Update ID_ IE.
Upon reception of the MBMS SESSION UPDATE message, if a MBMS RAB has already
been established, the RNC shall initiate allocation of additional MBMS radio
resources for this MBMS RAB if the RNC controls at least one cell that is part
of both the MBMS Service Area and one of the RNC´s RAs indicated in the _New
RA List of Idle Mode UEs_ IE, if this IE is included in the _Delta RA List of
Idle Mode UEs_ IE group. The RNC may release the existing MBMS radio resources
for the cells part of the RNC's RAs indicated in the _RA List with No Idle
Mode UEs Any More_ IE, if this IE is included in the _Delta RA List of Idle
Mode UEs_ IE group.
Upon reception of the MBMS SESSION UPDATE message, if no MBMS RAB has yet been
established, the RNC shall establish the MBMS RAB if the RNC controls at least
one cell that is part of both the MBMS Service Area and one of the RNC´s RAs
indicated in the _New RA List of Idle Mode UEs_ IE, if this IE is included in
the _Delta RA List of Idle Mode UEs_ IE group. If the previous condition is
not fulfilled, the RNC may decide to wait for either another update of the RA
List of Idle Mode UEs or a UE linking to finally establish the MBMS RAB.
In case of successful MBMS RAB establishment, the RNC shall include the
_Transport Layer Address_ IE and the _Iu Transport Association_ IE in the MBMS
SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message.
When the update of the RA List of Idle Mode UEs is successfully executed, the
UTRAN shall report it to the CN in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message,
which shall include the same _Session Update ID_ IE as received in the MBMS
SESSION UPDATE message. The RNC may answer successfully even though MBMS
resources have not been established in all relevant cells.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS SESSION UPDATE RESPONSE message terminate
the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
### 8.37.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 49: MBMS Session Update procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the RNC is not capable of correctly processing the request (e.g. additional
MBMS resources could not be established at all in any cell), the CN shall be
informed by the MBMS SESSION UDATE FAILURE message, which shall include the
same _Session Update ID_ IE as received in the MBMS SESSION UPDATE message.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS SESSION UPDATE FAILURE message terminate
the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
### 8.37.4 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.38 MBMS Session Stop
### 8.38.1 General
The purpose of the MBMS Session Stop procedure is to request the UTRAN to
notify UEs about the end of a given MBMS Session and to release the
corresponding MBMS RAB and MBMS Iu signalling connection for this MBMS
Session. The MBMS RAB Session Stop procedure may also be used as the last MBMS
session stop to make the RNC aware that a certain Multicast Service is no
longer available. The MBMS Session Stop procedure is triggered by the CN (PS
domain).
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.38.2 Successful Operation
Figure 50: MBMS Session Stop procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS SESSION STOP message.
Upon reception of the MBMS SESSION STOP message, the RNC shall release all
allocated resources for the MBMS RAB, including the MBMS Iu signalling
connection used for this MBMS RAB.
The MBMS SESSION STOP message shall include the _MBMS CN De-Registration_ IE.
If the _MBMS CN De-Registration_ IE is set to the value \"deregister\", the
RNC shall also remove all associated MBMS Service Context(s) and release all
allocated MBMS resources for the MBMS Bearer Service.
The RNC does not need to wait for the release of all UTRAN radio resources
before returning the MBMS SESSION STOP RESPONSE message.
In case of successful release of the MBMS Iu signalling connection, after the
MBMS SESSION STOP RESPONSE message has been sent, the CN shall not send
further RANAP connection-oriented messages on this particular connection.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS SESSION STOP RESPONSE message terminate
the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
### 8.38.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.39 MBMS UE Linking
### 8.39.1 General
The purpose of the MBMS UE Linking procedure is to make the RNC aware that a
given UE, with existing Iu-ps signalling connection, joined and/or left one or
several Multicast Services.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.39.2 Successful Operation
Figure 51: MBMS UE Linking procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message.
The MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message shall contain the following IEs:
\- a list of one or several TMGIs, each identifying the MBMS Bearer Service
that the UE joined or left and which has not yet been linked or unlinked
respectively in the UTRAN;
\- for each of the MBMS Bearer Services that the UE joined;
\- the PTP RAB ID.
Upon reception of the MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message, for each TMGI received
identifying the MBMS Bearer Service that the UE joined and which has not yet
been linked in the UTRAN, the RNC shall perform the corresponding UE linking
as described in TS 25.346 [42].
Upon reception of the MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message, for each TMGI received
identifying the MBMS Bearer Service that the UE left and which has not yet
been de-linked in the UTRAN, the RNC shall perform the corresponding UE de-
linking as described in TS 25.346 [42].
After handling all received TMGI(s), the RNC shall only report to the CN in
the MBMS UE LINKING RESPONSE message the unsuccessful linking(s)/de-linking(s)
with an appropriate cause value e.g. \"MBMS - UE Linking Already Done\",
\"MBMS - UE De-Linking Failure - No Existing UE Linking\".
Transmission and reception of a MBMS UE LINKING RESPONSE message terminate the
procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
### 8.39.3 Unsuccessful Operation
The unsuccessful operation for this Class 1 Elementary procedure is described
under the Successful Operation chapter.
### 8.39.4 Abnormal Conditions
Upon reception of the MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message, if for a given TMGI
received identifying the MBMS Bearer Service that the UE joined, the linking
has already been done in the UTRAN, the RNC shall consider this linking as
unsuccessful but shall proceed with the other ones.
Upon reception of the MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message, if a given TMGI
received identifying the MBMS Bearer Service that the UE left, cannot be found
in the UE context, the RNC shall consider this de-linking as unsuccessful but
shall proceed with the other ones.
## 8.40 MBMS Registration
### 8.40.1 General
The purpose of the MBMS Registration procedure is to request the CN (PS
domain) to register or de-register the RNC for a certain Multicast Service.
The procedure uses connectionless signalling, unless the procedure is used to
request CN to de-register the RNC for a Multicast Service which has an
existing Iu signalling connection towards the RNC i.e. during a MBMS Session.
In this last case, the procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.40.2 Successful Operation
Figure 52: MBMS Registration procedure. Successful operation.
The RNC initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.
The MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message shall contain the following IEs:
\- MBMS Registration Request type;
\- TMGI;
\- The associated IP Multicast Address and the APN corresponding to the MBMS
Bearer Service identified by the TMGI, only in the case the _MBMS Registration
Request type_ IE is set to \"register\";
\- Global RNC-ID, if connectionless signalling.
If the CN node is capable of processing the request, the RNC shall be informed
by the MBMS REGISTRATION RESPONSE message.
In case of connectionless signalling the MBMS REGISTRATION RESPONSE message
shall contain the same TMGI as received in the MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.
If the RNC has not sent the MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the _MBMS
Registration Request Type_ IE set to \"register\", to the default CN node, the
MBMS REGISTRATION RESPONSE message shall also include the _Global CN-ID_ IE.
Upon reception of the MBMS REGISTRATION RESPONSE message as a response to a
connectionless MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the _MBMS Registration
Request Type_ IE set to \"deregister\", the RNC shall remove all associated
MBMS resources and context(s) corresponding to the MBMS Bearer Service
identified by the TMGI included in the MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
Upon reception of the MBMS REGISTRATION RESPONSE message as a response to a
connection oriented MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the _MBMS
Registration Request Type_ IE set to \"deregister\", the RNC shall release the
MBMS Iu signalling connection and the RAB, if any, identified by the TMGI
included in the MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS REGISTRATION RESPONSE message terminate
the procedure in the CN and in the UTRAN respectively.
### 8.40.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 53: MBMS Registration procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the CN node is not capable of correctly processing the request, the RNC
shall be informed by the MBMS REGISTRATION FAILURE message.
In case of connectionless signalling, the MBMS REGISTRATION FAILURE message
shall contain the same TMGI as received in the MBMS REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.
The MBMS REGISTRATION FAILURE message shall inform the RNC about the reason
for unsuccessful operation thank to appropriate cause value e.g. \"TMGI
Unknown\", \"IP Multicast Address And APN Not Valid\", \"MBMS De-Registration
Rejected Due To Implicit Registration\", \"MBMS - Request Superseded\", \"MBMS
De-Registration During Session Not Allowed\".
In case of connectionless signalling, if the RNC has not sent the MBMS
REGISTRATION REQUEST message with the _MBMS Registration Request Type_ IE set
to \"register\", to the default CN node, the MBMS REGISTRATION FAILURE message
shall also include the _Global CN-ID_ IE.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS REGISTRATION FAILURE message terminate
the procedure in the CN and in the UTRAN respectively.
### 8.40.4 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.41 MBMS CN De-Registration
### 8.41.1 General
The purpose of the MBMS CN De-Registration procedure is to make the RNC aware
that a certain Multicast Service is no longer available. The MBMS CN De-
Registration procedure is triggered by the CN (PS domain).
The procedure uses connectionless signalling.
### 8.41.2 Successful Operation
Figure 54: MBMS CN De-Registration procedure. Successful operation.
The CN initiates the procedure by sending a MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.
The MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message shall contain the following IEs:
\- TMGI;
\- Global CN-ID IE, only when the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message is
sent from a CN node towards an RNC for which the sending CN node is not the
default CN node.
If the _Global CN-ID_ IE is not included, the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST
message shall be considered as coming from the default CN node.
Upon reception of the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the RNC shall
remove all associated MBMS context(s) and resources corresponding to the MBMS
Bearer Service identified by the indicated TMGI and shall report it to the CN
by sending the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION RESPONSE message.
Upon reception of the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message, if no existing
MBMS Bearer Service can be identified by the indicated TMGI in the RNC, it
shall consider this MBMS CN De-Registration procedure unsuccessful and shall
report it to the CN by sending the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION RESPONSE message
with the appropriate cause value e.g. \"TMGI unknown\".
The MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION RESPONSE message shall contain the _Global RNC-ID_
IE and the same TMGI as received in the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST
message.
Transmission and reception of a MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION RESPONSE message
terminate the procedure in the UTRAN and in the CN respectively.
### 8.41.3 Unsuccessful Operation
The unsuccessful operation for this Class 1 Elementary procedure is described
under the Successful Operation chapter.
### 8.41.4 Abnormal Conditions
If NNSF is active, the RNC may receive from several CN nodes for a certain
MBMS Bearer Service the MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST message. In this case
the RNC will only proceed with the first MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION REQUEST
message received and will inform the respective CN nodes accordingly i.e. with
MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION RESPONSE message and cause value \"TMGI unknown\" to
all the CN nodes except the one towards which the RNC confirmed the successful
the MBMS CN De-Registration procedure with MBMS CN DE-REGISTRATION RESPONSE
message including no cause value.
## 8.42 MBMS RAB Establishment Indication
### 8.42.1 General
The purpose of the MBMS RAB Establishment Indication procedure is to inform
the CN (PS domain) of the establishment of the MBMS RAB corresponding to the
MBMS Iu signalling connection used for this procedure.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.42.2 Successful Operation
Figure 55: MBMS RAB Establishment Indication procedure. Successful operation.
When the RNC has not yet established the MBMS RAB for a particular Multicast
Service and is informed that a given UE joined this particular Multicast
Service, the RNC shall initiate the MBMS RAB Establishment Indication
procedure and send the MBMS RAB ESTABLISHMENT INDICATION message to the CN. If
NNSF is active, the selection of the CN node is implementation dependant.
The MBMS RAB ESTABLISHMENT INDICATION message shall include the _Transport
Layer Address_ IE and the _Iu Transport Association_ IE.
### 8.42.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.43 MBMS RAB Release
### 8.43.1 General
The purpose of the MBMS RAB Release procedure is to enable the UTRAN to
request the release of an MBMS RAB. The MBMS RAB is defined for the PS domain
only.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.43.2 Successful Operation
Figure 56: MBMS RAB Release procedure. Successful operation.
The RNC initiates the procedure by generating a MBMS RAB RELEASE REQUEST
message towards the CN. The MBMS RAB RELEASE REQUEST message is sent on the Iu
connection related to the MBMS RAB to be released. The included cause value
indicates the reason for the release, e.g. \"RAB pre-empted\", \"Release due
to UTRAN Generated Reason\", \"MBMS - No Data Bearer Necessary\".
The CN should according to the MBMS RAB RELEASE REQUEST message initiate the
release of all MBMS resources related to the Iu connection.
For MBMS Multicast service the Iu signalling connection should not be
released.
The RNC may at reception of MBMS RAB RELEASE initiate release of the related
MBMS bearer resources.
**MBMS Broadcast service, interaction with MBMS Session Stop:**
For MBMS Broadcast service the CN may initiate the appropriate release
procedure for the MBMS Session related to the Iu signalling connection and
invoke the MBMS Session Stop procedure.
### 8.43.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 57: MBMS RAB RELEASE procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If the CN node is not capable of correctly processing the request, the RNC
shall be informed by the MBMS RAB RELEASE FAILURE message.
The MBMS RAB RELEASE FAILURE message shall inform the RNC about the reason for
the unsuccessful operation with an appropriate cause value.
### 8.43.4 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
## 8.44 Enhanced Relocation Complete
### 8.44.1 General
The purpose of the Enhanced Relocation Complete procedure is to inform the CN
that the resources have been allocated by the target RNC. The target RNC
provides necessary information to the CN to switch the user plane to the
target RNC.
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.44.2 Successful Operation
Figure 58: Enhanced Relocation Complete procedure. Successful operation.
The RNC initiates the procedure by sending the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE
REQUEST message to the CN.
If the _RABs Setup List_ IE in the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE REQUEST
message does not include all RABs previously established for the UE, the CN
shall consider the non included RABs as implicitly released by the RNC.
For each RAB the resource allocation was successful towards the PS domain or
towards the CS domain when an ALCAP is not used, the RNC shall include the
_Transport Layer Address_ IE and the _Iu Transport Association_ IE in the
_RABs Setup List_ IE in the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE REQUEST message. If
any alternative RAB parameter values have been used when allocating the
resources, these RAB parameter values shall be included in the ENHANCED
RELOCATION COMPLETE REQUEST message within the _Assigned RAB Parameter Values_
IE.
NOTE: If ALCAP is not used, the RNC shall include the same kind of TNL
information (i.e. IPv4 or IPv6) as received from the source RNC in the RANAP
ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message.
The target RNC shall include the _Chosen Integrity Protection Algorithm_ IE
_(Chosen Encryption Algorithm_ IE respectively) within the ENHANCED RELOCATION
COMPLETE REQUEST message, if, and only if the _Integrity Protection Key_ IE
(_Ciphering Key_ IE respectively) was included within the _Source RNC To
Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE of the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION
INFORMATION message.
If the _Higher bitrates than 16 Mbps flag_ IE is included in the ENHANCED
RELOCATION COMPLETE REQUEST message then the CN shall, if supported, use the
IE as described in TS 23.060 [21].
After all necessary updates including the DL transport layer information have
been successfully completed in the CN, the CN shall send the ENHANCED
RELOCATION COMPLETE RESPONSE message to the RNC.
In case the CN failed to setup for at least one of the RABs included the _RABs
Setup List_ IE in the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE REQUEST message, the CN
shall include the RABs it failed to setup in the _RABs To Be Released List_ IE
in the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE RESPONSE message. In this case, the RNC
shall release the resource for the RABs and the RNC shall regard the RABs
indicated in the _RABs To Be Released List_ IE as being fully released.
The ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE RESPONSE message shall contain the _User
Plane Information_ IE.
The ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE RESPONSE message shall contain the _Transport
Layer Address_ IE and the _Binding ID_ IE for each RAB towards the CS domain
when an ALCAP is used.
In case the CN decides to change the uplink transport layer information when
an ALCAP is not used it may include the _Transport Layer Address_ IE and the
_Binding ID_ IE within the _RABs Setup List_ IE in the ENHANCED RELOCATION
COMPLETE RESPONSE message.
The ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE RESPONSE message may contain the _RAB
Parameters_ IE for each RAB towards the CS domain in RAB Setup List.
If the _RAB Parameters_ IE is included in the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE
RESPONSE the RNC shall
\- replace the previously provided RAB Parameter for the RAB. The RNC shall
use the received RAB Parameter for the RAB.
If the _RAB Parameters_ IE is not contained in the ENHANCED RELOCATION
COMPLETE RESPONSE message, the RNC shall use the previously provided RAB
parameters.
The ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE RESPONSE message may contain the _UE
Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE to control the aggregate data rate of non-GBR
traffic for this UE.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is contained in the ENHANCED
RELOCATION COMPLETE RESPONSE message, the RNC shall, if supported,
\- replace the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate Parameter for
this UE. The RNC shall use the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate
Parameter for this UE.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is not contained in the ENHANCED
RELOCATION COMPLETE RESPONSE message, the RNC shall, if supported, use the
previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate Parameter.
In case SIPTO at Iu-PS functionality is supported by the UTRAN, the following
applies in addition for the successful operation of Enhanced Relocation
Complete procedure:
\- If the _MSISDN_ IE is present in the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE RESPONSE
message, then the UTRAN may offload the RAB(s) where the _Offload RAB
Parameters_ IE is present in the _RABs Setup Item_ _IEs_ IE. The _Access Point
Name_ IE and the _Charging Characteristics_ IE within the _Offload RAB
Parameters_ IE and the _MSIDSN_ IE may only be used for the SIPTO at Iu-PS
function and according to the description in TS 23.060 [21].
### 8.44.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 69: Enhanced Relocation Complete procedure. Unsuccessful operation.
If a failure occurs in the CN during the execution of the relocation
procedure, the CN shall send the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE FAILURE message
to the RNC with an appropriate cause value. The RNC shall assume the Iu
resources between the old source RNC and the CN node being released by the
respective CN node.
## 8.45 Enhanced Relocation Complete Confirm
### 8.45.1 General
The purpose of the Enhanced Relocation Complete Confirm procedure is to
indicate the CN (applicable towards the CS domain only) to switch the bearers
towards the target RNC. The procedure uses connection-oriented signalling.
### 8.45.2 Successful Operation
Figure 70: Enhanced Relocation Complete Confirm procedure. Successful
operation.
The RNC shall initialise the Enhanced Relocation Complete Confirm procedure by
sending the ENHANCED RELOCATION COMPLETE CONFIRM message. If the RNC is not
able to successfully initialise RABs for which an Iu user plane initialisation
is necessary, it shall provide respective information within the _RABs Failed
To Initialise List_ IE with an appropriate cause value.
## 8.46 SRVCC Preparation
### 8.46.1 General
The purpose of the SRVCC Preparation procedure is the reception of the
security parameters from the PS CN domain needed for successful SRVCC
operation as described in TS 23.216 [54].
The procedure uses connection oriented signalling.
### 8.46.2 Successful Operation
Figure 46.1: SRVCC Preparation procedure. Successful operation.
The RNC shall determine if the SRVCC operation as described in TS 23.216 [54]
is required. In such case the RNC shall initiate the SRVCC Preparation
procedure by sending an SRVCC CS KEYS REQUEST message to the source SGSN.
The SGSN shall respond to the RNC with SRVCC CS KEYS RESPONSE message
containing the _Integrity Protection Key_ IE, the _Encryption Key_ IE and the
_SRVCC Information_ IE.

## 9.2 Information Element Definitions
### 9.2.0 General
Subclause 9.2 presents the RANAP IE definitions in tabular format. The
corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.3. In case there is
contradiction between the tabular format in subclause 9.2 and the ASN.1
definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of
conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format
shall take precedence.
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by
bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description
of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards
to the ordering of bits:
\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
\- When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the
bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;

#### 9.2.1.2 RAB ID
This element uniquely identifies a radio access bearer for a specific CN
domain for a particular UE, which makes the RAB ID unique over one Iu
connection. The RAB ID shall remain the same for the duration of the RAB even
when the RAB is relocated to another Iu connection.
The purpose of the element is to bind data stream from the Non Access Stratum
point of view (e.g. bearer of call or PDP context) and radio access bearer in
Access Stratum. The value is also used in the RNC to relate Radio Bearers to a
RAB. The content of this information element is transferred unchanged from the
CN node (i.e. MSC or SGSN) via the RNC to the UE by RANAP messages and RRC
messages. For RRC messages refer to TS 25.331 [10].
The element contains binary representation of either the Stream Identifier
(SI) for CS domain or the Network Service Access Point Identifier (NSAPI) for
PS domain. These identifiers are coded in the RAB ID element in accordance
with the coding of the _Stream Identifier_ IE and with the coding of the
_NSAPI_ IE in TS 24.008 [8].

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following table.
In general, \"not supported\" cause values indicate that the related
capability is missing. On the other hand, \"not available\" cause values
indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient resources
were available to perform the requested action.
* * *
Radio Network Layer cause Meaning Deciphering Keys Not Available The action
failed because RNC is not able to provide requested deciphering keys. Conflict
with already existing Integrity protection and/or Ciphering information The
action was not performed due to that the requested security mode configuration
was in conflict with the already existing security mode configuration.
Condition Violation For Guaranteed Bit Rate The action was not performed due
to condition violation for guaranteed bit rate. Condition Violation For SDU
Parameters The action was not performed due to condition violation for SDU
parameters. Condition Violation For Traffic Handling Priority The action was
not performed due to condition violation for traffic handling priority.
Dedicated Assistance data Not Available The action failed because RNC is not
able to successfully deliver the requested dedicated assistance data to the
UE. Directed Retry The reason for action is Directed Retry Failure In The
Radio Interface Procedure Radio interface procedure has failed. Incoming
Relocation Not Supported Due To PUESBINE Feature The incoming relocation
cannot be accepted by the target RNC because of the PUESBINE feature.
Interaction With Other Procedure Relocation was cancelled due to interaction
with other procedure. Invalid RAB ID The action failed because the RAB ID is
unknown in the RNC. Invalid RAB Parameters Combination The action failed due
to invalid RAB parameters combination. Invalid RAB Parameters Value The action
failed due to invalid RAB parameters value. Iu UP Failure The action failed
due to Iu UP failure. No remaining RAB The reason for the action is no
remaining RAB. RAB Pre-empted The reason for the action is that RAB is pre-
empted. Radio Connection With UE Lost The action is requested due to losing
radio connection to the UE Release Due To UE Generated Signalling Connection
Release Release requested due to UE generated signalling connection release.
Release Due To UTRAN Generated Reason Release is initiated due to UTRAN
generated reason. Relocation Cancelled The reason for the action is relocation
cancellation. Relocation Desirable for Radio Reasons The reason for requesting
relocation is radio related. Relocation Failure In Target CN/RNC Or Target
System Relocation failed due to a failure in target CN/RNC or target system.
Relocation Not Supported In Target RNC Or Target System Relocation failed
because relocation was not supported in target RNC or target system.
Relocation Target not allowed Relocation to the indicated target cell is not
allowed for the UE in question. Relocation Triggered The action failed due to
relocation. Repeated Integrity Checking Failure The action is requested due to
repeated failure in integrity checking. Request Superseded The action failed
because there was a second request on the same RAB. Requested Ciphering And/Or
Integrity Protection Algorithms Not Supported The UTRAN or the UE is unable to
support the requested ciphering and/or integrity protection algorithms.
Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate For DL Not Available The action failed because
requested guaranteed bit rate for DL is not available. Requested Guaranteed
Bit Rate For UL Not Available The action failed because requested guaranteed
bit rate for UL is not available. Requested Guaranteed Bit Rate Not Available
The action failed because requested guaranteed bit rate is not available.
Requested Information Not Available The action failed because requested
information is not available. Requested Maximum Bit Rate For DL Not Available
The action failed because requested maximum bit rate for DL is not available.
Requested Maximum Bit Rate For UL Not Available The action failed because
requested maximum bit rate for UL is not available. Requested Maximum Bit Rate
Not Available The action failed because requested maximum bit rate is not
available. Requested Request Type Not Supported The RNC is not supporting the
requested location request type either because it doesn't support the
requested event or it doesn't support the requested report area. Location
Reporting Congestion The action was not performed due to an inability to
support location reporting caused by overload. Requested Traffic Class Not
Available The action failed because requested traffic class is not available.
Requested Transfer Delay Not Achievable The action failed because requested
transfer delay is not achievable. Resource Optimisation Relocation The reason
for requesting relocation is resource optimisation. Successful Relocation The
reason for the action is completion of successful relocation. Time Critical
Relocation Relocation is requested for time critical reason i.e. this cause
value is reserved to represent all critical cases where the connection is
likely to be dropped if relocation is not performed. T~QUEUING~ Expiry The
action failed due to expiry of the timer T~QUEUING~. T~RELOCalloc~ Expiry
Relocation Resource Allocation procedure failed due to expiry of the timer
T~RELOCalloc~. T~RELOCcomplete~ Expiry The reason for the action is expiry of
timer T~RELOCcomplete~. T~RELOCoverall~ Expiry The reason for the action is
expiry of timer T~RELOCoverall~. T~RELOCprep~ Expiry Relocation Preparation
procedure is cancelled when timer T~RELOCprep~ expires. Unable To Establish
During Relocation RAB failed to establish during relocation because it cannot
be supported in the target RNC or the RAB did not exist in the source RNC.
Unknown Target RNC Relocation rejected because the target RNC is not known to
the CN. User Inactivity The action is requested due to user inactivity on one
or several non real time RABs e.g. in order to optimise radio resource. User
Plane Versions Not Supported The action failed because requested user plane
versions were not supported. RNC unable to establish all RFCs RNC couldn't
establish all RAB subflow combinations indicated within the _RAB Parameters_
IE. Reduce Load in Serving Cell Load on serving cell needs to be reduced. No
Radio Resources Available in Target Cell Load on target cell is too high.
GERAN Iu-mode failure The RAB establishment/modification/relocation failed
because the GERAN BSC cannot provide an appropriate RAB due to limited
capabilities within GERAN. Access Restricted Due to Shared Networks Access is
not permitted in the cell due to Shared Networks. Traffic Load In The Target
Cell Higher Than In The Source Cell Relocation to reduce load in the source
cell is rejected, as the target cell's traffic load is higher than that in the
source cell. MBMS - No Multicast Service For This UE The request for the
Multicase Service list of one UE was not fulfilled because the UE does not
have any active multicast service. MBMS - Unknown UE ID The request for the
Multicase Service list of one UE was not fulfilled because the CN does not
know the UE. Successful MBMS Session Start - No Data Bearer Necessary The MBMS
Session Start procedure was successfully performed, but the RNC does not have
any interested UE. MBMS - Superseded Due To NNSF The MBMS Session Start
procedure was rejected because of successful operation towards another CN
node. MBMS - UE Linking Already Done The UE linking failed, because the UE has
already been linked to the given Multicast service. MBMS - UE De-Linking
Failure - No Existing UE Linking The UE de-linking failed, because the UE had
not been linked to the given Multicast service. TMGI Unknown The requested
MBMS action failed because the indicated TMGI is unknown. Successful MBMS
Session Start -- IP Multicast Bearer established The RNC was able to join the
indicated IP Multicast Group.
* * *
* * *
Radio Network Layer cause extension Meaning IP Multicast Address And APN Not
Valid The MBMS registration failed because the IP Multicast Address and APN
are not valid. MBMS De-Registration Rejected Due To Implicit Registration The
MBMS De-registration was rejected because of implicit registration. MBMS -
Request Superseded The MBMS Registration or De-registration was superseded due
to another ongoing procedure. MBMS De-Registration During Session Not Allowed
The MBMS De-registration is not allowed during the MBMS session. MBMS - No
Data Bearer Necessary The RNC no longer have any UEs interested in the MBMS
data bearer. Periodic Location Information not Available No UE position
estimate was available when the periodic report was triggered. GTP Resources

#### 9.2.1.25 Target ID
The _Target ID_ IE identifies the target for the relocation of SRNS. The
target ID may be e.g. the target RNC-ID (for UMTS-UMTS relocation) or the Cell
Global ID of the relocation target (in case of UMTS to GSM relocation). In
case of UMTS to E-UTRAN relocation, the _Target ID_ may be either the eNB-ID
or the Corresponding RNC-ID of the relocation target.
NOTE: The mapping between the Corresponding RNC-ID and the actual eNB-ID of
the relocation target is defined by the network operator and is outside the
scope of this specification. Preferably the Target RNC ID used for an eNB
contains the LAI and RAC mapped from the GUMMEI of the MME serving the target
eNB as specified within TS 23.003 [19]. This avoids configuration of
additional identity resolutions and also gurantees that LAIs used for E-UTRAN
and UTRAN are mutually exclusive.

#### 9.2.1.43 Alternative RAB Parameter Values
The purpose of the _Alternative_ _RAB Parameter Values_ IE is to indicate
that:
\- Either RAB QoS negotiation is allowed for certain RAB parameters and, in
some cases, to indicate also which alternative values to be used in the
negotiation;
\- Or an alternative RAB configuration can be requested by the RNC.

#### 9.2.1.96 IRAT Measurement Configuration
The _IRAT Measurement Configuration_ IE contains information for instructing
the incoming UE to continue measuring the cells of the source RAT after a
successful inter-system handover. It is used by the source RAT to specify the
minimum radio quality and the period of time measurements should last for
triggering a HO report for unnecessary HO to another RAT. A subset of source
RAT frequencies to measure may be specified. The measurement bandwidth of a
carrier frequency may also be specified in order to improve the measurement
accuracy and reduce measurement time. The _IRAT Measurement Configuration_ IE
shall contain at least one of the RSRP or RSRQ thresholds. If only one of the
thresholds is present, the target RAT will use the present threshold to
compare against the measurement results received from the UE. HO Report should
be sent if there is either a single source RAT cell whose measurement results
exceed the threshold for the whole measurement duration, or a group of source
RAT cells together provide such coverage. The cells that exceed the threshold
in the first UE measurement report are included in the HO Report. If both
thresholds are present, the received radio measurements must exceed both the
RSRP and the RSRQ thresholds in order to satisfy the indicated radio
conditions. No HO Report shall be sent in case no E-UTRAN cell could be

## 9.3 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
### 9.3.0 General
RANAP ASN.1 definition conforms with ITU-T Rec. X.680 [14] and ITU-T Rec.
X.681 [15].
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of RANAP messages.
RANAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for
that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by
ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall
construct a RANAP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the
following additional rules:
\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions..
\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall
appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there
is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements
reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears
as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may
contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE: "IE" means an IE in the object set with an explicit id. If one IE needed
to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences
have different IE IDs.
If a RANAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this
shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled
as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.
Subclause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of RANAP protocol with ASN.1. In
case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this subclause and
the tabular format in subclause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence,
except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional
elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.
### 9.3.1 Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
\- for special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to
be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a
complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor
interoperability;
\- by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such
functionality shall be standardised.

# 10 Handling of Unknown, Unforeseen and Erroneous Protocol Data
## 10.1 General
Protocol Error cases can be divided into three classes:
\- Transfer Syntax Error.
\- Abstract Syntax Error.
  * Logical Error.
Protocol errors can occur in the following functions within a receiving node:
Figure 10.1: Protocol Errors in RANAP.
The information stated in subclauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, to be included in
the message used when reporting an error, is what at minimum shall be
included. Other optional information elements within the message may also be
included, if available. This is also valid for the case when the reporting is
done with a response message. The latter is an exception to what is stated in
subclause 4.1.
## 10.2 Transfer Syntax Error
A Transfer Syntax Error occurs when the receiver is not able to decode the
received physical message. Transfer syntax errors are always detected in the
process of ASN.1 decoding. If a Transfer Syntax Error occurs, the receiver
should initiate Error Indication procedure with appropriate cause value for
the Transfer Syntax protocol error.
Examples for Transfer Syntax Errors are:
\- Violation of value ranges in ASN.1 definition of messages. e.g.: If an IE
has a defined value range of 0 to 10 (ASN.1: INTEGER (0..10)), and 12 will be
received, then this will be treated as a transfer syntax error.
\- Violation in list element constraints. e.g.: If a list is defined as
containing 1 to 10 elements, and 12 elements will be received, than this case
will be handled as a transfer syntax error.
\- Missing mandatory elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the
originator of the message).
\- Wrong order of elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the
originator of the message).
## 10.3 Abstract Syntax Error
### 10.3.1 General
An Abstract Syntax Error occurs when the receiving functional RANAP entity:
1\. receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE ID);
2\. receives IEs for which the logical range is violated (e.g.: ASN.1
definition: 0 to 15, the logical range is 0 to 10 (values 11 to 15 are
undefined), and 12 will be received; this case will be handled as an abstract
syntax error using criticality information sent by the originator of the
message);
3\. does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified presence
of the concerning object, the IEs or IE groups should have been present in the
received message.
4\. receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that message in
wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE group;
5\. receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence of the
concerning object and the specified condition, the IEs or IE groups should not
have been present in the received message.
Cases 1 and 2 (not comprehended IE/IE group) are handled based on received
Criticality information. Case 3 (missing IE/IE group) is handled based on
Criticality information and Presence information for the missing IE/IE group
specified in the version of the specification used by the receiver. Case 4
(IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences) and Case 5
(erroneously present conditional IEs or IE groups) result in rejecting the
procedure.
If an Abstract Syntax Error occurs, the receiver shall read the remaining
message and shall then for each detected Abstract Syntax Error that belong to
cases 1-3 act according to the Criticality Information and Presence
Information for the IE/IE group due to which Abstract Syntax Error occurred in
accordance with subclauses 10.3.4 and 10.3.5. The handling of cases 4 and 5 is
specified in subclause 10.3.6.
### 10.3.2 Criticality Information
In the RANAP messages there is criticality information set for individual IEs
and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the receiver how to
act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not comprehended, i.e. the
entire item (IE or IE group) which is not (fully or partially) comprehended
shall be treated in accordance with its own criticality information as
specified in subclause 10.3.4.
In addition, the criticality information is used in case of the missing IE/IE
group abstract syntax error (see subclause 10.3.5).
The receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value of the
Criticality Information. The three possible values of the Criticality
Information for an IE/IE group are:
\- Reject IE.
\- Ignore IE and Notify Sender.
\- Ignore IE.
The following rules restrict when a receiving entity may consider an IE, an IE
group, or an EP not comprehended (not implemented), and when action based on
criticality information is applicable:
1\. IE or IE group: When one new or modified IE or IE group is implemented for
one EP from a standard version, then other new or modified IEs or IE groups
specified for that EP in that standard version shall be considered
comprehended by a receiving entity (some may still remain unsupported).
2\. EP: The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or
between different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not
supported may be considered not comprehended, even if another EP from that
standard version is comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be
applied.
### 10.3.3 Presence Information
For many IEs/IE groups which are optional according to the ASN.1 transfer
syntax, RANAP specifies separately if the presence of these IEs/IE groups is
optional or mandatory with respect to RNS application by means of the presence
field of the concerning object of class RANAP-PROTOCOL-IES, RANAP-PROTOCOL-
IES-PAIR, RANAP-PROTOCOL-EXTENSION or RANAP-PRIVATE-IES.
The presence field of the indicated classes supports three values:
1\. Optional;
2\. Conditional;
3\. Mandatory.
If an IE/IE group is not included in a received message and the presence of
the IE/IE group is mandatory or the presence is conditional and the condition
is true according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an
abstract syntax error occurs due to a missing IE/IE group.
If an IE/IE group is included in a received message and the presence of the
IE/IE group is conditional and the condition is false according to the version
of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due
to this erroneously present conditional IE/IE group.
### 10.3.4 Not comprehended IE/IE group
#### 10.3.4.1 Procedure Code
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality
information of the _Procedure Code_ IE according to the following:
**Reject IE:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure Code_ IE marked with \"_Reject
IE_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall
reject the procedure using the Error Indication procedure.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure Code_ IE marked with \"_Ignore
IE and Notify Sender_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall ignore the procedure and initiate the Error Indication
procedure.
**Ignore IE:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure Code_ IE marked with \"_Ignore
IE_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall
ignore the procedure.
When using the Error Indication procedure to reject a procedure or to report
an ignored procedure it shall include the _Procedure Code_ IE, the _Triggering
Message_ IE, and the _Procedure Criticality_ IE in the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE.
#### 10.3.4.1A Type of Message
When the receiving node cannot decode the _Type of Message_ IE, the Error
Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value.
#### 10.3.4.2 IEs other than the Procedure Code and Type of Message
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality
information of an IE/IE group other than the _Procedure Code_ IE and _Type of
Message_ IE according to the following:
**Reject IE:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE group marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" which the receiving node does not
comprehend; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed.
The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the rejection of one
or more IEs/IE group using the message normally used to report unsuccessful
outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating
message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to
be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and
initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report unsuccessful outcome is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication
procedure.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs marked with
\"_Reject IE_ \", that the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving
node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate
local error handling.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" which the
receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the
content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as
if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the
reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and report in the response
message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored. In
case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to
determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response
message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate
the Error Indication procedure.
\- if a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report the outcome of the procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE
groups marked with \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" which the receiving node
does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using
the understood IEs/IE groups, and initiate the Error Indication procedure to
report that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" which the receiving node does
not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using
the understood IEs/IE groups and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
**Ignore IE:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Ignore IE_ \" which the receiving node does not
comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE
groups.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with \"_Ignore IE_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups
and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were
not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" or
\"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" using a response message defined for the
procedure, the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be
included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group. In
the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE the _Repetition Number_
IE shall be included and in addition, if the not comprehended IE/IE group is
not at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex A2) also the _Message
Structure_ IE shall be included.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" or
\"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" using the Error Indication procedure, the
_Procedure Code_ IE, the _Triggering Message_ IE, _Procedure Criticality_ IE,
and the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be included in
the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group. In the
_Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE the _Repetition Number_ IE
shall be included and in addition, if the not comprehended IE/IE group is not
at message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex A2) also the _Message
Structure_ IE shall be included.
### 10.3.5 Missing IE or IE group
The receiving node shall treat the missing IE/IE group according to the
criticality information for the missing IE/IE group in the received message
specified in the version of this specification used by the receiver:
**Reject IE:**
\- if a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE
groups with specified criticality \"Reject IE\"; none of the functional
requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall reject the
procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message normally used
to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information
received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for
all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the
unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead
terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- if a received message initiating a procedure that does not have a message
to report unsuccessful outcome is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality \"Reject IE\", the receiving node shall terminate the
procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- if a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality \"Reject IE, the receiving node shall consider the
procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- if a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \",
the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with
the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and
report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups
were missing. In case the information received in the initiating message was
insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present
in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the
procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- if a received message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message
to report the outcome of the procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups
with specified criticality \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \", the receiving
node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure
based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error
Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
\- if a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \", the receiving node
shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based
on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error
Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
**Ignore IE:**
\- if a received message initiating a procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE
groups with specified criticality \"Ignore IE\", the receiving node shall
ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based on the
other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
\- if a received response message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality \"Ignore IE\", the receiving node shall ignore that
those IEs/IE groups are missing and continue with the procedure based on the
other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Reject IE_
\" or \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" using a response message defined for
the procedure, the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be
included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group. In
the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE the _Repetition Number_
IE shall be included and in addition, if the missing IE/IE group is not at
message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex A2) also the _Message
Structure_ IE shall be included.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Reject IE_
\" or \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" using the Error Indication procedure,
the _Procedure Code_ IE, the _Triggering Message_ IE, _Procedure Criticality_
IE, and the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be included
in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group. In the
_Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE the _Repetition Number_ IE
shall be included and in addition, if the missing IE/IE group is not at
message hierarchy level 1 (top level; see annex A2) also the _Message
Structure_ IE shall be included.
### 10.3.6 IEs or IE groups received in wrong order or with too many
occurrences or erroneously present
If a message with IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences
is received or if IEs or IE groups with a conditional presence are present
when the condition is not met (i.e. erroneously present), the receiving node
shall behave according to the following:
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing IEs or IE
groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present,
none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The
receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the cause value
\"Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)\" using the message
normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the
information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a
value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to
report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall
instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong
order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node
shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure, and
use cause value \"Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)\".
\- If a _response_ message is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong
order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node
shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local
error handling.
When determining the correct order only the IEs specified in the specification
version used by the receiver shall be considered.
## 10.4 Logical Error
Logical error situations occur when a message is comprehended correctly, but
the information contained within the message is not valid (i.e. semantic
error), or describes a procedure which is not compatible with the state of the
receiver. In these conditions, the following behaviour shall be performed
(unless otherwise specified) as defined by the class of the elementary
procedure, irrespective of the criticality information of the IEs/IE groups
containing the erroneous values.
**[Class 1:]{.underline}**
Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 1 procedure,
and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, this
message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value. Typical cause values
are:
\- Semantic Error.
\- Message not compatible with receiver state.
Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 1
procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this
unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error
Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The
_Procedure Code_ IE and the _Triggering Message_ IE within the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE shall then be included in order to identify the message
containing the logical error.
Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1 procedure,
the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error
handling shall be initiated.
**[Class 2:]{.underline}**
Where the logical error occurs in a message of a class 2 procedure, the
procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be
initiated with an appropriate cause value. The _Procedure Code_ IE and the
_Triggering Message_ IE within the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall then be
included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
**[Class 3:]{.underline}**
Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 3 procedure,
and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, this
message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value. Typical cause values
are:
\- Semantic Error.
\- Message not compatible with receiver state.
Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 3
procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this
unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error
Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The
_Procedure Code_ IE and the _Triggering Message_ IE within the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE shall then be included in order to identify the message
containing the logical error.
Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 3 procedure,
the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error
handling shall be initiated.
## 10.5 Exceptions
The error handling for all the cases described hereafter shall take precedence
over any other error handling described in the other subclauses of clause 10.
\- If any type of error (Transfer Syntax Error, Abstract Syntax Error or
Logical Error) is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message, it shall not
trigger the Error Indication procedure in the receiving Node but local error
handling.
\- In case a response message or Error Indication message needs to be
returned, but the information necessary to determine the receiver of that
message is missing, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully
terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
\- If an error that terminates a procedure occurs, the returned cause value
shall reflect the error that caused the termination of the procedure even if
one or more abstract syntax errors with criticality \"ignore and notify\" have
earlier occurred within the same procedure.
# 11 Special Procedures for RNC to RNC Communication
## 11.1 General
This subclause specifies special procedures that are used for RNC to RNC
communication, and that use other transport means than the RANAP procedures
specified in clause 8.
## 11.2 RANAP Relocation Information
### 11.2.1 General
The purpose of the RANAP Relocation Information procedure is to handle the
RANAP-related information that is carried transparently during relocation from
a source RNC to a target RNC by RNSAP via the Iur Interface.
### 11.2.2 Operation
When during relocation it becomes necessary in the source RNC to generate
RANAP information for transfer to the relocation target, the RNC shall form a
RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION message. The message shall be encoded according
to the encoding rules specified for RANAP in the similar manner as for the
normal RANAP messages. The outcome of the encoding will be an octet string,
which shall not be sent to the CN via the Iu Interface, but shall be given to
the appropriate local process for transparent transfer to the target RNC.
When the RANAP process in the target RNC receives an octet string containing a
RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION message that had been transparently transferred
from the source RNC, it shall decode it according to the encoding rules
specified for RANAP. This process is similar to receiving any normal RANAP
message. The decoded information shall be passed to the appropriate processes
in the RNC.
The RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION message may contain the _Direct Transfer
Information List_ IE, the _RAB Contexts List_ IE and the _Source RNC PDCP
context info_ IE. If present, the _Direct Transfer Information_ _List_ IE
shall contain the _NAS-PDU_ IE, the _SAPI_ IE and the _CN Domain Indicator_
IE. If present, the _RAB Contexts_ _List_ IE shall contain for each addressed
RAB:
\- the RAB ID IE;
\- if available, the DL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE;
\- if available, the UL GTP-PDU Sequence Number IE;
\- if available, the DL N-PDU Sequence Number IE;
\- if available, the UL N-PDU Sequence Number IE.
**Handling in case of RNSAP Relocation:**
In case of RNSAP Relocation for each CS RAB operated in support mode (see TS
25.415 [6] for the definition of "support mode") the source RNC shall include
within the RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION message the _RNSAP Relocation
Parameters_ IE containing the _RAB Parameters List_ IE which shall include the
_UP Information_ IE. For each CS RAB operated in support mode for which the
user data frame numbering is based on time the source RNC shall include the
_Timing Difference UL-DL_ IE within the _UP Information_ IE.
In case of RNSAP Relocation for each PS RAB for which data volume reporting
was configured, the source RNC shall include the _RAB Data Volume Reports_ IE
within the _RAB Parameters List_ IE included in the RANAP RELOCATION
INFORMATION message.
In case Location Reporting was configure at the source RNC for periodic
reporting and/or report upon change of Service area and/or direct reporting,
the source RNC shall include the _Location Reporting Transfer Information_ IE
within the RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION message.
The _Periodic Reporting Indicator_ IE within the _Location Reporting Transfer
Information_ IE shall be set to "periodic SAI" if periodic reporting is
requested and the location information is requested to be a Service Area
Identifier, to "periodic Geo" if periodic reporting is requested and the
location information is requested to be a geographical area.
The _Direct Reporting Indicator_ IE within the _Location Reporting Transfer
Information_ IE shall be set to "direct SAI" if periodic reporting is
requested and the location information is requested to be a Service Area
Identifier, to "direct Geo" if periodic reporting is requested and the
location information is requested to be a geographical area.
The conditions for the presence of further IEs within the Location Reporting
Transfer Information are specified in subclause 8.19.2.
If signalling based trace activation was triggered at the source RNC, the
RANAP RELOCATION INFORMATION shall contain the _UE Trace Identity_ IE and the
_Trace Propagation Parameters_ IE in order to continue tracing at the target
RNC accordingly.
## 11.3 RANAP Enhanced Relocation Information
### 11.3.1 General
The purpose of the RANAP Enhanced Relocation Information procedure is to
handle the RANAP-related information that is carried transparently during
enhanced relocation from a source RNC to a target RNC by RNSAP via the Iur
Interface.
### 11.3.2 Operation
When during enhanced relocation it becomes necessary in the source RNC to
generate RANAP information for transfer to the relocation target, the source
RNC shall form a RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message. The
message shall be encoded according to the encoding rules specified for RANAP
in the similar manner as for the normal RANAP messages. The outcome of the
encoding will be an octet string, which shall be given to the appropriate
local process for transparent transfer to the target RNC.
When the RANAP process in the target RNC receives an octet string containing a
RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message that had been
transparently transferred from the source RNC, it shall decode it according to
the encoding rules specified for RANAP. This process is similar to receiving
any normal RANAP message. The decoded information shall be passed to the
appropriate processes in the RNC.
Upon reception of the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message,
the target RNC shall initiate allocation of requested resources.
The RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message shall contain the
following IE:
\- _Source RNC To Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE;
The RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message may contain the
following IEs:
\- _Old_ _Iu Signalling Connection Identifier CS domain_ IE; if a connection
to the CS domain exist;
\- _Old Iu Signalling Connection Identifier PS domain_ IE; if a connection to
the PS domain exist;
  * _Global CN-ID for CS_ , if a connection to the CS domain exist;
  * _Global CN-ID for PS_ , if a connection to the PS domain exist;
  * _RABs to be Setup List;_
  * _SNA Access Information_ IE (if available);
\- _UESBI-Iu IE_ (if available);
\- _Selected PLMN identity_ IE if in MOCN or GWCN configuration;
\- _CN MBMS Linking Information_ IE (if available);
\- _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE.
For each RAB requested to relocate in the RABs to be Setup List, the RANAP
ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message shall contain the following
IEs in the _RABs To Be Setup List_ IE:
\- _RAB ID_ IE;
  * _CN domain indicator_ IE;
\- _RAB parameters_ IE;
\- _User Plane Information_ IE;
\- _Source Side Iu UL TNL Information_ IE;
\- _Data Volume Reporting Indication_ IE (only for PS);
\- _PDP Type Information_ IE (only for PS).
For each RAB requested to relocate the message may include the following IEs:
\- _Data Forwarding TNL Information_ IE;
\- _Service Handover_ IE;
_\- Alternative RAB Parameter Values_ IE;
_\- E-UTRAN Service Handover_ IE;
_\- PDP Type Information extension_ IE (may be included if _PDP Type
Information_ IE is included).
If the _Data Forwarding TNL Information_ IE is included in the RANAP ENHANCED
RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, it indicates Iur UP resources, made
available by the source RNC for forwarding of UL user data.
Note: The _Source Side Iu UL TNL Information_ IE (in contrary to the _Data
Forwarding TNL Information_ IE) contains information to enable the target RNC
to start transmission of user data towards the CN once the relocations has
been successfully executed.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is included in the RANAP ENHANCED
RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, the target side shall, if supported,
store the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate parameters to control the
aggregate data rate of non-GBR traffic for this UE.
The RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message shall contain the
information (if any) required by the target RNC to build at least the same set
of RABs as existing for the UE before the relocation and therefore the RANAP
ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST may contain the _RABs to be SETUP
List_ IE.
The resource allocation actions executed by the target RNC are:
If the _Relocation Type_ IE is set to \"UE involved in relocation of SRNS\":
\- The target RNC should not accept a requested RAB if the RAB did not exist
in the source RNC before the relocation;
\- The target RNC may accept a requested RAB only if the RAB can be supported
by the target RNC;
\- Other RABs shall be rejected by the target RNC in the RANAP ENHANCED
RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message with an appropriate value in the
_Cause_ IE, e.g. \"Unable to Establish During Relocation\";
\- The target RNC shall include information adapted to the resulting RAB
configuration in the target to source RNC transparent container to be included
in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message sent to the
source RNC;
\- If any alternative RAB parameter values have been used when allocating the
resources, these RAB parameter values shall be included in the RANAP ENHANCED
RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message within the _Assigned RAB Parameter
Values_ IE;
\- If _d-RNTI for No IuCS UP_ IE is contained in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION
INFORMATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall use this information to
configure the resource for the UE over Iur during the relocation.
If the _Relocation Type_ IE is set to \"UE not involved in relocation of
SRNS\":
\- The target RNC shall not accept a requested RAB if the RAB did not exist in
the source RNC before the relocation;
\- The target RNC may accept a RAB only if the radio bearer(s) for the RAB
either exist(s) already and can be used for the RAB by the target RNC, or
do(es) not exist before the relocation but can be established in order to
support the RAB in the target RNC;
\- If existing radio bearers are not related to any RAB that is accepted by
the target RNC, the radio bearers shall be ignored during the relocation of
SRNS and the radio bearers shall be released by the radio interface protocols
after completion of relocation of SRNS;
\- Usage of alternative RAB parameter values is not applicable for any
relocation of type \"UE not involved in relocation of SRNS\".
If the _UE History Information_ IE is included in the RANAP ENHANCED
RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message and the target RNC is configured to
collect the information, the target RNC shall collect the same type of
information as that included in the _UE History Information_ IE.
The _Global CN ID_ IE and _Old Iu Signalling Identifier_ IE (for PS and/or for
CS) are used by the target RNC to establish new Iu Signalling connection(s)
between the target RNC towards the CS and/or PS domain.
The RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message may also include an
alternative RAB configuration for a RAB specified in the _Alternative RAB
configuration_ IE in the _Alternative RAB Parameter Values_ IE. If
_Alternative RAB configuration_ IE for a RAB is included in the RANAP ENHANCED
RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, the target RNC is allowed to use the
alternative configuration.
The RNC shall, if supported, use the _UESBI-Iu_ IE when included in the RANAP
ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message.
If the _CN MBMS Linking Information_ IE is included in the RANAP ENHANCED
RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, the RNC shall, if supported, use the
_CN MBMS Linking Information_ IE to perform suitable UE linking as described
in TS 25.346 [42].
If the _SNA Access Information_ IE is contained in the RANAP ENHANCED
RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall store this
information and use it to determine whether the UE has access to radio
resources in the UTRAN. The target RNC shall consider that the UE is
authorised to access only the PLMNs identified by the _PLMN identity_ IE in
the _SNA Access Information_ IE. If the _Authorised SNAs_ IE is included for a
given PLMN (identified by the _PLMN identity_ IE), then the target RNC shall
consider that the access to radio resources for the concerned UE is restricted
to the LAs contained in the SNAs identified by the _SNAC_ IEs.
If the _SNA Access Information_ IE is not contained in the RANAP ENHANCED
RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message, the target RNC shall consider that no
access restriction applies to the UE in the UTRAN.
If the _Trace Recording Session Information_ IE is provided within the _Source
RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE, the Target RNC should store that
information to include it in a potential future Trace Record for that UE.
After all necessary resources for accepted RABs including the initialised Iu
user plane, are successfully allocated, the target RNC shall send a RANAP
ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message to the source RNC.
For each RAB successfully setup the RNC shall include the following IEs in the
_RABs Setup List_ IE:
_\- RAB ID._
For each RAB the target RNC has admitted to execute data forwarding, the
target RNC shall include the _Data Forwarding Information_ IE in the RANAP
ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message. If no ALCAP is used, the RNC
shall include the _DL Forwarding Transport Layer Address_ IE and the _DL
Forwarding Transport Association_ IE within the _Data Forwarding Information_
IE in the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message.
If applicable, the target RNC shall have executed the initialisation of the
user plane mode between the source and the target RNC as requested by the
source RNC in the _User Plane Mode_ IE. If the target RNC can not initialise
the requested user plane mode for any of the user plane mode versions in the
_UP Mode Versions_ IE according to the rules for initialisation of the
respective user plane mode versions, as described in TS 25.415 [6], the target
RNC may either decide to not relocate the respective RAB or to omit data
forwarding for that RAB.
For each RAB the RNC is not able to setup during the Enhanced Relocation
Information procedure, the RNC shall include the _CN Domain Indicator_ IE _RAB
ID_ IE and the _Cause_ IE within the _RABs Failed To Setup_ IE. The resources
associated with the RABs indicated as failed to set up shall not be released
in the source RNC until the relocation is completed. This is in order to make
a return to the old configuration possible in case of a failed or cancelled
relocation.
The RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION RESPONSE message sent to the source
RNC shall, if applicable, include the _Target RNC To Source RNC Transparent
Container_ IE.
**Handling in case of RNSAP Relocation:**
In case of RNSAP Relocation for each CS RAB operated in support mode (see TS
25.415 [6] for the definition of "support mode") the source RNC shall include
within the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION INFORMATION REQUEST message the _RAB
Parameters List_ IE which shall include the _UP Information_ IE. For each CS
RAB operated in support mode for which the user data frame numbering is based
on time the source RNC shall include the _Timing Difference UL-DL_ IE within
the _UP Information_ IE.
The source RNC shall also include within the RANAP ENHANCED RELOCATION
INFORMATION REQUEST message
\- the _CSG ID_ IE (if available)
\- the _CSG Membership Status_ IE (if available).
###### ## Annex A (informative): RANAP guidelines
## A.1 Rules for building RANAP messages
### A.1.1 Rules for RANAP messages that shall contain the CN Domain Indicator
IE
Based on the principles described in TS 25.401 [3], the following rules can be
deduced:
1) The following RANAP messages initiating a connection oriented signalling
connection shall contain the _CN Domain Indicator_ IE: INITIAL UE MESSAGE
message and RELOCATION REQUEST message.
2) Any RANAP message belonging to class 1 procedures and which uses
connectionless signalling shall contain the _CN Domain Indicator_ IE.
3) The following RANAP messages belonging to class 2 procedures and using
connectionless signalling shall contain the _CN Domain Indicator_ IE: PAGING
message and ERROR INDICATION message, the OVERLOAD message in DL direction
(see chapter 8.25.3.1) may contain the _CN Domain Indicator_ IE.
## A.2 Guidelines for Usage of the Criticality Diagnostics IE
### A.2.1 EXAMPLE MESSAGE Layout
Assume the following message format:

NOTE 1: The IEs F, J, and L do not have assigned criticality. The IEs F, J,
and L are consequently realised as the ASN.1 type SEQUENCE OF of \"ordinary\"
ASN.1 type, e.g. INTEGER. On the other hand, the repeatable IEs with assigned
criticality are realised as the ASN.1 type SEQUENCE OF of an IE object, e.g.
ProtocolIE-Container.
For the corresponding ASN.1 layout, see subclause A.2.4.
### A.2.2 Example on a Received EXAMPLE MESSAGE
Assume further more that a received message based on the above tabular format
is according to the figure below.

###### ## Annex B (informative): RANAP Transparent containers content
Transparent containers are used in order to transfer information from one RAN
node to another RAN node. Depending on the particular scenario the behaviour
of both involved RAN nodes may be either specified according to the same radio
system or according to different radio systems. During an inter-system
handover the source RAN node has to adopt to the target RAN node and its
requirements.
In RANAP, for intra-system relocation and inter-system handover to and from
E-UTRAN, there is a single transparent container defined for transporting
information from the source to the target RAN node and a single transparent
container for transporting information from the target to the source RAN node
during relocation/handover preparation: the _Source to Target Transparent
Container_ IE and the _Target to Source Transparent Container_ IE, which may
carry either UTRAN or E-UTRAN specific information.
Note: The definition of generic transparent containers for relocation/handover
purposes allows to transport them through the core network in a RAT-agnostic
way. Inter-system handover to GERAN is not affected by this scheme.
Therefore the container content is encoded according to the rules which are
specified for in the target radio system. In subclause 8.6.2, it is described
how the transparent container shall be encoded with respect to the scenario in
which it is used.
The table below is showing all possible scenarios and definitions according to
which the content of the transparent container shall be encoded. Additionally
the reference to the specification defining particular IE is given.
Table B.1: Specification of Transparent Containers referenced in RANAP.

###### ## Annex C (informative): Processing of Transparent Containers at the
SGSN
Irrespective of the mobility scenario (inter-RAT or intra-UMTS), the SGSN
always processes the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE and the
_Target to Source Transparent Container_ IE in the following way:
\- The SGSN shall convey to the RNC the information received within
\- the GTPv1-C \"UTRAN transparent field\" of the \"UTRAN Transparent
Container\" IE across the Gn interface (see subclause 7.7.38 of TS 29.060
[35]), or
\- the GTPv2 \"F-container field\" of the \"F-Container\" IE across the S3/S16
interface (see subclause 8.48 of TS 29.274 [36])
> by including it in either the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE or
> the _Target to Source Transparent Container_ of the corresponding RANAP
> message.
\- The SGSN shall convey to the GTP peer the information received within
either the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE or the _Target to
Source Transparent Container_ IE by including it in
\- the GTPv1-C \"UTRAN transparent field\" of the \"UTRAN Transparent
Container\" IE across the Gn interface (see subclause 7.7.38 of TS 29.060
[35]), or
\- the GTPv2 \"F-container field\" of the \"F-Container\" IE across the S3/S16
interface (see subclause 8.48 of TS 29.274 [36]).
