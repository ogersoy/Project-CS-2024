# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies requirements on UEs supporting a DB-DC-HSDPA
and 4C-HSDPA configuration that is independent of release. TSG-RAN has agreed
that the standardisation of new configurations may be independent of a
release. However, in order to implement a UE that conforms to a particular
release but supports a configuration that is specified in a later release, it
is necessary to specify some extra requirements.
For example, Band I-XI combination for DB-DC-HSDPA (referred to as DB-DC-HSDPA
configuration 4 in [2]) is contained in the Release 10 specifications. In
order to implement a UE conforming to Release 9 but supporting this
configuration, it is necessary for the UE to additionally conform to some
parts of the Release 10 specifications, such as the radio frequency and radio
resource management requirements for the configuration.
Similarly, 4C-HSDPA configuration I-3 is contained in the Release 11
specification [3]. In order to implement a UE conforming to Release 10, but
supporting this configuration, it is necessary for the UE to additionally
conform to some parts of the Release 11 specifications.
