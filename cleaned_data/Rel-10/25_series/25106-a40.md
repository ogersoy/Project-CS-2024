# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**Donor coupling loss:** is the coupling loss between the repeater and the
donor base station.
**Down-link** : Signal path where base station transmits and mobile receives.
**Operating band** : the frequency range in which UTRA FDD operates, that is
defined with a specific set of technical requirements.
NOTE 1: The operating band(s) for an UTRA Repeater is declared by the
manufacturer according to the designations in clause 5.1, Table 5.1.
NOTE 2: Unless specified, operating band refers to the uplink operating band
and downlink operating band.
**Pass band:** The frequency range in which the repeater operates in with
operational configuration. This frequency range can correspond to one or
several consecutive nominal 5 MHz channels. If they are not consecutive each
subset of channels shall be considered as an individual pass band. A repeater
can have one or several pass bands.
**Repeater:** A device that receives, amplifies and transmits the radiated or
conducted RF carrier both in the down-link direction (from the base station to
the mobile area) and in the up-link direction (from the mobile to the base
station).
**Up-link:** Signal path where mobile transmits and base station receives.

# 4 General
This specification applies only to UTRA-FDD repeaters.
Unless otherwise stated, all requirements in this specification apply to both
the up-link and down-link directions.
## 4.1 Relationship between Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The repeater test specification 25.143 section 5 [2]
defines Test Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated for
each test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in
this specification to create Test Requirements.
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 section 6.5
[4].
## 4.2 Regional requirements
Some requirements in TS 25.106 may only apply in certain regions. Table 4.1
lists all requirements that may be applied differently in different regions.

b) A UTRA/FDD repeater can support both fixed and variable up-link to down-
link frequency separation.
c) The use of other up-link to down-link frequency separations in existing or
other frequency bands shall not be precluded.
## 5.3 Channel arrangement
### 5.3.1 Channel spacing
The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.3.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the centre
frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition, a number of
additional centre frequencies are specified according to the table 5.3, which
means that and the centre frequencies for these channels are shifted 100 kHz
relative to the general raster.
### 5.3.3 Channel number
The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (UARFCN).
For each operating band, the UARFCN values are defined as follows.
Uplink: N~U~ = 5 * (F~UL~ - F~UL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~UL_low~ ≤ F~UL~ ≤ F~UL_high~
Downlink: N~D~ = 5 * (F~DL~ - F~DL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~DL_low~ ≤ F~DL~ ≤ F~DL_high~
For each operating Band, F~UL_Offset~, F~UL_low~, F~UL_high~, F~DL_Offset~,,
F~DL_low~ and F~DL_high~ are defined in Table 5.3 for the general UARFCN. For
the additional UARFCN, F~UL_Offset~, F~DL_Offset~ and the specific F~UL~ and
F~DL~ are defined in Table 5.4.

# 6 Output power
Output power, Pout, of the repeater is the mean power of one carrier at
maximum repeater gain delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal
load impedance of the transmitter.
Rated output power, PRAT, of the repeater is the mean power level per carrier
at maximum repeater gain that the manufacturer has declared to be available at
the antenna connector.
## 6.1 Maximum output power
Maximum output power, Pmax, of the repeater is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector in specified reference condition.
### 6.1.1 Minimum Requirements
The requirements shall apply at maximum gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass
band of the repeater, at levels that produce the maximum rated output power
per channel.
When the power of all signals is increased by 10 dB, compared to the power
level that produce the maximum rated output power, the requirements shall
still be met.
In normal conditions, the Repeater maximum output power shall remain within
limits specified in Table 6.1 relative to the manufacturer\'s rated output
power.
Table 6.1: Repeater output power; normal conditions
* * *
Rated output power Limit P ≥ 43 dBm +2 dB and -2 dB 39 ≤ P \< 43 dBm +2 dB and
-2 dB 31 ≤ P \< 39 dBm +2 dB and -2 dB P \< 31 dBm +3 dB and -3 dB
* * *
In extreme conditions, the Repeater maximum output power shall remain within
the limits specified in Table 6.2 relative to the manufacturer\'s rated output
power.
Table 6.2: Repeater output power; extreme conditions
* * *
Rated output power Limit P ≥ 43 dBm +2,5 dB and -2,5 dB 39 ≤ P \< 43 dBm +2,5
dB and -2,5 dB 31 ≤ P \< 39 dBm +2,5 dB and -2,5 dB P \< 31 dBm +4 dB and -4
dB
* * *
In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may apply
also for some conditions outside the ranges of conditions defined as normal.
# 7 Frequency stability
Frequency stability is the ability to maintain the same frequency on the
output signal with respect to the input signal.
## 7.1 Minimum requirement
The frequency deviation of the output signal with respect to the input signal
shall be no more than ±0,01 ppm.
# 8 Out of band gain
Out of band gain refers to the gain of the repeater outside the pass band.
## 8.1 Minimum requirement
The intended use of a repeater in a system is to amplify the in band signals
and not to amplify the out of band emission of the donor base station.
In the intended application of the repeater, the out of band gain is less than
the donor coupling loss.
The repeater minimum donor coupling loss shall be declared by the
manufacturer. This is this the minimum required attenuation between the donor
BS and the repeater for proper repeater operation.
The gain outside the pass band shall not exceed the maximum level specified in
table 8.1, where:
\- f_offset is the distance from the centre frequency of the first or last 5
MHz channel within the pass band.

For 12,5 MHz ≤ f_offset the out of band gain shall not exceed the maximum gain
of table 8.2 or the maximum gain stated in table 8.1 whichever is lower.

# 9 Unwanted emission
Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious emissions
[1]. Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the pass
band bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the
transmitter, but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are
emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics
emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency
conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
The out-of-band emissions requirement for repeater is specified both in terms
operating band unwanted emissions and protection of the BS receiver in the
operating band. The Operating band unwanted emissions define all unwanted
emissions in the repeater operating band plus the frequency ranges 10 MHz
above and 10 MHz below that band. Unwanted emissions outside of this frequency
range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.
## 9.1 Out of band emission
### 9.1.1 Void
### 9.1.2 Operating band unwanted emissions
Operating band unwanted emissions comprise an emission mask applied outside
the repeater passband and a general requirement applied outside the mask but
inside the frequency range of the operating band unwanted emissions.
The general operating band unwanted emissions limits are given in table 9.0

The mask defined in tables 9.1 to 9.4 below may be mandatory in certain
regions. In other regions this mask may not be applied.
For regions where this clause applies, the requirement shall be met by a
repeater\'s RF-signal output at maximum gain with WCDMA signals in the pass
band of the repeater, at levels that produce the maximum rated output power
per channel. The requirements shall also apply at maximum gain without WCDMA
signals in the pass band.
Emissions shall not exceed the maximum level specified in tables 9.1 to 9.4
for the appropriate repeater maximum output power, in the frequency range from
∆f = 2,5 MHz to ∆f~max~ from the 5 MHz channel, where:
\- ∆f is the separation between the centre frequency of first or last 5 MHz
channel used in the pass band and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring
filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the centre frequency of first or last 5
MHz channel in the pass band and the centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is 12,5 MHz.
\- ∆f ~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measurement filter.

NOTE: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the repeater emissions
at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder
loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the
repeater needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement. Compliance
with the regional requirement can be determined using the method outlined in
TS 25.104 [6] Annex D.
Note for Tables 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.4A, 9.4B and 9.4C:
NOTE 1: This frequency range ensures that the range of values of f_offset is
continuous.
### 9.1.3. Protection of the BS receiver in the operating band
This requirement shall be applied for the protection of UTRA FDD BS receiver
in geographic areas in which UTRA-FDD Repeater and UTRA-FDD BS are deployed.
The requirement applies outside the emission mask.
#### 9.1.3.1 Minimum Requirement
This requirement applies to the uplink of the repeater, at maximum gain.
The power of any operating band unwanted emission shall not exceed the limits
in Table 9.7A.

NOTE 1: These requirements in Table 9.7A: for the uplink direction of the
Repeater reflect what can be achieved with present state of the art technology
and are based on a coupling loss of 73 dB between a Repeater and a UTRA FDD BS
receiver.
NOTE 2: The requirements shall be reconsidered when the state of the art
technology progresses.
NOTE 3: The protection of R-GSM is for further study.
### 9.1.4 Co-existence with services in adjacent frequency bands
This requirement may be applied for the protection in bands adjacent to bands
I, or VII, as defined in clause 5.1 in geographic areas in which both an
adjacent band service and UTRA are deployed.
The requirement applies only to the down-link direction of the repeater.
#### 9.1.4.1 Minimum requirement
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

## 9.2 Spurious emissions
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter
effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation
products and frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
This is measured at the repeaters RF output port.
The spurious emission limits apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz (or above, as
indicated in Table 9.5 and 9.5A), excluding the frequency range from 10 MHz
below the lowest frequency of the repeaters operating band up to 10 MHz above
the highest frequency of the repeaters operating band. Exceptions are the
requirement in Table 9.13 and 9.16 that apply also closer than 10 MHz from
repeaters operating band.
Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.
### 9.2.1 General Requirements
The requirements of either subclause 9.2.1.1 or subclause 9.2.1.2 shall apply
whatever the type of repeater considered (one or several pass bands). It
applies for all configurations foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.
#### 9.2.1.1 Minimum Requirement (Category A)
The following requirements shall be met in cases where Category A limits for
spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 [1], are
applied.
At maximum repeater gain, with WCDMA signals in the pass band of the repeater,
at levels that produce the maximum rated output power per channel, the power
of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits specified in table 9.5.
The requirements shall also apply at maximum gain without WCDMA signals in the
pass band.
When the power in all channels is increased by 10 dB, compared to the input
level producing the maximum rated output power, the requirement shall still be
met.

# 10 Modulation accuracy
## 10.1 Error Vector Magnitude
The modulation accuracy is defined by the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM), which
is a measure of the difference between the theoretical waveform and a modified
version of the measured waveform. This difference is called the error vector.
The measured waveform is modified by first passing it through a matched root
raised cosine filter with bandwidth 3.84 MHz and roll-off α=0.22. The waveform
is then further modified by selecting the frequency, absolute phase, absolute
amplitude and chip clock timing so as to minimise the error vector. The EVM
result is defined as root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the
mean reference signal power expressed as a %.
The measurement interval is one power control group (timeslot). The repeater
shall operate with an ideal WCDMA signal in the pass band of the repeater at a
level, which produce the maximum rated output power per channel, as specified
by the manufacturer.
### 10.1.1 Minimum requirement
The Error Vector Magnitude shall not be worse than 12,5 %.
## 10.2 Peak code domain error
The peak code domain error is computed by projecting the power of the error
vector (as defined in subclause 10.1) onto the code domain at a specified
spreading factor. The code domain error for every code in the domain is
defined as the ratio of the mean power of the projection onto that code, to
the mean power of the composite reference waveform. This ratio is expressed in
dB. The peak code domain error is defined as the maximum value for the code
domain error for all codes. The measurement interval is one power control
group (timeslot).
### 10.2.1 Minimum requirement
The peak code domain error shall not exceed -35 dB at spreading factor 256.
## 10.3 Relative Code Domain Error (RCDE) for 64QAM modulation
The Relative Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the error vector (as
defined in 10.1) onto the code domain at a specified spreading factor. Only
the active code channels in the composite reference waveform are considered
for this requirement. The Relative Code Domain Error for every active code is
defined as the ratio of the mean power of the error projection onto that code,
to the mean power of the active code in the composite reference waveform. This
ratio is expressed in dB. The measurement interval is one frame.
The requirement for Relative Code Domain Error is only applicable for Repeater
supporting 64QAM modulated codes.
### 10.3.1 Minimum requirement
The average Relative Code Domain Error for 64QAM modulated codes shall not
exceed -21 dB at spreading factor 16.
# 11 Input Intermodulation
The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the repeater to
inhibit the generation of interference in the pass band, in the presence of
interfering signals on frequencies other than the pass band.
## 11.1 General Requirement
The following requirement applies for interfering signals in the frequency
bands defined in sub-clause 5.1, depending on the repeaters pass band. The
requirement shall bet met with the repeater operating at maximum gain.
### 11.1.1 Minimum requirement
For the parameters specified in table 11.1, the power in the pass band, shall
not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the repeater as measured in
the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained without
interfering signals applied.
The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be adjusted
so that the 3^rd^ order intermodulation product is positioned in the centre of
the pass band.
Table 11.1 specifies the parameters for two interfering signals, where:
\- f_offset is the separation between the centre frequency of first or last 5
MHz channel in the pass band and one the interfering signals.
Table 11.1: Input intermodulation requirement
* * *
f_offset Interfering Signal Levels Type of signals Measurement bandwidth 3,5
MHz -40 dBm 2 CW carriers 1 MHz
* * *
## 11.2 Co-location with BS in other systems
The requirement shall bet met with the repeater operating at maximum gain.
### 11.2.1 Minimum requirements - Co-location with GSM, DCS, PCS, UTRA FDD
and/or E-UTRA FDD
This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of FDD Repeater input when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, E-UTRA
FDD and/or UTRA FDD BS are co-located with a UTRA FDD Repeater.
For the parameters specified in table 11.2, the power in the pass band shall
not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the repeater as measured in
the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained without
interfering signals applied.
The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be adjusted
so that the lowest order intermodulation product is positioned in the centre
of the pass band.
NOTE 1: The lowest intermodulation product corresponds to the 4^th^ and 3^rd^
order for the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, respectively.

### 11.2.2 Minimum Requirement - Co-location with UTRA-TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD
An additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of FDD BS receivers when UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD is co-located
with a UTRA FDD Repeater.
The requirements in this chapter assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
transmitter and receiver.
The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-location with UTRA-TDD on adjacent frequencies for 30dB BS-
Repeater minimum coupling loss.
However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These
techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [5].

## 11.3 Co-existence with other systems
The following requirement may be applied when GSM 900, DCS 1800, PCS1900,
GSM850, E-UTRA FDD, E-UTRA TDD BS and/or UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD BS operating in
another frequency band and UTRA-FDD Repeaters co-exist. The requirement shall
bet met with the repeater operating at maximum gain.
### 11.3.1 Minimum requirements
For the parameters specified in table 11.3 and table 11.3A, the power in the
pass band shall not increase with more than 10 dB at the output of the
repeater as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level
obtained without interfering signals applied.
The frequency separation between the two interfering signals shall be adjusted
so that the lowest order intermodulation product is positioned in the centre
of the pass band.
NOTE 1: The lowest intermodulation product corresponds to the 4^th^ and 3^rd^
order for the GSM 900 and DCS 1800 bands, respectively.

## 12 Output intermodulation
The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the ability of the
repeater to inhibit the generation of intermodulation products signals created
by the presence of an interfering signal reaching the repeater via the output
port.
The output intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation products
when a WCDMA modulated interference signal is injected into the output port at
a level of 30 dB lower than that of the wanted signal. The frequency of the
interference signal shall be ±5 MHz, ±10 MHz and ±15 MHz offset from the
wanted signal, but within the frequency band allocated for UTRA FDD downlink
as specified in subclause 4.1.
The requirement is applicable for downlink signals.
### 12.1 Minimum requirement
The output intermodulation level shall not exceed the out of band emission or
the spurious emission requirements of section 9.1 and 9.2.
# 13 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
## 13.1 Definitions and applicability
Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the RRC weighted gain
per carrier of the repeater in the pass band to the RRC weighted gain of the
repeater on an adjacent channel.
The requirement shall apply to the Uplink and Downlink of Repeater where the
donor link is maintained via antennas (over the air Repeater).
## 13.2 Minimum Requirements
In normal conditions the ACRR shall be higher than the value specified in the
Table 13.1.
Table 13.1: Repeater ACRR

Repeater maximum output power as in 9.1.1 Channel offset from the centre
frequency of the first or last 5 MHz channel within the pass band. ACRR limit
