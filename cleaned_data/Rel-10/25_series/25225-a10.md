# 4 Control of UE/UTRAN measurements
In this clause the general measurement control concept of the higher layers is
briefly described to provide an understanding on how L1 measurements are
initiated and controlled by higher layers.
## 4.1 General measurement concept
L1 provides with the measurement specifications a toolbox of measurement
abilities for the UE and the UTRAN. These measurements can be differentiated
in different measurement types: intra-frequency, inter-frequency, inter-
system, traffic volume, quality and internal measurements (see [14]).\ In the
L1 measurement specifications the measurements are distinguished between
measurements in the UE (the messages will be described in the RRC Protocol)
and measurements in the UTRAN (the messages will be described in the NBAP and
the Frame Protocol).
To initiate a specific measurement the UTRAN transmits a 'measurement control
message' to the UE including a measurement ID and type, a command (setup,
modify, release), the measurement objects and quantity, the reporting
quantities, criteria (periodical/event-triggered) and mode
(acknowledged/unacknowledged), see [14].\ When the reporting criteria is
fulfilled the UE shall answer with a 'measurement report message' to the UTRAN
including the measurement ID and the results.\ In idle mode the measurement
control message is broadcast in a System Information.
Intra-frequency reporting events, traffic volume reporting events and UE
internal measurement reporting events described in [14] define events which
trigger the UE to send a report to the UTRAN. This defines a toolbox from
which the UTRAN can choose the needed reporting events.
## 4.2 Measurements for cell selection/reselection
Whenever a PLMN has been selected the UE shall start to find a suitable cell
to camp on, this is 'cell selection'.
When camped on cell the UE regularly searches for a better cell depending on
the cell reselection criteria, this is called 'cell reselection'. The
procedures for cell selection and reselection are described in [13] and the
measurements carried out by the UE are explained in this specification.
## 4.3 Measurements for Handover
For the handover preparation the UE receives from the UTRAN a list of cells
(e.g. TDD, FDD or GSM).which the UE shall monitor (see 'monitored set' in
[14]) in its idle timeslots.
At the beginning of the measurement process the UE shall find synchronization
to the cell to measure using the synchronization channel. This is described
under 'cell search' in [9] if the monitored cell is a TDD cell and in [4] if
it is an FDD cell.
For a TDD cell to monitor after this procedure the exact timing of the
midamble of the P-CCPCH is known and the measurements can be performed.
Depending on the UE implementation and if timing information about the cell to
monitor is available, the UE may perform the measurements on the P-CCPCH
directly without prior SCH synchronisation.
## 4.4 Measurements for DCA
DCA is used to optimise the resource allocation by means of a channel quality
criteria or traffic parameters. The DCA measurements are configured by the
UTRAN. The UE reports the measurements to the UTRAN.
For DCA no measurements are performed in idle mode in the serving TDD cell.
When connecting with the initial access the UE immediately starts measuring
the ISCP of time slots which are communicated on the BCH. The measurements and
the preprocessing are done while the UTRAN assigns an UL channel for the UE
for signalling and measurement reporting.
In connected mode the UE performs measurements according to a measurement
control message from the UTRAN.
## 4.5 Measurements for timing advance
To update timing advance of a moving UE the UTRAN measures 'Received Timing
Deviation', i.e. the time difference of the received UL transmission (PRACH,
DPCH, PUSCH) in relation to its timeslot structure that means in relation to
the ideal case where an UL transmission would have zero propagation delay. The
measurements are reported to higher layers, where timing advance values are
calculated and signalled to the UE.
# 5 Measurement abilities for UTRA TDD
In this clause the physical layer measurements reported to higher layers.
(this may also include UE internal measurements not reported over the air-
interface) are defined.
## 5.1 UE measurement abilities
The structure of the table defining a UE measurement quantity is shown below.
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Column field** | Comment | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Definition** | Contains the definition of the measurement. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Applicable for** | States in which RRC state according to [14] | | | a measurement shall be possible to be | | | performed. For RRC connected mode states | | | information is also given on the possibility | | | to perform the measurement on intra-frequency | | | and/or inter-frequency. | | | | | | The following terms are used in the tables: | | | | | | Idle = Shall be possible to perform in idle | | | mode; | | | | | | URA_PCH = Shall be possible to perform in | | | URA_PCH; | | | | | | CELL_PCH = Shall be possible to perform in | | | CELL_PCH; | | | | | | CELL_FACH = Shall be possible to perform in | | | CELL_FACH; | | | | | | CELL_DCH = Shall be possible to perform in | | | CELL_DCH; | | | | | | For all RRC connected mode states i.e. | | | URA_PCH, CELL_PCH, CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH | | | | | | Intra appended to the RRC state = Shall be | | | possible to perform in the corresponding RRC | | | state on an intra-frequency cell; | | | | | | Inter appended to the RRC state = Shall be | | | possible to perform in the corresponding RRC | | | state on an inter-frequency cell. | | | | | | Inter-RAT appended to the RRC state = Shall be | | | possible to perform in the corresponding RRC | | | state on an inter-RAT cell. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
NOTE 1: Measurements for TDD which are specified on the Primary CCPCH
(P-CCPCH) are carried out on the P-CCPCH or on any other beacon channel, see
[6].
NOTE 2: For the beacon channels [6], the received power measurements shall be
based on the received power for midamble m^(1)^ if no Space Code Transmit
Diversity (SCTD) is applied to the P-CCPCH and on the sum of the received
powers for midambles m^(1)^ and m^(2)^ if SCTD is applied to the P-CCPCH.
NOTE 3: The UTRAN has to take into account the UE capabilities when specifying
the timeslots to be measured in the measurement control message.
NOTE 4: The line 'applicable for' indicates whether the measurement is
applicable for inter-frequency and/or intra-frequency and furthermore for idle
and/or connected mode.
NOTE 5: The Interference part of the SIR measurement will be dependent on the
receiver implementation, and will normally be different from the Timeslot ISCP
measurement.
NOTE 6: The measurement 'Timeslot ISCP' is only a measure of the intercell
interference.
NOTE 7: The term \"antenna connector of the UE\" used in this sub-clause to
define the reference point for the UE measurements is defined in [17].
NOTE 8: Performance and reporting requirements for the UE measurements are
defined in [19].

###### ## Annex A (informative): Monitoring GSM from TDD: Calculation Results
## A.1 Low data rate traffic using 1 uplink and 1 downlink slot (for the 3.84
Mcps option)
NOTE: The section evaluates the time to acquire the FCCH if all idle slots are
devoted to the tracking of a FCCH burst, meaning that no power measurements is
done concurrently. The derived figures are better than those for GSM. The
section does not derive though any conclusion. A conclusion may be that the
use of the idle slots is a valid option. An alternative conclusion may be that
this is the only mode to be used, removing hence the use of the slotted frames
for low data traffic or the need for a dual receiver, if we were to
considering the monitoring of GSM cells only, rather than GSM, TDD and FDD.
If a single synthesiser UE uses only one uplink and one downlink slot, e.g.
for speech communication, the UE is not in transmit or receive state during 13
slots in each frame. According to the timeslot numbers allocated to the
traffic, this period can be split into two continuous idle intervals A and B
as shown in the figure below.
Figure A.1: Possible idle periods in a frame with two occupied timeslots
A is defined as the number of idle slots between the Tx and Rx slots and B the
number of idle slots between the Rx and Tx slots. It is clear that A+B=13 time
slots.
In the scope of low cost terminals, a [0.8] ms period is supposed to be
required to perform a frequency jump from UMTS to GSM. This lets possibly two
free periods of A*Ts-1.6 ms and B*Ts-1.6 ms during which the mobile station
can monitor GSM, Ts being the slot period.
Following table evaluates the average synchronisation time and maximum
synchronisation time, where the announced synchronisation time corresponds to
the time needed to find the FCCH. The FCCH is supposed to be perfectly
detected meaning that the FCCH is found if it is entirely present in the
monitoring window. The FCCH being found the SCH location is unambiguously
known from that point. All the 13 idle slots are assumed to be devoted to FCCH
tracking and the UL traffic is supposed to occupy the time slot 0.

timeslots per frame and with 0.8 ms switching time (*)

(*) All simulations have been performed with a random initial delay between
GSM frames and UMTS frames.
Each configuration of TS allocation described above allows a monitoring period
sufficient to acquire synchronisation.
### A.1.1 Higher data rate traffic using more than 1 uplink and/or 1 downlink
TDD timeslot
The minimum idle time to detect a complete FCCH burst for all possible
alignments between the GSM and the TDD frame structure (called 'guaranteed
FCCH detection'), assuming that monitoring happens every TDD frame, can be
calculated as follows (t~FCCH~ = one GSM slot):
{width="3.722916666666667in" height="0.42986111111111114in"}
\- (e.g for t~synth~ =0ms: 3 TDD **consecutive** idle timeslots needed, for
t~synth~ =0,3ms: 3 slots, for t~synth~ =0,5ms: 4 slots, for t~synth~ =0,8ms: 5
slots). Under this conditions the FCCH detection time can never exceed the
time of 660ms.
\- (For a more general consideration t~synth~ may be considered as a sum of
all delays before starting monitoring is possible).
\- For detecting SCH instead of FCCH (for a parallel search) the same equation
applies.
\- In the equation before the dual synthesiser UE is included if the
synthesiser switching time is 0ms.
Table A.2: FCCH detection time for a dual synthesizer UE monitoring GSM from
TDD every TDD frame

In the table above for a given number of occupied slots in the TDD mode all
possible cases of distributions of these occupied TDD slots are considered
(see 'cases'). For every case arbitrary alignments of the TDD and the GSM
frame structure are taken into account for calculating the average FCCH
detection time (only these cases are used which guarantee FCCH detection for
all alignments; only the non-parallel FCCH search is reflected by the
detection times in the table 2).
The term 'occupied slots' means that the UE is not able to monitor in these
TDD slots.
For a synthesiser switching time of one or one half TDD timeslot the number of
needed consecutive idle TDD timeslots is summarized in the table below:
Table A.3: Link between the synthesiser performance and the number of free
consecutive TSs for guaranteed FCCH detection, needed for GSM monitoring
* * *
One-way switching time for the synthesiser Number of free consecutive TDD
timeslots needed in the frame for a guaranteed FCCH detection 1 TS (=2560
chips) 5 0.5 TS (=1280 chips) 4 0 (dual synthesiser) 3
* * *
## A.2 Low data rate traffic using 1 uplink and 1 downlink slot (for the 1.28
Mcps option)
NOTE: The section evaluates the time to acquire the FCCH if all idle slots are
devoted to the tracking of a FCCH burst, meaning that no power measurements is
done concurrently. The derived figures are better than those for GSM. The
section does not derive though any conclusion. A conclusion may be that the
use of the idle slots is a valid option. An alternative conclusion may be that
this is the only mode to be used, removing hence the use of the slotted frames
for low data traffic or the need for a dual receiver, if we were to
considering the monitoring of GSM cells only, rather than GSM, TDD and FDD.
If a single synthesiser UE uses only one uplink and one downlink slot, e.g.
for speech communication, the UE is not in transmit or receive state during 5
slots in each frame. According to the timeslot numbers allocated to the
traffic, this period can be split into two continuous idle intervals A and B
as shown in the figure below.
Figure A.2: Possible idle periods in a subframe with two occupied timeslots
A is defined as the number of idle slots between the Tx and Rx slots and B the
number of idle slots between the Rx and Tx slots. It is clear that A+B=5 time
slots and C is equal to the DwPTS+GP+UpPTS.
In the scope of low cost terminals, a [0.5] ms period is supposed to be
required to perform a frequency jump from 1.28Mcps TDD to GSM and vice versa.
This lets possibly two free periods of A*Timeslots-1 ms and B*Timeslots+C-1 ms
during which the mobile station can monitor GSM, Timeslots being the slot
period.
Following table evaluates the average synchronisation time and maximum
synchronisation time, where the announced synchronisation time corresponds to
the time needed to find the FCCH. The FCCH is supposed to be perfectly
detected which means that it is entirely present in the monitoring window. The
FCCH being found the SCH location is unambiguously known from that point. All
the 5 idle slots and the DwPTS+GP+UpPTS are assumed to be devoted to FCCH
tracking and the UL traffic is supposed to occupy the time slot 1.

GSM frames and 1.28Mcps TDD sub-frames.
Each configuration of Timeslots allocation described above allows a monitoring
period sufficient to acquire synchronisation.
NOTE: Considering about the frame structure of 1.28Mcps TDD, there are total 7
timeslots in each sub-frame that can be used as data traffic. If more than 1
uplink and/or 1 downlink TDD timeslot are used for data traffic, that means it
will occupy at least 3 time slots, equal to 0.675*3=2.205ms. And more time
slots for traffic data means more switching point are needed to switch between
the GSM and the 1.28Mcps TDD. As it was mentioned above, each switching will
take 0.5ms. As a result, the idle time left for monitoring the GSM will be
very little. So monitoring GSM from 1.28Mcps TDD under this situation will be
considered in the future. It will need more carefully calculation and
simulation.
### A.2.1 Higher data rate traffic using more than 1 uplink and/or 1 downlink
TDD timeslot (for 1.28Mcps TDD)
The minimum idle time to detect a complete FCCH burst for all possible
alignments between the GSM and the 1.28Mcps TDD frame structure (called
'guaranteed FCCH detection'), assuming that monitoring happens every sub-
frame, can be calculated as follows (t~FCCH~ = one GSM slot):
$t_{\text{min}\text{,\ guaranteed}}\ = \ 2 \times \ t_{\text{synth}}\ + \
t_{\text{FCCH}}\ + \ \frac{5\text{ms}}{\text{13}}\ = \ 2 \times \
t_{\text{synth}}\ + \ \frac{\text{25}\text{ms}}{\text{26}}$
\- (e.g for t~synth~ =0ms: 2 1.28Mcps TDD **consecutive** idle timeslots
needed, for t~synth~ =0.3ms: 3 slots (or 2 slots and the DwPTS+GP+UpPTS), for
t~synth~ =0.5ms: 3 slots, for t~synth~ =0.8ms: 4 slots). Under this conditions
the FCCH detection time can never exceed the time of 660ms.
\- (For a more general consideration t~synth~ may be considered as a sum of
all delays before starting monitoring is possible).
\- For detecting SCH instead of FCCH (for a parallel search) the same equation
applies.
\- In the equation before the dual synthesiser UE is included if the
synthesiser switching time is 0ms.

The result in the above table is based on the following assumption:
\- A single synthesizer is used.
\- A [0.5] ms period is supposed to be required to perform a frequency jump
from 1.28Mcps TDD to GSM and vice versa.
\- For a given number of occupied slots in the TDD mode all possible cases of
distributions of these occupied TDD slots are considered (see 'cases'). For
every case arbitrary alignments of the TDD and the GSM frame structure are
taken into account for calculating the average FCCH detection time (only these
cases are used which guarantee FCCH detection for all alignments; only the
non-parallel FCCH search is reflected by the detection times in the above
table).
The term 'occupied slots' means that the UE is not able to monitor in these
TDD slots.
For a synthesiser switching time of one or one half TDD timeslot the number of
needed consecutive idle TDD timeslots is summarized in the table below:
