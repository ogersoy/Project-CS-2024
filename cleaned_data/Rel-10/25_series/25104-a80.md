# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following definitions apply:
**Output power:** The mean power of one carrier of the base station, delivered
to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the
transmitter.
**Rated output power:** Rated output power of the base station is the mean
power level per carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be available at
the antenna connector.
**Maximum output Power:** The mean power level per carrier of the base station
measured at the antenna connector in a specified reference condition.
**Mean power:** When applied to a W-CDMA modulated signal this is the power
(transmitted or received) in a bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip
rate of the radio access mode. The period of measurement shall be at least one
timeslot unless otherwise stated.
**Power control dynamic range:** The difference between the maximum and the
minimum transmit output power of a code channel for a specified reference
condition.
**RRC filtered mean power:** The mean power as measured through a root raised
cosine filter with roll-off factor α and a bandwidth equal to the chip rate of
the radio access mode.
NOTE 1: The RRC filtered mean power of a perfectly modulated W-CDMA signal is
0.246 dB lower than the mean power of the same signal.
**Code domain power:** That part of the mean power which correlates with a
particular (OVSF) code channel. The sum of all powers in the code domain
equals the mean power in a bandwidth of (1+ α) times the chip rate of the
radio access mode.
**Total power dynamic range:** The difference between the maximum and the
minimum total transmit output power for a specified reference condition.
NOTE 2: The roll-off factor α is defined in section 6.8.1.
**Secondary serving HS-DSCH cell(s)** : In addition to the serving HS-DSCH
cell, the set of cells where the UE is configured to simultaneously monitor an
HS-SCCH set and receive the HS-DSCH if it is scheduled in that cell. There can
be up to 3 secondary serving HS-DSCH cells.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship between Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification 25.141 section 4 defines Test
Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test.
The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in this
specification to create Test Requirements.
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 section 6.5.
## 4.2 Base station classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations, Local Area Base Stations and Home Base Stations
unless otherwise stated.
Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 70 dB. The Wide
Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the base station for
General Purpose application in Release 99, 4 and 5.
Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 53 dB.
Local Area Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell** scenarios with **a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 45 dB**.
Home Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Femto
Cell** scenarios.

## 5.4 Channel arrangement
### 5.4.1 Channel spacing
The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.4.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the centre
frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition a number of
additional centre frequencies are specified according to table 5.1A, which
means that the centre frequencies for these channels are shifted 100 kHz
relative to the general raster.
### 5.4.3 Channel number
The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (UARFCN). For each operating Band, the UARFCN values are
defined as follows:
Uplink: N~U~ = 5 * (F~UL~ - F~UL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~UL_low~ ≤ F~UL~ ≤ F~UL_high~
Downlink: N~D~ = 5 * (F~DL~ - F~DL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~DL_low~ ≤ F~DL~ ≤ F~DL_high~
For each operating Band, F~UL_Offset~, F~UL_low~, F~UL_high~, F~DL_Offset~,,
F~DL_low~ and F~DL_high~ are defined in Table 5.1 for the general UARFCN. For
the additional UARFCN, F~UL_Offset~, F~DL_Offset~ and the specific F~UL~ and
F~DL~ are defined in Table 5.1A.

# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for a
single transmitter antenna connector. In case of transmit diversity, DB-DC-
HSDPA or MIMO transmission, the requirements apply for each transmitter
antenna connector.
A BS supporting DC-HSDPA and DB-DC-HSDPA transmits two cells simultaneously. A
BS supporting DC-HSDPA transmits two cells simultaneously on adjacent carrier
frequencies.
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified at the
BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for
the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus
such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used,
requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (port B).
Figure 6.1: Transmitter test ports
## 6.2 Base station output power
Output power, Pout, of the base station is the mean power of one carrier
delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the
transmitter.
Rated output power, PRAT, of the base station is the mean power level per
carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be available at the antenna
connector.
### 6.2.1 Base station maximum output power
Maximum output power, Pmax, of the base station is the mean power level per
carrier measured at the antenna connector in specified reference condition.
The rated output power, PRAT, of the BS shall be as specified in Table 6.0A.
Table 6.0A: Base Station rated output power
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | BS class | PRAT | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Wide Area BS | - (note) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Medium Range BS | [\ Maximum code domain power: BS maximum output power - 3 dB or greater
>
> Minimum code domain power: BS maximum output power - 28 dB or less
### 6.4.3 Total power dynamic range
The total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum and the
minimum output power for a specified reference condition.
NOTE: The upper limit of the dynamic range is the BS maximum output power. The
lower limit of the dynamic range is the lowest minimum power from the BS when
no traffic channels are activated.
#### 6.4.3.1 Minimum requirement
The downlink (DL) total power dynamic range shall be 18 dB or greater.
### 6.4.4 Primary CPICH power
Primary CPICH (P-CPICH) power is the code domain power of the Primary Common
Pilot Channel. P-CPICH power is indicated on the BCH..
#### 6.4.4.1 Minimum requirement
The difference between the P-CPICH power transmitted at the antenna connector
and the P-CPICH power indicated on the BCH shall be within ±2.1 dB.
### 6.4.4A Secondary CPICH power
Secondary CPICH (S-CPICH) power is the code domain power of the Secondary
Common Pilot Channel. S-CPICH power is equal to the sum of the P-CPICH power
and the power offset, which are signalled to the UE. The power offset is
signalled in the IE "Power Offset for S-CPICH for MIMO", defined in section
10.3.6.41b in TS 25.331 [11].
#### 6.4.4A.1 Minimum Requirement
The difference between P-CPICH power transmitted at the first antenna
connector and the S-CPICH power transmitted at the second antenna connector
shall be within ±2 dB of the IE "Power Offset for S-CPICH for MIMO".
Note: The accuracy level of the power offset for S-CPICH may affect both MIMO
HS-DSCH demodulation and CQI reporting performance.
### 6.4.5 IPDL time mask
To support IPDL location method, the Node B shall interrupt all transmitted
signals in the downlink (i.e. common and dedicated channels).
The IPDL time mask specifies the limits of the BS output power during these
idle periods.
The requirement in this section shall apply to BS supporting IPDL.
#### 6.4.5.1 Minimum Requirement
The mean power measured over a period starting 27 chips after the beginning of
the IPDL period and ending 27 chips before the expiration of the IPDL period
shall be equal to or less than
BS maximum output power - 35 dB
see also Figure 6.1A.
Figure 6.1A: IPDL Time Mask
The requirement applies to all output powers within the total power dynamic
range as specified in subclause 6.4.3.
### 6.4.6 Home base station output power for adjacent channel protection
The Home BS shall be capable of adjusting the transmitter output power to
minimize the interference level on the adjacent channels licensed to other
operators in the same geographical area while optimize the Home BS coverage.
These requirements are only applicable to Home BS. The requirements in this
clause are applicable for AWGN radio propagation conditions.
The output power, Pout, of the Home BS shall be as specified in Table 6.3
under the following input conditions:
\- CPICH Êc, measured in dBm, is the code power of the Primary CPICH on one of
the adjacent channels present at the Home BS antenna connector for the CPICH
received on the adjacent channels. If Tx diversity is applied on the Primary
CPICH, CPICH Êc shall be the sum in [W] of the code powers of the Primary
CPICH transmitted from each antenna.
\- Ioh, measured in dBm, is the total received power density, including
signals and interference but excluding the own Home BS signal, present at the
Home BS antenna connector on the Home BS operating channel.
In case that both adjacent channels are licensed to other operators, the most
stringent requirement shall apply for Pout. In case the Home BS's operating
channel and both adjacent channels are licensed to the same operator, the
requirements of this clause do not apply.
The input conditions defined for the requirements in this section are
specified at the antenna connector of the Home BS. For Home BS receivers with
diversity, the requirements apply to each antenna connector separately, with
the other one(s) terminated or disabled .The requirements are otherwise
unchanged. For Home BS(s) without measurement capability, a reference antenna
with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for converting these power levels into field
strength requirements.
Table 6.3: Home BS output power for adjacent operator channel protection
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Input Conditions | Output power, Pout | Output power, Pout | | | | | | | (without transmit | (with transmit | | | diversity or MIMO) | diversity or MIMO) | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Ioh > CPICH Êc + 43 | ≤ 10 dBm | ≤ 7dBm | | dB | | | | | | | | And CPICH Êc ≥ | | | | -105dBm | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Ioh ≤ CPICH Êc + 43 | ≤ max(8 dBm, min(20 | ≤ max(5 dBm, min(17 | | dB | dBm, CPICH Êc + 100 | dBm, CPICH Êc + 97 | | | dB)) | dB)) | | and CPICH Êc ≥ | | | | -105dBm | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
NOTE 1: The Home BS transmitter output power specified in Table 6.3 assumes a
Home BS reference antenna gain of 0 dBi, an target outage zone of 47dB around
the Home BS for an UE on the adjacent channel, with an allowance of 2 dB for
measurement errors, an ACIR of 33 dB, an adjacent channel UE CPICH Ec/Io
target of -18 dB and the same CPICH Êc value at the adjacent channel UE as for
the Home BS.
Note 2: For CPICH Êc \ACK) (= false ACK detection when
DTX is transmitted) shall not exceed the required error ratio for the Ec/N0
specified in Table 8.16.

ratio for the E~c~/N~0~ specified in Table 8.17B. This requirement shall be
conditioned on that the ACK false alarm requirement in Section 8.10A.1.1 above
shall also be concurrently satisfied.
Table 8.17B: Performance requirements for ACK mis-detection per stream
conditioned on ACK false alarm per stream is less than 1%.

For scenario 2, Rician fading is considered where Rician factor, _K_ is
defined as the ratio between the dominant signal power and the variant of the
other weaker signals.

###### ## Annex C (normative): Characteristics of the W-CDMA interference
signal
The W-CDMA interference signal shall be a DPCH containing the DPCCH and one
DPDCH. The data content for each channelization code shall be uncorrelated
with each other and to the wanted signal and spread and modulated according to
clause 4 of TS25.213 [6]. Further characteristics of DPDCH and DPCCH are
specified in table C.1.

###### ## Annex D (normative): Regional requirement for protection of DTT
The European Communications Committee (ECC) has adopted the "ECC Decision on
harmonised conditions for Mobile/Fixed Communications Networks operating in
the band 790-862 MHz" [9] applicable for BS operating in band XX. The decision
defines a requirement for "Out-of-block BEM baseline requirements for
'mobile/fixed communications network' (MFCN) base stations within the spectrum
allocated to the broadcasting (DTT) service", where three different cases A,
B, and C for protecting broadcasting DTT are defined. These cases can be
applied on a per-channel and/or per-region basis, i.e. for the same channel
different cases can be applied in different geographic areas (e.g. area
related to DTT coverage) and different cases can be applied to different
channels in the same geographic area.
For band XX, compliance with the regulatory requirements in Europe referenced
above can be assessed based on the manufacturer's declaration of P~EM,N~
specified in subclause 6.6.2.1, together with the deployment characteristics.
Maximum output Power in 10 MHz (P~10MHz~) is also declared by the
manufacturer. The parameters G~ant~ and N~ant~ are deployment specific
parameters related to the deployment of the BS, where G~ant~ is the antenna
gain and N~ant~ is the number of antennas.
For each channel (N) the EIRP level is calculated using: P~EIRP,N~ = P~EM,N~ +
G~ant~ + 10*log(N~ant~ ). The regulatory requirement in [9] limits the EIRP
level to the Maximum level in Table D-1 for the protection case(s) defined in
the regulation.
