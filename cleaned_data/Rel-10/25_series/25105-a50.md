# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following definitions apply.
**Power Spectral Density:** The units of Power Spectral Density (PSD) are
extensively used in this document. PSD is a function of power versus frequency
and when integrated across a given bandwidth, the function represents the mean
power in such a bandwidth. When the mean power is normalised to (divided by)
the chip-rate it represents the mean energy per chip. Some signals are
directly defined in terms of energy per chip, (DPCH_Ec, Ec, and P-CCPCH_Ec)
and others defined in terms of PSD (Io, Ioc, Ior and Îor). There also exist
quantities that are a ratio of energy per chip to PSD (DPCH_Ec/Ior, Ec/Ior
etc.). This is the common practice of relating energy magnitudes in
communication systems.\ It can be seen that if both energy magnitudes in the
ratio are divided by time, the ratio is converted from an energy ratio to a
power ratio, which is more useful from a measurement point of view. It follows
that an energy per chip of X dBm/3.84 MHz (3.84 Mcps TDD option) or X dBm/1.28
MHz (1.28 Mcps TDD option) can be expressed as a mean power per chip of X dBm.
Similarly, a signal PSD of Y dBm/3.84 MHz (3.84 Mcps TDD option) or Y dBm/1.28
MHz (1.28 Mcps TDD option) can be expressed as a signal power of Y dBm.
**Mean power:** When applied to a CDMA modulated signal this is the power
(transmitted or received) in a bandwidth of at least (1+ α) times the chip
rate of the radio access mode. The period of measurement shall be a transmit
timeslot excluding the guard period unless otherwise stated.
NOTE: The roll-off factor α is defined in section 6.8.1.
**RRC filtered mean power:** The mean power as measured through a root raised
cosine filter with roll-off factor α and a bandwidth equal to the chip rate of
the radio access mode.
NOTE: The RRC filtered mean power of a perfectly modulated CDMA signal is
0.246 dB lower than the mean power of the same signal.
**Code domain power:** That part of the mean power which correlates with a
particular (OVSF) code channel. The sum of all powers in the code domain
equals the mean power in a bandwidth of (1+ α) times the chip rate of the
radio access mode.
**Output power:** The mean power of one carrier of the base station, delivered
to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the
transmitter.
**Maximum output power:** The mean power level per carrier of the base station
measured at the antenna connector in a specified reference condition. The
period of measurement shall be a transmit timeslot excluding the guard period.
**Rated output power:** Rated output power of the base station is the mean
power level per carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be available at
the antenna connector.
**Total power dynamic range:** The difference between the maximum and the
minimum output power of the base station for a specified reference condition.
**MBSFN-only operation:** Operation of a dedicated carrier solely for the
purposes of MBSFN transmission.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Relationship between Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification 25.142 section 5.9.6 defines
Test Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each
test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in this
specification to create Test Requirements. The measurement results returned by
the Test System are compared -without any modification- against the Test
Requirements as defined by the shared risk principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 section 6.5.
## 4.2 Base station classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations, Local
Area Base Stations and Home BS in co-ordinated network operation, unless
otherwise stated.
Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell and Micro Cell scenarios with BS to UE coupling losses equal to 70 dB and
53 dB. The Wide Area Base Station has the same requirements as the base
station for General Purpose application in Release 99 for 3.84 Mcps option,
and in Release 4 for both 3.84 Mcps and 1.28 Mcps option.
Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE coupling loss equals to 45 dB.
Home Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Femto Cell
scenarios.
## 4.3 Regional requirements

# 5 Frequency bands and channel arrangement
## 5.1 General
The information presented in this section is based on the chip rates of 3.84
Mcps, 1.28 Mcps and 7.68 Mcps TDD.
NOTE: Other chip rates may be considered in future releases.
## 5.2 Frequency bands
UTRA/TDD is designed to operate in the following bands;
a) 1900 - 1920 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission
2010 - 2025 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission
b) 1850 - 1910 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission
1930 - 1990 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission
c) 1910 - 1930 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission
d) 2570 - 2620 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission
e) 2300 - 2400 MHz Uplink and downlink transmission
f) 1880 - 1920 MHz: Uplink and downlink transmission
Note 1: Deployment in existing and other frequency bands is not precluded.
Note 2: In China, Band a only includes 2010 - 2025 MHz for 1.28 Mcps TDD
option.
The co-existence of TDD and FDD in the same bands is still under study in WG4.
## 5.3 TX-RX frequency separation
### 5.3.1 3,84 Mcps TDD Option
No TX-RX frequency separation is required as Time Division Duplex (TDD) is
employed. Each TDMA frame consists of 15 timeslots where each timeslot can be
allocated to either transmit or receive.
### 5.3.2 1,28 Mcps TDD Option
No TX-RX frequency separation is required as Time Division Duplex (TDD) is
employed. Each subframe consists of 7 main timeslots where all main timeslots
(at least the first one) before the single switching point are allocated DL
and all main timeslots (at least the last one) after the single switching
point are allocated UL.
### 5.3.3 7.68 Mcps TDD Option
No TX-RX frequency separation is required as Time Division Duplex (TDD) is
employed. Each TDMA frame consists of 15 timeslots where each timeslot can be
allocated to either transmit or receive.
## 5.4 Channel arrangement
### 5.4.1 Channel spacing
#### 5.4.1.1 3,84 Mcps TDD Option
The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
#### 5.4.1.2 1,28 Mcps TDD Option
The channel spacing is 1.6MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
#### 5.4.1.3 7.68 Mcps TDD Option
The nominal channel spacing is 10 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 5.4.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the carrier
frequency must be a multiple of 200 kHz.
#### 5.4.2.1 3.84 Mcps TDD Option
In addition a number of additional centre frequencies are specified according
to table 5.1, which means that the centre frequencies for these channels are
shifted 100 kHz relative to the general raster.
#### 5.4.2.2 7.68 Mcps TDD Option
In addition a number of additional centre frequencies are specified according
to table 5.1, which means that the centre frequencies for these channels are
shifted 100 kHz relative to the general raster.
### 5.4.3 Channel number
The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA absolute radio frequency
channel number (UARFCN). The value of the UARFCN in the IMT2000 band is
defined in the general case as follows:
N~t~ = 5 ∗ F 0.0 ≤ F ≤ 3276.6 MHz
where F is the carrier frequency in MHz.
Additional channels applicable to operation in the frequency band defined in
sub-clause 5.2(d) for 3.84 Mcps are defined via the following UARFCN
definition:
N~t~ = 5 * (F - 2150.1 MHz) 2572.5 MHz ≤ F≤ 2617.5 MHz
The 10 additional UARFCN for operations in frequency band defined in sub-
clause 5.2(d) for 3.84 Mcps are hence: 2112, 2137, 2162, 2187, 2212, 2237,
2262, 2287, 2312, 2337.
# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for a
single transmitter antenna connector. In case of MIMO transmission, the
requirements apply for each transmitter antenna connector.
Unless otherwise stated the transmitter characteristics are specified at the
antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus such
as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used,
requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (port B).

## 6.2 Base station output power
The rated output power of the base station is defined in section 3.1.
The rated output power, PRAT, of the Home BS shall be as specified in Table
6.0.0.

The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance are
two non-fading propagation channels in both scenarios.
Doppler shift for both scenarios is given by:
$f_{s}\left( t \right) = f_{d}\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right)$ (B.1)
where $f_{s}\left( t \right)$ is the Doppler shift and $f_{d}$ is the maximum
Doppler frequency. The cosine of angle $\theta\left( t \right)$is given by:
$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{D_{s}/2 -
\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( D_{s}/2 - \text{vt}
\right)^{2}}}$, $0 \leq t \leq D_{s}/v$ (B.2)
$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{- 1\text{.}5D_{s} +
\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( - 1\text{.}5D_{s} + \text{vt}
\right)^{2}}}$, $D_{s}/v  2D_{s}/v$ (B.4)
where $D_{s}/2$ is the initial distance of the train from BS, and
$D_{\text{min}}$ is BS-Railway track distance, both in meters; $v$ is the
velocity of the train in m/s, $t$ is time in seconds.
Doppler shift and cosine angle is given by equation B.1 and B.2-B.4
respectively, where the required input parameters listed in table B.4 and the
resulting Doppler shift shown in Figure B.1 and B.2 are applied for all
frequency bands.
