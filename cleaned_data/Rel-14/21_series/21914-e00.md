# Introduction
The present document provides a summary of the Release 14 Features and other
significant Work Items for which a summary has been agreed to be provided.
There is one clause per Feature. Each clauses begins with a table providing
references that can be used to get further information, as described in clause
4. This table is then followed by a summary of what the feature does and how
it does it.
The summaries are based inputs from the Rapporteur, provided as tdoc number to
the plenary. The tdoc number where the original version of the summary can be
found is provided in the first sentence of each clause.
# Scope
The present document provides a summary of each Feature or, whenever needed,
of each significant Work Item, introduced in Release 14.
The information provided in the present document is limited to an overview of
each feature, explaining, in about a page, its purpose and the main lines of
its behaviour.
The next step to retrieve more information on a given feature is to consult
the 3GPP Ultimate web site, as explained in Clause 4.
This document presents the \"initial state\" of the Features introduced in
Release 14, i.e. as they are by the time of publication of this document. It
is however important to note that each Feature is subject to be later modified
or enhanced, over several years, by the means of Change Requests (CRs)
associated to the Feature or to \"TEI\" (Technical Enhancements and
Improvements). It is therefore recommended to retrieve all the CRs which
relate to the given Feature, as explained in Clause 4, to further outline a
feature at a given time.

  1. Process to get further information ==================================
    1. Introduction \------------
Since the present document is limited to provide an overview of each Feature,
this chapter explains how to get additional information, in particular how to
retrieve all the Specifications (TSs) and Reports (TRs) as well as all the CRs
which relate to a given Work Item.
The Unique Identifier (UID) is the key to get additional information on a
given Work Item. It can be found in the table located just below the clause\'s
header. The table has the following format:
Table 4.1-1: table format
* * *
Unique Identifier (UID) Name Acronym Outline Level (1=Feature, 2=Building
Block, 3=Work Task) Responsible Working Group Work Item Description
* * *
For readability reasons, the table headers are omitted in the continuation of
the present document.
For instance, for the \"Mission Critical Push to Talk over LTE Realignment\",
the table has to be understood as:
Table 4.1-2: Example of table at the introduction of each Feature
* * *
Unique Identifier (UID) Name Acronym Outline Level Responsible Working Group
Work Item Description 700029 **Mission Critical Push to Talk over LTE
Realignment** MCImp-MCPTTR 2 S1 SP-150821
* * *
Thus, the UID for this Work Item is 700029.
Two methods are now possible to retrieve more information on a given feature:
the \"Step by step method\" and the \"Direct method\". The \"direct method\"
is faster but implies to know the hierarchical structure of the Work Items.
The \"step by step method\" is slower but is easier to use, in particular when
the hierarchical structure is unknown.
For instance, for retrieving all the CRs that relate to \"Enhancements for
Mission Critical Push To Talk\", the search has to be done on UID 740022 but
also potentially on its children Work Items (UID 720056, 740023 and 740024).
Table 4.1-3: Example of a hierarchical structure and its consequences on the
search procedure
* * *
740022 **Enhancements for Mission Critical Push To Talk** MCImp-eMCPTT
SP-160490 720056 Stage 2 of Enhancements for Mission Critical Push To Talk
MCImp-eMCPTT S6 SP-160490 740023 Stage 3 of Enhancements for Mission Critical
Push To Talk MCImp-eMCPTT-CT CT CP-160824 740024 CT1 aspects of Enhancements
for Mission Critical Push To Talk MCImp-eMCPTT-CT C1 CP-160824
* * *
These two methods are described in the following clauses.
## Direct method
The links below lead to the pages containing respectively all the
Specifications and all the Change Requests (CRs) linked to a given Feature:
https://portal.3gpp.org/Specifications.aspx?q=1&WiUid=[UID]
https://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=[UID]
where \"[UID]\" has to be preplaced by the UID value.
Using the example provided in the table 4.1-3, the specification linked to
\"Stage 2 of Enhancements for Mission Critical Push To Talk\" can be found in:
https://portal.3gpp.org/Specifications.aspx?q=1&WiUid=720056
And all the related Change Requests are listed in:
https://portal.3gpp.org/ChangeRequests.aspx?q=1&workitem=720056
## Step by step method
This method is to be used when the hierarchical structure is not known or when
the \"direct method\" above does not show the expected results.
In this case, the 3GPP Ultimate web site has to be used:
https://portal.3gpp.org
As a preliminary step, it is essential that the \"Customized Selection\" is
set to \"All TSGs\" (otherwise, a filter would be applied).

Figure 4.3-2: Using the 3GU Portal to retrieve more information on a given
Feature
Then the search might be performed by either typing the Acronym (as shown by
the left red arrow on the figure above, using the example \"MCPTT\"), or by
the name or UID (right box) then by clicking on the \"Search\" button. Watch
the \"Granularity (Level)\" field, which is a filter to return only the Items
which level is specified here.
In the results, the icon depicting some binoculars has to be hit (lower right
red arrow on the figure above).
This will lead to the page shown in the figure below:

On this window, the \"Related\" tab has to be clicked, as pointed by the red
arrow in the figure above. This will lead to the window depicted in the figure
below.

The continuation of the present document provides an exhaustive view of all
the items specified in Release 14 by 3GPP.
  1. Mission Critical related items ==============================
    1. Mission Critical Improvements general aspects \---------------------------------------------
* * *
700027 **Mission Critical Improvements** MCImp
* * *
This is an \"umbrella\" Feature, which is a mere grouping of all its
constituent Building Blocks, described in the following clauses.
For readability purposes, the two following clauses on Re-organizing the MCPTT
Stage 1 and Stage 2 documents are presented here although they were actually
developed under the respective Work Items \"Mission Critical Push to Talk over
LTE Realignment\" (described in 6.2) and Common functional architecture to
support mission critical services (described in 6.6).
### 6.1.1 Re-organizing the MCPTT Stage 1 documents
In Release 13, there was a single Stage 1 Technical Specification related to
MCPTT, i.e. TS 22.179 (\"Mission Critical Push to Talk (MCPTT) over LTE; Stage
1\").
In Release 14, three new TSs were introduced to cover dedicated MCPTT topics:
TS 22.281 for MCPTT Video (MCVideo); TS 22.282 for MCPTT Data (MCData), and TS
22.280 (\"Mission Critical Services Common Requirements\").
The text in TS 22.179 Rel-13 was \"redistributed\", and some new text was
added, to 22.179 Rel-14 and to the newly created 22.280, 22.281 and 22.282 as
follows:
\- requirements specific to MCPTT Video were moved to TS 22.281.
\- requirements specific to MCPTT Data were moved to TS 22.282.
\- requirements specific to MCPTT \"basic service\" (i.e. Voice) remained to
the Rel-14 version of TS 22.179.
\- requirements common to different mission critical services were moved to TS
22.280.
Each requirement that was moved out of 22.179 Rel-13 was voided in the Rel-14
version of TS 22.179 (also known as \"the realignment version\"), with an
informative annex created at the end TS 22.179 Rel-14 documenting the location
of the originating TS 22.179 requirement in the other TSs.
### 6.1.2 Re-organizing the MCPTT Stage 2 documents
As seen in clause above, in Release 14, the stage 1 MCPTT documentation is
arranged to be: stage 1 requirements are specified for MCVideo in TS 22.281,
for MCData in TS 22.282, for MC common requirements in TS 22.280 and for some
enhancements to MCPTT in TS 22.179.
Similarly, for Stage 2, and as part of the work for the MCImp-MC_ARCH work
item, the following structure of Stage 2 documentation was adopted:
1) The common functional architecture to support mission critical services
including the common services for identity management, configuration
management, key management and group management are specified in TS 23.280;
2) The MCPTT service architecture is based on the common functional
architecture and is specified in TS 23.379;
3) The MCVideo service architecture is based on the common functional
architecture and is specified in TS 23.281; and
4) The MCData service architecture is based on the common functional
architecture and is specified in TS 23.282.
It can be noted that, contrarily to Stage 1, where a same TS number (i.e. TS
22.179) was reused between Rel-13 and Rel-14 to handle the basic -voice only-
MCPTT service, the Stage 2 documentation took a different approach: the MCPTT
functional architecture and information flows are covered in TS 23.179 for
Rel-13 and, from Release 14 onwards, a new Specification was created, namely
TS 23.379.
For MCPTT security aspects, a similar approach as for Stage 2 was decided:
Release 13 is covered in TS 33.179 while, in Release 14, a new specification
is created in TS 33.180.
### 6.1.3 MCPTT documents structure
With this restructuring of documentation, the Release 14 TS and TR specific to
Mission Critical Improvements are:

**Overview of TS 22.179 on MCPTT Services**
The main classification of MCPTT Services refers to their accessibility: they
are classified as being accessible when \"on-network\" (i.e. they require the
UE to be attached to the PLMN), when \"off-network\", or both.
Some MCPTT Service capabilities which are common to \"on-network\" and \"off-
network\" are:
\- Receiving from multiple MCPTT calls, MCPTT Private Call (with floor
control) general, commencement, termination and administration capabilities,
MCPTT Priority Service including MCPTT Emergency Private Call (with floor
control), Location, Interaction between MCPTT Groups calls and MCPTT Private
Calls (with Floor control).
Some MCPTT Service capabilities which are only \"on-network\" are:
\- MCPTT Call commencement modes for MCPTT Group calls, Floor control
including requesting permission to transmit, override, terminating permission
to transmit, transmit time limit, audio cut-in for designated MCPTT Groups,
Call Termination, General Group Call Administration,
\- Dynamic Group management (i.e., dynamic regrouping) for group and user
regrouping, Private Call with or without floor control general capabilities,
Private Call with and without floor control commencement, Private Call without
floor control termination, Private Call back request, MCPTT Service Priority
including general, application layer priorities and call types based on
priorities (MCPTT Emergency Private Call (with floor control)), Interactions
for MCX Service Group and Private Communications, Audio MCPTT Call Performance
(including MCPTT access time and mouth to ear latency, Late call entry
performance, audio /voice quality), Ambient Listening.
\- Interaction with telephony services, Interworking with non-LTE PTT systems
(including P25, Tetra, and Legacy land mobile radio).
Some MCPTT Service capabilities which are only \"off-network\" are:
\- Floor control (including general aspects, requesting permission to

**Introduction**
Clause 6.1 above explains the relationship in Rel-14 between TS 22.179
(MCPTT), TS 22.280 (MCCoRe), TS 22.281 (MCVideo) and TS 22.282 (MCData).
This clause deals more specifically with TS 22.281, which provides the MCPTT
requirements applicable to MC Video, and the corresponding Stage 2 in 23.281.
The MCImp-MCVideo work item specifies the MCVideo service communications to
support on-network and off-network operations. It defines the identities,
procedures, information flows and related configurations corresponding to UE,
user profile, group and service.
It specifies video media communication between several users (i.e. group call
or private call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the
permission to stream video in an arbitrated manner for on-network and off-
network operations.
The Stage 2 (Architecture) for MCVideo is organized as the Stage 1, i.e.:
\- TS 23.280 specifies the common functional architecture aspects service
including the common services core and the generic mechanisms like UE-to-
network relay, affiliation and emergency alerts. These common aspects applies
to MCVideo; and
\- TS 23.281, specifically dedicated to MCVideo. It specifies the MCVideo
service functional architecture, procedures, information flows and related
configuration information .
**Overview of TS 22.281 on MCPTT Video**
The MCVideo service capabilities specified for on-network operations are:
\- MCVideo group affiliation, MCVideo group de-affiliation and remote change
of affiliation to MCVideo groups.
\- Group call setup, group call release, late entry to group call and re-
joining a group call enabled for pre-arranged groups. Group call setup up,
group call release, joining a group call and re-joining a group call enabled
for chat groups. Exiting a group call due to de-affiliation is applicable for
pre-arranged and chat group calls.
\- Emergency group call commencement, emergency group call cancel and upgrade
of a group call to emergency group call.
\- Imminent peril group call commencement, imminent peril group call cancel
and upgrade of a group call to imminent peril group call.
\- Emergency alert initiation and emergency state cancel (applicable for group
calls)
\- Private call setup in automatic and manual commencement mode.
\- Transmission initiation and control, remotely initiated transmission,
transmission revoke, transmission cancel, transmission queued, user or server
initiated transmission cancel from queue and user or remote authorized user or
server initiated transmission end.
\- Reception initiation and control, user or server initiated reception and
mandatory or negotiated reception override.
\- Configurations for MCVideo service pertaining to UE, user profile, service
and group.
\- User authentication (see TS 24.482) and MCVideo service authorization.
The MCVideo service capabilities specified for off-network operations are:
\- Group communication setup, active join to group communication, passive join
to group communication and group communication release due to inactivity.
\- Emergency group communication commencement, emergency group communication
cancel and upgrade of a group communication to emergency group communication.
\- Imminent peril group communication commencement, imminent peril group
communication cancel and upgrade of a group communication to imminent peril
group communication.
\- Emergency alert initiation and emergency state cancel (applicable for group
calls).
\- Private call setup in automatic and manual commencement mode.
\- Granting a transmission, rejecting a transmission, releasing a
transmission, overriding a transmission due to limit of maximum simultaneous
transmissions reached and handling simultaneous transmissions.
\- Transmission control in single arbitration or self-arbitration modes,
overriding a transmission of a single arbitrator and assignment of a new
transmission arbitrator, releasing a transmission arbitrator and delegating a
new transmission arbitrator when releasing.
\- Configurations for MCVideo service pertaining to UE, user profile, service
and group. (see TS 24.481, TS 24.483 and TS 24.484)
The MCVideo service communications uses H.264 (AVC) codec as specified in TS
26.281. Based on operator or MCVideo service provider policy, the MCVideo
service may optionally and additionally support the H.265 (HEVC) codec as
specified in TS 26.281. If MCVideo service supports combined or separate
handling of video and audio streams, then MCPTT audio codecs may be supported
as specified in TS 26.179. The media transport protocols supported for MCVideo
service are RTP and SRTP as specified in TS 26.281.

**Introduction**
Clause 6.1 above explains the relationship in Rel-14 between TS 22.179
(MCPTT), TS 22.280 (MCCoRe), TS 22.281 (MCVideo) and TS 22.282 (MCData).
This clause deals more specifically with TS 22.282, which provides the MCPTT
requirements applicable to MC Data, and the corresponding Stage 2 in 23.282.
With the progress of Mission Critical Push To Talk (MCPTT) it was identified
that there remained a need for other Mission Critical Services which could
also make use of the security, identity obfuscation and quality of service
handling which serve as the basis for MCPTT. Mission Critical Data (MCData) is
the Work Item addressing handling of data services within that Mission
Critical framework.
**Overview of TS 22.282 on MCPTT Data**
MCData in Release 14 is defined to include a short message service and a file
transfer service with conversation management and disposition reporting. There
is also an enhanced status reporting capability. Other data services initially
envisaged at stage 1 have been postponed to Release 15.
The Short message Distribution Service (SDS) can deliver messages over the
signalling channel or over a media bearer. SDS over media bearer can be
standalone where the media bearer is set up for the purpose of delivering one
message only and then disconnected afterwards or the media bearer can be
established as a session for a group to carry multiple messages among group
members. As a short message service, there is no pre-check for permission to
transmit. The protocol used will handle any size of message so no segmentation
or concatenation is required, but a configurable size limit is introduced to
protect against unlimited and uncontrolled permission to transmit.
The File Distribution service (FD) can be:
\- session based when all recipients are required to make mandatory download;
or
\- http upload and temporary store in the controlling MCData server followed
by distribution of notification of the file availability for the target
recipients. This way distribution control is managed and the recipient clients
can manage their own reception. There is also provision for mandatory download
with the http method.
Mandatory download is indicated from the sending user to the receiving
user(s).
SDS and FD can utilize a combined conversation management capability for
conversation tracking and grouping.
SDS and FD also both use a disposition mechanism to indicate the status of
delivery of the content.

720055 **Common functional architecture to support mission critical services**
MCImp-MC_ARCH 2 S6 SP-160489
* * *
See clause 6.1 above on re-organizing the MCPTT documents.
The main objective of the MCImp-MC_ARCH work item is to specify a common
functional architecture for all mission critical services to support on-
network and off-network operations. This common functional architecture
includes the common services core functions and certain generic mechanisms
(e.g. affiliation) for MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData services to be uniformly
developed. This work item enables the re-use of the common services by other
mission critical services not limited only to MCPTT.
The common functional architecture to support mission critical services can be
used for public safety applications and also for general commercial
applications e.g. utility companies and railways.
The MCImp-MC_ARCH work item is applicable for two or more mission critical
services and consists of architectural requirements, common functional models
for on network and off network, identities, deployment models, procedures and
information flows and configurations corresponding to UE, user profile, group
and service.
The common functional architecture to support MC services utilizes aspects of
the IMS architecture defined in TS 23.228, the Proximity-based Services
(ProSe) architecture defined in TS 23.303, the Group Communication System
Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in TS 23.468 and the PS-PS
access transfer procedures defined in TS 23.237.
The MC service UE primarily obtains access to a MC service via E-UTRAN, using
the EPS architecture defined in TS 23.401.
Certain MC service functions such as dispatch and administrative functions can
be supported using either MC service UEs in E-UTRAN or using MC service UEs
via non-3GPP access networks. These aspects are fully compliant with the MCPTT
architecture specified for Release 13 in TS 23.179.
The common functional architecture provides for common functionalities (common
services core) to support MC services (MCPTT service, MCVideo service and
MCData service). The key functionalities supported by common services core
are:
  1. Enhancements to Group management for supporting multiple MC services including group creation, group re-grouping (temporary groups), group information query and group information management to support on-network operations. (see TS 24.481)
  2. Enhancements to general user authentication to support authorization for multiple MC services (see TS 24.482).
  3. Enhancements to MC service configurations for supporting multiple MC services to support the provisioning of UE, user profile, service and group information. (see TS 24.484 and for MO definitions, see TS 24.483)
The generic mechanisms specified are applicable to at least two or more MC
services. The generic mechanisms are documented in TS 23.280 for purpose of
reducing duplication of procedures for each MC service. The following generic
mechanisms are specified:
\- Use of UE-to-network relay service to allow ProSe UE to UE communications
to support off-network operations for MCPTT service, MCVideo service and
MCData service. Support for restricting the relayed group communication on a
per group basis. (Implemented only for MCPTT service in Release 14)
\- Affiliation to groups, affiliation to groups defined in partner MC system,
de-affiliation from groups, de-affiliation from groups defined in partner MC
system and remote change of a MC service user\'s affiliation to groups defined
primary or partner MC systems by authorized users. The groups may be enabled
for any combination of MCPTT service, MCVideo service and MCData service
communications.
\- On-network and off-network emergency alert initiation and emergency state
cancel for MCVideo service and MCData service communications.

The V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) Feature encompasses all aspects of the 3GPP
work needed to support vehicle-based communications: enhancements of the air
interface, protocols, and impacts on the LTE core network.
There are two modes of operation for V2X communication, as shown in Figure
7.1-1:
a) V2X communication over PC5 interface: PC5 interface directly connects UEs
(User Equipments) so that over-the-air V2X message from a UE is directly
received by UEs around the transmitter.
b) V2X communication over LTE-Uu interface: LTE-Uu interface connects UEs with
eNB (E-UTRAN NodeB) which plays the role of base station in the LTE networks.
{width="6.6875in" height="3.8270833333333334in"}
Figure 7.1-1: V2X communication over PC5 interface and LTE-Uu interface
These two communication interfaces may be used by a UE independently for
transmission and reception.
V2X communication over PC5 is supported using sidelink when the UE is inside
LTE network coverage, i.e. \"served by E-UTRAN\" and when the UE is out of
network coverage, i.e. \"not served by E-UTRAN\".
For V2X communication over LTE-Uu, which is supported only when the UE is
inside network coverage, a UE may receive V2X messages via downlink unicast or
broadcast while transmitting V2X messages via uplink.
**Service requirements, architecture enhancements and security aspects**
\- Service requirements
The Work Item on \"Stage 1 for LTE support for V2X services (V2XLTE)\", driven
by SA WG1, defines the following major service requirements for typical V2X
application in TS 22.185 [1]:
\- Message transfer latency no longer than 100 ms with 20 ms maximum allowed
latency in some specific use cases
\- Transfer of message size up to 1200 bytes
\- Support of up to 10 message transfer per second in typical cases while
enabling maximum message transfer frequency of 50 Hz
\- Communication range sufficient to give driver enough response time (e.g. 4
seconds)
\- Support of relative vehicle speed up to 500 km/h
\- Support of V2X communication both in and out of network coverage
These service requirements are based on use cases identified during the study
phase in SA WG1 and the use cases consider the previous works done by many
other SDOs in the fields of automotive.
\- Architecture enhancements
The Work Item on \"Architecture enhancements for LTE support of V2X services
(V2XARC)\", driven by SA WG2, specifies the V2X architectures, functional
entities involved for V2X communication, interfaces, provisioned parameters
and procedures in TS 23.285 [2].
Figure 7.1-2 depicts an overall architecture for V2X communication. The \"V2X
Control Function\", which communicates with UEs via the V3 interface (not
shown on the figure), is the logical function defined for network related
actions required for V2X and performs authorization and provisioning of
necessary parameters for V2X communication to the UE.
{width="6.091666666666667in" height="4.877777777777778in"}
Figure 7.1-2: Overall architecture for V2X communication
When the UE is \"served by E-UTRAN\", it can send V2X messages over PC5
interface by using network scheduled operation mode (i.e. centralized
scheduling) and UE autonomous resources selection mode (i.e. distributed
scheduling). When the UE is \"not served by E-UTRAN\", it can send V2X
messages over PC5 interface only by using UE autonomous resources selection
mode.
For V2X messages over PC5, both IP based and non-IP based are supported. For
IP based V2X messages over PC5, only IPv6 is used. PPPP (ProSe Per-Packet
Priority) reflecting priority and latency for V2X message is applied to
schedule the transmission of V2X message over PC5.
A UE can send V2X messages over LTE-Uu interface destined to a locally
relevant V2X Application Server, and the V2X Application Server delivers the
V2X messages to the UE(s) in a target area using unicast delivery and/or MBMS
(Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service) delivery.
For V2X communication over LTE-Uu, both IP based and non-IP based V2X messages
are supported. In order to transmit non-IP based V2X messages over LTE-Uu, the
UE encapsulates the V2X messages in IP packets.
For latency improvements for MBMS, localized MBMS can be considered for
localized routing of V2X messages destined to UEs.
For V2X communication over LTE-Uu interface, the V2X messages can be delivered
via Non-GBR bearer (i.e. an IP transmission path with no reserved bitrate
resources) as well as GBR bearer (i.e. an IP transmission path with reserved
(guaranteed) bitrate resources). In order to meet the latency requirement for
V2X message delivery, the following standardized QCI (QoS Class Identifier)
values defined in TS 23.203 [3] can be used:
\- QCI 3 (GBR bearer) and QCI 79 (Non-GBR bearer) can be used for the unicast
delivery of V2X messages.
\- QCI 75 (GBR bearer) is only used for the delivery of V2X messages over MBMS
bearers.
\- Security aspects
The Work Item on \"Security aspect of LTE support of V2X services (V2XLTE-
Sec)\", driven by SA WG3, specifies the security aspects for LTE based V2X
communication in TS 33.185 [4], including security architecture, security
requirements, as well as procedures and solutions to meet those requirements.
Overall, security mechanisms from TS 33.303 [5] and TS 33.401 [6], initially
designed for ProSe (Proximity-based Services) and LTE respectively are
applicable to security support of V2X services, since V2X architecture is
based on those architectures. The V3 interface between the UE and the V2X
Control Function can be secured in the same way as the PC3 interface between
the UE and the ProSe Function, as in TS 33.303 [5]; PSK TLS with GBA (Pre-
shared Key Transport Layer Security with Generic Bootstrapping Architecture)
is used for UE initiated messages, while PSK TLS including option of GBA push
are used for network initiated messages.
For V2X application data, the security requirements are all satisfied by
employing application-layer security as defined in other SDOs (e.g. IEEE or
ETSI ITS), which is outside the scope of 3GPP. The field related to group keys
are all set to zero for PC5 based V2X communications, and the LTE security
mechanism for air interface confidentiality (see TS 33.401 [6]) is used for
LTE-Uu based V2X communications.
No additional privacy features beyond the regular LTE privacy features are
supported for LTE-Uu based V2X communications, while the privacy requirements
will likely depend on regional regulatory requirements and/or operator policy.
For the privacy of PC5 transmissions, the UE changes and randomizes the source
Layer-2 ID, and the source IP address periodically or when indicated by the
V2X application that the application layer identifier has changed.
**Core network and UE protocol aspects**
The Work Item \"CT aspects of V2X Services (V2X-CT)\", driven by the CT WGs,
defines the core network and UE protocol aspects, as summarized below.
\- CT WG1
CT1 specified the following protocols in TS 24.386 [7]:
\- for V2X authorization between the UE and the V2X Control Function over the
V3 interface;
\- for V2X communication among the UEs over the PC5 interface; and
\- for V2X communication between the UE and the V2X Application Server over
the LTE-Uu interface.
The V2X communication is configured by the V2X configuration parameters. The
V2X configuration parameters are categorized into \"V2X provisioning\", \"V2X
communication over PC5\" and \"V2X communication over LTE-Uu\". The \"V2X
provisioning\" is used for V2X Control Function discovery. The V2X
configuration parameters can be 1) pre-stored in the ME (Mobile Equipment), 2)
stored in the USIM (User Services Identity Module) or 3) provided by the V2X
Control Function to the ME over the V3 interface. The UE uses the V2X
configuration parameters in the order of increasing precedence. Further
details for the configuration parameters can be found in TS 24.385 [8].
For V2X communication over PC5, the V2X message includes data PDU, a Layer-3
protocol data type (i.e. IP or non-IP), the source Layer-2 ID, the destination
Layer-2 ID, and for non-IP V2X message the non-IP type field. The source
Layer-2 ID is self-assigned by the UE. The destination Layer-ID is set to one
of Layer-2 ID mapping with the V2X service identifier of the V2X service and
the default destination Layer-2 ID based on configuration. The non-IP type
field is set to corresponding V2X message family (i.e. IEEE 1609, ISO or ETSI-
ITS).
For V2X communication over LTE-Uu, the V2X Application Server address can be
determined by V2X Application Server discovery procedure using configured V2X
Application Server information or using MBMS procedure. For transport of non-
IP based V2X messages and IP based V2X message except for using TCP transport,
the UE generates UDP/IP packets for V2X message and send it over UDP/IP to the
determined V2X Application Server address.
\- CT WG3
CT3 specified protocols for the localized MBMS data delivery. The V2X
Application Server has pre-configured local MBMS information which consists of
MBMS information (e.g., IP Multicast Address) and user-plane information for
the localized routing (e.g., MBMS-GW IP Address, and BM-SC IP Address and port
number). The local MBMS information is delivered from the V2X Application
Server to BM-SC via MB2 interface or xMB interface and MBMS-GW via SGmb
interface when activating MBMS bearers. The V2X Application Server can deliver
V2X message to the UE via the MBMS bearer activated by the local MBMS
information. Further details for the local MBMS information and protocols
between the V2X Application Server and BM-SC can be found in TS 29.468 [9] for
MB2 interface and TS 29.116 [10] for xMB interface. Further details for
protocols between BM-SC and MBMS-GW can be found in TS 29.061 [11]. Localized
MBMS deployment options can be found in TS 23.285 [2].
\- CT WG4
CT4 specified the protocols for V2X authorization between the V2X Control
Function and the HSS (Home Subscriber Server) over the V4 interface and
between the V2X Control Functions over the V6 interface. The V2X Control
Function can request service authorization information for the UE in V2X
subscription data to HSS. When receiving the request, HSS can provide the list
of the PLMNs (Public Land Mobile Networks) where the UE is authorized to
perform V2X communication over PC5 interface. Diameter-based V4 interface
related procedures and information elements exchanged between the V2X Control
Function and the HSS are specified in TS 29.388 [12]. The V2X Control Function
in the HPLMN (Home PLMN) can request service authorization information for the
UE to the V2X Control Function in the VPLMN (Visited PLMN). When receiving the
request, the V2X Control Function in the VPLMN can provide indication for
whether the user is allowed to use V2X communication over PC5 in the VPLMN,
indication for whether the user is allowed to use V2X communication over MBMS
in the VPLMN and V2X Application Server information (e.g., FQDN or IP
address). Diameter-based V6 interface related procedures and information
elements exchanged between V2X Control Function can be found in TS 29.389
[13].
\- CT WG6
CT6 specified V2X configuration and operation related to USIM in TS 31.102
[14] where \'V2X\' is added in USIM Service Table for service management and
DF (Dedicated File) for V2X (DF~V2X~) is defined to contain management objects
for V2X specified in TS 24.385 [8].
**RAN aspects**
RAN groups specified the initial version of LTE sidelink enhancement, i.e.,
sidelink transmission modes 3 and 4, in the context of V2X under work item on
\"Support for V2V services based on LTE sidelink (LTE_SL_V2V)\". However, the
outcome as a result of the work item has the limitation that LTE-Uu interface
using uplink/downlink was not utilized and only V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle)
services were considered in a limited operation scenario (e.g., use of only a
single carrier in Band 47, only GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) as
synchronization source outside eNB coverage, etc.).
Work item on \"RAN aspects of LTE-based V2X Services (LTE_V2X)\" started to
further enhance LTE for better V2X services. This work specifies enhancements
required to enable V2X services with LTE uplink and downlink, to enable LTE
PC5 interface using sidelink to support additional V2X services such as V2P
(Vehicle-to-Pedestrian), and to support more operational scenarios for V2V
services using LTE sidelink. To be specific, RAN groups considered the
following as the main features:
\- Uplink and sidelink enhancement to enable eNB to quickly change SPS (Semi-
Persistent Scheduling) in adaptation to a change in the V2X message generation
pattern
\- Introduction of shorter scheduling periods in downlink and sidelink for
broadcasting V2X messages within latency requirements
\- Introduction of an additional resource allocation procedure in sidelink
mode 4 for power saving in pedestrian UEs
\- Introduction of sidelink congestion control for operation in high traffic
load
\- Enhancement to sidelink synchronization for operation outside GNSS or eNB
coverage
\- Support of simultaneous V2X operations over multiple carriers
As a result, the LTE radio standard supports the two LTE V2X communication
methods illustrated in Figure 1. A summary of the key functionalities made by
RAN WG1, RAN WG2, RAN WG3 and RAN WG4 is as below and last status report for
the work item on \"RAN aspects of LTE-based V2X Services (LTE_V2X)\" can be
found in RP-170236 [15].
\- Uplink and sidelink SPS enhancements
An eNB can configure multiple SPS configurations each of which may have
different parameters such as the resource period. The UE can report the
assistance information to the eNB to indicate the expected message generation
period, time offset, maximum message size, etc. The eNB can activate/release
each SPS configuration based on the reported information. The same principle
applies to uplink SPS for LTE-Uu based V2X and sidelink SPS for PC5 based V2X.
Figure 7.1-3 shows an example of using three SPS configurations with different
resource periods.
{width="6.692361111111111in" height="1.3930555555555555in"}
Figure 7.1-3: An example of using multiple SPS configurations in adaptation to
V2X message generation changes
\- Shorter message transmission periods in downlink and sidelink
As the downlink transmission method for V2X messages, the network can use
either per-cell multicast/broadcast transmission mechanism by SC-PTM (Single
Cell Point To Multi-point) or multicast/broadcast transmission over multiple
cells by MBSFN (Multicast/Broadcast Single Frequency Network). In order to
provide sufficiently low latency for V2X services, shorter control and data
periods are introduced for SC-PTM and MBSFN. Shorter message transmission
periods are also introduced for sidelink and the minimum period of 20 ms can
be supported.
\- Additional procedure in sidelink transmission mode 4 for pedestrian UEs
Sidelink transmission mode 4 in the existing specification is based on
continuous channel monitoring at each transmitter UE in order to reduce the
probability of packet collisions, i.e., two UEs transmit using the same
time/frequency resources. The RAN Work Item (WI) introduces an additional
procedure for the resource selection in sidelink transmission mode 4 in order
to reduce the power consumption of pedestrian UEs. Random resource selection
is supported such that a pedestrian UE not having the sidelink reception
capability can transmit its own V2X messages. Partial sensing is also
supported, and the pedestrian UE can monitor the channel only in a subset of
subframes as illustrated in Figure 4. Partial sensing can reduce the resource
collision probability compared to the random selection but requires more power
consumption. The eNB can control which resource selection procedure is used by
the pedestrian UEs.
{width="4.659027777777778in" height="1.4083333333333334in"}
Figure 7.1-4: Illustration of partial sensing
\- Sidelink congestion control
The UE measures the CBR (Channel Busy Ratio) which denotes the portion of
time/frequency resources in which strong signal is observed. Higher CBR will
be typically measured when more UEs transmit more V2X messages in a given
channel. Congestion control can adjust each UE\'s transmission parameters such
as transmit power and resource size based on the CBR measurement either in the
centralized manner or distributed manner. In centralized congestion control,
CBR measured at the UE is reported to the eNB, and the eNB can adjust the
resource configuration appropriately, for example, by commanding each UE to
lower the transmit power and resource size. In distributed congestion control,
the UE adjusts its own transmission parameters within the allowed range which
is a function of CBR measurement.
\- Enhancement to sidelink synchronization using sidelink signals/channels
Sidelink transmission modes 3 and 4 in the existing specification can use
either GNSS signal or the eNB signal as the synchronization reference, so no
sidelink operation is possible when a UE cannot receive either signal. The RAN
WI enhances this so that a UE operating PC5 based V2X can transmit and receive
SLSS (SideLink Synchronization Signal) which can be used as another type of
synchronization reference in sidelink communications. Two UEs using the same
SLSS as their synchronization reference can align their time and frequency
references before transmitting and receiving V2X messages even when no GNSS
signal or eNB signal is detected.
\- Support of simultaneous V2X operations over multiple carriers
The RAN WI extends the V2X operation scenarios by supporting simultaneous V2X
operations over multiple carriers. In one scenario, a UE can operate LTE-Uu
based V2X in a carrier while operating PC5 based V2X in another carrier. In
another scenario, a UE can operate PC5 based V2X simultaneously over two
carriers. Tables 7.1-1 and 7.1-2 list the combinations of V2X carriers
supported for V2X services. The RAN WI specifies a mechanism to determine the
transmission power of each carrier based on the priority level. Such
simultaneous V2X operations can be used to increase the maximum bandwidth of
the V2X services or to support inter-PLMN operations where multiple operators
provide V2X services over different carriers.

The V2V Work Item outlines the scope of the work and defines a number of
specific objectives on which RAN working groups have concentrated their
efforts.
This clause provides a high level description of the main aspects comprising
the V2V feature, as identified by the WI objectives.
V2V communications are based on D2D communications defined as part of ProSe
services in Rel-12 (RP-142043) and Rel-13 (RP-150441). As part of ProSe
services, a new D2D interface (designated as PC5, also known as sidelink at
the physical layer) was introduced and now as part of the V2V WI it has been
enhanced for vehicular use cases, specifically addressing high speed (up to
250Kph) and high density (thousands of nodes).
To that end, a few fundamental modifications to PC5 have been introduced.
Firstly additional DMRS symbols have been added to handle the high Doppler
associated with relative speeds of up to 500kph and at high frequency (5.9GHz
ITS band being the main target). This results in the sub-frame structure
illustrated in Figure 7.2-1.
As illustrated the V2V sub-frame for PC5 interface has 4 DMRS symbols, in
addition to the Tx-Rx turnaround symbol at the end, allowing for better
tracking of the channel at high speed.

Figure 7.2-1: a V2V sub-frame for PC5 interface
Secondly a new arrangement of scheduling assignment and data resources has
been agreed. The arrangement is illustrated in Figure 7.2-2 and is designed to
enhance the system level performance under high density while meeting the
latency requirements of V2V. Scheduling assignments (SA or PSCCH) are
transmitted in sub-channels using specific RBs across time. Data transmissions
associated with said scheduling assignments are occupying adjacent RBs in the
same subframe. Note that another variant where SA and associated data
transmissions are not necessarily transmitted on adjacent RBs has also been
standardized.
{width="3.497916666666667in" height="2.425in"}
Figure 7.2-2: new arrangement of scheduling assignment and data resources
Finally for distributed scheduling (a.k.a. Mode 4) a sensing with semi-
persistent transmission based mechanism was introduced. V2V traffic from a
device is mostly periodic in nature. This was utilized to sense congestion on
a resource and estimate future congestion on that resource. Based on
estimation resources were booked. This technique optimizes the use of the
channel by enhancing resource separation between transmitters that are using
overlapping resources.
The design is scalable for different bandwidths including 10 MHz bandwidth.
Based on these fundamental link and system level changes there are two high
level deployment configurations currently defined, and illustrated in Figure
7.2-3.
Both configurations use a dedicated carrier for V2V communications, meaning
the target band is only used for PC5 based V2V communications. Also in both
cases GNSS is used for time synchronization.
{width="6.680555555555555in" height="3.5104166666666665in"}
Figure 7.2-3: the two high level deployment configurations
In \"Configuration 1\" scheduling and interference management of V2V traffic
is supported based on distributed algorithms (Mode 4) implemented between the
vehicles. As mentioned earlier the distributed algorithm is based on sensing
with semi-persistent transmission. Additionally, a new mechanism where
resource allocation is dependent on geographical information is introduced.
Such a mechanism counters near far effect arising due to in-band emissions.
In \"Configuration 2\" scheduling and interference management of V2V traffic
is assisted by eNBs (a.k.a. Mode 3) via control signaling over the Uu
interface. The eNodeB will assign the resources being used for V2V signaling
in a dynamic manner.
  1. Cellular Internet of Things (CIoT) related items ================================================
    1. System improvements for MTC \---------------------------
      1. ### Extended architecture support for Cellular Internet of Things
Summary based on the input provided by Intel in SP-170748.

* * *
An extended architecture to support Cellular Internet of Things was studied in
TR 23.730. In Rel-14, as part of normative work, the following enhancements
were specified.
\- Restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage
The support of UEs in Enhanced Coverage is specified in TS 36.300. The usage
of Enhanced Coverage may require use of extensive resources (e.g. radio and
signalling resources) from the network. This feature enables the operator to
prevent specific subscribers from using Enhanced Coverage. The Enhanced
Coverage Restricted parameter is introduced as part of the subscription data
in the HSS that specifies per PLMN whether the enhanced coverage functionality
is restricted or not for the UE. The MME receives Enhanced Coverage Restricted
parameter from the HSS. If the UE includes the support for restriction of use
of Enhanced Coverage, the MME sends the Enhanced Coverage Restricted parameter
to the UE in the Attach/TAU Accept message. The UE uses the value of Enhanced
Coverage Restricted parameter to determine if the enhanced coverage feature is
restricted or not. The MME also provides an Enhanced Coverage Restricted
parameter to the eNB via S1 signalling whenever the UE context is established
in the RAN, e.g., during service request procedure, attach procedure, and TAU
procedure. The Restriction of use of the Enhanced Coverage is specified in TS
23.060 and TS 23.401. The support for Enhanced Coverage (i.e. CE Mode B) for
both \"data centric\" and \"voice centric\" UEs is specified in TS 23.401 and
TS 23.228.
The support for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via SCEF was also
specified which enables 3rd party service providers to query status of the
enhanced coverage restriction or enable/disable enhanced coverage restriction
per individual UEs. The Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via SCEF is
specified in TS 23.682.
Stage-3 aspects for restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage are specified in
TS 24.301, TS 23.008, TS 29.272, and TS 29.002.
\- Reliable Data Delivery
The Rel-13 solution for non-IP data delivery (NIDD) via the SCEF is
unreliable, i.e., there is no mechanism for the SCEF to determine if the data
was successfully delivered to the UE (e.g., in case of UE radio link failure,
or if the UE is out of coverage) and for the UE to determine if the data was
successfully delivered to the SCEF (e.g., in case of T6a/b connection failure,
SCEF congestion etc.). Rel-14 introduced enhancements for reliable delivery of
NIDD. Two complimentary mechanism were specified --
a) Reliable delivery by acknowledgements on a hop-by-hop basis, i.e. the link
layer protocol on each interface used for NIDD uses acknowledgments and nodes
apply retransmissions if needed to ensure reliable delivery;
b) Reliable Data Service (RDS) between UE and SCEF. The RDS provides a
mechanism for the SCEF to determine if the data was successfully delivered to
the UE and for the UE to determine if the data was successfully delivered to
the SCEF. When a requested acknowledgement is not received, the RDS
retransmits the packet. The RDS is enabled or disabled based on APN
Configuration per (Service Level Agreement) SLA. The RDS protocol is specified
in TS 24.250.
\- Inter RAT idle mode mobility to/from NB-IoT
Rel-13 does not support idle mode mobility to and from the NB-IoT RAT and if
the MME identifies an attempt for RAT change to or from NB-IoT (e.g., at
reception of a Context Request or Context Response message or at intra-MME
TAU), the MME requires the UE to reattach. Rel-14 introduced the support for
idle mode inter-RAT mobility to and from NB-IoT. To ensure a UE initiates
tracking area updating procedure when performing inter-RAT mobility between
NB-IoT and WB-E-UTRAN, the E-UTRAN has to be configured such that a Tracking
Area does not contain both WB-E-UTRAN and NB-IoT cells, and the MME shall not
allocate a Tracking Area Identity list that contains both NB-IoT and WB-E-
UTRAN Tracking Areas.
A new subscription parameter PDN-Connection-Continuity was added to indicate,
on per APN basis, how to handle the PDN connection when the UE moves between
\"broadband\" (WB-E-UTRAN, UTRAN) and \"narrowband\" (NB-IoT, GPRS, EC-GSM-
IoT). The serving node based on the PDN-Connection-Continuity subscription
parameter and on the operator policy determines whether to maintain the PDN
connection or disconnect the PDN connection with/without a reactivation
request. Stage-2 details are specified in TS 23.401 and TS 23.060.
Stage-3 details are specified in TS 29.272 and TS 29.274.
\- MBMS user service for UEs using power saving functions
MBMS Bearer Services (see TS 23.246) together with MBMS User Services (see TS
26.346) provide a means to deliver data or triggering payload over broadcast
to multiple UEs at the same time. One of the key requirements is how to
provide MBMS service to the UEs using power saving functions (e.g. Power
Saving Mode or eDRX). Details of MBMS user service for UEs using power saving
functions is specified in TS 23.401.
\- Enhancements to Location Services for CIoT
Location Services (LCS) are defined in TS 23.271. In order to support Location
Services for CIoT UEs, the following enhancements to Location Services are
defined:
\- Deferred Location for the UE availability event
\- Indication of UE RAT type and/or coverage level to Evolved Serving Mobile
Location Centre (E-SMLC)
\- Support of UE positioning measurements in idle mode
\- Addition of Periodic and Triggered Location for EPC
\- Support of Last Known Location for a UE that are unreachable for long
periods of times
Stage-2 details are specified in TS 23.682 and TS 23.271.
\- Inter UE QoS for NB-IoT UEs using Control Plane CIoT EPS optimization
To allow the E-UTRAN to prioritize resource allocation between different NB-
IoT UEs when some of the UEs are using the Control Plane CIoT EPS
optimization, the eNB may request, based on configuration, the MME to supply
the eNB with the negotiated QoS profile for any UE that is using the Control
Plane CIoT EPS optimization. The QoS profile sent to the eNB by the MME
consists of the E-RAB Level QoS Parameter in the E-RAB to be Setup List IE .
The eNB can use the QoS profile to assist with resource prioritization
decisions between different NB-IoT UEs (irrespective of whether the UE/eNB is
using the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimization, or, the User Plane CIoT EPS
optimization).
Stage-2 details are specified in TS 23.401. Stage-3 details are specified in
TS 36.413.
\- CN overload control for data transfer via Control Plane CIoT EPS
Optimization
Further enhancements to handle the CN overload from data transmission via
Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimization were specified. Under overload conditions
the MME may restrict requests from UEs for data transmission via Control Plane
CIoT EPS Optimization. A first option consists in a Control Plane data back-
off timer returned by the MME to the UE via NAS signalling. While the Control
Plane data back-off timer is running, the UE shall not initiate any data
transfer via Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimization. The MME has to store the
Control Plane data back-off timer per UE and has to reject any further request
(other than exception reporting) for data transmission via Control Plane
Service Request from that UE while the Control Plane data back-off timer is
still running. A second option is based on the MME requesting the eNB, using
OVERLOAD START message, not to accept RRC connection requests with RRC
establishment cause \"mo-data\" or \"delayTolerantAccess\" from UEs that only
support Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimization.
Stage-2 details are specified in TS 23.401. Stage-3 details are specified in
TS 24.301, TS 36.331 and TS 36.413.

See also \"Dedicated Core Networks for GERAN\" (DECOR_GERAN) under GERAN
This feature is an enhancement of Release 13\'s DECOR (Dedicated Core Networks
selection mechanism) Feature. Two functionalities are introduced:
\- \"UE-assisted DCN selection\", as to reduce the DECOR re-routing;
\- and in E-UTRAN, a mechanism is introduced to improve the load balancing
between MMEs when DCN is used.
This work item specifies the use of DCN-ID (Dedicated Core Network --
Identity) to assist the RAN (GERAN, UTRAN and E-UTRAN) in selecting the
correct DCN, as to reduce the use of DECOR re-routing. The DCN-ID is allocated
by the core network and sent to the UE in the Non-Access Stratum (NAS)
\"accept\" messages. The DCN-ID is stored in the UE per PLMN. The UE provides
the DCN-ID in the RRC message in Attach Request, Tracking Area Update Request
(TAU) or Routing Area Update Request (RAU) messages. If the RAN cannot find a
serving MME/SGSN related to GUTI, NRI, etc. provided by the UE, RAN uses the
DCN-ID to select correct MME/SGSN serving the requested DCN. The DCN-ID is
also sent to the selected MME/SGSN over S1AP.
In E-UTRAN, the MME sends for each DCN-ID (that it supports) a weight factor
in the S1 Setup and MME Configuration update procedure. The weight factor per
DCN represents the relative processing capacity of an MME node for a specific
DCN relative to other MME nodes\' capacity for that DCN within the same MME
pool area. The eNB can use this information to perform load balancing.
A number of specifications have been updated but no new spec has been created.

LTE Rel-13 introduced improved support for machine-type communications (MTC)
in the form of a low-complexity UE category, coverage enhancement modes and
extended discontinuous reception, and this work item broadens the range of use
cases that can be addressed by LTE MTC by providing higher data rate support,
multicast support, improved positioning, VoLTE enhancements and mobility
enhancements.
Higher data rate support
The low-complexity UE category introduced in LTE Rel-13 (Cat-M1) has a UE
bandwidth of 1.4 MHz and a peak rate of 1 Mbps in DL and UL. Coverage
enhancement (CE) modes A and B, which are applicable to both Cat-M UEs and
normal LTE UEs, are also restricted to 1.4 MHz in Rel-13. This work item
introduces the following data rate improvements in order to be able to address
a wider range of use cases.
**\- New UE category M2:** A new UE category (Cat-M2) is introduced with a UE
bandwidth of 5 MHz and peak rates of approximately 4 Mbps in DL and 7 Mbps in
UL. These peak rates apply for UEs supporting full-duplex FDD operation -- the
peak rates for UEs supporting half-duplex FDD are approximately half of these
numbers and the peak rates for UEs supporting TDD depend on the DL/UL subframe
configuration.
**\- Wider bandwidth in CE mode:** CE modes A and B are improved to support
maximum data channel bandwidths of 5 or 20 MHz in DL, and CE mode A is
improved to support a maximum data channel bandwidth of 5 MHz in UL. The
control signaling (MPDCCH, system information, etc.) is still restricted to
1.4 MHz in order to re-use as much as possible of the Rel-13 design.
**\- Higher UL peak rate for Cat-M1:** Support for a larger transport block
size (TBS) of 2984 bits instead of 1000 bits is introduced in order to
increase the UL peak rate for Cat-M1. Increasing the UL TBS is not expected to
increase the UE complexity significantly but will provide an UL peak rate
boost which may be particularly useful in DL-heavy TDD configurations.
**\- 10 DL HARQ processes in FDD:** In order to enable UEs that support full-
duplex FDD operation to do continuous DL data transmission, the number of DL
HARQ processes is increased from 8 to 10, increasing the DL peak rate with
25%. This will also benefit half-duplex FDD UEs configured with HARQ-ACK
bundling.
**\- HARQ-ACK bundling in HD-FDD:** In half-duplex FDD operation, the DL peak
rate is limited by the fact that the UE needs to switch to UL in order to
transmit HARQ-ACK feedback. This work item introduces HARQ-ACK bundling, where
the UE transmits a single HARQ-ACK feedback for multiple DL transport blocks,
thereby enabling the UE to incease the portion of subframes that can be used
for DL data transmission from 30% to 53% (or to 59% using 10 DL HARQ
processes).
**\- Faster frequency retuning:** Since the UE bandwidth of Cat-M UEs can be
smaller than the system bandwidth, a guard period of 2 OFDM symbols is applied
in CE mode to allow these UEs to do frequency retuning within the system
bandwidth. This work item introduces support for shorter guard periods of 1
symbol (for Cat-M) and 0 symbols (for normal LTE UEs in CE mode), allowing for
somewhat improved link performance.
These features can be supported by Cat-M2 and normal LTE UEs supporting CE
mode. All features except the wider bandwidth can also be supported by Cat-M1.
Multicast support
Multicast is introduced based on SC-PTM with modifications to suit the low
complexity of Cat-M UEs and enhanced coverage of UEs operating in CE mode.
Similar to LTE, SIB20 configures the transmission of the single SC-MCCH per
cell which in turn configures up to 128 SC-MTCHs. Each SC-MTCH can be
configured to support up to 1 Mbps over 1.4 MHz or 4 Mbps over 5 MHz, with or
without frequency hopping. The modification and repetition periods of SC-MCCH
are extended to account for the repetitions used for coverage extension on
MPDCCH and PDSCH. To keep UE complexity low, the UE is only required to
receive SC-PTM in RRC_IDLE mode, and it is not required to process SC-MCCH at
the same time as SC-MTCH, nor is it required to process any SC-PTM
transmission at the same time as paging or random access. Differently to LTE,
there is no SC-N-RNTI. Instead, notification of SC-MCCH change is indicated
directly in the downlink control information (DCI) which schedule SC-MCCH and
SC-MTCH to avoid the need to send change notification separated in time from
the scheduling DCIs.
Improved positioning
The necessary signaling for the LTE positioning methods E-CID and OTDOA is
supported already in Rel-13 for Cat-M1 and other UEs in CE mode but this work
item introduces full standard support by also including measurement
performance requirements. Also, additional OTDOA enhancements are introduced
in order to take into account the limited UE bandwidth of Cat-M UEs and the
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) operating point of UEs in CE mode. Each cell
and UE can be configured with up to three Positioning Reference Signals (PRS)
instead of just one, each PRS with its own configured transmission interval,
duration and bandwidth, with or without frequency hopping. The intervals can
now be as short as 10 ms (previously 160 ms) and the duration as long as 160
ms (previously 6 ms). Although these OTDOA enhancements have been designed
with Cat-M and other UEs in CE mode in mind, they can be supported by LTE UEs
that do not support CE mode.
VoLTE enhancements
Cat-M1 and other UEs in CE mode A support VoLTE already in Rel-13 but this
work item introduces optimizations to improve the coverage for VoLTE and other
delay sensitive services in particular in half-duplex FDD and TDD where the
number of available DL/UL subframes is limited.
**\- New PUSCH repetition factors:** Two new subframe repetition factors (12,
24) were included in the existing range (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) for the uplink
data channel (PUSCH) in order to allow more efficient use of available
subframes.
**\- Dynamic HARQ-ACK delays:** A field indicating a HARQ-ACK delay was
introduced in the downlink control information (DCI) to allow more flexible
scheduling of the HARQ-ACK feedback for DL data transmissions.
**\- SRS coverage enhancement:** Support for sounding reference signal (SRS)
repetition in the special subframe in TDD was introduced in order to enable
improved link adaptation.
These features are not limited to VoLTE but can be used with any service for
Cat-M or other UE in CE mode A. The SRS coverage enhancement can furthermore
be supported also by LTE UEs that do not support CE mode.
Mobility enhancements
Rel-13 has full standard support for intra-frequency measurements for Cat-M1
and other UEs in CE mode including signaling and measurement performance
requirements and has signaling support for inter-frequency measurements. This
work item introduces full standard support for inter-frequency measurements by
also including measurement performance requirements.

70.
The corresponding changes are applied to UE RF specification, BS RF
specification and RRM requirements.
This Work Item is generic to all bands, meaning that when a new band is
specified or when an operator wishes to operate NB-IoT in an existing band,
there is not need to specify a new WI for each band.

Whereas the Rel-13 NB-IoT specifications provide the fundamental air interface
for ultra-low complexity UEs which can be connected to a network in massive
numbers in extremely challenging coverage whilst having a long battery life,
this work item gives NB-IoT support for positioning, multicast, connected mode
mobility (without handover), higher data rates, load balancing for paging and
random access onto non-anchor carriers, and support for a UE power class of 14
dBm to permit use of small form-factor batteries with very low peak-current
delivery.
**A. Positioning**
LPP (Location and Positioning Protocol) signalling is introduced as the
positioning protocol for NB-IoT. The UE indicates its capability to perform
OTDOA-, A-GNSS-, E-CID, terrestrial beacon service-, sensor-, WLAN-, and
Bluetooth-based positioning. Of these, OTDOA and E-CID are specified in 3GPP.
The UE indicates in the capability signalling when it requires idle mode to
perform the measurements.
**OTDOA**
A new Narrowband Positioning Reference Signal (NPRS) is introduced, based on
LTE\'s PRS in one PRB. NPRS are configured to occur periodically in the time
domain. There can be a bitmap, 'Part A\', mapping to successive 10 or 40
subframes indicating which subframes may contain NPRS, and/or there can be a
configuration of a number of consecutive subframes, a period, and an offset
within the period of the starting subframe (collectively 'Part B\'). The NPRS
pattern in one subframe is shown in Figure 1, and depends on whether the NB-
IoT carrier containing the NPRS is deployed in-band to LTE, in an LTE guard-
band, or standalone. Hearability of the pattern is improved by offsetting the
pattern according to a UE-specific ID in the frequency domain, and by each
Part being independently mutable in a configurable pattern corresponding to
its periodicity, illustrated in Figure 2. The UE only needs to make RSTD
measurements in RRC_IDLE mode, and it is the eNB\'s responsibility to avoid
collisions between NPRS and other transmissions the UE may need to receive in
RRC_IDLE. Assistance information is provided for each non-serving NB-IoT
carrier configured for NPRS to tell the UE the offset in time between the
reference cell and the neighbour cell, and the subframes where SIB1-NB occurs
if the neighbour cell is an anchor carrier.

**E-CID**
Core requirements are defined for E-CID. The UE only needs to make NRSRP and
NRSRQ measurements in RRC_IDLE mode.
**B. Multicast**
Multicast is introduced based on SC-PTM, with simplifications to suit the low
complexity of an NB-IoT UE. Similar to LTE, SIB20-NB configures the
transmission of the single SC-MCCH per cell which in turn configures up to 64
SC-MTCHs. The transmissions can be on anchor or non-anchor NB-IoT carriers.
The modification and repetition periods of SC-MCCH are extended to account for
the repetitions used for coverage extension on NPDCCH and NPDSCH. To keep UE
complexity low, the NB-IoT UE is only required to receive SC-PTM in RRC_IDLE
mode, and it is not required to process SC-MCCH at the same time as SC-MTCH,
nor is it required to process any SC-PTM transmission at the same time as
paging or RAR. Differently to LTE, there is no SC-N-RNTI. Instead,
notification of SC-MCCH change is indicated directly in the DCIs which
schedule SC-MCCH and SC-MTCH to avoid the need to send change notification
separated in time from the scheduling DCIs.
**C. Non-anchor carrier operation**
There can be up to 15 DL and UL non-anchor carriers configured in a new NB-IoT
SIB, used by paging, RAR, or SC-PTM, each identified by its centre frequency.
For paging purposes, POs are distributed across the non-anchor carriers in a
configurable uneven manner so that the eNB can decide what paging load each
carrier should have. For random access, each non-anchor UL carrier has a
probability with which the UE may randomly select it for Msg1&3, and
corresponds to a DL carrier for Msg2&4; or for ordered random access the
carrier for Msg1&3 is indicated by DCI. Contention free random access is
supported for NPDCCH ordered random access.
On non-anchor carriers for receiving paging and RAR, the subframes which the
UE can assume contain NRS are reduced, to benefit network power consumption
and co-existence with LTE and NR in future. In addition to spanning a few
valid subframes either side of the NPDSCH carrying paging or RAR, the NRS are
reduced to start a few valid subframes before the paging NPDCCH search space
or RAR window, and continue until a few valid subframes after the NPDCCH
candidate that contains the paging DCI, or after the RAR window respectively.
**D. Mobility enhancements**
For the Control Plane CIoT EPS optimizations, RRC Connection Re-establishment
and S1 eNB CP Relocation Indication procedures are introduced, to allow
maintaining the S1 connection and retransmissions of the NAS PDUs by MME and
UE NAS in case of radio rink failure. Since AS security is not supported by
these UEs, a security token based on NAS security is included in the RRC
Connection Re-establishment Request and RRC Connection Re-establishment
messages to allow authentication of the UE by the MME and authentication of
the eNB by the UE. In case of successful UE authentication, the MME initiates
a newly introduced S1 UE Context Release procedure to release the UE\'s
S1-connection in the old eNB. The MME may initiate MME CP Relocation procedure
before the release procedure in order to trigger the old eNB to return non-
delivered NAS PDUs to the MME.
For User Plane CIoT EPS optimizations, the legacy handover procedure of with
data forwarding at handover is used at radio link failure.
**E. Power consumption and latency reduction**
To reduce the time and UE power required to transfer larger messages in more
favourable coverage, the range of transport block sizes (TBS) the NB-IoT UE
can support is increased from a maximum of 680 bits DL and 1000 bits UL to
2536 bits on both links. This establishes a Category NB2 UE. The Cat NB2 UE
may optionally have 2 HARQ processes for UL and DL (compared to 1 each in
Rel-13), allowing further peak rate increases, in which case the time spacing
between transmissions is reduced on the assumption the UE decoding capability
has been increased. The use of 2 HARQ processes by a UE has to be activated by
the eNB. The peak rate on a standalone non-anchor carrier is increased from 25
DL / 60 UL kbps to approximately 80 DL / 105 UL kbps for 1 HARQ UEs, and 125
DL / 140 UL kbps for 2 HARQ UEs.
**F. Lower power class**
RF requirements are introduced for a UE with a maximum transmit power of 14
dBm. The intention is to allow the use of small form-factor batteries which
provide a low peak current. Signalling is introduced to allow the network to
control if and how these UEs can access a cell. There is not compensation by
additional repetitions for control and data to account for the power class
reduction, as these UEs are assumed to be in normal or extended (rather than
extreme) coverage, but the UE selection of a coverage level for NPRACH
transmission is adjusted according to the UE\'s maximum power.

EC-GSM-IoT is an evolution of EGPRS as to provide a streamlined protocol
implementation, reducing the MS complexity while supporting energy efficient
operation with extended coverage compared to GPRS/EGPRS.
EC-GSM-IoT improves the coverage performance of Cellular IoT devices by 20 dB
compared to EGPRS along and enables long battery life time achieved by energy
efficient methods over the radio interface. The extended coverage is achieved
by a high number of blind physical layer transmissions along with modified
channel coding schemes.
In Release 13, the base station supporting EC-GSM-IoT requires a minimum of 4
consecutive timeslot resources reserved for packet data operation to support
extended coverage operation. Furthermore, the coverage improvement for low
power EC-GSM-IoT devices with 23 dBm output power is limited to 10 dB in this
release.
As part of radio interface enhancements introduced in Release 14, Extended
Coverage (EC) operation with a reduced number of 2 consecutive timeslot
resources both on DL and UL is enabled. In addition, a new uplink coverage
class CC5 is added to improve the MCL performance in uplink by 4 dB compared
to Release 13, which is specified both for 4 and 2 consecutive time slot
resources.
The two aspects (EC operation with reduced number of PDCH resources) and (New
uplink coverage class for improved uplink MCL performance) are developed
below.
**A. EC operation with reduced number of PDCH resources**
An additional coverage class mapping of blind physical layer transmissions is
introduced for higher coverage classes CC2 to CC4 where only 2 consecutive
timeslot resources per TDMA frame are available for extended coverage
operation. The new coverage class mapping will have increased (i.e. doubled)
BTTI compared to existing coverage classes as blind physical layer
transmissions need to be extended over twice the number of TDMA frames
compared to 4 consecutive timeslot resources.
The reference sensitivity performance of the new coverage class mapping is
comparable to that for the corresponding higher coverage class with 4 PDCH
mapping. This feature allows the network to deploy EC-GSM-IoT services by
allocating a minimum number of timeslots (i.e. 2) for EC traffic channel
operation. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 below.

Figure 8.3.3-1: Radio resources for EC traffic channel operation for Rel-13
and Rel-14.
**B. New uplink coverage class for improved uplink MCL performance**
With introduction of the new uplink coverage class CC5, the uplink MCL
performance for a EC-GSM-IoT device improves by additional 4 dB. This feature
allows the low power EC-GSM-IoT devices with output power of 23 dBm to operate
in further extended coverage condition upto 14 dB compared to EGPRS. The new
coverage class CC5 is specified both for 4 and 2 consecutive timeslot
resources on UL with comparable MCL performance.
On CC5 uplink traffic channel the coverage improvement is achieved by
increasing the number of bits for channel estimation along with a higher
number of blind physical layer transmissions. The CC5 random access channel
uses one of 2 specified extended access burst formats spanning across 2
timeslots: one format is based on an extended synchronization sequence whereas
the other format is based on two successive bursts using partially blind
physical layer transmission of bursts within a TDMA frame. The used format in
a cell is broadcasted by the network, whilst the EC-GSM-IoT device supports
both formats.

* * *
Dedicated Core Networks for GERAN introduces means for ensuring that devices
with certain characteristics such as machine type devices or belonging to a
certain MVNO can be handled by a preferred Dedicated Core Network (one or more
core network nodes). This is achieved through an update of the TS 48.018
Rerouting procedure wherein the selection of the Dedicated Core Network is
based on UE usage type obtained from subscription data in the HSS/HLR.
The selection of a Dedicated Core Network to serve a certain type of devices
such as machine type devices or devices belonging to a certain Mobile Virtual
Network Operator is based on a rerouting procedure wherein the BSS and the
SGSNs on a high level performs the following procedure at initial attach (see
Figure 8.3.5-1 below where the procedure is illustrated):
1) The BSS sends the initial attach request message to one of the SGSN serving
the BSS and includes a \"Redirect Attempt Flag\" IE.
2) The SGSN subsequently retrieves the \"UE Usage type\" from the HSS/HLR and
maps it to a Dedicated Core Network (addressed with \"Null-NRI/SGSN Group
ID\") and if it cannot serve the corresponding MS it returns the initial
attach message to the BSS and includes the \"Redirection Indication\" IE as
well as the \"Null-NRI/SGSN Group ID\" and possibly the \"Additional
P-TMSI\".\ If the SGSN determines that it can serve the device, it returns an
initial attach accept message to the BSS and includes the Redirection
Completed\" IE with outcome value set to \"MS is accepted\" or \"MS is already
registered\"
3) When the BSS receives an initial attach request message including the
\"Redirection Indication\" IE it continues the rerouting procedure by sending
the initial attach message to an SGSN identified by the \"Null-NRI/SGSN Group
ID\" and possibly the \"Additional P-TMSI\" and includes the \"UE usage type\"
IE and \"Redirect Attempt Flag\" IE.
4) The SGSN determines that it can serve the device and returns an initial
attach accept message to the BSS and includes the Redirection Completed\" IE
with outcome value set to \"MS is accepted\" or \"MS is already registered\"\
If the SGSN determines that it cannot serve the MS the SGSN has to return the
initial attach message to the BSS and includes a Redirection Indication IE
containing Reroute Reject Cause. No further Rerouting has to be initiated.
Note that the feature is only applicable to the PS domain and that the feature
doesn\'t require any MS specific functionality.

* * *
This Work Item supports the new GSMA\'s VoLTE architecture option called \"S8
Home Routed (S8HR)\". S8HR is an architecture for IMS voice roaming where,
even though the UE is roaming in a VPLMN, all the following entities are
located in the HPLMN: PGW, PCRF, ATCF, ATGW, P-CSCF, S-CSCF and TAS.
One of the main implications is that the S8HR roaming architecture is not
using the Local Breakout anymore and, therefore, the IMS APN is resolved to
point to a PGW in the HPLMN. So the IMS NNI between Home and Visited PLMN for
VoLTE roaming will be different whether the S8HR architecture is used or not.
The standardization of VoLTE roaming with S8HR architecture impacts several
areas, and was then handled by a number of 3GPP groups:
\- Architectural aspects (SA2 Work Item \"V8\"). This covers three main
topics:
\- Emergency call: For Local breakout roaming architecture, the home and
visited PLMN connect via the IMS NNI. The connection will provide all
essential information to establish emergency call. However, the S8HR
architecture has no IMS NNI.
\- Location determination at IMS entities in the HPLMN: the HPLMN IMS needs to
identify the subscriber\'s location for two main purposes: \"charging\" and
\"restriction and barring\".
\- Local number translation: Geo --local service number has been supported in
legacy CS network and IMS network to allow the user to access services in
visited network without dialling the national code or regional code of the
visited network. This procedure was available because all related network node
was located in VPLMN for legacy CS and Local Breakout, but not S8HR.
\- Core network aspects (CT Work Item \"V8-CT\"). Most of the CT groups work
was to add the new procedure to fetch and provide necessary information to
establish emergency call.
\- Security aspects (SA3-LI Study Item \"FS_LIV8\"). For S8HR VoLTE roaming
architecture, the SGW is the only network node that locates in the VPLMN.
Based on architectural assumption, the VPLMN need to access VoLTE for lawful
interception purpose. The study Item \"FS_LIV8\" identifies new network
deployment to make this procedure possible.
\- OAM aspects (SA5 Work Item \"CH14-V8\"). The traffic path for VoLTE roaming
with S8HR and Local Breakout architecture is different. The Local Breakout
charging principles are already stated on the 32-series specifications.
\"CH14-V8\" provides the additions of charging principle for S8HR roaming
architecture.

**Introduction**
VoLTE may require better LTE RSRP compared to data service, which means the
LTE radio signal may be good enough for pure data session but may not good
enough for VoLTE (i.e, QCI-1). When radio network is configured in such a
manner, eNB may trigger SRVCC handover as soon as EPS bearer with QCI-1 is
setup, for example the HO threshold for voice is RSRP = -118 dbm while for
data service is RSRP = -124 dbm.
{width="6.009027777777778in" height="1.2354166666666666in"}
Figure 9.1.2-1: handover threshold for voice and data
At this point, the VoLTE setup may fail if either UE or IMS does not support
bSRVCC or aSRVCC. As a result, call drop rate is increased due to call setup
failure.
Robust Call Setup for VoLTE subscriber in LTE (RobVoLTE) are key features for
LTE to provide voice service over 2/3G CS domain when the UE is located in the
area where the LTE radio signal may be good enough for pure data session but
may not good enough for VoLTE (i.e, QCI-1).
**Description**
**_Mobile originating handling in LTE weak coverage:_**
For originating session, P-CSCF send a response to UE and UE performs CSFB if
QCI=1 bearer setup request for VoLTE is rejected by E-UTRAN e.g. due to LTE
weak coverage
Figure 9.1.2-2: Originating session that uses only PS media -- fallback to CS
domain in pre-alerting phase
**_Mobile terminating handling in LTE weak coverage:_**
For terminating session, P-CSCF send a response to SCC AS and SCC AS
reattempts the terminating call establishment over CS domain if QCI=1 bearer
setup request for VoLTE is rejected by E-UTRAN e.g. due to LTE weak coverage.

**RAN aspects:**
The LTE Rel-14 Work Item Voice and Video enhancement for LTE achieves the
objectives of VoLTE quality/coverage enhancements, VoLTE/ViLTE signalling
optimization and provides the mechanism for the codec mode/rate selection and
adaptation based on the Study Item outputs.
Voice and Video over LTE (VoLTE/ViLTE) are key features for LTE to provide
voice and video service. With the quick migration from 2G/3G to LTE and the
increasing marketing requirement for high-quality voice/video services, voice
and video over LTE has being deployed and launched by operators over the
world, which makes voice and video over LTE capability extremely important for
operators [1]. For this reason, to improve voice/video coverage performance,
PUSCH enhancement mode is introduced involving the following main components
in RAN1.
The main purpose of the eVoLTE CE technologies is to reuse as much as possible
the existing CE technologies in eMTC CE mode A, while keeping independent of
eMTC \"CE mode A\" capability.
**Support UL asynchronous HARQ transmission:**
UL asynchronous HARQ transmission is supported for fully utilization of
transmission time. In the new PUSCH enhancement mode, HARQ process ID of PUSCH
is indicated by a 3-bit field in the new format DCI.
**Specification of enhanced TTI bundling:**
Different repetition levels of scheduled PUSCH is supported re-using eMTC
repetition scheme, with the repetition set {1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32}. 12
and 24 are new introduced repetition number compared to Rel-13 CE mode A in
eMTC. In the new PUSCH enhancement mode, the number of repetitions of PUSCH is
indicated by a 3-bit field and the maximum of the repetition number is
signalled by RRC.
**Specification of bundle frequency hopping enabling multi-subframe channel
estimation:**
Bundle frequency hopping is supported reusing eMTC hopping scheme enabling
multi-subframe channel estimation, with hopping interval and offset specified
separately.
In RAN2 and RAN3, voice and video enhancements are focused on the three
aspects, including the RAN-assisted codec adaptation, VoLTE/ViLTE signalling
optimization and VoLTE quality/coverage enhancement.
**The RAN-assisted codec adaptation:**
RAN-assisted codec adaptation provides a means for the eNB to send codec
adaptation indication with recommended bitrate to assist the UE to select or
adapt to a codec rate for MMTEL voice or MMTEL video. The RAN-assisted codec
adaptation mechanism supports the uplink/downlink bitrate increase or
decrease.
For uplink/downlink bitrate adaptation, eNB sends the recommended bitrate to
the UE, which the UE may use in combination with other information to adapt
the bitrate, e.g. the UE may send a rate request to the peer UE via
application layer messages, which the peer UE may use in combination with
other information to adapt the codec bit rate.
The recommended bitrate for UL and DL is conveyed as a MAC Control Element
(CE) from the eNB to the UE as shown in figure1, and which is presented by an
index value.
Figure 9.1.2-4: UL/DL bitrate recommendation
Based on the recommended bitrate from the eNB, a UE may initiate an end-to-end
rate adaptation with the peer UE. The eNB may inform the UE on the currently
admissible transport bit rate on the local uplink and downlink. The UE may
also send a query message to its local eNB to check if a bit rate recommended
by its peer can be provided. A prohibit timer can be configured by the network
to limit UEs sending frequent query messages, so UE will be allowed to
triggered a rate recommendation query message only when the network configures
the prohibited timer and the timer is not running. The UE is not expected to
go beyond the recommended bitrate from the eNB.
The recommended bitrate query message is conveyed as a MAC Control Element
(CE) from the UE to the eNB as shown in figure2. SR will not be triggered by
the query MAC CE.
Figure 9.1.2-5: UL/DL bitrate recommendation query
**VoLTE/ViLTE signalling optimization:**
In case of network congestion (e.g. maximum number of users that can be
connected, poor radio conditions, etc), an operator may want to prioritize
MMTEL voice/MMTEL video access. For both type of accesses, the MO voice call
cause value is used.
\"Inter-RAT Redirection\" cause in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message with
updating the meaning of the cause is reused for redirection of VoLTE. When eNB
decides to perform redirection to another E-UTRAN frequency, the eNB sends UE
CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message with this cause value. Upon receiving UE
CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message with this cause value, the MME should suspend
the GBR bearer for the voice service for a while. The time of keeping the
voice GBR bearer should be long enough to allow the UE to recover after
redirection. On the UE side, if the UE receives the RRC Connection Release
message with redirection and the voice call is ongoing, the UE keeps the call
in the application layer. After the UE re-accesses the network, the voice GBR
bearer can be recovered immediately.
**VoLTE quality/coverage enhancement:**
VoLTE coverage can be effectively enhanced by relaxing the air interface delay
budget. UE uses RRC signalling to report the delay budget information. Based
on the reported delay budget information, when a UE is in good coverage, the
eNB can configure longer DRX for power saving purpose or the eNB can reduce
DRX cycle in order to help peer side; when the UE is in bad coverage, the eNB
can increase the retransmission times in order to reduce the packet loss.
**SA4 specific aspects:**
This summary reports on the normative specification progress accomplished
during the course of the LTE_VoLTE_ViLTE_enh-S4 work item [1]. This is the SA4
building block of the LTE_VoLTE_ViLTE_enh feature, where the core feature
LTE_VoLTE_ViLTE_enh-Core [2] has been specified by RAN2. The WI summary for
the core part has already been submitted to RAN plenary in March 2017, and can
be found in RP-170323 [3].
Media handling aspects of RAN-assisted codec adaptation in MTSI were specified
in TS 26.114 including the following aspects: (i) Adaptation requirements,
recommendations and guidelines for speech and video adaptation mechanisms, in
response to the availability of RAN-recommended UL/DL bitrate information at
the MTSI client (on both MTSI sender and receiver sides), including impacts on
adaptation triggers, sender behaviors and receiver behaviors, (ii) Utilization
of RAN-recommended UL/DL bitrate information in generation of RTCP-APP or RTP
CMR messages for speech rate adaptation, (iii) Utilization of RAN-recommended
UL/DL bitrate information in generation of RTCP feedback (e.g., TMMBR, TMMBN
messages of CCM, etc.) messages for video rate adaptation. (iv) Use with
dynamic bitrate adaptation, including adaptation of sent and received media
utilizing RAN-recommended UL/DL information and recommended bitrate query
messages, (v) Impact of availability of RAN-recommended UL/DL bitrate
information on SDP offer/answer session re-negotiation procedures in MTSI. The
support of this feature for MTSI was specified based on a more generalized
\"access network bitrate recommendation\" (ANBR) framework to allow for usage
for both LTE access and non-LTE access, while also establishing the clear
connections to LTE access and associated mappings between ANBR messages and
RAN-specified MAC level messages for LTE access. The related agreed CR can be
found in Tdoc S4-170450, CR26114-0410.

### Enhancements to Domain Selection between VoLTE and CDMA CS
Summary based on the input to be provided by China Telecom at SA#78.

670005 **Enhancements to Domain Selection between VoLTE and CDMA CS** eDSVCC 1
S1 SP-150045
* * *
This work item clarifies the requirements for domain selection between VoLTE
and CDMA CS for terminating calls when the terminating UE is attached only to
one domain (LTE or CDMA CS).
Voice over LTE (VoLTE) is set to become mainstream technology for IP-based
telecommunications.
During the transition time where VoLTE deployments and coverage areas will co-
exist with CS voice coverage areas, a selection problem will occur.
CDMA uses different UE domain registration databases for CDMA CS and LTE.
For a terminating call to subscriber with multi mode terminal that is only
attached to one domain (LTE or CDMA CS), and when using the same Mobile
Directory Number (MDN, i.e. the CDMA\'s equivalent to MSISDN), the CDMA
operator will have to select which voice domain to use between LTE and CDMA
CS.
In order to make the correct decision on which domain to select for mobile
terminated calls the requirements needed to be clarified, which is what was
done by this Work Item.It can be noted that so there is no corresponding stage
2 work since this work item deals only with clarifying some requirements.
  1. MBMS improvements \-----------------
    1. ### MBMS Transport Protocol and APIs
Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm and Samsung in SP-170744.
* * *
700054 **MBMS Transport Protocol and APIs** TRAPI 1 S4 SP-150851
* * *
TS26.347[2], as developed during this work item, defines APIs to allow the
development of MBMS-aware applications (MAA) that leverage the functionality
provided by an MBMS Client in the UE to access 3GPP MBMS User services as
defined in TS 26.346[3]. The purpose of this new specification is the
definition of enablers in order to simplify the usage of MBMS in web-centric
as well as app-based service environments. TS26.347 defines several APIs to
access MBMS User Services and a URL scheme to access resources available as
part of an MBMS User Service.
MBMS Application Programming Interfaces (MBMS-APIs) were introduced primarily
for developers of web and user applications with the objective of abstracting
complex MBMS procedures by the use of simple methods and interfaces. MBMS
client vendors can implement the service APIs to simplify the integration of
third party MBMS-aware applications with MBMS User Services as shown in Figure
1.

Figure 9.2.1-1: End-to-end Architecture for Application Service Providers
using eMBMS for Delivery
Figure 1 shows a general service architecture including a reference client.
The content provider provides media formats to a BM-SC, typically through the
xMB interface and initiates services and sessions through the xMB interface.
The BM-SC establishes MBMS User Services and the lower layers support the
delivery of the data through regular 3GPP unicast as well as MBMS broadcast
bearers. The MAA initiates the communication with the MBMS client using the
MBMS-API. The MBMS client identifies the relevant services and provides access
to the data of the requested broadcast service to the MAA. The media formats
typically conform to well-defined media delivery formats provided through
existing interfaces such as HTTP or IP sockets. The MAA controls the media
client.
{width="6.692361111111111in" height="4.824305555555555in"}
Figure 9.2.1-2 TRAPI Architecture
The MBMS-Aware Application (MAA) queries the MBMS client to provide a list of
services associated with a type and an application. Based on the list of
available services, the MAA uses the APIs to initiate the service. The MBMS
client provides the service acting as a server or router for the media
service. The MAA can control the service consumption through control APIs, for
example to stop the service and possibly switch to a different one. The media
client is basically unaware that the content is delivered over MBMS which
enables reuse of existing media clients.
In addition, TS 26.347 now also defines a URL scheme for MBMS User services.
The URL handling is designed to refer to a single resource, just like HTTP (or
FTP), and hence can be used in the myriad places that resources are referred
to by URLs. Indeed the \'threads\' of the world-wide web are the URL pointers
that link resources together.
Using MBMS URLs in the formats that reference resources by URLs enables
services using those formats to use MBMS delivery of resources. Many of those
services also use 'fallback lists\', where the origin format (for example, the
\ element in HTML) embeds a series of alternatives, giving, for each, a
URL pointer and some information (MIME type, codecs used, and so on) about the
resource at that location. Platforms not supporting the resource type, or URL
type, of an alternative would skip past it, moving down the fallback list.
This could, for example, enable a content distributor to offer high bitrate,
high quality, content via MBMS, and a lower-quality, lower bitrate fallback
over HTTP, in a backwards-compatible way.
Note that the TRAPI framework is not applicable when the MBMS bearer services
are used according to the principles defined within the framework of GCSE. In
the particular case of GCSE, the BM-SC does not initiate any unicast
communication to any entity in the UE. Work on Mission Critical applications
or based on the GCSE architecture is handled via a different study item [4]
and will be covered in a different specification (TR 23.792).

This feature introduces the support of end-to-end eCall over IMS. It requires
all the involved parties and entities to be upgraded to support eCall over IMS
emergency calling: the In-Vehicle System (IVS), the Mobile Network Operator
(MNO), and the Primary Safety Answering Point (PSAP).
This features allows some improvements in the handling of the eCall
functionality and improves the user experience. For instance, it removes some
limitations due to the previous use of an in-band modem as to transfer the
minimum set of data in a TS12 call. It also allows, in the long-term, the
phase out of the CS core and access networks.
The service requirements is defined in TS 22.101 [1].
Based on stage-1 requirements, the following functionality was introduced in
Stage 2:
\- TS 23 401 [2]: introduce eCall for EPS over E-UTRAN and define its impact
on the procedures.
\- TS 23.167 [3]: provide architectural and other stage 2 support in emergency
call procedures
\- TS 23.237 [4]: provide procedures for interworking of eCall over IMS to CS
domain
The \"Support of eCall on IMS Emergency Services using the PS domain\" is only
supported over LTE.

Barring services and possibly other supplementary services settings of the IMS
(IP Multimedia Subsystem) multimedia telephony service may be sensitive
information. The subscriber may wish to protect the service setting so that
the user (which can be different from the subscriber) cannot change the
service setting. This work item introduces password protection for activation
of supplementary services in IMS as is available for Circuit Switched (CS)
telephony supplementary services defined on TS 22.030.
This WI provides the following functionalities:
a) XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) procedures to protect service
configuration by a password, including:
1) password change procedure; and
2) format to include the current password in the SIP URI in the XCAP User
Identity;
b) specific procedures to use a password for barring services;
c) mapping functions to map the CS procedures to the new XCAP procedures,
generally implemented by the MSC server enhanced for IMS Centralized Services.
The format of the new password is the same as in the CS networks, i.e. a four
digit PIN code.
This Work Item was covered by Change Requests to existing specs (no new specs
created), in particular to TSs 22.173, 24.238, 24.611, 24.623 and 29.292.

This Work Items introduces in TS 26.223 the various media handling extensions
needed for IMS-based telepresence (TP).
This includes the introduction of:
\- the Multi-Stream MTSI (MS-MTSI) client capability for TP UEs and associated
updates on media configuration,
\- the SDP offer-answer procedures and examples,
\- the HEVC Screen Content Coding extension codec support for TP, with a
recommendation that TP UEs should support \"H.265 (HEVC) Screen-Extended Main,
Main Tier, Level 4.1\" and \"H.265 (HEVC) Screen-Extended Main 4:4:4, Main
Tier, Level 4.1\".
Additional guidelines on the use of the CLUE protocol for IMS-based
telepresence, end-to-end QoS handling and media adaptation were also specified
in TS 26.223.

This work item ensures consistency of all the possible extensions of the \"SIP
Reason\" header field.
The \"Reason\" header field was indeed extended for ITU-T Q.850 cause codes
(RFC 6432), preemption (RFC 4411) and more recently release-cause (CR#5612 to
TS 24.229). Instead of studying extensions on a case-by-case basis, that would
not consider the whole context of the \"Reason\" header usage, it has been
decided to create this work item, which defines a generic and future-proof
mechanism for protocol extension of the \"Reason\" header.
The extensions of the \"Reason\" header field were discussed within this WID
to maintain a global consistency on the header format and to make decisions
concerning the way it has been extended, and in which standardization body
(3GPP or IETF), with a complete view of the benefit it could yield for all
3GPP requirements.
The \"Reason\" header has been extended with:
\- a new protocol value FAILURE_CAUSE to be used in SIP error responses; and
\- a new header field parameter to provide the Q.850 location parameter in SIP
(new IETF Internet-Draft).

* * *
The Diameter Load Control Mechanism as developed by IETF (draft-ietf-dime-
load-09 [1]) allows Diameter nodes to send \"load\" information which may be
used by recipient nodes e.g. for dynamic load balancing or overload
prevention. Following the conclusion from TR 29.810 [2] CT3 and CT4 have
specified in their 3GPP Diameter applications the option to make use of the
IETF mechanism on various Diameter based 3GPP core network interfaces.
The key functionalities are specified by IETF in draft-ietf-dime-load-09 [1].
Load information can be conveyed by piggy-backing IETF-defined information
elements on 3GPP Diameter application specific answer commands. The conveyed
load information can be used end-to-end and/or hop-by-hop indicating the
current load of the answering target node and/or next hop agent. Load
information receiving nodes can use the conveyed information e.g. by replacing
a preconfigured static weight with the actual received load value. The means
how load is calculated by the reporting node is implementation specific.

Starting with Rel-5 in 3GPP the Diameter base protocol defined in RFC 3588 is
used. This RFC is replaced by RFC6733 and RFC 3588 was marked as obsolete by
IETF in October 2012.
In TR 29.819 the differences between the two diameter base protocol versions
and the impacts to 3GPP specifications were analysed and recommendations were
provided what should be taken into account when the new diameter base protocol
version is referenced.
To align 3GPP specifications with the newest RFC 6733 it is decided that
starting with Release 14 new reference points using diameter will refer to RFC
6733 and in specification on reference points referring to RFC 3588 the
reference is replaced by a reference to RFC 6733 in the Rel-14 versions of
these specifications.
For backward compatibility it is considered that existing application for
which nothing has been specified regarding the presence of the Vendor-
Specific-Application-Id AVP in the command\'s CCF specification, it is assumed
that the requirement on the mandatory presence of the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVP applies. For those applications, if the command\'s CCF
specifications are not updated, an informative note is added to indicate that
the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP is present in any command supported by
the application _._
In line with the agreement in TR 29.819 the following TS\'s are modified and
refer to RFC 6733 in TS 29 series: TS 29.061, TS 29.109, TS 29.128, TS 29.153,
TS 29.154, TS 29.172, TS 29.173, TS 29.212, TS 29.214, TS 29.215, TS 29.217,

TS 29.329, TS 29.336, TS 29.337, TS 29.338, TS 29.343, TS 29.344, TS 29.345,
TS 29.368, TS 29.468, TS 29.213, TS 29.155, TS 29.201.
The TS 32.299 (Diameter charging applications) is now referring to the new
IETF RFC 6733 for the Diameter Base protocol, including the Accounting
functionality as before.
The impacts on TS 32.299 resulting from this new version for the Diameter Base
Protocol are:
\- Explicit reference to TS 33.210, which is the common reference for Diameter
transport security, to ensure IPsec is kept as mandatory to support (for
backward compatibility), in addition to TLS/DTLS mandated by IETF RFC 6733.
\- The new Command Code Format (CCF) for several commands re-used from
Diameter Base protocol.
\- Information related to end-to-end security has been removed from the 3GPP
specific AVPs table description since E2E security framework is deprecated by
IETF RFC 6733.
The reference to the Diameter Base Protocol is removed from the TS 32.2xx
series charging specifications which are protocol independent.

This feature allows the correlation of charging relevant information by
concatenation of applications or specific interconnection and roaming
scenarios by providing a method to identify all network elements (including
applications) generating CDR for offline charging within an IMS.
It specifies the principle to determine the completeness of charging
information in IMS architecture and for roaming architecture for voice over
IMS with home routed traffic, and adds related CDR parameters and AVPs. The
information taken is a new dedicated SIP parameter within the \"P-Charging-
Vector\" header for tracking all Network Elements (NEs) and Application Server
(AS) (including one or more related application ID\'s) on the call path for
which a CDR will be written.
Within the Billing Domain, this information helps to correlate the charging
information collected from the IMS entities.
The principles for Determination of Completeness of Charging Information in
IMS is specified in TS 32.240.
The support of Determination of Completeness of Charging Information in IMS
and the additional SIP Content (FE Identifier List) to the CDR content is
specified in TS 32.260.
ASN.1 definition for the FE Identifier List is specified in TS 32.298.
The AVP definition for the FE Identifier List is specified in TS 32.299.
### SCC AS Restoration
Summary based on the input provided by China Telecom in CP-170xxx.
* * *
710003 **SCC AS Restoration** SCCAS_RES 1 C4 CP-160118
* * *
Following the conclusions of the TR 29.812 [1], the purpose of this Work Item
is to include the SCC-AS restoration mechanism in the TS 23.380 [2].
In the IMS environment, the Service Centralization and Continuity Application
Server (SCC-AS) provides two important functionalities: Terminating Access
Domain Selection (T-ADS) for routing of incoming sessions requests to IMS user
and Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC) between different radio access
networks for voice calls that are anchored in the IMS. If the SCC-AS fails,
either the incoming sessions request is rejected or the session is established
and the voice call will be dropped when moving from one access network to
another, leading to a bad user experience.
TR 29.812 [1] has investigated possible solutions for SCC AS restoration
procedure and concluded on a preferred solution in which the SCC AS stores
extra SRVCC related information in the HSS, information that can be retrieved
and used by a backup SCC-AS taking over from a failed SCC-AS.
This purpose of this Work Item is to describe the solution identified in TR
29.812 [1] into TS 23.380 [2], specifying the IMS Restoration procedures. This
was covered by a unique change request (CP-160216 [3]).

**_Introduction_**
This work item updated TS 22.153 to align with Stage 2 and 3 capabilities that
have been specified for Multimedia Priority Services (MPS) but were not
completely reflected in the Stage 1 requirements. The updates provided
clarifications and corrections to the existing text and requirements, and
inclusion of requirements for missing capabilities.
Previous work was completed under the following WIs: PRIOR, ePRIOR, TEI10, and
TEI11.
**_Description_**
The following is a summary of the key clarifications, corrections and
functionalities included in the Release 14 update of TS 22.153:
â€¢ The general description of MPS in clause 4 was clarified and additions were
included to describe the different aspects of priority treatment needed for
end-to-end MPS support such as service invocation, authorization, end-to-end
priority treatment, invocation-to-release priority treatment, and network
interconnection and protocol interworking. In addition, an explicit list of
end-to-end network scenarios covered under the scope of MPS was added.
â€¢ Text in Subclause 5.4 (Priority session treatment in terminating network)
was corrected to allow operator option to provide MPS based on the terminating
party priority information, even when the calling party is not subscribed to
MPS service.
â€¢ Added text in Subclause 5.4a to clarify the scope of the\" priority data
bearer service\" applies to data and video services which are not under IMS
control.
â€¢ Explicit requirement to have at least 5 levels of user priority was added in
Subclause 5.5 (Priority levels) for Stage 1 aligned with Stage 3.
â€¢ Subclause 5.9 on handover was clarified to align Stage 1 requirements on
resource allocation during handover with Stage 3 procedures. These provide for
priority for both the signaling and bearer resource allocation.
â€¢ A new Subclause 5.10.3 on CS Fallback from LTE was added to include Stage 1
requirements to align with specified Stage 2 and 3 capabilities. Priority is
given within the LTE system to signaling required to transfer the call to the
CS domain.
â€¢ The Stage 1 requirement in clause 5.11 (Network Management Functions) was
corrected to also provide an exemption from load rebalancing (in addition to
existing exemptions for congestion control, overload control, and load
balancing) to align with the Stage 2 specifications.
â€¢ A new Subclause 5.12 (Policy Control) was added to include requirements to
make and enforce relative priority decision between different MPS application
services subject to regional/national regulatory requirements and operator
policy.
â€¢ A new Subclause 5.13 (Priority before service invocation) was added to
include requirements to provide advance priority treatment in radio access
networks, that is, subscription-based priority is provided in advance of
service invocation to provide priority in support of the service invocation
signaling. It was made explicit that this subscription-based begins at the
time of attach even before subscription information is downloaded from the HSS
to the MME, and includes procedures in the UE associated with RRC Connection
Establishment as per Subclause 5.3.3 of [TS 36.331]. A reference is added to
the requirement in [TS 22.011] Subclause 4.4a in which MPS is allocated
exclusive use of a special access class in the range AC 11-15. The network can
control UE-behaviour though SIB2 indications on the required access.
â€¢ A new Subclause 5.14 (Recovery/Restoration) was added on operational
measures to expedite service recovery and restoration (i.e., service
restoration after failure/unavailability).
â€¢ A new Subclause 5.15 (Quality of Service) was added to align with Stage 2
and 3 procedures specified for QoS handling of QoS rules that are specific to
MPS voice, MPS video, and MPS data service.
â€¢ Text and requirements were added to clause 6 (MMI aspects) to reflect the
need for a service code for the 3GPP network to support on-demand invocation
of MPS.
â€¢ Clause 7 (Security and privacy) was updated to include requirements on
general security protection, confidentiality/privacy, and use of encryption.

This Work Item enhanced the feature developed in the previous Rel-13 Work Item
on MMCMH to provide a richer teleconferencing experience by enabling optimal
use of better quality media codecs in a more efficient manner across the
terminals, MRF, and radio access network.
The Work Item introduces the following functions to the feature:
\- Specified a new SDP attribute 'ccc_list\' that allows terminals and the MRF
to communicate and negotiate their concurrent codec capabilities in a compact
format that significantly reduces the amount of signalling needed
\- Specified usage of common codecs which are necessary to guarantee that all
terminals can communicate with one another, and preferred codecs which can
support higher quality communication between a subset of the terminals.
\- Provided guidelines on how to use the simulcast and RTP level pause/resume
functions to enable the MRF to minimize transcoding and other resource usage
\- Provided guiding examples of the QoS reservations needed to support MMCMH
sessions
These enhancements were needed to improve the user experience while making the
service more viable as the richer and immersive nature of the MMCMH feature
can demand significant resources from the system in terms of bandwidth and
processing.

### Improved Streaming QoE Reporting in 3GPP (IQoE)
Summary based on the input provided by Huawei Technologies Ltd in SP-170521.
* * *
710011 **Improved Streaming QoE Reporting in 3GPP** IQoE 1 S4 SP-160082
* * *
Since Rel-10, TS 26.247 [1] specifies how a streaming client reports the QoE
metrics, which can give useful information on how users are experiencing their
video streaming quality.
This Work Item improves the QoE reporting concept, including the possible use
of the newly published ITU-T P.1203 standard [3] to estimate the final user
experience of video streaming quality, thus offering the 3GPP operator better
possibilities for controlling the QoE reporting.
The following new functionalities are described in the related study TR 26.909
[2], and implemented in TS 26.247:
\- Add new device-related QoE metrics (such as screen size etc.) to enable use
of P.1203 standard model.
\- Add QoE control and reporting possibilities via the control plane, so that
the 3GPP operator can handle these measurements in a similar way as existing
MDT [4] radio measurements.
\- Add geographical filtering, as well as filtering due to streaming source
provider, so that the 3GPP operator can enable QoE measurements more
selectively.

* * *
In current UMTS networks, operators can estimate the end user experience based
on legacy ways, e.g. throughput, data loss, latency. For streaming services,
ITU-T P.NATS has released the standards on the model and evaluation of MOS
models and in SA4\'s WI on \"Improved Streaming QoE Reporting in 3GPP Services
and Networks\", SA4 agreed to support MDT enhancements option for both QoE
metrics configuration and QoE metrics reporting [1].
Based on the above information, the QoE Measurement Collection feature could
provide means for operators to better understand the user perception, and thus
operators could choose the appropriate way for network optimization and
enhance user experience.
With this feature, the network can configure collection of measurements from
the UE. The feature defines QoE measurement configuration and measurement
reporting containers, and the feature uses the MDT framework [1]. QoE
measurement configuration received from OAM or CN is encapsulated in a
container, which is inserted in a Measurement Control message and forwarded to
the UE transparently. QoE measurements received from UE higher layer are
inserted in a container in a Measurement Report message and sent over SRB4.
The QoE measurement configuration is supported in CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH
states, whereas the QoE measurement reporting is supported in CELL_DCH state
only.
Both signalling based and management based initiation cases are allowed. For
the signalling based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated towards
a specific UE from CN nodes using the MDT mechanism as described in clause
5.1.3 [1]; for the management based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is
initiated from OAM targeting an area (without targeting a specific UE).

The primary purpose of this Work Item [1] is to develop test methods and
performance objectives for 3GPP mobile devices featuring Enhanced Voice
Services (EVS), regarding the voice call performance when transmitting from
noisy locations.
It defines a framework for collecting listening test data per ITU-T
Recommendation P.835 [2]. Then, it organizes a collection of 27 listening test
databases for the training and validation of a fullband speech quality
prediction model. It subsequently defines test methods and performance
objectives for devices regarding super-wideband and fullband speech quality in
background noise.
Prior to this work item, the only available predictor of speech quality in
background noise operated at narrowband and wideband. There was a need for an
analogous predictor, but operating at super-wideband and fullband. The
products of this work item facilitated the development, training, and
validation of such a predictor in ETSI TC STQ.
One major output of this WI is the subjective framework [3], which define
specifics for conducting subjective listening tests according to ITU-T Rec.
P.835. These specifics include: references to methodologies for laboratory
reproduction of realistic background noise scenarios including noise file
recordings; specifications for creating the required fullband reference test
signal set (anchors) for the listening tests; requirements on configuration
and levels for target speech.
The framework was used by several companies to collect and report on a total
of 27 ITU-T Rec. P.835 listening tests [4].
The databases (listening files and corresponding scores per ITU-T Rec. P.835)
were then used by delegates to ETSI TC Speech and Multimedia Transmission
Quality (STQ) to develop, train, and validate predictors of P.835 scores
operating in the fullband context [5].
A CR to TS 26.132 [6] now references the new fullband predictor for purposes
of predicting speech quality in noise for new super-wideband and fullband test
cases. A corresponding CR to TS 26.131 [7] now references the new test method
to define new performance objectives for super-wideband and fullband use
cases.

This work item introduces a mechanism of enhanced user location reporting
based on the study use cases and propose potential requirements. It mainly
concerns the ability of 3GPP networks to support enhanced user location
reporting when LCS is not deployed on the network. The results of the work
item were reflected on the additional requirements for enhancements on user
location reporting capabilities of TS 22.101 14.1.0.
This WI specifies requirements of the enhanced user location reporting
include:
a) take the cell-level location at pre-configured time points into account;
b) considering the common users characteristics within defined cell or cells;
c) define the focus area, with which the 3GPP core network will be notified
when the user enters or leaves the focus area.
The support of enhanced user location reporting is mainly focus on the LCS is
not deployed on the network.

This work item further improves indoor positioning accuracy in a LTE network
by introducing OTDOA/E-CID enhancements and network assistance data for WLAN,
Barometric Sensor, and TBS positioning based on Metropolitan Beacon System
(MBS) signals. Indoor positioning was already enhanced in Release 13 to meet
the increasing demand of commercial applications, as well as to address the US
FCC Enhanced 911 requirements. The Release 14 work item addresses many of the
specification impacts of the positioning enhancements studied and described in
technical reports 36.855[1] and 37.857[2] for the aspects of the study that
were not completed in the Release 13 work item.
**Part 1: OTDOA enhancements:**
The following features are used to enhance OTDOA (observed time of arrival
difference) positioning technology.
**1) OTDOA enhancements in shared physical cell identity scenario:**
A Release 13 UE cannot distinguish PRS (positioning reference signal)
transmitted by transmission points (remote radio heads, a remote antenna of a
base station) that shared the same physical cell identity.
This feature enables UE to identify different transmission points with shared
the same physical cell identity, thus the positioning accuracy can be
improved.
**2) PRS based Beacon:** This feature introduces a new type of transmission
point that only transmits PRS (PRS based Terrestrial Beacon System (TBS)).
This feature enables UE to identify additional PRS transmitted by PRS based
beacon, thus the positioning accuracy can be improved.
**3) PRS plus CRS measurement for OTDOA:** This feature enables a UE to
combine PRS and CRS (cell specific reference signal) together for RSTD
measurement. Thus, the positioning accuracy can be improved.
**4) Multipath Time of Arrival (ToA):**
A Release 13 UE reports a single RSTD measurement value (reference signal time
of arrival difference) of every PRS to the E-SMLC (positioning server) for
OTDOA positioning calculation. However, the RSTD measurement will be impaired
by multipath fading channel. Multipath time of arrival may occur and it is
difficult for UE to decide which path is the first path that can reflect the
distance between UE and transmission point.
This feature enables the UE to report time of arrival information of multiple
paths. The E-SMLC can use this information to compensate the measurement error
caused by multipath fading channel. Thus, the positioning accuracy can be
improved.
**5) Reduced quantization error:** The granularity of RSTD reporting is
enhanced. Thus, the positioning accuracy can be improved.
**Part 2: Network assistance data for WLAN, Barometric Pressure Sensor, and
TBS based positioning:**
The following features for further RAT-independent indoor positioning
enhancements were introduced in this work item:
**1) Barometric Pressure Sensor based positioning:** In Release 13, Barometric
pressure sensor-based positioning does not have support for UE-based
positioning mode and there is no network assistance data defined **between the
E-SMLC and the UE**. In Release 14, this feature enhanced the existing
signaling and procedures in LPP (LTE positioning protocol) to enable E-SMLC
network assistance and UE-based positioning mode for barometric pressure
sensors.
**2) TBS (based on MBS signals) positioning: In Release 13, TBS positioning
based on MBS signals does not have support for UE-based positioning mode and
there is no network assistance data defined between the E-SMLC and the UE. In
Release 14, this feature enhanced the existing signaling and procedures in LPP
to enable E-SMLC network assistance and UE-based positioning mode for TBS
based positioning.**
**3) WLAN-based positioning: In Release 13, WLAN-based positioning does not
have support for UE-based positioning mode and there is no network assistance
data defined between the E-SMLC and the UE.** In Release 14, this feature
enhanced the existing signaling and procedures in LPP to enable E-SMLC network
assistance and UE-based positioning mode for WLAN-based positioning.

The Feature \"Improvements of awareness of user location change\" (AULC) is an
improvement of the Release 12 Feature \"Core Network Overload - User Location
Information reporting improvement\" (CNO_ULI).
With CNO_ULI, only one Presence Reporting Area (PRA) is possible per IP-CAN
Session. AULC extends this PRA mechanism by allowing multiple PRAs per IP-CAN
session, while maintaing the reduced CN load gained by CNO-ULI. Moreover, it
provides a mechanism to avoid an MME overload in case of too many PRA
monitoring subscriptions.
Finally, AULC offers to decouple the subscription between the PCRF and the
Online Charging System (OCS), which means that the PCRF and the OCS can
subscribe multiple PRAs reporting separately.
Three kinds of PRAs have been defined, which can be mixed:
1) UE dedicated PRA: those PRAs information are provisioned by the PCRF/OCS to
the MME each time the IP-CAN session is established. The PRA information
includes both the PRA ID and the PRA list.
2) Predefined PRA: the PRA list has been predefined in the MME, and the PCRF
only needs to indicate the PRA IDs so as to activate the corresponding PRAs in
the MME.
3) PRA set: The PCRF can indicate one PRA set ID to activate a group of PRAs
predefined in the MME.
The PCRF can subscribe PRAs monitoring for a given UE in term of event trigger
and the MME will report to PCRF via S/P-GW as soon as the UE enters/leaves the
subscribed PRAs.
Since multiple PRAs reporting is supported, this leads to the updating of the
\"attach\" and \"handover\" procedures.
The MME can select and activate only a part of PRAs indicated from PCRF and
return the result to PCRF.
The figure below shows how does the PRA id and the list is provisioned to the
MME and the triggering for MME to report PRA change to PCRF.
{width="5.768055555555556in" height="2.576388888888889in"}
Figure 10.4-1 multiple PRA reporting
From a Stage 3 pespective, the GTP-C and Diameter protocols in S11, S5/S8 and
Gx interface have been modified to support the multiple PRA feature.
One more event trigger named \"Multiple PRA Feature\" has been added in
TS29.212 while keeping Rel-12 CNO_ULI feature for backward compatibility.
The charging aspects have also been updated to support multiple PRAs and to
allow OCS to subscribe PRAs for charging while decoupling from the PCRF
behavior (in CNO_ULI, the PRA subscription is coupled between PCRF and OCS,
which means PCRF and OCS have to subscribe the same PRA for event trigger).

This feature allows the network to perform IMEI checking when an UE is
requesting access to EPC via Trusted / Untrusted WLAN e.g. for stolen devices.
It uses the Rel13 CT feature \"MEI_WLAN\" that consists in the retrieval of
the IMEI by the network. On its turn, EIR check for WLAN access to EPC is used
in particular by the Rel-14 SA2 \"SEW2\" feature, which introduces extensions
needed for emergency calls over WLAN for unauthenticated UEs.
A new interface S13a, enabling IMEI check from the 3GPP AAA server/proxy, is
added between the home 3GPP AAA server and the EIR for non-roaming cases, and
between the 3GPP AAA Proxy and the EIR for roaming cases.
The IMEI check over WLAN procedures are optionally used during the initial
attach over untrusted and trusted WLAN access, as follows:
\- The 3GPP AAA server (if the ePDG/TWAN is in the HPLMN) or the 3GPP AAA
proxy (if the ePDG/TWAN is in the VPLMN) is the entity that determines whether
to trigger the IMEI check for the UE, and whether to continue or stop the
procedure.
\- For untrusted WLAN, if required by local regulations, the ePDG is
configured for retrieving the IMEI from the UE and to forward it to the AAA
server/proxy. The AAA server/proxy directly accesses the EIR used in the same
PLMN for IMEI checking.
\- For trusted WLAN in non-roaming cases, the 3GPP AAA server retrieves the
IMEI from the UE and directly accesses the EIR used in the same PLMN for IMEI
checking.
\- For trusted WLAN in roaming cases, the 3GPP AAA proxy requests the 3GPP AAA
server in the HPLMN to retrieve the IMEI from the UE. The AAA server then
forwards the retrieved IMEI to the TWAN, which relays it to the AAA proxy. As
for untrusted WLAN, the AAA proxy directly accesses the EIR used in the same
PLMN for IMEI checking.

The procedures for access to 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via non-3GPP
access networks have been enhanced in Rel-14 to enable an EPC network to
optionally support the EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP). ERP allows
efficient re-authentication between the UE and a dedicated server that can be
located in the TWAP or the 3GPP AAA proxy/server and provides optimized link-
setup delay after handover between access points.
The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) (IETF RFC 6696 [1]) is used for
authentication of user accessing EPC using non-3GPP access networks. To avoid
full EAP authentication when moving from one access point to another one of
the same access network, ERP has been defined to ensure efficient re-
authentication between the UE and an EAP re-authentication server through any
access point.
In SA2, TS 23.402, which specifies the procedures for access to EPC via
non-3GPP access networks, has been enhanced in Rel-14 to enable an EPC network
to optionally support ERP. By using ERP, UEs can connect to EPC via trusted or
untrusted non-3GPP access and utilize EPC services with enhanced performances
provided by an optimized link-setup delay after handover between access
points.
The security aspects were covered by the WI \"ERP\" under the responsibility
of SA3 (730048). The stage 3 was covered by the WI \"ERP-CT\" under the
responsibility of CT4 (730003) for core network impacts and CT1 (730045) for
UE impacts.
The main actions to complete the Work Items were to:
\- Include a functional description of the use of ERP for EAP re-
authentication into the 3GPP TS 33.402 [2], including a specific ERP key
derivation;
\- Enhance the functionalities the 3GPP AAA server/proxy and the related
procedures **over STa, SWa and SWd interfaces** specified in TS 29.273 to
support related ERP procedures as specified in TS 33.402. Specific data used
in ERP (Authorization rights, ERP keying material, etc.)
\- Enhance the functionalities of the UE described in the 3GPP TS 24.302 to
indicate that an UE may support ERP.

This feature includes:

without USIM.
\- The roaming scenario, by which the UE accesses an emergency PDN GW in the
visited country. This includes the determination by the UE of the country it
is located in.
\- The support of S2a/Trusted WLAN access: the UE includes an emergency
request in EAP-AKA\' signalling to the 3GPP AAA server, which uses this
information to give precedence to this session in case of signalling
congestion and unauthorized UEs to not carry out certain checks.
\- The selection a proper access node in case of emergency service. In case of
untrusted WLAN, the prioritized selection of an ePDG supporting emergency
services in the country the UE is located in. For Trusted WLAN, the addition
of an emergency services support indication by the TWAN, relayed by the AAA
server, which enables the UE to select a proper WLAN Access Point.
\- Seamless mobility between WLAN and E-UTRAN: the selected PDN GW is used as
an anchor at handovers between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses. In the case of un-
authenticated UE\'s or roamers, a static PDN GW is configured in the ePDG or
the Trusted WLAN and in the MME. In the case of non-roaming authenticated
UE\'s, it is possible to use a dynamically selected PDN GW by the HSS being
notified of the PDN GW identity at session establishment and the retrieval of
this identity by the target system during the handover procedure. The WLAN to
CS session continuity for Emergency call over WLAN is also supported using the
Dual Radio VCC procedure, however the other direction is not supported.
\- The EIR check (e.g. to verify whether the device has not been stolen), per
feature \"EIR check for WLAN access to EPC\" (EWE).
\- The prioritized determination of the emergency numbers by the UE, including
emergency numbers preconfigured in the UE, emergency numbers being provided to
the UE over 3GPP access of the last registered PLMN, or received over WLAN via
DNS or ANQP IEEE procedures.
\- Mechanisms to provide the PSAP with the UE location, provided by the
network and/or by the UE.
However, this feature does not include the support of QoS differentiation, as
this is part of another feature (Rel-15 VoWLAN: Complementary Features for
Voice services over WLAN).

### T-ADS supporting WLAN Access

This Work Item enhances the Terminating Access Domain Selection (T-ADS)
mechanism as to support IMS voice over WLAN. Indeed, the pre-Rel-14 T-ADS does
not take into account IMS voice over WLAN, which may lead to a wrong decision
of call when the UE moves between WLAN and UTRAN/GERAN.
The T-ADS mechanism contains two aspects: the definition of the information
considered for the domain determination, and the way for the SCC AS to
determine the terminating domain, based on this information.
The key information used by the T-ADS mechanism is the time stamp at which the
UE attached to a given access network. More precisely, this Work Item
introduces (in the Insert-Subscriber-Data-Answer (IDA) command) two time stanp
values: the one of the most recent IMS registration or re-registration via
WLAN, and the one of the 3GPP access network that had the most recent radio
contact with the UE. These two time stamps are then taken into account by the
SCC AS to determine the access domain.
### Enhanced LTE-WLAN Aggregation (LWA)

In Rel-14, the following LTE-WLAN Aggregation (LWA) enhancements have been
introduced: UL aggregation on LTE and WLAN, mobility enhancements (handover
without WT change), 60GHz band support, neighbour eNB reporting for ANR and
WLAN suspend/resume.
Release-14 Enhanced LWA builds on top of the baseline Release-13
functionality, adding the following enhancements:
\- Uplink transmission on WLAN, including uplink aggregation
\- Mobility enhancements, specifically support for handover without WT change
\- Support for 60GHz 802.11 band
\- Automatic Neighbour Relation (ANR)
\- WLAN suspend/resume
Release-13 LWA supports uplink transmission on LTE only. Uplink support added
in Release-14 is conceptually similar to Dual Connectivity (DC) uplink
support, with some adjustments made for WLAN: the eNB may configure an uplink
data split threshold and if the data available for transmission in the UE is
above that threshold, the UE submits PDCP PDUs to either AM RLC entity or
WLAN. The selection of which PDCP PDUs to send via LTE or WLAN is left of UE
implementation. If the data available for transmission is below the configured
threshold, the UE sends PDCP PDUs via LTE or WLAN, as configured by the eNB
using another IE.
In Release-13, LWA configuration is released upon handover. In Release-14, an
enhancement has been added, allowing the UE to retain the LWA configuration
and therefore to remain associated to the current WLAN AP (if in coverage)
during handover. Therefore, during LTE HO, WLAN transmission and reception can
continue. To support this functionality, a new procedure referred to as
\"Handover without WT change\" has been defined. In this procedure, during the
handover, the target eNB initiates the WT Addition procedure (to the same WT
the UE is associated with) and the source eNB may postpone the WT Release
Request, so that the data may be sent/received via WLAN during the HO. As the
UE may need to temporary use two keys to decipher PDCP PDUs received from the
target eNB and from the source eNB (via the WT), the end marker approach has
been agreed, in which the source eNB sends the end marker after sending the
last PDCP PDU. The UE uses the end marker indication to switch to the target
eNB security key.
To support IEEE 802.11 operating in the 60GHz band (aka WiGig), this band has
been added into RRC and Xw-AP protocols.
For ANR, measurement enhancements have been defined, allowing reporting of
WLANs outside the list of WLAN IDs in the WLAN measurement object.
Additionally, Xw-AP enhancements have been agreed, to allow WT reporting of
neighbour eNBs -- which allows the eNB to deduce the information about the
WLAN network topology, thus reducing the OAM effort required for LWA
deployment.
Additionally, WLAN suspend/resume indication from the UE has been added. This
enhancement allows the UE which needs to temporary connect to another WLAN
(e.g. a smart watch) not to tear down LWA connection.
### Enhanced LTE WLAN Radio Level Integration with IPsec Tunnel (eLWIP)

* * *
This Work Item enhances LTE-WLAN Radio Level Integration with IPsec Tunnel
(LWIP) by:
\- Defining LWIP flow control e.g. via reuse of the LWA framework;
\- Defining improvements to WLAN measurement framework e.g. as defined within
the eLWA WID;
The solution supports legacy WLAN deployments without any need for
modifications to the deployed WLAN nodes.
This was achieved by standardizing the interface between the eNB and the SeGW
supporting LWIP (the LWIP-SeGW).
This interface was decided to be based on Xw. This indeed allows to reach the
two objectives above by reusing existing Xw procedures: Xw flow control and Xw
resource reporting.
LWIP flow control: the flow control for LWIP will be per UE and will concern
data transmitted from the SeGW towards the UE.
LWIP resource reporting: Resource reporting is based on the information
provided from APs, but it is not mandatory for legacy APs to support the
feature.
The key aspects of the Xw-based connectivity between the eNB and the LWIP-SeGW
(which thus became a 3GPP node, offering limited WT functionality to handle
the needed Xw procedures) are:
\- The common XwAP procedures are to be used for both LWA and LWIP;
\- UE-specific XwAP procedures are to be defined separately for LWA and LWIP;
the new procedures are:
\- LWIP Addition Preparation procedure (class 1)
\- eNB initiated LWIP Modification Preparation procedure (class 1)
\- eNB initiated LWIP Release procedure (class 2)
\- LWIP-SeGW initiated LWIP Release procedure (class 1)
\- WLAN identifiers for LWIP are to be enabled at Xw setup and WT
configuration update; this is achieved by adding a flag to the WLAN
Information IE;
\- Separate E-RABs and QoS are not supported over Xw in the version of the
specification; the transport layer and Xw UP specifications has been extended
to handle LWIP traffic;
\- The same XwAP UE IDs are used for both LWA and LWIP.

Positioning Enhancements for GERAN introduces means for an improved ability to
estimate the position of a mobile station operating in normal GSM as well as
in EC-GSM-IoT coverage without using satellite positioning such as GPS,
GLONASS, Beidu or Galileo. This is achieved by introducing a new base station
centric Multilateration Timing Advance procedure and a new mobile station
centric Multilateration Observed Time Difference procedure. The
Multilateration Timing Advance procedure enable positioning as accurate as 50
m in 67% of the positioning attempts when using only three base stations (see
R6-160235, \"Enhanced Positioning -- Positioning performance evaluation\",
Source Ericsson LM).
Multilateration Timing Advance Procedure
This positioning procedure is based on one or more base stations acquiring
timing advance information from a set of cells selected by the mobile station
(corresponding to a set of distances to each cell). The position of the device
is then determined using so called multilateration where the position of the
mobile station correspond intersection of three or more arcs, see Figure 1.

Figure 11.2.1-1: Illustration of Multilateration Timing Advance Procedure
Multilateration Observed Time Difference Procedure
This positioning procedure is based on the same multilateration principles as
the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure with a difference that in the
neighbour cells the distance to the bases stations instead are based on so
called observed time difference measurements made by the mobile station.

This WI delivered 6 new TS\'s adding 2 new strong algorithms (GIA4 and
GEA5/GIA5) for cyphering and integrity protection of GSM CIoT data, each
algorithm having an algorithm specification, an implementer\'s test
specification and a conformance specification.
This work item delivered the following:
\- TS 55.241 [1] -- The design specification for GIA4 which is an integrity
protection algorithm intended for use with GSM based on KASUMI [2].
\- TS 55.242 [3] -- The implementer\'s test data specification for GIA4
integrity protection algorithm specified in TS 55.241 [1].
\- TS 55.243 [4] -- The conformance test data specification for GIA4 integrity
protection algorithm specified in TS 55.241 [1].
\- TS 55.251 [5] -- The design specification for GEA5 (cyphering algorithm)
and GIA5 (integrity protection algorithm) intended for use with GSM based on
SNOW 3G.
\- TS 55.252 [6] -- The implementer\'s test data specification for GIA4
integrity protection algorithm specified in TS 55.251 [5].
\- TS 55.253 [7] -- The conformance test data specification for GIA4 integrity
protection algorithm specified in TS 55.251 [5].
These algorithms can be selected by GSM terminals and networks using the
current algorithm selection mechanisms.
Each Algorithm has a trio of documents: a design specification detailing how
the algorithm works, an implementer\'s test specification that has test values
for both the final calculations and the intermediate steps to allow
implementers to prove their developments and a conformance test specification
for final testing by the developers or by a third party,
Due to the security nature of these specifications and the strength of the
algorithms, these specs are only issued under licence from 3GPP.

* * *
The RRC optimization for UMTS work item contained two enhancements:
\"Simultaneous RAB/RB Setup and Release\" and \"Generic UPH Reporting\".
In earlier releases of UMTS the setup, release and reconfiguration of radio
bearers have been done using different RRC messages, namely the messages Radio
Bearer Setup, Radio Bearer Release and Radio Bearer Reconfiguration. In cases
where e.g. one radio bearer has been setup at the same time as another radio
bearer has been modified, it has been necessary to send two different RRC
messages. The \"simultaneous RAB/RB setup and release\" enhancement allows
setup, release and reconfiguration of radio access bearers and radio bearers
in the same RRC message. The RRC message is the Radio Bearer Reconfiguration
message.
In MAC layer, the UE may report the Uplink Power Headroom (UPH). The UPH of a
frequency indicates the ratio of the maximum UE transmission power and the
corresponding DPCCH code power of that frequency. In the enhancement for
Generic UPH Reporting, the option to configure RRC events for UPH reporting is
introduced. The RRC events allow the UE to perform measurements on UE Power
Headroom (UPH) and signal the RRC events 6h and 6i when the UPH becomes larger
or less than an absolute threshold respectively. The thresholds are
configurable, as well as hysteresis, time-to-trigger, filter coefficient and
pending time after trigger for each of the events.

In UMTS Rel-9, Dual Cell E-DCH operation feature was introduced and only 2ms
TTI can be configured on both primary and secondary uplink frequencies. The
uplink coverage of cells deployed in different carriers may be different, as
for example when the primary carrier uses a lower frequency, e.g. 900 MHz, and
the secondary carrier uses a higher frequency, e.g. 2.1 GHz. Dual Cell E-DCH
operation can be enhanced by allowing 10ms TTI on either primary or secondary
uplink frequency or both.
The WI \"Multi-Carrier Enhancements for UMTS\" introduces additional
combinations of TTI length on Dual Cell E-DCH operation and the enhanced TTI
switching mechanism:
\- For the TTI length combinations:
\- 10ms TTI is supported on both primary and secondary uplink frequency (10 ms
+ 10 ms TTI configuration)
\- a combination of 2 ms TTI and 10 ms TTI is supported (2 ms + 10 ms TTI
configuration)
\- For the enhanced TTI switching mechanism:
\- it allows switching TTI either on primary or secondary uplink frequency or
on both, and
\- the UE can send the filtered UPH report in MAC control information on
either primary or secondary uplink frequency to the network.

RP-162513
* * *
This Work Item introduces DTX/DRX enhancements for smart phones in CELL_FACH
state as a way to improve their battery life.
HS-DSCH/E-DCH transmission in CELL_FACH was introduced in Releases 7 and 8,
and is currently deployed. This feature is useful for smart phone services to
improve resource utilization and latency of state transition between CELL_FACH
and CELL_DCH.
Considering the increasing number of users and the amount of traffic for small
data applications, the UE will be in CELL_FACH state more often, and the
introduction of HS-SCCH DRX is a way to save UE battery life.
With this functionality, the UTRAN indicates an inactivity time, a HS-SCCH DRX
cycle length and a HS-SCCH RX burst length. This information is stored by the
UE for use when in CELL_FACH state. If HS-SCCH DRX is configured through
dedicated RRC signalling, the UE has to follow HS-SCCH DRX operation in
CELL_FACH state.
The feature is initialized when the inactivity timer expires. The inactivity
timer is triggered whenever no data transmission activities are ongoing. When
the inactivity timer expires, the UE has to only monitor HS-SCCH order for the
HS-SCCH DRX burst length. If the UE receives the HS-SCCH order, it starts
receiving HS-DSCH continuously with an offset after the HS-SCCH order.

The total radiated MIMO sensitivity (TRMS) requirements for the verification
of multi-antenna reception performance of UEs in LTE have been agreed (Clause
8 of TS 37.144), and the outcome of the harmonisation activity between the
MPAC, RTS, and RC+CE methodologies has been agreed (Clause 10.3 of TR 37.977).
This concludes the RAN4 effort to develop MIMO OTA test methodologies and to
define the UE requirements spanning the following prior study and work items:
Rel-11 SI on Measurement of radiated performance for MIMO and multi-antenna
reception for HSPA and LTE terminals, Rel-12 WI on Verification of radiated
multi-antenna reception performance of UEs in LTE/UMTS, and Rel-13 WI on
Radiated requirements for the verification of multi-antenna reception
performance of UEs. A corresponding RAN5 WI on Conformance Test Aspects --
Radiated Performance of Multiple-antenna Receivers in the LTE UE is tasked
with completing the MIMO OTA testing specification (TS 37.544). This work item
has addressed the GCF request to develop OTA requirements for MIMO-capable LTE
UEs.
As part of the class of over the air (OTA) requirements, the TRMS metric seeks
to quantify the radiated performance of a handheld UE when receiving a rank-2
MIMO transmission. This metric is intended to verify the performance of the UE
antenna subsystem, RF processing, and demodulation in baseband. The TRMS
metric is measured for handheld UEs in free space utilizing three testing
conditions, as shown in Table below.

The test equipment measures the sensitivity levels over the air (OTA) at the
specified throughput levels for each UE testing condition and UE angular
rotation relative to the test equipment antennas. During the measurement the
test equipment emulates the SCMe urban micro-cell (UMi) fading profile, as
defined in clause 8.2 of TR37.977.
The harmonisation part of the work item has selected the multi-probe anechoic
chamber (MPAC) methodology as the reference methodology and has concluded that
one other methodology, the radiated two-stage (RTS), is capable of producing
the same propagation conditions of the specified fading profile within certain
scope and conditions. The detailed analysis and outcome of the harmonisation
effort are captured in clause 10.3 of TR 37.977. MPAC and RTS methodologies
are defined in clauses 6.3.1.1 and 6.3.1.3, respectively; their diagrams are

This WI specifies the reaping of the potential system throughout gain from
large Active Antenna (AA) arrays (comprising up to 64-128 TXRUs) in wider
deployment scenarios (including high speed UEs and higher-order MU spatial
multiplexing) by enhancing pertinent reference signals (RSs), CSI (Channel
State Information) reporting mechanism, and transmission schemes.
Based on the conclusion from the EB/FD-MIMO study item (captured in TR36.897),
some relevant specification support was developed for EB/FD-MIMO in Rel-13 by
enhancing DL CSI and DL Demodulation Reference Signals (DMRS) as well as CSI
reporting mechanism. However, only a part of the proposals resulting from the
study have been specified. First, only up to 16 antenna ports are supported.
Therefore, the benefit from AA arrays with more than 16 TXRUs is limited.
Second, there is no enhancement on CSI reporting to enable efficient MU
(multi-user) spatial multiplexing. Lastly, there is no support for providing
higher robustness against CSI impairments (such as inter-cell interference or
higher-speed UEs). The eFD-MIMO WI for Rel-14 was proposed to address these
Rel-13 limitations.
The following new functionalities have been specified:
\- Enhanced non-precoded CSI-RS: New non-precoded CSI-RS patterns for 20, 24,
28, and 32 ports intended to aid CSI measurement and reporting for base
stations (transmission points) equipped larger AA arrays. The frequency
density of these new patterns can be configured between normal and reduced
density values.
\- Enhanced beamformed CSI-RS: Three mechanisms to enable more efficient usage
of UE-specific beamformed CSI-RS resources (e.g. to allow more UEs to share a
pool of CSI-RS resources) -- aperiodic CSI-RS (where a UE is configured to
measure CSI-RS in a given subframe for reporting aperiodic CSI), multi-shot
CSI-RS (where a UE is configured to measure periodic CSI-RS and report
periodic/aperiodic CSI in a limited time period), and configurable frequency
density reduction.
\- Enhanced UL DMRS: To increase the number of orthogonal UL DMRS ports (to
increase multiplexing capacity), UL DMRS patterns with lower IFDM/comb density
\- Precoding codebook extension for non-precoded CSI-RS: Since non-precoded
CSI-RS design is extended to additional number of ports (20, 24, 28, and 32),
the precoding codebook designed in Rel-13 for 8, 12, and 16-port CSI-RS is
extended to support these four additional number of ports.
\- Joint utilization of different CSI-RS types: Two mechanisms to facilitate
efficient joint utilization of two distinct types of CSI-RS \-- first
mechanism between non-precoded CSI-RS and one-resource beamformed CSI-RS,
second between multi-resource beamformed CSI-RS and one-resource beamformed
CSI-RS. Relevant enhancements include CSI reporting optimization and the
associated DL signalling support.
\- Advanced (high-resolution) CSI for MU spatial multiplexing: High-resolution
dual-stage codebook for facilitating 1- and 2-layer DL transmission per UE and
improving MU precoding at the base station. The codebook is designed based on
the concept of beam (precoder basis) combination and allows finer quantization
of channel eigenvectors at the UE.
\- DMRS-based semi-open-loop transmission: A diversity-based transmission
scheme aided by partial reporting of PMI (Precoding Matrix Indication) for 1-
and 2-layer transmission. The partial PMI reporting enables the base station
to perform diversity operation combined with wideband/long-term beamforming.
Compared to a typical DMRS-based precoding, this transmission scheme tends to
be more robust for high-speed UEs and against inter-cell interference.

This work item includes two phases of work. In phase 1, several solutions for
reducing the mobility interruption time are evaluated and studied. In phase 2,
two solutions (i.e. Make_Before_Break and RACH-less) are decided to minimize
the mobility interruption including handover and SeNB change.
RACH-less:
The RACH-less solution is to reduce the mobility interruption time by removing
the RACH procedure during the mobility events including handover and SeNB
change. The RACH-less solution is determined only by the target eNB, and only
applicable for the scenarios where the uplink transmission timing does not
change (i.e. intra-site) or equals to \"0\" (i.e. small cell). The following
components are specified to support the RACH-less solution:
\- Indicate the uplink timing (i.e. NTA) to be used for the target cell in the
handover command
\- Provide the pre-allocated uplink grant in the handover command. The minimal
interval of the pre-allocated uplink grant is 2ms. The non-adaptive
retransmission in the pre-allocated uplink grant is prioritized over the new
transmission. The redundancy version of the HARQ retransmission in the pre-
allocated uplink grant is fixed to \"0\". The pre-allocated uplink grant is
released upon the successful completion of the mobility event.
Make-Before-Break:
The Make-Before-Break solution is to reduce the mobility interruption time by
keeping the source connection after the reception of the handover/SeNB change
command and before the first transmission/reception on the target cell. The
Make-Before-Break solution is only applicable for the intra-frequency
scenario. The following components are specified to support the Make-Before-
Break solution:
\- Delay the layer-2 reset after stopping the transmission and reception on
the source cell(s)
\- The source eNB (or source MeNB for the SeNB change) determines the Make-
Before-Break handover/SeNB change by requesting the target eNB to add the
make-before-break indication in the RRC message which is used for the mobility
event. The target eNB adds the make-before-break indication in the RRC message
which is sent to the UE via the source eNB when the handover/SeNB change is
accepted.

This work item covers two independent improvements: support for 256QAM in UL
and support for PUSCH in UpPTS.
Uplink 256QAM is introduced by extending the current LTE design and takes in
learnings from the design of DL 256QAM in Rel-13. With the support of UL
256QAM came also the introduction of new UL UE categories that would utilize
the newly added modulation order in UL.
PUSCH transmission in UpPTS is introduced in frame structure 2. This enables
the introduction of TTI bundling for TDD UL/DL configurations #2 and #3. The
PUSCH transmission within UpPTS can be sent by the UE with an associated DM-RS
within UpPTS or not.

In an LTE system there are multiple components contributing to the total end
to end delay for connected UEs. The limitations in performance are in general
use case dependent; for which e.g. UL latency may influence the DL application
performance and vice versa.
In general, a UE with data to send has to send a Scheduling Request (SR) to
receive a UL scheduling grant before transmitting the data packet. In order to
send a SR, a UE has to wait for a SR-valid PUCCH resource and a corresponding
scheduling grant transmitted on PDCCH to the UE in response. When the grant on
PDCCH is decoded, the data transmission can start over PUSCH.
As an alternative to reduce the grant request delay in the above, the network
(i.e. eNB) may choose to pre-schedule a UE by either issuing a dynamic grant
via PDCCH without apriori buffer status information, or alternatively, use a
Semi Persistent Grant (SPS). By doing so, the NW may avoid additional delay in
the grant request procedure given that the time to the next grant opportunity
is short.
In the WI for Latency reductions, enhancement to pre-scheduling and SPS have
been defined and specified, in order to increase the latency reduction gains,
reduce UL interference and increase the effectiveness of available scheduling
tools.
The following enhancement to SPS in FDD and TDD are introduced:
\- Introduction of short periodic UL SPS grant intervals in order to reduce
the latency of the first UL transmission compared to legacy intervals using
RRC configured UL SPS grants;
\- Introduction of the UE to skip padding transmissions in SPS UL grant if
there is no UL data in the UE buffer in order to decrease UL interference and
improve UE battery efficiency;
\- Introduction of the transmission of a SPS activation and de-activation
confirmation from UE, triggered as new MAC Control Element (MAC CE) to
increase robustness in SPS when UL grants are skipped by UE;
\- Introduction of non-adaptive retransmission on SPS resource (prioritized
over new data transmission) to allow configured SPS UL grant resources in
subsequent TTIs.
\- In the WI, the following enhancement to dynamic scheduling (PDCCH) in FDD
and TDD are introduced:
\- Introduction of a RRC configurable option to mandate UE to skip padding
transmissions on a dynamic grant received on PDCCH if there is no UL data in
the UE buffer in order to decrease UL interference and improve UE battery
efficiency.

This work item provides mechanisms for user equipment (UE) with limited or no
uplink (UL) carrier aggregation (CA) capability to perform switching to a time
division duplex (TDD) secondary component carrier (i.e., secondary cell or
SCell) for sounding reference signal (SRS) transmission without PUCCH/PUSCH
configured on that carrier. This improves downlink (DL) performance by
exploiting DL/UL channel reciprocity on that carrier, and is useful for a UE
supporting aggregating more DL carriers than UL carrier(s).
A CA-capable UE can receive simultaneously on a number of component carriers
(CCs) in DL, but in general the UE can transmit simultaneously on only a much
smaller number of carriers in UL (typically one) for the transmissions of
physical uplink control channel (PUCCH), physical uplink shared channel
(PUSCH), and SRS. For this reason, before Release 14, a TDD CC of the UE may
be configured as a DL-only CC and not have corresponding SRS in UL (which may
be referred to as PUSCH-less TDD CC), and hence DL beamforming on this CC
cannot exploit channel reciprocity based on sounding.
To improve the DL beamforming performance, support for SRS transmissions on
all configured TDD CCs, including on PUSCH-less TDD CCs, is allowed in Release
14 via the introduction of SRS switching, while ensuring that the UE\'s UL CA
capability is not exceeded at any point in time. In addition to the
configuration of PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS on CCs with full UL, the network also
configures SRS on PUSCH-less TDD CCs. When such SRS needs to be transmitted,
the UE temporarily suspends the UL transmission on a CC configured with PUSCH,
switches to a PUSCH-less TDD CC, transmits SRS on the CC, and then switches
back, as shown in the figures below.

SRS switching and transmission on a TDD PUSCH-less CC in an UL subframe
Figure 11.4.1.6-1. Illustration of SRS carrier-based switching
The following components are specified to support the SRS switching feature.
**Configuration of SRS on possibly all TDD CCs** : SRS can be configured on
possibly all TDD CCs. Each \"switching-to\" CC (a PUSCH-less TDD CC) is
configured with a \"switching-from\" CC with full UL. The \"switching-from\"
CC can be a TDD CC or a FDD CC, and it suspends its transmission when the
\"switching-to\" CC is transmitting.
**Power control of SRS** : New power control formulas are introduced so that
the UE can set SRS power without referring to PUSCH. The higher layers
configure open-loop power control parameters for SRS transmission, and the
physical layer signals transmit power control (TPC) command for closed-loop
SRS power control. The TPC command is sent in a new group downlink control
information (DCI) called format 3B.
**Timing advance (TA) of SRS** : SRS TA needs to be determined for each
\"switching-to\" CC. This CC first has to be configured with a TA group (TAG).
If TA is not available for a TAG with all PUSCH-less TDD CCs, then a non-
contention based random access procedure needs to be performed, which also
requires the UE to switch from a CC with PUSCH to a PUSCH-less CC for
transmitting random access preamble. After the TA is acquired, TA command can
provide finer adjustment of the SRS TA.
**Periodic SRS and aperiodic SRS** : Periodic SRS and aperiodic SRS can be
configured on a PUSCH-less CC. The configurations and operations are generally
similar to those for legacy SRS but with the additions that the \"switching-
from\" CC needs to be configured and SRS switching needs to be performed. In
addition, aperiodic SRS transmission on a PUSCH-less CC can be triggered by
DCI format 3B.
**RF retuning for SRS switching** : A UE may need to perform RF retuning for
switching among two CCs. This feature supports UEs with RF retuning time in
the range of {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, ..., 6.5, 7} OFDM symbol durations. The RF
retuning time is part of UE capability and is reported to the network.
**Collision handling** : SRS switching can cause collision to other
transmission/reception operations. Priority/dropping rules are defined so that
higher priority operations are kept and lower priority ones are dropped. In
cases when SRS switching may constantly collide with ACK/NACK, the network may
also configure the UE with modified ACK/NACK timing and/or flexible SRS
switching so that the SRS switching and ACK/NACK transmission do not overlap
in time, avoiding the collision.

The Work Item \"Downlink Multiuser Superposition Transmission\" (MUST)
achieves the objectives of developing enhancements of downlink multiuser
transmission schemes within one cell and assisting UE to cancel or suppress
intra-cell interference by the provision of assistance information for
interference cancellation. Although MUST and the LTE Rel-12 Work Item Network-
Assisted Interference Cancellation and Suppression (NAICS) both rely on
receivers to perform interference cancellation, the latter targets the inter-
cell interference and is typically used when the user is at the cell edge,
while the former aims at the intra-cell interference.
The key functionalities of MUST are described as follows. A UE is signalled by
RRC if it is to be configured for potential MUST operation. When a UE is
higher-layer configured to have MUST, some bits are added into the downlink
control information (DCI) as MUST assistance information. The UE monitors some
bit field in the DCI to see whether MUST is enabled in a transmit time
interval.
In MUST, there are three cases featured by the mechanisms of PDSCH
superposition:
**\- Case 1:** Superposed PDSCHs are transmitted using the same transmission
scheme and the same spatial precoding vector
**\- Case 2:** Superposed PDSCHs are transmitted using the same transmit
diversity scheme
**\- Case 3:** Superposed PDSCHs are transmitted using the same transmission
scheme, but their spatial precoding vectors are different
* * *

An example of composite constellation of Case 1 and Case 2
* * *
Case 1 and Case 2 are supported in transmission mode (TM) 2/3/4 using up to 2
transmit antenna ports. The PDSCH of two UEs are superposed using MUST
Category 2 in TR 36.859 [1], in which one of the UE (called the near UE) has a
better received signal quality than the other UE (called the far UE). An
example of transmit side processing for Case 1 and Case 2 is shown in Figure
1. After channel coding, rate matching and scrambling, the coded bits for near
and far UEs are jointly mapped to modulation symbols of a composite
constellation. Gray mapping is kept for the label bits of the composite
constellation. Figure 2 gives an example for a composite constellation.
The near UE cancels the signal intended for the far UE before detecting its
own signal, while the far UE treats the signal intended for the near UE as
noise. This is feasible since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the near UE
tends to be high, while the far UE has a low SNR with the modulation order
always QPSK and easy to be cancelled. Flexible power partition (denoted as _Î±_
in Figures 1 and 2) between near and far UEs is chosen to maximize the sum-
rate under certain fairness criterion. The network assisted information
signalled in DCI for the near UE includes the indication of whether MUST is
enabled in the TTI and the power allocation.

Figure 11.4.1.7-3: An example of Case 3 transmit side processing when two UEs
are paired, and each has 1 data layer. In the figure, layer mapping is omitted
since both UEs have single data layer.
* * *
Case 3 is supported in TM 8/9/10 using up to 8 transmit antenna ports. The
PDSCH superposition is the same as in MU-MIMO. There is no concept of near UE
and far UE as in Case 1 and Case 2; each UE cancels the interference located
at spatial layers other than the desired signal when assistance information
about the knowledge of interference is provided. An example of transmit side
processing for Case 3 is shown in Figure 3. The maximal number of interfering
spatial layers signalled in the assistance information is configured by RRC.
The assistance information of interference signalled in DCI includes the
modulation order of interference and the antenna port of each interfering
layer.

This work item provides effective solutions to support of the number of eNB
beyond 1.04 million in one PLMN and to support cells beyond 256 in an eNB.
These solutions are no impact on UE operations and air interface, and useful
for operators to extend the space of eNB-ID and Cell-ID.
There are only two types of eNB IDs supported in Rel-13 specification:
\- Macro eNB: 20 bits eNB-ID, 8 bit Cell-ID in one eNB
\- Home eNB: 28 bits eNB-ID, only one cell in an eNB
For Macro eNB, the capacity of eNB-ID is about 1.04 million and the capacity
of Cell-ID in an eNB is 256. With the deep LTE deployment, there is a request
from operators to support more than 1.04 million eNBs in a PLMN and also
support more than 256 cells in an eNB [1]. Therefore, one long and one short
extended eNB ID are introduced in Rel-14 specifications without any UE impacts
[2]:
\- short Macro eNB ID: 18bits eNB-ID and 10 bits Cell-ID in one eNB
\- long Macro eNB ID: 21 bits eNB-ID and 7 bits Cell-ID in one eNB
With the long Macro eNB ID, the number of eNB in a PLMN can be up to 2.04
million. While with the short Macro eNB ID, 1024 cells can be supported in one
eNB.
When to choose 21 bits or 18 bits Macro eNB-ID is up to the operator
deployment. Upon the new type eNB-ID is applied in the network, all the nodes
(e.g. CN, eNB, UTRAN, GSM, Wi-Fi and etc) have to be upgraded to understand
the new types of eNB-ID.

The 4Rx UEs are verified with RF requirements covering 2 UL CA and DC.
Note that 4Rx+DC are covered by 4Rx +2UL CA.

Although some vehicles move with the speed over than 300 km/h, most of
requirements are specified under below 350 km/h in existing specifications.
This work item improves the mobility and throughput performance under high
speed up to and above 350 km/h by enhancing the requirements for UE RRM, UE
demodulation and base station demodulation. The work item specifies enhanced
RRM requirements, RRC signals for high speed scenarios and enhanced PRACH
requirements in TS 36.133, TS 36.331 and TS 36.211, respectively.

Figure 11.4.1.12-2: SFN high speed scenarios
**Part 1: RRM requirements enhancements:**
Up to Release 13 of LTE, the latency requirements under DRX configuration
would result in performance degradation under high speed scenario. In order to
achieve good mobility performance and less paging outage, the following
enhanced requirements are introduced.
**1) Enhanced RRM requirements in DRX in connected mode:**
The cell identification delay and measurement period are reduced in DRX.
**2) Enhanced RRM requirements in idle mode:**
The cell detection delay, measurement period and evaluation time are reduced
in idle mode.
**Part 2: Demodulation enhancements**
**3) For UE demodulation enhancements**
For UE demodulation requirements, significant performance gap is observed
under 350km/h and 30km/h in SFN scenario because of the impact of opposite
Doppler shifts associated with separate paths on the UE demodulation. This
feature enables UE to use an enhanced receiver for SFN scenario (Figure 2) to
handle the Doppler shift issue. Note that performance requirement itself will
be specified in performance part.
**Part 3: PRACH enhancements**
Under high speed, for PRACH, the high Doppler shift would cause detection
ambiguity. The feature introduces a PRACH sequence for high speed scenario.

This work item identifies the necessary changes to the existing multi-band BS
requirements for BS capable of operation in three or more bands, and specifies
multi-band BS testing with three or more bands, using the existing multi-band
BS testing with two bands as a base.
Numerous Work Items to support the LTE Advanced 3, 4 or 5 Band Carrier
Aggregation (3DL/1UL or 4DL/1UL or 5DL/1UL) have been approved in RAN. One of
the objectives of these WIs is to specify the band-combination specific RF
requirements and testing with three or more bands.
On the other hand, new operating bands continue to be added, and the
transmit/receive frequency ranges of some of those are sufficiently close such
that implementation of a common radio supporting simultaneous transmission /
reception of three or more bands become a feasible option. Example includes
Bands (8+20+28) in Europe for multi-RATs (GSM and LTE) operation. The
advantages of this implementation option may include dynamic power sharing
between different bands and hence allow operators more flexibility in the
network deployment, reduced installation complexity for different bands at the
same site, and reduced insertion loss for multi-band antenna sharing since no
combiner is needed.
The BS testing for multi-band BS capable of operation in three or more bands
has been discussed in RAN4 under TEI for nearly 2 years. It was concluded that
a work item was needed to conduct this work in a structured manner.
The objectives of this work item are to identify the necessary changes to the
existing multi-band BS requirements for BS capable of operation in three or
more bands, and to specify multi-band BS testing with three or more bands in
the RAN4 specifications, using the existing multi-band BS testing with two
bands as a base. The work has been focused on the following steps:
1) The following band combinations are considered feasible for implementation
of multi-band BS capable of operation in three or more bands:
1) Bands (8+20+28) in Europe.
2) Bands (1+3+7).
3) Bands (25+4+7).
2) Conclude that a generic testing approach can be applied to all the
identified band combinations.
3) Specify multi-band BS testing for all the identified band combinations. In
particular, to decide:
1) The RF bandwidth location and carrier placement within the operating bands
and frequency ranges supported by the BS.
2) Conclude on the multi-band combinations to be tested out of the supported
ones for BS that supports multiple multi-band combinations.
3) Other aspects of multi-band BS testing like test configurations that are
necessary to complete the specification.

This Work Item separates the S/P-GW and the TDF functionality into user plane
functions and control plane functions. This is provided as a solution to the
ever-growing data traffic while maintaining a low latency for services such as
social networks or web browsing.
In addition, a flexible placement of user plane functions (e.g. centrally or
closer to the RAN) is enabled, while the control plane functions could still
remain centralized and continue to support the interfaces to the other network
entities (like MME, PCRF, Charging Systems).
TS 23.214 [1] specifies the stage 2 level functionality for control and user
plane separation of EPC\'s SGW, PGW and TDF. Updates to procedures in other
specifications (TS 23.401 [2], TS 23.203 [3], TS 23.402 [4] and TS 23.060 [5])
are described therein as well.
The overall functionality provided by the SGW, PGW and TDF is not changed and
none of the other EPC entities is affected, which means:
\- Interworking with networks not applying control and user plane separation
works as without it (i.e. in case of roaming scenarios);
\- Separated network entities can be deployed together with network entities
that are not separated within the same network;
\- Deployment of Separated network entities does not require any updates for
UE or Radio Access Network.
The following figure shows the architecture reference model in the case of
separation between control plane and user plane and covers non-roaming as well
as home routed and local breakout roaming scenarios. Only the complementary
aspects of the architecture reference models specified in TS 23.401 [2] clause
4.2 and TS 23.402 [4] clauses 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 for GTP-based interfaces are
shown in this figure.
Figure 12.1-1: Architecture reference model with separation of user plane and
control plane for non-roaming and roaming scenarios
NOTE 1: The -C or -U suffix appended to S2a, S2b, S5 and S8 reference points
refer to the control plane and user plane components of those interfaces.
NOTE 2: For S2a, S2b, S5 and S8 reference points, this architecture reference
model is only supported with GTP-based interfaces. PMIP-based interfaces and
S2c interface are not supported.
NOTE 3: The usage of a combined SGW/PGW documented in TS 23.401 [2] is also
possible in a deployment with separated control and user planes.
The protocol for Sxa, Sxb and Sxc is described in TS 29.244 [6]. The protocol
is a 3GPP owned protocol using UDP as transport. Restoration scenarios when an
PGW, SGW are split and one node failes are studied in TR 29.844 [9] and the
result is incorporated in TS 23.007 [7]. The CP function may select a UP
function using DNS server this is documented in TS 29.303 [8].

## Paging Policy Enhancements and Procedure
Summary based on the input provided by China Unicom in SP-170549.
* * *
710004 **Paging Policy Enhancements and Procedure** PPEPO_LTE 1 S1 SP-160113
* * *
This work item optimizes the paging policies as to reduce the paging
signalling caused both by M2M devices and by smart phones\' OTT (Over The Top)
applications.
These optimizations are based on:
a) the movement of a device, i.e. taking into account whether the UE is static
or moving;
b) the application characteristics, such as the application type, the
application protocol, the application provider, and the delay sensitivity;
c) the location of the UE within the paging area.
With these optimizations, the network will assess the parameters above as to
apply different paging policies.
Note that only Stage 1 has been defined for this feature (covered by CRs to
22.101, while the study is in the dedicated TR 22.838, \"Paging Policy
Enhancements and Procedure Optimizations in LTE\"). There is no impact on
Stage 2 nor on Stage 3 since the result of this feature is mostly a change of
behaviour of some network entities, and this is not covered by 3GPP.
## Shared Subscription Data Update
Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in CP-171050.
* * *
720001 **Shared Subscription Data Update** eSDU 1 C4 CP-160644
* * *
CT4 have developed protocol optimizations for the Diameter based S6a/d and MAP
based GR/D interfaces allowing (parts of) subscription data, which are shared
by multiple UEs (e.g. MTC-UEs), to be modified by means of administrative
actions without generating signalling floods on the interfaces between HSS/HLR
and serving nodes (MME/SGSN/VLR).
The mechanism follows the conclusion from TR 29.813 [1] and makes use of a
backward compatible extension of the reset mechanism. Instead of sending one
Insert/Delete-Subscriber-Data message per UE sharing the modified data, only
one extended Reset message per serving node is sent. Serving nodes supporting
the mechanism will update the stored subscription data for all the sharing UEs
while serving nodes not supporting the mechanism mark impacted UEs as \"not
confirmed\", resulting in updating the data at the next radio contact.

This work item updates 23.292 (IMS Centralized Services) to introduce optional
interworking functionality that enables networks supporting both ICS and IMS
to use only the IMS service domain (eliminating service logic and databases in
the CS domain); the feature addresses both the service logic execution and the
authentication of a network\'s own subscribers, and also the necessary
functionality to support roaming without requiring any functional support in
the other network.
In some networks, it is an overhead to maintain two separate service domains,
and ensure constancy of user experience when user devices move between the
domains either due to coverage, capacity, roaming, or service requirements.
This work item enhances the existing ICS capabilities and introduces two new
functional entities to the network that enable all the services of a
subscriber to be supported by only the IMS service domain. The new functional
entities that are introduced are a MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC and a ICS
interworking function (ICS IWF).
The MSC Server Enhanced for SeDoC is used in place of a MSC Server (or MSC
Server enhanced for ICS), and provides some of the same functions of these
systems; the most notable differences are:
\- Call control solely done in IMS (no CS services are supported)
\- No VLR functionality (since all services are now provided by the IMS
domain)
\- Mapping between CS procedures and IMS procedures for
\- Call control
\- Supplementary services management
\- Authentication and transport of encryption keys
\- Emergency Services
\- Support for SMS and location services typically provided by the MSC
The ICS IWF provides support for inbound and outbound roamers in networks that
do not support IMS or ICS such that the other network does not need any
support for IMS or ICS (including no support for SeDoC). For an outbound
roamer (i.e. a SeDoC subscriber), the ICS IWF maps the procedures between the
VPLMN and the HLR into IMS procedures. For an Inbound roamer, the ICS IWF maps
the procedures between the HPLMN and the MSC into IMS procedures. The ICS IWF
may be used independently from SeDoC to enhance ICS roaming scenarios.
The MSC Server Enhanced for SeDoC uses the IMS domain for authentication and
subscription management interacting with the HSS, a new procedure is
introduced to authenticate the subscriber and obtain the CS encryption keys.
In the roaming case, the ICS IWF function maps the parameters between IMS
authentication and MSC/HLR authentication procedures, presenting only the
MSC/HLR procedure to the roaming partner network. The subscriber\'s service
and authentication information is now only required in the HSS and any profile
in the HLR is no longer used (and may be eliminated).
To support Emergency Services via the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC, a
requirement that ICS use CS capabilities for emergency calling is relaxed,
allowing for IMS to provide the emergency services for the subscriber (as
already defined in TS 23.167[2]); accordingly, the ICS architectures are
updated to include the E-CSCF and references to the IMS procedures for
emergency services support using the IMS E-CSCF are added.

680002 **Control of Applications when Third party Servers encounter
difficulties** CATS 1 S1 SP-150273
* * *
When a third party server becomes congested or fails, the traffic from UE-
based applications that make use of that server needs to be controlled, so
that resulting unproductive use of 3GPP network resource is avoided/mitigated,
as not to affect other applications and their associated servers that are
functioning normally.
This WI is a set of service features to control traffic from UE-based
applications to the affected application(s) on the third party server(s) or
the third party server itself while not affecting other traffic.
It specifies service equirements to control traffic from UE-based applications
to the affected application(s) on the third party server(s) or the third party
server itself and identify the application or its associated traffic according
to operator policy. These requirements have been studied in TR 22.818 [1],
then introduced in TS 22.011 (CR #0209) [2].

The Work Item \"Sponsored data connectivity improvements\" (SDCI) is an
improvement of the Rel-10 Feature \"Policy Enhancements for Sponsored
Connectivity and Coherent Access to Policy related Databases\" (PEST).
\"Sponsored Connectivity\" relates to the context where the connectivity cost
is not paid by the end user but by a third party, the Sponsor, so it is seen
as \"free\" by the end user. The Sponsor has a business relationship with the
operator: he reimburses the operator for the user\'s data connectivity in
order to allow the user access to an associated Application Service
Provider\'s (ASP) services.
SDCI aims at solving the problem of heavy load occurred when too many
sponsored data related rules are transmitted via the Rx interface (between the
AF and the PCRF) and/or the Gx interface (between the PCRF and the PCEF/TDF),
as shown in the figure below.
SDCI introduces one new entity, the PFDF (Packet Flow Description Function)
and three new interfaces: Gw, Gwn, Nu.
The PFDF is used to store and manage the PFDs (Packet Flow Descriptions) and
charging rules for sponsored data services.
The new interfaces link the PFDF to existing entities, as shown in the figure
below. They enable the PFDs and the corresponding charging rules to be
provisioned dynamically to the PCEF and/or the TDF by PULL mode, PUSH mode, or
a combined mode. The PFDs and charging rules for sponsored services can be
stored in PCEF and/or PFDF according to implementation.
The following figure shows the SDCI entity and its related interfaces.

* * *
Thanks to this work item, the network capability exposure function can be
performed on a per-group basis. When dealing with a high number of UEs, such
as IoT devices, this reduces the signalling burden compared to a handling on a
per-UE basis.
It introduces in TS 23.682 the group handling of the following aspects:
\- Monitoring Event Configuration/Reporting via the HSS
\- Monitoring Event Configuration/Reporting via the PCRF
\- Communication Pattern Parameter Provisioning
A group identifier, called \"External Group ID\", is used by the SCS/AS
(Service Capability Server/Application Server) and the SCEF (Service
Capability Exposure Function) to identify the group of UEs.
The HSS or PCRF resolves the group ID to individual UE ID and continue to
process as individual procedure.
For the Monitoring Event Configuration/Reporting via the HSS, if the
Monitoring Request is for a group of UEs, the HSS includes the UE ID (which
can be understood by the SCS/AS) in the monitoring event configuration
parameter and sends an Insert Subscriber Data Request message per UE to all
the MME/SGSN(s) serving the members of the group.
When the HSS or the MME/SGSN detects the monitoring event, the UE ID is
included in the monitoring report message toward SCEF.
In order to reduce signalling for sending the event report of a number of
group members of UEs, the HSS or the SCEF aggregates received monitoring
report for the group member of UEs, and then send the aggregated report to the
SCS/AS. From this point of view, \"Group Reporting Guard Time\" is introduced
to indicate the time for which the monitoring event reporting detected by the
UEs in a group can be aggregated before sending them to the SCS/AS or the
SCEF.

both) that improve the operator control of a UE for the following features:
\- voice and SMS, where the UE uses EPS to access IMS;
\- voice and SMS and video, where the UE uses EPS to access IMS;
\- voice and SMS, where the UE uses EPC via WLAN to access IMS; and
\- voice and SMS and video, where the UE uses EPC via WLAN to access IMS.
Also in the context of this work item, a mechanism is defined to enable the
operator to provide to the UE, for several use cases, the maximum time between
sending of a SIP request and receiving a SIP response.

This WI makes cross-operator accounting possible between a Master Operator and
Participating Operator(s), based on the consumed data volume, using
statistical measurements when a RAN is shared. This solution is based on input
from WI **RAN Aspects of RAN Sharing Enhancements for LTE**.
This WI specifies:
\- Use cases and requirements for management of measurements for cross-
operator accounting based on data volume and QoS profiles.
\- Subscription of data volume measurements that can be filtered on uplink and
downlink QoS profiles (QCI, ARP and GBR) for cross-operator accounting.
\- Statistical measurements for data volume for cross-operator accounting
based on data volume and QoS profiles.
It is based on TR 32.817 on \"Study on management of measurement collection in
network sharing context\".
### OAM support for Licensed Shared Access (LSA)
Summary based on the input from Nokia in SP-171010.
* * *
720044 **OAM support for Licensed Shared Access (LSA)** OAM14-LSA 2 S5
SP-160397
* * *
LSA is a licensing method allowing spectrum owners (Incumbents) to share their
spectrum with Mobile Network Operators (LSA Licensees) according to a
regulatory framework (sharing framework) issued by a National Regulatory
Authority (NRA). This Work Item specifies a solution for the required OAM
support.
The LSA Architecture Reference Model is described in [7]. It is based on a LSA
Repository (LR) and LSA Controller (LC) with the LSA1 reference point between
them. The WI OAM support for Licensed Shared Access (LSA) provides
functionality for connecting the LC to the 3GPP Management System. Two
deployment scenarios are considered:
\- Deployment scenario 1: The LSA controller (LC) communicates LSA spectrum
resource availability information (LSRAI) received from the LR to the NM.
\- Deployment scenario 2: The LSA controller performs planning decisions (some
or all) based on the LSRAI received from the LR internally and communicates
the calculated constraints on configuration attributes (max TX power, allowed
down tilt range, allowed azimuth range, maximum antenna height, etc...) to the
NM.
For communication on the LSA1 reference point the Licensed Shared Access (LSA)
Controller (LC) Integration Reference Point (IRP) has been defined in [4], [5]
and [6].

This work item provides solutions for charging from SMS-SC, the SMS deliveries
using T4 (between MTC-IWF and SMS-SC) according to TS 23.682 \"Device
Triggering\" and \"MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4\" functionalities.
The Rel-11 SIMTC had the corresponding charging done under SIMTC-CH (although
re-using the Feature description SP-120848) with limited scope (e.g. Device
Trigger was not covered), and the charging SMS from MME was introduced.
The Rel-12 SMS-SC-CH (under CH2 Feature) introduced Offline charging from SMS-
SC and completed some charging aspects of Rel-11 SIMTC (Device trigger).
The Rel-14 CH14-SMST4:
\- covers some charging part of Rel-12 feature MTCe-SDDTE (Device trigger
replace/recall), but also introduces online charging for Device trigger.
\- covers the charging part of a Rel-14 stage 2 introduced under TEI14 (CR#

Network Relay.
This work item specifies the enhancement to the charging architecture,
triggers for online/offline charging events, the contents and formats of the
CDR and diameter application for enhanced ProSe services.
In TS 32.277 the charging principles, charging information, the triggers for
online and offline charging, the online and offline message flows for the
following scenarios were added.
\- ProSe Restricted Discovery
\- ProSe Direct Discovery in Model B
\- ProSe Direct Discovery for public safety use
\- ProSe one-to-one Communication
\- ProSe one-to-one Communication via UE-to-Network relay

## Extension of UE Delay test methods and requirements
Summary based on the input from Orange in SP-170345.
* * *
720028 **Extension of UE Delay test methods and requirements** EXT_UED 1 S4
SP-160600
* * *
This Work Item continues the work on terminal delay tests from previous
Releases, as shown below:
Rel-11: Introduction of terminal delay testing for UMTS/3G (Ext_ATS)
Rel-12: Extension of terminal delay testing in narrowband and wideband for LTE
(ART_LTE-UED)
Rel-13: Extension of terminal delay testing in super-wideband/fullband for LTE
(E_LTE_UED)
It extends the 3GPP acoustic test specifications (TS 26.131 and TS 26.132) to
support Voice over Wifi (VoWifi) acoustic terminal testing and enhance the
existing speech delay measurement. The following functionalities for MTSI-
based speech services are added:
â€¢ Support of acoustic testing for VoWifi radio access - this applies to all
acoustics tests (incl. delay tests).
â€¢ Specification of clock accuracy aspects (incl. a recommendation on terminal
clock skew in send direction).
â€¢ Addition of an optional test to characterize the behaviour of jitter buffer
management (JBM) in terminals, under more realistic conditions.
In addition, a new Technical Report (TR 26.954, \"Test plan for speech quality
and delay through a headset electrical interface\") has been produced to
provide guidance on testing of speech quality and delay through a terminal
headset electrical interface, including both analog and digital headset
interfaces. This TR includes test set-up configurations and measurement
scenarios, and it is expected to serve as a reference for terminal vendors and
Mobile Network Operators wishing to conduct such tests. It provides a unified
methodology for delay/quality tests over the electrical interface of mobile
terminals (e.g. headset jack or USB-C).
## Security Assurance Specification for 3GPP network products

S3 SP-150716 620262 Security Assurance Specification for 3GPP network product
classes SCAS-SA3 2 S3 SP-150716
* * *
This work item defines the security assurance requirements and the
corresponding test cases for network elements.
Prior to this work item, security stanardization in 3GPP was limited to the
interface definitions, focussing on interoperability. Many security issues in
real networks are not caused by the interface definitions, but by the network
elements themselves.
In particular, the following topics have been worked on:
\- a methodology to be followed when defining a security assurance
specification [1]
\- the threats that the security asurance specifications consider [2]
\- a catalogue of general security assurance requirements and corresponding
test cases [3]
\- security assurance specifications (so called SCAS), referring to the
general catalogue and introducing MME specific requirements and test cases,
for the following product classes
\- MME product class [4]
\- PGW product class [5]
With the security assurance specifications, it is possible to have
reproducable tests for security of network products which can be executed by
independent test labs. GSMA has taken this as input to define an
organiziational framework, the network equipment security assurance scheme,
cf. e.g. GSMA FS.13 [6].
