# 1 Scope
The present document specifies procedures and protocol elements for tunnelling
of IMS traffic over restrictive access networks, specifically procedures and

# 6 IP roles and IP based procedures
## 6.1 General
This subclause describes IP roles and IP based procedures.
## 6.2 IP roles
### 6.2.1 UE procedures
If IPv4 is supported, the UE shall support acting as host according to IETF
RFC 791  _[5]_.
If IPv6 is supported, the UE shall support acting as host according to IETF
RFC 2460  _[7]_.
### 6.2.2 EFTF procedures
If IPv4 is supported, the EFTF shall support acting as gateway according to
IETF RFC 791  _[5]_.
If IPv6 is supported, the EFTF shall support acting as router according to
IETF RFC 2460  _[7]_.
## 6.3 Inner IP address assignment procedure
### 6.3.1 UE procedures
If the UE has a network interface with a universally administered MAC address,
the UE shall use a universally administered MAC address of a network interface
of the UE as the UE FTT-IMS MAC address. If the UE does not have a network
interface with a universally administered MAC address, the UE shall use a
locally administered MAC address where the least significant bit of the last
octet is set to zero as the UE FTT-IMS MAC address.
If IPv4 is supported, the UE shall support acting as DHCPv4 client according
to IETF RFC 2131  _[6]_.
If IPv6 is supported, the UE shall support acting as host supporting the IPv6
_stateless address autoconfiguration_ according to IETF RFC 4862  _[11]_.
Once the FTT-IMS is established, the UE shall:
1) if the UE needs IPv4 connectivity, _request IPv4 address using DHCPv4_
according to IETF RFC 2131  _[6]. The UE shall use the htype, hlen, chaddr
according to_ the UE FTT-IMS MAC address _; and_
2) if the UE needs IPv6 connectivity, _generate IPv6 address using_ IPv6
_stateless address autoconfiguration_ according to IETF RFC 4862  _[11]. The
UE shall_ create a _link-local address according to_ IETF RFC 4291  _[10]
using_ the UE FTT-IMS MAC address _._
NOTE 1: Further IPv6 configuration can be done using stateless DHCPv6
according to IETF RFC 3736 [9].
NOTE 2: DHCPv4 uses IPv4 as transport; IPv6 _stateless address
autoconfiguration_ uses IPv6 as transport _and_ DHCPv6 uses IPv6 as transport.
Thus, the DHCPv4 messages, IPv6 _stateless address autoconfiguration_ messages
_and_ DHCPv6 messages are transported via the FTT-IMS using the IP packet
transport FTT-IMS procedure according to subclause 5.3.
### 6.3.2 EFTF procedures
If IPv4 is supported, the EFTF shall support acting as DHCPv4 server according
to IETF RFC 2131  _[6]_. When acting as DHCPv4 server, the EFTF shall handle
each existing FTT-IMS as a different subnet.
If the EFTF has a network interface with a universally administered MAC
address, the EFTF shall use a universally administered MAC address of a
network interface of the EFTF as the EFTF FTT-IMS MAC address. If the EFTF
does not have a network interface with a universally administered MAC address,
the EFTF shall use a locally administered MAC address where the least
significant bit of the last octet is set to one as the EFTF FTT-IMS MAC
address.
If IPv6 is supported, the EFTF shall support acting as router supporting the
IPv6 _stateless address autoconfiguration_ according to IETF RFC 4862  _[11].
The EFTF shall create a link-local address according to IETF_  _RFC_  _4291_
_[10] using the EFTF FTT-IMS MAC address._
# 7 PDUs and parameters
## 7.1 PDUs and parameters specific to FTT-IMS protocol
### 7.1.1 General
The least significant bit of a field is represented by the lowest numbered bit
of the highest numbered octet of the field. When the field extends over more
than one octet, the order of bit values progressively decreases as the octet
number increases.
Figure 7.1.1-1 shows an example of a field where the most significant bit of
the field is marked MSB and the least significant bit of the field is marked
LSB.
