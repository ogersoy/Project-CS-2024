identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines Management Object (MO) that is used to configure
the UE with parameters related to Application specific Congestion control for
Data Communication (ACDC) functionality.
The MO is compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM) protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA DM
Device Description Framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [3].
The MO consists of relevant parameters for provisioning of ACDC at a UE.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

ACDC Application specific Congestion control for Data Communication
# 4 ACDC MO
The ACDC MO is used to manage configuration parameters related to ACDC
functionality for a UE supporting provisioning of such information. The
presence and format of the ACDC configuration file on the USIM is specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [5].
The MO identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-ACDC-config:1.0.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism (see OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2
[3]) may be used to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to
modify nodes and leaf objects of the ACDC MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible in the ACDC MO as described
in figure 4.1.1 through figure 4.1.2:

restriction to access attempts. The lowest ranked ACDC category means the ACDC
category with the highest value and a UE treats applications assigned to the
lowest ranked ACDC category as the most restriction to access attempts.**

## 5.5 _\ _/Ext
The Ext is an interior node for where the vendor specific information about
the NAS configuration MO is being placed (vendor meaning application vendor,
device vendor etc.). Usually the vendor extension is identified by vendor
specific name under the ext node. The tree structure under the vendor
identifier is not defined and can therefore include one or more un-
standardized sub-trees.

This DDF is the standardized minimal set. A vendor can define its own DDF for
the complete device. This DDF can include more features than this minimal
standardized version.
