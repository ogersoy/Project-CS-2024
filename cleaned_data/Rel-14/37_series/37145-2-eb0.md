# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies radiated test methods and conformance
requirements for _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ , _single RAT UTRA operation_
(FDD and TDD) and Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) UTRA and E-UTRA Active Antenna
System (AAS) Base Station (BS). These have been derived from, and are
consistent with non-AAS BS specifications in TS 25.104 [2], TS 25.105 [3], TS
36.104 [4] or TS 37.104 [5]. The technical specification TS 37.145 is in 2
parts, part TS 37.145-1 [9] covers conducted requirements and part TS 37.145-2
(the present document) covers radiated requirements.
The present document does not establish radiated test methods and conformance
requirements for Band 46 operation as it is not supported by AAS BS. Conducted
Band 46 test requirements are still applicable for AAS BS for protection of
and against Band 46 operation, as specified in TS 37.145-1 [9].

# 4 General test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 2 of
this specification, i.e. to all AAS BS radiated tests.
The minimum requirements for AAS BS radiated requirements are given in TS
37.105 [14] clause 9 and 10 for the radiated transmitter and radiated receiver
characteristics, respectively. Test Tolerances for the radiated test
requirements explicitly stated in part 2 of the present specification are
given in annex C of this specification.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances
are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
#### 4.1.2.1 General
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where appropriate.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the performance of a
population of test equipment.

## 4.12 RF channels and test models
### 4.12.1 RF channels
For single carrier tests unless otherwise stated the tests shall be performed
with a single carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.
Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum radiated _Base Station RF
Bandwidth_ located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency
range in the operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~
(middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).
\- Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ defined as following:
\- B~RFBW~: maximum _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.
\- M~RFBW~: maximum _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band. M~RFBW~ may be shifted
maximum 100 kHz towards lower frequencies to align carriers with the channel
raster.
\- T~RFBW~: maximum _Base Station RF Bandwidth_ located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.
For the test of certain RF requirements the present specification refers to
test procedures defined in the single-RAT specifications [2], [3], [4], [5].
In this case, the interpretation of the RF channels to be tested shall be
according to the definitions in the corresponding single-RAT specifications
[2], [3], [4], [5].
For an operating band which has multi-band beam dependencies capable of dual-
band operation, unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at
B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ defined as following:
\- B~RFBW~_ T\'~RFBW~: the _Base Station RF Bandwidths_ located at the bottom
of the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and at the
highest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum _Radio
Bandwidth_ , in the upper operating band.
\- B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW:~ the _Base Station RF Bandwidths_ located at the top of
the supported frequency range in the upper operating band and at the lowest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum _Radio Bandwidth_
, in the lower operating band.
NOTE: B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ when the
declared maximum radiated _Radio Bandwidth_ (see table 4.10-1, D9.17) spans
both operating bands. B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ means the _Base Station RF Bandwidths_
are located at the bottom of the supported frequency range in the lower
operating band and at the top of the supported frequency range in the upper
operating band.
When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B~RFBW~,
M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in each supported operating band, the position of
B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in the supported operating band
combinations shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may consult
with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

**X Title**
All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the present
document, unless otherwise stated.
**X.1 Definition and applicability**
This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under consideration
and specifies whether the test is applicable to all equipment or only to a
certain subset. Required manufacturer declarations may be included here.
**X.2 Minimum requirement**
This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference (or
core) specification which defines the minimum requirement. For each
requirement, there are separate references for MSR and single RAT, where
applicable in the core requirement. If the requirement does not apply to a
particular RAT, this is explicitly stated here (rather than through a
reference).
**X.3 Test purpose**
This clause defines the purpose of the test.
**X.4 Method of test**
**X.4.1 General**
In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial conditions. In
such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and test procedures can be
applied are stated here. In the case only one test procedure is applicable,
that is stated here.
**X.4.2y First test method**
**X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions**
This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the test
environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement set-up.
The test system is assumed to be correctly calibrated as part of the initial
conditions. Calibration is not explicitly mentioned.
**X.4.2y.2 Procedure**
This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and provides
further details of the test definition like point of access (e.g. test port),
domain (e.g. frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and
algorithms (e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise data processing of the
measurement result before comparison with the test requirement (e.g. average
result from several measurement positions).
**X.4.3y Alternative test method (if any)**
If there are alternative test methods, each is described with its initial
conditions and procedures.
**X.5 Test requirement**
This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test, see
clause 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results. Test requirements for
every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are listed here. Cases where
minimum requirements do not apply need not be mentioned.
The test requirements may be different depending on the test method applied. A
test requirement for each test method applicable to the respective MSR/Single
RAT requirement is given in separate clauses where applicable.
## 4.14 Reference coordinate system
Radiated requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic characteristics
(e.g. EIRP and EIS) at certain angles with respect to the base station. To be
able to declare radiated characteristics part of radiated requirements a
reference coordinate system is required. The reference coordinate system is
should be associated to an identifiable physical feature on the base station
enclosure.. The location of the origin and the orientation of the reference
coordinate system are for the base station manufacturer to declare.
The reference coordinate system is created of a Cartesian coordinate system
with rectangular axis (x** _,_** y** _,_** z) and spherical angles (Î¸, Ï†) as
showed in figure 4.14-1.
{width="3.933333333333333in" height="4.066666666666666in"}
Figure 4.14-1: Reference coordinate system
Ï†** __** is the angle in the x/y plane, between the x-axis and the projection
of the radiating vector onto the x/y plane and is defined between -180Â° and
+180Â°, inclusive. Î¸** _*** is the angle between the projection of the vector
in the x_** /***y plane and the radiating vector and is defined between -90Â°
and +90Â°, inclusive. Note that Î¸ is defined as positive along the down-tilt

# 6 Radiated transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configuration for testing. AAS BS
configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.8.
If beams have been declared equivalent and parallel (see table 4.10-1, D9.12,
D9.13), only a representative beam is necessary to be tested to demonstrate
conformance.
Any radiated transmitter test requirement specified in TS 37.105 [6] is not
applicable for AAS BS operation in Band 46.
## 6.2 Radiated Transmit Power
### 6.2.1 Definition and applicability
An AAS BS is declared to support one or more beams. Radiated transmit power is
defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam at a specific _beam peak
direction_.
For each beam, the requirement is based on declarations (see table 4.10-1) of
a beam identifier (D9.3), _reference beam direction pair_ (D9.7), _rated beam
EIRP_ (D9.10) at the _reference beam direction pair_ , _EIRP accuracy
directions set_ (D9.8), the _beam direction pairs_ at the maximum steering
directions (D9.9) and their associated _rated beam EIRP_ and _beamwidth(s)_
(D9.11) for _reference beam direction pair_ and maximum steering directions.
For a declared beam identifier and _beam direction pair_ , the _rated beam
EIRP_ level is the maximum power that the base station is declared to radiate
at the associated _beam peak direction_ during the _transmitter ON period_.
For each _beam peak direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within
the _EIRP accuracy directions set_ , a specific _rated beam EIRP_ level may be
claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy requirement as
described below. _Rated beam EIRP_ is only required to be declared for the
_beam direction pairs_ subject to conformance testing as detailed in clause
6.2.4.1.
NOTE 1: The _EIRP accuracy directions set_ for a beam is the complete
continuous or discrete set of all _beam direction_ for which the EIRP accuracy
is intended to be achieved for the beam.
NOTE 2: A _beam direction pair_ consists of a _beam centre direction_ and an
associated _beam peak direction_.
NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer for
verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the manufacturer to
the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment and is not subject to
formal conformance testing.
### 6.2.2 Minimum Requirement
For AAS BS in _MSR operation_ the minimum requirement is in TS 37.105 [6],
clause 9.2.2.
For AAS BS in _single RAT UTRA operation_ the minimum requirement is in TS
37.105 [6], clause 9.2.3.
For AAS BS in _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ the minimum requirement is in TS
37.105 [6], clause 9.2.4.
### 6.2.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability to accurately generate and direct
radiated power per beam, across the frequency range and under normal
conditions, for all declared beams of the AAS BS.
### 6.2.4 Method of test
#### 6.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal; see TS 37.145-1 [9], clause B.2.
RF bandwidth positions to be tested: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-
band operation, see clause 4.12.1.
B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see clause
4.12.1.
Directions to be tested: The reference beam direction pair (see table 4.10-1,
D9.7) and the maximum steering directions (see table 4.10-1, D9.9).
#### 6.2.4.2 Procedure
OTA test requires correct use of an appropriate test facility which has been
calibrated and is capable of performing measurements within the measurement
uncertainties in clause 4.1.2.
1) Place the AAS BS at the positioner.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see table
4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.
3) Move the AAS BS on the positioner in order that the direction to be tested
aligns with the test antenna.
4) Configure the beam peak direction of the AAS BS according to the declared
beam direction pair.
5) Set the base station to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test model(s) in clause
4.12.2.
In addition, for an AAS BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation use the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power
setting specified in clause 4.11.
6) Measure EIRP by either a) or b) below:
a) If the test facility only supports single polarization, then measure EIRP
with the test facility\'s test antenna/probe polarization matched to the AAS
BS.
b) If the test facility supports dual polarization then measure total EIRP for
two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total radiated
transmit power for particular _beam direction pair_ as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ +
EIRP~p2~.
7) Test steps 3 to 6 are repeated for all declared beams (see table 4.10-1,
D9.3) and their reference _beam direction pairs_ and _maximum steering
directions_ (see table 4.10-1, D9.7 and D9.11).
For multi-band capable AAS BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carriers activated in the other band.
### 6.2.5 Test Requirement
For each declared conformance beam direction pair, in normal conditions, the
EIRP measurement result in step 6 of clause 6.2.4.2 shall for UTRA and E-UTRA
remain:
\- within +3.2 dB and --3.2 dB of the manufacturer\'s declared rated beam EIRP
value for carrier frequency f â‰¤ 3.0 GHz;
\- within +3.4 dB and --3.4 dB of the manufacturer\'s declared rated beam EIRP
value for carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \< f â‰¤ 4.2 GHz.
# 7 Radiated receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
OTA receiver characteristics requirements apply to the _AAS BS_ including all
its functional components active unless otherwise stated in each requirement.
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 7 apply during the AAS BS
_receive period._
The requirements in clause 7 shall be met for any transmitter setting.
The (E-UTRA) throughput requirements defined for the receiver characteristics
in this clause do not assume HARQ retransmissions.
When the AAS BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the throughput
requirements are applicable for each received carrier.
Any radiated receiver test requirement specified in TS 37.105 [6] is not
applicable for AAS BS operation in Band 46.
## 7.2 OTA sensitivity
### 7.2.1 Definition and applicability
The OTA sensitivity requirement is based upon the declaration of one or more
_OTA sensitivity direction declarations_ (OSDD), related to an _AAS BS
receiver_.
The _AAS BS receiver_ may optionally be capable of redirecting/changing the
_receiver target_ by means of adjusting BS settings resulting in multiple
_sensitivity RoAoA_. The _sensitivity RoAoA_ resulting from the current AAS BS
settings is the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
If the AAS BS is capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the
OSDD then the OSDD shall include:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _Channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to any active _sensitivity RoAoA_ inside the _receiver target
redirection range_ in the OSDD.
\- A declared _receiver target redirection range_ , describing all the angles
of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative settings in
the _AAS BS_.
\- Five declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in [7].
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 1: Some of the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ may coincide depending on the
redirection capability.
NOTE 2: In addition to the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ , several _sensitivity
RoAoA_ may be implicitly defined by the _receiver target redirection range_
without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.
NOTE 3: (Void)
If the _AAS BS_ is not capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to
the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _Channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to the _sensitivity RoAoA_ in the OSDD.
\- One declared active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 4: For _AAS BS_ without target redirection capability, the declared
(fixed) _sensitivity RoAoA_ is always the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 7.2.2 Minimum Requirement
For AAS BS in _single RAT UTRA operation_ the minimum requirement is in TS
37.105 [6], clause 10.2.3.
For AAS BS in _single RAT E-UTRA operation_ the minimum requirement is in TS
37.105 [6], clause 10.2.4.
### 7.2.3 Test Purpose
The test purpose is to verify that the AAS BS can meet the BER or throughput
requirement for a specified measurement channel at the EIS level and the range
of angles of arrival declared in the OSDD.
### 7.2.4 Method of test
#### 7.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment:
\- Normal: see TS 37.145-1 [9], annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested:
\- B, M and T; see clause 4.12.1.
Directions to be tested:
\- _receiver target reference direction_ (see table 4.10-1, D10.9),
\- conformance test directions (see table 4.10-1, D10.10).
#### 7.2.4.2 Procedure
OTA test requires correct use of an appropriate test facility which has been
calibrated and is capable of performing measurements within the measurement
uncertainties in clause 4.1.2.
1) Place the AAS BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system reference
point in the same place as calibrated point in the test system, as shown in
annex D1.1.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the AAS BS
with the test system.
3) Set the AAS BS in the declared direction to be tested.
4) Ensure the polarisation is accounted for such that all the power from the
test antenna is captured by the AAS BS under test.
5) Configure the beam peak direction of the AAS BS according to declared
reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam identifier.
6) Set the AAS BS to transmit the beam(s) of the same operational band and RAT
as the OSDD being tested according to the appropriate test configuration in
clause 5.
7) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:
\- 12.2 kbps DPCH with reference measurement channel defined in annex A in TS
25.141 [10] (PN-9 data sequence or longer) for UTRA FDD.
\- UL reference measurement channel (12.2 kbps) defined in annex A.2.1 in TS
25.142 [11] for UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps operation.
\- The test signal as specified in clause 7.2.5.4 for E-UTRA.
8) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at the AAS
BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified in clause
7.2.5.
9) Measure:
\- BER according to annex C in TS 25.141 [10] for FDD UTRA.
\- BER according to annex F in TS 25.142 [11] for TDD UTRA.
\- Throughput according to annex E in TS 36.141 [12] for E-UTRA.
10) Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all OSDD(s) declared for the AAS BS (see table
4.10-1, D10.1).
For multi-band capable AAS BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carriers activated in the other band.
### 7.2.5 Test Requirements
#### 7.2.5.1 General

###### ## Annex A (normative): Test system characterization
The radiated measurement methods for AAS BS conformance testing were described
in TR 37.842 [7], including descriptions of their limitations and testing
applicability.
###### ## Annex B (normative): Calibration
The radiated measurement methods for AAS BS conformance testing were described
in TR 37.842 [7]. Calibration stage description was covered for each of the
identified Test Systems in the measurement\'s procedure description, which
covered two distinct stages: calibration stage and measurement stage. This has
been separately covered for transmitter and for receiver requirements.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Test tolerances and derivation of test
requirements
# C.1 General
The test requirements explicitly defined in this specification have been
calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification
using the Test Tolerances defined here. When the Test Tolerance is non-zero,
the test requirements will differ from the minimum requirements, and the
formula used for this relaxation is given in the following tables.
The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties.
The Test Tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account
of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).
Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all tests.
NOTE: OTA test requirements for AAS BS are specified for Normal conditions,
only.

###### ## Annex E (normative): Estimation of Measurement Uncertainty
# E.1 General
Common measurement uncertainty budget calculation principle, was described in
TR 37.842 [7].
# E.2 Measurement methodology descriptions
The AAS BS radiated measurement method descriptions, including description of
the calibration stage, and the measurement stage, are described separately for
each of the OTA tests, i.e. for radiated transmit power and for OTA
sensitivity test in TR 37.842 [7].

will need to be modified, depending on the transmitter, or receiver test.
Therefore, separate uncertainty budget format were collected for all
considered Test Systems in TR 37.842 [7], specifying uncertainty contributors
for calibration stage, as well as measurement stage.

Descriptions of uncertainty assessment for radiated transmit power and for OTA
sensitivity test were described separately for each of the considered Tests
Systems as in TR 37.842 [7].
