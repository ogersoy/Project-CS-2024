# 4 General test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification.
The minimum requirements are given in TS 37.104 [2] and the references
therein. Test requirements are given in this specification or are included by
reference to TS 25.141 [10], TS 25.142 [12], TS 36.141 [9] or TS 51.021 [11].
Test Tolerances for the test requirements explicitly stated in the present
specification are defined in Annex C of this specification. Test Tolerances
for test requirements included by reference are defined in the respective
referred test specification.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances
are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in Annex C.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where appropriate.
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for test requirements
included by reference is defined in the respective referred test
specification.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in subclause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.
Unless otherwise stated, the uncertainties in subclause 4.1.2 apply to the
Test System for testing E-UTRA, UTRA, GSM/EDGE and NB-IoT MSR BS.

other starting from the high Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. The nominal
carrier spacing defined in subclause 4.5.1 shall apply.

## 4.9 RF channels and test models
### 4.9.1 RF channels
Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth
located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency range in the
operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and
T~RFBW~ (top).
Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and
T~RFBW~ defined as following:
B~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.
M~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band. M~RFBW~ may be shifted
maximum 100 kHz towards lower frequencies to align carriers with the channel
raster.
T~RFBW~: maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth located at the top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band.
For the test of certain RF requirements the present specification refers to
test procedures defined in the single-RAT specifications. In this case, the
interpretation of the RF channels to be tested shall be according to the
definitions in the corresponding single-RAT specifications.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, unless otherwise stated, the test
shall be performed at B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ defined as
following:
\- B~RFBW~_ T'~RFBW~: the Base Station RF Bandwidths located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in the lowest operating band and at the highest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum Radio Bandwidth,
in the highest operating band. The Base Station RF Bandwidth(s) are located at
the bottom of the supported frequency range(s) in the middle band(s).
\- B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW:~ the Base Station RF Bandwidths located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the highestoperating band and at the lowest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum Radio Bandwidth,
in the lowest operating band. The Base Station RF Bandwidth(s) are located at
the top of the supported frequency range(s) in the middle band(s).
NOTE: B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ = B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ when the declared
Maximum Radio Bandwidth spans all operating bands. B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ means the
Base Station RF Bandwidths are located at the bottom of the supported
frequency range in the lowest operating band and at the top of the supported
frequency range in the highest operating band, and the Base Station RF
Bandwidth(s) are located at the bottom of the supported frequency range(s) in
the middle band(s) in the first test and then at the top of the supported
frequency range(s) in the middle band(s) in the second test.
When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B~RFBW~,
M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in each supported operating band, the position of
B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in the supported operating band
combinations shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory may consult
with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

Table 6.2A, Table 6.39A, Table 6.39B, Table 6.39C, Table 6.39D, Table 6.40A,
Table 6.40B, Table 6.41A, Table 6.41B as defined in TS 25.142 [12] subclause
6.3.4, 6.8.1, 6.8.2 and 6.8.3 whilst any remaining carriers from other RAT(s)
shall be configured according to a).
\- For the case that modulation accuracy is measured for E-UTRA, the E-UTRA

For the test of certain RF requirements clause 5 refers to the test
configurations as defined in the single-RAT specifications. In this case, the
transmitter test signals and test models as defined within the referred test
specification for the RF requirement shall be used.
## 4.10 BS configurations
### 4.10.1 Transmit configurations
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics in clause 6 are
specified at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any
external apparatus such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test
port B).
Figure 4.10.1-1: Transmitter test ports
#### 4.10.1.1 Transmission with multiple transmitter antenna connectors
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present document,
the requirement applies for each transmitter antenna connector in the case of
transmission with multiple transmitter antenna connectors.
Transmitter requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the
remaining antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the transmitter paths to be equivalent, it is sufficient to measure
the signal at any one of the transmitter antenna connectors.
### 4.10.2 Receive configurations
Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics in clause 7 are
specified at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any
external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such
devices is used, requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test
port B).
Figure 4.10.2-1: Receiver test ports
#### 4.10.2.1 Reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors, receiver
diversity
For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement applies at
each receiver antenna connector for receivers with antenna diversity or in the
case of multi-carrier reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors.
Receiver requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the remaining
receiver(s) disabled or their antenna connector (s) being terminated. If the
manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be equivalent, it is
sufficient to apply the specified test signal at any one of the receiver
antenna connectors.
For a multi-band BS, multi-band tests for blocking and intermodulation are
performed with the interferer(s) applied to each antenna connector mapped to
the receiver for the wanted signal(s), however only to one antenna at a time.
Antenna connectors to which no signals are applied are terminated.
### 4.10.3 Duplexers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer fitted,
if a duplexer is supplied as part of the BS.
NOTE: The present release of this specification does not contain test
requirements for the case that the duplexer is supplied as an option by the
manufacturer. This is left for future releases.
### 4.10.4 Power supply options
If the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply configurations,
it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each of the power supply
options, provided that it can be demonstrated that the range of conditions
over which the equipment is tested is at least as great as the range of
conditions due to any of the power supply configurations.
This applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be supplied
either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In this case, the
conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power supply options can be
tested by testing only the external DC supply option. The range of DC input
voltages for the test should be sufficient to verify the performance with any
of the power supplies, over its range of operating conditions within the BS,
including variation of mains input voltage, temperature and output current.
### 4.10.5 Ancillary RF amplifiers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with the ancillary RF
amplifier fitted. At tests according to clauses 6 and 7 for TX and RX
respectively, the ancillary amplifier is connected to the BS by a connecting
network (including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with applicable loss to
make sure the appropriate operating conditions of the ancillary amplifier and
the BS. The applicable connecting network loss range is declared by the
manufacturer. Other characteristics and the temperature dependence of the
attenuation of the connecting network are neglected. The actual attenuation
value of the connecting network is chosen for each test as one of the
applicable extreme values. The lowest value is used unless otherwise stated.
Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted and,
if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify that the BS
meets the requirements of the present document in both cases.
When testing, the following tests shall be repeated with the optional
ancillary amplifier fitted according to Table 4.10.5-1, where x denotes that
the test is applicable:
Table 4.10.5-1: Tests applicable to ancillary RF Amplifiers
* * *
Receiver Tests Subclause TX amplifier only RX amplifier only TX/RX amplifiers

Transmitter Tests 6.2 x X 6.6.1 X X 6.6.2 X x 6.6.3 X x 6.6.4 x X 6.7 x X
* * *
NOTE: Combining can be by duplex filters or any other network. The amplifiers
can either be in RX or TX branch or in both. Either one of these amplifiers
could be a passive network.
In test according to subclauses 6.2 and 7.2 highest applicable attenuation
value is applied.
### 4.10.6 BS with integrated Iuant BS modem
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the integrated
Iuant BS modem shall be switched off. Spurious emissions according to clauses
6.6.4 and 7.7 shall be measured only for frequencies above 20MHz with the
integrated Iuant BS modem switched on.
### 4.10.7 BS using antenna arrays
A BS may be configured with a multiple antenna port connection for some or all
of its transceivers or with an antenna array related to one cell (not one
array per transceiver). This subclause applies to a BS which meets at least
one of the following conditions:
\- the transmitter output signals from one or more transceiver appear at more
than one antenna port; or
\- there is more than one receiver antenna port for a transceiver or per cell
and an input signal is required at more than one port for the correct
operation of the receiver thus the outputs from the transmitters as well as
the inputs to the receivers are directly connected to several antennas (known
as \"aircombining\"); or
\- transmitters and receivers are connected via duplexers to more than one
antenna.
In case of diversity or spatial multiplexing, multiple antennas are not
considered as an antenna array.
If a BS is used, in normal operation, in conjunction with an antenna system
which contains filters or active elements which are necessary to meet the BS
requirements, the conformance tests may be performed on a system comprising
the BS together with these elements, supplied separately for the purposes of
testing. In this case, it must be demonstrated that the performance of the
configuration under test is representative of the system in normal operation,
and the conformance assessment is only applicable when the BS is used with the
antenna system.
For conformance testing of such a BS, the following procedure may be used.
#### 4.10.7.1 Receiver tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the receiver antenna connectors
shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied equals the
power of the test signal(s) specified in the test.
An example of a suitable test configuration is shown in figure 4.10.7.1-1.
Figure 4.10.7.1-1: Receiver test set-up
For spurious emissions from the receiver antenna connector, the test may be
performed separately for each receiver antenna connector.
#### 4.10.7.2 Transmitter tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the transmitter antenna connectors
(Pi) shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied equals
the power of the test signal(s) (Ps) specified in the test. This may be
assessed by separately measuring the signals emitted by each antenna connector
and summing the results, or by combining the signals and performing a single
measurement. The characteristics (e.g. amplitude and phase) of the combining
network should be such that the power of the combined signal is maximised.
An example of a suitable test configuration is shown in figure 4.10.7.2-1.
Figure 4.10.7.2-1: Transmitter test set-up
For Intermodulation attenuation, the test may be performed separately for each
transmitter antenna connector.
## 4.11 Format and interpretation of tests
Each test in the following clauses has a standard format:
**X Title**
All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the present
document, unless otherwise stated.
**X.1 Definition and applicability**
This subclause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all equipment or
only to a certain subset. Required manufacturer declarations may be included
here.
**X.2 Minimum requirement**
This subclause contains the reference to the subclause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement.
**X.3 Test purpose**
This subclause defines the purpose of the test.
**X.4 Method of test**
**X.4.1 Initial conditions**
This subclause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement set-
up. For the test of certain RF requirements the present specification refers
to the test method of the single-RAT specifications. In this case, the initial
conditions as defined within the referred test specification for the RF
requirement shall be used.
**X.4.2 Procedure**
This subclause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and provides
further details of the test definition like point of access (e.g. test port),
domain (e.g. frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and
algorithms (e.g. averaging). For the test of certain RF requirements the
present specification refers to the test method of the single-RAT
specifications. In this case, the test procedure as defined within the
referred test specification for the RF requirement shall be used.
**X.5 Test requirement**
This subclause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test.
See subclause 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results. For the test of
certain RF requirements the present specification refers to the requirements
of the single-RAT specifications. In this case, the test requirement as
defined within the referred test specification for the RF requirement shall be
used.
## 4.12 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in clause 6 and 7
apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated. For some
requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or exclusions to
the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band operation. In the case of
multiband operation of a BS, single-RAT operation and the corresponding
applicability of the requirements for each operating band is determined based
on the RAT configuration within only that operating band, unless otherwise
stated.For BS capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations (multi-band
or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more antenna port(s) in
different ways are possible. [In the case where multiple bands are mapped on
an antenna connector, the exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS
are applicable to this antenna connector.]{.underline} In the case where a
single band is mapped on an antenna connector, the following applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, operating band unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to this antenna connector that is mapped to single-band.
\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band requirements
shall apply to this antenna connector configured for single-band operation and
no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are applicable. Single-
band requirements are tested separately at the antenna connector configured
for single-band operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.
For a band supported by a Base Station where the transmitted carriers are not
processed in active RF components together with carriers in any other band,
single-band transmitter requirements shall apply. For a band supported by a
Base Station where the received carriers are not processed in active RF
components together with carriers in any other band, single-band receiver
requirements shall apply.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation supporting BC3 bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume synchronized operation, where
no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the bands.
The RF requirements in the present specification are FFS for multi-band
operation supporting bands for both FDD and TDD.

using the following principles:
1) The supported multi-band combination covering the widest radio bandwidth
should be tested.
2) Among the remaining supported multi-band combinations, the following ones
should also be tested:
\- Those with a larger rated total output power (per band or per band
combination).
\- Those with a larger total number of supported carriers (per band or per
band combination).
\- Those with a larger Maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth (per band).
# 5 Applicability of requirements and test configurations

each supported operating band of the MSR Base Station and the Band Category of
the declared operating band (BC1, BC2 or BC3), as listed in the heading of
each table. Some RF requirements listed in the tables may not be mandatory or
they may apply only regionally. This is further specified for each requirement
in clause 6 and 7, and in Table 4.3-1.
For a declared RAT Capability Set (CS) in Table 5.1-1, 5.1-1a, 5.1-1b and
5.2-1, only the requirements listed in the column for that CS apply.
Requirements listed under CS other than the declared CS(s) need not be tested.
For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous operation only, the test
configuration(s) in Tables 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 denoted by a "C" and entries that
refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used for testing.
For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous operation and
where the parameters in the manufacture's declaration according to subclause

subgroup in case of CS7), the test configuration(s) in Table 5.1-1 and 5.2-1
denoted by "CNC" and entries that refer to single-RAT specifications shall be
used.
For a BS declared to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous operation and
where the parameters in the manufacture's declaration according to subclause

For some of the RF test requirements entries within Tables 5.1-1 and 5.2-1
refer to the single-RAT specifications; this is denoted by \"(TS 25.141)\",
\"(TS 25.142)\", \"(TS 36.141)\" or \"(TS 51.021)\". In this case the
following shall apply:
\- transmitter test signals and test models as defined within the referred

# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. BS
configurations for the tests are defined in subclause 4.10.
Unless otherwise stated, a BS declared to be capable of E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-
band or guard band operations (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA) is
only required to pass the transmitter tests for E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-band or
guard band (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA); it is not required to
perform the transmitter tests again for E-UTRA only (or any combination with
GSM and/or UTRA).
Unless otherwise stated, a BS declared to be capable of E-UTRA with NB-IoT in-
band and guard band operations (or any combination with GSM and/or UTRA) needs
only to pass the transmitter tests for E-UTRA with guard band operation (or
any combination with GSM and/or UTRA).
## 6.2 Base Station output power
### 6.2.1 Base Station maximum output power
#### 6.2.1.1 Definition and applicability
Output power of the Base Station is the mean power delivered to a load with
resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the transmitter.
The maximum total output power, P~max~, of the Base Station is the mean power
level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period in a
specified reference condition.
The maximum RAT output power, P~max,RAT~, of the Base Station is the mean
power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period
for a specific RAT in a specified reference condition.
The maximum carrier output power, P~max,c~ of the Base Station is the mean
power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period
for a specific carrier in a specified reference condition.
The rated carrier output power, P~Rated,c~, of the base station is the mean
power level for a specific carrier that the manufacturer has declared to be
available at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON period.
In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may apply
also for some conditions outside the ranges defined for the Normal test
environment in Annex B.
The rated carrier output power of the BS shall be as specified in Table 6.2-1.
Table 6.2-1: Base Station rated carrier output power
BS class P~Rated,c~
* * *
Wide Area BS (note) Medium Range BS â‰¤+ 38 dBm Local Area BS â‰¤+ 24 dBm NOTE:
There is no upper limit for the rated carrier output power of the Wide Area
Base Station.
#### 6.2.1.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 6.2.1.
#### 6.2.1.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the accuracy of the maximum carrier output power
across the frequency range and under normal and extreme conditions for all
transmitters in the BS.
#### 6.2.1.4 Method of test
##### 6.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex B.2.
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~
in single-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1; B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and
B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1.
In addition, a single test shall be performed under extreme power supply
conditions as defined in Annex B.5. In this case, it is sufficient to test on
a single combination of one ARFCN, UARFCN or E-ARFCN, one Base Station RF
Bandwidth position and with only one applicable test configuration defined in
clause 5.
NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply also test extreme temperature.
Connect the power measuring equipment to the MSR Base Station antenna
connector as shown in Annex D.1.1.
##### 6.2.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the Base Station to transmit at maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in subclause 4.9.2.
2) Measure the mean power for each carrier at the Base Station antenna
connector.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
3) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of SBT or MBT shall be terminated.
#### 6.2.1.5 Test requirements
In normal conditions, the measurement result in step 2 of subclause 6.2.1.4.2
shall for UTRA and E-UTRA remain:
within +2.7 dB and --2.7 dB of the manufacturer\'s rated carrier output power
for carrier frequency f â‰¤ 3.0 GHz,
within +3.0 dB and --3.0 dB of the manufacturer\'s rated output power for
carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \ 3) Detection mode: True RMS.
##### 6.6.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the Base Station to transmit at maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in subclause 4.9.2.
2) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed the
specified value.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
4) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of SBT or MBT shall be terminated.
#### 6.6.1.5 Test requirements
The measurement result in step 2 of 6.6.1.4.2 shall not exceed the maximum
level specified in Table 6.6.1.5.1-1 to Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 if applicable for
the BS under test.
The test requirements of either subclause 6.6.1.5.1 (Category A limits) or
subclause 6.6.1.5.2 (Category B limits) shall apply. In addition for a BS
operating in Band Category 2, the test requirements of 6.6.1.5.3 shall apply
in case of Category B limits.
##### 6.6.1.5.1 Spurious emissions (Category A)
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table
6.6.1.5.1-1

##### 6.6.1.5.4 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS
This requirement shall be applied for FDD operation in order to prevent the
receivers of Base Stations being desensitised by emissions from the BS
transmitter. It is measured at the transmit antenna port for any type of BS
which has common or separate Tx/Rx antenna ports.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in Table
6.6.1.5.4-1, depending on the declared Base Station class and Band Category.

Note 1: For E-UTRA Band 28 BS operating in regions where Band 28 is only
partially allocated for E-UTRA operations, this requirement only apllies in
the UL frequency range of the partial allocation.
##### 6.6.1.5.5 Additional spurious emission requirements
These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band. The limits may
apply as an optional protection of such systems that are deployed in the same
geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating band. It is in some
cases not stated in the present document whether a requirement is mandatory or
under what exact circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by
local or regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the
present document is given in subclause 4.4.
Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS
and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE, CDMA, UTRA,
E-UTRA, etc.) as listed below. The power of any spurious emission shall not
exceed the limits of Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 for a BS where requirements for co-
existence with the system listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of
multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of
Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.1.5.5-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS operating in
Band 25, Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence requirements in Table
6.6.1.5.5-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside
the downlink operating band (see Tables 4.4-1 and 4.4-2). Emission limits for
this excluded frequency range may be covered by local or regional
requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.1.5.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 4.4-1 or Table 4.4-2 would be overlapping, are not
deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-
existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III or E-UTRA Band 3 in
China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection requirements
are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz respectively.
NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that are
synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can transmit without
additional co-existence requirements. For unsynchronized base stations(except
in Band 46), special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered
by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 6: For Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL operating
band.
NOTE 7: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or E-UTRA
Band 12 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band.
The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between 10 MHz
below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating band and
10 MHz above the highest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink operating
band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

1884.5 â€‘ 1915.7 MHz -41 dBm 300 kHz Applicable for co-existence with PHS
system operating in 1884.5-1915.7MHz NOTE: The requirement is not applicable
in China.
The following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 41 in
certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range
from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to
10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:
Table 6.6.1.5.5-3: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 41
Frequency range Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note
* * *
2505MHz -- 2535MHz -42dBm 1 MHz  
2535MHz -- 2655MHz -22dBm 1 MHz Applicable at offsets â‰¥ 250% of channel
bandwidth from carrier frequency NOTE: This requirement applies for 10 or 20
MHz E-UTRA carriers allocated within 2545-2575MHz or 2595-2645MHz.
In addition to the requirements in subclauses 6.6.1.5.1 to 6.6.1.5.4 and above
in the present subclause, the BS may have to comply with the applicable
emission limits established by FCC Title 47 [8], when deployed in regions
where those limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the
manufacturer.
The following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band 30 in certain
regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency range from 10
MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz
above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:
Table 6.6.1.5.5-4: Additional BS Spurious emissions limits for Band 30
Frequency range Maximum Level Measurement Bandwidth Note
* * *
2200MHz -- 2345MHz -45dBm 1 MHz

In certain regions the following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating
in Band 45. Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in Table
6.6.1.5.5-5.

##### 6.6.1.5.6 Co-location with other Base Stations
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS receivers
when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or
E-UTRA BS are co-located with a BS.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with base stations of the same class.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.1.5.6-1 for a BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed
in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station class. For
BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note
column of Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS
capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate
antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.1.5.6-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this subclause, the
co-location requirements in Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz
frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency range of a
downlink operating band (see Tables 4.4-1 and 4.4-2). The current state-of-
the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-location
with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling
loss. However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used.
These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [14].
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.1.5.6-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 4.4-1 or Table
4.4-2 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area.
For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the
same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
NOTE 3: Co-located TDD Base Stations that are synchronized and using the same
or adjacent operating band can transmit without special co-locations
requirements. For unsynchronized Base Stations, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
### 6.6.2 Operating band unwanted emissions
#### 6.6.2.1 Definition and applicability
The Operating band unwanted emission limits are defined from 10 MHz below the
lowest frequency of each supported downlink operating band to the lower Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge located at F~BW\ RF,low~ and from the upper Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge located at F~BW\ RF,high~ up to 10 MHz above the
highest frequency of each supported downlink operating band. In addition, for
a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block
gap. In addition, for a BS operating in multiple bands, it applies inside any
Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification,
except for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation. The
requirements in TS 45.005 [6] as defined in subclause 6.6.2.3 apply to an MSR
Base Station for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation in Band
Category 2.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter RF Bandwidth gap are
not applicable.
#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 37.104 [2] subclause 6.6.2.1, 6.6.2.2,
6.6.2.3 and 6.6.2.4.
#### 6.6.2.3 Test purpose
This test measures the emissions of the MSR BS, close to the assigned channel
bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.
#### 6.6.2.4 Method of test
For some of the test cases Tables 5.1-1 and 5.2-1 refer to single-RAT
specifications; see clause 5. In this case the following shall apply:
\- For references to TS 25.141 [10], the method of test is specified in TS
25.141 [10], subclause 6.5.2.1.4.
\- For references to TS 25.142 [12], the method of test is specified in TS
25.142 [12], subclause 6.6.2.1.4.
\- For references to TS 36.141 [9], the method of test is specified in TS
36.141 [9], subclause 6.6.3.4.
NOTE: In this case the test requirements of the present document defined in
subclause 6.6.2.5 apply.
For GSM/EDGE single-RAT requirements, the method of test is specified in TS
51.021 [11], applicable parts of subclause 6.5.1, 6.5.2, 6.6.2 and 6.12.
For test requirements of operating band unwanted emissions using the MSR test
configurations defined in subclause 4.8, the, method of test described in
subclauses 6.6.2.4.1 and 6.6.2.4.2 applies.
##### 6.6.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex B.2.
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~
in single-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1; B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and
B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see subclause 4.9.1.
1) Connect the signal analyzer to the Base Station antenna connector as shown
in Annex D.1.1.
As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should
be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and to avoid e.g. carrier leakage, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result
should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
2) Detection mode: True RMS.
##### 6.6.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the Base Station to transmit at maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in subclause 4.9.2.
2) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and
measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges with the specified
measurement bandwidth. For BS operating in multiple bands or non-contiguous
spectrum, the emission within the Inter RF Bandwidth or sub-block gap shall be
measured using the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest RF
Bandwidth or sub block edge.
3) Repeat the test for the remaining test cases with channel set-up according
to clause 5 and subclause 4.9.2.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
4) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of SBT or MBT shall be terminated.
#### 6.6.2.5 Test requirement
##### 6.6.2.5.1 Test requirements for Band Categories 1 and 3
For a Wide Area BS operating in Band Category 1 or Band Category 3, the
requirement applies outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition,
for a Wide Area BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any
sub-block gap. In addition, for a Wide Area BS operating in multiple bands, it
applies inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
For a Medium Range BS operating in Band Category 1 the requirement applies
outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition, for a Medium Range
BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block gap.
In addition, for a Medium Range BS operating in multiple bands, it applies
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
For a Local Area BS operating in Band Category 1 the requirement applies
outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition, for a Local Area BS
operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block gap. In
addition, for a Local Area BS operating in multiple bands, it applies inside
any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
Outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges, emissions shall not exceed the
maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.2.5.1-1 to 6.6.2.5.1-4 below, where:
\- âˆ†f is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency
and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency 10 MHz outside the downlink
operating band.
\- âˆ†f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.
For a BS operating in multiple bands, inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gaps with

###### ## Annex C (informative): Test Tolerances and Derivation of test
requirements
The test requirements explicitly defined in this specification have been
calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification
using the Test Tolerances defined here. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the
test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When the Test
Tolerance is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum
requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the
following tables.
Test requirements which are included by reference to TS 25.141 [10], TS
25.142[12], TS 36.141[9] or TS 51.021[11] have been calculated within the
referred test specification using the Test Tolerances defined therein.
The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties, regulatory
requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the Test
Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.
The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account
of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).
Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where
the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in subclause 4.1.2.
In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined test
tolerance in order to generate the correct tightened test requirements as
defined in this Annex.
Unless otherwise stated, the uncertainties in subclause 4.1.2 apply to the
Test System for testing E-UTRA, UTRA, GSM/EDGE and NB-IoT MSR BS.
