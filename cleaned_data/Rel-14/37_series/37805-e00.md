# 4 General
The aim of the study is as captured in the SI description document [2]:
\- Assumption: UE always camps on LTE and voice service is on UMTS
\- Study the possible solutions, on top of current mechanism, as the following
cases.
\- An idle UE in LTE initiating MT/MO voice call, both network and UE side
behaviours
\- A connected UE in LTE initiating MT/MO voice call, both network and UE side
behaviours
\- A connected UE in UMTS with CS service, UE tries to establish PS service
\- Study the possible solution and impacts on architecture, signalling flow
enhancement, with the working assumption that impacts should be as less as
possible, e.g. LTE specs.
# 5 SID Working Assumptions
As a starting point, possible solutions should have limited impact on both the
network equipment and user terminals. Further detailed working assumptions are
listed below:
1\. UE camps on LTE when under coverage of both LTE and UMTS.
2\. When a UE served by LTE has CS voice services, the CS voice service is
provided by the UMTS network while the data service is provided by the LTE
network.
3\. New interfaces, e.g. interface between RNC and eNB, are not considered in
the study.
4\. the impact to existing procedures and mechanisms should be minimized.
5\. The UE is equipped with Single Tx and Dual Rx.
6\. CSFB support for the LTE part of the network is assumed for single standby
case.
7\. Support of 10ms mode of DCH Enhancement is assumed.
# 6 Use case description
## 6.1 Use case 1: Idle UE
UE stays in Idle mode with no CS / PS connection in the coverage area of both
LTE and UMTS. The single standby UE is usually camping on LTE by network side
configuration (e.g. via reselection priorities). Legacy CSFB mechanism is used
for voice solution, in which UE releases from LTE with CSFB indicator and then
establishes CS voice. As of the existing CSFB mechanism may impact user
experience, it is beneficial to study on this use case and discuss on some
possible solutions to improve user's experience.
For dual standby UE, UE in Idle mode is camping on UMTS and LTE network
simultaneously and monitor system information and paging fromtwo RATs. UE will
initiate CS connection or PS connection following legacy procedure for MO and
MT cases.
This use case can be decomposed into the following use cases:
1a. The attach procedure(s) for attaching to both the EPC and the MSC. The
main purpose is that the UE is able to obtain services from both the PS and CS
core.
1b. Idle mode operation and the camping strategy.
1c. The Signaling procedure for the transition to Use case 2. This should be
legacy behavior.
1d. The Signaling procedure for the transition to Use case 3. Solutions may
need.
1e. Starting CS and PS service simultaneously and transition to Use case 4\.
We may assume that this can be avoided by always setting up one of the
connections first.
## 6.2 Use case 2: Connected UE in LTE
UE is connected in LTE. When the CS voice happens, the single standby UE
usually follows the legacy CSFB procedure with PS handover and release or
handover the PS connection in LTE. Due to the disadvantages of bandwidth and
data rate, UMTS is less competitive than LTE in PS service. Tight joint
operation of UMTS and LTE focuses on supporting concurrent transmission of CS
in UMTS and PS in LTE, as well as providing subscribers with good quality CS
voice and higher data rate. It is beneficial to study on this use case and
discuss on some possible solutions to improve user's experience.
As Dual Standby UE has camped in UMTS, even UE is connected in LTE, UE is
assumed to behave as MSC-only in UMTS (e.g. no CSFB-like CS paging over LTE).
UE can initiate CS connection in UMTS directly during the PS transmission via
LTE network.
This use case can be decomposed into the following use cases:
2a. Data transmission and reception and connected mode operation in LTE,
should be legacy behavior.
2b. Maintenance of capability to receive CS service from UTRAN.
2c. Addition of CS service and transition to use case 4: Initiation of a CS
voice call or reception of paging for a CS voice call and the signalling
procedure for transition to Use case 4
2d. Termination of PS operation and transition to Use case 1, should be
legacy.
## 6.3 Use case 3: Connected UE in UMTS
UE has CS call in UMTS. When a single standby UE gets the request to set up a
PS service, the legacy procedure is to setup PS in UMTS. But the PS service
experience in UMTS is not as competitive as LTE and the PS service is wished
be set up in LTE for better experience of subscribers in higher data rate. It
is beneficial to study on this use case and discuss on some possible solutions
to improve user's experience.
As the Dual Standby UE has camped in LTE, even UE is connected in UMTS, UE is
assumed to behave as EPS-only in LTE. UE can initiate PS connection in LTE
during the CS transmission via UMTS network.
This use case includes the following sub-usecases:
3a. Data transmission and reception and connected mode operation in UTRAN.
3b. Maintenance of capability to receive PS service from LTE.
3c. Addition of PS service and transition to use case 4: Initiation of PS
service in LTE or reception of paging for PS service from LTE and the
signaling procedure for transition to Use case 4.
3d. Termination of CS operation and transition to Use Case 1
## 6.4 Use case 4: Concurrent CS and PS operation
In this case the UE has an ongoing PS session in LTE and ongoing voice call in
UTRAN. It is beneficial to study on this use case and discuss on some possible
solutions to improve user's experience.
This use case includes the following sub-usecases:
4a. Configuration of Concurrent PS and CS operation in E-UTRAN and UTRAN.
4b. Concurrent PS and CS operation in E-UTRAN and UTRAN.
4c. Termination of the PS operation and the transition to Use case 3.
4d. Termination of the CS operation and the transition to Use case 2.
# 7 Potential Solutions and evaluation
## 7.1 Evaluation criteria
All the solutions proposed for this study item would be evaluated.
One set of criteria to evaluate the solutions would be on how the nodes are
impacted, e.g. RNC, eNB, Node B, CN, UE.
Latency aspect is also an important performance evaluation criteria to achieve
the ultimate goal of utilization of UMTS resource. The evaluation criteria
are:
\- eNB/Node B/RNC: The complexity of all possible solutions and their impacts
should be evaluated.
\- Core Network (MME, MSC): The CN side impacts should be evaluated.
UE side: The impact on UE should be evaluated.
\- Impact on latency (call setup time, PS interruption time): The impact on
latency (e.g. call setup time, PS interruption time) should be evaluated.
## 7.2 Potential solutions
## 7.2.1 Concurrent PS/CS Operation
The following provides a high level description of the operation for this
solution.
**Connected Mode -- Concurrent 3G CS + LTE PS**
In Concurrent 3G CS + LTE PS, the UE is simultaneously connected to 3G CS and
LTE PS, as shown in Fig.7.2.1-1.
{width="6.695138888888889in" height="3.048611111111111in"}
Fig. 7.2.1-1 - Connected Mode -- Concurrent 3G CS + LTE PS
In such state/condition, the following capabilities and functionalities are
proposed:
\- Dual/Independent (control/user plane) connections (over 3G CS and LTE PS),
with independent mobility and other connected mode procedures
\- No inter-RAN connection/coordination/communication
\- UE Dual-Rx and Single-Tx concurrent operation/transmission
How the UE sustains the two concurrent connections with a single Tx is studied
in section 7.2.1.1.4 and 7.2.1.2.4.
**Single RAT connected modes (CS or PS)**
In these modes, the UE is either LTE connected, with an ongoing PS/Data-only
call, or CS connected, with an ongoing 3G CS call. Connected operation in
these scenarios is similar to legacy from a radio perspective, as the UE does
not need to handle concurrent use of the transmitter for two RATs.
Procedures and triggers for transitioning from each of these modes to
concurrent CS/PS operation are studied in section 7.2.1.1 and 7.2.1.2.. High
level illustrations are shown in Fig. 7.2.1-2 for the PS connected mode and
Fig. 7.2.1-3 for the CS connected mode.
{width="6.695138888888889in" height="2.7708333333333335in"}
Fig. 7.2.1-2 - Connected Mode -- PS only
{width="6.5in" height="2.6305555555555555in"}
Fig. 7.2.1-3 - Connected Mode -- CS only
In the CS connected mode, the UE has an ongoing 3G CS call, and is idle in
LTE. UE dual-Rx allows independent LTE monitoring of PS pages and other LTE
idle mode tasks. It should be noted that the red line in Fig 7.2.1-2 only
represents single standby scenario.
**Idle Mode**
In this scenario, the UE is idle, with no CS or PS connection. The UE monitors
LTE paging and transitions to LTE connected following legacy procedures. For
CS paging, two candidate solutions have been identified:
\- LTE camping: UE is EPS/IMSI combined registered in LTE. CS paging is
received from LTE air interface;
\- Dual standby: UE camps on both UMTS and LTE. CS paging is received from
UMTS air interface.
#### 7.2.1.1 Solutions on single standby scenario
##### 7.2.1.1.1 Use case 1: Idle UE
In case of MO/MT CS call when the UE is in LTE idle, the procedure follows
legacy CSFB, with the exception that the PS Idle context (in the UE and EPC)
is not released, but remains in LTE. In case of MO/MT PS call when the UE in
LTE idle, legacy LTE MO/MT PS call setup procedures could be applied.
Figure 7.2.1.1.1-1 shows the MO CS call case; for MT, the 1^st^ step (not
shown) is UE paging (from MSC through MME/eNB); then the signalling flow is
the same as the MO CS call case, starting from RRC connection setup, to send
the Extended Service Request message.
{width="6.695138888888889in" height="2.8875in"}
Figure 7.2.1.1.1-1: Signalling flow for use case 1
The main LTE signalling changes, compared to legacy CSFB, are:
\- New UE capability signalled, to the eNB, at RRC connection setup
\- eNB configuration/authorization signalling, to the UE, via RRC connection
release
After RRC connection release, while UE proceeds with CS call setup in UMTS, it
remains in Idle in LTE for PS (using dual-Rx capabilities). It is expected to
maintain as well the LTE Idle context for the UE (which will not register to
the 3G PS domain, thus not triggering a PS IRAT change in EPC).
At CS call ends and then redirection to LTE, the UE should perform a (legacy)
combined TAU procedure, to re-establish CSFB paging via MME.
##### 7.2.1.1.2 Use case 2: Connected UE in LTE only
A PS connected UE in LTE initiating a MT/MO CS call: As shown in Figure
7.2.1.1.2-1, CS call setup in UMTS is concurrent with an ongoing PS call in
LTE. The RRC procedure is similar as legacy CSFB, the difference is that the
UE could send new capability of UMTS and LTE joint operation to the eNB, and
then the eNB could send an indication of the CS-PS concurrent operation to the
UE.
The UE and the network could initiate a temporary suspension of the PS
transmission in LTE in order to set up the CS call (as shown in the figure
7.3.1.1.2-1); alternatively, the network could configure sufficiently large
DTX/DRX patterns in order not to impact concurrent UMTS UL transmissions.
{width="6.920138888888889in" height="4.176388888888889in"}
Figure 7.2.1.1.2-1: Signalling flow for use case 2
The RRC reconfiguration message from the eNB would start the PS suspension or
the C-DRX operation. The RRC indication from the UE (successful CS RAB setup)
would resume the PS operation and/or trigger the activation of the concurrent
(10+10ms) CS and PS operation. Detailed analysis can be found in Annex A.1.
Regarding Timing alignment during concurrent operation, it is assumed that a
certain time alignment is required to efficiently operate in UL-Tx sharing
mode between UMTS and LTE. A simple approach, with minimal impacts to RAN
(e.g. no need for inter-RAN coordination/synchronization) and LTE signalling,
is to rely on UE detecting/reporting potential time offsets to UMTS (via
existing or new time-offset triggers/indications). It should be noted that the
LTE DRX/DTX pattern must be set up before accessing UTRAN. Otherwise it would
not be possible to report the wanted time offset to UTRAN. Impact of an
ongoing call should be minimized when designing the solutions.
Figure 7.2.1.1.2-1 also shows how timing configuration/alignment is expected
to work. The general principle is that:
\- The eNB firstly configures the (Connected mode DRX) UL 10ms gaps pattern
for the LTE PS link, e.g. at receipt of the UE (CS RAB setup) indication
\- Afterwards, the UE signals to the RNC proper time information (e.g. DPCH
frame offset) for aligning DCH enhancements frame timing
[Note that there may be further optimizations to start C-DRX 10ms UL gap mode
before CS RAB setup, e.g. after UMTS RRC setup, assuming that DCH enhancement
10ms mode can be configured for SRB only.]{.underline}
##### 7.2.1.1.3 Use case 3: Connected UE in UMTS only
A CS connected UE in UMTS initiating a (MO/MT) PS call: As shown in Figure
7.2.1.1.3-1, PS call setup in LTE is concurrent with an ongoing CS call in
UMTS.
The main LTE signalling changes, compared to a legacy LTE PS call setup, are:
\- New UE capability signalled, to the eNB, at RRC setup
\- (LTE) Signalling for concurrent operation start/end
\- Start: part of LTE RRC/E-RAB setup
\- End: dedicated UE-to-eNB (RRC) indication at CS call release, or implicit
stop at LTE PS/RRC release
_The figure also shows that the_ UE will use the 10ms UL gaps during UMTS DCH
enhancements to setup-up the PS call.
{width="6.695138888888889in" height="3.4930555555555554in"}
Figure 7.2.1.1.3-1: Signalling flow for use case 3
Regarding timing alignment aspects, figure 7.2.1.1.3-2 shows how timing
configuration/alignment is expected to work. The general principle is similar
as analysis in 7.2.1.1.2.
{width="6.5in" height="3.452777777777778in"}
Figure 7.2.1.1.3-2: Timing alignment procedure for use case 3
For LTE call setup procedure, there are some uplink signallings, e.g. RRC
connection request message.
For random access resource selection, if there is power ramping, the uplink
transmission may fall into the Tx off period so that additional transmission
delay may happen.
For other uplink signalling, if it is not within the 10ms uplink gap, the UE
should try to retransmit it in the next opportunity. For example, if there are
totally two transmissions for one uplink signalling, there may be at most 24ms
additional delay due to the 10ms uplink gap. Detailed analysis can be found in
Annex A.2.
##### 7.2.1.1.4 Use case 4: Connected UE in both LTE and UMTS
The CS-PS concurrent operation based on 10ms+10ms mode could work, assuming
RRC is established in both UMTS and LTE sides.
The CS-PS concurrent operation with a single UL TX (shared among UMTS CS and
LTE PS) is expected to operate efficiently using proper transmission gaps over
the two radios, achievable by largely reusing existing CS and PS
functionalities. Indeed DCH enhancements and LTE Connected mode DRX can
operate with UL transmission gaps (10ms) in order to allow the UE to timely
tune its UL Tx toward the other radio. Few general aspects and assumptions are
summarized here:
\- Over UMTS, UL/DL DPCH transmission follows existing DCH enhancements
procedures, particularly 10ms UL transmission is used to create 10ms gap over
20ms cycle.
\- Over LTE, Connected mode DRX configuration and procedures are used to
create UL gaps, e.g. relying on
\- Proper Connected mode DRX parameter values (e.g. ShortDRXCycle 20ms,
OnDuration 10ms, InactivityTimer 0, etc.)
\- Proper CSI, SR, SRS configuration and transmission
At the physical layer, an illustrative example of possible timing and
alternate UL Tx data transfer is shown in Figure 7.2.1.1.4-1.
{width="5.3625in" height="3.8631944444444444in"}
Figure 7.2.1.1.4-1: Example of alternating 10ms UL transmissions on LTE and
UMTS
The above scheme assumes aligned UL timing for LTE and UMTS. As described
earlier, time alignment can be achieved e.g. by proper DPCH frame offset
reporting and adjustment on UMTS (at/after call setup, and/or during the
concurrent data transfer). UE compares its UL timing on LTE and UMTS and
indicates required DPCH frame offset to UMTS.\ DPCH frame offset controls UMTS
UL timing with 256-chips granularity, and can be used to achieve fine UL
timing control on UMTS resulting in 128 chips (\< 0.5 LTE symbol) worst case
misalignment between LTE and UMTS UL timing (which may resolved by simply
disabling one extra subframe on LTE (i.e. OnDuration = 9ms).
It may be possible to disablie UMTS and LTE joint operation, e.g. due to the
need to fall back to 20ms mode in UMTS, Besides the necessary signalling,
specific UE/NW triggering criteria may be defined or left up to
implementation. (also valid for dual standby scenario).
When the UE has ongoing CS and PS, after PS call is finished, the procedure of
stopping the CS-PS concurrent operation is shown in figure 7.2.1.1.4-2.
{width="5.510416666666667in" height="3.21875in"}
Figure 7.2.1.1.4-2: CS+PS and PS call is finished
The procedures are described as below:
Step 1: If PS transmission is finished in LTE, the UE performs legacy
procedures in LTE, e.g. RRC connection release. In addition, the UE may inform
the RNC of stopping the CS-PS concurrent operation.
Step 2: The RNC may reconfigure the UE to stop the CS-PS concurrent operation.
Figure 7.3.1.1.4-3 shows the procedure of stopping the CS-PS concurrent
operation after CS is finished.
{width="5.614583333333333in" height="3.125in"}
Figure 7.2.1.1.4-3: CS+PS and CS call is finished
The procedures are described as below:
Step 1: If CS transmission is finished in UMTS, the UE performs legacy
procedures in UMTS, e.g. RRC connection release. In addition, the UE informs
the eNB of stopping the CS-PS concurrent operation.
Step 2: The eNB may reconfigure the UE to stop the CS-PS concurrent operation.
#### 7.2.1.2 Solutions on dual standby scenario
##### 7.2.1.2.1 Use case 1: Idle UE in both LTE and UMTS
In this scenario, from the UE point of view, it is expected that the UE will
camp on LTE and UMTS separately at the same time, read and monitor own system
information and paging in own idle mode.
Figure 7.2.1.2.1-1: UE Dual Standby in UMTS and LTE network
For dual standby, as there is no need to use CSFB like mechanism, if only CS
voice service is triggered (MT/MO), UE will follows legacy CS call setup
procedure in UMTS networks, which doesn't need any interworking with LTE
network. If only PS service is initiated, UE will follow legacy LTE call setup
procedure in LTE networks, which doesn't need any interworking with UMTS
network.
For dual standby UE in Idle mode operation and the camping strategy, LTE and
UTRAN need to broadcast the capability of supporting the CS-PS concurrent
operation. Each time when the UE enters or leaves the service area for UMTS
and LTE joint operation, it needs to register/deregister with the appropriate
core network to secure the availability of PS services. How this can be done
is up to UE implementation, without specification impacted.
When received inter-RAT cell reselection criteria from UMTS or LTE network,
the dual standby UE in Idle mode operation could ignore the received criteria
if both network supports UMTS and LTE concurrent operation, or fall back to
legacy UE behaviour to do single camping in one network according to the
received criteria. How this can be done and what policy should be used could
be up to UE implementation, without specification impacted, and no specific
requirement is foreseen to network on inter-RAT cell reselection criteria
setting in UTRAN and LTE.
##### 7.2.1.2.2 Use case 2: Connected UE in LTE only
From PS Connected only to PS+CS Connected, UE dual-Rx allows independent UMTS
monitoring of CS paging and other Idle tasks, normal CS call setup procedure
will take place in MO and MT case. The CS-PS concurrent operation is
activated.
Different from single standby scenario, the eNB doesn't know when CS call
setup will happen in UMTS side and eNB doesn't know when to reconfigure UE to
allow the CS-PS concurrent operation with one Tx. In this case, UE could
request UL gaps or the network could configure UL gaps to set up CS connection
and also request the CS-PS concurrent operation configuration, which are
showed in step2, step8 and step9 in Figure 7.2.1.2.2-1.
Figure 7.2.1.2.2-1: Dual Standby UE from PS-only to PS+CS (MT case)
For dual standby UE in data transmission and reception and connected mode
operation in LTE, it must be possible to activate time multiplexing between
UMTS and LTE during an ongoing connection on a need basis i.e. avoid any
static configuration.
In this case, how to configure DTX/DRX pattern, activate the CS-PS concurrent
operation and do timing aligning are same as single standby scenario section
7.2.1.1.2.
The requirements to the gap, the delay impacts to UMTS and LTE, are similar as
single standby scenario described in section 7.2.1.1.2.
##### 7.2.1.2.3 Use case 3: Connected UE in UMTS only
From CS Connected only to CS+PS connected, UE dual-Rx allows independent LTE
monitoring of PS paging and other Idle tasks, normal LTE connection setup
procedure will take place in MO and MT case. The CS-PS concurrent operation is
activated.
Same as Single standby scenario in section 7.2.1.1.3, the eNB doesn't know
when PS connection setup will happen in LTE side, and eNB doesn't know when to
reconfigure UE to allow the CS-PS concurrent operation with one Tx. In this
case, UE could request UL gaps or the RNC could configure UL gaps to set up CS
connection (as shown in step2) to set up PS connection, and could request the
CS-PS concurrent operation configuration from eNB during PS connection setup
phase in Figure 7.2.1.2.3-1, e.g., step3.
Figure 7.2.1.2.3-1: Dual Standby UE from CS-only to PS+CS
For dual standby UE in CS operation in UTRAN connected mode, it must be
possible to activate time multiplexing between UMTS and LTE during an ongoing
connection on a need basis i.e. avoid any static configuration. The CS-PS
concurrent operation activation is same as single standby scenario in section
7.2.1.1.3.
In this case, how to configure DTX/DRX pattern, activate the CS-PS concurrent
operation and do timing aligning are same as single standby scenario in
section 7.2.1.1.3.
The impacts to the LTE call setup delay are the similar as single standby
scenario described in section 7.2.1.1.3.
##### 7.2.1.2.4 Use case 4: Connected UE in both LTE and UMTS
For dual standby UE in UMTS and LTE joint operation, when network decides to
release one connection, the disabling of UMTS and LTE joint operation should
be implemented immediately. The criteria for disabling UMTS and LTE joint
operation to fallback to the 20ms mode is same as single standby scenario in
section 7.2.1.1.4.
The procedure for disabling UMTS and LTE joint operation during a voice call
is same as single standby scenario in section 7.2.1.1.4.
#### 7.2.1.3 Idle mode CSFB enhancements
We break this RRC-Idle mode, adding voice call scenario into two cases: one is
for Mobile originated call, and another for Mobile terminated call.
According to the current specification, an Idle UE who has selected a LTE cell
to camp on would do the Mobile Originating voice call by reusing the Mobile
Originating Call in Active mode procedures with Extended Service Request for
mobile originating CS fallback to the MME where the messages S1-AP UE Context
Modification Request and Response are replaced by S1-AP Initial UE Context
Request and Response. The LAI is included in the S1-AP Initial UE Context
Request message and sent to the eNodeB.
**A possible enhancement solution** would be that UE instead of applying the
active mode LTE CSFB procedure, it could go to UMTS quickly, for example, by
cell reselection to UMTS cells.
In the case of mobile terminated voice call, currently the handling procedure
is shown as in below (example shows PS HO not supported case).
Figure 7.2.1.3-1: Idle mode CSFB enhancements
Currently, the idle mode UE has to go through the "Random Access Procedure",
i.e. establishes an RRC connection and "Service Request & UE context setup",
i.e. sends an Extended Service Request for mobile terminating CS fallback to
MME. The UE indicates its S-TMSI in the RRC signalling. The Extended Service
Request message is encapsulated in RRC and S1 AP messages. After the "optional
Measurement Report", the UE will be directed to UTRAN and the UE context in
LTE is released. Eventually the UE will response to the paging when it has
successfully accessed the UTRAN network.
**A possible enhancement solution** , to improve the latency, could be that
when UE receives the paging from the CS domain, or when UE initiates a CS call
from Idle, instead of setting up a RRC connection towards LTE network, it goes
immediately to the UTRAN for the voice service. The Random Access Procedure
and the following communication to LTE network (from Step 7 to Step 11 in the)
are skipped. When less UE performs random access to the LTE network for CSFB
purpose, it would in turn improve the LTE system capacity, so that the system
resource is more effectively used for the UE who needs to access the system
for pure PS services.
In both cases, LTE system could provide assistance to help the UE:
\- The LTE SIB information contains the Preferred UMTS frequency / the UMTS
candidate cell list/ the UTRAN cell identifies.
\- The LTE SIB broadcast the UTRAN cell system information for the selected
Cells, so that the UE could quickly camp on the UTRAN cell.

the core network nodes will be impacted due to the change in procedural
aspects, e.g. by the eNB not releasing the UE context after a CSFB.

From latency perspective, for single standby, to initiate CS connection, UE
will request RRC/S1 UE context resource in LTE before CS call setup in UMTS.
Compared with dual standby, it will experience CS call setup performance with
higher latency (same as legacy CSFB).
From UE battery consumption perspective, for dual standby, UE is required to
continuously monitor the paging channel, receive system information, and
perform measurements for idle mode mobility in both UMTS and LTE networks.
Compared with single standby, it will reduce UE stand-by time.
# 8 Conclusions
In HSPA and LTE Joint Operation study item, RAN3 and RAN2 UMTS have studied
both single standby and dual standby scenarios to support the concurrent
transmission of 4G PS and 3G CS operation with Dual Rx/Single Tx UE. For
either single standby scenario or dual standby scenario, we have studied the
corresponding solutions of four use cases of each scenario, and all potential
solutions are captured in the TR. The four use cases are idle UE in the
coverage area of both LTE and UMTS (use case 1), connected UE in LTE (use case
2), connected UE in UMTS (use case 3) and Connected UE in both LTE and UMTS
(use case 4).
For single standby RAN3/RAN2 UMTS have discussed to use a modified CSFB
procedure to support concurrent transmission of 3G CS and 4G PS for four use
cases. For use case 1, RAN3/RAN2 UMTS have studied the need of new UE
capability signalling, eNB configuration/authorization signalling. For use
case 2 and 3, the UL gaps for CS call setting up are studies, and UL gaps
could be configured by network or requested by UE. For use case 4, DCH
enhancements and LTE Connected mode DRX (C-DRX) can operate with UL
transmission gaps (10ms) in order to allow the UE to timely tune its UL Tx
toward the other radio. An idle mode CSFB enhancement is also studied to fast
access to 3G with the assistance of 4G. RAN3/RAN2 UMTS have identified the
further specification work on new UE capability signalling, eNB
configuration/authorization signalling, UL gaps for CS call setting up, UL
transmission gaps, and CSFB signalling and flow optimization.
When the UE is in the concurrent operation of CS and PS services (both single
standby and dual standby cases), security mechanisms should be operated
independently in each RAT. But detailed impact on security has not been fully
considered, to confirm/clarify the security aspects/impacts, SA3 would need to
be consulted if going for work item phase.
For dual standby RAN3/RAN2 UMTS have discussed that LTE and UMTS could work
independently. There is no interworking between LTE and UMTS for all use
cases. The potential conflicts between dual standby and broadcast IRAT
reselection criteria for use case1 are identified for further study. Similar
as single standby scenario, UL gaps for CS call setting up of use case2 and
time multiplexing of use case 3 are identified to be further studied.
As a summary, the use cases and corresponding solutions for UMTS and LTE joint
operation have been analysed in RAN2 UMTS and RAN3. The solutions involve two
standby schemes (single and dual standby) and a common LTE-UMTS multiplexing
scheme. An enhanced idle mode CSFB has also been studied. We have studied the
solution from the UMTS perspective. Potential impacts on LTE system from
RAN2's point of view and other working group(s), e.g., SA2, have not been
fully investigated, e.g., detailed RAN1 aspects and potential RAN4 impacts
would need to be considered if going for work item phase.
###### ### Annex A: Evaluations
## A.1 Detailed LTE impacts on use case 2
For eNB configured PS suspension in LTE to do CS call setup, there is no clear
impact foreseen in UMTS. PS interruption would be as long as it takes to setup
a CS RAB (e.g. could be up to 1-2 seconds). In legacy CSFB, the UE will
release the PS in LTE and resume the PS in 3G, and the interruption time
depends on the radio access delay and PS setup delay in UMTS.
Alternatively, the eNB could configure the DRX/DTX pattern to the UE so that
the UE could finish CS call setup within the uplink gaps, so the impact
depends on the DRX configured in LTE side. Currently, LTE C-DRX allows the
network to configure short DRX and long DRX. For short DRX, the cycle could be
as long as 640ms; for long DRX, the cycle could be as long as 2560ms. If the
eNB configures a DTX/DRX pattern, the UE will stop any uplink data or
signaling transmission and postpone to the DRX on duration. So the data
transmission delay is related to the DRX cycle configuration. For example, if
the time of configuring DCH enhancements (from the time when the UE sending
the RRC connection request to the time when DCH enhancements is configured) is
expected to be less than 640ms, the eNB could configure a DRX cycle with 640ms
and it could ensure a DCH enhancements configuration at UMTS side, the PS data
transmission delay is up to 640ms.
## A.2 Detailed LTE impacts on use case 3
In figure A.2-1, the UE may use the uplink gaps to access LTE, i.e. from
Random Access Preamble to RRC connection setup complete. After RRC connection
setup is finished, the eNB could configure C-DRX based on the UE's request.
Figure A.2-1: a typical LTE call setup signalling flow
The following signaling procedures will be impacted due to the 10ms uplink
gap.
● Random Access Preamble (Physical layer transmission)
● RRC connection request (RRC layer transmission)
● HARQ for RRC connection setup (MAC layer transmission)
● Status Report / Buffer Status Report (MAC layer transmission)
● RRC connection setup complete (RRC layer transmission)
● HARQ for the RLC ACK of RRC connection setup complete (MAC layer
transmission)
**[1. Random Access Preamble]{.underline}**
In LTE, the UE firstly reads the SIB in order to acquire PRACH configuration
of the cell. Based on the PRACH configuration the UE determines the available
random access resources and sends a randomly selected random access preamble
in the available resoures.
In Figure A.2-2, an example is shown where the subframes 1, 4, 7 per 10ms are
available for preamble transmission. The available access subframes are shown
in yellow boxes and the UE can send the random access preamble by using these
resources. If there is power ramping, the uplink transmission may fall into
the Tx off period so that additional transmission delay may happen. How the UE
shall resume the ramping after the TX gap needs further study.
Figure A.2-2: Random access resource selection by the UE
**[2. RRC connection request]{.underline}**
If a random access response is received, the UE should send the RRC connection
request message after a certain time. If the transmission opportunity is not
within the 10ms uplink gap, the UE will postpone the transmission to the next
opportunity (i.e. the next 10ms uplink gap).
As shown in figure A.2-3, if the UE is to send RRC connection request message
and the subframe 0 in SFN M is selected, the UE may postpone this transmission
to an opportunity in SFN M+1.
Figure A.2-3: uplink data transmission between UMTS and LTE
Here is the analysis on possible delay due to the 10ms uplink gap:
**[Case 1:]{.underline}**
If the RRC connection request message is within the 10ms uplink gap, the UE
could transmit this message, and thus there is no additional delay if it
receives an ACK.
{width="6.493055555555555in" height="1.0638888888888889in"}
Figure A.2-4: RRC signaling transmission case 1
**[Case 2:]{.underline}**
In extreme case, if the RRC connection request message is not within the 10ms
uplink gap, the UE should try to retransmit it in the next opportunity. As
shown in figure A.2-5, there are the following transmission behaviours:
\- 1^st^ transmission: subframe 1 in SFN M, postponed
\- 2^nd^ transmission: subframe 9 in SFN M, postponed
\- 3^rd^ transmission: subframe 7 in SFN M+1, transmitted but receives a NACK
in subframe 1 in SFN M+2
\- 4^th^ transmission: subframe 5 in SFN M+2, postponed
\- 5^th^ transmission: subframe 3 in SFN M+3, transmitted and receives an ACK
It can be seen that there is a delay of 36ms from the 1^st^ transmission to
successfully receive an ACK. In legacy case, if there are totally two
transmissions (one initial transmission plus a retransmission), the delay is
12ms. So there may be additional delay of 24ms.
{width="6.496527777777778in" height="0.74375in"}
Figure A.2-5: RRC signaling transmission case 2
**[3. Other uplink signalling]{.underline}**
Similar as the transmission RRC connection request, if any uplink signalling
falls into the 10ms uplink transmission for UMTS, there may be an additional
delay.
If considering all above 5 uplink messages that may be impacted by the 10ms
uplink gap, the total delay depend on transmission opportunity and the times
of retransmissions. For example, if there are totally two actual transmissions
for each uplink message, there is 0\~120ms additional delay due to the 10ms
uplink gap.
