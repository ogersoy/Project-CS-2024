# 1 Scope
The present document defines the requirements for the transceiver of the
pan‑European digital cellular telecommunications systems GSM.
Requirements are defined for two categories of parameters:
> \- those that are required to provide compatibility between the radio
> channels, connected either to separate or common antennas, that are used in
> the system. This category also includes parameters providing compatibility
> with existing systems in the same or adjacent frequency bands;
>
> \- those that define the transmission quality of the system.
The present document defines RF characteristics for the Mobile Station (MS)
and Base Station System (BSS). The BSS will contain Base Transceiver Stations
(BTS), which can be normal BTS,micro‑BTS or pico-BTS. The precise measurement
methods are specified in 3GPP TS 51.010 and 3GPP TS 51.021.
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements defined in this EN apply to the full
range of environmental conditions specified for the equipment (see annex D).
In the present document some relaxations are introduced for GSM 400 MSs, GSM
900 MSs, GSM 700 MSs and GSM 850 MSs which pertain to power class 4, 5 or 6
(see subclause 4.1.1). In the present document these Mobile Stations are
referred to as "small MS".
In the present document some relaxations to receiver requirements are
introduced for a MS indicating support for Downlink Multi Carrier (DLMC), see
3GPP TS 24.008, when in DLMC configuration. DLMC configurations are specified
for only GSM 850, GSM 900, DCS 1800 and PCS 1900.
MSs may operate on more than one of the frequency bands specified in clause 2.
These MSs are referred to as "Multi band MSs" in this EN. Multi band MSs shall
meet all requirements for each of the bands supported. The relaxation on GSM
400 MSs, GSM 900 MSs, GSM 700 MSs and GSM 850 MSs for a "small MS" are also
valid for a multi band MS if it complies with the definition of a small MS.
The RF characteristics of repeaters are defined in annex E of this EN. Annexes
D and E are the only clauses of this EN applicable to repeaters. Annex E does
not apply to the MS or BSS. The precise measurement methods for repeaters are
specified in 3GPP TS 51.026 [35].
The present document also includes specification information for mixed mode
operation at 850 MHz and 1900 MHz (MXM 850 and MXM 1900). 850 MHz and 1900 MHz
mixed-mode is defined as a network that deploys both 30 kHz RF carriers and
200 kHz RF carriers in geographic regions where the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) regulations are applied or adopted.
The requirements for a MS in a mixed-mode system, MXM 850 and MXM 1900,
correspond to the requirements for GSM 850 MS and PCS 1900 MS respectively.
Annex M defines the minimum performance requirements for A-GPS for MSs that
support A-GPS. Annex M does not apply to the BSS.
The present document also includes specific requirements for multicarrier BTS,
wherever explicitly stated in the text, that apply for all classes of
multicarrier BTS (Wide Area, Medium Range and Local Area) if nothing else is
stated. All other requirements designated for BTS and normal BTS apply if not
otherwise stated. The multicarrier BTS classes have relaxed requirements in
the areas of Tx spurious emissions, intermodulation attenuation and, when
multicarrier receiver is included, Rx blocking. Usage of multicarrier BTSs in
some geographical regions might be subject to regulatory restrictions to
protect other radio systems operating in bands of adjacent frequency
assignments, in particular for all safety related applications like railway
applications. In areas where such systems coexist with multicarrier BTSs, the
received interference power originating from multicarrier BTSs might have to
be limited.
The document also includes entry points in some tables for the multicarrier
BTS requirements to which TS 37.104 [33] for Multi-Standard Radio Base
Stations (MSR BS) is referring to as specific GSM/EDGE single-RAT requirements
not covered by the general requirements. These entry points are marked with
^M)^ and, as described in a note in each applicable table, identify the
relevant column(s) that are applicable as MSR BS requirements. In general the
requirements for multicarrier BTS equipped with multicarrier receiver also
apply to Multi-Standard Radio Base Stations. The GSM requirements for Multi-
Standard Radio Base Stations are defined for GSM 850, GSM 900, DCS 1800 and
PCS 1900 only. Requirements for other frequency bands and MXM base stations
are excluded. Annex P defines the minimum performance for the receiver in MSR
BS.\ For equipment not declared as MSR BS the ^M)^ indications can be ignored.
The present document defines requirements for the usage of the ER-GSM band.
The national implementation might be subject to regulatory coordination
agreements to avoid system impacts (RF scenarios for ER-GSM introduction are
given in 3GPP TR 45.050).
The present document defines requirements for supporting a low-complexity, low
data throughput service in environments experiencing high propagation
attenuation as indoors in basements etc. This service, based on EGPRS, with
extended coverage is called EC-GSM-IoT. For EC-GSM-IoT, in case no specific
requirement is explicitly stated, the requirements for EGPRS apply.

For T-GSM 810 the requirements for GSM 900 shall apply, apart for those
parameters for which a separate requirement exists.
Operators may implement networks that operates on a combination of the
frequency bands above to support multi band mobile terminals.
The channel spacing is 200 kHz.
The carrier frequency is designated by the absolute radio frequency channel
number (ARFCN). If we call Fl(n) the frequency value of the carrier ARFCN n in
the lower band, and Fu(n) the corresponding frequency value in the upper band,
we have for the dynamically mapped ARFCNs:

ARFCN_FIRST, y = BAND_OFFSET and z = ARFCN_RANGE (See 3GPP TS 44.018).
Parameters defining carrier frequencies not belonging to the indicated band
shall not be considered erroneous.
Information about dynamic mapping is provided by System Information type 15 or
Packet System Information type 8 if PBCCH exists, and optionally by System
Information type 14. Dynamic ARFCN mapping shall be valid for the whole PLMN.
Dynamic mapping has priority over the fixed designation of carrier
frequencies. The support of dynamic ARFCN mapping is optional for all other
mobile stations except those supporting GSM 700 and T-GSM.

Frequencies are in MHz.
A multi-band MS shall interpret ARFCN numbers 512 to 810 as either DCS 1800 or
PCS 1900 frequencies according to the parameter BAND_INDICATOR when received
in other than the DCS 1800 or PCS 1900 bands. If received in the DCS 1800 or
PCS 1900 bands, those ARFCN numbers shall be interpreted as frequencies in the
same band. The BAND_INDICATOR is broadcast on BCCH, PBCCH, EC-BCCH and SACCH.
The most recently received value shall be applied by the mobile station. If
the parameter is not broadcast, the default value is DCS 1800 frequencies.
# 3 Reference configuration
The reference configuration for the radio subsystem is described in 3GPP TS
45.001.
The micro‑BTS is different from a normal BTS in two ways. Firstly, the range
requirements are much reduced whilst the close proximity requirements are more
stringent. Secondly, the micro‑BTS is required to be small and cheap to allow
external street deployment in large numbers. Because of these differences the
micro‑BTS needs a different set of RF parameters to be specified. Where the RF
parameters are not different for the micro‑BTS the normal BTS parameters shall
apply.
The pico-BTS is an extension of the micro-BTS concept to the indoor
environments. The very low delay spread, low speed, and small cell sizes give
rise to a need for a different set of RF parameters to be specified.
Multicarrier BTS is a BTS characterized by the ability to, in addition to
single carrier operation, process two or more carriers in common active RF
components simultaneously, either in multicarrier transmitter only or, in both
multicarrier transmitter and multicarrier receiver. The multicarrier BTS is
divided into the Wide Area, Medium Range and Local Area classes for different
deployment conditions. The requirements for normal BTS applies to all classes
of multicarrier BTS unless otherwise stated in this specification.
The vendor shall declare if the multicarrier BTS supports non-contiguous
frequency allocation, defined as an allocation where two groups of frequencies
are separated with at least 5.4 MHz carrier separation between the innermost
carriers. The term maximum Base Station RF bandwidth defines the maximum RF
bandwidth in which a multicarrier BTS either transmits or transmits and
receives multiple carriers simultaneously.
# 4 Transmitter characteristics
Throughout this clause, unless otherwise stated, requirements are given in
terms of power levels at the antenna connector of the equipment. For equipment
with integral antenna only, a reference antenna with 0 dBi gain shall be
assumed.
For GMSK modulation, the term output power refers to the measure of the power
when averaged over the useful part of the burst (see annex B).
For QPSK, AQPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM modulation, the term output power
refers to a measure that, with sufficient accuracy, is equivalent to the long
term average of the power when taken over the useful part of the burst as
specified in 3GPP TS 45.002 with any fixed TSC and with random encrypted bits.
The term peak hold refers to a measurement where the maximum is taken over a
sufficient time that the level would not significantly increase if the holding
time were longer.
> NOTE: From a system perspective the over the air antenna performance is
> relevant. To determine the MS over the air performance the Total Radiated
> Power has been defined. Its definition can be found in 3GPP TS 25.144, and a
> test method is specified in 3GPP TS 34.114.

The maximum power for power class E1-E3 is corrected for the different

Maximum output power for GMSK in any one band shall always be equal to or
higher than maximum output power for all other modulations for the same
equipment in the same band.
A multi band MS has a combination of the power class in each band of operation
from the table above. Any combination may be used.
For EC-GSM-IoT capable mobile stations only GMSK modulation is mandatory.
8-PSK modulation is optional.\ For EC-GSM-IoT mobile stations at GMSK
modulation only power classes 4 and 6 apply for GSM 850 and E-GSM 900, and
power classes 1 and 6 apply for DCS 1800 and PCS 1900. Corresponding power
classes for 8-PSK modulation are E2 and E4 for all bands.
The PCS 1 900, including its actual antenna gain, shall not exceed a maximum
of 2 Watts (+33 dBm) EIRP per the applicable FCC rules for wideband PCS
services [FCC Part 24, Subpart E, Section 24.232]. Power Class 3 is restricted
to transportable or vehicular mounted units.
For GSM 850 MS, including its actual antenna gain, shall not exceed a maximum
of 7 Watts (+38,5 dBm) ERP per the applicable FCC rules for public mobile
services. [FCC Part 22, Subpart H, Section 22.913]
For GSM 700 MS, including its actual antenna gain, shall not exceed a maximum
of 3 Watts (+35 dBm) ERP for handheld devices and maximum of 30 Watts (+45
dBm) ERP for other mobile devices per the applicable FCC rules. [FCC Part 27,
Subpart C, Section 27.50].
ii) The different power control levels needed for adaptive power control and
open-loop (EC-)RACH power control (see 3GPP TS 45.008) shall have the nominal
output power as defined in the tables below, starting from the power control
level for the lowest nominal output power up to the power control level for
the maximum nominal output power corresponding to the class of the particular
MS as defined in the tables above. Whenever a power control level commands the
MS to use a nominal output power equal to or greater than the maximum nominal
output power for the power class of the MS, the nominal output power
transmitted shall be the maximum nominal output power for the MS class, and
the tolerance specified for that class (see tables 4.1-1, 4.1-2 and 4.1-3
above) shall apply.

Furthermore, the difference in output power actually transmitted by the MS
between two power control levels where the difference in nominal output power
indicates an increase of 2 dB (taking into account the restrictions due to
power class), shall be +2 ± 1,5 dB. Similarly, if the difference in output
power actually transmitted by the MS between two power control levels where
the difference in nominal output power indicates an decrease of 2 dB (taking
into account the restrictions due to power class), shall be ‑2 ± 1,5 dB.

A change from any power control level to any power control level may be
required by the base transmitter. The maximum time to execute this change is
specified in 3GPP TS 45.008.

The output power actually transmitted by the MS at each of the power control
levels shall form a monotonic sequence, and the interval between power steps
shall be 2 dB ± 1,5 dB except for the step between power control levels 30 and
31 where the interval is 1 dB ± 1 dB.
The MS transmitter may be commanded by the BTS to change from any power
control level to any other power control level. The maximum time to execute
this change is specified in 3GPP TS 45.008.
For CTS transmission, the nominal maximum output power of the MS shall be
restricted to:
> \- 11 dBm (0,015 W) in GSM 900 i.e. power control level 16;
>
> \- 12 dBm (0,016 W) in DCS 1 800 i.e. power control level 9.
iii) In order to manage mobile terminal heat dissipation resulting from
transmission on multiple uplink timeslots, a mobile station that is not in EC
operation may reduce its maximum output power by up to the values in table
4.1-5. A mobile station in EC operation shall be capable of transmitting at
the declared nominal output power for the duration of uplink data transfer,
for any number of timeslots used.
Table 4.1-5 MS power reduction when transmitting on multiple uplink timeslots
* * *
Number of timeslots in uplink assignment Permissible nominal reduction of
maximum output power, (dB)
1 0 2 3,0 3 4,8 4 6,0 5 7,0 6 7,8 7 8,5 8 9,0
* * *
The actual supported maximum output power shall be in the range indicated by
the parameters XXX_MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE (See 3GPP TS 24.008) for n assigned
uplink timeslots:
a ≤ MS maximum output power ≤ min(MAX_PWR, a + b)
Where:
> a = min (MAX_PWR, MAX_PWR + XXX_MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE -- 10log(n));
>
> MAX_PWR equals to the MS maximum output power according to the relevant
> power class;
>
> XXX_MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE refers either to GMSK_MULTISLOT_POWER PROFILE or
> 8‑PSK_MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE depending on the modulation type concerned,
> and
>
> XXX_MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE 0 = 0 dB;
>
> XXX_MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE 1 = 2 dB;
>
> XXX_MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE 2 = 4 dB;
>
> XXX_MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE 3 = 6 dB.
>
> For DCS 1800 and PCS 1900 frequency bands b = 3 dB, for all other bands b =
> 2 dB.
For QPSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM modulations 8-PSK_MULTISLOT_POWER_PROFILE shall
apply, corrected for the difference in MAX_PWR for each modulation.
The supported maximum output power for each number of uplink timeslots shall
form a monotonic sequence. The maximum reduction of maximum output power from
an assignment of n uplink timeslots to an assignment of n+1 uplink timeslots
shall be equal to the difference of maximum permissible nominal reduction of
maximum output power for the corresponding number of timeslots, as defined in
the table 4.1-5 above.
As an exception, in case of a multislot uplink assignment, the first power
control step down from the maximum output power is allowed to be in the range
0...2 dB.
In case the MS transmits on more uplink slots than assigned (e.g. due to a
polling response, see 3GPP TS 44.060), the MS may reduce uplink power as above
for a multislot uplink configuration but as a function of the number of active
uplink slots on a TDMA frame basis.
On a multislot uplink configuration the MS may restrict the interslot output
power control range to a 10 dB window, on a TDMA frame basis. On those
timeslots where the ordered power level is more than 10 dB lower than the
applied power level of the highest power timeslot, the MS shall transmit at a
lowest possible power level within 10 dB range from the highest applied power
level, if not transmitting at the actual ordered power level.
### 4.1.2 Base station
a) **Requirements for base stations except multicarrier BTS**
For a normal BTS, the maximum output power measured at the input of the BSS Tx
combiner, shall be, according to its class, as defined in the following table.

* * *
For BTS supporting QPSK, AQPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and/or 32-QAM the manufacturer
shall declare the maximum output power capability for GMSK and for each
additionally supported combination of modulation and symbol rate.
The TRX power class is defined by the highest single carrier output power
capability for any modulation.
b) **Requirements for multicarrier BTS**
For BTS belonging to a multicarrier BTS class, the manufacturer shall declare
the maximum output power per carrier in case that all carriers are operated at
the same nominal output power. The declaration shall be given for each
modulation and for all supported number of carriers up to the maximum number
on each antenna port. Additionally, the maximum total power supported shall be
declared.
The maximum total output power measured at the antenna connector after all
stages of combining shall be as declared by the manufacturer but within the
limits of the multicarrier BTS class, specified in table 4.1-8.

modulation shall be ±2 dB under normal conditions and ±2,5 dB under extreme
conditions. Settings shall be provided to allow the output power to be reduced
from the maximum level for the modulation with the highest output power
capability in at least six steps of nominally 2 dB with an accuracy of ±1 dB
for each modulation to allow a fine adjustment of the coverage by the network
operator. In addition, the actual absolute output power for each supported
modulation at each static RF power step (N), with the exception below for the
highest RF power level for 8-PSK, AQPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM shall be 2*N
dB below the absolute output power at static RF power step 0 for the
modulation with the highest output power capability with a tolerance of ±3 dB
under normal conditions and ±4 dB under extreme conditions. The static RF
power step 0 shall be the actual output power according to the TRX power
class.
As an option the BSS can utilize downlink RF power control. In addition to the
static RF power steps described above, the BSS may then for each supported
modulation utilize up to 15 steps of power control levels with a step size of
2 dB ± 1,5 dB, in addition the actual absolute output power for each supported
modulation at each power control level (N), with the exception below for the
highest power level for QPSK, AQPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM, shall be 2*N dB
below the absolute output power at power control level 0 for the modulation
with the highest output power capability with a tolerance of ±3 dB under
normal conditions and ±4 dB under extreme conditions. The power control level
0 shall be the set output power according to the TRX power class and the six
power settings defined above.
The output power for GMSK, QPSK, AQPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM shall be
nominally the same for any supported static RF power step and power control
level. An exception is allowed for the maximum output power levels of
respectively QPSK, AQPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM which may be lower than the
GMSK output power for the same power step or power control level. The nominal
size of the first step down from the respective maximum power level of QPSK,
AQPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM may be in the range 0...2 dB. The output power
for the GMSK, QPSK, AQPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM at this power control
level shall still be considered the same when required in 3GPP TS 45.008. The
output power of QPSK, AQPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM for the remaining power
steps or power control levels shall be the same as the GMSK power for the
corresponding power step or power control level within a tolerance of ±1 dB.
The number of static RF power steps and the total number of power control
steps may be different for GMSK and other modulations.
Network operators or manufacturers may also specify the BTS output power
including any Tx combiner, according to their needs.
d) **Requirements for base stations supporting EC-GSM-IoT**
Additionally, when the base station transmits for an EC-PDTCH/EC-PACCH using
four blind physical layer transmissions per TDMA frame (i.e. CC2, CC3 or CC4)
with the same USF value in subsequent timeslots, then the equivalent combined
power according to Annex T shall be at static RF power step 0 (without
downlink RF power control) at least equal to:
> \- The declared maximum output power + 10 dB (under normal conditions)
>
> \- The declared maximum output power + 9.5 dB (under extreme conditions)
There are no separate performance requirements for EC-PDTCH/2TS or EC-
PACCH/2TS.
#### 4.1.2.1 Additional requirements for PCS 1 900 and MXM 1900 Base stations
The BTS transmitter maximum rated output power per carrier, measured at the
input of the transmitter combiner, shall be, according to its TRX power class,
as defined in the table 4.1-6 above. The base station output power may also be
specified by the manufacturer or system operator at a different reference
point (e.g. after transmitter combining).
The maximum radiated power from the BTS, including its antenna system, shall
not exceed a maximum of 1 640 W EIRP, equivalent to 1 000 W ERP, per the
applicable FCC rules for wideband PCS services [FCC part 24, subpart E,
section 24.237].
#### 4.1.2.2 Additional requirements for GSM 850 and MXM 850 Base stations
The BTS transmitter maximum rated output power per carrier, measured at the
input of the transmitter combiner, shall be, according to its TRX power class,
as defined in the table 4.1-6 above. The base station output power may also be
specified by the manufacturer or system operator at a different reference
point (e.g. after transmitter combining).
The maximum radiated power from the BTS, including its antenna system, shall
not exceed a maximum of 500 W ERP, per the applicable FCC rules for public
mobile services [FCC part 22, subpart H, section 22.913].
#### 4.1.2.3 Additional requirements for GSM 700 Base stations
The BTS transmitter maximum rated output power per carrier, measured at the
input of the transmitter combiner, shall be, according to its TRX power class,
as defined in the table 4.1-6 above. The base station output power may also be
specified by the manufacturer or system operator at a different reference
point (e.g. after transmitter combining).
The maximum radiated power from the BTS, including its antenna system, shall
not exceed a maximum 1000 W ERP for GSM 700 BTS per the applicable FCC rules
[FCC Part 27, Subpart C, Section 27.50].
#### 4.1.2.4 Additional requirements for ER-GSM 900 Base stations
The BTS transmitter maximum rated output power per carrier, measured at the
input of the transmitter combiner, shall be, according to its TRX power class,
as defined in the table 4.1-6 above.
The BTS transmitter maximum rated output power per carrier shall be subject to
regulatory coordination to avoid uncoordinated system impacts (RF scenarios
for ER-GSM introduction and the MCL to be used are given in 3GPP TR 45.050)
based on the case of uncoordinated or coordinated deployment in the same
geographical area with other systems in the E-GSM band as specified in this
clause.
##### 4.1.2.4.1 Uncoordinated deployment
In case of uncoordinated deployment with other systems in the E-GSM band, in
order to prevent blocking, the BTS transmitter maximum rated output power per
carrier, measured at the input of the transmitter combiner, in the frequency
range 918-921 MHz, shall be at most:
i) -40.4 dBm + MCL + (f-918.2)*6 dB in case of coexistence with GSM BTS
ii) -58.7 dBm + MCL + (f-918.2)*11 dB in case of coexistence with UTRA and
E-UTRA BS
where f = DL frequency in MHz, 918.2 ≤ f ≤ 921.0 and MCL=67dB.
##### 4.1.2.4.2 Coordinated deployment
In case of coordinated deployment with other systems in the E-GSM band, MCL
higher than 67 dB can be taken into account to allow higher output power from
an ER-GSM BTS transmitting in 918-921 MHz.
## 4.2 Output RF spectrum
The specifications contained in this subclause apply to both BTS and MS, in
frequency hopping as well as in non frequency hopping mode, except that beyond
1800 kHz offset from the carrier the BTS is not tested in frequency hopping
mode.
Due to the bursty nature of the signal, the output RF spectrum results from
two effects:
> \- the modulation process;
>
> \- the power ramping up and down (switching transients).
The two effects are specified separately; the measurement method used to
analyse separately those two effects is specified in 3GPP TS 51.010 and 3GPP
TS 51.021. It is based on the "ringing effect" during the transients, and is a
measurement in the time domain, at each point in frequency.
The limits specified thereunder are based on a 5‑pole synchronously tuned
measurement filter.
Unless otherwise stated, for the BTS, only one transmitter is active for the
tests of this subclause.
### 4.2.1 Spectrum due to the modulation and wide band noise
#### 4.2.1.1 General requirements for all types of Base stations and MS
The output RF modulation spectrum is specified in the tables in 4.2.1.3. A
mask representation of this specification is shown in annex A. This
specification applies for all RF channels supported by the equipment.
The specification applies to the entire of the relevant transmit band and up
to 2 MHz either side.
The specification shall be met under the following measurement conditions:
> \- for BTS up to 1800 kHz from the carrier and for MS in all cases:
>
> \- zero frequency scan, filter bandwidth and video bandwidth of 30 kHz up to
> 1800 kHz from the carrier and 100 kHz at 1800 kHz and above from the
> carrier, with averaging done over 50 % to 90 % of the useful part of the
> transmitted bursts, excluding the midamble, and then averaged over at least
> 200 such burst measurements. Above 1800 kHz from the carrier only
> measurements centred on 200 kHz multiples are taken with averaging over 50
> bursts.
>
> \- for BTS at 1800 kHz and above from the carrier:
>
> \- swept measurement with filter and video bandwidth of 100 kHz, minimum
> sweep time of 75 ms, averaging over 200 sweeps. All slots active, frequency
> hopping disabled.
>
> \- when tests are done in frequency hopping mode, the averaging shall
> include only bursts transmitted when the hopping carrier corresponds to the
> nominal carrier of the measurement. The specifications then apply to the
> measurement results for any of the hopping frequencies.
The figures in tables ax), bx) and cx) in 4.2.1.3, at the vertically listed
power level (dBm) and at the horizontally listed frequency offset from the
carrier (kHz), are then the maximum allowed level (dB) relative to a
measurement in 30 kHz on the carrier.
> NOTE: This approach of specification has been chosen for convenience and
> speed of testing. It does however require careful interpretation if there is
> a need to convert figures in the tables in subclause 4.2.1.3 into spectral
> density values, in that only part of the power of the carrier is used as the
> relative reference, and in addition different measurement bandwidths are
> applied at different offsets from the carrier. Appropriate conversion
> factors for this purpose are given in 3GPP TS 45.050.
For the BTS, the power level is the "actual absolute output power" defined in
subclause 4.1.2. If the power level falls between two of the values in the
tables in subclause 4.2.1.3, the requirement shall be determined by linear
interpolation.
#### 4.2.1.2 Additional requirements for multicarrier BTS
In case of multicarrier BTS, the requirements for spectrum due to modulation
and wideband noise are based on the superposition of the single carrier
spectrum requirements for all active carriers taking the different frequency
offsets from each carrier into account. In addition to the measurements on a
single carrier (4.2.1.1), the output spectrum shall be measured for frequency
offsets between 400 kHz above the uppermost and below the lowermost carrier,
respectively, and 10 MHz outside the transmit band with all carriers operating
at full power at minimum carrier frequency spacing as well as with the
carriers distributed across the declared maximum Base Station RF bandwidth as
described in 3GPP TS 51.021 [18], specified for the BSS configuration under
test. The following requirements apply:
> \- Depending on the active carrier number N, for frequency offsets higher
> than or equal to 1.8 MHz, the value of the spectrum due to modulation and
> wideband noise given for the measurement with single carrier may not
> increase by more than calculated from the expression 10∙log (N) dB, or
> fulfil the requirement according to the applicable multicarrier BTS class in
> subclause 4.7.2, whichever less stringent.
>
> \- For frequency offsets less than 1.8 MHz, the unwanted emission must not
> exceed a mask defined by the cumulation of the spectrum due to modulation
> and wideband noise from each carrier as well as the possibly occurring IM
> products.
>
> \- In addition, a number of allowable exceptions are defined as stated in
> vi) and vii).
NOTE: This approach has been chosen to limit the wideband noise in the
multicarrier operation by aligning with the performance of normal BTSs
transmitting several carriers. These BTSs use combiner stages to feed the
antenna which leads to a degradation of the noise performance at the antenna
in the way as specified above. Above 1.8 MHz frequency offset a generic
expression as stated above is applied. For a frequency offset below 1.8 MHz
there is no corresponding simple generic expression as the spectrum will be
dependent on the output power, carrier spacing as well as the number of active
carriers.
In case of non-contiguous frequency allocation and a multicarrier BTS
supporting non-contiguous frequency allocations as defined in clause 3,
spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise shall be measured for frequency
offsets above the uppermost carrier and frequency offsets below the lowermost
carrier as specified above depending on the total number of active carriers N.
In addition it shall be measured inbetween the two frequency groups with the
first frequency group located at carrier frequency A and lower frequencies and
a second frequency group located at carrier frequency B and higher
frequencies, where the bandwidth (B -- A) specifies the bandwidth between the
innermost carriers A and B. The following requirements apply for the range
between the two frequency groups:
\- Depending on the active carrier number N, for frequency offsets higher than
or equal to 1.8 MHz both above the uppermost carrier A of the lower frequency
group and below the lowermost carrier B of the upper frequency group the value
of the spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise given for the measurement
of the closest carrier of the innermost carriers A and B may not increase by
more than calculated from the expression 10∙log (N) dB, or fulfil the
requirement according to the applicable multicarrier BTS class in subclause
4.7.2, whichever less stringent.
\- For frequency offsets less than 1.8 MHz above the uppermost carrier A of
the lower frequency group or below the lowermost carrier B of the upper
frequency group, the unwanted emission must not exceed a mask defined by the
cumulation of the spectrum due to modulation and wideband noise from each of
the N carriers and the IM products.
\- In addition, a number of allowable exceptions are defined as stated in vii)
and viii).
#### 4.2.1.3 Tables for spectrum requirements due to modulation and wideband
noise
Two types of requirements are specified, depending on symbol-rate and pulse-
shaping filter used:
> Case 1: Normal symbol rate using linearised GMSK pulse-shaping filter and
> higher symbol rate using spectrally narrow pulse shaping filter
>
> Case 2: Higher symbol rate using spectrally wide pulse shaping filter
For definition of pulse-shaping filters, see 3GPP TS 45.004.
The spectrally narrow pulse shaping filter in Case 1 and the spectrally wide
pulse shaping filter in Case 2 are in this specification referred to as narrow
and wide pulse shaping filter respectively.

### 4.2.2 Spectrum due to switching transients
#### 4.2.2.1 General requirements
Those effects are also measured in the time domain and the specifications
assume the following measurement conditions: zero frequency scan, filter
bandwidth 30 kHz, peak hold, and video bandwidth 100 kHz.
In case of the multicarrier BTS class, the measurement of the switching
transients outside the BTS transmit band is covered by a measurement procedure
stated in subclause 4.3 (Spurious emissions). For measurements of switching
transients inside the transmit band, the measurement is performed with a
single active carrier at maximum declared power..
The example of a waveform due to a burst as seen in a 30 kHz filter offset
from the carrier is given thereunder (figure 1).

The limits specified thereunder are based on a 5‑pole synchronously tuned
measurement filter.
In addition to the requirements of this section, the PCS 1 900 & MXM 1900 BTS
and PCS 1 900 MS shall also comply with the applicable limits for spurious
emissions established by the FCC rules for wideband PCS services [FCC Title 47
CFR Part 24].
In addition to the requirements of this section, the GSM 850 & MXM 850 BTS and
GSM 850 MS shall also comply with the applicable limits for spurious emissions
established by the FCC rules for public mobile services [FCC Part 22, Subpart
H].
In addition to the requirements of this section, the GSM 700 BTS and GSM 700
MS shall also comply with the applicable limits for spurious emissions
established by the FCC [FCC Part 27, Subpart C, Section 27.53].
> Note: This may introduce more stringent requirements than specified in this
> subclause for frequency bands dedicated for public safety services.
### 4.3.1 Principle of the specification
In this subclause, the spurious transmissions (whether modulated or
unmodulated) and the switching transients are specified together by measuring
the peak power in a given bandwidth at various frequencies. The bandwidth is
increased as the frequency offset between the measurement frequency and,
either the carrier, or the edge of the MS or BTS transmit band, increases. The
effect for spurious signals of widening the measurement bandwidth is to reduce
the allowed total spurious energy per MHz. The effect for switching transients
is to effectively reduce the allowed level of the switching transients (the
peak level of a switching transient increases by 6 dB for each doubling of the
measurement bandwidth). The conditions are specified in the tables 4.3-1 and
4.3-2, a peak‑hold measurement being assumed.
In case of multicarrier BTS, instead of a peak-hold measurement an average
measurement is assumed.
Furthermore, the measurement configuration as defined in 4.2.1 for
multicarrier BTS shall be applied.
The measurement conditions for radiated and conducted spurious are specified
separately in 3GPP TS 51.010 and 3GPP TS 51.02x series. The frequency bands
where these are actually measured may differ from one type to the other (see
3GPP TS 51.010 and 3GPP TS 51.02x series).

the value of the measurement bandwidth in the table, and for the video
bandwidth to approximately three times this value.

> c) Relation to definitions and requirements in CEPT/ERC/REC 74-01 and ITU-R
> SM.329
In this subclause for all equipment the term Spurious emission out-of-band is
used for all spurious transmissions outside the relevant transmit band
(whether modulated or unmodulated), comprised of contributions from noise,
intermodulation and non-harmonic emissions. For multicarrier BTS the
definition of the requirements are aligned with the definitions in ITU-R
SM.329 [34] and REC 74-01 in that
\- Unwanted emissions in multicarrier operation are specified in subclause
4.2.1 (including the reference to intermodulation subclause 4.7.2) in present
specification, both for inband and out-of band emissions from 0 MHz up to 2*BW
frequency offset from edge of relevant transmit frequency band.
\- Minimum required frequency allocation for each operator is assumed to be 5
MHz, i.e. BW is 5 MHz.
\- Spurious emissions according to REC 74-01 definition are specified in
subclause 4.3.2 from 2*BW = 10 MHz and higher frequency offsets. The 10 MHz
spurious domain boundary applies also for larger transmitter bandwidths.
\- In addition there is an upper limit for the unwanted emissions from 0 to 10
MHz frequency offset outside the relavant transmit band edge according to
4.3.2.1.
\- The relevant transmit bands are defined in clause 2.
### 4.3.2 Base Transceiver Station
#### 4.3.2.1 General requirements
i) The power measured in the conditions specified in subclause 4.3.1a shall be
no more than ‑36 dBm. In case of multicarrier BTS, the requirements in
subclause 4.2.1 for single carrier operation apply for the case of declared
maximum output power.
ii) The power measured in the conditions specified in subclause 4.3.1b shall
be no more than:

In case of multicarrier BTS, for frequency offsets between 0 and 10 MHz, the
most stringent requirements of the requirements in the table above and the
requirements in subclause 4.2.1 for multicarrier BTS with more than one
carrier active apply.
In addition, applicable protection of critical services, in frequency bands
outside the relevant TX band needs to be considered and measures taken to
assure uninterrupted operation, according to additional requirements as
defined by the regional regulator.
> NOTE 1: For radiated spurious emissions for BTS, the specifications
> currently only apply to the frequency band 30 MHz to 4 GHz. The
> specification and method of measurement outside this band are under
> consideration.
iii) In the BTS receive band, the power measured using the conditions
specified in subclause 4.2.1, with a filter and video bandwidth of 100 kHz
shall be no more than :

These values assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver. If
BTSs of different classes are co‑sited, the coupling loss must be increased by
the difference between the corresponding values from the table above.
iv) In case of BTSs belonging to a multicarrier BTS class, the measurement of
the spurious emissions outside the BTS transmit band shall be conducted for
the case of maximum supported number of carriers at maximum nominal power for
each carrier while performing burst on/off keying. For measurements inside the
relevant transmit band the measurement conditions and requirement in 4.2.1
regarding operation with one carrier active apply.

## 4.4 Radio frequency tolerance
The radio frequency tolerance for the base transceiver station and the MS is
defined in 3GPP TS 45.010.
## 4.5 Output level dynamic operation
> NOTE: The term "any transmit band channel" is used here to mean:
>
> \- any RF channel of 200 kHz bandwidth centred on a multiple of 200 kHz
> which is within the relevant transmit band.
### 4.5.1 Base Transceiver Station
The BTS shall be capable of not transmitting a burst in a time slot not used
by a logical channel or where DTX applies. The output power relative to time
when sending a burst is shown in annex B. The reference level 0 dB corresponds
to the output power level according to subclause 4\. In the case where the
bursts in two (or several) consecutive time slots are actually transmitted, at
the same frequency, the template of annex B shall be respected during the
useful part of each burst and at the beginning and the end of the series of
consecutive bursts. The output power during the guard period between every two
consecutive active timeslots shall not exceed the level allowed for the useful
part of the first timeslot, or the level allowed for the useful part of the
second timeslot plus 3 dB, whichever is the highest. The residual output
power, if a timeslot is not activated, shall be maintained at, or below, a
level of ‑30 dBc on the frequency channel in use. All emissions related to
other frequency channels shall be in accordance with the wide band noise and
spurious emissions requirements.
A measurement bandwidth of at least 300 kHz is assumed.
### 4.5.2 Mobile Station
The output power can be reduced by steps of 2 dB as listed in subclause 4.1.
The transmitted power level relative to time when sending a burst is shown in
annex B. The reference level 0 dB corresponds to the output power level
according to subclause 4. In the case of Multislot Configurations where the
bursts in two or more consecutive time slots are actually transmitted at the
same frequency, the template of annex B shall be respected during the useful
part of each burst and at the beginning and the end of the series of
consecutive bursts. The output power during the period between the useful
parts of every two consecutive active timeslots shall not exceed the level
allowed for the useful part of the first timeslot, or the level allowed for
the useful part of the second timeslot plus 3 dB, whichever is the highest. As
an exception, in the case of a normal burst being transmitted with a high
timing advance immediately after an access burst, a minimum of 8.25 symbol
guard period shall be allowed for the MS power ramping and the useful part
requirements for the concerned bursts are allowed to be adjusted
correspondingly. The timing of the transmitted burst is specified in 3GPP TS
45.010. Between the active bursts, the residual output power shall be
maintained at, or below, the level of:
> ‑ ‑59 dBc or ‑54 dBm, whichever is the greater for GSM 400, GSM 900, ER-GSM
> 900, GSM 850 and GSM 700, except for the time slot preceding the active
> slot, for which the allowed level is ‑59 dBc or ‑36 dBm whichever is the
> greater;
>
> ‑ ‑48 dBc or ‑48 dBm, whichever is the greater for DCS 1 800 and PCS 1 900;
in any transmit band channel.
A measurement bandwidth of at least 300 kHz is assumed.
The transmitter, when in idle mode, will respect the conditions of subclause
4.3.3.
## 4.6 Modulation accuracy
### 4.6.1 GMSK modulation
When transmitting a burst, the phase accuracy of the signal, relative to the
theoretical modulated waveforms as specified in 3GPP TS 45.004, is specified
in the following way.
For any 148‑bits subsequence of the 511‑bits pseudo‑random sequence, defined
in CCITT Recommendation O.153 fascicle IV.4, the phase error trajectory on the
useful part of the burst (including tail bits), shall be measured by computing
the difference between the phase of the transmitted waveform and the phase of
the expected one. The RMS phase error (difference between the phase error
trajectory and its linear regression on the active part of the time slot)
shall not be greater than 5° with a maximum peak deviation during the useful
part of the burst less than 20°.
> NOTE: Using the encryption (ciphering mode) is an allowed means to generate
> the pseudo‑random sequence.
The burst timing of the modulated carrier in the active part of the time slot
shall be chosen to ensure that all the modulating bits in the useful part of
the burst (see 3GPP TS 45.004) influence the output phase in a time slot.
### 4.6.2 QPSK, AQPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM modulations
The modulation accuracy is defined by the error vector between the vector
representing the actual transmitted signal and the vector representing the
error-free modulated signal. The magnitude of the error vector is called Error
Vector Magnitude (EVM). For definition of the different measures of EVM, see
annex G.
When transmitting a burst, the magnitude of the error vector of the signal,
relative to the theoretical modulated waveforms as specified in 3GPP TS
45.004, is specified in the following way.
The magnitude of the error vector shall be computed by measuring the error
vector between the vector representing the transmitted waveform and the vector
representing the ideal one on the useful part of the burst (excluding tail
symbols). When measuring the error vector a receive filter at baseband shall
be used, defined as
\- a raised-cosine filter with roll-off 0,25 and single side-band 6 dB
bandwidth 90 kHz for normal symbol rate and for higher symbol-rate using
narrow pulse-shaping filter.
\- a raised-cosine filter with roll-off 0,25 and single side-band 6 dB
bandwidth 108 kHz for higher symbol-rate using wide pulse-shaping filter.
The measurement filter is windowed by multiplying its impulse response by a
raised cosine window given as:
where _T_ is the normal symbol period.
The transmitted waveforms shall be Normal Bursts for QPSK, AQPSK, 8-PSK,
16-QAM and 32-QAM as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002, with encrypted bits generated
using consecutive bits from the 32767 bit length pseudo random sequence
defined in ITU-T Recommendation O.151 (1992).
#### 4.6.2.1 RMS EVM
##### 4.6.2.1.1 MS requirements
When transmitting a burst, the magnitude of the error vector of the signal,
relative to the theoretical modulated waveforms as specified in 3GPP TS
45.004, is specified in the following way:
> \- The RMS EVM per burst is measured under the duration of at least 200
> bursts.
>
> \- The measured RMS EVM over the useful part of any burst, excluding tail
> bits, shall not exceed;

The RMS EVM per burst is measured under the duration of at least 200 bursts.
#### 4.6.2.2 Origin Offset Suppression
The origin offset shall be measured over at least 200 bursts. For each burst a
value shall be calculated using the formula for the origin offset suppression
shown in annex G, but before taking the logarithm the average over the number
of bursts shall be computed. Then this average shall be transferred to dB
scale and the resulting origin offset suppression shall exceed
\- 30 dB for MS and
\- 35 dB for all types of BTS
under normal and extreme conditions.
#### 4.6.2.3 Peak EVM
The peak value of EVM is the peak error deviation within a burst, measured at
each symbol interval, averaged over at least 200 bursts to reflect the
transient nature of the peak deviation. The bursts shall have a minimum
distance in time of 7 idle timeslots between them. The peak EVM values are

EVM values are acquired during the useful part of the burst, excluding tail
bits, over 200 bursts.

### 4.6.3 Phase and amplitude coherency when using blind physical layer
transmissions
#### 4.6.3.1 General
Phase and amplitude coherency for blind physical layer transmissions is
achieved by repeating a Tx burst in subsequent timeslots with the same
amplitude and phase. As an exception, different USF values are allowed in
different DL timeslots.
No coherency of blind physical layer transmissions between TDMA frames is
required.
#### 4.6.3.2 EC-GSM-IoT MS
Using the same pseudo‑random encrypted bits in all active timeslots, the error
vector of the useful part of the burst (including tail bits), shall be
measured by computing the difference between the phase and amplitude of any
two bursts of the blind physical layer transmissions over consecutive
timeslots within a given TDMA frame.
The normalized coherency error ({width="0.23333333333333334in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}) is defined in Annex S.
The {width="0.23333333333333334in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} between any
two bursts of the blind physical layer transmissions transmitted over
consecutive timeslots in CC2, CC3, CC4 shall not exceed -23 dB at received
signal levels from the maximum applicable level for NER, specified for static
conditions at a bit error rate of 10^-3^ in subclause 6.1.1.2, down to the
reference sensitivity level of EC-SCH, see table 1aa. For CC5 EC-RACH using
EDAB the {width="0.23333333333333334in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}
between first 82 symbols of the first burst and first 82 symbols of the second
burst shall not exceed -23dB at received signal levels from the maximum
applicable level for NER, specified for static conditions at a bit error rate
of 10^-3^ in subclause 6.1.1.2, down to the reference sensitivity level of EC-
SCH, see table 1aa.
The phase and amplitude coherency requirement applies to the 2 TS EC-RACH
mapping for CC2 to CC4, CC5 using EDAB format, EC-PDTCH, EC-PDTCH/2TS, EC-
PACCH and EC-PACCH/2TS, see 3GPP TS 45.002 for how the bursts of a block for a
specific logical channel are mapped onto the physical channel(s). The
requirement applies for any given Overlaid CDMA code assigned, see 3GPP TS
44.018.
#### 4.6.3.3 BTS supporting EC-GSM-IoT
Phase and amplitude coherency for blind physical layer transmissions according
to subclause 4.6.3.1 is required for EC-PDTCH and EC-PACCH (see subclause
4.1.2 d) as well as EC-PDTCH/2TS and EC-PACCH/2TS.
## 4.7 Intermodulation attenuation
The intermodulation attenuation is the ratio of the power level of the wanted
signal to the power level of an intermodulation component. It is a measure of
the capability of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its
non‑linear elements caused by the presence of the carrier and an interfering
signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna, or by non linear combining
and amplification of multiple carriers.
### 4.7.1 Base transceiver station
An interfering CW signal shall be applied to the transmit antenna port, within
the relevant BTS TX band at a frequency offset of ≥ 800 kHz, and with a power
level 30 dB below the power level of the wanted signal.
The intermodulation products shall meet the requirements in subclause 4.7.2.
### 4.7.2 Intra BTS intermodulation attenuation
In a BTS intermodulation may be caused by combining several RF channels or
amplification of multiple carriers to feed a single antenna, or when operating
them in the close vicinity of each other.
\- i) The BTS shall be configured with each transmitter operating at the
maximum allowed power, with a full complement of transceivers and with
modulation applied.\ _The requirement specified for the multicarrier BTS shall
apply for all supported configurations of the multicarrier BTS independently
of the number of active carriers, assuming equal power distribution between
all carriers, and independently of the modulation type._
_\- ii)_ For the measurement in the transmit band the equipment shall be
operated at equal and minimum carrier frequency spacing as well as with the
carriers distributed across the declared maximum Base Station RF bandwidth as
described in 3GPP TS 51.021 [18], specified for the BSS configuration under
test.
\- iii) For the measurement in the receive band the equipment shall be
operated with such a channel configuration that at least 3^rd^ order
intermodulation products fall into the receive band.
#### 4.7.2.1 GSM 400, GSM 900, ER-GSM 900, DCS 1800
##### 4.7.2.1.1 Requirements for BTS except multicarrier BTS
All the following requirements relate to frequency offsets from the uppermost
and lowermost carriers. The peak hold value of intermodulation components over
a timeslot, shall not exceed ‑70 dBc or ‑36 dBm, whichever is the less
stringent, for frequency offsets between 6 MHz and the edge of the relevant Tx
band measured in a 300 kHz bandwidth. 1 in 100 timeslots may fail this test by
up to a level of 10 dB. For offsets between 600 kHz to 6 MHz the requirements
and the measurement technique is that specified in subclause 4.2.1.
The other requirements of subclause 4.3.2 in the band 9 kHz to 12,75 GHz shall
still be met.
##### 4.7.2.1.2 Requirements for multicarrier BTS
In case of multicarrier BTS, the average power measured in a 600 kHz band
centered at the centre frequency of intermodulation components over a timeslot
shall not exceed -70 dBc or limit specified in table 4.7-1, or the
requirements specified in subclause 4.2.1, whichever is less stringent, for
frequency offsets between 0.6 MHz from the outermost carrier and 10 MHz
outside the edge of the relevant Tx band. In addition in a 600 kHz band
centered at the centre frequencies of the third order intermodulation
components the power of the intermodulation components may increase up to -60
dBc or -36 dBm, whichever is less stringent. The measurement bandwidth for
both the carrier and the intermodulation products is 300 kHz for offsets
larger than 6 MHz, 100 kHz for offsets between 1.8 and 6 MHz and 30 kHz for
offsets below 1.8 MHz.

Maximum power\ Measured IM\ per carrier power
> 33 dBm -36 dBm
> 24 dBm and\ -41 dBm ≤ 33 dBm
≤ 24 dBm -46 dBm
* * *
For multicarrier BTS the intermodulation products shall never exceed -16 dBm,
measured in 100 kHz bandwidth, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329, s4.3
and Annex 7.
The other requirements of subclause 4.3.2 in the band 9 kHz to 12,75 GHz shall
still be met.
#### 4.7.2.2 MXM 850 and MXM 1900
The following requirements apply to MXM 850 and MXM 1900 BTSs which include
ANSI-136 [TIA/EIA‑136‑C] 30 kHz carriers, in addition to the 200 kHz carriers
specified in the present document. All the following requirements relate to
frequency offsets from the uppermost and lowermost carriers. The average value
of intermodulation components, for frequency offsets > 1,2 MHz to the edge of
the relevant Tx band, shall not exceed:
a) -60 dBc, measured in a 30 kHz bandwidth, relative to the average power of
the 30 kHz channel carrier, measured in a 30 kHz bandwidth, using normal power
averaging (per [TIA/EIA-136-C] part 280), and
b) -60 dBc, measured in a 200 kHz bandwidth, relative to the 200 kHz carrier
average power, measured in a 300 kHz bandwidth and averaged over a timeslot.
In addition to the requirements of this section, the MXM 850 BTS and MXM 1900
BTS shall also comply with the applicable limits for spurious emissions
established by the FCC rules for public mobile services [FCC Part 22, Subpart
H] and FCC rules for wideband PCS services [FCC Title 47 CFR Part 24]
respectively.
> NOTE 1: In some areas, to avoid uncoordinated system impacts, it may be
> beneficial to use a more stringent value.\ -70 dBc rms is suggested.
>
> NOTE 2: For testing reasons, a MXM 1900 normal BTS fulfilling the PCS 1900
> normal BTS requirements or a MXM 850 normal BTS fulfilling GSM 850 normal
> BTS requirements in this subclause may be considered fulfilling the
> requirements for MXM 1900 normal BTS or MXM 850 normal BTS respectively.
#### 4.7.2.3 GSM 700, GSM 850 and PCS 1900
##### a) Requirements for BTS except multicarrier BTS
All the following requirements relate to frequency offsets from the uppermost
and lowermost carriers. For frequency offsets > 1,8 MHz to the edge of the
relevant Tx band, measured in 300 kHz bandwidth the average value of
intermodulation components over a timeslot shall not exceed ‑70 dBc relative
to the per carrier power or ‑46 dBm, whichever is the less stringent. For
offsets between 600 kHz and 1,8 MHz, the measurement technique and
requirements are those specified in subclause 4.2.1, except for offsets
between 1,2 MHz and 1,8 MHz, where the value of intermodulation components
shall not exceed the requirements in subclause 4.2.1 or --70 dBc whichever
less stringent.
The other requirements of subclause 4.3.2 in the band 9 kHz to 12,75 GHz shall
still be met.
In regions where additional protection between uncoordinated systems is
required by national regulatory agencies, the intermodulation components for
frequency offsets > 1,2 MHz may be up to --60 dBc, if not violating the
national regulation requirements.
##### b) Requirements for multicarrier BTS
In case of multicarrier BTS, the average power measured in a 600 kHz band
centered at centre frequency of intermodulation components over a timeslot
shall not exceed -70 dBc or limit specified in table 4.7-1, or the
requirements specified in subclause 4.2.1, whichever is less stringent, for
frequency offsets between 0.6 MHz from the outermost carrier and 10 MHz
outside the edge of the relevant Tx band. In addition, in a 600 kHz band
centered at the centre frequencies of the third order intermodulation
components the power of the intermodulation components may increase up to -60
dBc or -36 dBm, whichever is less stringent. The measurement bandwidth for
both the carrier and the intermodulation products is 300 kHz for offsets
larger than 6 MHz, 100 kHz for offsets between 1.8 and 6 MHz and 30 kHz for
offsets below 1.8 MHz.The intermodulation products shall never exceed -16 dBm,
measured in 100 kHz bandwidth, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329, sub-
clause 4.3 and Annex 7.
The other requirements of subclause 4.3.2 in the band 9 kHz to 12,75 GHz shall
still be met.
##### c) Additional requirements for all BTS
The PCS 1900, GSM 850 and GSM 700 BTS shall also comply with the applicable
limits for spurious emissions established by the FCC rules for wideband PCS
services [FCC Title 47 CFR Part 24], FCC rules for public mobile services [FCC
Part 22, Subpart H] and FCC rules for miscellaneous wireless communication
services [FCC Part 27, Subpart C] respectively, or similar national
requirements with comparable limits and rules.
### 4.7.3 Void
### 4.7.4 Mobile PBX (GSM 900 only)
In a mobile PBX intermodulation may be caused when operating transmitters in
the close vicinity of each other. The intermodulation specification for mobile
PBXs (GSM 900 only) shall be that stated in subclause 4.7.2.
# 5 Receiver characteristics
In this clause, the requirements are given in terms of power levels at the
antenna connector of the receiver. Equipment with integral antenna may be
taken into account by converting these power level requirements into field
strength requirements, assuming a 0 dBi gain antenna. This means that the
tests on equipment on integral antenna will consider fields strengths I
related to the power levels (P) specified, by the following formula (derived
from the formula E = P + 20logF(MHz) + 77,2):
> assuming F = 405 MHz : E (dBµV/m) = P (dBm) + 129,3 for T-GSM 380 and T-GSM
> 410;
>
> assuming F = 460 MHz : E (dBµV/m) = P (dBm) + 130,5 for GSM 400;
>
> assuming F = 722 MHz : E (dBµV/m) = P (dBm) + 134,4 for GSM 710;
>
> assuming F = 770 MHz : E (dBµV/m) = P (dBm) + 134,9 for GSM 750;
>
> assuming F = 831 MHz : E (dBµV/m) = P (dBm) + 135,6 for T-GSM 810;
>
> assuming F = 859 MHz : E (dBµV/m) = P (dBm) + 135,9 for GSM 850;
>
> assuming F = 918 MHz : E (dBµV/m) = P (dBm) + 136,2 for ER-GSM 900;
>
> assuming F = 925 MHz : E (dBµV/m) = P (dBm) + 136,5 for GSM 900;
>
> assuming F = 1 795 MHz : E (dBµV/m) = P (dBm) + 142,3 for DCS 1 800;
>
> assuming F = 1 920 MHz : E (dBuV/m) = P (dBm) + 142,9 for PCS 1 900.
Static propagation conditions are assumed in all cases, for both wanted and
unwanted signals. For subclauses 5.1 and 5.2, values given in dBm are
indicative, and calculated assuming a 50 ohms impedance.
> NOTE: From a system perspective the over the air antenna performance is
> relevant. To determine the MS over the air performance the Total Radiated
> Sensitivity has been defined. Its definition can be found in 3GPP TS 25.144,
> and a test method is specified in 3GPP TS 34.114.

dBµV (emf) (‑43 dBm) in the out-of-band frequency range.
When more than one useful signal frequency is considered, the maximum number
of allowed occurrences for the spurious response frequencies applies
separately to each useful signal frequency.
In case of DLMC configuration, requirements for inter-band reception are only
defined in the out-of-band frequency region for band combinations (GSM 850,
PCS1900) and (GSM 900, DCS 1800). In this case, the requirements for each
frequency band apply using one useful signal in each band.
An MS indicating support for DLMC shall in addition to DLMC specific
performance requirements, comply to the requirements in Table 5.1-2a and Table
5.1-4.
> NOTE: For testing effort reasons, in case of DLMC configuration, and a MS

### 5.1.3 Requirements for BTS
The reference sensitivity performance as specified in tables 1, 1a, 1b and 1d,
adjusted by the correction factors of table 6.2-4,shall be met when the
following signals are simultaneously input to the receiver:
\- for BTS excluding multicarrier BTS equipped with multicarrier receiver on
all frequency bands, excluding normal BTS on the GSM 700 and GSM 850 bands,
and excluding MXM 850 and MXM 1900 normal BTS, a useful signal, modulated with
the relevant supported modulation (GMSK or 8-PSK), at frequency fo, 3 dB above
the reference sensitivity level or input level for reference performance,
whichever applicable, as specified in subclause 6.2.
\- for normal BTS and multicarrier BTS equipped with multicarrier receiver on
the GSM 700 and GSM 850 bands and MXM 850 and MXM 1900 normal BTS, a useful
signal, modulated with the relevant supported modulation (GMSK or 8-PSK),
symbol rate and specified pulse shaping filter, at frequency fo, 1 dB above
the reference sensitivity level or input level for reference performance,
whichever applicable, as specified in subclause 6.2.
\- for multicarrier BTS equipped with multicarrier receiver on all frequency
bands excluding multicarrier BTS on the GSM 700 and GSM 850 bands, a useful
signal, modulated with the relevant supported modulation (GMSK or 8-PSK), at
frequency fo, at a signal level according to table 5.1-2a.2 above the

whichever applicable, as specified in subclause 6.2
\- a continuous, static sine wave signal at a level as in the table 5.1-2a

normal BTS and multicarrier BTS on the GSM 700 and GSM 850 bands, and MXM 850
and MXM 1900 normal BTS at inband frequency offsets ≥ 3 000 kHz this signal is
GMSK modulated by any 148‑bit sequence of the 511‑bit pseudo random bit
sequence, defined in CCITT Recommendation O.153 fascicle IV.4,

> occurrences (which if grouped shall not exceed three contiguous occurrences
> per group);
GSM 400 BTS: in band, for a maximum of three occurrences;
out of band, for a maximum of 24 occurrences (which if below f0 and grouped
shall not exceed three contiguous occurrences per group).
Where the above performance shall be met when the continuous sine wave signal
(f) is set to a level of 70 dBµV (emf) (i.e. ‑43 dBm).
If more than one wanted signal frequency is considered, the maximum number of
allowed occurrences for the spurious response frequencies applies separately
to each wanted signal frequency.
In case of multicarrier BTS equipped with multicarrier receiver the
requirements apply when up to the maximum number of supported useful,
modulated input signals with equal power level, at least separated by minimum
carrier frequency spacing, is simultaneously received within the declared
maximum Base Station RF bandwidth.
> NOTE: For testing reasons, a MXM 1900 normal BTS fulfilling the PCS 1900
> normal BTS requirements in this paragraph may be considered fulfilling the
> requirements for MXM 1900 normal BTS.

### 5.3.2 Requirements for BTS
The reference sensitivity performance as specified in tables 1, 1a, 1b and 1d,
adjusted by the correction factors of table 6.2-4, shall be met when the
following signals are simultaneously input to the receiver:
> ‑ a useful signal, modulated with the relevant supported modulation (GMSK,

> (emf) (i.e. ‑49 dBm);
such that f0 = 2f1 -- f2 and \|f2‑f1 \| = 800 kHz.
For a multicarrier BTS equipped with multicarrier receiver, interfering
signals shall be adjusted by 0 dB, +2 dB or +5 dB for the Wide Area, Medium
Range and Local Area classes, respectively.
> NOTE: For subclauses 5.2 and 5.3 instead of any 148‑bits subsequence of the
> 511‑bits pseudo‑random sequence, defined in CCITT Recommendation O.153

specified in subclause 4.3.1, shall be no more than:
> ‑ 2 nW (‑57 dBm) in the frequency band 9 kHz to 1 GHz;
>
> ‑ 20 nW (‑47 dBm) in the frequency band 1 GHz to 12.75 GHz.
>
> NOTE: For radiated spurious emissions for the BTS, the specifications
> currently only apply to the frequency band 30 MHz to 4 GHz. The
> specification and method of measurement outside this band are under
> consideration.
# 6 Transmitter/receiver performance
This clause aims at specifying the receiver performance, taking into account
that transmitter errors must not occur, and that the transmitter shall be
tested separately (see subclause 4.6). All the values given are valid if any
of the features: discontinuous transmission (DTx), discontinuous reception
(DRx), or slow frequency hopping (SFH) are used or not. The received power
levels under multipath fading conditions given are the mean powers of the sum
of the individual paths.
## 6.1a MS conditions
In order to assess the error rate performance that is described in this clause
it is required for a mobile equipment to have a "loop back" facility by which
the equipment transmits back the same information that it decoded, in the same
mode. This facility is specified in 3GPP TS 44.014. In this clause power
levels are given also in terms of field strength, assuming a 0 dBi gain
antenna, to apply for the test of MS with integral antennas.
The requirements specified in this clause shall be met by a MS in CTS mode. In
particular the requirement of subclause 6.6 on frequency hopping performance
shall be met by a MS performing CTS frequency hopping (as specified in 3GPP TS
45.002 subclause 6.2).
The requirements for the receiver performance in non-static channels with
16QAM, 32QAM and QPSK modulations are specified for training sequence 6
(TSC-6, as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002).
In case of VAMOS mode, one of the _VAMOS subchannels_ (see 3GPP TS 45.001)
shall use training sequence 5 from TSC set 1 (and is referred to as _VAMOS
subchannel 1_) and the other _VAMOS subchannel_ shall use training sequence 5
from TSC set 2 (and is referred to as _VAMOS subchannel 2_). The requirements
for the receiver performance for speech and control channels in VAMOS mode
shall be met on VAMOS subchannel 1 and VAMOS subchannel 2 when the values of
SCPIR_DL specified in tables 1s, 1t, 1u, 1x, 1y, 2aa, 2ab and 2ag are used for
the AQPSK signal.
An EC-GSM-IoT MS only needs to support packet-switched service. Support of
modulation- and coding schemes MCS-1 is mandatory for Coverage Class CC1 using
one PDCH per TDMA frame and for Coverage Classes CC2, CC3 and CC4 using 4
consecutive PDCHs per TDMA frame (EC-PDTCH) as well as for Coverage Classes
CC2, CC3, CC4 and CC5 using 2 consecutive PDCHs per TDMA frame (EC-PDTCH/2TS).
Support of MCS-1' is mandatory for uplink Coverage Class CC5. Other GMSK
modulation- and coding schemes, MCS-2, MCS-3 and MCS-4 shall be supported only
in CC1. The support of 8-PSK modulation- and coding schemes is optional and
restricted to CC1.\ An EC-GSM-IoT MS shall fulfil the requirements in
subclauses 5.1.2, 5.2.1 and 5.3.1, applying coding scheme MCS-1 and associated
reference sensitivity performance, derived from table 1a.
For a MS indicating support for DLMC the following applies for the
requirements specified in this subclause and in clause 5:
> In case of a DLMC configuration, DLMC specific requirements apply, except
>
> \- whenever the maximum supported carrier frequency spacing only allows for
> a single carrier to be received in a given radio block period, see 3GPP TS
> 45.002.
>
> \- when fallback to single carrier reception is performed, see 3GPP TS
> 45.002. In case of inter-band reception, the requirements only apply for the
> carrier in the frequency band on which the fallback is performed
>
> \- when PTCCH/D is being received,
>
> in which case the requirements not specific to DLMC apply.
In case of MS in DLMC configuration, the stated performance at each receive
antenna port shall be achieved for any of the wanted input signals at the
specified power level when receiving up to the supported maximum number of
downlink carriers at equal power within the maximum supported DLMC carrier
frequency spacing. The required receiver resources for the supported maximum
number of downlink carriers (see 3GPP TS 24.008) shall be allocated and
activated simultaneously, distributed over maximum supported DLMC frequency
spacing during the complete test.
> NOTE: When testing for compliance of DLMC specific performance requirements,
> the applied input signals may, when appropriate, be limited to two useful
> signals with equal power for requirements in subclause 5.1 and 5.2, and one
> useful signal for requirements in clause 6, unless otherwise stated.
For a MS supporting DLMC the signalled Maximum Bandwidth, see 3GPP TS 24.008,
corresponds to a maximum supported DLMC carrier frequency spacing as shown in
Table 6a-1.
Table 6a-1. Nominal maximum supported DLMC carrier frequency spacing.
* * *
**Maximum DLMC Bandwidth (MHz)** **5 MHz** **10 MHz** **15 MHz** **20 MHz**
**Maximum supported DLMC carrier frequency spacing / Number of GSM channels**
4.2 MHz/22 8.8 MHz/45 13.2 MHz/67 18 MHz /91
* * *
For a MS indicating support for DLMC, no separate requirements apply for
inter-band reception unless otherwise stated.
For a MS indicating support for non-contiguous intra-band reception,
requirements additionally apply at carrier spacings larger than the maximum
supported DLMC carrier frequency spacing, with carrier frequency spacing in
each of the two carrier groups separated by at most the maximum supported DLMC
carrier frequency spacing.
> NOTE: There are no requirements defined for EGPRS2-B for DLMC configuration.
## 6.1b BTS conditions
In the case of base transceiver stations the values apply for measurement at
the connection with the antenna of the BTS, including any external
multicoupler.
The Rx performance requirements of BTS for modulation schemes using higher
symbol rate are based on input signals using wide pulse shaping filter unless
otherwise stated. When the wanted input signal is such a signal, it is called
Wanted signal Wide.
When the wanted input signal for BTS is using the higher symbol rate with
narrow pulse shaping filter, it is called Wanted signal Narrow.
For channels with higher symbol rate the requirements for BTS for non-static
propagation conditions are specified with RX diversity with two antennas
applied and without RX diversity in the cases where the BTS has only one
antenna port. The RX diversity requirements are specified for no correlation
or gain imbalance between the two receive branches.
The requirements for the receiver performance in non-static channels with
16QAM, 32QAM and QPSK modulations are specified for training sequence 6
(TSC-6, as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002).
For speech and control channels in VAMOS mode, the requirements for BTS are
specified only for non-static propagation conditions. These requirements are
with RX diversity with two antennas with no correlation or gain imbalance
between the two receive branches.
Unless explicitly stated, the requirements specified for GMSK modulated
channels are applicable only for channels that are not in VAMOS mode.
In case of VAMOS mode, one of the _VAMOS subchannels_ shall use training
sequence 5 from TSC set 1 (and is referred to as _VAMOS subchannel 1_) and the
other _VAMOS subchannel_ shall use training sequence 5 from TSC set 2 (and is
referred to as _VAMOS subchannel 2_). For the cases where SCPIR is not equal
to 0 dB, the _VAMOS subchannel_ 2 shall have lower power than _VAMOS
subchannel_ 1.The requirements for the receiver performance for speech and
control channels in _VAMOS mode_ in tables 1v and 2ac are applicable for both
_VAMOS subchannels_ (see 3GPP TS 45.001).
A BTS supporting EC-GSM-IoT shall, in addition to fulfilling EGPRS
requirements, unless otherwise stated, fulfil the requirements for EC-channels
in at least coverage classes CC1 and CC4 (using 4 consecutive PDCHs per TDMA
frame without Overlaid CDMA). The BTS shall support 1 TS EC-RACH in CC1 and at
least one of 1 TS EC-RACH and 2 TS EC-RACH in Coverage Classes CC4. The BTS
may support at least one of 1 TS EC-RACH and 2 TS EC-RACH in Coverage Classes
CC2 and CC3, as well as 2 TS EC-RACH in CC5.\ The BTS requirements for EC-GSM-
IoT are defined with RX diversity with two antennas with uncorrelated fading
on fading channels and with equal gain between the two receive branches in
case of sensitivity and interference performance. For performance of Overlaid
CDMA the requirements are defined for single RX antenna configuration. The
other receiver performance requirements for EC-GSM-IoT, i.e. erroneous frame
indication performance (clause 6.4) and random access performance at high
input levels (clause 6.5) are defined for single RX antenna configuration.
The set of coverage classes supported, whether the BTS supports Overlaid CDMA
and in this case the number of subchannels supported, shall be included in the
manufacturer's declaration. The BTS shall support at least MCS-1 and MCS-1/16
for EC-PDTCH. The manufacturer shall also declare whether higher coverage
classes (CC2, CC3, CC4, CC5) using MCS-1 when mapped to 2 consecutive PDCHs
per TDMA frame are supported.
If Overlaid CDMA (see 3GPP TS 45.002 and 3GPP TS 45.004) is supported by the
BTS for EC-PDTCH and EC-PACCH, using 4 consecutive PDCHs per TDMA frame, and
two or more subchannels are assigned, the BTS shall be able to distinguish
between signals from up to 4 different assigned MSs on the same timeslot.
Performance is defined for two configurations of subchannel power imbalance
ratio on uplink (SCPIR_UL, see definition in subclause 1.3):
> \- 0 dB, i.e. all Overlaid CDMA subchannels are received with the same
> power.
>
> \- 9 dB in case of two users per timeslot, or, 3, 6, 9 dB in case of four
> users per timeslot, each SCPIR_UL applying to one of the subchannels 2 to 4.
If Overlaid CDMA is supported by the BTS for EC-PDTCH/2TS and EC-PACCH/2TS,
using 2 consecutive PDCHs per TDMA frame, and two subchannels are assigned,
the BTS shall be able to distinguish between signals from 2 different assigned
MSs on the same timeslot. Performance is defined for two configurations of
SCPIR_UL: 0 dB and 9 dB.
The requirements for the receiver performance for packet data and control
channels in table 1ad are applicable when in specified and supported coverage
class and the other subchannel(s) always is/are in CC2. Further, in the case
of two users per timeslot, the requirements are applicable when the two
subchannels are assigned Overlaid CDMA codes 0 and 1, respectively, and in the
case of four users per timeslot and SCPIR_UL setting equal to 3, 6, 9 dB, the
requirements are applicable when the weakest subchannel is assigned Overlaid
CDMA code 0, the second weakest subchannel is assigned Overlaid CDMA code 1,
the second strongest subchannel is assigned Overlaid CDMA code 2 and the
strongest subchannel is assigned Overlaid CDMA code 3.
> NOTE: For information, to facilitate the comparison of performance with and
> without Overlaid CDMA applied, a diversity gain of 5 dB may be subtracted
> from the input signal level requirements for Overlaid CDMA which are defined
> for single RX antenna configuration.
In case of multicarrier BTS equipped with multicarrier receiver, the stated
performance at each receiver antenna port connected to a multicarrier receiver
shall be achieved for any of the wanted input signals at the specified power
level when receiving up to the maximum supported number of wanted signals at
equal power within the declared maximum Base Station RF bandwidth at the
receiver antenna connector. The stated performance shall be achieved for
requirements specifying an input level of each wanted signal up to and
including ‑40 dBm. For requirements specifying a higher input level of each
wanted signal, the stated performance applies for the total peak input level
to the multicarrier BTS equipped with multicarrier receiver being not greater
than the peak level when receiving a single wanted carrier for the same
requirement. The stated performance shall be achieved provided that the
frequency spacing between each wanted signal and each other signal that is not
a dedicated interferer for that wanted signal is at least 600 kHz.
> NOTE: Minimum receiver performance requirements for multicarrier base
> station declared as multistandard radio base station are defined in Annex P.
## 6.1 Nominal Error Rates (NER)
This subclause describes the transmission requirements in terms of error rates
in nominal conditions i.e. without interference. The relevant propagation
conditions appear in annex C.
### 6.1.1 GMSK modulation
#### 6.1.1.1 General performance requirements
Under the following propagation conditions and with an input level of 20 dB
above the reference sensitivity level, the chip error rate, equivalent to the
bit error rate of the non protected bits (e.g., TCH/FS class II, TCH/AHS class
II or CS-4) shall have the following limits:
> ‑ static channel: BER ≤ 10‑4;
>
> ‑ EQ50 channel: BER ≤ 3 %;
except for GSM 400, where the following limits applies:
‑ static channel: BER ≤ 10‑4;
> ‑ EQ100 channel: BER ≤ 3 %;
and for GSM 700, where the following limits applies:
‑ static channel: BER ≤ 10‑4;
> ‑ EQ60 channel: BER ≤ 3 %.
#### 6.1.1.2 Requirements for MS
The performance in 6.1.1.1 shall be maintained up to ‑40 dBm input level for
static and multipath conditions.
In case of DLMC configuration, the performance shall be maintained up to -37
dBm of total input power, irrespective of the number of input signals.
This performance shall also be maintained by the MS under frequency hopping
conditions, for input levels up to ‑40 dBm in timeslots on the C0 carrier,
with equal input levels in timeslots on non C0 carriers up to 30 dB less than
on the C0 carrier.
> NOTE: This scenario may exist when BTS downlink power control and frequency
> hopping are used.
For static conditions, a bit error rate of 10^‑^3 shall also be maintained by
the MS under frequency hopping conditions, for input levels on the C0 carrier
of up to ‑15 dBm for GSM 400, GSM 900, ER-GSM 900, GSM 850 and GSM 700, ‑23
dBm for DCS 1 800 and PCS 1 900, with equal input levels on non C0 carriers,
up to 30 dB less than on the C0 carrier.
Furthermore, for static conditions, a bit error rate of 10^‑^3 shall be
maintained
> \- up to ‑15 dBm for GSM 400, GSM 900, ER-GSM 900, GSM 850, GSM 700 MS,
>
> \- up to ‑23 dBm for DCS 1 800 and PCS 1 900 MS.
#### 6.1.1.3 Requirements for BTS
This performance shall be maintained up to ‑40 dBm input level for static and
multipath conditions.
Furthermore, for static conditions, a bit error rate of 10^‑^3 shall be
maintained up to
> \- ‑15 dBm for GSM 400, GSM 900, ER-GSM 900, GSM 850, MXM 850 and GSM 700
> BTS excluding multicarrier BTS equipped with multicarrier receiver,
>
> \- ‑18 dBm for GSM 400, GSM 700, GSM 850 and E-GSM 900 for multicarrier BTS
> equipped with multicarrier receiver,
>
> \- ‑23 dBm for DCS 1 800, PCS 1 900, MXM 1900 BTS including multicarrier
> BTS.
For the pico-BTS the nominal error rates need only be met in the static
channel.
For pico-BTS, for static conditions, a bit error rate of 10^‑3^ shall be
maintained with input levels up to ‑5 dBm for GSM 900, ER-GSM 900, GSM 850 MXM
850 and GSM 700, and ‑14 dBm for DCS 1 800, PCS 1 900 and MXM 1900.
For a multicarrier BTS equipped with multicarrier receiver, the input level
for bit error rate of 10^-3^ shall be adjusted by 0 dB, +4 dB or +9 dB for the
Wide Area, Medium Range and Local Area classes, respectively.
### 6.1.2 QPSK/8-PSK modulation
#### 6.1.2.1 Requirements for MS
For static propagation conditions, the chip error rate, equivalent to the bit
error rate of the uncoded data bits shall have the following limits for input
levels specified below:
> \- MS: BER ≤ 10^-4^ for levels ≥ -82 dBm.
This performance shall be maintained for MS, up to ‑40 dBm input level. The
low level limit for other equipment shall be adjusted according to correction
table 6.2-4 in subclause 6.2.
> NOTE 1: Uncoded data bits refer to the encrypted bits of a burst, extracted
> by the receiver without any signal processing improvement from
> encoding/decoding of the signal.
In case of DLMC configuration, the performance shall be maintained up to -37
dBm of total input power, irrespective of the number of input signals.
This performance shall also be maintained by the MS under frequency hopping
conditions, for input levels up to ‑40 dBm in timeslots on the C0 carrier,
with equal input levels in timeslots on non C0 carriers up to 30 dB less than
on the C0 carrier.
> NOTE 2: This scenario may exist when BTS downlink power control and
> frequency hopping are used.
Furthermore, a bit error rate of 10^-3^ shall be maintained by MS for input
levels up to -26 dBm.
For static conditions, a bit error rate of 10^-3^ shall also be maintained by
the MS under frequency hopping conditions, for input levels on the C0 carrier
of up to -26 dBm at QPSK or 8-PSK, with equal input levels on non C0 carriers,
up to 30 dB less than on the C0 carrier.
In addition, when the frequency of the input QPSK or 8-PSK modulated signal is
randomly offset, on a burst-by-burst basis, by the maximum frequency error
specified in 3GPP TS 45.010 (for MS the pico-BTS frequency error in subclause
5.1 applies), the performance shall fulfil the following limits for Static
channel:
> \- for input levels specified below up to --40 dBm:
>
> \- GSM 400, GSM 700, GSM 850, GSM 900 and ER-GSM 900 MS: BER ≤ 10^-4^ for
> levels ≥-82 dBm;
>
> \- DCS 1800 and PCS 1900 MS: BER ≤ 10^-3^ for levels ≥--82 dBm.
For each burst, the sign of the frequency offset is chosen according to a
511-bit pseudo-random sequence, defined in ITU-T Recommendation O.153. This is
also valid for consecutive timeslots in a multislot MS.
For other equipment the low signal level limit shall be adjusted according to
correction table 6.2-4 in subclause 6.2.
#### 6.1.2.2 Requirements for BTS
The RX performance requirements of BTS for modulation schemes using higher
symbol rate apply to all specified pulse shaping filter used for the input

1368 coded bits, to be interleaved over a number of burst according to 3GPP TS
45.003).
The levels are given for normal BTS and MS separately. For other equipment,

the minimum input signal level for which the reference performance shall be
met is specified in table 1s, 1t, 1u, 1v, 1x and 1y according to the
propagation condition and type of equipment. The levels are given for VAMOS I
MS, VAMOS II MS, VAMOS III MS and normal BTS separately. For other BTS
equipment, the levels in table 1v shall be corrected by the values in table

GSM 900 in table 1s for VAMOS I MS, 1t and 1u for VAMOS II MS, 1x and 1y for
VAMOS III MS and 1v for BTS, except that the GSM 400 MS speed is doubled from
that of GSM 900, e.g. TU50 becomes TU100, and the GSM 700 MS speed is
increased by a factor of 1.2, e.g. TU50 becomes TU60.
In addition for speech channels the residual class Ib BER and residual class
II BER performance shall not exceed the specified values in table 1s, 1t, 1u,
1x, 1y and 1v at the corresponding signal level in dBm.
The reference performance for the repeated associated control channel

A VAMOS III MS shall fulfil the requirements in table 1x and 1y for the
antenna correlation and antenna gain imbalance setup defined in annex Q.7.
### 6.2.2 Packet-switched channels
i) For packet switched channels, the minimum input signal levels for which the
reference performance shall be met are captured in different performance
tables, according to table 6.2-3a.

For Reduced Transmit-Time-Interval (RTTI) the minimum performance requirements
are the same as for Basic Transmit-Time-Interval (BTTI) on a static channel.
The performance requirements for GSM 400 and GSM 700 systems are as for GSM
900, except that the GSM 400 MS speed is doubled from that of GSM 900, e.g.
TU50 becomes TU100, and the GSM 700 MS speed is increased by a factor of 1.2,
e.g. TU50 becomes TU60.
For GMSK modulated signals, the levels are given for normal BTS. For QPSK,
8-PSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM modulated signals, the required levels are given for
normal BTS and MS separately. When in EC operation the requirements shall be
met in the downlink with randomly altered USF in each of the blind physical
layer transmissions, assuming one user per timeslot. In case that Overlaid
CDMA subchannels are multiplexed on the same time slot in coverage classes
CC2, CC3, CC4 and CC5, the requirements in table 1ad shall be met, when the
model of frequency offsets defined in Annex R is applied.
The levels shall be corrected by the values in table 6.2-4, except for EC-
channels in tables 1aa and 1ac where no correction factor is applied for EC-
GSM-IoT mobile stations.

Where BLER is the Block Error Rate, referring to all erroneously decoded data
blocks including any headers, stealing flags, parity bits as well as any
implicit information in the training sequence, or any downlink block
discrimination error between EC-PDTCH and EC-PACCH or between EC-PDTCH/2TS and
EC-PACCH/2TS..
For PDCH the BLER refers to RLC blocks, and hence there can be up to two block
errors per 20ms radio block for EGPRS MCS7, MCS8, MCS9, UAS-7, UAS-8, UAS-9,
UBS-7, UBS-8, DAS-8, DAS-9, DAS-10, DBS-7 and DBS-8, up to three block errors
per radio block for UAS-10, UAS-11, UBS-9, UBS-10, DAS-11, DAS-12, DBS-9 and
DBS-10, and up to four block errors per radio block for UBS-11, UBS-12, DBS-11
and DBS-12. The BLER refers to the initial transmission of RLC blocks, i.e.
the channel decoding without incremental redundancy. For USF, the BLER only
refers to the USF value.
For EC-PDTCH, EC-PDTCH/2TS, EC-PACCH and EC-PACCH/2TS channels in downlink,
the BLER shall be evaluated with random USF in each of the blind physical
layer transmissions.
ii) If BTTI USF mode is used when sending downlink data blocks in RTTI
configuration and different modulations are used in the two data blocks sent
in a 20 ms block period, the USF will be sent with mixed modulation. In this
case, the performance of the mixed modulation USF shall meet the less
stringent requirement of the two modulations for static propagation conditions
according to:
Table 6.2-6 USF performance in mixed modulation
+--------------------+--------------------+--------------+ | > GMSK | > USF/MCS-1 to 4 | > (table 1a) | +--------------------+--------------------+--------------+ | > 8PSK | > USF/MCS5 to 9 | > (table 1c) | +--------------------+--------------------+--------------+ | > 16QAM (EGPRS2-A) | > USF/DAS-8 to 9 | > (table 1l) | +--------------------+--------------------+--------------+ | > 32QAM (EGPRS2-A) | > USF/DAS-10 to 12 | > (table 1l) | +--------------------+--------------------+--------------+ | > QPSK (EGPRS2-B) | > USF/DBS-5 to 6 | > (table 1n) | +--------------------+--------------------+--------------+ | > 16QAM (EGPRS2-B) | > USF/DBS-7 to 9 | > (table 1n) | +--------------------+--------------------+--------------+ | > 32QAM (EGPRS2-B) | > USF/DBS-10 to 12 | > (table 1n) | +--------------------+--------------------+--------------+
For PDCH channels, the performance requirements for some modulation and coding
schemes and propagation conditions are specified at higher BLER. Where
applicable, the BLER value noted in the respective performance requirement
table applies.
### 6.2.3 Flexible Layer One
For Flexible Layer One (FLO), the minimum input signal level for which the
reference performance shall be met is specified in table 1h, according to the
type of reference measurement FLO configurations (or TFCs) and the propagation
condition. The reference TFCs are specified in Annex K. The performance
requirements for GSM 400 and GSM 700 systems are as for GSM 900 in tables 1h,
except that the GSM 400 MS speed is doubled from that of GSM 900, e.g. TU50
becomes TU100, and the GSM 700 MS speed is increased by a factor of 1.2, e.g.
TU50 becomes TU60.
The reference performance shall be:
Table 6.2-7 Reference performance for FLO channels
* * *
‑ for reference TFCs 2,3,4 and 5 BLER ≤ 1% ‑ for reference TFC 1 BLER ≤ 5% ‑
for reference TFCs 6 and 7 BLER ≤ 10%
* * *
where BLER is the Block Error Rate, referring to all erroneously decoded
transport blocks (except those without CRC protection), In all the radio
packets for which the TFCI, or any implicit information in the training
sequence, is decoded incorrectly, all the transport blocks (with CRC
protection) will be counted in error.
The reference performance levels for FLO shall be corrected according to the
values in the table 6.2-4, but with an additional correction of +2 dB on 8-PSK
channels for all MS.
### 6.2.4 Repeated associated control channel performance
For Repeated Downlink FACCH and Repeated SACCH (see 3GPP TS 44.006), the
minimum input signal level for which the reference performance shall be met is
specified in table 1i, 1s, 1t, 1v and 1x, according to the propagation
condition and type of equipment. The performance requirements for GSM 400 and
GSM 700 systems are as for GSM 900 in table 1i, 1s, 1t, 1v and 1x, except that
the GSM 400 MS speed is doubled from that of GSM 900, e.g. TU50 becomes TU100,
and the GSM 700 MS speed is increased by a factor of 1.2, e.g. TU50 becomes
TU60.
The reference performance for Repeated Downlink FACCH and Repeated SACCH shall
be FER ≤ 5%. When calculating FER, a FACCH frame and its repetition or a SACCH
frame and its repetition respectively, shall be counted as one frame and a
frame erasure shall be counted when neither the FACCH frame nor its repetition
or neither the SACCH frame nor its repetition respectively, could be
successfully decoded.
The reference performance levels for Repeated Downlink FACCH and Repeated
SACCH in table 1i and 1v shall be corrected according to the values in the
table 6.2-4.
### 6.2.4a Extended Coverage control channel and data channel performance for
EC-GSM-IoT
For EC-channels in Coverage Classes higher than CC1 (i.e. CC2, CC3 and CC4)
blind physical layer transmissions are used (EC-PDTCH, EC-PDTCH/2TS, EC-RACH,
EC-SCH, EC-PACCH, EC-PACCH/2TS, EC-BCCH, EC-AGCH, EC-PCH). For uplink EC-
channels in Coverage Class CC5 blind physical layer transmissions are used (2
TS EC-RACH, EC-PDTCH/U and EC-PACCH/U).
The minimum input signal level for which the reference performance shall be
met is specified in table 1z, 1aa, 1ab, 1ac and 1ad, according to the
propagation condition and type of equipment, assuming the input signal fulfils
the coherency requirements in subclause 4.6.3, where applicable.

phase II Capability (see 3GPP TS 24.008), the minimum input signal level for
which the reference performance shall be met is specified in table 1j,
according to the propagation condition and type of equipment. The performance
requirements for GSM 400 and GSM 700 systems are as for GSM 900 in table 1j,
except that the GSM 400 MS speed is doubled from that of GSM 900, e.g. TU50
becomes TU100, and the GSM 700 MS speed is increased by a factor of 1.2, e.g.
TU50 becomes TU60.
The reference performance for Downlink Advanced Receiver Performance -- phase
II, shall be
\- For speech channels (TCH/FS, TCH/AFSx, TCH/AHSx) FER: ≤ 1 %
\- For packet switched channels (PDTCH) BLER: ≤ 10 %
In addition for speech channels the residual class Ib BER and residual class
II BER performance shall not exceed the specified values in table 1j at the
corresponding signal level in dBm.
The reference sensitivity performance specified above for Downlink Advanced
Receiver Performance -- phase II need not be met by an MS when it is in a
Downlink Dual Carrier configuration (see 3GPP TS 43.064).
ii) For a MS indicating support for TIGHTER Capability (see 3GPP TS 24.008),
the minimum input signal levels for which the reference performance shall be
met are specified in table 1w, according to the propagation condition. The
performance requirements for GSM 400 and GSM 700 systems are as for GSM 900 in
table 1w, except that the GSM 400 MS speed is doubled from that of GSM 900,
e.g. TU50 becomes TU100, and the GSM 700 MS speed is increased by a factor of
1.2, e.g. TU50 becomes TU60.
The reference performance for Tightened Link Level Performance (TIGHTER)
specified in table 1w, shall be
\- For speech channels (TCH/FS, TCH/HS, TCH/EFS, TCH/AFSx, FER, TCH/AHSx,
TCH/WFSx): ≤ 1 %
\- For signalling channels (SCH, FACCH/F, FACCH/H, SDCCH) FER: ≤ 5 %
\- For packet switched channels (PDTCH) BLER: ≤ 10 % unless otherwise stated
In addition for speech channels the residual class Ib BER and residual class
II BER performance shall not exceed the specified values in table 1w at the
corresponding signal level in dBm. The reference sensitivity level in section
6.2.1 shall be applied for TIGHTER MS.
### 6.2.6 Additional performance conditions
i) The reference sensitivity performance specified above need not be met in
the following cases:
> \- for BTS if the received level on either of the two adjacent timeslots to
> the wanted exceed the reference sensitivity level for circuit-switched,
> GMSK-modulated channels by more than 50 dB;
>
> \- for MS at the static channel, if the received level on either of the two
> adjacent timeslots to the wanted exceed the wanted timeslot reference
> sensitivity level or input level for reference performance, whichever
> applicable by more than 20 dB;
>
> \- for MS on a multislot configuration, if the received level on any of the
> timeslots belonging to the same multislot configuration as the wanted time
> slot, exceed the wanted time slot by more than 6 dB.
The interfering adjacent time slots shall be static with valid GSM GMSK
signals in all cases. The adjacent timeslot levels, specified above apply to
8-PSK, AQPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM modulated signals as well.
ii) The requirements for micro-BTS for 8-PSK, QPSK, 16-QAM and 32-QAM
modulated input signals in the tables above, assume the same maximum output
power in any modulation. For other maximum output power levels, the
sensitivity is adjusted accordingly.
iii) The pico-BTS 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz and 850 MHz and Local Area
multicarrier BTS shall meet the reference sensitivity performance specified
for the static channel. The only other channel that is specified is the TI5
propagation condition and this need only be tested for the no FH case. The
performance requirement for GSM 900, GSM 850, GSM 700, DCS 1 800, PCS 1900,
MXM 850 and MXM 1900 pico-BTS and Local Area multicarrier BTS with the TI5
propagation condition is the same as the TU50 performance requirement for GSM
900. The level of input signal at which this requirement shall be met is 3dB
above the level specified above in this sub-clause (in combination with Table
1a, 1b, 1k, 1p and 1q for packet service) , for GMSK modulated signals, and 3
dB for 8-PSK modulated signals. For 16-QAM, 32-QAM and QPSK the level of input
signal at which the requirement shall be met is 3 dB above the level specified
above in this sub-clause (in combination with Table 1k, 1m, 1p and 1q for
packet service). In case of higher symbol rate, tables 1p and 1q apply for
input signals using wide and narrow pulse shaping filter. For Local Area
multicarrier BTS and speech channels in _VAMOS Mode_ and their associated
control channels, the level of input signal at which the requirement shall be
met is 5 dB above the level specified in tables 6.2-1b and 6.2-4 (in
combination with Table 1v).
iv) In case of DLMC configuration, the reference sensitivity performance
specified above for TU50 no FH applies. Sensitivity requirements for other
propagation conditions are not specified.
## 6.3 Reference interference level
### 6.3.1 GMSK modulated speech channels and associated control channels
The reference interference performance (for cochannel, C/Ic, or adjacent
channel, C/Ia) in terms of frame erasure, bit error or residual bit error
rates (whichever appropriate) is specified in table 2, according to the type
of channel and the propagation condition. The performance requirements for GSM
400 and GSM 700 systems are as for GSM 900 in table 2, except that the GSM 400
MS speed is doubled from that of GSM 900, e.g. TU50 becomes TU100, and the GSM
700 MS speed is increased by a factor of 1.2, e.g. TU50 becomes TU60. The
actual interference ratio is defined as the interference ratio for which this
performance is met. The actual interference ratio shall be less than a
specified limit, called the reference interference ratio. The reference
interference ratio shall be, for all types of BTS and all types of MS:

modulated channels except for Enhanced circuit-switched data, speech and
control channels in VAMOS mode and Wideband AMR

For packet switched channels, the requirements for adjacent channel

The values in tables 2g, 2i, 2l, 2n, 2w and 2af, are also valid for GSM 400
with the exception that MS speed is doubled, e.g. TU50 becomes TU100. For GSM
700 the values in tables 2g, 2i, 2l, 2n, 2v, 2w and 2af, are valid with the
exception that GSM 700 MS speed is increased by a factor of 1.2, e.g. TU50
becomes TU60.
In case of DLMC configuration the reference interference performance specified
above for TU50 no FH applies. Adjacent channel interference requirements for
other propagation conditions are not specified.
For a MS in EC operation, the requirements on EC-channels for adjacent
(200kHz) channel interference performance in the table 2am apply for GMSK
modulated channels and table 2ao for 8-PSK modulated channels.

GSM 700 MS speed is increased by a factor of 1.2, e.g. TU50 becomes TU60.
In case BTS is using EC-channels, the requirements for adjacent (200kHz)
channel interference performance in the table 2al apply for GMSK modulated
channels and table 2an for 8-PSK modulated channels.

The requirements for the adjacent (200 kHz) channel shall be met with an
interferer at higher symbol rate, using the same modulation and pulse shaping
filter as the wanted signal. For the adjacent (400 kHz) channel the
requirements apply for both GMSK and 8-PSK modulated interfering signals.

The signal levels above, where DLMC configuration is applicable, apply to each
wanted signal for a MS in DLMC configuration. All adjacent channel interferers
need to be located within the maximum DLMC carrier separation per contiguous
frequency allocation.
### 6.3.5 Additional reference interference performance requirements and
conditions
If not stated differently, all reference interference specifications in
section 6.3 apply only for a random, continuous, GMSK modulated interfering
signal.
In case of frequency hopping, the interference and the wanted signals shall
have the same frequency hopping sequence. Unless otherwise stated, the wanted
and interfering signals shall be subject to the same propagation profiles (see
annex C), independent on the two channels.
In case of EC-channels for which dedicated performance requirements are
specified, i.e. which do not reuse EGPRS performance requirements, the
interferer shall be subject to independent propagation in each burst with each
burst generated with random, continuous, GMSK modulated interference.
> NOTE: For the purpose of lowering testing complexity for EC-channels, the
> interferer's independent propagation condition between bursts can be
> approximated with a RA250noFH propagation condition for E-GSM900 and GSM850
> or RA130noFH propagation condition for DCS 1800 or PCS 1900.
For a GSM 400 MS, a GSM 900 MS, a ER-GSM 900, a GSM 850 MS, a GSM 700 MS, a
DCS 1 800 MS and a PCS 1 900 MS the reference interference performance
according to table 2 and 2j for co‑channel interference (C/Ic) shall be
maintained for RA500/250/130 propagation conditions if the time of arrival of
the wanted signal is periodically alternated by steps of 8µs in either
direction. The period shall be 32 seconds (16 seconds with the early and 16
seconds with the late time of arrival alternately).
For pico-BTS and Local Area multicarrier BTS, propagation conditions other
than static and T15 are not specified and only the no FH case need be tested.
The performance requirement for GSM 900, ER-GSM 900, GSM 850, GSM 700, DCS 1
800, PCS 1900, MXM 850 and MXM 1900 pico-BTS and Local Area multicarrier BTS
with TI5 propagation condition is the same as theTU50 no FH (900MHz)
performance requirement. The interference ratio at which this requirement
shall be met is, for GMSK modulated wanted signals, 4dB above the interference
ratio specified above in this sub-clause (in combination with Table 2a for
packet service). For 8-PSK modulated wanted signals, the interference ratio
for this requirement is 4 dB above the interference ratio specified above in
this sub-clause (in combination with Table 2b and 2d for packet service). For
16-QAM, 32-QAM and QPSK modulated wanted signals, the interference ratio for
this requirement is 4 dB above the interference ratio specified above in this
sub-clause (in combination with Table 2r and 2t (16-QAM), and Table 2t (32-QAM
and QPSK) for packet service). For Local Area multicarrier BTS and speech
channels in _VAMOS Mode_ and their associated control channels, the
interference ratio for this requirement is 6 dB above the interference ratio
specified above in this sub-clause 6.3 (in combination with Table 2ac). For
adjacent channel interference propagation conditions other than TU50 need not
be tested. There is an exception in the case of the pico-BTS and Local Area
multicarrier BTS in that the specified propagation condition is TI5 instead of
TU50; the respective test for pico-BTS and Local Area multicarrier BTS is
described in the paragraph following table 6.3-3 below.
If, in order to ease measurement, a TU50 (no FH) faded wanted signal, and a
static adjacent channel interferer are used, the reference interference
performance shall be:
Table 6.3-3 Reference interference ratio measurements for GMSK-modulated
speech channels -- simplified
* * *

(RBER): 8,8 % 8,9 % FACCH (FER): 17,1 % 6,1 %
* * *
For pico-BTS and Local Area multicarrier BTS, adjacent channel and cochannel
interference propagation conditions other than TI5 need not be tested. If, in
order to ease adjacent channel measurements, a TI5 (no FH) faded wanted
signal, and a static adjacent channel interferer are used, the interference
performance shall be the same as that specified above for a TU50 no FH channel
(900MHz). The interference ratio at which this performance shall be met is 4dB
above the reference interference ratio specified above in this sub-clause.
In addition, MS indicating support for Downlink Advanced Receiver Performance
-- phase I (see 3GPP TS 24.008) shall fulfil the requirements in table 2o for
wanted signals on GMSK modulated channels under TU50 no FH propagation
conditions and GMSK modulated interferers for the test scenarios defined in
annex L, unless when the MS is assigned a Downlink Dual Carrier configuration
(see 3GPP TS 44.060) comprising a total of more than 8 timeslots, in which
case, the MS shall only fulfil the requirements at least on all the timeslots
that are assigned on the carrier 1 (see 3GPP TS 44.060). The reference
performance shall be:

channels (FACCH/F, SDCCH) FER: ≤ 5 % For packet switched channels (PDTCH)

* * *
The values in table 2o are given as the C/I1 ratio, where C is the power level
of the wanted signal and I1 is the power level of the dominant co-channel
interferer (Co-channel 1, see annex L).\ In addition for speech channels the
residual class Ib BER and residual class II BER performance shall not exceed
the specified values in table 2o at the corresponding C/I1.
A MS indicating support for Downlink Advanced Receiver Performance -- phase II
Capability (see 3GPP TS 24.008) shall fulfil the requirements in table 2q for
the test scenarios defined in annex N. The reference performance shall be:
Table 6.3-5 Reference performance for DARP -- phase II
* * *
For speech channels (TCH/FS, TCH/AFSx, TCH/AHSx) FER: ≤ 1 % For packet
switched channels (PDTCH) BLER: ≤ 10 %
* * *
The values in table 2q are given as the C/I1 ratio, where C is the power level
of the wanted signal and I1 is the power level of the dominant co-channel
interferer (Co-channel 1, see annex N).\ In addition for speech channels the
residual class Ib BER and residual class II BER performance shall not exceed
the specified values in table 2q at the corresponding C/I1.
The reference interference performance specified above for Downlink Advanced
Receiver Performance -- phase II need not be met by an MS when it is in a
Downlink Dual Carrier configuration (see 3GPP TS 43.064).
A MS indicating support for TIGHTER Capability (see 3GPP TS 24.008) shall also
indicate support for DARP -- phase I (see 3GPP TS 24.008), and shall fulfil
the requirements in table 2ad for cochannel interference (C/Ic), table 2af for
adjacent channel (200 kHz) interference (C/Ia1), and the additional
requirements in table 2ae for wanted signals on GMSK modulated channels for
the test scenarios defined in annex L. The reference performance shall be:

* * *
For speech channels (TCH/FS, TCH/HS, TCH/EFS, TCH/AFSx, TCH/AHSx, TCH/WFSx )
FER: ≤ 1 % For signalling channels (FACCH/F, FACCH/H, SDCCH) FER: ≤ 5 % For
packet switched channels (PDTCH) BLER: ≤ 10 % unless otherwise stated
* * *
For equipment supporting 8-PSK, and for MS indicating support for Downlink
Advanced Receiver Performance -- phase I (see 3GPP TS 24.008), the applicable
TIGHTER requirements in table 2ad for TCH/WFSx and PDTCH, and table 2af for
TCH/WFSx, PDTCH/CSx, PDTCH/MCSx and PDTCH/DASx apply for both GMSK and 8-PSK
modulated interfering signals.
The values in table 2ae are given as the C/I1 ratio, where C is the power
level of the wanted signal and I1 is the power level of the dominant co-
channel interferer (Co-channel 1, see annex L).
In addition to table 6.3-6, for speech channels the residual class Ib BER and
residual class II BER performance shall not exceed the specified values in
table 2ad, 2ae and 2af at the corresponding interference ratio C/Ic, C/I1, and
C/Ia1, respectively.

## 6.6 Frequency hopping performance under interference conditions
Under the following conditions:
> \- a useful signal, cyclic frequency hopping over four carriers under static
> conditions, with equal input levels 20 dB above reference sensitivity level;
>
> \- a random, continuous, GMSK-modulated interfering signal on only one of
> the carriers at a level 10 dB higher than the useful signal.
The FER for TCH/FS shall be less than 5%.
## 6.7 Incremental Redundancy Performance for EGPRS and EGPRS2 MS
Support for Incremental Redundancy reception is mandatory for all EGPRS
capable MSs. In Incremental Redundancy RLC mode soft information from
multiple, differently punctured, versions of an RLC data block may be used
when decoding the RLC data block. This significantly increases the link
performance.
An EGPRS capable MS shall under the conditions stated in the below table 6.7-1
achieve a long-term throughput of 20 kbps per time slot (see note), measured
between LLC and RLC/MAC layer.
An EGPRS2 capable MS shall under the conditions stated in the below table
6.7-1 achieve a long-term throughput of 33 kbps per time slot, measured
between LLC and RLC/MAC layer.
An EC-GSM-IoT MS shall under the conditions stated in table 6.7-1 achieve the
long-term throughput per time slot over the accumulated time of allocated
radio blocks, measured between LLC and RLC/MAC layer as shown in table 6.7-1.
The throughput requirements are dependent on the MS support level:
> \- In case the MS supports only GMSK, i.e. MCS 1-4, the requirements for
> 'EC-GSM-IoT Only GMSK supported' and 'EC-GSM-IoT, MCS-1/16' apply.
>
> \- In case the MS supports GMSK and 8-PSK, i.e. MCS 1-9, the requirements
> for 'EC-GSM-IoT 8-PSK supported' and 'EC-GSM-IoT, MCS-1/16' apply.

For TU50 (ideal FH), sufficient decorrelation may be | | achieved with 4 frequencies spaced over 5 MHz. | | | | NOTE 4: The requirements for DCS 1800 & PCS 1900 on TU50 (ideal FH) | | propagation conditions are the same as for TU50 (no FH). | | | | The requirements for the DCS 1800 & PCS 1900 Static propagation | | condition are the same as for the GSM 850 & GSM 900 Static | | propagation condition, and the requirements for the DCS 1800 & PCS | | 1900 RA130 (no FH) propagation condition are the same as for the GSM | | 850 & GSM 900 RA250 (no FH) propagation condition. | | | | NOTE 5: As a minimum the test of performance shall include all | | propagation conditions for maximum implemented codec rate and the | | remaining implemented codec rates for one propagation condition | | only, e.g. TU50 (no FH). | | | | NOTE 6: For O-TCH/WHS, the performance requirements for inband | | signalling, SID_UPDATE and RATSCCH are the same as those of | | O-TCH/AHS. It is sufficient to test inband signalling, SID_UPDATE | | and RATSCCH requirements for only one of the channel types O-TCH/AHS | | and O-TCH/WHS. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

# C.2 Doppler spectrum types
In this clause, we define the two types of doppler spectra which will be used
for the modelling of the channel. Throughout this clause the following
abbreviations will be used:
> ‑ fd = v/λ, represents the maximum doppler shift, with v (in ms‑1)
> representing the vehicle speed, and λ (in m) the wavelength.
The following types are defined:
CLASS is the classical doppler power spectrum and will be used in all but one
case;
(CLASS) S(f) = 1/(πfd (1‑(f/fd)2 )0.5 ) for f ∈ ]‑fd, fd[;
RICE is the sum of a classical doppler spectrum and one direct path, such that
the total multipath contribution is equal to that of the direct path. This
power spectrum is used for the shortest path of the RA model;
> (RICE) S(f) = A0/(πfd(1‑(f/fd )2 )0,5 ) + A1 δ(f -- 0,7 fd ) for f ∈ ]‑fd,
> fd[.
>
> A0 = 0,17 and A1 = 0,83 for the six tap RA model, A0 = 0,13 and A1 = 0,87
> for the four tap RA model.
# C.3 Propagation models
In this clause the propagation models that are mentioned in the main body of
3GPP TS 45.005 are defined. As a general principle those models are referred
to as NAMEx, where NAME is the name of the particular model, which is defined
thereunder, and x is the vehicle speed (in km/h) which impacts on the
definition of fd (see clause C.2) and hence on the doppler spectra.
Those models are usually defined by 12 tap settings; however, according to the
simulators available it may not be possible to simulate the complete model.
Therefore a reduced configuration of 6 taps is also defined in those cases.
This reduced configuration may be used in particular for the multipath
simulation on an interfering signal. Whenever possible the full configuration
should be used. For each model two equivalent alternative tap settings,
indicated respectively by (1) and (2) in the appropriate columns, are given.

###### ## Annex E (normative): Repeater characteristics
# E.1 Introduction
A repeater receives amplifies and transmits simultaneously both the radiated
RF carrier in the downlink direction (from the base station to the mobile
area) and in the uplink direction (from the mobile to the base station).
This annex details the minimum radio frequency performance of repeaters
operating in frequency bands defined in clause 2 of this document. The
environmental conditions for repeaters are specified in annex D.3, of 3GPP TS
45.005. The precise measurement methods for repeaters are specified in 3GPP TS
51.026 [35]. Further application dependant requirements on repeaters need to
be considered by operators before they are deployed. These network planning
aspects of repeaters are covered in 3GPP TR 43.030.
The following requirements apply to the uplink and downlink directions.
In clauses 2 and 3 the maximum output power per carrier is the value declared
by the manufacturer.
BTS and MS transmit bands are as defined in clause 2 of 3GPP TS 45.005.
# E.2 Spurious emissions
At maximum repeater gain, with or without a continuous static sine wave input
signal in the operating band of the repeater, at a level which produces the
manufacturers maximum rated power output, the following requirements shall be
met.
The average power of any single spurious measured in a 3 kHz bandwidth shall
be no greater than:
> ‑ 250 nW (‑36 dBm) in the relevant MS and BTS transmit frequency bands for a
> repeater operating in transmit frequency bands below 1 GHz at offsets of >
> 100 kHz from the carrier.
>
> ‑ 1 μW (‑30 dBm) in the relevant MS and BTS transmit frequency bands for a
> repeater operating in transmit frequency bands above 1 GHz at offsets of >
> 100 kHz from the carrier.
Outside of the relevant transmit bands the power measured in the bandwidths
according to table E.2-1, shall be no greater than:
> \- 250 NW (‑36 dBm) in the frequency band 9 kHz to 1 GHz;
>
> \- 1 μW (‑30 dBm) in the frequency band 1 GHz to 12,75 GHz.
Table E.2-1 Measurement bandwidth for spurious emissions
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Band | Frequency offset | Measurement | | | | bandwidth | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 100 kHz -- 50 MHz | ‑ | 10 kHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 50 MHz -- 500 MHz | (offset from edge of | | | outside the | the | | | | | | | relevant BTS | relevant transmit | | | transmit band or | band)‑ | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | MS transmit band | > 0 MHz | 10 kHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | | ≥ 2 MHz | 30 kHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | | ≥ 5 MHz | 100 kHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | above 500 MHz | (offset from edge of | | | outside the | the | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | relevant BTS | relevant above band) | | | Transmit band or | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | MS transmit band | > 0 MHz | 10 kHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | | ≥ 2 MHz | 30 kHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | | ≥ 5 MHz | 100 kHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | | ≥ 10 MHz | 300 kHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | | ≥ 20 MHz | 1 MHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | | ≥ 30 MHz | 3 MHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
The requirement applies to all ports of the repeater.
> NOTE: For radiated spurious emissions, the specifications currently only
> apply to the frequency band 30 MHz to 4 GHz. The specification and method of
> measurement outside this band are under consideration.
# E.3 Intermodulation products
At maximum repeater gain, with two continuous static sine wave input signals
in the operating band of the repeater, at equal levels which produce the
maximum rated power output per carrier, the average power of any
intermodulation products measured in a 3 kHz bandwidth shall be no greater
than:
> ‑ 250 nW (‑36 dBm) in the frequency band 9 kHz to 1 GHz;
>
> ‑ 1 μW (‑30 dBm) in the frequency band 1 GHz to 12,75 GHz.
When the two input signals are simultaneously increased by 10 dB each, the
requirements shall still be met.
The requirement applies to all ports of the repeater.
# E.4 Out of band gain
The following requirements apply at all frequencies from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz
excluding the relevant transmit bands.
The net out of band gain in both directions through the repeater shall be less
than +50 dB at 400 kHz. +40 dB at 600 kHz, +35 dB at 1 MHz and +25 dB at 5 MHz
offset and greater from the edges of the BTS and MS transmit bands.
In special circumstances additional filtering may be required out of band and
reference should be made to 3GPP TR 43.030.
# E.5 Frequency error and modulation accuracy
## E.5.1 Frequency error
This clause applies only to repeater systems using frequency shift.
The average frequency deviation of the output signal with respect to the input
signal of the repeater system shall not be more than 0,1 ppm. The specified
value applies to a complete repeater system signal path. Consequently a single
repeater unit is limited to an average frequency deviation of not more than
0.05 ppm with respect to its wanted output frequency.
## E.5.2 Modulation accuracy at GMSK modulation
This clause applies only to repeater systems using frequency shift.
For a complete repeater system operating at the nominal output power as
specified by the manufacturer shall the increase in phase error of a GSM input
signal, which meets the phase error requirements of subclause 4.6, not exceed
the values in subclause 4.6 by 2 degrees RMS and by 8 degrees peak. For a
single repeater unit operating at the nominal output power as specified by the
manufacturer shall the increase in phase error of a GSM input signal, which
meets the phase error requirements of subclause 4.6, not exceed the values in
subclause 4.6 by 1.1 degrees RMS and by 4.5 degrees peak.
## E.5.3 Modulation accuracy at 8-PSK, 16-QAM, 32-QAM, QPSK and AQPSK
modulation
This clause applies only to repeater systems supporting 8-PSK, 16-QAM, 32-QAM,
QPSK and/or AQPSK.
For a repeater as defined in the first column of the table E.5-1 below and
operating at the nominal output power as specified by the manufacturer, the
RMS EVM of the output RF signal for an ideal GSM 8-PSK, 16-QAM, 32-QAM, QPSK
and AQPSK input signal (if supported) according to subclause 4.6, shall not
exceed the requirement as defined in the table below.

###### ## Annex F (normative): Antenna Feeder Loss Compensator Characteristics
(GSM 400, GSM 900 and DCS 1800)
# F.1 Introduction
An Antenna Feeder Loss Compensator (AFLC) is physically connected between the
MS and the antenna in a vehicle mounted installation. It amplifies the signal
received in the downlink direction and the signal transmitted in the uplink
direction, with a gain nominally equal to the loss of the feeder cable. Unless
otherwise stated, the requirements defined in this specification apply to the
full range of environmental conditions specified for the AFLC (see annex D2 of
3GPP TS 45.005).
This specification details the minimum radio frequency performance of GSM AFLC
devices. The environmental conditions for the AFLC are specified in annex D.2
of 3GPP TS 45.005. It also includes informative guidelines on the use and
design of the AFLC.
The following requirements apply to AFLC devices intended for use in the GSM
400, GSM 900 and DCS 1 800 frequency bands. For GSM 900, the requirements
apply to an AFLC intended for use with a GSM 400 and GSM 900 class 4 MS. For
DCS 1 800, the requirements apply to an AFLC intended for use with a DCS 1 800
class 1 MS. For compatibility reasons, a GSM 900 AFLC is required to support
the Extended GSM band.
The requirements apply to the AFLC, including all associated feeder and
connecting cables. A 50 ohm measurement impedance is assumed.
When referred to in this specification:
> \- the maximum rated output power for a GSM 400 and GSM 900 AFLC is +33 dBm
> and for a DCS 1 800 AFLC is +30 dBm;
>
> \- a GSM input signal, is a GMSK signal modulated with random data, which
> meets the performance requirements of 3GPP TS 45.005, for an MS of
> equivalent output power. The power level specified for the GSM input signal,
> is the power averaged over the useful part of the burst.
# F.2 Transmitting path
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in this clause apply at all
frequencies in the transmit band 450,4 MHz to 457,6 MHz for a GSM 450 AFLC, at
all frequencies in the transmit band 478,8 MHz to486 MHz for a GSM 480 AFLC,
at all frequencies in the transmit band 880 MHz to 915 MHz for a GSM 900 AFLC,
and at all frequencies in the transmit band 1 710 MHz to 1 785 MHz, for a DCS
1 800 AFLC. For a multi band AFLC, which supports more than one, the
requirements apply in any transmit bands implemented.
## F.2.1 Maximum output power
With a GSM input signal at a level of X dBm, the maximum output power shall be
less than a level of Y dBm. The values of X and Y for GSM 400, GSM 900 and DCS

power, the AFLC gain shall be 0 dB with a tolerance of ±1 dB, over the
relevant transmit band.

dB, the net path gain over the relevant transmit band shall be 0 dB, with a
tolerance of ±1 dB, for the first 10 reduced input levels and ±2 dB for the 4
lowest input levels.
For a DCS 1 800 AFLC, with the input level reduced in 15 steps of 2 dB, the
net path gain over the relevant transmit band shall be 0 dB, with a tolerance
of ±1 dB, for the first 13 reduced input levels and ±2 dB for the 2 lowest
input levels.
In frequency bands which are not supported, the gain shall be no greater than
the maximum value in the relevant transmit band.
## F.2.3 Burst transmission characteristics
With a GSM input signal, the shape of the GSM AFLC output signal related to
this input signal shall meet the tolerances of tables F.2-2a and F.2-3. With a
DCS input signal, the shape of the DCS AFLC shall meet the tolerances of
tables F.2-2b and F.2-3.
> NOTE: The tolerances on the output signal correspond to the time mask of
> 3GPP TS 45.005, with the input signal in the middle of the tolerance field.

The input signal time is the time at which the input level crosses the
corresponding signal level. The above requirements apply to both the rising
and falling edge of the burst.

GSM 900 AFLC, and at +36 dBm for a DCS 1 800 AFLC, the peak power of any
single spurious emission measured in a bandwidth according to table F.2-4,
shall be no greater than ‑36 dBm in the relevant transmit band.

## F.2.8 VSWR
The VSWR shall be less than 1.7:1 at the RF port of the device which is
intended to be connected to the MS. The VSWR shall be less than 2:1 at the RF
port of the device which is intended to be connected to the antenna.
## F.2.9 Stability
The AFLC shall be unconditionally stable.
# F.3 Receiving path
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in this clause apply at all
frequencies in the receive band 460.4 -- 467.6 MHz for a GSM 450 AFLC, at all
frequencies in the receive band 488.8 -- 496 MHz for a GSM 480 AFLC, at all

frequencies in the receive band 1 805 -- 1 880 MHz, for a DCS 1 800 AFLC. For
a multi band AFLC, which supports more than one of the GSM and DCS bands, the
requirements apply in all of the receive bands supported.
## F.3.1 Gain

## F.3.5 VSWR
The VSWR shall be less than 1.7:1 at the RF port of the device which is
intended to be connected to the MS. The VSWR shall be less than 2:1 at the RF
port of the device which is intended to be connected to the antenna.
## F.3.6 Stability
The AFLC shall be unconditionally stable.
# F.4 Guidelines (informative)
The specifications of the AFLC, have been developed to ensure that a generic
AFLC causes minimal degradation of the parametric performance of the MS, to
which it is connected.
The following should be clearly marked on the AFLC:
> ‑ The intended band(s) of operation.
>
> ‑ The power class of the MS, to which it designed to be connected.
When installed correctly the AFLC can provide enhancement of the MS to BTS
link in vehicular installations. However, it is not guaranteed that an AFLC,
which meets the requirements of this specification, will provide a performance
improvement for all of the different GSM MS implementations and installations.
Some MS implementations significantly exceed the performance requirements of
3GPP TS 45.005, e.g. with respect to reference sensitivity performance. A
purely passive feeder of low loss cable, may provide the best performance for
some implementations. The benefits of installing an AFLC in a vehicular
application, can only be assessed on a case by case basis.
When used, the AFLC should only be installed in the type approved
configuration, with the minimum amount of additional cabling.
When designing an AFLC to be used with a GSM MS, the best downlink performance
will be obtained if the low noise amplifier is situated as closely as possible
to the output of the antenna.
###### ## Annex G (normative): Calculation of Error Vector Magnitude
The Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is computed at the symbol times in the useful
part of the burst (excluding tail symbols).\ Let Y(t) be the complex signal
produced by observing the real transmitter at instant t. R(t) is defined to be
an ideal transmitted signal. The symbol timing phase of Y(t) is aligned with
the ideal signal. The transmitter is modelled as:
Y(t) = C1{R(t) + D(t) + C0}W^t^
where
> W = e α + jω accounts for both a frequency offset of "ω" radians per second
> phase rotation and an amplitude change of "α" nepers per second,
>
> C0 is a constant origin offset representing carrier feedthrough,
>
> C1 is a complex constant representing the arbitrary phase and output power
> of the transmitter and
>
> D(t) is the residual complex error on signal R(t).
>
> Y(t) is compensated in amplitude, frequency and phase by multiplying by the
> complex factor
>
> W^-t^/C1
>
> After compensation, Y(t) is passed through the specified measurement filter
> to produce the signal
>
> Z(k) = S(k) + E(k) + C0
where
S(k) is the ideal transmitter signal observed through the measurement filter.
> K = floor(t/T~s~), where T~s~ corresponds to the symbol time.\ (T~s~= 48/13
> µsec or 1/270.833kHz for normal symbol rate, and T~s~= 40/13 µsec for higher
> symbol rate)
The error vector **E**(k)
E(k) = Z(k) -- C0 --S(k)
is measured and calculated for each instant k.
The sum square vector error for each component is calculated over one burst.
The relative RMS vector error is defined as:
and shall not exceed the specified value.
The symbol vector error magnitude (EVM) at symbol k is defined as
,
where N is the number of elements in the set Κ. EVM(k) is the vector error
length relative the root average energy of the useful part of the burst.
C0, C1 and W shall be chosen to minimise RMS EVM per burst and are then used
to compute the individual vector errors E(k) on each symbol. The symbol timing
phase of the samples used to compute the vector error should also be chosen to
give the lowest value for the RMS EVM.
Origin offset suppression (in dB) is defined as
The minimum value of origin offset suppression is specified separately.
In the above equation, the errors shall be measured after a measurement
receive filter at baseband. The specification is based on using the specified,
windowed, raised-cosine, filter with roll-off 0.25 and single side-band
bandwidth of 90 kHz for normal symbol rate and for higher symbol-rate using
narrow pulse-shaping filter, and the specified, windowed, raised-cosine,
filter with roll-off 0.25 and single side-band bandwidth of 108 kHz for higher
symbol rate using wide pulse-shaping filter as the measurement receive filter
(see 4.6.2). Sufficient over-sampling is assumed (at least 4 times).

Of Arrival positioning mechanism.
Section H.2 and its subsections specifiy LMU requirements to support the

###### ## Annex I (normative): E-OTD Mobile Station Requirements
# I.1 Introduction
To measure Enhanced Observed Timing Difference (E-OTD) location the MS must
make accurate Observed-Time-Difference measurements (OTD -- the time interval
that is observed by a MS between the reception of signals (bursts) from two
BTSs). Specifically, the E-OTD MS shall be capable of measuring the reception
of bursts transmitted from a BTS on a periodic and predictable basis. The
measurement results are used by the system or the E-OTD capable MS for
determining location of the MS. This clause defines E-OTD measurement accuracy
requirements of an E-OTD capable MS deployed in the GSM System. Requirements
for dedicated mode E-OTD measurements are specified below. An E-OTD MS,
supporting the MS based E-OTD method, shall be capable of doing idle mode
E-OTD measurements with the same accuracy as in dedicated mode, but this needs
not to be tested.
# I.2 Sensitivity and Interference Performance
This clause specifies the required E-OTD measurement accuracy for an E-OTD
capable MS with and without interference. The requirements are given in terms
of E-OTD measurement error (in microseconds), as function of the carrier and
interference input power levels, at the antenna connector of the receiver.
Equipment with an integral antenna may be taken into account in a similar
manner as described in Chapter 5 of 3GPP TS 45.005.
The power level, under multipath fading condition, is the mean power of the
sum of the individual paths.
## I.2.1 Sensitivity Performance
With the following configuration and propagation conditions, the E-OTD capable
MS shall meet the requirements of 90% RMS E-OTD error defined in Table I.2-1.
\- The E-OTD capable MS is in dedicated mode receiving a carrier signal at a
power level of at least 20 dB above the reference sensitivity level defined in
subclause 6.2.
\- The E-OTD measurements are done on a neighbour BCCH carrier at power levels
relative to the reference sensitivity level defined in subclause 6.2. The
measurement power levels are given in Table I.2-1. The E-OTD measurements are
referenced to a reference BCCH carrier at a power level at least 20 dB above
the reference sensitivity level defined in subclause 6.2. The reference BCCH
carrier and the neighbour BCCH carrier shall be in the same frequency band.
The BA list contains the reference BCCH carrier and the neighbour BCCH
carrier.
\- The network requests an E-OTD measurement by commanding the E-OTD capable
MS to report the E-OTD measurement with a response time equal to 2 seconds.
The E-OTD capable MS does not need to perform E-OTD measurements prior to
receiving the command.
\- The measurement performance shall also be achieved with the reference BCCH
and the neighbour BCCH carriers having 8-PSK modulated bursts. 8-PSK
modulation and the 8-PSK normal bursts are defined in 3GPP TS 45.004 clause 3
and 3GPP TS 45.002 subclause 5.2.3, respectively.
\- The measurement accuracy of the E-OTD capable MS is defined as the root-
mean-square (RMS) value of 90% of the measurements that result in the least
E-OTD error. As an example, if {x~1~..x~N~}is a set of the absolute square
E-OTD measurement errors for N trials, sorted in ascending order, the RMS of
90% is defined as
RMS~90~ = sqrt( sum(x~1~..x~M~)/M )
where M is the largest integer such that M \ 250
trials is recommended.
The channels shall be static, i.e. at a constant signal level throughout the
measurements.

## I.2.2 Interference Performance
In this clause, requirements are given in terms of the E-OTD measurement
accuracy (in microseconds) for specified carrier-to-interference ratios of the
neighbour BCCH carrier. The carrier the MS uses for communication and the

neighbour BCCH carrier signal shall be as defined in I.2.1 and shall be set to

###### ## Annex J (informative): Guidance on the Usage of Dynamic ARFCN
Mapping
# J.1 Introduction
Dynamic mapping of ARFCN numbers may be used in order to extend the capability
to support more frequencies than with a fixed allocation scheme which is
limited to 1024 frequencies. Typically dynamic mapping would be used for ARFCN
numbers that have no fixed allocation as described in section 2 but dynamic
allocation of other ARFCN numbers is also possible.
Mapping of ARFCN numbers to frequencies may be indicated in System Information
type 14, type 15 or Packet System Information Type 8. This mapping may be
limited to the actual frequency allocation used by the serving PLMN or
additionally to frequencies of other PLMNs in case of co-operation between
different PLMNs allowing e.g. handover between those PLMNs.
# J.2 Dynamic allocation of GSM 400, GSM 800, GSM 900, ER-GSM 900, DCS 1800
and PCS 1900 ARFCNs
If a PLMN is not using some of frequencies of GSM 400, GSM 800, GSM 900, ER-
GSM 900, DCS 1800 or PCS 1900 bands, the corresponding ARFCN numbers may be
used for dynamic ARFCN mapping. However, in this case mobiles of previous
releases, not supporting dynamic ARFCN mapping but supporting the frequency
band concerned, monitor different frequencies than actually intended. In this
case the operator must take care that NCC_PERMITTED (See 3GPP TS 44.018) is
set in a way that those mobiles ignore unintentional measurements, based on
NCC not permitted. Note that in this case a mobile station not supporting
dynamic mapping, performs the same number of RXLEV measurements per
measurement report per carrier on the BA as the mobile station that supports
dynamic mapping. However, some loss of performance may occur when the mobile
station is searching synchronisation for carriers on the list of strongest
cells.
# J.3 Controlling changes in dynamic mapping
Dynamic mapping may need to be changed in a live network e.g. when the
operator is taking new frequency allocations into use or if the existing
frequency allocation is changed. Since the mobile stations decode the
information about dynamic mapping periodically only in idle mode, valid
mapping must be broadcast well before the new mapping is taken into use.
An example case of a change in dynamic mapping is described by the following
steps:
\- Assume that the network is initially broadcasting dynamic mapping for 4
different frequency blocks, referred as DM1, DM2, DM3 and DM4.
\- Assume that DM1 is covering the frequency range from x to x + 5 MHz and the
frequency band allocated for the operator is changed to the range from x -- 5
MHz to x + 2 MHz (extension and change of frequency allocation at the same
time).
\- The operator should then start to broadcast a new dynamic mapping DM1, DM2,
DM3, DM4 and DM5 where the old frequency allocation is mapped by DM1 and the
new allocation is mapped by DM5. _The requirement is that the ARFCN numbers
used for DM1 and DM5 are non-overlapping_.
\- Once the operator has used this new system information sufficiently long,
the change in the frequency allocation can be carried out. Note that this
change needs to be done like any similar change with fixed mapping scheme, the
change should occur simultaneously for all active resources in a given cell,
including likely changes in neighbour cell SI messages.
\- At any time after the actual change in the frequency allocation, the
operator may start broadcasting dynamic mapping excluding DM1, i.e. including
only DM5, DM2, DM3 and DM4.
Transmission of duplicated mapping information (DM1 & DM5 in the above
example) should last as long as the longest supported continuous call at the
time the change in mapping takes place. This allows all mobiles decode the new
mapping information in idle mode. Alternatively the network may provide the
new mapping information in dedicated mode through SACCH with System
Information type 14 message. This option allows infinite calls and reduces the
time required for broadcasting of duplicated mapping information.

###### ## Annex L (normative): Reference Test Scenarios for DARP
In all reference DARP Test Scenarios (DTS), the wanted signal shall always use
Training Sequence (TSC) 0.
In each reference Test Scenario, the co-channel and adjacent channel
interferers are GMSK modulated. The power of these interferers is measured
before any receiver filtering and during the active part of the desired burst
(see 3GPP TS 45.004). The use of Training sequence for the interferers varies
between the Test Scenarios as defined below. When no TSC is indicated the
midamble is filled with random data bits. Random TSC means that TSC is
randomly selected on a burst-by-burst basis from {TSC1,...,TSC7}.
In some test scenarios an AWGN source is added to the interferers. The AWGN
power is measured over a bandwidth of 270,833 kHz.
All power levels are relative to the signal level of the strongest co-channel
interferer.
Power ramping according to the requirements in 3GPP TS 45.005 shall be applied
to all delayed interferers. The other interferers shall be random, continuous
GMSK-modulated signals.
> NOTE: The non-delayed interferer is the same signal for which reference
> interference performance requirements normally apply (see clause 6.3).
In adjacent timeslots of the delayed interferers no power shall be applied.
The level of the strongest co-channel interferer (Co-channel 1) shall be -80
dBm.
The delay is measured from the same bit position in the wanted signal burst
and the interferer burst, where the position in the wanted signal is the
reference position.

###### ## Annex M (normative): Minimum Performance Requirements for Assisted
Global Positioning System (A-GPS)
This Annex defines the minimum performance requirements for A-GPS for MSs that
support A-GPS. It includes the minimum performance requirements for both MS
based and MS assisted A‑GPS terminals.
# M.1 General
## M.1.1 Abbreviations
> A-GPS Assisted -- Global Positioning System

> C/A Coarse/Acquisition
>
> ECEF Earth Centred, Earth Fixed
>

>
> TOW Time Of Week
>
> TTFF Time To First Fix
>
> WLS Weighted Least Squares
## M.1.2 Measurement parameters
### M.1.2.1 MS based A-GPS measurement parameters
In case of MS-based A-GPS, the measurement parameters are contained in the
RRLP LOCATION INFORMATION IE. The measurement parameter in case of MS-based
A-GPS is the horizontal position estimate reported by the MS and expressed in
latitude/longitude.
### M.1.2.2 MS assisted A-GPS measurement parameters
In case of MS-assisted A-GPS, the measurement parameters are contained in the
RRLP GPS MEASUREMENT INFORMATION IE. The measurement parameters in case of MS-
assisted A-GPS are the MS GPS Code Phase measurements. The MS GPS Code Phase
measurements are converted into a horizontal position estimate using the
procedure detailed in clause M.7.
## M.1.3 Response time
Max Response Time is defined as the time starting from the moment that the MS
has received the final RRLP MEASURE POSITION REQUEST sent before the MS sends
the MEASURE POSITION RESPONSE containing the Location Information or the GPS
Measurement Information, and ending when the MS starts sending the MEASURE
POSITION RESPONSE containing the Location Information or the GPS Measurement
Information on the Air interface. The response times specified for all test
cases are Time-to-First-Fix (TTFF), i.e. the MS shall not re‑use any
information on GPS time, location or other aiding data that was previously
acquired or calculated and stored internally in the MS. A dedicated test
message 'RESET MS POSITIONING STORED INFORMATION' has been defined in TS
44.014 for the purpose of deleting this information and is detailed in
subclause M.3.1.10.
## M.1.4 Time assistance
Time assistance is the provision of GPS time to the MS from the network via
RRLP messages. Currently two different GPS time assistance methods can be
provided by the network.
> a) Coarse time assistance is always provided by the network and provides
> current GPS time to the MS. The time provided is within ±2 seconds of GPS
> system time. This allows the GPS time to be known within one GPS navigation
> data sub-frame. It is signalled to the MS by means of the GPS Week and GPS
> TOW fields in the Reference Time assistance data IE.
>
> b) Fine time assistance is optionally provided by the network and adds the
> provision to the MS of the relationship between the GPS system time and the
> current GSM time. The accuracy of this relationship is ±10 μs of the actual
> relationship. This addresses the case when the network can provide an
> improved GPS time accuracy. It is signalled to the MS by means of the FNm,
> TN and BN fields in the Reference Time assistance data IE.
The time of applicability of time assistance is the beginning of the Frame of
the message containing the GPS Reference time.
### M.1.4.1 Use of fine time assistance
The use of fine time assistance to improve the GPS performance of the MS is
optional for the MS, even when fine time assistance is signalled by the
network. Thus, there are a set minimum performance requirements defined for
all MSs and additional minimum performance requirements that are valid for
fine time assistance capable MSs only. These requirements are specified in
subclause M.2.1.2.
### M.1.4.2 2D position error
The 2D position error is defined by the horizontal difference in meters
between the ellipsoid point reported or calculated from the MS MEASURE
POSITION RESPONSE and the actual position of the MS in the test case
considered.
# M.2 A-GPS minimum performance requirements
The A-GPS minimum performance requirements are defined by assuming that all
relevant and valid assistance data is received by the MS in order to perform
GPS measurements and/or position calculation. This clause does not include nor
consider delays occurring in the various signalling interfaces of the network.
In the following subclauses the minimum performance requirements are based on
availability of the assistance data information and messages defined in
clauses M.5 and M.6.
## M.2.1 Sensitivity
A sensitivity requirement is essential for verifying the performance of A-GPS
receiver in weak satellite signal conditions. In order to test the most
stringent signal levels for the satellites the sensitivity test case is
performed in AWGN channel. This test case verifies the _performance of the
first position estimate, when the MS is provided with only coarse time
assistance and when it is additionally supplied with fine time assistance._
### M.2.1.1 Coarse time assistance
In this test case 8 satellites are generated for the terminal. AWGN channel
model is used.

requirement 8 satellites are generated for the terminal. AWGN channel model is
used.

## M.2.2 Nominal Accuracy
Nominal accuracy requirement verifies the accuracy of A-GPS position estimate
in ideal conditions. The primarily aim of the test is to ensure good accuracy
for a position estimate when satellite signal conditions allow it. This test
case verifies the performance of the first _position estimate_.
In this requirement 8 satellites are generated for the terminal. AWGN channel
model is used.

* * *
Success rate 2-D position error Max response time 95 % 30 m 20 s

## M.2.3 Dynamic Range
The aim of a dynamic range requirement is to ensure that a GPS receiver
performs well when visible satellites have rather different signal levels.
Strong satellites are likely to degrade the acquisition of weaker satellites
due to their cross‑correlation products. Hence, it is important in this test
case to keep use AWGN in order to avoid loosening the requirements due to
additional margin because of fading channels. This test case verifies the
_performance of the first position estimate._
In this requirement 6 satellites are generated for the terminal. AWGN channel
model is used.

## M.2.4 Multi-Path scenario
_The purpose of the test case is to_ verify the receiver's tolerance to
multipath while keeping the test setup simple. This test case verifies the
_performance of the first position estimate._
In this requirement 5 satellites are generated for the terminal. Two of the
satellites have one tap channel representing Line-Of-Sight (LOS) signal. The
three other satellites have two-tap channel, where the first tap represents
LOS signal and the second reflected and attenuated signal as specified in Case
G1 in subclause M.4.2.

## M.2.5 Moving scenario and periodic location
_This test case only applies to MSs supporting Rel-7 or later Supplementary
Services._
_The purpose of the test case is to verify_ the receiver's capability to
produce GPS measurements or location fixes on a regular basis, and to follow
when it is located in a vehicle that slows down, turns or accelerates. A good
tracking performance is essential for a certain location services. A moving
scenario with periodic location is well suited for verifying the tracking
capabilities of an A-GPS receiver in changing MS speed and direction. In the
requirement the MS moves on a rectangular trajectory, which imitates urban
streets. AWGN channel model is used. This test is not performed as a Time to
First Fix (TTFF) test.
In this requirement 5 satellites are generated for the terminal. The MS is
requested to use periodic location reporting with a reporting interval of 2
seconds.
The MS moves on a rectangular trajectory of 940 m by 1 440 m with rounded
corner defined in figure M.2-1. The initial reference is first defined
followed by acceleration to final speed of 100 km/h in 250 m. The MS then
maintains the speed for 400 m. This is followed by deceleration to final speed
of 25 km/h in 250 m. The MS then turn 90 degrees with turning radius of 20 m
at 25 km/h. This is followed by acceleration to final speed of 100 km/h in 250
m. The sequence is repeated to complete the rectangle.

random distribution.
In addition, for every Fine Time Assistance Test Instance the IE BN shall have
a random offset, relative to the true value of the relationship between the
two time references, within the error range of Fine Time Assistance defined in
the test case. This offset value shall have a uniform random distribution.
### M.3.1.3 GPS Reference Time
For every Test Instance in each test case, the GPS reference time shall be

than the previous fix.
### M.3.1.4 Reference and MS locations
There is no limitation on the selection of the reference location, consistent
with achieving the required HDOP for the Test Case. For each test instance the

use the new assistance data. The uncertainty of the semi-major axis is 3 km.
The uncertainty of the semi-minor axis is 3 km. The orientation of major axis
is 0 degrees. The uncertainty of the altitude information is 500 m. The
confidence factor is 68 %.
For every Test Instance in each test case, the MS location shall be randomly

visible satellites. In each test, signals are generated for only a sub-set of
these satellites for which other assistance data is available. The number of
satellites in this sub-set is specified in the test. The satellites in this
sub-set shall all be above 15 degrees elevation with respect to the MS. The

are listed in clause M.6.
### M.3.1.9 GPS signals
The GPS signal is defined at the A-GPS antenna connector of the MS. For MS
with integral antenna only, a reference antenna with a gain of 0 dBi is
assumed.
### M.3.1.10 RESET MS POSITIONING STORED INFORMATION Message
In order to ensure each Test Instance in each test is performed under Time to
First Fix (TTFF) conditions, a dedicated test signal (_RESET MS POSITIONING
STORED INFORMATION_) defined in TS 44.014 shall be used.
When the MS receives the '_RESET MS POSITIONING STORED INFORMATION_ ' signal,
with the IE _MS POSITIONING TECHNOLOGY_ set to _AGPS_ it shall:
> \- discard any internally stored GPS reference time, reference location, and
> any other aiding data obtained or derived during the previous test instance
> (e.g. expected ranges and Doppler);
>
> \- accept or request a new set of reference time or reference location or
> other required information, as in a TTFF condition;
>
> \- calculate the position or perform GPS measurements using the 'new'
> reference time or reference location or other information.

# M.7 Converting MS-assisted measurement reports into position estimates
## M.7.1 Introduction
To convert the MS measurement reports in case of MS-assisted mode of A-GPS
into position errors, a transformation between the "measurement domain" (code-
phases, etc.) into the "state" domain (position estimate) is necessary. Such a
transformation procedure is outlined in the following clauses. The details can
be found in [ICD-GPS 200], [P. Axelrad, R.G. Brown] and [S.K. Gupta].
## M.7.2 MS measurement reports
In case of MS-assisted A-GPS, the measurement parameters are contained in the
RRLP GPS MEASUREMENT INFORMATION ELEMENT (subclause A.3.2.5 in 3GPP TS
44.031). The measurement parameters required for calculating the MS position
are:
> 1) Reference Time: The MS has two choices for the Reference Time:
>
> a) "Reference Frame";
>
> b) "GPS TOW ".
>
> 2) Measurement Parameters: 1 to \:
>
> a) "Satellite ID (SV PRN)";
>
> b) "Whole GPS chips";
>
> c) "Fractional GPS Chips";
>
> d) "Pseudorange RMS Error".
Additional information required at the system simulator:
> 1) "Reference Location" (subclause A.4.2.4 in 3GPP TS 44.031):\ Used for
> initial approximate receiver coordinates.
>
> 2) "Navigation Model" (subclause A.4.2.4 in 3GPP TS 44.031):\ Contains the
> GPS ephemeris and clock correction parameters as specified in [ICD-GPS 200];
> used for calculating the satellite positions and clock corrections.
>
> 3) "Ionospheric Model" (subclause A.4.2.4 in 3GPP TS 44.031):\ Contains the
> ionospheric parameters which allow the single frequency user to utilize the
> ionospheric model as specified in [ICD-GPS 200] for computation of the
> ionospheric delay.
## M.7.3 Weighted Least Squares (WLS) position solution
The WLS position solution problem is concerned with the task of solving for
four unknowns; _xu, yu, zu_ the receiver coordinates in a suitable frame of
reference (usually ECEF) and _bu_ the receiver clock bias. It typically
requires the following steps:
**Step 1: Formation of pseudo-ranges**
The observation of code phase reported by the MS for each satellite Svi is
related to the pseudo-range/c modulo 1 ms (the length of the C/A code period).
For the formation of pseudo-ranges, the integer number of milliseconds to be
added to each code-phase measurement has to be determined first. Since 1 ms
corresponds to a travelled distance of 300 km, the number of integer ms can be
found with the help of reference location and satellite ephemeris. The
distance between the reference location and each satellite SVi is calculated
and the integer number of milli-seconds to be added to the MS code phase
measurements is obtained.
**Step 2: Formation of weighting matrix**
The MS reported "Pseudorange RMS Error" values are used to calculate the
weighting matrix for the WLS algorithm described in [P. Axelrad, R.G. Brown].
According to 3GPP TS 44.031, the encoding for this field is a 6 bit value that
consists of a 3 bit mantissa, Xi and a 3 bit exponent, Yi for each Svi:
$w_{i} = \text{RMSError} = 0\text{.}5 \times \left( 1 + \frac{X_{i}}{8}
\right) \times 2^{Y_{i}}$
The weighting Matrix **W** is defined as a diagonal matrix containing the
estimated variances calculated from the "Pseudorange RMS Error" values:
$W = \text{diag}\left{
\frac{1}{w_{1}^{2}},\frac{1}{w_{2}^{2}},\cdots,\frac{1}{w_{n}^{2}} \right}$
**Step 3: WLS position solution**
The WLS position solution is described in [P. Axelrad, R.G. Brown] and usually
requires the following steps:
> 1) Computation of satellite locations at time of transmission using the
> ephemeris parameters and user algorithms defined in [ICD-GPS 200] section
> 20.3.3.4.3.
>
> 2) Computation of clock correction parameters using the parameters and
> algorithms as defined in [ICD-GPS 200] section 20.3.3.3.3.1.
>
> 3) Computation of atmospheric delay corrections using the parameters and
> algorithms defined in [ICD-GPS 200] section 20.3.3.5.2.5 for the ionospheric
> delay, and using the Gupta model defined in [S.K. Gupta] p. 121 equation (2)
> for the tropospheric delay.
>
> 4) The WLS position solution starts with an initial estimate of the user
> state (position and clock offset). The Reference Location is used as initial
> position estimate. The following steps are required:
>
> a) Calculate geometric range (corrected for Earth rotation) between initial
> location estimate and each satellite included in the MS measurement report.
>
> b) Predict pseudo-ranges for each measurement including clock and
> atmospheric biases as calculated in 1) to 3) above and defined in [ICD-GPS
> 200] and [P. Axelrad, R.G. Brown].
>
> c) Calculate difference between predicted and measured pseudo-ranges
> $\text{Δρ}$
>
> d) Calculate the "Geometry Matrix" **G** as defined in [P. Axelrad, R.G.
> Brown]:
>
> $G \equiv \left\lbrack \begin{matrix} \- {\hat{1}}_{1}^{T} \ \-
> {\hat{1}}_{2}^{T} \ \vdots \ \- {\hat{1}}_{n}^{T} \ \end{matrix}\text{\ \ \
> \ }\begin{matrix} 1 \ 1 \ \vdots \ 1 \ \end{matrix} \right\rbrack$ with
> ${\hat{1}}_{i} \equiv \frac{r_{\text{si}} - {\hat{r}}_{u}}{\left|
> r_{\text{si}} - {\hat{r}}_{u} \right|}$ where**r** si is the Satellite
> position vector for Svi (calculated in 1) above), and ${\hat{r}}_{u}$is the
> estimate of the user location.
>
> e) Calculate the WLS solution according to [P. Axelrad, R.G. Brown]:
>
> $\Delta\hat{x} = \left( G^{T}\text{WG} \right)^{- 1}G^{T}\text{WΔρ}$
>
> f) Adding the $\Delta\hat{x}$to the initial state estimate gives an improved
> estimate of the state vector:
>
> $\hat{x} \rightarrow \hat{x} + \Delta\hat{x}$.
>
> 5) This new state vector $\hat{x}$can be used as new initial estimate and
> the procedure is repeated until the change in $\hat{x}$is sufficiently
> small.
**Step 4: Transformation from Cartesian coordinate system to Geodetic
coordinate system**
The state vector $\hat{x}$ calculated in Step 3 contains the MS position in
ECEF Cartesian coordinates together with the MS receiver clock bias. Only the
user position is of further interest. It is usually desirable to convert from
ECEF coordinates _xu, yu, zu_ to geodetic latitude ϕ , longitude λ and
altitude _h_ on the WGS84 reference ellipsoid.
**Step 5: Calculation of "2-D Position Errors"**
The latitude ϕ / longitude λ obtained after Step 4 is used to calculate the
2-D position error.
###### ## Annex N (normative): Reference Test Scenarios for DARP Phase II
(MSRD)
# N.1 Interferer configurations
In all reference DARP Test Scenarios (DTS), the wanted signal shall always use
Training Sequence (TSC) 0.
In each reference Test Scenario, the co-channel and adjacent channel
interferers are GMSK modulated, except for DTS-1b where the 257uppressi
interferer is 8-PSK modulated. The power of the interferers is measured before
any receiver filtering and during the active part of the desired burst (see
3GPP TS 45.004). No Training Sequence Code (TSC) is used, and thus the
midamble is filled with random data bits.
In some test scenarios an AWGN source is added to the interferers. The AWGN
power is measured over a bandwidth of 270,833 kHz.
All power levels are relative to the signal level of the strongest co-channel
interferer.
Power ramping according to the requirements in 3GPP TS 45.005 shall be applied
to all delayed interferers. The other interferers shall be random, continuous
GMSK-modulated signals.
> NOTE: The non-delayed interferer is the same signal for which reference
> interference performance requirements normally apply (see clause 6.3).
In adjacent timeslots of the delayed interferers no power shall be applied.
The level of the strongest co-channel interferer (Co-channel 1) shall be -70
dBm.
The delay is measured from the same bit position in the wanted signal burst
and the interferer burst, where the position in the wanted signal is the
reference position.

# N.2 Correlation and antenna gain imbalance
Since a DARP phase II MS utilizes receiver diversity by means of two antennas,
a set of diversity specific parameters have been defined. The sets consist of
different values of antenna correlation and antenna gain imbalance.
Table N.2-1 DARP phase II diversity parameters
* * *
**Parameter set** **Antenna correlation,** $\rho$ **Antenna gain
imbalance,_G_** Set 1 0 0 dB Set 2 0.7 -6 dB
* * *
The correlation is defined as the magnitude of the complex correlation of the
signals received at the two antenna connectors of the MS. A correlation value
of 0 means the signals are uncorrelated. The antenna gain imbalance parameter
reflects the difference in received signal level at the two antenna
connectors. Thus, a value of -6 dB means that the signal on one antenna is
attenuated by 6 dB compared to the signal on the other connector. The channel
model setup when applying these parameters is illustrated below, where the
parameter, _G_ , models the antenna gain imbalance and $\rho$ is the antenna
correlation.
{width="3.975in" height="1.7368055555555555in"}
Figure N.2.1: Single input -- dual output channel model for MS Receiver
Diversity -- DARP ph II
The model consists of a single input signal, which is passed through two
fading channels. The multipath fading is independent Rayleigh fading processes
but the channel profile, e.g. TU50 is the same for each branch. The
correlation between the two branches is generated using the weighting factor,
$\rho$, which as mentioned is the magnitude of the complex correlation.
Antenna gain imbalance is applied by attenuating _Y~1~_ or _Y~2~_ by 6 dB as
indicated by the _G_ block on figure N.2.1.
The multi interferer scenarios (DTS-2 and DTS-5) are generated by expanding
the single input-dual output model as shown below. The model uses instances of
the single input dual output channel model to instantiate the interfering
signals. For sensitivity tests the single input -- dual output channel model
of figure N.2.1 is sufficient.

The amplifier _G_ represents the antenna gain imbalance parameter.
# N.3 Testing MSRD terminal conformance to legacy requirements
When testing the conformance of a dual antenna terminal against the single
antenna requirements the following procedures shall be applied.
\- For an MS that always applies MSRD, conformance to legacy requirements
shall be tested by applying uncorrelated signals to the antenna connectors.
This corresponds to setting $\rho = 0$and $G = 0$in the model shown in figure
N.2.1 and thus reduces the model to the one shown in figure N.3.1.
\- For an MS capable of switching between single and dual antenna reception
conformance shall be tested by terminating one of the antenna connectors, as
shown in figure N.3.2.

requirements.
###### ## Annex O (normative): Minimum Performance Requirements for Assisted
Galileo and Additional Navigation Satellite Systems (A-GANSS)
This Annex defines the minimum performance requirements for A-GANSS for MSs
that support A-GANSS. It includes the minimum performance requirements for
both MS based and MS assisted A‑GANSS terminals. The minimum performance
requirements also include combinations of A-GPS and A-GANSS.

## O.1.2 Measurement parameters
### O.1.2.1 MS based A-GANSS measurement parameters
In case of MS-based A-GANSS, the measurement parameters are contained in the
RRLP GANSS LOCATION INFORMATION IE. The measurement parameter in case of MS-
based A-GANSS is the horizontal position estimate reported by the MS and
expressed in latitude/longitude.
### O.1.2.2 MS assisted A-GANSS measurement parameters
In case of MS-assisted A-GANSS, the measurement parameters are contained in
the RRLP GANSS MEASUREMENT INFORMATION IE. The measurement parameters in case
of MS-assisted A-GANSS are the Code Phase Measurements. The MS GANSS
Measurement parameters (reported in the GANSS MEASUREMENT INFORMATION IE) that
may be combined with MS GPS Code Phase measurements are converted into a
horizontal position estimate using the procedure detailed in clause O.7.
## O.1.3 Response time
Max Response Time is defined as the time starting from the moment that the MS
has received the final RRLP MEASURE POSITION REQUEST sent before the MS sends
the MEASURE POSITION RESPONSE containing the Location Information or the GPS
and GANSS Measurement Information, and ending when the MS starts sending the
MEASURE POSITION RESPONSE containing the Location Information or the GPS and
GANSS Measurement Information on the Air interface. The response times
specified for all test cases are Time-to-First-Fix (TTFF) unless otherwise
specified, i.e. the MS shall not re‑use any information on GANSS time,
location or other aiding data that was previously acquired or calculated and
stored internally in the MS. A dedicated test message 'RESET MS POSITIONING
STORED INFORMATION' has been defined in TS 44.014 for the purpose of deleting
this information and is detailed in subclause O.3.1.10.
## O.1.4 Time assistance
Time assistance is the provision of GANSS reference time to the MS from the
network via RRLP messages. Currently two different GANSS time assistance
methods can be provided by the network.
> a) Coarse time assistance is always provided by the network and provides
> current GANSS time to the MS. The time provided is within ±2 seconds of
> GANSS system time. It is signalled to the MS by means of the GANSS Day and
> GANSS TOD fields in the GANSS Reference Time assistance data IE.
>
> b) Fine time assistance is optionally provided by the network and adds the
> provision to the MS of the relationship between the selected GANSS system
> time and the current GSM time. The accuracy of this relationship is ±10 μs
> of the actual relationship. This addresses the case when the network can
> provide an improved GANSS time accuracy. It is signalled to the MS by means
> of the FNm, TN and BN fields in the GANSS Reference Time assistance data IE.
The specific GANSS system time is identified through the GANSS Time Id field
of the GANSS Reference Time IE. In case where several GANSS are used in the
tests, only one GANSS Time Id is used to determine the Time of Day. For all
the constellations, the GANSS Time Model assistance and UTC Model assistance
shall be available at the system simulator, as specified in subclause O.6.
The time of applicability of time assistance is the beginning of the Frame of
the message containing the GANSS reference time.
### O.1.4.1 Use of fine time assistance
The use of fine time assistance to improve the GANSS performance of the MS is
optional for the MS, even when fine time assistance is signalled by the
network. Thus, there are a set minimum performance requirements defined for
all MSs and additional minimum performance requirements that are valid for
fine time assistance capable MSs only. These requirements are specified in
subclause O.2.1.2.
## O.1.5 Error definitions
The 2D position error is defined by the horizontal difference in meters
between the ellipsoid point reported or calculated from the MS MEASURE
POSITION RESPONSE and the actual position of the MS in the test case
considered.
## O.1.6 Mobile stations supporting multiple constellations
Minimum performance requirements are defined for each global GANSS
constellation (Galileo, Modernized GPS, GLONASS and BDS). Mobile stations
supporting multiple global constellations shall meet the minimum performance
requirements for a combined scenario where each MS supported constellation is
simulated.
> NOTE: For test cases where signals from "GPS" and "Modernized GPS" are
> included, "GPS" and "Modernized GPS" are considered as a single
> constellation, unless otherwise specified.
## O.1.7 Mobile stations supporting multiple signals
For mobile stations supporting multiple signals, different minimum performance
requirements may be associated with different signals. The satellite simulator
shall generate all signals supported by the MS. Signals not supported by the
MS do not need to be simulated. The relative power levels of each signal type
for each GNSS are defined in Table O.1-1. The individual test scenarios in
clause O.2 define the reference signal power level for each satellite. The
power level of each simulated satellite signal type shall be set to the
reference signal power level defined in each test scenario in clause O.2 plus
the relative power level defined in Table O.1-1.

# O.2 A-GANSS minimum performance requirements
The A-GANSS minimum performance requirements are defined by assuming that all
relevant and valid assistance data is received by the MS in order to perform
GPS and GANSS measurements and/or position calculation. This clause does not
include nor consider delays occurring in the various signalling interfaces of
the network.
In the following subclauses the minimum performance requirements are based on
availability of the assistance data information and messages defined in
clauses O.5 and O.6.
## O.2.1 Sensitivity
A sensitivity requirement is essential for verifying the performance of
A-GANSS receiver in weak satellite signal conditions. In order to test the
most stringent signal levels for the satellites the sensitivity test case is
performed in AWGN channel. This test case verifies the _performance of the
first position estimate, when the MS is provided with only coarse time
assistance and when it is additionally supplied with fine time assistance._
### O.2.1.1 Coarse time assistance
In this requirement 6 satellites are generated for the terminal. AWGN channel
model is used.

## O.2.2 Nominal Accuracy
Nominal accuracy requirement verifies the accuracy of A-GANSS position
estimate in ideal conditions. The primarily aim of the test is to ensure good
accuracy for a position estimate when satellite signal conditions allow it.
This test case verifies the performance of the first _position estimate_.
In this requirement 6 satellites are generated for the terminal. If SBAS is to
be tested one additional satellite shall be generated. AWGN channel model is
used. The number of simulated satellites for each constellation is as defined
in Table O.2-8.

## O.2.3 Dynamic Range
The aim of a dynamic range requirement is to ensure that a GNSS receiver
performs well when visible satellites have rather different signal levels.
Strong satellites are likely to degrade the acquisition of weaker satellites
due to their cross‑correlation products. Hence, it is important in this test
case to use AWGN in order to avoid loosening the requirements due to
additional margin because of fading channels. This test case verifies the
_performance of the first position estimate._
In this requirement 6 satellites are generated for the terminal. Two different
reference power levels, denoted as "high" and "low" are used for each GNSS.
The allocation of high and low power level satellites depends on the number of
supported GNSSs and it is defined in Table O.2-11. AWGN channel model is used.

## O.2.4 Multi-Path scenario
_The purpose of the test is to_ verify the receiver's tolerance to multipath
while keeping the test setup simple. This test verifies the _performance of
the first position estimate._
In this test 6 satellites are generated for the terminal. Some of the
satellites have a one tap channel representing the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) signal.
The other satellites have a two-tap channel, where the first tap represents
the LOS signal and the second represents a reflected and attenuated signal as
specified in subclause O.4.2. The number of satellites generated for each GNSS
as well as the channel model used depends on the number of systems supported
by the MS and is defined in Table O.2-14. The channel model as specified in
subclause O.4.2 further depends on the generated signal.

## O.2.5 Moving scenario and periodic location
_This test case only applies to MSs supporting Supplementary Services for
periodic reporting._
_The purpose of the test case is to verify_ the receiver's capability to
produce GANSS measurements or location fixes on a regular basis, and to follow
when it is located in a vehicle that slows down, turns or accelerates. A good
tracking performance is essential for a certain location services. A moving
scenario with periodic location is well suited for verifying the tracking
capabilities of an A-GANSS receiver in changing MS speed and direction. In the
requirement the MS moves on a rectangular trajectory, which imitates urban
streets. AWGN channel model is used. This test is not performed as a Time to
First Fix (TTFF) test.
In this test 6 satellites are generated for the terminal. The MS is requested
to use periodic location reporting with a reporting interval of 2 seconds.
The MS moves on a rectangular trajectory of 940 m by 1 440 m with rounded
corner defined in figure O.2-1. The initial reference is first defined
followed by acceleration to final speed of 100 km/h in 250 m. The MS then
maintains the speed for 400 m. This is followed by deceleration to final speed
of 25 km/h in 250 m. The MS then turn 90 degrees with turning radius of 20 m
at 25 km/h. This is followed by acceleration to final speed of 100 km/h in 250
m. The sequence is repeated to complete the rectangle.

# O.7 Converting MS-assisted measurement reports into position estimates
## O.7.1 Introduction
To convert the MS measurement reports in case of MS-assisted mode of A-GANSS
into position errors, a transformation between the "measurement domain" (code-
phases, etc.) into the "state" domain (position estimate) is necessary. Such a
transformation procedure is outlined in the following clauses. The details can
be found in [IS-GPS-200], [IS-GPS-705], [IS-GPS-800], [SBAS], [IS-QZSS],
[GLONASS ‑ICD],[Galileo-ICD],[P. Axelrad, R.G. Brown], [S.K. Gupta] and [BDS-
ICD].
## O.7.2 MS measurement reports
In case of MS-assisted A-GANSS, the measurement parameters are contained in
the RRLP GANSS MEASUREMENT INFORMATION ELEMENT (subclause A.3.2.10 in 3GPP TS
44.031). In case the MS provides also measurements on the GPS L1 C/A signal,
the measurement parameters are contained in the RRLP GPS MEASUREMENT
INFORMATION ELEMENT (subclause A.3.2.5 in 3GPP TS 44.031). The measurement
parameters required for calculating the MS position are:
> 1) Reference Time: The MS has two choices for the Reference Time:
>
> a) "Reference Frame";
>
> b) "GANSS TOD" and/or "GPS TOW" if GPS L1 C/A signal measurements are also
> provided.
>
> Note: It is not expected that an MS will ever report both a GANSS TOD and a
> GPS TOW. However if two time stamps are provided and they derive from
> different user times, be aware that no compensation is made for this
> difference and this could affect the location accuracy.
>
> 2) Measurement Parameters for each GANSS and GANSS Signal: 1 to \:
>
> a) "SV ID"; mapping according to Table A.10.14 in 3GPP TS 44.031;
>
> b) "Code Phase";
>
> c) "Integer Code Phase";
>
> d) "Code Phase RMS Error";
>
> 3) Additional Measurement Parameters in case of GPS L1 C/A signal
> measurements are also provided: 1 to \:
>
> a) "Satellite ID (SV PRN)";
>
> b) "Whole GPS chips";
>
> c) "Fractional GPS Chips";
>
> d) "Pseudorange RMS Error".
Additional information required at the system simulator:
> 1) "Reference Location" (subclause A.4.2.4 or A.4.2.6.1 in 3GPP TS 44.031):\
> Used for initial approximate receiver coordinates.
>
> 2) "GANSS Navigation Model" (subclause A.4.2.6.2 in 3GPP TS 44.031):\

> positions and clock corrections.
>
> 3) "GANSS Ionospheric Model" (subclause A.4.2.6.1 in 3GPP TS 44.031):\
> Contains the ionospheric parameters which allow the single frequency user to

>
> 6) "Navigation Model" (subclause A.4.2.4 in 3GPP TS 44.031):\ Contains the

> ionospheric delay.
## O.7.3 Weighted Least Squares (WLS) position solution
The WLS position solution problem is concerned with the task of solving for
four unknowns; _xu, yu, zu_ the receiver coordinates in a suitable frame of
reference (usually ECEF) and _bu_ the receiver clock bias relative to the
selected GNSS specific system time. It typically requires the following steps:
**Step 1: Formation of pseudo-ranges**
The observation of code phase reported by the MS for each satellite Svi is
related to the pseudo-range/c modulo the "GANSS Code Phase Ambiguity", or
modulo 1 ms (the length of the C/A code period) in case of GPS L1 C/A signal
measurements. For the formation of pseudo-ranges, the integer number of
milliseconds to be added to each code-phase measurement has to be determined
first. Since 1 ms corresponds to a travelled distance of 300 km, the number of
integer ms can be found with the help of reference location and satellite
ephemeris. The distance between the reference location and each satellite Svi
at the time of measurement is calculated, and the integer number of
milliseconds to be added to the MS code phase measurements is obtained.
**Step 2: Correction of pseudo-ranges for the GNSS-GNSS time offsets**
In case the MS reports measurements for more than a single GNSS, the pseudo-
ranges are corrected for the time offsets between the GNSSs relative to the
selected reference time using the GNSS-GNSS time offsets available at the
system simulator:
$\rho_{\text{GNSS}_{m},i} \equiv \rho_{\text{GNSS}_{m},i} - c \cdot
(t_{\text{GNSS}_{k}} - t_{\text{GNSS}_{m}})$,
where $\rho_{\text{GNSS}_{m},i}$is the measured pseudo-range of satellite _I_
of GNSS~m~. The system time $t_{\text{GNSS}_{k}}$of GNSS~k~ is the reference
time frame, and$(t_{\text{GNSS}_{k}} - t_{\text{GNSS}_{m}})$is the available
GNSS-GNSS time offset, and _c_ is the speed of light.
**Step 3: Formation of weighting matrix**
The MS reported "Code Phase RMS Error" and/or "Pseudorange RMS Error" values
are used to calculate the weighting matrix for the WLS algorithm described in
[P. Axelrad, R.G. Brown]. According to 3GPP TS 44.031, the encoding for these
fields is a 6 bit value that consists of a 3 bit mantissa, Xi and a 3 bit
exponent, Yi for each Svi of GNSS~j~:
$w_{\text{GNSS}_{j},i} = \text{RMSError} = 0\text{.}5 \times \left( 1 +
\frac{X_{i}}{8} \right)2^{Y_{i}}$
The weighting Matrix **W** is defined as a diagonal matrix containing the
estimated variances calculated from the "Code Phase RMS Error" and/or
"Pseudorange RMS Error" values:
$W = \text{diag}\left{
\frac{1}{w_{\text{GNSS}_{1},1}^{2}},\frac{1}{w_{\text{GNSS}_{1},2}^{2}},\cdots,\frac{1}{w_{\text{GNSS}_{1},n}^{2}},\cdots,\frac{1}{w_{\text{GNSS}_{m},1}^{2}},\frac{1}{w_{\text{GNSS}_{m},2}^{2}},\cdots,\frac{1}{w_{\text{GNSS}_{m},l}^{2}}
\right}$
**Step 4: WLS position solution**
The WLS position solution is described in e.g., [P. Axelrad, R.G. Brown] and
usually requires the following steps:
> 1) Computation of satellite locations at time of transmission using the
> ephemeris parameters and user algorithms defined in the relevant ICD of the
> particular GNSS. The satellite locations are transformed into WGS-84
> reference frame, if needed.
>
> 2) Computation of clock correction parameters using the parameters and
> algorithms as defined in the relevant ICD of the particular GNSS.
>
> 3) Computation of atmospheric delay corrections using the parameters and
> algorithms defined in the relevant ICD of the particular GNSS for the
> ionospheric delay, and using the Gupta model defined in [S.K. Gupta] p. 121
> equation (2) for the tropospheric delay. For GNSSs which do not natively
> provide ionospheric correction models (e.g., GLONASS), the ionospheric delay
> is determined using the available ionospheric model (see subclause O.7.2)
> adapted to the particular GNSS frequency.
>
> 4) The WLS position solution starts with an initial estimate of the user
> state (position and clock offset). The Reference Location is used as initial
> position estimate. The following steps are required:
>
> a) Calculate geometric range (corrected for Earth rotation) between initial
> location estimate and each satellite included in the MS measurement report.
>
> b) Predict pseudo-ranges for each measurement including clock and
> atmospheric biases as calculated in 1) to 3) above and defined in the
> relevant ICD of the particular GNSS and [P. Axelrad, R.G. Brown].
>
> c) Calculate difference between predicted and measured pseudo-ranges
> $\text{Δρ}$.
>
> d) Calculate the "Geometry Matrix" **G** as defined in [P. Axelrad, R.G.
> Brown]:
>
> $G \equiv \begin{bmatrix} \- {\hat{1}}_{\text{GNSS}_{1},1}^{T} & 1 \ \-
> {\hat{1}}_{\text{GNSS}_{1},2}^{T} & 1 \ \vdots & \vdots \ \-
> {\hat{1}}_{\text{GNSS}_{1},n}^{T} & 1 \ \vdots & \vdots \ \-
> {\hat{1}}_{\text{GNSS}_{m},1}^{T} & 1 \ \- {\hat{1}}_{\text{GNSS}_{m},2}^{T}
> & 1 \ \vdots & \vdots \ \- {\hat{1}}_{\text{GNSS}_{m},l}^{T} & 1 \
> \end{bmatrix}$ with ${\hat{1}}_{\text{GNSS}_{m},i} \equiv
> \frac{r_{s_{\text{GNSS}_{m},i}} - {\hat{r}}_{u}}{\left|
> r_{s_{\text{GNSS}_{m},i}} - {\hat{r}}_{u} \right|}$ where **r** s~GNSS _m,I_
> ~ is the satellite position vector for Svi of GNSS _~m~_ (calculated in 1)
> above), and ${\hat{r}}_{u}$is the estimate of the user location.
>
> e) Calculate the WLS solution according to [P. Axelrad, R.G. Brown]:
>
> $\Delta\hat{x} = \left( G^{T}\text{WG} \right)^{- 1}G^{T}\text{WΔρ}$
>
> f) Adding the $\Delta\hat{x}$to the initial state estimate gives an improved
> estimate of the state vector:
>
> $\hat{x} \rightarrow \hat{x} + \Delta\hat{x}$.
>
> 5) This new state vector $\hat{x}$can be used as new initial estimate and
> the procedure is repeated until the change in $\hat{x}$is sufficiently
> small.
**Step 5: Transformation from Cartesian coordinate system to Geodetic
coordinate system**
The state vector $\hat{x}$ calculated in Step 4 contains the MS position in
ECEF Cartesian coordinates together with the MS receiver clock bias relative
to the selected GNSS system time. Only the user position is of further
interest. It is usually desirable to convert from ECEF coordinates _xu, yu,
zu_ to geodetic latitude ϕ , longitude λ and altitude _h_ on the WGS84
reference ellipsoid.
**Step 6: Calculation of "2-D Position Errors"**
The latitude ϕ / longitude λ obtained after Step 5 is used to calculate the
2-D position error.

**Reference Test Scenario** **Interfering Signal** **Interferer relative power

Note: In calculating I1, the power of the delayed interferer burst is averaged

interferer**
* * *
**Reference Test Scenario** **Interfering Signal** **Interferer relative power
level** **TSC** **Interferer Delay** VDTS-4 Adjacent 1 - none no delay
* * *
In all reference test scenarios in tables Q.1-1 to Q.1-4, the co channel and
adjacent channel interferers are AQPSK modulated with SCPIR_DL = 0 dB. The
power of the interferer is measured before any receiver filtering and during
the active part of the desired burst (see 3GPP TS 45.004). No Training
Sequence Code (TSC) is used for the interferers, and thus the midamble is
filled with random data bits.
In some test scenarios an AWGN signal is added to the interferers. The AWGN
signal power is measured over a bandwidth of 270,833 kHz.
Power ramping according to the requirements in Annex B shall be applied to all
delayed interferers. The other interferers shall be random and continuous
modulated signals.
> NOTE: The non-delayed interferer is the same signal for which reference
> interference performance requirements normally apply (see clause 6.3).
In adjacent timeslots of the delayed interferers no power shall be applied.
The delay is measured from the same bit position in the wanted signal burst
and the interferer burst, where the position in the wanted signal is the
reference position.
**The C/I1 values in tables 2aa, 2ab and 2ag are ratios of received powers
expressed in dB; where C is the received power of the downlink signal using
Normal burst for AQPSK (see 3GPP TS 45.002) and I1 is the received power of
the dominant external interferer (Co-channel 1 in tables Q.1-1 to Q.1-3) for
VDTS-1 to VDTS-3 or the received power of the adjacent channel interferer for
VDTS-4 (Adjacent 1 in table Q.1-4).**

In all the reference scenarios in uplink, VUTS-1 to VUTS-4, the interferers
are GMSK modulated. The power of the interferer is measured before any
receiver filtering and during the active part of the desired burst (see 3GPP
TS 45.004). No Training Sequence Code (TSC) is used for the interferers, and
thus the midamble is filled with random data bits.
Power ramping according to the requirements in Annex B shall be applied to all
delayed interferers.
> NOTE: The non-delayed interferer is the same signal for which reference
> interference performance requirements normally apply (see clause 6.3).
In adjacent timeslots of the delayed interferers no power shall be applied.
The delay is measured from the same bit position in the burst of _VAMOS
subchannel 2_ signal and the interferer burst, where the position in _VAMOS
subchannel 2_ signal is the reference position.
The C/I1 values in table 2ac are ratios of received powers expressed in dB,
where C is the received power of VAMOS subchannel 2 using Normal burst for
GMSK (see 3GPP TS 45.002) and I1 is the received power of Co-channel 1
(VUTS-1, VUTS-3 and VUTS-4) or Adjacent channel 1 (VUTS-2). VAMOS subchannel 1
shall be at an input level relative to VAMOS sub-channel 2 according to the
Subchannel power imbalance ratio on uplink (SCPIR_UL) which is specified in
table 2ac.
The wanted signals VAMOS subchannel 2 and VAMOS subchannel 1 and the
interfering signals of the test scenarios in tables Q.2-1 to Q.2-4 are added
to both RX antennas.
# Q.3 Sensitivity test configuration in downlink
For reference sensitivity measurements, the measured level of the input signal
(in dBm) of the received AQPSK signal for which the reference performance is
to be satisfied are specified in tables 1s, 1t,1u, 1x and 1y.
# Q.4 Sensitivity test configuration in uplink
The received signal level in table 1v refers to the signal level of VAMOS
subchannel 2. In addition to the GMSK signal from VAMOS subchannel 2 at signal
level according to table 1v, the signal from VAMOS subchannel 1 is also added
at both the RX antennas. The ratio of the received power of VAMOS subchannel 2
relative to the received power of VAMOS subchannel 1 shall be equal to the
Subchannel power imbalance ratio on uplink (SCPIR_UL) as specified in table
1v.
# Q.5 Time and frequency offset in uplink
For uplink in VAMOS mode, i.e. both interference and sensitivity limited cases
_VAMOS subchannel 1_ is offset in time and frequency with respect to _VAMOS
subchannel 2_. In all these cases, the GMSK burst from _VAMOS subchannel 1_
is:
\- offset in time compared to _VAMOS subchannel_ 2 according to the
probability distribution: $p(\text{Time}\ \text{offset}) = \left{
\begin{matrix} 0\text{.}\text{25},\ \text{for}\ \text{Time}\ \text{offset}\ =
\ - 1\ \text{Normal}\ \text{Symbol}\ \text{Periods} \ 0\text{.}5,\ \text{for}\
\text{Time}\ \text{offset}\ = \ 0\ \text{Normal}\ \text{Symbol}\
\text{Periods} \ \begin{matrix} 0\text{.}\text{25},\ \text{for}\ \text{Time}\
\text{offset}\ = \ 1\ \text{Normal}\ \text{Symbol}\ \text{Periods} \ 0,\
\text{else} \ \end{matrix} \ \end{matrix} \right.\ $
\- offset in frequency compared to _VAMOS subchannel_ 2 according to the
probability distribution: $p(\text{Frequency}\ \text{offset}) = \
\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e\frac{{}^{{- \left( \text{Frequency}\
\text{offset} - \mu \right)}^{2}}}{2\sigma^{2}}$ where $\sigma$and $\mu$are
given in the table Q.5-1
Table Q.5-1 Frequency Offset Parameters for Paired Subchannel
* * *
**Frequency Band** **850/900** **1800** **1900** 45 Hz 90 Hz 95 Hz 10 Hz 17 Hz
17 Hz
* * *
The time and frequency offset of _VAMOS subchannel 1_ with respect to _VAMOS
subchannel 2_ shall be constant within a burst and may be selected in an
implementation dependent way such that the above probabilities are satisfied.
# Q.6 VAMOS DTX scenario in downlink
The purpose of this test case is to verify the VAMOS II and VAMOS III mobile
receiver performance when the paired _VAMOS subchannel_ user goes into and
comes out of DTX.
The modulation of the downlink VAMOS signal shall be switched between AQPSK
(with --10 dB SCPIR) and GMSK according to the following:
The power of the GMSK burst in the downlink in this test case shall be 10.5 dB
lower than the power of the AQPSK burst. The average input signal level over
all the bursts at the reference performance for the VAMOS II MS shall be as
per the table 1u and for the VAMOS III MS shall be as per the table 1y. The
reference performance according to section 6.2.1a shall be applicable for this
test case.
# Q.7 Correlation and antenna gain imbalance for VAMOS III MS
Since a VAMOS III MS utilizes receiver diversity by means of two antennas, a
set of diversity specific parameters have been defined. The sets consist of
different values of antenna correlation and antenna gain imbalance.
Table Q.7-1 VAMOS III diversity parameters
* * *
**Parameter set** **Antenna correlation,** $\rho$ **Antenna gain
imbalance,_G_** Set 1 0 0 dB Set 2 0.7 -6 dB
* * *
The correlation is defined as the magnitude of the complex correlation of the
signals received at the two antenna connectors of the MS. A correlation value
of 0 means the signals are uncorrelated. The antenna gain imbalance parameter
reflects the difference in received signal level at the two antenna
connectors. Thus, a value of -6 dB means that the signal on one antenna is
attenuated by 6 dB compared to the signal on the other connector. The channel
model setup when applying these parameters is illustrated below, where the
parameter, _G_ , models the antenna gain imbalance and $\rho$ is the antenna
correlation.

Figure Q.7.1: Single input -- dual output channel model for VAMOS III MS
The model consists of a single input signal, which is passed through two
fading channels. The multipath fading is independent Rayleigh fading processes
but the channel profile, e.g. TU50 is the same for each branch. The
correlation between the two branches is generated using the weighting factor,
$\rho$, which as mentioned is the magnitude of the complex correlation.
Antenna gain imbalance is applied by attenuating _Y~1~_ or _Y~2~_ by 6 dB as
indicated by the _G_ block on figure Q.7.1.
The multi interferer scenario (VDTS-2) is generated by expanding the single
input-dual output model as shown in figure Q.7.2. The model uses instances of
the single input dual output channel model to instantiate the interfering
signals. For sensitivity tests the single input -- dual output channel model
of figure Q.7.1 is sufficient. For single interferer scenarios (VDTS-1, VDTS-3
and VDTS-4), the model shown in figure Q.7.2 is applicable with one instance
of the single input -- dual output channel model for the desired signal and
one instance of the single input -- dual output channel model for the
interferer.

###### ## Annex R (normative): Reference Test Scenarios for Overlaid CDMA
# R.1 Frequency offset in uplink
For uplink channels in EC operation when multiple subchannels are assigned
different Overlaid CDMA codes an offset in frequency, generated separately for
each subchannel, shall be applied according to the Gaussian distribution below
where
> \- $\sigma$is 30 Hz
>
> \- x is the frequency offset
The frequency offset of each subchannel shall be constant within a burst with
the same offset applied in all blind physical layer transmissions of each
Overlaid CDMA subchannel according to its respective CC and may be selected in
an implementation dependent way such that the above probabilities are
satisfied.
###### ## Annex S (normative): Normalized coherency error
The normalized RMS ({width="0.2833333333333333in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}) is defined as the ratio of the maximum RMS
value of the error vector magnitude ({width="0.44166666666666665in"
height="0.175in"}) between any two consecutive bursts {width="0.15in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} and {width="0.15833333333333333in"
height="0.175in"}, from a set of blind physical layer transmissions in the
same TDMA frame, compared to the average RMS value over the set of blind
physical layer transmissions ({width="0.2833333333333333in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}). The normalized RMS is calculated over the
useful part of the burst. The normalized coherency error shall be measured
after a measurement receive filter at baseband. The specification is based on
using the specified, windowed, raised-cosine filter with roll-off 0.25 and
single side-band bandwidth of 90 kHz (see subclause 4.6.2).

Before taking the logarithm, the measured average of
{width="0.2833333333333333in" height="0.16666666666666666in"} over at least
200 TDMA frames ({width="0.23333333333333334in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"}) in case M=4 shall be computed. For M=4, the
TDMA frames over which the average is computed shall be spread over at least
50 separate FUAs (Fixed Uplink Allocations, see 3GPP TS 44.060 [38]), each
with a similar size of the allocation, between which EC-PACCH/D or EC-
PACCH/D/2TS is transmitted to the MS.
For M=2, the measured average of {width="0.2833333333333333in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} over at least 190 TDMA frames
({width="0.23333333333333334in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}) shall be
computed. The TDMA frames over which the average is computed shall be spread
over at least 6 EC Packet Channel Request messages (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [7]),
triggered by a matching paging request. Since the network does not respond to
the channel request, it enforces the MS to repeat its EC Packet Channel
Request for configured number of maximum retransmissions.
NOTE: For CC4 using 2 TS EC-RACH mapping, 8 EC Packet Paging Requests, with
configured EC_Max_Retrans = 7, occupy 192 TDMA frames. For EDAB, 6 EC Packet
Paging Requests, with configured EC_Max_Retrans = 5, occupy 396 TDMA frames.
For CC2 and CC3 using 2 TS EC-RACH mapping, a higher number of EC Packet
Channel Request messages need to be sent to fulfil the above requirement.
Then for M=4 or M=2, the measured average of {width="0.2833333333333333in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} shall be transferred to dB scale according to
{width="1.5666666666666667in" height="0.16666666666666666in"}
and is referred to as Normalized Coherency Error.
###### ## Annex T (normative): Calculation of the equivalent combined power
For measuring the equivalent combined power of four blind physical layer
transmissions per TDMA frame to which the coherency requirement in subclause
4.6.3 applies, the transmit signal is demodulated to a complex-valued baseband
signal. The measurement bandwidth shall be at least 300 kHz.
Let _Y_ ~1~(_k_) denote the complex-valued samples of the useful part of the
burst, sampled at the symbol times, from the first burst of blind physical
layer transmissions within a TDMA frame. Similarly, _Y_ ~2~(_k_), _Y_ ~3~(_k_)
and _Y_ ~4~(_k_) denote the corresponding samples from the second, third and
fourth burst of the same blind physical layer transmissions on the subsequent
timeslots in the same TDMA frame, respectively.
The equivalent combined signal Z(_k_) is calculated by summing up the samples
of the four bursts' useful parts without any compensation:
> _Z_(_k_) = _Y_ ~1~(_k_) + _Y_ ~2~(_k_) + _Y_ ~3~(_k_) + _Y_ ~4~(_k_)
where
> _k_ is the sample number 0 to 147 within the useful part of the burst.
The power of _Z_(_k_) is $\frac{1}{\text{148}}\sum_{k = 0}^{\text{147}}\left|
Z(k) \right|^{2}$.\ The equivalent combined power is the power of _Z_(_k_),
averaged over the number of TDMA frames measured.\ The equivalent combined
power shall then be converted to dBm scale.
> NOTE: Ideally, the power of _Z_(_k_) is 16 times the power of each of _Y_
> ~1~(_k_) to _Y_ ~4~(_k_).
