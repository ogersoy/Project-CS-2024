# 2 General
The radio subsystem is required to support a certain number of logical
channels that can be separated into two categories as defined in 3GPP TS
44.003:
i) the traffic channels (TCH\'s);
ii) the control channels.
More information is given about these logical channels in clause 3 which also
defines a number of special channels used by the radio sub‑system.
Clause 4 of this document describes the physical resource available to the
radio sub‑system, clause 5 defines physical channels based on that resource
and clause 6 specifies how the logical channels shall be mapped onto physical
channels. Figure 1 depicts this process.
With the Flexible Layer One (FLO), the radio subsystem is required to support
transport channels (see 3GPP TR 45.902). Clause 8 of this document describes
the mapping and multiplexing principles that are specific to FLO. Because FLO
offers transport channels instead of logical channels, any reference to
logical channels, with the exception of SACCH, does not apply to FLO.
Otherwise, and unless otherwise stated, the multiplexing principles described
in this document are equally applicable to FLO (e.g. physical resource and
physical channels).
# 3 Logical channels
## 3.1 General
This subclause describes the logical channels that are supported by the radio
subsystem.
## 3.2 Traffic channels
### 3.2.1 General
Traffic channels (TCH\'s) are intended to carry either encoded speech or user
data in circuit switched mode. Five general forms of traffic channel are
defined:
i) Full rate traffic channel (TCH/F). This channel carries information at a
gross rate of 22,8 kbit/s.
ii) Half rate traffic channel (TCH/H). This channel carries information at a
gross rate of 11,4 kbit/s.
iii) Enhanced circuit switched full rate traffic channel (E-TCH/F). This
channel carries information at a gross rate of 69,6 kbit/s including the
stealing symbols.
iv) 8-PSK full rate traffic channel (O-TCH/F). This channel carries
information at a gross rate of 68,4 kbit/s.
v) 8-PSK half rate traffic channel (O-TCH/H). This channel carries information
at a gross rate of 34,2 kbit/s.
Packet data traffic channels (PDTCH\'s) are intended to carry user data in
packet switched mode. For the purpose of this Technical Specification, any
reference to traffic channel does not apply to PDTCH unless explicitly stated.
All traffic channels are bi-directional unless otherwise stated.
Unidirectional downlink full rate channels, TCH/FD, are defined as the
downlink part of the corresponding TCH/F.
Multiple full rate channels can be assigned to the same MS. This is referred
to as multislot configurations, which is defined in subclause 6.4.2.1.
Multiple packet data traffic channels can be assigned to the same MS or, in
the case of point-to-multipoint transmission, a group of MSs. This is referred
to as multislot packet configurations, as defined in subclause 6.4.2.2 and
subclause 6.4.2.3a.
A combination of a half rate traffic channel and a half rate packet data
traffic channel on the same basic physical channel can be assigned to the same
MS as defined in subclause 6.4.2.3.
A combination of a traffic channel and one or more full rate packet data
traffic channels can be assigned to the same MS.
A pair of speech traffic channels along with their associated control channels
sharing the same timeslot number (see subclause 4.3), ARFCN (see subclause
6.2.3) and TDMA frame number (see subclause 4.3) is referred to as a _VAMOS
pair_. The speech traffic channels along with their associated control
channels in a _VAMOS pair_ are said to be in _VAMOS mode_ and are referred to
as _VAMOS subchannels_.
In case of speech traffic channels in _VAMOS mode_ , up to 4 speech traffic
channels can be mapped on the same basic physical channel both in downlink and
uplink (see subclause 6.4.1).
The specific traffic channels available in the categories of speech and user
data are defined in the subclauses following.
### 3.2.2 Speech traffic channels
The following traffic channels are defined to carry encoded speech:
i) full rate traffic channel for speech (TCH/FS);
ii) half rate traffic channel for speech (TCH/HS);
iii) enhanced full rate traffic channel for speech (TCH/EFS);
iv) adaptive full rate traffic channel for speech (TCH/AFS);
v) adaptive half rate traffic channel for speech (TCH/AHS);
vi) adaptive full rate traffic channel for wideband speech (TCH/WFS);
vii) adaptive half rate 8PSK traffic channel for speech (O-TCH/AHS);
viii) adaptive full rate 8PSK traffic channel for wideband speech (O-TCH/WFS);
ix) adaptive half rate 8PSK traffic channel for wideband speech (O-TCH/WHS).
### 3.2.3 Circuit switched data traffic channels
The following traffic channels are defined to carry user data:
i) full rate traffic channel for 9,6 kbit/s user data (TCH/F9.6);
ii) full rate traffic channel for 4,8 kbit/s user data (TCH/F4.8);
iii) half rate traffic channel for 4,8 kbit/s user data (TCH/H4.8);
iv) half rate traffic channel for ≤ 2,4 kbit/s user data (TCH/H2.4);
v) full rate traffic channel for ≤ 2,4 kbit/s user data (TCH/F2.4);
vi) full rate traffic channel for 14,4 kbit/s user data (TCH/F14.4);
vii) enhanced circuit switched full rate traffic channel for 28,8 kbit/s user
data (E-TCH/F28.8);
viii) enhanced circuit switched full rate traffic channel for 32,0 kbit/s user
data (E-TCH/F32.0);
ix) enhanced circuit switched full rate traffic channel for 43.2 kbit/s user
data (E-TCH/F43.2).
### 3.2.4 Packet data traffic channels (PDTCH and EC-PDTCH)
A PDTCH/F corresponds to the resource assigned to a single MS or, in the case
of point-to-multipoint transmission, to multiple MSs for user data
transmission. An EC-PDTCH/F always corresponds to the resource assigned to a
single MS in BTTI configuration.
In BTTI configuration, an (EC-)PDTCH/F is mapped onto one physical channel
(see subclause 6.3.2.1). Due to the dynamic multiplexing onto the same
physical channel of different logical channels (see subclause 6.3.2), an
(EC‑)PDTCH/F in BTTI configuration carries information at an instantaneous bit
rate ranging from 0 to a maximum value dependent on the modulation and on the
symbol rate, as given in table 3.2.4-1.
Table 3.2.4-1: Maximum instantaneous bit rate (kbit/s) for different
modulations
* * *
Modulation Maximum instantaneous bit rate (kbit/s)  
Normal symbol rate^1^ Higher symbol rate^1^ GMSK 22,8 - QPSK - 55,2 8-PSK 69,6
- 16QAM 92,8 110,4 32QAM 116,0 138,0 NOTE: see 3GPP TS 45.004 [14]
* * *
In RTTI configuration, a PDTCH/F is mapped onto two physical channels, i.e. a
PDCH-pair (see subclause 6.3.2.1). A PDTCH/F in RTTI configuration carries
information at an instantaneous bit rate ranging from 0 to a maximum value
which is double the corresponding value for that modulation and the symbol
rate.
A PDTCH/H corresponds to the resource assigned to a single MS on half a
physical channel for user data transmission. The maximum instantaneous bit
rate for a PDTCH/H is half that for a PDTCH/F. A PDTCH/H is only possible in
BTTI configuration if FANR is not activated (see 3GPP TS 44.060 [11]).
All packet data traffic channels are uni-directional, either uplink
((EC-)PDTCH/U), for a mobile originated packet transfer or downlink
((EC-)PDTCH/D) for a mobile terminated packet transfer.
In the case of point-to-multipoint transmission, a PDTCH/D can be used for
communication with multiple MSs.
## 3.3 Control channels
### 3.3.1 General
Control channels are intended to carry signalling or synchronization data.
Four categories of control channel are defined: broadcast, common, dedicated
and CTS control channels. Specific channels within these categories are
defined in the subclauses following.
### 3.3.2 Broadcast channels
#### 3.3.2.1 Frequency correction channels (FCCH and CFCCH)
The frequency correction channel carries information for frequency correction
of the mobile station. It is required only for the operation of the radio
sub‑system. Different mapping is used for FCCH and COMPACT CFCCH (see clause
7).
#### 3.3.2.2 Synchronization channels
##### 3.3.2.2.0 General
The synchronization channel carries information for frame synchronization of
the mobile station and identification of a base transceiver station. It is
required only for the operation of the radio sub‑system. Different channels
are used for SCH, EC-SCH and COMPACT CSCH.
##### 3.3.2.2.1 Synchronization channel (SCH)
Specifically the synchronization channel (SCH) shall contain two encoded
parameters:
a) Base transceiver station identity code (BSIC): 6 bits (before channel
coding) consists of 3 bits of PLMN colour code with range 0 to 7 and 3 bits of
BS colour code with range 0 to 7 as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].
b) Reduced TDMA frame number (RFN): 19 bits (before channel coding) =
T1 (11 bits) range 0 to 2047 = FN div ( 26 x 51)
T2 (5 bits) range 0 to 25 = FN mod 26
T3\' (3 bits) range 0 to 4 = (T3 ‑ 1) div 10
where
T3 (6 bits) range 0 to 50 = FN mod 51
and
FN = TDMA frame number as defined in subclause 4.3.3.
3GPP TS 44.006 [9] and 3GPP TS 44.018 [10] specify the precise bit ordering,
3GPP TS 45.003 [13] the channel coding of the above parameters and 3GPP TS
45.010 [17] defines how the TDMA frame number can be calculated from T1, T2,
and T3\'.
##### 3.3.2.2.2 COMPACT synchronization channel (CSCH)
The COMPACT packet synchronization channel CSCH shall contain two encoded
parameters:
a) Base transceiver station identity code (BSIC): 6 bits (before channel
coding) consists of 3 bits of PLMN colour code with range 0 to 7 and 3 bits BS
colour code with range 0 to 7 as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].
b) Reduced TDMA frame number (RFN): 19 bits (before channel coding) =
R1 (10 bits) range 0 to 1023 = FN div (51 x 52)
R2 (6 bits) range 0 to 50 = (FN div 52) mod 51
TG (2 bits) range 0 to 3
Reserved (1 bit)
where
FN = TDMA frame number as defined in subclause 4.3.3
and
TG = time group as defined in subclause 4.3.4.
3GPP TS 44.006 [9] and 3GPP TS 44.018 [10] specify the precise bit ordering,
3GPP TS 45.003 [13] the channel coding of the above parameters and 3GPP TS
45.010 [17] defines how the TDMA frame number can be calculated from R1 and
R2.
##### 3.3.2.2.3 Extended Coverage synchronization channel (EC-SCH)
The extended coverage synchronization channel (EC-SCH) shall contain six
encoded parameters, and three spare bits:
a) Base transceiver station identity code (BSIC): 9 bits (before channel
coding) consists of 3 bits of PLMN colour code with range 0 to 7, 3 bits of BS
colour code with range 0 to 7 and 3 bits of Radio frequency Colour Code with
range 0 to 7 as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].
b) Parameters used to identify the Reduced TDMA frame number per quarter
hyperframe (RFN~QH~): 12 bits (before channel coding) =
T1\' (8 bits) range 0 to 255 = (FN div (51*26*2)) mod 256
> NOTE 1: T1\' identifies one of 256 pairs of superframes within a quarter
> hyperframe
T2\' (4 bits) range 0 to 12 = (FN div (51*4)) mod 13
> NOTE 2: T2\' identifies a specific set of four contiguous 51-multiframes
> within a pair of superframes, i.e. 52 51-multiframes.
c) Implicit Reject Status: 2 bits
See 3GPP TS 44.018 [10].
d) EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK: 3 bits
See 3GPP TS 44.018 [10].
> NOTE 2a: Indicating a new value for the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK in the EC-SCH
> shall start within the same 51-multiframe used to begin the transmission of
> the corresponding new EC SI information.
e) RACH Access Control: 1 bit
See 3GPP TS 44.018 [10].
In addition, the following parameters are required to derive the Reduced frame
number per quarter hyperframe (RFN~QH~):
f) T2\'\' (2 bits) range 0 to 3 = (FN div 51) mod 4
> NOTE 3: T2\'\' identifies the specific 51-multiframe in the set of four
> contiguous 51-multiframes. T2\'\' is signalled through the cyclic shift
> pattern used on the EC-SCH, see 3GPP TS 45.003 [13].
>
> g) T3 (see subclause 3.3.2.2.1) will be determined by the device through the
> identification of the mapping of the FCCH onto the specific TDMA frames
> within the 51-multiframe, see Table 3.
After the decoding of EC-SCH and the determination of T3, the MS will have
knowledge about the frame structure within a quarter hyperframe. The
QUARTER_HYPERFRAME_INDICATOR is acquired when receiving an Immediate
Assignment, see 3GPP TS 44.018 [10].
QUARTER_HYPERFRAME_INDICATOR (2 bits) range 0...3 = FN div (26*51*512)
After acquisition of the QUARTER_HYPERFRAME_INDICATOR, the MS will have
knowledge about the frame structure within a hyperframe.
3GPP TS 44.006 [9] and 3GPP TS 44.018 [10] specify the precise bit ordering,
3GPP TS 45.003 [13] the channel coding of the above parameters and 3GPP TS
45.010 [17] defines how the TDMA frame number (FN as defined in subclause
4.3.3) can be calculated from T1\', T2\', T2\'\', T3 and the
QUARTER_HYPERFRAME_INDICATOR.
#### 3.3.2.3 Broadcast control channel (BCCH)
The broadcast control channel broadcasts general information on a base
transceiver station per base transceiver station basis. Of the many parameters
contained in the BCCH, the use of the following parameters, as defined in 3GPP
TS 44.018 are referred to in subclause 6.5:
a) CCCH_CONF which indicates the organization of the common control channels:
From this parameter, the number of common control channels (BS_CC_CHANS) and
whether or not CCCH or SDCCH are combined (BS_CCCH_SDCCH_COMB = true or false)
are derived as follows:
* * *
CCCH_CONF BS_CC_CHANS BS_CCCH_SDCCH_COMB 000 1 false 001 1 true 010 2 false
100 3 false 110 4 false
* * *
b) BS_AG_BLKS_RES which indicates the number of blocks on each common control
channel reserved for access grant messages:
3 bits (before channel coding) range 0 to 7.
In a routing area where eDRX is supported, the number of blocks per
51-multiframe reserved for AGCH is subject to the requirement that all cells
in the routing area shall have the same number of paging blocks per
51-multiframe.
c) BS_PA_MFRMS which indicates the number of 51-multiframes between
transmission of paging messages to mobiles of the same paging group:
3 bits (before channel coding) range 2 to 9.
An exception is the case where a MS has negotiated the use of eDRX in a
Routing Area where eDRX is supported (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [10]) in which case
the BS_PA_MFRMS does not apply. In this case the number of 51-multiframes
between transmissions of paging messages is based on the eDRX value negotiated
between the MS and the network - see Table 6.5.6a-1.
d) support of GPRS
The BCCH shall indicate whether or not packet switched traffic is supported.
If packet switched traffic is supported and if the PBCCH exists, then the BCCH
shall broadcast the position of the packet data channel (PDCH), as defined in
subclause 6.3.2.1, carrying the PBCCH. (See sub-clause 1.3).
#### 3.3.2.3a Extended coverage broadcast control channel (EC-BCCH)
The extended coverage broadcast control channel broadcasts general information
on a base transceiver station per base transceiver station basis. Of the many
parameters contained in the EC-BCCH, the use of the following parameter, as
defined in 3GPP TS 44.018 [10] is referred to in subclause 6.5:
a) EC_BS_CC_CHANS which indicates the number of extended coverage common
control channels.
#### 3.3.2.4 Packet Broadcast Control Channels
##### 3.3.2.4.1 Packet Broadcast Control Channel (PBCCH)
The PBCCH broadcasts parameters used by the MS to access the network for
packet transmission operation. In addition to those parameters the PBCCH
reproduces the information transmitted on the BCCH to allow circuit switched
operation, such that a MS in GPRS attached mode monitors the PBCCH only, if it
exists. The existence of the PBCCH in the cell is indicated on the BCCH. (See
sub-clause 1.3). In the absence of PBCCH, the BCCH shall be used to broadcast
information for packet operation.
Of the many parameters contained in the PBCCH, the use of the following
parameters, as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060 are referred to in subclauses 6.5 and
6.3.2:
a) BS_PBCCH_BLKS (1,...,4) indicates the number of blocks allocated to the
PBCCH in the multiframe (see subclause 6.3.2.3.3).
b) BS_PCC_CHANS indicates the number of physical channels carrying PCCCHs
including the physical channel carrying the PBCCH
c) BS_PAG_BLKS_RES indicates the number of blocks on each PDCH carrying PCCCH
per multiframe where neither PPCH nor PBCCH should appear (see subclause
6.3.2.3.4). The BS_PAG_BLKS_RES value shall fulfil the condition :
BS_PAG_BLKS_RES \ a) BS_PBCCH_BLKS (1,...,4) indicates the number of blocks allocated to the
> CPBCCH in the multiframe (see subclause 6.3.2.3.3a).
>
> b) BS_PCC_CHANS indicates the number of radio frequency channels per cell
> carrying CPCCCHs including the radio frequency channel carrying the CPBCCH.
c) BS_PAG_BLKS_RES indicates the number of blocks on each radio frequency
channel carrying CPCCCH per multiframe where neither CPPCH nor CPBCCH should
appear (see subclause 6.3.2.3.4a). BS_PAG_BLKS_RES cannot be greater than 8.
> d) BS_PRACH_BLKS indicates the number of blocks reserved in a fixed way to
> the CPRACH channel on any radio frequency channel carrying CPCCCH (see
> subclause 6.3.2.2.3a).
>
> e) NIB_CCCH_0, NIB_CCCH_1, NIB_CCCH_2, and NIB_CCCH_3 indicate the number of
> downlink blocks per multiframe designated as idle to protect CPBCCH and
> CPCCCH blocks for non-serving time groups (see subclause 6.5.1).
f) LARGE_CELL_OP indicates which type of cell size is used: nominal or large.

xx) Fast, O-TCH/F associated, control channel (O-FACCH/F).
All associated control channels have the same direction (bi-directional or
unidirectional) as the channels they are associated to. The unidirectional
SACCH/MD, SACCH/MPD and EPCCH/MD are defined as the downlink part of SACCH/M,
SACCH/MP and EPCCH/M respectively.
#### 3.3.4.2 Packet dedicated control channels
i) The Packet Associated Control channel (PACCH): The PACCH is bi-directional.
For description purposes PACCH/U is used for the uplink and PACCH/D for the
downlink. The PACCH shall be transmitted using the same configuration (BTTI or
RTTI) of the PDTCH that it is associated with.
ii) Packet Timing advance control channel uplink (PTCCH/U): Used to transmit
random access bursts to allow estimation of the timing advance for one MS in
packet transfer mode.
iii) Packet Timing advance control channel downlink (PTCCH/D): Used to
transmit timing advance updates for several MS. One PTCCH/D is paired with
several PTCCH/U\'s.
#### 3.3.4.3 Extended Coverage Packet dedicated control channels
i) The Extended Coverage Packet Associated Control channel (EC-PACCH): The EC-
PACCH is bi-directional. For description purposes EC-PACCH/U is used for the
uplink and EC-PACCH/D for the downlink. Both the EC-PACCH and EC-PDTCH shall
be transmitted using the Coverage Class of the direction they are transmitted
in. The Coverage Class need not be the same on uplink and downlink.
### 3.3.5 Cell Broadcast Channel (CBCH)
The CBCH, downlink only, is used to carry the short message service cell
broadcast (SMSCB). The CBCH uses the same physical channel as the SDCCH.
### 3.3.6 CTS control channels
Four types of CTS control channels are defined:
#### 3.3.6.1 CTS beacon channel (BCH)
The BCH is used to provide frequency and synchronization information in the
downlink. It is made up of a pair of CTSBCH-SB (Synchronization burst) and
CTSBCH-FB (Frequency correction burst).
The CTSBCH-FB carries information for frequency correction of the mobile
station. It is required only for the operation of the radio sub‑system.
The CTSBCH-SB carries signalling information and identification of a CTS-FP.
Specifically the CTSBCH-SB shall contain five encoded parameters:
a) status of the CTS-FP radio resources : 1 bit (before channel coding;
b) flag indicating the presence of CTSPCH in the next 52-multiframe : 1 bit
(before channel coding);
c) flag indicating whether the CTS-FP is currently performing timeslot
shifting on CTSBCH: 1 bit (before channel coding);
d) CTS control channels (except CTSBCH) timeslot number for the next
52-multiframe (TNC): 3 bits (before channel coding);
e) CTS-FP beacon identity (FPBI) : 19 bits (before channel coding), as defined
in 3GPP TS 23.003.
3GPP TS 44.056 specifies the precise bit ordering and 3GPP TS 45.003 the
channel coding of the above parameters.
#### 3.3.6.2 CTS paging channel (CTSPCH)
Downlink only, used to broadcast information for paging.
#### 3.3.6.3 CTS access request channel (CTSARCH)
Uplink only, used to request assignment of a dedicated RR connection.
#### 3.3.6.4 CTS access grant channel (CTSAGCH)
Downlink only, used to grant a dedicated RR connection.
## 3.4 Combination of channels
Only certain combinations of channels are allowed as defined in 3GPP TS
44.003. Subclause 6.4 lists the combinations in relation to basic physical
channels.
# 4 The physical resource
## 4.1 General
The physical resource available to the radio sub‑system is an allocation of
part of the radio spectrum. This resource is partitioned both in frequency and
time. Frequency is partitioned by radio frequency channels (RFCHs) divided
into bands as defined in 3GPP TS 45.005. Time is partitioned by timeslots,
TDMA frames, and (for COMPACT) time groups and 52-multiframe number as defined
in subclause 4.3 of this Technical Specification.
## 4.2 Radio frequency channels
### 4.2.1 Cell allocation and mobile allocation
3GPP TS 45.005 defines radio frequency channels (RFCHs), and allocates numbers
to all the radio frequency channels available to the system. Each cell is
allocated a subset of these channels, defined as the cell allocation (CA). One
radio frequency channel of the cell allocation shall be used to carry
synchronization information and the BCCH, this shall be known as BCCH carrier.
The subset of the cell allocation, allocated to a particular mobile, shall be
known as the mobile allocation (MA).
For COMPACT, one radio frequency channel of the cell allocation shall be used
to carry synchronization information and the CPBCCH, this shall be known as
the primary COMPACT carrier. All other radio frequency channels of the cell
allocation shall be known as secondary COMPACT carriers.
### 4.2.2 Downlink and uplink
The downlink comprises radio frequency channels used in the base transceiver
station to Mobile Station direction.
The uplink comprises radio frequency channels used in the mobile station to
base transceiver station direction.
## 4.3 Timeslots, TDMA frames, and time groups
### 4.3.1 General
A timeslot shall have a duration of 3/5 200 seconds (≈ 577 µs). Eight
timeslots shall form a TDMA frame (≈ 4,62 ms in duration).
At the base transceiver station the TDMA frames on all of the radio frequency
channels in the downlink shall be aligned. The same shall apply to the uplink
(see 3GPP TS 45.010).
At the base transceiver station the start of a TDMA frame on the uplink is
delayed by the fixed period of 3 timeslots from the start of the TDMA frame on
the downlink (see figure 2).
At the mobile station this delay will be variable to allow adjustment for
signal propagation delay. The process of adjusting this advance is known as
adaptive frame alignment and is detailed in 3GPP TS 45.010.
The staggering of TDMA frames used in the downlink and uplink is in order to
allow the same timeslot number to be used in the downlink and uplink whilst
avoiding the requirement for the mobile station to transmit and receive
simultaneously. The period includes time for adaptive frame alignment,
transceiver tuning and receive/transmit switching (see figure 4).
### 4.3.2 Timeslot number
The timeslots within a TDMA frame shall be numbered from 0 to 7 and a
particular timeslot shall be referred to by its timeslot number (TN).
### 4.3.3 TDMA frame number
TDMA frames shall be numbered by a frame number (FN). The frame number shall
be cyclic and shall have a range of 0 to FN_MAX where FN_MAX = (26 x 51 x
2048) ‑1 = 2715647 as defined in 3GPP TS 45.010. For COMPACT, FN_MAX = (52 x
51 x 1024) -1 = 2715647. The frame number shall be incremented at the end of
each TDMA frame.
The complete cycle of TDMA frame numbers from 0 to FN_MAX is defined as a
hyperframe. A hyperframe consists of 2048 superframes where a superframe is
defined as 26 x 51 TDMA frames. For COMPACT, a hyperframe consists of 1024
superframes where a superframe is defined as 52 x 51 TDMA frames. A
26‑multiframe, comprising 26 TDMA frames, is used to support traffic and
associated control channels and a 51- multiframe, comprising 51 TDMA frames,
is used to support broadcast, common control and stand alone dedicated control
(and their associated control) channels. Hence a superframe may be considered
as 51 traffic/associated control multiframes or 26 broadcast/common control
multiframes. A 52‑multiframe, comprising two 26‑multiframes, is used to
support packet data traffic and control channels.
The need for a hyperframe of a substantially longer period than a superframe
arises from the requirements of the encryption process which uses FN as an
input parameter.
### 4.3.4 Time group
Used for COMPACT, time groups shall be numbered from 0 to 3 and a particular
time group shall be referred to by its time group number (TG) (see subclause
3.3.2.2.2). At block B0 and frame number (FN) mod 208 = 0, time group numbers
(TG) are associated with timeslot numbers (TN) as follows:
* * *
TG TN 0 1 1 3 2 5 3 7
* * *
For COMPACT, a cell is assigned one time group number (TG) on a primary
COMPACT carrier. This is known as the serving time group. Other cells may be
assigned other time groups on the same carrier.
# 5 Physical channels
## 5.1 General
A physical channel uses a combination of frequency and time division
multiplexing and is defined as a sequence of radio frequency channels and time
slots. The complete definition of a particular physical channel consists of a
description in the frequency domain, and a description in the time domain.
The description in the frequency domain is addressed in subclause 5.4; the
description in the time domain is addressed in subclause 5.5.
## 5.2 Bursts
### 5.2.1 General
A burst is a period of RF carrier which is modulated by a data stream. A burst
therefore represents the physical content of a timeslot except for the case of
ESAB (see sub-clause 5.2.10) which represents the physical content of 2
consecutive timeslots.
### 5.2.2 Types of burst and burst timing
A timeslot is divided into 156,25 normal symbol periods or 187,5 reduced
symbol periods (see 3GPP TS 45.010). For normal symbol period bursts, an
integral symbol period implementation option with a timeslot length of 157
normal symbol periods on timeslots with TN = 0 and 4, and 156 normal symbol
periods on timeslots with TN = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 can be used. In this case,
the same timeslot length is also used for reduced symbol period bursts,
resulting in a timeslot length of 188.4 reduced symbol periods on timeslots
with TN = 0 and 4, and 187.2 reduced symbol periods on timeslots with TN = 1,
2, 3, 5, 6 and 7. In case of EC-GSM-IoT, only normal symbol period bursts with
the integral symbol period implementation option shall be used.
The modulating rate is assumed to be the normal symbol rate (see 3GPP TS
45.004) unless otherwise stated.
For GMSK modulation (see 3GPP TS 45.004) a symbol is equivalent to a bit. A
particular bit period within a timeslot is referenced by a bit number (BN),
with the first bit period being numbered 0, and the last (1/4) bit period
being numbered 156, in case of non-integer symbol timeslot.
For AQPSK modulation (see 3GPP TS 45.004) one symbol corresponds to a pair of
bits mapped as described in 3GPP TS 45.004. Each bit in the bit pair belongs
to a different _VAMOS subchannel_ in the _VAMOS pair_. A particular bit period
within a timeslot is referenced by a bit number (BN), with the first bit being
numbered 0, and the last (1/2) bit being numbered 312, in case of non-integer
symbol timeslot. The bit pairs are mapped to the symbols as described in 3GPP
TS 45.004. The AQPSK modulation is used only at the normal symbol rate and
only in the downlink.
For 8PSK modulation (see 3GPP TS 45.004) one symbol corresponds to three bits.
A particular bit period within a timeslot is referenced by a bit number (BN),
with the first bit being numbered 0, and the last (3/4) bit being numbered
468, in case of non-integer symbol timeslot. The bits are mapped to symbols in
ascending order according to 3GPP TS 45.004.
For 16QAM modulation (see 3GPP TS 45.004) one symbol corresponds to four bits.
A particular bit period within a timeslot is referenced by a bit number (BN),
with the first bit being numbered 0, and the last bit being numbered 624 for
normal symbol rate bursts. When the modulating rate is the higher symbol rate,
the last bit is numbered 749. The bits are mapped to symbols in ascending
order according to 3GPP TS 45.004.
For 32QAM modulation (see 3GPP TS 45.004) one symbol corresponds to five bits.
A particular bit period within a timeslot is referenced by a bit number (BN),
with the first bit being numbered 0, and the last (1/4) bit being numbered
781, in case of non-integer symbol timeslot for normal symbol rate bursts.
When the modulating rate is the higher symbol rate, the last (1/2, in case of
uniform timeslot length) bit is numbered 937. The bits are mapped to symbols
in ascending order according to 3GPP TS 45.004.
For QPSK modulation (see 3GPP TS 45.004) one symbol corresponds to two bits. A
particular bit period within a timeslot is referenced by a bit number (BN),
with the first bit being numbered 0, and the last bit being numbered 374. The
bits are mapped to symbols in ascending order according to 3GPPTS45.004. QPSK
modulation is used only at the higher symbol rate.
In the subclauses following, the transmission timing of a burst within a
timeslot is defined in terms of bit number. The bit with the lowest bit number
is transmitted first.
Different types of burst exist in the system. One characteristic of a burst is
its useful duration. This document, in the subclauses following, defines full
bursts of 147 normal symbol periods useful duration, full bursts of 176
reduced symbol periods useful duration (see 3GPP TS 45.010), a short burst of
87 normal symbol periods useful duration (see subclause 5.2.7) and a long
burst of 244 normal symbol periods useful duration (see subclause 5.2.10). The
useful part of a burst is defined as beginning from half way through symbol
number 0. The definition of the useful part of a burst needs to be considered
in conjunction with the requirements placed on the phase and amplitude
characteristics of a burst as specified in 3GPP TS 45.004 and 45.005.
The period between bursts appearing in successive timeslots is termed the
guard period. Subclause 5.2.8 details constraints which relate to the guard
period.

The \"training sequence bits\" are defined as modulating bits with states as
given in one of the TSC sets defined in table 5.2.3a, 5.2.3b, 5.2.3c and
5.2.3d, according to the training sequence code, TSC. The choice of the TSC
set from which the training sequence bits are selected is described in 3GPP TS
44.018. For (EC-)BCCH and CCCH, the TSC must be equal to the BCC, as defined
in 3GPP TS 23.003 and shall be selected from the TSC Set 1.
For EC-PCH and EC-AGCH, the TSC shall be selected from the TSC Set 1, if the
EC-PCH / EC-AGCH block, is designated to MSs in CC1 only, and shall be
selected from TSC Set 2 if the EC-PCH / EC-AGCH block, is designated to at
least one MS in a higher coverage class (CC2, CC3 or CC4).
In networks supporting E-OTD Location services (see 3GPP TS 43.059), the use
of normal bursts on BCCH frequencies with TSC from the TSC Set 2, TSC set 3 or
TSC set 4 might degrade E-OTD Location service performance.

For CTS control channels, the TSC shall be selected from TSC set 1 and defined
by the 3 LSBs (BN3, BN2, BN1) of the FPBI (specified in 3GPP TS 23.003).
Under certain circumstances only half the encrypted bits present in a normal
burst will contain complete information. For downlink DTX operation on TCH‑FS
and TCH‑HS, when a traffic frame (as defined in 3GPP TS 46.031) is scheduled
for transmission and one of its adjacent traffic frames is not scheduled for
transmission, the other half of the encrypted bits in the normal bursts
associated with the scheduled traffic frame shall contain partial SID
information from any associated SID frame, with the appropriate stealing flags
BN60 or BN87 set to 0. In other cases the binary state of the remaining bits
is not specified.
#### 5.2.3.2 Normal burst for AQPSK (downlink only)
This burst format shall be used in downlink in _VAMOS mode_ when both the
_VAMOS subchannels_ in the _VAMOS pair_ have bursts scheduled for
transmission. The bits from the pair of Normal bursts for GMSK from the two
_VAMOS subchannels_ shall be interleaved together to form the Normal burst for
AQPSK as follows (bits are grouped in symbols separated by ;):
$\left( \text{BN}0,\ \text{BN}1;\ \text{BN}2,\text{BN}3;\
\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\
\text{BN}\text{309};\text{BN}\text{310},\text{BN}\text{311};\text{BN}\text{312},\text{BN}\text{313}
\right) = \left( \text{BN}^{0}0,\ \text{BN}^{1}0;\ \text{BN}^{0}1,\
\text{BN}^{1}1;\ \text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\ \text{BN}^{0}\text{155},\
\text{BN}^{1}\text{155};\ \text{BN}^{0}\text{156},\ \text{BN}^{1}\text{156}
\right)$, $\text{BN}^{0}0,\
\text{BN}^{0}1,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{BN}^{0}\text{156}$
and $\text{BN}^{1}0,\
\text{BN}^{1}1,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}\text{BN}^{1}\text{156}$
are the bits numbered BN0, BN1, ... BN156 in the Normal bursts for GMSK for
each of the two _VAMOS subchannels_ respectively.
The mapping of TSCs onto bit numbers for AQPSK is dependent on the TSC sets
selection and shall follow table 5.2.3e:

The \"training sequence bits\" are defined as modulating bits with states as
given in table 5.2.3f or table 5.2.3g, depending on if the TSC is assigned
from TSC Set 1 or TSC Set 2, according to the training sequence code, TSC. The
choice of the TSC set from which the training sequence bits are selected is
described in 3GPP TS 44.018 and in 3GPP TS 44.060. . In networks supporting
E-OTD Location services (see 3GPP TS 43.059), the use of normal bursts on BCCH
frequencies with TSC from the TSC Set 2 might degrade E-OTD Location service
performance.

‑ where the \"training sequence bits\" are defined as modulating bits with
states as given in table 5.2.3j or 5.2.3k, depending on if the TSC is assigned
from TSC Set 1 or TSC Set 2, according to the training sequence code, TSC. The
choice of the TSC set from which the training sequence bits are selected is
described in 3GPP TS 44.018 and in 3GPP TS 44.060. In networks supporting
E-OTD Location services (see 3GPP TS 43.059), the use of 32QAM modulation on
BCCH frequencies might degrade E-OTD Location service performance.

### 5.2.8 Guard period
The guard period is provided because it is required for the MSs that
transmission be attenuated for the period between bursts with the necessary
ramp up and down occurring during the guard periods as defined in 3GPP TS
45.005. A base transceiver station is not required to have a capability to
ramp down and up between adjacent bursts, but is required to have a capability
to ramp down and up for non‑used time‑slots, as defined in 3GPP TS 45.005. In
any case where the amplitude of transmission is ramped up and down, then by
applying an appropriate modulation bit stream interference to other RF
channels can be minimized.
In some cases, there is more than one option for the duration of the guard
period. The actual duration of the guard period between bursts with different
symbol rates is defined in 3GPP TS 45.010.

### 5.2.11 Extended Dual Slot Access burst (EDAB)
The extended dual slot access burst is specified for uplink coverage class CC5
in EC operation for the 2 TS EC-RACH format. It consists of two elementary
bursts, the first part being transmitted in a burst with equal size to the
active part of the normal burst, with a timeslot length of 157 normal symbol
periods on timeslots with TN = 0 and 4, and 156 normal symbol periods on
timeslots with TN = 2 and 6, and the second and last part being transmitted in
the consecutive TN in the same TDMA frame in a burst with equal size to the
active part of the access burst with a timeslot length of 156 normal symbol
periods. Both parts are specified in tables 5.2.11-1a and 5.2.11-1b.
If the Access_Timeslot parameter in EC SI 2 set to '1' (indicating 2 TS EC-
RACH mapping), an EC capable mobile in coverage class CC5 using EC-RACH format
as EDAB (refer 3GPP TS 44.018 EC SI 2 parameter CC5_EC-RACH_FORMAT_IND), shall
access the network using the training sequence TS7.
If the serving cell supports all coverage classes (i.e CC1 to CC5) and if the
Access_Timeslot parameter in EC SI 2 set to '0' (indicating 1 TS EC-RACH
mapping), an EC capable mobile in coverage class CC5 using EC-RACH format as
EDAB (refer 3GPP TS 44.018 EC SI 2 parameter CC5_EC-RACH_FORMAT_IND), shall
access the network using the training sequence TS7.
If the serving cell supports four or less coverage classes (i.e. CC2 or CC3 or
both may not be supported) and the Access_Timeslot parameter in EC SI 2 set to
'0' (indicating 1 TS EC-RACH mapping), an EC capable mobile with coverage
class CC5 using EC-RACH format as EDAB (refer 3GPP TS 44.018 EC SI 2 parameter
CC5_EC-RACH_FORMAT_IND) shall access the network using a training sequence
selected as follows:
\- if only CC3_Range_UL parameter is not present (indicating the absence of
CC3 coverage class), TS 6 is selected.
\- if only CC2_Range_UL parameter is not present (indicating the absence of
CC2 coverage class), TS 5 is selected.
\- if parameters CC2_Range_UL, CC3_Range_UL are not present (indicating the
absence of CC2 and CC3 coverage classes), TS 6 is selected.

## 5.3 Physical channels and bursts
The description of a physical channel will be made in terms of timeslots and
TDMA frames and not in terms of bursts. This is because there is not a one to
one mapping between a particular physical channel, and the use of a particular
burst.
## 5.4 Radio frequency channel sequence
The radio frequency channel sequence is determined by a function that, in a
given cell, with a given set of general parameters, (see subclause 5.6.2),
with a given timeslot number (TN), a given mobile radio frequency channel
allocation (MA) and a given mobile allocation index offset (MAIO), maps the
TDMA frame number (FN) to a radio frequency channel.
In a given cell there is therefore, for a physical channel assigned to a
particular mobile, a unique correspondence between radio frequency channel and
TDMA frame number.
The detailed hopping generation algorithm is given in subclause 6.2.
## 5.5 Timeslot and TDMA frame sequence
A given physical channel shall always use the same timeslot number in every
TDMA frame. Therefore a timeslot sequence is defined by:
i) a timeslot number (TN); and
ii) a TDMA frame number sequence.
The detailed definitions of TDMA frame number sequences are given in clause 7.
The physical channels where the TDMA frame number sequence is 0,1. . FN_MAX
(where FN_MAX is defined in subclause 4.3.3) are called \"basic physical
channels\".
## 5.6 Parameters for channel definition and assignment
### 5.6.1 General
This subclause describes the set of parameters necessary to describe fully the
mapping of any logical channel onto one or more physical channel(s). These
parameters may be divided into general parameters, that are characteristic of
a particular base transceiver station, and specific parameters, that are
characteristic of a given physical channel.
### 5.6.2 General parameters
#### 5.6.2.1 General
These are:
i) the set of radio frequency channels used in the cell (CA), together with
the identification of the BCCH carrier.
ii) the TDMA frame number (FN), which can be derived from the reduced TDMA
frame number (RFN) which is in the form T1, T2, T3\', see 3.3.2.
These parameters are broadcast (or derived from parameters broadcast) in the
BCCH and SCH.
An exception applies for COMPACT and EC-GSM-IoT, where the general parameters
are derived as described in subclause 5.6.2.2 and 5.6.2.3 respectively.
#### 5.6.2.2 COMPACT
For COMPACT, these are:
i) the set of radio frequency channels used in the cell (CA), together with
the identification of the COMPACT CPBCCH carrier (primary COMPACT carrier).
ii) the TDMA frame number (FN), which can be derived from the reduced TDMA
frame number (RFN) which is in the form R1 and R2, see 3.3.2.
iii) the time group number (TG)
These parameters are broadcast (or derived from parameters broadcast) in the
COMPACT CPBCCH and CSCH.
#### 5.6.2.3 EC-GSM-IoT
For EC-GSM-IoT, these are:
i) the set of radio frequency channels used in the cell (CA), together with
the identification of the BCCH carrier.
ii) the TDMA frame number (FN), which can be derived from the reduced TDMA
frame number per quarter hyperframe (RFN~QH~) which in turn is derived from
T1\', T2\', T2\'\', T3, see 3.3.2.2.3, and the QUARTER_HYPERFRAME_INDICATOR
(see 3GPP TS 44.018).
These parameters are:
\- broadcast in the EC-BCCH (CA parameter),
\- derived in FCCH acquisition (T3 parameter)
\- derived from EC-SCH (T1\', T2\', T2\'\' parameters), and,
\- included within assignment messages sent on the EC-AGCH
(QUARTER_HYPERFRAME_INDICATOR parameter).
### 5.6.3 Specific parameters
These parameters define a particular physical channel in a base transceiver
station. They are:
o) the training sequence Code (TSC);
i) the timeslot number (TN);
ii) the mobile radio frequency channel allocation (MA);
iii) the mobile allocation index offset (MAIO);
iv) the hopping sequence number (HSN);
v) the type of logical channel;
vi) the sub‑channel number (SCN).
The last two parameters allow the determination of the frame sequence.
# 6 Mapping of logical channels onto physical channels
## 6.1 General
The detailed mapping of logical channels onto physical channels is defined in
the following sections. Subclause 6.2 defines the mapping from TDMA frame
number (FN) to radio frequency channel (RFCH). Subclause 6.3 defines the
mapping of the physical channel onto TDMA frame number. Subclause 6.4 lists
the permitted channel combinations and subclause 6.5 defines the operation of
channels and channel combinations.
In case of _VAMOS subchannels_ , the mapping of the logical channels onto the
physical channels in uplink and downlink is done as defined for the
corresponding TCH channels in subclauses 6.2 and 6.3. In downlink if 2 _VAMOS
subchannels_ have bursts scheduled for transmission on a given timeslot in a
given TDMA frame and on a given ARFCN, then the bits from the 2 _VAMOS
subchannels_ are mapped on to AQPSK symbols (see subclause 5.2.3).
## 6.2 Mapping in frequency of logical channels onto physical channels
### 6.2.1 General
The parameters used in the function which maps TDMA frame number onto radio
frequency channel are defined in subclause 6.2.2. The definition of the actual
mapping function, or as it is termed, hopping sequence generation is given in
subclause 6.2.3.
In CTS, the specific mapping in frequency depends on the start condition
defined by the parameters given in subclause 6.2.2. The hopping sequence
generation for CTS is given in subclause 6.2.3.
### 6.2.2 Parameters
The following parameters are required in the mapping from TDMA frame number to
radio frequency channel for a given assigned channel.
General parameters of the BTS, specific to one BTS, and broadcast in the
(EC-)BCCH, (EC-)SCH and FCCH:
i) CA: Cell allocation of radio frequency channels.
ii) FN: TDMA frame number, derived from information,
Broadcast in the SCH, see subclause 3.3.2.2.1.
For COMPACT: Broadcast in the CSCH, see subclause 3.3.2.2.2.
For EC-GSM-IoT: Broadcast in the EC-SCH, derived from the timing of FCCH
bursts, and included within assignment message, see subclause 3.3.2.2.3.
Specific parameters of the channel, defined in the channel assignment message:
i) MA: Mobile allocation of radio frequency channels, defines the set of radio
frequency channels to be used in the mobiles hopping sequence. The MA contains
N radio frequency channels, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 64.
For COMPACT, the reduced MA (see 3GPP TS 44.060) shall be used for a fixed
amount of data blocks, see section 6.2.4.
For EC-GSM-IoT, the EC_MA_NUMBER (see 3GPP TS 44.060) is included in the
channel assignment message. The EC_MA_NUMBER is defined in EC SI where the MA
is included.
ii) MAIO: Mobile allocation index offset.(0 to N‑1, 6 bits).
For COMPACT, MAIO_2 shall be used for the data blocks using the reduced MA.
For EC-GSM-IoT, the EC_MA_NUMBER (see 3GPP TS 44.060) is included in the
channel assignment message. The EC_MA_NUMBER is defined in EC SI where the
MAIO is included.
iii) HSN: Hopping sequence (generator) number (0 to 63, 6 bits).
For EC-GSM-IoT, the EC_MA_NUMBER (see 3GPP TS 44.060) is included in the
channel assignment message. The EC_MA_NUMBER is defined in EC SI where the HSN
is included.
In CTS, the following parameters are required in the mapping to radio
frequency channel for a CTS-FP and CTS-MS pair. They are given by the CTS-FP
to the CTS-MS during the non-hopping access procedure :
i) VA: the vector _[a]{.underline}_ defines the elements which are used from
the shift register to generate the codeword. The vector _[a]{.underline}_
shall be randomly chosen upon up to 16 non-repeating integer elements where 0
≤ a~i~ \ T\' = T3 modulo (2 \^ NBIN)
**if** M\' \ S = M\'
**else** :
> S = (M\'+T\') modulo N
MAI, integer (0 .. N‑1) : MAI = (S + MAIO) modulo N
NOTE: Due to the procedure used by the mobile for measurement reporting when
DTX is used, the use of cyclic hopping where (N)mod 13 = 0 should be avoided.
where:
T1R: time parameter T1, reduced modulo 64 (6 bits)
T3: time parameter, from 0 to 50 (6 bits)
T2: time parameter, from 0 to 25 (5 bits)

The hopping sequence generation algorithm is represented diagrammatically in
figure 6.
This algorithm applies also to COMPACT and EC-GSM-IoT, whereby the parameters
T1, T2 and T3 shall be calculated from FN.
In CTS, the general structure of the hopping sequence generation algorithm is
shown in figure 6a, with the example of vector _[a]{.underline}_ = (a~0~,
a~1~, a~2~, a~3~) = (5, 8, 2, 11) and NF = 9. It consists of a 16 bit linear
feedback shift register and two counters. The shift register in the CTS-FP
shall be initialized with a random number which shall not be zero. The counter
TFHC1 counts modulo NF the number of TDMA frames. The overflow of this counter
causes a shift in the shift register. The counter TFHC2 counts modulo NF the
number of shifts.
The elements which are used from the shift register to generate the codeword
are defined by the vector _[a]{.underline}_. The codeword is built using a
modulo 2 addition of these elements and the elements of vector
_[v]{.underline}_ . Before mapping the codeword into a sequence, the value of
the counter TFHC2 is added modulo NF. The mapping is done by a modulo NF
addition to the base sequence _[c]{.underline}_. This results in a sequence
containing NF elements, each element representing one frequency index in the
TFH list. The value of counter TFHC1 points to the current frequency index to
use.
### 6.2.4 Specific cases
On the RFCH carrying a BCCH (C0), frequency hopping is not permitted on any
timeslot supporting a BCCH according to table 3 of clause 7. A non‑hopping
radio frequency channel sequence is characterized by a mobile allocation
consisting of only one radio frequency channel, i.e. with N=1, MAIO=0. In this
instance sequence generation is unaffected by the value of the value HSN.
For COMPACT, frequency hopping is not permitted on CPBCCH or CPCCCH for a
specific amount of N_CCCH_NH blocks according to the ordered list described in
subclause 6.3.2.1. If CPCCCH is defined as frequency hopping, those blocks use
MAI = MAIO.
For COMPACT, on other frequency hopping channels, the reduced MA and MAIO_2
shall be used for a specific amount of N_CCCH_NH blocks according to the
ordered list described in subclause 6.3.2.1.
For COMPACT, in case the optional information elements reduced MA and MAIO_2
are not present in the assignment message and the MA and MAIO information
elements are present in the assignment message, then the MS shall hop in all
allocated time slots according to the MA and MAIO.
### 6.2.5 Change in the frequency allocation of a base transceiver station
The consequence of adding or removing a number of radio frequency channels in
a base transceiver station is a modification of the cell allocation (CA) and
the mobile allocation (MA). In order to achieve this without disruption to
mobile stations with currently assigned channels it is necessary to send a
message to all mobiles with assigned channels. The message, as defined in 3GPP
TS 44.018, will contain a new cell allocation (if necessary), mobile
allocation and a time (in the form of a TDMA frame number) at which the change
is to occur. A new cell allocation may not be necessary if channels are only
being removed, and not added.
### 6.2.6 Frequency assignment in CTS
The CTSBCH (CTSBCH-FB and CTSBCH-SB) shall always be mapped on the CTSBCH RF
channel (designated as C0 in table 8 of clause 7).
The CTSPCH, CTSARCH and CTSAGCH shall be mapped on the predefined set of
carriers called TFH carrier list (designated by C0... Cn in Clause 7 Table 8)
by the CTS frequency hopping algorithm specified in subclauses 6.2.2 and
6.2.3. However, the CTSARCH and CTSAGCH shall be mapped on the CTSBCH RF
channel for the specific case of the non-hopping access procedure specified in
3GPP TS 44.056; the block TDMA frame mapping for these exceptions is specified
in clause 7 table 8. The methods for the determination of the CTSBCH RF
channel and the TFH carrier list are defined in 3GPP TS 45.056.
The TCH, FACCH and SACCH used for a CTS dedicated connection shall always be
mapped on the TFH carrier list (C0..Cn) by the CTS frequency hopping
algorithm. However, one exception is specified in the case of the CTS
enrolment and attachment of a CTS-MS (see 3GPP TS 44.056), where a non-hopping
access procedure is used; in these particular cases, the dedicated connection
shall be used in non-hopping mode and the TCH, FACCH and SACCH shall be mapped
on the CTSBCH RF channel (C0).
### 6.2.7 Mapping restrictions in downlink multi-carrier configurations
In DLMC configurations, restrictions of the mapping in frequency of logical
channels onto physical channels may apply. The restrictions apply on a radio
block basis to the carriers that are not selected. In case one or more of the
assigned carriers belong to a group of selected carriers in a certain radio
block period, the mobile shall monitor the assigned PDCHs on these carriers.
Which carriers that are selected is determined in each radio block period.
I.e. all carriers where PDCHs are assigned during the radio block period are
included in the carrier selection method. The carrier selection method is thus
independent on the number of PDCHs assigned to any given carrier.
Whether or not any restrictions apply is dependent on the maximum DLMC carrier
frequency spacing supported by the mobile station (see 3GPP TS 45.005) and the
ARFCNs used by the assigned carriers during a given radio block period.
The method that determines which carriers belong to the group of selected
carriers is defined below. All carriers with assigned numbers (see 3GPP TS
44.060) in the returned interval, selected_min to selected_max, belong to the
group of selected carriers in the applicable radio block period.
In case carriers are assigned in two frequency bands, the method applies
separately to each frequency band.
In case of non-contiguous intra-band reception, the method shall be first
called with _2 * max_sep_ as the last argument to check if all carriers can be
received. If this is the case, nothing more needs to be done. Otherwise the
method shall be called twice with _max_sep_ as the last argument, excluding
the carriers selected by the first call (by different _arfcn_ and
_num_carriers_ parameters) in the second call.
The method is exemplified in Annex F.
CARRIER_SELECTION (arfcn, num_tdma_frames, num_carriers, max_sep)
selected_min = selected_max = anchor = 1
while anchor \ max_sep
i = num_tdma_frames + 1
break
if i == num_tdma_frames
for j = 1 to num_tdma_frames
min_arfcn[j] = min(min_arfcn[j], arfcn[j][candidate])
max_arfcn[j] = max(max_arfcn[j], arfcn[j][candidate])
current_max = current_max + 1
else
break
if current_max - current_min > selected_max - selected_min
selected_min = current_min
selected_max = current_max
anchor = candidate
return (selected_min, selected_max)
where:
\- arfcn[1..num_tdma_frames][1..num_carriers]: Two-dimensional vector
containing the ARFCNs for all carriers subject to selection in each TDMA
frame. The carriers are ordered according to the assigned carrier number (see
3GPP TS 44.060) with the lowest numbered carrier in
arfcn[1..num_tdma_frames][1], and the highest numbered carrier in
arfcn[1..num_tdma_frames][num_carriers].
\- num_tdma_frames: Number of TDMA frames per radio block period, 4 in case of
BTTI mode, 2 in case of RTTI mode.
\- num_carriers: Number of carriers where PDCHs are assigned in a DLMC
configuration.
\- max_sep: Maximum DLMC carrier frequency spacing supported by the MS (see
3GPP TS 45.005).
## 6.3 Mapping in time of logical channels onto physical channels
### 6.3.1 Mapping in time of circuit switched logical channels onto physical
channels
#### 6.3.1.1 General
The mapping in time of circuit switched logical channels is defined in the
tables of clause 7, which also defines the relationship of the air interface
frames to the multiframe.
If assigned to a mobile station indicating support for VAMOS (see 3GPP TS
24.008), the traffic channel and its associated control channels shall be
mapped as described in the table below:
Table 6.3-1. Mapping of traffic and associated control channels onto TDMA
frames for VAMOS mobiles.
* * *
VAMOS mobile\ Assigned TSC set Mapping of traffic and associated control
channels on to TDMA frames support level
VAMOS I TSC set 1, 2, 3 or 4 Table 1 in clause 7
VAMOS II/III TSC set 1 or 3 Table 1 in clause 7
VAMOS II/III TSC set 2 or 4 Table 1a in clause 7
NOTE: The use of TSC set 3 and TSC set 4 is only applicable for mobile
stations indicating support for Extended TSC sets, see 3GPP TS 24.008.
* * *
#### 6.3.1.2 Key to the mapping table of clause 7
The following relates to the tables of clause 7. The columns headed:
i) \"Channel designation\" gives the precise acronym for the channel to which
the mapping applies.
ii) \"Sub‑channel number\" identifies the particular sub‑channel being defined
where a basic physical channel supports more than one channel of this type.
iii) \"Direction\" defines whether the mapping given applies identically to
downlink and uplink (D&U), or to downlink (D) or uplink (U) only.
iv) \"Allowable timeslots assignments\" defines whether the channel can be
supported on, or assigned to, any of the timeslots, or only on specific
timeslots.
v) \"Allowable RF channel assignments\" defines whether the channel can use
any or all of the radio frequency channels in the cell allocation (CA), or
only the BCCH carrier (C0). It should be noted that any allocated channel Cx
within CA could be any radio frequency channel, and that no ordering of radio
frequency channel number is implied. For example, allocated channel C0 need
not have the lowest radio frequency channel number of the allocation.
vi) \"Burst type\" defines which type of burst as defined in clause 5.2 is to
be used for the physical channel.
vii) \"Repeat length in TDMA frames\" defines how many TDMA frames occur
before the mapping for the interleaved blocks repeats itself e.g. 51.
viii) \"Interleaved block TDMA frame mapping\" defines, within the
parentheses, the TDMA frames used by each interleaved block (e.g. 0..3). The
numbers given equate to the TDMA frame number (FN) modulo the number of TDMA
frames per repeat length; Therefore, the frame is utilized when:
TDMA frame mapping number = (FN)mod repeat length given
Where there is more than one block shown, each block is given a separate
designation e.g. B0, B1. Where diagonal interleaving is employed then all of
the TDMA frames included in the block are given, and hence the same TDMA frame
number can appear more than once (see 3GPP TS 45.003). Also, for E-TCH/F28.8,
E-TCH/F32.0 and E-TCH/F43.2, the same frame number appears for the inband
signalling message and for several interleaved blocks. It should be noted that
the frame mapping for the SACCH/T channel differs according to the timeslot
assigned in order to lower the peak processing requirements of the BSS.
#### 6.3.1.3 Mapping of BCCH data
In order to facilitate the MS operation, it is necessary to transmit some
System Information messages in defined multiframes and defined blocks within
one multiframe, as follows (where TC = (FN DIV 51) mod (8)). Also for some
System Information messages, the position where they are transmitted is
contained in other System Information messages:
Table 6.3-2.System Information messages in defined multiframes and defined
blocks within one multiframe.
+----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | System Information Message | Sent when TC = | Allocation | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 1 | 0 | BCCH Norm | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 2 | 1 | BCCH Norm | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 2 bis | 5 | BCCH Norm | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 2 ter | 5 or 4 | BCCH Norm | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 2 quater | 5 or 4\ | BCCH Norm\ | | | or | \ | | | | BCCH Ext | | | 5 | | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 2n | 4 | BCCH Norm | | | | | | | or | BCCH Ext | | | | | | | 4 | | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 3 | 2 and 6 | BCCH Norm | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 4 | 3 and 7 | BCCH Norm | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 7 | 7 | BCCH Ext | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 8 | 3 | BCCH Ext | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 9 | 4 | BCCH Norm | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 13 | 4 | BCCH norm | | | | | | | or | BCCH Ext | | | | | | | 0 | | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 13 alt | 4 | BCCH norm | | | | | | | or | BCCH Ext | | | | | | | 0 | | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 15 | 4 | BCCH Norm | | | | | | | or | BCCH Ext | | | | | | | 1 | | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 16 | 6 | BCCH Ext | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 17 | 2 | BCCH Ext | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 18 | Not fixed | Not fixed | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 19 | Not Fixed | Not Fixed | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 20 | Not fixed | Not fixed | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 21 | 4 | BCCH Norm | | | | | | | or | BCCH Ext | | | | | | | 4 | | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 22 | 2 and 6 | BCCH Ext | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+ | Type 23 | 1 or 5 | BCCH Ext | +----------------------------+----------------+------------+
This subclause defines requirements on minimum scheduling: the network may
send any System Information message when sending of a specific System
Information message is not required. The following rules apply:
> i) BCCH Ext may share the resource with PCH and AGCH (see subclause 6.5.1).
>
> ii) System Information Type 1 needs to be sent if frequency hopping is in

All the allowable timeslot assignments in a frame (see table 3 of clause 7)
shall contain the same information.
#### 6.3.1.4 Mapping of SID Frames
When the DTX mode of operation is active, it is required to transmit Silence
Descriptor (SID) information, or equivalent dummy information, during the
SACCH/T block period (104 TDMA frames). As the SID frames do not constitute a
logical channel and their use is specific to DTX operation, the mapping of SID
frames onto the TDMA frames is specified in 3GPP TS 45.008.
### 6.3.2 Mapping in time of packet logical channels onto physical channels
#### 6.3.2.1 General
A physical channel allocated to carry packet logical channels is called a
packet data channel (PDCH). A PDCH shall carry packet logical channels only.
In RTTI configuration, physical channels are paired, forming PDCH-pairs. The
two physical channels shall have the same parameters (see subclause 5.6.3)
except for the timeslot number (TN). The two PDCHs constituting a PDCH-pair
shall be located on the same carrier. The two PDCHs constituting a PDCH-pair
need not be contiguous. In each direction, physical channels shall be assigned
so that PDCH-pairs do not partially overlap.
On a given PDCH, PDTCHs in both BTTI configuration and RTTI configuration
(assigned to different MSs) may be carried. Alternatively, both PDCHs forming
a PDCH-pair may be assigned to only carry PDTCHs in RTTI configuration.
Packet switched logical channels are mapped dynamically onto a 52-multiframe.
\- For a PDCH/F in BTTI configuration the 52-multiframe consists of 12 blocks
of 4 consecutive frames, 2 idle frames and 2 frames used for the PTCCH (see
3GPP TS 45.010), as shown in Figure 9. Table 6 in clause 7, indicates the
frame numbers for each of the blocks (B0...B11) transmitted in the multiframe.
The ordered list of block is defined as B0, B6, B3, B9, B1, B7, B4, B10, B2,
B8, B5, B11.
\- For PDCH/H, the 52-multiframe consists of 6 blocks of 4 frames each, and
two idle frames. Table 6 in clause 7 indicates the frame numbers for each of
the blocks (B0...B5) transmitted in the multiframe.
\- For a PDCH-pair in RTTI configuration the 52-multiframe consists of 24 RTTI
blocks of 2 consecutive frames, plus 2 idle frames and 2 frames used for the
PTCCH (see 3GPP TS 45.010) on each PDCH of the PDCH-pair, as shown in Figure
9a. Table 6 in clause 7 indicates the frame numbers for each of the 24 RTTI
blocks (B0~a~, B0~b~, ...B11~a~, B11~b~) transmitted in the 52-multiframe.
\- For a PDCH/F, when in EC operation, the 52-multiframe consists of 12 BTTI
blocks of 4 consecutive frames, and 4 idle frames, as shown in Figure 9b. In
case blind physical layer transmissions are used, multiple BTTI blocks
constitute the block that is mapped onto the physical channel, see Figure 9b.
For an uplink EC TBF assigned two PDCHs, compact burst mapping shall be used
(see 3GPP TS 45.001). In this case, the block that is mapped onto the physical
channel is not an aggregate of BTTI blocks constructed using bursts from 4
consecutive TDMA frames. Table 6a in clause 7 indicates the frame numbers of
each of the blocks depending on the downlink Coverage Class or uplink Coverage
Class respectively.
\- Depending on the intended coverage range, EC-PDTCH/F and EC-PACCH/F are
defined for different Coverage Classes (CCs), see 3GPP TS 43.064. Depending on
the CC and the number of PDCHs assigned for EC operation (see 3GPP 44.018 and
3GPP 44.060) one EC-PDTCH/F and/or EC-PACCH/F are mapped onto different number
of PDCHs according to:
\- CC1: 1 PDCH
\- CC2, CC3, CC4: 4 PDCHs or 2 PDCHs
The PDCHs that an EC-PDTCH/F and/or EC-PACCH/F are mapped to are contiguous,
see Table 6a in clause 7.
A block allocated to a given logical channel comprises one radio block, or in
the case of uplink only, 4 random access bursts. The type of channel may vary
on a block-by-block basis. In case of EC operation a block allocated to an EC-
channel can consist of blind physical layer transmissions of a radio block.
The number of blind physical layer transmissions is dependent on the assigned
Coverage Class.
In the downlink direction, the logical channel type shall be indicated by the
message type contained in the block header part for GPRS, or indicated by
Stealing Flags for EGPRS and EGPRS2, or detected by the MS in case of EC
operation.
In the uplink part for channels other than (EC-)PACCH transmitted as access
bursts or PRACH, or CPRACH or (EC-)RACH, the logical channel type shall be
indicated by the message type contained in the block header part for GPRS, or
indicated by Stealing Flags for EGPRS and EGPRS2, or known by the BTS in case
of EC operation. For (EC-)PACCH transmitted as access bursts, the logical
channel type is indicated by the corresponding polling message on the downlink
(see 3GPP TS 44.060). For the PRACH or CPRACH case the logical channel type is
indicated by the USF (see 3GPP TS 44.060), set on the downlink on a block by
block basis.
For COMPACT, timeslot mapping and rotation of the control channels is used
such that control channels belonging to a serving time group are rotated over
odd timeslot numbers as follows: 7, 5, 3, 1, 7, 5 ... . The rotation occurs
between frame numbers (FN) mod 52 = 3 and 4. The mapping of the control
channels on timeslot numbers is defined by the following formula:
\- for 0 ≤ FN mod 52 ≤ 3, TN = ((6 x ((FN div 52) mod 4)) + 1 + (2 x TG)) mod
8;
\- for 4 ≤ FN mod 52 ≤ 51, TN = ((6 x ((FN div 52) mod 4)) + 7 + (2 x TG)) mod
8.
Packet switched logical channels PDTCH, PACCH, and PTCCH are never rotated.
#### 6.3.2.2 Mapping of the uplink channels
##### 6.3.2.2.1 Mapping of (EC-)PDTCH/U and (EC-)PACCH/U
###### 6.3.2.2.1.1 BTTI configuration
The PDCH\'s where the MS may expect occurrence of its (EC-)PDTCH/U(s) or
(EC-)PACCH/U for a mobile originated transfer is indicated in resource
assignment messages (see 3GPP TS 44.060 and 3GPP 44.018). (EC-)PACCH/U shall
be allocated respecting the resources assigned to the MS and the MS multislot
class. For each PDCH assigned to the MS, an Uplink State Flag (R0... R7) is
given to the MS. An exception is when using Fixed Uplink Allocation where the
Uplink State Flag is not used to allocate resources, and hence no Uplink State
Flag is given to the MS.
In case of USF based allocation, the occurrence of the PDTCH/U and/or the
PACCH/U at given block(s) Bx (where Bx = B0...Bn; n=5 for the PDTCH/HU and
n=11 for the PDTCH/FU) in the 52-multiframe structure for a given MS on a
given PDCH shall be indicated by the value of the Uplink State Flag (USF)
contained in the header of the preceding block transmitted in the downlink of
the same PDCH (or in the case of shifted USF on the downlink of a PDCH with a
relationship to the uplink PDCH as defined in 3GPP TS 44.060), that is to say
B(x-1) in the same multiframe if x≥1 or B(n) in the previous multiframe if
x=0. If the USF in block B(x‑1) indicates that block B(x) shall be used by an
MS for which the USF_GRANULARITY is set to 1 (corresponding to 4 blocks) in
the last assignment message, that MS shall also use the three following
blocks. The USF corresponding to the last three blocks shall be set to an
unused value. The MS may transmit a PDTCH block or a PACCH block on any of the
uplink blocks used by the MS. The occurrence of the PACCH/U associated to a
PDTCH/D shall be indicated by the network by polling the MS (see 3GPP TS
44.060).
In case of Fixed Uplink Allocation, the occurrence of the EC‑PDTCH/U at given
block(s) in the 52-multiframe structure for a given MS on given PDCH(s) shall
be indicated by an EC Immediate Assignment Type 1, EC-Immediate Assignment
Type 2, EC Packet Uplink Ack/Nack or EC Packet Uplink Assignment message. The
number of blocks available per 52-multiframe depends on the uplink Coverage
Class and the number of PDCHs assigned for EC operation as shown in table
6.3-2. The mapping of each block onto the 52-multiframe is shown in table 6a,
and illustrated in figure 9b, figure 9c, figure 9d and figure 9e.
Table 6.3-3: Blocks per 52-multiframe depending on uplink Coverage Class for
EC-GSM-IoT

The occurrence of the EC-PACCH/U associated with EC-PDTCH/D shall be indicated
by the network by polling the MS (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
NOTE 1: This subclause specifies how the network shall signal that the MS is
allowed to use the uplink. The operation of the MS is specified in 3GPP TS
44.060. In particular cases of extended dynamic allocation or exclusive
allocation, the MS may not need to monitor the USF on all the downlink
timeslots corresponding to the assigned uplink PDCHs. In case of Fixed Uplink
Allocation the MS shall not monitor the USF.
NOTE 2: The PDCH/HU is only assigned in exclusive allocation (see 3GPP TS
44.060).
NOTE 3: A MS using packet uplink traffic channels mapped to the same physical
channel than an uplink PCCCH in extended dynamic allocation MAC mode is not
required to check if allocated uplink PDTCH/U or PACCH/U blocks also belong to
the PRACH.
In a dual carrier or a DLMC configuration, the uplink block(s) shall be
allocated on the corresponding physical channel on which the USF or poll (see
3GPP TS 44.060) is received. Uplink blocks shall not be allocated on physical
channels having different frequency domain descriptions (see subclause 5.4)
simultaneously in the same block period.
For COMPACT, USF_GRANULARITY should be set to 0 (corresponding to 1 block) for
dynamic allocation for the following cases:
i) for odd timeslot numbers (TN) 1, 3, 5, and 7 in nominal and large cells;
ii) for even timeslot numbers (TN) 0, 2, 4, and 6 in large cells.
###### 6.3.2.2.1.2 RTTI configuration
The PDCH-pairs where the MS may expect occurrence of its PDTCH/U(s) or PACCH/U
for a mobile originated transfer are indicated in resource assignment messages
(see 3GPP TS 44.060). PACCH/U shall be allocated respecting the resources
assigned to the MS and the MS multislot class.
For each PDCH-pair assigned to the MS, one or two USFs (R0... R7) are given to
the MS. For each assigned uplink PDCH-pair the network may signal in resource
assignment messages a "corresponding downlink PDCH-pair" where the USF is
monitored. The timeslot numbers of the PDCHs constituting the corresponding
downlink PDCH-pair may be different from those of the PDCHs constituting the
uplink PDCH-pair. If no indication is provided, the corresponding downlink
PDCH-pair shall be the one with the same timeslot numbers as the uplink PDCH-
pair.
For an assigned uplink PDCH-pair, for the transmission of the USF the network
can use one of two modes:
\- BTTI USF mode: USFs are sent in a basic radio block period, i.e. a USF is
mapped on four bursts transmitted on one of the PDCHs of a downlink PDCH-pair
during four consecutive TDMA frames;
\- RTTI USF mode: a USF is sent in a reduced radio block period, i.e. a USF is
mapped on four bursts transmitted on both PDCHs of a downlink PDCH-pair during
two consecutive TDMA frames.
The network shall signal the USF mode in the resource assignment messages (see
3GPP TS 44.060). The USF mode shall be the same for all the uplink PDCH-pairs
assigned to one mobile station. Also, on a given downlink PDCH-pair, all USFs
shall be sent with the same USF mode.
If the BTTI USF mode is used, for each PDCH-pair assigned to the MS the
network shall give two USFs (R0... R7) to the MS, one for each PDCH of the
corresponding downlink PDCH-pair. If the RTTI USF mode is used, for each PDCH-
pair assigned the network shall give to the MS one Uplink State Flag (R0...
R7) to the MS.
When a given downlink PDCH is configured to provide USFs for PDTCHs operating
in RTTI configuration (as part of a corresponding downlink PDCH-pair) and
PDTCHs operating in BTTI configuration, the BTTI USF mode shall be used on
both PDCHs of the corresponding downlink PDCH-pair to schedule uplink blocks
for mobile stations using RTTI configuration. Additionally, if any of the
downlink PDTCHs mapped onto either PDCH of a corresponding PDCH-pair operates
in BTTI configuration, the BTTI USF mode shall be used on both PDCHs. In this
case, if x≥1, the first uplink RTTI radio block Bx~a~ shall be allocated by
the USF contained in block B(x-1) of the downlink PDCH having the lowest TN
and the second uplink RTTI radio block Bx~b~ shall be allocated by the USF
contained in block B(x-1) of the highest numbered PDCH TN of the
"corresponding downlink PDCH-pair" to the uplink PDCH-pair (see Figure 9a and
3GPP TS 44.060). If x=0 the corresponding USFs will be carried within block
B11 of the previous 52-multiframe. In case of dual carrier or a DLMC
configuration in the downlink, this same relationship between USFs and uplink
RTTI radio blocks shall apply. If the USF_GRANULARITY is set to 1
(corresponding to 4 blocks) in the last assignment message, the MS shall also
use the next three consecutive RTTI radio blocks of sub-index a or sub-index b
(according to the PDCH in which the USF was received), see 3GPP TS 44.060. The
USF corresponding to the last three blocks shall be set to an unused value.
When on a downlink PDCH belonging to a PDCH-pair a USF is sent scheduling an
uplink block belonging to an MS in BTTI configuration, the USF on the other
PDCH of the "corresponding PDCH-pair" shall also schedule an uplink block
belonging to an MS in BTTI configuration.
When both PDCHs of a corresponding downlink PDCH-pair are configured to
provide USFs for uplink PDTCHs all operating in RTTI configuration, and when
all the downlink PDTCHs mapped onto both PDCHs operate in RTTI configuration,
the RTTI USF mode shall be used on both PDCHs. In this case, if x≥1, the
uplink RTTI radio block Bx~a~ shall be allocated by the USF contained in RTTI
block B(x-1)~b~ and uplink RTTI radio block Bx~b~ shall be allocated by the
USF contained in RTTI block Bx~a~ of the "corresponding downlink PDCH-pair" to
the uplink PDCH-pair (see Figure 9a and 3GPP TS 44.060). If x=0 the USFs will
be carried within RTTI block B11~b~ of the previous 52-multiframe and B0~a~
respectively. If the USF_GRANULARITY is set to 1 (corresponding to 4 blocks)
in the last assignment message, the MS shall also use the next three
consecutive RTTI radio blocks, see 3GPP TS 44.060. The USF corresponding to
the last three blocks shall be set to an unused value.
The MS may transmit a PDTCH block or a PACCH block on any of the uplink blocks
allocated to the MS. The occurrence of the PACCH/U associated to a PDTCH/D
shall be indicated by the network by polling the MS (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
##### 6.3.2.2.2 Mapping of the Packet Timing Advance Control Channel (PTCCH/U)
The PDCH carrying the PTCCH/U of one MS is defined in the resource assignment
message (see 3GPP TS 44.060). PTCCH/U shall be mapped to one of the time slots
where PDTCH(s) are allocated to the MS. PTCCH/U shall be allocated respecting
the resources assigned to the MS and the MS multislot class. An MS shall be
allocated a sub-channel of the PTCCH/U (0...15) as defined in table 6 of
clause 7, where the sub-channel number is equal to the Timing Advance Index
(TAI) indicated in the resource allocation message (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
In a dual carrier or a DLMC configuration, an MS shall be assigned a PTCCH/U
sub-channel on a physical channel having one frequency domain description (see
subclause 5.4) only.
In RTTI configuration, an MS shall be assigned a PTCCH/U on only one of the
physical channels comprising an uplink PDCH-pair (see subclause 6.3.2.1).
##### 6.3.2.2.3 Mapping of the uplink PCCCH i.e. PRACH
The mapping of the PRACH is defined in table 6 of clause 7, where the possible
blocks are indicated. The PRACH is dynamically allocated in groups of four
PRACH blocks By (y=4x+i, i=0 ,.., 3) corresponding to one PDCH block Bx
(x=0,...,11), indicated by USF=FREE in the same way as defined for PDTCH/U
(see subclause 6.3.2.2.1).
Optionally, a subset of the blocks Bx can be allocated to PRACH in a fixed
way. The number of allocated blocks is indicated by the parameter
BS_PRACH_BLKS broadcast on the PBCCH, where BS_PRACH_BLKS=0...12. The blocks
are allocated according to the ordered list defined in subclause 6.3.2.1. The
blocks shall also be indicated by the USF=FREE. The MS may choose to use the
BS_PRACH_BLKS or USF to determine the fixed allocated part of PRACH.
##### 6.3.2.2.3a Mapping of the COMPACT uplink CPCCCH i.e. CPRACH
The CPRACH is dynamically or fixed allocated in the same way as defined for
PRACH (see subclause 6.3.2.2.3. USF should be set equal to FREE for downlink
block B0 on a serving time group when 4 time groups are assigned. Uplink
blocks (other than block B1 on a serving time group) that are preceded by
CPBCCH and CPCCCH blocks should be prioritized for use as CPRACH.
See Annex D for examples based on sixteen prioritized CPRACH blocks.
##### 6.3.2.2.4 Mapping of the MBMS uplink MPRACH
The mapping of the MPRACH is defined in table 6 of clause 7, where the
possible blocks are indicated. The MPRACH is dynamically allocated in groups
of four MPRACH blocks By (y=4x+i, i=0 ,.., 3) corresponding to one PDCH block
Bx (x=0,...,11), indicated by a value of the USF, in the same way as defined
for PDTCH/U (see subclause 6.3.2.2.1). The value of the USF is signalled in
the MBMS notification message (see 3GPP TS 44.060).
##### 6.3.2.2.5 Void
##### 6.3.2.2.6 Mapping of Overlaid CDMA sub channels
In case overlaid CDMA is used on dedicated channels (EC-PDTCH and EC-PACCH),
see 3GPP TS 43.064 [6], up to four MS can be multiplexed on the same physical
resource, simultaneously transmitting, using different orthogonal codes
assigned by the network if four PDCHs are assigned for EC operation, see 3GPP
44.018 [10] and 3GPP TS 44.060 [11]. Else if two PDCHs are assigned for EC
operation, two MS can be multiplexed on the same physical resource. The codes
are applied per burst over the assigned PDCHs for EC-PDTCH and EC-PACCH in
each TDMA frame from the lowest to the highest numbered assigned TN, according
to Table 6.3-3, and are only applied in case blind physical layer
transmissions are used (i.e. for CC2, CC3 and CC4). The code value is either 0
or 1. In case 0 is used, the burst is transmitted as if no code was applied.
In case 1 is used, the whole burst is shifted in phase by π radians, see 3GPP
TS 45.004 [14]. Since the code is applied over the blind physical layer
transmissions within the TDMA frame, and CC2, CC3, CC4 all map to four or two
PDCHs in a TDMA frame, there is no restriction on the pairing of MS on the
same physical resources, of different Coverage Classes, as long as blind
physical layer transmissions are used (CC2, CC3 and CC4) and the same number
of PDCHs (i.e. four or two) are assigned for these MS assigned on those
resources. Overlaid CDMA is only applied for transmissions on the uplink, i.e.
for EC-PACCH/U and EC-PDTCH/U.
Overlaid CDMA is also specified for EC-RACH in CC5 using EDAB in the 2 TS EC-
RACH format with TS7, see sub-clause 5.2.11. The first burst (burst with equal
size to the active part of the normal burst) and the second burst (burst with
equal size to the active part of the access burst) are transmitted using the
code sequence \'01\' according to Table 6.3-3.
NOTE: This enables the network to segregate transmissions in CC4, using the 2
TS EC-RACH format without phase shift, from transmissions in CC5, since both
transmissions use the same synchronization sequence TS7, see sub-clause 5.2.7.
Table 6.3-4. Overlaid CDMA codes

#### 6.3.2.3 Mapping of the downlink channels
##### 6.3.2.3.1 Mapping of the (EC-)PDTCH/D and (EC-)PACCH/D
The PDCH(s) in BTTI configuration or the PDCH-pair(s) in RTTI configuration
where the MS may expect occurrence of its (EC-)PDTCH/D(s) for a mobile
terminated transfer or its (EC-)PACCH/D, for both mobile originated and mobile
terminated transfer, are indicated in resource assignment messages (see 3GPP
TS 44.060). (EC-)PDTCH/D and (EC‑)PACCH/D can be mapped dynamically on all
blocks except those used for PBCCH (see subclause 6.3.2.3.3). The logical
channel type shall be indicated in the block header for GPRS, it shall be
indicated by Stealing Flags for EGPRS and EGPRS2, and it shall be detected by
the MS in case of EC operation. The mobile owner of the (EC‑)PDTCH/D or
(EC‑)PACCH/D shall be indicated by the TFI (Temporary Flow Identity) (see 3GPP
TS 44.060).
For EC-PDTCH/D and EC-PACCH/D the number of blocks available per 52-multiframe
depends on the downlink Coverage Class and the number of PDCHs assigned for EC
operation, and is the same as for uplink shown in table 6.3-3.
If PDTCH/D is mapped on blocks, which may be used for PCCCH and where paging
may appear, the network shall only use coding schemes CS-1 to CS-4.
NOTE: This restriction is needed to avoid the expiry of the downlink
signalling counter (DSC) for non-EGPRS capable mobile stations in case the
network uses MCS-1 to MCS-9. CS-1 should be favoured, as it provides the
strongest error protection.
##### 6.3.2.3.2 Mapping of the PTCCH/D
The PTCCH/D is mapped as defined in table 6 of clause 7. The PTCCH/D carries
signalling messages including timing advance information for MSs sharing the
PTCCH/U on the same PDCH.
In a dual carrier or a DLMC configuration, an MS shall be assigned a PTCCH/D
channel on a physical channel having one frequency domain description (see
subclause 5.4) only.
In RTTI configuration, an MS shall be assigned a PTCCH/D on only one of the
physical channels comprising a downlink PDCH-pair (see subclause 6.3.2.1).
When only an uplink PDTCH is assigned to the MS, the PTCCH shall be assigned
on one of the PDCHs comprising the "corresponding downlink PDCH-pair" for the
uplink PDTCH (see subclause 6.3.2.2.1.2).
##### 6.3.2.3.3 Mapping of the PBCCH
The PBCCH is mapped onto one PDCH only, indicated in the BCCH. The PBCCH is
mapped on BS_PBCCH_BLKS blocks (where 1≤BS_PBCCH_BLKS≤4) per multiframe,
according to the ordered list described in subclause 6.3.2.1. The blocks
allocated are specified in table 6 of clause 7. The parameter BS_PBCCH_BLKS is
broadcast on PBCCH in block B0 (see subclause 3.3.2.4).
##### 6.3.2.3.3a Mapping of the COMPACT CPBCCH
The CPBCCH is mapped onto a primary COMPACT carrier on the time group
indicated by TG on CSCH (see subclause 3.3.2.2). This time group is known as
the serving time group and rotates over odd timeslot numbers (see subclause
6.3.2.1). The CPBCCH is mapped on BS_PBCCH_BLKS blocks (where
1≤BS_PBCCH_BLKS≤4) per multiframe, according to the ordered list described in
subclause 6.3.2.1. The blocks allocated are specified in table 9 of clause 7.
The parameters BS_PBCCH_BLKS is broadcast on CPBCCH in block B0 (see subclause
3.3.2.4).
See Annex D for examples based on one CPBCCH block.
When USF=FREE in downlink block B0 on a serving time group, the CPRACH is
allocated in uplink block B1 after timeslot rotation. When USF has any other
value in downlink block B0 on a serving time group, the uplink allocation of
B1 is valid for the same timeslot, irrespective of timeslot rotation.
##### 6.3.2.3.3b Void
##### 6.3.2.3.4 Mapping of the PCCCH
The PCCCH and its different logical channels (PAGCH, PPCH) can be mapped
dynamically and are identified by the message header. The configuration is
partly fixed by some parameters broadcast by the PBCCH and defined in
subclause 3.3.2.4:
a) BS_PBCCH_BLKS, that defines the number of PBCCH blocks per multiframe,
according to the ordered list described in subclause 6.3.2.1, on the PDCH that
carries PBCCH;
b) BS_PAG_BLKS_RES, that defines the number of blocks in addition to
BS_PBCCH_BLKS, according to the ordered list described in subclause 6.3.2.1,
where PPCH shall not occur on every PDCH that carries PCCCH.
PCCCH (except PPCH) can be mapped on all blocks except those used for PBCCH.
If PBCCH is allocated on timeslot k, PCCCHs shall be allocated only on
timeslots n where n>k-4 and 0≤n≤7 in order to provide time for the MS to
switch from PBCCH to PCCCH.
##### 6.3.2.3.4a Mapping of the COMPACT CPCCCH
The CPCCCH and its different logical channels (CPAGCH, CPPCH) can be mapped
dynamically and are identified by the message header. The configuration is
partly fixed by some parameters broadcast by the CPBCCH and defined in
subclause 3.3.2.4:
> a) BS_PBCCH_BLKS, that defines the number of CPBCCH blocks per multiframe,
> according to the ordered list described in subclause 6.3.2.1, on the radio
> frequency channel that carries CPBCCH;
b) BS_PAG_BLKS_RES, that defines the number of blocks in addition to
BS_PBCCH_BLKS, where CPPCH shall not occur on every radio frequency channel
that carries CPCCCH. These blocks without CPPCH are allocated after CPPCH
blocks according to the ordered list described in subclause 6.3.2.1.
CPCCCH (except CPPCH) can be mapped on all blocks except those used for
CPBCCH.
For primary COMPACT carriers, CPCCCHs shall be allocated on the same time
group as CPBCCH. CPCCCHs on secondary COMPACT carrier(s) shall be allocated on
same time group as for primary COMPACT carrier.
See Annex D for examples based on three CPCCCH blocks.
##### 6.3.2.3.4b Void
#### 6.3.2.4 Mapping of PBCCH data
In order to facilitate the MS operation, the network is required to transmit
certain types of Packet System Information (PSI) messages in specific
multiframes and specific PBCCH blocks within the multiframes. The occurrence
of the PSI1 message is defined by TC = (FN DIV 52) mod PSI1_REPEAT_PERIOD,
where PSI1_REPEAT_PERIOD (range 1 - 16) is indicated in the SI13 message on
BCCH, the PSI 1 message on PBCCH and, if present, in the Neighbour Cell
parameters in PSI3 and PSI3bis messages sent on serving cell PBCCH.
The PSI1 message is transmitted at TC = 0 according to rule i) and ii) below.
The PSI messages other than the PSI1 message are divided into two groups of
PSI messages. One group of PSI messages is transmitted with a low repetition
rate and a second group is transmitted with a high repetition rate.
The number of PSI message instances sent with high repetition rate is
indicated by the parameter PSI_COUNT_HR (range 0 to 16) in the PSI1 message.
The PSI messages in this group are sent according to rule iii) below.
The number of PSI message instances sent with low repetition rate is indicated
by the parameter PSI_COUNT_LR (range 0 to 63) in the PSI1 message. The PSI
messages in this group are sent according to rule iv) below.
The following rules apply:
i) PSI1 shall be sent in block B0 when TC = 0;
ii) if the value of the parameter BS_PBCCH_BLKS is greater than 1, the PSI1
shall also be sent in block B6 when TC = 0;
iii) the PSI messages in the group sent with high repetition rate shall be
sent in a sequence determined by the network and starting at TC = 0, using the
PBCCH blocks within each multiframe, in the order of occurrence, which are not
occupied according to rule i) or ii). The sequence of these PSI messages shall
be repeated starting at each occurrence of TC = 0;
iv) the PSI messages in the group sent with low repetition rate shall be sent
in a sequence determined by the network and continuously repeated, using the
PBCCH blocks within each multiframe, in the order of occurrence, which are not
occupied according to rules i) to iii) . The sequence of these PSI messages
shall be restarting at FN = 0.
If there are multiple instances of a particular type of PSI message (see 3GPP
TS 44.060), they shall all be sent within same group of PSI messages according
to either rule iii) or iv) above. They shall be sent in a single sequence in
the ascending order of the message instance number of that type of PSI
message.
The same PSI message shall not occur twice within the lists defined by
PSI_COUNT_LR and PSI_COUNT_HR
A full set of Packet System Information messages contains one consistent set
of the messages included in PSI_COUNT_LR and one consistent set of the
messages included in PSI_COUNT_HR plus the PSI1 message.
NOTE: The parameters BS_PBCCH_BLKS and PSI1_REPEAT_PERIOD_shall be selected by
the network such that all PSI message present in the cell can be sent
according to rules i) to iv) above. It is the responsibility of the network to
optimise the broadcast of the PSI messages so that the MS can find the
important parameters for cell re-selection and access as fast as possible
without unnecessary power consumption. The PSI mapping scheme information can
be utilised by the MS to estimate the actual minimum cell reselection time.
#### 6.3.2.4a Mapping of COMPACT CPBCCH data
See subclause 6.3.2.4, with the exception that the CPBCCH is a stand-alone
packet control channel for COMPACT.
#### 6.3.2.4b Void
### 6.3.3 Mapping in time of CTS control channels onto physical channels
The mapping in time of CTS control channels is defined in table 8 of clause 7,
which also defines the relationship of the air interface TDMA frames to the
multiframe.
The timeslot assignment of the CTS control channel is defined hereafter.
#### 6.3.3.1 CTSBCH timeslot assignment
For the CTSBCH**,** a procedure of timeslot shifting from one 52-multiframe to
another is defined. The usage of this procedure is mandatory in CTS idle mode
and optional in CTS dedicated mode. When the shifting procedure is not
applied, the CTSBCH timeslot number shall be equal to the TNC broadcast in the
current 52-multiframe CTSBCH-SB.
The following parameters are required for the timeslot shifting procedure.
Parameters broadcast in the CTSBCH-SB:
a) TNI: initial timeslot number (0 to 7, 3 bits), defined by the three LSBs
(BN3, BN2, BN1) of the FPBI (specified in 3GPP TS 23.003);
b) TNSCN: timeslot number series couple number (0 to 31, 5 bits), defined by
the 5 bits (BN8, ..., BN4) of the FPBI. Defines the couple of timeslot number
circular series (TNS~TNSCN,0~, TNS~TNSCN,1~) to be used to form the timeslot
shifting sequence. See timeslot number series (TNS) definition in table below.

* * *
Parameters sent on a dedicated connection during the CTS-MS attachment:
a) TNSCO : TNS couple order (1 bit), defines together with TNSCN the ordered
couple (TNS1, TNS2).
if TNSCO = 0 then (TNS1, TNS2) = (TNS~TNSCN,0~, TNS~TNSCN,1~)
if TNSCO = 1 then (TNS1, TNS2) = (TNS~TNSCN,1~, TNS~TNSCN,0~)
b) parameters to be used to form the timeslot shifting sequence.
x0 : 0 to 7, 3 bits
x1 : 0 to 7, 3 bits
x2 : 0 to 7, 3 bits
x3 : 0 to 7, 3 bits
For a given set of parameters, a unique timeslot shifting sequence of length
of 8 x 51 52-multiframes is defined. The shifting sequence is repeated 128
times over the duration of a GSM hyperframe. It is divided into 8 sets of 51
52-multiframes. The structure of a set is explicitly shown on figure below :
Figure 1 (subclause 6.3.3): Structure of timeslot shifting sequence
A set is formed by interleaving segments of TNS1 and TNS2. The mapping of TNS1
and TNS2 segments onto a set is defined by the parameters x0, x1, x2, x3 as
follows :
for (FN div 52) mod 51 = 0 to 7 a TNS1 segment is used
for (FN div 52) mod 51 = 8 to 7+x3 a TNS2 segment is used
for (FN div 52) mod 51 = 8+x3 to 7+x3+x2 a TNS1 segment is used
for (FN div 52) mod 51 = 8+x3+x2 to 7+x3+x2+x1 a TNS2 segment is used
for (FN div 52) mod 51 = 8+x3+x2+x1 to 7+x3+x2+x1+x0 a TNS1 segment is used
for (FN div 52) mod 51 = 8+x3+x2+x1+x0 to 15+x3+x2+x1+x0 a TNS2 segment is
used
for (FN div 52) mod 51 = 16+x3+x2+x1+x0 to 23+x3+x2+x1 a TNS1 segment is used
for (FN div 52) mod 51 = 24+x3+x2+x1 to 31+x3+x2 a TNS2 segment is used
for (FN div 52) mod 51 = 32+x3+x2 to 39+x3 a TNS1 segment is used
for (FN div 52) mod 51 = 40+x3 to 47 a TNS2 segment is used
for (FN div 52) mod 51 = 48 to 50 a TNS1 segment is used
The TNS1 and TNS2 segments are extracted from TNS1 and TNS2 according to the
following rules :
a) The first CTSBCH TN used in a shifting sequence shall be the TNI.
b) Two consecutive CTSBCH TN shall be separated by single circular shifts
along TNS1 and TNS2.
c) When changing from a TNSi segment to a TNSj segment, the last timeslot
obtained from TNSi shall be followed by its immediate successor in TNSj.
NOTE: The first timeslot of a set is obtained by three circular shifts in TNS1
with regard to the first timeslot of the previous set.
An example of the mapping of TNS1 and TNS2 onto the first set of the generated
shifting sequence is given in annex C.
#### 6.3.3.2 CTSPCH, CTSARCH and CTSAGCH timeslot assignment
For the CTSPCH, CTSARCH and CTSAGCH, the timeslot shall be assigned by the
CTS-FP for each 52-multiframe. The timeslot number used for CTSPCH, CTSARCH
and CTSAGCH shall be the TNC broadcast in the previous 52‑multiframe CTSBCH-
SB.
### 6.3.4 Mapping in time of Extended Coverage control channels onto physical
channels
#### 6.3.4.1 General
The mapping in time of Extended Coverage control channels is defined in table
6a of clause 7, and is illustrated in figure 11 to figure 17. The table and
figures also define the relationship of the air interface TDMA frames to the
multiframe.
In addition to the information in table 6a and figures 11 to 18, further
information is provided for EC-CCCH in subclause 6.3.4.2 and 6.3.4.3, and for
the mapping of the EC-BCCH data in subclause 6.3.4.4.
#### 6.3.4.2 Mapping of the downlink Extended Coverage CCCH (EC-CCCH/D)
The EC-CCCH and its different logical channels (EC-AGCH, EC-PCH) can be mapped
dynamically and are identified by the message header. The mapping is as
defined in table 6a of clause 7 and is illustrated in figure 13, figure 14 and
figure 15.The EC-CCCH blocks constitute different number of blind physical
layer transmissions depending on the downlink Coverage Class used, see table
6a, and illustration in figure 13, figure 14 and figure 15. One, eight,
sixteen or thirty-two corresponding CC1 blocks are used for CC1, CC2, CC3 and
CC4 EC-CCCH blocks respectively. In case of CC2 and CC3, the bursts are mapped
over two 51-multiframes, and for CC4 over four 51-multiframes. For CC1 each
block is contained in a single 51-multiframe.
#### 6.3.4.3 Mapping of the uplink Extended Coverage CCCH (EC-CCCH/U)
The mapping of the EC-RACH (EC-CCCH/U) is defined in table 6a of clause 7 and
illustrated in figure 16 and figure 17, where the possible blocks are
indicated for each uplink Coverage Class (CC1 to CC5). Furthermore, two
different EC-RACH mappings exist. The mapping to be used is signalled on cell
level in EC SI, see 3GPP TS 44.018. The EC-RACH is either mapped onto a single
TS, or over 2 consecutive TS for CC2, CC3, CC4 and CC5. CC1 EC-RACH is always
mapped onto 1 TS.
The EC-RACH is fixed allocated in the full 51-multiframe. The EC-RACH blocks
constitute different number of EC-RACH bursts depending on the uplink Coverage
Class used, see table 6a and illustration in figure 16 and figure 17. One,
four, sixteen, fourty-eight bursts are used for CC1, CC2, CC3 and CC4 EC-RACH
blocks respectively. For ESAB sixty-six ESABs are used for the CC5 EC-RACH
block, for EDAB sixty-six EDABs are used for the CC5 EC-RACH block. In case of
CC5 the bursts are mapped over three 51-multiframes, for CC4 the bursts are
mapped over two 51-multiframes, and for Coverage Classes CC1 to CC3 each block
is contained in a single 51-multiframe.
#### 6.3.4.4 Mapping of EC-BCCH data
In order to facilitate the MS operation, the network is required to transmit
EC System Information (EC SI) messages on EC-BCCH blocks, each EC-BCCH block
mapped onto 8 consecutive TDMA frames in each of 8 consecutive 51‑multiframes,
see table 6a and figure 12. An EC SI message may consist of one or more
message instances (see 3GPP TS 44.018) where each EC SI message instance is
transmitted in one EC-BCCH block (one EC-BCCH block consisting of 16 blind
physical layer transmissions of an EC SI message instance as described in 3GPP
TS 45.003).
The following rules apply:
> i) An EC SI message instance is started in the 51-multiframe when TC = (FN
> DIV 51) mod 8 = 0,
>
> ii) The EC SI messages (see 3GPP TS 44.018) shall be sent in sequence in
> ascending order according to the EC SI message type (EC SI 1, EC SI 2, EC SI
> 3 and EC SI 4) without repeating any given EC SI message or EC SI message
> instance (except for blind physical layer transmissions within an EC-BCCH
> block) before all instances of all EC SI messages have been sent.
>
> iii) When there are multiple EC SI message instances of an EC SI message
> each EC SI message instance shall be sent in ascending order according to
> the value of the EC SI N_INDEX (N=1 to 4) included in each message instance
> (see 3GPP TS 44.018)
>
> iv) A full set of EC SI messages includes a single transmission of each EC
> SI message/message instance sent according to ii) and iii).
An example is provided below where it is assumed that EC SI message 1, 2, 3
and 4 are sent by the network, and where EC SI 3 contains two EC SI message
instances. In this case, the full set of EC SI messages would be transmitted
using the following sequence:
EC SI 1; EC SI 2; EC SI 3(EC SI 3_INDEX=0) ; EC SI3(EC SI 3_INDEX=1); EC SI 4

### 6.4.2 Multislot configurations
#### 6.4.2.1 General
A multislot configuration consists of multiple circuit or packet switched
traffic channels together with associated control channels, assigned to the
same MS or, in the case of point-to-multipoint transmission, a group of MSs.
As an exception if blind physical layer transmissions are used in EC
operation, a multislot configuration consists of a single EC-PDTCH and/or EC-
PACCH (the associated control channel) mapped onto multiple physical channels.
The multislot configuration occupies up to 8 basic physical channels, with
different timeslots numbers (TN) but with the same frequency parameters (ARFCN
or MA, MAIO and HSN) and the training sequence with the same training sequence
code (TSC) which may be selected from different TSC Sets in case of multislot
configurations for dual transfer mode in _A/Gb mode_ (see subclause 6.4.2.3).
For a mobile station supporting the extended TSC set, up to two training
sequences may be used on the same timeslot number with the same frequency
parameters for packet switched traffic channels. In this case the training
sequences are chosen from different TSC sets.
#### 6.4.2.1 Multislot configurations for circuit switched connections in
_A/Gb mode_
In _A/Gb mode_ , two types of multislot configurations exist, symmetric and
asymmetric. The symmetric case consists of only bi-directional channels. The
asymmetric case consists of both bi-directional and unidirectional downlink
channels.
The occupied physical channels shall consist of the following channel
combinations as defined in subclause 6.4.1.
one main channel of type viii) or xix) +
x secondary channels of type ix) or xx) +
y secondary channels of type x) or xxi)
When in EPC mode (see 3GPP TS 45.008) the occupied physical channels shall
consist of the following channel combinations as defined in subclause 6.4.1.
one main channel of type xxvi) +
x secondary channels of type xxvii) +
y secondary channels of type xxviii)

>
> viii) In presence of PCCCH, the parameter BS_PCC_CHANS in the PBCCH defines
> the number of physical channels for packet data (PDCH) carrying PCCCH. The
> (P)BCCH shall in addition indicate the physical description of those

>
> ix) In CTS, the CTSBCH (CTSBCH-SB and CTSBCH-FB) shall always be transmitted
> by the CTS-FP according to the rules defined in Clause 6 and table 8 of
> clause 7.
In CTS idle mode, a CTS-MS shall be assigned a CTS_PAGING_GROUP, as specified
in subclause 6.5.7. Several CTS-MS can be assigned the same CTS_PAGING_GROUP.
The CTS-MS shall determine the specific 52-multiframe where a paging block may
be sent to it according to the rule defined in subclause 6.5.7, and shall
listen to the CTSBCH of the previous 52-multiframe. In this 52-multiframe, the
CTS-MS shall decode the CTSBCH-SB information bits : if the flag indicating
the presence of a CTSPCH in the next 52-multiframe is properly set (see 3GPP
TS 44.056), the CTS-MS shall listen to the next CTSPCH and read the paging
block. With this method, it is not necessary to maintain on the physical
channel the CTSPCH : the CTSPCH shall only be transmitted when a paging
message shall be addressed to one or several CTS-MS in a CTS paging group.
When using the CTSARCH, the CTS-MS shall send two bursts on the CTSARCH: these
two bursts shall be sent on two successive frames and shall fulfil the mapping
defined in table 8 of clause 7, with the requirement of the first burst being
sent in a TDMA frame with even FN. They shall contain the same access request
message, which is specified in 3GPP TS 44.056. The first sent burst can be
used by the CTS-FP to assess the path loss between the CTS-MS and itself, in
order to effectively decode the second burst.
> x) For COMPACT, the base transceiver station shall transmit a burst in a
> PDCH allocated to carry CPBCCH, in all TDMA Frames where CPBCCH, CFCCH, CSCH
> is allocated or where CPPCH can appear. In TDMA Frames where CPPCH can
> appear on the physical channel where CPBCCH is allocated, the base
> transceiver station shall transmit a dummy block in case no block is
> required to be transmitted.
>
> xi) For COMPACT, a base station does not transmit a burst in every timeslot
> of every TDMA frame in the downlink of the COMPACT control carrier (i.e.,
> discontinuous transmission is used).
>
> xii) For COMPACT, inter base station time synchronization is required.
> Timeslot number (TN) = i (i = 0 to 7) and frame number (FN) with FN mod 208
> =0 shall occur at the same time in all cells.
>
> xiii) For the primary COMPACT carrier, timeslot numbers (TN) 1, 3, 5, and 7
> shall support channel combination xxii) in subclause 6.4.1. TNs 0, 2, 4, and

>
> xv) For the secondary COMPACT carrier(s) not carrying CPCCCH, timeslot

> subclause 6.4.1.
>
> xvi) For COMPACT, BS_PAG_BLKS_RES shall be less than or equal to 8 and less
> than or equal to 10-BS_PBCCH_BLKS.
>
> xvii) For COMPACT, CFCCH, CSCH, CPBCCH, and CPCCCH are rotated as described
> in subclause 6.3.2.1. PDTCH, PACCH, and PTCCH do not rotate.
>
> xviii) For COMPACT, the parameters NIB_CCCH_0, NIB_CCCH_1, NIB_CCCH_2, and
> NIB_CCCH_3 shall not be broadcast for a serving time group.
>
> xix) For the COMPACT, NIB_CCCH_0, NIB_CCCH_1, NIB_CCCH_2, and NIB_CCCH_3
> blocks shall be idle for non-serving time groups and rotate in accordance
> with the non-serving time groups.
The downlink position of the NIB_CCCH idle blocks is based on the ordered list
as defined in subclause 6.3.2.1. The MS shall ignore these downlink idle
blocks and shall interpret this action as not having detected an assigned USF
value on an assigned PDCH.
> xx) For COMPACT large cells, NIB_CCCH_0, NIB_CCCH_1, NIB_CCCH_2, and
> NIB_CCCH_3 blocks shall be idle on timeslots immediately preceding and
> succeeding non-serving time groups and rotate in accordance with the non-
> serving time groups. The MS shall ignore these downlink idle blocks and
> shall interpret this action as not having detected an assigned USF value on
> an assigned PDCH.
The downlink position of the NIB_CCCH idle blocks is based on the ordered list
as defined in subclause 6.3.2.1.
> xxi) For COMPACT, the MS attempts uplink random access on its designated
> serving time group (TG) by monitoring for USF=FREE in every downlink block.
For dynamic allocation, while in the uplink transfer state, the MS monitors
all of the downlink non-idle blocks of its assigned PDCH for uplink
assignments. The MS shall ignore downlink idle blocks and shall interpret this
action as not having detected an assigned USF value on an assigned PDCH.
USF should be set equal to FREE for downlink non-idle blocks B0 on timeslot
numbers (TN) 1, 3, 5, and 7.
> xxii) While in broadcast/multicast receive mode (see 3GPP TS 45.008), the MS
> shall continue to monitor system information either on the BCCH or, if
> present, on the PBCCH unless the network has indicated that system
> information and paging messages are sent on the PACCH for the MBMS radio
> bearer the MS listens to. If the network has not indicated that system
> information and paging messages are sent on the PACCH, or if the MS does not
> have an MS_ID, the MS shall additionally read paging messages either from
> the CCCH or, if the PBCCH is present, from the PCCCH. The MS shall then
> monitor the same paging group as in packet idle mode, i.e. shall determine
> the paging blocks to monitor using the methods described in subclause 6.5.2
> or subclause 6.5.6. If the location of the MBMS radio bearer with respect to
> the control channels does not allow the mobile station to satisfy this
> requirement, the mobile station shall not read those radio blocks of the
> MBMS radio bearer that would prevent the monitoring of its paging group on
> the paging channel(s).
>
> xxiii) For a mobile in DLMC configuration, fallback to reception of a single
> carrier, irrespective of the number of assigned carriers, is performed with
> regular periodicity. The periodicity is based on BS_PA_MFRMS, which
> indicates the number of 52-multiframes between two fallback periods. A
> mobile belongs to a particular single carrier fallback group which
> identifies a specific basic radio block period, or in case of RTTI mode two
> consecutive reduced radio block periods, within the set of "available"
> single carrier fallback blocks, during which it performs single carrier
> fallback. The single carrier fallback applies to all assigned PDCHs (or PDCH
> pairs, in case of RTTI mode) on the carrier where single carrier fallback is
> performed.
>
> The method by which a particular mobile determines to which single carrier
> fallback group it belongs is defined in subclause 6.5.8. Single carrier
> fallback is performed on the carrier where the PTCCH is assigned. In case no
> PTCCH is assigned the single carrier fallback is performed on the carrier
> with the lowest number (see 3GPP TS 44.060 for numbering of carriers).
> Irrespective of which carrier is used, the single carrier fallback applies
> to all assigned PDCHs (in BTTI configuration)/PDCH-pairs (in RTTI
> configuration) on that carrier. In case of inter-band reception, the single
> carrier fallback only applies in one frequency band.

### 6.5.2 Determination of CCCH_GROUP and PAGING_GROUP for MS in idle mode
This sub-clause applies to the case where a MS is not using extended DRX
cycles.
CCCH_GROUP (0 .. BS_CC_CHANS‑1) = ((IMSI mod 1000) mod (BS_CC_CHANS x N)) div
N
PAGING_GROUP (0 .. N‑1) = ((IMSI mod 1000) mod (BS_CC_CHANS x N)) mod N
where
N = number of paging blocks \"available\" on one CCCH = (number of paging
blocks \"available\" in a 51-multiframe on one CCCH) x BS_PA_MFRMS.
IMSI = International Mobile Subscriber Identity, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003.
mod = Modulo.
div = Integer division.
### 6.5.2a Determination of CCCH_GROUP, PAGING_GROUP_MF and PAGING_GROUP_PCH
for MS in idle mode when using extended DRX cycles
The CCCH on which a MS will listen for paging messages and make random
accesses is determined by CCCH_GROUP, defined by:
CCCH_GROUP (0 ... BS_CC_CHANS‑1) = (I div M) **mod** BS_CC_CHANS
where
BS_CC_CHANS = Number of CCCHs, ranges from 1 to 4, determined using CCCH_CONF
broadcast in SI.
I = IMSI mod 10000000 (IMSI defined in 3GPP TS 23.003)
M = Number of 51-MF per negotiated eDRX Cycle = BS_ePA_MFRMS (see Table
6.5.6a-1)
The 51-multiframe where the paging group occurs on the applicable CCCH_GROUP
is determined by:
PAGING_GROUP_MF (0 .. M-1) = I mod M
The paging group within the 51-multiframe is determined by:
PAGING_GROUP_PCH (0 ... L-1) = (I div (BS_CC_CHANS x M)) mod L where
L = number of paging blocks per 51-MF, determined using BS_AG_BLKS_RES
broadcast in SI.
The paging group within the negotiated eDRX cycle is derived according to:
PAGING_GROUP (0 ... N‑1) = L x PAGING_GROUP_MF + PAGING_GROUP_PCH
> where
N = number of paging groups on one CCCH within a given eDRX cycle =
BS_ePA_MFRMS x L (see Table 6.5.6a-1).
The procedure for when the MS shall monitor the CCCH is described in 3GPP TS
44.018.
For determination of specific paging multiframe and paging block index when
using extended DRX cycles, see subclause 6.5.3b.
### 6.5.2b Determination of EC_CCCH_GROUP and PAGING_GROUP for MS in idle mode
for EC-GSM-IoT
The EC-CCCH on which a MS will listen for paging messages and make random
accesses is determined by EC_CCCH_GROUP, defined by:
EC_CCCH_GROUP (0 ... EC_BS_CC_CHANS‑1) = (I div M) mod EC_BS_CC_CHANS
where
EC_BS_CC_CHANS = Number of EC-CCCHs, ranges from 1 to 4, broadcast in EC SI.
I = IMSI mod 10000000 (IMSI defined in 3GPP TS 23.003)
M = Number of 51-multiframes per negotiated eDRX Cycle = BS_ePA_MFRMS (see
Table 6.5.6a-1)
The paging group is determined by the eDRX value and the downlink Coverage
Class.
The 51-multiframe where the paging group occurs on the applicable
EC_CCCH_GROUP is determined by:
EC_PAGING_GROUP_MF (0 .. M-1) = I mod M
The paging group within the 51-multiframe is determined by:
EC_PAGING_GROUP_PCH (0 .. L-1) = (I div (EC_BS_CC_CHANS x M)) mod L
where
L = 16 (number of CC1 paging groups per 51-multiframe)
The paging group within the negotiated eDRX cycle is derived by first assuming
downlink Coverage Class 1 (CC1), irrespective of the downlink CC selected by
the MS according to:
PAGING_GROUP_CC1 (0 ... N‑1) = L x EC_PAGING_GROUP_MF + EC_PAGING_GROUP_PCH
> where
N = number of paging groups for CC1 on one EC-CCCH within a given eDRX cycle =
BS_ePA_MFRMS x 16 (see Table 6.5.6a-1).
In case the MS belongs to another downlink coverage class than CC1 (i.e. CC2,
CC3 or CC4), the paging group shall be derived assuming that the physical
resource of PAGING_GROUP_CC1 is contained within the physical resource of
PAGING_GROUP for the downlink CC selected by the MS and is derived per
Coverage Class according to the procedures below.
For CC1:
PAGING_GROUP (0 .. M‑1) = PAGING_GROUP_CC1
For CC2:
PAGING_GROUP (0 .. M‑1) = (PAGING_GROUP_CC1 div 4) mod 4 + 4 x
(PAGING_GROUP_CC1 div 32)
For CC3:
PAGING_GROUP (0 .. M‑1) = (PAGING_GROUP_CC1 div 8) mod 2 + 2 x
(PAGING_GROUP_CC1 div 32)
For CC4:
PAGING_GROUP (0 .. M‑1) = (PAGING_GROUP_CC1 div 8) mod 2 + 2 x
(PAGING_GROUP_CC1 div 64)
where
M = N div CC_DIV
Table 6.5.2-1. CC_DIV.
* * *
CC1 CC2 CC3 CC4 1 8 16 32
* * *
The procedure for when the MS shall monitor the EC-CCCH is described in 3GPP
TS 44.018.
Example assuming a single EC-CCCH: a MS that uses eDRX, where eDRX cycle value
= "0000" (BS_ePA_MFRMS=8) has been negotiated between the MS and the network
(see Table 6.5.6a-1), and that belongs to CC4, will first derive
PAGING_GROUP_CC1 according to 16 x (I mod 8) + (I div 8) mod 16 where I= IMSI
mod 10000000. As a second step the PAGING_GROUP for the applicable downlink
coverage class (CC4) is derived as (PAGING_GROUP_CC1 div 8) mod 2 + 2 x
(PAGING_GROUP_CC1 div 64).
For determination of specific paging multiframe and paging block index for EC-
GSM-IoT, see subclause 6.5.3a.
### 6.5.3 Determination of specific paging multiframe and paging block index
This sub-clause applies to the case where a MS is not using extended DRX
cycles.
The required 51-multiframe occurs when:
PAGING_GROUP div (N div BS_PA_MFRMS) = (FN div 51) mod (BS_PA_MFRMS)
The index to the required paging block of the \"available\" blocks in the
51-multiframe:
Paging block index = PAGING_GROUP mod (N div BS_PA_MFRMS)
where the index is then used with the look‑up table 5 of clause 7 to determine
the actual paging channel interleaved block to be monitored.
In GPRS non-DRX mode, the MS shall listen to all blocks of the CCCH channel.
### 6.5.3a Determination of specific paging multiframe and paging block index
for EC-GSM-IoT
#### 6.5.3a.1 CC1
The 51-multiframe where the paging block is mapped for CC1 occurs when:
PAGING_GROUP div 16 = ([R]{.underline}FN~QH~ div 51) mod (BS_ePA_MFRMS)
where
RFN~QH~ is the TDMA frame number known with an accuracy of a quarter
hyperframe (see sub-clause 3.3.2.2.3)
The index to the required paging block of the \"available\" blocks in the
51-multiframe:
Paging block index = PAGING_GROUP mod 16
where the index is then used with the look‑up table 6a of clause 7 (also
illustrated in figure 13) to determine the actual paging channel interleaved
block to be monitored.
#### 6.5.3a.2 CC2
The two 51-multiframes where the paging block is mapped for CC2 occurs when:
PAGING_GROUP div 4 = ([R]{.underline}FN~QH~ div 102) mod (BS_ePA_MFRMS div 2)
The index to the required paging block of the \"available\" blocks in the
51-multiframe:
Paging block index = PAGING_GROUP mod 4
where the index is then used with the look‑up table 6a of clause 7 (also
illustrated in figure 13) to determine the actual paging channel interleaved
block to be monitored.
#### 6.5.3a.3 CC3
The two 51-multiframes where the paging block is mapped for CC3 occurs when:
PAGING_GROUP div 2 = (RFN~QH~ div 102) mod (BS_ePA_MFRMS div 2)
The index to the required paging block of the \"available\" blocks in the
51-multiframe:
Paging block index = PAGING_GROUP mod 2
where the index is then used with the look‑up table 6a of clause 7 (also
illustrated in figure 13) to determine the actual paging channel interleaved
block to be monitored.
#### 6.5.3a.4 CC4
The four 51-multiframes where the paging block is mapped for CC4 occurs when:
PAGING_GROUP div 2 = (RFN~QH~ div 204) mod (BS_ePA_MFRMS div 4)
The index to the required paging block of the \"available\" blocks in the
51-multiframe:
Paging block index = PAGING_GROUP mod 2
where the index is then used with the look‑up table 6a of clause 7 (also
illustrated in figure 13) to determine the actual paging channel interleaved
block to be monitored.
### 6.5.3b Determination of specific paging multiframe and paging block index
when using extended DRX cycles
The 51-multiframe where the paging block is mapped occurs when:
PAGING_GROUP div L = (FN div 51) mod (BS_ePA_MFRMS)
The index to the required paging block of the \"available\" blocks in the
51-multiframe:
Paging block index = PAGING_GROUP mod L
where the index is then used with the look‑up table 5 of clause 7 (also
illustrated in figure 13) to determine the actual paging channel interleaved
block to be monitored.
### 6.5.4 Short Message Service Cell Broadcast (SMSCB)
When a short message service cell broadcast (SMSCB) message is to be sent, the
message shall be sent on one of the two cell broadcast channels (CBCH): the
basic and the extended cell broadcast channel in four consecutive multiframes
using the block defined in table 3 of clause 7. The multiframes used for the
basic cell broadcast channel shall be those in which TB = 0,1,2 and 3. The
multiframes used for the extended cell broadcast channel shall be those in
which TB = 4, 5, 6 and 7 where:
TB = (FN DIV 51)mod(8)
The SMSCB header shall be sent in the multiframe in which TB = 0 for the
basic, and TB = 4 for the extended cell broadcast channel. When SMSCB is in
use, this is indicated within the BCCH data (see 3GPP TS 44.018), and the
parameter BS_AG_BLKS_RES shall be set to one or greater. When the CBCH is
mapped onto a CCCH+SDCCH/4 channel, use of SMSCB does not place any constraint
on the value of BS_AG_BLKS_RES.
NOTE 1: The MS reading of the extended CBCH is occasionally interrupted by MS
idle mode procedures.
NOTE 2: For a certain network configuration the MS reading of the primary CBCH
is occasionally interrupted by MS idle mode procedures when the MS is GPRS
attached and in packet idle mode.
### 6.5.5 Voice group and voice broadcast call notifications
When mobile stations are to be alerted on a voice group or voice broadcast
call, notification messages shall be sent on the notification channel (NCH),
using the blocks defined in subclause 6.5.1.
When the NCH is in use, the parameter BS_AG_BLKS_RES shall be set to a value
not lower than the number of blocks used for the NCH, see subclause 6.5.1
vii).
### 6.5.6 Determination of PCCCH_GROUP and PAGING_GROUP for MS in GPRS
attached mode
This sub-clause applies to the case where a MS is not using extended DRX
cycles.
If PCCCH is present, then it shall be used in the GPRS attached mode for
paging and access. It shall also be used by an MS performing the GPRS attach
procedure for access and monitoring of network response. In absence of PCCCH,
CCCH shall be used for paging and access. If the determination of the specific
paging multiframe and paging block index as specified in this subclause is not
supported on CCCH by both the MS and the BTS, the method defined in subclause

The MS shall receive paging and perform access on a single (P)CCCH identified
by the PCCCH_GROUP parameter (see subclause 6.5.1).
In non-DRX mode, depending whether there is or not PCCCH channel(s) in the
cell, the MS shall listen :
\- to all M blocks per multiframe where paging may appear on a PCCCH channel,
or
\- to all blocks on a CCCH channel.
In DRX mode, the MS shall listen to the blocks corresponding to its paging
group as defined by the different PAGING_GROUP values.
The required multiframe occurs when:
PAGING_GROUP div (M div 64) = (FN div MFL) mod 64
> where
MFL = multiframe length = 51 for CCCH or 52 for PCCCH
The index to the required paging block of the \"available\" blocks in the
multiframe:
Paging block index = PAGING_GROUP mod (M div 64)
where the index is then used with look‑up tables of clause 7 to determine the
actual PPCH block to be monitored. Table 5 is used for CCCH and table 7 for
PCCCH.
For CCCH, if SPLIT_PG_CYCLE>32 is negotiated, SPLIT_PG_CYCLE=32 shall be used,
in order to provide the MS enough time for BSIC and System Information
decoding.
NOTE: On BCCH, the operator should limit DRX_TIMER_MAX (see 3GPP TS 44.060) to
4 seconds of the same reason.
### 6.5.6a Determination of extended DRX cycle for MS in GPRS attached mode
A MS that uses eDRX (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [10]) indicates an eDRX cycle value
from Table 6.5.6a-1 when negotiating eDRX with the network (see 3GPP TS 24.008
[21] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [22]). After power on and cell selection but before
negotiating an eDRX cycle with the network a MS is not required to monitor the
(EC-)PCH. After cell reselection from a cell where eDRX was used but before
acquiring System Information in the new cell a MS shall monitor the (EC-)PCH
according to its last negotiated eDRX cycle.
Table 6.5.6a-1: Set of eDRX Cycles Supported
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | eDRX\ | eDRX\ | Number of | eDRX cycles | | cycle value | cycle length | 51-MF per\ | per hyperframe | | | | eDRX cycle\ | | | | | (B | | | | | S_ePA_MFRMS) | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 0000 | \~1.9 seconds | 8 | 6656 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 0001 | \~3.8 seconds | 16 | 3328 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 0010 | \~7.5 seconds | 32 | 1664 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 0011 | \~12.2 seconds | 52 | 1024 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 0100 | \~24.5 seconds | 104 | 512 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 0101 | \~49 seconds | 208 | 256 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 0110 | \~1.63 minutes | 416 | 128 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 0111 | \~3.25 minutes | 832 | 64 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 1000 | \~6.5 minutes | 1664 | 32 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 1001 | \~13 minutes | 3328 | 16 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 1010 | \~26 minutes | 6656 | 8 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 1011 | \~52 minutes | 13312 | 4 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Note 1: 53248 | | | | | 51-multiframes | | | | | occur with the | | | | | TDMA FN space | | | | | (2715648 TDMA | | | | | frames) | | | | | | | | | | Note 2: All | | | | | remaining eDRX | | | | | Cycle Values | | | | | are reserved | | | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
### 6.5.7 Determination of CTS_PAGING_GROUP and specific paging 52-multiframe
for MS in CTS mode
CTS_PAGING_GROUP = (CTS-MSI mod N)
where:
CTS-MSI = CTS Mobile Subscriber Identity as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003
N = number of CTS paging groups defined in the CTS-FP and given to the CTS-MS
during the attachment procedure (see 3GPP TS 44.056).
The required 52-multiframe where a paging message may be sent to the CTS-MS
occurs when:
(FN div 52) mod N = CTS_PAGING_GROUP
### 6.5.8 Determination of single carrier fallback group
For a mobile in DLMC configuration the single carrier fallback group is
determined by:
SINGLE_CARRIER_FALLBACK_GROUP (0 .. N‑1) = (TLLI mod 1000) mod N
The specific 52-multiframe during which an MS applies single carrier fallback
occurs when:
SINGLE_CARRIER_FALLBACK_GROUP div (N div BS_PA_MFRMS) = (FN div 52) mod
(BS_PA_MFRMS)
The required single carrier fallback block index is the specific basic radio
block period (in case of RTTI configuration, the basic radio block period
corresponds to two consecutive RTTI radio block periods) in the specific
52-multiframe during which an MS applies single carrier fallback and occurs
when:
Single carrier fallback block index = SINGLE_CARRIER_FALLBACK_GROUP mod (N div
BS_PA_MFRMS)
where
N = number of single carrier fallback blocks \"available\" on one PDTCH =
(number of single carrier fallback blocks \"available\" in a 52-multiframe on
one PDTCH) x BS_PA_MFRMS.
Number of single carrier fallback blocks \"available\" in a 52-multiframe on
one PDTCH = 12.
TLLI = Temporary Logical Link Identity, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003.
mod = Modulo.
div = Integer division.

# 8 Flexible layer one
## 8.1 General
With FLO, the physical layer offers transport channels to upper layers. In
each direction, one or several transport channels can be processed and
multiplexed together by the same coding and multiplexing unit. The detailed
functions of the coding and multiplexing unit are defined in 3GPP TS 45.003.
## 8.2 Transport channels
The offered transport channels are Dedicated CHannels (DCHs). DCHs are
unidirectional and used to carry user or control data on DBPSCH. Depending on
the channel mode of the DBPSCH on which they are used, two general forms of
DCH are defined:
i) Full rate DCH (DCH/F). This channel carries information at a maximum gross
rate of 68.5 kbit/s and shall only be used on DBPSCH/F.
ii) Half rate DCH (DCH/H). This channel carries information at a maximum gross
rate of 34.1 kbit/s and shall only be used on DBPSCH/H.
## 8.3 Mapping of transport channels onto physical channels
### 8.3.1 General
The detailed mapping of transport channels onto physical channels is defined
in the following sections. Subclause 8.3.2 defines the mapping from TDMA frame
number (FN) to radio frequency channel (RFCH). Subclause 8.3.3 defines the
mapping of the physical channel onto TDMA frame number. Subclause 8.3.4 lists
the permitted channel combinations and subclause 8.3.5 defines the multislot
configurations.
### 8.3.2 Mapping in frequency of transport channels onto physical channels
The mapping from TDMA frame number (FN) to radio frequency channel (RFCH) is
done as specified in subclause 6.2.
### 8.3.3 Mapping in time of transport channels onto physical channels
For each DBPSCH using FLO, every transmission time interval (TTI), one or
several DCHs are processed and multiplexed together by the same coding and
multiplexing unit. The single output data block from the coding and
multiplexing unit is called a radio packet and it shall be mapped onto one and
only one DBPSCH. The radio packet is then interleaved on bursts according to
the channel mode and interleaving scheme chosen by layer 3 (see 3GPP TR 45.902
and 3GPP TS 44.118).
The mapping in time of radio packets is defined in table 8.3.3 below where the
columns headed:
> i) "DBPSCH configuration" defines the configuration of the DBPSCH in terms
> of channel mode (full rate or half rate) and interleaving scheme (4 bursts
> rectangular, 8 bursts diagonal or 4 bursts diagonal).
>
> ii) "Sub‑channel number" identifies the particular sub‑channel being defined
> where a DBPSCH supports more than one channel of this type.
>
> iii) "Direction" defines whether the mapping given applies identically to
> downlink and uplink (D&U), or to downlink (D) or uplink (U) only.
>
> iv) "Allowable timeslots assignments" defines whether FLO can be supported
> on, or assigned to, any of the timeslots, or only on specific timeslots.
>
> v) "Allowable RF channel assignments" defines whether FLO can use any or all
> of the radio frequency channels in the cell allocation (CA), or only the
> BCCH carrier (C0). It should be noted that any allocated channel Cx within
> CA could be any radio frequency channel, and that no ordering of radio
> frequency channel number is implied. For example, allocated channel C0 need
> not have the lowest radio frequency channel number of the allocation.
>
> vi) "Burst type" defines which type of burst as defined in clause 5.2 is to
> be used for the physical channel.
>
> vii) "Repeat length in TDMA frames" defines how many TDMA frames occur
> before the mapping for the interleaved radio packets repeats itself.
>
> viii) "Interleaved radio packet TDMA frame mapping" defines, within the
> parentheses, the TDMA frames used by each interleaved radio packet (e.g.
> 0..3). The numbers given equate to the TDMA frame number (FN) modulo the
> number of TDMA frames per repeat length; Therefore, the frame is utilized
> when:
TDMA frame mapping number = (FN)mod (repeat length)
Where there is more than one radio packet shown, each radio packet is given a
separate designation e.g. B0, B1. Where diagonal interleaving is employed then
all of the TDMA frames included in the radio packet are given, and hence the
same TDMA frame number can appear more than once (see 3GPP TS 45.003).
Table 8.3.3: Mapping of radio packets onto physical channels
**DBPSCH Sub‑channel Direction Allowable time slot Allowable RF channel Burst

B1(5,7,9,11), B2(9,11,1,3)
NOTE 1: An Access Burst (AB) is used on the uplink during handover.
### 8.3.4 Permitted channel combinations onto a basic physical subchannel
Four principles regulate the channel combinations with FLO:
\- DCHs shall only be mapped on DBPSCH.
\- On the same DBPSCH, a maximum of 8 DCHs may be allocated.
\- In the same radio packet, a maximum of 4 DCHs may be processed and
multiplexed together by the coding and multiplexing unit.
\- With the exception of the SACCH, logical channels and transport channels
shall not be mapped onto the same DBPSCH.
The following are the permitted ways in which channels can be combined onto
one DBPSCH/F for one MS:
f1) DCH/F(s) + SACCH/TF
f2) DCH/F(s) + SACCH/M
f3) DCH/F(s) + SACCH/MD
f4) DCH/F(s) + SACCH/TPF + EPCCH/F
f5) DCH/F(s) + SACCH/MP + EPCCH/M
f6) DCH/F(s) + SACCH/MPD + EPCCH/MD
NOTE 1: the number of DCHs may be different in uplink and downlink.
NOTE 2: Combinations f2) and f3) are used without EPC in multislot
configurations as defined in subclause 8.3.5.
NOTE 3: Combinations f5) and f6) are used with EPC in multislot configurations
as defined in subclause 8.3.5.
The following definitions are used in the list of half rate combinations
below.
* * *
[Combination designation]{.underline} [Channel combination]{.underline} SUB_FA
DCH/H(s) + SACCH/TH SUB_FE DCH/H(s) + SACCH/TPH + EPCCH/H
* * *
The following are the permitted ways in which channels can be combined onto
one basic physical channel for two MSs on two DBPSCH/H:
g1) SUB_FA + SUB_FA
g2) SUB_FA + SUB_FE
g3) SUB_FE + SUB_FE
g4) SUB_TA + SUB_FA
g5) SUB_TA + SUB_FE
g6) SUB_TE + SUB_FA
g7) SUB_TE + SUB_FE
g8) SUB_OTA + SUB_FA
g9) SUB_OTA + SUB_FE
g10) SUB_OTE + SUB_FA
g11) SUB_OTE + SUB_FE
### 8.3.5 Multislot configurations
#### 8.3.5.1 Multislot configurations for DBPSCHs assigned
A multislot configuration consists of multiple DBPSCH/F assigned to the same
MS. The multislot configuration occupies up to 8 basic physical channels, with
different timeslots numbers (TN) but with the same frequency parameters (ARFCN
or MA, MAIO and HSN) and the same training sequence (TSC).
Two types of multislot configurations exist, symmetric and asymmetric. The
symmetric case consists of only bi-directional channels. The asymmetric case
consists of both bi-directional and unidirectional downlink channels.
The occupied physical channels shall consist of the following channel
combinations as defined in subclause 8.3.4.
x channels of type f2) +
y channels of type f3)
When in EPC mode (see 3GPP TS 45.008) the occupied physical channels shall
consist of the following channel combinations as defined in subclause 8.3.4.
x channels of type f5) +
y channels of type f6)
where 1\ 63 and there is a change from RX to TX.
For type 2 MS it is not applicable.
For circuit switched multislot configurations as defined in subclause 6.4.2.1,
T~ta~ is not applicable.
T~ta~ is not applicable in EC operation.
**T~tb~:**
T~tb~ relates to the time needed for the MS to get ready to transmit. This
minimum requirement will only be used when adjacent cell power measurements
are not required by the service selected.
For type 1 MS it is the minimum number of timeslots that will be allowed
between the end of the last previous receive TS and the first next transmit TS
or between the previous transmit TS and the next transmit TS when the
frequency is changed in between. It should be noted that, in practice, the
minimum time allowed may be reduced by the amount of the timing advance.
For type 1 MS that supports extended TA, the parameter T~tb~ = 2 if TA > 63
and there is a change from RX to TX.
For type 2 MS it is the minimum number of timeslots that will be allowed
between the end of the last transmit burst in a TDMA frame and the first
transmit burst in the next TDMA frame.
T~tb~ is not applicable in EC operation.
**T~ra~:**
Tra relates to the time needed for the MS to perform adjacent cell signal
level measurement and get ready to receive.
For type 1 MS it is the minimum number of timeslots that will be allowed
between the previous transmit or receive TS and the next receive TS when
measurement is to be performed between.
For type 2 MS it is the minimum number of timeslots that will be allowed
between the end of the last receive burst in a TDMA frame and the first
receive burst in the next TDMA frame.
An MS, except for multislot class 30 -- 45, shall be able to decode SCH from a
neighbour cell, independent of its relative timing, using an idle frame in
combination with Tra from the preceding frame.
T~ra~ is not applicable in EC operation.
**Trb:**
Trb relates to the time needed for the MS to get ready to receive. This
minimum requirement will only be used when adjacent cell power measurements
are not required by the service selected.
For type 1 MS it is the minimum number of timeslots that will be allowed
between the previous transmit TS and the next receive TS or between the
previous receive TS and the next receive TS when the frequency is changed in
between.
For type 2 MS it is the minimum number of timeslots that will be allowed
between the end of the last receive burst in a TDMA frame and the first
receive burst in the next TDMA frame.
# B.2 Constraints imposed by the service selected
The service selected will impose certain restrictions on the allowed
combinations of transmit and receive timeslots. Such restrictions are not
imposed by this annex but should be derived from the description of the
services. For example, in the case of circuit switched data the TS numbers
used in the uplink will be a subset of those used in the downlink.
The service selected will determine whether or not adjacent cell power
measurements are required and therefore whether T~ra~ or T~rb~ is allowed for.
# B.3 Network requirements for supporting MS multislot classes
The multislot class of the MS will limit the combinations and configurations
allowed when supporting multislot communication.
GSM 400 network may support extended cell coverage utilising timing advance
values greater than 63. This has an effect that the time for MS to change from
RX to TX will be very short for distant MS. It is necessary for the network to
decide whether requested or current multislot configuration can be supported
by distant MS. If actual TA is great enough it may be necessary for network to
downgrade requested resources or it may be necessary for network to downgrade
current resources.
It is necessary for the network to decide whether the MS needs to perform
adjacent cell power measurement for the type of multislot communication
intended and whether the service imposes any other constraints before the full
restrictions on TS assignments can be resolved. This is best shown by example:
For a multislot class 5 MS in circuit switched configuration (adjacent cell
power measurements required) five basic configurations of channels are
possible which can occur in six different positions in the TDMA frame. The
service itself may determine that asymmetry must be downlink biased, in which
case the last two solutions would not be allowed.
Figure B.1
For a multislot class 13 MS when adjacent cell power measurements are not
required and the service does not constrain the transmit and receive timeslots
to use the same timeslot number. Many configurations of channels are possible
so long as the 5 constraints of the MS are catered for. [Currently services
envisaged only allow for the last example here.]
Figure B.2
# B.4 Multislot capabilities for dual carrier mobile stations
For mobile stations supporting downlink dual carrier, the multislot capability
applicable to dual carrier operation is dependent on the (DTM) EGPRS (high)
multislot class (see subclause B.1), on the _Multislot Capability Reduction
for Downlink Dual Carrier_ field (see 3GPP TS 24.008) and, if provided, on the
_Alternative EFTA multislot class_ field (see subclause B.5) and on the _EFTA
Multislot Capability Reduction for Downlink Dual Carrier_ field (see 3GPP TS
24.008) as signalled by the mobile station as defined in Table B.2. Only
mobile stations of multislot classes listed in Table B.2 can support downlink
dual carrier.

NOTE 0: These configurations can only be used for assignment to an MS
supporting Enhanced Flexible Timeslot Assignment (see 3GPP TS 24.008).
The values of Rx', Tx' and Sum' and Rx_Sum apply for downlink dual carrier
configurations.
If the MS has not indicated support for Enhanced Flexible Timeslot Assignment
(see 3GPP TS 24.008), then Rx', Tx' and Sum' correspond to Rx, Tx and Sum for
the Equivalent multislot class (see Table B.2) and the values of T~ta~, T~tb~,
T~ra~ and T~rb~ of the equivalent multislot class shall then apply as
indicated by Table B.2; if no equivalent multislot class is specified then
Rx', Tx' and Sum' correspond to Rx, Tx and Sum respectively for the signalled
multislot class and the switching times T~ta~, T~tb~, T~ra~ and T~rb~ of the
signalled multislot class shall apply.
If the MS has indicated support for Enhanced Flexible Timeslot Assignment (see
3GPP TS 24.008), then Rx', Tx' and Sum', T~ta~, T~tb~, T~ra~ and T~rb~ all
correspond to Rx, Tx, Sum, T~ta~, T~tb~, T~ra~ and T~rb~ respectively as
defined in subclause B.5.
Possible switching and measurement timings for downlink dual carrier MSs that
have a higher equivalent multislot class compared to the signalled multislot
class are illustrated in Annex E.
Rx_Sum is given by the _Maximum Number of downlink timeslots_ as specified in
Table B.2 minus the number of timeslots indicated in the _Multislot Capability
Reduction for Downlink Dual Carrier_ field (see 3GPP TS 24.008).If the
resultant Rx_Sum is lower than the value given by the field Sum in Table B.1
for the signalled multislot class (or the equivalent multislot class if
different from signalled multislot class) (see Table B.2), then Rx_Sum shall
be assumed to be equal to Sum from Table B.1 for that multislot class.
If the MS has indicated support for Enhanced Flexible Timeslot Assignment (see
3GPP TS 24.008), then Rx_Sum_EFTA is given by the _[Maximum Number of downlink
timeslots]{.underline}_ as specified in Table B.2 minus the number of
timeslots indicated in the _EFTA Multislot Capability Reduction for Downlink
Dual Carrier_ field (see 3GPP TS 24.008). If the resultant Rx_Sum_EFTA is
lower than or equal to the value given by the field Rx in Table B.1 either for
the indicated alternative EFTA multislot class, or for the signalled (DTM)
EGPRS (high) multislot class if no alternative EFTA multislot class is
indicated, then Rx_Sum_EFTA shall be assumed to be equal to Rx + 1 from Table
B.1 for that multislot class.
NOTE: The Equivalent multislot class and corresponding switching times (where
different from the signalled multislot class) apply only for dual carrier
assignments. For assignments which use only one carrier, the signalled
multislot class (and corresponding switching times as specified in Table B.1)
apply.
**Rx':**
Rx' describes the maximum number of receive timeslots that the MS can use per
radio frequency channel per TDMA frame. The MS must be able to support all
integer values of receive TS from 0 to Rx' (depending on the services
supported by the MS) on each radio frequency channel. The receive TS need not
be contiguous. For type 1 MS, all the receive TS (on both radio frequency
channels) shall be allocated within a window of size Rx', and no transmit TS
shall occur between receive TS within a TDMA frame.
**Tx':**
Tx' describes the maximum number of transmit timeslots that the MS can use per
TDMA frame.The MS must be able to support all integer values of transmit TS
from 0 to Tx' (depending on the services supported by the MS). The transmit TS
need not be contiguous. For type 1 MS, the transmit TS shall be allocated
within window of size Tx', and no receive TS shall occur between transmit TS
within a TDMA frame.
NOTE: All transmit timeslots are allocated on the same uplink radio frequency
channel within a radio block period.
**Sum':**
Sum' is the total number of uplink TS and downlink TS (on either radio
frequency channel) that can be used by the MS per TDMA frame. The MS must be
able to support all combinations of integer values of 1 \ i) B(x)^y^ = time group y uses CPBCCH in block x;
>
> ii) C(x)^y^ = time group y uses CPCCCH in block x;
>
> iii) PTCCH = PTCCH as norma;
>
> iv) CFCCH^y^ = time group y uses CFCCH;
>
> v) CSCH^y^ = time group y uses CSCH;
>
> vi) IDLE = idle burst;
>
> vii) X^y^ = block designated as idle for time group y;
>
> viii) Empty = used for traffic as normal.

Figure D.2: COMPACT downlink 52-multiframe structure using 3 time groups for
nominal cells (based on an assignment of 1 CPBCCH and 3 CPCCCHs with
NIB_CCCH_0 = NIB_CCCH_1 = NIB_CCCH_2 = 4, NIB_CCCH_3 = 0). NIB_CCCHis not
broadcast for serving cell time group
NOTE: For uplink 52-multiframe structure (based on an assignment of 16
prioritized CPRACHs, see subclause 6.3.2.2.3a), replace B( ) by R( ) where R(
) denotes CPRACH, move down one block, and rotate according to subclause
6.3.2.1. Replace C( ) by R( ) and move down one block. CPRACH in general can
be mapped as PRACH in table 6 of clause 7.

Figure D.5: Example of COMPACT downlink timeslot mapping and rotation of
control channels using 4 time groups for nominal cells (based on an assignment
of 1 CPBCCH and 3 CPCCCHs with NIB_CCCH_0 = NIB_CCCH_1 = NIB_CCCH_2 =
NIB_CCCH_3 = 4). TG = 0 is illustrated. NIB_CCCH is not broadcast for serving
cell time group
NOTE: For uplink 52-multiframe structure (based on an assignment of 16
prioritized CPRACHs, see subclause 6.3.2.2.3a), replace B( ) by R( ) where R(
) denotes CPRACH, move down one block, and rotate according to subclause
6.3.2.1. Replace C( ) by R( ) and move down one block. CPRACH in general can
be mapped as PRACH in table 6 of clause 7.
