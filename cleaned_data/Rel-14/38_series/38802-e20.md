# 4 Introduction
At the 3GPP TSG RAN #71 meeting, the Study Item description on \"Study on New
Radio Access Technology \" was approved [2]. The study item covers technology
components to be considered for new radio access technologies, e.g. to fulfil
the requirements on IMT-2020. This technical report covers the physical-layer
aspects of these technology components.
# 5 General description of layer 1
## 5.1 Duplexing
NR supports paired and unpaired spectrum and strives to maximize commonality
between the technical solutions, allowing FDD operation on a paired spectrum,
different transmission directions in either part of a paired spectrum, TDD
operation on an unpaired spectrum where the transmission direction of time
resources is not dynamically changed, and TDD operation on an unpaired
spectrum where the transmission direction of most time resources can be
dynamically changing. DL and UL transmission directions at least for data can
be dynamically assigned on a per-slot basis at least in a TDM manner. It is
noted that transmission directions include all of downlink, uplink, sidelink,
and backhaul link. NR supports at least semi-statically assigned DL/UL
transmission direction as gNB operation, i.e., the assigned DL/UL transmission
direction can be signaled to UE by higher layer signaling.
## 5.2 Forward compatibility
Forward compatibility of NR shall ensure smooth introduction of future
services and features while efficient access of the earlier services and UEs
in the same spectrum is still ensured.
In order to ensure forward compatibility of NR, explicit signaling to NR UEs
can indicate reserved resources. At least some reserved resources are
indicated by using at least RRC signaling.
## 5.3 Numerologies and frame structure
Multiple numerologies are supported. A numerology is defined by sub-carrier
spacing and CP overhead. Multiple subcarrier spacings can be derived by
scaling a basic subcarrier spacing by an integer _N_. The numerology used can
be selected independently of the frequency band although it is assumed not to
use a very low subcarrier spacing at very high carrier frequencies. Flexible
network and UE channel bandwidth is supported.
From RAN1 specification perspective, maximum channel bandwidth per NR carrier
is 400MHz in Rel-15. Note that all details for channel bandwidth at least up
to 100 MHz per NR carrier are to be specified in Rel-15. At least for single
numerology case, candidates of the maximum number of subcarriers per NR
carrier is 3300 or 6600 in Rel-15 from RAN1 specification perspective. NR
channel designs should consider potential future extension of these parameters
in later releases, allowing Rel-15 UE to have access to NR network on the same
frequency band in later release
A subframe duration is fixed to 1ms and frame length is 10ms. Scalable
numerology should allow at least from 15kHz to 480kHz subcarrier spacing. All
numerologies with 15 kHz and larger subcarrier spacing, regardless of CP
overhead, align on symbol boundaries every 1ms in NR carrier. More
specifically, for the normal CP family, the following is adopted.
\- For subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz * 2 _^n^_ (_n_ is non-negative integer),
\- Each symbol length (including CP) of 15 kHz subcarrier spacing equals the
sum of the corresponding 2 _^n^_ symbols of the scaled subcarrier spacing.
\- Other than the first OFDM symbol in every 0.5ms, all OFDM symbols within
0.5ms have the same size
\- The first OFDM symbol in 0.5ms is longer by 16 _T_ ~s~ (assuming 15 kHz and
FFT size of 2048) compared to other OFDM symbols.
\- 16 _T_ ~s~ is used for CP for the first symbol.
\- For subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz * 2 _^n^_ (_n_ is a negative integer)
\- Each symbol length (including CP) of the subcarrier spacing equals the sum
of the corresponding 2^− _n_ ^ symbols of 15 kHz.
Resource defined by one subcarrier and one symbol is called as resource
element (RE).
The physical layer design supports an extended CP. Extended CP will be only
one in given subcarrier spacing in Rel-15. LTE scaled **extended CP is
supported at least for 60 kHz subcarrier spacing in Rel-15.** _The CP type can
be semi-static configured with UE-specific signaling._ **UE supporting the
extended CP may depend on UE type/capability.**
The number of subcarriers per PRB is 12.
No explicit DC subcarrier is reserved both for downlink and uplink. Regarding
DC present within the transmitter, DC handling of DC subcarrier in transmitter
side is specified as follows:
\- Receiver knows where DC subcarrier is or is informed (e.g., by
specification or signaling) of where DC subcarrier is or if DC subcarrier is
not present within receiver bandwidth.
\- For the downlink, UE may assume transmitted DC subcarrier at the
transmitter (gNB) side is modulated i.e., data is neither rate-matched nor
punctured.
\- Signal quality requirement (e.g., EVM) corresponding to DC subcarriers is
up to RAN4.
\- For the uplink, transmitted DC subcarrier at the transmitter (UE) side is
modulated i.e., data is neither rate-matched nor punctured.
\- Signal quality requirement (e.g., EVM) corresponding to DC subcarriers is
up to RAN4.
\- For the uplink, the transmitter DC subcarrier at the transmitter (UE) side
should avoid collisions at least with DMRS if possible.
\- For the uplink the specification should define at least one particular
subcarrier as the candidate position of DC subcarrier, e.g., DC subcarrier is
located at the boundary of PRBs
\- For the uplink, means for the receiver to determine DC subcarrier location
should be specified.
\- This involves semi-static signalling from UE and also standard specified DC
subcarrier location.
\- When DC subcarrier is not present, all subcarriers within the receiver
bandwidth are transmitted.
Note that above DC subcarrier can be interpreted as DC subcarrier candidate.
On the other hand, at the receiver side, no special handling of the DC
subcarrier(s) on the receiver side is specified in RAN1. Behavior is left to
implementation, i.e., the receiver may for example puncture data received on
the DC subcarrier.
A slot is defined as 7 or 14 OFDM symbols for the same subcarrier spacing of
up to 60kHz with normal CP and as 14 OFDM symbols for the same subcarrier
spacing higher than 60kHz with normal CP. A slot can contain all downlink, all
uplink, or {at least one downlink part and at least one uplink part}. Slot
aggregation is supported, i.e., data transmission can be scheduled to span one
or multiple slots.
Mini-slots having the following lengths are defined.
\- At least above 6 GHz, mini-slot with length 1 symbol supported.
\- Lengths from 2 to slot length -1
\- For URLLC, at least 2 is supported
The following should be taken into account for designing slot-level
channels/signals/procedures:
\- Possible occurrence of mini-slot/slot transmission(s) occupying resources
scheduled for ongoing slot transmission(s) of a given carrier for the
same/different UEs
\- At least one of DMRS format/structure/configuration for slot-level data
channel is re-used for mini-slot-level data channel
\- At least one of DL control channel format/structure/configuration for slot-
level data scheduling is designed to be applicable to mini-slot-level data
scheduling
\- At least one of UL control channel format/structure/configuration for slot-
level UCI feedback is designed to be applicable to mini-slot-level UCI
feedback
Note that some UEs targeting certain use cases may not support all mini-slot
lengths and all starting positions. Mini-slot can start at any OFDM symbol, at
least above 6 GHz. A mini-slot contains DMRS at position(s) relative to the
start of the mini-slot.
The following targets/use-cases to design mini-slots should be taken into
account.
\- Support of very low latency including URLLC for certain slot lengths
\- Target slot lengths are at least 1ms, 0.5ms.
\- Support of finer TDM granularity of scheduling for the same/different UEs
within a slot, especially if TxRP uses beam-sweeping (e.g., above 6GHz).
\- NR-LTE co-existence
\- Note that this use case also exists for slot-based scheduling
\- Forward compatibility towards unlicensed spectrum operation
The following should be taken into account as starting point for designing
mini-slot-level channels/signals/procedures:
\- Possible occurrence of mini-slot/slot transmission(s) occupying resources
scheduled for ongoing slot transmission(s) of a given carrier for the
same/different UEs
\- DMRS for mini-slot-level data channel is just a re-use of that for slot-
level data channel
\- DL control channel for mini-slot-level data scheduling is just a re-use of
that for slot-level data scheduling
\- UL control channel for mini-slot-level UCI feedback is just a re-use of
that for slot-level UCI feedback
\- Scheduling/HARQ timelines for a mini-slot can be based on scheduling/HARQ
timelines for a slot
\- Scheduling/HARQ timelines for a mini-slot can be based on scheduling/HARQ
timelines shorter than those for a slot
At least for single carrier operation, NR should allow a UE to operate in a
way where it receives at least downlink control information in a first RF
bandwidth and where the UE is not expected to receive downlink control
information or data in a second RF bandwidth that is larger than the first RF
bandwidth within less than X µs.
## 5.4 LTE-NR co-existence
To support the efficient coexistence between NR and LTE operating in the same
licensed frequency band, at least legacy LTE features should be considered in
the NR study, e.g.:
\- MBSFN configuration (for LTE Rel-8 and beyond)
\- TDD UL subframe (for LTE Rel-8 and beyond)
\- SCell activation/deactivation (for LTE Rel-10 and beyond)
\- TDD UL subframe configured by eIMTA feature (for LTE Rel-12 and beyond)
For LTE and NR coexistence, support the following features in NR design.
\- Adapting the bandwidth occupied by NR carrier(s) at least as fast as LTE
carrier aggregation schemes
\- Allowing NR transmissions while avoiding OFDM symbols carrying SRS on an UL
LTE subframe
For LTE and NR coexistence, in NR design, support of flexible starting point
and duration of scheduled resources are considered as a tool to avoid for
example the control region of MBSFN subframes and be able to use resources in
the unused MBSFN subframes of an LTE carrier.
Note: these mechanisms may be reused from forward compatibility mechanisms
NR downlink is supported in MBSFN subframes of LTE.
For adjacent channel/band operation of NR and LTE in the unpaired spectrum, NR
supports efficient adjacent channel co-existence with LTE-TDD using UL-DL
configurations 0,1,2,3,4,5 in unpaired spectrum. NR also supports efficient
adjacent channel co-existence with LTE-TDD using all the special subframe
configurations in unpaired spectrum. The above adjacent channel co-existence
with LTE-TDD does not necessarily imply that two or more frame structures are
to be defined for NR. The wording "efficient" in the above two bullets does
not imply exact alignment of configurations.
Note that DL/UL interference also can be avoided by using dynamically assigned
DL/UL transmission direction in some cases.
It is noted that support or design for the above features do not imply that UE
has to support simultaneous connection of NR and LTE in the same or
overlapping carrier. Also note that the above mechanisms may be reused from
forward compatibility mechanisms, or mechanisms for multiplexing eMBB and
URLLC on the DL, or mini-slot.
NR supports the case when an NR UE is not expected to understand or detect LTE
signals/channels in the frequency band shared by NR and LTE. Initial access
procedure design for NR should be used as a baseline for the case of NR-LTE
coexisting.
LTE-NR co-existence should support the following UL sharing scenarios.
Collocated LTE and NR base stations with network operating UL on frequency F1
where LTE UL and NR UL share UL subframes of LTE. LTE DL on a paired frequency
F3 NR DL transmission on frequency F2 (different than LTE DL frequency). NR UE
operates in either of the following cases based on a common NR design:
\- Standalone NR: UE accesses standalone NR carrier on F2. The UE may not be
connected to an LTE carrier (some UE may not even support LTE).
\- Dual connectivity of LTE and NR: UE accesses LTE PCell (with LTE UL on F1),
then is configured by dual connectivity to also operate NR on F1 (UL) and F2
(DL).
\- NR DL and UL frequencies (and/or NR band number) are signaled by RRC
## 5.5 Carrier aggregation / Dual connectivity
**_For phase 1, carrier aggregation/dual connectivity operation within NR
carriers over e.g. around 1GHz contiguous and non- contiguous spectrum from
both NW and UE perspectives is supported._** Carrier aggregation including
different carriers having same or different numerologies is supported. From
RAN1 specification perspective, the maximum number of NR carriers for CA and
DC is 16. The number of NR CCs in any aggregation is independently configured
for downlink and uplink. NR channel designs should consider potential future
extension of the maximum number of NR carriers in later releases, allowing
Rel-15 UE to have access to NR network on the same frequency band in later
release.
**_Cross-carrier scheduling and joint UCI feedback are supported._**
**_Per-carrier TB mapping is supported._**
# 6 DL concepts
## 6.1 Basic transmission scheme
### 6.1.1 Modulation scheme
QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM and 256QAM (with the same constellation mapping as in LTE)
are supported.
### 6.1.2 Physical layer channel
NR defines physical resource block (PRB) where the number of subcarriers per
PRB is the same for all numerologies. Note that the number of subcarriers per
PRB is 12.
#### 6.1.2.1 Physical resource multiplexing
Multiplexing different numerologies within a same NR carrier bandwidth (from
the network perspective) is supported in TDM and/or FDM manner for both
downlink and uplink. From UE perspective, multiplexing different numerologies
is performed in TDM and/or FDM manner within/across (a) subframe duration(s).
For subcarrier spacing of $2^{m} \times \text{15}$kHz, subcarriers are mapped
on the subset/superset of those for subcarrier spacing of 15kHz in a nested
manner in the frequency domain and the PRB grids are defined as the
subset/superset of the PRB grid for subcarrier spacing of 15kHz in a nested
manner in the frequency domain.
From network perspective, multiplexing of transmissions with different latency
and/or reliability requirements for eMBB/URLLC in DL is supported by using the
same subcarrier spacing with the same CP overhead or using different
subcarrier spacing. In the specification, both approaches are to be supported.
NR supports dynamic resource sharing between different latency and/or
reliability requirements for eMBB/URLLC in DL. Dynamic resource sharing
between URLLC and eMBB is supported by transmitting URLLC scheduled traffic
where URLLC transmission may occur in resources scheduled for ongoing eMBB
traffic. DL dynamic resources sharing between eMBB and URLLC is enabled
without pre-emption by scheduling the eMBB and URLLC services on non-
overlapping time/frequency resources (No specific specification work is
expected).
NR supports indication of time and/or frequency region of impacted eMBB
resources to respective eMBB UE(s).
#### 6.1.2.2 Data channel
NR supports at least functionality where for DL data scheduled for a slot, the
DL data DMRS location in time is not dynamically varying relative to the start
of slot.
#### 6.1.2.3 Control channel
At least QPSK is supported for the modulation of the NR-PDCCH. For single
stage DCI, modulation scheme for NR-PDCCH is only QPSK. In frequency-domain, a
PRB (or a multiple of PRBs) is the resource unit size (may or may not
including DM-RS) for control channel. A NR-PDCCH candidate consists of a set
of NR-CCEs. A NR-CCE consists of a fixed number of resource element groups
(REGs). A REG is one RB during one OFDM symbol which may or may not include
DM-RS. This is at least for the case where the DL control region consists of
one or a few OFDM symbol(s) of a slot or a mini-slot. At least for eMBB, in
one OFDM symbol, multiple NR-CCEs cannot be transmitted on the same REG except
for spatial multiplexing to different UEs (MU-MIMO).
At least for single stage DCI design, a UE monitors for downlink control
information in one or more control resource sets where a control resource set
is defined as a set of REGs under a given numerology. The BW for control
resource set is smaller than or equal to the carrier bandwidth (up to a
certain limit). The control resource set is a set of REGs within which the UE
attempts to blindly decode downlink control information. The REGs may or may
not be frequency contiguous. When the control resource set spans multiple OFDM
symbols, a control channel candidate is mapped to multiple OFDM symbols or to
a single OFDM symbol. The gNB can inform UE which control channel candidates
are mapped to each subset of OFDM symbols in the control resource set. This
does not preclude that UE may receive additional control information elsewhere
within or outside the control resource set in the same or different OFDM
symbol(s). A UE may have one or more control resource sets. NR should support
dynamic reuse of at least part of resources in the control resource sets for
data for the same or a different UE, at least in the frequency domain. From
gNB perspective, DL control channel can be located at the first OFDM symbol(s)
in a slot and/or mini-slot. UE-specific DL control information monitoring
occasions at least in time domain can be configured. At least for single-stage
DCI design, for slots, minimum granularity of DCI monitoring occasion is once
per slot.
The time/frequency resource containing at least one search space is obtained
from MIB/system information/implicitly derived from initial access
information. Time/frequency resource containing additional search spaces, can
be configured using dedicated RRC signaling. NR-PDCCH can be mapped
contiguously or non-contiguously in frequency. Multiple control resource sets
can be overlapped in frequency and time for a UE. A search space in NR is
associated with a single control resource set. The search spaces in different
control resources sets are defined independently. Each candidate of NR DL
control channel search space is composed by _K_ NR-CCE(s). Control search
space includes at least, aggregation level(s), number of decoding candidates
for each aggregation level, and the set of CCEs for each decoding candidate.
The max number of blind decoding candidates for a UE is defined independently
of the number of control resource sets and the number of search spaces.
NR supports a group common PDCCH carrying at least slot format related
information. If the UE does not receive the group common PDCCH the UE should
be able to receive at least PDCCH in a slot, at least if the gNB did not
transmit the group common PDCCH. The network will inform through RRC
signalling the UE whether to decode the group common PDCCH or not. Note that
common does not necessarily imply common per cell. Also, the term group common
PDCCH refers to a channel (either a PDCCH or a separately designed channel)
that carries information intended for the group of UEs. Slot format related
information and defined as information from which the UE can derive at least
which symbols in a slot that are DL, UL (for Rel-15), and other, respectively.
The UE will have the possibility to determine whether some blind decodings can
be skipped based on information on a group common PDCCH (if present). When
monitoring for a PDCCH, the UE should be able to process a detected PDCCH
irrespective of whether the group common PDCCH is received or not.
UE/NR-PDCCH-specific DM-RS and shared/common RS are supported for NR-PDCCH
reception. At least for beamforming, UE may assume the same precoding
operation for NR-PDCCH and associated DM-RS for NR-PDCCH. The reference
signals in at least one search space do not depend on the RNTI or UE-identity.
In an additional search space, reference signals can be configured. A UE
assumes fixed number of RS REs per REG for control channel rate matching when
the REG contains RS REs. For one UE, the channel estimate obtained for one RE
should be reusable across multiple blind decodings involving that RE in at
least the same control resource set and type of search space (common or UE-
specific).
Transmit diversity is supported for NR-PDCCH.
The starting position of downlink data in a slot can be explicitly and
dynamically indicated to the UE.
### 6.1.3 Waveform
OFDM-based waveform is supported. At least up to 40 GHz for eMBB and URLLC
services, CP-OFDM based waveform supports spectral utilization of Y greater
than that of LTE (assuming Y=90% for LTE) where Y (%) is defined as
transmission bandwidth configuration / channel bandwidth * 100%. From RAN1
perspective, spectral confinement technique(s) (e.g. filtering, windowing,
etc.) for a waveform at the transmitter is transparent to the receiver.
### 6.1.4 Multiple access scheme
Synchronous/scheduling-based orthogonal multiple access is at least supported
for DL transmissions, at least targeting for eMBB.
### 6.1.5 Channel coding
The channel coding scheme for data for eMBB is flexible LDPC as the single
channel coding scheme for all block sizes.
The channel coding scheme for DCI for eMBB is Polar Coding (except for very
small block lengths where repetition/block coding may be preferred).
Channel coding techniques for NR should support info block size K flexibility
and codeword size flexibility where basic code design with rate matching
(i.e., puncturing and/or repetition) supports 1-bit granularity in codeword
size. Channel coding technique(s) designed for data channels of NR support
both Incremental Redundancy (IR) (or similar) and Chase Combining (CC) HARQ.
#### 6.1.5.1 LDPC
Code extension of a parity-check matrix is used for IR HARQ/rate-matching
support. Lower-triangular extension, which includes diagonal-extension as a
special case, is used. For the QC-LDPC design, the non-zero sub-blocks have
circulant weight = 1. Circulant weight is the number of superimposed
circularly shifted Z×Z identity matrices. In parity check matrix design, the
highest code rate (_R_ ~max,_j_ ~ ) to design _j_ -th H matrix for is _R_
~max,_j_ ~ \= \~1/5, provided that _N_ ~max~ is not exceeded. At least 20Gbps decoder
information throughput with code rate 8/9 is supported.
For a given shift size Z, a QC-LDPC code can be defined by a parity check
matrix which is defined by its base graph and shift values. Element 1s and 0s
in the base graph is replaced by a circulant permutation matrix of size ZxZ
and zero matrix of size ZxZ, respectively. The shift values of a circulant
permutation matrix can be calculated by a function _P~i,j~ = f_(_V~i,j~, Z_)
where _V~i,j~_ is an integer corresponding to the (_i,j_)-th non-zero element
in a base matrix. The shift value _P~i,j~_ is circularly shifted value from
the identity matrix for the (_i,j_)-th non-zero element in a base matrix. The
ZxZ circulant permutation matrix which shifts the ZxZ identity matrix _I_ to
the right by _P~i,j~_ times for the (_i,j_)-th non-zero element in a base
matrix.
Shortening is applied before LDPC encoding when necessary. Built-in puncturing
of systematic bits is supported for LDPC coding, i.e., at least for the
initial transmission, the coded bits are taken after skipping the first _N_
~sys,punct~ systematic bits.
For at least one base graph, the base matrix consists of five sub-matrices (A,
B, C, D, E) as shown in Fig. 6.1.5.1-1. A corresponds to systematic bits. B is
square and corresponds to parity bits. The first or last column may be weight
1. The non-zero value is in the last row and this row is weight 1 in B. If
there is a weight 1 column, then the remaining columns contain a square matrix
such that the first column has weight three. The columns after the weight
three column have a dual diagonal structure (i.e., main diagonal and off
diagonal). If there is no weight 1 column, B consists of only a square matrix
such that the first column has weight three. The columns after the weight
three column have a dual diagonal structure (i.e., main diagonal and off
diagonal). C is a zero matrix. E is an identity matrix for the above base
graph. These examples are shown in Fig. 6.1.5.1-2.

The rate matching for LDPC code is circular buffer based (same concept as in
LTE). The circular buffer is filled with an ordered sequence of systematic
bits and parity bits. For IR-HARQ, each Redundancy Version (RV), _RV~i~_ , is
assigned a starting bit location _S~i~_ on the circular buffer. For IR
retransmission of _RV~i~_ , the coded bits are read out sequentially from the
circular buffer, starting with the bit location _S~i~_. Limited buffer rate
matching (LBRM) is supported
Before code block segmentation, _L_ ~TB,CRC~ bit TB-level CRC are attached to
the end of the transport block, where _L_ ~TB,CRC~ \1 non-zero power (NZP) CSI-RS resources, a
UE can report _N'_ CRIs (CSI-RS Resource Indicator).
A UE can be configured with the following high layer parameters for beam
management:
\- N≥1 reporting settings, M≥1 resource settings
\- The links between reporting settings and resource settings are configured
in the agreed CSI measurement setting
> \- CSI-RS based P-1 & P-2 are supported with resource and reporting settings
\- P-3 can be supported with or without reporting setting
\- A reporting setting at least including
> \- Information indicating selected beam(s)
>
> \- L1 measurement reporting
>
> \- Time-domain behavior: e.g. aperiodic, periodic, semi-persistent
>
> \- Frequency-granularity if multiple frequency granularities are supported
\- A resource setting at least including
> \- Time-domain behavior: e.g. aperiodic, periodic, semi-persistent
>
> \- RS type: NZP CSI-RS at least
>
> \- At least one CSI-RS resource set, with each CSI-RS resource set having
> K≥1 CSI-RS resources
\- Some parameters of _K_ CSI-RS resources can be the same, e.g. port number,
time-domain behavior, density and periodicity if any
At least one of these two alternatives of beam reporting is supported.
\- Alt 1:
> \- UE reports information about TRP Tx Beam(s) that can be received using
> selected UE Rx beam set(s) where a Rx beam set refers to a set of UE Rx
> beams that are used for receiving a DL signal. Note that it is UE
> implementation issues on how to construct the Rx beam set. One example is
> that each of Rx beam in a UE Rx beam set corresponds to a selected Rx beam
> in each panel. For UEs with more than one UE Rx beam sets, the UE can report
> TRP Tx Beam(s) and an identifier of the associated UE Rx beam set per
> reported TX beam(s).
\- NOTE: Different TRP Tx beams reported for the same Rx beam set can be
received simultaneously at the UE.
\- NOTE: Different TRP TX beams reported for different UE Rx beam set may not
be possible to be received simultaneously at the UE
\- Alt 2:
> \- UE reports information about TRP Tx Beam(s) per UE antenna group basis
> where UE antenna group refers to receive UE antenna panel or subarray. For
> UEs with more than one UE antenna group, the UE can report TRP Tx Beam(s)
> and an identifier of the associated UE antenna group per reported TX beam.
\- NOTE: Different TX beams reported for different antenna groups can be
received simultaneously at the UE.
\- NOTE: Different TX beams reported for the same UE antenna group may not be
possible to be received simultaneously at the UE
NR also supports the following beam reporting considering _L_ groups where _L_
>=1 and each group refers to a Rx beam set (Alt1) or a UE antenna group (Alt2)
depending on which alternative is adopted. For each group _l_ , UE reports at
least the following information:
\- Information indicating group at least for some cases
\- Measurement quantities for _N~l~_ beam (s)
\- Support L1 RSRP and CSI report (when CSI-RS is for CSI acquisition)
\- Information indicating _N~l~_ DL Tx beam(s) when applicable
This group based beam reporting is configurable per UE basis. This group based
beam reporting can be turned off per UE basis e.g., when _L_ =1 or _N~l~_ =1.
Note that no group identifier is reported when it is turned off.
NR supports that UE can trigger mechanism to recover from beam failure. Beam
failure event occurs when the quality of beam pair link(s) of an associated
control channel falls low enough (e.g. comparison with a threshold, time-out
of an associated timer). Mechanism to recover from beam failure is triggered
when beam failure occurs. Note that here the beam pair link is used for
convenience, and may or may not be used in specification. Network explicitly
configures to UE with resources for UL transmission of signals for recovery
purpose. Configurations of resources are supported where the base station is
listening from all or partial directions, e.g., random access region. The UL
transmission/resources to report beam failure can be located in the same time
instance as PRACH (resources orthogonal to PRACH resources) or at a time
instance (configurable for a UE) different from PRACH. Transmission of DL
signal is supported for allowing the UE to monitor the beams for identifying
new potential beams.
NR supports beam management with and without beam-related indication. When
beam-related indication is provided, information pertaining to UE-side
beamforming/receiving procedure used for CSI-RS-based measurement can be
indicated through QCL to UE. NR supports using the same or different beams on
control channel and the corresponding data channel transmissions.
For NR-PDCCH transmission supporting robustness against beam pair link
blocking, UE can be configured to monitor NR-PDCCH on _M_ beam pair links
simultaneously, where M≥1 and the maximum value of _M_ may depend at least on
UE capability. UE can be configured to monitor NR-PDCCH on different beam pair
link(s) in different NR-PDCCH OFDM symbols. Parameters related to UE Rx beam
setting for monitoring NR-PDCCH on multiple beam pair links are configured by
higher layer signaling or MAC CE and/or considered in the search space design.
At least, NR supports indication of spatial QCL assumption between an DL RS
antenna port(s), and DL RS antenna port(s) for demodulation of DL control
channel. Candidate signaling methods for beam indication for a NR-PDCCH (i.e.
configuration method to monitor NR-PDCCH) are MAC CE signaling, RRC signaling,
DCI signaling, specification-transparent and/or implicit method, and
combination of these signaling methods. Note that indication may not be needed
for some cases.
For reception of unicast DL data channel, NR supports indication of spatial
QCL assumption between DL RS antenna port(s) and DMRS antenna port(s) of DL
data channel. Information indicating the RS antenna port(s) is indicated via
DCI (downlink grants). The information indicates the RS antenna port(s) which
is QCL-ed with DMRS antenna port(s). Different set of DMRS antenna port(s) for
the DL data channel can be indicated as QCL with different set of RS antenna
port(s). Note that indication may not be needed for some cases.

orthogonal DL DMRS ports are supported for MU-MIMO. At least the following
DMRS based DL MIMO transmissions are supported for data in NR.
\- Scheme 1: Closed-loop transmission where data and DMRS are transmitted with
the same precoding matrix
\- Demodulation of data at the UE does not require knowledge of the precoding

for PRB bundling equal to a specified value is supported. Configurable PRG
size is also supported for data DMRS.
Dynamic switching between transmission methods/schemes is supported. The
following two sets of transmission parameters are at least supported.
\- Transmission parameter set 1: parameters configured

NR PDCCH channel)_
\- Note: some transmission parameter may belong to both set-1 and set-2
Downlink transmission scheme(s) achieving diversity gain at least for some
control information transmission is supported.
#### 6.1.6.3 CSI measurement and reporting
For NR, DL CSI measurement with X antenna ports is supported. At least for CSI
acquisition, NR supports CSI-RS and SRS.
NR supports aperiodic, semi-persistent, and periodic CSI reporting.
\- Periodic CSI reporting

\- Dual-stage **W** = **W** ~1~**W** ~2~ codebook
**\- W** ~1~ consists of a set of _L_ orthogonal beams taken from 2D DFT beams
> \- The set of _L_ beams is selected out of a basis composed of oversampled
> 2D DFT beams
>
> \- _L_ ∈{2, 3, 4} (_L_ is configurable)

\- The feedback of channel covariance matrix is long term and wideband
\- A quantized/compressed version of covariance matrix is reported by the UE
> \- Quantization/compression is based on a set of M orthogonal basis vectors
>
> \- Reporting can include indicators of the M basis vectors along with a set
> of coefficients
\- Other quantized/compressed versions of channel covariance matrix are not
precluded
\- Category 3: Hybrid CSI feedback
\- Type II Category 1 or 2 CSI codebook can be used in conjunction with LTE-
Class-B-type-like CSI feedback (e.g. based on port selection/combination
codebook)
\- The LTE-Class-B-type-like CSI feedback can be based on either Type I or
Type II CSI codebook
For Type I and II, CSI feedback per subband as well as partial band and/or
wideband feedback are supported. For Type I and II, beam-related feedback can
be also included. For CSI reporting for a component carrier, at least three
different frequency granularities are supported.
\- Wideband CSI
\- Wideband size is determined by UE RF capability of receiving DL signal.
Location of wideband could be configurable by network. For example, wideband
CSI is used for analog beam management at least.
\- Partial band CSI
\- Alt1. UE-specifically configurable bandwidth
\- Alt2. The size is determined by the composition of numerologies or
scheduling time units within the UE-specific wideband.
\- Applicable only when different numerology or scheduling time unit are
multiplexed within wideband.
\- For example, partial band CSI is used for analogue beam management and for
managing CSI per service at least.
\- Subband CSI
\- The band size is determined by dividing wideband or partial band to
multiple bands. For example, subband CSI is used for frequency selective
scheduling and subband precoding at least.
With regard to relating CSI-RS transmission and CSI reporting, the following
combinations are supported at least
\- For periodic CSI-RS,

\- Periodic CSI reporting is not supported
\- Aperiodic CSI reporting is triggered by DCI
\- Aperiodic CSI-RS is triggered by DCI and/or MAC CE
Note that it is possible to dynamically trigger RS and reports through links
in the measurement setting. To support combinations above more flexibly, NR
should allow independent control of CSI-RS indication and CSI reporting
indication timings. The indication may refer to triggering, activation, and
deactivation depending on type of RS/reporting. Also, NR supports mechanism(s)
to trigger aperiodic CSI-RS and aperiodic CSI reporting simultaneously. For
aperiodic CSI-RS timing offset _X_ , support _X_ =0 at least, if aperiodic
CSI-RS triggering is done by DCI. Note that aperiodic CSI-RS timing offset X
refers to the time gap between aperiodic CSI-RS triggering and aperiodic CSI-
RS transmission with regard to the number of slots. For CSI reporting timing
offset _Y_ that is fixed or configurable by the network but with certain
restriction on lower limit of _Y_ to provide sufficient CSI computation time.
Note that aperiodic CSI reporting timing offset Y refers to the time gap
between aperiodic CSI reporting triggering and aperiodic CSI reporting with
regard to the number of slots.
Interference measurement under different interference hypothesis should be
supported in NR. For interference measurement, at least one of the following
schemes is supported.
\- Measurement subsets in both time and frequency domain
\- Interference measurement restriction in both time and frequency domain
At least two types of resources used for interference measurement in CSI
configuration is supported based on the candidates, i.e., ZP CSI-RS, NZP CSI-
RS, and DMRS, including independent or joint usage of any combination of these
three candidates, where ZP CSI-RS based interference measurement is to be
supported among the three candidates. NR supports aperiodic IMR, semi-
persistent IMR and periodic IMR based on ZP CSI-RS for interference
measurement for CSI feedback. For IMR based on ZP CSI-RS, the three different
time-domain behaviors are configured in the resource setting(s).
A UE can be configured with _N_ ≥1 CSI reporting settings, _M_ ≥1 Resource
settings, and 1 CSI measurement setting, where the CSI measurement setting
includes _L_ ≥1 links and value of _L_ may depend on the UE capability. The
CSI acquisition framework (including CSI measurement, Resource, and CSI
reporting settings) supports configurations that provide CSI similar to Rel.14
eFD-MIMO hybrid CSI mechanisms 1 and 2, e.g.
\- Long-term CSI for a number of antenna ports or multiple NZP CSI-RS
resources
\- Short-term CSI for a number of antenna ports with one or more NZP CSI-RS
resources
\- The number of ports for long-term and short-term CSIs can be the same or
different
At least the following configuration parameters are signaled via RRC at least
for CSI acquisition.
_\- N_ , _M_ , and _L_ are indicated either implicitly or explicitly
\- In each CSI reporting setting, at least: reported CSI parameter(s), CSI
Type (I or II) if reported, codebook configuration including codebook subset
restriction, time-domain behavior, frequency granularity for CQI and PMI,
measurement restriction configurations.
\- CSI parameter CRI is supported. CRI functionality includes selection and
reporting of indices for _N_ out _K_ NZP CSI-RS resources. If _N_ ~max~ > 1 is
supported, the value of _N_ is included in the associated CSI reporting
setting, where the maximum value of $N \in \left{
1,2,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},K \right}$ may be a UE capability.
\- CSI reporting band is defined as a collection of (contiguous or non-
contiguous) subbands pertinent to a CSI reporting setting. Three frequency
granularities are supported, i.e., wideband reporting, partial band reporting,
and subband reporting. At least some combination(s) of the CSI parameters
(e.g., CRI, RI, PMI, CQI, etc.) can be configured to be omitted from reporting
within a CSI reporting setting.
\- In each Resource setting:
\- A configuration of _S_ ≥1 CSI-RS resource set(s)
\- Note: each set corresponds to different selections from a "pool" of all
configured CSI-RS resources to the UE
\- A configuration of _K~s~_ ≥1 CSI-RS resources for each set _s_ , including
at least: mapping to REs, the number of ports, time-domain behavior, etc.
\- Time domain behavior: aperiodic, periodic or semi-persistent
\- In each semi-persistent or periodic resource setting, periodicity is
included in the configuration information

indication, Resource setting indication, quantity to be measured (either
channel or interference)
\- One CSI reporting setting can be linked with one or multiple Resource
settings

##### 6.1.6.4.1 CSI-RS
NR supports periodic, aperiodic, and semi-persistent transmissions of CSI-RS
as follows.
\- Semi-persistent transmission
\- Activation(s)/de-activation(s) of CSI-RS resource is triggered dynamically
\- Preconfigured CSI-RS resources can be activated or de-activated
\- Periodic transmission
\- Periodic transmission can be configured by higher layer signaling
\- Periodic CSI-RS transmissions are semi-statically configured/re-configured.
NR CSI-RS pattern with at least the following properties is supported.
\- CSI-RS mapped in one or multiple symbols
The following configurations of NR CSI-RS are supported.
\- UE-specific configuration to support
\- Wideband CSI-RS, i.e. from UE perspective, the full bandwidth the UE is
configured to operate with
\- Partial-band CSI-RS, i.e. from UE perspective, part of the bandwidth the UE
is configured to operate with
CSI-RS configuration for NR also includes at least 'number of antenna ports'.
Configuration can be explicit or implicit. The number of CSI-RS antenna ports
can be independently configured for periodic/semi-persistent CSI reporting and
aperiodic CSI reporting. A UE can be configured with a CSI-RS resource
configuration with at up to at least 32 ports. UE is configured by RRC
signaling with one or more CSI-RS resource sets and CSI-RS resources is
dynamically allocated from the one or more sets to one or more users.
Allocation can be aperiodic (single-shot) and can be on a semi-persistent
basis. Note that semi-persistent CSI-RS transmission is periodic while
allocated.
CSI-RS supports the downlink Tx beam sweeping and UE Rx beam sweeping. Note
that CSI-RS can be used in P1, P2, P3. NR CSI-RS supports the following
mapping structure.
_\- N~P~_ CSI-RS port(s) can be mapped per (sub)time unit
\- Across (sub)time units, same CSI-RS antenna ports can be mapped
\- Each time unit can be partitioned into sub-time units
\- Mapping structure can be used for supporting multiple panels/Tx chains
For beam management overhead and latency reduction, NR also considers beam
sweeping for CSI-RS within an OFDM symbol. Note that the symbol duration is
based on a reference numerology.
NZP CSI-RS resource is defined in NR, as a set of NZP CSI-RS port(s) mapped to
a set of REs within a frequency span/a time duration which can be measured at
least to derive a CSI. Multiple NZP CSI-RS resources can be configured to UE
at least for supporting CoMP and multiple beamformed CSI-RS based operations,
where each NZP CSI-RS resource at least for CoMP can have different number of
CSI-RS ports.
The RE pattern for an _X_ -port CSI-RS resource spans _N_ ≥ 1 OFDM symbols in
the same slot and is comprised of one or multiple component CSI-RS RE patterns
where a component CSI-RS RE pattern is defined within a single PRB as _Y_
adjacent REs in the frequency domain and _Z_ adjacent REs in the time domain.
Note that, depending on the density reduction approach, the _Y_ REs of a
component CSI-RS RE pattern may be non-adjacent in the frequency domain. The
multiple component CSI-RS RE patterns can be extended across the frequency
domain within the configured CSI-RS bandwidth. At least, the numbers of OFDM
symbols for a CSI-RS resource, _N_ = {1, 2, 4}, are supported. The _N_ OFDM
symbols can be adjacent/non-adjacent. OFDM symbol(s) can be configured to
contain CSI-RS only. Density per port in terms of RE per port per PRB is
configurable.
##### 6.1.6.4.2 DMRS
Variable/configurable DMRS patterns for data demodulation are supported. At
least, one configuration supports front-loaded DMRS pattern. Front-loaded DMRS
is mapped over 1 or 2 adjacent OFDM symbols. Additional DMRS can be configured
for the later part of the slot. NR aims for performance at least comparable to
DM-RS of LTE in scenarios where applicable for both LTE and NR.
DMRS configuration can be up to the maximum number of DMRS ports. At least,
the 8 orthogonal DL DMRS ports are supported for SU-MIMO and the maximal 12
orthogonal DL DMRS ports are supported for MU-MIMO. At least for CP-OFDM, NR
supports a common DMRS structure for DL and UL where the exact DMRS location,
DMRS pattern, and scrambling sequence can be the same or different. DMRS for
same or different links can be configured to be orthogonal to each other.
For DL DMRS port multiplexing, FDM (including comb), CDM (including OCC and
Cyclic shift) and TDM are considered. PN sequence is supported for CP-OFDM.
DMRS bundling is supported in time domain. At least time domain bundling with
slot aggregation of DL-only slots is supported. DMRS pattern within the first
slot is not impacted by the time domain DMRS bundling.
##### 6.1.6.4.3 Phase-tracking RS (PT-RS)
For CP-OFDM, time-domain density mapped on every other symbol and/or every
symbol and/or every 4-th symbol is supported. For a given UE, the designated
PT-RS is confined in scheduled resource as a baseline. Presence/patterns of
PT-RS in scheduled resource are UE-specifically configured by a combination of
RRC signaling and association with parameter(s) used for other purposes (e.g.,
MCS) which are (dynamically) indicated by DCI. Whether PT-RS can be present or
not depends on RRC configuration. When configured, the dynamic presence is
associated with DCI parameter(s) including at least MCS. Multiple PT-RS
densities defined in time/frequency domain are supported. When present,
frequency domain density is associated with at least dynamic configuration of
the scheduled BW. UE can assume the same precoding for a DMRS port and a PT-RS
port. Number of PT-RS ports can be fewer than number of DM-RS ports in
scheduled resource.
#### 6.1.6.5 Quasi-colocation (QCL)
Definition of QCL is that two antenna ports are said to be quasi co-located if
properties of the channel over which a symbol on one antenna port is conveyed
can be inferred from the channel over which a symbol on the other antenna port
is conveyed. QCL supports the following functionalities at least
\- Beam management functionality: at least including spatial parameters
\- Frequency/timing offset estimation functionality: at least including
Doppler/delay parameters
\- RRM management functionality: at least including average gain
For DM-RS antenna ports, NR supports:
\- All ports are quasi-collocated.
\- Not all ports are quasi-collocated.
DMRS ports grouping is supported, and DMRS ports within one group are QCL-ed,
and DMRS ports in different groups are non-QCLed. NR supports with and without
a downlink indication to derive QCL assumption for assisting UE-side
beamforming for downlink control channel reception.
For CSI-RS antenna ports,
\- Indication of QCL between the antenna ports of two CSI-RS resources is
supported.
\- By default, no QCL should be assumed between antenna ports of two CSI-RS
resources.
\- Partial QCL parameters (e.g., only spatial QCL parameter at UE side) should
be considered.
\- For downlink, NR supports CSI-RS reception with and without beam-related
indication,
\- When beam-related indication is provided, information pertaining to UE-side
beamforming/receiving procedure used for CSI-RS-based measurement can be
indicated through QCL to UE
\- QCL information includes spatial parameter(s) for UE side reception of CSI-
RS ports
Indication of QCL assumption associated with subset of QCL parameters between
the antenna ports of two RS resources is supported.
By default (i.e., the UE is not indicated), antenna port(s) transmitted on
different CCs can't be assumed to be quasi-collocated except for spatial
domain QCL assumptions.
#### 6.1.6.6 Network coordination and advanced receiver
For coordinated transmission schemes for NR, both the case of co-located TRPs
and the case of non-co-located TRPs are considered. For coordinated
transmission schemes for NR, different types of coordinated transmission
schemes for NR are supported. _Both semi-static and dynamic network
coordination schemes are considered. In supporting semi-static and dynamic
network coordination schemes in NR, different coordination levels should be
considered, e.g., centralized and distributed scheduling, the delay assumption
used for coordination schemes, etc._
NR supports downlink transmission of the same NR-PDSCH data stream(s) from
multiple TRPs at least with ideal backhaul, and different NR-PDSCH data
streams from multiple TRPs with both ideal and non-ideal backhaul. Note that
the case of supporting the same NR-PDSCH data stream(s) may or may not have
spec impact.
## 6.2 Physical layer procedure
### 6.2.1 Scheduling
NR supports both data and control with the same numerology. NR supports at
least same-slot and cross-slot scheduling for both DL and UL. Timing between
DL assignment and corresponding DL data transmission is indicated by a field
in the DCI from a set of values and the set of values is configured by higher
layer. The timing(s) is (are) defined at least for the case where the
timing(s) is (are) unknown to the UE. Both contiguous and non-contiguous
resource allocation for data with CP-OFDM is supported. _Resource allocation
for data transmission for a UE not capable of supporting the carrier bandwidth
can be derived based on a two-step frequency-domain assignment process, i.e.,
indication of a bandwidth part (the 1^st^ step) and indication of the PRBs
within the bandwidth part (2^nd^ step)._
Indication of URLLC transmission overlapping the resources scheduled for an
eMBB UE in downlink can be dynamically signaled to the eMBB UE to facilitate
demodulation and decoding. Indication can be dynamically signaled to a UE,
whose assigned downlink resources have partially been preempted by another
downlink transmission, to increase the likelihood of successful demodulation
and decoding of the TB(s) transmitted within the above mentioned assigned
resource. The indication may be used to increase the likelihood of successful
demodulation and decoding of the transport block based on the pre-empted
transmission and/or subsequent (re)-transmissions of the same TB.
### 6.2.2 HARQ
HARQ-ACK feedback with one bit per TB is supported. Operation of more than one
DL HARQ processes is supported for a given UE while operation of one DL HARQ
process is supported for some UEs. UE supports a set of minimum HARQ
processing time. NR also supports different minimum HARQ processing time at
least for across UEs. The HARQ processing time at least includes delay between
DL data reception timing to the corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission timing and
delay between UL grant reception timing to the corresponding UL data
transmission timing. UE is required to indicate its capability of minimum HARQ
processing time to gNB.
Asynchronous and adaptive DL HARQ is supported at least for eMBB and URLLC.
From UE perspective, HARQ ACK/NACK feedback for multiple DL transmissions in
time can be transmitted in one UL data/control region. Timing between DL data
reception and corresponding acknowledgement is indicated by a field in the DCI
from a set of values and the set of values is configured by higher layer. The
timing(s) is (are) defined at least for the case where the timing(s) is (are)
unknown to the UE.
Code Block Group (CBG)-based transmission with single/multi-bit HARQ-ACK
feedback is supported, which shall have the following characteristics:
\- Only allow CBG based (re)-transmission for the same TB of a HARQ process
\- CBG can include all CB of a TB regardless of the size of the TB. In such
case, UE reports single HARQ ACK bit for the TB
\- CBG can include one CB
\- CBG granularity is configurable
### 6.2.3 Initial access and mobility
#### 6.2.3.1 Synchronization signal and DL broadcast signal/channel structure
NR synchronization signal is based on CP-OFDM. NR defines at least two types
of synchronization signals; NR-PSS and NR-SSS. NR-PSS is defined at least for
initial symbol boundary synchronization to the NR cell. NR-SSS is defined for
detection of NR cell ID or at least part of NR cell ID. The number of NR cell
IDs is targeted to be approximately 1000. NR-SSS detection is based on the
fixed time/frequency relationship with NR-PSS resource position irrespective
of duplex mode and beam operation type at least within a given frequency range
and CP overhead. At least, normal CP is supported for NR-PSS/SSS.
The raster for NR synchronization signals can be different per frequency
range. At least for frequency ranges where NR supports a wider carrier
bandwidth and operation in a wider frequency spectrum (e.g. above 6 GHz), the
NR synchronization signals raster can be larger than the 100 kHz raster of
LTE. When the synchronization signal bandwidth is the same as the minimum
system bandwidth for a given frequency band which UE searches, synchronization
signal frequency raster is the same as the channel raster. For carrier
supporting initial access, for frequency range up to 6 GHz, minimum carrier
bandwidth for NR can be either 5 or 10 MHz and is frequency band dependent.
For frequency range from 6 GHz to 52.6 GHz, minimum carrier bandwidth for NR
can be either 40 or 80 MHz and is frequency band dependent.
At least one broadcast channel (NR-PBCH) is defined. NR-PBCH decoding is based
on the fixed relationship with NR-PSS and/or NR-SSS resource position
irrespective of duplex mode and beam operation type at least within a given
frequency range and CP overhead. NR-PBCH is a non-scheduled broadcast channel
carrying at least a part of minimum system information with fixed payload size
and periodicity predefined in the specification depending on carrier frequency
range.
In both single beam and multi-beam scenario, time division multiplexing of NR-
PSS, NR-SSS, and NR-PBCH is supported. NR-PSS, NR-SSS and/or NR-PBCH can be
transmitted within an SS block. For a given frequency band, an SS block
corresponds to _N_ OFDM symbols based on the default subcarrier spacing, and
_N_ is a constant. The signal multiplexing structure is fixed in a
specification. UE shall be able to identify at least OFDM symbol index, slot
index in a radio frame and radio frame number from an SS block.
One or multiple SS block(s) compose an SS burst. One or multiple SS burst(s)
further compose an SS burst set where the number of SS bursts within a SS
burst set is finite. From physical layer specification perspective, at least
one periodicity of SS burst set is supported. From UE perspective, SS burst
set transmission is periodic and UE may assume that a given SS block is
repeated with a SS burst set periodicity. Note that NR-PBCH contents in a
given repeated SS block may change. A single set of possible SS block time
locations is specified per frequency band. The maximum number of SS-blocks
within SS burst set may be carrier frequency dependent. The position(s) of
actual transmitted SS-blocks can be informed for helping CONNECTED/IDLE mode
measurement, for helping CONNECTED mode UE to receive DL data/control in
unused SS-blocks and potentially for helping IDLE mode UE to receive DL
data/control in unused SS-blocks. By default, the UE may neither assume the
gNB transmits the same number of physical beam(s), nor the same physical
beam(s) across different SS-blocks within an SS burst set. For initial cell
selection, UE may assume default SS burst set periodicity which may be
frequency band-dependent. At least for multi-beams case, at least the time
index of SS-block is indicated to the UE.
For CONNECTED and IDLE mode UEs, NR supports network indication of SS burst
set periodicity and information to derive measurement timing/duration (e.g.,
time window for NR-SS detection). The network provides one SS burst set
periodicity information per frequency carrier to UE and information to derive
measurement timing/duration if possible. In case that one SS burst set
periodicity and one information regarding timing/duration are indicated, UE
assumes the periodicity and timing/duration for all cells on the same carrier.
If the network does not provide indication of SS burst set periodicity and
information to derive measurement timing/duration the UE should assume 5 ms as
the SS burst set periodicity. NR supports set of SS burst set periodicity
values for adaptation and network indication.
For initial access, UE can assume a signal corresponding to a specific
subcarrier spacing of NR-PSS/SSS in a given frequency band given by
specification.
For NR-PSS, ZC-sequence can be used as the baseline sequence for NR-PSS for
study. At least one basic sequence length is defined for each synchronization
signal in case of sequence-based synchronization signal design. The number of
antenna port of NR-PSS is 1.
For NR-PBCH transmission, a single fixed number of antenna port(s) is
supported. No blind detection of NR-PBCH transmission scheme or number of
antenna ports is required by the UE. UE assumes the same PBCH numerology as
that of NR-SS. For the minimum system information delivery, part of minimum
system information is transmitted in NR-PBCH. NR-PBCH contents shall include
at least part of the SFN (system frame number), and CRC. The remaining minimum
system information is transmitted in shared downlink channel via NR-PDSCH.
#### 6.2.3.2 Mobility
For RRM measurement in NR, DL measurement is supported with the consideration
on both single-beam based operation and multi-beam based operation. NR
supports cell-level mobility based on DL cell-level measurement (e.g. RSRP for
each cell) in IDLE mode UE. Note that IDLE mode refers to a UE state similar
to LTE IDLE state, whose exact definition is up to RAN2 and CONNECTED mode
refers to a UE state similar to LTE CONNECTED state, whose exact definition is
up to RAN2. Also, note that cell refers to NR cell which is tied to a same ID
carried by NR-SS. At least NR-SSS is used for DL based RRM measurement for L3
mobility in IDLE mode. For CONNECTED mode RRM measurement for L3 mobility,
CSI-RS can be used, in addition to IDLE mode RS. Detection of neighbor cell
for measurement is based on NR-SS.
Adaptation and network indication of the valid time and frequency resources
are supported which may be used for inter-/intra-frequency RRM measurements
and reports for 'CONNECTED' mode UEs.
RSRP(s) can be measured from the IDLE mode RS. One RSRP value is measured from
the IDLE mode RS per SS block. The measured values are referred to "SS-block-
RSRP". It is RAN1's understanding that "SS-block-RSRP" may correspond to the
"beam quality" in RAN2 agreements in multi-beam case, at least in IDLE mode.
At least one of cell-level and beam-level measurement quantities is supported
for RRM reporting.
#### 6.2.3.3 Paging
For paging in multi-beam operation, beam sweeping is supported for paging. For
the paging channel design at least for RRC idle mode, paging message is
scheduled by DCI carried by NR-PDCCH and is transmitted in the associated NR-
PDSCH.
# 7 Evaluation of DL techniques
## 7.1 Performance evaluation
### 7.1.1 Performance evaluation of waveform
Four evaluation cases for the downlink and uplink are used in link level
simulation depending on evaluation purposes of each usage scenario, which are
\- Case 1a, 1b: single numerology case
\- 1a: Downlink
\- 1b: Uplink, only one UE with narrow bandwidth is located at the edge of
wide frequency band. It is assumed that no wide-band filter upon the whole
frequency band.
\- Case 2: DL mixed numerology case
\- Case 3: UL single numerology case (asynchronous reception between UEs)
\- Case 4: UL mixed numerology case (synchronous reception between UEs)
(also refer to these illustrations in pages 5 -- 9 in R1-163558)
_For each waveform, the RF nonlinearity (refer to R1-167297) is considered in
the evaluation._ General evaluation assumptions are provided in Annex. A.1. In
order to assess the candidate techniques, the following performance metrics
are considered.
\- User spectrum efficiency as performance metric
\- Take into account guard band and time domain overhead. The values and their
calculation method of guard band and time domain overhead should be reported.
\- BLER vs SNR should be reported for calibration
\- OOBE level is reported (Similar to ACLR but applied to adjacent sub-band/UE
instead of carrier)
\- EVM
\- PAPR/Cubic metric
\- UE Complexity
\- The following is also reported
\- Receiver waveform design
\- Rx processing delay
\- Power spectral density
UE spectrum efficiency is defined as follows.
$\eta = \frac{\chi}{T \cdot \omega}$
where χ denotes the number of correctly received information bits by target
user, _T_ is the transmission time of the target user.For Case 1a, ω =_BW_
~carrier~ is the whole bandwidth including system guard band. For Case 1b, 2,
3, and 4, ω is the data bandwidth plus guard tone of the target UE. General
evaluation assumptions are provided in Annex. A.1
Evaluation observations for the downlink are summarized as below.
\- Some evaluations in RAN1 show that Y for a NR carrier can be up to 98% of
the evaluated channel bandwidths for both DL and UL without complexity and
latency constraints [R1-166093]
\- For in-band frequency multiplexing of different numerologies, it is
expected that spectrum confinement on sub-band basis is specified as
requirements on transmitter side in-band emission and EVM requirements and
reception performance in presence of other-subband interferer.
\- From RAN1 perspective, spectral confinement technique(s) (e.g. filtering,
windowing, etc.) for a waveform at the transmitter is transparent to the
receiver.
### 7.1.2 Performance evaluation of multiple access
Evaluation for multiple access schemes consider the following usage scenario
families defined in [TR38.913].
\- eMBB: dense urban, urban macro, rural, indoor
\- mMTC: urban coverage for massive connection
\- URLLC: urban macro, indoor
Link-level simulation and system-level simulation are used for multiple access
evaluation. Link level simulation is used for feasibility investigation of new
multiple access proposals, comparison of different proposals in typical
scenarios. System level simulation is used for comparison of proposals, and
verification with traffic/scheduling/multi-cell interference dynamics. Note
that link level simulation includes link level simulation with optional
analytical model. For link level simulation, the following evaluation metrics
are considered.
\- BLER vs SNR reported for UL and DL calibration
\- BS and UE receiver complexity reported
\- Sum rate region
\- Optional metrics:
\- Sum normalized user throughput (normalized by throughput in orthogonal
case); Sum throughput with minimum throughput constraint for some users
For system level simulation, the following are used as evaluation metrics
\- eMBB: TRP spectrum efficiency and 5th percentile user spectrum efficiency;
user experienced data rate and area traffic capacity; signaling overhead
\- mMTC: Connection density with "connection efficiency" reported; latency for
infrequent small packets; signaling overhead
\- URLLC: Reliability for a target latency
General evaluation assumptions are provided in Annex. A.1.
### 7.1.3 Performance evaluation of channel coding
Evaluations for channel coding candidates with similar code rates and block
sizes.are conducted for each usage case of eMBB, mMTC and URLLC. General
evaluation assumptions are provided in Annex. A.1.
LDPC, Polar and Turbo codes are studied and the following observations are
made.
**\- Performance**
\- At least in AWGN channels, for large information block sizes, all candidate
channel coding schemes show comparable link performance.
\- The performance of LDPC, Polar and Turbo codes is captured in R1-1610600
(update of R1-1610423).
\- It has not yet been possible to draw conclusions directly from these
captured results, owing to different views on the implementation complexities
and possible enhancements which are discussed in more detail below.
**\- Flexibility for code rate and code block size support**
\- LDPC, Polar and Turbo codes can all deliver acceptable flexibility.
**\- Chase- and IR-HARQ support**
\- The proponents of LDPC and Polar have shown schemes for support of both CC-
and IR-HARQ in their respective codes
\- Some companies have concerns on the incremental freezing method of HARQ
support for Polar codes
\- One company has concerns on the complexity of IR-HARQ for LDPC codes
\- The ability of Turbo codes to support both CC- and IR-HARQ is well known
**\- Implementation complexity**
\- LDPC:
\- LDPC codes are widely implemented in commercial hardware supporting several
Gbps throughput and attractive area and energy efficiency with some
flexibility, but with flexibility and features that are more limited than
required for NR; in relation to NR, there are concerns summarised below.
\- The area efficiency reduces for lower coding rates
\- The complexity of LDPC increases with increasing flexibility
\- Proponents consider LDPC codes with limited flexibility to provide the most
attractive area and energy efficiency, and that the characteristics of LDPC
codes in area and energy efficiency remain advantageous even when supporting
full flexibility, while some other companies consider the applicable
flexibility to be limited, for example because a flexible switched network (if
used) has an impact on increasing the power, area and latency
\- LDPC codes are amenable to parallelisation which can provide better
decoding latency
\- Depending on the parity check matrix design, some of this parallelism may
not be exploited for all code block lengths for NR, and some companies have a
concern with this and its impact on energy and area efficiency
\- Some variants of min-sum based iterative decoders are considered
implementable, and allow a trade-off between complexity and performance
\- Two proponents consider quasi-ML decoders (e.g. list 32, ordered stochastic
decoding) implementable for codeword sizes up to 1k
\- BP and sum-product decoders are not considered implementable for NR by some
companies
\- For LDPC there are concerns that implementation with attractive area and
energy efficiency may be challenging when simultaneously targeting the peak
throughput and flexibility requirements of NR
\- Polar:
\- Polar codes are implementable, although there are currently no commercial
implementations, and in relation to NR, there are some concerns as summarised
below.
\- The area efficiency reduces for shorter block lengths and lower coding
rates
\- For list decoders, the implementation complexity increases with increasing
list size, especially with larger block sizes
\- Some companies consider that a List 32 decoder is implementable up to a
codeword size N of at least 1k (with larger codeword sizes requiring a
segmented design), although some other companies have concerns on the
achievable performance (including area efficiency, hardware throughput)
\- Some companies consider that a List 8 decoder is implementable for codeword
sizes N up to 4k (with larger codeword sizes requiring a segmented design)
\- List 4 decoder is considered implementable for codeword sizes N up to at
least 2k, with some companies considering it implementable up to 8k (with
larger codeword sizes requiring a segmented design)
\- List 1 is considered implementable
\- For decoding hardware that can achieve acceptable latency, performance and
flexibility, there are some concerns about the area efficiency and energy
efficiency that are achievable with polar codes
\- Turbo:
\- Turbo codes are widely implemented in commercial hardware, supporting HARQ
and flexibility similar to what is required for NR, but not at the high data
rates or low latencies required for NR; in relation to NR, there are concerns
summarised below.
\- Proponents consider some implementations of turbo codes to meet the
flexibility requirements of NR with the most attractive area and energy
efficiency except at higher throughputs, and particularly at lower code rates
and lower block lengths
\- Other companies consider that the latency and area and energy efficiency
are not adequate for NR, and that the area and energy efficiency reduces at
lower block lengths
\- Only two of the proponents of turbo codes propose turbo codes for the
higher throughputs for NR
\- In some implementations suitable for lower throughputs, the area and energy
efficiency is constant when varying the puncturing and repetition rate.
\- Otherwise, this is not the case, e.g. in some implementations designed for
higher data rates
\- The decoding complexity increases linearly with the information block size
for a given mother code rate
\- The decoding complexity increases as the contraint length increases, and to
a lesser extent as the mother code rate reduces
\- For turbo codes, there are concerns that implementation with attractive
area and energy efficiency is challenging when targeting the higher throughput
requirements of NR
\- Some advanced turbo decoders are considered implementable, and allow a
tradeoff between complexity and performance.
\- Some companies consider quasi-ML decoders are implementable for shorter
information block lengths and codeword sizes up to 1k
\- The proponents consider that a turbo decoder could be designed that would
be capable of decoding both LTE and at least small information block sizes
(K\=1) for the same transport block are
supported.
#### 8.1.2.2 Control channel
Physical uplink control signaling should be able to carry at least hybrid-ARQ
acknowledgements, CSI reports (possibly including beamforming information),
and scheduling requests.
At least two ways of transmissions are supported for NR UL control channel
\- UL control channel can be transmitted in short duration around the last
transmitted UL symbol(s) of a slot. UL control channel is time-division-
multiplexed and/or frequency-division-multiplexed with UL data channel within
a slot. For UL control channel in short duration, transmission over one symbol
duration of a slot is supported.
\- Short UCI and data are frequency-division-multiplexed both within a UE and
between UEs, at least for the case where the PRBs for short UCI and data are
non-overlapping.
\- In order to support TDM of short PUCCH from different UEs in the same slot,
a mechanism to tell the UE in which symbol(s) in a slot to transmit the short
PUCCH on is supported at least above 6 GHz.
\- At least following is supported for PUCCH in 1-symbol duration:
\- UCI and RS are multiplexed in the given OFDM symbol in FDM manner if RS is
multiplexed.
\- Same subcarrier spacing between DL/UL data and PUCCH in short-duration in
the same slot.
\- At least a PUCCH in short-duration spanning 2-symbol duration of a slot is
supported.
\- Same subcarrier spacing between DL/UL data and PUCCH in short-duration in
the same slot.
\- At least semi-static configuration for the following is supported.
\- A PUCCH resource of a given UE within a slot. i.e., short-PUCCHs of
different UEs can be time-division multiplexed within the given duration in a
slot.
\- The PUCCH resource includes time, frequency and, when applicable, code
domains.
\- PUCCH in short-duration can span until the end of a slot from UE
perspective
\- No explicit gap symbol is necessary after the PUCCH in short-duration.
\- For a slot having short UL-part (i.e., DL-centric slot):
\- 'Short UCI' and data can be frequency-division multiplexed by one UE if a
data is scheduled on the short UL-part.
UL control channel can be transmitted in long duration over multiple UL
symbols to improve coverage. UL control channel is frequency-division-
multiplexed with UL data channel within a slot.
\- A UCI carried by long duration UL control channel at least with low PAPR
design can be transmitted in one slot or multiple slots.
\- Transmission across multiple slots should allow a total duration, e.g.,
1ms, at least for some cases.
\- For UL control channel with long duration, TDM between RS and UCI is
supported at least for DFT-S-OFDM.
\- Long UL-part of a slot can be used for transmission of PUCCH in long-
duration, i.e., PUCCH in long-duration is supported for both UL-only slot and
a slot with variable number of symbols with a minimum of 4 symbols for PUCCH
transmission..
\- At least for 1 or 2 UCI bits, the UCI can be repeated within N slots (N>1)
where the _N_ slots may or may not be adjacent in slots where PUCCH in long
duration is allowed.
\- Simultaneous transmission of PUSCH and PUCCH at least for the long PUCCH
format is supported, i.e., transmit uplink control on PUCCH resources even in
presence of data. In addition to simultaneous PUCCH-PUSCH transmission, UCI on
PUSCH is supported.
\- Intra-TTI slot frequency-hopping is supported.
\- DFT-s-OFDM waveform is supported.
\- Transmit antenna diversity is supported.
Both TDM and FDM between short duration PUCCH and long duration PUCCH are
supported at least for different UEs in one slot. In frequency-domain, a PRB
(or multiple PRBs) is the minimum resource unit size for UL control channel.
The frequency resource and hopping, if hopping is used, may not spread over
the carrier bandwidth. UE-specific RS is used for NR-PUCCH transmission. A set
of PUCCH resources is configured by high layer signaling and a PUCCH resource
within the configured set is indicated by DCI.
It should be possible to dynamically indicate (at least in combination with
RRC) the timing between data reception and hybrid-ARQ acknowledgement
transmission as part of the DCI. A combination of semi-static configuration
and (at least for some types of UCI information) dynamic signaling is used to
determine the PUCCH resource both for the 'long and short PUCCH formats',
where the PUCCH resource includes time, frequency and, when applicable, code
domains. UCI on PUSCH, i.e., using some of the scheduled resources for UCI is
supported in case of simultaneous UCI and data.
At least UL transmission of at least single HARQ-ACK bit is supported.
Mechanism enabling frequency-diversity is supported.
For URLLC, time interval between SR resources configured for a UE can be
smaller than a slot.
### 8.1.3 Waveform
OFDM-based waveform is supported. At least up to 40 GHz for eMBB and URLLC
services, CP-OFDM based waveform supports spectral utilization of Y greater
than that of LTE (assuming Y=90% for LTE) where Y (%) is defined as
transmission bandwidth configuration / channel bandwidth * 100%. From RAN1
perspective, spectral confinement technique(s) (e.g. filtering, windowing,
etc.) for a waveform at the transmitter is transparent to the receiver.
DFT-S-OFDM based waveform is also supported, complementary to CP-OFDM waveform
at least for eMBB uplink for up to 40GHz. CP-OFDM waveform can be used for a
single-stream and multi-stream (i.e. MIMO) transmissions, while DFT-S-OFDM
based waveform is limited to a single stream transmissions (targeting for link
budget limited cases). Network can decide and communicate to the UE which one
of CP-OFDM and DFT-S-OFDM based waveforms to use Note that both CP-OFDM and
DFT-S-OFDM based waveforms are mandatory for UEs.
### 8.1.4 Multiple access scheme
Synchronous/scheduling-based orthogonal multiple access is at least supported
for UL transmissions, at least targeting for eMBB. Note that synchronous means
that timing offset between UEs is within cyclic prefix by e.g. timing
alignment.
NR targets to support UL non-orthogonal multiple access, in addition to the
orthogonal approach, targeting at least for mMTC.
### 8.1.5 Channel coding
The channel coding scheme for data for eMBB is flexible LDPC as the single
channel coding scheme for all block sizes.
The channel coding scheme for UL control information for eMBB is Polar Coding
(except for very small block lengths where repetition/block coding may be
preferred).
#### 8.1.5.1 LDPC
See subclause 6.1.5.1.
#### 8.1.5.1 Polar coding
See subclause 6.1.5.2. Maximum mother code size of Polar code, _N_ =_2_ ^n^,
is _N_ ~max,UCI~ = 1024 for uplink control information.
### 8.1.6 Multi-antenna scheme
#### 8.1.6.1 Beam management and CSI acquisition
For UL CSI acquisition, UE can be configured with multiple SRS resources,
where UE can be configured to transmit SRS in each configured SRS resource. In
NR, UE reports its capability regarding the max number of spatial layers for
UL transmission. NR supports UL codebook for an UE based on the reported
capability. At least, one of the followings is supported.
\- Alt1: Network configures multiple codebooks each corresponding to the
number of antenna ports
\- Alt2: Network configures a scalable/nested codebook supporting the variable
number of antenna ports
\- Alt3: Network configures a codebook same as UE capability
\- Alt 4: UE recommends a subset of codebook(s)
\- This alternative may be absorbed into one or more the above alternatives
As for the UL codebook structure, at least one of the following two is
supported
\- Alt 0: single-stage codebook
\- Alt 1: dual-stage codebook
#### 8.1.6.2 MIMO schemes
For NR, the number of codewords per PUSCH assignment per UE is 1 codeword for
1 to 4-layer transmission.
The following aspects for UL MIMO transmission should be supported.
Transmission schemes/methods for reciprocity calibrated UEs, reciprocity non-
calibrated UEs, and non-reciprocity/partial reciprocity cases are considered.
\- At least the following candidate schemes/methods are supported for data.
\- Candidate 1: Codebook based transmission
\- Frequency selective precoding is supported for CP-OFDM when the number of
transmission port(s) is equal to or greater than X.
\- Candidate 2: Non-codebook based transmission
\- Frequency selective precoding is supported for CP-OFDM when the number of
transmission port(s) is equal to or greater than Y.
\- The indication of DL measurement RS is supported for UE to calculate
candidate precoder
\- Diversity-based transmission schemes
\- For DFT-S-OFDM, CDD, precoder cycling, antenna port switching, SFBC, and
STBC can be the candidates for UL diversity schemes for UL data
Dynamic switching between transmission methods/schemes is supported. Rank
determination is performed by gNB. PRB bundling is supported for CP-OFDM and
for DFT-s-OFDM based transmission. For CP-OFDM based transmission, PRB
bundling is supported for both codebook based and non-codebook based
transmissions. For DFT-S-OFDM based transmission, PRB bundling size is the
whole scheduled bandwidth if the scheduled bandwidth comprises a single
cluster. Note that UE shall apply the precoder in a way that the gNB may
assume that UE uses the same precoder for all scheduled PRBs.
UL DMRS based spatial multiplexing (SU-MIMO/MU-MIMO) is supported. At least a
maximum of 4 layers uplink SU-MIMO transmission is supported.
At least one of precoded and non-precoded SRS based UL link adaptation
procedure is supported in NR, with at least following three different
procedures:
\- UL data scheduling (MCS/precoder/rank) is based on non-precoded SRS
transmission by UE
\- Configurable number of SRS ports are 1, 2, or 4 at least.
\- UL data scheduling (MCS/precoder/rank) is based on precoded SRS(s)
transmission by UE
\- Configurable number of SRS ports are 1, 2, or 4 at least.
\- Multiple precoded SRS resources can be configured.
\- The followings are supported
\- Precoder for SRS can be determined by UE based on measurement on DL RS and
\- Precoder for SRS can be indicated by gNB
\- UL data scheduling (MCS/precoder/rank) is based on a combination of non-
precoded and precoded SRS transmission by UE
Note that some parts of above procedures might be transparent to UE.
NR supports UL-MIMO scheduling by DCI, which includes at least some of
\- Indication of a SRS resource (SRI) which has been transmitted by UE in
previous time instance
\- Each configured SRS resource is associated with at least one UL Tx
beam/precoder
\- Transmit Rank indicator (TRI)
\- Possible values are up to the number of SRS ports configured in the
indicated SRI
\- Wideband transmit PMI (TPMI)
\- UL MCS indication
\- UL HARQ related information
\- UL Resource allocation
#### 8.1.6.3 Reference signal related to multi-antenna scheme
The following RSs are at least supported for NR uplink.
\- SRS: Reference signal with main functionalities of CSI acquisition, beam
management
\- DM-RS: Reference signal with main functionalities of data and control
demodulation
\- Reference signal for phase tracking
##### 8.1.6.3.1 SRS
NR SRS design should not assume a particular antenna configuration at UE and
should support dynamic port/antenna/resource selection by gNB and UE. In the
case of UE selection, it can be disabled/enabled by gNB (if the UE selection
is not transparent).
NR UL supports transmissions of SRS precoded with same and different UE Tx
beams within a time duration. NR supports the following Tx beamformer
determination for SRS.
\- UE applies gNB-transparent Tx beamformer to SRS, e.g., UE determines Tx
beam for each SRS port/resource
\- Based on gNB indication, e.g. via SRI
NR supports SRS transmission including number of SRS ports are 1, 2, and 4 at
least, Comb levels of 2 and 4, and configurable frequency hopping.
Configurable SRS bandwidth is supported. SRS can be configurable with regard
to density in frequency domain (e.g., comb levels) and/or in time domain
(including multi-symbol SRS transmissions). Partial band size and full band
size can be configured. Partial-band is smaller than the largest transmission
bandwidth supported by the UE. Within a partial-band, the PRBs for SRS
transmission can at least be consecutive in the frequency domain. _Frequency
hopping is supported within a partial-band for a UE where at least hopping
with a granularity of subband is supported._ For the full band size, the size
is equal to the largest transmission bandwidth supported by the UE. The
numerology(ies) for the SRS transmissions can be also configurable for a UE.
An NR-SRS resource comprises of a set of resource elements (RE) within a time
duration/frequency span and _N_ antenna ports (_N_ ≥ 1). A UE can be
configured with _K_ ≥ 1 NR-SRS resources. The maximum value of _K_ is
considered to be a UE capability to avoid mandatory support for large values
of _K_. Out of K ≥ 1 configured NR-SRS resources, for aperiodic transmission,
the UE can be configured to transmit a subset of or all K NR-SRS resources
with no precoding, the same, or different precoding. For periodic and semi-
persistent transmission, out of K ≥ 1 configured NR-SRS resources, the UE can
be configured to transmit _K_ NR-SRS resources with no precoding, the same, or
different precoding.
_SRS transmissions with sequences achieving low-PAPR and possible multiplexing
of SRS with different SRS bandwidths in the same symbol are considered._
Aperiodic SRS transmission triggered by the network is supported. Periodic and
semi-persistent NR-SRS transmissions are also supported.
##### 8.1.6.3.2 PT-RS
For CP-OFDM, time-domain density mapped on every other symbol and/or every
symbol and/or every 4-th symbol is supported. At least for UL, the presence of
PT-RS is UE-specifically configured .PT-RS is confined in the scheduled
time/frequency duration for a UE. For a given UE, the designated PT-RS is
confined in scheduled resource as a baseline. Presence/patterns of PT-RS in
scheduled resource are UE-specifically configured by a combination of RRC
signaling and association with parameter(s) used for other purposes (e.g.,
MCS) which are (dynamically) indicated by DCI. Whether PT-RS can be present or
not depends on RRC configuration. When configured, the dynamic presence is
associated with DCI parameter(s) including at least MCS. Multiple PT-RS
densities defined in time/frequency domain are supported. When present,
frequency domain density is associated with at least dynamic configuration of
the scheduled BW. UE can assume the same precoding for a DMRS port and a PT-RS
port. Number of PT-RS ports can be fewer than number of DM-RS ports in
scheduled resource.
In NR, frequency offset and PN compensation for DFT-s-OFDM are also
considered.
## 8.2 Physical layer procedure
### 8.2.1 Random access procedure
#### 8.2.1.1 Preamble
NR defines that
\- a random access preamble format consists of one or multiple random access
preamble(s),
\- a random access preamble consists of one preamble sequence plus CP, and
\- one preamble sequence consists of one or multiple RACH OFDM symbol(s)
UE transmits PRACH according to the configured random access preamble format.
NR supports multiple RACH preamble formats, including at least RACH preamble
formats with longer preamble length and shorter preamble length.
Multiple/repeated RACH preambles in a RACH resource are supported. Numerology
for RACH preamble can be different depending on frequency ranges. Numerology
for RACH preamble can be different from or the same as that for the other UL
data/control channels.
For a single RACH preamble transmission, CP/GT are required. For example, the
single RACH preamble would be used when Tx/Rx beam correspondence held at both
TRP and UE for multi-beam operation.
For single/multi-beam operation, the following multiple/repeated RACH preamble
transmission is at least supported.
\- CP is inserted at the beginning of the consecutive multiple/repeated RACH
OFDM symbols, CP/GT between RACH symbols is omitted and GT is reserved at the
end of the consecutive multiple/repeated RACH symbols
The region for PRACH transmission is aligned to the boundary of uplink
symbol/slot/subframe. For supporting various coverage and forward
compatibility, flexibility in the length of CP/GT and the number of repeated
RACH preambles and RACH symbols is supported. Note that specific use of the
RACH preamble transmission may depend on RACH subcarrier spacing and TRP beam
correspondence.
#### 8.2.1.2 Procedure
RACH procedure including RACH preamble (Msg. 1), random access response (Msg.
2), message 3, and message 4 is assumed for NR from physical layer
perspective. Random access procedure is supported for both IDLE mode and
CONNECTED mode UEs. For 4-step RACH procedure, a RACH transmission occasion is
defined as the time-frequency resource on which a PRACH message 1 is
transmitted using the configured PRACH preamble format with a single
particular tx beam
RACH resource is also defined as a time-frequency resource to send RACH
preamble. Whether UE needs to transmit one or multiple/repeated preamble
within a subset of RACH resources can be informed by broadcast system
information, e.g., to cover gNB RX beam sweeping in case of NO Tx/Rx beam
correspondence at the gNB.
Regardless of whether Tx/Rx beam correspondence is available or not at gNB at
least for multiple beams operation, the following RACH procedure is considered
for at least UE in idle mode. Association between one or multiple occasions
for DL broadcast channel/signal and a subset of RACH resources is informed to
UE by broadcast system information or known to UE. Based on the DL measurement
and the corresponding association, UE selects the subset of RACH preamble
indices. UE Tx beam(s) for preamble transmission(s) is selected by the UE.
During a RACH transmission occasion of single or multiple/repeated preamble(s)
as informed by broadcast system information, UE uses the same UE Tx beam. NR
at least supports transmission of a single Msg.1 before the end of a monitored
RAR window.
At least for the case without gNB Tx/Rx beam correspondence, gNB can configure
an association between DL signal/channel, and a subset of RACH resources
and/or a subset of preamble indices, for determining Msg2 DL Tx beam. Based on
the DL measurement and the corresponding association, UE selects the subset of
RACH resources and/or the subset of RACH preamble indices. A preamble index
consists of preamble sequence index and OCC index, if OCC is supported. Note
that a subset of preambles can be indicated by OCC indices.
Regardless of whether Tx/Rx beam correspondence is available or not at gNB at
least for multiple beams operation, at gNB, the DL Tx beam for message 2 can
be obtained based on the detected RACH preamble/resource and the corresponding
association. UL grant in message 2 may indicate the transmission timing of
message 3. As baseline UE behavior, UE assumes single RAR reception within a
given RAR window.
At least for UE in idle mode, UL Tx beam for message 3 transmission is
determined by UE. UE may use the same UL Tx beam used for message 1
transmission.
Different PRACH configurations will be supported, e.g., considering different
numerologies case and whether Tx/Rx beam correspondence is available or not at
gNB.
For NR RACH Msg. 1 retransmission at least for multi-beam operation, NR
supports power ramping. If UE doesn't change beam, the counter of power
ramping keeps increasing. Note that UE may derive the uplink transmit power
using the most recent estimate of path loss. Whether UE performs UL Beam
switching during retransmissions is up to UE implementation. Note that which
beam UE switches to is up to UE implementation.
### 8.2.2 Scheduling
NR supports both data and control with the same numerology. The same-slot and
cross-slot scheduling for UL is supported. Timing between UL assignment and
corresponding UL data transmission is indicated by a field in the DCI from a
set of values and the set of values is configured by higher layer. For slot-
based scheduling, UL assignment in slot _N_ and corresponding uplink data
transmission in slot _N_ +_K_ 2 is to be specified. The timing(s) is (are)
defined at least for the case where the timing(s) is (are) unknown to the UE.
Both contiguous and non-contiguous resource allocation for data with CP-OFDM
is supported.
At least an UL transmission scheme without grant is supported for URLLC.
Resource may or may not be shared among one or more users. Also, an UL
transmission scheme without grant is targeted to be supported for mMTC. **For
UL transmission without grant, the resource configuration includes at least**
time and frequency resources, modulation and coding scheme(s), possibly
including RV, implicitly or explicitly, and reference signal parameters. **For
UE configured with _K_ repetitions for a TB transmission with/without grant,
the UE can continue repetitions for the TB until one of the following
conditions is met.**
\- If an UL grant is successfully received for a slot/mini-slot for the same
TB
\- The number of repetitions for that TB reaches _K_
\- Note that this does not assume that UL grant is scheduled based on the slot
whereas grant free allocation is based on mini-slot (vice versa)
### 8.2.3 Power control
For NR-PUSCH at least targeting eMBB, both open-loop and closed-loop power
controls are supported. Open-loop based on pathloss estimate is supported
where pathloss measurement for UL power control is to be based on at least one
type of DL RS for beam measurement. Note that beam measurement RS includes
CSI-RS, RS defined for mobility purpose. The same gNB antenna port can be used
for pathloss measurement for multiple processes.
Fractional power control is supported. Closed-loop power control is based on
NW signaling. Dynamic UL-power adjustment is considered.
Separate power control process can be supported for transmission of different
channel/RS (i.e., PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS).
NR supports beam specific power control as baseline. Power control for UE side
multiple panel transmission is supported.
### 8.2.4 HARQ
Operation of more than one UL HARQ processes is supported for a given UE while
operation of one UL HARQ process is also supported for some UEs. Asynchronous
and adaptive UL HARQ is supported at least for eMBB.
# 9 Evaluation of UL techniques
## 9.1 Performance evaluation
### 9.1.1 Performance evaluation of waveform
Evaluation cases, i.e., Case 3 and 4, and performance metrics for the uplink
are described in subclause 7.1.1. General evaluation assumptions are provided
in Annex. A.1.
Evaluation observations for the uplink are summarized as below.
\- Some evaluations in RAN1 show that Y for a NR carrier can be up to 98% of
the evaluated channel bandwidths for both DL and UL without complexity and
latency constraints [R1-166093]
\- For in-band frequency multiplexing of different numerologies, it is
expected that spectrum confinement on sub-band basis is specified as
requirements on transmitter side in-band emission and EVM requirements and
reception performance in presence of other-subband interferer.
\- From RAN1 perspective, spectral confinement technique(s) (e.g. filtering,
windowing, etc.) for a waveform at the transmitter is transparent to the
receiver.
### 9.1.2 Performance evaluation of multiple access
Evaluation cases and performance metrics for the uplink are followed by those
for the downlink described in subclause 7.1.2. For link level simulation, the
following evaluation metrics are considered.
\- BLER vs SNR reported for UL and DL calibration
\- BS and UE receiver complexity reported
\- Sum throughput v.s. SNR at given BLER level under different overloading
factor.
\- Overload factor is defined as
\- For spreading case: number of data layers (users) / spreading length
(number of REs)
\- For non-spreading case: number of data layers (users) on each RE
\- Link budget (MCL with specific data rate)
For system level simulation, the same evaluation metrics described in
subclause 9.1.2 are applicable. General evaluation assumptions are provided in
Annex. A.1. For the SLS evaluation for grant-free UL multiple access schemes
applied to mMTC, packet drop rate vs. packet arrival rate per cell curve is
used, where grant-free UL multiple access schemes has the following
characteristics
\- A transmission from UE does not need the dynamic and explicit scheduling
grant from eNB
\- Multiple UEs can share the same time and frequency resources
and packet drop rate is defined as (Number of packet in outage) / (number of
generated packets), where a packet is in outage if this packet failed to be
successfully received by destination receiver beyond "Packet dropping timer"
The UL traffic model to use for evaluation of grant-free UL multiple access
applied to mMTC is also shown in Annex A.2.
A MA physical resource for "grant-free" UL transmission is comprised of a
time-frequency block. Note that spatial dimension is not considered as a
physical resource in this context. A MA resource is comprised of a MA physical
resource and a MA signature, where a MA signature includes at least one of the
following:
\- Codebook/Codeword
\- Sequence
\- Interleaver and/or mapping pattern
\- Demodulation reference signal
\- Preamble
\- Spatial-dimension
\- Power-dimension
\- Others are not precluded
The baseline multiple access scheme to assess the candidate techniques is
described in Table A.9.1.2-1.

free UL multiple access schemes.

All proposed non-orthogonal MA schemes studied for UL transmission share the
following common features:
\- At the transmitter side: using MA signature(s)
\- At the receiver side: allowing multi-user detector
All proposed non-orthogonal MA schemes for UL transmission on a high level
follow the following basic diagram as shown in Figure 9.1.2-1. Note that the
basic diagram is not intended to capture all the details or to be a complete
diagram.

evaluating various UL non-orthogonal multiple access schemes. Tables 9.1.2-4
to 9.1.2-6 provide summary of link level simulation results comparing non-

Based on the contributions and the assumptions listed in Tables 9.1.2-2 and
9.1.2-3, and evaluation results shown in Tables 9.1.2-4 to 9.1.2-6, it is
observed
\- Non-orthogonal MA, in some of the evaluated scenarios, provides significant
gain in terms of UL link-level sum throughput and overloading capability with
ideal and realistic channel estimation.
\- Some non-orthogonal MA results combined with narrowband and/or repetition
operations can reach -164 dB MCL \@160bps data rate, which meets the coverage
requirement for NR.
\- Non-orthogonal MA schemes using an advanced receiver have little or no
performance loss due to MA signature (except RS) collision.

Based on system-level simulation results and assumptions summarized in
[R1-1610531], it is observed that
\- All simulated non-orthogonal MA schemes with grant-free with advanced
receivers (some with ideal channel estimation while others with realistic
channel estimation) provide significant capacity gain in terms of packets
arrivals rate (packets/s/sector) at a given system outage (e.g, 1% target
packet drop rate), compared to a respective grant-free reference scheme
assumed by each company.
\- Evaluation simulators have been calibrated with agreed simulation
assumptions (R1-1609442)

### 9.1.3 Performance evaluation of channel coding
See subclause 7.1.3.
### 9.1.4 Performance evaluation of mobility
Evaluation cases and simulation assumptions are provided Annex A.2.3. For
mobility, the following evaluation metrics are considered.
\- Paging miss probability in RRC Connected Inactive state
\- UE power consumption in RRC Connected Inactive state
\- UE power consumption in RRC Connected Active state
Tables 9.1.4-1, 9.1.4-2 and 9.1.4-3 provide summary of evaluation results of
both DL measurement based mobility and UL measurement based mobility. In the
table, each source corresponds to the following references.
\- Source1: R1-1702595, R1-1700739, R1-1612039, R1-1610166, R1-1610167 and
R1-166393
\- Source2: R1-1703130
\- Source3: R1-1609437
\- Source4: R1-1702911, R1-1700893 and R1-1612473
\- Source5: R1-1703096, R1-1701062 and R1-1612810
Based on the evaluation results summarized in Tables 9.1.4-1, 9.1.4-2 and
9.1.4-3, the following observations were made by some sources.
\- For CONNECTED_ACTIVE state, compared to LTE DL measurement baseline with 5
ms SS (Synchronization Signal) periodicity and CRS:
\- In synchronized deployment, UL measurements can provide a handover
performance and / or potential UE power consumption gain in some scenarios,
e.g. dense deployments with low number of UE's per TRP, high speed, with a
potential cost of increased UL resource and potential NW backhaul signaling
overhead depending on NW architecture and potential reduction in over the air
signaling overhead,
\- For CONNECTED_INACTIVE state, compared to LTE DL measurement baseline with
5 ms SS (Synchronization Signal) periodicity and CRS
\- In synchronized deployment, UL measurements with synchronization signals
transmitted in SFN mode can provide a paging reliability performance and / or
UE power consumption gain in some scenarios, , e.g. dense deployments, rural
high way, with a cost of increased UL resource and potential NW backhaul
signaling overhead depending on NW architecture and potential reduction in
over the air signaling overhead.

On the other hand, if gNB receives the complaint of the interference from the other gNB, semi-static coordination would be useful.\   Not provided                         N/A

If dynamic operation is switched off, then the operation follows SIB indicated UL-DL change. Still if for same gNB, it is just implementation issue. If inter-gNB, it may need to define some new inter-gNB signaling to coordinate.

The evaluation assumptions for flexible duplex are shown in Annex A.2.1. The
detailed evaluation results are also summarized in Annex A.3.1. Based on the
evaluation results, the following observations are made.
\- Observations for indoor hotspot scenario:
\- Evaluations show that duplexing flexibility with cross-link interference
mitigation schemes and on a 4GHz and 30GHz provides better UPT compared to
static UL/DL resource partition and duplexing flexibility without cross-link
interference mitigation schemes
\- Evaluations show that duplexing flexibility without cross-link interference
mitigation schemes on a 4GHz and 30GHz provides better UPT compared to static
UL/DL resource partition at least for some cases
\- The evaluated cross-link interference mitigation schemes include sensing
based methods, advanced receivers (e.g. MMSE-IRC, EMMSE-IRC), coordinated
scheduling/beamforming, power control, link adaptation, hybrid dynamic/static
UL/DL resource assignment.
\- Additional detailed observations are provided in Table 10.1-2.
\- Observations for urban macro scenario:
\- Evaluations show that duplexing flexibility with cross-link interference
mitigation schemes on a 4GHz unpaired spectrum and on a 2GHz paired spectrum
provides better average UPT compared to static UL/DL resource partition and
duplexing flexibility without cross-link interference mitigation schemes.
\- The evaluated cross-link interference mitigation schemes include advanced
receivers (e.g. MMSE-IRC, EMMSE-IRC, packet exchange for interference
cancellation), coordinated scheduling/beamforming, power control, link
adaptation.
\- Evaluations show that duplexing flexibility on a 2GHz paired spectrum with
SRS on the DL part without dynamic DL/UL resource allocation provides better
cell average/edge throughput compared to no SRS on the DL part of the
spectrum.
\- Additional detailed observations are provided in Table 10.1-3 and Table
10.1-4.
\- Observations for dense urban scenario,
\- Evaluations show that duplexing flexibility with cross-link interference
mitigation schemes on a 4GHz and 30GHz unpaired spectrum provides better UPT
compared to static UL/DL resource partition and duplexing flexibility without
cross-link interference mitigation schemes
\- The evaluated cross-link interference mitigation schemes include advanced
receivers (e.g. MMSE-IRC, eMMSE-IRC), sensing based schemes, coordinated
scheduling/beamforming, power control, link adaptation, hybrid dynamic/static
UL/DL resource assignment.
\- Additional detailed observations are provided in Table 10.1-5.

# 11 Evaluation common for UL/DL
## 11.1 Performance evaluation related to URLLC
Evaluation metric and evaluation method for URLLC are defined as follows.
\- User plane latency:
\- Definition: Follow the definition in TR38.913, target value is 0.5ms one
way, without reliability requirement.
\- Evaluation method: Analytical; re-transmission is considered, but
scheduling / queuing delay is not included in analytical evaluation
\- Reliability
\- Definition: Reliability is defined as the success probability R of
transmitting X bits within L seconds, which is the time it takes to deliver a
small data packet from the radio protocol layer 2/3 SDU ingress point to the
radio protocol layer 2/3 SDU egress point of the radio interface, at a certain
channel quality Q (e.g., coverage-edge).
\- Denoted as R(L, Q, SE), where SE is the required spectral efficiency and
SE=X/L/B where B (in Hz) is the user bandwidth that is allocable to one
device.
\- The latency bound L includes transmission latency, processing latency,
retransmission latency and queuing/scheduling latency (including scheduling
request and grant reception if any)
\- Evaluation method: Link level simulation as start point
\- URLLC capacity and URLLC / eMBB multiplexing capacity
\- Definition: URLLC system capacity is calculated as follows:
\- C(L, R) is the maximum offered cell load under which Y% of UEs in a cell
operate with target link reliability R under L latency bound
\- X = (100 -- Y) % is the percentage of UEs in outage
\- A UE in outage is defined as the UE can not meet latency L and link
reliability R bound
\- Companies report their assumption on X
\- Evaluation method: System level evaluation method is used for URLLC system
capacity study to analyze impact from inter-cell interference, queueing and
scheduling latency, multiplexing with other services.
The corresponding evaluation assumptions are provided in Annex A.2.
## 11.2 Performance evaluation related to high speed train
The optimized azimuth beam direction should be determined by observing both DL
geometry and UL geometry. One option for antenna downtilt for high speed
scenario is to reuse the downtilt for rural scenario, i.e., 6 degrees. One
value for the optimized azimuth beam direction is 27 degrees to the railway
track. This is obtained assuming that the half power beam points to the
midpoint between the two adjacent sites along the railway.
