# Introduction
**Work has started in ITU and 3GPP to develop requirements and specifications
for new radio (NR) systems, as in the Recommendation ITU-R M.2083 "Framework
and overall objectives of the future development of IMT for 2020 and beyond",
as well as 3GPP** SA1 study item New Services and Markets Technology Enablers
(SMARTER) and SA2 study item Architecture for NR System**. 3GPP has to
identify and develop the technology components needed for successfully
standardizing the NR system timely satisfying both the urgent market needs,
and the more long-term requirements set forth by the ITU-R IMT-2020 process.
In order to achieve this, evolutions of the radio interface as well as radio
network architecture are considered in the study item "New Radio Access
Technology" [1].**

# 4 Background
This section describes the objective and the guidelines for studying the RF
and co-existence aspects for the New Radio Access Technology.
## 4.1 Study item objective
**The study aims to develop an NR access technology to meet a broad range of
use cases including enhanced mobile broadband, massive MTC, critical MTC, and
additional requirements defined during the RAN requirements study.**
**The new RAT will consider frequency ranges up to 100 GHz [TR38.913].**
**Detailed objectives of the study item are:**
(1) Target a single technical framework addressing all usage scenarios,
requirements and deployment scenarios defined in TR38.913 including
o Enhanced mobile broadband
o Massive machine-type-communications
o Ultra reliable and low latency communications
(2) The new RAT shall be inherently forward compatible
o It is assumed that the normative specification would occur in two phases:
Phase I (to be completed in June 2018) and Phase II (to be completed in
December 2019)
o Phase I specification of the new RAT must be forward compatible (in terms of
efficient co-cell/site/carrier operation) with Phase II specification and
beyond, and backward compatibility to LTE is not required
o Phase II specification of the new RAT builds on the foundation of Phase I
specification, and meets all the set requirements for the new RAT.
o Smooth future evolution beyond Phase II needs to be ensured to support later
advanced features and to enable support of service requirements identified
later than Phase II specification.
(3) Initial work of the study item should allocate high priority on gaining a
common understanding on what is required in terms of radio protocol structure
and architecture to fulfil objective 1 and 2, with focus on progressing in the
following areas
o Fundamental physical layer signal structure for new RAT
\- Waveform based on OFDM, with potential support of non-orthogonal waveform
and multiple access
\- FFS: other waveforms if they demonstrate justifiable gain
\- Basic frame structure(s)
\- Channel coding scheme(s)
o Radio interface protocol architecture and procedures
o Radio Access Network architecture, interface protocols and procedures,
Study on the above 2 bullets shall at least cover:
\- Study the feasibility of different options of splitting the architecture
into a "central unit" and a "distributed unit", with potential interface in
between, including transport, configuration and other required functional
interactions between these nodes [RAN2, RAN3];
\- Study the alternative solutions with regard to signaling, orchestration,
..., and OAM, where applicable [in co-operation with SA5];
\- Study and outline the RAN-CN interface and functional split [in co-
operation with SA2] [RAN2, RAN3];
\- Study and identify the basic structure and operation of realization of RAN
Networks functions (NFs). Study to what extent it is feasible to standardize
RAN NFs, the interfaces of RAN NFs and their interdependency [RAN3];
\- Study and identify specification impacts of enabling the realization of
Network Slicing [in co-operation with SA2] [RAN2, RAN3];
\- Study and identify additional architecture requirements e.g. support for
QoS concept, SON, support of sidelink for D2D [RAN1, RAN2, RAN3].
o Fundamental RF aspects -- especially where they may impact decisions on the
above, e.g.,
\- Study and identify the aspects related to the testability of RF and
performance requirements
(4) Study and identify the technical features necessary to enable the new
radio access to meet objective 1 and 2, also including:
o Tight interworking between the new RAT and LTE
o Interworking with non-3GPP systems
o Operation in licensed bands (paired and unpaired), and licensed assisted
operations in unlicensed bands
 [Standalone operation in unlicensed bands is FFS]
o Efficient multiplexing of traffic for different services and use cases on
the same contiguous block of spectrum
o Stand alone operation in licensed bands
Note 1: The scope of Phase I will be determined when agreeing on Phase I
WID(s).
Note 2: Stated KPI values and deployment scenarios to be aligned to scenarios
and requirement SI outcome
(5) Provide performance evaluation of the technologies identified for the new
RAT and analysis of the expected specification work
(6) Identify relevant RF parameters used to be used for sharing and co-
existence studies
(7) Study and identify technical solutions that enable support for wireless
relay

#### 5.2.2.3 O-to-I penetration loss
The Path loss incorporating O-to-I building penetration loss is modelled as in
the following:
PL = PL~b~ + PL~tw~ + PL~in~ + _N_(0, σ _~P~^2^_)
where PL~b~ is the basic outdoor path loss given in Section 5.1.2.2.1. PL~tw~
is the building penetration loss through the external wall, PL~in~ is the
inside loss dependent on the depth into the building, and σ _~P~_ is the
standard deviation for the penetration loss.
PL~tw~ is characterized as:
is an additional loss is added to the external wall loss to account for non-
perpendicular incidence;
, is the penetration loss of material _i_ , example values of which can be
found in Table 5.2.2.3-1.
_p~i~_ is proportion of _i_ -th materials, where ; and
_N_ is the number of materials.
Table 5.2.2.3-1: Material penetration losses

Standard multi-pane glass $$L_{\text{glass}} = 2 + 0.2 \cdot f$$ IRR glass
$$L_{\text{IRRglass}} = 23 + 0.3 \cdot f$$ Concrete $$L_{\text{concrete}} = 5
+ 4 \cdot f$$ Wood $$L_{\text{wood}} = 4.85 + 0.12 \cdot f$$ Note: f is in GHz
Table 5.2.2.3-2 gives PL~tw~, PL~in~ and σ _~P~_ for two O-to-I penetration
loss models. The O-to-I penetration is UT-specifically generated, and is added
to the SF realization in the log domain.

\right)$$ 0.5 _d_ ~2D-in~ 4.4 High-loss model $$5 - 10\log_{10}\left( 0.7

\frac{L_{\text{concrete}}}{10}} \right)$$ 0.5 _d_ ~2D-in~ 6.5
_d~2D~-~in~_ is minimum of two independently generated uniformly distributed
variables between 0 and 25 m for RMa, UMa and UMi-Street Canyon. _d~2D~-~in~_
shall be UT-specifically generated.
Both low-loss and high-loss models are applicable to UMa and UMi-Street
Canyon.
Only the low-loss model is applicable to RMa.
The composition of low and high loss is a simulation parameter that should be
determined by the user of the channel models, and is dependent on the use of
metal-coated glass in buildings and the deployment scenarios. Such use is
expected to differ in different markets and regions of the world and also may
increase over years to new regulations and energy saving initiatives.
Furthermore, the use of such high-loss glass currently appears to be more
predominant in commercial buildings than in residential buildings in some
regions of the world.
The pathloss incorporating O-to-I car penetration loss is modelled as in the
following:
PL = PL~b~ + _N_(_μ_ , σ _~P~^2^_)
where PL~b~ is the basic outdoor path loss given in Section 7.4.1. _μ_ = 9,
and σ _~P~_ = 5. Optionally, for metallized car windows, _μ_ = 20 can be used.
The O-to-I car penetration loss models are applicable for at least 0.6-60 GHz.
### 5.2.3 Antenna and beam forming pattern modelling
#### 5.2.3.1 General
A general antenna model is a uniform rectangular panel array, comprising
M~g~N~g~ panels, as illustrated in Figure 5.2.3.1-1.
\- M~g~ is number of panels in a column
\- N~g~ is number of panels in a row
\- Antenna panels are uniformly spaced in the horizontal direction with a
spacing of _d~g,H~_ and in the vertical direction with a spacing of _d~g,V~_.
\- On each antenna panel, antenna elements are placed in the vertical and
horizontal direction, where N is the number of columns, M is the number of
antenna elements with the same polarization in each column.
\- Antenna numbering on the panel illustrated in Figure 5.2.3.1-1 assumes
observation of the antenna array from the front (with x-axis pointing towards
broad-side and increasing y-coordinate for increasing column number).
\- The antenna elements are uniformly spaced in the horizontal direction with
a spacing of _d~H~_ and in the vertical direction with a spacing of _d~V~_.
\- The antenna panel is either single polarized (P=1) or dual polarized (P=2).
The rectangular panel array antenna can be described by the following tuple .
Figure 5.2.3.1-1: General antenna model
For a uniformly distributed array (ULA) antenna, as shown in Figure 5.2.3.1-2,
the radiation elements are placed uniformly along the vertical **z** -axis in
the Cartesian coordinate system. The **x-y** plane constructs the horizontal
plane. A signal acting at the array elements is in the direction of **u**. The
elevation angle of the signal direction is denoted as (defined between 0° and
180°, 90° represents perpendicular angle to the array antenna aperture) and
the azimuth angle is denoted as(defined between -180° and 180°).

Figure 5.2.3.1-2: Antenna Array Geometry
The linear phase progression based beamforming is assumed, as described in
Table 5.2.3.1-1.
Table 5.2.3.1-1: Composite antenna pattern
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Parameter | Values | +==================================+==================================+ | Composite Array radiation | For beam i: | | pattern in dB | | | | the super position vector is | | | given by: | | | | | | the weighting is given by: | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
In this simulation, there is one beam formed using all the antenna elements.
Each beam is directed to one scheduled UE.
Note the above gives the correct antenna array radiation pattern, however the
correct gain is only achived if the element pattern is selected for the exact

separately calculated such that it is correct for the element spacing (_d~g,H\
and~ d~g,V~). If_ is not linked to the element spacing then the calculated
absolute gain may diverge from the correct value in a manner that varies as
the beam is steered.

The antenna model extension was created to model AAS base station operating
within the frequency range 1710 to 4990 MHz required for sharing studies in
ITU-R.

### 5.2.4 Transmission power control model
For downlink scenario, no power control scheme is applied.
For uplink scenario, TPC model specified in Section 9.1 TR 36.942 is applied
with following parameters.
\- CL~x-ile~ = 88 + 10*log10(200/X), where X is UL transmission BW (MHz)
\- γ = 1
### 5.2.5 Received power model
The received power in downlink and uplink scenarios is defined as below:
> _RX_PWR = TX_PWR -- Path loss + G_TX + G_RX_
>
> where:
RX_PWR is the received power
TX_PWR is the transmitted power
G_TX is the transmitter antenna gain (directional array gain)
G_RX is the receiver antenna gain (directional array gain).
### 5.2.6 ACLR and ACS modeling
From the AAS study [21], in which coexistence simulation was conducted to gain
understanding of the AAS BS ACLR requirement. It was observed
"The impact of correlation level to the system coexistence is evaluated.
Simulation results in Case 1a(AAS to Legacy) and Case 1b(AAS to AAS) show that
different correlation levels have little impact on the throughput loss due to
the fact that the dominant source of adjacent channel interference is due to
UE ACS"
Note the study was done based on two key assumptions, i.e. UE antenna pattern
is omni-directional with 0dBi gain and the UE ACS level is 33dB.
With this observation, it was concluded that it is not the spatial direction
of ACLR, but the total amount of adjacent channel power radiated that matters
in the coexistence performance. Also, it is noted that the current discussion
in AAS for ACLR OTA requirement seems to indicate that TRP is the choice due
to practical difficulties in implementation and testing [22].
For the UE antenna model, if UE has some kind of beamforming capacity, i.e.
the omni-directional antenna model is no longer valid, in general the victim
UE will experience less interference. This is because the inference will most
likely come from a different direction than the wanted signal thus may
experience less beamforming gain.
Therefore, for DL it seems reasonable from the perspective of simulating worst
case scenarios that we assume BS ACLR is modeled as flat in space, and the UE
ACS can be modeled flat in space.
If this assumption is for DL, then the similar assumption could be made for
the UL because:
\- UE has a much small number of antennas, thus the effect of directivity
should be smaller for ACLR (or the adjacent channel interference). It can also
be reasonably assumed that the UE ACLR will play a dominant role than the BS
ACS in the adjacent channel interference.
\- Again, BS ACS flat in space might mean worse coexistence performance than
actual performance because BS has better capability of steering its receive
antennas to suppress interference.
It should be noted that flat ACLR assumption implies the spatial pattern of
the adjacent channel emissions is exactly the same as the spatial pattern of
the wanted signal, such that their ratio is the same. Similarly flat ACS
assumption implies that the receiver directivity pattern is the same for both
the wanted signal and the adjacent channel signal.
The assumption was made for ITU WP 5D was based on consideration of the likely
impact of the assumption on spatial pattern to co-existence performance and
not on consideration of whether the spatial pattern of unwanted emissions is
really aligned to the wanted signal. This will depend on the correlation
between unwanted emissions signals from different transmitters, which has not
as yet been investigated.
In terms of flatness in frequency, both ACLR and ACS would be flat based on
the analysis above. If a UE occupies a smaller bandwidth than the channel
bandwidth for transmission, a two stop ACLR model could be considered in
frequency to avoid overly estimating interference, as done in LTE coexistence
study [19].
Therefore, it is assumed that both ACLR (or the adjacent channel interference)
and ACS are flat in both space and frequency. The ACIR model can be express as
(assuming ACLR, ACS and ACIR to be linear)
### 5.2.7 Link level performance for 5G NR coexistence
The throughput of a modem with link adaptation can be approximated by an
attenuated and truncated form of the Shannon bound. (The Shannon bound
represents the maximum theoretical throughput than can be achieved over an
AWGN channel for a given SNIR). The following equations approximate the
throughput over a channel with a given SNIR, when using link adaptation:
$\text{Throughput\ }\left( \text{SNIR} \right),\ bps/Hz\ = \left{
\begin{matrix} 0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \

Additionally in [R4-1700053] for NR UL in-band emissions and EVM requirements
at UE TX, it was agreed that in order to enable better UL coverage for CP-OFDM
waveform RAN4 should study a possibility to define two sets of in-band
emissions and EVM requirements for NR UE Tx; more and less stringent
requirements.
With the above agreed methodology and assumptions, the detailed requirements
for both DL and UL can be further investigated.
It was agreed in [R4-168776] that
\- RAN 4 should define the Tx unit emission requirements and Rx unit
selectivity requirements in the presence of predefined interfering signals.
\- RAN 4 should define signal quality performance targets for Tx and Rx unit
testing in predefined channels, while noting the possible balancing of EVM
between Tx and Rx units.
\- Independent Tx and Rx unit requirements and corresponding test setups will
be defined in RAN4
### 6.1.9 Common issues for mmWave
#### 6.1.9.1 PA efficiency in relation to unwanted emission for mm-wave
technologies
Radio Frequency (RF) building block performance generally degrades with
increasing frequency. The power capability of power amplifiers for a given
integrated circuit technology roughly degrades by 20 dB per decade, as shown
in Figure 6.1.9.1-1. There is a fundamental cause for this degradation;
increased power capability and increased frequency capability are conflicting
requirements as observed from the so-called Johnson limit. In short, higher
operational frequencies require smaller geometries, which subsequently result
in lower operational power in order to prevent dielectric breakdown from the
increased field strengths. Moore's Law does not favor power capability
performance.
A remedy is however found in the choice of integrated circuit material. Mm-
wave integrated circuits have traditionally been manufactured using so called
III-V materials, i.e. a combination of elements from groups III and V of the
periodic table, such as Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) and more recently Gallium
Nitride (GaN). Integrated circuit technologies based on III-V materials are
substantially more expensive than conventional silicon-based technologies and
they cannot handle the integration complexity of e.g. digital circuits or
radio modems for cellular handsets. Nevertheless, GaN-based technologies are
now maturing rapidly and deliver power levels an order of magnitude higher
compared to conventional technologies.
{width="3.388888888888889in" height="2.8055555555555554in"}
Figure 6.1.9.1-1: Power amplifier output power versus frequency for various
semiconductor technologies. The dashed line illustrates the observed reduction
in power capability versus frequency (-20 dB per decade).
There are mainly three semiconductor material parameters that affect the
efficiency of an amplifier: the maximum operating voltage, maximum operating
current density and knee-voltage. Due to the knee-voltage, the maximum
attainable efficiency is reduced by a factor proportional to:
$\frac{1 - k}{1 + k}$
Where _k_ is the knee-voltage to the maximum operating voltage ratio. For most
transistor technologies the ratio _k_ is in the range of 0.05 to 0.01,
resulting in an efficiency degradation of 10% to 20%.
Figure 6.1.9.1-2 shows the saturated power added efficiency (PAE) as function
of frequency. The maximum reported PAE is about 40% and 25% at 30 GHz and 77
GHz, respectively.
PAE is expressed as PAE = 100*{[P~OUT~]~RF~ -- [P~IN~]~RF~} / [P~DC~]~TOTAL~ .

Figure 6.1.9.1-2: Saturated power added efficiency versus frequency for
various semiconductor technologies. The data points are taken from published
microwave and mm-wave power amplifier circuits.
At mm-wave frequencies the available output power is fundamentally limited by
semiconductor technologies. Furthermore, the efficiency is also degraded with
frequency.
Considering the PAE characteristics in Figure 6.1.9.1-2, and the non-linear
behavior of the AM-AM/AM-PM characteristics of the power amplifier,
significant power back-off would be necessary to reach certain linearity
requirement such as ACLR. Considering the heat dissipation aspects and
significantly reduced area/volume for mm-wave products, the complex
interrelation between linearity, PAE and output power in the light of heat
dissipation should be considered.
#### 6.1.9.2 Noise figure, dynamic range and bandwidth dependencies for mm-
wave technologies
The dynamic range (DR) of a cellular receiver will in general be limited by
the front-end insertion loss (IL), the receiver (RX) LNA and the ADC noise and
linearity properties.
Typically DRLNA ≫ DRADC so the RX use AGC and selectivity (distributed) in-
between the LNA and the ADC to optimize the mapping of the wanted signal and
the interference to the DRADC. For simplicity only a fixed gain setting is
considered here. This example in Figure 6.1.9.2-1 shows a TDD implementation

##### 6.1.9.2.1 Noise figure model
A simplified receiver model can be derived by lumping the FE, RX and ADC into
three cascaded blocks. This model cannot replace a rigorous analysis but will
show the main parameter inter dependencies.
{width="4.736111111111111in" height="1.25in"}
Figure 6.1.9.2.1-1: A simplified receiver model
Focusing on the small signal co-channel noise floor, the impact of various
signal and linearity impairments can be studied to arrive at simple noise
factor, or noise figure, expression.
##### 6.1.9.2.2 Noise factor and noise floor
Assuming matched conditions Friis' formula can be used to find the noise
factor at the receiver input as (linear units unless noted), FRX = 1+(FLNA
−1)+(FADC −1)/G.
The RX input referred small-signal co-channel noise floor will then be equal
to
NRX =FLNA·N0+NADC/G,
where N0 = k · T · BW and NADC are the available noise power and the ADC
effective noise floor in the channel bandwidth, respectively (k and T being
Boltzmann's constant and absolute temperature, respectively). The ADC noise
floor is typically set by a combination of quantization, thermal and
intermodulation noise, but here we just assume a flat noise floor as defined
by the ADC effective number of bits (SINAD = 3/2·22·ENOB).
The effective gain from LNA input to ADC input, (G) depends on small-signal
gain, AGC setting, selectivity and desensitization (saturation), but here it
is assumed that the gain is set such that the antenna referred input
compression point (CPi) corresponds to the ADC clipping level, i.e. the ADC
full scale input voltage (VFS).
For weak nonlinearities, there is a direct mathematical relation between CP
(1dB compression point) and the third-order intercept point (IP3) such that
IP3 ≈ CP + 10 dB. For higher-order nonlinearities, the difference can be
larger than 10 dB, but then CP is still a good estimate of the maximum signal
level while inter-modulation for lower signal levels may be overestimated.
##### 6.1.9.2.3 1dB Compression point and gain
Between the antenna and the RX we have the FE with its associated insertion
loss (IL>1), e.g. due to a T/R switch, a possible RF filter, and PCB/substrate
losses. These losses have to be accounted for in the gain and noise
expressions. Knowing IL, the CPi can be found that corresponds to the ADC
clipping as
CPi = IL·NADC ·DRADC/G.
The antenna referred noise factor and noise figure will then become
Fi = IL·FRX = IL·FLNA+CPi/(N0 ·DRADC), and, NFi = 10· log10(Fi), respectively.
When comparing two designs, e.g. at 2 and \~30 GHz, respectively, the \~30 GHz
IL will be significantly higher than that of the 2GHz. From the Fi expression
it can be seen that to maintain the same noise figure (NFi) for the two
carrier frequencies, we need to compensate the higher FE loss at \~30 GHz by
improving the RX noise factor. This can be accomplished (i) by using a better
LNA (ii) by relaxing the input compression point, i.e. increasing G, or (iii)
by increasing the DRADC. Usually a good LNA is already used at 2GHz to achieve
a low NFi so this option is rarely possible. Relaxing CPi is an option but
this will reduce IP3 and linearity performance will degrade. Finally,
increasing DRADC comes at a power consumption penalty (4× per extra bit).
Especially wideband ADCs may have a high power consumption, i.e. when BW is
below some 100 MHz the N0 · DRADC product (i.e. BW · DRADC ) is proportional
to the ADC power consumption, but for higher bandwidths the ADC power
consumption is proportional to BW 2 · DRADC , penalizing higher BW, see the
ADC section. Increasing DRADC is typically not an attractive option and it is
inevitable that the \~30 GHz receiver will have a significantly higher NFi
than that of the 2GHz receiver.
#### 6.1.9.3 Filtering aspect for mm-wave technologies
Various types of filters have been deployed in 3GPP based BS and UE
implementations below 6 GHz. The filters mitigated the unwanted emissions
arising from e.g. non-linearity in the transmitters generated due to
intermodulation, harmonics generation etc. In the receiver chain filters where
deployed to handle either own transmitter in paired bands or suppress the
interferer at adjacent or other frequencies.
The requirements have also been differentiated in terms of levels e.g. for
spurious emission, general, co-existence in the same geographical areas and
co-location has been specified while the requirement levels for in-band to
out-of-band has also been considered by exclusion zones defining e.g. the in-
band and spurious emission domain respectively.
For mm-wave frequencies depending on the waveform design and OFDM numerology,
different modulation spectrums affecting the filtering and size of the
exclusion zones should be considered.
Considering the limited size (area/volume) and level of integrations needed
for mm-wave frequencies, the filtering can be challenging where discrete mm-
wave filters are far too bulky to be fitted in limited size as well as the
challenge it poses to embed such filter into highly integrated structures for
mm-wave products.
It is worth mentioning here that, the above mentioned issues can become
challenging (or even prohibitive) especially for UE implementation for
operation in mmwave spectrum.
##### 6.1.9.3.1 Possibilities of filtering in the analogue front-end
Different implementations provide different possibilities for filtering. The
implementations can be roughly distinguished between two main cases:
\- Low-cost, monolithic integration with one or a few multi-chain CMOS/BiCMOS
core-chip with built-in power amplifiers and built in down-converters. This
case will give limited possibilities to include high performance filters along
the RF-chains since the Q-values in on chip filter resonators will be poor
(5-20).
\- High performance, heterogeneous integration with several CMOS/BiCMOS core
chips, combined with external amplifiers and external mixers. This
implementation allows the inclusion of external filters along the RF-chains
(at a higher complexity, size, and power consumption).
There are at least three places where it makes sense to put filters, depending
on implementation:
\- Behind or inside the antenna element (F1 or F0), where loss, size, cost and
wide-band suppression is important.
\- Behind the first amplifiers (looking from the antenna side), where low loss
is less critical (F2).
\- On the high frequency side of mixers (F3), where signals have been combined
(in the case of analogue and hybrid beam forming).

Figure 6.1.9.3.1-1: Possible filter placements
The main purpose of F1/F0 is to suppress interference and emissions far from
the desired channel across a wide frequency range (e.g. DC-60 GHz). There
should not be any un-intentional resonances or passbands in this wide
frequency range. This filter will help relax the design challenge (bandwidth
to consider in optimizations, and linearity requirements) of all following
blocks. Insertion loss must be very low, and there is a strict size and cost
requirements since there possibly will be one filter at each sub-array.
{width="3.1458333333333335in" height="1.8888888888888888in"}
Figure 6.1.9.3.1-2: Filter example
The main purpose of F2 would be to suppress LO leakage and unwanted mixing
products, and it will also add image rejection and rejection of general
interference a few channels away from the carrier. There are still strict size
requirements, but more loss can be accepted (behind the amplifiers) and also
un-intentional passbands (since F1/F0 will handle that). This enables better
frequency precision (half-wave resonators) and better discrimination (more
poles).
The main purpose of F3 would be to suppress LO leakage and unwanted mixing
products, but there is also a possibility to obtain suppression in
neighbouring channels, to protect mixer and ADC. For analogue (or hybrid)
beam-forming it is enough to have just one (or a few) such filter(s). This
relaxes requirements on size and cost, which opens the possibility to achieve
high Q and high precision.
The deeper in the RF-chain the filtering is placed (starting from the antenna
element) the better protected the circuits will get.
For the monolithic integration case it is difficult to implement filters F2
and F3. One can expect performance penalties for this case. In addition,
output power is typically lower.
In addition, the shielding to achieve isolation over high frequency range can
be challenging, as microwaves have a tendency to bypass filters by propagating
in ground structures around them.
##### 6.1.9.3.2 Insertion loss (IL) and bandwidth
Sharp filtering on each branch (at positions F1/F0) with narrow bandwidth
leads to excessive loss at microwave and mm-wave frequencies. To get the
insertion loss down to a reasonable level one the passband can be made
significantly larger than the signal bandwidth. A drawback of such an approach
is that several unwanted neighbouring wideband channels will pass the filter.
In choosing the best loss-bandwidth trade-off there are some basic
dependencies to be aware of:
> IL increases with increasing fc (for fixed BW).
>
> IL decreases with increasing Q.
>
> IL increases with increasing N.
To exemplify the trade-off we study a 3-pole LC-filter with Q=20, 100, 500 and
5000, for 100 and 800 MHz 3dB-bandwidth, tuned to 15 dB equal ripple (with
Q=5000) is examined in Figure 6.1.9.3.2-1.
{width="2.1875in" height="2.2083333333333335in"} {width="3.8541666666666665in"
height="2.2847222222222223in"}
Figure 6.1.9.3.2-1: Example 3-pole LC filter with 800 and 4x800 MHz bandwidth,
for different Q value
From this study it is observed that:
\- 800 MHz bandwidth or smaller, requires exotic filter technologies, with a
Q-value around 500 or better to get an IL below 1.5 dB. Such Q-values are very
challenging to achieve considering constraints on size and cost.
\- By relaxing the requirement on selectivity to 4x800 MHz, it is sufficient
to have a Q-value around 100 to get 2 dB IL. This should be within reach with
a low-loss, PCB. The margin in terms of bandwidth will help to accommodate
typical production tolerances of the PCB.
#### 6.1.9.4 Carrier frequency and mm-wave technology aspects
Designing a receiver at, e.g., \~30 GHz with a 1 GHz signal bandwidth leaves
much less design margin than what would be the case for a 2 GHz carrier with
e.g. 50 MHz signal bandwidth as the IC technology speed is similar in both
cases but the design margin and performance depends on the technology being
much faster than the required signal processing.
The free space wavelength at \~30 GHz is only 1 cm which is one tenth of what
we are used to from existing 3GPP bands below 6 GHz. Antenna size and path
loss are related to wavelength and carrier frequency, and to compensate the
small physical size of a single antenna element we will have to use multiple
antennas, e.g. array antennas. Then, when beam forming is used the spacing
between antenna elements will still be related to the wavelength constraining
the size of the FE and RX. Some of the implications of these frequency and
size constraints are:
\- The ratios ft/fcarrier and fmax/fcarrier, where ft is the transistor
transit frequency (i.e. when the RF device´s current gain is 0 dB), and where
fmax is the maximum frequency of oscillation (i.e. when the extrapolated power
gain is 0 dB), will be much lower at millimeter wave frequencies than for
below 6 GHz applications. As receiver gain drops with operating frequency when
this ratio is less than some 10 − 100×, the available gain at millimeter waves
will be lower and consequently the device noise factor Fi higher (similar as
if Friis' formula was applied to a transistor's internal noise sources).
\- The breakdown voltage of active devices is inversely proportional to the
maximum speed of the device due to the Johnson limit. I.e. vsat · Ebr = const.
or fmax · Vdd = const. As a consequence the supply voltage will be lower for
millimeter-wave devices compared to low GHz ones. This will limit the CPi and
the maximum available dynamic range.
\- Higher level of transceiver integration is required to save space, either
as System-On-Chip or System-In-Package. This will limit the number of
technologies suitable for the RF transceiver and limit FRX .
\- RF filters will have to be placed close to the antenna elements and fit
into the array antenna. Consequently they have to be small, resulting in
higher physical tolerance requirements, possibly at the cost of insertion loss
and stop-band attenuation. That is, IL and selectivity gets worse.
Increasing the carrier frequency, fcarrier from, say 2 GHz to \~30 GHz (i.e.
>10×) has a significant impact on the circuit design and its RF performance.
For example, modern high-speed CMOS devices are velocity saturated and their
maximum operating frequency is inversely proportional to the minimum channel
length, or feature size. This dimension halves roughly every four years, as
per Moore's law (stating that complexity, i.e. transistor density, doubles
every other year). With smaller feature sizes internal voltages must also be
lowered to limit electrical fields to safe levels. Thus, designing a 30 GHz RF
receiver corresponds to designing a 2 GHz receiver using about 15 years old
low-voltage technology (i.e. today's breakdown voltage but 15 years old ft,
see figure based on ITRS device targets). With such a mismatch in device
performance and design margin it is not to be expected to maintain 2GHz
performance and power consumption at 30 GHz.
The signal bandwidth at mm-wave frequencies will also be significantly higher
than at, say, 2GHz. For an active device, or circuit, the signal swing is
limited by the supply voltage at one end and by thermal noise at the other.
The available thermal noise power of a device is proportional to BW/g~m~,
where g~m~ is the intrinsic device gain (trans-conductance). As g~m~ is
proportional to bias current we can see that the dynamic range then becomes
the ratio
DR ∝ Vdd^2^ ·Ibias/BW = Vdd ·P/BW, or
P ∝ BW·DR/ Vdd
Where P is the power dissipation.
Receivers for mm-wave frequencies will have increased power consumption due to
higher BW, aggravated by the low-voltage technology needed for speed, compared
to typical 2GHz receivers.
Thus, considering the thermal challenges given the significantly reduced
area/volume for mm-wave products, the complex interrelation between linearity,
NF, bandwidth and dynamic range in the light of power dissipation should be
considered.
#### 6.1.9.5 Phase noise for mm-wave frequencies
Phase noise is quite an important parameter in relation to mm-wave
technologies considering the choice of sub-carrier spacing and achievable
signal quality. As the sub-carrier spacing for mm-wave frequencies is not
settled, it is important to consider achievable values for the mm-wave
frequency ranges due to phase noise frequency dependencies.
Considering the VCO and PLL (to suppress the phase noise) performance and
limitations for mm-wave frequencies for different technologies, some general
limitations are given below:
1\. PN could increase by 6 dB every time when _f~0~_ doubles (assuming FoM and
other things do not change)
2\. PN is inversely proportional to the square of the loaded quality factor of
the resonator, Q
3\. 1/f noise up-conversion gives rise to close-to-carrier PN increase (small
offset)
#### 6.1.9.6 LO generation and distribution
Array antenna transceivers may be based on different strategies in
implementation of local oscillator (LO) signal generation and distribution.
Put simply, there are two options:
1\. Centralized LO generation with a single PLL for all transceivers
2\. Distributed LO generation with one PLL per transceiver.
These are two extreme cases and one could of course envision a combination of
the two such that the transceivers are grouped together and where the
transceivers within each group shares a common LO generation, i.e. semi-
distributed LO generation.
This aspect has not been very much addressed before, rather a single
centralized LO generation has been assumed and this leads to low phase noise
performance in turn increasing EVM and pushing required sub-carrier spacing
upwards. The LO generation strategy thus needs more attentation.
The phase noise performance might affect the receiver requirement in a
different manner compared to the transmitter which also needs to be
considered.
##### 6.1.9.6.1 Centralized LO generation
With a centralized PLL the phase noise as seen by respective transceiver will
be essentially the same, i.e. fully correlated. The primary downside of this
solution is that the performance requirements on the PLL will be high and that
the distribution of the LO signal over the array of transceivers will be very
power consuming as the LO signal integrity must be maintained over long
distances of distribution on chip. The latter aspect may partly be alleviated
somewhat by distributing a sub-harmonic (1/N) of the target LO frequency and
use transceiver-localized frequency multipliers (xN) to generate the target LO
frequency. This solution is however suffers from sub-harmonic responses as the
frequency multiplier output will not only output the desired frequency but
will also contain some residuals of its input and harmonics thereof. This in
turn will impact spurious emission and spurious response behavior.
##### 6.1.9.6.2 Distributed LO generation
With distributed LO generation the phase noise as seen by respective
transceiver will be partially uncorrelated. This is beneficial from an EVM
perspective as the phase noise induced EVM is improved by 10log(M) where M is
the number of transceivers (and associated PLLs). This may be used to lower
the phase noise requirements on the PLLs. Instead of distributing the LO
signal only the low-frequency reference to respective PLL needs to be
distributed. The downside is primarily increased circuit complexity while the
power consumption can be kept low by low phase noise requirements and no need
for high frequency LO distribution.
##### 6.1.9.6.3 Semi-distributed LO generation
With a semi-distributed LO generation the phase noise as seen by respective
transceiver will be partially uncorrelated between groups of transceivers and
fully correlated within the group. Thus, there is still a benefit from an EVM
perspective but the phase noise induced EVM is now only improved by 10log(P)
where P is the number of transceiver groups. Within each group the LO signal
still needs to be distributed to respective transceiver but the distances and
associated power become significantly smaller compared to the centralized LO
generation while the phase noise requirements on the PLLs will be moderate.
### 6.1.10 Example 1: 30 GHz SSB phase noise model
In sub-clause 6.1.10 and 6.1.11 two example phase noise models are presented.
The first example (in this subclause) is based upon measurements made on a
prototype CMOS device, with a larger PLL bandwidth. The second example (in
subclause 6.1.11) is based on recent research on technology capabilities,
considers CMOS for the UE but GaAs for the BS and assumes a lower PLL
bandwidth than the first example.
The phase noise model presented in this sub-clause is based on measurements of
a research prototype receiver designed in a 28nm FD-SOI CMOS process. The PLL
within this receiver has been designed for distributed LO generation [2] and
since the number of PLLs will be large (\~number of sub-arrays) power
consumption is of utmost importance. In fact, the power consumption of this
PLL is around 20mW (the XO with buffers adds another 2.5mW) therefore making
it suitable also for UE performance considerations. A high frequency XO is
used to reduce the impact from the $20\log{(\frac{f_{o}}{f_{\text{xo}}})}\
$_20log(f~0~/f~xo~)_ phase noise upconversion but also allows a larger PLL
bandwidth, which in turn reduce the VCO phase noise contribution. The PLL
operates at a frequency of 2/3 the carrier frequency (29.55 GHz for this
particular measurement) as it is used in a sliding IF receiver architecture
(two-step down-conversion) as outlined in Figure 6.1.10-1. The sliding IF
technique is a well-known receiver architecture. However, the models presented
here are by no means to be viewed as limited by this receiver
architecture**.**
Figure 6.1.10-1: Simplified receiver architecture view and phase noise
measurement setup
The phase noise measurements have been performed through the receiver by
applying a receiver input CW at 770MHz offset from the carrier frequency of
29.55 GHz and measuring the phase noise of the CW at the baseband output of
the receiver. Thus, the phase noise measured will not be that of the PLL
output itself but the effective phase noise in downconverting from 29.55 GHz
to baseband.
The phase noise model used here is a generalization of the multi-pole/zero
model extended to fractional orders and is given by:
$S\left( f_{o} \right) = PSD0\frac{\prod_{n = 1}^{N}{1 +
{(\frac{f_{o}}{f_{z,n}})}^{\alpha_{z,n}}}}{\prod_{m = 1}^{M}{1 +
{(\frac{f_{o}}{f_{p,m}})}^{\alpha_{p,m}}}}$
The measured phase noise and corresponding fractional order model is shown in
Figure 6.1.10-2 with the associated model parameters as listed in Table
6.1.10-1. The offset range of the measurement is 100 Hz to 400MHz. At 400 MHz
the phase noise floor has not yet been reached. Therefore the model parameters
have been set conservatively such that the noise floor levels out at
approximately -140dBc/Hz.

#### 6.1.10.1 Example 1: 45 GHz and 70 GHz SSB phase noise models
The 29.55 GHz model described above is used to derive models for 45 GHz and 70
GHz based on scaling with respect to frequency as discussed below. We may
assume that the reference frequency will not increase and thus the PLL loop
bandwidth will not change either. Therefore the reference and PLL phase noise
contributions to a first order approximation will scale as
20log(_f~c~/f~xo~_)$20\log{(f_{c}/f_{\text{xo}})}$. Similarily, the VCO phase
noise scales as 20log(_f~c~_)$20\log\left( f_{c} \right)$ but only if we
assume that the attainable VCO Figure-of-Merit (FoM) is frequency agnostic.
The FoM does however degrade somewhat for increasing frequencies as shown in
Figure 6.1.10.1-1, which shows FoM v.s oscillation frequency _f~0~_ for a
number of published VCOs. The FoM envelope indicated by the dashed line
(showing the trend of the best VCOs) has a 9dB per decade slope and will be
used below to derive parameters for phase noise models at 45 GHz and 70GHz.

Figure 6.1.10.1-1: FoM for various published VCOs vs. frequency implemented in
CMOS and SiGe technologies
The step from 29.55 GHz to {45,70} GHz corresponds to {0.18,0.38} decades and
the corresponding phase noise degradations are listed in Table 6.1.10.1-1. The
20log( ) degradation is an overall degradation for the phase noise
characteristics except for the high frequency noise floor region that is
assumed to be constant. The FoM degradation, however, only affects the VCO
contribution (the -20dB/decade slope starting at an offset of a few MHz).

In the following the degradations listed in Table 6.1.10.1-1 have been applied
to the original 29.55 GHz model in Figure 6.1.10-2. An accurate application of
the FoM degradation would require the VCO phase noise contribution to be
separated from other contributions followed by a redesign of the PLL
characteristics. Here, a pragmatic approach is used where the parameters have
been altered as follows First, _PSD0_ $PSD0$ is increased by the 20log( )
$20\log{\left( \bullet \right)\ }$degradation according to Table 6.1.10.1-1.
Secondly, parameters $f_{z,n},\alpha_{z,n},f_{p,m}{,\alpha}_{p,m}$**_f~z,n~
α~z,n~ f~p,m~ α~p,m\ ~_** are altered to obtain specified VCO FoM degradation
at 30MHz offset while maintaining a constant phase noise of -140dBc/Hz at
large offset and at the hump around 1.55MHz offset. The resulting models are
shown in Figure 6.1.10.1-2. with parameters listed in Table 6.1.10.1-2 and
6.1.10.1-3 for 45 GHz and 70 GHz, respectively.

#### 6.1.11.1 Fabrication Methods and Materials
While there are many different fabrication methods, the most common
fabrication materials are CMOS, GaAs, SiGe and GaN. With a review of the state
of the art, a summary on the phase noise level achieved by different
fabrication methods and materials is given in 6.11-1. From this it can be seen
that:
> _Observation: For 30GHz band, the typical phase noise level measured at 1
> MHz offset is from -114 to -93 dBc/Hz, while that for 70 GHz band is from
> -108 to -81 dBc/Hz._
While GaAs-based devices can provide a lower phase noise level, it is still
expensive and power-consuming. The CMOS-based devices are available at lower
cost and have less power consumption. Taking the cost and power constraint at
the UE side into consideration, it appears reasonable to assume CMOS-based
design for the UE side. For the BS, depending on the BS class, architecture
etc. GaAs may be considered as the performance gains may outweight the power
consumption/cost.

different fabrication methods and materials
#### 6.1.11.2 Proposed Model and Parameters
In this subclause, we utilize the PLL-based phase noise model to express the
phase noise. To be specific, the PSD of the phase noise is characterized by:
$S_{\text{Total}}\left( f \right) = \left{ \begin{matrix} S_{\text{Ref}}\left(
f \right) + S_{\text{PLL}}\left( f \right),\ \ \ \text{when}\ f \leq
\text{loop}\ \text{BW} \ S_{\text{VCO}_\ v2}\left( f \right) + S_{\text{VCO}_
v3}(f),\text{\ \ \ \ when}\ f > \text{loop}\ \text{BW} \ \end{matrix} \right.\
$ (6.1.11.2-1)
where
$S_{\text{Ref\ /\ PLL\ /\ VCO_v2\ /\ VCO_v3}} = \ \text{PSD}0 \bullet
\left\lbrack \frac{1 + \left( \frac{f}{f_{z}} \right)^{k}}{1 + f^{k}}
\right\rbrack$ (dB) (6.1.11.2-2)
$\text{PSD}0 = \text{FOM} + 20\log f_{c} - 10\log\left( \frac{P}{1\ \text{mW}}
\right)$$PSD0 = FOM + 20\log f_{c} - 10\log\left( \frac{P}{1\ mW} \right)$
(dB) (6.1.11.2-3)
FOM is the figure of merit, $f_{c}$_f~c~_ is the carrier frequency and _P_ is
the consumed power. Considering the expectation for the phase noise level
achievable with reasonable cost and power consumption as presented above, in
this example the following parameters are suggested for the phase noise model
at the UE (CMOS-based) and BS (GaAs-based) side, respectively (see 6.1.11-1).
The PSD of the proposed phase noise models at both UE and BS side for 30 GHz
are depicted in Figure 6.1.11.2-1.

#### 6.2.1.1 UE antenna arrangement and feasibility of UE beamforming
In this sub-section we consider the number of TX antennas and the PA
architecture that should be assumed for setting relevant UE transmitter
requirements. Multiple UE transmitter antennas make possible UL beamforming
and we consider its potential performance for devising a suitable antenna
arrangement for UE reference architecture(s) to be used for setting UE
transmitter requirements.
6.2.1.1.1 Multiple antennas at mmW frequencies
UE implementation of multiple antennas is feasible if the device is large
compared to the wavelength. Already today 4RX antenna ports are specified for
LTE and are considered feasible for high bands in typical UE form factors
(e.g. above 1.7 GHz), although some form factors could support more than two
ports also at lower frequencies.
Devices are large in terms of wavelengths if used in potential NR bands above
24 GHz:
\- Due to design constraints antenna elements get more directive compared to
around 2 GHz;
\- a single element will not offer sufficient omnidirectional coverage;
\- the use of multiple elements with beam patterns pointing in different
directions and with different polarizations will improve link budget and offer
omnidirectional coverage.
Moreover, distributed PAs are likely to be used since the losses by the feeder
networks will be reduced, and integration of radio and antennas is likely so
UL/DL coherency within the RFIC can probably be achieved with sufficient
accuracy (CSI acquisition relies on coherency).
6.2.1.1.2 Number of UE antennas
While the coexistence studies consider an UE antenna arrangement of 32
patches, a more realistic number of antenna elements for implementation is 8
or up to 16, at least around 30 GHz. This is also considering that the UE must
also accommodate antennas for LTE.
One example of a possible arrangement is shown in Figure 6.2.1.1.2-1 with the
mmW antennas arranged in groups, the LTE antennas and NR antennas for below 6
GHz operation are arranged at the bottom of the device. Other arrangements are
also possible. 8 or possibly 16 mmW elments is more realistic than 32 elements
at 30 GHz considering typical UE form factors.

Figure 6.2.1.1.2-1: antenna arrangement on the UE with groups of mmWave
antennas.
For the assessment of the performance of UE beamforming below we consider 4 or
8 antennas in an array arrangement as shown in Figure 6.2.1.1.2-2
{width="3.9791666666666665in" height="2.4027777777777777in"}
Figure 6.2.1.1.2-2: antenna arrangement on the UE used for the evaluation of
beamforming gain.
In rel-15 NR SI phase, 3GPP RAN consider both standalone 5G UE type and LTE +
mmWave (NSA) 5G UE type. Basically, shared antenna RF architectures are
considered LTE + sub-6GHz 5R UE RF architecture.
However, 5G NR non-stand-alone (NSA) UE to support both LTE service and mmWave
NR service is quite different RF architecture compare to legacy LTE-A UE.
Currently, 5G NSA UE architecture considered that have two different baseband
modem chips, one is for LTE or 5G sub-6GHz NR system and the other is for 5G
mmWave NR system. So these two modems have connected different RFICs in a
typical UE form factors.
Figure 6.2.1.1.2-3 shows the 5G NR stand-alone UE RF architecture according to
the antenna type.
One candidate RF architecture is antenna packaged within RFIC and the other
candidate RF architecture is separated RFIC and external antenna type as shown
in Figure 6.2.1.1.2-3.

(b) External antenna RF architecture
Figure 6.2.1.1.2-3: Candidate Stand-alone 5G mmWave RF architectures
Based on the UE design flexibility and optimal antenna performance aspect,
RAN4 should consider two candidate RF architectures for 5G mmWave NR UE.
6.2.1.1.3 PA architecture
The distributed resource is more likely at mm-wave frequencies with the PA
closer to the antenna to reduce feeder losses rather than a common PA shown in
Figure 6.2.1.1.3-1. Antenna precoders with constant modulus are designed with
the architecture in mind.
{width="4.388888888888889in" height="1.625in"}
Figure 6.2.1.1.3-1: PA arrangement with the more likely distributed
architecture on the right-hand side.
Hybrid archirectures with the "precoder" replaced by an analogue beamforming
network is also feasible around 30 GHz, e.g. 4 x 2 antenna elements or 2 x 4
antenna elements.
6.2.1.1.4 UE beamforming performance
In this sub section estimated UE beamforming performance with 4 or 8 antennas
arranged in an array as shown in Figure 6.2.1.1.2-1 is discussed. The
prerequisites of the study are described in detail in Annex D. The results are
obtained at 15 GHz but it can be expected that similar performance gains can
be observed above 24 GHz.
Various scenarios with different number of rays (directions) per channel
realization, number of blocks (fading) in frequency and antenna precoding are
considered. For the latter a channel information degeneration in terms of a
rotational and a phase error is also introduced. The former is a UE rotation
with regard to the optimal precoder configured by the channel estimation, and
modeled as normally distributed with zero mean and standard deviation per
angle of 0, 1, or 10 degrees (the UE is rotated before the optimal precoder is
used for UL transmission). The phase error is assumed to be normal distributed
with zero mean with a standard deviation of 0 (no error) or 30 degrees in the
results shown below, and is independent between all radio branches and channel
realizations.
Besides the wanted signal to the connected BS the signal received by
interfered BS is also evaluated. The precoder for the desired signal is
selected based on channel knowledge between the serving (connected) BS and the
UE, while the UL received power per antenna at the interfered BS is estimated
by a making a random channel realization (including direction of rays) towards
the interfered BS given the selected precoder for the desired signal. The
average channel gain is the same for all channel realizations allowing
relative comparison between signals received. No interference
suppression/rejection assumed at the interfered BS.
In all scenarios considered we assume two BS "beams", i.e. two orthogonal
polarizations each with a set of DL RS (two ports), while the number of UE
antennas are either 4 or 8. MRC combining is used in the BS receiver. Only
single-layer UL transmission is considered (one stream), and the codebook size
is always 32. Recall that the AOA (=AOD) of the rays at the UE is uniform
$\lbrack - 180^{{^\circ}}180^{{^\circ}}\rbrack\ $in azimuth and uniform
$\lbrack 60^{{^\circ}}\ 90^{{^\circ}}\rbrack$ in elevation as described in
Annex D. The scenarios considered are summarized in Table 6.2.1.1.4-1.
Table 6.2.1.1.4-1: scenarios

The simulation results for the scenarios in Table 6.2.1.1.4-1 are shown in
Figure 6.2.1.1.4-1 for all scenarios with 8 UE antennas and a zero-degree
phase error (but with a rotational error for each scenario as shown in the
table). The graphs show the received power level at the 50% level normalized
to the total output power of the UE (with the average channel gain of unity).
Single PMI and Multiple PMI refer to feedback-based precoding; the precoding
granularity is the same as that for the fading blocks (see Section 2 for an
explanation of the notions of reciprocity based precoding).
{width="6.111111111111111in" height="4.020833333333333in"}
Figure 6.2.1.1.4-1: results for the scenarios with an assumed phase error of 0
degrees.
First we note that the gain of the wanted signal is almost 2 dB for the
isotropic antenna for all scenarios, this is close to the theoretical result
for MRC combining of two independent exponentially distributed outcomes (one
per polarization) with a mean of unity.
In general we observe that
\- the UL beamforming results in significant gain for the serving BS and
reduced interference at other BS compared to the isotropic antenna. The
interference increases when the channel gets richer (e.g. scenario 6)
\- the wanted signal is very sensitive to large (10 degree) rotations.
Moreover, the reciprocity-based schemes outperform the feedback based.
Multiple PMI gives improved performance than Single PMI in scenarios for which
the number of fading blocks is 25. Note that the codebooks are designed for,
and with an assumed, distributed PA architecture so it is relevant to compare
the feedback-based schemes with PO.
The corresponding results for a 30 degree phase error are shown in Figure
6.2.1.1.4-2. Then we observe some reduction in the wanted signal, whereas the
interference is unaffected as expected.
{width="5.902777777777778in" height="3.9375in"}
Figure 6.2.1.1.4-2: results for the scenarios with an assumed phase error of
30 degrees.
Next we look at the performance with 4 UE antennas for the cases in Table
6.2.1.1.4-1 assuming the same UE output t spower. Figure 6.2.1.1.4-3 shows the
results with a zero phase error. Comparing with the results displayed in
Figure 6.2.1.1.4-1 for 8 antennas we note an expected decrease in the wanted
signal level but the interference is almost the same.
{width="5.902777777777778in" height="3.9375in"}
Figure 6.2.1.1.4-3: results for the scenarios with an assumed phase error of 0
degrees (4 UE antennas).
It is recalled that these results are obtained at 15 GHz but it can be
expected that similar performance gains can also be seen at lower frequencies
if physical dimensions are scaled with the wavelength. Hence UL beamforming
can give performance gains below 6 GHz using four UE antennas, which is
already specified for the RX for bands around 2 GHz.
6.2.1.1.5 UE antenna arrangement for a UE architecture
In the above beamforming gains in terms of an increased wanted signal power at
the BS and reduced interference to other BS are demonstrated for 4 or 8 UE
antennas in an array; the evaluations show
\- a significant potential for an increased wanted signal power at the serving
BS;
\- that the interference reduction is significant at other BS for both
reciprocity and feedback-based precoding schemes.
The gains obtained for 8 UE antennas are relevant for the arrangement Figure
6.2.1.1.2-1, while the gains obtained for 4 RX could be relevant for the
arrangement with sub-arrays in Figure 6.2.1.1.2-2 (the results for 4 RX are
obtained with the antennas located at the bottom of the phone).
#### 6.2.1.2 Transceiver architecture at mmWave
For high frequency broadband systems - especially at mmWave range-, the
nonlinearity of analogue components used in RF front ends gives increased
challenges in the implementation. The principal impairments at RF front end of
the transceiver architecture and the key requirements need to be analysed for
achieving high performance, which will be outlined in this subsection.
##### 6.2.1.2.1 Transceiver architectures
Wireless communication requires several stages of signal processing in digital
and analogue domain. Once the signal is converted from digital to analogue, it
is exposed to several analogue impairment sources. Therefore, transceiver
architectures selection can influence differently to the performance of the
system. The transceiver architecture can be either direct (Homodyne)
conversion, as shown in Figure 6.2.1.2.1.1-1 or IF (Heterodyne) conversion, as
shown in 6.2.1.2.1.2-1. [29]
###### 6.2.1.2.1.1 Homodyne transceiver architecture
In a direct conversion architecture, the I and Q modulation is carried out in
the analogue domain, having as a drawback the deficiency of the modulator; as
for example the IQ-imbalance, DC offset and degradation of transmitted signal
resulting in degradation of EVM. However, the major advantage of direct
conversion architecture is that the image problem is avoided because the IF is
zero, and therefore the requirement of a single LO realization is fulfilled.
Another disadvantage of this architecture is that there are no other filters
than RF-band selection filter, which means that the creation of a DC signal
can contribute directly as interference in the band of interest.
###### 6.2.1.2.1.2 Heterodyne transceiver architecture
In the heterodyne architecture, the IF-sampling architecture has the
modulation in the digital domain, thus becomes immune to the problems related
to the I and Q modulator. Nevertheless, it requires a wide bandwidth DAC,
which is more sensible to errors and require more stages of LOs and filters to
eliminate the IF spectral images _._ The heterodyne architecture has an
advantage in the phase noise requirements compared to homodyne architecture,
since the phase noise is logarithmically proportional to the LO frequency
having two sources of LO reduce the phase noise of the system.
The UE reference architecture in Figure 6.2.1.2.1.2-1 with IF conversion is
proposed in mmWave, this does not preclude from using direct conversion at a
more advance stage in NR.
##### 6.2.1.2.2 UE Reference architecture
The RF Frontend consists of all components between the antenna and the digital
baseband system of a transceiver, which is divided mainly in mixers, RF Phase
shifter and power amplifier. The demand of high data rate increases the
research on conflicting requirements. Furthermore, high bandwidth requires
operation in high frequency RF band and this creates big challenges to achieve
high efficiency and good performance. The balance that must be found in size,
capacity and cost should be taken into account in NR.
{width="6.701388888888889in" height="2.4097222222222223in"}
Figure 6.2.1.2.2-1: UE reference architecture
Besides the RF front end, it must be considered that mixers, oscillators,
quadrature modulators are also sources of impairments, due to low port
isolation, generating imperfections in the output signal.
Mixing the RF signal with the LO realizes frequency conversion within the RF
transceivers. The phase of the LO can be non-stationary as a free running
oscillator or time varying modelled as a stationary process of a PLL
synthesizer. Ideally, the outcome of an LO is a single tone in the frequency
domain. However, in reality, the outcome is a modulated tone with a phase
shift. Phase noise -- which increases with LO frequency - causes significant
degradation in the performance and reduces the effective SNR at the receiver,
limiting the BER and data rate. The phase noise gives several constraints on
the design of oscillators. These are further constraints besides the
limitations at the RF frond end -- explained in the next subsections - that
make the choice of a UE transceiver architecture important.
###### 6.2.1.2.2.1 TX Chain
This subsection discusses the most relevant components in the RF front of end
in the transmitter chain, which should be considered as key building blocks
for further study in NR. The transmitter is less complex than the receiver,
thus a less variety of implementations can be studied.
**Power Amplifier**
For transmitting large amount of data modulated in complex waveforms, a high
linear amplification stage is required to minimize distortion. The drawback of
high linear PA is the lack of efficiency. At higher frequency the efficiency
and output power decreases. This means that for transmitting a certain amount
of signal power, more power is required by the PA compared to the systems
operating at carrier frequency under 6 GHz. The major imperfection of the PA
is its nonlinear response and memory effects. The nonlinearity problem of the
PA becomes evident as requirement of larger bandwidth and higher order
modulation schemes are needed to achieve high data rate.
**Phase Shifter**
Phase shifters are source of imbalance and they can be implemented by power
divisor and all -- pass filters producing 90 degree phase shift. The accuracy
depends on the components so that the 90 degree phase shift is not really
exact. There are different phased-array architectures (i.e., RF phase
shifters, LO phase shifters) which differ in functionality of phase shifting
and signal combining and have as critical factors power consumption, losses
and bandwidth. Possible examples of phase shifters (i.e., RF and LO phase
shifters) can be seen in Figure 6.2.1.2.2.1-1.
{width="6.701388888888889in" height="2.1875in"}
Figure 6.2.1.2.2.1-1: RF and LO Phase Shifters
LO phase shifters - compared to RF phase shifter - has a LO path, which is
less sensitive to bandwidth because single tone LO is usually delivered.
Bandwidth only translates to conversion gain difference in the mixer while
using different LO frequencies and can be compensated pushing up the gain in
the LO driver. The penalty for this is the higher power consumption, LO phase
shifter has as drawback the high number of mixers. Every element needs a mixer
to down convert before phase shifting.
In the case of the RF phase shifter, it needs an RF gain stage prior signal
combining for noise reasons due to signal insertion loss. Additionally, it
should meet tougher linearity specifications, which increases the losses of RF
phase shifter. A way to cancel out the losses is to use an amplifier stage.
The bandwidth of RF phase shifter is also challenging and demand more power
consumption. The advantage is that requires one single mixer.
###### 6.2.1.2.2.2 RX Chain
The Rx chain is composed by switch, LNA and phase shifter. This subsection
includes the most relevant components in the receiver chain, which should be
considered as key building blocks for further study in NR.
**Low Noise Amplifier**
One of the most important blocks in the receiver is the LNA. It is needed at
the input of the receiver to amplify the received signal and suppress the
noise contribution of the downconverter. The first stage is the RF block,
which begins with the antenna, followed by the switch, the LNA and ends with
the phase shifter as explained in the NF will be mainly determined by the LNA.
Therefore, the design for the LNA should be optimize for high gain and low NF.
**Phase Shifter**
In receiver element the phase shifted signal are combined before arriving at
the downconverter. The RF phase shifter kind can phase out the interference
and then relax power consumption on the blocks down the chain. The advantage
of RF phase shifter over the LO phase shifting is that the output signal after
RF combiner has a high pattern directivity and can reject an interference
before receiving units, maximizing the value of the phased array as a spatial
filter. Another advantage is the elimination of LO distribution network
resulting in a simple system architecture.
**Filter**
With the increasing complexity of the transceiver at mmWave, the filter has to
satisfy more constraints at the same time, which puts a number of requirements
on the filter such as resonance frequency, coupling factor, quality factor,
temperature sensitivity, etc. Besides the technical limitation of filter at
high frequencies, filters at the RF front end have the disadvantage of
including a considerable insertion loss to both the TX and RX paths of the
transceiver. At mm-wave frequencies, it is much more difficult than at
frequencies below 6 GHz to get a high output power and adding a filter will
implies extra loss, which is not easy to compensate. In particular, if the
filter is not impedance matched to the PA, the mismatch will cause power
losses. Moreover, difference in loading of the PA's across different branches
of an array will cause mismatches in gain and phase of the PA. Another issue
is the increased die size or PCB area of the transceiver. For these reasons
FDD will probably remain a main duplex method for lower frequencies and TDD
for mmWave range.
###### 6.2.1.2.2.3 Beamforming
Due to high path loss encounter at mmWave, beamforming (BF) assumes an
important role to stablish and maintain a robust communication link. There are
several discussions about digital and analogue BF implementation. Digital
beamforming provides a high flexibility in shaping beams at cost of increasing
complexity. The high cost, power consumption and complexity of mmWave mixed
signal components constrains the use of fully-digital BF architectures at the
UE unlike simpler, lower antenna count more conventionally used in sub-6 GHz
systems. On the other hand, analogue BF has fewer RF chain than antenna
elements, which is more cost effective with lower power consumption and
therefore, more suitable for the UE at mmWave. The disadvantage of this
approach is having less flexibility compared to digital BF, since it can only
handle one beam at a time.
The hybrid BF architecture is another approach that consists of reducing the
hardware complexity with limited number of RF chains but using digital
precoding in order to have similar performance to the digital BF, which
enables multi-stream communication and maximizes the sum rate with minimum
interference.
#### 6.2.1.3 Spherical coverage requirement for mmWave UE
For mmWave NR UEs, RF requirements are specified as OTA requirements, using
the applicable metrics. When defining these requirements, it is important to
align the spatial coverage of the requirement with the UE's working condition
acceptable in expected directions.
It is identified, however, NR is expected to be used in more than one type of
UEs and different spatial coverage requirements may apply to different UE
types. Identified UE types include (others not precluded):
\- Smart phone
\- Laptop mounted equipment (such as plug-in devices like USB dongles)
\- Laptop embedded equipment
\- Tablet
\- Wearable devices
\- Vehicular mounted device
\- Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) terminal
\- Fixed mounted devices (e.g. sensors, automation etc.)
For some UE types, a specific portion of its radiation sphere may be blocked
and the spatial requirement on the blocked directions should be excluded. Two
typical scenarios are the wearable devices, such as virtual reality glasses,
and the vehicular mounted device. In case of virtual reality glasses, a
portion of the radiation sphere is blocked by the human head, and in case of
vehicular mounted device, a portion of the radiation sphere is blocked by the
car body.
### 6.2.2 UE Transmitter characteristic
#### 6.2.2.1 Tx maximum output power
\- For Range 1
\- The UE testing methodology (i.e., conducted test) from LTE (TS 36.101) can
be reused even in case of non-standalone (NSA) with control channel
communicated via a high frequency band (f > [6] GHz). If necessity of OTA test
such as beamforming aspects is identified, then requirements associated with
array gain (e.g. EIRP) need to be specified accordingly.
\- For Range 2
\- Beamforming feature is expected to compensate the higher pass-loss. Since
it is necessary to specify transmission power including antenna array gain
from system performance point of view, it should be specified in EIRP. Spatial
coverage requirement assuming full sphere with one power class will be
specified as a baseline in Rel-15. After that, different UE types (e.g.
laptop, vehicle) and other power classes will also be introduced to
accommodate each use case.
\- How to guarantee spatial coverage had been intensively discussed in SI
phase. One of possible approaches is to use CDF to describe spherical
coverage. On the other hand, there was also a concern that it couldn't
guarantee uniform surface density i.e. spatial bias. Although it was agreed
for CDF method that each point represents equal surface area in sphere
surrounding the UE, the advantage of this method and other possible approaches
need further study.
\- How to specify different power classes had also been discussed for two
approaches. One is to define power class based on EIRP considering link budget
perspective. The other is to specify it by TRP considering potential power of
the UE regardless of antenna configuration and/or operating mode. On top of
them, TRP may need to be specified from regulatory point of view and to
mitigate interference in co-channel. In light of this, necessity of TRP needs
to be discussed in the WI phase.
\- For NSA operation
\- For NSA in bands below [6] GHz and above [24] GHz, power sharing mechanism
between LTE and NR was discussed in the SI phase. It was observed that in some
regions there are the radiation exposure/absorption rules of SAR [W/Kg] for
below 6 GHz and MPE [mW/cm2] for above 6 GHz. However, necessity of the power
sharing required further discussions from system and/or regulatory point of
view for the WI phase.
\- For NSA in both bands below [6] GHz, it was identified that power sharing
mechanism between LTE and NR should be specified to meet SAR requirement in a
same principle as UL CA/DC, however RAN4 was not sure whether power sharing
between different RATs is feasible from RAN1/2 and implementation point of
view and couldn\'t exclude other methods at that time. One possible way is to
simply define independent maximum power for LTE and NR and compliance with the
SAR is left to implementation. However, this could require SAR back-off which
cannot be controlled by the NW. Therefore, RAN4 sent an LS to ask RAN1 and
RAN2 to study the feasibility of the power sharing mechanism in RAN4#82. How
to treat this aspect will be discussed in the WI phase.
#### 6.2.2.2 MPR and A-MPR
\- For Range 1
\- Since MPR values for both contiguous and non-contiguous resource allocation
will be specified in the WI phase, it was observed that granularity of MPR
table need to be determined considering spec complexity perspective.
\- For Range 2
\- Since this requirement is related to maximum output power, at least EIRP is
used as a metric. Necessity of TRP was also proposed to align with metric of
emission requirements. However it is still unclear if the power reduction of
TRP is beneficial from link budget point of view, thus the necessity is FFS.
#### 6.2.2.3 Configured transmitted power
\- For Range 1
\- Since this specification requires power calculation mechanism based on RAN1
decision which had not been identified at the time, there was little
discussion on this topic.
\- For Range 2
\- Since this requirement is related to maximum output power, at least EIRP is
used as a metric. Necessity of TRP is FFS.
#### 6.2.2.4 Minimum output power
\- For Range 1
\- Since it was identified that the same requirement as LTE (i.e., -40
dBm/MHz) can be reused, there is no open issue for the WI phase.
\- For Range 2
\- Since this requirement verifies own transmission power near the BS
maintaining necessary signal quality such as EVM, at least EIRP is used as a
metric. Necessity of TRP is FFS. It is also FFS whether the same limit as
Range 1 (i.e. -40 dBm) can be reused considering NF, MCL and degradation level
of noise floor and system perspective.
#### 6.2.2.5 Tx OFF power
\- For Range 1
\- Since it was identified that the same requirement as LTE (i.e., -50
dBm/MHz) can be reused, there is no open issue for the WI phase.
\- For Range 2
\- TRP is used as a metric to be equivalent with existing (conductive)
emission requirement. It is FFS whether -50 dBm should be used in this range
considering following aspects.
\- NF of NR UE
\- MCL between the aggressive and victim UE
\- Degradation level of noise floor due to interference from aggressive NR UE
transmit OFF power
#### 6.2.2.6 ON/OFF time mask
\- For Range 1
\- For NR, it is expected to apply shortened TTI compared to legacy LTE. Based
on this, it was agreed to study whether shorter transient period (20 us) can
be reused in sub-6GHz according to possible sub-carrier spacing. The exact
value will be specified in the WI phase.
\- For Range 2
\- It was agreed that at least beam peak is used as a metric. On the other
hand, necessity of TRP has been proposed since this requirement is not to
directly measure the transient period itself but ON/OFF power before/after the
mask. However there was no consensus on the necessity. And also, based on the
same reason of Range 1, it was agreed to study achievable transient period in
mmWave (e.g., 28 GHz) devices assuming dynamic range of 63dB which was used in
the coexistence study for WP5D as a starting point.
#### 6.2.2.7 Power control
\- For Range 1
\- Since this specification requires power calculation mechanism based on RAN1
decision which had not been identified at the time, there was little
discussion on this topic.
\- For Range 2
\- Since this requirement is related to own transmission signal, at least beam
peak is used as a metric. Necessity of TRP is FFS.
#### 6.2.2.8 Frequency error
\- For Range 1
\- Since it was identified that the same requirement as LTE (i.e. 0.1 ppm) can
be reused, there is no open issue for the WI phase.
\- For Range 2
\- Since this spec verifies own signal quality, beam peak is used as a metric.
It is FFS whether the same frequency error (0.1 ppm) can be reused in this
range considering settling time, etc.
#### 6.2.2.9 EVM
\- For Range 1
\- The detail can be found in clause 6.4.1 in this TR.

TR
#### 6.2.2.10 Carrier leakage
\- For Range 1
\- The detail can be found in clause 6.4.1 in this TR.
\- TRx impairments impact to multiple numerologies case should be
investigated.
\- For Range 2
\- The metric is beam peak and the detail can be found in clause 6.4.1 in this
TR
\- TRx impairments impact to multiple numerologies case should be
investigated.
#### 6.2.2.11 In-band emissions

\- TRx impairments impact to multiple numerologies case should be
investigated.
\- For Range 2
\- The metric is beam peak and the detail can be found in clause 6.1.8 in this
TR
\- TRx impairments impact to multiple numerologies case should be
investigated.
#### 6.2.2.12 Occupied bandwidth
\- For Range 1
\- The value is directly related to the channel BW which will be determined in
the WI phase.
\- For Range 2
\- TRP is used as a metric to be equivalent with existing (conductive)
emission requirement. On the other hand, necessity of EIRP was also proposed
based on that the signal in the band would be coherent. The need will also be
discussed in the WI phase.
#### 6.2.2.13 SEM
\- For Range 1
\- It was agreed that NR UE shall meet the same SEM limit as that of LTE up to
20 MHz CBW since it should not be changed regardless of the interferer from
victim system's point of view. How to treat larger bandwidth than 20 MHz of NR
is FFS.
\- For Range 2
\- TRP is used as a metric to be equivalent with existing (conductive)
emission requirement. Whether there is any justification not to follow the ITU
response is FFS.
#### 6.2.2.14 ACLR
\- For Range 1
\- It was agreed that NR ACLR requirements for UTRA, E-UTRA and NR need to be
specified in the WI phase.
\- For Range 2
\- TRP is used as a metric to be equivalent with existing (conductive)
emission requirement. It was agreed that NR ACLR requirements for UTRA and
E-UTRA are not to be specified. The values themselves will be determined in
the WI phase.
#### 6.2.2.15 Spurious emissions
##### 6.2.2.15.1 General spurious
\- For Range 1
\- It was agreed that NR UE shall meet the same spurious limit as that of LTE
since it should not be changed regardless of the interferer from victim
system's point of view. How to treat F~OOB~ of larger bandwidth than 20 MHz of
NR is FFS. Actual required level in mmWave should also be investigated from
system point of view (sub-6GHz -> mmWave).
\- For Range 2
\- TRP is used as a metric to be equivalent with existing (conductive)
emission requirement. For above 13 GHz transmission, upper measurement
frequency limit should be specified as 2nd harmonics of the upper edge of the
UL operating band including the full harmonic spectrum based on the ITU
recommendation. Whether there is any justification not to follow the ITU
response and actual required level in mmWave should also be investigated from
system point of view (mmWave -> mmWave).
##### 6.2.2.15.2 Additional spurious
\- For Range 1
\- The same limits are reused in legacy victim bands in Range 1 since it
should not be changed regardless of the interferer from victim system's point
of view. How to treat NS applicable bands will be decided in the WI phase.
\- For Range 2
\- TRP is used as a metric to be equivalent with existing (conductive)
emission requirement and the same limits are reused in legacy victim bands in
Range 1 since it should not be changed regardless of the interferer from
victim system's point of view. Necessity of additional/regional limit on top
of the ITU response is FFS.
##### 6.2.2.15.3 UE-to-UE co-existence
\- For Range 1
\- The same limits (i.e., default is -50 dBm/MHz) are reused in legacy victim
bands in Range 1 since it should not be changed regardless of the interferer
from victim system's point of view. To avoid unnecessarily tight requirements,
actual required level in mmWave should also be investigated from system point
of view (sub-6GHz -> mmWave).
\- For Range 2
\- TRP is used as a metric to be equivalent with existing (conductive)
emission requirement. The same limits (i.e., default is -50 dBm/MHz) are
reused in legacy victim bands in Range 1 since it should not be changed
regardless of the interferer from victim system's point of view. To avoid
unnecessarily tight requirements, actual required level in mmWave should also
be investigated from system point of view. (mmWave -> mmWave).
#### 6.2.2.16 Tx intermodulation
\- For Range 1
\- Since necessity of this requirement was identified, the conductive values
will be determined in the WI phase.
\- For Range 2
\- TRP is used as a metric with the blocker from the same direction of
transmitted signal. The level will be determined considering probability of
being same direction when deciding blocker level.
#### 6.2.2.17 Beam correspondence
\- For Range 1
\- There was no discussion in the SI.
\- For Range 2
\- The necessity was proposed and the UE capability was introduced in other
working group(s). How to define the requirement will be discussed in the WI
phase.
### 6.2.3 UE Receiver characteristic
#### 6.2.3.1 REFSENS
\- For Range 1
\- The UE testing methodology (i.e., conducted test) from LTE (TS 36.101) can
be reused even in case of non-standalone (NSA) with control channel
communicated via a high frequency band (f > [6] GHz). If necessity of OTA test
such as beamforming aspects is identified, then requirements associated with
array gain (e.g. EIRP) need to be specified accordingly.
\- For Range 2
\- Beamforming feature is expected to compensate the higher pass-loss. Since
it is necessary to specify transmission power including antenna array gain
from system performance point of view, it should be specified in EIS.
Necessity of TRS is FFS. Spatial coverage requirement assuming full sphere as
a baseline in Rel-15.
\- How to guarantee spatial coverage is had been intensively discussed in SI
phase. One of possible approaches is to use CDF to describe spherical
coverage. On the other hand, there was also a concern that it couldn't
guarantee uniform surface density i.e. spatial bias. Although it was agreed
for CDF method that each point represents equal surface area in sphere
surrounding the UE, the advantage of this method and other possible approaches
need further study.
\- For NSA operation
\- For 1UL cases, MSD impact was investigated in the SI. While some companies
showed no interference is expected between sub-6GHz and mmWave, other
companies raised design difficulties. For 2UL cases, there was no discussion
on IMD level generated by transmissions in sub-6GHz and mmWave. Those impacts
will be investigated in the WI phase.
#### 6.2.3.2 Maximum input level
\- For Range 1
\- Since the maximum modulation of NR UE had not been determined at the time,
the conductive value and the test modulation order is FFS.
\- For Range 2
\- Considering the worst case of saturation of the receiver, beam peak is used
as a metric considering probability of being same direction when deciding
blocker level. Necessity of TRS is FFS. With the same reason as Range 1, the
test modulation order is FFS.
#### 6.2.3.3 ACS
\- For Range 1
\- The conductive values will be determined in the WI phase.
\- For Range 2
\- Considering the worst case of saturation of the receiver, beam peak is used
as a metric. The values will be determined considering probability of being
same direction when deciding blocker level in the WI phase. Necessity of TRS
is FFS to avoid unnecessarily tight requirement.
#### 6.2.3.4 In-band blocking
\- For Range 1
\- The conductive values will be determined in the WI phase.
\- For Range 2
\- Considering the worst case of saturation of the receiver, beam peak is used
as a metric. The values will be determined considering probability of being
same direction when deciding blocker level in the WI phase. Necessity of TRS
is FFS to avoid unnecessarily tight requirement.
#### 6.2.3.5 Out-of-band blocking
\- For Range 1
\- The conductive values will be determined in the WI phase.
\- For Range 2
\- Considering the worst case of saturation of the receiver, beam peak is used
as a metric where OOB blocker is \ Frequency | 1-C-N/1-C-A | FFS | - Frequency | | | > error | | | error | | | | | | accuracy | | | | | | value. | | | | | | | | | | | | - If it is | | | | | | possible to | | | | | | reuse the | | | | | | same | | | | | | frequency | | | | | | error | | | | | | (±0.05, 0.1, | | | | | | 0.25ppm) | | | | | | accuracy for | | | | | | below 6GHz. | | | | | | | | | | | | -

#### 6.3.1.1 Coordinate system
OTA requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic and spatial
parameters. The electromagnetic parameters are specified either in terms of
power (dBm) or field strength (dBμV/m). The spatial parameters are specified
in a Cartesian coordinate system (_x, y, z_) using spherical coordinates (r,
Θ,**__** Φ). The orientation of these coordinates is depicted in the following
figures. Φ** __** is the angle in the x/y plane and it is between the x-axis
and the projection of the vector onto the x/y plane and is defined between
-180° and +180°, inclusive. Θ*** *** is the angle between the projection of
the vector in the x/y plane and the vector and is defined between -90° and
+90°, inclusive.
A point in the Cartesian coordinate system (_x_ ,_y_ ,_z_) can be transformed
to spherical coordinates (r, Θ,**__** Φ) using the following relationships:
The inverse transformation is given by:
The representation and definitions of angles are described in figure
6.3.1.1-1, figure 6.3.1.1-2 and figure 6.3.1.1-3.

A different coordinate system can be used in the technical report to carry out
simulations, conformance testing, or present results as long as it is clearly
indicated that it is different.
The vendor declares the location of this coordinate system origin in reference
to an identifiable physical feature of the BS enclosure. The vendor also
declares the orientation of this coordinate system in reference to an
identifiable physical feature of the BS enclosure.
#### 6.3.1.2 BS class
Definitions of NR BS classes were agreed [R4-1702357].
NR BS classes for BS without antenna connectors are defined as indicated
below:
\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 35 m.
\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal
to 5 m.
\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the ground equal to
2 m.
NR BS classes for BS with antenna connectors are defined as indicated below:
\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB.
\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 53 dB.
\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB.
The following text is added together with any definition of BS classes:
\- The deployment scenarios associated with and definitions of BS classes are
exactly the same for BS both with and without connectors. An MCL of 70dB
corresponds to a minimum distance of around 35m, 53dB to around 5m and 45dB to
around 2m respectively for BS with connectors.
NR Home BS class is FFS.
For some BS class, a limit on the maximum output power is applied. For the NR
specifications, it was agreed that the output power limit will be based on
TRP. [R4-1610923]
### 6.3.2 BS Transmitter characteristic
#### 6.3.2.1 General
PA models are quite essential investigating the transmitter characteristics. A
general overview of a few PA models as well as fully parameterized General
Memory Polynomial models which capture the memory effects is described in
detail in Annex A. The annex captures some models provided as a starting point
for the Study Item; the use of different models during the SI or WI is not
precluded. It is noted that the PA model should be applied in conjunction with
appropriate RF requirements. CFR and DPD algorithms should also be considered
when use the PA model for BS transmitter.
#### 6.3.2.2 BS output power
**For Range 1,**
\- For OTA output power accuracy requirement,
\- It was agreed to use EIRP as an accuracy requirement by following AAS
agreement.
\- Declaration of the range of direction to meet EIRP accuracy will follow
AAS/eAAS.
\- TRP needs to be declared for BS class related power limit, maximum power
condition etc.
\- It was confirmed that the same output power accuracy values (+/- 2.0dB and
+/- 2.2 dB for conducted and OTA respectively) in existing specifications (TS
36.104 and TS 37.105) can be used in NR as well.
**For Range 2**
\- It was agreed to use EIRP as an accuracy requirement.
\- Declaration of the range of direction to meet EIRP accuracy will follow
AAS/eAAS.
\- It is FFS whether the same EIRP accuracy equation with AAS can be reused or
not.
\- TRP needs to be declared for BS class related power limit, maximum power
condition etc.
#### 6.3.2.3 Output power dynamic range
\
#### 6.3.2.4 Transmit ON/OFF power
\
#### 6.3.2.5 Transmitted signal quality
##### 6.3.2.5.1 Frequency error
\
##### 6.3.2.5.2 EVM
Refer Section 6.1.8.
##### 6.3.2.5.3 TAE
\
##### 6.3.2.5.4 DL RS power
\
#### 6.3.2.6 Unwanted emission
##### 6.3.2.6.1 Occupied bandwidth
**For Range 1,**
\- It was agreed that the same principle with existing (99% power should be
within CBW) can be reused, i.e. the occupied bandwidth is a measure of the
bandwidth containing 99% of the total integrated mean power of the transmitted
spectrum on the assigned channel.
\- For conduct requirement
\- The minimum requirement for conduct occupied bandwidth shall be less than
the channel bandwidth supported by NR.
\- The channel bandwidths supported by NR are FFS
\- For OTA requirement,
\- For OTA occupied bandwidth, the beam characteristics are not important. The
requirement should however cover the fact that all transmitters are active and
the system is operating at the maximum declared rated total radiated power.
\- The minimum requirement for OTA occupied bandwidth shall be less than the
channel bandwidth supported by NR.
\- The channel bandwidths supported by NR are FFS
Note: The occupied bandwidth requirement may be a regulatory requirement in
some regions. There may also be regional requirements to declare the occupied
bandwidth according to the definition.
**For Range 2,**
\- For OTA occupied bandwidth, the beam characteristics are not important. The
requirement should however cover the fact that all transmitters are active and
the system is operating at the maximum declared rated total radiated power.
\- The minimum requirement for OTA occupied bandwidth shall be less than the
channel bandwidth supported by NR.
\- The channel bandwidths supported by NR are FFS
Note: The occupied bandwidth requirement may be a regulatory requirement in
some regions. There may also be regional requirements to declare the occupied
bandwidth according to the definition.
##### 6.3.2.6.2 ACLR
**For Range 1,**
\- For OTA requirement,
\- It was agreed that the ACLR shall be based on TRP of the signal in the
wanted channel and TRP of the signal in the adjacent channel.
\- For conformance testing, TRP will be measured on a finite grid that may be
optimised to provide the needed accuracy in estimating TRP whilst not causing
undue measurement time.
**For Range 2**
\- It was agreed that the ACLR shall be based on TRP of the signal in the
wanted channel and TRP of the signal in the adjacent channel.
\- For conformance testing, TRP will be measured on a finite grid that may be
optimised to provide the needed accuracy in estimating TRP whilst not causing
undue measurement time.
Note: BS ACLR was analysed in the context of the response to ITU-R on
parameters for the 24-86GHz range. Details of the ITU-R analysis and ACLR
values are provided in chapter 11. An ACLR requirement for the 3GPP
specification should be decided in the WI.
##### 6.3.2.6.3 Mask
**For Range 1,**
\- The operating band unwanted emissions are a set of absolute power levels
which emissions from the BS must not exceed. They are defined by a frequency
offset, measurement bandwidths and an absolute power level.
\- The absolute power level may be a fixed value in dBm or may be calculated
based on the power of the wanted signal and the frequency offset.
\- For OTA requirement,
\- the requirement is derived using a similar method but rather than the sum
of the conducted power it is based on TRP.
**For Range 2**
\- TRP will be used for a metric for the absolute limits.
\- The FCC limit for mm wave and ACLR for the co-existence studies [17] is to
be considered the starting point.
\- A 1MHz measurement bandwidth will be applied to all frequency offsets.
Note: BS SEM for range 2 was analysed in the context of the response to ITU-R
on parameters for the 24-86GHz range. Details of the ITU-R analysis and SEM

specification should be decided in the WI.

# 8 Regulatory aspect
## 8.1 Overview of international and regional regulation
### 8.1.1 ITU-R
The Radio Regulations [5] is an international binding treaty for how RF
spectrum is used. It is updated and agreed at the World Radiocommunication
Conference (WRC) that is held every 3 to 4 years. One RF parameter related to
unwanted emissions is defined directly in the radio regulation:
\- ITU Radio Regulations No. S1.153 ‎[5] provides a definition of _Occupied
bandwidth_.
ITU-R Study Group 1 is responsible for Spectrum management principles and
techniques and develops international recommendations for unwanted emissions.
The following ITU-R recommendations provide generic limits and some guidelines
for how to specify unwanted emissions:
\- ITU-R SM.329-12 [4] provides terminology and definitions in the area of
spurious emissions. It also gives recommendations of how limits are applied
and recommended limit values and reference bandwidths. Limits are given in
different "Categories", where Category A limits are generally applicable while
other Categories have regional application for certain services. Some limits
are further described in Annexes to the recommendation, where in particular
Annex 7 gives reference bandwidths for Category B limits in the land mobile
service.
\- ITU-R SM.328-11 [3] provides terminology and definitions in the area of
spectra and bandwidth of emissions. It is intended to provide guidance in
deriving limits for out-of-band emissions and gives examples of how emitted
spectra can be classified and what parameters can be used to specify it. Most
of the text concerns analogue and narrowband modulation.
\- ITU-R SM.1539-1 [7] specifically deals with the boundary between the out-
of-band and spurious domains. It proposes variations to the default "250%
rule" for wideband emissions for different frequency ranges, where the highest
interval is above 26 GHz.
\- ITU-R SM.1540 [8] gives recommendations for emissions falling into an
adjacent band allocation.
\- ITU-R SM.1541-6 [9] gives recommendations for emission in the out-of-band
domain. Annex 11 covers land mobile services, but there is only discussion of
narrowband systems (up to 30 kHz).
NOTE: The term _Out-of-band (OOB) emissions_ can cause some confusion and is
for this reason mostly avoided in 3GPP BS specifications. Regulation defines
OOB emissions as "_Emission on a frequency or frequencies immediately outside
the necessary bandwidth which results from the modulation process, but
excluding spurious emissions_ ". OOB emissions are thereby the emissions
[closest to]{.underline} the transmitted carrier(s) and the term "Out-of-band"
[does not]{.underline} refer to emission being outside the operating band or
an operator's assigned band. Note that spurious emissions and OOB emissions
are mutually exclusive through the definition, making the boundary between
them very important. OOB emissions are for WCDMA and LTE BS defined through
ACLR, spectrum mask (for WCMDA) and operating band unwanted emissions (for
LTE).
### 8.1.2 European regulation
The European regulations include unwanted emission levels. As basis, the
limits included in ITU-R documents. Limits applicable in Europe are in ITU-R
SM.329-12 [4] identified as _Category B_ requirements are used. In addition,
the following European recommendations are developed and maintained by
CEPT/ECC regarding unwanted emissions as follows:
\- ECC Rec (02)05 [14] is an "umbrella" recommendation on unwanted emissions,
giving general guidelines on out-of-band and spurious emissions, the boundary
between out-of-band and spurious domains, with reference to ITU-R
recommendations and the ERC Rec. 74-01 on spurious emissions [15]
\- ERC Rec. 74-01 [15] provides terminology and definitions in the area of
spurious emissions, with recommended limit values and reference bandwidths for
the spurious domain. It corresponds to the Category B limits in ITU-R Rec. SM
329-12 [7], but has in addition provisions for mobile services covering multi-
carrier and multi-RAT base stations.
CEPT/ECC publishes decisions, recommendations and reports related to spectrum
usage. These may include emission limits. In many cases, the spectrum decision
s are also confirmed in a spectrum decision by the European Union (EU). Here
it should be noted that the EU has 28 member states while CEPT has 48 national
administrations as members. The spectrum decisions made by the EU is the basis
for national licensing conditions in countries across Europe. In addition, ECC
decision and/or recommendations are used.
Information related to the use of spectrum in CEPT member states and used in
Annex B are maintained in the ERC Report 25 version that is approved as of
June 2016 [2].
Annex B provides information on the services and applications allocated in
Europe in the bands of interest for NR [2].
The radio equipment requirements for products in Europe is set by _Harmonized
Standards_. The harmonized standard for IMT equipment is EN 301 908 [16],
divided into individual parts for each type of equipment. The parts for UMTS
and LTE equipment are based on extracts from the 3GPP RAN4 and RAN5 test
specifications.
### 8.1.3 U.S. regulation (FCC)
The U.S. regulation in the telecommunications area is set by FCC Title 47
[11]. The different parts of Title 47 cover licensing requirements and
procedures, as well as operational and technical requirements and other
provisions. Example of parts covering 3GPP bands are Part 22 (Public mobile
services), Part 25 (Personal communication services) and Part 27
(Miscellaneous wireless communications services). The technical requirements
include power limits, emission limits, measurement principles and statements
on interference protection and other technical provisions.
For bands above 24 GHz, the FCC has recently published a Report and Order and
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [17].
These new rules open up nearly 11 GHz of high-frequency spectrum for flexible,
mobile and fixed use wireless broadband -- 3.85 GHz of licensed spectrum and 7
GHz of unlicensed spectrum. The new rules create a new Upper Microwave
Flexible Use service in the 28 GHz (27.5-28.35 GHz), 37 GHz (37-38.6 GHz), and
39 GHz (38.6-40 GHz) bands, and a new unlicensed band at 64-71 GHz.
\- Licensed use in the 28 GHz, 37 GHz and 39 GHz bands: Makes available 3.85
GHz of licensed, flexible use spectrum, which is more than four times the
amount of flexible use spectrum the FCC has licensed to date.
\- Provides consistent block sizes (200 MHz), license areas (Partial Economic
Areas), technical rules, and operability across the exclusively licensed
portion of the 37 GHz band and the 39 GHz band to make 2.4 GHz of spectrum
available.
\- Provides two 425 MHz blocks for the 28 GHz band on a county basis and
operability across the band.
\- Unlicensed use in the 64-71 GHz band: Makes available 7 GHz of unlicensed
spectrum which, when combined with the existing high-band unlicensed spectrum
(57-64 GHz), doubles the amount of high-band unlicensed spectrum to 14 GHz of
contiguous unlicensed spectrum (57-71 GHz). These 14 GHz will be 15 times as
much as all unlicensed Wi-Fi spectrum in lower bands.
\- Shared access in the 37-37.6 GHz band: Makes available 600 MHz of spectrum
for dynamic shared access between different commercial users, and commercial
and federal users.
A new Part 30 (Upper Microwave Flexible Use Service) is added and licenses
issued in the 27.5-28.35 GHz band and licenses in the 38.6-40 GHz band are
reassigned to the new service. The following subparts relate directly to RF
aspects:
\- § 30.202 Power limits: Max EIRP limits
\- § 30.203 Emission limits: OOBE and spurious emissions limits (conducted or
total radiated power)
The new Part 30 power limits from [17] are shown in Table 8.1.3-1 and the
Emission limits in Table 8.1.3-2.

## 8.2 Boundary between spurious and OOB domain
One of the fundamental RF parameters to define for NR is the unwanted
emissions. In regulation, unwanted emissions are divided into _Spurious
emissions_ and _Out-of-band emissions_ and the boundary between those two
domains has a profound impact on the emission limits that can be defined for a
radio access technology such as NR. This subclause describes the details of
the boundary between the spurious and OOB domain, how it was handled in
specifications for WCDMA and LTE and impact for NR.
### 8.2.1 Application of boundary for UMTS and LTE BS below 6 GHz
When UMTS (UTRA) was first specified by 3GPP as an IMT-2000 technology in
1998-2000, spurious emission limits and the boundary between spurious and out-
of-band (OOB) domain were fundamentally based on the international
recommendation ITU-R SM.329 [4]. For requirements applicable in Europe,
Category B limits were used, which are also covered in ERC Recommendation
74-01 [14]. Those limits are applicable also in many other countries that use
European harmonised standards for product certification.
Later in 2005-2006, when new frequency bands were added to WCDMA and LTE
(E-UTRA) was included as a new wideband radio access, there was a need to
update the way the limits were applied for base stations in particular. This
was all done in close co-operation between 3GPP, ETSI and ECC. How the limits
are applied is documented in TR 25.942 [18], subclause 14.2.3.
The boundary between the out-of-band and spurious domain is based on the "250%
rule" in ITU‑R SM.329 [4]. The rule states that "_the spurious domain
generally consists of frequencies separated from the centre frequency of the
emission by 250% or more of the necessary bandwidth of the emission._ " The
application for WCDMA and LTE is as follows:
\- The boundary between the out-of-band and spurious domain is for base
stations fundamentally based on a 5 MHz channel bandwidth, placing it at 12.5
MHz from the carrier centre (10 MHz from the channel edge). This 10 MHz
assumption originates from the UMTS 5 MHz carrier and is in 3GPP also applied
for LTE BS transmissions, applying as a stricter requirement also to 10, 15 or
20 MHz RF bandwidth. Note that this is not the case for LTE UEs (terminals),
where the 250% rule is applied also for larger carrier bandwidths.
\- The limits inside the operating band for a UMTS or LTE BS are based on a
reduced measurement bandwidth close to the carrier, as outlined in the
recommendations (see Annex 2 of [15]). This reduction is in the 3GPP
specifications interpreted as a relaxed limit of -15 dBm/MHz. While the
recommendations allow for this reduction in a frequency range up to 10 times
the necessary bandwidth, it was agreed that the relaxed limit could be applied
in the complete transmitter operating band, plus in 10 MHz on each side of the
operating band.
\- The agreement above between 3GPP, ETSI and the ECC on the spurious emission
limits is based on the following:
\- The limits are in line with the limits used in ERC and ECC compatibility
studies.
\- There is no impact on in-band sharing between different IMT technologies.
\- The limits are fair between operators and give mutual advantages,
regardless of the technology deployed, the carrier bandwidth, the number of
carriers or the position of the operator's license block.
The agreed limits were implemented for both UMTS and LTE at that time. For
LTE, the limits are interpreted as Operating band unwanted emission limits,
which is a unified definition of all unwanted emission within the operating
band, plus in 10 MHz on each side, as shown in Figure 8.2.1-1. Outside of that
range, spurious emissions are defined, as shown in Figure 8.2.1-2.
Figure 8.2.1-1: Defined frequency range for LTE Operating band unwanted
emissions with an example RF carrier and related mask shape (from TR 36.942).
Figure 8.2.1-2: Defined frequency ranges for LTE spurious emissions and
operating band unwanted emissions (from TR 36.942).
### 8.2.2 Application of boundary for UMTS and LTE UE below 6 GHz
\
### 8.2.3 Wideband, multicarrier and Multi-RAT transmissions
When LTE (E-UTRA) was developed, the focus was first on single-carrier
transmission with flexible channel bandwidth (1.4 to 20 MHz). It was however
quite early made clear that BS transmitters with multiple carriers would be
deployed, in particular when the MSR standard was developed and later on when
intra-band Carrier Aggregation was defined. It was then noted that the
existing recommendations for spurious emissions did not give a proper guidance
for such multicarrier transmissions and that for the text provided, mobile
services were excluded. This is of particular concern for Category B spurious
emission limits, since they are stricter.
This resulted in an update of ERC Rec 74-01 [15]. The update was mainly
concerned with how the necessary bandwidth is calculated for such a
multicarrier/multi-RAT transmitter and how the boundary between out-of-band
and spurious domain is determined, with the following elements:
\- The _transmitter bandwidth_ is used as the necessary bandwidth for
determining the limit between the out-of-band and spurious domain, and it is
defined as the width of the frequency band covering the envelope of the
transmitted carriers.
\- Particular guidance is given in for _wideband transmitters_ , with
reference to ITU-R Rec SM.1539-1 [7].
\- Rules are made applicable for both _contiguous and non-contiguous
transmissions_ within a frequency block.
Present UMTS, LTE and MSR specifications for base stations (and UEs) are fully
in line with the updated version of ERC Rec 74-01. A more detailed description
of the background and development of the spurious emission limits for
multicarrier and multi-RAT transmissions can be found in TR 37.900 [20],
subclause 6.6.1.2.
### 8.2.4 Regulation above 6 GHz and for large carrier bandwidths
With the work on a New Radio access (NR) targeting IMT-2020 as defined by
ITU-R, there are a number of regulatory aspects to take into account. For the
unwanted emission limits and the boundary between OOB and spurious domain, the
following properties of NR must be considered:
\- Large BS RF bandwidths covering the full band, which is the norm already
today.
\- Larger carrier bandwidths with numerology that may give higher out-of-band
emission levels. This has a direct impact on the assumed boundary to the
spurious domain defined for a transmitted carrier, which is relevant for the
Operating band unwanted emission mask (UEM) levels inside the band, assuming
that these can be defined in a way similar to what was done for LTE. Such a
mask cannot anymore use a 5 MHz carrier as a baseline for setting the limits,
due to the wider carriers and the new numerologies.
\- For a carrier placed at the edge of a band, the unwanted emission levels
outside the band will depend on the carrier bandwidth and numerology, but also
on any passband filtering applied for the band. Such a filter will most likely
still be employed at lower bands, but is more challenging for higher bands for
AAS-type systems, in terms of achieving high attenuation close to the band.
This has to do both with the width of the band and the high absolute
frequency, as well as the RF properties of mm-wave technologies.
The present WCDMA and LTE unwanted emission limits are defined with a spurious
emission level starting 10 MHz outside the operating band. The large carrier
bandwidths and new numerologies will make such an assumption challenging
already for lower bands and a higher number should be considered. The even
larger carrier bandwidths and reduced possibilities for band filtering in
higher bands (mm-wave) will in combination with new numerologies imply that
the OOB domain will have to stretch further than 10 MHz from the band edge.
It should be noted that the regulation does not in any way stipulate a "10 MHz
rule", this is a voluntary constraint put by 3GPP on the emission limits for
LTE and WCDMA. In particular for the new bands, we have to go back to what the
regulation recommends, which is the "250% rule" as defined above. The rule for
wider carriers and higher bands is defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.1539-1
[7], as shown in Table 8.2.3-1. The recommendation defines a threshold value
_B~U~_ for the necessary bandwidth _B~N~_ of the transmission. When the
bandwidth of the transmission is higher than the threshold _B~U~_ , the 250%
rule (2.5 _B~N~_) is replaced by the rule listed in the "Separation" column,
resulting in a separation somewhere between 150% and 250% of the necessary
bandwidth.
Table 8.2.4-1: Guideline values for the boundary of the spurious domain\
(Extracted from ITU-R SM.1539 [6])
* * *
Frequency\ Normal\ Wideband case\  
range separation (_BN_ > _BU_)
                                          *BU*             Separation
30 MHz \ 26 GHz 2.5 _BN_ 500 MHz 1.5 _BN_ \+ 500 MHz
* * *
Note that the recommended separation to the boundary of the spurious domain
stipulated by the rule in [7] gives a considerably larger offset from the
carrier edge or band edge than the 10 MHz used today for LTE and WCDMA. Two
examples:
\- A 100 MHz carrier at any frequency >3 GHz would give a recommended 200 MHz
offset from the edge to the start of the spurious domain.
\- A 1 GHz carrier at any frequency >15 GHz would give a recommended 1.5 GHz
offset from the edge to the start of the spurious domain.
While such large offsets to the boundary between the OOB and spurious domain
may not be necessary for an NR specification, it is quite clear that the
present way of specifying unwanted emissions cannot remain intact.
8.3 Suitability of technical conditions of ECC DEC (11) 06 for 5G
ECC PT1 sent an LS to 3GPP in April to inform the progress of regulatory work
for IMT 2020/ 5G spectrum in Europe [27]. Later in June, ECC Plenary (June
2016) tasked ECC PT1 to assess the suitability of technical conditions of ECC
Decision (11)06 to 5G. And in September, ECC PT1 sent an LS to 3GPP to seek
feedback on the technical parameters foreseen for introducing 5G technologies
in the 3400-3800 MHz band. Corresponding study of suitability of technical
conditions of ECC DEC (11) 06 for 5G is carried out in 3GPP RAN4.
8.3.1 Technical conditions in frequency bands 3400-3600MHz and 3600-3800MHz
It is noted that the requirements specified in ECC DEC (11) 06 are mainly for
the BS side. For UE side, ECC decision provides a recommended upper limit of
25 dBm for the in-block power of the UEs.And the power limit is specified as
e.i.r.p. for UEs designed to be fixed or installed and as TRxP for Ues
designed to be mobile or nomadic.
To better understand the requirements specified in [3], the terms used in ECC

# 9 Radio resource management
## 9.1 Mobility aspects
At least two UE states will be specified in NR: RRC_CONNECTED and RRC_IDLE. A
new state, RRC_INACTIVE, also is expected to be introduced for NR UE as
outlined in TR 38.804 [43], for which the UE and at least one gNB should keep
the AS context information. RAN4 RRM requirements have to ensure NR UE
performance while in any of the NR RRC states, as well as smooth transition
between the RRC states.
NR cell corresponds to one or multiple TRxPs, which may be co-located or non-
collocated. A cell is associated with a cell ID. Detecting a cell by a UE
means detecting also at least its cell ID. The cell ID is the same ID as that
carried by NR-SS.
In the RRC_IDLE state, the UE camps on a best cell and cell-level mobility is
supported based on DL cell-level measurements.
The RRC_IDLE state (in at least standalone) NR involves at least the following
UE procedures:
\- Cell selection (including cell evaluation)
\- Cell selection refers to initial detection of an NR cell during cell
selection procedure (i.e., the NR UE is not yet camped on a cell), e.g. at
power ON, resulting in UE camping on the selected cell. To select a cell, the
UE has to perform measurements and evaluate whether the cell is suitable for
being selected.
\- Cell reselection (including at least cell evaluation)
\- NR UE which has been camping on a cell may reselect to another cell.
\- Cell identification (including at least cell detection)
\- NR UE camping on a cell can perform cell identification.
For mobility, cell reselection and cell identification RRM requirements will
be specified.
In the RRC_CONNECTED state, UE mobility is supported based on DL cell-level
and/or beam-level measurements. In multi-beam operation, beam-level
measurements can be used to derive cell-level quality of the cell associated
with the beams. In the RRC_CONNECTED state, the NR UE can perform:
\- Cell identification, including at least cell detection,
\- Beam identification, performed in an identified cell and included at least
beam detection.
Depending e.g. on RAN1 design and RAN2 signaling, the identification time
periods (e.g., for cell or beam identification) may also involve performing
and reporting a measurement or receiving a part of the system information.
The mobility procedures in the RRC_INACTIVE state may be different from those
in the RRC_IDLE and RRC_CONNECTED states and may also depend on how the RRC
state transition is performed.
In addition to intra-RAT mobility, inter-RAT mobility at least between
standalone NR and LTE will also be supported.
For the relevant RRC states, RAN4 will specify RRM requirements to ensure UE
performance in relation to intra-RAT, including intra-frequency and inter-
frequency, as well as inter-RAT mobility to support the agreed NR-based
network architectures. If beam-level mobility is supported, RAN4 would need to
develop the corresponding mobility requirements too. The mobility requirements
need to cover, e.g., RRC connection, random access, handover, cell
reselection, cell identification, beam identification, etc. The mobility
procedures may need to be performed with and without neighbour list provided
by the network.
UL-based mobility for NR has also been discussed in RAN2. If UL-based is
supported in NR, RAN4 needs to discuss the necessary requirements during the
NR WI.
## 9.2 Beam management
The following RRM procedures related to beam management can be further
studied:
\- Beam determination: RAN4 needs to study requirements for this procedure
related to select at least one of its own transmit/receive beam(s).
\- Beam measurement: RAN4 needs to study requirements for beam measurement.
The detailed requirements need further study since the physical layer design
has not been finalized. The potential requirement may include beam measurement
period, beam measurement accuracy, etc.
\- Beam reporting: RAN4 needs to study the potential requirement for beam
reporting. The requirement may include at least reporting delay.
\- Beam sweeping: Whether RRM requirements for beam sweeping at both NR UE and
TRxP sides are needed needs further study in WI phase.
## 9.3 Timing aspects
Timing aspects of NR RRM shall be investigated in the NR work item phase.
## 9.4 Power consumption related aspects
### 9.4.1 Power consumption model for RRM
Power consumption models may be useful for investigating the power consumption
impact of different RRM requirements. Models are needed for both gNB and UE.
The power consumption models are simplified models and are not intended to
capture details or in any way limit gNB or UE implementation. Different models
are defined for the UE and the gNB.
#### 9.4.1.1 UE power consumption model
Four different power consumption conditions are defined as shown in figure
9.4.1.1-1:
\- Deep sleep: The UE is operating in its lowest power consumption mode, with
baseband circuits maintaining timing to the lowest level of accuracy and
minimal other baseband activity. RF circuits are not active.
\- Light sleep: The UE in this state have maintained timing using a clock and
activity level which allows reception to be started with a reasonably small
delay. This state represents the UE being ready to start to receive with
minimal delay.
\- Active RX only: The UE is actively receiving, or attempting to receive a
signal. This state is characterised by the RF receiver circuit being active.
\- Active TX only: The UE is actively transmitting a signal.
Active TX + RX: The UE is actively receiving and transmitting (RX and TX are
active). The power consumption in this state is assumed to be the sum of the
active RX only power consumption + active TX only power consumption.
{width="6.493055555555555in" height="3.9722222222222223in"}
Figure 9.4.1.1-1: Power consumption states for the UE model
The UE or gNB power consumption state can change dynamically based on NR UE
requirements for reception and transmission. For example, if DRX is active in
a UE it can be expected to spend as much of the DRX off duration as possible
in deep sleep. Prior to an RX on period, it may move to light sleep state
before it enters active RX and TX depending on requirements for reception and
transmission. UE will remain in active state as required according to
monitoring and scheduling requirements. When UE is no longer required to
receive or transmit, it may move back to light or deep sleep again. Power
consumption may be estimated by considering the proportion of time that the UE
spends in each state.
RRM activities may extend the duration that the UE needs to remain in either
the active RX state or the active TX state.
The parameters used for the NR model are shown in table 9.4.1.1-1.
Table 9.4.1.1-1: Predicted power consumption in different states for the UE
model

#### 9.4.1.2 gNB power consumption model
The gNB power consumption model is characterized by 4 states as illustrated in
figure 9.4.1.2-1.
{width="5.5in" height="2.111111111111111in"}
Figure 9.4.1.2-1: Power consumption states for the gNB model
The power consumption assumption and the RRC state transition assumptions are
listed in table 9.4.1.2-1.
Table 9.4.1.2-1: Predicted gNB Power consumption under different conditions
{width="4.777777777777778in" height="2.201388888888889in"}
The principles of the gNB power consumption model are the same as for the NR
UE model. gNB can be in different power saving states each of which depends on
the activity (transmission and/or reception) of the gNB. A gNB power
consumption depends on the configuration and load. If the gNB is 2x2 macro
with full load or no load the power consumption is listed in the Load column
in Table 9.4.1.2-1. If the gNB does not need to be active in next symbol it
may enter sleep mode 1 (SM1). If gNB does not need to be active for 1ms it can
then enter sleep mode 2 (SM2), etc. The gNB wake up procedure goes back to
full activity in a step wise manner.
### 9.4.2 Principles for reducing power consumption
At least the following list of possible techniques for power saving can be
studies for NR RRM:
**[1. Power saving opportunities for transmission of reference
signals]{.underline}**
\- Follow lean carrier principles
\- Transmission of NR-SS synchronization signal as infrequently as possible.
\- Transmission of reference signals as infrequently as possible.
\- Transmission of measurement reference signals necessary to perform time and
frequency synchronisation, allow identifying a beam and perform beam
measurements.
\- Minimise time duration of individual transmissions e.g. using wideband
signals in frequency domain.
\- Provide assistance information on reference signal timing in neighbour
nodes to reduce NR UE measurement time (e.g. similar to DMTC window in LTE).
\- RAN4 should study the effect of the above principles on the NR RRM
requirements.
**[2. Power saving opportunities for receiving and measuring reference
signals]{.underline}**
\- RAN4 should explore measurements activity in order to enable NR UE power
savings.
\- RAN4 should study wideband measurements versus longer measurement time to
reach a given level of accuracy.
\- RAN4 should take into account the UE power saving opportunities when
developing measurements requirements in order to enable UE power savings, e.g.
align performance requirements with DRX.
\- RAN4 should enable that available assistance information is used to
minimize search and measurement time.
### 9.4.3 Configurability of requirements
Power consumption in RRM requirements is an engineering trade-off. Performance
of measurements needs to be good enough to meet the needs of the system but it
would be wasteful to have minimum requirements which exceed the needs of the
system.
In determining the RRM requirements for NR the goal should be to ensure that
power consumption and measurement delay is configurable over a suitable range.
## 9.5 Measurements and measurement related requirements
### 9.5.1 Measurement procedures
NR UE can perform measurements at least in the RRC_IDLE state (when it is
camped on a cell) and RRC_CONNECTED state. The UE will perform measurements
according to the corresponding requirements.
The UE will perform measurements at least for the following purposes:
\- Mobility
\- Beam management
### 9.5.2 Measurement reporting
The NR UE will report measurement results at least in RRC_CONNECTED state.
### 9.5.3 Measurements by carrier frequency relation
#### 9.5.3.1 Intra-frequency measurements
In NR, the UE will support intra-frequency measurements at least for intra-
frequency mobility, RRM (e.g., beam management), and RLM. RAN4 needs to study
whether UE needs measurements gaps for intra-frequency measurements.
#### 9.5.3.2 Inter-frequency measurements
In NR, UE will support inter-frequency measurements at least for inter-
frequency mobility.
The inter-frequency measurements on different frequencies may be for different
numerologies, which may further impact the inter-frequency measurement gap
configurations.
UE may need measurement gaps to perform inter-frequency measurements.
#### 9.5.3.3 Inter-RAT measurements
In NR, UE will support inter-RAT measurements for inter-RAT mobility at least
between NR and LTE. The measurements will be performed according to the
corresponding RAN4 requirements.
#### 9.5.3.4 CA measurements
In NR, the UE will support CA measurements at least for serving cells change
and RRM (e.g., beam management). RAN4 needs to study whether UE needs
measurements gaps for CA measurements.
### 9.5.4 Measurements in relation to beams
The impact of the beamforming on measurements performed by the NR UE is to be
further based on at least following aspects:
A UE may perform measurement with at least one of: DL transmit beam, DL
receive beam, UL receive beam, and UL transmit beam.
RAN4 should further discuss whether there is a difference between measurements
with and without beamforming and if so, what is the exact difference.
### 9.5.5 Measurement bandwidth aspects
Requirements for measurements shall be developed for NR UEs supporting
different bandwidths _._ The requirements may include specification of a
minimum measurement bandwidth which is the minimum bandwidth upon which the
accuracy requirements are based assuming UE is using minimum measurement
bandwidth. The possibility to configure wideband measurements (e.g. the
measurement bandwidth size and allocation), for example with RRC signalling,
is not precluded.
RAN4 should investigate how the minimum measurement bandwidth may scale
according to subcarrier spacing. In addition, RAN4 needs to look at whether
different NR use cases (such as mobile broadband, machine type communication
and/or URLLC) could lead to different minimum measurement BWs.
RAN4 needs to study whether to define minimum measurement bandwidth during the
NR work item for different use cases and subcarrier spacings.
#### 9.5.5.1 Measurements for UEs with different supported BW and numerology
In NR, a UE may support a bandwidth which is less than the NR system
bandwidth. In addition, for more capable devices which support at least the NR
system bandwidth, bandwidth adaptation is being considered, whereby UEs may
change operating bandwidth for balancing between power saving and scheduling
purposes on a semi-static or dynamic basis.
In either case, the UE requirements should be developed assuming that UE
performing RRM measurements over a bandwidth which is not more than the
currently configured UE downlink operating bandwidth, i.e. the UEs current
operating radio link.
RAN4 should investigate measurement gaps and if they are provided to allow
bandwidth reconfiguration of the receiver.
In NR, a cell may operate with multiple OFDM numerologies simultaneously using
either FDM or TDM techniques. NR UEs may support a subset of the numerologies
which NR cells are currently operating with. In these cases, measurements may
be performed only on resource elements which correspond to numerologies
supported by the UE.
## 9.6 Measurement capacity
The impact of the beamforming on the amount of parallel measurements supported
by the NR UE should be further studied.
# 10 Testability
## 10.1 RRM requirements testability
### 10.1.1 General
Testability aspects of both gNB and UE have been considered. Unless otherwise
indicated below, device under test (DUT) could refer to either gNB or UE
nodes. The exact list of RRM tests for UE and gNB can only be determined once
the core requirements are settled.
### 10.1.2 Testability of NR RRM requirements on frequency bands below 6GHz
For low frequency bands below 6GHz, the conducted testing is considered as the
baseline approach for NR RRM testability.
If BS RRM requirements and test scenarios are developed, the re-use of the AAS
BS measurement setup can be investigated.
NR RRM testing can generally be performed using the antenna connectors and
following similar approaches as are applicable for E-UTRA UE or eNB below 6
GHz. The exact details of the tests shall be determined when the tests are
implemented.
It is possible that for some specific features of NR such as beamforming, over
the air tests developed for frequency bands above 6GHz (as in section 10.1.3)
could be reused on frequency bands below 6GHz in order to avoid the need to
develop both OTA and conducted tests for beam based measurements.
### 10.1.3 Testability of NR RRM requirements on frequency bands above 6GHz
For frequency bands above 6GHz (e.g. mm-wave), conducted antenna connectors
are assumed not to be available at DUT and the OTA testing is considered as
the baseline approach for NR RRM testability.
The possibility of performing conducted tests using an intermediate frequency
(IF) were evaluated. It was decided that this approach would be challenging to
standardise for various reasons since IF is an internal interface in the DUT
and using a standardised IF (signal level, number of IF ports, IF frequency,
etc.) would preclude many different DUT implementations including direct
conversion receivers. In addition, IF testing excludes all components which
operate at the radio frequency such as RF filters, duplexers, transmit receive
switch, low noise amplifier (LNA), power amplifier (PA), analogue beamforming
phase shifting elements etc., and the algorithms which control such components
from the test.
#### 10.1.3.1 Over the air testing
Further details of a suitable OTA test environment are to be discussed in the
work item, and may have impact to the core requirements which are defined. For
example, side conditions for the applicability of core requirements should be
defined in a way in which they can be ensured in an OTA environment.
The baseline measurement setup of NR RRM characteristics for f > 6 GHz is
capable of establishing an OTA link between the DUT and a number of emulated
gNB sources and is shown in Figure 10.1.3.1-1 below.
Diagram TBD
Figure 10.1.3.1-1: Baseline measurement setup of RRM characteristics
The RRM baseline measurement setup shares all aspects in common with the UE RF
setup defined in 10.2.2.1 and includes the following aspects in addition:
\- A positioning system such that the angle between the N antennas (N ≥ 2)
transmitting the emulated gNB sources and the DUT has at least two axes of
freedom
\- Where N corresponds to the maximum number of emulated gNB sources defined
in the RRM test scenarios
\- It is desirable that at least 1 antenna provides for an angular
relationship with the DUT that is independently controllable (or the setup
should provide equivalent functionality)
\- It is FFS whether all N antennas need to provide independently controllable
angular relationships
\- Requirements on the polarization properties and control of each antenna are
FFS
\- It is likely that the measurement uncertainty budget for the RRM setup may
contain additional measurement uncertainty elements relative to the setup
defined in 10.2.2.1
\- It is FFS how to model propagation conditions between the DUT and the
emulated gNB sources
If BS RRM requirements and test scenarios are developed, the re-use of the AAS
BS measurement setup can be investigated.
## 10.2 UE RF requirements testability
### 10.2.1 General
It is reasonable to expect a high level of integration of high-frequency NR
devices (e.g., devices operating above 6 GHz). Such highly integrated
architectures may feature innovative front-end solutions, multi-element
antenna arrays, passive and active feeding networks, etc. that may not be able
to physically expose a front-end cable connector to the test equipment.
For UE RF test methodology at low frequency (f ≤ 6 GHz), the UE testing
methodology (i.e., conducted test) from LTE (TS 36.101) can be reused even in
case of non-standalone (NSA) with control channel communicated via a high
frequency band (f > 6 GHz).
For UE RF test methodology at high frequency (f > 6 GHz), the following
general aspects apply:
\- OTA measurement is the baseline testing methodology for UE RF at high
frequency (f > 6 GHz)
\- Possible optimizations, such as near-field approximation or others, are not
precluded; such optimizations shall demonstrate methodology equivalence to the
baseline
### 10.2.2 Testability of UE RF TX and RX characteristics -- without test
interface control of beam direction
#### 10.2.2.1 Baseline measurement setup: centre and off centre of beam
measurement setup
The baseline measurement setup of UE RF characteristics for f > 6 GHz is
capable of centre and off centre of beam measurements and is shown in Figure
10.2.2.1-1 below.
{width="6.694444444444445in" height="5.090277777777778in"}
Figure 10.2.2.1-1: Baseline measurement setup of UE RF characteristics
The key aspects of the baseline setup are:
\- Far-field measurement system in an anechoic chamber
\- The criterion for determining the far-field distance is TBD
\- A positioning system such that the angle between the dual-polarized
measurement antenna and the DUT has at least two axes of freedom and maintains
a polarization reference
\- A positioning system such that the angle between the link antenna and the
DUT has at least two axes of freedom and maintains a polarization reference;
this positioning system for the link antenna is in addition to the positioning
system for the measurement antenna and provides for an angular relationship
independently controllable from the measurement antenna
Alternate test methodologies are not precluded and may exist for each
requirement. They shall demonstrate equivalence according to the criteria
outlined in 10.2.2.3.
#### 10.2.2.2 Centre of beam measurement setup
The baseline setup in 10.2.2.1 can be simplified in the following way to
perform centre of the beam measurements:
\- The measurement and the link antenna can be combined so that the single
antenna is used to steer the beam and to perform UE RF measurements.
The measurement setup of UE RF characteristics for f > 6 GHz capable of centre
of beam measurements and is shown in Figure 10.2.2.2-1 below
{width="6.694444444444445in" height="5.291666666666667in"}
Figure 10.2.2.2-1: Centre of beam measurement setup of UE RF characteristics
Alternate test methodologies are not precluded and may exist for each
requirement. They shall demonstrate equivalence according to the criteria
outlined in 10.2.2.3.
#### 10.2.2.3 Equivalence Criteria
The following 11 points have been agreed as a framework for developing OTA
test to prove equivalence.
1) Multiple test methods may exist for each requirement
2) Each test method will require its own test procedure.
3) A single conformance requirement applies for each core requirement,
regardless of test procedure.
4) Common maximum accepted test system uncertainty applies for all test
methods addressing the same test requirement. Test methods producing
significantly worse uncertainty than others at comparable cost should not
impact the common maximum accepted test system uncertainty assessment.
5) Common test tolerances apply for all test methods addressing the same test
requirement.
6) A common way of establishing the uncertainty result from all test methods\'
individual budgets is established.
7) A common method of making an uncertainty budget (not a common uncertainty
budget) is established.
8) Establish budget format examples for each addressed test method in the form
of lists of uncertainty contributions. Contributions that may be negligible
with some DUT and substantial with others should be in this list. For each
combination of measurement method and test parameter (EIRP or EIS) develop a
list with measurement uncertainties.
9) Describe potential OTA test methods relevant for testing radiated transmit
power and OTA sensitivity. The description requires information about the test
range architecture and test procedure. Addressing each item in each
uncertainty budget with respect to the expected distribution of the errors,
the mechanism creating the error and how it interacts with properties of the
DUT.
10) Providing example uncertainty budgets in the TS will be useful in order to
demonstrate the way a budget should be defined and how calculating its
resulting measurement uncertainty is done, but the figures used in the
examples will clearly be only examples and not applicable in general.
11) Each test instance may require an individual uncertainty budget applicable
for the combination of the test facility, the DUT and the test procedure and
property tested. Here, the tester demonstrates that the uncertainty
requirement is fulfilled during the conformance testing.
#### 10.2.2.4 Far Field Criteria for the baseline measurement setup
The minimum far-field distance R for a traditional far field anechoic chamber
can be calculated based on the following equation: where D is the diameter of
the smallest sphere that encloses the radiating parts of the DUT. The near/far
field boundary for different antenna sizes and frequencies is shown in Table
10.2.2.4-1.
Table 10.2.2.4-1: Near field/far field boundary for different frequencies and
antenna sizes for a traditional far field anechoic chamber
**D(cm)** **Frequency (GHz)** **Near/far boundary (cm)** **Path Loss(dB)**
**Frequency (GHz)** **Near/far boundary (cm)** **Path Loss(dB)**

6000 108
As can be seen in the table, the distance can be very large for larger antenna
sizes and higher frequencies. This could lead to very large chambers that
would be prohibitively expensive.
Generally, the exact antenna size of the DUT is unknown since the device will
be in its own casing during the test and this also depends on other factors
such as ground coupling effects that depend on the design. The largest device
size (e.g. diagonal) could be used; however, this would lead to very large
chambers even for relatively small devices. A practical way to determine the
far field distance is needed.
In [R4-168320], [R4-1700955], it was proposed to determine the testing
distance based on a manufacturer declaration. One of the risks of this
approach is that a distance shorter than the actual far field is chose. It
should be further studied whether this could lead to underperforming devices
passing the tests due to measurement inaccuracies (e.g. whether a shorter
distance will lead to better measurement results than the actual far field
distance).
In [R4-1700531] an experimental method was proposed to determine the far field
distance based on path loss measurements. This method is based on the fact
that the path loss exponent is different in the near field and the far field.
By measuring the path loss gradient over a certain distance, the near/far
field boundary could be found. The results of an experiment conducted on a
Band 3 LTE device are shown in Figure 10.2.2.4-1. The minimum far field
distance can be found at the regression intercept point.

Figure 10.2.2.4-1: LTE UE FDD band 3 measurements to determine the minimum
far-field distance.
The figure shows an example result for the case where the frequency is 1.85
GHz. The approximate device dimensions were 13 x 8 cm. Under these conditions,
the canonical minimum far-field distance would be 28.7 cm. According to this
method, the minimum measurement distance would be 13.8 cm. Further work is
required to determine whether this technique provides valid results for much
higher frequencies and general device types.
Methods to reduce measurement distance for AAS are Compact Antenna Test Range,
One Dimensional Compact Range, and Near Field Test Range which are all listed
in [21]. These may be used for NR provided they meet the equivalence criteria
relative to the baseline measurement setup. Other methods are not precluded.
#### 10.2.2.5 OTA measurements in the radiative near field
In this sub-clause we discuss measurements of TRP in the radiative near field
for both the wanted channel and unwanted emissions.
TRP is a measure of how much power is radiated by radiating device. TRP is a
parameter associated to an active measurement, meaning that TRP is associated
to a system consisting of antenna and transmitter. The total power is
calculated as the power sum over all possible angles (θ, ϕ). To describe the
spatial angles a Cartesian coordinate system according to Figure 10.2.2.5-1 is
introduced. The θ angle is defined within the interval
0[\90% of channel bandwidth".
### 11.2.4 Transmitter characteristics
#### 11.2.4.1 Power dynamic range
It was agreed in [32] that for the WP5D response, the BS Power dynamic range
will be "0 dB for conducted BS output power".
It was proposed in [32] that for the WP5D response, the UE Power dynamic range
will be based on assumed minimum and maximum conducted output power of a UE.
This was in the LS response [31] further clarified to be 63 dB, based on -40
dBm minimum and 23 dBm maximum conducted output power of a UE.
#### 11.2.4.2 Spectral mask
For the BS unwanted emissions, the following baseline for a spectrum mask was
used [34]:
\- For the ITU-R response "transmission centric" Spectrum Emissions Mask (SEM)
will be used
\- The SEM is applicable for a 200 MHz channel bandwidth
\- The SEM extends out to 500 MHz from the center of transmission
\- A measurement bandwidth of 1 MHz is used
\- The emissions limits should have the new limits in FCC Title 47, §30.203 as
a baseline [17].
The following was further agreed for the BS spectrum mask in [33]:
\- Two masks are defined for BS SEM, based on scenario:
\- Indoor
\- Outdoor (Urban hotspot, Suburban hotspot)
\- Outdoor mask levels (at 30 GHz, based on ACLR = 27.5 dB)
\- For for PTx ≥ 34.5 dBm
\- FCC limits
\- For PTx \ [0.0145707+0.00223568i; 0.0166021+0.0884597i; -0.170987-0.889998i;

B) Memory Polynomial
Volterra series version that reduces the number of parameters to be
determined. MP decreases the overall system complexity while still maintaining
the accuracy of the memory effects description. Before modelling, input and
output samples must be aligned. Signal correlation is the most common method
to synchronize time series. After alignment and normalization, a part of the
samples is used to calculate the coefficients of matrix A in equation below
> $Y = X*A$
The coefficients can be extracted using the LMS algorithm, which is explained
in further detail in [26]. Memory effects and nonlinear distortion can
significantly reduce the output signal quality and therefore, degrade the
overall system performance. Depending on the frequency range of the signal
transmission, the inclusion of memory effects can be crucial for developing a
useable and realistic model. Therefore, the models of a PA operating below 6
GHz and another PA operating above 6 GHz will be shown.
PA model below 6 GHz
The PA model was simulated in Matlab using the measurement results from an
Intel PA. An OFDM signal with a carrier frequency of 2.44 GHz was fed to the
amplifier. Both the I(t) and Q(t) from the input and output signals PA were
used to develop a model based on a memory polynomial implementation. The terms
used for the evaluation of this model were polynomial degree K with a value of
5 and the polynomial memory depth M with a value of 5. The low value of both
terms enabled a fast computational time and ensured good adaptive performance
of the algorithm, which resulted in a very near approximation of the modelled
output signal to the original output signal.

Figure A.1-9 Power Spectral Density at 2.44 GHz

Figure A.1-10 Input Signal VS Output Signal at 2.44 GHz
This can be perceived in Figure A.1-9 and Figure A.1-10 where the Power
Spectral Density (PSD) and the input versus the output signal have been
plotted based on the number of samples of the measured PA fitted to the
simulation model. In both figures the red curves represent the model estimated
data and the blue curve the original measurement data. We can find the two
traces of PSD fit very well in pass band and adjacent channel. The average
error in dB between value of PSD of measured data and that of model output is
less than 0.3 dB.
To evaluate the performance of the MP model, the average normalized mean
square error (NMSE) has been calculated, which is the most common metric to
evaluate models performance. The NMSE is calculated with following equation,
where $y$ represents the measured data and $y_{\text{est}}$ represents the
model data.
$\text{NMSE}\ = 10*\log\frac{\sum_{}^{}{{|\ y - y_{\text{est}}|}^{2}\
}}{\sum_{}^{}{{|\ y|}^{2}\ }}$
The calculated value for the NMSE is -67 dB which is much better than the
traditional NMSE values of around -38 dB. In Figure A.1-10 it can be seen that
the memory effects generate diffusion region and based on these results we
propose the use of a memory polynomial model to implement the PA model below 6
GHz considering the memory effects.
The memory parameter calculated with the model are the following:
M = 5, K = 5,\ a~km~ = [ 20.0875 + 0.4240i, -6.3792 - 0.5507i, 0.5809 +

PA model for above 6 GHz
The memory polynomial has been utilized as well for above 6 GHz. The PA model
for above 6 GHz was implemented by using the 28nm CMOS PA at 31 GHz designed
by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KUL) [2]. A 16-QAM Single Carrier
signal was fed to the amplifier. Since we consider that a PA operated in
mmWave bands shall support a wider bandwidth compared to a PA below 6 GHz, the
memory effects are expected to be more crucial. By this, we see an increase of
the complexity to model the nonlinearities. In other words, the calculation
effort will be more costly than in the case of the PA below 6 GHz, where the
memory effects are not so dominant.

Figure A.1-12 Input Signal VS Output Signal at 31 GHz.
The polynomial degree K used for this PA was 8 and polynomial memory depth M
value was 5. The memory polynomial allows the use of high K and M terms for
calculating the matrix coefficients but with a less computer complexity
compared to Volterra series.
In A.1-11 and A.1-12 the Power Spectral Density (PSD) and the input versus the
output signal have been plotted for the 31 GHz PA. The PSD shows more spectral
regrowth compared to the PA below 6 GHz. In both figures the red curves
represent the model estimated data and the blue curve the original measurement
data. We can find the two traces of PSD fit also very well in pass band and
adjacent channel. The average error in dB between value of PSD of measured
data and that of model output is less than 1 dB. The calculated value of NMSE
for this PA model is -- 39 dB.
In Figure A.1.-12 it can be seen when including the memory effects that the
characteristic of the PA behave no longer as a curve but rather as a diffusion
region. These memory effects increase the calculation time to estimate the
matrix coefficients of the memory polynomial and accurately model the PA.

###### ### ** **Annex C: Array antenna theory
In general, an array antenna design consists of several parts; radiating
elements, a finite ground plane and mechanical structure components. The
elements are typically placed in a lattice on the ground plane. The individual
location of each element together with the radiation characteristics of each
element determines the composite array antenna characteristics.
The element characteristics in terms of radiation properties (aka. element
factor) depends on the area for which the array antenna is intended to provide
coverage within.
In general, for a single polarized element, the individual embedded element
pattern for an array antenna with N elements is described as:
{width="0.7638888888888888in" height="0.25in"} , where n=1..N.
An array antenna consists of many radiating elements located close to each
other under a weather proof encapsulation. The locations of the n-th element
in an antenna array can be described by; {width="1.0833333333333333in"
height="0.25in"}.
For the transceiver direction, each element in the array antenna is feed with
a signal s(t) from a transmitter. The array antenna beam is determined by the
weighting factor w~n~(t).
For a single polarized array antenna, the transmitted signal is created from
super positioning in the far-field region. The composite field strength can be
expressed as:
, where {width="0.1597222222222222in" height="0.18055555555555555in"}is the
wave vector defined as:
{width="4.333333333333333in" height="0.4305555555555556in"}
The wave vector refers to a vector that describes the phase variation of a
plane wave, in 3 orthogonal directions.
Since elements are located close to each other the radiation characteristics
for individual elements will not be the same in the whole array. This
phenomenon is referred to as mutual coupling. That means that the element
factor R, cannot be seen independent of the element separation. The element
separation also relates to radiation characteristics by means of spatial
sampling resolution. Typically, for an array implementation where the element
separation is larger than 0.5λ, gating lobe performance will be affected.
Generally, the maximum steering without grating lobes can be expressed as:
{width="1.1458333333333333in" height="0.4722222222222222in"}, where d is the
element separation and ϕ~max~ is the maximal steering angle (along one
dimension).
If the spatial sampling criterion is not fulfilled folding effect will occur
creating a grating lobe response. Therefore, the element separation often is
set close to 0.5λ for system using large steering angles. However, when the
elements are close the interaction between them is more severe, which results
in ripple in radiation pattern per element level. Therefore, the element beam-
width will be different. The element directivity is dependent on the element
aperture which is of course effected by the element spacing, i.e. a 0.7λ
element cannot be spaced at 0.5λ. Hence the interaction between element
separation and element radiation characteristics is a delicate challenge to
resolve. Typical element separation is in the range of 0.5λ to 0.7λ. The
consequence of grating lobes is that energy will be spread in unintended
direction, this may or may not be harmful for the system from an interference
perspective. Nevertheless, the power in the intended direction drops because
of large grating lobes. From a system design perspective, grating lobes, and
the fact that the effective antenna area is reduced due to projection will
reduce the directivity. This phenomenon is referred to as scan-loss. The scan-
loss will impact EIRP in the intended direction. This effect needs
considerations from a system perspective.
This means that the radiated power is a complex function of deployment
parameters such as steering angle and design parameters such as antenna mutual
coupling. A common phenomenon is referred to as scan-blindness, where EIRP
drops unexpectedly due to interactions between coupling characteristics and
excitation of the array. Note that EIRP can be affected by both scan-loss and
scan-blindness at large steering angles, which means that the radiated power
will drop considerably.
Another aspect is that radiation the individual radiation patterns or embedded
radiation pattern will suffer from mutual coupling. The embedded pattern is
distorted with a ripple, where characteristics such as beam pointing direction
and beam-width may be impacted.
A simple and ideal, but still quite realistic, model for the element pattern
should satisfy the earlier explained relation:
{width="1.5416666666666667in" height="0.24305555555555555in"}
Written as power, or gain, patterns, the array antenna gain can be expressed
as:
{width="4.041666666666667in" height="0.3055555555555556in"}
If the element distances in the array are small enough to not produce any
grating lobes, and the array is a planar array, the maximum array gain for any
scan angle should equate the gain of a planar aperture, i.e.
{width="1.0833333333333333in" height="0.4305555555555556in"}, where A is the
total area of the antenna array and φ is the angle off the normal direction.
Here we also neglect all losses related to reflections and mutual coupling.
The factor cos(φ) comes from the projection of the array area as seen in the
direction of observation. Maximum array gain is achieved when all elements
have the same amplitude, and are co-phased in the scan direction, i.e. the
array factor.
{width="1.6388888888888888in" height="0.5416666666666666in"}
This implies that the element factor should be:
{width="2.6805555555555554in" height="0.4583333333333333in"}, where $d_{x}$
and $d_{y}$ are the element distances in x and y direction. The 3 dB beamwidth
thus becomes {width="1.8402777777777777in"
height="0.22916666666666666in"}degrees and the maximum element gain for an
array with 0.5λ element spacing is π, or \~5 dBi.
In practice, however, the 3 dB beam width is lower than 120°, typically around
90° to 100°. This discrepancy to the theoretical 120° 3 dB beam width derived
above is partly due to power loss from mutual coupling effects, which
typically gets higher for larger scan angles. The element pattern beam width
should also be related to the element gain, since element gain is only a
measure on how focused the energy is in the far-field. An approximate formula
for planar arrays [x], relating the gain and beam widths is
{width="1.5277777777777777in" height="0.4722222222222222in"}, where HPBW~1~
and HPBW~1~ are the 3dB beam widths in two orthogonal planes. Combining this
way of calculating the maximum gain with the above expression relating the
maximum element gain with the antenna area yields
{width="0.9930555555555556in" height="0.6458333333333334in"} [degrees] and
{width="1.0in" height="0.6805555555555556in"} [degrees]\ A practical element
pattern model could be a Gaussian pattern with peak gain equal to
{width="1.2916666666666667in" height="0.4583333333333333in"}
and beam widths related to the element distance as described above. This model
would thus to some degree account for reflection and mutual coupling losses
for large scan angles and losses due to grating lobes. It also scales the
antenna element patterns gain and beam widths with the element spacing of the
array in such a way that the superposition of all the elements in the array
gives a total antenna gain equal to the array area.
###### ### Annex D: prerequisites for assessment UE beamforming performance
In this annex we list the prerequisites for the assessment of beamforming
performance with 4 and 8 antennas at 15 GHz. The purpose is to indicate the
ballpark gains of UL beamforming and how these gains change under different
channel conditions, precoding and CSI feedback. The metrics for evaluation are
the increase of the wanted UL signal power at the connected BS and any
interference reduction seen at the other BS. The _channel model_ is as
follows: each realization of the channel is a superposition of
\- Nray pairs of rays
\- a pair of rays is a model of a path between the BS equipped with two
orthogonally polarized antennas (or rather beams) and the UE
\- each ray is dual polarized with the two polarizations subject to
independent Rayleigh fading
\- the angle-of-arrival AOA (= AOD) is randomly selected per pair; the azimuth
distribution is uniform $\lbrack - 180^{{^\circ}}180^{{^\circ}}\rbrack\ $and
the elevation angle is uniform $\lbrack 60^{{^\circ}}\ 90^{{^\circ}}\rbrack$
(see description of the UE antenna patterns below)
\- all antennas on the UE see the same type of channel but channel responses
differ due to different locations, orientations and polarizations for the UE
antennas, which means that different UE antennas see different sub-channels.
Elevation angles in the range $\lbrack 60^{{^\circ}}\ 90^{{^\circ}}\rbrack$
has been assumed and evaluated for this study; this does not imply any
restriction on the UE antenna patterns in general.
Furthermore, a channel realization consists of a set of 1, 10 or 50 pairs of
rays. Each pair has the same direction (assuming dual polarized BS antenna)
but the polarizations are subject to independent fading modeled as a complex
Gaussian. The directions for the pairs of rays are independent from each
other. The received signal per UE antenna is the coherent sum of the antenna
responses for all rays, see Figure D-1.
{width="1.5208333333333333in" height="1.8680555555555556in"}
Figure D-1: received DL signal as a coherent sum of dual-polarized rays.
In the frequency domain a block fading channel has been assumed with either 1
block (narrowband) or 25 blocks, where the fading is independent between the
blocks. The total power over all the block(s) is observed at the BS.
The _precoding_ for UL transmissions is based on either reciprocity or
feedback. We assume that the hardware is reciprocal w r t UL and DL.
For reciprocity the following precoders are evaluated for transmission based
on reciprocity:
1\. Maximum ratio transmission (MRT) for which the precoder $w_{\text{MRT}}$
is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the channel
correlation matrix
2\. Phase-only (PO) precoding with $w_{PO,k} = w_{MRT,k}.\frac{1}{\left|
w_{MRT,k} \right|}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n_{\text{UE}}}}$ where $n_{\text{UE}}$ is the
number of UE antennas, i.e. the phase-only precoder is constant modulus where
the phase component is given by $w_{\text{MRT}}$
3\. Antenna selection (AS): select the strongest antenna per block
For reference, the performance for a single isotropic antenna is evaluated.
The precoder codebooks for closed-loop beamforming have been defined for rank
= 1 only, where the constellation is based on QPSK, i.e. four different phases
and equal amplitude. Two types of precoders have been devised:
1\. Codebook type 1 for no correlation between antennas (channels), antennas
2\. Codebook type 2 for a combination of full correlation and no correlation
between antennas (channels), the codebook sizes 16, 32 and 64 evaluated for 4
and 8
Two types of _power distribution (PA configuration)_ have been evaluated:
1\. Common resource (Com), the total output power is limited
2\. Distributed resource (Dist), the total output power is equally shared
between antennas; the available, but not necessarily used, output power per
antenna in this case is $Ptot/n_{\text{UE}}$
The precoders are normalized such that the magnitude is unity for common PA,
whereas the maximum magnitude per PA is 1/sqrt(n~UE~) for distributed PAs. The
total output power is the same no matter the number of antennas; the radiated
power depends on the precoder configured and the PA configuration. The
distributed resource is more likely at mm-wave frequencies with the PA closer
to the antenna to reduce feeder losses, see Figure 6.2.1.1.3-1. The PO
precoder is designed with this architecture in mind.
The _UE prototype_ is of a smartphone form factor as shown in Figure D-2 with
the antennas indicated by the blue circles along the y-axis.

Figure D-2: antenna arrangement on the UE.
A sample pattern of one of the eight antenna elements is shown in Figure D-3
for the two polarization planes. The black rectangle indicates the evaluation
area considered in this study: the pairs of rays in the channel model are
launched such that the AOA in the DL (AOD in UL) is uniform $\lbrack -
180^{{^\circ}}180^{{^\circ}}\rbrack\ $in azimuth and uniform in $\lbrack
60^{{^\circ}}\ 90^{{^\circ}}\rbrack$ in elevation.
{width="4.284722222222222in" height="3.4583333333333335in"}
Figure D-3: sample pattern of one of the UE antenna elements.
Shadowing by a user (taking the measurement) is also noticeable: encircled in
red is the area where the user is shadowing, which leads to a lower gain
measured roughly between 240 and 300 degrees in azimuth.
The _metric for evaluation_ is the total power in the UE at the 50% level.
Figure D-4 shows the results at line-of-sight (LOS) for which the direction
for one pair of rays (the direct path) uniformly distributed in the evaluation
area indicated in Figure D-3. The precoding is based on reciprocity. The
median gain relative to the "maximum element gain" is 7.5 dB and we observe a
0.8 dB difference between MRT and PO precoding.
The dotted curves indicate the performance in the shadowed region between 240
and 300 degrees azimuth, the gain is then lower than that achieved by a
theoretical isotropic antenna (only a single antenna at the UE).

The following aspects are necessary:
\- A basic understanding of the top and bottom of the device is needed in
order to define unambiguous DUT positioning requirements for the test
\- An understanding of the origin of the test system (i.e. the direction in
which the x-axis points inside the test chamber) is needed in order to define
unambiguous DUT orientation, DUT beam, signal, interference, and measurement
angles
## E.2 Test conditions and angle definitions
Table E.2-1 below provides the test conditions and angle definitions.

SINR operating range and mapping function
The following equations approximate the throughput over a channel with a given
SNIR, when using link adaptation:
$$\text{Throughput\ }\left( \text{SNIR} \right),\ bps/Hz\ = \left{
\begin{matrix} 0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ \ for\ SNIR\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \propto \bullet S\left( \text{SNIR} \right)\text{\ \ \ \ \
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ for\ SNI}R_{\text{MIN}} \leq SNIR <
SNIR_{\text{MAX}}\ \ \propto \bullet S\left( \text{SNI}R_{\text{MAX}} \right)\
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ for\ SNIR\ \geq \ SNIR_{\text{MAX}}\text{\ \ \ \ \
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } \ \end{matrix} \right.\ $$
Where:
S(SNIR) Shannon bound, S(SNIR) =log~2~(1+SNIR) [bps/Hz]\ α Attenuation factor,
representing implementation losses\ SNIR~MIN~ Minimum SNIR of the code set,
dB\ SNIR~MAX~ Maximum SNIR of the code set, dB
The parameters α, SNIR~MIN~ and SNIR~MAX~ can be chosen to represent different
modem implementations and link conditions. The parameters proposed in table 9
represent a baseline case, which assumes:
\- 1:1 antenna configurations
\- AWGN channel model
\- Link Adaptation (see table 9 for details of the highest and lowest rate
codes)
\- No HARQ
