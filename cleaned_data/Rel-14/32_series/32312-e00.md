# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.311: Generic Integration Reference Point (IRP) management; Requirements
**32.312: Generic Integration Reference Point (IRP) management; Information
Service (IS)**
32.316: Generic Integration Reference Point (IRP) management; Solution Set
(SS) Definitions
The Itf-N interface is built up by a number of IRPs and a related Name
Convention, which realise the functional capabilities over this interface. The
basic structure of the IRPs is defined in TS 32.101 [1] and TS 32.102 [2].
All IRPs support a set of generic features. Those features allow to retrieve
IRP profile and IRP supported versions.\ The present document contains the
specification of those generic features.
# 1 Scope
The purpose of the present document is to define a common service supported by
all IRPs such as AlarmIRP. The present document is the \"Information Service\"
part. It defines, for the purpose of supporting the common service, the
information observable and controllable by management system\'s client (i.e.
IRPManager) via the Itf-N.\ It also specifies the semantics of and the
interactions used to carry this information.
With this common service supported by all IRPs, an IRPManager can retrieve the
profile of operations and notifications supported by a given IRP name-
contained by an IRPAgent. An IRPManager can also retrieve the IRPVersions
supported by a given IRP.

{width="5.986805555555556in" height="2.3569444444444443in"}
## 6.2 Generic rules
**\- Rule 1:** each operation with at least one input parameter supports a
pre-condition valid_input_parameter which indicates that all input parameters
shall be valid with regards to their information type. Additionally, each such
operation supports an exception operation_failed_invalid_input_parameter which
is raised when pre-condition valid_input_parameter is false. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
**\- Rule 2:** Each operation with at least one optional input parameter
supports a set of pre-conditions supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx where
\"xxx\" is the name of the optional input parameter and the pre-condition
indicates that the operation supports the named optional input parameter.
Additionally, each such operation supports an exception
operation_failed_unsupported_optional_input_parameter_xxx which is raised when
(a) the pre-condition supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx is false and (b)
the named optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
**\- Rule 3:** each operation shall support a generic exception
operation_failed_internal_problem which is raised when an internal problem
occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception has the same
entry and exit state.
## 6.3 genericIRPVersionOperations Interface (M)
### 6.3.1 Operation getIRPVersion (M)
#### 6.3.1.1 Definition
IRPManager wishes to find out the IRP SS versions supported by an IRP. The IRP
shall respond with a set of supported IRP SS version(s). The list of returned
IRPVersions is such that the IRPManager can use any of these versions without
having to specify an IRPVersion to the IRPAgent.

### 6.4.2 Operation getNotificationProfile (O)
#### 6.4.2.1 Definition
IRPManager invokes this operation to query the detailed notification profile
of an IRP (supported notifications and supported parameters) for a specific
supported version. The notification profile will provide details about
notifications that are specifically defined by this IRP. For example, if this
IRP is notification IRP R4, then getNotificationProfile will not return any
information since no notification is defined in notification IRP R4.
