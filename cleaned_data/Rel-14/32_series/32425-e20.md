The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor E-UTRAN and EPC
system.
During the lifetime of an E-UTRAN, its logical and physical configuration will
undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise the
utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed through
network configuration management activities and/or network engineering, see TS
32.600 [3].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of an E-UTRAN require data on which to base decisions. This data
refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In
order to produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs,
which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external
system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further
evaluation. The purpose of the present document is to describe the mechanisms
involved in the collection of the data and the definition of the data itself.
Annex B of TS 32.404 helps in the definition of new performance measurements
that can be submitted to 3GPP for potential adoption and inclusion in the
present document. Annex B of TS 32.404 discusses a top-down performance
measurement definition methodology that focuses on how the end-user of
performance measurements can use the measurements.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements for E-UTRAN.
TS 32.401 [5] describes Performance Management concepts and requirements.
The present document is valid for all measurement types provided by an
implementation of an E-UTRAN.
Only measurement types that are specific to E-UTRAN are defined within the
present documents. Vendor specific measurement types used in E-UTRAN are not
covered. Instead, these could be applied according to manufacturer\'s
documentation.
Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as ATM or IP) as
described by \"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or IETF) shall only be
referenced within this specification, wherever there is a need identified for
the existence of such a reference.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
The structure of the present document is as follows:
\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. measurements related to eNodeB);
\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. RRC connection setup related
measurements);
\- Header 3: Measurements.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication and/or
edition number or version number) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

##### 4.3.1.3.3 Number of handover failures related with MRO
a) This measurement provides the number of outgoing handover related events
that fail related with MRO. Handover related events include normal successful
handovers and all failure events by which a UE in RRC connected state changes
its serving cell without following a normal handover. Different MRO failure
cases are found in [12]. The measurement includes separate counters for the
number of handover failures classified as "too early", "too late" and "to
wrong cell". The measurement for the too late handover is split to subcounters
indicating the threshold of the serving cell itself was not crossed and the
threshold of the neighbour cell was not crossed in UE measurements before
handover in case the handover is triggered by more than one threshold of the
measurement report triggering events, the subcounters are only needed if more
than one threshold of the measurement report triggering events is used and
using single or multiple thresholds is vendor specific.
b) CC
c) The measurements of too early handovers, too late handovers and to wrong
cell handovers are obtained respectively by accumulating the number of
_failure events related to handover which_ are identified by the eNB according
to the definitions in TS 36.300 [12].\ \ Besides being added to the
measurement of total too late handovers, each too late handover (identified by
the eNB according to the definitions in TS 36.300 [12]) is also added to the
relevant subcounter indicating the threshold of the serving cell itself
configured in the measurement report triggering events (see 36.331 [18]) was
not crossed or the threshold of the neighbour cell configured in the
measurement report triggering events was not crossed if more than one
threshold triggering a measurement report is configured to the UEs for the
involved neighbour relation and the following UE measurement results are
available for both cells involved in the too late handover\ \- rsrpResult of
"measResultLastServCell" and\ \- rsrpResult of the subject neighbour cell in
"measResultNeighCells"\ in\ a) the "RLF report" IE in the received RRC message
"UEInformationResponse" (see 36.331 [18]), in case both cells involved in the
too late handover belong to the same eNB,\ or\ b) the "UE RLF Report
Container" IE in the received X2 message "RLF Indication", in case the cells
involved in the too late handover belong to different eNBs.\ The uncrossed
threshold (of the serving itself and the neighbour) is identified by comparing
the UE measurement results above with the configured thresholds (adding the
corresponding hysteresis, see 36.331 [18]) of the measurement report
triggering events,\ \- if the threshold of the serving cell itself was not
crossed, the observed too late handover is then added to the subcounter
(HO.OutFail.TooLateOwnNotCrossed) indicating the threshold of the serving cell
was not crossed\ \- if the threshold of the neighbor cell itself was not
crossed, the observed too late handover is then added to the subcounter
(HO.OutFail.TooLateNeighborNotCrossed) indicating the threshold of the
neighbour cell was not crossed\ \- if the thresholds of both the serving cell
itself and the neighbour cell were not crossed, then this too late handover is
added to both subcounters (HO.OutFail.TooLateOwnNotCrossed and
HO.OutFail.TooLateNeighborNotCrossed) indicating the threshold of serving cell
itself was not crossed and the threshold of the neighbour cell was not
crossed\ \- if no threshold was not crossed, then this handover is only added
to the measurement of total too late handovers but not to the subcounter
indicating the threshold of the serving cell itself was not crossed or the
threshold of the neighbour cell was not crossed.\ If only one threshold
triggring the measurement report is configured to the UEs for the involved
neighbour relation or the UE measurements above are not available, the
observed too late handover is only added to the measurement of total too late
handovers but not to the subcounter indicating the threshold of the serving
cell itself was not crossed or the threshold of the neighbour cell was not
crossed.
d) Each measurement is an integer value.
e) The measurements are named
HO.OutFail.TooEarly
HO.OutFail.TooLate\ Which indicates the total number of too late handovers
identified by the eNB according to the definitions in TS 36.300 [12].

e) MR.Rsrp._y_ . _y_ is an integer from 00 to 47.\ Note:\ 00 of y indicates

>
> \- Initial access after radio link failure;
>
> \- Handover requiring random access procedure;
>
> \- DL data arrival during RRC_CONNECTED requiring random access procedure;
>
> \- UL data arrival during RRC_CONNECTED requiring random access procedure;
Furthermore, the random access procedure takes two distinct forms:
> \- Contention based using a randomly selected preamble (applicable to all
> five events);

In the use-case of RACH configuration optimization, received Random Access
Preambles and a contention indicator are signalled across an OAM interface.
Monitoring of the preamble usage in a cell allows the operator to determine if
the resources allocated to the RACH by the eNodeB are appropriate for the
number of random access attempts. If the resources are underutilised then the
operator may reconfigure the eNodeB (via CM) to allocate less resource to RACH
thereby freeing up resource for other uplink transmissions. Alternatively, if
the resources are heavily utilised then this is indicative of RACH congestion
leading to increased latency for the procedures listed above. To this effect,
measurements directly reflecting RACH congestion experienced by the eNodeB and
by the UEs are useful.
The eNodeB can partition the RACH resource between dedicated preambles,
randomly selected preambles in group A and randomly selected preambles in
group B. This partitioning can be evaluated when usage measurements are made
on each set separately.
To further monitor and analyze the latency of the procedures listed above
created at the RACH level, the measurement of the number of RACH preambles
sent per RACH attempt is useful.
RACH optimisation function optimises RACH related configurations to achieve
minimizing of access delays and random access collision probability for all
the UEs. eNB may request the UEs to report the number of attempts to access
the network (numberOfPreamblesSent in TS 36.331 [8]). Based on the attempting
number of random access of all the UEs, the eNB can know the distribution of
RACH preambles sent by UEs and calculate the access probability (AP) of a cell
accurately. The eNB may also request the UEs to report contention detected
while attempting to access the network (contentionDetected in TS 36.331 [8]).
Based on the estimated time per random access and the estimated contention
level in the network, the eNB can estimate the access delay probability (ADP)
of a cell.
# A.6 Monitor of the number of connected users
The number of the connected users in each cell is valuable information for
operators to know how many uses are connecting to E-UTRAN per cell basis. This
kind of information can help operator to tune the admission control parameters
for the cell and to do load balancing between cells to ensure that the target
percentage or number the of users admitted achieve the target QoS.
# A.7 Monitoring of interference situation
In the LTE radio technology interference has to be coordinated on the basis
uplink and downlink i.e. in a coordinated usage of the UL resources (Physical
Resource Blocks, PRBs) and DL Transmitted Power, which lead to improve SIR and
corresponding throughput. These are achieved by means of mechanisms employing
channel quality indicators in support of scheduling/radio resource allocation
functions.
These RRM functions in the eNB require the setting of frequency / power
restrictions and preferences for the resource usage in the different cells.
Setting and updating these parameters is the task of a network optimisation
(done by operator or automatically by SON).
Use cases for the related interference measurements are e.g. optimisation of
ICIC related RRM functionality, the detection of long distance interferer and
the interference due to spurious emissions of neighbour cells. The later case
is assumed only in high load scenarios or unsufficent ICIC functionality due
to the the fact that ICIC functionality would minimise interference
autonomously if sufficient bandwidth is available.
The necessary measurements to identify and anylse the interference situation
as input for optimisation tasks has to be defined.
# A.8 Monitor of ARQ and HARQ performance
Reliable Packet Delivery is one of the important Performance factor for a
better User experience. HARQ retransmissions at the MAC layer ensure reliable
packet delivery
In addition, RLC can be configured to operate in acknowledged mode for those
applications that need very low packet drops and can tolerate a slightly
higher delay from RLC retransmissions.
If a MAC PDU is not delivered, HARQ takes care of retransmitting (upto a
maximum configurable number). If all the retransmissions fail at MAC layer,
and if RLC is configured to operate in acknowledged mode, RLC's ARQ mechanism
will take care of any residual packet errors.
It is important to\ a) maintain the block error rate or packet error rate
within tolerable limits
b) ensure that HARQ retransmissions take care of most packet errors, instead
of relying on RLC layer retransmissions (which would increase the delay).
So, it is important to monitor the performance of these schemes.\ ARQ
Performance if viewed at QCI level can help in monitoring the distribution for
each of the services.
HARQ Performance if viewed at MCS (Modulation Coded Scheme) can help in
monitoring the MCS Performance also.
# A.9 Monitoring of RF performance
RF Performance reflects the cell loading levels and abnormal conditions.
In the Downlink, Power Resources are managed by the EUTRAN Cell(RAN).\ More
Power Resources may help in increasing the Capacity of the System. Hence,
there the power resources could be effectively used to optimize the Capacity
of the System.
Hence there is a need to keep monitoring the Power Resource Utilization in %
and also in absolute terms.
Monitoring of the quality of RF signal in the cell is useful for the purpose
of NW planning and overall service quality assessment. Measurements of Channel
Quality Indicator (CQI) reported by UEs is a useful metric reflecting RF
signal quality and service quality.
Timing advance measurements reflect the distance of the UE from the cell
antenna. This information reflects the optimality of the cell antenna location
with respect to the cell traffic and is useful in the NW planning process.
Monitoring interference, both uplink and downlink, is an important aspect of
monitoring RF performance. For this purpose, monitoring of UL interference
power is useful.
Interference signals in a number of different ways, including frequency,
frequency band, direction of interfering signals, etc. can also be classified
by System internal interference and External interference. By efficient
frequency planning and careful
Selection of base station locations, the impact of interference signal can be
effectively controlled within an acceptable scope.uplink interference disturbs
the base station receiver. Once the base station receiver is compromised, it
leads to receiving code errors for the whole base station and the site's
entire service area is degraded including its network and service. Of course,
customer satisfaction is negatively impacted. So it is very useful to monitor
uplink interference of communication system to do network optimization.
# A.10 Monitor of paging performance
In EUTRAN, Paging is under the control of the MME. When the MME wants to page
a UE it has to page it in all cells that belong to the TA(s) to which the UE
is registered.
The paging load per cell is an important measure for the operator as it allows
the operator to properly dimension the resources for paging in the E-UTRAN
Cell .
At an E-UTRAN Cell it makes sense to measure the number of discarded paging
messages if this is due to some problem in the eNodeB, such as paging occasion
overflow. In that scenario the periodicity of paging occasions can be
reconfigured in order to ensure that all paging messages are transmitted by
the eNodeB in the first available paging occasion, thereby avoiding paging
delays and extended call setup delay.
Operators need to know when such an event occurs, in order to identify if the
problem is at the E-UTRAN cell level or not.
In addition to discarded paging records measurement, it is important to know
total paging records received so that discarded paging records ratio can be
derived.
Total number of paging records received is important in the sense that, it may
be fine if the discarded paging records are high if discarded paging records
ratio is small. On the other hand, it may be problematic if discarded paging
records are low, if discarded paging records ratio turn out to be high.
# A.11 Use case of eNodeB processor usage
When network is very busy, for example on important holiday or emergency
events happened, the traffic of one eNodeB is very heavy. So eNodeB processor
usage measurements are very important to indicate eNodeB processor load
capability. If eNodeB processor usage is too high, operator must take action
to avoid network paralysis.
# A.12 Monitor of simultaneous E-RABs
E-RAB is one of the EUTRAN Cell resources which are limited in number.
Hence along with the E-RAB Setup Success Rate, there is a need to keep
monitoring the simultaneous E-RABs and having them at QCI level can help in
learning the service distribution in time periods.
Average / Maximum simultaneous E-RABs, can help to know the average / maximum
utilization of the resources in time periods, thereby helping to do necessary
resource capacity engineering.
# A.13 Monitoring of Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO)
The following measurement is defined specifically to monitor the performance
of handover optimisation:
\- Number of handover failures for MRO.
The measurement examines "handover related events" in which the serving cell
of a RRC connected UE is changed. Handover related events are either normal
successful handovers, or they are failures. Different failure modes are
possible and the measurement provides counts for the occurrences of the
failure modes related with MRO, "too early", "too late" and "to wrong cell".
The detailed definitions of these modes are captured in [12]. The counters
provide visibility of the mix of failure problems that the handover
optimistion function is tackling.
In "handover to wrong cell" case, an RLF occurs shortly after a successful
handover from a source cell (cell A in Figure A.13-1) to a target cell (cell B
in Figure A.13-1) or a HOF occurs during the handover procedure; the UE
attempts to re-establish the radio link connection in a cell (Cell C in Figure
A.13-1) other than the source cell and the target cell. (See 36.300 [12]).
Figure A.13-1 Handover to wrong cell case
For the "handover to wrong cell" case (Aïƒ Bïƒ C) above-mentioned, the handover
parameters on Neighbour Relation Aïƒ B, Neighbour Relation Aïƒ C or both may be
problematic and need to be corrected. So the performance measurements for both
Neighbour Relation Aïƒ B and Neighbour Relation Aïƒ C are needed for problem
detection.
In addition to event-based (i.e. reactive) optimization of handover
performance, a pro-active optimization is possible by monitoring the dynamics
of handover triggering from UE measurement reports.
# A.14 Monitor of BLER performance
The TB Error Rate in UL/DL can directly reflect the BLER, and has an influence
on MCS selection and user throughput. It can be helpful to estimate the
performance of radio resource management like radio resource schedulein
transport layer and be helpful in trouble shooting. Furthermore, they should
be taken into account to optimize the system performance. To obtain TB Error
Rate by calculating, the number of total and error TBs transmitted in a cell
should be monitored.
# A.15 Monitoring of common LAs of overlapping target RAT's coverage
For CS fallback in EPS, as defined in section 5.1A of 3GPP TS 23.272 [17], the
fallback procedure is likely to be faster if the network can allocate a
Location Area to the UE that is the LA of the overlapping target RAT\'s
coverage. For this situation, the MME should avoid allocating TAI lists that
span multiple Location Areas of the target RAT, this can be achieved by:
\- configuring the E-UTRAN cell\'s TAI to align the LA boundary of the target
RAT;
\- the MME being configured to know which TAIs are within which LA; and
\- the MME using the TAI of the current E-UTRAN cell to derive the LAI.
Also as specified in section 4.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.272 [17], to facilitate the
alignment of TA boundaries with LA boundaries, the E-UTRAN can gather
statistics (from the inbound inter-RAT mobility events of all UEs) of the most
common LAs indicated in the RRC signalling.
From such measurements per E-UTRAN cell basis, operators 1) can know the
common LA(s) of the overlapping target RAT's coverage for each TA, which is
useful to configure the TAI list within which LA boundary to MME, operators
can also 2) detect the case that TA spans multiple LAs if different most
common LA(s) is/are reported from the E-UTRAN cells in the same TA, operators
may take actions to rectify it if needed.
# A.16 Monitoring of Energy Saving
Beside monitoring of the energy consumption it is also important to
differentiate if the cell unavailability or the failure of the RRC connection
establishment happens because of Energy Saving as Energy Saving Management
feature is by the Operator on purpose. Therefore such failures should be
distinguishable from other network failures, therefore should be counted
separately. With the separate cell unavailability counter due to Energy Saving
makes it possible to deduct the cell downtime due to Energy Savings from the
total cell outage.
# A.17 Monitoring of RNReconfiguration
The purpose of RNReconfiguration related procedure is to configure/reconfigure
the RN subframe configuration and/or to update the system information relevant
for the RN in RRC_CONNECTED.
The system information and subframe configuration is very important for RN,
but the RN does not need to apply the system information acquisition and
change monitoring procedures, if configured with an RN subframe configuration.
Upon change of any system information relevant to an RN, E-UTRAN provides the
system information blocks containing the relevant system information to RNs
with an RN subframe configuration via dedicated signalling using the
_RNReconfiguration_ message. This dedicated signalling replaces any stored
system information acquired through the system information acquisition
procedure.
Because the RN is semi-duplex, to avoid the transmission conflict between
access link (between UE and RN) and backhaul link (between RN and DeNB), the
subframe of RN is semi-statically assigned (see TR 36.814) and the
configuration information is included in the RNReconfiguration message.
During the RN operation, failures of backhaul link will cause unsuccessful RN
reconfiguration. In that case, RN will not get any response from DeNB. The
defined performance counter will help to compute how many respose messages are
missing. Depending on this result, operators could easily make network
planning to consider fix or optimize the backhaul link quality.
# A.18 Monitoring of E-RAB setup for incoming HOs
The E-RAB needs to be established in the target cell during HO, the success or
failure of E-RAB establishment in the target cell during HO results in if the
services beared on the E-RABs can continue or not after HO, thus whether or
not the E-RAB can be successfully established for incoming HO impacts the user
experience.
The unsuccessful setup of E-RABs with different QCIs could lead to different
user experience, thus the E-RAB setup for incoming HOs needs to be monitored
per QCI.
# A.19 Use case of RSRP
E-UTRAN RSRP measurement is important for analyzing coverage probability and
coverage balance of downlink. From the distribution of this measurement, the
general coverage information can be learned. So that coverage hole can be
found more easily by driving test. Much more measurment values with small
granularity are necessary to analyze coverage probability for specific area,
such as from ratio of the number of RSRP that is larger than or equal to
threshld to the total number of it, So it is necessary to define RSRP
measurement.
According to optimization experience and the transmission bandwidth
requirement reduced, several granularity of this measurement is proposed. For
-120 dBm â‰¤ RSRP \< -115dBm, the granularity is 5dB, for -115 dBm â‰¤ RSRP \<
-80dBm, the granularity is 1dB, and for -80 dBm â‰¤ RSRP \< -60dBm, the
granularity is 2dB.
The measurement period should be preconfigured by EMS.
# A.20 Use case of RSRQ
E-UTRAN RSRQ measurement can be used to calculate signal quality distribution.
According to signal quality dstribution and other measurements like AOA, UE
Rx-Tx time diffrence, the general signal quality information of cells can be
learned, so that interference heavy area can be found more easily by driving
test. Also it can be used to evaluate user satisfaction to some extent. So it
is necessary to define the RSRQ measurements.
In order to reduce the transmission bandwidth requirement, according to
network optimization experience, 1dB granularity of measurement is enough.
# A.21 Use case of UE power headroom
E-UTRAN UE power headroom measurement is important for analyzing UE power
distribution, to learn whether the uplink signal strength can be increased or
not. So it is very useful to do trouble shooting of coverage hole and coverage
balance for uplink. It is also used to evaluate the power control performance
and increase UE power headroom as possible with QoS is guaranteed for the
purpose of energy saving. These questions are determined by the ratio of the
number of larger or less than threshold to the total number of it and the
threshold is configurable.
According to network optimization experience, the granularity of measurement
1dB is enough to do trouble shooting of coverage hole and evaluation of power
control.
# A.22 Use case of UE Rx--Tx time difference related measurements
UE Rx -- Tx time difference measurement can be used to calculate distance
distribution between UE and serving eNodeB. It is useful to analyze traffic
distribution in geographic area and to do trouble shooting of extending
coverage and blind coverage spot. The probability of extending coverage and
blind coverage should be analyzed by the ratio of the number of UE Rx -- Tx
time difference that is larger than or equal to threshold to the total number
of it. Threshold is configurable according to the cases to be analyzed, Cases
includes dense urban area macro cell, suburban area macro cell and rural area
cell.So it is necessary to define the UE Rx--Tx time difference related
measurements.
For TDD mode, propagation distance of 1Ts is nearly 9.77m. According to
optimization experience, several granularity of this measurement is proposed.
Minimize granularity of 10Ts is enough to analyze distance distribution for
near base station, namely UE Rx--Tx time difference is less than 200Ts. For UE
Rx--Tx time difference is larger than 200Ts and less than 1000Ts, the
corresponding propagation distance is from 1953m to 9766m, the granularity of
40Ts is enough to do trouble shooting of extending coverage. For UE Rx--Tx
time difference is larger than 1000Ts and less than 2000Ts. the granularity is
200Ts. And for UE Rx--Tx time difference is larger than 2000Ts and less than
4096Ts, the granularity is 1048Ts.
# A.23 Use case of AOA
E-UTRAN AOA value measurement can be used to calculate UE's direction
distribution of coverage to optimize network coverage together with other
measurements like RSRP, UE Rx-Tx time diffrence etc. So it is necessary to
define E-UTRAN AOA value measurement.
According to network optimization experience, 5 degrees granularity of
measurement is enough.
# A.24 Monitoring of SCell scheduling on PUCCH in Carrier Aggregation
In the deployment scenarios for carrier aggregation as depicted in 3GPP 36.300
[12], the number of possible SCell per PCell can be multiple and not fixed. So
the PUCCH resource for the Scell scheduling needs to be properly allocated,
because:
\- Over-dimensioned PUCCH causes high overhead and results in reduced UL
throughput is (in general UL is not used efficiently);
\- Under-dimensioned PUCCH will result in reduced DL throughput (if no PUCCH
format 1bCS or format 3 ACK/NACK resource is available, PDSCH cannot be
allocated by the PDCCH for the SCell(s) and the UE cannot be allocated
resources on its SCell(s)).
Thus, the SCell scheduling success/blocking rate on PUCCH needs to be
monitored for evaluation of control channel usage in CA. When needed OAM can
also provide the guidance or take action to the eNB to optimize the PUCCH
dimension for CA.
# A.25 Evaluation of long inactivity timer
The services from the point of view the time between the newly successful RRC
connection setup and the last RRC Connection Release can be divided into the
two groups. First group is build from the services the time is quite long
(tens of minutes or hours) while for the second group it is tens of seconds.
Typical example of the service from the first group can be VoLTE call with a
common characteristic that data transmission is accumulated into the time
period the call is active without any long interruptions and sufficiently long
period between the two consequent calls from the same UE. A second type of
service can be web browsing with a common characteristic that data
transmission is accumulated into the smaller time periods the service is
active i.e. with long interruptions between data transmissions.
In the past operators had only option to set the inactivity timer commonly for
all kind of services. This may lead to the situation that for the services
from the first group UE had to spend ineffectively longer time in RRC
Connected state which had negative impact on UE's battery live. On the other
hand for the services from the second group the inactivity timer setting can
be insufficient which then may lead to significant increase of the UE
movements from RRC Idle to RRC Connected state.
Operators shall therefore accurately tune the inactivity timers to avoid some
bottlenecks in the RRC Connection setup on one side and prolongation of the
UE's battery life on the second side. Especially regarding the services where
long inactivity timer applies operator needs to have an option to estimate how
intended prolongation of the long inactivity timer is going to decrease the
number of RRC Connection Setups on one side and prolong the UEs' state in RRC
Connected state on second side, using the \"Number of successful RRC
connection setups in relation to the time between successful RRC connection
setup and last RRC connection release\".
