# Introduction
The AAS can enable system optimization to be adaptive to traffic demands and
address network evolution issues through flexible software re-configuration of
the BS and antenna system.
SON mechanism with OAM support can be beneficial to optimize the inter-
operability of AAS operations for the following AAS capabilities:
> 1) Cell Shaping: where the main coverage of each cell is maintained
> unchanged but the cell edge can be adapted to load demand.
>
> 2) Cell Splitting: it adopts higher order sectorisation (vertical,
> horizontal or a combination) to an eNB by changing the coefficients of the
> antenna elements of an active antenna system (AAS) to form more antenna
> beams, each beam may be presented by one cell.
>
> 3) Cell Merging: the contrary functionality of Cell Splitting.
Note: the description about Cell Shaping, Cell Splitting and Cell Merging may
need to be realigned with their definitions which are to be specified.
The present document studies how OAM supports the SON for AAS-based
deployments.

# 4 Use Cases
## 4.1 Cell Splitting
### 4.1.1 Overview
Cell Splitting adopts higher order sectorisation (vertical, horizontal or a
combination) to an eNB by changing the coefficients of the antenna elements of
an active antenna system (AAS) to form more antenna beams, each beam may be
presented by one cell.
The number of cells split by AAS from an original cell is not fixed, i.e., it
is flexible based on the antenna capability.
The cells newly split from an original cell may or may not change the coverage
of the original cell. In order to simplify the description, the term SO-Cell
and SP-Cell are used to signify the original cell and the new cell split from
the original cell in Cell Splitting.
### 4.1.2 Issues
#### 4.1.2.1 Triggering of Cell Splitting
The Cell Splitting may be triggered (automatically) by EM (EM centralized SON
for AAS based on measurement data (PM data and/or MDT data)), or by eNB (eNB
distributed SON for AAS based on Network and/or UE measurements) if the cell
coverage change is within the planning.
It may be unfeasible for NM to trigger the Cell Splitting, since 1) EM or eNB
has more accurate knowledge about dynamic traffic distribution (e.g., within
15 minutes, Note 1) with detailed location information in the SO-Cell, and 2)
AAS has many vendor specific parameters needs.
Note 1: the time granularity can be variant to different implementations and
it can be discussed further whether 15 minutes is a good example.
Cell Splitting causes UE handovers between the SO-Cell, SP-Cells and their
neighbour cells. The handover margins need to be set properly and efficiently
at the eNB (regardless of before, during or after the Cell Splitting) for each
SP-Cell for both outgoing and incoming handovers with its neighbours to avoid
call drops, this is very difficult to be guaranteed if Cell Splitting is
performed too often. So Cell splitting should not perform with a very high
frequency (Note 2). According to [5], cell splitting procedure is considered
on a long term time scale (every 1h or more seldom - few times a day).
Note 2: The appropriate frequency is to be discussed and may need to be
conducted with RAN WG(s).
NM and EM should also be able to activate (switch on) and deactivate (switch
off) the Cell Splitting:
  * based on network performance observed; or
  * for a special time duration for a planned event.
#### 4.1.2.2 Management of SP-Cells
The SP-Cells need to be manageable by NM and EM as soon as possible after they
are split from the SO-Cell, for the following reason:
  * the coverage and capacity of each SP-Cell needs to be known by other SON functions (e.g., ANR, MRO and CCO) affecting the parameters about neighbour relations;
  * allowing signalling based MDT, since the id and geographical information of each SP-Cell are needed to locate UEs;
  * Allowing Cell traffic trace and/or area based MDT to the SP-Cells;
  * Allowing Performance Management (PM) of the SP-Cells;
  * Allowing Fault Management (FM) of the SP-Cells;
  * Allowing Configuration Management (CM) of the SP-Cells when necessary.
The SP-Cell, once split from the SO-Cell, needs to be made known to NM and EM
as soon as possible, at least before AAS operation is applied to the SP-Cell.
The id of the SP-Cell needs to be manageable to avoid conflict and confusion.
The PCI of the SP-Cell may be or may be not the same as the PCI of the SO-
Cell, however PCI conflict or confusion with other cells needs to be avoided.
So the PCI or PCI range of each SP-Cell may be pre-allocated by NM or EM.
ECGI of each SP-Cell needs to be globally unique, it should be possible to be
configured (or pre-configured) by OAM (both NM and EM).
#### 4.1.2.3 Coverage and capacity planning for AAS
The radio network is initially deployed under network planning, and is
optimized manually or automatically (by SON functions) based on network
performance within the network capability.
AAS Cell Splitting increases network capacity in a certain area, the maximum
network capacity of a specific area is normally planned, so the Cell Splitting
should be possible to be planned by OAM (NM or EM) for some specific SO-Cell
or some specific geographical area though the Cell Splitting action may be
triggered at eNB. The Cell Splitting planning may include:
  * The quantity of potential (allowed) SP-Cells;
  * Planned capacity and coverage for each potential (allowed) SP-Cell;
  * PCI value or range of each potential (allowed) SP-Cell; and
  * ECGI of each potential (allowed) SP-Cell,
To support the planning across networks provided by multi-vendor, NM should be
able to pre-configure the information of planned Cell Splitting to EM, and EM
then forwards to eNB.
## 4.2 Cell Merging
### 4.2.1 Overview
Cell Merging is the contrary functionality of Cell Splitting (see section
4.1).
The number of cells can be merged by AAS into one cell is not fixed, i.e., it
is based on AAS algorithm.
The cell merged from the original cells (in respect to Cell Merging) may or
may not change the coverage of these original cells. In order to simplify the
description, the term MO-Cell and MT-Cell are used to signify the original
cell and the target cell merged from the original cells in Cell Merging.
### 4.2.2 Issues
#### 4.2.2.1 Triggering of Cell Merging
The Cell Merging may be triggered (automatically) by EM (EM centralized SON
for AAS based on measurement data (PM data and/or MDT data)), or by eNB (eNB
distributed SON for AAS based on Network and/or UE measurements). NM may not
be efficient enough to react the fast change (e.g., within 15 minutes, Note 1
of section 4.1 is also applicable here) within the network.
Cell Merging should not happen with a very high frequency (Note 2 of section
4.1 is also applicable to Cell Merging). According to [5], cell merging
procedure is considered on a long term time scale (every 1h or more seldom -
few times a day).
The entity triggering the Cell Merging should be the same as the entity
triggering the Cell Splitting for one active antenna system.
Similarly to Cell Splitting, NM and EM should be also able to activate (switch
on) and deactivate (switch off) the Cell Merging.
#### 4.2.2.2 Management of MT-Cell
For Cell Merging, the MT-Cell is normally assigned with a new ECGI, but may
inherit the PCI from one of its MO-cells (Note 3). So, in the view of other
(e.g., neighbour/adjacent) cells, the Cell Merging is the case that one MO-
Cell (whose id is continuously used by the MT-Cell) enlarges its coverage
while the other MO-Cells become unavailable.
In order to avoid PCI conflict or confusion, NM or EM may pre-configure the
PCI(s) to be (re)used by MT-Cell for Cell Merging; in case multiple PCIs are
pre-configured, eNB needs to choose the appropriate one when a Cell Merging
event happens. In multi-vendor networks scenario, NM should be able to do such
pre-configuration to EM, and EM then forwards to eNB.
Note 3: This is to be confirmed with RAN WG(s).
## 4.3 Cell Shaping
### 4.3.1 Overview
Cell Shaping adapts the cell edge to load demand while maintaining the main
coverage unchanged.
### 4.3.2 Issues
#### 4.3.2.1 Triggering of Cell Shaping
The Cell Shaping may be triggered (automatically) by EM (EM centralized SON
for AAS based on measurement data (PM data and/or MDT data)), or by eNB (eNB
distributed SON for AAS based on Network and/or UE measurements). NM may not
be efficient enough to react the fast change (e.g., within 15 minutes, Note 1
of section 4.1 is also applicable here) within the network.
Cell Shaping may cause UE handovers with its neighbour cells. For each Cell
Shaping event, the handover margin needs to be set properly and efficiently
for both outgoing and incoming handovers with its neighbours to avoid call
drops. So Cell Shaping should not be performed with too high frequency (the
Note 2 of section 4.1 is also applicable here).
NM and EM should be also able to activate (switch on) and deactivate (switch
off) the Cell Shaping.
#### 4.3.2.2 Scale of change
The cell coverage change made by each Cell Shaping event is undefined. If the
eNB executes Call Shaping in a fully unconstrained manner, it may decrease the
reliability of handovers with its neighbour cells since in this case an
appropriate handover margin cannot be guaranteed.
So, according to [2], the eNB may be pre-configured with alternative coverage
configurations and the eNB may autonomously select and switch between these
configurations using Active Antenna Systems functions including Cell Shaping.
And based on [3] and [4], the number of allowed coverage configurations is
limited.
The eNB needs to consider each allowed coverage configuration, to 1) make the
right selection for the coverage change during Cell Shaping, and 2) set the
proper handover margin with neighbour cells. So each pre-configured coverage
configuration should include a state identifier and the range of the
parameters (e.g., tilt, power) affecting the coverage range.
In multi-vendor networks scenario, NM should be able to pre-configure the
allowed alternative coverage configurations to EM, and EM then forwards to
eNB.

Fast conditions change NM may not be efficient enough to react to the fast
change in conditions of the network, if they happen in the short time interval
(e.g. 5 minutes). Up to vendor's implementation, whether EM can react to the
fast change in conditions of the network The eNB is able to react to the fast
change in conditions of the network
