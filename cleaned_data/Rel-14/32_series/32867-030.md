# Introduction
The split of EPC nodes will cause the user plane and the control plane of S-GW
and P-GW to be separated. This will affect management of these nodes and may
cause the existing management specifications to be impacted.
# 1 Scope
The present document analyses the impacts for management of EPC nodes caused
by the impacts for management of EPC nodes caused by the split of user plane
and control plane. The scope of this study includes:
  1. The affect of the CUPS on the performance measurements of the EPC network [2].
  2. The impact of the CUPS on the EPC NRM IRP [3].
  3. The potential impact on E-UTRAN [4].

# 4 Use Cases
## 4.1 Measurement related to the PGW in CUPS
### 4.1.1 Pre-conditions
The operator deploys the PGW with separated control plane and user plane.
### 4.1.2 Description
The NM requests EM to initiate one or more of the following measurements at
PGW-C and PGW-U. The management system subscribes to the initiated
measurements.
  1. The session management related measurements (counters) in the PGW-C include:
  2. PDN-GW initiated dedicated bearer creation
  3. PDN-GW initiated dedicated bearer deletion
  4. PDN-GW initiated dedicated bearer modification with QoS update
  5. PDN-GW initiated dedicated bearer modification without QoS update
  6. Active EPS bearers related measurements
  7. UE requested bearer resource modification related measurements
  8. PDN connections related measurements
  9. Number of EPS bearer
  10. SGi related measurements fulfilled by counter in the PGW-U.
Editor's note: Whether there is other PGW related measurement in CUPS is FFS.
The EM notifies to NM when the measurements from PGW-C and PGW-U are
available.
### 4.1.3 Post-conditions
The collected measurement data are notified to operator's the management
system.
## 4.2 Measurement related to the SGW in CUPS
### 4.2.1 Pre-conditions
The operator deploys the SGW with separated control plane and user plane.
### 4.2.2 Description
The NM requests EM to initiate one or more of the following measurements at
SGW-C and SGW-U. The management system subscribes to the initiated
measurements.
1\. The GTP related measurements in the SGW-U include:
  * GTP S5/S8 data packets related measurements

available.
### 4.2.3 Post-conditions
The collected measurement data are notified to operator's the management
system.
