# Introduction
**Data volume measurements for RAN sharing are specified in TS 36.314[2]:**
> _\"4.1.9 Data Volume for Shared Networks_
>
> _The objective of this measurement is to measure the data volume transmitted
> or received by the eNB in a configured measurement period, for the different
> PLMN identities in a shared network. The measurement is performed per
> configured PLMN ID per configured QoS profile criteria._
>
> _The QoS profile criteria may include one or more of the following criteria:
> one QCI indicator, one GBR Indicator, one ARP Indicator, where_
>
> _\- a QCI Indicator identifies one specific QCI value. QCI values range from
> 1 to 256. If the indicator is not set then all QCI values should be taken
> into account._
>
> _\- a GBR Indicator identifies one GBR range value defined by OAM. If the
> indicator is not set then all GBR ranges should be taken into account._
>
> _\- an ARP Indicator identifies one ARP priority value. ARP values range
> from 1 to 15. If the indicator is not set then all ARP priority values
> should be taken into account._
>
> _The QoS profile criteria are satisfied when all the configured indicators
> are matched. It is possible that none of the QoS parameters are configured
> in which case the measurement is collected per configured PLMN ID._

TS 36.300 [9] specified the following for Resource usage reporting for shared
networks:
> _\"23.12 Resource usage reporting for shared networks_
>
> _The eNB may be configured to report the resource usage as data volume for
> the different PLMN identities of the operators in a shared network. The
> measurements, which are defined in TS 36.314 [63], are based on the QoS
> parameter values exchanged at E-RAB setup/modification._
>
> _OAM configures data volume reporting criteria. The configured data volume
> criteria define the PLMN IDs and the QoS profile criteria for the collection
> and reporting. The data volume reports are per configured PLMN ID and per
> configured QoS profile per DL/UL._
>
> _The QoS profile configuration shall be the same for all configured PLMN IDs
> and for all eNBs. The configured QoS profile criteria can differ in UL and
> DL in terms of GBR ranges. It shall be possible to collect and report up to
> 200 counter types and a maximum of 200 counter instances._
>
> _Data volumes for the DL/UL direction of a GBR bearer shall be collected
> within a given DL/UL GBR range if the DL/UL E-RAB guaranteed bit rate is
> within a configured DL/UL range delimited by a minimum and maximum value.
> The GBR ranges shall be five in number for DL and five in number for UL. GBR
> ranges shall be non-overlapping and configurable. The configured set of GBR
> ranges applies to the whole RAN and to all PLMN IDs in the RAN. \"_
This means that the PM mechanism needs to be changed to support limitation of
the number of measurements. It is further necessary to ensure that the report
format supports to describe how these measurements are defined or limited.
The solutions might be beneficial also for other measurements.
# 1 Scope
**The study is to investigate:**
\- Solutions for how to manage measurement collection in network sharing
context over Itf-N.
\- Solutions for how to indicate high reliability to different E-UTRAN
measurements.
\- Whether the PM file format would need to be changed and possible solutions.
The solution is intended to be valid for data volume measurements, but a more
generically applicable solution should be considered, if feasible. The
solution can be valid also for non-shared networks.

# 4 Use Cases
## 4.1 Business level use case
The operator has made an agreement to act as a Master Operator, MOP, for
another operator (Participating Operator, POP) for RAN sharing, ref 3GPP TS
32.130 [5]. An example of an agreement states the following:
The QoS profile criteria ARP 1 to ARP 10 and GBR-5 for QCI- 4 and QCI-8 are
supported. The DL QCI-4, GBR-5, and ARP-1 to ARP 10 are charged x EUR per
Mbit, while UL QCI-4, GBR-5, and ARP-1 to ARP 10 are charged y EUR per Mbit.
QCI-8 is charged z EUR per Mbit regardless of QoS.\ For cross operator
accounting purpose, the network needs to reliably provide data volume
measurements for the used QoS profile criteria to the MOP.
## 4.2 Service level use case
The network manager requests a measurement job for data volume measurements
for shared network (ref. 3GPP TS 32.130 [5]) for charging purposes with high
reliability, for a subset of data volume counters per shared PLMN, per UL/DL
traffic direction and per QoS profile criteria. The QoS profile criteria may
include one or more of the following criteria: one QCI Indicator, one GBR
Indicator, one ARP Indicator, where:
\- a QCI Indicator identifies one specific QCI value. QCI values range from 0
to 255. If the indicator is not set then all QCI values should be taken into
account.
\- a GBR Indicator identifies one GBR range value defined by the management
system. If the indicator is not set then all GBR ranges should be taken into
account.
\- an ARP Indicator identifies one ARP value. ARP values range from 1 to 15\.
If the indicator is not set then all ARP values should be taken into account.
An overall maximum number of 200 counter instances (measurement instances) can
be recorded per granularity period.
The measurement type is specified by sub-clause 4.1.9 in 3GPP TS 36.314 [2].\
All the counters instances in the measurement job should be subject to the
highest reliability as it is for cross operator accounting purpose. The levels
of reliability and their definitions are vendor specific.
The network provides the statistic counters each granularity period.
# 5 Potential requirements
## 5.1 Potential business level requirements
**REQ-NETSHAR_PM-CON-1** The MOP shall be able to charge the POPs for the data
volume used by POP's users per selected QCI criteria via statistical
measurements defined for shared networks.
\- The QoS profile criteria may include QCI Indicator, GBR Indicator, ARP
Indicator.
\- It shall be possible to differentiate between DL and UL.
**REQ-NETSHAR_PM-CON-2** The MOP shall be able to set the level of reliability
for the selected measurements defined for cross operator accounting purpose in
shared networks.
**REQ-NETSHAR_PM-CON-3** A maximum number of 200 counter instances (for
measurements defined for cross operator accounting purpose in shared networks)
can be recorded per granularity period.
## 5.2 Potential specification level requirements
**REQ-NETSHAR_PM-FUN-1** The IRPAgent shall have the capability to support
subscription of UL and DL data volume measurements per QoS profile criteria
for cross operator accounting purpose from the IRPManager.\ The QoS profile
criteria may include one or more of the following criteria: one QCI indicator,
one GBR Indicator, one ARP Indicator, where:
\- a QCI Indicator identifies one specific QCI value. QCI values range from 0
to 255. If the indicator is not set then all QCI values should be taken into
account.
\- a GBR Indicator identifies one GBR range value defined by the management
system. If the indicator is not set then all GBR ranges should be taken into
account.
\- an ARP Indicator identifies one ARP value. ARP values range from 1 to 15\.
If the indicator is not set then all ARP values should be taken into account.
**REQ-NETSHAR_PM-FUN-2** The IRPAgent shall be able to support that the
IRPManager can set levels of reliability for the counter instances in a
measurement job. The levels of reliability and their definitions are vendor
specific.
**REQ-NETSHAR_PM-FUN-3** The IRPAgent shall be able to support up maximum
number of 200 counter instances to be recorded per granularity period of data
volume measurements for cross operator accounting purpose.
**REQ-NETSHAR_PM-FUN-4** The IRPAgent shall be able to support the IRPManager
to access a file containing data volume measurements for cross operator
accounting purposes every granularity period.
