# 1 Scope
The present document reports how 3GPP OAM specifications can provide support
for the assessment of energy efficiency in radio access networks as defined by
ETSI ES 203 228 [2], thanks to measuring both network performance and energy
consumption. It provides a gap analysis between ETSI ES 203 228 [2] and 3GPP
OAM Technical Specifications, and provides recommendations towards ETSI ES 203
228 [2] compliance, including suggestions for further 3GPP specification
enhancements. It also provides an analysis of how ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31]
architecture, interfaces and information model may fit with the 3GPP
management reference model defined in 3GPP TS 32.101 [32] and 3GPP IRPs,
identifies potential use cases and requirements and studies potential
solutions for interfaces that are in the scope of 3GPP. Finally, it provides
recommendations for normative work.

# 4 Support of ETSI ES 203 228 metrics and methods
## 4.1 Introduction
Clause 4 provides a gap analysis between ETSI ES 203 228 (\"Environmental
Engineering (EE); Assessment of mobile network energy efficiency\") [2] and
OAM capabilities offered by 3GPP SA5 Technical Specifications.
Based on this gap analysis, it provides a support status of SA5 specifications
against ETSI ES 203 228 [2]. For each section of ETSI ES 203 228 [2], the SA5
solution is described when it exists. Otherwise, some action may be considered
to address ETSI ES 203 228 [2].
Based on that information, a support status is produced which can take the
following values:
\- Supported,
\- Partially Supported,
\- Not Supported,
\- Not Applicable.

# 5 Support of ETSI ES 202 336-12
## 5.1 Introduction
ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31] specifies an architecture and information model for
monitoring any type of ICT equipment power, energy and environmental
parameters. Clause 5 of the present document provides, for mobile access
networks, an analysis of how ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31] architecture, interfaces
and information model may fit into the 3GPP management reference model defined
in 3GPP TS 32.101 [32] and 3GPP IRPs, identifies potential use cases and
requirements and studies potential solutions for interfaces that are in the
scope of 3GPP.
## 5.2 Principle of the monitoring of mobile access network equipment power,
energy and environmental parameters
In ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31], the basic principles of power, energy and environment parameters measurements of ICT equipment and their transfer to the Network Management Systems (NMS) are depicted -- cf. Figure 5.2-1 below. {width="5.508333333333334in" height="3.620138888888889in"} Figure 5.2-1: Principle of the monitoring of ICT equipment power, energy and environment parameters (Figure 1 of ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31]) Note: The rest of clause 5.2 provides an analysis of ETSI ES 202 336-12 and, in particular, of its figure 1, as in version v1.1.1 (2016-05). Editor\'s note: In clause 5.3, potential use cases are described, amongst which some of them propose some enhancements compared to Figure 1 of ETSI ES 202 336-12 V1.1.1 (2016-05) [31], including splitting the RMS into DM-level RMS and NM layer RMS (the exact terminology is FFS). Terms and concepts used in ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31] may correspond to 3GPP terms and concepts as follows: Table 5.2-1: Mapping between ETSI ES 202 336-12 and 3GPP terms +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | **Terms and concepts |** Corresponding 3GPP | **Comments** | | used in ETSI ES | terms and concepts | | | 202 336-12 [31] -- | -- cf.

## 5.3 Potential use cases
### 5.3.1 Introduction
ETSI (see [31]) focuses on use cases in which RMS (Remote Management Server)
resides within the Operator\'s domain. For sake of alignment with [31],
potential use cases described in clause 5.3 rely on the same working
assumption and therefore exclude scenarios in which RMS resides outside the
Operator\'s domain. The potential use cases described here below are based on
Option #1 (see Table 5.2-1) in which the NMS of ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31] --
Figure 1 corresponds to 3GPP reference management model DM.
### 5.3.2 UC#1: Base stations with built-in Type-1 sensors
#### 5.3.2.1 High level use case description
This use case addresses base stations embedding built-in Type-1 sensors (cf.
Figure 5.3.2.1-1). In this use case, the interface between base stations and
OAM systems (DM and RMS) for the control and monitoring of PEE parameters is
done via 3GPP Type-1 and Type-2 interfaces. The RMS, as a NM layer
application, is responsible for the control and monitoring of PEE parameters.
{width="3.425in" height="4.075in"} Figure 5.3.2.1-1: 3GPP management
architecture for use case #1
#### 5.3.2.2 Implications on network management
The following are the use case related network management interactions: \-
RMS, via 3GPP Type-2 interface (cf. blue dashed arrow from RMS to DM in Figure
5.3.2.1-1): # triggers the monitoring of PEE parameters of selected base
stations, # may set control parameters for monitoring alarm/event/test/command
parameters (time-out, counter, thresholds, etc.) via 3GPP Type-2 interface; \-
DM, via 3GPP Type-2 interface (cf. green solid arrow from DM to RMS in Figure
5.3.2.1-1): # periodically provides PEE parameter values to the RMS, via 3GPP
Type-2 interface, # may inform RMS in case of alarms raised on base stations,
depending on control parameter settings for alarms, # may inform RMS in case
of events on base stations, depending on control parameter settings for e.g.
state changes.
#### 5.3.2.3 Use case analysis
In use case #1: \- The control interface from RMS to DM enabling RMS to
control the monitoring of energy, power and environment parameters of selected
base stations via DM is not in the scope of ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31]. In the
context of mobile access networks, the three following options can be
envisaged: \- Option 1: 3GPP specifies the control interface between RMS and
DM, using already existing 3GPP solution sets (i.e. CORBA IDL and SOAP/XML),
or \- Option 2: 3GPP specifies the control interface between RMS and DM, by
defining a REST / XML interface (see clause 4.4.1 of [31] and Annex A of
[33]), or \- Option 3: 3GPP does not specify the control interface between RMS
and DM, meaning that this interface will not be standardized. The control of
PEE parameters of selected base stations should therefore be done directly
from the human machine interface of DM. \- The data export interface from DM
to RMS is in the scope of ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31]. Annex A (respectively B) of
[31] provides a description of mandatory (resp. non-mandatory) information
exported over this interface. Annex C of [31] gives a high-level XML-based
structure of such information. Clause 9 of [33] provides information elements
on the data structure format and syntax which can be used for the data export
interface from DM to RMS. In order to ensure interoperability between DM and
RMS, a complete XML specification would be required.
### 5.3.3 UC#2: Base stations with external Type-2 sensors
#### 5.3.3.1 High level use case description
This use case addresses base stations with external Type-2 sensors (cf. Figure
5.3.3.1-1). In this use case, the interactions between PEE XCU/DGU and RMS for
the control and monitoring of PEE parameters are provided by PEE XCU/DGU. The
RMS, which acts as a NM layer application, is responsible for the control and
monitoring of PEE parameters for selected base stations. In this use case, DM
is not involved in the control and monitoring of PEE parameters of the base
stations. {width="3.6284722222222223in" height="4.667361111111111in"} Figure
5.3.3.1-1: 3GPP management architecture for use case #2
#### 5.3.3.2 Implications on network management
The following are the use case related interactions: \- RMS, via interface
standardized according to ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31] (cf. green strong arrow from
RMS to PEE XCU/DGU in Figure 5.3.3.1-1): # triggers the monitoring of PEE
parameters of selected base stations # may set control parameters for
monitoring alarm/event/test/command parameters (time-out, counter, thresholds,
etc.); \- PEE XCU/DGUs from selected base stations, via interface standardized
according to ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31] (cf. green strong arrow from PEE XCU/DGU
to RMS in Figure 5.3.3.1-1): # periodically provide PEE monitoring parameter
values to the RMS, # may inform RMS in case of alarms, depending on control
parameter settings for alarms, # may inform RMS in case of events, depending
on control parameter settings for e.g. state changes.
#### 5.3.3.3 Use case analysis
In use case #2, both control interface (from RMS to PEE XCU/DGU) and data
export interface (from PEE XCU/DGU to RMS) are in the scope of ETSI ES 202
336-12 [31]. Annex A (respectively B) of [31] provides a description of
mandatory (resp. non-mandatory) information exported over this interface.
Annex C of [31] gives a high-level XML-based structure of such information.
Clause 9 of [33] provides information elements on the data structure format
and syntax which can be used for the interface between PEE XCU/DGU and RMS.
### 5.3.4 UC#3: Base stations with external Type-2 sensors and vendor-specific
RMS (Variant to UC#2)
#### 5.3.4.1 High level use case description
This use case addresses base stations with external Type-2 sensors (cf. Figure
5.3.4.1-1) with vendor-specific RMS. In this use case, the interactions
between PEE XCU/DGU and vendor-specific RMS for the control and monitoring of
PEE parameters are provided by PEE XCU/DGU and are vendor-specific. The
interface between the vendor-specific RMS and the NM layer umbrella RMS for
the control and monitoring of PEE parameters for selected base stations is as
described in ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31]. In this use case, DM is not involved in
the control and monitoring of PEE parameters of the base stations. Note: This
potential use case introduces two levels of RMS, namely Vendor-specific RMS
and NM-layer RMS. Editor\'s note: the relevance of this use case should be
validated by ETSI EE. {width="4.254166666666666in"
height="4.529166666666667in"} Figure 5.3.4.1-1: 3GPP management architecture
for use case #3
#### 5.3.4.2 Implications on network management
The following are the use case related interactions: \- NM-layer umbrella RMS,
via standardized interface (cf. green strong arrow from NM-layer umbrella RMS
to Vendor-specific RMS in Figure 5.3.4.1-1): # triggers the monitoring of PEE
parameters of selected base stations # may set control parameters for
monitoring alarm/event/test/command parameters (time-out, counter, thresholds,
etc.); \- Vendor-specific RMS, via possibly non standardized interface (cf.
green dashed arrow from Vendor-specific RMS to PEE XCU/DGU in Figure
5.3.4.1-1): # triggers the monitoring of PEE parameters of selected base
stations # may set control parameters for monitoring alarm/event/test/command
parameters (time-out, counter, thresholds, etc.); \- PEE XCU/DGUs from
selected base stations, via possibly non standardized interface (cf. green
dashed arrow from PEE XCU/DGU to Vendor-specific RMS in Figure 5.3.4.1-1): #
periodically provide PEE monitoring parameter values to the Vendor-specific
RMS, # may inform Vendor-specific RMS in case of alarms, depending on control
parameter settings for alarms, # may inform Vendor-specific RMS in case of
events, depending on control parameter settings for e.g. state changes; \-
Vendor-specific RMS, via standardized interface (cf. green strong arrow from
Vendor-specific RMS to NM-layer umbrella RMS in Figure 5.3.4.1-1): #
periodically provide PEE monitoring parameter values to the NM-layer umbrella
RMS, # may inform NM-layer umbrella RMS in case of alarms, depending on
control parameter settings for alarms, # may inform NM-layer umbrella RMS in
case of events, depending on control parameter settings for e.g. state
changes.
#### 5.3.4.3 Use case analysis
In use case #3, both control interface (from NM-layer umbrella RMS to Vendor-
specific RMS) and data export interface (from Vendor-specific RMS to NM-layer
umbrella RMS) are in the scope of ETSI ES 202 336612 [31]. Annex A
(respectively B) of [31] provides a description of mandatory (resp. non-
mandatory) information exported over this interface. Annex C of [31] gives a
high-level XML-based structure of such information. Clause 9 of [33] provides
information elements on the data structure format and syntax which can be used
for the interface between PEE XCU/DGU and RMS.
### 5.3.5 UC#4: Mixed mobile access network
#### 5.3.5.1 High level use case description
This use case addresses a mixed mobile access network, in which a/ base
stations with built-in Type 1 sensors (see UC#1), b/ base stations with
external Type-2 sensors (see UC #2) and c/ base stations with external Type-2
sensors and vendor-specific RMS (see UC#3) co-exist (cf. Figure 5.3.5.1-1).
For the first ones, the interface between base stations and OAM systems (DM
and NM-layer umbrella RMS) for the control and monitoring of PEE parameters is
done via 3GPP Type-1 and Type-2 interfaces. For the second ones, the interface
between base stations and NM-layer umbrella RMS for the control and monitoring
of PEE parameters is provided by PEE XCU/DGU and is standardized according to
ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31] and ES 202 336-1 [33]. For the latter ones, the
interface between base stations and Vendor-specific RMS for the control and
monitoring of PEE parameters is provided by PEE XCU/DGU and is possibly not
standardized whereas the interface between the Vendor-specific RMS and the NM-
layer umbrella RMS for the control and monitoring of PEE parameters is
standardized according to ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31] and ES 202 336-1 [33].

#### 5.3.5.2 Implications on network management
See clauses 5.3.2.2 for base stations with built-in Type 1 sensors, 5.3.3.2
for base stations with external Type 2 sensors and 5.3.4.2 for base stations
with external Type 2 sensors and vendor-specific RMS.
#### 5.3.5.3 Use case analysis
See clauses 5.3.2.3 for base stations with built-in Type 1 sensors, 5.3.3.3
for base stations with external Type 2 sensors and 5.3.4.3 for base stations
with external Type 2 sensors and vendor-specific RMS.
## 5.4 Potential requirements
Proposed business level requirements: REQ-EEA-CON-01 The Operator should be
able to monitor power, energy and environmental parameters on selected base
stations with embedded (Type-1) sensors and PEE XCUs/DGUs. REQ-EEA-CON-02 The
Operator should be able to control power, energy and environmental parameters
on selected base stations with embedded (Type-1) sensors and PEE XCUs/DGUs.
REQ-EEA-CON-03 The Operator should be able to set threshold values to power,
energy and environmental measurements on selected base stations with embedded
(Type-1) sensors and PEE XCUs/DGUs. REQ-EEA-CON-04 The Operator should be able
to receive alarm notifications (e.g. in case of sensor failure or when
threshold values to power, energy and environmental measurements are reached /
crossed) from selected base stations with embedded (Type-1) sensors and from
selected PEE XCUs/DGUs. REQ-EEA-CON-05 The Operator should be able to receive
event notifications (e.g. in case of configuration changes) from selected base
stations with embedded (Type-1) sensors and from selected XCUs/DGUs. REQ-EEA-
CON-06 For sake of costs optimization and consistency with regard to how other
network elements, from other network domains, power, energy and environmental
parameters are controlled and monitored, it is recommended that all
aforementioned interactions use REST / XML.
## 5.5 Potential solutions
Figure 5.5.1 gives the potential overall architecture for the control and
monitoring of the energy consumption of radio access networks.
{width="5.511805555555555in" height="4.3069444444444445in"} Figure 5.5-1:
Potential overall architecture for the control and monitoring of the energy
consumption of radio access networks The Umbrella RMS is a Network Management
layer Remote Management Server in charge of controlling and monitoring Power,
Energy and Environmental parameters of base stations. The Vendor-specific RMS
is an Element Management layer Remote Management Server in charge of
controlling and monitoring Power, Energy and Environmental parameters of base
stations. It may have proprietary interfaces with PEE XCU/DGUs. How energy
consumption metrics (EC~MN~) can potentially be correlated with data volume
measurements (DV~MN~) and/or coverage area data (CoA_des~MN~) in order to
calculate higher level energy efficiency (EE~MN~) KPI is described in clauses
6.5 and 6.6.
### 5.5.1 Reference points to be considered by 3GPP SA5
The following reference points of Figure 5.5-1 are in the scope of 3GPP SA5:
\- Between PEE XCU/DGU and Umbrella RMS; \- Between Vendor-specific RMS and
Umbrella RMS; \- Between 3GPP DM and Umbrella RMS. For aforementioned
reference points, the following aspects need consideration: \- For sake of
specification and implementation simplicity, the interface specifications for
the reference point between 3GPP DM and Umbrella RMS shall apply to the
reference point between PEE XCU/DGU and vendor-specific RMS on the one hand
and Umbrella RMS on the other hand. These reference points may correspond to
3GPP Type-2 interface; hence, an IRP specification methodology may be used; \-
Umbrella RMS controls PEE parameters and how they are monitored (cf. blue
arrows in Figure 5.5.1). The controls are commands to the equipment, alarm
acknowledge, configuration and settings (see clause 4 of ES 202 336-1 [34]);
\- Monitoring be can either real-time (e.g. for alarms) or not (e.g. for
averaged power values) (cf. green arrows in Figure 5.5.1). Monitored
information are alarms, events, measurements, data recordings and events logs
(see clause 4 of ES 202 336-1 [34]); \- In order that the Umbrella RMS can
have a uniform control and monitoring interface to PEE XCU/DGU, Vendor-
specific RMS and 3GPP DM, and to meet ETSI TC EE expectations, only an Http-
based REST / XML solution set is required; \- As the interface between PEE
XCU/DGU and Umbrella RMS may be out of band (e.g. based on a wireless
connection -- see green arrows of Figure 5.2-1 of the present document), all
messages should be acknowledged by the receiving party.
## 5.6 Conclusion
ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31] specifies an architecture and information model for
monitoring any type of ICT equipment power, energy and environmental
parameters. Clause 5 of the present document provides, for mobile access
networks, an analysis of how ETSI ES 202 336-12 [31] architecture, interfaces
and information model may fit into the 3GPP management reference model defined
in 3GPP TS 32.101 [32] and 3GPP IRPs, identifies potential use cases and
requirements and studies potential solutions for interfaces that are in the
scope of 3GPP. Clause 5.5 identifies the reference points to be considered by
3GPP SA5. The group recommends to start normative work and to define a new set
of specifications supporting these reference points, in order to support the
potential use cases described in clause 5.3.
# 6 Overall conclusion and recommendations
## 6.1 Introduction
The present document aims at identifying how 3GPP Technical Specifications can
meet requirements expressed by ETSI TC EE for assessing the energy efficiency
of radio access networks. Clause 4 of the present document provides a gap
analysis between ETSI ES 203 228 [2] and 3GPP Technical Specifications. In
ETSI ES 203 228 [2], one (out of the two) high-level KPI for the assessment of
energy efficiency is: {width="1.4166666666666667in" height="0.4375in"}. 3GPP
defined performance measurements provide means to calculate DV~MN~. The 3GPP
management architecture fits perfectly for the collection of DV~MN~
measurements, as depicted in Clause 6.2, though a gap resides in the lack of
3GPP defined performance measurements for UTRAN (see Table 4.4.3.2-1). Clauses
6.3 (respectively clause 6.4) describes a potential OA&M architecture for the
control and monitoring of PEE parameters, so as to be able to calculate
EC~MN~, when base stations are equipped with embedded sensors (resp. when base
stations are equipped with external sensors). Clause 6.5 provides a potential
overall OA&M architecture for collecting data volume measurements and energy
consumption metrics into a single application / database at the network
management layer. In addition to data volume measurements, mainly used for
dense urban and urban areas, design coverage area data may also be collected
from the radio planning tool for base stations in rural areas. Clause 6.6 is a
variant of the previous architecture, in which vendor-specific RMS are
deployed. Clause 6.7 gives recommendations with regard to potential normative
work to be initiated.
## 6.2 3GPP architecture for the collection of Data Volume measurements
Figure 6.2-1 provides a high-level description of the OA&M architecture for
collecting data volume measurements. See clause 4.4.3.2 for the list of RAN-
related data volume measurements that can be collected using 3GPP management
reference model and TSs. {width="5.511805555555555in" height="4.09375in"}

(base stations with embedded sensors)
Figure 6.3-1 provides a high-level description of the OA&M architecture for
the control / monitoring of PEE parameters, in the case of base stations with
embedded sensors. See clause 5.3.2 of the present document for a description
of a potential use case requiring this OA&M architecture.

for a/ the collection of data volume measurements and b/ the control /
monitoring of PEE parameters, in the case of both base stations with embedded
sensors and base stations with external sensors. {width="5.511805555555555in"

urban and urban areas, design coverage area data may also be collected from
the radio planning tool for base stations in rural areas. A Correlation
function may collect data volume measurements (DV~MN~) and energy consumption
metrics (EC~MN~) and correlate them so as to calculate the higher level energy
efficiency (EE~MN~) KPI. Also, e.g. for rural areas, the Correlation function
may collect design coverage area data (CoA_des~MN~) and energy consumption
metrics (EC~MN~) and correlate them so as to calculate the higher level energy
efficiency (EE~MN~) KPI.
## 6.6 Potential overall architecture (all types of base stations, data volume
measurements and energy consumption metrics), with vendor-specific RMS
Figure 6.6-1 provides a high-level description of the global OA&M architecture
for a/ the collection of data volume measurements and b/ the control /
monitoring of PEE parameters, in the case of both base stations with embedded
sensors and base stations with external sensors being deployed. This
architecture is a variant of the architecture depicted in clause 6.5,
illustrating the case when the operator deploys external sensors with their
vendor-specific RMS (connected via vendor-specific interface). As several
vendor-specific RMSs can potentially be deployed within an operator's network,
an "umbrella RMS" (non vendor-specific) is deployed.

## 6.7 Recommendations
Based on the proposed potential overall architecture for the assessment of the
energy efficiency of radio access network for all types of base stations
described in clause 6.6, the group recommends to start normative work and to
define a new set of specifications supporting the interfaces between Umbrella
RMS on the one hand and Vendor-specific RMS and/or base station PEE XCU/DGUs
and/or 3GPP DM on the other hand. Key points to be addressed in the normative
work are identified in clause 5.5.1.
