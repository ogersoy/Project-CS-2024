The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor 3G-system.
During the lifetime of a 3G network, its logical and physical configuration
will undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order to optimise
the utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be executed
through network configuration management activities and/or network
engineering, see TS 32.600 [3].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of a 3G network require data on which to base decisions. This data
refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In
order to produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs,
which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external
system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further
evaluation. The purpose of the present document is to describe the mechanisms
involved in the collection of the data and the definition of the data itself.
Annex B of TS 32.404 helps in the definition of new performance measurements
that can be submitted to 3GPP for potential adoption and inclusion in the
present document. Annex B of TS 32.404 discusses a top-down performance
measurement definition methodology that focuses on how the end-user of
performance measurements can use the measurements.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements for Universal Terrestrial
Radio Access Network (UTRAN).\ TS 32.401 [1] describes Performance Management
concepts and requirements.\ The present document is valid for all measurement
types provided by an implementation of a UTRAN. Only measurement types that
are specific to UTRAN are defined within the present documents.
Vendor specific measurement types used inUTRAN are not covered. Instead, these
could be applied according to manufacturer\'s documentation.
Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as ATM or IP) as
described by \"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or IETF) shall only be
referenced within this specification, wherever there is a need identified for
the existence of such a reference.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
The structure of the present document is as follows:
\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. RNC related measurements);
\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. soft handover measurements);
\- Header 3: Measurements.
# 2 References
\- The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication and/or
edition number or version number) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 4 Measurements related to the RNC
## 4.1 RAB management
### 4.1.1 Overview
#### 4.1.1.1 Measurements are based on the success and failure of procedures
The proposed measurements are not merely based on the counting of a given type
of message since a same message may be repeated by an implementation dependent
process. The aim here is to provide implementation independent specification.
Proposed measurements are based on the success/failure of procedures
identified in the reference documents. The end of a procedure implies a stable
state of the communication between the two involved parties. This stable state
is normally the object of a common understanding from the two parties. As a
consequence, proposed measurements are attached either to the successful or
the unsuccessful issue of a procedure.
#### 4.1.1.2 Combination of Traffic Class and Core Network domains
A Radio Access Bearer (RAB) is characterized by several QOS parameters among
them is the Traffic Class. Currently there are not any 3GPP specifications
including TS 23.107 [2] in which may be found restrictions related to the
possible combinations between Traffic Class and Core Network domain.
Consequently, as a conservative position, this specification should leave open
every possible combination between Traffic Class and Core Network domain as
specification TS 23.107 [2] does.
#### 4.1.1.3 Considered Radio Access Bearer management procedures
Performance Measurement definitions in this subclause are based on TS 25.413
[5].
The following paragraphs are of interest for this purpose:
\- RAB Assignment;
\- RAB Release Request;
\- RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST;
\- RAB ASSIGNMENT RESPONSE;
\- RAB RELEASE REQUEST.
These paragraphs show in particular the following diagrams.
Figure: RAB Assignment procedure. Successful operation
Figure: RAB Release Request procedure
#### 4.1.1.4 Measurements relate to RAB establishment, modification and
release
RAB management procedure includes RAB Assignment procedure and RAB Release
Request procedure. The purpose of RAB Assignment procedure is to establish new
RABs and/or to enable modifications and/or releases of already established
RABs for a given UE. If RABs are failed to be established or modified, the
involved services may fail. RAB release request can be initiated by CN or RNC
when the services terminate normally or abnormally.
During daily maintenance of network, measurements regarding RAB establishment,
modification and release are useful for operators to evaluate RAB management
procedures, to analyze failure reasons of RAB establishment and RAB
modification, and to analyze the causes of RAB release, especially in case RAB
release abnormally.
### 4.1.2 RAB establishment for CS domain

## 4.9 Radio link management procedures
### 4.9.1 Overview
#### 4.9.1.1 Considered radio link management procedures
Performance Measurement definitions in subclause 4.9 are based on the TS
25.423 [6] and TS 25.433 [7].
The following paragraphs are of interest for this purpose:
\- Radio Link Setup (NBAP);
\- Radio Link Addition (NBAP);
\- Radio Link Deletion (NBAP);
\- Radio Link Setup (RNSAP);
\- Radio Link Addition (RNSAP);
\- Radio Link Deletion (RNSAP);
\- RADIO LINK SETUP REQUEST (NBAP);
\- RADIO LINK SETUP RESPONSE (NBAP);
\- RADIO LINK SETUP FAILURE (NBAP);
\- RADIO LINK ADDITION REQUEST (NBAP);
\- RADIO LINK ADDITION RESPONSE (NBAP);
\- RADIO LINK ADDITION FAILURE (NBAP);
\- RADIO LINK DELETION REQUEST (NBAP);
\- RADIO LINK DELETION RESPONSE (NBAP);

#### 4.9.1.2 Relation between Iub measurements and Iur measurements
The following figure shows the relation between Iub interface and Iur
interface. There are two cases for SRNC (CRNC1) to request radio link
management activities in this figure.
In case (1), SRNC (CRNC1) sets up/adds/deletes radio links in NodeB1 and
NodeB1 is directly controlled by SRNC (CRNC1).
In case (2/2bis), NodeB2 is directly controlled by DRNC (CRNC2). If SRNC
(CRNC1) wants to set up/add/delete radio links in NodeB2, SRNC (CRNC1) will
send request to DRNC (CRNC2), and DRNC (CRNC2) set up/add/delete radio links
in NodeB2. In such case, if DRNC (CRNC2) fails to set up/add radio links in
NodeB2 and receives failure message from NodeB2, DRNC (CRNC2) will send
failure message back to SRNC (CRNC1). Furthermore if DRNC (CRNC2) has problem
inside and fails to send request to NodeB2, it will send failure message back
to the SRNC (CRNC1) directly.
Figure: Relation between Iub interface and Iur interface
Subclause 4.9 has separated measurements for both Iur interface and Iub
interface. From the above figure and description, we can see that the Iub
interface measurements and Iur interface measurements overlap in some degree.
Based on maintenance requirements, these two kinds measurements are needed and
they are useful for operators to evaluate both the Iub interface and Iur
interface, and to analyze all the failure cases they concern.

## 4.30 HSDPA Release measurements
### 4.30.1 Overview of HSDPA Release
#### 4.30.1.1 General
The HSDPA release is executed via releasing the HS-DSCH. It can happen with
RRC Connection Release procedure and various Radio Bearer Control procedures.
The RANAP procedures RAB Assignment Request or Iu Release Command can also be
involved.
There is always a RRC procedure used but not necessarily a RANAP procedure.
As there are HSDPA release cases that doesn't involve CN (RANAP) the
triggering of required measurements is always based primarily on RRC
triggering.
In cases that the CN has initiated the release of a RAB and/or Iu connection
that currently has a Radio Bearer including HS-DSCH the RANAP interface is
included in the triggering part of the related requirement.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Use cases for measurement report related
measurements
# A.1 Use case of P-CCPCH RSCP
P-CCPCH RSCP measurement reflects P-CCPCH of serving cell RSCP signal
strength. From the distribution of this measurement during the period of
measurement, the coverage quality of cell can be learned. Also it is helpful
to do troubleshooting, such as locating coverage blind spot. Much more
measurement values with small granularity are necessary to analyze coverage
probability for specific area. Such as from ratio of the number of PCCPCH RSCP
that is larger than or equal to threshold to the total number of it, coverage
probability could be learned. Threshold value is configurable according to the
cases to be analyzed, such as, -95dBm for macro cell cases, -80dBm for micro
or indoor cell cases, also the threshold may be higher for some cases with
specific requirement. So that the coverage probability results can not be
given from average, minimum and maximum of measurement value. So it is
necessary to define P-CCPCH RSCP measurement.
According to optimization experience, several granularity of this measurement
is proposed. Since the receiver sensitivity is nearly -110dBm (TDD mode), so
that it is no meaning to collect the measurement value lower than it. For -110
dBm â‰¤ RSCP \< -100dBm, signal strength is week, it is useful to do trouble
shooting, so the granularity is 1dB.
# A.2 Use case of UTRAN RSCP
UTRAN RSCP measurement together with UE P-CCPCH RSCP is helpful to analyze
coverage probability and coverage balance of uplink and downlink. Much more
measurement values with small granularity are need to analyze coverage
probability for specific area, such as from ratio of the number of UTRAN RSCP
that is larger than or equal to threshold to the total number of it, coverage
probability could be learned. Threshold value is configurable according to the
cases to be analyzed, such as, -95dBm for macro cell cases, -80dBm for micro
or indoor cell cases, also threshold may be higher for some cases with
specific requirement. Since the coverage probability results can not be given
from average, minimum and maximum of measurement value, it is necessary to
define UTRAN RSCP measurement.
According to optimization experience, several granularity of this measurement
is proposed. Since the receiver sensitivity is nearly -110dBm (TDD mode), so
that it is no meaning to collect the measurement value lower than it. For -110
dBm â‰¤ RSCP \< -100dBm, signal strength is week, it is useful to do trouble
shooting, so the granularity is 1dB. For RSCP is larger than -100dBm, signal
strength can be used to analysis balance of uplink and downlink, it is no need
too accurately, so the granularity is 3dB.
# A.3 Use case of UE timing advance
UE timing advance measurement is useful to analyze distance distribution
between UE and serving Base Station and do trouble shooting of extending
coverage and blind coverage spot together with other measurements, such as
P-CCPCH RSCP, AOA etc measurements. The probability of extending coverage and
blind coverage should be analyzed by the ratio of the number of TIMING_ADVANCE
that is larger than or equal to threshold to the total number of it. Threshold
is configurable according to the cases to be analyzed, cases includes dense
urban area macro cell suburban area macro cell and rural area cell.
For LCR TDD mode, propagation distance of 1 chip is nearly 234m. since urban
cell radius nearly 500m, and suburban cell radius is nearly 1000m, and rural
cell radius is nearly 2000m, according to optimization experience, minimize
granularity of TIMING_ADVANCE is 0.5chip is enough to analyze distance
distribution for near base station, namely TIMING_ADVANCE is less than 4
chips. For TIMING_ADVANCE is large than 4 chips and less than 32 chips, the
corresponding propagation distance is from 936m to 7488m, the granularity is 1
chip is enough to do trouble shooting of extending coverage. For
TIMING_ADVANCE is large than 32 chips, how far accurately can not be learned
from it because of the complexity of wireless propagation, it is enough that
extending coverage is learned from it in this case.
So it is necessary to define UE timing advance measurement with small
granularity.
# A.4 Use case of UTRAN AOA value
UTRAN AOA value measurement is helpful to analyze UE's direction distribution
of coverage to optimize network together with other measurements. So it is
necessary to define UTRAN AOA value measurement.
Granularity of measurement is 5 degree, for cell radius is 500m, corresponding
length in edge of cell coverage is nearly 44m. For cell radius is 1000m,
corresponding length in edge of cell coverage is nearly 88m. According to
network optimization experience, a block whose side length is 44m or 88m for
urban cell or suburban cell respectively is enough as an area unit to be
analyzed.
# A.5 Use case of UE timeslot ISCP
UE timeslot ISCP measurement is useful to analyze coverage quality of each
cell and do troubleshooting of blind spot together with other measurements,
such as P-CCPCH RSCP measurement. So it is necessary to define UE timeslot
ISCP measurement.
According to network optimization experience, the granularity of measurement
is 1dB when UE_TS_ISCP_LEV is less than 57, and there are very few
UE_TS_ISCP_LEV results that is larger than and equal to 57, so one measurement
is defined for it. From these measurements, it is easy to get the ratio of the
number of UE_TS_ISCP_LEV that is larger than threshold to the total number of
it, and the threshold is configurable according to use cases, such as cell
coverage analysis, channel estimation analysis etc.
# A.6 Use case of UTRAN timeslot ISCP
UTRAN timeslot ISCP measurement is useful to analyze coverage quality of each
cell and performance of the DCA (Dynamic Channel Allocation), such as the
UTRAN timeslot ISCP is always high then DCA does not work well. So it is
necessary to define UTRAN timeslot ISCP measurement.
1dB of UTRAN ISCP measurement granularity is used to compare with UE ISCP, the
ISCP distribution can be given with same granularity. In addition, from the
ratio of the number of UTRAN_TS_ISCP_LEV that is larger than or less than
threshold to the total number of it, inference source or RF equipment question
could be located. The threshold is configurable.
# A.7 Use case of UE transmitted power
UE transmitted power measurement is useful to analyze coverage quality of each
cell and do troubleshooting of blind spot by the distribution of this
measurement together with other measurements, such as P-CCPCH RSCP
measurement. It is also used to evaluate power control performance and
decrease UE transmitted power as possible with QoS is guaranteed for the
purpose of energy saving. These questions are determined by the ratio of the
number of larger or less than threshold to the total number of it and the
threshold is configurable. So it is necessary to define UE transmitted power
measurement.
According to network optimization experience, the granularity of measurement
3dB is enough to do trouble shooting of blind spot and evaluation of power
control.
# A.8 Use case of UpPTS interference
When many NodeBs cover a large area, one NodeBs UpPTS may receive interference
from another far nodeB transmission signal for the transmission delay. If the
UpPTS interference is too strong, UE can not access network. The solution of
interference coordination is determined by the ratio of the number of UpPTS
interference that is larger than threshold to the total number of it. So it is
necessary to define UpPTS interference measurement.
According to network optimization experience, measurement granularity is 1dB,
it is enough to do probability distribution to determine extending coverage or
GPS synchronization problem.
# A.9 Use case of SIR
SIR measurement is important to evaluate quality of the received signal and
range of cell coverage.With the measured SIR compared to the SIR target of
each traffic class, it can be determined whether the signal is decoded
correctly or not. SIR target is used for out loop power control, and it is
useful to learn the effect of power control, such as SIR is converged to SIR
target quickly or not.
In order to reduce the number of SIR related measurement, according to network
optimization experience, 0.5dB granularity of measurement is enough.
# A.10 Use case of Bit Error Rate and BLER
Bit Error Rate and BLER is very useful to evaluate service quality per traffic
class, if Bit Error Rate and BLER is higher than threshold, it possibly leads
to call drop. It is also useful to evaluate the effect of power control, such
as for open loop power control, if initial SIR target is not set properly, Bit
Error Rate or BLER will be very high and reduced slowly. So it is necessary to
define BLER related measurements.
From above, use case of Bit Error Rate and BLER related measurement is not
like radio resource management in RNC equipment, only some performance is
learned from Bit Error Rate or BLER distribution. So according to network
optimization experience, 10 subcounters for Bit Error Rate or 20 subcounters
for BLER are proposed and the granularity is larger than definition of
measurement report.
# A.11 Monitoring of Energy Saving
Besides monitoring of the energy consumption it is also important to
differentiate if the cell unavailability or the failure of the RRC connection
establishment happens because of Energy Saving as Energy Saving Management
feature is applied by the network operator on purpose. Therefore such failures
should be distinguishable from other network failures, i.e. they should be
counted separately. With the separate cell unavailability counter due to
Energy Saving it is possible to deduct the cell downtime due to Energy Savings
from the total cell downtime.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Use cases for performance measurements
defintion
# B.0 Introduction
This annex provides the concrete use cases for the UTRAN performance
measurements defined in clause 4.
# B.1 HSPA evolution related performance
In HSPA evolution different scheduling mechanism are defined. For Network
Operators to use the related licenses more efficient it is important to know
the utilization of the different scheduling mechanism. Based on the
utilization information operator can optimize their license usage by moving
licenses to the areas where the utilization is higher.
The utilization of 64QAM and MIMO scheduling mechanism is calculated based in
the scheduled TTIs. The measurements required are: how many TTIs using 64QAM
technology in UTRAN cell are actually scheduled by NodeB, how many TTIs in
UTRAN cell are actually scheduled by NodeB of using MIMO technology and how
many TTIs are actually scheduled in total. The first counter can be used to
calculate the usage of 64QAM technology in the networks, by comparing this
measurement to the total number of scheduled TTIs. The second counter reflects
the utilization of MIMO technology in the networks by comparing this
measurement to the total number of scheduled TTIs. The last counter reflects
the total number of scheduled TTIs where the empty TTIs are excluded.
# B.2 RAB establishment related performance
With the dramatic development of 3G network, operators provide much more kinds
of streaming service platforms mainly in PS domain, such as VOD (Video on
Demand), IVVR (Interactive Voice and Video Response) and Video Surveillance.
The streaming services can be distinguished by the data rate since they
require different data rate, as same as conversation services in CS domain.
For instance, IVVR, VOD and Video Surveillance require different data rate,
typically 64kbps, 128kbps, and 384kbps. Only streaming services counted in
this measurement is because that operators are more interested in streaming
type of service, whose QoS needs to be monitored and guaranteed. The
measurements related to RAB establishment in PS domain streaming type
according to data rates can reflect different streaming services. It would be
helpful for the operators to know the successful ratio of their services'
establishments.
# B.3 Iurg related measurements
The main purpose of Iurg interface is to enhance mobility performance
including paging, cell update and registration area update etc, especially for
dual-RAN capable mobiles. It can alleviate the potential problem caused with
dual mode mobiles frequently toggling between UTRAN and GERAN coverage areas
(e.g. in indoor coverage situations): for instance, common LAIs and RAIs for
GERAN and UTRAN cells in the same geographical area.
Resource reservation, preparation and implementation of handover with Iurg
interface success rate are very useful to analyze network handover performance
and to do trouble shooting when handover success rate is lower than predefined
threshold. So it is necessary to define Iurg related measurements.
# B.4 RRC connection usage per UE multi-mode/multi-RAT capability related
measurement
Network Operator\'s Business Community aims to utilize their installed
equipment as much as possible for efficiency reasons because each additional
technology layer constitutes an important portion of total capex expenditures.
A generic approach is to configure network parameters so that UEs that support
both new and older radio access technology layers would camp on and use
services from latest technology with better cost per bit characteristics.
Therefore, it is of utmost importance for an operator to know if new
technology capable UEs are served by old radio access technology for areas
where new technology is overlayed on top.
RRC connection usage per UE multi-mode/multi-RAT capability related
measurement will be helpful for operators to identify how efficient they
utilize their deployed radio access technology layers and perform corrective
actions when needed.
