# 4 Introductory information
## 4.1 Introduction
The confidentiality algorithm GEA5 is a stream cipher that is used to
encrypt/decrypt blocks of data under a confidentiality key KC128. The block of
data may be between 1 and 65536 octets long. The algorithm uses SNOW 3G [2] as
a keystream generator.
The integrity algorithm GIA5 computes a 32-bit MAC (Message Authentication
Code) of a given input message using an integrity key KI128. The approach
adopted uses SNOW 3G.
## 4.2 Notation
### 4.2.1 Radix
The prefix \"0x\" indicates hexadecimal numbers.
### 4.2.2 Conventions
The assignment operator \"=\", as used in several programming languages.
\ = \
means that \ assumes the value that \ had before
the assignment took place. For instance,
_x_ = _x_ \+ _y_ \+ 3
means
(new value of _x_) becomes (old value of _x_) + (old value of _y_) + 3.
### 4.2.3 Bit/byte ordering
All data variables in this specification are presented with the most
significant bit (or byte) on the left hand side and the least significant bit
(or byte) on the right hand side. Where a variable is broken down into a
number of sub-strings, the left most (most significant) sub-string is numbered
0, the next most significant is numbered 1 and so on through to the least
significant.
For example an n-bit MESSAGE is subdivided into 64-bit substrings MB~0~, MB~1~
... MB~i~ so if the message is:
0x0123456789ABCDEFFEDCBA987654321086545381AB594FC28786404C50A37...
then:
MB~0~ = 0x0123456789ABCDEF\ MB~1~ **=** 0xFEDCBA9876543210\ MB~2~ =
0x86545381AB594FC2\ MB~3~ = 0x8786404C50A37...
In binary this is:
000000010010001101000101011001111000100110101011110011011110111111111110...
with MB~0~ = 0000000100100011010001010110011110001001101010111100110111101111\
MB~1~ **=** 1111111011011100101110101001100001110110010101000011001000010000\
MB~2~ = 1000011001010100010100111000000110101011010110010100111111000010\
MB~3~ = 1000011110000110010000000100110001010000101000110111...
