# Introduction
A work item for Enhanced CRS and 4Rx SU-MIMO Interference Mitigation
Performance Requirements for LTE was approved at the 3GPP RAN #73 meeting [2].
This technical report summarizes the work that RAN WG4 has accomplished in
this work item to investigate the feasibility of CRS-IM and SU-MIMO IM
receivers.
In the LTE Release 11 to 13, multiple UE interference mitigation (IM) receiver
enhancements for the interference-limited environments were introduced,
including LMMSE-IRC, CRS-IM, SU-MIMO IM, NAICS, and other advanced receivers.
The substantial part of the respective 3GPP work was dedicated to the
introduction of the CRS Interference Mitigation (CRS-IM) functionality, which
was done in the scope of the Release 11 FeICIC WI and Release 12/13 CRS-IM SI
and WI. The purpose of the introduced CRS-IM functionality is to specify the
receiver mechanisms to mitigate the dominant CRS interferences from the
neighbouring cells, which may become a limiting factor for the DL performance
for the synchronous homogeneous deployments. As the result of the 3GPP work in
the LTE Release 11-13, multiple CRS-IM UE demodulation performance
requirements were defined covering some typical LTE operation scenarios.
However, still only a subset of the important operation scenarios was
addressed in the UE demodulation performance for other scenarios is not
guaranteed:
\- CRS-IM requirements are introduced for the case of the network deployments
using 2 CRS APs only, meanwhile, the UE behaviour for the case of 4 CRS APs
deployments is undefined.
\- CRS-IM requirements is defined for the case using the same number of CRS
APs in the serving and interference cells. Practically, different cells may
use different CRS configurations.
\- CRS-IM requirements are specified for the UEs equipped with 2 receive
antennas only, while the UEs with 4 receive antennas, which are emerging in
the market, may also benefit from using the CRS-IM and should be considered.
Therefore, the CRS-IM functionality is actually not defined for many important
use cases and without proper UE demodulation requirements it is not possible
to guarantee correct UE implementations. The work item [2] aims to investigate
and introduce CRS-IM for the generic LTE deployment scenarios with various
combinations of the number of CRS APs and number of UE receive chains.
**In the LTE Release 12 the performance requirements for UEs using enhanced
interference cancellation and suppression SU-MIMO receivers were introduced.
The advanced receivers such as reduced complexity ML (R-ML) were considered
for the intra-cell SU-MIMO inter-stream interference handling. The performance
requirements were introduced for the UEs equipped with 2 receive antennas.
Recently in the LTE Release 13 the basic performance requirements for the 4
receive antennas UEs were introduced, however, the requirements for the SU-
MIMO scenarios are assumed to be based on the simple LMMSE receiver. By using
SU-MIMO advanced receiver, which can suppress or cancel the inter-stream
interference, the significant gain can be achieved in the typical scenarios.**
**This technical report captures the outcome of the work item technical

# 1 Scope
The objective of this report is to investigate feasibility and specify
requirements for 1) CRS-IM receivers for the generic scenarios with different
number of CRS APs (2, 4) and different number of UE receive antennas and 2)
SU-MIMO IM receivers for UEs equipped with 4 receive antennas. The work item
[2] has the following detailed objectives:
\- Investigate feasibility and specify requirements for the CRS-IM receivers
for the generic scenarios with different number of CRS APs (2, 4) and
different number of UE receive antennas for synchronous networks:
\- Stage 1: Investigate performance benefits and feasibility of using CRS-IM
receivers:
\- Identify target scenarios including deployment scenarios, interference
models, and others
\- Reuse Rel-12 NAICS and Rel-13 CRS-IM WIs assumptions as the starting point
\- Evaluate the CRS-IM performance benefits
\- Identify reference CRS-IM receiver structure assumptions including at least
number of cancelled cell(s), and IM algorithm.
\- The tradeoff between complexity and performance should be analyzed in order
to define reference receivers.
\- Stage 2: Specify UE demodulation and CSI reporting performance requirements
to verify practical CRS-IM operation for the identified scenarios based on the
outcome of Stage 1.
\- The work should be done under the following assumptions:
\- The following scenarios are prioritized:
\- 2 RX antennas UEs with 4 CRS APs in the serving and interference cell(s)
\- 2 RX antennas UEs with a mix of 2 and 4 CRS APs in the serving and
interference cell(s)
\- 4 RX antennas UEs with 2 and 4 CRS APs in the serving and interference
cell(s)
\- CRS-IM can be used for different downlink physical channels:
\- First priority: PDSCH (both CRS- and DMRS-based transmission modes)
\- Second priority: DL control channels including PDCCH, PCFICH, PHICH and
EPDCCH
\- Non-colliding CRS scenarios are primarily considered.
\- Colliding CRS scenarios are not precluded.
\- Homogeneous deployment scenarios are primarily considered
\- Heterogeneous deployment scenarios are not precluded.
\- Single carrier case.
\- Reference PDSCH receiver structure: LMMSE-IRC with CRS-IM.
\- Investigate feasibility and specify requirements for the enhanced SU-MIMO
inter-stream interference mitigation (SU-MIMO IM) receivers for the scenarios
with 4 receive antennas UEs
\- Stage 1: Investigate performance benefits and feasibility of using SU-MIMO
IM receivers for the scenarios with 4 receive antennas UEs.
\- Investigate and agree on target scenarios including layer number for
spatial multiplexing, MCS, propagation conditions and others for performance
evaluation
\- Reuse the assumptions for Rel-12 SU-MIMO IM (Type-C receiver) and Rel-13
4Rx MIMO performance requirements as starting point.
\- SU-MIMO scenarios
\- rank 2/3/4 SU-MIMO is considered
\- The maximum number of layers (e.g. rank3/4) should be determined based on
feasibility study (e.g. operating SNR), realistic Tx EVM assumption and the
study on performance gains, reference receiver complexity and testability,
etc.
\- Strive to reuse agreed Tx EVM for 4Rx in Rel-13 if the related agreement
can be reached
\- Consider 2 and 4 CRS APs scenarios
\- Channel correlations
\- Focus on the Medium, Medium A and High antenna correlation models
\- Modulation order: up to 256QAM
\- The considered modulation orders should be decided based on feasibility
study (e.g. operating SNR), realistic Tx EVM assumption, performance gains,
reference receiver complexity and testability, etc.
\- Strive to reuse agreed Tx EVM for 4Rx in Rel-13 if the related agreement
can be reached.
\- Identify the reference receiver structure for SU-MIMO IM evaluation
\- R-ML is considered in high priority
\- Evaluate the performance of enhanced SU-MIMO IM receivers.
\- Stage 2: Specify UE demodulation performance requirements to verify
enhanced SU-MIMO receivers for the UEs equipped with 4 RX antennas
\- Reference receiver structure and other test parameters are based on the
outcome of Stage 1.
\- Single carrier case.

## 4.2 Receiver structures and assumptions
### 4.2.1 Baseline reference receivers
The performance of the Enhanced CRS-IM receiver structures is analysed against
the following Baseline reference receiver structures which are used to define
the minimum performance requirements in the existing LTE systems:
\- PDSCH: LMMSE-IRC detector as defined in TR 36.829 [5];
\- DL Control Channels (PDCCH, PCFICH, PHICH, EPDCCH): LMMSE-MRC detector.
\- The baseline LMMSE-IRC and LMMSE-MRC receivers are assumed to not
differentiate CRS or data interference when suppressing them.
### 4.2.2 Enhanced reference receivers
The following Enhanced reference receiver structures are considered in the
studies:
\- PDSCH: LMMSE-IRC detector as defined in TR 36.829 [5] combined with a CRS-
IM receiver;
\- DL Control Channels: LMMSE-IRC detector as defined in TR 36.829 [5]
combined with a CRS-IM receiver (Type A DL Control Channel IM receiver).
The CRS IM receiver defined for Release 11 FeICIC [3] and Release 13 CRS-IM
[4] is reused. In particular, the following CRS-IM receiver assumptions are
used in the studies:
\- Single FFT processing
\- No restriction on whether mitigated CRS interference is intra-/inter-site.
\- Number of cancelled cells for non-colliding CRS-IM:
\- The PDSCH and DL Control Channels minimum performance requirements agreed
to be defined under assumption of single dominant interference cell CRS-IM.
\- UEs are not restricted to use more than 1 cell CRS-IM and this is left up
to UE implementation.
During the studies different sub-types of CRS-IM receiver implementation were
considered for different scenarios
\- CRS-IM receivers for non-colliding CRS and 4 CRS APs ports (PDSCH Tests #1,
#4)
\- CRS-IM Receiver #A1: Full complexity four ports CRS-IM processing.
\- CRS-IM Receiver #A2: Reduced complexity CRS-IM processing (e.g. full
complexity for CRS APs 0, 1 and low complexity for CRS APs 2,3).
\- CRS-IM receivers for colliding CRS scenarios with same number of CRS APs in
the serving and neighbouring cells (PDSCH Test #5)
\- CRS-IM Receiver #B1: LMMSE-IRC with 1 cell CRS-IM to improve channel
estimation.
\- CRS-IM Receiver #B2: LMMSE-IRC with 1 cell CRS-IM to improve channel and
interference estimation.
\- CRS-IM receivers for colliding CRS with different number of CRS APs in the
serving and neighbouring cells (PDSCH Test #6)
\- CRS-IM Receiver #C1: LMMSE-IRC with covariance matrix estimation on serving
cell CRS APs 0-3 and 1 cell CRS-IM.
\- CRS-IM Receiver #C2: LMMSE-IRC with covariance matrix estimation on serving
cell CRS APs 2-3 and 1 cell CRS-IM.
### 4.2.3 CRS assistance information assumptions
The performance analysis in the technical report is provided under assumption
of ideal knowledge of the dominant interferer cell CRS Assistance information
including
\- Physical Cell ID;
\- Number of CRS AP;
\- MBSFN subframe configuration.
Different receivers in terms of availability of CRS assistance information
were considered for Enhanced CRS-IM
\- Option 1: CRS-IM receivers without capabilities to detect neighboring cell
CRS Assistance information.
\- Option 2: CRS-IM receivers capable of blind detection of the number of CRS-
APs in the interference cells.
The link-level performance evaluation was conducted under assumption of
perfect knowledge of the interference cell CRS assistance information.

# 5 Enhanced SU-MIMO **IM** based on 4RX
In Release 12, enhanced SU-MIMO IM receivers were introduced to improve the DL
spectral efficiency for UEs equipped with two receive antennas for the
scenarios with multiple MIMO stream PDSCH transmissions. The investigated
enhanced SU-MIMO IM receivers were proven to be able to handle inter-stream
interference more efficiently comparing to the conventional LMMSE receivers.
The corresponding enhanced performance requirements were defined in
application to the UEs equipped with 2 receive (RX) antennas and for MIMO rank
2 scenarios.
The objective of the work item [2] is to investigate performance benefits,
complexity, and feasibility of using SU-MIMO IM receivers in application to
the UEs equipped with 4 receive antennas:
\- Investigate and agree on target scenarios including layer number for
spatial multiplexing, MCS, propagation conditions, antenna correlation and
others for performance evaluation
\- Identify the reference receiver structure for SU-MIMO IM evaluation
\- Evaluate the performance of enhanced SU-MIMO IM receivers
**This section provides the summary of the analysis of the enhanced SU-MIMO IM
receivers for UEs equipped with 4 receive antennas and includes the following
sub-clauses:**
\- Clause 5.1 describes the simulation scenarios used for SU-MIMO IM
performance analysis;
\- Clause 5.2 describes the receiver structure used for evaluation of enhanced
SU-MIMO IM;
\- Clause 5.3 summarizes the results of the link-level performance
evaluations.
\- **Clause 5.4 provides summary of conclusions on enhanced SU-MIMO IM
investigations.**
## 5.1 Scenarios
**This section describes the evaluation scenarios and simulation assumptions
used for the investigations of performance benefits and feasibility for
enhanced SU-MIMO IM receiver with 4 receive antennas.**

## 5.2 Receiver structures and assumptions
The baseline PDSCH SU-MIMO performance requirements for UEs equipped with both
2 and 4 receive antennas are based on the conventional LMMSE receivers as
described in the TR 36.829 [5].
Enhanced non-linear receivers can be used to improve the SU-MIMO performance
for the case rank 2 or more PDSCH signal transmissions.
For UEs equipped with 2 receive antennas in Release 12 Enhanced SU-MIMO IM
work item two enhanced receiver structures were considered to improve the
performance including R-ML (Reduced complexity ML) and CWIC (Code word level
-- IC) receivers as described in the TR 36.866 [6]. Both receiver structures
were shown to provide sufficient and comparable performance improvement over
baseline LMMSE receivers and the exact decision on the enhanced SU-MIMO IM
receiver structure was left up to UE implementation.
For UEs equipped with 4 receive antennas, the R-ML receiver is considered as
the only candidate enhanced SU-MIMO IM receiver structure, while CWIC
receivers are considered to be relatively complex for practical
implementation.
R-ML receivers are assumed to perform reduced complexity joint detection of
multiple MIMO layers modulation symbols in accordance to the maximum
likelihood (ML) criterion. R-ML receiver may have different implementations
(e.g. sphere decoding, QR-MLD, MLM, etc.). In addition, there may be some
adjustable receiver parameters that have impact on the R-ML receiver
performance (e.g. the radius of the sphere decoder, the final candidate set
size for LLR calculation and so on). The exact selection of R-ML receiver
algorithm and parameters depends on the UE implementation.

# 6 Conclusions
This technical report summarizes the results of the feasibility studies on CRS
interference mitigation in application to the generic scenarios with different
number of CRS APs (2, 4) and different number of UE receive antennas and on
**SU-MIMO IM receivers in application to the UEs equipped with 4 receive
antennas.**
Receiver structures based on LMMSE-IRC detector combined with a CRS-IM
receiver were investigated in application to the generic scenarios with
different number of CRS APs (2, 4) and different number of UE receive antennas
including 2 and 4 receive antennas. The feasibility studies were done for the
PDSCH and DL control channels including PDCCH, PCFICH, PHICH and EPDCCH. Based
on the results of the studies RAN4 concluded on the feasibility and
substantial performance benefits of the CRS-IM receivers.
Receiver structure based on SU-MIMO receiver with 4 receive antennas were
investigated in application to the generic scenarios with different modulation
order and rank for TM3, TM4 and TM9. The feasibility studies were done for
combinations of various antenna correlations including low, medium, medium A
and high. Based on the results of the studies RAN4 concluded on the
feasibility and substantial performance benefits of the SU-MIMO receiver with
4 receive antennas.
