# 4 Background
## 4.1 Justification
The pace of LTE network deployment is accelerating all over the world, which
enables more and more advanced services and Internet applications making use
of the inherent benefits of LTE, such as higher data rate, lower latency and
enhanced coverage. Widely deployed LTE-based network provides the opportunity
for the vehicle industry to realize the concept of 'connected cars'. By
providing a vehicle with an access to the LTE network a vehicle can be
connected to the Internet and other vehicles so that a broad range of existing
or new services can be envisaged. Vehicle manufacturers and cellular network
operators show strong interests in vehicle wireless communications for
proximity safety services as well as commercial applications.
LTE-based V2X study is urgently desired from market requirement, and the
market for V2V communication in particular is time sensitive. There are many
research projects and field tests of connected vehicles in some countries or
regions, such as US/Europe/Japan/korea. In China, CCSA has finished the
feasible study for vehicle safety application based on TD-LTE in 2014 and
began the series of industrial standard of communication based on LTE for
vehicle application. Further, in March 2015, the frequency study of V2X also
started in CCSA and some vehicular industrial alliances in china. Based on the
study, National Regulatory Authority in China will allocate the frequency of
connected vehicles.
In order to respond to this situation, RAN approved the feasibility study on
LTE-based V2X services to evaluate new functionalities needed to operate LTE-
based V2X (V2V, V2I/N, and V2P), and to investigate potential enhancements for
vehicular services. The study was completed in RAN#72.
In the study, the RAN WGs concluded that it is feasible to support transport
for V2V, V2I/N and V2P services over Uu. The RAN WGs identified solutions to
improve the latency, capacity, and reliability performance of LTE Uu interface
and observed that UL enhancements to the SPS protocol and DL enhancement to
multicast/broadcast are beneficial from performance perspective. In addition,
the RAN WGs concluded that it is feasible to support V2I and V2P servicesover
PC5. It is concluded that V2P services where P-UE sends V2X messages but not
receives V2X messages is substantially more power efficient than V2P services
where P-UE receives V2X messages from V-UEs. The RAN WGs identified that some
changes to the PC5 interface would be beneficial in terms of power consumption
and UE complexity in case of P2V transmissions. RAN WGs also preliminarily
discussed the co-existence between DSRC/IEEE 802.11p and LTE PC5 for V2V. For
deployment of LTE PC5 for V2V and DSRC/IEEE 802.11p in the same geographical
area, RAN WGs think that the ideal option is when they use different frequency
channels. Nevertheless, if they use shared frequency channels, RAN WGs think
they can still co-exist together with some standardizations and/or regulatory
actions in other bodies in order to enable this.
A new work item on architecture enhancements for LTE support of V2X services
was approved in SA2 in S2-163204. In this work item, architecture enhancement
to support V2X services using both PC5 and Uu will be covered.
## 4.2 Objective
The objectives of this work are to specify enhancements to both Uu transport
and PC5 transport in E-UTRAN to support LTE-based V2X (V2V, V2I/N, and V2P)
based on the outcome of the related study.

        -   Based on input from SA2/RAN3, determine whether any
            additional enhancement is necessary to reduce control plane

            if needed \[RAN2\]
    b.  Shorter modification/repetition period(s) of MCCH and SC-MCCH,
        and shorter MCH scheduling period(s) \[RAN2, RAN3\]

in coordination with other working groups [RAN2]
6) To specify other enhancements to PC5/Uu for V2X on the following aspects:
    a.  Support of UE maximum transmission power up to 33 dBm

        PC5 in 5855 MHz \~ 5925 MHz. \[RAN4\]
    b.  Support of QoS depending on the outcome of SA2 work \[RAN2,
        RAN3\]
    c.  Support of inter-PLMN for both PC5 and Uu (Note: Depending on

            agreed by RAN1\#86bis/RAN2\#95bis shall not be considered
            for standardization.
    i.  Handle multiplexing V2V with other signals/channels if

## 4.3 V2X operating scenarios
### 4.3.1 General description
In the V2X WID, a number of scenarios are identified for possible deployment
of V2X services as following.
a. V2V operation based on PC5/Uu
b. V2I operation based on PC5 (UE type RSU) /Uu (eNB type RSU)
c. V2P operation based on PC5/Uu
In V2V WI, RAN4 focus on the single carrier V2V operation. Hence V2V UE only
operated in decicated ITS spectrum (Band 47) based on PC5.
In V2X WI, RAN4 should define the multi carrier V2X operation to support
various V2X operating scenarios as shown in Figure 4.3.1-1 to 4.3.1-3.
a. **PC5 based V2V (b) Uu based V2V**
> Figure 4.3.1-1: V2V operation
a. **PC5 based V2I (b) Uu based V2I**
> Figure 4.3.1-2: V2I operation
a. **PC5 based V2P (b) Uu based V2P**
> Figure 4.3.1-3: V2P operation
Multi-carrier operation for LTE-based V2X service are supported in the two
scenarios as shown in Figure 4.3.1-4.
(a) MCC operation at 5.9GHz (PC5+PC5) (b) MCC operation at 2GHz + 5.9GHz
(Uu+PC5)
> Figure 4.3.1-4: MCC operation in V2X scenarios
### 4.3.2 Operation aspects
Scenarios considered by RAN4 for LTE-based V2X operation (Tx/Rx of V2X
message) are as follows:
  * **(Aspect 1) Operation bands used as test points for evaluation**
    * Case 1A: 5.9 GHz (Dedicated ITS spectrum)
    * Case 1B: 2 GHz
```{=html}
``` \- **(Aspect 2) eNB deployment including the possibility of network >
control**
    -   PC5 based operation :
        -   Case 2A: UE autonomous resource allocation, at least mode 2,
            based on semi-statically network-configured/pre-configured
            radio parameters including no eNB coverage case.
        -   Case 2B: eNB providing more UE specific or/and more dynamic
            resource allocation including Mode 1 compared to case 2A.
        -   Note: Related to aspect 2, it is necessary to consider the
            condition to apply any preconfigured radio parameters.
    -   Uu based operation :
        -   eNB deployment and network control for radio resources are
            always assumed in uplink and downlink.
  * **(Aspect 3) Multi-carrier operation**
Multiple carrier operation can support a number of configurations as shown in
Table 4.3.2-1 including for example:
> **Table 4.3.2-1 MCC operation for LTE-based V2X service**

Based on the Table 4.3.2-1, RAN4 focus on the MCC operations as below in V2X
WI due to interested operator service scenarios and use cases in SA1.
  * **1^st^ priority for MCC operation:**
    * **Multi carrier operation with Band 47 (PC5 V2X) and licensed bands (Uu V2X)**
    * **Multi carrier operation at Band 47 (PC5 V2X)** \+ Band 47 (PC5 V2X) : Contiguous concurrent operation
    * **Multi carrier operation with Band 47 (PC5 V2X) and licensed bands (WAN)**
  * **2^nd^ Priority for MCC operation:**
    * **Multi carrier operation with Band 47(PC5 V2X) and licensed bands (PC5 V2X)**
    * **Multi carrier operation with licensed band (PC5 V2X) and licensed bands (Uu V2X)**
    * **Multi carrier operation at licensed bands (PC5 V2X)**
    * **Multi carrier operation at Band 47 (PC5 V2X)** \+ Band 47 (PC5 V2X) : Non-contiguous concurrent operation
```{=html}
``` \- **(Aspect 4) Operating scenarios**
Single or multiple operator deployments can support these candidate cases for
LTE-based V2X service:
  * Case 4A: Single operator operation
  * Case 4B: A set of PC5/Uu operation carrier(s) is shared by UEs > subscribed to different operators.
    * In this case, UEs belonging to different operators transmit on > the shared uplink carrier(s) while receiving on the shared > downlink carrier(s).
  * Case 4C: Each operator is allocated with a different carrier for > both uplink and downlink.
    * In this case, a UE transmits only on the uplink carrier(s) > allocated to the operator to which it belongs. The UE may > receive on multiple DL carriers, i.e., UE receives on the > downlink carrier allocated to the other operator as well as > the downlink carrier allocated to the operator to which it > belongs.
    * A UE is allowed to receive downlink broadcast of other operator.
> RAN4 will evaluate adjacent channel coexistence as well as analyze RF
> requirements in Rel-14 to support high power V2X UE with up to 33dBm. It is
> proposed that initially V2X operation over PC5/Uu be assumed for a single
> operator on a single carrier. Scenarios with multiple operators can also be
> considered as below according to operating scneraios.
>
> The candidate Case 4B is assumed in ITS spectrum and Case 4C is only
> considered for LTE-based V2V UE in a licensed band.
  * **(Aspect 5) Co-existing with Uu/PC5**
    * PC5 based operation :
      * Case 5A: Dedicated carrier for V2x. There is no uplink (Uu) traffic on the PC5 operation carrier.
      * Case 5B: V2X carrier is shared with Uu.
    * Uu based operation:
      * Case 5A: There is no sidelink traffic on the Uu operation carrier.
      * Case 5B: The uplink carrier is shared with sidelink.
For V2X service at 5.9GHz, the Case 5A can be assumed. Case 5B is not RAN4
scope for coexistence evaluation.
#### 4.3.2.1 Licensed bands operation
Regarding the inter-band MCC, it can be alternatively classified as two
scenarios based on whether the licensed bands support PC5 V2X service. The
following part outlines the impact on the RF requirements and possible issues
for these two scenarios.
#### 4.3.2.1.1 Scenario 1: Uu based V2X and legacy WAN service at licensed
bands
  * _[RF requirements for the licensed bands]{.underline}_
Though Uu V2X and WAN are two different services for the licensed bands, the
physical layer designs are the same. The RF requirements are based on legacy
LTE UE for both cases.
It is a common view that separate antennas would be used for low bands and
5GHz LAA band, i.e. Band 46. As Band 47 is part of the spectrum of Band 46,
the assumptions in study of Band 46 are also valid for Band 47 related band
combinations when we consider the RF requirements. It is noted that trap filer
is not considered for some band combinations with Band 46 and RAN4 agreed not
to specify MSD requirements for the frequency range in Band 46 which is hit by
the harmonics of the low bands for LTE service. This method may not be
appropriate for V2X Band combinations, as V2X needs to consider the safety
issue, the performance of Band 47 cannot be degraded too much for band
combinations with harmonic issue. Thus the harmonic issue shall be studied
carefully for some of the band combinations in next release as agreed phased
approach to introduce new licensed band for V2X operation.
#### 4.3.2.1.2 Scenario 2: PC5 based V2X service at licensed bands
  * _[RF requirements for the licensed bands]{.underline}_
    * [_Co-existence of V2X UE(PC5) and legacy WAN UE(Uu) on different carrier_]{.underline}
Based on the coexistence simulation results, it was identified that without
interference mitigation scheme, licensed bands supporting PC5 based Sidelink
transmission cannot co-exist well with legacy LTE system, and it will cause
more than 5% throughput loss for some cases, especially to the cell edge
performance. Though power control can be helpful to reduce the interference,
the OLPC scheme is not optimized by RAN1 design, which means it may not always
work well in the network. That is part of the reason why scenario of licensed
bands support PC5 V2X service has low priority at this stage. So RAN4 did not
support corresponding RF requirements for PC5 based V2X UE at the licensed
bands.
  * [_Co-existence of V2X UE(PC5) and legacy WAN UE(Uu) on the same carrier_]{.underline}
Issues on the co-existence of PC5 and legacy Uu on the same carrier were also
discussed. For this case, more studies are needed from the perspective of
synchronization/timing performance on PC5.
For the bands supporting PC5 interface, the physical layer design is different
from the LTE UE.
For instance, PSCCH and PSSCH for sidelink are not the same as PUCCH and PUSCH
for uplink, which means MPR/A-MPR shall be redefined for the licensed bands if
these bands need to support PC5 V2X service. Also there was no decision how to
support PC5 based V2X transmission and legacy WAN Uu at same carrier such as
TDM operation or FDM operations.
And for the receiver side, the REFSENS requirements for target SNR of V2X UE
has been changed compared to legacy LTE UE, thus the REFSENS for licensed
bands shall be defined accordingly for PC5 V2X service.
Whether other RF requirements are impacted needs further study.

# 5 Common issues for V2V/V2X services
## 5.1 Coxistence evaluation aspect
For the V2V coexistence evaluation at licensed band, RAN4 agreed the
additional coexistence simulation assumption as below. To evaluate adjacent
channel coexistence at licensed bands, RAN4 follow the general coexistence
simulation assumptions in section 5.4 in TR36.785 v1.0.0
### 5.1.1 Power control
OLPC scheme should be used for several minimum output power values can be
evaluated, e.g. -10dBm, 0dBm and 10dBm.
  * Rmin in the power control formula should be adjusted according to the minimum output power
> Table 5.1.1-1 Power control schemes

### 5.1.2 UE activation rate
Basically, same simulation for UE activation rate assumption is considered as
1% activation rate for V2V UE in coexistence study.
Other activation rate can be considered optionally with different CAM
intervals
  * 15km: 0.1%
  * 60km:0.33%
5.1.3 Conclusion with revised simulation assumptions
The PC5-based V2V UE coexistence evaluations are performed at 2GHz operating
frequency range with some revised simulation assumptions in section 5.1. The
adjacent coexistence simulation results are summarized in sub-clause 5.1.3.
Based on the evaluation results,
  1. For Case1 (V2X UE-to-LTE BS at 2GHz), following observations are made:
     * Based on the revised simulation assumptions in the TR, the co-existence criteria is not met in some scenarios.
       * Power control evaluation :
         * For minimum output power = -10dBm & 0dBm, neglectable impact is observed to victim LTE BS.
           * Reduced output power in Case1 will be coupled in Case2
         * For minimum output power = 10dBm, unacceptable degradation (>5% throughput loss) is still observed to victim LTE BS for V2V speed of 15km/h.
       * Activation rate evaluation :
         * For LTE with PC set2, unacceptable degradation (>5% throughput loss) is still observed to victim LTE BS for edge throughput.
Further study on the open loop power control schemes is needed in RAN1/RAN4
and will need to be revisited in the next enhanced V2X WI if not addressed in
the current WI.
  1. For Case 2 (LTE UE-to-V2X UE at 2GHz), LTE system adjacent interference will cause very little performance loss to V2V system. However, this case is coupled with Case 1.
     * Power control evaluation :
       * With some scenarios employing power control schemes, the V2V PRR loss may become worse and unstable;
       * The power control can mitigate the interference from V2V UE to LTE UE, but V2V system performance becomes worse so further study and discussion is needed in RAN4.
Optimized open loop power control can be considered as one solution to protect
adjacent legacy LTE systems.
Other alternative solutions also consider to protect adjacent systems.
## 5.2 Transmitter characteristics
### 5.2.1 MPR requirements
MPR simulation is done to meet general LTE ACLR and SEM requirements. Based on
the simulation results, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the
maximum output power due to higher order modulation and transmit bandwidth
configuration (resource blocks) is specified as follows:

For transmissions with PSCCH and PSSCH in non-adjacent resource blocks in
single component carrier, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the
maximum output power is specified as follows
MPR = CEIL {M~A~, 0.5}
Where M~A~ is defined as follows

### 5.2.3 CEN DSRC Protection
To protect operation of electronic toll collection in the frequency band 5 795
MHz to 5 815 MHz from harmful interference, mitigation techniques have to be
implemented as defined in ETSI TS 102 792. Different co-existence modes to
protect CEN DSRC and HDR DSRC are defined in ETSI TS 102 792.
#### 5.2.3.1 Normal mode
ECC/DEC(08)01 [i.2], ECC/REC(08)01 [i.3], and ETSI EN 302 571 [i.5] regulate
output power level and unwanted emissions for ITS stations (see table 5.2).
Operation limited only by these requirements is referred to as normal mode.
Table 5.2.3.1-1: RX blocking for Normal mode
{width="6.259722222222222in" height="0.9895833333333334in"}
NOTE: Some ITS-G5A/B/D channels have other limits for the output power level,
see ETSI EN 302 571 [i.5], clause 6.3.
#### 5.2.3.2 Coexistence mode
In coexistence mode additional restrictions apply. These restrictions apply to
output power level, unwanted emissions and transmit timing. The restrictions
are designed to decrease the interference from ITS stations to a level which
implies no harmful performance degradation of CEN DSRC based toll stations.
An ITS station may be designed to operate in coexistence mode all the time.
Four different coexistence modes, designated A, B, C, and D are defined (see
table 5.3). An ITS station shall choose one of these modes when applicable.
Table 5.2.3.2-1: RX blocking for Coexistence mode
{width="6.692361111111111in" height="1.3333333333333333in"}
#### 5.2.3.3 Requirements for CEN DSRC Protection
For handling CEN DSRC interference mitigation, RAN4 included additional
configured transmitted power requirement and UE to UE coexistence spurious
emission requirements need to be specified in 3GPP TS36.101.
The V2X UE is allowed to set its configured maximum output power P~CMAX,_c_ ~
for component carrier _c_. The configured maximum output power P~CMAX,_c_ ~ is
set within the following bounds:
P~CMAX_L,_c_ ~ â‰¤ P~CMAX,_c_ ~ â‰¤ P~CMAX_H,_c_ ~ with
P~CMAX_L,_c_ ~ = MIN {P~EMAX,_c_ ~ -- âˆ†T~C,_c_ ~, P~PowerClass~ ---- MAX(MPR
_~c~_ \+ A-MPR _~c~_ \+ Î”T~IB,c~ + âˆ†T~C,_c_ ~ + âˆ†T~ProSe~, P-MPR _~c~_),
P~Regulatory,c~ }
P~CMAX_H,_c_ ~ = MIN {P~EMAX,_c_ ~, P~PowerClass~, P~Regulatory,c~ }
where
> \- For the total transmitted power P~CMAX,c~ of PSSCH and PSCCH, P~EMAX,c~
> is the value given by IE _maxTxPower_ , defined by [7], when the UE is not
> associated with a serving cell on the V2X carrier .
>
> \- For$P_{\text{CMAX},\text{PSBCH}}$, P~EMAX,_c_ ~ is the value given by the
> IE _maxTxPower_ in [7] when the UE is not associated with a serving cell on
> the V2X carrier.
>
> \- For$P_{\text{CMAX},\text{SSSS}}$, the value is as calculated for
> $P_{\text{CMAX},\text{PSBCH}}$ and applying the MPR for SSSS as specified in
> Section 6.2.3D.
>
> \- P~PowerClass~ is the maximum UE power specified in Table 6.2.2-1 without
> taking into account the tolerance specified in the Table 6.2.2-1;
>
> \- MPR _~c~_ and A-MPR _~c~_ for serving cell _c_ are specified in subclause
> 6.2.3G and subclause 6.2.4G, respectively;
>
> \- âˆ† _T~IB,c~_ , âˆ†T~C,_c_ ~, âˆ†T~ProSe~ and P-MPR _~c~_ are specified in
> subclause 6.2.5
>
> \- P~Regulatory,c~ = 10 dBm when the CEN DSRC tolling system is nearby V2X
> UE; P~Regulatory,c~ = 33 dBm otherwise.
P-MPR _~c~_ is the allowed maximum output power reduction for
a) ensuring compliance with applicable electromagnetic energy absorption
requirements and addressing unwanted emissions / self desense requirements in
case of simultaneous transmissions on multiple RAT(s) for scenarios not in
scope of 3GPP RAN specifications;
b) ensuring compliance with applicable electromagnetic energy absorption
requirements in case of proximity detection is used to address such
requirements that require a lower maximum output power.
The UE shall apply P-MPR _~c~_ for serving cell _c_ only for the above cases.
For UE conducted conformance testing P-MPR shall be 0 dB
NOTE 1: P-MPR _~c~_ was introduced in the P~CMAX,_c_ ~ equation such that the
UE can report to the eNB the available maximum output transmit power. This
information can be used by the eNB for scheduling decisions.
NOTE 2: P-MPR _~c~_ may impact the maximum uplink performance for the selected
UL transmission path.
UE to UE coexistence spurious emission requirements are specified as below
Table 5.2.3.3-1.

#### 5.3.1.1 Region 1 Regulatory Sensitivities
The regional requirements are defined with respect to different combinations
of modulation and target coding rate. The requirement only applies to the set
of modulation and target coding rates (MCS) that the equipment supports. Thus,
for V2X, regional sensitivity requirements only applies to 4 combinations:
QPSK, target rate 1/2; QPSK, target rate 3/4; 16QAM, target rate 1/2; 16QAM,
target rate 3/4. The only supported channel bandwidth is 10MHz.
3GPP methodology is to define only one _[reference]{.underline}_ sensitivity
with respect to QPSK modulation and target coding rate of 1/3. The purpose of
this is to test Noise Figure and Implementation Margin of UEs. Given the same
Noise Figure and Implementation Margin, the expected sensitivity level of
other MCSs can be calculated based on the same parameters with SNR~V2V~
defined as the demodulation SNR level required to achieve 10% frame error rate
at the corresponding MCS. The simulation results for the required demodulation
SNR can be found in Figure 5.3.1.1-1, Figure 5.3.1.1-2 and Figure 5.3.1.1-3.
The coding rate in the simulation is the information bits compare to the
effective channel bits.

### 5.3.2 ACS
Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) requirement for V2V is specified in TS
36.101 as below. As 10MHz is typical channel bandwidth used in the V2V band,
the interferer bandwidth shall be changed to 10MHz instead of 5MHz.

#### 5.3.2.1 Region 1 Regulatory Selectivities
For Region 1, there are additional selectivity requirements that are specified
in EN 302 571.
Table : Limits for receiver adjacent channel rejection,\ alternate adjacent
channel rejection, and blocking
* * *
Modulation Coding rate Adjacent channel rejection (dB) Alternate adjacent
channel rejection (dB) BPSK 1/2 16 32 BPSK 3/4 15 31 QPSK 1/2 13 29 QPSK 3/4

* * *
The selectivity requirements are specified for each combination of Modulation
order and target coding rate as two values adjacent channel rejection (ACR)
and alternate adjacent channel rejection (A-ACR). The definitions of ACR and
A-ACR are as bellows:
> _The adjacent channel rejection is a measure of the capability of the
> receiver to operate satisfactorily in the presence of a signal in the
> adjacent channel, which differs in frequency from the wanted signal by Â± 10
> MHz._
>
> _The alternate channel rejection is a measure of the capability of the
> receiver to operate satisfactorily in the presence of a signal in the
> alternate adjacent channel, which differs in frequency from the wanted
> signal by Â± 20 MHz_.
In figure 5.3.2.1-1 is an illustration of the selectivity conformance test
described in Clause 5.3.7 of [9]. The wanted signal is set at 3dB above the
sensitivity level and the interference signal is set at ACR dBc above the
wanted signal, i.e.
P~signal~ = P~sensitive~ + 3 (eq. 1)
P~interf~ = P~sensitive~ + 3 + ACR (dBm). (eq. 2)
Taking P~sensitive~ values for each MCS as defined by the Regional Required
Sensitivity, all the corresponding values can be computed and gathered in
table 5.3.2.1-1.

-66 64-QAM 2/3 -69 0 -66 64-QAM 3/4 -68 -1 -66
* * *
Given the parameter setting in Table 5.3.2.1-1, the remaining interference
power after being antenuated is
P~interf,\ remained~ = P~interf~ -- ACS = -66 -- 33 = -99 (dBm)
The total noise and interference power is hence
P~I\ +\ N~ = 10 * log10( 10\^(-9.9) + 10\^(-9.1)) = -90.4 (dBm)
Where noise floor is -91dBm coming from thermal noise of -104dBm and noise
figure of 13dB. The expected minimum decodable input signal level can be
computed as
P~decode~ = P~I\ +\ N~ + SNR~V2V~ + IM = -87.9 + SNR~V2V~ (dBm)
Where SNR~V2V~ is defined base of the demodulation simulation results in
Section 7.1.1 TS 36.101 and IM is 2.5dB. The expected decode signal strength
of V2V and the margin to the required decoded signal strength is captured in
Table 5.3.2.1-2. Note that by conformance requirements, the required decode
signal strength is set at 3dB higher than the regional required sensitivity.

* * *
For A-ACR, the interferer is assumed to be at 20MHz frequency offset from the
channel center. Eventhough 3GPP does not specify corresponding Alternative
ACS, the selectivity level is expected to be much (at least of order a few dB)
higher than ACS. Let's re-use the ACS value for this case as a pessimistic
estimation. Following the same approach and replacing ACR values with the
corresponding A-ACR, we can calculate the ETSI conformance test parameters.
The calculated values are captured in Table 5.3.2.1-3.

64-QAM 2/3 -69 16 -50 64-QAM 3/4 -68 15 -50
* * *
Following the same approach as before, the remaining interference power after
being antenuated is
P~interf,\ remained~ = P~interf~ -- ACS = -50 -- 33 = -83 (dBm)
The total noise and interference power is
P~I\ +\ N~ = 10 * log10( 10\^(-8.3) + 10\^(-9.1)) = -82.5 (dBm)
The expected minimum decodable input signal level can be computed as
P~decode~ = P~I\ +\ N~ + SNR~V2V~ + IM = -80 + SNR~V2V~ (dBm)
With IM assumed to be 2.5dB. With this input, the expected decode signal
strength for V2V in alternate selectivity conformance test and the margin
w.r.t. to the required decode signal strength are captured in Table 5.3.2.1-4.
Note that even though the margin is only 0 or 16QAM code rate 3/4, the
realistic margin will be much higher since we assume very pessimistic A-ACS
value here.

### 6.2.3 Simulation Results
#### 6.2.3.1 V2X Communications in ITS spectrum
### 6.2.3.1.1 Case3a: V2X UE-to-DSRC UE
The legacy DSRC system PRR loss in Manhattan grid models are summarized in
sub-clause 6.2.3.1.1 based on transmit packet size, V2X UE maximum power and
V2X UE velocity.
6.2.3.1.1.1 Huawei simulation results
Co-existence simulation results for case 3a of V2V UE to DSRC UE in urban
scenario were provided inError: Reference source not found below Table based
on the simulation assumptions. ACLR for V2X high power UE assumes 31dBc and
37dBc, ACS for DSRC assumes 29dBc. Average PRR at 50m for 15 km/h and average
PRR at 150m for 60 km/h are used as the agreed performance metric. PRR loss is
the PRR with V2X/V2V adjacent interference compared with the PRR without any
adjacent channel interference.
Table 6.2.3.1.1.1-1 PRR loss for Case 3a
+----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | PRR loss | at 50m | at 150m | | | | | range for | range for | | | | | 15km/h | 60km/h | | | +----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | | Normal V2V | Higher V2X | Normal V2V | Higher V2X | | | power | power | power | power | | | | | | | | | (23dBm) | (33dBm) | (23dBm) | (33dBm) | +----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | 190 Byte | 1.49% | 2.20% | 3.5% | 4.37% | +----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | 300 Byte | 1.68% | 2.52% | 3.47% | 4.84% | +----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
From the above simulation results, some observations can be derived as below:
  * For both PRR loss at 50m range for 15km/h and at 150m range for 60km/h, V2X UE with higher power makes acceptable interference to DSRC victim which means V2X UE with higher power is a good neighbour to DSRC;
  * All the PRR loss is less than 5%.
Therefore, V2X UE with higher power can co-existence well with DSRC system
with LTE ACLR requirement which is 31dBc.
### 6.2.3 Conclusions
The PC5-based V2X high power UE coexistence evaluations are performed at
5.9GHz operating frequency range in Rel-14 V2X WI. The adjacent coexistence
simulation results are summarized in above section. Based on the evaluation
results, the PC5-based V2X high power UE will be within acceptable operating
limits for adjacent channel coexistence scenarios at 5.9GHz.

However, the legacy LTE service on licensed band are considered, the
configured transmitted power will be decided by priority between legacy LTE
transmission and V2X transmission.

Expected no need to change the requirements for multi-carrier V2X UE. The
legacy minimum output power requirements will be applied on CC of licensed
band and the V2X minimum output power requirements will be applied on CC of
Band 47 for inter-band con-current V2X operation.

general time mask, PSSS/SSSS time mask and PSSCH.SRS time mask except
PSSS/SSSS/PSBCH time mask for ProSe UE apply on CC of Band 47, the time mask
requirements in section 6.3.4 in TS36.101 for LTE system apply on CC of
licensed band.
One remaining issue to support the PSSS/SSSS/PSBCH time mask for single

PSBCH. Hence below new ON/OFF time mask will be added for single carrier V2X
UE.
7.1.1.7.1 PSSS / SSSS / PSBCH time mask for single carrier
The PSSS/SSSS/PSBCH time mask defines the observation period between SSSS and
adjacent PSSS/PSBCH symbols in a subframe, with last symbol punctured to
create a guard period.

``` \- Option1: Power class 2 + antenna gain (up to 6dBi)
    -   PROS: Easy specify to support high max. power, follow legacy
        Transmission RF requirements except ACLR and ACS
    -   CONS: Need technical support to satisfy the 26dBm maximum output
        power at antenna connector in ITS spectrum

a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of an
unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of the spurious response
or the adjacent channels, without this unwanted input signal causing a
degradation of the performance of the receiver beyond a specified limit. The
blocking performance shall apply at all frequencies except those at which a
spurious response occur.

### 8.2.4.3 Narrow band blocking
It is proposed that narrow-band blocking requirements do not apply in the
presence of a narrow-band interferer in Band 47.
## 8.2.5 Spurious response
Spurious response is a measure of the receiver\'s ability to receive a wanted
signal on its assigned channel frequency without exceeding a given degradation
due to the presence of an unwanted CW interfering signal at any other
frequency at which a response is obtained.
It's proposed the current requirement defined for power class 3 V2X UE
operating on single carrier should apply, as shown in Table 8.2.5-1 and Table
8.2.5-2.

## 8.2.6 Intermodulation characteristics
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific frequency
relationship to the wanted signal.
It's proposed the current requirement defined for power class 3 V2X UE
operating on single carrier should apply, as shown in Table 8.2.6-1.

## 8.2.7 RX spurious emissions
The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or amplified
in a receiver that appear at the UE antenna connector.
It's proposed the current requirement defined for power class 3 V2X UE
operating on single carrier should apply, as shown in Table 8.2.7-1 and Table
8.2.7-2.
Table 8.2.7-1: General receiver spurious emission requirements for power class
2 V2X
+------------------------------+-------------+---------------+------+ | Frequency band | Measurement | Maximum level | NOTE | | | | | | | | bandwidth | | | +------------------------------+-------------+---------------+------+ | 30MHz â‰¤ f \2m above the ground level
* * *
The additional Rx spurious emission limits, however, are specified in EIRP.
Furthermore, the requirement varies based on antenna installation. It is FFS
how to convert this to conducted requirements.
# 9 Other specification impacts (if applicable)
These way forword were considered to specify the V2X RRM requirements
  * **UE Tx timing requirement**
    * The scenario of shared carrier for WAN and PC5 V2X is not considered for RRM requirements in the current WI, assuming RF session will not define requirements for it.
    * For V2X on Band 47 carrier, NTA offset should be always zero.
    * Send a clarification to RAN1 to inform about RAN4 agreement and scenario that prioritized in RAN4.
  * **Interruption**
    * V-UE requirement on WAN interruptions
      * Case 2: Not capture this requirement
      * Case 3: FFS
        * Do not define if Case 3 is not supported in RF room
    * WAN/GNSS timing misalignment
      * Do not define
    * V2X (re)configuration
      * Specify 1 subframe WAN interruptions due to V2X (re)configuration
    * Synchronous source change
      * UE is allowed to drop V2V SL TX/RX for up to [1] subframe for every synchronization source change
    * V2V/V2X interruptions due to WAN operation
      * Do not define interruptions in Rel-14. Keep up to UE implementation.
```{=html}
``` \- **Initiation/cease of SLSS requirements**
    -   When timing reference is eNB/GNSS
        -   Reuse Rel-12/13 in-coverage ProSe requirements when UE is
            in-coverage
    -   When timing reference is SyncRef UE
        -   Reuse D2D measurement accuracy
        -   Measurement period = 320ms
        -   Evaluation period = 640ms
  * **Selection/Reselection of V2X Sync.Ref.**
    * Selection/Reselection to SyncRef UE
    * GNSS is highest priority
      * UE is synchronized to GNSS directly: No SLSS and data drop allowed
      * UE is Synced to SyncRefUE that is directly or in-directly synced to GNSS
        * Not allow drop Data
        * Need SLSS drop
          * Side condition = [0] dB
          * Tdetect,SyncRef UE = [1.6]seconds
          * Allow to drop maximum [30]% of its transmission during Tdetect,SyncRef UE
          * [3]samples based
      * Other case
        * Allow drop Data & SLSS
        * Side condition = [0] dB
        * Tdetect,SyncRef UE = [8]seconds
        * Allow to drop maximum [6]% of its transmission during Tdetect,SyncRef UE
    * Selection/Reselection to SyncRef UE
      * eNB is configured with the highest priority
        * Allow drop Data & SLSS
        * Side condition = [0] dB
        * Tdetect,SyncRef UE = [8]seconds
        * Allow to drop maximum [6]% of its transmission during Tdetect,SyncRef UE
      * Decision are TBC based on RAN1 agreements in Feb meeting
    * UE measurement capability of performing S-RSRP
      * V-UE : [3] identified SLSS
      * P-UE : No SLSS related requirement is defined
    * GNSS synchronization source reselection evaluation period
      * Define evaluation period for synch source reselection from GNSS to another synch source. Value is TBD.
        * Add a note that value will be finalize in Performance part or as maintenance
```{=html}
``` \- **Cell detection requirements in OOC**
    -   Not define due to there is no cell on carrier of V2X sidelink
        communication in Rel-14
  * **Autonomous Resource (re)selection**
    * Only define the PSSCH-RSRP and S-RSSI measurement accuracy requirements for UE autonomous resource selection/reselection
    * PSSCH-RSRP measurement accuracy is specified for only absolute measurement.
      * Absolute accuracy: Â± [5] dB at Es/Iot â‰¥[0]dB
    * S-RSSI measurement accuracy
      * Reuse RSSI measurement accuracy in LAA
      * Measurement period
        * Filtered measurement requirements & measurement period= 1second
  * **Congestion control**
    * For CBR measurement, single-shot measurement requirements of S-RSSI shall be defined.
