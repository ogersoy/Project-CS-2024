# Introduction
Currently, 3GPP has defined only Power Class UE 3 as the type of UE supported
for TDD LTE band 41 operations. This definition was based on aligning TDD LTE
Band 41 UE power classes with prior work in 3GPP related to other bands.
However, it should be mentioned that 3GPP UE Power Class 3 definition (i.e.
23dBm) was mainly driven to ensure backward compatibility with prior
technologies (i.e. GSM/UMTS) [2] so that network deployment topologies remain
similar. Furthermore, maintaining the same power class UE definition (i.e.
Class 3) as previous technologies would maintaining compliance with various
national regulatory rulings, particularly in terms of SAR, for FDD LTE
duplexing mode.
However, TDD LTE band 41 does not have any 3GPP legacy technologies associated
with it, hence the backward compatibility consideration is not applicable in
its case. Also, since band 41 is defined as a TDD LTE band, it is less
susceptible to SAR levels that FDD LTE bands due to SAR definition. Therefore,
defining a new UE power class with higher than 23dBm Tx power for TDD LTE Band
41 operations would not compromise any of 3GPP foundational work, while
improving UE and network performance. It should also be mentioned that 3GPP
has done similar work on other bands (i.e. band 14) when defining a higher
power class UE, hence the concept presented in this document is a continuation
of that process.
The present document carries out a feasibility analysis for defining a UE
Power class 2 (i.e. 26dBm) for operation on TDD LTE band 41. The document
analyses current and future technological advancements in the area of UE RF
front-end components and architectures that enable such definition while
maintaining 3GPP specification and other regulatory bodies\' requirements. It
should be emphasized that this proposal only relates to single carrier UL
operations on TDD band 41 (i.e. TM-1/2 modes) without affecting current 3GPP
definition for UL carrier aggregation on band 41.
# 1 Scope
The scope of the present document is to evaluate the feasibility of increasing
UL TX power in Band 41 from 23dBm +/-2dB (Power Class 3) to 26dBm +/-2dB
(Power Class 2) as well as discuss impacts (if any) to other 3GPP bands and
regulatory requirements.

# 4 Background
## 4.1 Justification
4G LTE is in general an UL constrained technology mainly due to differences on
Tx powers between DL and UL, number of antennas deployed in eNB versus UEs,
and other technological aspects of the technology. To that end,
TDD LTE Band 41 coverage is UL limited as indicated in TR 36.824. Link budget
analysis indicates a delta of up to \~5 dB between DL and UL, depending on
network deployment parameters. Therefore, , increasing UL Tx power on UE side
would reduce the link budget differences between DL and UL, hence increasing
TDD LTE band 41 coverage, which results in significant network deployment
savings. RF simulation tool evaluation shows up to \~30 % increase in TDD LTE
Band 41 coverage area from 3dB increase in UL Tx power. Therefore, it is
important/critical to pursue means to improve UL transmit power.
The present document analyses such enabling technologies to meet the Band 41
power increase needs as well as any performance impacts to other 3GPP bands
and regulatory requirements.
## 4.2 Objective
\- The study is limited to evaluating the transmission and reception impact
and values for single carrier UL operation for Band 41 E-UTRA UE Power Class 2
(+26 dBm)
\- Assess Band 41 HPUE impact on the performance of licensed bands other than
band 41.
\- The study item needs to take into account the co-existence and
compatibility of LTE systems deployed in the 2.5 GHz band. e.g. ACLR/ OOBE.
\- Assess Band 41 power class 2 potential impacts to TDD/FDD carrier
aggregation band combinations.
\- Study the impact and potential values for the Core RF requirements for RAN4
E-UTRA specifications for TDD Band 41.
\- Study to maintain the same co-existence impact as Band 41 power class 3 in
terms of throughput/OOB emissions from the B41 HPUE to adjacent band through
tighter requirements for the HPUE where applicable.
\- Study the use of new power amplifier models to minimize the impact to AMPR
and with minimal impact to battery life.
\- Study impact on eNode B blocking requirements.
# 5 Deployment and Coexistence Studies
## 5.1 General
## 5.2 Band 41
## 5.3 Band 7
The RF front end architecture for a given smartphone design depend on various
factors, including the required configuration and performance targets.
For the UE architectures with dedicate power amplifier modules for each band
and power class, enabling power class 2 on Band 41 does not have any
performance impacts to Band 7. The most common architecture found in Figure
5.3-1 is currently present in many smartphone implementations, including Tier
1 OEMs which already use separate TDD and FDD Tx chains on power class 3 UEs
for better performance.
{width="4.751388888888889in" height="1.8131944444444446in"}
Figure 5.3-1: Separate Power Amplifier Modules
Qorvo and Skyworks have indicated no band 7 performance impacts due to the use
of power class 2 on Band 41 in implementations with separate FDD and TDD TX
chains.
Where a shared power class 2 power amplifier is used across TDD and FDD high
frequency bands, the 3dB back-off may incur a 2.4 % to 3 % efficiency
degradation. A degradation of \~3 % in efficiency with Power class 2
supporting shared band solutions at 23dBm is equivalent to a degradation
resulting from an additional 0.25dB extra post-PA loss due to mismatch, filter
contour non-idealities, additional trace or coupler losses, implementation of
harmonic or coexistence filtering, etc. This efficiency degradation may be
further mitigated through improvements to matching networks and reduction in
filter insertion losses.
{width="4.590972222222222in" height="1.9868055555555555in"}
Figure 5.3-2: Shared Power Amplifier Module
The impact of enabling class 2 operation in the common power amplifier
architecture, Figure 5.3-2 is well within the variation caused by design
choices made by the UE manufacturer. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that
when such option is selected, FDD LTE band 7 of power class 3 implementation
could benefit by offering close to +25dBm at antenna port (i.e. close to power
class 3 upper limit definition), which would increase coverage and improve
overall user experience on band 7.
## 5.4 Band 38
The RF front end architecture for a given smartphone design depend on various
factors, including the required configuration and performance targets.
{width="4.7444444444444445in" height="1.99375in"}
Figure 5.4-1: Dedicated Power class 2 and 3 implementation
This architecture uses separate PA implementations for Band 41 and Band 7/38.
Band 41 utilizes a power class 2 PA whereas Band 7/38 uses a legacy power
class 3 PA. This architecture is unlikely to have any performance impact to
Band 7 /38 Tx chain since most RF front end components in TX / Rx chain are
unchanged from current implementation. The only change to current
implementation would be an addition of Band 41 power class 2 PA. It is also
noted that these components may be integrated into a single module supporting
both PA Tx chains. In clause 5.3 it was shown that when a shared PA is used
for power class 3 and 2 devices one can expect a nominal 2.4 % efficiency
degradation. This shared PA architecture impact is further mitigated by the
effect of limited TDD frame configuration duty cycle at worst case of 40 %,
reducing the impact of any additional in-slot DC current by dividing by a
factor of 2.5 when calculating the average DC current.
## 5.5 Impact to TDD/FDD carrier aggregation band combinations
Current B41-related CA requirements only apply to B41 Power Class 3 UE
operation. B41 Power Class 2 UE can operate in B41 related CA only in Power
Class 3 fallback mode, which must meet the current B41-related CA
requirements. As long as the current B41-related CA requirements are met,
implementations supporting both B41 single carrier Power Class 2 and Power
Class 3 CA requirements using Power Class 3 fallback mode are not precluded.
CA Requirements for B41 in Power Class 2 can be identified by separate CA+HPUE
WIs for each combination, after completion of B41 Power Class 2 single carrier
specification.
## 5.6 WiFi
For WiFi coexistence, HPUE terminals must provide at least the level of
protection given the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band that is in current terminals. If
there is any throughput degradation in current power class 3 devices, power
class 2 devices shall not perform any worse.
## 5.7 Regulatory Requirements
### 5.7.1 MS Transmit Power
To ease compliance with SAR requirements, a note should be added to the UE
power class table, Table 6.2.2-1: UE Power Class in TS 36.101, indicating that
class 2 Band 41 UEs are only applicable to TDD uplink/downlink configurations
1-5. For example:
NOTE : For power class 2 UE\'s operating in Band 41, only TDD UL/DL
configurations 1 -- 5 are applicable.
### 5.7.2 UE Emission Limits
## 5.8 Co-existence and compatibility of LTE systems deployed in the 2.5 GHz
band
### 5.8.1 Simulation assumptions
#### 5.8.1.1 Macro cell Propagation model
##### 5.8.1.1.1 Macro cell Propagation model - Urban and Suburban Areas
The propagation model is a derived from TR 36.942 [5].
Considering a carrier frequency of 2.6 GHz and a base station antenna height
of 15 m above average rooftop level, the propagation model is given by the
following equation:
$L = \text{130}\text{.}5 + \text{37}\text{.}\text{6log}_{\text{10}}(R)$
where:
R is the base station-UE separation in kilometres
##### 5.8.1.1.2 Macro cell Propagation model - Rural Area
The propagation model is a derived from TR 36.942 [5].
For rural area, the Hata model is not applicable for a carrier frequency of
2.6 GHz, while the modified Hata model can be used:
_Case 1_ : _d_ ≤ 0.6 km
$L\ = \ \text{100}\text{.}7\ + \ \text{10}\ \text{log}(d^{2}\ + \
0\text{.}\text{00189225})$
_Case 2_ : _d_ > 0.6 km
$L\ = \ \text{103}\text{.}9\ + \ \text{34}\text{.}1\ \text{log}(d)$
where: d is the base station-UE separation in kilometres
#### 5.8.1.2 Power Control Modelling
In TR 36.942 [5] the transmit power is solely based on the coupling loss
between the UE and the eNB. The maximum power is capped by P~max~ which is the
maximum power of the UE. The UE output power formula in TR 36.942 [5] is shown
in Equation 5.8.1.2-1.
{width="4.115277777777778in" height="3.7506944444444446in"}
Figure 5.8.1.2-1: TR 36.942 UE output power
$P_{t} = P_{\text{max}} \times \text{min}\left{ 1,\ \text{max}\left\lbrack
R_{\text{min}},\ \left( \frac{\text{CL}}{\text{CL}_{x - \text{ile}}}
\right)^{\gamma} \right\rbrack \right}$ Equation 5.8.1.2-1 TR 36.942 UE output
power
Where _P_ ~max~ is the maximum transmit power, _R_ ~min~ is the minimum power
reduction ratio to prevent UEs with good channels to transmit at very low
power level, _CL_ is the path coupling loss defined as max{path loss-G_Tx-
G_Rx, MCL}, where path loss is propagation loss plus shadow fading, G_TX is
the transmitter antenna gain in the direction of the receiver, G_RX is the
receiver antenna gain in the direction of the transmitter and CLx-ile is the
x-percentile CL value. With this power control equation, the x percent of UEs
that have the highest coupling loss will transmit at Pmax. Finally, 0\ 23dBm (Note 1) Cell average

Based on the above simulation results, it can be observed that in expanded

##### 5.10.2.1.4 Qualcomm simulation results
Figure 5.10.2.1.4-1 shows the UE tx power distribution considering the new ISD
proposed for Scenario A1 for all the simulated environments. As it can be
observed, and as expected, with the ISD the UL power for the aggressor system
is around 3dB higher (mean value). However it is worth noticing that the
interferer level at the base station victim due to adjacent channel
interference is not exactly 3dB higher compared to the case in which ISD is
the same for aggressor and victim system. This is simply due to the fact that
the aggressor UE - victim BS distance distribution is not the same in the two
cases.
A summary of the simulation results obtained is shown in Table 5.10.2.1.4-1.
As it can be observed the ACLR tightening needed is always less than 2 dB.

Based on the simulation results, the following can be observed:
The percentage of UEs transmitting above 23dBm is around 5 % and 10 %
respectively for PC Set 4A and 4B.
For ISD=0.75 km, it requires around 1dB of ACLR tightening for Set 4A, and
around 2 dB of ACLR tightening for Set 4B.
For ISD=2.8/6.0/8.0 km, it requires around 1dB of ACLR tightening for Set
4A/4B.
Moreover, the cell edge throughput gain for aggressor system by the
introduction of HPUE is also provided in Table 5.10.2.2.1-1, and it can be
observed that:
For PC Set 4A, the gain of cell edge throughput is less than 1 % for most
cases.
For PC Set 4B, the gain of cell edge throughput is around 5 %.

Based on the additional simulation results, it can be observed:
\- For average throughput loss, 1 dB of additional ACLR is enough to guarantee
the same level of performance degradation, at least for PC set 4A and 4B.
\- For 5 %-tile throughput loss, around 1 dB of additional ACLR is enough to
guarantee the same level of performance degradation, at least for PC set 4A
and 4B (except the case of ISD=8km and PC set B).
# 6 B41 HPUE transmitter characteristics
[Editor\'s note: The following clause numbers align with TS 36.101 v12.7.0]
## 6.1 General
## 6.2 Transmit power
### 6.2.1 Void
### 6.2.2 UE maximum output power
In this subclause it is proposed the maximum output power, power class and
tolerance should be defined in line with the study item objectives as defined
in RP-151104. This would be to add an additional higher Power class (Power
Class 2) for B41 to the UE Power class table with a nominal power of +26 dBm.
It is proposed the tolerance be specified as ±2 dB, aligned with the tolerance
in the existing Power Class 3.
The following B41 UE Power Classes define the maximum output power for any
transmission bandwidth within the channel bandwidth for non CA configuration
and UL-MIMO unless otherwise stated. The period of measurement shall be at
least one sub frame (1ms)
Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) is a measure of the rate at which RF energy is
absorbed by human tissue. Since SAR varies proportionally with transmit power,
an increase in power as proposed with HPUE may raise SAR issues that would
need to be addressed. It is recommended that the note from clause 5.7.1 be
added to Table 6.2.2-1 as shown below.

### 6.2.2A UE maximum output power for CA
The UE Power Classes in this clause define the maximum output power for any
transmission bandwidth within the aggregated channel bandwidth for CA
configurations. The maximum output power is measured as the sum of the maximum
output power at each UE antenna connector. The period of measurement shall be
at least one sub frame (1 ms).
As stated in the Study Item objectives, and agreed by RAN4 with R4-162976,
requirements for B41 related CA configurations should be identified through
separate WIs after single carrier B41 PC2 work is complete.
Action: No change required to Maximum Output Power for CA requirements.
### 6.2.2B UE maximum output power for UL-MIMO
For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the maximum output power for any transmission bandwidth
within the channel bandwidth is specified in Table 6.2.2B-1. For UE supporting
UL-MIMO, the maximum output power is measured as the sum of the maximum output
power at each UE antenna connector. The period of measurement shall be at
least one sub frame (1ms).
It is proposed that the UE Power class for UL-MIMO be defined with the same
power level for UEs with a single transmit antenna, and with the same
tolerance as the existing Power Class 3 for UL-MIMO.
Table 6.2.2B-1: UE Power Class for UL-MIMO in closed loop spatial multiplexing
scheme

NOTE 2: ^2^ refers to the transmission bandwidths (Figure 5.6-1) confined
within F~UL_low~ and F~UL_low~ + 4 MHz or F~UL_high~ -- 4 MHz and F~UL_high~,
the maximum output power requirement is relaxed by reducing the lower
tolerance limit by 1.5 dB.
* * *
### 6.2.3 UE maximum output power for modulation / channel bandwidth
In this subclause, we propose for Power Class 2 the maximum output power for
modulation / channel bandwidth should follow the same methodology as the
existing power class for B41, noting this requirement is band agnostic in TS
36.101.
In this case we add Power Class 2 to the list of applicable Power Classes. The
side conditions would be the same.
For UE Power Class 1, 2, and 3, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for
the maximum output power in Table 6.2.2-1 due to higher order modulation and
transmit bandwidth configuration (resource blocks) is specified in Table
6.2.3-1.

### 6.2.3A UE maximum output power for modulation / channel bandwidth for CA
As stated in the Study Item objectives, and agreed by RAN4 with R4-162976,
requirements for B41 related CA configurations should be identified through
separate WIs after single carrier B41 PC2 work is complete.
Action: No change required to Maximum Output Power for modulation / channel
bandwidth for CA requirements.
### 6.2.3B UE maximum output power for modulation / channel bandwidth for UL-
MIMO
For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial
multiplexing scheme, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum
output power in Table 6.2.2B-1 is specified in Table 6.2.3-1. The requirements
shall be met with UL-MIMO configurations defined in Table 6.2.2B-2. For UE
supporting UL-MIMO, the maximum output power is measured as the sum of the
maximum output power at each UE antenna connector.
Action: No change required to the Maximum Output Power for Modulation /
Channel Bandwidth for UL-MIMO requirements.
### 6.2.3D UE maximum output power for modulation / channel bandwidth for
ProSe
It is proposed to add Power Class 2 to the list of applicable power classes,
with the same requirements as currently exist for Power Class 1 and 3.
For UE Power Class 1, 2, and 3, this subclause specifies the allowed Maximum
Power Reduction (MPR) power for ProSe physical channels and signals due to
higher order modulation and transmit bandwidth configuration (resource
blocks).
The allowed MPR for the maximum output power for ProSe physical channels
PSDCH, PSCCH, PSSCH, and PSBCH shall be as specified in subclause 6.2.3 for
PUSCH for the corresponding modulation and transmission bandwidth.
The allowed MPR for the maximum output power for ProSe physical signal PSSS
shall be as be as specified in subclause 6.2.3 for PUSCH QPSK modulation for
the corresponding transmission bandwidth.
The allowed MPR for the maximum output power for ProSe physical signal SSSS is
specified in Table 6.2.3D-1.

and 3

5.0 MHz ≤ [4] 10 MHz ≤ [4] 15 MHz ≤ [4] 20 MHz ≤ [4]
* * *
### 6.2.4 UE maximum output power with additional requirements
A-MPR is evaluated to meet NS_04 emission requirements for the high power
class 2 UE in Band 41.
In Band 41, A-MPR is allowed when the network signals NS_04 indicating that
the UE is required to meet more stringent emission requirements to comply with
regulatory limits for the particular deployment. For the existing class 3
NS_04 A-MPR, it can be seen [9] that for each channel bandwidth, there is a
cutoff frequency at the lower part of the band above which no A-MPR is
allowed. The cutoff frequency is 2499.5 MHz, 2504 MHz, 2510.8 MHz, and 2517.5
MHz for 5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz channels relative to the carrier center
frequency. The reason for this behavior is that A-MPR is only allowed for the
additional spurious emission requirement below the band given in Table
6.6.3.3.19-1 of TS 36.101. The NS_04 spectrum emission mask of Table
6.6.2.2.2-1 is expected to be met without A-MPR. The A-MPR for lower channels
below the cutoff frequency is first evaluated by measurements.

In addition to the measurements taken, numerical calculation of A-MPR for
discrete LO and IQ image folding products where they intersect the frequency
range below 2490.5 MHz (-25 dBm/MHz emission limit applies) reveals that A-MPR
of 5 dB is required of the HPUE.
Simulations were also conducted, results of which are shown below.

It can be seen in the measurements that all bandwidth, except for 5 MHz
highlighted in the table above, can retain the same cutoff frequency for class
2 HPUE as for class 3. However, for the 5 MHz, it is suggested to extend the
cutoff frequency by 1 MHz, from 2499.5 MHz to 2500.5 MHz to meet the close-in
emission requirement of -13 dBm/MHz without the need for A-MPR backoff.
Moreover, for the sake of consistency, it is proposed to extend the cutoff
frequency by 1 MHz for the class 3 A-MPR table as well. In an actual network
deployment where there are expected to be mixed class 2 and class 3 devices,
they will operate on the same channel so there is no benefit to having a
different cutoff frequency for HPUE class 2 vs. class 3.
Based on the measurements, simulations, and analysis provided in this
contribution as well as the simulation results provided in [10], the following
A-MPR tables are proposed. The class 3 table has been modified to extend the 5
MHz cutoff frequency by 1 MHz and a new class 2 A-MPR table is generated with
the same format as the class 3 table. Several of the entries in the class 2
table have larger A-MPR values as highlighted in the table for the HPUE to be
able to meet emission limits below the band.

### 6.2.4A UE maximum output power with additional requirements for CA
Additional ACLR, spectrum emission and spurious emission requirements for
carrier aggregation can be signalled by the network to indicate that the UE
shall also meet additional requirements in a specific deployment scenario. To
meet these additional requirements, Additional Maximum Power Reduction (A-MPR)
is allowed for the CA Power Class as specified in Table 6.2.2A-1.

shall be met with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B-2. For
UE supporting UL-MIMO, the maximum output power is measured as the sum of the
maximum output power at each UE antenna connector. Unless stated otherwise, an
A-MPR of 0 dB shall be used.
Action: No change required to Maximum Output Power with additional
requirements for UL-MIMO requirements.
### 6.2.4D UE maximum output power with additional requirements for ProSe
The allowed A-MPR for the maximum output power for ProSe physical channels
PSDCH, PSCCH, PSSCH, and PSBCH shall be as specified in subclause 6.2.4 for
PUSCH for the corresponding modulation and transmission bandwidth.
The allowed A-MPR for the maximum output power for ProSe physical signal PSSS
and SSSS shall be as be as specified in subclause 6.2.4 for PUSCH QPSK
modulation for the corresponding transmission bandwidth.
Action: No change required to Maximum Output Power with additional
requirements for ProSe requirements.
### 6.2.5 Configured transmitted power
The UE is allowed to set its configured maximum output power P~CMAX,_c_ ~ for
serving cell _c_. The configured maximum output power P~CMAX,_c_ ~ is set
within the bounds specified in this clause.
Action: No change required to Configured transmitted power requirements.
### 6.2.5A Configured transmitted power for CA
As stated in the Study Item objectives, and agreed by RAN4 with R4-162976,
requirements for B41 related CA configurations should be identified through
separate WIs after single carrier B41 PC2 work is complete.
Action: No change required to Configured transmitted power for CA
requirements.
### 6.2.5B Configured transmitted power for UL-MIMO
For UE supporting UL-MIMO, the transmitted power is configured per each UE.
The definitions of configured maximum output power P~CMAX,_c_ ~, the lower
bound P~CMAX_L,_c_ ~, and the higher bound P~CMAX_H,_c_ ~ specified in
subclause 6.2.5 shall apply to UE supporting UL-MIMO, where
\- P~PowerClass~ and ∆T~C,_c_ ~ are specified in subclause 6.2.2B;
\- MPR~,_c_ ~ is specified in subclause 6.2.3B;
\- A-MPR~,_c_ ~ is specified in subclause 6.2.4B.
Action: No change required to Configured transmitted power for UL-MIMO
requirements.
### 6.2.5C Configured transmitted power for Dual Connectivity
For the same reasons as for CA configurations, requirements for Dual
Connectivity configurations should be identified through separate WIs after
single carrier B41 PC2 work is complete.
Action: No change required to Configured transmitted power for Dual
Connectivity requirements.
### 6.2.5D Configured transmitted power for ProSe
The configured maximum output power P~CMAX,_c_ ~ and power boundary
requirement specified in subclause 6.2.5 shall apply to UE supporting ProSe,
where
\- MPR _~c~_ is specified in subclause 6.2.3D;
\- A-MPR _~c~_ is specified in subclause 6.2.4D;
\- ∆T~ProSe~ = 0.1 dB.
Action: No change required to Configured transmitted power for ProSe
requirements.

# 9 Conclusion
When High Power UE was first proposed as a work item at RAN Plenary #68
questions were raised concerning the implementation and technical
consideration of such a proposal. The present document documented in TR
36.886, was approved in order to delve deeper into the topic and to better
understand the technical and regulatory feasibility of such a feature.
Throughout the study period there has been little doubt that any technical and
regulatory challenges could be met. Each challenge has been met with useful
discussion and agreement to meet coexistence, technical and regulatory
concerns by a consensus of industry participants. This technical feasibility
of this feature has shown to be possible with current commercially available
components and that the RF characteristics are well defined to ensure that a
HPUE operating in Band 41 would do so in a manner consistent with proper
practices and specifications. The SID proposes some specific changes to 3GPP
specifications that would allow for an HPUE to be properly specified for the
industry. The commercial viability of such a HPUE is for each operator and
vendor to determine and is outside of the scope of the 3GPP in determining
feature viability. Within TR36.886 there contains enough information and
technical review to ensure that HPUE would indeed be technically feasible and
would meet global regulatory limits. There should be no hesitation in taking
the next step of creating a WID for HPUE.
