# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for 3DL/3UL Inter-band Carrier
Aggregation WI [3] under Rel-14 time frame. The document is divided in two
different parts:
\- General part: this part covers UE RF specific issues, which is band
combination independent.
\- CA configuration specific part: this part covers band combination specific
issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is defined per band
combination)
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.
# 5 General Part: Inter-Band (3DL/3UL) CA
## 5.1 UE reference architectures
In this clause we present some possible UE architectures which would enable
three band uplink CA. Architectures in Figures 5.1 ...5.5 are for CA
configurations that are combining bands with FDD-mode. To limit the amount of
Figures many types of CA configurations are not presented for example Figure
5.1 is for CA configuration having three high bands but no Figure is presented
for a case where there are three low bands as difference is merely placing the
hexaplexer to low band branch instead of high bands brach.
In Figures 5.1 and 5.2 UE has single antenna / common diplexer architecture
and can support CA confifurations where all bands are high bands or one is low
band and two are high bands.
Figure 5-1: Three high bands
Figure 5-2: One low band and two high bands
Figure 5.3 presents CA configuration having also one very high band. Such a
triplexer architecture was dicussed during CA work for 3.5 GHz bands but as
those were TDD bands very high band duplexfilter in Figure 5.3 would be
replaced with a bands pass filter in case very high bands would be TDD band.
Figure 5.3: One low, one high and one very high bands
Figures 5.4 and 5.5 present UE architectures where UE has two antennas. One
low/high band antenna and one very high badn antenna. This means that the very
high band is aggregated by means of antenna instead of triplexer.
Figure 5-4: two high bands and one very high band
Figure 5-5: one low band, one high bands and one very high band
## 5.2 Self-interference types
## 5.2.1 Intermodulation frequencies
Comparison of intermodulation frequencies between pure 2DL/2UL, 3DL/2UL, and
3DL/3UL Inter-band CA is shown in table 1. below. Please note that in case of
3DL/2UL we calculated the amount of possible intermodulation frequencies for
all three possible cases; one 2UL allocation (band A+ band B), two 2UL
allocations (Band A+ Band B, Band A+ Band C), and three 2UL allocations. (Band
A+ Band B, Band A+ Band C, Band B+ Band C). For each 3DL/2UL configuration,
only one 2UL configuration is active at a time.
When comparing 2DL/2UL with 3DL/3UL it can be seen that the number of
intermodulation frequencies, and thus the probability of intermodulation
hitting on top of own DL CC, is much higher in IMD4 and IMD5 with 3DL/3UL. In
case of IMD3 both pure 2UL and pure 3UL have four intermodulation frequencies.
Comparison between 3DL/2UL and 3DL/3UL is not so straightforward. There are
two things that need to be considered; the amount of intermodulation
frequencies related to each 3DL/2UL configuration and the total amount of
intermodulation frequencies for each 3DL/2UL combination.
The first one relates to the amount of intermodulation frequencies that may
cause desensitization in each 3DL/2UL configuration. In this respect, the
number of intermodulation frequencies, and thus the probability of
intermodulation hitting on top of own DL CC, is much higher in IMD4 and IMD5
with 3DL/3UL. In case of IMD3 both pure 2UL and pure 3UL have four
intermodulation frequencies.
The second one relates to the amount of intermodulation frequencies that need
to be analyzed for each 3DL/2UL combination. We note that actually 3DL/2UL has
more IMD3 and IMD4 frequencies than 3DL/3UL. In case of IMD5 both have 24
intermodulation frequencies.
The essential difference between 3DL/2UL and 3DL/3UL is that in 3DL/2UL the
intermodulation frequencies can be chosen by choosing desirable UL band
configurations for each use scenario, while in 3DL/3UL all the possible
intermodulation frequencies occur while all three UL's are active
concurrently.

Table 3 Intermodulation frequencies for pure 3DL/3UL Inter-band CA
We note that the amount of intermodulation frequencies is fairly high in pure
3DL/3UL inter-band CA, and thus the probability of intermodulation hitting on
top of own DL CC is increased compared with 2DL/2UL and 3DL/2UL.
