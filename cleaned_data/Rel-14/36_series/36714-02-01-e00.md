# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for 2DL/1UL Inter-band Carrier
Aggregation under Rel-14 time frame. It covers both the UE and BS side. The
document is divided in two different parts:
\- General part: this part covers BS and UE specific which is band combination
independent.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination and
its specific issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is
defined per band combination)
The specific band combination parts are independent and therefore, the working
speed also differs.
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.
# 5 Inter-Band (2DL) Carrier Aggregation with Single UL: General Part
As 2 DL inter-band combinations have been studied in R11, R12 and R13, the
identified general issues identified in R11 [3], R12 [4] and R13 [5] also
apply to R14. This TR only captured the new general issues if identified in
R14.

### 6.1.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.1.3-1 shows the UL harmonic analysis of band 8 and band 39. Since
corresponding UL harmonic interference products are away from the receive
bands of band 8 and band 39, it can be concluded that there is no issue on UL
harmonic interference.

Table 6.1.3-2 provides the harmonic and intermodulation products of DL BS
transmit band for Band 8 and Band 39 CA. As shown in Table table 6.1.3-2, the
harmonic products may fall into the UL receive frequencies of band 2, 25, 33,
35, 37, 39, and 46, and the intermodulation products may fall into UL
frequencies of Band 1, 2, 8, 25, 33, 35, 37, 39, 43, 46 or 65. It should be
noted that Bands 2, 25, 33, 35, 37, 43 and 65 are not intended for use in the
same geographical area as Band 8 and 39. Furthermore, Band 46 is unlicensed
band restricted as DL operation. Consequently, the IMD products may only have
impact on BS receiver of Band1, 8 and 39. Considering TDD BS does not transmit
and receive simultaneously, so the BS's own band 39 receiver and other
synchronized band 39 receivers would not be interfered.
Therefore, It is recommended that Bands 8 and 39 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 1 , 8 and unsynchronized 39 BS receivers
unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification, so
that the PIM will not cause these band's BS receivers desensitization.

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [6] when
operating in single carrier mode.
### 6.2.3 Co-existence studies
The 2^nd^ harmonic of Band 28 may fall into the Rx of Band 21 as observed in
table 6.2.3-1. However, taking into account that Band 21 is only operated by a
certain operator so far, the Band 28 transmission for this combination is
limited within 728 - 738 MHz based on the actual spectrum allocation. In this
case, the 2^nd^ harmonic range becomes 1456 \-- 1476 MHz and the degradation
of Band 21 will be resolved. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no issue
on harmonic interference.

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.2.3-2 that some 2nd IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 21 and Band 28 fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 12, 17, 28, 30, 40 and 44, while some 3rd IMD products fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 13, 14, 18, 26, 27, 28, 43 and 44 taking that the
BS only transmits up to 15 MHz DL in Band 21 and up to 10 MHz DL in Band 28 as
stated in Table 6.2.2-1 into account.
It should be noted that Bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 27, 30, 40, 44 are not intended
for use in the same geographical area as Band 21. Consequently, the focus is
on the IMD products falling into Bands 18, 26, 28 and 43 where receiver
desensitization might be an issue.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 21 and 28 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 18, 26, 28 and 43 BS receivers, unless the
antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM
will not cause Band 18, 26, 28 and 43 BS receivers desensitization.

in this combination taking actual spectrum allocation into account and the MSD

Table 6.3.3-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band 1
or Band 38 for UL. It can be seen that the UL harmonic frequencies of Band 1
and Band 38 do not fall into the UE receive bands of interest in the DL.

It can be seen from table 6.3.3-2 that:
\- the 2^nd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Band 31.
\- the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 7,
9, 10, 24, 38, 41 and 66.
assuming (except the last row) the whole 60 MHz DL frequency of Band 1 and the
whole 50 MHz DL frequency of Band 38.
If the BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 20 MHz DL in Band 1 and 20MHz
DL in Band 38 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will still
fall into same BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 24, 38, 41 and 66.
In terms of fall down to BS own receiver band, a TDD BS does not transmit and
receive simultaneously in a single band, so the BS's own band 38 receiver and
other synchronized band 38 receivers will not be interfered.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 4, 10, 24 and 66 are not intended
for use in the same geographical area (country) as Bands 1 and 38\. This
leaves Bands 3, 7, 9, 31 and 41. to consider for IMD products.
It is recommended that Bands 1 and 38 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 3, 7, 9, 31 and 41 BS receivers so that the antenna
PIM will not cause Bands 3, 7, 9, 31 and 41 BS receiver desensitization.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 5 and Band 66 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.4.2-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting
in Band 5 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9, 10 and 66, and
the 3^rd^ harmonics may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 38 and 41,
while the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6,
8, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 31, 42, 44 and 46. Note that the
calculation in Table 6.4.2-1 (except the last row) assumes the BS is
transmitting with the whole 25 MHz DL frequency of Band 5 and the whole 90 MHz
DL frequency of Band 66. If the BS is only transmitting up to 10 MHz DL in
Band 5 and up to 20 MHz DL in Band 66 as stated in the WIDS, then the 3^rd^
IMD products will not fall into the BS receive band of Band 5, 6, 13, 14, 18,
19, 26, 27 or 44 as shown in the last row in Table 6.4.2-1.
Note that Bands 3, 8, 9, 20, 22 and 38 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 5 and 66. Therefore, the focus here is on the
harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 4, 10, 31, 41, 42, 46 and 66.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 4,
10, 31, 41, 42, 46 or 66 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor
eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 5
and 66 BS transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 4, 10, 31, 41,
42, 46 or 66 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 5 and 66 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 4, 10, 31, 41, 42, 46 or 66 BS receiver, in
order to prevent BS receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets
very stringent 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will
not cause Band 4, 10, 31, 41, 42, 46 or 66 BS receiver desensitization. Note
that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to
evolve in the future.
### 6.4.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
CA_5A-66A is formed by diplexing a carrier in Band 5 with a carrier in Band
66. The diplexer relaxations ∆T~IB~ = 0.3 dB, ∆R~IB~ = 0 dB apply with no MSD
or reference sensitivity exceptions.

### 6.5.3 Co-existence studies
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 12 and Band 66 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
Table 6.5.3-1 below:

It can be seen from Table 6.5.3-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting
in Band 12 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 21 and 45, while the
2^nd^ IMD products supporting CA of Band 12 and Band 66 may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 11, 21 and 45, and the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28,
42, 43, 44 and 68. Note that the calculation in Table 6.5.3-1 (except the last
row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 17 MHz DL frequency of Band
12 and the whole 90 MHz DL frequency of Band 66. If the BS is only
transmitting up to 10 MHz DL in Band 12 and up to 20 MHz DL in Band 66 as
stated in the WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS
receive band of Band 5, 6, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26 or 27 as shown in the last
row in Table 6.5.3-1.
Note that the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS own receive blocks of
Band 12. Assume that the 2 component carriers (CC) transmitted by the Bands 12
and 66 BS are _a_ and _b_ MHz channel bandwidth and _c_ and _d_ MHz from the
edges of Bands 12 and 66 DL frequency bands as shown in Figure 6.5.3-1 below:
Figure 6.5.3-1: CC transmitted by the Bands 12 and 66 BS
And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 6.5.3-2 below:
Figure 6.5.3-2: CC received by the Bands 12 and 66 BS
Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 2 CC
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.5.3-2 below:
Table 6.5.3-2: Bands 12 and 66 BS DL 3^rd^ order IMD products

\+ _a_
* * *
Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 6.5.3-2 with the BS receive blocks
in Figure 6.5.3-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused
in the BS by transmitting of the 2 CC will only fall into the BS own receive
blocks of Band 12 under one of the transmit configurations shown in Table
6.5.3-3 below:

The filter combiner data additional ILs for filter vendor B and C in the above
table is not given over ETC and are too high for this CA combo. State-of-the-
art filter technology is needed in order to combine B20 and B28A (lower
duplex). The average additional IL for filter vendor A and D with respect to
the reference single duplexer is given in the table below. For the B20 Tx
reference duplexer the better value of 2 dB additional IL has been taken in
order to calculate the average additional IL.

Looking at the low-low band CA framework which was agreed in: R4-146833 and
the background information in R4-145843 we find that CA_2DL_20A-28A_1UL_BCS0
can follow the framework.
For two simultaneous DL and one UL the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ values are shown in
Table 6.9.4-3, and in Table.6.9.4-4:

NOTE: To meet the ∆R~IB,c~ requirements for CA_20A-28A state-of-the-art filter
combiner technology is needed.
### 6.9.5 REFSENS requirements
No change in B20 or B28 REFSENS requirements are needed as the 1UL does not
cause harmonic distortion to the own receiving bands. The ΔR~IB,c~ is given in
the table above.
### 6.9.6 Blocking requirements
The inband blocking for CA and OOB blocking for single carrier and CA needs
the following changes for CA_20A-28A in TS 36.101 (changes are highlighted in
yellow)
Changes in TS 36.101 Section 7.6.1.1A for in-band blocking and minimum
requirements for CA:
For inter-band carrier aggregation with one component carrier per operating
band and the uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the in-band blocking
requirements are defined with the uplink active on the band(s) other than the
band whose downlink is being tested. For adjacent downlink bands separated by
less than 30 MHz the frequency separation between the center frequencies of
adjacent component carriers belonging to different bands shall be ≥ BW~1~/2 +
BW~2~/2 + 2F~Ioffset,case\ j~ for Case _j_ interferers, _j_ = 1,2, where BW
_~k~_ /2 are the channel bandwidths of carrier _k_ , _k_ = 1,2. The UE shall
meet the requirements specified in subclause 7.6.1.1 for each component
carrier while all downlink carriers are active. For the UE which supports
inter band CA configuration in Table 7.3.1-1A, P~Interferer~ power defined in
Table 7.6.1.1-2 is increased by the amount given by ΔR~IB,c~ in Table
7.3.1-1A. For E-UTRA CA configurations including an operating band without
uplink operation or an operating band with an unpaired DL part (as noted in
Table 5.5-1), the requirements for all downlinks shall be met with the single
uplink carrier active in each band capable of UL operation. The requirements
for the component carrier configured in the operating band without uplink
operation are specified in Table 7.6.1.1A-0, Table 7.6.1.1A-0a and Table

From the above, the need for MSD needs to be studied further.
Worst case isolation data was obtained a filter vendor for a pentaplexer
(B1+B3+B32) revealing that the worst case estimate for cross-band Rx isolation
in Band 32 from transmission in Band 3 is only 45 dB. Tx isolation is 55 dB.
The worst case isolation estimates are provided below
Table 6.12.5-1. Worst case isolation estimates
* * *
                    Tx band isolation   Rx band isolation
B3 Tx -- B3 Rx 51 50 B1 Tx -- B1 Rx 51 49 B3 Tx -- B32 Rx 55 45 B1 Tx -- B32
Rx 52 45 B3 Tx -- B1 Rx 54 50 B1 Tx -- B3 Rx 50 50
* * *
The following additional parameters are assumed in the derivation of MSD in
Band 32
Band 32 Rx front-loss: 5.5 dB
PA noise in Rx band: -127.5 dBm/Hz
IP2 of Rx in B3: 48 dBm
Tx and Rx phase noise: -156 dBc/Hz
Primary-diversity antenna isolation: 10 dB
For a reference sensitivity in Band 32 equivalent to that of Band 1; that is
-100 dBm for 5 MHz, -97 dBm for 10 MHz, etc., the MSD is shown below.
Table 6.12.5-2. MSD in Band 32

* * *
In other words, the MSD related to the pentaplexer is estimated to be mostly 1
dB for 10, 15, and 20 MHz and 1.5 dB for only 5 MHz. _However, as a compromise
with other data presented and proposals presented by other companies, a value
of 0.5 dB MSD is reflected in the reference sensitivity shown below._

### 6.13.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.13.3-1 gives the harmonic frequency limits for Band 7 and Band 32 2DL
CA. As shown in the table, 2^nd^ order harmonics and 3^rd^ harmonics may fall
into none of the BS receiver band of 3GPP bands.

* * *
Table 6.13.3-2 gives the intermodulation products supporting 2 DL CA of Band 7
and Band 32. In addition, the maximum transmission bandwidth of 40MHz (20MHz
in Band 7 and 20MHz in Band 32) is considered for the IMD analysis.

* * *
It can be seen from the table 6.13.3-2 that the 2nd order IMD products caused
by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 7 and Band 32 fall into none of
BS receive Band of 3GPP bands. The 3rd order IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 7 and Band 32 may fall into BS receive
Band of Bands 11 , 21 , 38 , 41 , 43 and 45.
It should be noted that, at the time of writing, Bands 11, 21, 41, and 45 are
not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 7 and 32\.
Consequently, the focus here will be on the IMD products falling into Bands 38
and 43.
It is recommended that Bands 7 and 32 BS transmitters should not share the
same antenna with Bands 38 and 43 BS receivers unless the antenna path meets
very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause
these Band's BS receivers desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be
allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
Table 6.13.3-3 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band 7
+ Band 32 CA with 1 UL.
Table 6.13.3-3: Impact of 1 UL Harmonic Interference

to 5140  
3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) N/A 7500 to 7710
* * *
It can be seen that no harmful fall down toward DL bands of interest is
observed in UE side
### 6.13.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
Filter vendors have been consulted on which are possible implementations of CA
7+32, and following possibilities have been indicated:
1\. one possibility is to use a Pentaplexer covering 3+7+32, cascaded with
diplexer LB/HB on top;
2\. another possibility is to use cascaded Pentaplexer 1+3+32 and Band 7
duplexer, both triplexed LB/MB/HB together.
It is worth to note that second option would be more flexible, in order to let
UE to support also CA configurations including band 1.
[Option 1:]{.underline}
In table below, Delta IL is the additional Insertion Loss needed by new
component w.r.t. legacy UE aggregating 3+32. Cross-isolation addresses the TX-
RX isolation of different bands (e.g. B3 TX vs B7 RX, B7 TX vs B3 TX, etc.).
Table 6.13.4-1: Option 1 data
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | | Vendor A | +-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | Implementation choice | Pentaplexer 3+7+32 with cascaded diplexer LB/HB | +-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | Delta IL | B32: 0.5dB (Rx) | | | | | | B3: 0.4 dB (Tx), 0.5 dB (Rx) | | | | | | B7: 0.8 dB (Tx), 0.2 dB (Rx) | +-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | Isolation | >55dB for all cases (sufficient) | +-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
[Option 2:]{.underline}
Hereafter we consider the triplexer approach for LB/MB/HB on top of
pentaplexer 1+3+32, according to architecture presented below.
{width="4.5in" height="6.489583333333333in"}
Figure 6.13.4-1: Proposed architecture for option 2
In following table, data received from one filter vendor are reported. In this
case it can be assumed that legacy UE already supports CA configuration 3+7
and 1+3, thus "Delta IL" are evaluated as difference between legacy case and
new configuration described in Figure 1 above. In the evaluation of DeltaT~IB~
and DeltaR~IB~ for new configurations 7+32 and 3+7+32, legacy values from spec
for CA 3+7 and CA 3+32 have to be considered as well.
Table 6.13.4-2: Option 2 data
+-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | | Vendor B | +-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | Implementation choice | Pentaplexer 1+3+32 with cascaded Triplexer | | | LB/MB/HB | +-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | Delta IL | B32: 0.8 dB (Rx) | | | | | | B3: 0.4 dB (Tx), 0.5 dB (Rx) | | | | | | B7: 0.2 dB (Tx), 0.2 dB (Rx) | +-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | Isolation | >50dB for all cases, considering cascaded | | | Pentaplexer and Triplexer together | | | | | | (sufficient) | +-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
In the past, CA configurations with bands in similar frequency ranges have
been addressed, e.g. CA 1+11 and CA 1+21. In both cases 0.3 dB for ΔTx and 0
dB for ΔRx have been defined.
In addition, in case of CA 3+32 a value of 0.5 dB for ΔTx and 0 dB for ΔRx
have been defined. In case of CA 1+3 a value of 0.3 dB for ΔTx and 0 dB for
ΔRx have been defined, including a potential desens of B3 when the distance
between B1 TX chunk and B3 RX chunk is lower than 60 MHz.
Looking at two options above and related available data it is noted that there
is not a significant difference in terms of Insertion Loss between Option 1
and Option 2, a part Band 7 TX.
Since 3GPP specifies requirements without mandating or underlying any specific
architecture, in the followings a tentative proposal to cover both options
above is done, aiming to let freedom in the implementation of CA
configurations supporting B32 and to not preclude any implementation and at
the same time to not assume one implementation in the specification
definition. In the table below "shared pain" approach has been also
considered, while evaluating final proposals. In the proposal elaboration for
∆T~IB~, ∆R~IB~, legacy values for CA 3+7 and 3+32 are also considered.

### 6.13.5 REFSENS and MSD

kept. According to discussion above ∆R~IB~ values are proposed to be 0 dB.

It can be seen from Table 6.15.3-1 that the 2nd harmonics of BS transmitting
in Band 3 may fall into the BS receive band of Band 43. It can be seen from
table 6.15.3-2 that some 3rd IMD products caused by BS supporting carrier
aggregation of Band 3 and Band 21 fall into the BS receive band of Bands 2,
25, 35 and 39 taking that the BS only transmits up to 20 MHz DL in Band 3 and
up to 15 MHz DL in Band 21 as stated in Table 6.15.2-1 into account.
It should be noted that Bands 2, 25, 35 and 39 are not intended for use in the
same geographical area as Band 21. Therefore, it is concluded that there is
also no issue on intermodulation interference for CA_3A-21A.
### 6.15.4 ΔT~IB~ and ΔR~IB~ values
For two simultaneous DL and only one UL, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ values are
given in the tables below.

### 6.15.5 REFSENS requirements
∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values shown in Table 6.15. 4-1 and 6.15.4-2 were
derived from common triplexer characteristics in Table 6.15.5-1.

Note: isolation of 15dB between each port at ETC is guaranteed.
In addition, each duplexer data is shown in Table 6.15.5-2.

From these tables, cross-isolation between B3 Tx and B21 Rx is 51.7 dB for Tx
and 54.3 dB for Rx respectively. These values are sufficient to avoid the MSD
for B21 Rx. Therefore, it is concluded that no MSD requirement is specified
for 2DL/1UL CA_3A-21A.

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.16.3-2 that:
\- the 2nd harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 8 and 28 may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 2, 25, 33, 35, 37 and 39,
\- the 3rd harmonics may fall into Band 30 and 40
\- the 2nd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9,10
and 66
\- the 3rd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 7, 8,
13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 38, 41 44 and 68
assuming (except the last row) the whole 35MHz DL frequency of Band 8 and the
whole 45 MHz DL frequency of Band 28.
If the BS is only transmitting up to 10 MHz DL in Band 8 and 20MHz DL in Band
28 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS
receive band of Band 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 26,28 and 68 as shown in the last row
in table 2.
In terms of fall down to own BS receive band, special care must be taken for
the case that one of three tone IMDs falls to Band 8 UL region. In addition,
another three tone IMD may fall down next to Band 28 UL region, though not
directly. Checking Band 8 fall down, affected BS receive portion is the upmost
10MHz (905- 915MHz) while BS transmit portion to generate the relevant IMD3 is
the lowest 10MHz (925- 935MHz), assuming Band 28 bandwidth as 20MHz. So this
only happens when a BS operates the lowest and the highest 10MHz of Band 8
simultaneously. Similar analysis can be made for proximate fall down of Band
28 and it can be concluded that risk, if any, is limited to the case when a BS
operates the lowest and the highest Band 28 at the same time.
It should be noted that Bands 2, 4, 10, 13, 14, 25, 30 and 66 are not intended
for use in the same geographical area as Bands 8 and 28. In addition, co-
existence between Band 28 and Band 44 is unlikely as Band 44 is TDD variant of
APAC-700 spectrum then it could be expected that the deployment of Band 28 and
44 is mutually exclusive. Therefore, the focus here will be on the harmonics
and IMD falling into Bands 3, 7, 9, 27, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 3, 7, 9, 27, 33,
35, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41 receiver would be well below the receiver noise
floor eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that
Bands 8 and 28 BS transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 3, 7,
9, 27, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41 BS receiver.
### 6.16.4 ΔT~IB~ and ΔR~IB~ values
Since this combination needs a quadplexer and difficulties are expected on the
performance of the quadplexer, evaluation of filter performance is conducted
and results from three vendors are obtained. It is assumed to use two
quadplexers corresponding to upper/lower portions of B28 and all the vendors
assume to use TC(Temperature Compensated)-SAW technology in Band 8 filter. The
additional insertion losses and their average values are summarized in the
table below.
Table 6.16.4-1: Additional IL values for Band 8 + 28 quadplexers (under ETC)
+------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | **E-UTRA bands** | **Vendor A\ |** Vendor B\ | **Vendor C\ |** Average**| | | IL (dB)** | IL (dB)**| IL (dB)** | | | | | | | **IL (dB)** | +------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | 8 Tx | 1.2 | 0.9 | 0.7 | **0.93** | +------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | 8 Rx | 1.4 | 0.9 | 0.6 | **0.97** | +------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | 28A Tx | 0.4 | 0.6 | 0.6 | **0.53** | +------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | 28A Rx | 0.9 | 1.0 | 0.5 | **0.8** | +------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | 28B Tx | 0.6 | 1.0 | 0.6 | **0.73** | +------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ | 28B Rx | 0.7 | 1.0 | 0.4 | **0.7** | +------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
In addition, Band 28 assumes twin duplexers which cover lower and upper 30MHz.
This implies that two quadplexers are needed to support the whole B28, i.e.
B8+B28A and B8+B28B (note that postscript A, B here do not imply CA class) and
this requires a switch in front of Band 8 Tx and Rx to select two quadplexers.
However, due to recent trend of sharing PA or LNA among different bands to
reduce footprint or a number of parts, such switches are typically implemented
regardless of CA support and it is likely to reuse the switches to select the
relevant quadplexers. Thus, the insertion loss for the switches can be
eliminated from ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ calculation.
Since B28 performance is defined as a unified form, Tx IL of 0.73dB and Rx IL
of 0.8dB are used for the calculation and the formulas below are used to
obtain ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ aiming at in the middle of past practices.
∆T~IB~ = (Average Tx)/2 + 0.1
∆R~IB~ = (Average Rx -- 0.6)/2

given in the tables below.**

### 6.16.5 REFSENS requirements
\
### 6.16.6 Blocking requirements
\
### 6.16.7 Antenna related issues and Pcell limitation
During the course of discussion, it was pointed out that antenna performance
of low-band could be a problem for this CA. In short, a current low-band
(700MHz - 1GHz) antenna in general is impossible to cover the whole band and
an antenna tuner is employed for single band operation to obtain rational
performance for each band. However in CA, simultaneous reception of two bands
is required so this technique does not always work properly. The situation
becomes harsh for this CA since this CA combines the lowest and the highest
ones of low-band.\ While it is largely up to antenna implementation and out of
scope of 3GPP standard at the time of writing, this issue was discussed
extensively. As a result, two possible implementations should be assumed in UE
side as (1) tune to Pcell and compromise Scell performance or (2) tune in the
middle of Pcell and Scell to seek for balanced degradation. As preliminary
values, the loss of antenna gain is expected in 4-7dB for Scell (in case of B8
Pcell) in (1) and 3-4dB for both bands in (2).
To make both happen, it was concluded that Pcell be limited to Band 8 at least
for the time being since in (1) B28 in Pcell could not expect good performance
due to form-factor limitation while (2) is relatively insensitive to which
band to be Pcell. An eNodeB is then requested to consider both
implementations.
Since this decision largely depends on current antenna implementation, this
would be revisited when the situation is changed.

It can be seen from Table 6.17.3-2 that:
\- the 2nd harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 11 and 41 may fall into the
BS receive band of Band 46,
\- the 3rd harmonics may fall into none of BS receive band of 3GPP

addition, at the time of writing, B46 is not assumed to support UL
transmission.
It should be noted that, at the time of writing, Bands 7, 31, 38 and 43 are
not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 11 and 41\. In
addition, TDD BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously in a single
band, the BS's own Band 41 receiver and other synchronized Band 41 receivers
would not be interfered. Therefore, the focus here will be on the harmonics
and IMD falling into Bands 21 and 42.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 21 or 42 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 11 and 41 BS transmitters do not
share the same antenna with Band 21 or 42 BS receiver.
### 6.17.4 ΔT~IB~ and ΔR~IB~ values
FDD-TDD CA needs filter study and we got feedbacks from filter vendors on RF
filter configuration and performance for B11+B41 CA. Their responses are:
(1) diplexer + duplexer approach (not quadplexer) is likely due to large
separation between two bands of interest,
(2) harmful performance of Band 41 filter does not reach Band 11 region and,
(3) additional ILs for the diplexer (under ETC/Worst) are as below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.18.3-2 that:
\- the 2nd harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 11 and 42 may fall into none
of the BS receive band of 3GPP,
\- the 3rd harmonics may fall into none of BS receive band of 3GPP,
\- the 2nd IMD products may fall into BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 23, 25,
33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39 and 65,
\- the 3rd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 11, 21, 22,
24, 31, 42, 43, 45 and 46,
assuming (except the last row) the whole 20MHz DL frequency of Band 11 and the
whole 200 MHz DL frequency of Band 42.
If the BS is only transmitting up to 10 MHz DL in Band 11 and 20MHz DL in Band
42 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS
receive band of Band 11 and 24 as shown in the last row in table 4. In
addition, at the time of writing, B46 is not assumed to support UL
transmission.
It should be noted that, at the time of writing, Bands 2, 22, 23, 25, 31, 33,
35, 36, 37, 39, 43, 45 and 65 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 11 and 42. In addition, TDD BS does not transmit
and receive simultaneously in a single band, the BS's own Band 42 receiver and
other synchronized Band 42 receivers would not be interfered. Therefore, the
focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 1, 21 and 34.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 1, 21 or 34
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 11 and 42 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 1, 21 or 34 BS receiver.
### 6.18.4 ΔT~IB~ and ΔR~IB~ values
Concerning CA of a mid-band and a very high-band, assuming "extended Low-High"
common diplexer which covers 1.5GHz as a part of high band range, the RF
configuration is identical to H-VH architecture. Thus default values can be
used for VH portion while the extended Low-High diplexer requires 0.1dB
additional relaxation to ∆T~IB~ in Band 11.
For two simultaneous DL and only one UL, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ values are
given in the tables below.

It can be seen from table 6.19.3-2 that:
\- the 2^nd^ harmonics products may fall into the BS receive band of Band 43.
\- the 2^nd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 22, 42
and 43.
\- the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3,
4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 65 and
66.
assuming (except the last row) the whole 75 MHz DL frequency of Band 3 and the
whole 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 46.
If the BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 20 MHz DL in Band 3 and 20MHz
DL in Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will still
fall into same BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25
30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 65 and 66.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33, 34,
35, 36 and 37 are not intended for use in the same geographical area (country)
as Bands 3 and 46. This leaves Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 22, 39, 40, 42, 43, 65 and
66 to consider for IMD products.
It is recommended that Bands 3 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 22, 39, 40, 42, 43, 65 and 66 BS
receivers so that the antenna PIM will not cause Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 22, 39,
40, 42, 43, 65 and 66 BS receiver desensitization.
### 6.19.4 ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB,c values
For the UE which supports CA_3A-46A the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.19.4-1 and 6.19.4-2 respectively assuming separate

within the uplink transmission bandwidth of the lower band for which the
transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission bandwidth of the
higher band and a range ∆F~HD~ above and below the edge of this downlink

combination for UE.

The 2nd and 3rd order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 7 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.20.3-2 below:

(f2_high + f1_BWmax) IMD frequency limits (MHz) 2600 2710 5130 5945
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.20.3-2 that:
\- the 2^nd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 7, 38 and
41.
\- the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 7,
22, 23, 25, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 65.
assuming (except the last row) the whole 70 MHz DL frequency of Band 7 and the
whole 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 46.
If the BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 20 MHz DL in Band 3 and 20MHz
DL in Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will still
fall into same BS receive band of Bands 31, 38 and 41.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 7, 31, 38 and 41 are possible
intended for use in the same geographical area (country) as Bands 7 and 46\.
Therefore the Bands 7, 31, 38 and 41 shall be considered for IMD products.
It is recommended that Bands 7 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 7, 31, 38 and 41 BS receivers so that the antenna
PIM will not cause Bands 7, 31, 38 and 41 BS receiver desensitization.

### 6.21.3 Co-existence studies for CA_11-46
The harmonic frequencies are observed in table 6.21.3-1. Therefore we can
conclude that there is an issue on 5^th^ harmonic interference from Band 11 UL
to Band 46 DL. It was agreed not to apply HTF for this CA combination. How to
treat MSD requirements is FFS.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 11 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.21.3-2 below:
Table 6.21.3-2 Band 11 and Band 46 DL harmonics and IMD products

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.21.3-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 11 and Band 46 fall into the BS receive
band of Band 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS receive band
of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45, 65, 66
and 68. Note that the calculation in table 6.4.21.1.2-2 (except the last row)
assumes the BS transmits the whole 20 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 3 and
Band 46 respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 10MHz and 20 MHz DL in Band 11 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.21.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 7, 21, 30, 38, 40, 41 and 45 as
shown in the last row in table 6.21.3-2.
Considering spectrum allocation in each ITU region, Band 11 has been operated
only in Japan so far. Hence, coexistence with Band 7, 30, 38, 40, 43 and 45
could be out of scope.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 11 and 46 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order
PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the BS receiver
desensitisations in Band 21 and 41.
### 6.21.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports CA_11A-46A the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.21.4-1 and 6.21.4-2 respectively.

### 6.21.5 REFSENS requirements
As observed in 6.21.3, 4th harmonic of Band 11 UL falls into Band 46. In this
case, the frequency gap to avoid MSD in Band 46 and the UL configuration are
specified as shown in table 6.21.5-1 and 6.21.5-2.

### 6.22.3 Co-existence studies

It can be seen from Table 6.22.3-2 that:
\- the 2nd harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 11 and 28 may fall into none
of the BS receive band of 3GPP
\- the 3rd harmonics may fall into BS receive band of Bands 30 and 40
\- the 2nd IMD products may fall into BS receive band of Bands 12, 17, 28, 44
and 68
\- the 3rd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 11, 13, 14,
18, 21, 26, 27, 28, 43, 44 and 45,
assuming (except the last row) the whole 20MHz DL frequency of Band 11 and the
whole 45 MHz DL frequency of Band 28.
If the BS is only transmitting up to 10 MHz DL in Band 11 and 20MHz DL in Band
28 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS
receive band of Band 11, 18, 26 and 28 as shown in the last row in table 4.
(Note that even so, Band 28 is still subject to 2^nd^ IMD fall down.)
It should be noted that Bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 27, 30, 40, 43 and 45 are not
intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 11 and 28. In
addition, co-existence between Band 28 and Band 44 is unlikely as Band 44 is
TDD variant of APAC-700 spectrum then it could be expected that the deployment
of Band 28 and 44 is mutually exclusive. Therefore, the focus here will be on
the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 21 and 28.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 21 or 28 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 11 and 28 BS transmitters do not
share the same antenna with Band 21 or 28 BS receiver.
### 6.22.4 ΔT~IB~ and ΔR~IB~ values
Concerning CA of a mid-band and a low-band, default values of ∆T~IB~=0.3dB and
∆R~IB~=0dB were agreed as a framework but conventionally for CA including B11
and B21, ∆T~IB~=0.4dB has been proposed/accepted for mid-band to accommodate
"extended Low-High" diplexer. In addition, a harmonic trap filter (HTF) is
assumed in Band 28 path that introduces additional relaxation of 0.3dB for Tx
and 0.2dB for Rx.
For two simultaneous DL and only one UL, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ values are
given in the tables below.

As pointed out in section 3, there is a harmonic relation for the 2^nd^
harmonic of Band 28 Tx falling down to Band 11 Rx. Thus, we need to evaluate
MSD in Band 11 when Band 28 is used as Pcell.
### 6.22.5 REFSENS requirements
As noted above, the 2^nd^ harmonic of B28 Tx will fall into B11 Rx. The
following table is REFSENS exception when harmonic fall down occurs.

The availability of CA_11A-28A is, at the time of writing, limited to two
operators in Japan. Based on their spectrum holding, one operator will be
suffered by direct fall down of the 2^nd^ harmonic of B28 Tx while the other
will have around 30MHz separation as minimum between its own Band 11 Rx and
possible 2^nd^ harmonic of Band 28 Tx. Taking this situation into account,
REFSENS relaxation near the harmonic fall down is not necessary to be defined
and tested so ∆F~HD~ is set to 0MHz. Furthermore, additional relaxation (such
as defined for CA_3A-42A) is not required also.

### 6.23.3 Co-existence studies
The harmonic frequencies are observed in table 6.23.3-1. Therefore we can
conclude that there is an issue on 3^rd^ harmonic interference from Band 66 UL
to Band 46 DL. MSD value without HTF is provided in 6.23.5.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 66 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.23.3-2 below:
Table 6.23.3-2 Band 66 and Band 46 DL harmonics and IMD products

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.23.3-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 66 and Band 46 fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 22, 42 and 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20,
21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45,, 65
and 66. Note that the calculation in table 6.23.3-2 (except the last row)
assumes the BS transmits the whole 90 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 66 and
Band 46 respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 20MHz and 20 MHz DL in Band 66 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.23.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20,
21, 24, 26, 27, 44, 45 as shown in the last row in table 6.23.3-2.
The following Bands 6, 8, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 44 and 45 are not used in the
same region, therefore, it is recommended that Bands 66 and 46 BS transmitters
should not share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets very
stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the BS
receiver desensitisations in Band 5, 13, 14, 24, 26, and 27.

NOTE 1: The requirements do not apply when there is at least one individual RE
within the uplink transmission bandwidth of the lower band for which the
transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission bandwidth of the
higher band and a range ∆F~HD~ above and below the edge of this downlink
transmission bandwidth. The value ∆F~HD~ depends on the E-UTRA configuration:
∆F~HD~ = **[15] MHz** **for CA_xA-46A (x=1, 2, 3, and 4) and for CA_46A-66A

It can be seen from table 6.24.3.1-1 that:
\- some 2^nd^ order harmonics may fall into the BS receive band of Band 3, 4,
9, 10 and 66.
\- some 3^rd^ order harmonics may fall into the BS receive band of Band 38 and
41.
\- some two-tone 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of
Band 22, 42 and 43.
\- some three-tone 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS receive band
of Band 8, 20 where the BS only transmits up to 10MHz and 20MHz DL in Band5
and Band46 respectively,
It is recommended that Band 5 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with Band 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 20, 22, 38, 41, 42, 43 and 66 BS receivers
unless the antenna path meets very stringent third order PIM specification so
that the antenna PIM will not cause Band 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 20, 22, 38, 41, 42,
43 and 66 BS receiver desensitization.
#### 6.24.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.24.3.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
5 or Band 46 for UE. For 7^th^ harmonics, MSD analysis is provided in 6.24.5.

operating in single carrier mode.
### 6.25.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.25.3-1 gives the harmonics and IMD products for band 1 + band 3 CA
with 2DLs. It shows that the second harmonics may fall into BS receive band of
Band 43, and no third harmonics will fall into any BS receive band specified
by 3GPP. In addition, no second order intermodulation products will fall into
any BS receive band. The third order intermodulation products may fall into
the BS receive band of Band 2, 7, 11, 21, 24, 25, 35, 39, 40 and 41.
Note that Band 2, 25 and 35 are not intended for use in the same geographical
area as Band 1 and Band 3. It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of
Band 1 and Band 3 should not share the same antenna with Band 7, 11, 21, 24,
39, 40, 41 and 43 BS receiver, unless the antenna path meets very stringent
third order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 7, 11, 21,
24, 39, 40, 41 and 43 BS receiver desensitization. Specific analysis on the
harmonics and IMD products with consideration on the adopted bandwidth and the
carrier places are needed if considering the shared antenna.

Table 6.40.3-2 gives the harmonic products for band 5+ band 41 CA with 1UL. As
shown in below table the 3rd order harmonic products of Band 5 UL may fall
into the passband of B41 DL for UE. However, whether the harmonic interference
issue exist or not still depends on the actual spectrum allocation.

In addition, this CA combination has harmonic mixing issue that the B41 UL
carrier can align with 3rd order harmonic of B5 DL carrier for UE, as shown in
Table 6.40.3-3.

* * *
According to the RAN4 agreement for similar discussion of CA_26A-41A, it is
suggested that the network should avoid simultaneous Tx/Rx operation when the
B41 UL and B5 DL 3^rd^ harmonic alignment condition occurs for CA_5A-41A as
well.
### 6.40.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For two simultaneous DLs and one UL the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are shown

### 6.40.5 REFSENS requirements
Based on the co-existence study in section 6.40.3, there is no harmonic issue
in this combination taking actual spectrum allocation into account and the MSD
requirement is shown in table 6.40.5-1. And following CA_26A-41A agreement,
network should avoid simultaneous Tx/Rx operation for CA_5A-41A when the Band
41 UL and 3rd harmonic of Band 5 DL overlaps each other.

operating in single carrier mode.
### 6.41.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.41.3-1 gives the harmonics and IMD products for band 3 + band 5 CA
with 2DLs. It shows that the 2nd harmonics of BS transmitting in Band 3 and
Band 5 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9, 10, 43 and 66, and
the 3rd harmonics of BS transmitting in Band 3 and Band 5 may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 38, 41 and 46. While the 2nd IMD products of BS
supporting CA of Band 3 and Band 5 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands
8 and 41, and the 3rd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands
2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 14, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 33, 35, 39, 42, 43 and 44. Note
that the calculation in table 6.41.3-1 (except the last row) assumes the BS is
transmitting with the whole 75 MHz DL frequency of Band 3 and the whole 25 MHz
DL frequency of Band 5. If the BS is only transmitting an up to 10 MHz DL in
Band 3 and an up to 10 MHz DL in Band 5 as stated in the WIDs, then the 3rd
IMD products will not fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 5, 6, 9, 14,
18, 19, 26, 27, 33 or 44.

that 3^rd^ harmonics falls into band 46.

It can be seen from table 6.42.3-2 that:
\- Some two-tone 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of
Band 1, 2, 7, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41 and 65,
\- Some three -tone 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS receive band
of Band 40.
It is recommended that Band 30 and 66 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with Band 1, 2, 7, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 65
BS receivers unless the antenna path meets very stringent third order PIM
specification so that the antenna PIM will not cause Band 1, 2, 7, 23, 25, 33,
34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 65 BS receiver desensitization.

Table 6.43.3-1 gives the UL to DL harmonic products for CA band 40 + band 42
with 1UL. It can be seen that 2^nd^ harmonics do not fall into the DL of any
band, and that 3^rd^ harmonics do not fall into the DL of any band.

It can be seen from table 6.43.3-2 that:
\- Some three-tone 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS receive band
of Band 22, 30, 40, 42 and 43.
It is recommended that Band 22, 30, 40, 42 and 43 BS transmitters do not share
the same antenna with Band 22, 30, 40, 42 and 43 BS receivers unless the
antenna path meets very stringent third order PIM specification so that the
antenna PIM will not cause Band 22, 30, 40, 42 and 43 BS receiver
desensitization.

6.44.3-1 and 6.44.3-2 are overlapping with the BS uplink operating frequency
range of those band listed in Table 5.5-1 in 36.101, it is recommended that
Bands 39 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same antenna with those Bands
to avoid antenna PIM issue.

### 6.45.3 Co-existence studies
The harmonic relations of Band 8 and Band 41 are calculated as Table 6.45.3-1.
Although the 3^rd^ harmonic of Band 8 UL falls into the upper part of Band 41
Rx, it was concluded in 8A-41A BCS0 that a harmonic trap filter is not needed
due to spectrum occupancy of interested operators.

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.45.3-2 that:
\- the 2nd harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 28 and 41 may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 2, 25, 33, 35, 37, 39 and 46,
\- the 3rd harmonics may fall into none of BS receive band,
\- the 2nd IMD products may fall into BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9, 10,
22, 24, 42, 43, 66 and 70,
\- the 3rd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 7, 8,
12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 38, 41, 44, 46 and 68,
assuming (except the last row) the whole 35MHz DL frequency of Band 8 and the
whole 194 MHz DL frequency of Band 41.
If the BS is only transmitting up to 10 MHz DL in Band 8 and 20MHz DL in Band
41 as stated in the WID, the situation of the 3^rd^ IMD products will not be
changed. In addition, at the time of writing, B46 is not assumed to support UL
transmission.
It should be noted that, at the time of writing, Bands 2, 4, 10, 12, 13, 14,
17, 22, 24, 25, 27, 66, 68 and 70 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 8 and 41. In TDD mode, IMD or harmonics caused by
its own Tx does not affect its Rx so Band 41 can be excluded. Therefore, the
focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 3, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 18, 19, 20, 26, 28, 33, 35. 37, 38, 39, 42, 43 and 44.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
18, 19, 20, 26, 28, 33, 35. 37, 38, 39, 42, 43 or 44 receiver would be well
below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Bands 8 and 41 BS transmitters do not share the
same antenna with Band 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 18, 19, 20, 26, 28, 33, 35. 37, 38,
39, 42, 43 or 44 BS receiver.

It can be seen from Table 6.46.3-2 that:
\- the 2nd harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 28 and 41 may fall into the
BS receive band of Band 46,
\- the 3rd harmonics may fall into BS receive band of Bands 30 and 40,
\- the 2nd IMD products may fall into BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9,
10, 22, 25, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 42, 65, 66 and 70,
\- the 3rd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 7, 8,
12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 38, 41, 44, 46 and 68,
assuming (except the last row) the whole 45MHz DL frequency of Band 28 and the
whole 194 MHz DL frequency of Band 41.
If the BS is only transmitting up to 20 MHz DL in Band 28 and 20MHz DL in Band
41 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS
receive band of Band 5, 6, 12, 17, 19, 20 and 68 as shown in the last row in
Table 6.46.3-2. In addition, at the time of writing, B46 is not assumed to
support UL transmission.
It should be noted that, at the time of writing, Bands 2, 4, 10, 13, 14, 22,
25, 27, 20, 65, 66 and 70 are not intended for use in the same geographical
area as Bands 28 and 41. In TDD mode, IMD or harmonics caused by its own Tx
does not affect its Rx so Band 41 can be excluded. Band 44 is unlikely to use
with Band 28 as Band 44 is TDD relevant of Band 28. Therefore, the focus here
will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 18, 26, 28,
33, 35, 36, 39, 40 and 42.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 1, 3, 7, 8, 9,
18, 26, 28, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40 or 42 receiver would be well below the receiver
noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided
that Bands 28 and 41 BS transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band
1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 18, 26, 28, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40 or 42 BS receiver.

carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [6] when
operating in single carrier mode.
### 6.47.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.47.3-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band 1
or Band 46 for both UL and DL. It can be seen that the harmonic frequencies of
Band 1 and Band 46 in DL are away from the BS receive bands of interest in the
UL. For the UE aspect, the 3^rd^ UL harmonic of Band 1 carrier may fall into
the UE receive Band 46.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 1 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.47.3-2 below:
Table 6.47.3-2: Band 1 and Band 46 DL harmonics and IMD products

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.47.3-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 1 and Band 46 fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 22, 42 and 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 45, 65, 66 and 70.
Note that the calculation in table 6.47.3-2 (except the last row) assumes the
BS transmits the whole 20 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 1 and Band 46
respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 20 MHz and 20 MHz DL in Band 1 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.47.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 6, 8, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24,
26, 27, 45 and 70 as shown in the last row in table 6.47.3-2.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 2, 4, 6, 10, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30,
33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 45, 66 and 70 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 1 and 46. Hence Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19,
20, 21, 26, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 65 may create IMD issues.
In consequence it is recommended that Bands 1 and 46 BS transmitters do not
share the same antenna with Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26,
38, 39, 40, 41 and 65 BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will not cause
Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 65 BS
receiver desensitization.
### 6.47.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For four simultaneous DL and one UL the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ values are shown
in table 6.47.4-1, and in table 6.47.4-2:

6.47.5 MSD
As observed in 6.47.3, this CA configuration has 3rd harmonic issue from Band
1 to Band 46. Nevertheless, it was agreed not to apply HTF for this CA
combination in order to avoid additional insertion loss for the licensed band.
In this case, the frequency gap to avoid MSD in Band 46 and the UL
configuration are specified as shown in table 6.47.5-1 and 6.47.5-2.

It can be seen from Table 6.48.3-2 that:
\- the 2nd harmonics of BS transmitting in Band 7 and 26 may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9, 10 and 66,
\- the 3rd harmonics may fall into Bands 38 and 41,
\- the 2nd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of 3, 4, 9, 10, 42
and 66.
\- the 3rd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8,
14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 38, 41 and 44.
Bands 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 18, 19, 20, 27, 38, 41, 42, 44 and 66 are not intended
for use in the same geographical area as Bands 7 and 26. Therefore, the focus
here is on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 3, 5, 8 and 26.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band 7+26 BS transmitter should not share
the same antenna with Bands 3, 5, 8 and 26 receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM
specification, so that the PIM will not cause Band 5, 8 and 28 receiver
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.

transmitting of Band 29 and Band 70 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
Table 6.50.3-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.50.3-1 the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in
Band 29 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 11, 21 and 45, while the
3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 12, 17, 22, 23,
28, 34, 36, 42, 44, 65, and 68. Note that the calculation in Table 6.50.3-1
(except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 11 MHz DL
frequency of Band 29.
Note that Bands 11, 21, 28, 42, 44, 45, and 68 are not intended for use in the
same geographical area as Bands 29 and 70. Therefore, the focus here is on the
harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 12, 17, 22, 23, 34, and 36.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 12,
17, 22, 23, 34 or 36 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor
eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands
29 and 70 BS transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 12, 17, 22,
23, 34, or 36 BS receiver.
Therefore, in order to prevent BS receiver desensitization, it is recommended
that Bands 29 and 70 BS transmitters should not share the same antenna with
Band 12, 17, 22, 23, 34, or 36 BS receiver unless the antenna path meets very
stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band
12, 17, 22, 23, 34, or 36 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna
sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the
future.
### 6.50.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
Two DL and only one UL operation of CA_29A-70A is formed by diplexing a
carrier in Band 29 with a carrier in Band 70. No harmonic terms overlap with
downlink in Band 29 from uplink in Band 70. The diplexer relaxations ∆T~IB~ =
0.3 dB, ∆R~IB~ = 0 dB apply with no MSD or reference sensitivity exceptions.

### 6.51.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.51.3-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
70 or Band 46 for both UL and DL. It can be seen the harmonic frequencies of
Band 70 in UL are away from the UE receive Band 46. Therefore, there is no
need for MSD since there is no self-interference.

It can be seen from Table 6.51.3-2 the 2nd IMD products supporting CA of Band
46 and Band 70 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 22, 42 43, and 48.
The 3rd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7,
9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 45, 46, 47,
65, 66, and 70.
Note that Bands 1, 9, 11, 21, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40, and 45 are not intended
for use in the same geographical area as Bands 46 and 70. Therefore, the focus
here is on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 23, 24,
25, 30, 35, 36, 41, 46, 47, 65, 66, and 70.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 2,
3, 4, 7, 10, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 36, 41, 46, 47, 65, 66, and 70 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Bands 46 and 70 BS transmitters do not share
the same antenna with Band 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 36, 41, 46, 47,
65, 66, or 70 BS receiver.
Therefore, in order to prevent BS receiver desensitization, it is recommended
that Bands 46 and 70 BS transmitters should not share the same antenna with
Band 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 36, 41, 46, 47, 65, 66, or 70 BS
receiver unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 23, 24, 25,
30, 35, 36, 41, 46, 47, 65, 66, or 70 BS receiver desensitization. Note that
antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in
the future.
### 6.51.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For the UE which supports CA_46A-70A the ∆T~IB~ = 0 dB and ∆R~IB~ = 0 dB apply
respectively assuming separate antenna architecture. No harmonic terms overlap
with downlink in Band 46 from uplink in Band 70.

Note that MSD is not required since there is 1) no self-interference as shown

the Band 46 exclusion region.

It can be seen from Table 6.52.3-1 the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics of BS
transmitting in Band 66 will not fall into any other BS receive Bands, while
the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 23,
25, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, and 65.
Note that Bands 1, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, and 40 are not intended for use in
the same geographical area as Bands 66 and 70. Therefore, the focus here is on
the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 1, 2, 23, 25, 30, and 40.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 12,
17, 22, 23, 34 or 36 BS receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor
eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands
66 and 70 BS transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 12, 17, 22,
23, 34, or 36 BS receiver.
Therefore, in order to prevent BS receiver desensitization, it is recommended
that Bands 66 and 70 BS transmitters should not share the same antenna with
Band 12, 17, 22, 23, 34, or 36 BS receiver unless the antenna path meets very
stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 12,
17, 22, 23, 34, or 36 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing
may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
