# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for 2DL/2UL Inter-band Carrier
Aggregation under Rel-14 time frame. It covers both the UE and BS side. The
document is divided in two different parts:
\- General part: this part covers BS and UE specific which is band combination
independent.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination and
its specific issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is
defined per band combination)
The specific band combination parts are independent and therefore, the working
speed also differs.
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.
# 5 Dual Uplink Inter-band Carrier Aggregation: General Part
As dual uplink inter-band CA combinations have been studied in Rel-12 and
Rel-13, the general issues identified in Rel-12 [3] and Rel-13 [4] also apply
to Rel-14. This TR only captures the new general issues identified in Rel-14.
## 5.1 UE co-existence table for 2UL CA including Band 46
This clause specifies the requirements for the specified carrier aggregation
configurations including Band 46 for coexistence with protected bands.

Based on Table 6.1.3-1, 2^nd^, 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD may fall into own Rx
of band 3 and 2^nd^ harmonic of band 3 may fall into own Rx of band 42. In
addition, 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order IMD may also fall into Rx frequencies of bands
3, 9, 22, 35, 39, 42 and 43.
When 2UL inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.1.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.1.4 ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values
For inter-band CA_3-42, same requirements on values for ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ can
apply with 1UL-2DL case. Therefore, for two simultaneous UL, the ∆T~IB,c~ and
∆R~IB,c~ values are shown in table 6.1.4-1 and in table 6.1.4-2:
Table 6.1.4-1: ΔT~IB,c~

### 6.1.5 MSD
As shown in Table 6.1.3-1, 2^nd^, 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD may fall into own
Rx of band 3. Table 6.1.5-1, 6.1.5-2 and 6.1.5-3 are MSD analyses which assume
10 dB antenna isolation and single antenna architecture with respect to each
IMD order.

Based on Table 6.2.3-1, 4^th^ order IMD may fall into own Rx of band 19. 2^nd^
and 3^rd^ order IMD and harmonics may also fall into Rx frequencies of bands
2, 3, 7, 9, 18, 20, 22, 25, 26, 27, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41 and 43.
However, taking into account that Band 21 is only operated by a certain
operator so far, the Band 42 transmission for this combination is limited
within 3480 - 3520 MHz based on the actual spectrum allocation. In this case,
the 4^th^ order IMD range is 945 -- 1030 MHz and the degradation of Band 19
will be resolved.
When 2ULs inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.2.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.2.4 ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values
For inter-band CA_19-42, same requirements on values for ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~
can apply with 1UL-2DL case. Therefore, for two simultaneous UL, the ∆T~IB,c~
and ∆R~IB,c~ values are shown in table 6.2.4-1 and in table 6.2.4-2:

Based on table 6.3.3-1, IMD will not fall into own RX band. 2^nd^ and 3^rd^
order IMD and harmonics may fall into RX frequencies of bands 1, 2, 4, 10, 11,
22, 25, 34, 36, 43, 44.
When 2ULs inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.3.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.5.3-1 and 6.5.3-2, 4^th^ order IMD may fall into own Rx of
band 3 and band 41. In addition, 2^nd^ harmonics and 2^nd^, 3^rd^ order IMD
may also fall into Rx frequencies of bands 5-6, 8, 12-14, 17-20, 22, 26-29 and
42-44.
When 2ULs inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.5.3-3 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.5.4 ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values
For two simultaneous DLs and two simultaneous ULs, same requirements on values
for ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ can be applied with 2DL/1UL case. Therefore, the
∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values for 2UL/2DL CA_3A-41A are shown in table 6.5.4-1
and table 6.5.4-2, respectively.

Based on the table above there are no harmonics or IMD's that fall on top of
own RX band.
2UL inter-band CA UE can have impacts on other systems such as Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth and GNSS due to its harmonics and intermodulations. Table 6.6.3-2
lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one
of these receiving bands.

Based on Table above, 3^rd^ order IMD may fall into own Rx of band 41 and band
42 but as long as self-desense is concerned, there would be no problem since
this 2UL CA assumes non simultaneous Rx/Tx, i.e. Rx is not operated while Tx
is active. This means that extra REFSENS requirement such as MSD is not needed
for this 2UL CA.
In addition, there are many possible fall-down into UE receive frequencies as
below:
\- 2nd harmonics: band 46,
\- 2nd IMD: bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29, 44, 46,
67 and 68,
\- 3rd IMD: bands 2, 3, 7, 9, 11, 21, 22, 24, 25, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38,
39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45 and 69,
\- 4th IMD: bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
37, 39, 45, 65, 66 and 70,
\- 5th IMD: bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 44,
46, 67 and 68.
When 2UL inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.7.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.7. 4 ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values
For 1UL inter-band TDD-TDD CA cases without simultaneous Rx/Tx, the
architecture depicted in Figure 6.7.4-1 has been largely employed. In this
architecture, an antenna switch is used for selecting 3 paths (Band A Tx, Band
B Tx, Band A+B Rx) to eliminate a diplexer (and additional IL) in Tx path.
{width="3.517361111111111in" height="2.0840277777777776in"}
Figure 6.7.4-1: Architecture for 1UL TDD-TDD inter-band CA
To support 2UL in inter-band CA, apparently the architecture could not be
reused. A straight-forward way is to use the diplexer for both Tx and Rx in
Figure 6.7.4-2 for instance. As an alternative choice, since this combination
consists of H-VH frequencies, we can rely on "common triplexer" to
split/combine these bands in Figure 6.7.4-3.
Figure 6.7.4-2: Architecture for 2UL using a diplexer
Figure 6.7.4-3: Architecture for 2UL using a common triplexer
Recently, multiple CA combination support in a UE is not an exotic
prerequisite and thus assuming common triplexer is a natural choice from the
standpoint of flexibility and commonality in CA configurations. Therefore, it
is proposed to assume the common triplexer architecture for 2UL 41A-42A
evaluation.
Based on Figure 6.7.4-3, after the common diplexer, both B41 and B42 RF only
need the same parts as for single band support: a switch to select Tx and Rx,
filters (if any) to reduce unwanted emission/blocking signals, and so on. The
switch is anyway required for common diplexer configuration to work as
"antenna switch" in the conventional implementations so it is not necessary to
count it in as additional IL. Thus, for 2UL support of 41A-42A assuming the
architecture as above, additional IL comes from the common diplexer alone so
the default values for common diplexer can be applied to ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~:

Based on Table 6.8.3-1, IMD up to 5^th^ order does not fall into own Rx of
band 3 and 21. On the other hand, 3^rd^ order IMD may also fall into Rx
frequencies of bands 1, 2, 4, 10, 11, 25, 34, 36, 65, 66 and 70.
When 2UL inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.8.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

apply with 1UL-2DL case. Therefore, for two simultaneous UL, the ∆T~IB,c~ and
∆R~IB,c~ values are shown in table 6.8.4-1 and in table 6.8.4-2:

### 6.8.5 MSD
As shown in Table 6.8.3-1, IMD up to 5^th^ order does not fall into own Rx of

Based on Table 6.9.3-1, the 5^th^ order IMD may fall into own Rx of band 8 and
3^nd^ harmonic of band 8 may fall into own Rx of band 7. In addition, 2^nd^
and 3^rd^ order IMD may also fall into Rx frequencies of bands 12, 13, 14, 17,
20, 28, 29, 42, 44, 46, 67 and 68. It should be noted, the 5th order IMD is
falling to DL frequencies of Band 8 in the range of 950-960MHz when fx_low is
in the range of 880-882.5MHz. If BS is operating in Band 8 DL frequencies in
the range of 950-960MHz, the Band 8 UL frequencies are in the range of
905-915MHz, with consideration of maximum 10MHz channel bandwidth on Band 8,
the 5th order IMD will not fall into own receive block of Band 8 in this
combination, no issue is foreseen with receiver desensitisation.
When 2UL inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.9.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.10.3-1, IMD3 falls into own Rx of band 28. However, when the
IMD3 falls into the Rx of band 28, the upper edge of Tx of band 28 needs to be
higher than 738MHz assuming bandwidth of 20MHz in band 3. In this case, the
lower edge of Rx of band 28 is higher than 783MHz to maintain Tx-Rx separation
of 55MHz assuming bandwidth of 10MHz in band 28\. Therefore, the IMD3 never
falls into the received signal in band 28 and it is concluded that there is no
own IMD issue for this band combination. On the other hand, 2^nd^ order IMD
may also fall into Rx frequencies of bands 41 and 3^rd^ order IMD may also
fall into Rx frequencies of bands 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 29, 41, 44, 67 and 68.
When 2UL inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.10.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.10.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For inter-band CA_3-28, same requirements on values for ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ can
apply with 1UL-2DL case. Therefore, for two simultaneous UL, the ∆T~IB,c~ and
∆R~IB,c~ values are shown in table 6.10.4-1 and in table 6.10.4-2:

6.10.5 MSD
As shown in Table 6.10.3-1, IMD up to 5^th^ order does not fall into own Rx of
band 3 and 28. Therefore, no MSD requirement is needed for this 2DL/2UL CA
configuration in TS 36.101.

Based on Table 6.11.3-1, IMD4 and 5 may fall into own Rx of band 21 and IMD2,
3, 4 and 5 may fall into own Rx of band 28. However, taking into account that
Band 21 is only operated by a certain operator so far, the Band 28
transmission for this combination is limited within 728 -- 738 MHz based on
the actual spectrum allocation. In this case, IMD4 issue for own Rx of band 21
and IMD2, 3, 4 and 5 issues for own Rx of B28 will be resolved. Therefore, it
is concluded that there is only IMD5 issue for own Rx of band 21. On the other
hand, 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order IMD may also fall into Rx frequencies of bands 10,
12, 13, 17, 23, 29, 43, 44, 45, 46, 65, 66 and 67.
When 2UL inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.11.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.11.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For inter-band CA_21-28, same requirements on values for ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ can

Based on Table 6.12.3-1, 3^rd^ and 5^th^ order IMD may fall into own Rx of
band 28. However, when the IMD3 falls into the Rx of band 28, the upper edge
of Tx of band 28 needs to be higher than 738MHz assuming bandwidth of 20MHz in
band 42. In this case, the lower edge of Rx of band 28 is higher than 783MHz
to maintain Tx-Rx separation of 55MHz assuming bandwidth of 10MHz in band 28.
Therefore, the IMD3 never falls into the received signal in band 28 and it is
concluded that there is own IMD5 issue only for this band combination. On the
other hand, 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order IMD and harmonics may also fall into Rx
frequencies of bands 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 22, 23, 25, 29, 33, 34,
35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 65, 66, 67, 68 and 70.
When 2ULs inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.12.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on the table above there are no harmonics or IMD's that fall on top of
own RX band.
2UL inter-band CA UE can have impacts on other systems such as WiFi, Bluetooth
and GNSS due to its harmonics and intermodulations. Table 6.13.3-2 lists if up
to 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these

#### 6.29.3.2 Co-existence with other systems
When 2ULs inter-band CA UE is operating with other systems such as Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.29.3.2-1 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

### 6.29.4. ∆TIB and ∆RIB values
For inter-band 2UL/2DL CA_5A-40A, same requirements on values for ∆T~IB~ and
∆R~IB~ of 1UL-2DL case can apply. Therefore, for two simultaneous UL, the
∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are shown in table 6.29.4-1 and in table
6.29.4-2.
Table 6.29.4-1: ∆Τ~IB,c~
* * *
Inter-band CA Configuration E-UTRA Band ΔT~IB,c~ [dB] CA_5A-40A 5 0.3 40 0.3

### 6.29.5. MSD
As shown in Table 6.29.3.1-2 IMD up to 5th order does not fall into own Rx of
band 5 and 40. Therefore, no MSD requirement is needed for this 2DL/2UL CA
configuration in TS 36.101.
