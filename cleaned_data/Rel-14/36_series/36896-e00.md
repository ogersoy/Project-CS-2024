## 5.2 Possible Solutions
### 5.2.1 Solution 1: Fixed extension of eNB ID
This solution is to extend the eNB ID by a fixed number of bits (e.g.1 or 2
bits) while keeping the CI length (28bits) unchanged. The eNB ID is introduced
as an extendable choice IE using 21 bits extension as an example. The solution
requires modification on different 3GPP specifications when moving the
boundary in ECI so that eNB could use 20+N bits, while Cell ID uses 8-N bits.

### 5.2.2 Solution 2: Using Multiple PLMN IDs
To allow more eNBs in an operator network, the operator could use more than
one PLMN ID in the network to support more than 1.04 million eNBs in their
network.
#### 5.2.2.1 Solution 2a: The New PLMN(s) Configured as Equivalent PLMN
The Equivalent PLMN has been introduced since 3GPP R99 specifications and also
adopted to the LTE. It extends the HPLMN concept to a set of PLMNs which the
mobile equipment considers as equivalent.
One main purpose of ePLMN is to help the operator who has different PLMN codes
should all be treated as a single HPLMN.
So when a new PLMN is acquired by the operator, for the purpose such as to
handle the situation of having more than 1 million eNBs deployed, the new PLMN
is declared as an equivalent PLMN of the existing PLMN.
The E-PLMN list is signalled to the mobile equipment by the MME, MSC or SGSN,
from the registered PLMN, at each Tracking Area Update, Location Area Update,
Routing Area Update and IMSI Attach procedures via a dedicated signalling
connection. For example in LTE, it is included in the Tracking Area Update
Accept message.
The mobile equipment shall store the list of \"equivalent PLMNs\". The mobile
equipment shall treat these PLMNs as equivalent to each other for PLMN
selection and cell selection/reselection and handover.
#### 5.2.2.2 Solution 2b: Network Sharing
The operator has been using one PLMN ID and now adds one or more new PLMN IDs.
The following notation is used:
\- PLMN A: existing PLMN in the operator network.
\- PLMN B: New PLMN added in the operator network in order to enable
deployment of more eNBs.
The user equipments are all registered in PLMN A.
The eNBs broadcast system information in SIB 1. As a single cell can belong to
multiple PLMNs, so SIB 1 may broadcast a list of PLMN identities.
\- Existing eNBs:
\- Broadcasted primary PLMN: PLMN A
\- Broadcasted secondary PLMN: None
\- New added eNBs:
\- Broadcasted primary PLMN: PLMN B
\- Broadcasted secondary PLMN: PLMN A
The MMEs are configured to support both PLMNs and regard them as equivalent:
\- Served PLMNs: PLMN A and PLMN B
\- Served Group IDs: No update needed
\- Served MMEC: No update needed
With this configuration a UE whose SIM is registered on PLMN A is able to
request services on the eNBs with primary PLMN B. All identifiers required for
identifying the new eNBs use PLMN B. The UE supporting LTE supports reading of
the multiple PLMNs.
### 5.2.3 Solution 3: Reusing eNB ID in different geographic areas
This solution is to reuse eNB IDs for the areas that are geographically very
far apart. And the definition of the far apart areas is defined as:
\- The probability that a UE in Area A detects an eNB in Area B is not
significant.
\- The probability that a UE in Area B detects an eNB in Area A is not
significant.
\- The interference by an Area A eNB in Area B is not significant
\- The interference by an Area B eNB in Area A is not significant
An eNB in Area B using the same eNB ID as an eNB in Area A are configured with
different tracking areas and there is neither the chance that those tracking
areas ever appear in the same TA list any UE is registered, nor any possible
the two TA lists are "neighbouring" TA lists.
Since the eNBs do not detect each other based on UE measurements and do not
cause any interference there is no need to setup X2 between them. UE would not
be in need to handover between the eNBs with the reused ID either via S1 or
via X2, and the UE does not need to report network neighbours between those
eNBs.
#### 5.2.3.1 Solution 3a: Without duplication of ECGI
The Cell-ID (8 bits) in ECGI can not be reused in the far apart areas. There
are no cells with the same ECGI in the operator's network.
#### 5.2.3.2 Solution 3b: With duplication of ECGI
The Cell-ID (8bit) in ECGI can be reused in the far apart areas. There are two
or more cells with the same ECGI in the operator's networks.
#### 5.2.3.3 Solution 3c: Combined use of eNB-ID and TAC
This solution is to reuse eNB IDs together with TAC to ensure uniqueness of
eNB ID in each tracking area. TAC consists of 16-bits and ECI consists of 28
bits and the combined use of them can yield greater deployment flexibility.
TAC and ECGI are already available in SIB1, _MeasResults_ RLF Reporting.

# 6 Extend maximum number of Cells in an eNB
## 6.1 Evaluation criteria
The solutions presented this study shall be analysed with the following
evaluation criteria:
\- Impact on existing nodes (UE, CN and upper layers, eNB, UTRAN, GSM, WLAN)
\- Impact on specification , existing features and procedures (e.g. restart)
\- Impact on interworking with legacy nodes

\- Impact on CAPEX/OPEX
## 6.2 Possible Solutions
### 6.2.1 Solution 1: Integrate multiple logical eNBs into a single physical
eNB
This solution is to integrate multiple logical eNBs into a single physical
eNB, which is an implementation choice available today. The physical eNB can
serve 256 cells per logical eNB that is integrated.
Each logical eNB will follow current standards, and establish a separate S1
interface with the MME and a separate X2 interface with logical eNBs that are
not integrated into the physical eNB. There is no need for an X2 interface
between logical eNBs that are integrated. The Path Switch Request procedure is
still required for handovers between cells of the physical eNB when the source
and target belong to different logical eNBs.
### 6.2.2 Solution 2: Fixed extension of Cell bits
This solution is to reduce he eNB ID by a fixed number of bits (e.g.1 or 2
bits), enabling the maximum supported cells to be 512 or 1024 accordingly. The
eNB ID is introduced as an extendable choice IE, which is using 18 bits
extension as an example.

### 6.2.3 Solution3: Supporting more Macro eNB IDs in an interface instance
This solution is to allow the eNB to have a list of additional Macro eNB IDs
(20bits eNB ID). This results in a logical eNB supporting multiple Global eNB
IDs as follows:
\- Global eNB ID indicated by the legacy _Global eNB ID_ IE, and
\- additional Global eNB IDs created from the list of additional Macro eNB IDs
and having the same PLMN Identity as the legacy _Global eNB ID_ IE.
The eNB establishes a single interface with the MME and neighbour eNBs, and
informs them of the list of additional Macro eNB IDs.

### 6.2.4 Solution 4: Combined use of eNB-ID and TAC
The solution in Section 5.2.3.3 can be readily applied to extend maximum
number of Cells per eNB as described in section 6 by using more than one TAC
per eNB.

\- Impact on existing nodes:
\- eNB must be upgraded to support multiple Global eNB IDs per X2 interface;
\- MME: must be upgraded to support multiple Global eNB IDs per S1 interface
\- It was understand that the eNB with more cells need more efforts in
implementation to handling the large number of cells, and has a single point
of failure for the control plane signalling.
\- Impact on specification, existing features and procedures:
\- S1AP: impacts the S1 Setup procedure
\- XAP: impacts the X2 Setup procedure
\- Impact on inter-working with legacy nodes:
\- MME and neighbouring eNBs must be upgraded to understand the new IEs in the
S1/X2 Setup procedures, otherwise the S1/X2 Setup procedures will fail;
\- Impact on signalling:
\- There is a potential reduction of S1 signalling towards the core network
due to fewer inter-eNB handovers
\- Impact on network planning: None
\- Impact on CAPEX/OPEX:
\- The CAPEX/OPEX reduction is unclear.
### 6.3.4 Evaluation on "Combined use of eNB-ID and TAC"
The evaluation on "Combined use of eNB-ID and TAC" refers to Section 5.3.3.3.
# 7 Conclusions
## 7.1 Extend maximum number of eNBs in a PLMN
RAN3 has discussed the possible enhancements to extend the maximum number of
eNBs in a PLMN.
\- Solution 1 requires changes in all specifications and nodes using eNB ID
for identification or routing.
\- Solution 2a needs the extra PLMN-ID from the operator and corresponding
configuration for the PLMN.
\- Solution 2b needs the extra PLMN-ID from the operator and corresponding
configuration for the PLMN. The extra PLMN(s) may need to be broadcast in SIB1
\- Solution 3a and 3b impact the definition of Global eNB-ID or ECGI in the
specifications. Some network nodes (e.g., Core network, CBC, and location
system) are impacted.
\- Solution 3c requires changes in some specifications using eNB ID for
identification or routing. Some network nodes (e.g., Core network, CBC, and
location system) are impacted.
The above solutions all have limitation/impacts on deployment and/or
standardization. No clear benefit is shown for any of the solutions. However
the following solutions satisfy the objectives in the Study Item and could be
considered further:
\- Solution 1 "Fixed extension of eNB ID";
\- Solution 3 (a,b,c) "Reusing eNB ID in different geographic areas".
## 7.2 Extend maximum number of cells in an eNB
RAN3 has discussed the possible enhancements to extend the maximum number of
cells in an eNB.
\- Solution 1 does not have standards impacts. The Path Switch procedure is
still required for handovers between cells of the physical eNB when the source
and target belong to different logical eNBs.
\- Solution 2 requires changes in all specifications and nodes using eNB ID
for identification or routing. It impacts specifications in the same way as
solution 1 in chapter 7.1. It has a single point of failure for the control
plane signalling.
\- Solution 3 has standards impacts. The primary impact is that there is no
longer a 1:1 mapping of Global eNB ID to S1/X2 interface instance. There is a
potential reduction of S1 signalling towards the core network, but it has a
single point of failure for the control plane signalling.
\- Solution 4 requires changes in some specifications using eNB ID for
identification or routing. Some network nodes (e.g., Core network, CBC, and
location system) are impacted.
The above solutions all have limitation/impacts on deployment and/or
standardization. No clear benefit is shown for any of the solutions. However,
at least the following solutions satisfy the objectives in the Study Item and
could be considered further:
\- Solution 2 "Fixed extension of Cell bits";
\- Solution 4 "Combined use of eNB-ID and TAC".
