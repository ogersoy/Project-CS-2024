# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Fallback band combination:** A band combination that would result from
another band combination (parent band combination) by releasing at least one
SCell or uplink configuration of SCell. A fallback band combination and the
parent band combination support the same bandwidths for each band of the
fallback band combination. An intra-band non-contiguous band combination is
not considered to be a fallback band combination of an intra-band contiguous
band combination.
**NB-IoT:** NB-IoT allows access to network services via E-UTRA with a channel
bandwidth limited to 200 kHz (corresponding to one PRB).
**Primary Cell:** The cell, operating on the primary frequency, in which the
UE either performs the initial connection establishment procedure or initiates
the connection re-establishment procedure, or the cell indicated as the
primary cell in the handover procedure. In this specification, Primary Cell
also refers to PSCell defined in TS 36.331 [5] unless explicitly stated
otherwise.
**Sidelink** : UE to UE interface for sidelink communication, V2X sidelink
communication and sidelink discovery. The Sidelink corresponds to the PC5
interface as defined in TS 23.303 [24].
**Sidelink communication** : AS functionality enabling ProSe Direct
Communication as defined in TS 23.303 [24], between two or more nearby UEs,
using E-UTRA technology but not traversing any network node. In this version,
the terminology \"sidelink communication\" without \"V2X\" prefix only
concerns PS unless specifically stated otherwise.
**Sidelink discovery** : AS functionality enabling ProSe Direct Discovery as
defined in TS 23.303 [24], using E-UTRA technology but not traversing any
network node.
**V2X sidelink communication** : AS functionality enabling V2X Communication
as defined in TS 23.285 [29], between nearby UEs, using E-UTRA technology but
not traversing any network node.

# 4 UE radio access capability parameters
The following clauses define the UE radio access capability parameters and
minimum capabilities for MBMS capable UE. Only parameters for which there is
the possibility for UEs to signal different values are considered as UE radio
access capability parameters. Therefore, mandatory features without capability
parameters that are the same for all UEs are not listed here. Also
capabilities which are optional or conditionally mandatory for UEs to
implement but do not have UE radio access capability parameter are listed in
this specification.
E-UTRAN needs to respect the signalled UE radio access capability parameters
when configuring the UE and when scheduling the UE.
All parameters shown in italics are signalled and correspond to a field
defined in TS 36.331 [5].
For optional features, the UE radio access capability parameter indicates
whether the feature has been implemented and successfully tested. For
mandatory features with the UE radio access capability parameter, the
parameter indicates whether the feature has been successfully tested.
The mandatory features required to be supported by a UE are the same for all
UE categories unless explicitly specified elsewhere in the specifications.
The following UE radio access capability parameters specified in Chapter 4 are
applicable in NB-IoT:
\- _ue-Category-NB_ in NB-IoT (clause 4.1C)
\- _supportedROHC-Profiles-r13_ (clause 4.3.1.1A)
\- _maxNumberROHC-ContextSessions-r13_ (clause 4.3.1.2A)
\- _multiTone-r13_ (clause 4.3.4.55)
\- _multiCarrier-r13_ (clause 4.3.4.56)
\- _twoHARQ-Processes-r14_ (clause 4.3.4.62)
\- _multiCarrier-NPRACH-r14_ (clause 4.3.4.75)
\- _multiCarrierPaging-r14_ (clause 4.3.4.76)
\- _interferenceRandomisation-r14_ (clause 4.3.4.80)
\- _supportedBandList-r13_ (clause 4.3.5.1A)
\- _multiNS-Pmax-r13_ (clause 4.3.5.16A)
\- _powerClassNB-20dBm-r13_ (clause 4.3.5.1A.1)
\- _powerClassNB-14dBm-r14_ (clause 4.3.5.1A.2)
\- _accessStratumRelease-r13_ (clause 4.3.8.1A)
\- _multipleDRB-r13_ (clause 4.3.8.5)
\- _logicalChannelSR-ProhibitTimer_ (clause 4.3.19.2)
\- _dataInactMon-r14_ (clause 4.3.19.9)
\- _rai-Support-r14_ (clause 4.3.19.10)
\- _earlyContentionResolution-r14_ (clause 4.3.19.12)
The UE radio access capabilities specified in Chapter 4 are not applicable in
NB-IoT, unless they are listed above. The optional features without UE radio
access capability parameters specified in Chapter 6 are not applicable in NB-
IoT, except for System Information Block Type 16, SC-PTM in Idle mode, RRC
connection re-establishment for Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation, Relaxed
monitoring, enhanced random access power control, serving cell idle mode
measurements reporting and DL channel quality reporting. The conditionally
mandatory features specified in Chapter 7 are not applicable in NB-IoT.
## 4.1 _ue-Category_
The field _ue-Category_ defines a combined uplink and downlink capability. The
parameters set by the UE Category are defined in clause 4.2. Tables 4.1-1 and
4.1-2 define the downlink and, respectively, uplink physical layer parameter
values for each UE Category. A UE indicating category 6 or 7 shall also
indicate category 4. A UE indicating category 8 shall also indicate category
5. A UE indicating category 9 shall also indicate category 6 and 4. A UE
indicating category 10 shall also indicate category 7 and 4. A UE indicating
category 11 shall also indicate category 9, 6 and 4. A UE indicating category
12 shall also indicate category 10, 7 and 4. Table 4.1-4 defines the minimum
capability for the maximum number of bits of a MCH transport block received
within a TTI for an MBMS capable UE capable of reception via MBSFN.

values in the UE category (i.e., maximum number of DL-SCH/UL-SCH transport
block bits received/transmitted within a TTI, maximum number of bits of a DL-
SCH/UL-SCH transport block received/transmitted within a TTI, and total number
of soft channel bits for downlink).
NOTE: If the UE reports a subset of supported band combinations based on
_requestedFrequencyBands_ and/or _skipFallbackCombinations_ and/or
_maximumCCsRetrieval,_ reported band combination(s) may or may not meet the

operation for these cells.
The UE indicating more than one frequency in the _MBMSInterestIndication_
message as specified in TS 36.331 [5] shall support simultaneous reception of
MBMS (via MBSFN or SC-PTM) on the indicated frequencies when the frequencies
of the configured serving cells and the indicated frequencies belong to at
least one band combination.
NOTE: For the purposes of determining whether the carrier aggregation and MIMO
capabilities indicated for a band combination meets the processing
requirements defined by the physical layer parameter values in the UE category
as described above, the carrier aggregation and MIMO capabilities indicated
for a band combination is considered to meet the processing requirements if
the UE supports the maximum processing requirements defined by the UE category
assuming 20MHz channel bandwidth is supported on all bands.
While PCell is not changed, the UE shall support release of any SCell(s) or
any uplink configuration of SCell(s) without requiring reconfiguration of
parameters related to UE radio access capabilities for the remaining serving
cell(s) in the fallback band combination, except for release of an SCell from
a contiguous CA band configuration that results in a non-contiguous CA band
configuration.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Guideline on maximum number of DL PDCP SDUs
per TTI
In order to help the dimensioning of the UE design, values for the maximum
number of DL PDCP SDUs per TTI from Table A-1 may be used.
Note: Due to the need for the network buffer data for efficient scheduling,
values for Category 1, 1bis and 2 are same. It is not expected that category 1
or category 1bis UE has to sustain the same rate of PDCP SDUs per TTI as
category 2 for prolonged period of time.
Table A-1: Maximum values for DL PDCP SDUs per TTI
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | UE Category / ue-CategoryDL | Maximum number of PDCP SDUs per TTI | +=============================+=====================================+ | Category 1 | 10 | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Category 1bis | 10 | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Category 2 | 10 | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Category 3 | 20 | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Category 4 / | 30 | | | | | DL Category 4 | | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Category 5 | 50 | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Category 6 / | 50 | | | | | DL Category 6 | | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Category 7 / | 50 | | | | | DL Category 7 | | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Category 9 / | 80 | | | | | DL Category 9 | | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Category 10 / | 80 | | | | | DL Category 10 | | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Category 11 / | 100 | | | | | DL Category 11 | | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | Category 12 / | 100 | | | | | DL Category 12 | | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | DL Category 13 | 65 | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | DL Category 15 | 130 | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | DL Category 16 | 180 | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | DL Category 18 | 200 | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | DL Category 19 | 280 | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | DL Category 20 | 360 | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+ | DL Category 21 | 240 | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+
