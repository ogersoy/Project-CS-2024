# Introduction
A study item, "Feasibility Study on LTE-based V2X Services", was approved at
3GPP TSG RAN #68 [2]. This study is to evaluate new functionalities needed to
operate LTE-based V2X services defined in [3]. The objectives of the study
include definition of an evaluation methodology and possible scenarios for
vehicular services based on LTE, and identification and evaluation of
necessary enhancements to LTE physical layer, RAN protocols, and interfaces.
The results and findings of the study are documented in this technical report.
# 1 Scope
The present document contains the results and findings from the study item,
"Feasibility Study on LTE-based V2X Services" [2]. The purpose of this TR is
to document the identified LTE enhancements and corresponding evaluations for
LTE-based V2X services defined in [3] as follows:
\- V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle): covering LTE-based communication between
vehicles.
\- V2P (vehicle-to-pedestrian): covering LTE-based communication between a
vehicle and a device carried by an individual (e.g. handheld terminal carried
by a pedestrian, cyclist, driver or passenger).
\- V2I/N (vehicle-to-infrastructure/network): covering LTE-based communication
between a vehicle and a roadside unit/network. A roadside unit (RSU) is a
stationary infrastructure entity supporting V2X applications that can exchange
messages with other entities supporting V2X applications. Note: RSU is a term
frequently used in existing ITS specifications, and the reason for introducing
the term in the 3GPP specifications is to make the documents easier to read
for the ITS industry. RSU is a logical entity that combines V2X application
logic with the functionality of an eNB (referred to as eNB-type RSU) or UE
(referred to as UE-type RSU).
This document addresses LTE-based V2X both with and without LTE network
coverage, and covers both the operating scenario where the carrier(s) is/are
dedicated to LTE-based V2X services (subject to regional regulation and
operator policy including the possibility of being shared by multiple
operators) and the operating scenario where the carrier(s) is/are licensed
spectrum and also used for normal LTE operation.
This technical report contains the evaluation methodology for LTE-based V2V,
V2I/N and V2P services to compare the performance of different technical
options.
This document identifies necessary enhancements to LTE for support of PC5
transport for V2V services.
This document captures identification and evaluation of Uu transport for V2V
and PC5/Uu transport for V2I/N and V2P services.
This document is a 'living' document, i.e. it is permanently updated and
presented to TSG-RAN meetings.

# 4 V2X operation scenarios
## 4.1 Scenario 1
### 4.1.1 General description

_In this scenario, a UE transmits a V2X message to multiple UEs at a local
area in sidelink._
_For V2I, either transmitter UE or receiver UE(s) are UE-type RSU._

(a) V2V operation
(b) V2I operation
(c) V2P operation
Figure 4-1: Scenario 1
### 4.1.2 Operation aspects
RAN aspects for PC5-based V2X operation (Tx/Rx of V2X message) are as follows:
  * (Aspect 1) Operation bands used as test points for evaluation
    * Case 1A: 6 GHz
    * Case 1B: 2 GHz
> Note: Case 1B may not be need to be specifically simulated for all scenarios
  * (Aspect 2) eNB deployment consideration including possibility of network control
    * Case 2A: UE autonomous resource allocation, at least mode 2, based on semi-statically network-configured/pre-configured radio parameters including no eNB coverage case.
    * Case 2B: eNB providing more UE specific or/and more dynamic resource allocation including Mode 1 compared to case 2A.
> Note: Related to aspect 2, it is necessary to consider the condition to
> apply any preconfigured radio parameters.
  * (Aspect 3) Multi-carrier operation
    * Case 3A: UEs communicating over PC5 across a single carrier.
    * Case 3B: UEs communicating over PC5 across multiple carriers.
  * (Aspect 4) Operating scenarios
    * Case 4A: Single operator operation
    * Case 4B: A set of PC5 operation carrier(s) is shared by UEs subscribed to different operators. This means that UEs belonging to different operators may transmit on the same carrier.
    * Case 4C: Each operator is allocated with a different carrier. This means that a UE transmits only on the carrier allocated to the operator which it belongs to.
    * FFS: Case 4D: No operator operation
  * (Aspect 5) Co-existing with Uu
    * Case 5A: Dedicated carrier for V2x. There is no uplink (Uu) traffic on the PC5 operation carrier.
    * Case 5B: V2x carrier is shared with Uu.
All scenarios and combinations captured above should be considered in scope of
the study item.
## 4.2 Scenario 2
### 4.2.1 General description
This scenario supports V2X operation only based on Uu.
_In this scenario,_
\- For V2V and V2P, a UE transmits a V2X message to E-UTRAN in uplink and
E-UTRAN transmits it to multiple UEs at a local area in downlink.
\- For V2I, when receiver is eNB type RSU, a UE transmits a V2I message to
E-UTRAN(eNB type RSU) in uplink; when transmitter is eNB type RSU, E-UTRAN(eNB
type RSU) transmits a I2V message to multiple UEs at a local area in downlink.
\- For V2N, the UE communicates with an application server (e.g. traffic
safety server).
For V2P, either transmitter UE or receiver UE(s) are pedestrian UE.
To support this scenario, E-UTRAN performs uplink reception and downlink
transmission of V2X messages. For downlink, E-UTRAN may use a broadcast
mechanism. It is FFS whether E-UTRAN supports RSU for V2V and V2P operation.

(b) V2I operation
(c) V2P operation
(d) V2N operation

### 4.2.2 Operation aspects
RAN aspects for Uu-based V2X operation (Tx/Rx of V2X message) in this scenario
are as follows:
  * **(Aspect 1) Operation bands used as test points for evaluation**
    * Case 1A: 6 GHz
    * Case 1B: 2 GHz
NOTE: Case 1A may not be needed to be specifically simulated for uplink and
downlink.
  * **(Aspect 2) eNB deployment consideration including possibility of network control**
    * eNB deployment and network control for radio resources are always assumed in uplink and downlink.
```{=html}
``` \- **(Aspect 3) Multi-carrier operation**
> For UL:
  * Case 3A-UL: UEs performing uplink transmissions at a single carrier for V2X messages.
  * Case 3B-UL: UEs performing uplink transmissions across multiple carriers for V2X messages.
> For DL:
  * Case 3A-DL: UEs performing downlink receptions at a single carrier for V2X messages.
  * Case 3B-DL: UEs performing downlink receptions across multiple carriers for V2X messages.
```{=html}
``` \- **(Aspect 4) Operating scenarios**
    -   Case 4A: Single operator operation (i.e. message exchange across
        operators are not assumed.)
    -   Case 4B: A set of Uu operation carrier(s) is shared by UEs
        subscribed to different operators.
        -   In this case, UEs belonging to different operators transmit
            on the shared uplink carrier(s) while receiving on the
            shared downlink carrier(s).
    -   Case 4C: Each operator is allocated with a different carrier for
        both uplink and downlink.
        -   In this case, a UE transmits only on the uplink carrier(s)
            allocated to the operator to which it belongs. The UE may
            receive on multiple DL carriers, i.e., UE receives on the
            downlink carrier allocated to the other operator as well as
            the downlink carrier allocated to the operator to which it
            belongs.
        -   A UE is allowed to receive downlink broadcast of other
            operator.
NOTE: The study excludes the case that each operator is allocated with a
different uplink carrier while a set of downlink operation carrier(s) is
shared by UEs subscribed to different operators. The study excludes the case
that a set of uplink operation carrier(s) is shared by UEs subscribed to
different operators while each operator is allocated with a different downlink
carrier.
  * **(Aspect 5) Co-existing with Uu/sidelink**
    * Case 5A: There is no sidelink traffic on the Uu operation carrier.
    * Case 5B: The uplink carrier is shared with sidelink.
NOTE: It is FFS whether the uplink carrier can be the dedicated operation
carrier for V2X.
  * **(Aspect 6) Single/multiple eNB**
    * Case 6A: Uplink reception and downlink transmission for the same message are performed by the same eNB.
    * Case 6B: Uplink reception and downlink transmission for the same message are performed by different eNBs.
      * In this case, uplink reception is performed by one eNB. But downlink transmission can be performed by different eNB(s) including the eNB which received the message.
## 4.3 Scenario 3
### 4.3.1 General description
This scenario supports V2V operation using both Uu and PC5.
NOTE: The study deprioritizes Scenario 3.
#### 4.3.1.1 Scenario 3A
_In this scenario, a UE transmits a V2X message to other UEs in sidelink. One
of the receiving UEs is a UE type RSU which receives the V2X message in
sidelink and transmits it to E-UTRAN in uplink. E-UTRAN receives the V2X
message from the UE type RSU and then transmits it to multiple UEs at a local
area in downlink._
_To support this scenario, E-UTRAN performs uplink reception and downlink
transmission of V2X messages. For downlink, E-UTRAN may use a broadcast
mechanism. It is FFS whether E-UTRAN also supports RSU function in this
scenario._

#### 4.3.1.2 Scenario 3B
_In this scenario, a UE transmits a V2X message to E-UTRAN in uplink and
E-UTRAN transmits it to one or more UE type RSUs. Then, the UE type RSU
transmits the V2X message to other UEs in sidelink._
_To support this scenario, E-UTRAN performs uplink reception and downlink
transmission of V2X messages. For downlink, E-UTRAN may use a broadcast
mechanism. It is FFS whether E-UTRAN also supports RSU function in this
scenario._

> For PC5:
  * Applying all the cases in the corresponding aspect of Scenario 1.

# 5 Technical support for V2V
## 5.1 PC5 interface
The design will be based on broadcast mechanism. No optimization is expected
for unicast case in this release.
### 5.1.1 Resource allocation
It is observed that Rel-13 sidelink resource allocation is not sufficient for
some of the scenarios for PC5-based V2V. Enhancements to Rel-13 sidelink
resource allocation are necessary for PC5-based V2V
#### 5.1.1.1 Resource pool
The resource allocation principles listed below should be studied for
PC5-based V2V (note that other schemes are not precluded):
  * Resource pool
    * The concept of resource pool is introduced at least for the > purpose of study.
      * Resource pool is a set of time/frequency resources where PC5 > transmission may occur. Note that Rel-12 D2D communication > mode 1 uses all the time/frequency resources as data pool.
      * FFS whether Rel-12 resource pool configuration is reused for > PC5-based V2V.
    * FFS the number of resource pools configured for a UE
      * The need for defining multiple resource pools should be > justified.
      * FFS whether the number of SA pools can be different from the > number of data pools and, if can, FFS whether multiple SA > pools can be associated with the same data pool.
The following resource allocation principles are deemed necessary for
PC5-based V2V:
  * Scheduling assignment
    * Each data transmission is scheduled by an SA. A UE knows at > least time and frequency location of data transmission(s) > after decoding the associated SA.
    * FFS the indication is implicit, explicit, or both
    * If SA and the associated data from a single transmitter is > transmitted in different subframes:
    * FFS details
    * If SA and the associated data from a single transmitter are > transmitted in the same subframe:
    * FFS whether it is possible to support the case where data transmission in a subframe occurs without associated SA transmitted in the same subframe
    * Alt 1: SA and Data are transmitted on separate physical channels (i.e., separated DFT precoding for SA and data):
      * RAN1 assumes that RAN4 will study the proper transmission characteristics (e.g, MPR) to support this.
      * FFS whether SA and data transmissions in the same subframe are always adjacent in the frequency domain.
      * In case of separate channels, study whether SA pool and data pool are orthogonal or can overlap.
    * Alt 2: A single DFT precoding applies to SA and data transmitted in the same subframe.
      * The whole bandwidth is divided into one or multiple sub-channels.
      * The transmission bandwidth of SA/data is fixed to the bandwidth of a single sub-channel.
    * Alt 3: SA and data are TDMed within one subframe.
      * The transmission bandwidth of SA is fixed.
    * Study the number of transmissions of a given TB
    * Study the number of transmissions of a given SA
    * FFS whether a single SA may schedule multiple TBs
    * FFS whether the time/frequency resources of a given SA is > independent of the time/frequency resources of the associated > data
#### 5.1.1.2 Resource control/selection mechanism
The resource allocation principles listed below should be studied for
PC5-based V2V (note that other schemes are not precluded):
  * Network control aspect
    * At least when a UE is inside coverage of an eNB on the carrier > where PC5 is performed (i.e., Uu and PC5 share the carrier), > the eNB controls at least some parameters that affects UE > resource selection.
    * When a UE operates PC5 in a carrier where no cell is detected > but it is inside coverage of an eNB in another carrier (i.e., > different carriers for Uu and PC5), network may control at > least some parameters that affects UE resource selection.
      * At least when the PC5 and Uu carriers are allocated to the > same operator, RAN1 assumes that eNB has at least some > controls. FFS for the other cases.
    * UE autonomous resource selection can be configured for a UE > inside network coverage.
    * eNB control above includes
      * Exact resources for transmission or set of resources for UE > autonomous selection
      * FFS: other parameters
  * Enhancement to resource selection/structure
    * Study which of the following principle(s) is(are) beneficial:
    * Collision avoidance
      * A UE identifies the resources that will be occupied and/or > collided by the other UEs and avoids a colliding resource > allocation for its transmission.
      * FFS
        * Details of the identification of the occupied and/or > collided resources, e.g., by reading other UEs' SA > and/or sensing the energy level
        * How to select the resources and MCS for transmission
        * Whether a UE performs the resource selection procedure > for every transmission, and if not, what triggers > reselection
          * FFS if the initial selection and reselection > procedures are the same or not
        * Whether signaling from eNB (e.g., information on the > resource load) or another UE is beneficial.
        * Whether resource in this context is in the physical > domain or the logical domain
    * Resource selection based on transmitter-specific information
      * Example 1: Resource allocation based on the location, > velocity, and/or direction of the transmitter and/or > distance between vehicles.
      * Example 2: A UE reports its observation on the radio > environment to help eNB scheduling
    * Enhanced resource randomization
      * Example is increasing the number of time resource patterns.
    * Introducing a finer time resource granularity and/or a coarser > frequency resource granularity
    * Semi-persistent scheduling from eNB for PC5 transmissions
    * Cross-carrier scheduling
      * eNB sends control via a carrier to schedule sidelink > resource in another carrier not associated with the > carrier used for the control transmission.
      * FFS in which scenario(s) this principle is beneficial
  * Differentiation of radio transmission characteristics based at least > on higher layer properties
    * FFS which other aspect(s) will also differentiate radio > transmission characteristics
    * FFS radio transmission characteristics
  * Transmission power control and/or setting
    * Use different transmission power e.g., depending on scenario
      * This includes the possibility of using zero power (i.e., > muting)
  * Resource allocation robust to temporal interruption due to, e.g., > handover, RLF, cell reselection
The following observations are made for resource control/selection mechanism:
  * For enhancement to UE autonomous resource selection, collision > avoidance based on sensing (P1), enhanced random resource > selection (P2), and location-based resource selection (P3) are > shown to provide gain when each of them is evaluated individually.
    * Further discussion is needed to identify whether operating a combination of the principles provides more gain than operating an individual principle.
    * It is understood that a combination of P1 and P2 is possible at least in the following example:
      * In resource selection, a UE by sensing excludes the resources that will be occupied by other UEs, and the enhanced random selection applies to the remaining resources.
    * It is understood that a combination of P1 and P3 is possible at least in the following example:
      * Subsets of resources are associated with sets of UE location, and a UE performs P1 in the subset which is associated with its current location.
    * It is understood that a combination of P2 and P3 is possible at least in the following example:
      * Subsets of resources are associated with sets of UE location, and a UE performs P2 in the subset which is associated with its current location.
    * Details FFS
  * RAN1 observes potential benefit of adapting transmitter behavior > from physical layer viewpoint:
    * It is noted that RAN1 has not evaluated the feasibility of any adaptation mechanism.
    * FFS
      * Which specific behavior is adapted
        * E.g., Reducing message transmission rate and/or dropping some messages
      * What the adaptation is based on
        * E.g., when the vehicle density is high
      * Whether service requirement can be adapted accordingly in some scenarios
  * RAN1 observes potential benefit of UE reporting its observation on > the radio environment of PC5 carrier and/or its location to help > eNB scheduling. However, the uplink signaling overhead, handover > issue, burden caused by the increased number of RRC_Connected UEs > have not been evaluated.
  * RAN1 observes potential benefit of increasing subcarrier spacing. > However, the impact of a smaller length of normal CP, ICI to/from > legacy channels, AGC, timing advance, potential change in the > inband emission have not been evaluated.
### 5.1.2 Handling high doppler case
It is observed that DMRS needs to be enhanced for PC5-based V2V.
SC-FDM is used for V2V transmission in each physical channel.
Enhancement at least includes:
  * Increase DMRS density to reduce time interval between DMRS sequences
  * Enhance DMRS structure to increase frequency offset compensation > range
Study at least the following DMRS structure:
  * Reuse PUSCH DMRS
  * Other options are not precluded, i.e.,
    * PUSCH DMRS with Comb (similar as structure of SRS)
    * New DMRS patterns spread over time and frequency, that may be > frequency multiplexed with DFT-precoded data at least in some > symbols
    * Increased subcarrier spacing
  * All options should solve any complexity and standardization impact > including analysis of frequency synchronization accuracy
Working assumption is to increase DMRS density to 4 symbols per 1ms with
reusing PUSCH DM RS sequence in each physical sidelink channel except for
PSBCH.
  * If RAN1 finds working assumption does not work, i.e. the performance > cannot meet requirements for PC5 V2V at least including > consideration on whether RAN1 working assumption of frequency > offset is confirmed, the first priority should be given to DMRS > structure with Comb (like SRS). There should be considerations on > receiver complexity when working assumption is confirmed.
  * Location of DM RS is FFS. Options of DM RS location (counting from > #0) for evaluation include the following for normal CP with 15 > kHz subcarrier spacing (other options are not precluded):
    * Option 1: #2, #5, #8, #11 (Note: This is for regular > spacing.)
    * Option 2: #1, #5, #8, #12 (Note: Reuse RS location of PUCCH > format 2.)
    * Option 3: #2, #4, #9, #11 (Note: Frequency offset estimation > first using {#2, #4} and {#9, #11})
    * Option 4: #3, #6, #7, #10 (Note: Frequency offset estimation > first using {#6, #7})
  * FFS the number and location of DMRS in PSBCH
### 5.1.3 Synchronization
GNSS or GNSS-equivalent is at the highest priority of synchronization source
for time and frequency when the vehicle UE[^1] directly receives GNSS or GNSS-
equivalent with sufficient reliability and the UE does not detect any cell in
any carrier.
eNB instructs vehicle UE to prioritize either eNB-based synchronization or
GNSS or GNSS-equivalent at least when the eNB is in the carrier where the
vehicle UE operates on PC5 V2V
Priority of GNSS or GNSS-equivalent for other cases needs further study
Priority of other synchronization source needs further study
  * Scenarios with there is no eNB coverage and GNSS or GNSS-equivalent > coverage need to be studied
    * RAN1 will not optimize only for this scenario
    * This scenario needs to be supported from the synchronization > perspective
RAN1 assumes that eNBs may not always have GNSS or GNSS-equivalent
  * Asynchronous network case should be supported.
Perspectives for further study:
  * eNB assistant information, e.g.
    * Timing offset to UTC
    * TA or eNB location
    * others
SLSS and PSBCH transmission of UE is supported for PC5 based V2V.
  * UE capability of SLSS transmission will be discussed later.
  * Rel. 12/13 physical format of SLSS/PSBCH is the starting point.
    * FFS number and location of PSBCH DM RS
    * FFS PSSS root index, SLSS ID
  * Rel. 12/13 sync procedure (e.g., sync reference priority) is the > starting point.
    * FFS PSBCH contents
    * "GNSS or GNSS-equivalent is at the highest priority of > synchronization source for time and frequency when the vehicle > UE directly receives GNSS or GNSS-equivalent with sufficient > reliability and the UE does not detect any cell in any > carrier."
      * RAN1 needs to study the impact of this existing agreement on Uu operation.
The following sync procedure should be supported:
\- Priority of synchronization source includes at least transmission timing
reference.
\- FFS whether there is any differentiation depending on whether eNB is
synchronized to GNSS in the corresponding SLSS transmissions
\- SLSS transmitted from out-coverage UE directly synchronized with GNSS or
GNSS equivalent with sufficient reliability is differentiated from SLSS_net
with in coverage indicator 1
  * _At least reuse priority order SLSS_net with in coverage indicator 1, SLSS_net with in coverage indicator 0, SLSS_oon_
    * _FFS: any new priorities can be defined if benefits are shown_
    * _FFS: Definition of SLSS_net, SLSS_oon_
    * _FFS: GNSS or GNSS_ equivalent priority
  * _Working assumption: Priority of_ SLSS transmitted from in-coverage UE directly synchronized with GNSS or GNSS equivalent with sufficient reliability _is the same as that of SLSS_net with in coverage indicator 1_
    * _FFS: SLSS transmitted from in-coverage UE using GNSS or GNSS equivalent is configured by eNB_
      * _FFS: whether the configured SLSS uses the same configuration as Rel-12 D2D SLSS or not_
    * _FFS: SLSS transmitted from in-coverage UE using GNSS or GNSS equivalent is taken from SLSS_net with in coverage indicator 1_
    * _FFS: Periodicity of synchronization resource_
  * _FFS: Criteria to select between signals received with the same priority (e.g., up to UE implementation)_
## 5.2 Uu interface
### 5.2.1 Downlink enhancements
The following technical areas are identified as potential enhancements to Uu
transport for V2V services:
  * The use of both MBSFN and SC-PTM is allowed.
  * Improvement of MBSFN/SC-PTM services on the basis of UE geographical location
```{=html}
``` \- It is assumed that the application/upper layer can provide the >
necessary location information for DL broadcast. An AS layer > mechanism is
not needed to assist the application server to > determine broadcasting area.
```{=html}
``` \- The need and solutions (if needed) to reduce MBSFN/SC-PTM latency can
be considered. Possible enhancements primarily targeting control plane (but
may be used for user plane) include:
```{=html}
``` \- For MBSFN: shorter MCCH modification period, repetition period, and >
shorter MCCH scheduling period (e.g. 10ms), and the use of > pre-configured
MRBs can be considered.
  * For SC-PTM: shorter SC-MCCH modification period and shorter > repetition period can be considered.
```{=html}
``` \- Impact of supporting inter-operator deployments
```{=html}
``` \- A UE is allowed to receive downlink broadcast of other operator.
```{=html}
``` \- Single TMGI across cell(s) or MBSFN area or per location TMGIs are
possible.
```{=html}
``` \- For SC-PTM, a single G-RNTI can be common across cells(s) to reduce >
the delay caused by mobility;
  * TMGI and G-RNTI are configurable by the network.
For DL multicast/broadcast, RAN1 has observed performance benefit with the
following enhancements:
  * Dynamic scheduling for multicast/broadcast transmissions
    * I.e., PDCCH-based scheduling of TBs associated to a TMGI
  * Semi-static scheduling for multicast/broadcast transmissions
  * Use of DM-RS based transmission scheme from multiple TPs including reception for idle UEs
    * This does not imply introduction of any new TM
  * DMRS-based single-cell multicast
  * PDSCH transmitted from multiple TPs
  * CRS based PDSCH/PDCCH transmitted from TP(s) that differ from the TP(s) transmitting the system information
  * DMRS based PDSCH/EPDCCH transmitted from different TP(s)
  * Use of normal CP
  * HARQ feedback
  * CSI feedback
  * FFS MIMO features
  * Note 1: Gain, complexity, and specification impact of each enhancement are expected to be different.
  * Note 2: some enhancements may be possible without spec impact.
  * Note 3: Network/UE complexity has not been studied in RAN1.
  * Note 4: some enhancement(s) listed above may assume some level of inter-TP coordination, which does not necessarily result in spec changes
  * Note 5: some enhancement(s) listed above may be based on contribution(s) from a limited number of company or companies
Some potential enhancements to DL multicast/broadcast listed above can be
implemented by supporting the following features:
> â€¢ Transmission using a single CP shorter than extended CP in the current
> MBSFN architecture for broadcast from multiple eNBs.
  * Baseline is normal CP, and this can be revisited considering the alignment of numerology being discussed in the eMBMS WI.
  * RAN1 assumes a certain level of network synchronization for multi-cell operations (RAN1 has no consensus on the need to specify additional network synchronization requirement for this). Such synchronization may be provided by the network implementation.
> â€¢ SC-PTM using normal CP with legacy transmission mode of SC-PTM
>
> â€¢ It is not intended to preclude the possibility of having HARQ and/or CSI
> feedback for SC-PTM and/or MBSFN transmissions by using the terminology "the
> current MBSFN architecture" and "legacy transmission mode of SC-PTM" above.
From RAN1 viewpoint, the following feature is beneficial:
  * UE identifies which broadcast transmissions (e.g., TMGI) are relevant to it, e.g., depending on the position of the UE.
Using geo-information report from RRC_Connected UEs may be beneficial for
downlink operation for V2X.
> â€¢ RAN1 assumes that the UE geo-information reporting mechanism specified for
> PC5-based V2V can be reused for this purpose.
In the event that HARQ feedback for DL multicast/broadcast transmissions were
to be introduced, at least in a single cell, two options are identified for
HARQ feedback resource allocation:
> â€¢ UE-common resource: Multiple UEs receiving the same DL multicast/broadcast
> transmission transmit HARQ feedback on the same resource.
>
> â€¢ UE-specific resource: Different UEs receiving the same DL
> multicast/broadcast transmission transmit HARQ feedback on different
> resources.
### 5.2.2 Uplink enhancements
It is observed in 8.2.2 that E-UTRAN may not meet the latency requirement for
Uu transport of V2V service when a long SR period (e.g. a longer than 10ms) is
used. Thus, if Uu transport of V2V service is used, UEs should be configured
with a shorter SR period such as 1ms or 10ms to meet the latency requirement
on V2V service. However, it is also observed in 8.1.2 that configuring PUCCH
SR resources with a short SR period such as 1ms or 10ms will increase
undesirable uplink overhead. Such uplink overhead might be severe,
particularly when a large number of vehicles exist in a cell e.g. in urban or
when Uu resources are shared with other services.
In addition, it is observed that CAM message generation can be dynamic in
terms of size, periodicity and timing. Such changes will result in
misalignment between UL SPS timing and CAM timing. There may be some
regularity in size and periodicity between different triggers.
To reduce uplink overhead, it is beneficial to use uplink Semi-Persistent
Scheduling (SPS). In order to avoid added latency in the UE of waiting for SPS
resources, the SPS period would have to be significantly shorter than the
latency requirement of 100ms. For most CAM and DENM periods, this would result
in a large amount of signaling overhead when (many) UEs need to signal to the
eNB each time they do not need to use the resource. Thus, it is desirable to
use a long SPS period e.g. between 100ms and 1 second for V2V service with
potential enhancements described below. In addition, there is no way for the
eNB to know the best SPS configuration for a given vehicle at any given time.
Thus, the UE may need to assist the eNB to properly control UL SPS operation.
Accordingly, the following enhancements to uplink SPS are identified as
potential solutions for V2V service:
  * At least 100ms and 1s SPS periodicities should be included.
  * Multiple SPS configurations with different parameters can be configured by eNB.
    * Which SPS configuration is being activated/deactivate can be signalled.
    * Two options are identified for multiple SPS configurations
      * Option 1: one active SPS at a time
      * Option 2: multiple SPS active at a time
    * SPS configuration and UE assistance information may be linked to one or more radio bearers.
  * UE assistance at least on periodicity and/or timing can be provided to eNB.
    * UE assistance can be configured by eNB.
    * UL SPS configuration is decided by eNB.
    * Triggering of UE assistance can be discussed as part of stage 3 work.
  * The UE can inform the network when SPS resources are not used, e.g. on control signaling
One or more of the enhancements listed above may be used simultaneously to
support SPS transmissions.
Note that we will down-prioritize the idle mode case for Uu based V2V.
Hereinafter, the solutions above are briefly described.
#### 5.2.1.1 Multiple SPS configurations
Multiple SPS configurations with different configuration parameters can be
configured by eNB in order to address message characteristics of V2V service
e.g. CAM, DENM and BSM, and support both V2V service and VoIP service.
For example, CAM messages are periodically generated with dynamically changed
periodicity between 1 second and 100ms. When CAM message generation time
changes e.g. from 1 second to 100ms, SPS resource allocation with one
periodicity e.g. 1 second does not match the changed CAM message generation
period. Considering dynamic CAM message generation in time, the eNB can
provide the UE with multiple SPS configurations covering different message
periodicities. In this case, it may be sufficient that only one SPS
configuration is active at a time.
In addition, BSM messages are periodically transmitted with 100ms periodicity.
However, the actual message size can vary in time. If the SPS resource grant
cannot accommodate a BSM message due to size variation, the UE may request
dynamic UL resource allocation. To avoid significant use of dynamic UL
resource allocation, the eNB may provide the UE with mulitple SPS
configurations covering different message sizes. In this case, it may be
sufficient that only one SPS configuration is active at a time.
Meanwhile, a vehicular UE may generate both CAM and DENM messages from time to
time. The vehicular UE may also make a phone call e.g a voice call while
generating messages for V2V service. Considering that CAM, DENM and a voice
call have different characteristics, the eNB can provide the UE with multiple
SPS configurations e.g. for CAM, DENM and voice call. In this case, it can be
further discussed in Stage 3 whether or not multiple SPS configurations can be
active at a time.
#### 5.2.1.2 UE assistance for SPS
After the eNB activates SPS by PDCCH addressed by SPS C-RNTI, SPS resource
grants occurs periodically. Since the eNB cannot know when the UE generates
the messages, the SPS resource grants allocated by eNB may not exactly match
the actual message generation time. Such mismatch between the actual message
generation time and SPS resource grant will cause lateny in V2V service.
Considering the strigent V2V requirement on latency of 100ms, the UE can
assist the eNB to ensure SPS grants are alligned with periodic message
transmission by triggering an SPS reactivation with timing change. As
illustrated in Figure 5-1, when the UE detects a significant mismatch between
the actual message generation time and SPS resource grant, the UE sends
assistance information about the timing change to the eNB. Upon receiving the
assistance information, the eNB may re-initiate SPS to change timing of SPS
resource allocation. It needs to be further discussed in Stage 3 how
assistance information is signalled to the eNB as well as related triggering
conditions.
In addition, if the UE can detect change of message periodicity, the UE may
send assistance information including the changed message peridocity to the
eNB. This assistance information can help the eNB activate a SPS configuration
when mulitple SPS configurations with different periodicities are configured
by the eNB.

Figure 5-1: Example of UE assistance for SPS with timing change of CAM
transmissions in UL
#### 5.2.1.3 UE informs eNB when SPS resources are not used
It is assumed that the UE and the eNB do not exactly know the CAM message
generation time and it is difficult for the eNB to allocate SPS resource
grants which exactly match with dynamic CAM message generation. Thus, the UE
may not use a certain SPS resource grant for transmission. To avoid SPS
resource grant wastage in V2V transmissions, the UE may inform the eNB when
SPS resources are not used.
Note that from RAN2 point of view, for UL SPS, it is not necessary to send an
indication to the eNB that an SPS grant will not be used. Therefore, the
working assumption on "the UE can indicate to the eNB that it does not intend
to transmit data before a transmission associated to an SPS configuration" is
not needed.
# 6 Technical support for V2I/N
## 6.1 PC5 interface
  * _At least the following aspects need to be discussed for PC5-based V2I_
    * _Evaluation results on potential V2V performance degradation if "I" transmits in the same carrier and if V2I performance can meet requirements to conclude observation on performances_
    * _Feasibility of reusing PC5-based V2V to V2I_
      * _To conclude which case needs further enhancements over PC5-based V2V_
    * _Note that V2I includes both directions_
The working assumption is that side-link physical layer design used for V2V is
used for V2I if side-link is used for V2I.
It is agreed that a common pool is used for V2X and I2X.
The design will be based on broadcast mechanism. No optimization is expected
for unicast case in this release.
## 6.2 Uu interface
The working assumption is that DL physical design used for V2V is used for I2V
if DL physical design is used for I2V, and UL physical design used for V2V is
used for V2I if UL physical design is used for V2I.
# 7 Technical support for V2P
Note that P2V (i.e., pedestrian UE transmission and vehicle UE reception) is
prioritized over V2P (i.e., vehicle UE transmission and pedestrian UE
reception) in the study.
## 7.1 PC5 interface
  * _At least the following aspects need to be discussed for PC5-based V2P_
    * _Evaluation results on potential V2V performance degradation if "P" transmits in the same carrier and if V2P performance can meet requirements to conclude observation on performances_
    * _Feasibility of reusing PC5-based V2V to V2P_
      * _To conclude which case needs further enhancements over PC5-based V2V_
    * _Power consumption for transmission or reception of "P"_
    * _Complexity of the UE supporting transmission of "P"_
    * _Note that V2P includes both directions_
For the purpose for P-UE TX to reduce the power consumption and UE complexity,
at least the followings are beneficial:
  * Random resource selection.
  * FFS Sensing operation during a limited time
Random resource selection for P2V transmission minimizes power consumption for
PC5-based V2P service and does not require UE to receive on PC5 carrier. Also,
random resource selection is able to meet the requirement of V2P services
including the PRR performance requirement.
Compared to random resource selection, sensing operation during a limited time
can improve the PRR performance with additional power consumption and the need
for UE reception on PC5 carrier.
Design used for PC5-V2V is used for P-UE reception of V-UE transmissions.
It needs to be further discussed in Stage 3 whether a separate pool is needed
for P2X or the common pool used for V2X and I2X can be also used for P2X.
The design will be based on broadcast mechanism. No optimization is expected
for unicast case in this release.
## 7.2 Uu interface
# 8 Architecture and high level procedures for V2X
## 8.1 Local breakout for V2X
An RSU may terminate the V2X packets, or forward the V2X packets to other
entities. This is done in the V2X application layer of the RSU. The handling
of V2X packet is transparent to the eNB. It is also transparent to the eNB
regarding whether the RSU has a local V2X server.
If the P-GW is close to the eNB, the backhaul delay can be significantly
reduced; local breakout seems beneficial in order to better fulfill the
stringent latency requirements of V2X services. This enables a more local
termination of V2X traffic instead of traversing the EPC.
The above may also provide additional flexibility for the location of the
local E-UTRAN V2X server: i.e. behind a L-GW (stand-alone or co-located with
the eNB), or in the eNB itself. In fact, if SIPTO\@LN is assumed to be
deployed, it may be fully possible to leave this to the specific deployment.
We could see the following use cases:
_1) V2X server, connected through SIPTO\@LN with stand-alone GW_ \-- Such a
V2X server could e.g. process data from an array of local sensors / cameras,
to distribute to all locally connected vehicle UEs. Connectivity would be
provided to all local eNBs identified by the same LHN ID. By appropriately
planning the LHN IDs with the V2X service areas, V2X services can be provided
to the appropriate location in the most optimal way. Thanks to the
characteristics of SIPTO\@LN with stand-alone GW, the connection to the server
would always be maintained at vehicle UE mobility within the LHN.
_2) V2X server, connected through SIPTO\@LN with co-located L-GW_ \-- Same as
above, but the connection is routed through a L-GW co-located in each eNB. In
this case, however, the connection of the vehicle UE to the server is taken
down during mobility and set up again through the L-GW in the target eNB after
handover has completed.
_3) V2X server co-located in the eNB_ \-- In this case all required
functionality is implemented in the eNB. An example of this could be e.g. a
physical road-side box containing the sensors (i.e. terminating all traffic
locally) and the RSU, which also handles the relevant connection to the
vehicle UEs. This can be seen as "collapsing" all the above logical nodes into
one physical node, even together with the V2X server.
When using SIPTO\@LN with stand-alone GW, the interface between the stand-
alone GW and the V2X Server is based on SGi. When using SIPTO\@LN with co-
located L-GW, the interface between the co-located L-GW and the V2X Server may
be an internal interface or SGi.
Given that V2X functionality provides road safety services to moving vehicle
UEs, option 1 (SIPTO\@LN with stand-alone GW) seems to be more appropriate
with respect to the other options, since it is the only one that maintains the
data connection through handovers.
Some further observations can be made.
  * Current SIPTO\@LN does not support dedicated bearers: only a single (default) bearer is supported, mainly due to the fact that there is no interface between the GW and the PCRF. The QoS of such a bearer, therefore, needs to meet the V2X service requirements.
  * For SIPTO\@LN with standalone GW, IP data session continuity can only be maintained if both source eNB and target eNB belong to the same Local Home Network. If the UE has no other PDN connection and it moves out of the Local Home Network, the MME detaches the UE.
On the first observation, it depends on SA2 whether using the newly defined
QCI for a default bearer is enough, or introducing support for dedicated
bearers is needed.
## 8.2 MBMS for V2X
### 8.2.1 Delivery of V2x messages via MBMS
In Scenario 2, V2x messages need to be broadcasted in the vicinity of the
originating vehicle UE. The originating vehicle UE sends its V2X messages over
the application layer to the V2x server. The messages include information on
the vehicle location (long, lat). The vehicle UE may also provide cell-related
information.
In a similar but simpler scenario, V2x messages are generated e.g. in the V2x
server or in road sensors, and distributed to vehicle UEs. In this case, there
is no need to take into account the position of the vehicle UE for the
distribution, and the messages can be delivered using MBSFN or SC-PTM (or even
unicast if feasible). This latter case seems less challenging.
#### 8.2.1.1 Architecture
For the delivery of V2X messages, the architecture shown below can be used.
{width="6.643055555555556in" height="3.00625in"}
Figure 8-1: Architecture for V2x message delivery through MBMS.
#### 8.2.1.2 Signalling flow
A high-level signaling flow is shown in Figure 8-2 below.
\- The mapping between TMGIs and V2x services should be known at the vehicle
UEs (e. g. by configuration, or by dedicated communication, etc.);
\- The V2x server should request and pre-establish the appropriate MBMS
bearer(s) to the appropriate eNBs; the MBMS session (MBSFN or SC-PTM) is
started in the appropriate area/cell(s);
\- The originating vehicle UE sends the V2x messages, including (lat, lon),
and possibly cell-related information, to the V2x server over Uu uplink;
\- The V2x server determines the target broadcast area considering the
positions of the vehicle UEs, possibly taking into account any cell-related
information transmitted by the vehicle UEs;
\- V2x traffic is sent to the vehicle UEs in the appropriate area.

Figure 8-2: V2x message distribution through pre-established MBMS bearers.
### 8.2.2 Support of small and variable areas in V2X
In V2V/V2I/V2P service, in most use cases, the V2X message may be broadcast in
a small range of areas. Such areas may change due to the movement of the
vehicle UE. For example, a vehicle UE may periodically broadcast a message
(CAM) including the vehicle dynamic status information (e.g. location, speed
and direction information) to its surrounding vehicles while moving, to assist
safety operations. It is expected that the surrounding vehicles within 300-500
meters range from the vehicle UE should be able to receive the V2X message.
The small and variable areas in V2X could be managed via MBSFN and/or SC-PTM.
#### 8.2.2.1 Issues
In order to support small and variable broadcast areas in V2X, following
issues should be investigated:
\- Issue 1: How to decide the V2X broadcast area. The assumption is the V2X
server can make the decision, e.g. based on the V2X message received from the
transmission UE. The broadcast area for a specific V2X message may cover one
or more cells.
\- Issue 2: How to transmit different V2X messages in different broadcast
areas, especially in overlapping areas. Different V2X messages may be
broadcasted on the same MBMS bearer in different broadcast areas. When the
MBMS Service Areas for V2X broadcast overlap, current MBMS cannot support
transmitting different content in the MBMS bearers with same TMGI in those
overlapping V2X broadcast areas.
#### 8.2.2.2 Solutions
##### 8.2.2.2.1 Solution for solving issue 1
The V2x server receives the location of the transmitting V2x UE, and taking
into account the V2x UE location decides on the most appropriate broadcast
area in which to start the MBMS session.
This solution relies on the V2x server implementation, thus its details are
out of scope of this TR.
##### 8.2.2.2.2 Solutions for solving issue 2
For solving issue 2, the following two solutions are given:
##### 8.2.2.2.2.1 Single TMGI based solution {#single-tmgi-based-solution .H6}
**Option 1: Solution with new ID to differentiate the flows with same TMGI**
For Uu based V2V as an example, when vehicles upload their V2V message to the
V2X server, as the message is expected to be received by the surrounding
vehicles within 300-500 meters range of the source vehicle, only one small
group of cells (may only include one cell or a list of cells) covering the
transmission range needs to broadcast the V2X messages. As shown in Figure
8-3, the Cell Group1 only needs to broadcast the information uploaded by the
red and green vehicles, Cell Group2 needs to broadcast the information
uploaded by the red, green and yellow vehicles, etc.
{width="4.376388888888889in" height="1.45625in"}
Figure 8-3: Uu based V2V transmission and reception
The existing flow id allows the network to provide different data in different
areas using same TMGI, but it does not support the overlapping area scenario.
For V2X, in order to provide different data in overlapping areas using same
TMGI, an x id is introduced in this solution, it is provided from the V2X
server and forward by the BM-SC, MBMS-GW and MME towards the E-UTRAN together
with a list of cells, to identify different data content with the same TMGI,
and this applies to both different areas and overlapping areas.
As shown in Figure below, after establishing multiple MBMS sessions with
different x ids of the same TMGI, the V2X server provides the data for each x
id to the network, and MBMS-GW sends the corresponding data of different x id
bearer to different multicast IP address. Note that the indicated broadcast
area for these sessions could be overlapped.
{width="6.514583333333333in" height="2.0097222222222224in"}
Figure 8-4
Upon receiving multiple MBMS Session Start Requests of the same TMGI but
different x id, the eNB joins multiple multicast addresses and get the
corresponding data. Note that the eNB needs to distinguish multiple x ids for
the same TMGI, combines the data of different x ids, and provides in the Uu
interface using the same TMGI.
{width="6.698611111111111in" height="3.292361111111111in"}
Figure 8-5
In this solution, the UEs will only need to listen to the same TMGI in the
network for the same V2X service, and the complex TMGI management is avoided.
**Option 2: Solution to use non-overlapped MBMS Service Areas**
Considering the transmission range for V2X packet is very small, e.g. 320m in
freeway scenario (TR 22.885), operator may configure small, non-overlapped
MBMS Service Areas for V2X, e.g. a MBMS Service Area only consists of two
eNBs. In the related MBMS Service Areas, it is possible to use the same TMGI
for a specific type of V2X packets. It is possible to reuse the existing
location dependent content transfer for the MBMS user service to distribute
the different set of V2X packets in different broadcast areas.
**Option 3: User plane enhancement solution**
In this solution, the V2X server pre-establishes an MBMS bearer with a
specific TMGI for a type of V2X service in a very large MBMS broadcast area.
The BM-SC decodes the V2X message and adds the broadcast area information in
the SYNC header. For example, the BM-SC decodes the CAM1 and generates the
MBMS packet 1 (i.e. SYNC PDU 1) including the CAM 1 received from the
transmitting vehicle UE(s), and the V2X broadcast area {cell 1,2,5,6,11,12,13}
in the SYCN header, etc., as shown in Figure 8-6. Then the BM-SC sends the
generated MBMS packets via the pre-established MBMS bearer to its downstream
entities (i.e. MBMS GW, eNB). When the MBMS packets arrive at the eNB, the eNB
decodes the new SYNC header to know the V2X broadcast area, and decides
whether to broadcast MBMS packets or not. This solution impact the BM-SC, the
eNB and the SYNC protocol.

##### 8.2.2.2.2.2 Multiple TMGIs based solution {#multiple-tmgis-based-
solution .H6}
This solution applies different TMGIs to the MBMS Service Areas when there is
overlap, in order to be able to transmit different V2X messages in different
overlapped broadcast areas.
##### 8.2.2.2.2.3 Solution evaluation {#solution-evaluation .H6}
In order to better understand the pros and cons on the two solutions above,
the comparison table is summarized in table 8-1.

### 8.2.3 Localized MBMS
In current MBMS system shown in Figure 8-1, the BM-SC, MBMS-GW and MME are
located in the Core Network. The backhaul delay between the BM-SC and the eNB
is non-negligible when calculating the end-to-end delay, especially when MBMS
is used to delivery downlink V2X packets in the V2X system. To minimize the
latency, it may be necessary to consider the following options:
\- To move the MBMS CN functions (e.g. BM-SC, MBMS-GW) close to the eNB, or
even collocated in the eNB.
\- To move the User Plane of MBMS CN functions (BM-SC, MBMS-GW) close to the
eNB, or even collocated in the eNB.
#### 8.2.3.1 Deployment options of localized MBMS based on implementation
In order to minimize V2x latency, different deployment options can be
considered. None of the options below seems to have any specification impact.
##### 8.2.3.1.1 Localized V2x server and MBMS -- Co-located with the eNB
In this case _the V2x server, BM-SC, and MBMS GW are all co-located in the
eNB_. V2x messages are delivered in the cells served by the hosting eNB: this
option seems particularly appropriate in conjunction with the distributed MCE
architecture, i.e. in case the hosting eNB also includes its own MCE. All UP
interfaces are internal, so V2x latency is the minimum possible. This option
is shown in Figure 8-7 below.
{width="6.510416666666667in" height="2.6041666666666665in"}
Figure 8-7: Localized V2x server and MBMS, co-located with the eNB.
##### 8.2.3.1.2 Localized V2x server and MBMS -- Not co-Located with the eNB
In this case _the V2x Server, BM-SC, and MBMS GW are all co-located, but_ not
_in the eNB_. This physical node may forward V2x traffic toward several eNBs,
and this seems to be an advantage over the previous option. This option is
shown in Figure 8-8 below.
{width="6.491666666666666in" height="2.9409722222222223in"}
Figure 8-8: Localized V2x server and MBMS, not co-located with the eNB.
##### 8.2.3.1.3 Issues for localized MBMS based on implementation
In the options above, operator deploys Localized MBMS including the functions
of BM-SC and MBMS-GW in the RAN for V2X service. The non-V2X MBMS service
still uses the BM-SC and MBMS-GW in the Core Network. The Localized MBMS has
the same functions as the macro BM-SC/MBMS-GW, e.g. service announcement
function, session and transmission function, IP multicast distribution, etc,
as defined in TS 23.246.
A UE may connect to multiple BM-SCs for authentication, service announcement,
etc. However, this is different to multiple BM-SCs deployment in the current
standard, which is used for load balancing purpose (TS 33.246). The current
standard does not support the UE to use the local BM-SC for V2X MBMS service,
and macro BM-SC for non-V2X MBMS services at the same time. The Service
announcement, bootstrapping, MBMS user service registration, etc. uses the BM-
SC server resolved by the FQDN. According to TS 23.003,
\- The service announcement FQDN is defined as
\"mbmsbs.mnc.mcc.pub.3gppnetwork.org\".
\- The BM-SC server FQDN is defined as mbms.mnc.mcc.3gppnetwork.org.
These FQDNs are unique per PLMN ID. It is not possible for UE to know both
local BM-SC and macro BM-SC via the FQDN, so the UE cannot connect to both
local BM-SC and macro BM-SC for service announcement, bootstrapping, MBMS User
Service Registration, etc. In addition, the UE or the UICC only stores one set
of keys per PLMN. It also has some issues for network sharing.
\- The RAN operator may not have a PLMN ID, so it is a big challenge for the
RAN operator to deploy a LME (e.g. allocate TMGI with PLMN ID).
\- For a Gateway Core Network (GWCN) network sharing, the CN operator may need
to open a new interface in order for the Local MBMS EPC to connect to the
BSF/HSS for MBMS User Service registration. The CN operator may have less
control on e.g. how to map the V2X service QoS to MBMS service QoS, how to set
ARP, etc.
The FQDN issue described above may be addressed by the V2X server redirecting
the UE to the most appropriate local BM-SC, given that the V2X server is
always aware of the UE location. For inter-PLMN cases, if the serving ECGI
information is available, the V2x server can also take into account the
serving PLMN ID contained in the ECGI when redirecting the UE to the
appropriate BM-SC. The change of local BM-SC may add additional delay to the
MBMS reception by the UEs. This may impact current SA/CT specifications.
#### 8.2.3.2 Options of localized user plane MBMS CN functions
##### 8.2.3.2.1 Localized V2x server and LME -- Co-located with the eNB
In this case the V2x server, Local MBMS Entity (LME) which includes User Plane
of MBMS CN functions (BM-SC and MBMS GW) are all co-located in the eNB. The
V2x messages are delivered in the cells served by the hosting eNB. All User
Plane interfaces are internal, so V2x latency is the minimum possible. This
option is shown in Figure 8-9 below.
{width="6.643055555555556in" height="3.0069444444444446in"}
Figure 8-9: Localized V2x server and UP MBMS CN, co-located with the eNB.
The function split of Control Plane of MBMS CN and the LME, if and how to
define an interface between them, as well as pros/cons of this solution, are
subject to SA2 discussion.
##### 8.2.3.2.2 Localized V2x server and LME -- Not co-Located with the eNB
In this case the V2x Server, Local MBMS Entity (LME) which includes User Plane
of MBMS CN functions (BM-SC and MBMS GW) are all co-located, but not in the
eNB. The V2X messages could be delivered in the cells served by several eNBs,
and this seems to be an advantage over the previous option. This option is
shown in Figure 8-10 below.
{width="6.643055555555556in" height="3.0069444444444446in"}

The function split of Control Plane of MBMS CN and the LME, if and how to
define an interface between them, as well as pros/cons of this solution, are
subject to SA2 discussion.
#### 8.2.3.3 V2x server deployment options
All the options presented in the previous sections only present one deployment
option for the V2x server. Where to deploy the V2x server (e.g. centralized
and/or localized) is out of the scope of this TR.
## 8.3 Multiple operator support in V2X
The following scenarios need to be supported for V2X:
  * Usage Scenario 1: Only Operator A have eNBs in a specific area. Operator A's eNB are shared with Operator B for all services including V2X.
> Operator A's eNB indicates the support for Operator B's PLMN ID in the SIB.
  * Usage Scenario 2: Only Operator A own the dedicated V2X spectrum in a specific area. Operator A's eNB are shared with Operator B only for V2X service.
> The V2X service may be provided via a PLMN ID dedicated for V2X service.
  * Usage Scenario 3: Both Operator A and B have eNBs in a specific area. V2X server distribute the V2X msg to both operators' network.
> One option is the V2X server connects to both operator's network, just like
> a normal service provider providing services to UEs from multiple operators.
> Or the UE listen to the MBMS of other operator(s).

The following observations are made from the performance results under the
agreed evaluation scenarios:
\- In freeway cases, the performance of PC5 interface with enhancements
exceeds or approaches 80% average PRR at 320m range.
\- In urban cases with 15 km/h, the performance of PC5 interface with
enhancements achieves average PRR 90% at 50m range.
\- In urban cases with 60 km/h speed, the performance of PC5 interface with
enhancements achieves about 60% average PRR at 150m range.
\- It is noted that evaluations in RAN1 used the geographical distance between
vehicles, and this can be shorter than the actual travelling distance between
vehicles which may be more relevant to the definition of the effective range
in [3]. Average PRR would be increased if the actual travelling distance is
used.
\- It is noted that some of the enhancements identified in Clause 5.1.1 are
not simulated in some sources.
\- It is noted that no system level calibration was performed.
### 9.1.2 Uu-based V2V
This clause summarizes the evaluation results of Uu transport for V2V
services.
The following observations are made based on the results of the latency
analysis in section 9.2.1 and the results of the capacity analysis in [17] for
the agreed evaluation scenarios:
  * Short SR/SPS periods (i.e. 1 and 10ms SR period, 10 and 40ms SPS period) increase UL overhead for V2V, particularly in Urban case with 15 km/h and in Freeway case with 70km/h where the number of vehicles is high.
```{=html}
``` \- With dynamic scheduling UL capacity can be met with 1ms SR, if 100% >
UL resources of a 10 Mhz carrier are available for V2V services.
  * For SPS with 10ms the UL capacity cannot be met and for 40ms it is > very challenging to meet.Given that we cannot assume 100% of the > resources are available for V2V services, some UL enhancements can > be considered.
```{=html}
``` \- If our assumption of 100ms periodicity is confirmed and if somehow SPS
can be aligned with the packet generation, then an SPS of 100ms can be used.
  * It is challenging to meet the DL capacity requirement for the Urban cases. We will study DL enhancements to improve the DL capacity.
```{=html}
``` \- Unicast cannot meet the capacity requirements for Urban cases and >
Freeway cases option 1.
  * We will focus on improvements to DL broadcast mechanisms.
```{=html}
``` \- Message drop rates increase for UEs with high speed due to high
handover failure rates particularly in Freeway cases with 140 km/h, and
consequently overall PRR performance is degraded.
Table 9.1-2 shows the average PRR in the range (n*20, (n+1)*20) m from
transmitters where n=15, 7, 2 for freeway case, urban case with 60 km/h
vehicle speed, and urban case with 15 km/h vehicle speed, respectively. _100
msec latency for message delivery is targeted in evaluations._ Details of the
evaluation assumptions and results of each source can be found in Annex C.

For Scenario 2, the control plane latency due to mobility for MBSFN and SC-PTM
is analyzed in Table 9.2-1 and Table 9.2-2 respectively.

Note: Considering that SC-RNTI is hard coded in specification, if the UE
continuously monitors the SC-RNTI PDCCH after cell change, the UE can acquire
the SC-MCCH transmissions before acquiring the SC-PTM SIB20, i.e. the control
plane latency due to mobility can be reduced to 50ms on average and 60ms in
the worst case.
SIB acquisition delay analyzed in Table 9.2-1 and Table 9.2-2 can be reduced
by UE implementation for idle mode UEs.
### 9.2.2 Observations
The following observations are made based on the results of the latency
analysis in section 9.2.1 for the agreed evaluation scenarios:
  * The latency requirements can be met for Scenario 1 (mode 1) when SR is set to 1ms or 10ms, the UE is in RRC CONNECTED and assuming mean value.
  * The latency requirements can be met for Scenario 2 using Unicast, MBSFN or SC-PTM for connected mode UEs assuming:
```{=html}
``` \- 20ms backhaul delay and no delays related to mobility
  * Short scheduling period (i.e. SR or SPS period - 1ms and 10ms)
  * For MBSFN the scheduling period set to 40ms
```{=html}
``` \- The latency requirements can be met for Scenario 2 using SC-PTM for
idle mode UEs assuming:
```{=html}
``` \- 20ms backhaul delay and no delays related to mobility
  * SR set to 1ms and 10ms
  * Scheduling period 10ms for mean and 1ms for max (see the definition > of mean and max in B.2.1)
```{=html}
``` \- Scenario 3 analysis is down-prioritized.
  * For SC-PTM, the control plane latency due to mobility may be a problem for per-location TMGI. Assuming that the UE can continuously monitor PDCCH after cell change, the control plane latency due to mobility can be further reduced when using common G-RNTI.
  * For MBSFN, the control plane latency due to mobility may be a problem for both common and per-location TMGI, especially in small size MBSFN areas.
## 9.3 Power consumption analysis
This section provides the power consumption analysis result for V2P services.
Reception of the paging and (WAN) synchronization only case can be considered
as a baseline for power consumption analysis for V2P services [29]. The paging
cycle of 1.28 seconds is assumed as shown in [4]. The power consumption occurs
from WAN synchronization, paging and sleep power during the paging cycle. The
equation and the analysis result for this baseline model is as follows:
**_[Baseline:]{.underline}_**
(WAN synchronization power + Paging power + Sleep power)/(Paging period)\ = (8
subframe*1 unit+1 subframe*1 unit+(1280-(1+8)) subframe*0.01 unit)/1280
subframe\ = 0.017 unit/subframe
In PC5-based V2P/P2V, it is observed that the scenario of P-UE TX to V-UE RX
is more battery efficient than the scenario of V-UE TX to P-UE RX. It is noted
that this observation is made based on evaluations from a limited number of
companies.
Figure 9.3-1 shows the result for PC5-based V2P for the two scenarios relative
to the baseline power consumption with and without GPS reception power; the
first scenario where V-UE is the transmitter (the left case of Figure 4-1(c))
and the second scenario where P-UE is the transmitter (the right case of
Figure 4-1(c)).

Figure 9.3-1: Power consumption in PC5-based V2P services
In Uu-based V2P/P2V, the multi-cell (7cell clustering) broadcast scheme is
assumed as shown in Figure 1 in [30] (i.e., a cell transmits message generated
in it in one subframe out of a set of 7 subframes, and it transmits messages
generated in neighboring cells in the remaining 6 subframes of the set). In
addition, each pedestrian UE knows which subframe is used for transmission of
messages generated in which cell. Then, a UE can determine in each subframe
whether one of the messages transmitted in the subframe potentially is
generated by a vehicle within the target range from it. If so, the UE attempts
to receive it, and goes to idle otherwise. As a result, the location of each
pedestrian UE determines how many subframes the UE needs to monitor, and this
is equal to the number of cells overlaps with the circle having the radius of
the target range.
Figure 9.3-2 shows an example of cell deployment and road grid. If the
reception coverage of P-UE is the 75m, the ratio of the region which requires
reception from 1, 2, 3 and more than 3 cell is about 12, 27, 60, and 0% of
total sidewalk, respectively.
For 100% usage of DL subframes, the average power consumption becomes 0.354
units/subframe (i.e. 0.354=(1*0124+2*0.273+3*0.604)/7) where the power
consumption becomes 1 units/subframe if the UE monitors all the subframes. It
can be generalized as "0.354*X units/subframe" where X is the portion of DL
subframes used for V2P transmissions. Table 9.3-1 and Figure 9.3-3 show the
ratio of V2P Rx power consumption to baseline power consumption, with
consideration for the portion of DL subframes used for V2P transmissions.

For Uu-based P2V Tx case, the power consumption depends on the scheduling
methods. Both dynamic (i.e. SR w/o BSR and SR w/ BSR) and semi-persistent
(i.e. SPS) scheduling methods can be considered. The baseline model for P2V
power consumption is same as V2P case as described above.
Basically, WAN synchronization is needed once per (P2V) data Tx (e.g. per 1
seconds). For P2V data Tx period of 1 seconds, the P-UE should receive 1/1.28
paging occasion in average. The power consumption occurs from WAN
synchronization, paging, SR / BSR Tx (for dynamic scheduling), UL grant
reception (for dynamic scheduling), P2V Tx, and sleep power during the P2V
data Tx period. The interval between SPS activation / deactivation is
different case by case and it can be assumed to be large enough compared to
the SPS periodicity. Hence, no DCI reception for SPS activation / deactivation
is assumed. Tx power for P-UE is assumed as 23dBm which is interpreted as 4
units in D2D power consumption model. The equations and the analysis results
for P2V Tx are as follows:
**_[P2V -- SR w/o BSR:]{.underline}_**
(WAN synchronization power + Paging power + SR Tx power + UL grant Rx power
(for data Tx) + Data Tx power + Sleep power)/(Data Tx period) + GPS power
= (8 subframe*1 unit + (1/1.28) subframe*1 unit + 1 subframe*4 unit + 1
subframe*1 unit + 1 subframe*4 unit + (1000-(8+1/1.28+1+1+1)) subframe*0.01
unit)/1000 subframe + 0.08 unit/subframe
= 0.0277+0.08 = 0.108 unit / subframe
**_[P2V -- SR w/ BSR:]{.underline}_**
(WAN synchronization power + Paging power + SR Tx power + UL grant Rx power
(for BSR) + BSR Tx power + UL grant Rx power (for data Tx) + Data Tx power +
Sleep power)/(Data Tx period) + GPS power
= (8 subframe*1 unit + (1/1.28) subframe*1 unit + 1 subframe*4 unit + 1
subframe*1 unit + 1 subframe*4 unit + 1 subframe*1 unit + 1 subframe*4 unit +
(1000-(8+1/1.28+1+1+1+1+1)) subframe*0.01 unit)/1000 subframe + 0.08
unit/subframe
= 0.0326+0.08 = 0.113 unit / subframe
**_[P2V -- SPS:]{.underline}_**
(WAN synchronization power + Paging power + Data Tx power + Sleep power)/(Data
Tx period) + GPS power
= (8 subframe*1 unit + (1/1.28) subframe*1 unit + 1 subframe*4 unit +
(1000-(8+1/1.28+1)) subframe*0.01 unit)/1000 subframe + 0.08 unit/subframe
= 0.0227+0.08 = 0.103 unit / subframe
For P-UE TX case, it can consider some additional wake-up (or monitoring time)
at the UE side around the actual TX subframe, e.g., to monitor whether eNB
sends additional UL grant for retransmission. Table 9.3-2 and Figure 9.3-4
show the ratio of P2V Tx power consumption to baseline power consumption, with
consideration for the additional monitoring time. It can be shown that the
power consumption is increased linearly as the monitoring time increases.
However, the message generation rate is rather low (e.g., 1Hz), the power
consumption of P2V with some reasonable monitoring time (e.g., up to 100ms) of
V2X message may be still lower than V2P with more than 40% of DL resource
usage.

# 10 Coexistence with DSRC/IEEE 802.11p in the same channel
\- RAN1 has discussed co-existence between DSRC and LTE-based ITS (sidelink)
for safety ITS. RAN1 believes that ITS systems are important and should
protect each other and in particular safety ITS.
\- Technology neutrality is essential in order to enable choice of most
suitable radio technology for each ITS service as well as to enable a
technology phasing in the future (e.g., towards 5G)
\- RAN1 believes that technology neutrality is enabled by describing common
coexistence rules that are followed by all potential ITS technologies. Such
rules may be specific for a certain region. RAN1 believes that the details of
the common coexistence rules are out of RAN1 scope and should be discussed in
relevant SDOs in each region.
\- For deployment of PC5-based LTE-V2V and 802.11p in the same geographical
area, the ideal option is when they use different frequency channels. Note
that co-deployment of both technologies is not likely to happen in all
regions.
\- RAN1 believes that other radio access technologies and LTE-based ITS
transmissions on sidelink can co-exist; some standardization and/or regulatory
actions need to be taken in other bodies in order to enable this.
\- The possible solutions identified by RAN1 for high level coexistence
approaches (long-term basis) between PC5 transport for V2V services and
DSRC/IEEE 802.11p services in the same channel are as follows:
\- Geo-location and database.
\- Time sharing between systems based on GNSS timing; this would require some
modifications to DSRC.
\- Sensing-based vacate/switching approaches with or without transmission of a
predetermined signal(s) (e.g. LTE-ITS preamble, SLSS)
\- Sensing with a predetermined signal(s) would require some modifications to
DSRC.
\- RAN1 has not conducted any system-level evaluations for these solutions,
although some link-level results have been provided for some solutions.
# 11 Conclusions
It is feasible to support V2V services based on LTE PC5 interface with
necessary enhancements. As identified, it is recommended to enhance at least
LTE sidelink resource allocation, physical layer structure, and
synchronization.
The RAN WGs concluded that it is feasible to support transport for V2V, V2I/N
and V2P services over Uu. The RAN WGs identified solutions to improve the
latency, capacity, and reliability performance of LTE Uu interface and
observed that UL enhancements to the SPS protocol and DL enhancement to
multicast/broadcast are beneficial from performance perspective. It is
recommended to support the following solutions identified in this TR for Uu-
based V2X:
\- Transmission using a single CP shorter than extended CP, with normal CP as
the baseline, with necessary additional study
\- HARQ feedback and retransmissions for SC-PTM and MBSFN, with necessary
additional study
\- Geo-information report from RRC_Connected UEs
\- No additional specification work is needed.
The RAN WGs concluded that it is feasible to support V2I and V2P services over
PC5. It is concluded that V2P services where P-UE sends V2X messages but not
receives V2X messages is substantially more power efficient than V2P services
where P-UE receives V2X messages from V-UEs. The RAN WGs identified that some
changes to the PC5 interface would be beneficial in terms of power consumption
and UE complexity in case of P2V transmissions. It is recommended to support
following solutions identified in this TR for PC5-based V2X:
\- Random resource selection for P-UEs potentially on the resource pool shared
with V-UE transmissions, with additional study on sensing operation during a
limited time for P-UEs
###### ### Annex A: Evaluation methodology
For PC5-based V2V, tradeoff between system and link level performance can be
studied. Assumption on the target link budget in link level is as follows:
\- 150 m in NLOS Urban case
\- 320 m in Freeway case
## A.1 System level simulation assumptions
For PC5-based V2V, the following general assumptions apply:
\- Each vehicle UE's reception is subject to the half duplex constraint.
For evaluation of DL broadcast/multicast for V2V, companies should clarify the
following in submitting results:
\- MCS setting with the reasoning why such a setting is used
\- Allowed buffering delay in eNB
\- Average number of vehicles in a cell
\- Amount of used resources and scheduling policy
### A.1.1 Evaluation scenarios
Two vehicle UE dropping cases are defined: Urban case and Freeway case. See
Section A.1.2 for the UE drop and mobility model in each case. Section A.1.2
also contains dropping model for pedestrian UEs. See Section A.1.4 for the
channel model in each case.
Macro eNB may or may not be deployed in the evaluations. If deployed, the
assumptions in Section A.1.3 should be used. If not, simple wrap around can be
used as long as it is aligned with the evaluation assumptions in this TR.
Section A.1.3 also contains RSU deployment model.
Details of evaluation scenarios are in Table A.1.1.-1.

### A.1.2 UE drop and mobility model
Vehicle UEs are dropped on the roads according to spatial Poisson process. The
vehicle density is determined by the assumption on the vehicle speed, and the
vehicle location should be updated every 100 ms in the simulation.
In Urban case, a vehicle changes its direction at the intersection as follows:
\- Go straight with probability 0.5
\- Turn left with probability 0.25
\- Turn right with probability 0.25
Details of vehicle UE drop and mobility model for each of Urban and Freeway
cases are in Table A.1.2-1. Figures A.1.2-1 and A.1.2-2 illustrate the road
configuration of the two cases.

Details of pedestrian UE drop and mobility model are as follows:
  * Urban case only
  * Pedestrian UE dropping using equally spaced along the sidewalk with a fixed inter-pedestrian X m dropped
    * Total number of pedestrian UEs is 500
    * Pedestrian UE is in the middle of the sidewalk
    * The inter-pedestrian UE distance (m) (i.e., X) is calculated by 'A/500', where 'A' is the total length of sidewalk where the pedestrian UEs are dropped under the assumption of 'N' road grids (i.e., '{(250m -- 17m) + (433m -- 17m)} * 2 * N'). For example, if the pedestrian UEs are dropped in '14' road grids, the inter-pedestrian UE distance (m) is '36.344'.
      * Companies should explain how many road grids (i.e., 'N") are assumed in the evaluation.
  * Pedestrian UE speed is 3 km/h

    * Reuse that for UE-UE in PC5 based V2V evaluation with antenna height at RSU changed to 5m
  * eNB type RSU
    * Reuse that for eNB-UE in PC5 V2V evaluation
For I2I channel model between two UE type RSUs, the V2V channel model with
antenna heights equal to 5 m is used.
Assumptions for channel model between a pedestrian UE and a vehicle UE are as
follows:
  * Reuse the vehicle-to-vehicle pathloss, fading, and shadowing models with the following modifications:
    * Pedestrian UE speed is 3 km/h
    * Location update is not modelled for pedestrian UE
    * Antenna height and gain of pedestrian UE are 1.5m, 0 dBi respectively
Assumptions for channel model between a pedestrian UE and eNode B are the same
as agreed V2N channel model.
### A.1.5 Traffic model
  * Traffic model for V2V
There are two traffic models used in evaluation: Periodic traffic case and
Event-triggered traffic case. Periodic **traffic case is mandatory. Event-
triggered traffic case can be evaluated optionally with or without Periodic
traffic.**
Every vehicle in the simulation generates messages according to the traffic
model.
For Periodic traffic, message generation periods are defined in the following
5 distinctive scenarios in Table A.1.5-1.
Table A. 1.5-1: Message generation period for periodic traffic
* * *
Index Vehicle dropping scenarios Absolute vehicle speed (km/h) **Message
generation period (ms)** 1 Freeway 140 100 2 Freeway 70 100 3 Urban 60 100 4
Urban 15 100 5 Urban 15 500
* * *
For Periodic traffic, working assumption of message size is that **one
300-byte message followed by four 190-byte messages, and the time instance of
300-byte size message generation is randomized among vehicles. Note that it is
allowed not to consider message size in calculating the performance metric.**
For Event-triggered traffic, **event arrival follows Poisson process with the
arrival rate X (up to company choice) per second for each vehicle. Once event
triggered, 6 messages are generated with space of 100ms. Working assumption of
message size for Event-trigger traffic at L1 is 800bytes.**
  * Traffic model for V2I
Details of traffic model for V2I are as follows:
  * V2I/I2V traffic model 1: Message generation frequency is the same as that of V2V. Latency requirement is 100 ms.
  * V2I/I2V traffic mode 2: Message generation frequency is 1 or 0.1 Hz. Latency requirement is > 100 ms (e.g., 1000 ms).
  * I2V traffic is generated per intersection for urban case
  * For the freeway case, I2V message generation points are "uniformly located with 100m spacing in the middle of the freeway ."
    * The location of I2V message generation point is the same as that of UE type RSU.
  * The message size is the same as that of V2V traffic model for V2I/I2V traffic model 1, and is fixed to 300 Bytes for V2I/I2V traffic model 2.
  * V2V message generation does not change from the existing model.
  * For model 1, a single message is generated at a vehicle both for V2V and V2I (i.e, no change in the traffic load).
  * For model 2, V2I message is additionally generated on top of the V2V message.
  * For communication range,
    * Half of that of V2V for I2V traffic model 1.
    * For I2V traffic model 2, company should provide the value of communication range assumed in the evaluation.
      * The communication range of I2V traffic model 2 should be larger than that of I2V traffic model 1.
```{=html}
``` \- Traffic model for V2P
Details of traffic model for V2P are as follows:
  * Traffic model for vehicle UE's transmission in case of V2P
    * The existing traffic model of V2V is reused.
  * Traffic model for pedestrian UE's transmission in case of P2V
    * The message size is fixed at 300 Bytes and transmission frequency is 1 Hz.
  * For V2P,
    * '100ms' latency requirement (i.e., Same as that defined in V2V)
  * For P2V,
    * Baseline: '100ms' latency requirement
When another value of latency requirement larger than 100ms (e.g., 1000ms) is
assumed in the evaluation, companies should explain it.
### A.1.6 Performance metric
For evaluation of proposed schemes for V2V, the following metric(s) shall be
considered.
  * Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) :
    * For one Tx packet, the PRR is calculated by X/Y, where Y is the number of UE/vehicles that located in the range (a, b) from the TX, and X is the number of UE/vehicles with successful reception among Y. CDF of PRR and the following average PRR are used in evaluation
      * CDF of PRR with a = 0, b = baseline of 320 meters for freeway and 150 meters for urban. Optionally, b = 50 meters for urban with 15 km/h vehicle speed[^5].
      * Average PRR, calculated as (X1+X2+X3....+Xn)/(Y1+Y2+Y3...+Yn) where n denotes the number of generated messages in simulation. with a = i*20 meters, b = (i+1)*20 meters for i=0, 1, ..., 25
  * FFS Packet Inter-Reception (PIR): time elapsed between two successive successful receptions of two different packets transmitted from node A to node B
Companies **should explain the amount of time and frequency resources used for
simulation.**
For evaluation of proposed schemes for V2I, the performance metric is the same
as that for V2V except for target communication range.
For evaluation of proposed schemes for V2P, the following metric(s) shall be
considered.
  * For pedestrian UE in case of V2P,
    * The power consumption model defined in [4] is used as an additional performance metric to evaluate the power consumption caused by the reception of pedestrian UE.
    * To evaluate the reception ratio of Vehicle UE's transmission packet, the existing performance metric of V2V (i.e., PRR) is reused with the following modifications.
      * PRR is calculated under the assumption that Vehicle UE's packet transmitted during the time when pedestrian UE sleeps is regarded as the failure of reception.
      * Target range for CDF of PRR and average PRR is the half of that defined in V2V.
    * FFS on whether/how to investigate the impact of bursty reception failure caused by sleep of pedestrian UE over consecutive subframes.
  * For vehicle UE and pedestrian UE in case of P2V
    * To evaluate the reception ratio of pedestrian UE's transmission packet, the existing performance metric of V2V (i.e., PRR) is reused with the following modifications.
      * Target range for CDF of PRR and average PRR is the half of that defined in V2V.
    * The power consumption model defined in [4] is used as an additional performance metric to evaluate the power consumption caused by the transmission of pedestrian UE.
## A.2 Link level simulation assumptions
For fast fading model in PC5-based V2V, channel model in Section A.2.1.2.1.2
in [4] is used.
Message sizes used in link level simulation for V2V are:
  * Baseline: 190, 300, 800 bytes
  * Other numbers are not precluded
Assumptions for evaluation of DM RS location is as follows:
  * Transmissions in a single TTI (i.e., no HARQ retransmission). It is encouraged to evaluate both SA and data.
    * Baseline: QPSK with coding rate of 0.5
    * Optional: QPSK with coding rate of 0.7, 16QAM with coding rate 0.5 (only for data)
    * Frequency error: Baseline is to evaluate both {Case 1+Case B} and {Case 2+Case A}. Other cases can be considered, e.g., based on RAN4 feedback.
      * Case 1: The extreme case should be assumed, i.e., +0.1 PPM for TX and -0.1 PPM for RX w.r.t. UE's sync reference.
        * Performance in Case 1 is to check whether the system can work in the extreme case.
      * Case 2: Frequency error in each UE is uniformly distributed [-0.1, 0.1] PPM w.r.t. UE's sync reference.
    * Frequency error between sync references of TX and RX:
      * Case A: 0 error (i.e., the same reference)
      * Case B: The extreme case should be assumed, i.e., +0.05 PPM for TX's reference and -0.05 PPM for RX's reference w.r.t. the absolute frequency.
  * Companies should describe the receiver algorithm of the evaluated options.

**SA assumption (e.g., SA overhead)** Control channel containing 30-bit SA is
transmitted in a PRB pair in a subframe before the corresponding data
transmissions [9] Control channel containing 30-bit SA (1 PRB pair) is
transmitted twice in the control pool before the corresponding data
transmissions in the data pool [9] Control channel containing 60-bit SA is
transmitted inband with the corresponding data within the same sub-channel(s)
SA overhead is not assumed SA overhead is not assumed The SA and the
associated data are transmitted in the same subframe and one SA occupies one
PRB. The SA and the associated data are transmitted in the same subframe and
one SA occupies one PRB.

It is further noted that resource allocation principles used by sources are
different and are summarized below:
1) Source 1: Collision avoidance based on sensing and location-based resource
selection [9]
2) Source 2: Control pool FDMed with data pool, random resource selection and
location-based resource selection [9]
3) Source 3:
    A.  \"Sensing based semi-persistent resource occupy\":
        i.  UE sensing available resource via energy measurement and SA
            decoding.
        ii. UE detect resource collision via energy measurement and
            broadcast it in SA.
        iii. Once selected from available resources, the resource is
             persistently occupied by UE, until been notified as
             collision by other UE(s).
        iv. See more detail in \[10\]
4) Source 4:
    A.  Collision avoidance:
        i.  Assuming UE enters NW one by one, and randomly selects a
            > subframe within a set of least interfered subframes, and
            > then selects the least interfered Freq. resource in the
            > subframe \[11\]
5) Source 5:
    A.  eNB scheduling with UE location information:
        i.  eNB schedules UE to a subframe such that the minimum
            > distance to other UEs assigned the same SF is largest, and
            > then selects Freq. resource in the same way \[11\]
6) Source 6: eNB randomly allocates sub-band resources which are not occupied
to UEs
7) Source 7: Choose resources randomly in time and frequency domain
8) Source 8: Location-based resource partitioning and random resource >
allocation. For location based subset of subframes are mapped to a > set of
locations. UEs within that set of location transmit only on > the subset of
the subframes. Within each subset of subframes > SA+DATA transmissions are
adjacent in frequency and occupy random > resources.

**SA assumption (e.g., SA overhead)** Control channel containing 30-bit SA is
transmitted in a PRB pair in a subframe before the corresponding data
transmissions [24] The SA and the associated data are transmitted in the same
subframe and one SA occupies one PRB. The SA and the associated data are
transmitted in the same subframe and one SA occupies one PRB. Control channel
containing 70-bit SA is transmitted in 2 PRB pair in a subframe of the
corresponding data transmissions The SA and associated data are transmitted in
the same subframe; SA and data pool are FDMed, 8 PRB for SA and 42 PRB for
data in Freq. domain The SA and associated data are transmitted in the same
subframe; SA and data pool are FDMed, 8 PRB for SA and 42 PRB for data in
Freq. domain The SA and associated data are transmitted in the same subframe;
SA and data pool are FDMed, 8 PRB for SA and 42 PRB for data in Freq. domain

###### ### Annex G: Details of latency analysis
## G.1 Scenarios for latency analysis
### G.1.1 Latency decomposition of scenarios
It is assumed that sidelink communication is utilized for PC5 transport in the
evaluation.
For V2V latency analysis, the overall latency of each scenario in section 4
can be decomposed into selective combination of the following latency
components:
  * **L-RRC** defined as the latency required for state transition from RRC_IDLE to RRC_CONNECTD and data bearer setup
    * This latency component addresses the time duration from the time UE starts RRC connection establishment to the time the UE has been configured with data bearer that is used to transport V2V messages.
  * **L-paging** defined as the latency required for reception of paging message
    * This latency component addresses the time duration from the time paging message is arrived at eNB and to the time the UE successfully receives the paging message.
  * **L-SL_config** defined as the latency required to configure sidelink configuration to a UE via dedicated signaling
    * This latency component addresses the time duration from the time UE sends SidelinkUEInformation for transmission resource request to the end time destination UE is configured with sidelink configuration via dedicated signaling.
  * **L-SL** defined as the latency of SL transport between two UEs
    * This latency component addresses the time duration from the time UE has a V2V message to send over sidelink to the end time destination UE successfully receives the V2V message.
  * **L-UL** defined as the latency of UL transport between UE and eNB
    * This latency component addresses the time duration from the time UE has a V2V message to send over UL to the time the eNB successfully receives the V2V message.
  * **L-DL_uc** defined as the latency of unicast DL transport between eNB and UE
    * This latency component addresses the time duration from the time eNB has V2V message to send and to the time the UE successfully receives the V2V message over unicast DL.
  * **L-DL_mbms** defined as the latency of MBMS transport between eNB and UE
    * This latency component addresses the time duration from the time eNB has V2V message to send and to the end time the UE successfully receives the V2V message over MBMS.
  * **L-DL_scptm** defined as the latency of SC-PTM transport between eNB and UE
    * This latency component addresses the time duration from the time eNB has V2V message to send and to the end time the UE successfully receives the V2V message over SC-PTM.
  * **L-NW_uc** defined as the latency of network processing in case of unicast transport for DL
    * This latency component addresses the time duration from the time of eNB reception of V2V message to the time the eNB is ready to transmit the V2V message over unicast DL.
Editor's note: In case the eNB that is supposed to transmit a concerned V2V
message is different from the eNB that received the V2V message, L-NW_uc needs
to consider the latency required for inter-eNB messaging. It is FFS whether
the inter-eNB V2V messaging should be in the scope of this latency analysis.
  * **L-NW_mbms** defined as the latency of network processing in case of MBMS transport for DL
    * This latency component addresses the time duration from the time of eNB reception of V2X message in UL to the time the eNB is ready to transmit the V2V message over MBMS DL.
  * **L-NW_scptm** defined as the latency of network processing in case of SC-PTM transport for DL
    * This latency component addresses the time duration from the time of eNB reception of V2X message in UL to the time the eNB is ready to transmit the V2V message over SC-PTM DL.
  * **L-RSU** defined as the latency of RSU(UE) processing
    * This latency component addresses the processing time at RSU side from the time the RSU successfully receives the V2V and the time the RSU is ready to transmit from upper layer point of view
With the latency decomposition, the end-to-end latency of each V2V scenario
can be calculated as follows, where the component with parentheses is
optional-present while component without parentheses is mandatory-present:
  * **Scenario 1)** (L-RRC + L-SL_config) + L-SL
  * **Scenario 2-1)** (L-RRC) + L-UL + L-NW_uc + (L-paging + L-RRC) + L-DL_uc
  * **Scenario 2-2)** (L-RRC) + L-UL + L-NW_mbms + L-DL_mbms
  * **Scenario 2-3)** (L-RRC) + L-UL + L-NW_scptm + L-DL_scptm
  * **Scenario 3a-1)** (L-RRC + L-SL_config) + L-SL + L-RSU + (L-RRC) + L-UL + L-NW_uc + (L-paging + L-RRC) + L-DL_uc
  * **Scenario 3a-2)** (L-RRC + L-SL_config) + L-SL + L-RSU + (L-RRC) + L-UL + L-NW_mbms + L-DL_mbms
  * **Scenario 3a-3)** (L-RRC + L-SL_config) + L-SL + L-RSU + (L-RRC) + L-UL + L-NW_scptm + L-DL_scptm
  * **Scenario 3b-1)** (L-RRC) + L-UL + L-NW_uc + (L-paging + L-RRC + L-SL_config) + L-DL_uc + L-RSU + L-SL
  * **Scenario 3b-2)** (L-RRC) + L-UL + L-NW_mbms + L-DL_mbms + L-RSU + (L-RRC + L-SL_config) + L-SL
  * **Scenario 3b-3)** (L-RRC) + L-UL + L-NW_scptm + L-DL_scptm + L-RSU + (L-RRC + L-SL_config) + L-SL

### G.2.2 Analysis of each component
#### G.2.2.1 L-RRC: RRC_IDLE to RRC_CONNECTD and data bearer setup
This latency component addresses the time duration from the time UE starts RRC
connection establishment to the time the UE is configured with data bearer
that is used to transport V2V message.
If UE is in RRC_IDLE, transmission or reception of V2V message via unicast
requires the UE to make a RRC connection and establish dedicated data bearer
to transport V2V message to/from network. Then the following latency component
needs to be additionally considered when calculating overall latency for each
scenario.
The latency of L-RRC is e presented in the following table.

###### ### Annex H: Traffic characteristics of CAM
The following section summarizes the traffic characteristics of CAM messages,
including the triggering, generation, and expected size of these messages.
According to [28], the CAM generation trigger conditions of a UE shall be as
follows:
1) The time elapsed since the last CAM generation is equal to or greater than
a DCC (decentralized congestion control) related interval (i.e. _T_GenCam_Dcc_
[28]) and one of the following conditions related to UE dynamics is given: the
distance between the current position of the UE and the position included in
the CAM previously transmitted by the UE exceeds 4 m; or the absolute
difference between the current heading of the UE and the heading included in
the CAM previously transmitted by the UE exceeds 4Â°; or the absolute
difference between the current speed of the UE and the speed included in the
CAM previously transmitted by the UE exceeds 0,5 m/s.
2) The time elapsed since the last CAM generation is equal to or greater than
the currently valid upper limit of the CAM generation interval (i.e.
_T_GenCam_ [28]) and equal to or greater than DCC related interval
_T_GenCam_Dcc_.
If one of the above two conditions is satisfied, a CAM shall be generated
immediately.
Besides, the CAM generation interval shall not be inferior to the lower limit
of 100 ms and shall not be superior to the upper limit of 1000 ms. The value
range of _T_GenCam_DCC_ shall be limited to 100 ms â‰¤ _T_GenCam_DCC_ â‰¤ 1000 ms.
The parameter _T_GenCam_ shall be set to the time elapsed since the last CAM
generation, if a CAM is triggered due to above condition 1). After triggering
a number of consecutive CAMs (i.e. _N_GenCam_ consecutive CAMs [28]) due to
condition 2), _T_GenCam_ shall be set to 1000 ms. The value of the parameter
_N_GenCam_ can be dynamically adjusted according to some environmental
conditions. The default and maximum value of _N_GenCam_ shall be 3.The
conditions for triggering the CAM generation shall be checked repeatedly every
_T_CheckCamGen_ which acts as the check period _. The check period
T_CheckCamGen_ shall be equal to or less than 100 ms.
With above CAM generation trigger conditions [28], the CAM characteristics are
captured as follows.
In scenarios with relative stable vehicle dynamics (e.g. highway), the main
trigger for CAM generation is the change of position, i.e. the distance
between the current position of the UE and the position included in the CAM
previously transmitted by the UE exceeds 4 m, and as such is the main factor
affecting the periodicity of the CAM. The triggering conditions of speed
change and heading change generate only a few CAMs occasionally, and mainly
influence the timing of the CAM traffic.
The period of the CAM typically changes when the vehicle's speed change
exceeds a range.
The period of the CAM remains unchanged and therefore the CAM can be regarded
as periodical with a certain periodicity when the vehicle is travelling at a
relatively stable speed within a certain range which depends on vehicle speed.
A speed change or heading change is likely to affect the timing offset of a
series of CAMs occasionally, and such timing offset change may lead to
misalignment between SPS timing and CAM timing which further results in the
risk of the V2X delay requirement not being satisfied.
In addition, the CAM message size is variable. The CAM message size is about
121 \~ 320 Bytes without certificate and about 230 \~ 429 Bytes with
certificate
