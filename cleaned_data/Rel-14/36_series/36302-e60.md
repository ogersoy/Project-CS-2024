# 5 Services and functions of the physical layer
## 5.1 General
The physical layer offers data transport services to higher layers.
The access to these services is through the use of transport channels via the
MAC sub-layer.
A transport block is defined as the data delivered by MAC layer to the
physical layer and vice versa. Transport blocks are delivered once every TTI.
## 5.2 Overview of L1 functions
The physical layer offers data transport services to higher layers. The access
to these services is through the use of a transport channel via the MAC sub-
layer. The physical layer is expected to perform the following functions in
order to provide the data transport service:
\- Error detection on the transport channel and indication to higher layers
\- FEC encoding/decoding of the transport channel
\- Hybrid ARQ soft-combining
\- Rate matching of the coded transport channel to physical channels
\- Mapping of the coded transport channel onto physical channels
\- Power weighting of physical channels
\- Modulation and demodulation of physical channels
\- Frequency and time synchronisation
\- Radio characteristics measurements and indication to higher layers
\- Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna processing
\- Transmit Diversity (TX diversity)
\- Beamforming
\- RF processing.
L1 functions are modelled for each transport channel in clauses 6.1, 6.2 and
6.3.
## 5.3 Void
# 6 Model of physical layer of the UE
The E-UTRA physical-layer model captures those characteristics of the E-UTRA
physical-layer that are relevant from the point-of-view of higher layers. More
specifically, the physical-layer model captures:
\- The structure of higher-layer data being passed down to or up from the
physical layer;
\- The means by which higher layers can configure the physical layer;
\- The different indications (error indications, channel-quality indications,
etc.) that are provided by the physical layer to higher layers;
\- Other (non-transport-channel-based) higher-layer peer-to-peer signalling
supported by the physical layer.
## 6.1 Uplink model
### 6.1.1 Uplink Shared Channel
The physical-layer model for Uplink Shared Channel transmission is described
based on the corresponding physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure
6.1.1-1. Processing steps that are relevant for the physical-layer model, e.g.
in the sense that they are configurable by higher layers, are highlighted in
blue. It should be noted that, in the cases of PUSCH and NPUSCH, the
scheduling decision is fully done at the network side. The uplink transmission
control in the UE then configures the uplink physical-layer processing, based
on uplink transport-format and resource-assignment information received on the
downlink.
**\- Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**
\- One transport block of dynamic size delivered to the physical layer once
every TTI.
**\- CRC and transport-block-error indication**
\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.
**\- FEC and rate _matching_**
\- Channel coding rate is implicitly given by the combination of transport
block size, modulation scheme and resource assignment;
\- Physical layer model support of HARQ: in case of Incremental Redundancy,
the corresponding Layer 2 Hybrid-ARQ process controls what redundancy version
is to be used for the physical layer transmission for each TTI.
**\- Interleaving**
\- No control of interleaving by higher layers.
**\- Data modulation**
\- Modulation scheme is decided by MAC Scheduler (QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, and
256QAM; for BL UEs or UEs in enhanced coverage, supported modulation schemes
are QPSK and 16QAM; for NB-IoT, supported modulation schemes are Pi/4-QPSK and
Pi/2-BPSK for single-tone allocation, and QPSK for multi-tone allocation).
**\- Mapping to physical resource**
\- L2-controlled resource assignment.
**\- Multi-antenna processing**
\- MAC Scheduler partly configures mapping from assigned resource blocks to
the available number of antenna ports.
**\- Support of L1 control signalling**
\- Transmission of ACK/NACK and CSI feedback related to DL data transmission
The model of Figure 6.1.1-1 also captures
\- Transport via physical layer of Hybrid-ARQ related information associated
with the PUSCH, to the peer HARQ process at the transmitter side;
\- Transport via physical layer of corresponding HARQ acknowledgements to
PUSCH transmitter side (except for NB-IoT UEs, BL UEs, and UEs in enhanced
coverage).
If a UE is configured with one or more SCells, the physical-layer-processing
chain in Figure 6.1.1-1 is repeated for every UL Serving Cell.
Figure 6.1.1-1: Physical-layer model for UL-SCH transmission
### 6.1.2 Random-access Channel
The physical-layer model for RACH transmission is characterized by a random
access burst that consists of a cyclic prefix, a preamble, and a guard time
during which nothing is transmitted.
The random access preambles are generated from Zadoff-Chu sequences with zero
correlation zone (ZC-ZCZ), generated from one or several root Zadoff-Chu
sequences. For NB-IoT, the random access preambles are generated from single-
subcarrier frequency-hopping symbol groups. A symbol group consists of a
cyclic prefix followed by five identical symbols, whose value is constant
across symbol groups during each NPRACH transmission.
## 6.2 Downlink model
### 6.2.1 Downlink-Shared Channel
The physical-layer model for Downlink Shared Channel transmission is described
based on the corresponding PDSCH or NPDSCH physical-layer-processing chain,
see Figure 6.2.1-1. Processing steps that are relevant for the physical-layer
model, e.g. in the sense that they are configurable by higher layers, are
highlighted in blue on the figure.
**\- Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**
\- N (up to two) transport blocks of dynamic size delivered to the physical
layer once every TTI.
**\- CRC and transport-block-error indication**
\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.
**\- FEC and rate _matching_**
\- Channel coding rate is implicitly given by the combination of transport
block size, modulation scheme and resource assignment;
\- Physical layer model support of HARQ: in case of Incremental Redundancy,
the corresponding Layer 2 Hybrid-ARQ process controls what redundancy version
is to be used for the physical layer transmission for each TTI.
**\- Data modulation**
\- Modulation scheme is decided by MAC Scheduler (QPSK, 16QAM, 64 QAM and
256QAM; for BL UEs or UEs in enhanced coverage, supported modulation schemes
are QPSK and 16QAM; for NB-IoT, only QPSK is supported).
**Multi-antenna processing**
\- MAC Scheduler partly configures mapping from modulated code words (for each
stream) to the available number of antenna ports.
**\- Mapping to physical resource**
\- L2-controlled resource assignment.
**\- Support of L1 control signalling**
\- Transmission of scheduler related control signals.
**\- Support for Hybrid-ARQ-related signalling**
The model of Figure 6.2.1-1 also captures:
\- Transport via physical layer of Hybrid-ARQ related information associated
with the PDSCH, to the peer HARQ process at the receiver side;
\- Transport via physical layer of corresponding HARQ acknowledgements to
PDSCH transmitter side.
If a UE is configured with one or more SCells, the physical-layer-processing
chain in Figure 6.2.1-1 is repeated for every DL Serving Cell.
NOTE: The signalling of transport-format and resource-allocation is not
captured in the physical-layer model. At the transmitter side, this
information can be directly derived from the configuration of the physical
layer. The physical layer then transports this information over the radio
interface to its peer physical layer, presumably multiplexed in one way or
another with the HARQ-related information. On the receiver side, this
information is, in contrast to the HARQ-related information, used directly
within the physical layer for PDSCH demodulation, decoding etc., without
passing through higher layers.
Figure 6.2.1-1: Physical-layer model for DL-SCH transmission
### 6.2.2 Broadcast Channel
The physical-layer model for BCH transmission is characterized by a fixed pre-
defined transport format. The TTI (repetition rate) of the BCH is 40 ms except
for NB-IoT and 640 ms for NB-IoT. The BCH physical-layer model is described
based on the corresponding BCH physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure
6.2.2-1:
\- **Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**
\- A single (fixed-size) transport block per TTI.
\- **CRC and transport-block-error indication**
\- Transport-block-error indication delivered to higher layers.
\- **FEC and rate _matching_**
\- Channel coding rate is implicitly given by the combination of transport
block size, modulation scheme and resource assignment;
\- No BCH Hybrid ARQ, i.e. no higher-layer control of redundancy version.
\- **Data modulation**
\- Fixed modulation scheme (QPSK), i.e. no higher-layer control.

Figure 6.2.2-1: Physical-layer model for BCH transmission
NOTE: For NB-IoT, the BCH transport block of 40 bits is truncated to 34 bits
by the NodeB when provided to the physical layer for BCH transmission. The BCH
transport block of 34 bits is padded to 40 bits when delivered by the UE
physical layer to the upper layer.
### 6.2.3 Paging Channel
The physical-layer model for PCH transmission is described based on the
corresponding PCH physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure 6.2.3-1.

sense that they are configurable by higher layers, are highlighted in blue on
the figure.

Figure 6.2.3-1: Physical-layer model for PCH transmission
### 6.2.4 Multicast Channel
The physical-layer model for MCH transmission is characterized by the support
for multi-cell reception at the UE (a.k.a. \"MBSFN\" transmission). This
implies that only semi-static configuration of the MCH transport format and
resource assignment is possible. The MCH physical-layer model is described
based on the corresponding MCH physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure
6.2.4-1. Processing steps that are relevant for the physical-layer model, e.g.
in the sense that they are configurable by higher layers, are highlighted in
blue.

## 6.3 Sidelink model
### 6.3.1 Sidelink Broadcast Channel
The physical-layer model for Sidelink Broadcast Channel transmission is
characterized by a fixed pre-defined transport format. The TTI (repetition
rate) of the SL-BCH not corresponding to V2X sidelink communication is 40ms
whereas the TTI (repetition rate) of the SL-BCH corresponding to V2X sidelink
communication is 160 ms, if a UE is configured to transmit on SL-BCH. The SL-
BCH physical-layer model is described based on the corresponding SL-BCH
physical-layer-processing chain, see Figure 6.3.1-1.
\- **Higher-layer data passed to/from the physical layer**
\- A single (fixed-size) transport block per TTI.

layer model is described based on the corresponding SL-DCH physical-layer-
processing chain, see Figure 6.3.2-1. Processing steps that are relevant for
the physical-layer model, e.g. in the sense that they are configurable by
higher layers, are highlighted in blue. It should be noted that, in case
scheduled resource allocation of SL-DCH, the scheduling decision is fully done
by network side. The sidelink transmission control in the UE configures the
sidelink physical-layer processing, based on sidelink transport-format and
resource-assignment information received on the downlink. In case UE
autonomous resource selection of SL-DCH, the scheduling decision is done by UE
side. The sidelink transmission control in the UE configures the sidelink
physical-layer processing, based on pre-defined sidelink transport-format and
UE randomly selected resource-assignment.

6.3.3-1. Processing steps that are relevant for the physical-layer model, e.g.
in the sense that they are configurable by higher layers, are highlighted in
blue on the figure. It should be noted that, in case of scheduled resource
allocation, the SL-SCH scheduling decision is done by network side. The
sidelink transmission control in the UE configures the sidelink physical-layer
processing, based on sidelink transport-format and resource-assignment
information received on the downlink. In case of UE autonomous resource
selection, the SL-SCH scheduling decision is done by UE side, and the MAC
scheduler in the UE configures the sidelink physical-layer processing, based
on the sidelink transport-format autonomously decided by the UE and
autonomously selected resource-assignment.

\- One transport block of dynamic size delivered to the physical layer once
every TTI.

configured.
\- **Mapping to physical resource**
\- L2-controlled resource assignment.
\- **Multi-antenna processing**
