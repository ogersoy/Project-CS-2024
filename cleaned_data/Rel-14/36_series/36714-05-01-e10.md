# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for 5DL/1UL Inter-band Carrier
Aggregation under Rel-14 timeframe. It covers both the UE and BS side. The
document is divided in two different parts:
\- General part: this part covers band combination independent aspects.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination
specific issues (i.e. one subclause defined per band combination)
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.
# 5 5 Band Carrier Aggregation with Single UL: General Part
As 5DL CA combinations have been studied in Rel-13, the identified general
issues in Rel-13 [3] also apply to Rel-14. This TR only captured the new
general issues if identified in Rel-14.

As shown in Table 6.1.2.1-2, second order intermodulation products may fall to
UL frequencies of Band 3, 4, 9, 10, 22, 24, 42 or 43. Third intermodulation
products may fall to UL frequencies of Band 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18,
19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 38 or 44. It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of
Band 8, Band8, Band 41, Band 41 and Band 41 should not share the same antenna
with Band 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 42, 43 or 44 BS receiver, unless the antenna
path meets very stringent third order PIM specification so that the PIM will
not cause Band 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24,

However, no harmonic issues were found due to operators' spectrum holdings.
Therefore, it is not necessary to introduce harmonic trap filter for this
specific combination.
### 6.1.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For the UE which supports CA_8B-41D, the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.1.3-1 and 6.1.3-2 respectively.

carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all for the constituent bands as
defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating in single carrier mode.
### 6.2.2 Co-existence studies
### 6.2.2.1 For the BS
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting the 5DL CA configurations of CA_39C_41D can be calculated as
shown in Table 6.2.2.1-1 below:

frequency limits (MHz) 1820 1980 2461 2725
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.2.2.1-1 that 2^nd^ order harmonics may fall into
BS receive band of band 43, two-tone 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into BS
receive band of band 12, 13, 14, 17, 27, 28, 44. 3^rd^ order IMD products may
fall to UL frequencies of Band 1, 2, 7, 22, 25, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38 or 42.
It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 39, Band 39, Band 41,
Band 41 and Band 41 should not share the same antenna with Band 1, 2, 7, 12,
13, 14, 17, 22, 25, 27, 28, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 42, 43 or 44 BS receiver,
unless the antenna path meets very stringent third order PIM specification so
that the PIM will not cause Band 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 22, 25, 27, 28, 33,
35, 36, 37, 38, 42, 43 or 44 BS receiver desensitization.
### 6.2.2.2 For the UE
For single UL non-simultaneous UE, the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic analysis for
B39 and B41 is done in the 2DL/1UL TR 36.851. None of the products falls into
the B39 or B41 UE receiving bands. For UE co-existence the single UL is
already considered for these bands in TS 36.101.
### 6.2.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For the UE which supports CA_39C-41D, the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are defined
for applicable bands in Table 6.2.3-1 and 6.2.3-2 respectively.

### 6.3.2 Co-existence studies
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic and IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting
CA_41C-42D or CA_41D-42C follow from those derived for the constituent 2DL and
3DL CA fall-back modes.
### 6.3.3 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.3.3-1 and 6.3.3-2 respectively.

### 6.11.1.2 Co-existence studies for CA_11-46
The harmonic frequencies are observed in table 6.11.1.2-1. Therefore we can
conclude that there is an issue on 4^th^ harmonic interference from Band 11 UL
to Band 46 DL. It was agreed not to apply HTF for this CA combination. How to
treat MSD requirements is FFS.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 11 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.11.1.2-2 below:
Table 6.11.1.2-2 Band 11 and Band 46 DL harmonics and IMD products

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.11.1.2-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 11 and Band 46 fall into the BS receive
band of Band 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS receive band
of Band 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS receive band of
Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45, 65, 66 and
68. Note that the calculation in table 6.11.1.2-2 (except the last row)
assumes the BS transmits the whole 20 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 11 and
Band 46 respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 20MHz and 80 MHz DL in Band 11 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.11.1.1-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 7, 11, 21, 30, 38, 40, 41 and 45 as
shown in the last row in table 6.11.1.2-2.
Considering spectrum allocation in each ITU region, Band 11 has been operated
only in Japan so far. Hence, coexistence with Band 7, 30, 38, 40, 43 and 45
could be out of scope.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 1 and 46 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order
PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the BS receiver
desensitisations in Band 11, 21 and 41.
### 6.11.1.3 ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB,c values
For the UE which supports CA_11A-46E the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.11.1.3-1 and 6.11.1.3-2 respectively.

### 6.11.1.4 REFSENS requirements
As observed in 6.11.1.2, 4th harmonic of Band 11 UL falls into Band 46. In
this case, the frequency gap to avoid MSD in Band 46 and the UL configuration
are specified as shown in table 6.11.1.4-1 and 6.11.1.4-2.

### 6.13.2 Co-existence studies for CA_1-46
The harmonic frequencies are observed in table 6.13.2-1. Therefore we can
conclude that there is an issue on 3^rd^ harmonic interference from Band 1 UL
to Band 46 DL.
**Table 6.13.2-1: Impact of UL/DL Harmonic Interference**

                                                                                                           **2^nd^ Harmonic**     **3^rd^ Harmonic**      **2^nd^ Harmonic**     **3^rd^ Harmonic**

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 1 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.13.2-2 below:
Table 6.13.2-2 Band 1 and Band 46 DL harmonics and IMD products

**BS DL carriers** **f1_low** **f1_high** **f2_low** **f2_high** DL frequency

2030 2250 5130 5945
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.13.2-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 1 and Band 46 fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 22, 42 and 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 45, 65 and 66. Note
that the calculation in table 6.13.2-2 (except the last row) assumes the BS
transmits the whole 60 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 1 and Band 46
respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 20MHz and 80 MHz DL in Band 1 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.13.1-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 6, 8, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24,
26, 27, 45, 65 and 66 as shown in the last row in table 6.13.2-2.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 1 and 46 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order
PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the BS receiver
desensitisations in Band 5, 6, 8, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 42, 43,
45, 65 and 66.
### 6.13.3 ∆TIB and ∆RIB values
For this combination, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ values are shown in table
6.13.3-1, and in table 6.13.3-2 assuming separate antenna architecture without
HTF:

### 6.13.4 MSD
As observed in 6.13.2, this CA configuration has 3rd harmonic issue from Band
1 to Band 46. Nevertheless, it was agreed not to apply HTF for this CA
combination in order to avoid additional insertion loss for the licensed band.
In this case, the frequency gap to avoid MSD in Band 46 and the UL
configuration are specified as shown in table 6.13.4-1 and 6.13.4-2.

### 6.14.2 Co-existence studies
The harmonic frequencies are observed in table 6.14.2-1. Therefore we can
conclude that there is an issue on 3^rd^ harmonic interference from Band 3 UL
to Band 46 DL.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 3 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.14.2-2 below:
Table 6.14.2-2 Band 3 and Band 46 DL harmonics and IMD products

**BS DL carriers** **f1_low** **f1_high** **f2_low** **f2_high** DL frequency

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.14.2-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 3 and Band 46 fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 22, 42 and 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33, 34,
35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,41, 45, 65 and 66. Note that the calculation in table
6.14.2-2 (except the last row) assumes the BS transmits the whole 60 and 775
MHz DL frequency of Band 3 and Band 46 respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 20MHz and 80 MHz DL in Band 3 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.14.1-2, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24,
25, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 45, 65 and 66 as shown in the last row in
table 6.14.2-2.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 3 and 46 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order
PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the BS receiver
desensitisations in Band 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33,
34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 45, 65 and 66.
### 6.14.3 ∆TIB and ∆RIB values
For this combination, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ values are shown in table
6.14.3-1, and in table 6.14.3-2, and in table 6.14.3-2 assuming separate
antenna architecture without HTF:

### 6.14.4 MSD
As observed in 6.14.2, this CA configuration has 3^rd^ harmonic issue from
Band 3 to Band 46. Nevertheless, it was agreed not to apply HTF for this CA
combination in order to avoid additional insertion loss for the licensed band.
In this case, the frequency gap to avoid MSD in Band 46 and the UL
configuration are specified as shown in table 6.14.4-1 and 6.14.4-2.

transmitting of Band 5 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.15.3-2 below:

It can be seen from table 6.15.3.1-1 that:
\- some 2nd order harmonics may fall into the BS receive band of Band 3, 4, 9,
10 and 66.
\- some 3rd order harmonics may fall into the BS receive band of Band 38 and
41.
\- some two-tone 3rd order IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of
Band 22, 42 and 43.
\- some three-tone 3rd order IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of
Band 5, 6, 8, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27 and 44 where the BS only transmits up to
10MHz and 80MHz DL in Band5 and Band 46 respectively,
It is recommended that Band 5 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with Band 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 38, 41,
42, 43, 44 and 66 BS receivers unless the antenna path meets very stringent
third order PIM specification so that the antenna PIM will not cause Band 3,
4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44 and 66 BS
receiver desensitization.
### 6.15.2.2 For the UE
Table 6.15.2.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
5 or Band 46 for UE. For 7^th^ harmonics, MSD analysis is provided in 6.15.4.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 19 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.21.2-2 below:
Table 6.21.2-2 Band 19 and Band 46 DL harmonics and IMD products

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.21.2-2 that some 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics
of the BS transmitting fall into the BS receive band of Band 3, 4, 9, 10, 41
and 66, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS receive band of Bands
5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 31, 42, 43,
44, 45 and 68. Note that the calculation in table 6.21.2-2 (except the last
row) assumes the BS transmits the whole 15 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 19
and Band 46 respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 80 MHz DL in Band 46 as stated in Table
6.21.1-2, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still fall into the BS receive band of
the Bands 5, 6, 8, 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 42, 43 and 44 as shown in the
last row in table 6.21.2-2.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 19 and 46 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order
PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the BS receiver
desensitisations in Band 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 41,
42, 43, 44 and 66.
### 6.21.3 ∆TIB and ∆RIB values
For this combination, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ values are shown in table
6.21.3-1, and in table 6.21.3-2, and in table 6.21.3-2 assuming separate
antenna architecture without HTF:

##### 6.21.4 MSD
As observed in 6.21.2, this CA configuration has no 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic
issue from Band 19 to Band 46. On the other hand, 7^th^ harmonic of Band 19
falls into Band 46. Nevertheless, HTF should not be applied for this CA
combination in order to avoid additional insertion loss for the licensed band.
In this case, the frequency gap to avoid MSD in Band 46 and the UL
configuration are specified as shown in table 6.21.4-1 and 6.21.4-2.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 21 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.22.2-2 below:
Table 6.22.2-2 Band 21 and Band 46 DL harmonics and IMD products

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.22.2-2 that the 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 21 and Band 46 fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS receive band
of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24,
25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45, 65, 66, 68 and
70. Note that the calculation in table 6.22.2-2 (except the last row) assumes
the BS transmits the whole 15 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 21 and Band 46
respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 15MHz and 80 MHz DL in Band 21 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.22.1-2, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 7, 11, 21, 30, 38, 40, 41 and 45 as
shown in the last row in table 6.22.2-2.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 21 and 46 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order
PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the BS receiver
desensitisations in Band 7, 11, 21, 30, 38, 40, 41, 43 and 45.
### 6.22.3 ∆TIB and ∆RIB values
For this combination, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ values are shown in table

### 6.22.4 MSD
As observed in 6.22.2, this CA configuration has no 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic
issue from Band 21 to Band 46. On the other hand, 4th harmonic of Band 21
falls into Band 46. Nevertheless, HTF should not be applied for this CA
combination in order to avoid additional insertion loss for the licensed band.
In this case, the frequency gap to avoid MSD in Band 46 and the UL
configuration are specified as shown in table 6.22.4-1 and 6.22.4-2.

### 6.23.2 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of CA_1A-5A-46D are
derived in the constituent 3DL and 2DL CAs, which have been already analysed
and captured into 3GPP TR 36.714-02-01 and TR 36.714-03-01.
### 6.23.3 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports CA_1A-5A-46D the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are defined
for applicable bands in Table 6.23.3-1 and 6.23.3-2 respectively. The ΔR~IB,c~
for Band 46 is not specified as it is considered already in REFSENS

### 6.27.2 Co-existence studies
#### 6.27.2.1 For the BS
The 2nd and 3rd order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 7 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.27.2.1-1 below:
Table 6.27.2.1-1: Band 7 and Band 46 DL harmonics and IMD products

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.27.3.1-1 that:
\- None of 2nd order harmonics may fall into the BS receive band.
\- None of 3rd order harmonics may fall into the BS receive band.
\- some two-tone 3rd order IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of
Band 7, 31, 38 and 41.
\- some three-tone 3rd order IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of
Band 7, 38 and 41 where the BS only transmits up to 20MHz and 80MHz DL in
Band7 and Band 46 respectively,
It is recommended that Band 7 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with Band 31, 38 and 41 BS receivers unless the antenna path meets
very stringent third order PIM specification so that the antenna PIM will not
cause Band 31, 38 and 41 BS receiver desensitization.
#### 6.27.2.2 For the UE
Table 6.27.2.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
7 or Band 46 for UE. It can be concluded that there is no harmonic issue in
this combination for UE.

### 6.27.3 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports CA_7A-46E the ΔT~IB,c~ is defined for applicable
bands in Table 6.27.3-1 assuming separate antenna architecture. The ΔR~IB,c~
is not specified as it is considered already in REFSENS requirements for this
combination.

### 6.27.4 REFSENS requirements
For the REFSENS of 5DL/1UL CA_7A-46E, the requirements are shown in table
6.27.4-1 with the uplink configuration in table 6.27.4-2. The MSD values
impact to Band 46 due to harmonics from transmission of licensed band are
captured from WF on MSD for Band 46[1] and shown in table 6.27.4-3.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 40 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.28.3-2 below:

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.28.3-2 that:
\- the 2nd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 22, 42 and
43.
\- the 3rd IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31,
33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, 65, 66, 68 and 70.
assuming (except the last row) the whole 100 MHz DL frequency of Band 40 and
the whole 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 46.
If the BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 20 MHz DL in Band 40 and 40MHz
DL in Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will still
fall into same BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20,
22, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 34, 38, 40, 42, 43, 44 and 68.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 5, 8, 13, 20, 22, 26, 28, 31, 40,
42, 43, 44 and 68 are possibly intended for use in the same geographical area
(country) as Bands 40 and 46. Therefore the Bands 5, 8, 13, 20, 22, 26, 28,
40, 42, 43, 44 and 68 shall be considered for IMD products.
It is recommended that Bands 40 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 5, 8, 13, 20, 22, 26, 28, 31, 40, 42, 43, 44 and 68
BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will not cause Bands5, 8, 13, 20, 22, 26,
28, 31, 40, 42, 43, 44 and 68 BS receiver desensitization.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 28 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in

It can be seen from table 6.29.3-2 that:
\- the 2nd harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 28 and 46 may fall into none
of the BS receive band of 3GPP
\- the 3rd harmonic may fall into BS receive band of Bands 30, 40
\- the 2nd IMD products may fall into none of the BS receive band of 3GPP
\- the 3rd IMD products may fall into BS receive Bands 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13,
14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 31, 42, 43, 44, 45, 68
Note that the calculation in table 6.29.3-2 (except the last row) assumes the
BS transmits the whole 45 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 28 and Band 46
respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 20 MHz and 80 MHz DL in Band 28 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.29.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19,
20, 26, 27, 28, 42, 43, 44, 68 as shown in the last row in table 6.29.3-2.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 26,
27, 43 and 45 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands
28 and 46. This leaves Bands 5, 8, 20, 21, 28, 31, 42, 44 and 68 to consider
for IMD products.
It is recommended that Bands 28 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 5, 8, 20, 21, 28, 31, 42, 44 and 68 BS receivers so
that the antenna PIM will not cause Bands 5, 8, 20, 21, 28, 31, 42, 44 and 68
BS receiver desensitization.
### 6.29.4 MSD
For this CA configuration, the 7^th^ and 8^th^ harmonic of Band 28 falls into
Band 46. Nevertheless, HTF should not be applied for this CA combination in
order to avoid additional insertion loss for the licensed band. In this case,
the frequency gap to avoid MSD in Band 46 and the UL configuration are
specified as shown in table 6.29.4-1 and 6.29.4-2.

NOTE 1: The requirements do not apply when there is at least one individual RE
within the uplink transmission bandwidth of the lower band for which the
transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission bandwidth of the
higher band and a range ∆F~HD~ above and below the edge of this downlink
transmission bandwidth. The value ∆F~HD~ depends on the E-UTRA configuration:
∆F~HD~ = **[15] MHz** **for CA_xA-46C (x=1, 2, 3, and 4) and for: CA_46C-66A,
CA_46D-66A, CA_46E-66A, CA_46A-46C-66A, for 3^rd^ harmonic.** FFS MHz for the
other configurations listed.

### 6.39.4 MSD
#### 6.39.4.1 Band 3 MSD caused by Band 1 Tx
Since the MSD requirement is already specified for CA_1A-3A in the current
specification, it is also reasonable for CA_1A-3A-21A-42C to define the
requirement based on the same principle.

### 6.40.2 Co-existence studies
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic and IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting
CA_1A-3A-28A-42C follow from those derived for the constituent 2DL and 3DL CA
fall-back modes.
### 6.40.3 ∆TIB and ∆RIB values
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.40.3-1 and 6.40.3-2 respectively.

### 6.40.4 MSD
#### 6.40.4.1 Band 3 MSD caused by Band 1 Tx
Since the MSD requirement is already specified for CA_1A-3A in the current
specification, it is also reasonable for CA_1A-3A-28A-42C to define the
requirement based on the same principle.

#### 6.40.4.2 Band 42 MSD caused by Band 3 Tx
Since the MSD requirement is already specified for CA_3A-42A in the current
specification, it is also reasonable for CA_1A-3A-28A-42C to define the
requirement based on the same principle.

Taking actual spectrum holding into account, the MSD requirement for
CA_21A-28A was specified as N/A in the TS 36.101. Thus, it is also reasonable
for CA_1A-21A-28A-42C to define the requirement based on the same principle.

#### 6.41.4.3 Band 42 MSD caused by Band 3 Tx
Since the MSD requirement is already specified for CA_3A-42A in the current
specification, it is also reasonable for CA_1A-3A-28A-42C to define the
requirement based on the same principle.

### 6.42.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.42.3-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band 1
or Band 46 for both UL and DL. It can be seen that the harmonic frequencies of
Band 1 and Band 46 in DL are away from the BS receive bands of interest in the
UL. For the UE aspect, the 3^rd^ UL harmonic of Band 1 carrier may fall into
the UE receive Band 46.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 1 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.42.3-2 below:

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.42.3-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 1 and Band 46 fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 22, 42 and 43, while some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 45, 65, 66 and 70.
Note that the calculation in table 6.42.3-2 (except the last row) assumes the
BS transmits the whole 60 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 1 and Band 46
respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 20 MHz and 80 MHz DL in Band 1 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.42.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 6, 8, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24,
26, 27, 45 and 70 as shown in the last row in table 6.42.3-2.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 2, 4, 6, 10, 23, 24, 25, 27, 30, 33
34, 35, 36, 37, 45, 66 and 70 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 1 and 46. Hence Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19,
20, 21, 26, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 65 may create IMD issues.
In consequence it is recommended that Bands 1 and 46 BS transmitters do not
share the same antenna with Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26,
38, 39, 40, 41 and 65 BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will not cause
Bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 65 BS
receiver desensitization.

For four simultaneous DL and one UL the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB~ values are shown
in table 6.42.4-1, and in table 6.42.4-2:

### 6.42.5 MSD
As observed in 6.42.3, this CA configuration has 3rd harmonic issue from Band
1 to Band 46. Nevertheless, it was agreed not to apply HTF for this CA
combination in order to avoid additional insertion loss for the licensed band.
In this case, the frequency gap to avoid MSD in Band 46 and the UL
configuration are specified as shown in table 6.42.5-1 and 6.42.5-2.

It can be seen from table 6.43.3-2 that some 2^nd^ IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 3 and Band 46 fall into the BS receive

25, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39 , 40, 45, 65, 66 and 70 as shown in the last
row in table 6.43.3-2.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 2, 4, 9, 10, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33,
34, 35, 36, 37, 45, 66 and 70 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 3 and 46. Hence Bands 1, 3, 7, 11, 21, 38, 39, 40,
41 and 65 may create IMD issues.
In consequence it is recommended that Bands 3 and 46 BS transmitters do not
share the same antenna with Bands 1, 3, 7, 11, 21, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 65 BS
receivers so that the antenna PIM will not cause Bands 1, 3, 7, 11, 21, 38,
39, 40, 41 and 65 BS receiver desensitization.

### 6.44.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.44.3-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band 5
or Band 46 for both UL and DL. It can be seen that the harmonic frequencies of
Band 5 and Band 46 in DL are away from the BS receive bands of interest in the
UL. For the UE aspect, the UL harmonic frequencies of Band 5 and Band 46 does
not locate within the UE receive bands of interest in the DL. Therefore it can
be concluded that there is no issue on harmonic interference.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 5 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.44.3-2 below:

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.44.3.1-1 that some 2^nd^ order harmonics may fall
into the BS receive band of Band 3, 4, 9, 10 and 66, while some 3^rd^ order
harmonics may fall into the BS receive band of Band 38 and 41\. Some 3^rd^ IMD
products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 5 and Band 46
fall into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 31, 42, 43, 44, 45 and 68. Note that the
calculation in table 6.44.3-2 (except the last row) assumes the BS transmits
the whole 25 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 5 and Band 46 respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 10 MHz and 80 MHz DL in Band 5 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.44.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 6, 8, 14, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26,
27, 42, 43 and 44.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 24, 27, 31, 45 and 68 are not intended for use in the same geographical
area as Bands 5 and 46. Hence Bands 5, 8, 26, 28, 42, 43 and 44 may create IMD
issues.
In consequence it is recommended that Bands 5 and 46 BS transmitters do not
share the same antenna with Bands 5, 8, 26, 28, 42, 43 and 44 BS receivers so
that the antenna PIM will not cause Bands 5, 8, 26, 28, 42, 43 and 44 BS
receiver desensitization.

the constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating
in single carrier mode.

### 6.61.2 Co-existence studies
Table 6.x.2-1 gives the intermodulation products for CA_8A-46E only consider
the maximum bandwidth supported by CA_8A-46E, which is 10MHz for Band 8 and
80MHz for Band 46. The UL/DL harmonic products and the other intermodulation
products can be referred to fall back mode such as CA_8A-46A, included in TR
36.714-02-01.
Table 6.61.2-1: 5DLs CA of Band 8, Band 46, Band 46, Band 46 and Band 46 IMD
products frequency limits
* * *
DL frequency f1_low f1_high f2_low f2_high 925 960 5150 5925 3^rd^ order IMD
products (with maximum channel bandwidth) \|f1_low -- max BW f2\| \|f1_high +
max BW f2\| \|f2_low -- max BW f1\| \|f2_high + max BW f1\| IMD frequency
limits (MHz) 845 1040 5140 5935
* * *
It can be seen from the table 6.61.2-1 that the 3rd order IMD products are
only fall into the BS receive of Bands 5, 8, 20 and 26. It should be noted
that Band 26 is not intended for use in the same geographic area with Band 8.
Thus only the influence for Bands 5, 8 and 20 will be considered.
It is recommended that Bands 8 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 5, 8 and 20 BS receivers so that the antenna PIM
will not cause Bands 5, 8 and 20 receiver desensitization.
### 6.61.3 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports CA_8A-46E the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.61.3-1 and 6.61.3-2 respectively assuming separate
antenna architecture.

the constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating

### 6.64.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 40, Band
46, Band 46, Band 46 and Band 46 DL carriers (i.e. 5DL CA with one component
carrier in each band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.64.3-1 below:

frequency limits (MHz) 2220 2480 5130 5945
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.64.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, if the
BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 20MHz DL in Band 40 and 80MHz DL in
Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will fall into same
BS receive band of Bands 30 and 40. In addition, it should be noted that Band
30 is not intended for use in the same geographical area (country) as Bands 40
and 46. This leaves Band 40 to consider for IMD products.
In addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD products from the constituent
2DL CA configurations, it is recommended that Bands 40 and 46 BS transmitters
do not share the same antenna with bands of Band 40 BS receiver so that the
antenna PIM will not cause Band 40 BS receiver desensitization.
### 6.64.4 ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB,c values
For the UE which supports CA_40A-46E the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.64.4-1 and 6.64.4-2 respectively assuming separate
antenna architecture without HTF:

BS receive band of Bands 30 and 40. In addition, it should be noted that Band
30 is not intended for use in the same geographical area (country) as Bands 40
and 46. This leaves Band 40 to consider for IMD products.
In addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD products from the constituent
2DL CA configurations, it is recommended that Bands 40 and 46 BS transmitters
do not share the same antenna with bands of Band 40 BS receiver so that the
antenna PIM will not cause Band 40 BS receiver desensitization.

applicable bands in Table 6.65.4-1 and 6.65.4-2 respectively assuming separate
antenna architecture without HTF:

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating
in single carrier mode.
### 6.66.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 40, Band
40, Band 40, Band 46 and Band 46 DL carriers (i.e. 5DL CA with one component
carrier in each band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.66.3-1 below:
Table 6.66.3-1: Band 40, Band 40, Band 40, Band 46 and Band 46 DL 3^rd^ order
IMD products

frequency limits (MHz) 2260 2440 5090 5985
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.66.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, if the
BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 60MHz DL in Band 40 and 40MHz DL in
Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will fall into same
BS receive band of Bands 30 and 40. In addition, it should be noted that Band
30 is not intended for use in the same geographical area (country) as Bands 40
and 46. This leaves Band 40 to consider for IMD products.
In addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD products from the constituent
2DL CA configurations, it is recommended that Bands 40 and 46 BS transmitters
do not share the same antenna with bands of Band 40 BS receiver so that the

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating
in single carrier mode.
### 6.70.3 Co-existence studies
#### 6.70.3.1 For the UE
For single UL the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic analysis for B3, B7 and B8 is
already done in the 3DL/1UL TR 36.853-12. As shown in Table 6.70.3.1-1, it can
been seen that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics of Band 8 will fall into
Band 3 and Band 7 DL respectively, 2^nd^ harmonics of Band 8 fall into Band 3
for 902-915MHz and 3^rd^ harmonics of Band 8 fall into Band 7 for 880-896MHz.
Note that for channels of Band 8 overlapping the range 896-902MHz,
desensitization may occur in both Band 3 and Band 7 DL simultaneously.
Same as mentioned in 7A-7A-8A CA (TR 36.714-03-01 section 6.38.3.2), so far at
least one operator's spectrum holdings will face the harmonic issue between
Band 7 and Band 8 in region 3, HTF or other RF architecture should be
considered to mitigate the impact of the self-interference for this
combination.

#### 6.70.3.2 For the BS
The 3^rd^ IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of CA_3A-3A-7A-7A-8A
are derived in the constituent 3DL CA_3A-3A-7A, CA_3A-7A-7A, CA_7A-7A-8A,
CA_3A-7A-8A, CA_3A-3A-8A which have been already analysed and captured in TR
36.714-03-01 and TR 36.853-13.
### 6.70.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports CA_3A-3A-7A-7A-8A the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are
defined for applicable bands in Table 6.70.4-1 and 6.70.4-2 respectively.
Table 6.70.4-1: ΔT~IB,c~ for 5DL aggregation
* * *
**Inter-band CA Configuration** **E-UTRA Band** **ΔT~IB,c~ [dB]**
CA_3A-3A-7A-7A-8A 3 0.5 7 0.5 8 0.6

**Inter-band CA Configuration** **E-UTRA Band** **ΔR~IB,c~ [dB]**
CA_3A-3A-7A-7A-8A 3 0 7 0 8 0.2
* * *
Note that for the UE which supports CA_3A-3A-7A-7A-8A, the minimum
requirements for reference sensitivity of the CA_3A-3A and CA_7A-7A with one
uplink carrier and two downlink sub-blocks are increased by amount of ∆R~IBNC~
in TS 36.101 Table 7.3.1A-3 and ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 6.70.4-2 for the SCC.
### 6.70.5 REFSENS requirements
The exceptions for CA_3A-3A-7A-7A-8A follow from the CA_3A-7A-8A, the REFSENS
requirement specified for the self-interference situation are shown in table
6.70.5-1 with the uplink configuration in table 6.70.5-2.

It can be seen from Table 6.72.2-1 that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics of Band
3 and Band 40 DL carriers may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 43 and
48, and the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1,
2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 25, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 45, 65, 66 and 70.
Since Bands 1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 11, 21, 25, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, 45, 48, 65, 66 and
70 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 3 and 40;
the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 3, 39, 40
and 43. As B40 is a TDD band, simultaneous Tx/Rx for the same band will not
happen. So the IMD impact to B40 needs not to be considered.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre‑distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Bands 3, 39 or 43
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 3 and 40 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 3, Band 39 and Band 43 BS
receiver. If B39 and B40 or Band 43 and Band 40 are synchronized then the
restrictions for B39 and Band 43 do not exist.
And it is recommended that Bands 3 and 40 BS transmitters should not share the
same antenna with Band 3, 39 or 43 BS receivers, unless the antenna path meets
very stringent 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will
not cause Band 3, 39 or 43 BS receivers desensitization. If B39 and B40 or
Band 43 and Band 40 are synchronized then the restrictions for B39 and Band 43
don\'t exist. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art
continues to evolve in the future.

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating
in single carrier mode.
### 6.79.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.79.3-1 only give the intermodulation products for CA_39A-40E by
considering the maximum bandwidth supported by CA_39A-40E, which is 20MHz for
Band 39 and 80MHz for Band 40. The UL/DL harmonic products and the other
intermodulation products can be referred to fall back mode such as CA_39A-40A,
included in TR 36.714-02-01.
Table 6.79.3-1: Band 39 and Band 40 DL harmonics products frequency limits

**DL frequency** **f1_low** **f1_high** **f2_low** **f2_high** **1880**

f1\| \|f2_high + max BW f1\| IMD frequency limits (MHz) 1800 2000 2280 2420
* * *
It can be seen from the table 6.79.3-1 that the 3rd order IMD products are
only fall into the BS receive of Bands 1, 2, 25, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40,
and 65.
It should be noted that Bands 2, 25, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37 and 65 are not
intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 39 and 40. In
addition, TDD BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously in a single
band, the BS's own Band 39 and 40 receiver and other synchronized Band 39 and

the harmonics and IMD products falling into Band 1.
It is recommended that Bands 39 and 40 BS transmitters do not share the same

### 6.80.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.80.3-1 only give the intermodulation products for CA_39C-40D by
considering the maximum bandwidth supported by CA_39C-40D, which is 35MHz for
Band 39 and 60MHz for Band 40. The UL/DL harmonic products and the other
intermodulation products can be referred to fall back mode such as CA_39A-40A,

It can be seen from the Table 6.81.3-2 that:
\- The 2nd order IMD products may fall into BS receive Bands of 3, 4, 10, 24,
46 and 66.
\- The 3rd order IMD products may fall into BS receive Bands of 1, 2, 3, 4,
10, 22, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 42, 43, 46, 48, 65 and 66.
However, when the impact of maximum bandwidth is considered, the 3rd order IMD
products are only fall into the BS receive of Bands 1, 2, 22, 25, 33, 35, 36,
37, 39, 42, 43, 48 and 65.
It should be noted that Bands 2, 4, 10, 22, 24, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 43,
46, 48, 65 and 66 are not intended for use in the same region with Band 39 and
Band 42. Consequently, the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD
products falling into Bands 1, 3, 39, 42 and 46. In addition, considering TDD
BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously, the BS's own Band 39, 42
receivers and other synchronization TDD band would not be interfered.
Therefore, the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD falling into Bands
1 and 3.
It is recommended that Bands 39 and 42 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 1 and 3, BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will
not cause Bands 1 and 3 BS receiver desensitization.

It can be seen from Table 6.83.3-2 that the 2^rd^ harmonics fall into the
E-UTRA operating BS receive band 46, there is no UL for Band 46, thus it is no
need to consider the influence for Band 46 BS receiver desensitization.
It can also be seen none of the 3^rd^ harmonics any E-UTRA operating BS
receive bands.
It can also be seen that two-tone 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Band
7, 22, 38, 41 and 42, and that the two-tone 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall
into Band 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 31, 44 and 68. The
three tone 3^rd^ order products may fall into Band 7, 38 and 41.With the
performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive path
components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is expected
that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 5, 6, 7, 8,
12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 31,38, 41, 42, 44 and 68 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Band 41 and Band 46 BS transmitters do
not share the same antenna with any of these receivers.

For the UE which supports CA_41A-46E the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.83.4-1 and 6.83.4-2 respectively assuming separate

### 6.84.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.84.3-1 gives the UL to DL harmonic products for CA Band 41, Band 41,
Band 46, Band 46 and Band 46 with 1UL. It can be seen that 2^nd^ harmonics
fall into band 46.

3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 7488 to 8070 15450 to 17775
* * *
The 2nd and 3rd order DL to UL harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of band 41, band 41, band 46, band 46 and band 46 DL carriers is
calculated and shown in table 6.84.3-2 below:

It can be seen from Table 6.84.3-2 that the 2^rd^ harmonics fall into the
E-UTRA operating BS receive band 46, there is no UL for Band 46, thus it is no
need to consider the influence for Band 46 BS receiver desensitization.
It can also be seen none of the 3^rd^ harmonics any E-UTRA operating BS
receive bands.
It can also be seen that two-tone 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Band
7, 22, 38, 41 and 42, and that the two-tone 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall
into Band 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 31, 44 and 68. The
three tone 3^rd^ order products may fall into Band 7, 38 and 41.With the
performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive path
components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is expected
that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 5, 6, 7, 8,
12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 31,38, 41, 42, 44 and 68 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Band 41 and Band 46 BS transmitters do
not share the same antenna with any of these receivers.

carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating
in single carrier mode.
### 6.85.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.85.3-1 gives the UL to DL harmonic products for CA Band 41, Band 41,
Band 41, Band 46 and Band 46 with 1UL. It can be seen that 2^nd^ harmonics
fall into band 46.
Table 6.85.3-1: Band 41, Band 41, Band 41, Band 46 and Band 46 1UL harmonic
products

3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 7488 to 8070 15450 to 17775
* * *
The 2nd and 3rd order DL to UL harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of band 41, band 41, band 41, band 46 and band 46 DL carriers is
calculated and shown in table 6.85.3-2 below:

It can be seen from Table 6.85.3-2 that the 2^rd^ harmonics fall into the
E-UTRA operating BS receive band 46, there is no UL for Band 46, thus it is no
need to consider the influence for Band 46 BS receiver desensitization.
It can also be seen none of the 3^rd^ harmonics any E-UTRA operating BS
receive bands.
It can also be seen that two-tone 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Band
7, 22, 38, 41 and 42, and that the two-tone 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall
into Band 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 31, 44 and 68. The
three tone 3^rd^ order products may fall into Band 7, 38 and 41.With the
performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive path
components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is expected
that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 5, 6, 7, 8,
12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 31,38, 41, 42, 44 and 68 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Band 41 and Band 46 BS transmitters do
not share the same antenna with any of these receivers.
### 6.85.4 ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB,c values
For the UE which supports CA_41D-46C the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.85.4-1 and 6.85.4-2 respectively assuming separate
antenna architecture without HTF:

### 6.87.2 Co-existence studies
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic and IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting
CA_1A-3A-7A-20A-28A follow from those derived for the constituent fall-back
modes.
### 6.87.3 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
The insertion loss values are derived from existing combination
CA_1A-3A-7A-8A, but with low band B8 replaced by B20 and B28 connected with a
quadplexer.
