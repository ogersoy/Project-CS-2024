# 1 Scope
The present document is a technical report for the LTE 2,6 GHz FDD
supplemental downlink (SDL) band covering 2 570-2 620 MHz. It is intended to
be specified for E-UTRA for operations in Region 1. The band is to be used in
CA for E-UTRA. The LTE CA combination of Band 3+ FDD SDL Band 2 570-2 620 MHz
was selected. All the CA related aspects are reported in 2DL/1UL CA basket TR
36.714-02-01 [3].

# 4 Background
CEPT amended in July 2015, the \"Harmonized utilization of spectrum for
Mobile/Fixed Communications Networks (MFCN) operating within the band 2 500-2
690 MHz\". The associated ECC Decision (05)05 [2] mentions the following:
\- Administrations may assign the frequency band 2 570-2 620 MHz either for
TDD or for Supplemental Downlink.
\- Any guard bands required to ensure adjacent band compatibility at 2 570 MHz
and 2 620 MHz boundaries will be decided on a national basis and taken within
the band 2 570-2 620 MHz.
\- Assigned blocks shall be in multiple of 5,0 MHz.
The objective of the WI is to:
\- Specify the band numbering and RF characteristics of the new LTE FDD 2,6GHz
SDL band (2 570-2 620 MHz) for region 1:
\- E-UTRA channel bandwidths 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz.
\- This band is restricted to be used on CA configuration for E-UTRA.
\- Specify the RF requirements for the support of E-UTRA Carrier Aggregation
between Band 3 + FDD 2,6GHz SDL band (2 570-2 620 MHz) for region 1.

DL-only carrier Aggregation.
# 5 Frequency band arrangements and regulatory background
CEPT ECC decided in July 2015 to amend the harmonised utilization of spectrum
for Mobile/Fixed Communications Networks (MFCN) operating within the band 2
500-2 690 MHz [2]. The decision includes the allocation of the range 2 570-2
620 MHz either for TDD or for supplemental downlink. Assigned blocks shall be
in multiple of 5,0 MHz. Any guard bands required to ensure adjacent band
compatibility at 2 570 MHz and 2 620 MHz boundaries will be decided on a
national basis and taken within the band 2 570-2 620 MHz.

Figure 5-1: Frequency range 2 500 -- 2 690 MHz channel arrangement
ECC agreed on the Least Restrictive Technical Conditions (LRTC) in terms of
Block Edge Mask (BEM) [2]. It consists of several elements of in-block power
limits and the out-of-block limits. An out-of-block element consists of a
baseline level and transitional levels enabling filter roll-off from in-block
to baseline levels.

For TDD blocks, the | | | transitional region applies 0 to 5 MHz below | | | and above the block assigned to the operator. | | | Transitional regions do not apply to TDD | | | blocks allocated to other operators, unless | | | networks are synchronized.

The BEMs are illustrated in the following tables. Less stringent technical
parameters may be agreed among the affected parties, on a bilateral or
multilateral basis.

# 6 List of band specific issues for the LTE FDD 2,6GHz Supplemental Downlink
band (2 570-2 620 MHz)
Here is the list of issues that are studied for the LTE FDD 2,6GHz SDL band
and its CA with band 3:
\- Co-existence with other 3GPP operating bands in Region 1
\- BS unwanted emission & spurious emissions
\- CA Band 3 + Band 69:
\- BS co-existence studies for 1UL/2DL
\- UE REFSENS
\- UE MOP
> The CA related issues are addressed in 2DL/1UL CA basket TR 36.714-02-01

# 7 Study of E-UTRA specific issues
## 7.1 UE coexistence
The new 2,6 GHz SDL band coincides exactly with existing TDD Band 38. It is
anticipated that one likely UE front-end to support the SDL band would be to
reuse the same filter as the Band 38 filter since the frequency range is
identical. Moreover, it is noted that the use of Band 3 for the primary
carrier with the new 2,6 GHz SDL band is analogous to CA_3A-38A already
defined in the specifications for the case where Band 3 carries the PCell.
As the new 2,6 GHz SDL band is defined for Region 1, other bands operating in
Region 1 should provide protection to this band. Region 1 bands which should
provide UE coexistence protection to the new band include 1, 3, 7, 8, 20, 22,
31, 33, 34, 40, 42, 43, and 65. It is not anticipated that Band 38 would be
deployed in the same geographical region as the new SDL band since the
frequency range overlap; therefore, a coexistence requirement to protect the
new band is not levied upon a Band 38 UE. Band 20 has a 3^rd^ harmonic of the
uplink impinging upon the new band for some channels and therefore requires an
exception for UE coexistence. Band 7 uplink is immediately adjacent to this
band in the same manner that it is adjacent to Band 38. The simplest and most
consistent approach would be the reuse the Band 7 to Band 38 UE coexistence
requirements for this new band as well. Alternatively, an A-MPR can be defined
for Band 7 under a new NS condition to provide greater protection for the new
band. However, this would bring an inconsistency in protecting the same
frequency range with different values depending on whether it is Band 38 or
the SDL band, and also introduces Band 7 transmitter limitations which may
impact legacy networks for the purpose of protecting a band that is used for
supplemental purposes. Our recommendation is to reuse the existing Band 7 to
Band 38 coexistence requirements.

## 7.2 BS specific
### 7.2.1 Operating band unwanted emissions
2,6 GHz SDL band for Region 1 is defined over the same frequency range as TDD
Band 38. Also, Band 38 is specified for its use in Europe. Therefore, the same
unwanted emission limits apply.
A single spectrum emission mask applies to all bands in TS 37.104 [6] and thus
no modification is needed in this TS. The following change applies to Clause
6.6.3 of TS 36.104 [4]:
6.6.3.1 Minimum requirements for Wide Area BS (Category A)
For E-UTRA BS operating in Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 65, 66, 69, emissions
shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.3.1-4 to
6.6.3.1-6:
6.6.3.2 Minimum requirements for Wide Area BS (Category B)
For E-UTRA BS operating in Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 22, 25, 30, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45, 65, 66, 69 emissions shall not exceed the
maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.3.2.1-4 to 6.6.3.2.1-6:
### 7.2.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements
To ensure sufficient protection for co-existence with 69, the same limits as
for the other E-UTRA bands BS **shall** be specified for Band 69 in Clause
6.6.4.3 of TS 36.104 [4] and Clause 6.6.4.5.4 of TS 36.141 [5]. The same
modifications are needed in Clause 6.6.1.3 of TS 37.104 [6] and Clause
6.6.1.5.5 of TS 37.141 [7].

### 7.2.3 Blocking requirement for co-location with other base stations
The blocking requirements for co-location with other BS shall be specified for
Band 69 in Clause 7.6.2 of TS 36.104 [4], Clause 7.6.5.2 of TS 36.141 [5]. The
same changes are needed in Clause 7.5.2 of TS 37.104 [6] and Clause 7.5.5.2 of
TS 37.141 [7]:

Channel number allocations are not specified in the 37 series (MSR)
specifications, but are referenced from the respective RAT. Consequently, no
changes are incurred in the MSR specifications due to the introduction of new
EARFCN.
