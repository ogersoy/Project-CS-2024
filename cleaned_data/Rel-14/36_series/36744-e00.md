# 4 Background
**On April 21^st^ 2015, the FCC released a Report and Order (R &O) and Second
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Second FNPRM) to establish new rules
for commercial use of the 3550-3700 MHz band. This framework creates a
contiguous 150 MHz block at 3550-3700 MHz (3.5 GHz) for mobile broadband that
FCC calls "Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS)" and regulated under new
Part 96 of FCC's Rules. Furthermore, on May 2^nd^ 2016, a second R&O and Order
on Reconsideration was released by FCC to finalize the rules.**
The objective of the Work Item is to s**pecify a new E-UTRA TDD operating band
(3550-3700 MHz) with support of 5, 10, 15 and 20MHz channel bandwidths to
operate in the USA.**
# 5 Frequency band arrangements and regulatory background
The 3550-3700MHz band plan is shown in Figure 5.1. The adjacent 3700-4200MHz
band is used by C-Band Fixed Satellite Services Earth Stations. On the lower
side, the band 3100-3550MHz is used by US Department of Defense (DoD) for
operating various types of shipborne, land-based, and aeronautical mobile
radar systems.

Summary of the FCC's rules relevant to RAN4 work to define a new band for US
3.5GHz band are provided below:
> _Power Limits:_
The maximum EIRP and maximum Power Spectral Density (PSD) of any CBSD and EUD
must comply with the limits shown in the table below:
Table 5.**1:** CBSD and EUD Power Limits
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+-----+ | | Category A CBSD | Category B CBSD | EUD | | | | (only outdoor) | | | | (indoor or | | | | | outdoor) | | | +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+-----+ | Maximum EIRP | 30 | 47 | 23 | | (dBm/10MHz) | | | | +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+-----+ | Maximum PSD | 20 | 37 | n/a | | (dBm/MHz) | | | | +-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+-----+
_3.5 GHz Emissions and Interference Limits:_
(1) _General protection levels._ Except as otherwise specified below, for CBSD
channel and frequency assignments, the conducted power of any emission outside
the fundamental emission (whether in or outside of the authorized band) shall
not exceed -13 dBm/MHz within 0-10 megahertz above the upper assigned channel
edge and within 0-10 megahertz below the lower assigned channel edge. At all
frequencies greater than 10 megahertz above the upper assigned channel edge
and less than 10 MHz below the lower assigned channel edge, the conducted
power of any emission shall not exceed -25 dBm/MHz. The upper and lower
assigned channel edges are the upper and lower limits of any channel assigned
to a CBSD, or in the case of multiple contiguous channels, the upper and lower
limits of the combined contiguous channels.
(2) _Additional protection levels._ The conducted power of any emissions below
3530 MHz or above 3720 MHz shall not exceed -40dBm/MHz.
In summary, the emission limits for CBSDs and EUDs are as follows:
\- -13 dBm/MHz from 0 to 10 MHz from the assigned channel edge
\- -25 dBm/MHz beyond 10 MHz from the assigned channel edge down to 3530 MHz
and up to 3720 MHz
\- -40 dBm/MHz below 3530 MHz and above 3720 MHz
{width="5.61875in" height="3.071527777777778in"}
Figure 5.2: CBSD & EUD Emission Limits
(3) _Measurement procedure:_
(i) Compliance with this provision is based on the use of measurement
instrumentation employing a resolution bandwidth of 1 megahertz or greater.
However, in the 1 megahertz bands immediately outside and adjacent to the
licensee\'s authorized frequency channel, a resolution bandwidth of no less
than one percent of the fundamental emission bandwidth may be employed. A
narrower resolution bandwidth is permitted in all cases to improve measurement
accuracy provided the measured power is integrated over the full reference
bandwidth (_i.e.,_ 1 MHz or 1 percent of emission bandwidth, as specified).
The emission bandwidth is defined as the width of the signal between two
points, one below the carrier center frequency and one above the carrier
center frequency, outside of which all emissions are attenuated at least 26 dB
below the transmitter power.

### 7.1.1 Transmitter characteristics
#### 7.1.1.1 Maximum output power
For an End User Device, the maximum output power is defined as 23 dBm EIRP in
10 MHz. Given that the antenna gain on the UE is typically less than 0 dB, it
seems reasonable that the class 3 maximum output power as defined in 36.101 of
23 dBm +2/-3, consistent with Band 42 and Band 43, can be adopted for this
band as the conducted specification. Of course, it is still incumbent upon the
End User Device manufacturer to ultimately satisfy the EIRP requirement for
regulatory certification. The FCC rules specify the maximum EIRP within 10
MHz. It might be interpreted that this rule would allow higher transmit EIRP
in wider bandwidths, for example 3 dB higher in a 20 MHz fully allocated
channel. However, we propose that the same power class and maximum output
power be applied in the 3GPP specifications for all channel bandwidths defined
for the band, including 15 and 20 MHz.

#### 7.1.1.2 UE maximum output power with additional requirements
An NS value (tentatively assigned NS_27) should be defined for the band to
signal that additional spurious emission requirements are applicable and that
A-MPR is available.

#### 7.1.1.3 Configured transmitted power
Additionally, to reap ecosystem benefits by enabling reuse of the RF front-end
across Band 42, Band 43, and the new US 3.5 GHz band, any Î”T~IB,c~ allowance
for Band 42 or for Band 43 should also be applicable for the new US 3.5 GHz
band, and vice-versa. This is similar to the handling for Band 65 where it was
motivated to enable a common front-end design with Band 1.
Attachment of the following or similar note to the Î”T~IB,c~ tables may be used
to accomplish this.
NOTE: For UE supporting E-UTRA band 42, 43, or 48 and CA configurations
including Band 42, 43 or 48, the applicable Î”T~IB,c~ in Band 42, 43, or 48 is
the max(Band 42 Î”T~IB,c~ , Band 43 Î”T~IB,c~, Band 48 Î”T~IB,c~).
#### 7.1.1.4 Spectrum emission mask (network signalled "NS_[27]")
The emission requirements are summarized below in Figure 7.1.1.4-1, extracted
from Figure 2, page 60 of the FCC's R&O [2].

Figure 7.1.1.4-1: Emission requirements taken from FCC R&O in [3].
#### 7.1.1.5 UE coexistence
The band is defined for operation in the US. Therefore, US bands should be
protected and should provide protection to this band at a level of -50
dBm/MHz. Bands include 2, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 17, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 41, 66,
and 70. Band 66 uplink requires a second harmonic exception.
#### 7.1.1.6 Additional spurious emissions (network signalled valued
"NS_[27]")
Additional protection is required such that the power of any emissions below
3530 MHz or above 3720 MHz shall not exceed -40 dBm/MHz.
#### 7.1.1.7 A-MPR
##### 7.1.1.7.1 Study assumptions (Company 1)
We analyze the A-MPR required assuming that the SEM and additional spurious
emission requirements will be conditioned on NS signaling. To conduct the
analysis, the following parameters and assumptions were used
1\. A 3.5 GHz PA was modeled/measured. This PA is capable of supporting the
entire range 3400 -- 3800 MHz. Compared to the previous study, the PA has been
updated. Unfortunately, the updated PA requires slightly more A-MPR than
previously reported, but is more reflective of the actual PA to be
commercialized for this application.
2\. No filter attenuation is assumed since a multi-layer ceramic filter used
in 3.5 GHz applications will not be able to provide any attenuation at the
offsets required here. It is assumed that to enable harmonization and to
minimize fragmentation of the 3.5 GHz ecosystem, a common RF front-end will be
used for all 3.5 GHz TDD bands worldwide. In any event, it will be shown below
that even if a filter were to be assumed, it would not help in meeting the SEM
requirement.
3\. -25 dBm/MHz LO and IQ image rejection.
4\. -60 dB counter-IM3 rejection.
##### 7.1.1.7.2 Study results (Company 1)
Simulations and lab measurements were conducted with an updated 3.5 GHz PA to
evaluate the necessary A-MPR to meet both the SEM and the spurious emission
requirement. No A-MPR was found to be required for 5 and 10 MHz channels.
However, while it was previously reported that up to 3 dB A-MPR is required
for 20 MHz channels and 15 MHz channels had not been studied, a more
comprehensive study with updated an PA reveals that the previous result was
overly optimistic. In fact, as shown below, for 15 and 20 MHz channels, A-MPR
of up to 4 dB is required for some allocations.
Simulation results are shown below.

* * *
The results provided in the simulations and measurements above include both
SEM and spurious emission requirements. It was found that the -25 dBm/MHz for
SEM was dominant, especially for narrowband allocations. Moreover, since SEM
requirements are defined relative to channel boundaries, the A-MPR needed to
meet the emission mask is required of all channels throughout the band, rather
than limited to only band edge channels. Equally important, since the SEM
requirements must be met _within_ the band, an RF filter is not able to
provide any relief.
We compare the results presented above with other similar requirements. We
first observe the similarity in SEM requirements proposed for this band
compared to those defined by NS_06 for US 700 MHz bands where no A-MPR is
allowed. However, NS_06 is only defined for bandwidths up to 10 MHz.
Therefore, it can be anticipated that A-MPR for up to 10 MHz channels in this
3.5 GHz band would similarly not require A-MPR assuming that the PA models at
3.5 GHz do not deviate significantly compared to those at 700 MHz when
constrained by ACLR and other general requirements. Simulation results confirm
these expectations. For 10 MHz channels, no A-MPR was needed to meet the SEM
requirement. However, since the SEM requirement for US 3.5 GHz does not scale
with bandwidth, it was found that there is a need for A-MPR with larger
bandwidths.
Specifically, the results illustrated above below show that up to 4 dB of
A-MPR is needed to meet SEM and spurious emissions. The allocations needing
the largest A-MPR are small allocations located at the edge of the channel due
to IMD products exceeding the -25 dBm/MHz limit at 10 MHz offset from the
channel edge. We note that this could have been avoided if the SEM mask were
to scale with bandwidth such that the -25 dBm/MHz boundary is located at an
offset equal to the channel bandwidth. However with the existing SEM limit for
channels larger than 10 MHz, the required backoff can have a significant
impact to reliability of PUCCH channels, thereby suggesting that over-
provisioning of the PUCCH resource may be needed for 15 and 20 MHz carriers. A
similar requirement can be observed for Band 28 with NS_18. In that case, the
requirement is -26.2 dBm/6 MHz at an offset of 5 MHz away from the channel
edge. The challenge is similar to the requirement here of -25 dBm/MHz at 10
MHz away from the channel edge for narrow-band allocations located at the band
edge. For NS_18, the maximum A-MPR allowed is 4 dB, which is consistent with
the findings and proposal for this band.

### 7.1.2 Receiver characteristics
#### 7.1.2.1 Reference sensitivity
For the TDD band, the reference sensitivity is strongly dependent on the
front-end filter insertion loss since there is no simultaneous transmit
component. As it is expected that the same filter for Band 42 and Band 43 can
be reused for the US 3.5 GHz band, it is reasonable to assign the same
reference sensitivity to this band as specified for Band 42 and 43.
Table 7.1.2.1-1: Reference sensitivity QPSK P~REFSENS~

43 -99 -96 -94.2 -93 TDD

[48] -99 -96 -94.2 -93 TDD
* * *
Additionally, to reap ecosystem benefits by enabling reuse of the RF front-end
across Band 42, Band 43, and the new US 3.5 GHz band, any Î”R~IB,c~ allowance
for Band 42 or for Band 43 should also be applicable for the new US 3.5 GHz
band, and vice-versa. This is similar to the handling for Band 65 where it was
motivated to enable a common front-end design with Band 1.
Attachment of the following or similar note to the Î”R~IB,c~ tables may be used
to accomplish this.
NOTE: For UE supporting E-UTRA band 42, 43, or 48 and CA configurations
including Band 42, 43 or 48, the applicable Î”R~IB,c~ in Band 42, 43, or 48 is
the max(Band 42 Î”R~IB,c~ , Band 43 Î”R~IB,c~, Band 48 Î”R~IB,c~).
#### 7.1.2.2 Blocking
In-band blocking and out-of-band blocking requirements for the US 3.5 GHz band
should reuse the same requirements as specified for Band 42 and Band 43 since
there are no specific mandatory blocking requirements for the UE defined in
the FCC rules. For out-of-band blocking, it is anticipated that the UE
supporting 3.5 GHz bands including Band 42, 43, and the US 3.5 GHz will
utilize a ceramic front-end RF filter to minimize insertion loss. Therefore,
the supportable out-of-band blocking has been adjusted in the following
manner.
NOTE 2: The power level of the interferer (P~Interferer~) for Range 3 shall be
modified to -20 dBm for F~Interferer~ > 2800 MHz and F~Interferer~ \< 4400
MHz.
This modification of out-of-band blocking shall also apply to the UE
supporting the US 3.5 GHz band.
