**Note 1:** UL carrier shall be supported in each of the 4 bands being
aggregated unless otherwise specified.
**Note 2: UL carrier is only supported on Band 1 or Band 42 not Band 41
because the fall back mode 1UL/2DL CA_1A-41A has the limitation that UL
carrier is only supported on Band 1.**
This TR contains a general part and band specific combination part. The actual
requirements are added to the corresponding technical specifications.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [2] and the following apply.\ A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[2].

# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for 4DL/1UL Inter-band Carrier
Aggregation under Rel-14 time frame. It covers both the UE and BS side. The
present document is divided in two different parts:
\- General part: this part covers BS and UE specific which is band combination
independent.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination and
its specific issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is
defined per band combination)
The specific band combination parts are independent and therefore, the working
speed also differs.
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
present document, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the
contact person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the
band combination have been implemented.
# 5 4DL Carrier Aggregation with Single UL: General Part
As 4DL CA combinations have been studied in Rel-13, the identified general
issues identified in Rel-13 [3] also apply to Rel-14. This TR only captured
the new general issues if identified in Rel-14.

carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [4] when
operating in single carrier mode.
### 6.1.2 Co-existence studies
The 3rd order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting CA_3A-41A-42C
(i.e. 4DL CA with one component carrier on bands 3 and 41 and two carriers on
band 42) are derived in the constituent 3DL and 2DL CA fall-back modes, which
have been already analyzed and captured into 3GPP TR 36.852-12, TR 36.852-13,
TR 36.853-12 and TR 36.853-13.

NOTE 5: The B41 requirements are modified by -0.5dB when carrier frequency of the assigned E-UTRA channel bandwidth is within 2545-2690 MHz. NOTE 6: The antenna isolation for MSD calculation is assumed as 10 dB. For conducted mode REFSENS test such antenna isolation is not observed as the antennas are disconnected. Additionally antenna isolation assumption is under discussion depending on the frequency range. NOTE 7: These requirements apply when there is at least one individual RE within the uplink transmission bandwidth of the aggressor (lower) band for which the 2nd transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission bandwidth of a victim (higher) band and a range âˆ†FHD above and below the edge of this downlink transmission bandwidth. The value âˆ†FHD depends on the E-UTRA configuration: âˆ†FHD = 10 MHz for CA_3A-42A, CA_3A-42C, CA_1A-3A-42A, CA_1A-3A-42C, CA_3A-19A-42A, CA_3A-19A-42C and CA_1A-3A-19A-42A, CA 3A-41A-42A, CA 3A-41A-42C. NOTE 8: The requirements should be verified for UL EARFCN of the aggressor (lower) band (superscript LB) such that $f_{\text{UL}}^{\text{LB}} = \left\lfloor \frac{f_{\text{DL}}^{\text{HB}}}{0}\text{.}2 \right\rfloor 0\text{.}1$in MHz and with carrier frequency in the victim (higher) band in MHz and the channel bandwidth configured in the lower band. NOTE 9: The requirements are only applicable to channel bandwidths with a carrier frequency at $\pm \left( \text{20} + \frac{\text{BW}_{\text{Channel}}^{\text{HB}}}{2} \right)$ MHz offset from 2 _f_ ULLB in the victim (higher band) with , whereandBWChannelHBare the channel bandwidths configured in the aggressor (lower) and victim (higher) bands in MHz, respectively. NOTE 10: Only applicable for UE supporting inter-band carrier aggregation with uplink in one E-UTRA band and without simultaneous Rx/Tx. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 65 and 66. However, when the impact of
maximum bandwidth is considered, the 3^rd^ order IMD products do not fall into
the BS receive of Bands 23, 24, and 34.
It should be noted that Bands 2, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25,
27, 33, 35, 36, 37, 65 and 66 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Band 3 and Band 41. Consequently, the focus here will be
on the harmonics and IMD products falling into Bands 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 26,
28, 38, 39, 41, 42, 44 and 68.
TDD BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously in a single band, the BS's
own Band 41 receiver and other synchronized Band 41 receivers would not be
interfered.
It is recommended that Bands 3 and 41 BS transmitters should not share the
same antenna with Bands 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 26, 28, 68, unsynchronized 38,
unsynchronized 39, unsynchronized 42 and unsynchronized 44 BS receivers unless
the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that
the PIM will not cause these Band's BS receivers desensitization. Note that
antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in
the future.

For the UE which supports CA_1A-3A-7A-42A the Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ are
defined for applicable bands in Table 6.27.3 -1 and 6.27.3-2 respectively.
Values are derived from existing combination 1A-3A-42A and where Band 7 is
added by replacing the 1A-3A quadplexer with a hexplexer (adding 0.1 dB in
Î”T~IB,c~ for band 1, 3 and 7 on top of the relaxation of 1A-3A-42A or
1A-3A-7A. Then Î”R~IB,c~ for band 7 is 0.2dB due to the insertion loss of the
harmonic trap filter in the same way as band 1 and 3).

### 6.31.2 Co-existence studies for CA_1A-5A-7C
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting the 4DL CA_1A-5A-7C follow from those derived for the constituent
2DL and 3DL CAs, which have been already analysed and captured into TR
36.853-12, TR36.852-12 and TR36.807 v10.0.0.
### 6.31.3 âˆ†TIB,c and âˆ†RIB,c values
For the UE which supports CA_1A-5A-7C, the Î”T~IB,c~ and Î”R~IB,c~ are defined
for applicable bands in Table 6.31.3-1 and 6.31.3-2 respectively.

### 6.48.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1, Band
3, Band 5 and Band 7 DL carriers (i.e. 4DL CA with one component carrier in
each band) are derived in the constituent 3DL and 2DL CAs, which have been
already analyzed.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 40 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.72.3-2 below:

It can be seen from table 6.72.3-2 that:
\- the 2^nd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 22, 42
and 43.
\- the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30,
31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, 65, 66, 68 and 70.
assuming (except the last row) the whole 100 MHz DL frequency of Band 40 and
the whole 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 46.
If the BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 20 MHz DL in Band 40 and 40MHz
DL in Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will still
fall into same BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20,
22, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 38, 40, 42, 43, 44 and 68.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 5, 8, 13, 20, 22, 26, 28, 31, 40,
42, 43, 44 and 68 are possibly intended for use in the same geographical area
(country) as Bands 40 and 46. Therefore the Bands 5, 8, 13, 20, 22, 26, 28,
40, 42, 43, 44 and 68 shall be considered for IMD products.
It is recommended that Bands 40 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 5, 8, 13, 20, 22, 26, 28, 31, 40, 42, 43, 44 and 68
BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will not cause Bands5, 8, 13, 20, 22, 26,
28, 31, 40, 42, 43, 44 and 68 BS receiver desensitization.

the constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating
in single carrier mode.
### 6.73.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 40, Band
40, Band 46 and Band 46 DL carriers (i.e. 4DL CA with one component carrier in
each band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.73.3-1 below:

frequency limits (MHz) 2260 2440 5110 5965
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.73.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, if the
BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 40MHz DL in Band 40 and 40MHz DL in
Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will fall into same
BS receive band of Bands 30 and 40. In addition, it should be noted that Band
30 is not intended for use in the same geographical area (country) as Bands 40
and 46. This leaves Band 40 to consider for IMD products.
In addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD products from the constituent
2DL CA configurations, it is recommended that Bands 40 and 46 BS transmitters
do not share the same antenna with bands of Band 40 BS receiver so that the
antenna PIM will not cause Band 40 BS receiver desensitization.

### 6.74.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 40, Band
40, Band 40 and Band 46 DL carriers (i.e. 4DL CA with one component carrier in
each band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.74.3-1 below:

It can be seen from table 6.74.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, if the
BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 60MHz DL in Band 40 and 20MHz DL in
Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will fall into same

and 46. This leaves Band 40 to consider for IMD products.
In addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD products from the constituent

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 28 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.83.3-2 below:
**Table 6.83.3-2 Band 28 and Band 46 DL harmonics and IMD products**

It can be seen from table 6.83.3-2 that:
\- the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 28 and 46 may fall into
none of the BS receive band of 3GPP
\- the 3^rd^ harmonic may fall into BS receive band of Bands 30, 40
\- the 2^nd^ IMD products may fall into none of the BS receive band of 3GPP
\- the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into BS receive Bands 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13,
14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 31, 42, 43, 44, 45, 68
Note that the calculation in table 6.83.3-2 (except the last row) assumes the
BS transmits the whole 45 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 28 and Band 46
respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 20 MHz and 60 MHz DL in Band 28 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.83.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20,
26, 27, 28, 42, 43, 44, 68 as shown in the last row in table 6.83.3-2.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 26,
27, 43 and 45 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands
28 and 46. This leaves Bands 5, 8, 20, 21, 28, 31 42, 44 and 68 to consider
for IMD products.
It is recommended that Bands 28 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 5, 8, 20, 21, 28, 42, 44 and 68 BS receivers so
that the antenna PIM will not cause Bands 5, 8, 20, 21, 28, 31, 42, 44 and 68
BS receiver desensitization.
### 6.83.4 MSD
For this CA configuration, the 7^th^ and 8^th^ harmonic of Band 28 falls into
Band 46. Nevertheless, HTF should not be applied for this CA combination in
order to avoid additional insertion loss for the licensed band. In this case,
the frequency gap to avoid MSD in Band 46 and the UL configuration are
specified as shown in table 6.83.4-1 and 6.83.4-2.

The 2nd and 3rd harmonic and IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of
CA_3A-5A-40A-40A (i.e. 4DL CA with one component carrier on Bands 3 and Band 5
and two non-contiguous carriers on Band 40) are derived in the constituent 3DL
and 2DL CAs, which have been already analysed and captured into 3GPP TR
36.852-12, TR36.853-13 and TR 36.714-03-01.

### 6.155.5 REFSENS requirements
The REFSENS of 4DL/1UL CA_3A-5A-40A-40A keep the same MSD values with its
fallback mode CA_3A-5A-40A due to insufficient cross band isolation between B3
and B40, and the requirements are shown in table 6.155.5-1 with the uplink

transmitting of Band 1, Band 3, Band 5 and Band 41 DL carriers (i.e. 4DL CA
with one component carrier in each band) follow from those derived for the
constituent 2DL and 3DL CA fall-back modes.
#### 6.159.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.159.3.2-1 gives the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic for CA with B1+B3+ B5 +
B41. The 3rd order harmonic products of Band 5 UL may fall into the passband
of B41 DL for UE.But it was concluded in 2DL of 5A-41A BCS0 that whether the
harmonic interference issue exist or not still depends on the actual spectrum
allocation. In this 4CA, the same can be applied. Other than that, it is found
that none of the products falls into the B1, B3, B5 or B41 UE receiving bands.

### 6.159.5 REFSENS requirements
Based on the co-existence study in6.159.3, there is no harmonic issue in this
combination taking actual spectrum allocation into account. And following
CA_26A-41A agreement, network should avoid simultaneous Tx/Rx operation for
CA_5A-41A when the Band 41 DL and 3rd harmonic of Band 5 UL overlaps each
other.
For CA_1A-3A-5A-41A, the reference sensitivity requirement of Band1, Band3,
Band5 and Band41are given in Table 6.159.5-1,Table 6.159.5-2 and Table
6.159.5-4, exceptions are allowed when the uplink is active within a specified
frequency range as noted in Table 6.159.5-1,Table 6.159.5-2and Table
6.159.5-4. The related**uplink configuration for reference sensitivity** of
Band1, Band3, Band5 and Band41are given in Table 6.159.5-3 and Table
6.159.5-5. For these exceptions, the UE shall meet the requirements specified
in Table 6.159.5-1, 6.159.5-2 and Table 6.159.5-4.
