**Note 1:** UL carrier shall be supported in each of the 3 bands being
aggregated unless otherwise specified.
**Note 2: UL carrier is only supported on Band 1 or Band 42 not Band 41
because the fall back mode 1UL/2DL CA_1A-41A has the limitation that UL
carrier is only supported on Band 1.**
**Note 3: UL carrier is only supported on Band 1 or Band 3 not Band 41 because
the fall back mode 1UL/2DL CA_1A-41A has the limitation that UL carrier is
only supported on Band 1.**
**Note 4: UL carrier is only supported on Band 3 or Band 20 not Band 32
because Band 32 is SDL band.**
**Note 5: For CA_28A-41A-42A, only non-simultaneous Rx/Tx on Band 41 and Band
42 is supported.**
**This TR contains a general part and band specific combination part. The
actual requirements are added to the corresponding technical specifications.**

# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for 3DL/1UL Inter-band Carrier
Aggregation under Rel-14 time frame. It covers both the UE and BS side. The
document is divided in two different parts:
\- General part: this part covers BS and UE specific which is band combination
independent.
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination and
its specific issues independently from each other (i.e. one subclause is
defined per band combination)
The specific band combination parts are independent and therefore, the working
speed also differs.
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.
# 5 3 Band Carrier Aggregation with Single UL: General Part
As 3 band combinations have been studied in R12 and R13, the general issues
identified in R12 [3] and R13 [4] also apply to R14. This TR only captures the
new general issues identified in R14.

### 6.1.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.1.3-1 gives the harmonic frequency limits for Band 3, Band 3 and Band
41 3DL CA. As shown in the table, 2^nd^ order harmonics of the BS transmitting
may fall into the BS receive band of Band 43 and Band 46, and 3^rd^ harmonics
may fall into the BS receiver band of Band 46.

41

3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 5415 to 5640 7488 to 8070
* * *
Table 6.1.3-2 gives the intermodulation products supporting 3 DL CA of Band 3,
Band 3 and Band 41. In addition, the maximum transmission bandwidth of 60MHz
(40MHz in Band 3 and 20MHz in Band 41) is considered for the IMD analysis.

* * *
It can be seen from the table 6.1.3-2 that the 2nd order IMD products caused
by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 3, Band 3 and Band 41 may fall
into BS receive Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28 and 44.
The 3rd order IMD products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band
3, Band 3 and Band 41 may fall into BS receive Bands of 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10,
22, 23, 24, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41 ,42, 65 and 66. However, when
the impact of maximum bandwidth is considered, the 3rd order IMD products do
not fall into the BS receive of Bands 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 23, 24, 33, 34, 36, 37,
65 and 66.
It should be noted that Bands 2, 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 27 and
35 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Band 3 and Band
41. Consequently, the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD products
falling into Bands 5, 7, 8, 26, 28, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 and 46.
TDD BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously in a single band, the BS's
own Band 41 receiver and other synchronized Band 41 receivers would not be
interfered.
It is recommended that Bands 3 and 41 BS transmitters should not share the
same antenna with Bands 5, 7, 8, 26, 28, unsynchronized 38, unsynchronized 39,
unsynchronized 42, unsynchronized 43, unsynchronized 44 and unsynchronized 46
BS receivers unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause these Band's BS receivers
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.
Table 6.1.3-3 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band 3
+ Band 41 CA with 1 UL.
Table 6.1.3-3: Impact of 1 UL Harmonic Interference
* * *
**UE UL carriers** **f1_low** **f1_high** **f2_low** **f2_high** UL frequency
(MHz) 1710 1785 2496 2690 2^nd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 3420 to
3570 4992 to 5380  
3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 5130 to 5355 7488 to 8070
* * *
It can be seen that the 2^nd^ order harmonics of the Band 3 transmitting may
fall into the receive band of Band 42 and none of 3^rd^ harmonics may fall
into any receive frequencies of the other E-UTRA Bands.
### 6.1.4 ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values
For three simultaneous DLs and one UL of Band 3 and Band 41 for 1UL/3DL
CA_3C-41A, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are shown in table 6.1.4-1 and

NOTE 1: These requirements apply regardless of the channel bandwidth and the location of UL band. NOTE 2: The B41 requirements are modified by -0.5dB when carrier frequency of the assigned E-UTRA channel bandwidth is within 2545-2690 MHz. NOTE 3: The antenna isolation for MSD calculation is assumed as 10 dB. For conducted mode REFSENS test such antenna isolation is not observed as the antennas are disconnected. Additionally antenna isolation assumption is under discussion depending on the frequency range NOTE 4: Applicable only if operation with 4 antenna ports is supported in the band with carrier aggregation configured. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

### 6.5.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1 Band 7
and Band 40 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each band)
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.5.3-1 below:

It can be seen from Table 6.5.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of harmonics
and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ order
IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (1 + 7 + 40) may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 25, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 65
and 66. However, Bands 2, 4, 9, 10, 25, 33, 35, 36, 37 and 66 are not intended
for use in the same geographical area as Bands 1, 7and 40. Therefore, the
focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Bands 1, 3, 7, 39,
40, 41 and 65. As B40 is a TDD band, simultaneous Tx/Rx for the same band will
not happen. So the IMD and harmonic impact to B40 needs not to be considered
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Bands 1, 3, 7, 39, 41
or 65 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Band (1 + 7 + 40) BS
transmitter does not share the same antenna with Bands 1, 3, 7, 39, 41 or 65
BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (1 +7 + 40) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Bands 1, 3, 7, 39, 41 or 65 BS receiver if the
aforementioned BS transmit configurations are used unless the antenna path
meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause Bands 1, 3, 7, 39, 41 or 65 BS receiver desensitization. Note that
antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in
the future.

the constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating
in single carrier mode.
### 6.6.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3 Band 7
and Band 40 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each band)
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.6.3-1 below:

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 6725 6970
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.6.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of harmonics
and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ order
IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (3 + 7 + 40) may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 11, 21 and 24. However, Bands11, 21 and 24 are not
intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 3, 7and 40. Therefore,
if the aforementioned BS transmit configurations are used, we can conclude no
issue on the DL 3^rd^ order IMD interference.

### 6.7.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3, Band
3 and Band 20 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.7.3-1 below:

frequency limits (MHz) 1785 1900 751 861
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.7.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of harmonics
and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, if the BS is
transmitting with Max bandwidth of 40MHz DL in Band 3 and 20MHz DL in Band 20
as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will fall into same BS
receive band of Bands 2, 5, 6, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 35, 39 and 44.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 2, 5, 6, 13, 14, 18, 19, 25, 26,
27, 35, 39 and 44 are not intended for use in the same geographical area
(country) as Bands 3 and 20\. This leaves Band 20 to consider for IMD
products.
It is recommended that Bands 3 and 20 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Band 20 BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will not
cause Band 20 BS receiver desensitization.

The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3, Band

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.8.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of harmonics
and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ order
IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (3 + 3 + 20) may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28 and 44. However,
Bands 5, 6, 13, 14, 18, 19, 26, 27 and 44. are not intended for use in the
same geographical area as Bands 3 and 20. Therefore, the focus here is on the
3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Bands 8, 20 and 28.
Note that the 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS own (20 MHz)
receive block within Band 20. Assume that the 3 carriers transmitted by the
Band (3+3+ 20) BS are a, b and c MHz in channel bandwidth and d, e and f MHz
from the lower edges of Bands 3 and 20 DL frequency bands as shown in Figure
6.8.3-1 below:
{width="6.688194444444444in" height="1.4708333333333334in"}
Figure 6.8.3-1: 3 carriers transmitted by the Band (3 + 3 + 20) BS
And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 6.8.3-2 below:

Figure 6.8.3-2: 3 carriers received by the Band (3 + 3 + 20) BS
Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.8.3-2 below:
Table 6.8.3-2: Band (3 + 3 + 20) BS DL 3^rd^ order IMD products

* * *
Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 6.8.3-2 with the BS receive blocks
in Figure 6.8.3-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused
in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC will only fall into the BS own receive
block of Band 20 under one of the transmit configurations shown in Table
6.8.3-3 below:

downlink in Band 66 for some uplink carriers in Band 12. The impact of the
3^rd^ harmonic has already been studied and specified for CA_4A-12A and
CA_4A-12B which include additional allowances in ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ for a
harmonic trap filter in Band 12. The resulting ∆T~IB~ in Band 12 is 0.8 dB and
in Band 66 is 0.3 dB. The resulting ∆R~IB~ in Band 12 is 0.5 dB and in Band 66
is 0 dB.
### 6.12.5 REFSENS requirements
Reference sensitivity exceptions for CA_12A-66C and CA_12A-66A-66A are defined
due to third harmonic interference from the uplink in Band 12 to the downlink
in Band 4. The impact of the 3^rd^ harmonic has already been studied and
specified for CA_4A-12A and CA_4A-12B. The reference sensitivity for Band 4 is
adjusted by exception when there is Tx-to-Rx harmonic overlap to account for
the interference in Tables 7.3.1A-0a and 7.3.1A-0b in TS 36.101. We propose
that the same values be applied to CA_12A-66C and CA_12A-66A-66A as well, with
a 0.5 dB adjustment in reference sensitivity exception value to account for
the 0.5 dB difference in reference sensitivity between Band 66 and Band 4.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 13 and Band 66 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
Table 6.13.3.1-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.13.3.1-1 that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics of BS
transmitting in Bands 13 and 66 will not fall into the BS receive band of any
frequency band currently defined in 3GPP, but the 2^nd^ IMD products
supporting CA of Band 13 and Band 66 may fall into the BS receive band of
Bands 11, 21 and 45, and the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 42, 43, 44 and
46. Note that the calculation in Table 6.13.3.1-1 (except the last row)
assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 10 MHz DL frequency of Band 13
and the whole 90 MHz DL frequency of Band 66. If the BS is only transmitting
up to 10 MHz DL in Band 13 and up to 20 MHz DL in Band 66 as stated in the
WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS receive band of
Band 5, 6, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26 or 27 as shown in the last row in Table
6.13.3.1-1.
Note that Bands 11, 21, 22, 28, 44 and 45 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 13 and 66. Therefore, the focus here is on the
harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 12, 17, 42, 43 and 46.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 12,
17, 42, 43 or 46 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor
eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands
13 and 66 BS transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 12, 17, 42,
43 or 46 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 13 and 66 BS transmitters should not
share the same antenna with Band 12, 17, 42, 43 or 46 BS receiver, in order to
prevent BS receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very
stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 12,
17, 42, 43 or 46 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be
allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
#### 6.13.3.2 CA_13A-66C
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 13 and Band 66 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in

It can be seen from Table 6.13.3.2-1 that the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics of BS
transmitting in Bands 13 and 66 will not fall into the BS receive band of any
frequency band currently defined in 3GPP, but the 2^nd^ IMD products
supporting CA of Band 13 and Band 66 may fall into the BS receive band of
Bands 11, 21 and 45, and the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 42, 43, 44 and
46. Note that the calculation in Table 6.13.3.2-1 (except the last row)
assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 10 MHz DL frequency of Band 13
and the whole 90 MHz DL frequency of Band 66. If the BS is only transmitting
up to 10 MHz DL in Band 13 and up to 40 MHz DL in Band 66 as stated in the
WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS receive band of
Band 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 26 or 27 as shown in the last row in Table 6.13.3.2-1.
With the frequency separation of 21 MHz between the Band 13 DL and UL, the
3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into the BS receive band of certain frequency
range within Band 13 under the transmit configurations shown in Table
6.13.3.2-2 below:

Also with the transmit-receive frequency separation of 31 MHz in Band 13, the
3^rd^ IMD products may only fall into the BS own receive block within Band 13
under the transmit configurations shown in Table 6.13.3.2-3 below:

Note that Bands 11, 21, 22, 28, 44 and 45 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 13 and 66. Therefore, the focus here is on the
harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 42, 43 and 46.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 12,
13, 14, 17, 42, 43 or 46 receiver or the own Band 13 receiver would be well
below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Bands 13 and 66 BS transmitters do not share
the same antenna with Band 12, 13, 14, 17, 42, 43 or 46 BS receiver, or the
own Band 13 BS receiver if the aforementioned BS transmit configurations are
used.
Therefore, in order to prevent BS receiver desensitization, it is recommended
that Bands 13 and 66 BS transmitters should not share the same antenna with
Band 12, 13, 14, 17, 42, 43 or 46 BS receiver, or the own Band 13 BS receiver
if the aforementioned BS transmit configurations are used, unless the antenna
path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will
not cause Band 12, 13, 14, 17, 42, 43 or 46 BS or the own Band 13 BS receiver
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.
#### 6.13.3.3 CA_13A-66A-66A
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of CA_13A-66A-66A DL carriers can be calculated as shown in Table
6.13.3.3-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.13.3.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA_13A-66A-66A may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 42,
43, 44, 46 and 68.
Note that the 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS own receive block
within Band 13. Assume that the paired spectrum within Band 66 is used, and
the 3 carriers transmitted by the CA_13A-66A-66A BS are _a_ , _b_ and _c_ MHz
in channel bandwidth and _d_ , _e_ and _f_ MHz from the lower edges of Band 13
and Band 66 DL frequency bands as shown in Figure 6.13.3.3-1 below:

And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 6.13.3.3-2
below:

Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.13.3.3-2 below:

Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 6.13.3.3-2 with the BS receive
blocks in Figure 6.13.3.3-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD
products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC will only fall into the
BS own receive block of Band 13 under one of the transmit configurations shown
in Table 6.13.3.3-3 below:

### 6.20.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 7, Band
20 and Band 32 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.20.3-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.x.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of harmonics
and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ order
IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (7 + 20 + 32) may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 23, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39 and 65\. However, Bands 23,
33, 34, 36, 37, 39 and 65 are not intended for use in the same geographical
area as Bands 7, 20 and 32. Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order
IMD products falling into Band 1.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 1 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Band (7 + 20 \+ 32) BS transmitter does not
share the same antenna with Band 1 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (7 + 20 + 32) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 1 BS receiver if the aforementioned BS
transmit configurations are used unless the antenna path meets very stringent
3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 1 BS
receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the
state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
Table 6.20.3-2 gives the harmonic frequency limits for Band 7, Band 20 and
Band 32 3DL CA. As shown in the table, UL carrier of CA_7A-20A-32A_BCS0 is not
located at 2^nd^ order harmonics or 3^rd^ order harmonics of DL carriers.

As shown in Table 6.20.3-3, the harmonic frequencies of Band 7, Band 20 and
Band 32 in UL are away from the receive bands of interest in the DL and we can
conclude that there is no issue on UL harmonic interference.

### 6.21.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3, Band
7 and Band 32 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.21.3-1 below:

IMD frequency limits (MHz) 5877 6066
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.21.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (3 + 7 + 32) may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 12, 17, 28, 30, 40, 44 and 68. However, Bands 12,
17, 28, 30 and 44 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as
Bands 40 and 68. Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products
falling into Bands 40 and 68.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Bands 40 and 68
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Band (3 + 7 + 32) BS
transmitter does not share the same antenna with Bands 40 and 68 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (3 + 7 + 32) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Bands 40 and 68 BS receiver if the aforementioned
BS transmit configurations are used unless the antenna path meets very
stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Bands
40 and 68 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be
allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
As shown in Table 6.21.3-2, the harmonic frequencies of Band 3, Band 7 and
Band 32 in UL are away from the receive bands of interest in the DL and we can
conclude that there is no issue on UL harmonic interference.

### 6.21.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
Filter vendors have been consulted on which are possible implementations of CA
7+32, and following possibilities have been indicated:
1\. one possibility is to use a Pentaplexer covering 3+7+32, cascaded with
diplexer LB/HB on top;
2\. another possibility is to use cascaded Pentaplexer 1+3+32 and Band 7
duplexer, both triplexed LB/MB/HB together.
It is worth to note that second option would be more flexible, in order to let
UE to support also CA configurations including band 1.
[Option 1:]{.underline}
In table below, Delta IL is the additional Insertion Loss needed by new
component w.r.t. legacy UE aggregating 3+32. Cross-isolation addresses the TX-
RX isolation of different bands (e.g. B3 TX vs B7 RX, B7 TX vs B3 TX, etc.).
Table 6.21.4-1: Option 1 data
+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | | Vendor A | +-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | Implementation choice | Pentaplexer 3+7+32 with cascaded diplexer LB/HB | +-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | Delta IL | B32: 0.5dB (Rx) | | | | | | B3: 0.4 dB (Tx), 0.5 dB (Rx) | | | | | | B7: 0.8 dB (Tx), 0.2 dB (Rx) | +-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+ | Isolation | >55dB for all cases (sufficient) | +-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
[Option 2:]{.underline}
Hereafter we consider the triplexer approach for LB/MB/HB on top of
pentaplexer 1+3+32, according to architecture presented below.
{width="4.5in" height="6.489583333333333in"}
Figure6.21.4-1: Proposed architecture for option 2
In following table, data received from one filter vendor are reported. In this
case it can be assumed that legacy UE already supports CA configuration 3+7
and 1+3, thus "Delta IL" are evaluated as difference between legacy case and
new configuration described in Figure 1 above. In the evaluation of DeltaT~IB~
and DeltaR~IB~ for new configurations 7+32 and 3+7+32, legacy values from spec
for CA 3+7 and CA 3+32 have to be considered as well.
Table 6.21.4-2: Option 2 data
+-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | | Vendor B | +-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | Implementation choice | Pentaplexer 1+3+32 with cascaded Triplexer | | | LB/MB/HB | +-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | Delta IL | B32: 0.8 dB (Rx) | | | | | | B3: 0.4 dB (Tx), 0.5 dB (Rx) | | | | | | B7: 0.2 dB (Tx), 0.2 dB (Rx) | +-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | Isolation | >50dB for all cases, considering cascaded | | | Pentaplexer and Triplexer together | | | | | | (sufficient) | +-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
In the past, CA configurations with bands in similar frequency ranges have
been addressed, e.g. CA 1+11 and CA 1+21. In both cases 0.3 dB for ΔTx and 0
dB for ΔRx have been defined.
In addition, in case of CA 3+32 a value of 0.5 dB for ΔTx and 0 dB for ΔRx
have been defined. In case of CA 1+3 a value of 0.3 dB for ΔTx and 0 dB for
ΔRx have been defined, including a potential desens of B3 when the distance
between B1 TX chunk and B3 RX chunk is lower than 60 MHz.
Looking at two options above and related available data it is noted that there
is not a significant difference in terms of Insertion Loss between Option 1
and Option 2, a part Band 7 TX.
Since 3GPP specifies requirements without mandating or underlying any specific
architecture, in the followings a tentative proposal to cover both options
above is done, aiming to let freedom in the implementation of CA
configurations supporting B32 and to not preclude any implementation and at
the same time to not assume one implementation in the specification
definition. In the table below "shared pain" approach has been also
considered, while evaluating final proposals. In the proposal elaboration for
∆T~IB~, ∆R~IB~, legacy values for CA 3+7 and 3+32 are also considered.

### 6.22.2 Co-existence studies
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting the 3DL CA configurations of CA_1A_40C can be calculated as shown
in Table 6.22.2.1-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.22.2.1-1 that 2^nd^ harmonics may fall to UL
frequencies of Band 43, none 3^rd^ order harmonics may fall into any UL
frequencies of 3GPP Bands. 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall to UL frequencies
of Band 31. Taking into account the maximum bandwidths to be used for this CA
combination, 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall to UL frequencies of Band 2,
11, 21, 25, 30, 35, 39-40. As BS operating in Band 40 cannot transmit and
receive in this band at the same time, there is no issue with IMD falling to
UL frequencies of Band 40.
It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 3 and Band 40 should not
share the same antenna with Band 2, 11, 21, 25, 30, 31, 35, 39 or 43 BS
receiver, unless the antenna path meets very stringent third order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 2, 11, 21, 25, 30, 31, 35,
39 or 43 BS receiver desensitization.
### 6.22.3 ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.22.3-1 and 6.22.3-2 respectively.

Note 1: UL carrier is only supported on Band 1 or Band 3 not Band 41 because
the fall back mode 1UL/2DL CA_1A-41A has the limitation that UL carrier is
only supported on Band 1.
### 6.23.3 Co-existence studies
#### 6.23.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1, Band
3 and Band 41 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.23.3.1-1 below:

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 6411 6740
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.18.3.1-1that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (1 + 3 + 41) may fall into
the BS receive band of B11, B21, B30 and B40. However, B30 is not intended for
use in the same geographical area as B1, B3 and B41. Therefore, the focus here
is on 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into B11, B21 and B40.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the B11, B21 and B40
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Band (1 + 3 + 41) BS
transmitter does not share the same antenna with B11, B21 and B40 BS receiver.
Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to
evolve in the future.
#### 6.23.3.2 For the UE
As shown in Table 6.18.3.2-1, the harmonic frequencies of band 1, band 3 in UL
are away from the receive bands of interest in the DL and we can conclude that
there is no issue on UL harmonic interference.

### 6.23.4 ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values

uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the ΔT~IB,c~ is defined for applicable
bands in Table 6.23.4-1.

### 6.24.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.24.3-1 gives the harmonic frequency limits for Band 11, Band 41 and
Band 41 3DL CA. As shown in the table, 2^nd^ order harmonics of the BS
transmitting may fall into the BS receive band of Band 46, and 3^rd^ harmonics
may fall into none of the BS receiver band of 3GPP bands.

Table 6.24.3-2 gives the intermodulation products supporting 3 DL CA of Band
11, Band 41 and Band 41. In addition, the maximum transmission bandwidth of
50MHz (10MHz in Band 11 and 40MHz in Band 41) is considered for the IMD
analysis.

* * *
It can be seen from the table 6.24.3-2 that the 2nd order IMD products caused
by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 11, Band 41 and Band 41 may fall
into none of BS receive Band in 3GPP. The 3rd order IMD products caused by BS
supporting carrier aggregation of Band 11, Band 41 and Band 41 may fall into
BS receive Band of Bands 7, 11, 21, 24, 31, 38, 41, 42 43 and 46. However,
when the impact of maximum bandwidth is considered, the 3rd order IMD products
do not fall into the BS receive of Band 24. In addition, at the time of
writing, B46 is not assumed to support UL transmission.
It should be noted that, at the time of writing, Bands 7, 31, 38 and 43 are
not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 11 and 41\.
Consequently, the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD products falling
into Bands 11, 21, 41 and 42.
TDD BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously in a single band, the BS's
own Band 41 receiver and other synchronized Band 41 receivers would not be
interfered.
It is recommended that Bands 11 and 41 BS transmitters should not share the
same antenna with Bands 11, 21 and 42 BS receivers unless the antenna path
meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause these Band's BS receivers desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may
be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
Table 6.24.3-3 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
11 + Band 41 CA with 1 UL.

It can be seen that no harmful fall down toward DL bands of interest is
observed in UE side

### 6.25.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.25.3-1 gives the harmonic frequency limits for Band 11, Band 42 and
Band 42 3DL CA. As shown in the table, 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics may
fall into none of the BS receiver band of 3GPP bands.

Table 6.25.3-2 gives the intermodulation products supporting 3 DL CA of Band
11, Band 42 and Band 42. In addition, the maximum transmission bandwidth of
50MHz (10MHz in Band 11 and 40MHz in Band 42) is considered for the IMD
analysis.

It can be seen from the table 6.25.3-2 that the 2nd order IMD products caused
by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 11, Band 42 and Band 42 may fall
into BS receive Bands 1, 2, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39 and 65. The 3rd
order IMD products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 11,
Band 42 and Band 42 may fall into BS receive Bands of Bands 11, 21, 22, 24,
31, 42, 43, 45 and 46. However, when the impact of maximum bandwidth is
considered, the 3rd order IMD products do not fall into the BS receive of Band
24. In addition, at the time of writing, B46 is not assumed to support UL
transmission.
It should be noted that, at the time of writing, Bands 2, 22, 23, 25, 31, 33,
35, 36, 37, 39, 43, 45 and 65 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 11 and 42. Consequently, the focus here will be on
the harmonics and IMD products falling into Bands 1, 11, 21, 34 and 42.
TDD BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously in a single band, the BS's
own Band 42 receiver and other synchronized Band 42 receivers would not be
interfered.
It is recommended that Bands 11 and 42 BS transmitters should not share the
same antenna with Bands 1, 11, 21 and 34 BS receivers unless the antenna path
meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause these Band's BS receivers desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may
be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
Table 6.25.3-3 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
11 + Band 42 CA with 1 UL.

**UE UL carriers** **f1_low** **f1_high** **f2_low** **f2_high** UL frequency

3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 4283.7 to 4343.7 10200 to 10800
* * *
It can be seen that no harmful fall down toward DL bands of interest is
observed in UE side.

### 6.27.2 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1 Band 7
and Band 42 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each band)
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.27.2-1 below:

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 8130 8460
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.27.2-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (1 + 7 + 42) may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 11,21 and 45. As B42 is a TDD band, simultaneous
Tx/Rx for the same band will not happen. So the IMD and harmonic impact to B42
needs not to be considered
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Bands 11, 21 or 45
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Band (1 + 7 + 42) BS
transmitter does not share the same antenna with Bands 11, 21 or 45 BS
receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (1 +7 + 42) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Bands 11, 21 or 45 BS receiver if the
aforementioned BS transmit configurations are used unless the antenna path
meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause Bands 11, 21 or 45 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna
sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the
future.

### 6.28.2 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3 Band 7
and Band 42 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each band)
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.28.2-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.28.2-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (3 + 7 + 42) may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20, 26, 38 and 41\. As B42 is a
TDD band, simultaneous Tx/Rx for the same band will not happen. So the IMD and
harmonic impact to B42 needs not to be considered
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Bands 5, 7, 8, 18, 19,
20, 26, 38 and 41 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor
eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Band (3
+ 7 + 42) BS transmitter does not share the same antenna with Bands 5, 7, 8,
18, 19, 20, 26, 38 and 41 BS receiver.Therefore, it is recommended that Band
(1 +7 + 42) BS transmitter should not share the same antenna with Bands 5, 7,
8, 18, 19, 20, 26, 38 and 41 BS receiver if the aforementioned BS transmit
configurations are used unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order
PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Bands 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20,
26, 38 and 41 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be
allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.

in single carrier mode.
### 6.29.2 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1 Band
20 and Band 42 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.29.2-1 below:

IMD frequency limits (MHz) 6301 6591
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.29.2-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (1 + 20 + 42) may fall
into the BS receive band of Bands 30, 31, 34 and 40. However, Band 30 is not
intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 1, 20and 42.
Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into
Bands 31, 34 and 40. As B42 is a TDD band, simultaneous Tx/Rx for the same
band will not happen. So the IMD and harmonic impact to B42 needs not to be
considered
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Bands 31, 34 and 40
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Band (1 + 20 + 42) BS
transmitter does not share the same antenna with Bands 31, 34 and 40 BS
receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (1 + 20 + 42) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Bands 31, 34 and 40 BS receiver if the
aforementioned BS transmit configurations are used unless the antenna path
meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause Bands 31, 34 and 40 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna
sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the
future.6.29.3 ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB,c values
For the UE which supports CA_1A-20A-42A the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are defined

for use in the same geographical area as Bands 3, 20and 42. Therefore, the
focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Bands 5, 7, 8, 12,

BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (3 + 20 + 42) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Bands 5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 28, 38, 40,

share the same antenna with Bands 3, 4, 9, 24, 46 and 66 BS receiver if the
aforementioned BS transmit configurations are used unless the antenna path
meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause Bands 3, 4, 9, 24, 46 and 66 BS receiver desensitization. Note that
antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in
the future.6.31.3 ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB,c values
For the UE which supports CA_7A-20A-42A the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are defined

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

CA_7A-46C | 7 |  |  | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | 60 | 0  
| 46 | See the CA_46C Bandwidth combination set 1 in Table 5.6A.1-1 of TS 36.101 |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating
in single carrier mode.
### 6.32.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 7, Band
46 and Band 46 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.32.3-1 below:
Table 6.32.3-1: Band 7, Band 46 and Band 46 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f1_low f1_high f2_low f2_high DL frequency (MHz) 2620 2690 5150
5925 3rd order IMD products (with maximum channel bandwidth) (f1_low --
f2_BWmax) (f1_high + f2_BWmax) (f2_low -- f1_BWmax) (f2_high + f1_BWmax) IMD
frequency limits (MHz) 2580 2730 5130 5945
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.32.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, if the
BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 20MHz DL in Band 7 and 40MHz DL in
Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will fall into same
BS receive band of Bands 38 and 41. Therefore the Bands 38 and 41 shall be
considered for IMD products.
It is recommended that Bands 7 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with bands of Band 38 and 41 BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will
not cause Band 38 and 41 BS receiver desensitization.
### 6.32.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports CA_7A-46C the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.32.4-1 and 6.32.4-2 respectively assuming separate
antenna architecture:

As shown in Table 6.33.3.1-2, 2^nd^ order intermodulation products may fall to
UL frequencies of Band 3, 4, 9, 10, 22, 42, 46 and 66. The 3^rd^
intermodulation products may fall to UL frequencies of Band 5, 6, 8, 18, 19,
20, 26, 38 and 41. It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of Band 5 and
Band 7 should not share the same antenna with Band 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 18,
19, 20, 22, 26, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46 and 66 BS receiver, unless the antenna path
meets very stringent third order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause Band 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 38, 41, 42, 44, 46 and 66

#### 6.33.3.2 For the UE
As shown in the table 6.33.3.2-1, the 3^rd^ harmonic of Band 5 will fall into
DL of band 41. For UE coexistence the single UL is already considered for
these bands in TS 36.101.And alo none of the products falls into the B3, B5 or
B40 UE receiving bands.

### 6.34.3 Co-existence studies
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting CA_3C-8A DL carriers can be calculated as shown in Table 6.34.3-1
below:

It can be seen from Table 6.34.3-1 that the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting
in Band 8 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 2, 25, 33, 35, 37, 39.
The 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Band 3 may fall into the BS receive
band of Band 43 and the 3^rd^ harmonics may fall into the BS receive band of
Band 46.
The 3^rd^ IMD products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 3,
Band 3 and Band 8 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 2, 3, 8, 9, 20,
25, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, and 66. Note that the calculation in Table
6.34.3-1 (except the last row) assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole
DL frequency of Band 3 and Band 8. If the BS is only transmitting an up to 40
MHz DL in Band 3 and an up to 10 MHz DL in Band 3, then the 3^rd^ IMD products
will not fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 9, 20, 33, 37, and 66as
shown in the last row in Table 6.34.3-1.
Note that Bands 2, 9, 25, 35, 37, 66 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 3 and 8. Therefore, the focus here is on the
harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 8, 39, 41, 43 and 46, taking into account
maximum bandwidth to be used for this combination.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 8,
39, 41, 43 and 46 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor
eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that
CA_3C-8A BS transmitter does not share the same antenna with Band 8, 39, 41,
43 or 46 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that CA_3C-8A BS transmitter should not share the
same antenna with Band 8, 39, 41, 43 or 46 BS receiver, in order to prevent BS
receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 2^nd^
and 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 8, 39,
41, 43 or 46 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be
allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
### 6.34.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports CA_3C-8A the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined in the
same way as CA_3A-8A for applicable bands in Table 6.34.4-1and Table 6.34.4-2
respectively.

(the requirements specified in clause 7.3.1 (TS36.101) apply).

### 6.35.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 2, Band
7 and Band 7 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each band)
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.35.3-1 below:

IMD frequency limits (MHz) 7170 7370
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.35.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (2 + 7 + 7) may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 22, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 42 and
65. However, Bands 1, 22, 23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39 and 65 are not intended
for use in the same geographical area as Bands 2 and 7\. Therefore, the focus
here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Bands 2, 25 and 42.
Note that the 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into the BS own (20 MHz)
receive block within Band 2. Assume that the 3 carriers transmitted by the
Band (2+7+ 7) BS are a, b and c MHz in channel bandwidth and d, e and f MHz
from the lower edges of Bands 2 and 7 DL frequency bands as shown in Figure
6.35.3-1 below:
{width="6.688194444444444in" height="1.4708333333333334in"}
Figure 6.35.3-1: 3 carriers transmitted by the Band (2 + 7 + 7) BS
And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 6.35.3-2 below:
{width="6.688194444444444in" height="1.4708333333333334in"}
Figure 6.35.3-2: 3 carriers received by the Band (2 + 7 + 7) BS
Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.35.3-2 below:
Table 6.35.3-2: Band (2 + 7 + 7) BS DL 3^rd^ order IMD products

* * *
Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 6.35.3-2 with the BS receive
blocks in Figure 6.35.3-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD products
caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC will only fall into the BS own
receive block of Band 2 under one of the transmit configurations shown in
Table 6.35.3-3 below:

### 6.61.5 MSD

Since the MSD requirement is already specified for CA_1A-3A in the current

### 6.62.5 MSD
Taking actual spectrum holding into account, the MSD requirement for
CA_21A-28A was specified as N/A in the TS 36.101 [6]. Thus, it is also
reasonable for CA_1A-21A-28A to define the requirement based on the same
principle.

### 6.63.3 Co-existence studies for 3DL/1UL
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1, Band
28 and Band 42 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.63.3-1 below:

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 6268 6573
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.63.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3rd
order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (1 + 28 + 42) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 12, 17, 23, 28, 31, 34, 36, 44, 65 and 68, where
receiver desensitization might be an issue. Therefore, it is recommended that
Bands 1, 28 and 42 BS transmitters should not share the same antenna with Band
12, 17, 23, 28, 31, 65, 68 or unsynchronized Band 34, 36, 44 BS receivers,
unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so
that the PIM will not cause the BS receivers desensitization.

### 6.63.5 MSD
Since the MSD requirements are already specified for CA_1A-28A and CA_28A-42A
in the current specification, it is also reasonable for CA_1A-28A-42A to
define the requirement based on the same principle.

### 6.64.3 Co-existence studies for 3DL/1UL
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3, Band
19 and Band 21 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.64.3-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.64.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3rd
order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (3 + 19 + 21) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 7 and 41, where receiver desensitization might be an
issue. Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 3, 19 and 21 BS transmitters
should not share the same antenna with Band 7 and 41 BS receivers, unless the
antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM
will not cause the BS receivers desensitization.

It can be seen from Table 6.65.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3rd
order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (3 + 21 + 28) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 7, 31, 38 and 41, where receiver desensitization
might be an issue. Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 3, 21 and 28 BS
transmitters should not share the same antenna with Band 7, 31 or
unsynchronized Band 38, 41 BS receivers, unless the antenna path meets very
stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the BS
receivers desensitization.

### 6.65.5 MSD
Taking actual spectrum holding into account, the MSD requirement for
CA_21A-28A was specified as N/A in the TS 36.101. Thus, it is also reasonable
for CA_3A-21A-28A to define the requirement based on the same principle.

### 6.66.3 Co-existence studies for 3DL/1UL
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3, Band
21 and Band 42 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.66.3-1 below:

It can be seen from Table 6.66.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3rd
order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (3 + 21 + 42) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 43, where receiver desensitization might be an issue.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 3, 21 and 42 BS transmitters should
not share the same antenna with unsynchronized Band 43 BS receivers, unless
the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the
PIM will not cause the BS receivers desensitization.

inter-band CA

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 [6] when
operating in single carrier mode.
### 6.67.3 Co-existence studies for 3DL/1UL
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3, Band
28 and Band 42 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.67.3-1 below:
Table 6.67.3-1: Band 3, Band 28 and Band 42 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f1-low f1-high f2-low f2-high f3-low f3-high DL frequency (MHz)
1805 1880 758 803 3400 3600
3^rd^ order IMD products (f1-low + f2-low -- f3-high) (f1-high + f2-high --
f3-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 717 1037
3^rd^ order IMD products (f1-low + f3-low -- f2-high) (f1-high + f3-high --
f2-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 4402 4722
3^rd^ order IMD products (f2-low + f3-low -- f1-high) (f2-high + f3-high --
f1-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 2278 2598
3^rd^ order IMD products (f1-low + f2-low + f3-low) (f1-high + f2-high +
f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 5963 6283
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.67.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3rd
order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (3 + 28 + 42) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 30, 38,
40, 41, 44 and 68, where receiver desensitization might be an issue.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 3, 28 and 42 BS transmitters should
not share the same antenna with Band 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27,
28, 68 or unsynchronized Band 38, 40, 41, 44 BS receivers, unless the antenna
path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause the BS receivers desensitization.

### 6.67.5 MSD
Since the MSD requirement is already specified for CA_3A-42A and CA_28A-42A in
the current specification, it is also reasonable for CA_3A-28A-42A to define
the requirement based on the same principle.

operating in single carrier mode
### 6.68.3 Co-existence studies for 3DL/1UL
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 21, Band
28 and Band 42 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.68.3-1 below:
Table 6.68.3-1: Band 21, Band 28 and Band 42 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products

3^rd^ order IMD products (f1-low + f3-low -- f2-high) (f1-high + f3-high --
f2-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 4092.9 4352.9
3^rd^ order IMD products (f2-low + f3-low -- f1-high) (f2-high + f3-high --
f1-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 2647.1 2907.1

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 5653.9 5913.9
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.68.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3rd
order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (21 + 28 + 42) may fall into the
BS receive band of Band 41, where receiver desensitization might be an issue.
Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 21, 28 and 42 BS transmitters should
not share the same antenna with unsynchronized Band 41 BS receivers, unless
the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the

### 6.68.5 MSD
Taking actual spectrum holding into account, the MSD requirement for
CA_21A-28A was specified as N/A in the TS 36.101. Thus, it is also reasonable
for CA_21A-28A-42A to define the requirement based on the same principle.

### 6.69.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.69.3-1 only give the intermodulation products for CA_8A-46C by
considering the maximum bandwidth supported by CA_8A-46C, which is 10MHz for
Band 8 and 40MHz for Band 46. The UL/DL harmonic products and the other
intermodulation products can be referred to fall back mode such as CA_8A-46A,
included in TR 36.714-02-01.
Table 6.69.3-1: 3DLs CA of Band 8, Band 46 and Band 46 IMD products frequency
limits
* * *
**DL frequency** **f1_low** **f1_high** **f2_low** **f2_high** **925** **960**
**5150** **5925** 3^rd^ order IMD products (with maximum channel bandwidth)
\|f1_low -- max BW f2\| \|f1_high + max BW f2\| \|f2_low -- max BW f1\|
\|f2_high + max BW f1\| IMD frequency limits (MHz) 885 1000 5140 5935
* * *
It can be seen from the Table 6.69.3-1 that the 3rd order IMD products are
only fall into the BS receive of Bands 8 and 46.
There is no UL for Band 46, thus it is no need to consider the influence for
Band 46 BS receiver desensitization.
It is recommended that Bands 8 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Band 8 BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will not
cause Band 8 BS receiver desensitization.
### 6.69.4 ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB,c values
For the UE which supports CA_8A-46C, the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.69.4-1 and 6.69.4-2 respectively assuming separate
antenna architecture.

### 6.70.3 Co-existence studies
#### 6.70.3.1 For the BS
Table 6.70.3-1 give the DL harmonic frequency limits for CA_8B-46A.
Table 6.70.3.1-1: DL harmonics products frequency limits for 3DL CA of Band 8,
Band 8 and Band 46
* * *
**BS DL carriers** **f1_low** **f1_high** **f2_low** **f2_high** DL frequency

1920 10300 to 11850  
3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 2775 to 2880 15450 to 17775
* * *
It can be seen from the table 6.70.3.1-1 that:
\- The 2nd order harmonics of the Band 8 BS transmitting may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 2, 25, 33, 35, 37 and 39
\- No 3rd harmonics will fall into the other BS receiver bands.
Table 6.70.3.1-2 give the intermodulation products for CA_8B-46A.

* * *
It can be seen from the Table 6.70.3.1-2 that:
\- No 2nd order IMD products will fall into the BS receive Bands.
\- The 3rd order IMD products may fall into BS receive Bands of 3\~6, 8,
10\~14, 17\~22, 24, 26\~28, 31, 42\~45, 66, 68 and 70.
However, when the impact of maximum bandwidth is considered, the 3rd order IMD
products are only fall into the BS receive of Bands 8 and 46.
It should be noted that Bands 2, 25, 33, 35 and 37 are not intended for use in
the same region. Consequently, the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD
products falling into Bands 8, 39 and 46.
There is no UL for Band 46, thus it is no need to consider the influence for
Band 46 BS receiver desensitization.
It is recommended that Bands 8 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 8 and 39 BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will
not cause Bands 8 and 39 BS receiver desensitization.
#### 6.70.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.70.3.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
8, Band 8 and Band 46 CA for UE. Only 6^th^ harmonic of Band 8 will fall into
Band 46.

For the UE which supports CA_8B-46A the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.70.4-1 and 6.70.4-2 respectively assuming separate
antenna architecture.

### 6.71.3 Co-existence studies
#### 6.71.3.1 For the BS
The IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1, Band 5 and Band
46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in table 6.71.3.1-1 below:
Table 6.71.3.1-1: Band 1, Band 5 and Band 46 3rd order IMD products

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 8129 8989
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.71.3.1-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (1 + 5 + 46) may fall into
BS receive band of Bands 7, 30, 38, 40 and 41.
It is recommended that Band (1+5+46) BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with Bands 7, 30, 38, 40 and 41 BS receivers unless the antenna path
meets very stringent third order PIM specification so that the antenna PIM
will not cause Bands 7, 30, 38, 40 and 41 BS receiver desensitization.
#### 6.71.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.71.3.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
1 or Band 5 for UE. It can be concluded that there is an issue on 3^rd^
harmonic interference from Band 1 UL to Band 46 DL and 7^th^ harmonic
interference from Band 5 UL to Band 46 DL.

### 6.71.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports CA_1A-5A-46A the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are defined
for applicable bands in Table 6.71.4-1 and 6.71.4-2 respectively. The ΔR~IB,c~
for Band 46 is not specified as it is considered already in REFSENS
requirements for this combination.

For the REFSENS of 3DL/1UL CA_1A-5A-46A, the requirements are shown in table
6.71.5-1 with the uplink configuration in table 6.71.5-2. The ∆F~HD~ value
depends on which licensed band is used for uplink transmission for this band
combination as it is captured in following Reference sensitivity table. The
MSD values impact to Band 46 due to harmonics from transmission of licensed
band are captured from WF on MSD for Band 46[1] and shown in table 6.71.5-3.

### 6.72.3 Co-existence studies
#### 6.72.3.1 For the BS
The IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1, Band 7 and Band
46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in table 6.72.3.1-1 below:
Table 6.72.3.1-1: Band 1, Band 7 and Band 46 3rd order IMD products

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 9880 10785
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.72.3.1-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (1 + 7 + 46) may fall into
BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 31,
44 and 68.
It is recommended that Band (1+7+46) BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 31, 44 and
68 BS receivers unless the antenna path meets very stringent third order PIM
specification so that the antenna PIM will not cause Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13,
14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 31, 44 and 68 BS receiver desensitization.
#### 6.72.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.72.3.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
1 or Band 7 for UE. It can be concluded that there is an issue on 3^rd^
harmonic interference from Band 1 UL to Band 46 DL.

### 6.72.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports CA_1A-7A-46A the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are defined
for applicable bands in Table 6.72.4-1 and 6.72.4-2 respectively. The ΔR~IB,c~
for Band 46 is not specified as it is considered already in REFSENS
requirements for this combination.

### 6.72.5 REFSENS requirements
For the REFSENS of 3DL/1UL CA_1A-7A-46A, the requirements are shown in table
6.72.5-1 with the uplink configuration in table 6.72.5-2. The ∆F~HD~ value
depends on which licensed band is used for uplink transmission for this band
combination as it is captured in following Reference sensitivity table. The
MSD values impact to Band 46 due to harmonics from transmission of licensed
band are captured from WF on MSD for Band 46[1] and shown in table 6.72.5-3.

### 6.73.3 Co-existence studies
#### 6.73.3.1 For the BS
The IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 5, Band 7 and Band
46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in table 6.73.3.1-1 below:
Table 6.73.3.1-1: Band 5, Band 7 and Band 46 3rd order IMD products

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 8639 9509
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.73.3.1-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (5 + 7 + 46) may fall into
BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 65, 66 and 70.
It is recommended that Band (5+7+46) BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,
39, 40, 42, 43, 65, 66 and 70 BS receivers unless the antenna path meets very
stringent third order PIM specification so that the antenna PIM will not cause
Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42,
43, 65, 66 and 70 BS receiver desensitization.
#### 6.73.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.73.3.2-1 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
5 or Band 7 for UE. It can be concluded that there is an issue on 7^th^
harmonic interference from Band 5 UL to Band 46 DL.

### 6.73.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports CA_5A-7A-46A the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are defined
for applicable bands in Table 6.73.4-1 and 6.73.4-2 respectively. The ΔR~IB,c~
for Band 46 is not specified as it is considered already in REFSENS
requirements for this combination.

### 6.73.5 REFSENS requirements
For the REFSENS of 3DL/1UL CA_5A-7A-46A, the requirements are shown in table
6.73.5-1 with the uplink configuration in table 6.73.5-2. The ∆F~HD~ value
depends on which licensed band is used for uplink transmission for this band
combination as it is captured in following Reference sensitivity table. The
MSD values impact to Band 46 due to harmonics from transmission of licensed
band are captured from WF on MSD for Band 46[1] and shown in table 6.73.5-3.

### 6.74.3 Co-existence studies
#### 6.74.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products generated by BS transmitting 3DL CA at Band 1,
Band 7 and Band 7 DL carriers are shown in Table 6.74.3.1-1 below.

* * *
As shown in Table 6.74.3.1-1, in addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD
product from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ intermodulation
products generated by BS supporting 3DL CA of Band (1+7+7) fall into none of
the BS receive bands. Therefore, if the aforementioned BS transmit
configurations are used, we can conclude no issue on the DL 3^rd^ order IMD
interference.
#### 6.74.3.2 For the UE
For single UL the 2nd and 3rd harmonic analysis for B1 and B7 is already done
in the 2DL/1UL TR 36.851. As shown in the table 6.74.3.2-1, none of the
products falls into the B1 or B7 UE receiving bands. For UE coexistence the
single UL is already considered for these bands in TS 36.101.

As shown in Table 6.75.3.1-1, in addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD
product from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ intermodulation
products generated by BS supporting 3DL CA of Band (5+7+7) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20, 26,27 and 44.
It is recommended that the Band (5 + 7 + 7) BS transmitter should not share
the same antenna with Band 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27 and 44 BS receiver, in
order to prevent BS receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets
very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band
5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27 and 44 BS receiver desensitization. Furthermore,
sharing antenna for CA operation between Band 5 and Band 7 is not recommended.
Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to
evolve in the future.
#### 6.75.3.2 For the UE
For single UL the 2nd and 3rd harmonic analysis for B5 and B7 is already done

#### 6.76.3.1 CA_29A-66C
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 29 and Band 66 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
Table 6.10.3.1-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.7.3-1 the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in
Band 29 may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 11, 21 and 45, while the
2^nd^ IMD products supporting CA of Band 29 and Band 66 may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 11, 21 and 45, and the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into
the BS receive band of Bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 26, 27, 28, 42, 43, 44 and
68. Note that the calculation in Table 6.76.3.1-1 (except the last row)
assumes the BS is transmitting with the whole 11 MHz DL frequency of Band 29
and the whole 90 MHz DL frequency of Band 66. If the BS is only transmitting
up to 10 MHz DL in Band 29 and up to 40 MHz DL in Band 66 as stated in the
WIDS, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will not fall into the BS receive band of
Band 13, 14, 18, 26 or 27 as shown in the last row in Table 6.7.3-1.
Note that Bands 11, 21, 28, 44, 45 and 68 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 29 and 66. Therefore, the focus here is on the
harmonics and IMD falling into Bands 12, 17, 42 and 43.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 12,
17, 42 or 43 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating
the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 29 and 66 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 12, 17, 42 or 43 BS
receiver.
Therefore, in order to prevent BS receiver desensitization, it is recommended
that Bands 29 and 66 BS transmitters should not share the same antenna with
Band 12, 17, 42 or 43 BS receiver unless the antenna path meets very stringent
3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 12, 17, 42
or 43 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as
the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
#### 6.76.3.2 CA_29A-66A-66A
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of CA_29A-66A-66A DL carriers can be calculated as shown in Table
6.76.3.2-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.76.3.2-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA_29A-66A-66A may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 26, 27, 28, 42, 43, 44 and 68.
Note that Bands 18, 28, 44 and 68 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 29 and 66. Therefore, the focus here is on the IMD
falling into Bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 26, 27, 42 and 43.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 12,
13, 14, 17, 26, 27, 42 or 43 receiver would be well below the receiver noise
floor eliminating the possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that
Bands 29 and 66 BS transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 12,
13, 14, 17, 26, 27, 42 or 43 BS receiver..
Therefore, in order to prevent BS receiver desensitization, it is recommended
that Bands 29 and 66 BS transmitters should not share the same antenna with
Band 12, 13, 14, 17, 26, 27, 42 or 43 BS receiver, unless the antenna path
meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause Band 12, 13, 14, 17, 26, 27, 42 or 43 receiver desensitization. Note
that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to
evolve in the future.
### 6.76.4 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
CA_29A-66C and CA_29A-66A-66A are formed by diplexing a carrier in Band 29
with the intra-band carriers in Band 66. No harmonic terms overlap with
downlink in Band 29 from uplink in Band 66. The diplexer relaxations ∆T~IB~ =
0.3 dB, ∆R~IB~ = 0 dB apply with no MSD or reference sensitivity exceptions.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 28 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.77.3-2 below:

It can be seen from table 6.77.3-2 that:
\- the 2^nd^ harmonics of BS transmitting in Bands 28 and 46 may fall into
none of the BS receive band of 3GPP
\- the 3^rd^ harmonic may fall into BS receive band of Bands 30, 40
\- the 2^nd^ IMD products may fall into none of the BS receive band of 3GPP
\- the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into BS receive Bands 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13,
14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 31, 42, 43, 44, 45, 68
Note that the calculation in table 6.77.3-2 (except the last row) assumes the
BS transmits the whole 45 and 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 28 and Band 46
respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 20 MHz and 40 MHz DL in Band 28 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.77.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 5, 6, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27,
28, 42, 43, 44, 68 as shown in the last row in table 6.77.3-2.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 26,
27, 43 and 45 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands
28 and 46. This leaves Bands 5, 8, 20, 21, 28, 31, 42, 44 and 68 to consider
for IMD products.
It is recommended that Bands 28 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 5, 8, 20, 21, 28, 31, 42, 44 and 68 BS receivers so
that the antenna PIM will not cause Bands 5, 8, 20, 21, 28, 31, 42, 44 and 68
BS receiver desensitization.
### 6.77.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports CA_28A-46C the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ are defined for

### 6.77.5 MSD
For this CA configuration, the 7^th^ and 8^th^ harmonic of Band 28 falls into
Band 46. Nevertheless, HTF should not be applied for this CA combination in
order to avoid additional insertion loss for the licensed band. In this case,
the frequency gap to avoid MSD in Band 46 and the UL configuration are
specified as shown in table 6.77.4-1 and 6.77.4-2.

The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 40 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.78.3-2 below:

(f2_high + f1_BWmax) IMD frequency limits (MHz) 2260 2440 5130 5945
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.78.3-2 that:
\- the 2^nd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 22, 42
and 43.
\- the 3^rd^ IMD products may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30,
31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, 65, 66, 68 and 70.
assuming (except the last row) the whole 100 MHz DL frequency of Band 40 and
the whole 775 MHz DL frequency of Band 46.
If the BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 20 MHz DL in Band 40 and 40MHz
DL in Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will still
fall into same BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20,
22, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 38, 40, 42, 43, 44 and 68.
In addition, it should be noted that Bands 5, 8, 13, 20, 22, 26, 28, 31, 40,
42, 43, 44 and 68 are possibly intended for use in the same geographical area
(country) as Bands 40 and 46. Therefore the Bands 5, 8, 13, 20, 22, 26, 28,
40, 42, 43, 44 and 68 shall be considered for IMD products.
It is recommended that Bands 40 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with band of Bands 5, 8, 13, 20, 22, 26, 28, 31, 40, 42, 43, 44 and 68
BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will not cause Bands5, 8, 13, 20, 22, 26,
28, 31, 40, 42, 43, 44 and 68 BS receiver desensitization.

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating
in single carrier mode.
### 6.79.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1, Band
46 and Band 46 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.79.3-1 below:
Table 6.79.3-1: Band 1, Band 46 and Band 46 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f1_low f1_high f2_low f2_high DL frequency (MHz) 2110 2170 5150
5925 3rd order IMD products (with maximum channel bandwidth) (f1_low --
f2_BWmax) (f1_high + f2_BWmax) (f2_low -- f1_BWmax) (f2_high + f1_BWmax) IMD
frequency limits (MHz) 2070 2210 5130 5945
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.79.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, if the
BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 20MHz DL in Band 1 and 40MHz DL in
Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will fall into none
of the BS receive bands. Therefore, if the aforementioned BS transmit
configurations are used, we can conclude no issue on the DL 3^rd^ order IMD
interference in addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD products from the
constituent 2DL CA configurations.
### 6.79.4 ΔTIB,c and ΔRIB,c values
For the UE which supports CA_1A-46C the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.79.4-1 and 6.79.4-2 respectively assuming separate
antenna architecture without HTF:

NOTE 5: The requirements do not apply when there is at least one individual RE
within the uplink transmission bandwidth of the lower band for which the
transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission bandwidth of the
higher band and a range ∆F~HD~ above and below the edge of this downlink
transmission bandwidth. The value ∆F~HD~ depends on the E-UTRA configuration:
∆F~HD~ = [15] MHz for CA_xA-46C (x=1, 2, 3 and 4), for **CA_46A-66A** **and
for CA_46D-66A** for 3rd harmonic. FFS MHz for other configurations listed.

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
CA Configuration | E-UTRA Bands | 1.4 MHz | 3 MHz | 5 MHz | 10 MHz | 15 MHz | 20 MHz |  |   
CA_5A-46C | 5 |  |  | Yes | Yes |  |  | 50 | 1  
| 46 | See the CA_46C Bandwidth combination set 1 in Table 5.6A.1-1 of TS 36.101 |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for
carrier aggregation, the UE shall support all single carrier bandwidths for
the constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating
in single carrier mode.
### 6.80.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 5, Band
46 and Band 46 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.80.3-1 below:
Table 6.80.3-1: Band 5, Band 46 and Band 46 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f1_low f1_high f2_low f2_high DL frequency (MHz) 869 894 5150
5925 3rd order IMD products (with maximum channel bandwidth) (f1_low --

frequency limits (MHz) 829 934 5140 5935
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.80.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, if the
BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 10MHz DL in Band 5 and 40MHz DL in
Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will fall into same
BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20 and 26. In addition, it should be
noted that Bands 6, 18 and 19 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area (country) as Bands 5 and 46. This leaves Band 5, 8, 20 and
26 to consider for IMD products.
In addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD products from the constituent
2DL CA configurations, it is recommended that Bands 5 and 46 BS transmitters
do not share the same antenna with bands of Band 5, 8, 20 and 26 BS receivers
so that the antenna PIM will not cause Band 5, 8, 20 and 26 BS receiver
desensitization.

For the UE which supports CA_5A-46C the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.80.4-1 and 6.80.4-2 respectively assuming separate

NOTE 5: The requirements do not apply when there is at least one individual RE
within the uplink transmission bandwidth of the lower band for which the
transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission bandwidth of the
higher band and a range ∆F~HD~ above and below the edge of this downlink
transmission bandwidth. The value ∆F~HD~ depends on the E-UTRA configuration:
∆F~HD~ = [15] MHz for CA_xA-46C (x=1, 2, 3 and 4), for **CA_46A-66A** **and
for CA_46D-66A** for 3rd harmonic. FFS MHz for other configurations listed.

The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 40, Band
40 and Band 46 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each

It can be seen from table 6.81.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, if the
BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 40MHz DL in Band 40 and 20MHz DL in
Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will fall into same

30 is not intended for use in the same geographical area (country) as Bands 40
and 46. This leaves Band 40 to consider for IMD products.
In addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD products from the constituent

BS receive band of Bands 30 and 40. In addition, it should be noted that Band
30 is not intended for use in the same geographical area (country) as Bands 40
and 46. This leaves Band 40 to consider for IMD products.
In addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD products from the constituent
2DL CA configurations, it is recommended that Bands 40 and 46 BS transmitters
do not share the same antenna with bands of Band 40 BS receiver so that the
antenna PIM will not cause Band 40 BS receiver desensitization.

For the UE which supports CA_40A-46C the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.82.4-1 and 6.82.4-2 respectively assuming separate
antenna architecture without HTF:

### 6.83.3 Co-existence studies
The harmonic frequencies are observed in table 6.83.3-1. Therefore we can
conclude that there is an issue on 3^rd^ harmonic interference from Band 13 UL
to Band 46 DL. It was agreed not to apply HTF for this CA combination. How to
treat MSD requirements is FFS.
**Table 6.83.3-1: Impact of UL/DL Harmonic Interference**

                                                                                                           **2^nd^ Harmonic**     **3^rd^ Harmonic**      **2^nd^ Harmonic**     **3^rd^ Harmonic**

* * *
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of Band 13 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in
table 6.83.3-2 below:
Table 6.83.3-2 Band 13 and Band 46 DL harmonics and IMD products
* * *
**BS DL carriers** **f1_low** **f1_high** **f2_low** **f2_high** DL frequency

* * *
It can be seen from table 6.83.3-2 that some 3^rd^ IMD products fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
26, 27, 28, 31, 43, 44, 45, and 68. Note that the calculation in table
6.83.3-2 (except the last row) assumes the BS transmits the whole 10 and 775
MHz DL frequency of Band 13 and Band 46 respectively.
If the BS only transmits up to 10MHz and 40 MHz DL in Band 13 and Band 46
respectively as stated in Table 6.83.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD products may still
fall into the BS receive band of the Bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 28, 43, 44 and 68
as shown in the last row in table 6.83.3-2.
The following Bands 28, 43, 44, and 68 are not used in the same geographical
area, therefore, it is recommended that Bands 13 and 46 BS transmitters should
not share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd
order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the BS receiver
desensitisations in Band 12, 13, 14 and 17.

It can be seen from Table 6.84.3-2 that the 3^rd^ order IMD products
supporting 3 DL CA of Band (2A-46A-46A) may fall into the BS receive band of
Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38,
39, 40, 41, 45, 65, 66. However, Bands 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 21, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40,
45 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 2A and 46A
and 46A. Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 2A and 46A and 46A BS
transmitters should not share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets
very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the
BS receiver desensitisations in Band 2, 4, 10, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 36, 37, 41,
65, 66.

NOTE 1: The requirements do not apply when there is at least one individual RE
within the uplink transmission bandwidth of the lower band for which the
transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission bandwidth of the
higher band and a range ∆F~HD~ above and below the edge of this downlink

### 6.85.3 Co-existence studies
The harmonic frequencies are observed in table 6.85.3-1. Therefore we can
conclude that there is an issue on 3^rd^ harmonic interference from Band 4 UL
to Band 46 DL. MSD value without HTF is provided in 6.85.5.
**Table 6.85.3-1: Impact of UL/DL Harmonic Interference**

* * *
The 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of
Band 4 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in table 6.85.3-2
below:
Table 6.85.3-2: 4A-46A-46A DL 3^rd^ order IMD products

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 12410 14005
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.85.3-3 that the 3^rd^ order IMD products
supporting 3 DL CA of Band (4A-46A-46A) may fall into the BS receive band of
Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38,
39, 40, 41, 45, 65, 66. However, Bands 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 21, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40,
45 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 4A and 46A
and 46A. Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 4A and 46A and 46A BS
transmitters should not share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets
very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the
BS receiver desensitisations in Band 2, 4, 10, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 36, 37, 41,
65, 66.

mode.
### 6.86.3 Co-existence studies
The harmonic frequencies are observed in table 6.86.3-1. Therefore we can
conclude that there is an issue on 3^rd^ harmonic interference from Band 66 UL
to Band 46 DL. MSD value without HTF is provided in 6.86.5.
**Table 6.86.3-1: Impact of UL/DL Harmonic Interference**

* * *
The 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of
Band 66 and Band 46 DL carriers can be calculated as shown in table 6.86.3-2
below:

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 12410 14050
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.86.3-3 that the 3^rd^ order IMD products
supporting 3 DL CA of Band (66A-46A-46A) may fall into the BS receive band of
Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21, 23, 24, 25, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38,
39, 40, 41, 45, 65, 66. However, Bands 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 21, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40,
45 are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 66A and 46A
and 46A. Therefore, it is recommended that Bands 66A and 46A and 46A BS
transmitters should not share the same antenna, unless the antenna path meets
very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause the
BS receiver desensitisations in Band 2, 4, 10, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 36, 37, 41,
65, 66.

NOTE 1: The requirements do not apply when there is at least one individual RE
within the uplink transmission bandwidth of the lower band for which the
transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission bandwidth of the
higher band and a range ∆F~HD~ above and below the edge of this downlink
transmission bandwidth. The value ∆F~HD~ depends on the E-UTRA configuration:
∆F~HD~ = **[15] MHz** **for CA_xA-46A-46A (x=1, 2, 3, and 4) and for
CA_46A-46A-66A for 3^rd^ harmonic.** FFS MHz for the other configuations

### 6.87.3 Harmonics and IMD study
#### 6.87.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1, Band
3 and Band 11 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.87.3.1-1 below:
Table 6.87.3.1-1: Band 1, Band 3 and Band 11 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products

f3-high\|  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 5390.9 5545.9
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.87.3.1-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (1 + 3 + 11) may fall into
BS receive band of Bands 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 25, 35, 38, 41, 46, 66 and 70.
However, Bands 2, 4, 7, 10, 25, 35, 38, 46, 66 and 70 are not intended for use
in the same geographical area as Bands 1, 3 and 11. Therefore, the focus here
is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Bands 3, 9 and 41.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Bands 3, 9 and 41
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Band (1 + 3 + 11) BS
transmitter does not share the same antenna with Bands 3, 9 and 41 BS
receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (1 + 3 + 11) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Bands 3, 9 and 41 BS receiver to prevent BS
receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^
order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Bands 3, 9 and 41 BS
receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the
state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
#### 6.87.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.87.3.2-1 gives the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic for CA with B1+ B3 + B11.
It is found that none of the products falls into the B1, B3 or B11 UE
receiving bands.

uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the ΔT~IB,c~ is defined for applicable

It can be seen from Table 6.90.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations (already
analysed in CA_3-5, CA_3-40, and CA_5-40), the 3^rd^ order IMD products
supporting 3DL CA of Band (3 + 5 + 40) may fall into the BS receive band of
Bands 11, 21, 22, 31, 42, 45 and 46. However, Bands 11, 21, 22, 31 and 42 are
not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 3, 5 and 40.
Table 6.90.3-2 gives the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic for CA with B3+ B5 + B40.
None of the products falls into the B3, B5 or B40 UE receiving bands. For UE
coexistence the single UL is already considered for these bands in TS 36.101.

The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3, Band

band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.91.3-1 below:

It can be seen from Table 6.91.3-1 that 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics of Band 3 DL
carriers may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 43 and 46, the 3^rd^ order
IMD products supporting 3DL CA of Band (3 + 40 + 40) may fall into the BS
receive band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 25, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 65, 66 and
70.
Table 6.91.3-2 gives the UL 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic for CA with B3+ B40 \+
B40. It can be seen that the UL harmonic frequencies of Band 3 and Band 40 do
not locate within the UE own receive bands. Therefore it can be concluded that
there is no issue on harmonic interference.

It can be seen from Table 6.92.3-1 that 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonics of Band 5 DL
carriers may fall into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9, 10, 38, 41 and
66, the 3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3DL CA of Band (5 + 40 + 40) may
fall into the BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27,
43, and 44.
Note that the 3rd order IMD products may fall into the BS own receive block
within Band 40. A TDD BS cannot transmit and receive simultaneously in a
single band so the own B40 receiver would not be interfered.
Table 6.92.3-2 gives the UL 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic for CA with B5+ B40 \+
B40. It can be seen that the UL harmonic frequencies of Band 5 and Band 40
does not locate within the UE own receive bands, therefore it can be concluded
that there is no issue on harmonic interference.

It can be seen from Table 6.93.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations(already
analysed in CA_5-40, CA_5-41, and CA_40-41), the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order
harmonics products of Band 5 DL carriers may fall into the BS receive band of
Bands 3, 4, 9, 10, 38, 41 and 66, the 2nd order harmonics products of Band 41
DL carriers may fall into the BS receive band of Band 46. The 3^rd^ IMD
products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 5, Band 40 and
Band 41 may fall into the BS receive bands of Bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 28, 44, 46
and 68.
Table 6.93.3-2 gives the UL 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic for CA with B5+ B40 \+
B41. It can be found that the 3^rd^ order harmonics of Band 5 may fall into
the receiver band of Band 41(already analysed in CA_5A-41A). Except the
potential 3^rd^ order harmonics interference from Band 5, none of the products
falls into the B5, B40 or B41 UE receiving bands. For UE coexistence the
single UL is already considered for these bands in TS 36.101.

### 6.95.2 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 2, Band
30 and Band 66 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.95.2-1 below:

IMD frequency limits (MHz) 2080 2240
3^rd^ order IMD products (f2-low + f3-low -- f1-high) (f2-high + f3-high --
f1-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 2470 2630  
3^rd^ order IMD products (f1-low + f2-low + f3-low) (f1-high + f2-high +
f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 6390 6550
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.95.2-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (2 + 30 + 66) may fall
into the BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 38, 41, 66 and 70. As B38
and B41 are TDD bands, simultaneous Tx/Rx for the same band will not happen.
So the IMD and harmonic impact to B38 and B41 need not to be considered.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Bands 3, 4, 7, 9, 10,
66 or 70 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Band (2 + 30 + 66) BS
transmitter does not share the same antenna with Bands 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 66 or
70 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (2 + 30 + 66) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Bands 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 66 or 70 BS receiver if the
aforementioned BS transmit configurations are used unless the antenna path
meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause Bands 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 66 or 70 BS receiver desensitization. Note that
antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in
the future.

The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 12 Band

IMD frequency limits (MHz) 5189 5306
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.96.2-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (12 + 30 + 66) may fall
into the BS receive band of Bands 8 and 43. As B43 is a TDD band, simultaneous
Tx/Rx for the same band will not happen. So the IMD and harmonic impact to B43
need not to be considered.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 8 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Band (12 + 30 \+ 66) BS transmitter does not
share the same antenna with Band 8 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (12 + 30 + 66) BS transmitter should
not share the same antenna with Band 8 BS receiver if the aforementioned BS
transmit configurations are used unless the antenna path meets very stringent
3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Bands 8 BS
receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the
state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.

The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 5, Band

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.97.2-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (5 + 30 + 66) may fall
into the BS receive band of Bands 12, 17, 28, 42, 43, 44 and 68\. As B42, B43
and B44 are TDD bands, simultaneous Tx/Rx for the same band will not happen.
So the IMD and harmonic impact to B42, B43 and B44 need not to be considered.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Bands 12, 17, 28 or 68
receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Band (5 + 30 + 66) BS
transmitter does not share the same antenna with Bands 12, 17, 28 or 68 BS
receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (5 + 30 + 66) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Bands 12, 17, 28 or 68 BS receiver if the
aforementioned BS transmit configurations are used unless the antenna path
meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not
cause Bands 12, 17, 28 or 68 BS receiver desensitization. Note that antenna
sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the

### 6.99.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.99.3-1 gives the harmonic frequency limits for Band 2, Band 7and Band
7 3DL CA. As shown in the table, 2^nd^ order harmonics and 3^rd^ harmonics may
fall into none of the BS receiver band of 3GPP bands.

Table 6.99.3-2 gives the intermodulation products supporting 3 DL CA of Band
2, Band 7 and Band 7. In addition, the maximum transmission bandwidth of 60MHz
(20MHz in Band 2 and 40MHz in Band 7) is considered for the IMD analysis.

It can be seen from the table 6.99.3-2 that the 2nd order IMD products caused
by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 2, Band 7 and Band 7 may fall
into BS receive Band of Bands 12 , 17 , 28 , 44 and 68. The 3rd order IMD
products caused by BS supporting carrier aggregation of Band 2, Band 7 and
Band 7 may fall into BS receive Band of Bands 1, 2, 7, 22, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42 and 65. However, when the impact of maximum bandwidth
is considered, the 3rd order IMD products do not fall into the BS receive of
Band 7.
It should be noted that, at the time of writing, Bands 1, 22, 23, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 39, 44, 65 and 68 are not intended for use in the same geographical
area as Bands 2 and 7. Consequently, the focus here will be on the harmonics
and IMD products falling into Bands 2, 12, 17, 25, 28, 38, 41and 42.
It is recommended that Bands 2 and 7 BS transmitters should not share the same
antenna with Bands 2, 12, 17, 25, 28, 38, 41and 42 BS receivers unless the
antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM
will not cause these Band's BS receivers desensitization. Note that antenna
sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the
future.
Table 6.99.3-3 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band 2
+ Band 7 CA with 1 UL.

3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 5550 to 5730 7500 to 7710
* * *
It can be seen that no harmful fall down toward DL bands of interest is
observed in UE side

It should be noted that, at the time of writing, Bands 4, 10, 24, 66 and 70
are not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 1 and 7\.
Consequently, the focus here will be on the harmonics and IMD products falling
into Bands 3, 31, 38 and 41.
It is recommended that Bands 1 and 7 BS transmitters should not share the same
antenna with Bands 3, 31, 38 and 41 BS receivers unless the antenna path meets
very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause
these Band's BS receivers desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be
allowed as the state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.
Table 6.101.3-3 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
1 + Band 7 CA with 1 UL.

It can be seen that no harmful fall down toward DL bands of interest is
observed in UE side

### 6.104.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 7, Band
46 and Band 46 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.104.3-1 below:
Table 6.104.3-1: Band 7, Band 46 and Band 46 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *

frequency limits (MHz) 2580 2730 5130 5945
* * *
It can be seen from table 6.104.3-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, if the
BS is transmitting with Max bandwidth of 20MHz DL in Band 7 and 40MHz DL in
Band 46 as stated in the WID, then the 3^rd^ IMD products will fall into same
BS receive band of Bands 38 and 41. Therefore the Bands 38 and 41 shall be
considered for IMD products.
It is recommended that Bands 7 and 46 BS transmitters do not share the same
antenna with bands of Band 38 and 41 BS receivers so that the antenna PIM will
not cause Band 38 and 41 BS receiver desensitization.

### 6.105.3 Co-existence studies
#### 6.105.3.1 For the BS
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of CA_1C-3A DL carriers can be calculated as shown in Table
6.105.3.1-1 below:
Table 6.105.3.1-1: CA_1C-3A DL harmonics and IMD products

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.105.3.1-1 that 2^nd^ harmonics may fall to UL
frequencies of Band 43, none 3^rd^ order harmonics may fall into any UL
frequencies of 3GPP Bands. None 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into any UL
frequencies of 3GPP Bands. Taking into account the maximum bandwidths to be
used for this CA combination, 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall to UL
frequencies of Band 2,3,7,9,10,11,21,24,25,33,35,37,39,40,41,45,66. As Bands
2,10,24,25,33,35,37,66 are not intended for use in the same geographical area
(country) as CA_1C-3A , there is no issue with IMD falling to UL frequencies
of Band2,10,24,25,33,35,37,66 .
In addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD products from the constituent
2DL CA configurations,it is suggested that BS transmitters supporting CA of
Band 1 and Band 3 should not share the same antenna with Band
3,7,9,11,21,39,40,41,43 or 45 BS receiver, unless the antenna path meets very
stringent third order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band
3,7,9,11,21,39,40,41,43 or 45 BS receiver desensitization.
#### 6.105.3.2 For the UE
As shown in Table 6.105.3.2-1, the harmonic frequencies of band 1, band 3 in
UL are away from the receive bands of interest in the DL and we can conclude
that there is no issue on UL harmonic interference.

It can be seen from Table 6.113.3.1-2 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3DL CA of Band (1+7+26) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 11 and 21. Bands 11 and 21 are not intended for use
in the same geographical area as bands 1, 7 and 26.

It can be seen from Table 6.114.3.1-2 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3DL CA of Band (3+7+26) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 3, 4, 9, 10, 24, 42, 43, 48 and 66. Bands 4, 9, 10,
24, 42, 43, 48 and 66 are not intended for use in the same geographical area
as bands 3, 7 and 26. As B46 is a TDD band, simultaneous Tx/Rx for the same
band will not happen. Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD
products falling into Bands 3.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that IMD interference generated within the Band 3 receiver would be
well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Band (3+7+26) BS transmitter does not share the
same antenna with Band 3 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (3+7+26) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 3 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 3 BS receiver
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.
#### 6.114.3.2 For the UE
As shown in Table 6.114.3.2-1, the harmonic frequencies of Band 3, Band 7 and
Band 26 in UL are away from the receive bands of interest in the DL and we can
conclude that there is no issue on UL harmonic interference.

NOTE: For the UE that signals support of any bandwidth combination set for

the constituent bands as defined in Table 5.6.1-1 of TS 36.101 when operating
in single carrier mode.
### 6.115.3 Co-existence studies
#### 6.115.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products generated by BS transmitting 3DL CA at Band 7,
Band 7 and Band 26 DL carriers are shown in Table 6.115.3.1-1 below.

* * *
As shown in Table 6.115.3.1-1, in addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD
product from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ intermodulation
products generated by BS supporting 3DL CA of Band (7+7+26) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 5, 6, 8, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26,27 and 44.
It is recommended that the Band (7+26+26) BS transmitter should not share the
same antenna with Band 5, 6, 8, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27 and 44 BS receiver, in
order to prevent BS receiver desensitization, unless the antenna path meets
very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band
5, 6, 8, 14, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27 and 44 BS receiver desensitization.
Furthermore, sharing antenna for CA operation between Band 7 and Band 26 is
not recommended. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.
#### 6.115.3.2 For the UE
For single UL the 2nd and 3rd harmonic analysis for B5 and B7 is already done
in the 2DL/1UL TR 36.851. As shown in the table 6.115.3.2-1, none of the
products falls into the B5 or B7 UE receiving bands. For UE coexistence the
single UL is already considered for these bands in TS 36.101.

### 6.116.3 Harmonics and IMD study
#### 6.116.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 1, Band
11 and Band 28 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.116.3.1-1 below:
Table 6.116.3.1-1: Band 1, Band 11 and Band 28 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products

f3-high\|  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 4343.9 4468.9
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.116.3.1-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (1 + 11 + 28) may fall
into BS receive band of Bands 11, 21 and 45. However, Band 45 is not intended
for use in the same geographical area as Bands 1,11 and 28 and based on
current spectrum holding of 1.5GHz in Japan, it is unlikely to support Band 11
and 21 in a BS. Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products
falling into Band 11.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 11 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Band (1 + 11 + 28) BS transmitter does not
share the same antenna with Band 11 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (1 + 11 + 28) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 11 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 11 BS receiver
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.
#### 6.116.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.116.3.2-1 gives the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic for CA with B1+ B11 \+
B28. It can be seen that distortions caused by 2^nd^ order harmonics of Band
28 located within the pass band of Band 11 and 3^rd^ order of Band 28 within
Band 1. It was already identified in previous work and specified in [6].
Except 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics of Band 28, none of the products falls
into the B1, B11 or B28 UE receiving bands.

### 6.116.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the ΔT~IB,c~ is defined for applicable
bands in Table 6.116.4-1. Note that constituent CAs of 1A-28A and 11A-28A are
subject to HTF (Harmonic Trap Filter) in Band 28 and the values below are
taken this fact into account.

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configuration in
Table 6.116.4-2 with uplink in one E-UTRA band, the minimum requirement for
reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.1-1 (of TS 36.101 [6]) shall be increased
by the amount given in ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 6.116.4-2 for the applicable E-UTRA
bands. Note again that constituent CAs of 1A-28A and 11A-28A are subject to
HTF (Harmonic Trap Filter) in Band 28 and the values below are taken this fact
into account.

### 6.116.5 REFSENS
This CA includes two harmonic issues when the uplink is Band 28. MSDs have
been obtained through the studies of relevant 2DL CAs and the following is the
proposal based on the results. Two sets of uplink configurations are required
to be defined for Band 28 with new notes (Note 4, 5).

### 6.117.3 Harmonics and IMD study
#### 6.117.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3, Band
11 and Band 28 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.117.3.1-1 below:
Table 6.117.3.1-1: Band 3, Band 11 and Band 28 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
BS DL carriers f1-low f1-high f2-low f2-high f3-low f3-high DL frequency (MHz)
758 803 1475.9 1495.9 1805 1880
3^rd^ order IMD products \|f1-high + f2-high -- f3-low\| \|f1-low + f2-low --
f3-high\|  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 353.9 493.9
3^rd^ order IMD products \|f1-low + f3-low -- f2-high\| \|f1-high + f3-high --
f2-low\|  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 1067.1 1207.1
3^rd^ order IMD products \|f2-low + f3-low -- f1-high\| \|f2-high + f3-high --
f1-low\|  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 2477.9 2617.9
3^rd^ order IMD products \|f1-low + f2-low + f3-low\| \|f1-high + f2-high +
f3-high\|  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 4038.9 4178.9
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.117.3.1-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (3 + 11 + 28) may fall
into BS receive band of Bands 7, 31, 38 and 41. However, Band 7, 31 and 38 are
not intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 3,11 and 28.
Therefore, the focus here is on the 3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Band
41.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 41 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Band (3 + 11 + 28) BS transmitter does not
share the same antenna with Band 41 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (3 + 11 + 28) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 41 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 41 BS receiver
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.
#### 6.117.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.117.3.2-1 gives the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic for CA with B3+ B11 \+
B28. It can be seen that distortions caused by 2^nd^ order harmonics of Band
28 located within the pass band of Band 11. It was already identified in
previous work and specified in [6]. Except 2^nd^ order harmonics of Band 28,
none of the products falls into the B3, B11 or B28 UE receiving bands.

### 6.117.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the ΔT~IB,c~ is defined for applicable
bands in Table 6.117.4-1. Note that constituent CA 11A-28A is subject to HTF

### 6.117.5 REFSENS
This CA includes two harmonic issues when the uplink is Band 28. MSDs have
been obtained through the studies of relevant 2DL CAs and the following is the
proposal based on the results. Two sets of uplink configurations are required
to be defined for Band 28 with new notes (Note 4, 5).

### 6.118.3 Harmonics and IMD study
#### 6.118.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 8, Band
11 and Band 28 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.118.3.1-1 below:
Table 6.118.3.1-1: Band 8, Band 11 and Band 28 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *

f3-high\|  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 3158.9 3258.9
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.118.3.1-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (8 + 11 + 28) may fall
into BS receive band of Bands 24 and 70. However, Bands 24 and 70 are not
intended for use in the same geographical area as Bands 8,11 and 28.
Therefore, there is no concern foreseen on the 3^rd^ order IMD products
falling into 3GPP bands.
#### 6.118.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.118.3.2-1 gives the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic for CA with B8+ B11 \+
B28. It can be seen that distortions caused by 2^nd^ order harmonics of Band
28 located within the pass band of Band 11. It was already identified in
previous work and specified in TS 36.101. Except 2^nd^ order harmonics of Band
28, none of the products falls into the B8, B11 or B28 UE receiving bands.

### 6.118.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
A specific issue in CA_8A-28A is that the uplink is limited to Band 8 due to
antenna performance reason. The same situation goes for this 3CA then B28 as
uplink should be out of scope. This means that HTF in Band 28 could be
eliminated in 8A-11A-28A to protect B11 Rx from B28 Tx. However, taking 2DL
into account, CA_11A-28A still permits Band 28 in uplink and this could be a
part of constituent 2DL support. Thus, in this CA, it is proposed to assume
that the HTF is still in B28.
For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configurations with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the ΔT~IB,c~ is defined for applicable
bands in Table 6.118.4-1.

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configuration in
Table 6.118.4-2 with uplink in one E-UTRA band, the minimum requirement for
reference sensitivity in Table 7.3.1-1 (of TS 36.101) shall be increased by
the amount given in ΔR~IB,c~ in Table 6.118.4-2 for the applicable E-UTRA
bands.

### 6.118.5 REFSENS
As mentioned above, while this CA includes a harmonic issue when the uplink is
Band 28, the requirements should be excluded for the cases of Band 28 uplink
due to the limitation in CA_8A-28A.

### 6.119.3 Harmonics and IMD study
#### 6.119.3.1 For the BS
Table 6.119.3.1-1 gives the harmonics and IMD products for Band 1 + Band 3+
Band 3 CA with 3DL. It shows that the second harmonics may fall into BS
receive band of Band 43, and no third harmonics will fall into any BS receive
band specified by 3GPP. In addition, no second order intermodulation products
will fall into any BS receive band. The third order intermodulation products
may fall into the BS receive band of Band 2, 7, 11, 21, 24, 25, 35, 39, 40 and
41.
Note that Band 2, 25 and 35 are not intended for use in the same geographical
area as Band 1 and Band 3. It is suggested BS transmitters supporting CA of
Band 1 + Band 3 +Band3 should not share the same antenna with Band 7, 11, 21,
24, 39, 40, 41 and 43 BS receiver, unless the antenna path meets very
stringent third order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 7,
11, 21, 24, 33, 39, 40, 41 and 43 BS receiver desensitization. Specific
analysis on the harmonics and IMD products with consideration on the adopted

#### 6.119.3.2 For the UE
As shown in Table 6.119.3.2-1, the harmonic frequencies of band 1 and band 3
in UL are away from the receive bands of B1 and B3 in the DL, so that we can
conclude that there is no issue on UL harmonic interference.

For the UE which supports inter-band carrier aggregation configuration with
uplink assigned to one E-UTRA band the ΔT~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ are defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.119.4-1 and Table 6.119.4-2

### 6.119.5 REFSENS requirements
Considered what has been discussed for B1+B3 CA and B1+B3C, the CA_B1A_B3A_B3A
also need to be separated into two cases when the uplink is configured in Band
1. One is without MSD issues when the separation between the upper edge of the
aggregated DL continuous carrier in Band 3 and the lower edge of UL carrier in
Band 1 is equal or larger than 60MHz. The other one is degradation of Band 3
DL from Band 1 UL due to narrow frequency that the edge-to-edge separation
between the Band 1 UL and Band 3 DL is less than 60MHz. The former MSD is
specified in Tables 6.119.5-1 and 6.119.5-2, and the latter is specified in
Tables 6.119.5-3 and 6.119.5-4. When the uplink is configured in Band3, the
TX-RX separation is large enough so that there would be no MSD issues either.

### 6.120.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.120.3-1 gives the UL to DL harmonic products for CA Band 41, Band 46
and Band 46 with 1UL. It can be seen that 2^nd^ harmonics fall into band 46.
Table 6.120.3-1: Band 41, Band 46 and Band 46 1UL harmonic products

3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 7488 to 8070 15450 to 17775
* * *
The 2nd and 3rd order DL to UL harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of band 41, band 46 and band 46 DL carriers is calculated and
shown in table 6.120.3-2 below:

It can be seen from Table 6.120.3-2 that the 2^rd^ harmonics fall into the
E-UTRA operating BS receive band 46, there is no UL for Band 46, thus it is no
need to consider the influence for Band 46 BS receiver desensitization.
It can also be seen none of the 3^rd^ harmonics any E-UTRA operating BS
receive bands.
It can also be seen that two-tone 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Band
7, 22, 38, 41 and 42, and that the two-tone 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall
into Band 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 31, 44 and 68. The
three tone 3^rd^ order products may fall into Band 7, 38 and 41.With the
performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive path
components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is expected
that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 5, 6, 7, 8,
12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 31,38, 41, 42, 44 and 68 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Band 41 and Band 46 BS transmitters do
not share the same antenna with any of these receivers.

### 6.121.3 Co-existence studies
Table 6.121.3-1 gives the UL to DL harmonic products for CA Band 41, Band 41
and Band 46 with 1UL. It can be seen that 2^nd^ harmonics fall into band 46.

3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 7488 to 8070 15450 to 17775
* * *
The 2nd and 3rd order DL to UL harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting of band 41, band 41 and band 46 DL carriers is calculated and
shown in table 6.121.3-2 below:

It can be seen from Table 6.121.3-2 that the 2^rd^ harmonics fall into the
E-UTRA operating BS receive band 46, there is no UL for Band 46, thus it is no
need to consider the influence for Band 46 BS receiver desensitization.
It can also be seen none of the 3^rd^ harmonics any E-UTRA operating BS
receive bands.
It can also be seen that two-tone 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Band
7, 22, 38, 41 and 42, and that the two-tone 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall
into Band 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 31, 44 and 68. The
three tone 3^rd^ order products may fall into Band 7, 38 and 41.With the
performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive path
components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is expected
that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 5, 6, 7, 8,
12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 31,38, 41, 42, 44 and 68 receiver
would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of
receiver desensitization, provided that Band 41 and Band 46 BS transmitters do
not share the same antenna with any of these receivers.

For the UE which supports CA_41C-46A the ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ is defined for
applicable bands in Table 6.121.4-1 and 6.121.4-2 respectively assuming
separate antenna architecture without HTF:

* * *
As shown in Table 6.122.3.1-1, in addition to the impacts of harmonics and IMD
product from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ intermodulation
products generated by BS supporting 3DL CA of Band (1+1+3) may fall into the
BS receive band of Bands 1, 3, 7, 9, 39, 40, 41 and 65. As 3^rd^
intermodulation products may fall into own receive block of Band 3, further
analysis is needed to be done.
Assume that the 3 carriers transmitted by the Band (3+1+1) BS are a, b, and c
MHz in channel bandwidth and d, e, and f MHz from the lower edges of Band 3
and 1 DL frequency as shown in Figure 6.122.3.1-1 below:
{width="6.688194444444444in" height="1.3083333333333333in"}
Figure 6.122.3.1-1: 3 carriers transmitted by the Band (3 + 1 + 1) BS
And the corresponding BS receive blocks are as shown in Figure 6.122.3.1-2
below:
{width="6.689583333333333in" height="1.35in"}
Figure 6.122.3.1-2: 3 carriers received by the Band (3 + 1 + 1) BS
Then the 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC
can be calculated as shown in Table 6.122.3.1-2 below:
Table 6.122.3.1-2: Band (3 + 1 + 1) BS DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *
3^rd^ order IMD products IMD frequency limits (MHz) (f1-low + f2-low --
f3-high) 1805 + _d_ \+ _e_ \-- _f_ \-- _c_ (f1-high + f2-high -- f3-low) 1805
+ _d_ \+ _a_ \+ _e_ \+ _b_ \-- _f_ (f1-low + f3-low -- f2-high) 1805 + _d_ \+
_f_ \-- _e_ \-- _b_ (f1-high + f3-high -- f2-low) 1805 + _d_ \+ _a_ \+ _f_ \+
_c_ \-- _e_
* * *
Comparing the IMD frequency limits in Table 6.122.3.1-2 with the BS receive
blocks in Figure 6.122.3.1-2, it can be deduced that the 3^rd^ order IMD
products caused in the BS by transmitting of the 3 CC will not fall into the
BS own receive block of Band 3 regardless of the transmit configurations.
As the result above, it is recommended that the Band (1 + 1 + 3) BS
transmitter should not share the same antenna with Bands 1, 7, 9, 39, 40, 41
and 65 BS receiver, in order to prevent BS receiver desensitization, unless
the antenna path meets very stringent 3rd order PIM specification so that the
PIM will not cause Bands 1, 7, 9, 39, 40, 41 and 65 BS receiver
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.
Table 6.122.3-3 summarizes frequency ranges where harmonics occur due to Band
1 + Band 3 CA with 1 UL.

3^rd^ order harmonics frequency range (MHz) 5130 to 5355 5760 to 5940
* * *
It can be seen that no harmful fall down toward DL bands of interest is
observed in UE side

### 6.141.5 REFSENS requirements
Based on the co-existence study in 6.141.3, there is no harmonic issue in this
combination taking actual spectrum allocation into account. And following

other.
For CA_1A-5A-41A, the reference sensitivity requirement of Band1, Band5 and

combination sets in Table 5.6A.2-1 of TS 36.101 whose channel bandwidths are
entirely covered by the signaled 3DL CA bandwidth combination set.
### 6.142.3 Harmonics and IMD study
#### 6.142.3.1 For the BS
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting of Band 3, Band
5 and Band 41 DL carriers (i.e. 3DL CA with one component carrier in each
band) can be calculated as shown in Table 6.142.3.1-1 below:
Table 6.142.3.1-1:Band3, Band 5 and Band 41 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products
* * *

IMD frequency limits (MHz) 3407 3701
3^rd^ order IMD products \|f1-low + f2-low + f3-low\| \|f1-high + f2-high +
f3-high\|  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 5170 5464
* * *
It can be seen from Table 3 that in addition to the impacts of harmonics and
IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the 3^rd^ order IMD
products supporting 3 DL CA of Band (3 + 5 + 41) may fall into BS receive band
of Bands 24, 70, 3, 4, 10, 66, 9, 42, 22, 48, 43 and 46. However, Bands 24,
70, 4, 10, 66, 9, 42, 22, 48, 43 and 46 are not intended for use in the same
geographical area as Bands 3, 5 and 41. Therefore, the focus here is on the
3^rd^ order IMD products falling into Band 3.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the IMD interference generated within the Band 3 receiver would
be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the possibility of receiver
desensitization, provided that Band (3 + 5 + 41) BS transmitter does not share
the same antenna with Band 3 BS receiver.
Therefore, it is recommended that Band (3 + 5 + 41) BS transmitter should not
share the same antenna with Band 3 BS receiver to prevent BS receiver
desensitization, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 3^rd^ order PIM
specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 3 BS receiver
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.
#### 6.142.3.2 For the UE
Table 6.142.3.2-1 gives the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ harmonic for CA with B3+ B5 \+
B41. The 3rd order harmonic products of Band 5 UL may fall into the passband
of B41 DL for UE. But it was concluded in 2DL of 5A-41A BCS0 that whether the
harmonic interference issue exist or not still depends on the actual spectrum
allocation. In this 3CA, the same can be applied. Other than that, it is found
that none of the products falls into the B3, B5 or B41 UE receiving bands.

### 6.142.5 REFSENS requirements
Based on the co-existence study in 6.142.3, there is no harmonic issue in this
combination taking actual spectrum allocation into account. And following
CA_26A-41A agreement, network should avoid simultaneous Tx/Rx operation for
CA_5A-41A when the Band 41 DL and 3rd harmonic of Band 5 UL overlaps each
other.
For CA_3A-5A-41A, the reference sensitivity requirement of Band3, Band5 and
Band41are given in Table6.142.5-1, exceptions are allowed when the uplink is
active within a specified frequency range as noted in Table 6.142.5-1. For
these exceptions, the UE shall meet the requirements specified in Table

It can be seen fromTable 6.143.3 2-1 that, in addition to the impact of
harmonics and IM products from constituent 2DL CA combinations, the 3^rd^
order IM products supporting 3DL CA of Band (3 + 3 + 41) may fall into BS
receive bands of Band 7, 38, and 41.
Since a BS does not transmit and receive simultaneously for a given TDD band,
any 3^rd^ order IM products falling into Band 41 UL can be neglected.
It is therefore recommended that a BS transmitting on Bands (3 + 3 + 41) do
not share the same antenna with Bands 7 and 38 to avoid BS receiver
desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the state-of-the-
art continues to evolve in the future.

receive bands of Band 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 23, 24, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39,
42, 43, 48, 65, and 66.
It is therefore recommended that a BS transmitting on Bands (3 + 8 + 20) do
not share the same antenna with the BS receiver operating on Bands 1, 2, 3, 4,
9, 10, 23, 24, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 42, 43, 48, 65, and 66 to avoid BS
receiver desensitization.

### 6.146.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting the 3DL CA
configurations of CA_48A-48A-66A can be calculated as shown in Table 6.146.3-1
below:

It can be seen from Table 6.146.3-1 that 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall to
UL frequencies of Band 1, 30, 34, 36, 40, 46 and 65.
### 6.146.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
CA_3A-42A which is very similar band combination as CA_48A+48A-66A has dTib of
0.6 dB for band 3 and 0.8 dB for band 42. Furthermore CA_3A-42A has dRib of
0.2 dB for band 3 and 0.5 dB for band 42. It is proposed to reuse these
relaxations for CA_48A-48A-66A. Same relaxations were approved also for
CA_48A-66A in previous RAN4 meeting.

### 6.146.5 Reference sensitivity
Band 66 uplink 2^nd^ harmonic range is 3420 -- 3560 which hits the band 48
range by 10 MHz which is 3550 -- 3700.
It is proposed that band 48 MSD is specified according to CA_3A-42 which has
similar frequency ranges. This is also aligned what was approved for
CA_48A-66A in previous RAN4 meeting.

### 6.147.3 Co-existence studies
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by
transmitting the 3DL CA configurations of CA_48C-66A can be calculated as
shown in Table 6.147.3-1 below:

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.147.3-1 that none 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics
may fall into any UL frequencies of 3GPP Bands. 2^nd^ order IMD products may
fall to UL frequencies of Band 11, 21, 45 and 46. Taking into account the
maximum bandwidths to be used for this CA combination, 3^rd^ order IMD
products may fall to UL frequencies of Band 5, 12-14, 17-20, 26-28, 42-44, 46,
48 and 68. As BS operating in Band 48 cannot transmit and receive in this band
at the same time, there is no issue with IMD falling to UL frequencies of Band
48.
### 6.147.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
CA_3A-42A which is very similar band combination as CA_48C-66A has dTib of 0.6

### 6.149.3 Co-existence studies
The 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ order harmonics and IMD products caused in the BS by

* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.149.3-1 that none 2^nd^ order harmonics may fall
into any UL frequencies of 3GPP Bands, 3^rd^ order harmonics may fall into UL
frequencies of Band 46. 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall to UL frequencies of
Band 3, 4, 9, 10, 24, 46, 66 and 70. Taking into account the maximum
bandwidths to be used for this CA combination, 3^rd^ order IMD products may
fall to UL frequencies of Band 1, 2, 25, 33-37, 39, 42, 43, 46, 48 and 65. As
BS operating in Band 48 cannot transmit and receive in this band at the same
time, there is no issue with IMD falling to UL frequencies of Band 48.
Furthermore, as up to 20/40MHz channel bandwidth is considered in Band 2/48,
3^rd^ order IMD product will not fall to relevant UL frequencies of Band 2.

### 6.150.2 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting CA_2A-48A-48A DL
carriers can be calculated as shown in Table 6.150.2-1 below:
Table 6.150.2-1: CA_2A-48A-48A DL 3^rd^ order IMD products

3^rd^ order IMD products (f2-low + f3-low -- f1-high) (f2-high + f3-high --
f1-low)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 5110 5470

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 9030 9390
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.150.2-1 that in addition to the impacts of
harmonics and IMD products from the constituent 2DL CA configurations, the
3^rd^ order IMD products supporting CA_2A-48A-48A may fall into the BS receive
band of Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 46, 65 and
66.
With the performances of the current BS antenna system, transmit and receive
path components, amplifiers, pre-distortion algorithms and filters, it is
expected that the harmonics and IMD interference generated within the Band 1,
3, 4, 9, 10, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 46, 65 and 66 receiver or the own
Band 2 receiver would be well below the receiver noise floor eliminating the
possibility of receiver desensitization, provided that Bands 2 and 48 BS
transmitters do not share the same antenna with Band 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 23, 25,
33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 46, 65 and 66 BS receiver, or the own Band 2 BS
receiver if the aforementioned BS transmit configurations are used.
Therefore, in order to prevent BS receiver desensitization, it is recommended
that Bands 2 and 48 BS transmitters should not share the same antenna with
Band 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 46, 65 and 66 BS
receiver, or the own Band 2 BS receiver if the aforementioned BS transmit
configurations are used, unless the antenna path meets very stringent 2^nd^
and 3^rd^ order PIM specification so that the PIM will not cause Band 1, 3, 4,
9, 10, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 46, 65 and 66 BS or the own Band 2 BS
receiver desensitization. Note that antenna sharing may be allowed as the
state-of-the-art continues to evolve in the future.

### 6.151.3 Co-existence studies
The 3^rd^ order IMD products caused in the BS by transmitting the 3DL CA
configurations of CA_2A-48A-66A can be calculated as shown in Table 6.151.3-1
below:
Table 6.151.3-1: Band 2, 48 and 66 DL 3^rd^ order IMD products

f3-high)  
IMD frequency limits (MHz) 7590 7890
* * *
It can be seen from Table 6.151.3-1 that 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall to
UL frequencies of Band 22, 31, 42, 43 and 48. As BS operating in Band 48
cannot transmit and receive in this band at the same time, there is no issue
with IMD falling to UL frequencies of Band 48.
### 6.151.4 ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ values
CA_2A-66A has 0.5 dB of dTib for both bands. Furthermore, three band
combinations which have three high bands from which one is band 42 which is
similar to band 48, the dTib for band 48 is 0.8 dB.
CA_2A-66A has 0.3 dB of dRib for both bands. Furthermore, three band
combinations which have three high bands from which one is band 42 which is
similar to band 48, the dRib for band 48 is 0.5 dB.
Therefore we are proposing following:
Table 6.151.4-1: dTib for CA_2A-48A-66A
* * *
CA_2A-48A-66A 2 0.6 48 0.8 66 0.6
* * *
Table 6.151.4-2: dRib for CA_2A-48A-66A
* * *
CA_2A-48A-66A 2 0.3 48 0.5 66 0.3
* * *
### 6.151.5 Reference sensitivity
Band 2 uplink 2^nd^ harmonic range is 3700 -- 3820 which just misses the band
48 range which is 3550 -- 3700.
Band 66 uplink 2^nd^ harmonic range is 3420 -- 3560 which hits the band 48
range by 10 MHz which is 3550 -- 3700.
It is proposed that band 48 MSD is specified according to CA_3A-42 which has
similar frequency ranges.
