# Introduction
Packet-oriented features like HSDPA and E-DCH in WCDMA/UMTS systems will
promote the subscribers' desire for continuous connectivity, where the user
stays connected over a long time span with only occasional active periods of
data transmission, and avoiding frequent connection termination and re-
establishment with its inherent overhead and delay.
This is the perceived mode a subscriber is used to in fixed broadband networks
(e.g. DSL) and a precondition to attract users from fixed broadband networks.
To support a high number of HSDPA users in the code limited downlink the
feature F-DPCH was introduced in REL-6.
In the uplink, the limiting factor for supporting a similarly high number of
E-DCH users is the noise rise.
For such a high number of users in the cell it can be assumed that many users
are not transmitting any user data for some time (e.g. for reading during web
browsing or in between packets for periodic packet transmission such as
VoIP).The corresponding overhead in the noise rise caused by maintained
control channels will significantly limit the number of users that can be
efficiently supported.
As completely releasing dedicated channels during periods of traffic
inactivity would cause considerable delays for reestablishing data
transmission and a corresponding bad user perception, this WI is intended to
reduce the impact of control channels on uplink noise rise while maintaining
the connections and allowing a much faster reactivation for temporarily
inactive users.

# 4 Technical concepts
This section describes and analyses the suggested technical concepts
addressing the problem described by the work item "Continuous Connectivity for
Packet Data Users" defined in [1]. This section 4 includes feasible concepts
to address the WI without claiming that the concepts are complete or
restricting the addition of alternatives.
The following **common base for all concepts** can be assumed:
\- Packet data users in CELL_DCH state using HSDPA and E-DCH as described in
REL-6 are addressed.
\- The UE is and will remain in the CELL_DCH RRC state whatever continuous
connectivity concept will be applied.
\- The signalling radio bearers (SRBs) are assumed to be mapped on HS-DSCH in
downlink (as is necessary for F-DPCH, anyway) and on E-DCH in uplink.
\- UL channels present in this case: UL DPCCH, HS-DPCCH, E-DPCCH, E-DPDCH
(E-DPCCH, E-DPDCH are DTXed when no data (or rate requests) needs to be
transmitted on E-DPDCH).
\- DL channels present in this case: F-DPCH, HS-SCCH, HS-PDSCH, E-AGCH,
E-RGCH, E-HICH. To avoid DL channelization code limitations F-DPCH instead of
DL DPCCH is considered.
Different **phases during the stay in the CELL_DCH state** can be
distinguished by the activity of the data channels:
\- Packet on HS-PDSCH is transmitted to the UE in the TTI.
\- inactive DL: No packet is transmitted on HS-PDSCH to the UE in the TTI.
\- Packet on E-DPDCH is transmitted to the Node B in the TTI.
\- inactive UL: No packet is transmitted on E-DPDCH to the Node B in the TTI.
It is the aim that the application of a continuous connectivity concept will
not affect the performance of a transmission in an active TTI.
The description of the active and inactive phases does not preclude the way
and whether or not CELL_DCH substates should be introduced.
The continuous connectivity concepts are addressing the control channels (i.e.
one or more) during inactive phases in UL and/or DL.
The triggers for initiating and terminating the use of a continuous
connectivity concept relative to the start and end of active and inactive
phases depend on the considered concept. For example:
\- whether the concept is triggered when there is inactivity in just one
direction (i.e. only DL, only UL) or in both directions (UL & DL);
\- whether a transition from activity to inactivity will directly trigger the
application of the concept or whether there is a short period of inactive
phase without applying the concept (e.g. if a timer is used to trigger the
concept);
\- whether very short periods of DL and/or UL inactivity (e.g. during
transmission of VoIP packets or where a UE is not scheduled but data is
waiting in the scheduler queue) could also be addressed by a continuous
connectivity concept.
\- whether during an inactive phase the concept is used during transmission of
physical layer signalling (e.g. on HS-DPCCH or HS-SCCH).
The period during which a continuous connectivity concept is applied is called
\"Continuously Packet Connected mode\" or shorter \"CPC mode\".
**Transitions between the different phases** :
The following transitions are called \" CPC initiation\":
\- active phase **[to]{.underline}** CPC mode
\- inactive phase where REL-6 is applied as usual **[to]{.underline}** CPC
mode
while the transition back is called \"CPC termination\":
\- CPC mode **[to]{.underline}** active phase.
\- CPC mode **[to]{.underline}** inactive phase where REL-6 is applied as
usual
Triggers for the transitions and a description of the signalling (e.g. L1 or
L2 signalling) or the implicit rules/blind detection (if no signalling is
required) for the transitions has to be described in the different continuous
connectivity concepts.
Nevertheless, three general transition control approaches (i.e. who will have
the final decision about the transition) could be distinguished:
\- transition is controlled by the UE
\- transition is controlled by the Node B
\- transition is controlled by predefined rules applied by both UE and Node B
This includes also the possibility to have a combination for different links
(i.e. UL/DL) or transitions (i.e. CPC initiation/termination).
Another aspect to be described for each concept is the question of how
reliable is the control of the CPC initiation and termination.
## 4.1 New DPCCH slot format
### 4.1.1 Description of the concept
#### 4.1.1.1 General description
The primary purpose of the continuous DPCCH when data is not being transmitted
is to maintain synchronisation and power control ready for a rapid resumption
of data transmission when needed.
This is different from the case when data is being transmitted, when the DPCCH
also has to act as the phase reference for the data, and possibly also carry
TFCI and/or FBI.
The DPCCH slot formats which are available up to Release 6 are primarily
adapted to the case when data is being transmitted, but are not necessarily
suitable for minimising the overhead when the DPCCH is the only uplink
channel. In particular, none of the existing DPCCH slot formats have more than
2 TPC bits, while the pilot field occupies between 5 and 8 bits, reflecting
the need for sufficient pilot energy to give a reliable channel estimate for
decoding data.
One way to reduce the DPCCH overhead could therefore be to introduce a new
DPCCH slot format which is better suited to the case when effectively the only
data bits are the TPC bits. Typically this would involve reducing the pilot
energy per slot.
Some possible new slot formats are shown in Figure 4.1.1.1-1 to Figure
4.1.1.1-3.
Figure 4.1.1.1-1: One possible new DPCCH slot format (Format a)
The slot format shown in figure 4.1.1.1-1has an equal number of pilot and TPC
bits. Typically this optimises the pilot-to-TPC ratio if the channel phase
estimation is being carried out over a single slot.
Figure 4.1.1.1-2: A second possible new slot format (Format b)
Figure 4.1.1.1-2 shows an example which may be better suited to a slowly-
changing channel when the channel phase estimation may be averaged over a
number of consecutive slots. Here the TPC field is increased in size even more
than in figure 4.1.1.1-1, thus enabling a larger reduction in DPCCH transmit
power.
A reduction in SIR target would be applied at the Node B when a slot format
like those in figure 4.1.1.1-1or figure 4.1.1.1-2 was being used. A power step
on the DPCCH could also be applied in order for the power control loop to
converge quickly.
Reducing the DPCCH power in this way enables the uplink control channel
overhead to be reduced, and hence more inactive users to be supported in
CELL_DCH state.
Figure 4.1.1.1-3: A third possible new slot format (Format c)
Figure 4.1.1.1-3 shows a slot format where the number of pilot bits is reduced
to a suitable number for the current size of the TPC field. DTX would be used
between the pilot and TPC fields. This type of slot format would give a
reduction in the average overhead, with the noise rise from an individual user
being discontinuous.
Other possibilities, for example with 4 or 6 pilot bits, could also be
considered, but the number of new slot formats should be minimised, preferably
to a single new slot format.
#### 4.1.1.2 Detailed proposals
In this section specific proposals are described in more detail.
As an example, a new slot format may be introduced into 25.211 as shown in
Table 4.1.1.2-1, where the new format 1* is associated with the existing slot
format 1. When slot format 1* is configured by the RNC, the slot format could
switch to slot format 1 during certain periods when more pilot energy is
required. The switching between slot formats 1 and 1* could be according to
predefined rules. This is discussed further in sub-clause 4.1.2.3. Configuring
the new slot format under the control of the RNC in this way also allows
compatibility with Node B's that do not support the new slot format.
Table 4.1.1.2-1: New slot format: Proposal A
Slot Format #I | Channel Bit Rate (kbps) | Channel Symbol Rate (ksps) | SF | Bits/ Frame | Bits/ Slot | Npilot | NTPC | NTFCI | NFBI | Transmitted slots per radio frame  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
0 | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 15  
0A | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 10-14  
0B | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 0 | 8-9  
1 | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 8 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 8-15  
1* | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 8-15  
2 | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 15  
2A | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 10-14  
2B | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 8-9  
3 | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 7 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 8-15  
As a further example, a new slot format may be introduced as shown in Table
4.1.1.2-2, where the use of the new format 4 can only be configured by the RNC
in the normal way (i.e. its use does not depend on transmission activity on
other channels).
Table 4.1.1.2-2: New slot format: Proposal B
Slot Format #I | Channel Bit Rate (kbps) | Channel Symbol Rate (ksps) | SF | Bits/ Frame | Bits/ Slot | Npilot | NTPC | NTFCI | NFBI | Transmitted slots per radio frame  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
0 | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 15  
0A | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 10-14

1 | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 8 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 8-15  
2 | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 15  
2A | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 10-14  
2B | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 8-9  
3 | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 7 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 8-15  
4 | 15 | 15 | 256 | 150 | 10 | 6 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 8-15  
##### 4.1.1.2.1 SIR target adjustment
In order to gain maximum benefit from a new slot format used during periods of
with no uplink data transmission, at least the serving Node B should reduce
its SIR target by a specified amount during the period with no uplink data,
and the following behaviour should also occur:
\- At the start of usage of the new slot format, the UE should reduce its
DPCCH transmit power by a specified amount.
\- At the end of usage of the new slot format, the UE should increase its
DPCCH transmit power by a specified amount.
As an example, the methods described for SIR target reduction in section 4.3
could be used.
##### 4.1.1.2.2 CPC initiation and termination
The initiation and termination of CPC operation would be different for the two
proposals given in sub-clause 4.1.1.2.
For **Proposal A** (Table 4.1.1.2-1), CPC initiation would comprise
configuring the use of slot format #1* by RRC signalling in the usual way.
Predefined rules for switching between slot format #1* and slot format #1
could then be used, for example comprising using slot format #1 in all DPCCH
slots which start at the beginning of or during either HS-DPCCH transmission,
DPDCH transmission or E-DPCCH transmission, and using slot format #1* in all
other DPCCH slots.
The HS-DSCH Serving Node B can predict exactly when HS-DPCCH transmissions
will occur, and can therefore predict whether slot format #1 or slot format
#1* is being used. The serving Node B can therefore derive the channel
estimate and decode the DPCCH correctly in this case. Other Node Bs do not
have to decode the HS-DPCCH transmissions, but could nonetheless use detected
HS-DPCCH energy to help determine which of slot formats 1 and 1* was being
used.
For E-DPCCH/E-DPDCH transmission, the change of slot format could be detected
on the basis of detected E-DPCCH/E-DPDCH energy (similar to blind transport
format detection using received power ratio). The E-DCH Serving RLS also has
knowledge of the Serving Grant and UE buffer status, and can therefore make a
more reliable estimate of when E-DPCCH is transmitted.
These possibilities are discussed further in sub-clause 4.1.2.3, where
conclusions are also drawn in the light of the simulation results.
Depending on the choice of pilot pattern, Node Bs could also use differences
in bit pattern to detect a change of DPCCH slot format. However, in order to
avoid blind slot-format detection in non-serving Node Bs in soft handover, it
seems preferable to set the pilot pattern for the new slot format 1* to be the
same as the first bits of the pilot pattern for the associated slot format 1.
This is illustrated in Table Y for a new slot format 1* with 5 pilot bits and
5 TPC bits. The existing Rel-99 pilot pattern for slot format 1 (8 pilot bits)
is also shown for comparison.
| Npilot = 5 **(slot format 1*)** | Npilot = 8 **(slot format 1)** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Bit # | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7  
Slot#0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 | 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 | 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 | 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 | 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 | 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 | 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1  
This enables the non-serving Node Bs always to decode two TPC bits at the end
of each slot using a channel estimate derived from the first 5 pilot bits,
without needing to do any blind detection of the change of slot format.
For **Proposal B** (Table 4.1.1.2-2), Slot Format #4 would be configured by
the RNC in the normal way, so fast switching would not occur.
A combination of Proposals A and B could also be considered, by adding both
slot format #1* and slot format #4 to the slot formats table for UL DPCCH. In
this case, it would be possible for the RNC to configure the new slot format
either to be used in all slots (by configuring slot format #4), or only in
inactive slots (by configuring slot format #1 and enabling the use of slot
format #1*).
### 4.1.2 Analysis of the concept
#### 4.1.2.1 Simulation results on UL TPC error rate
The performance results here show the UL DPCCH E~b~/N~0~ required to achieve a
given UL TPC error rate for some different DPCCH slot formats. These would be
applicable for the case where only the UL DPCCH is present.
The simulation assumptions are as follows:
\- 2GHz carrier frequency
\- DPCCH SF = 256
\- Non-SHO
\- UL power control using PCA1 and a 1dB step size, with a 4% error rate on DL
TPC commands
\- DL power control using DPC_MODE= 0 is assumed
\- Dual-antenna receive-diversity at Node B
\- Uplink channel phase estimation averaged over either 1 or 3 slots
\- UL channel model: PA, PB or VA
\- UE speed 3 or 120km/h
{width="5.249305555555556in" height="3.9368055555555554in"}
Figure 4.1.2.1-1: UL TPC error rate for PB3 with 3-slot channel estimate
{width="1.4895833333333333in" height="1.09375in"}
Figure 4.1.2.1-2: UL TPC error rate for PA3 with 3-slot channel estimate
{width="5.249305555555556in" height="3.9368055555555554in"}
Figure 4.1.2.1-3: UL TPC error rate for VA120 with 1-slot channel estimate
The simulation results presented above for PA, PB and VA channels at UE speeds
from 3km/h to 120km/h show that the E~b~/N~0~ required for the UL DPCCH can be
reduced for a given TPC error rate by changing the ratio of pilot to TPC bits
per slot. The gains are typically in the region 2-3dB.
Considering the simulations above showing the TPC error rate, a slot format
with 4 pilot bits and 6 TPC bits seems to give robust performance regardless
of the averaging period of the channel estimate.
Another set of simulations was run with different algorithms. The simulation
parameters are listed in Table 4.1.2.1-1 and the results are shown in Figure
4.1.2.1-4.

channel models
#### 4.1.2.2 Simulation results on other UL channels
The basic simulation assumptions here are as follows:
\- 2GHz carrier frequency
\- DPCCH SF = 256
\- Non-SHO
\- UL power control using PCA1 and a 1dB step size, with a 4% error rate on DL
TPC commands
\- Dual-antenna receive-diversity at Node B
\- Uplink channel phase estimation averaged over 1 to 3 slots, TPC-aided where
shown
\- UL channel model: PA, PB or VA
\- UE speed 3, 30 or 120km/h
The case of HS-DPCCH being transmitted in parallel with the DPCCH is
considered, to examine the effect of changing the DPCCH slot format on the
decoding of the HS-DPCCH. For the HS-DPCCH, the following assumptions are
used:
\- β~hs~ = β~c~ (Δ~ACK~ = Δ~NACK~ = Δ~CQI~)
\- N_cqi_transmit = 1 (i.e. no repetition)
\- N_acknack_transmit = 1 (i.e. no repetition)
\- Node B detection threshold for ACK configured to give P(ACK\|DTX) = 0.1
(assuming the probability of missed detection for HS-SCCH at the UE is 10e-2).
Under these conditions, the CQI and ACK error rates are measured, using two
different types of channel estimation:
\- Channel estimation using DPCCH pilot bits only
\- TPC-aided channel estimation (using both pilot bits and TPC bits)
MLSE decoding is used for CQI.
The following DPCCH slot formats are evaluated:
Slot Format #I | Channel Bit Rate (kbps) | Channel Symbol Rate (ksps) | SF | Bits/ Frame | Bits/ Slot | Npilot | NTPC | NTFCI | NFBI  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

##### 4.1.2.2.3 Observations from simulations of HS-DPCCH performance in sub-
clauses 4.1.2.2.1 and 4.1.2.2.2
From the simulation results presented above, it is observed that:
1\. If a new DPCCH slot format with fewer pilot bits is used during HS-DPCCH
transmissions, there is degradation in HS-DPCCH performance for CQI (typically
around 2dB).
2\. The degradation in HS-DPCCH performance can be reduced slightly by using
TPC-aided channel estimation, but only if the channel is sufficiently static
for the channel estimate to be averaged over a few slots. When the coherence
time of the channel is shorter, so that the channel estimate has to be derived
from only 1 slot, use of TPC-aiding for the channel estimation further
degrades the HS-DPCCH performance.
3\. When using TPC-aided channel estimation, the ACK error rate degradation
from DPCCH slot formats with more TPC bits is smaller than for CQI.
4\. The degradation in ACK error rate is larger for a new slot format with 4
pilot bits than for a new slot format with 5 pilot bits.
5\. In terms of throughput, a new slot format with fewer pilot bits but more
TPC bits gives similar performance as slot format 1. However, for VA120, slot
format 1 performs better, but a slot format with 6 pilot bits and 4 TPC bits
performs decently also for VA120.
#### 4.1.2.3 Conclusions from TPC performance (sub-clause 4.1.2.1) and HS-
DPCCH performance (sub-clause 4.1.2.2)
In the light of the observed performance of TPC and HS-DPCCH, the following
behaviour could be useful:
\- A new slot format is configured by RRC signalling in the same way as Rel-99
slot formats;
\- The new slot format uses 5 pilot bits and 5 TPC bits;
\- In DPCCH slots that overlap a CQI transmission, the slot format switches
dynamically to format 1 (8 pilots + 2 TPC) in order to avoid degrading the HS-
DSCH performance.
\- Note that the Serving Node B knows exactly when to expect transmissions on
the HS-DPCCH, so with this proposal there is no need for the Serving Node B to
blind-detect the change of DPCCH slot format.
\- In other DPCCH slots, including those where E-DCH is transmitted (unless
HS-DPCCH is also transmitted), the new slot format continues to be used. (As
the Node B does not have full knowledge of when E-DCH will be transmitted,
keeping the slot format the same avoids any need for blind detection of the
DPCCH slot format at the Node B).
\- In slots where E-DCH is transmitted, the UE can apply a DPCCH power offset
if more pilot energy is needed. As the E-DPDCH transmission power will
typically be considerably greater than the HS-DPCCH transmission power, the
relative impact on total power of increasing the DPCCH power would be smaller
in this case.
\- Alternatively, if it were to be decided that the new slot format should be
semi-static ("Proposal B" in sub-clause 4.1.1.2), the new slot format would
need more than 5 pilot bits in order to reduce the degradation to CQI
transmission.
#### 4.1.2.4 Power control delay
Assuming that the downlink uses F-DPCH, the minimum loop delay for the uplink
power control is 1 slot, while the minimum loop delay for the downlink power
control is 2 slots. This is shown in Figure 4.1.2.4-1.
Figure 4.1.2.4-1: Power control loop delays with normal F-DPCH operation
The power control loop delays with any of the new UL DPCCH slot formats
proposed above are the same as with normal F-DPCH operation. Figure 4.1.2.4-2
shows an example for a slot format with 4 pilot bits and 6 TPC bits.
Figure 4.1.2.4-2: Example of power control loop delays with new UL DPCCH slot
format
### 4.1.3 Benefits of the concept
The concept "New UL DPCCH slot format" could be combined with the concept
"SIR_target lowering & CQI off" as well as with the concept of "UL DPCCH
gating".
\- For a given TPC reliability the required DPCCH power would be reduced by
around 2-4dB compared to existing UL DPCCH slot formats, thus reducing UL
DPCCH noise contribution and also increasing UE battery life time compared to
REL-6.
\- Compared to REL-6: Increased number of temporarily inactive users that can
stay in CELL_DCH and that can therefore get active in a very short time
avoiding frequent transitions to CELL_FACH.
\- There is no impact on TPC loop delay.
### 4.1.4 Open issues of the concept
\- Suitable mechanisms (e.g. triggers and/or signalling) for changing the slot
format? (considering how frequently it may be beneficial to change the slot
format.)
\- The use of the new slot format in soft handover needs to be investigated.
## 4.2 Uplink DPCCH gating
### 4.2.1 Description of the concept
The Uplink DPCCH Gating concept applies to a HSDPA/HSUPA scenario only, with
no DCHs configured in either direction. The uplink TPC commands sent in the
downlink are assumed to be carried over F-DPCH, but one could use associated
DPCCH as well.
#### 4.2.1.1 General principle
The optimal solution for reducing DPCCH overhead of packet data users is
turning off the DPCCH transmission when no data or HS-DPCCH is being
transmitted. With such an ideal solution the idle packet data users would not
consume any uplink air interface resources and the network resource allocation
would set the limit on how many idle users could be kept in the CELL_DCH
state. Due to practical reasons there may be a limit on the length of the
DPCCH gating period as during long inactivity the Node B could not any more
know whether the uplink synchronisation is lost or if there just is a very
long inactivity period.
In order to support longer uplink DPCCH gating gaps, the transmission after a
gap is proposed to be preceded by a DPCCH preamble of sufficient length in
order to facilitate the detection of the signal. Also, in order to save Node B
receiver resources, DRX in the uplink is proposed to be allowed during the
uplink DPCCH gating gaps.
The basic principle in short is that if there is neither E-DCH nor HS-DPCCH
transmission, the UE automatically stops the continuous DPCCH transmission and
applies a known DPCCH activity (DPCCH on/off) pattern. When an E-DCH or HS-
DPCCH transmission takes place also the DPCCH is transmitted regardless of the
activity pattern.
I.e. during the E-DCH and HS-DPCCH inactivity the UE would activate a known
DPCCH transmission pattern that would be e.g. a few DPCCH slots transmitted
every few radio frames and no DPCCH transmission during other times. If E-DCH
or HS-DPCCH is transmitted the DPCCH would be transmitted normally regardless
of the pattern. Depending on the length of the DPCCH transmission gap, a DPCCH
power control preamble of few slots may be needed before E-DCH/HS-DPCCH
transmission may start. Reception of the downlink HS-SCCH/HS-PDSCH would be
active and possible at all times. During the periods when UL DPCCH is not
transmitted, Node B will not be able to perform UL SIR estimation and has no
information on which to base the UL TPC commands sent on F-DPCH. Therefore the
F-DPCH should also be gated during the periods of UL DPCCH gating.
#### 4.2.1.2 Basic packet traffic example
Figure 4.2.1.2-1 depicts the basic idea, where during data traffic activity
(e.g. web page is being transmitted in the downlink and TCP acknowledgements
as well as HSDPA acknowledgements are transmitted in the uplink) everything
operates as with Release 6 specifications. When the data traffic stops the
continuous DPCCH transmission in the uplink is shut down too. Occasionally
during the data inactivity the DPCCH is transmitted in a predetermined pattern
so that the Node B always knows to expect some slots of DPCCH transmission and
can still follow the uplink presence and quality.
{width="5.999305555555556in" height="1.1347222222222222in"}
Figure 4.2.1.2-1: Uplink DPCCH transmission with gating
Whenever the uplink has anything to transmit on E-DCH or HS-DPCCH the DPCCH
transmission will be automatically reinitiated.
More generally, during any packet session with any packet activity/inactivity
ratio, when the user is transmitting data in the uplink, the DPCCH is
continuously active as long as the data or HS-DPCCH transmission is taking
place and during the \'reading time\', when the uplink is inactive, the DPCCH
gating pattern would be applied reducing the consumed uplink capacity to a
fraction compared to continuous DPCCH. In addition to reduced uplink capacity
consumption the UE talk times would be increased due to lowered battery
consumption.
The actual savings would be heavily depending on the activity factor of the
uplink transmission as well as the time before dropping inactive users from
CELL_DCH.
#### 4.2.1.3 VoIP traffic example
With VoIP it would be possible also to benefit from the fact that the data
transmission timing even during the active phase of VoIP would be known and
could be matched with DPCCH gating period. During the active speech phase the
UE would transmit the VoIP packet transmissions and retransmissions with DPCCH
and between the packets DPCCH would not be transmitted either.

Figure 4.2.1.3-1: DPCCH transmission with gating & 2 ms E-DCH TTI. HS-DPCCH
impact not shown
In Figure 4.2.1.3-1 an example DPCCH gating with 2 ms E-DCH TTI and VoIP
traffic (with average transmission rate of 2.5 transmission per packet) mapped
to HARQ processes 1 and 2 is shown with DPCCH activity pattern during E-DCH
inactivity as 2 ms burst every 32 ms. Note that this is a simplified example;
the transmissions and retransmissions do not need to follow this regular
pattern in order to get the desired benefits from the DPCCH gating. With such
parametrisation the DPCCH overhead would be reduced to \~6% during voice
inactivity and to \~25% during voice activity. Assuming 50% voice activity the
DPCCH overhead would be reduced to \~16% of the overhead from continuous
DPCCH. HS-DPCCH activity and possible power control preambles would reduce the
actual gains, but with good parametrisation and possible improvements to CQI
reporting, the impact of HS-DPCCH is not dominant.

Figure 4.2.1.3-2: DPCCH transmission with gating & 10 ms E-DCH TTI. HS-DPCCH
impact not shown
In Figure 4.2.1.3-2 an example DPCCH gating with 10 ms E-DCH TTI and VoIP
traffic (no retransmissions shown, low retransmission rate) mapped to HARQ
processes 1 and 3 is shown with DPCCH activity pattern during E-DCH inactivity
as 2 ms burst every 20 ms. With such parametrisation the DPCCH overhead would
be reduced to 10% during voice inactivity and to \~50% during voice activity.
Assuming 50% voice activity the DPCCH overhead would be reduced to \~30% of
the overhead from continuous DPCCH. HS-DPCCH activity and potential power
control preambles would reduce the actual gains.
#### 4.2.1.4 Operation of the uplink DPCCH gating
**The role of the RNC**
The RNC would control the activation and deactivation of the Uplink DPCCH
Gating feature the same way the RNC controls the Preamble/Postamble
transmission for HSDPA ACK/NACK transmission. This is essential to guarantee
the functionality in the SHO; gating can be used only if all Node B's in the
active set support it. RNC should also decide what kind of gating parameters
would be used, and signal the information to the Node B(s) and UE. If a Node B
in the UE\'s active set does not support gating the RNC must disable the
Uplink DPCCH Gating.
When the Uplink DPCCH Gating feature is enabled by the RNC the UE would
transmit the DPCCH continuously when E-DCH or HS-DPCCH is transmitted and
transmit the DPCCH discontinuously during the inactivity of E-DCH and HS-DPCCH
according to parameters provided by the RNC.
**Criteria for transmitting the uplink DPCCH**
The uplink DPCCH transmission would be resumed if at least one of the
following criteria is fulfilled.
1\. The DPCCH transmission pattern defines the time to transmit the DPCCH for
synchronisation and power control purposes.
2\. A HS-DPCCH transmission is triggered in the UE.
a. As in Release 5 the HS-SCCH triggers the need for HARQ ACK/NACK feedback on
HS-DPCCH.
b. As in Release 5 the CQI reporting criteria triggers sending a CQI report on
HS-DPCCH.
3\. An E-DCH transmission is triggered in the UE as in Release 6.
It could be possible to align some or all the cases of 1,2,3 e.g. allow the
E-DCH transmission to start only when the DPCCH transmission pattern would
anyway activate the DPCCH transmission, or align the DPCCH transmission
pattern\'s active phase and the CQI reporting.
**Criteria for stopping the uplink DPCCH transmission**
The uplink DPCCH transmission would be turned off if all the following
criteria are fulfilled.
1\. The DPCCH transmission pattern defines when not to transmit the DPCCH if
no other reason requires the DPCCH transmission.
2\. The HS-SCCH has not triggered the need for HARQ ACK/NACK feedback on HS-
DPCCH.
3\. There is no immediate CQI report to be sent on HS-DPCCH.
4\. There is no immediate E-DPCCH/E-DPDCH transmission taking place
5\. There hasn\'t been any HS-DPCCH or E-DPCCH/E-DPDCH transmission in the
last N slots. (N could be 0)
I.e. the uplink DPCCH is not transmitted if the DPCCH transmission pattern is
not in the active phase and there is no need for HS-DPCCH and/or
E-DPCCH/E-DPDCH transmission.
**Signalling between the UE and the Node B**
The Node B to UE signalling is not necessarily required, but e.g. for purposes
of controlling the CQI reporting or the timing when the UE may initiate the
uplink E-DCH transmission, the Node B could use e.g. techniques described in
chapters 4.3.1 and 4.4.1. As in Release 6, The E-AGCH and E-RGCH signalling
can be used to control the UE\'s ability to transmit E-DCH.
The UE to Node B signalling is not necessarily required, but e.g. if the UE is
allowed to send E-DCH TTIs whenever it likes, the presence of a DPCCH or a
DPCCH preamble can be seen as an implicit signal indicating that an E-DCH
transmission is taking place.

#### 4.2.2.2 F-DPCH performance
Table 4.2.2.2-1 shows the assumptions used for F-DPCH simulations. In case of
discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission (UL DPCCH gating), the TPC commands
are not transmitted in all UL slots. Thus, the closed loop power control
operation is slower than in case of continuous UL DPCCH. In the simulations,
the F-DPCH power has been kept unchanged during UL DPCCH transmission gaps
(F-DPCH closed loop PC OFF periods) and updated normally during UL DPCCH
transmission activity. The outer loop power control in UE is not run, i.e.,
SIR target is not updated, during the F-DPCH closed loop PC OFF periods.

for pedestrian A 3km/h (G=3dB) and in Figure 4.2.2.2‑2 for vehicular A 30km/h
(G=3dB). The performance is the worst with fast (slot rate) power control: the
slower the closed loop PC, the better the performance.

The results with different UL DPCCH transmission patterns (3 slots UL DPCCH
transmission & 27 slots UL DPCCH DTX, 3 slots UL DPCCH transmission & 57 slots
UL DPCCH DTX, 6 slots UL DPCCH transmission & 24 slots UL DPCCH DTX, 6 slots

for pedestrian A 3km/h (G=3dB) and in Figure 4.2.2.2‑4 for vehicular A 30km/h
(G=3dB), DPC_MODE=0. There are no significant differences in the F-DPCH
performance with the different patterns. The performance with slowest power
control (3 slots PC ON & 57 slots PC OFF pattern) is slightly better than with
the other patterns and the performance with more power control (6 slots PC ON
& 24 slots PC OFF pattern) is slightly worse than with the other patterns.
Thus, the performance seems to be the better the slower the power control is
(i.e., the lower the number of the power controlled slots compared to the
number of not power controlled slots is).

It can be concluded from the results, that the F-DPCH performance would not be
degraded due to the UL DPCCH gating (relatively low transmit power required
for reasonable TPC CERs) and that with discontinuous UL DPCCH transmission
(i.e., discontinuous F-DPCH power control) the UL DPCCH transmission (F-DPCH
power control ON/OFF) pattern has only minor impact on the performance (the
performance seems to be slightly better for patterns with shorter PC ON
periods).

##### 4.2.2.3.1 Additional link level results
This section goes over the link level impact of gating the DPCCH in the UL of
UTRA over active and inactive data transfers. Results in this section further
elaborate on the characterization of link level impact of DPCCH gating by
assessing the demodulation performance with HARQ enabled, realistic channel
estimation and with time-tracking (TTL) as well as frequency-tracking loops
(FTL).
Incorporating the TTL and FTL into the simulations gives a clearer indication
on whether or not synchronization issues may appear from the gating of the UL
DPCCH.
##### 4.2.2.3.1.1 Simulation assumptions {#simulation-assumptions .H6}
**\- Channel estimation** : Realistic. Non-causal FIR filter over 4 slots:
same channel estimation used for non-gated DPCCH simulations as well as DPCCH
gated simulations.
**\- Time Tracking** : 1^st^ order loop. Same loop gain for DPCCH non-gated
simulations as well as DPCCH gated simulations. The time tracking loop in the
simulations for inactive data periods takes into consideration the code
Doppler to assess any synchronization issue for long gating periods.
**\- Frequency Tracking** : 1^st^ order loop. Same loop gain for DPCCH non-
gated simulations as well as DPCCH gated simulations. The initial frequency
error is set to 200 Hz.
**\- UL Power Control** : UE transmit power adjusted just over the non-gated
periods, over the gated periods the transmit power is on hold.
\- Outer loop:
\- Enabled with 1% residual BLER target for simulations over active data
periods.
\- Enabled and based on a target Pilot symbol error rate over inactive data
periods.
**\- Channel models** : AWGN (for simulation cross-check), PA3, VA120.
**\- Transmission block size (data rate)** : 296 bits block size i.e., 148
kbps over single transmission (49.33 kbps after 3 transmissions).
**\- E-DCH Beta factors** : from 0 to 20 dB
**\- Data activity** : 100% over one HARQ process (when a packet is positively
acknowledged, a new packet is transmitted).
**\- DPCCH slot format** : 0, (6 pilot symbols out of 10 symbols)
**\- Gating patterns** :
\- 0% gating: continuous DPCCH transmission as illustrated by Figure 1.
\- 50% gating: DPCCH transmitted over 2 HARQ processes every 8. Transmitted
with 2-slot preamble and 1-slot postamble as illustrated by Figure 2.
\- 75% gating: DPCCH transmitted over 1 HARQ process every 8. Transmitted with
2-slot preamble and 1-slot postamble as illustrated by Figure 3.
\- 87.5% gating: DPCCH transmitted over 1 HARQ process every 16. Transmitted
with 2-slot preamble and 1-slot postamble.

Table 4.2.2.3.1.2.1-4 presents the gains of the two considered gating schemes
(50% and 75%) with respect to no-gating. For the transport block size of the
evaluation i.e., 296 bits, the 50% gating provides gains between 0.45dB and
0.79dB. The gains range much more for the 75% gating where we go from a 1.68dB
gain for the VA120 case to an actual loss of 0.99dB for the PA3 case.

AWGN 0.79 0.54
PA3 0.45 -0.99
VA120 0.78 1.68
* * *
In general, the gains provided by the 50% gating are higher than 75% for AWGN
and PA3 channel models.
These gains at the link level directly yield a reduction in the contribution
to the interference rise and therefore help into the overall system capacity
improvement.
##### 4.2.2.3.1.2.2 Simulations results over data inactive periods
{#simulations-results-over-data-inactive-periods .H6}
For the simulations over inactive data periods and due to lack of data blocks,
a power control loop based on Pilot symbol error rate is used. Tables
4.2.2.3.1.2.2-1 to 4.2.2.3.1.2.2- 4 show the results of calibrating this outer
loop power control method with the regular outer loop power control method
based on E-DPDCH BLER. The verification is performed for a number of channel
models and T/P operating points.

From the results above, we can see that the outer-loop power control method
based on Pilot SER yields practically the same result as the traditional
outer-loop power control method based on E-DPDCH BLER. Therefore, given that
over inactive periods there will not be sufficient packets to base the outer-
loop power control on the E-DPDCH BLER, the Pilot SER method appears to be a
viable alternative.

\- Effective Pilot Ec/Nt (Eff. Ecp/Nt): normalized to the effective
transmission ratio of DPCCH.
**[Results with no Code Doppler]{.underline}**
The results in this subsection assume the paths of the traffic models under
investigation to remain at a fixed time offset for the entire simulation
length. Note that this is an unrealistic assumption as the UE speed will
create Code Doppler that will skew in time the receive chips. Performance with
Code Doppler is investigated in the next subsection.

Table 4.2.2.3.1.2.2-7 summarizes the performance gain of DPCCH gating for the
three different DPCCH gatings.

From the results in Table 4.2.2.3.1.2.2-7, the gains of DPCCH gating over
inactive periods grow for larger gating periods. As we can see the gains for
VA120 are very close to the ideal gains of 3dB, 6dB and 9dB for 50%, 75% and
87.5 gating respectively.
**[Results with Code Doppler]{.underline}**
The results in this subsection assume take into account Code Doppler and
therefore the DPCCH chips will skew over time.
Tables 4.2.2.3.1.2.2-8 and 4.2.2.3.1.2.2-9 present the performance of DPCCH
demodulation for continuous reception (no gating) and three DPCCH gating
levels.

From the results in Table 4.2.2.3.1.2.2-10, the gains of DPCCH gating over
inactive periods grow for larger gating periods. As we can see, now the gains
are further away from the ideal gains of 3dB, 6dB and 9dB for 50%, 75% and
87.5 gating respectively.

for the two cases are found in Table 4.2.2.3.2.1-2. Note that all simulations

The simulated transmission patterns are continuous DPCCH transmission, gating,
gating with a 3-slot preamble, and gating with a 6-slot preamble (although the
6-slot preamble has only been simulated with the ideal parameter setting). The
repetition period of the transmission pattern is 2 frames (30 slots). The
simulated transmission pattern can be found in Figure 4.2.2.3.2.1-1. The
transmission patterns for the realistic simulation setting are the same as for
the ideal simulation setting, except that the HS-DPCCH is also transmitted
whenever the E-DCH is active. Consequently, the HS-DPCCH is active in one sub-
frame out of ten sub-frames.

No unexpected results are found, but rather the findings are in line with the
E-DCH results. However, the gains from gating are less pronounced for the CQI
than for E-DCH, and it is likely that β~hs~ needs to be increased slightly
resulting in a minor degradation of the overall gating gain.

From the figures and the table above it is clear that the gains from gating
are less for higher data rates compared to small and moderate data rates. This
is expected since the power ratio between E-DPDCH and DPCCH increases as a
function of the data rate. However, the trends are the same here as for lower
data rates, but the preamble seems to be more important in this case.
This case (2000 bits transmitted every 20 ms) might be somewhat artificial,
but it indicates that the E-DCH performance can be robust after a gating gap
also for traffic with higher data rates than VoIP.

In Figure 4.2.2.4.2-1 the cell noise rise is shown as a function of the number
of voice users. The two solid lines are from semi-analytical calculations with
continuous (blue) and gated (red) DPCCH representing the theoretical upper
bound of the system capacity with the given assumptions. The four simulated

simultaneously with E-DCH (OFF=0) and HS-DPCCH not transmitted simultaneously
with E-DCH (OFF=3).

##### 4.2.2.4.6 System-level performance with high-velocity UEs
The simulated radio network consists of 12 three-sector sites (36 cells) with
1.5 km site-to-site distance deployed in an ordinary hexagonal layout. Wrap-
around is used to prevent border effects. Standard models for distance
attenuation (29+35*log(d) where d is distance [m]), shadow fading (lognormal
with standard deviation of 8 dB) and, multi-path fading (3GPP Typical Urban)
are used.
A comprehensive WCDMA system model is used. The physical layer models,
comprising quality models, measurement models and power control models, have
slot-level time resolution. Hybrid ARQ with 8 parallel processes and Chase
combining are included. An RLC protocol configured in unacknowledged mode is
modeled in detail.
The speech codec is AMR12.2 and the speech activity is 50%, with on and off
periods distributed exponentially.
Headers are compressed using RoHC (for VoIP) and we assume a constant state
where the remaining header size is 3 bytes throughout the simulation. The
scheduler is QoS-aware and determines priority based on delay (after a packet
has arrived at the buffer). The total time for scheduling and HARQ
retransmissions is maximum 100ms.
Some simulation parameters are given in Table 4.2.2.4.6-1.

Figure 4.2.2.4.6-1 depicts the capacity gain with gating mechanism at the
velocities 3 km/h and 100 km/h. The DPCCH update interval is set to every
8^th^ TTI. A 3-slot DPCCH preamble is used before actual data is transmitted.
Note that HS-DPCCH is not modeled here**. The relative capacity gain with
gating is in the order of 80% for 3 km/h and in the order of 70% for 100
km/h.**

(The solid blue curve represents the capacity obtained with UL DPCCH gating if
the UL TPC loop could be fully functional also during the gaps.)
#### 4.2.2.5 UE battery saving calculations
Following assumptions are used in the simplified UE power saving calculations.
1) The percentage of power saving of tx side and rx side, respectively, for
certain tx power level, txpwr, when gating is not used:
\- tx side consumes N1 mA @ txpwr
\- rx side consumes N2 mA
> No specific data rates were assumed here either in uplink or downlink, for
> simplification.
2) The tx side power consumption, if tx gating is used:
\- tx side consumes N1_gating mA, during gating @ txpwr
3) The rx side power consumption, if discontinuous reception possibility is
utilised:
\- rx side consumes N2_gating mA, during gating
4) The savings for tx and rx parts power consumption:
where:
N1_total_new = (1-DPCCH_gating_%)*N1 + DPCCH_gating_%*N1_gating
N2_total_new = (1-DRX_%)*N2 + DRX_%*N2_gating
Tables 4.2.2.5-1, 4.2.2.5-2 and 4.2.2.5-3 show the UE tx and rx parts power
saving for VoIP and inactive user (in CELL_DCH) case, for assumptions N1 =
30%, 50% and 70% of the (N1+N2), respectively. Inactive user meaning user that
is in CELL_DCH state, but neither transmitting nor receiving any data. Thus
the only difference in calculating the UE tx and rx parts power saving for
VoIP with different TTI lengths and inactive user case, is the value used for
DPCCH_gating_% value.
0% would mean no saving (same power consumption as with continuous
transmission and reception) and 100% would mean that all power is saved and no
power consumed.

### 4.2.3 Benefits of the concept
\- Less air interface capacity consumption per UE due to reduced UL DPCCH and
F-DPCH noise contribution and therefore also increased UE battery life time
compared to REL-6.*
\- Compared to REL-6: Increased number of temporarily inactive users that can
stay in CELL_DCH and that can therefore get active in a very short time
avoiding frequent transitions to CELL_FACH.*
\- Concept is intended to address also VoIP users between packet
transmissions.
*: Better than for "SIR_target reduction" the more UL DPCCH is gated.
### 4.2.4 Open issues of the concept
\- Impact on inner loop power control in UL & DL.
\- How often/when will UL DPCCH and F-DPCH be sent for inactive users (how are
the activity patterns designed?) in order to maintain power control stability
and synchronisation status.
\- How is reactivation started and the UL DPCCH power set after each UL DPCCH
and F-DPCH gating gap? Longer power ramping needed?
\- Modifying the CQI reporting for HSDPA from Release 6 could enable higher
gains for Uplink DPCCH Gating.
\- DL & UL have to be inactive at the same time during UL DPCCH gating.
\- Impact on power balancing mechanism. (Note: This is not an issue if TPC
based power control is not applied to F-DPCH/DPCCH.)
## 4.3 SIR_target reduction
### 4.3.1 Description of the concept
The proposed concept has the goal of substantially reducing the Tx power of
the UL DPCCH (and thus, the generated noise rise) by reducing SIR_target
during idle traffic periods, i.e. when nothing needs to be transmitted in UL
on the E-DPDCH.
It is an important characteristic of the concept that these changes do not
involve the RNC, so that the long delays of RRC or NBAP procedures (>> 100ms)
are avoided and the user is staying in CELL_DCH state.
The \"SIR_target reduction\" could be carried out by e.g.:
\- L1 signalling: Serving Node B controls when a UE is going into an inactive
phase with a lower SIR_target and corresponding L1 signalling is used to
trigger deactivation & reactivation.
\- L2 signalling: The UE controls by L2 MAC-e signalling when the SIR_target
in the NodeBs of the active RLS is reduced, i.e. deactivation & reactivation.
\- Predefined/configured rules: Serving NodeB detects inactivity and activity
based on pre-defined or configured rules and reduces the SIR target by a pre-
defined or configured offset during periods of inactivity.
#### 4.3.1.1 L1 signalling approach
**Traffic inactivity detection:**
The absence of data to be transmitted on E-DCH in the UL can be detected by
observing the current occupation of the MAC-e buffer which is known by the
MAC-e scheduler in the Node B through scheduling information received from the
UE. A deactivation start timer/timeout (starting when a buffer runs empty) can
be used to avoid unnecessary switching between active and inactive mode during
very short traffic intermissions.
**SIR_target reduction:**
When detecting the inactivity condition in the UL, the serving Node B reduces
the target SIR for the UL power control from the last RNC-configured value to
a pre-determined target value (for reliable TPC detection). The inner loop
power control for the uplink will automatically reduce the Tx power of the UE
on the UL DPCCH (by a sequence of \'power down\' steps) to adjust to the new
target. This autonomous reduction of the SIR target is not in conflict with
the outer loop power control of the SRNC, as the transmitted power will not be
permitted to become higher than the RNC-configured value. In the following
text such a phase of reduced Tx power on UL DPCCH during the inactive traffic
phase is also called \'reduced power mode\'.
The serving Node B informs the UE about the change by physical layer
signalling. This can be implemented as a new signalling message on the HS-
SCCH, using one of the 8 unused bit combinations within the 7 bits assigned to
the channelization code set.
The SIR_target reduction with L1 signalling is considered applicable even when
a transmission on HSDPA is still active (and therefore the transmission of the
HS-DPCCH takes place). To assure the reliable operation of HSDPA after the
SIR_target reduction, a mechanism to compensate the UL DPCCH TX power lowering
should be introduced. The application of a power offset on HS-DPCCH is
analyzed for non-SHO and for CQI reports in section 4.3.2.6.x. An application
of a power offset on UL DPCCH is ffs.
One of the methods to inform UE about HS-DPCCH power offset to DPCCH value
change is to utilize HS-SCCH signalling. In this approach the Node B has the
possibility to send the new and exact value of the power offset to the UE.
This procedure will assure a reliable transmission on the HS-DPCCH while
applying the SIR_target reduction concept to DPCCH.
**Triggering reactivation:**
When a UE is in a \'reduced power mode\' a reactivation is triggered by the
arrival of new data in the MAC queue. New data for UL in the MAC-e buffer will
first be detected in the UE and must be brought to the attention of the
serving Node B. 2 alternatives are (preference for the second):
1\. HARQ with possible UL power offset:\ The UE immediately transmits a MAC-e
PDU as it would do in the normal E-DCH configuration. Note that the E-DPCCH
and E-DPDCH are transmitted with a given power offset from the DPCCH power,
and will therefore be power-reduced, when the DPCCH is power-reduced. As a
mere trigger for reactivation it is, however, not necessary that the initial
transmission can be correctly detected in the receiving Node B. It is
sufficient that signal presence is recognized by the Node B at all, since this
would trigger the Node B to restore the usual UL power control and the
corresponding HARQ would avoid any loss of data.\ For even better robustness
of this reactivation trigger a power offset could be applied for the first
transmission on E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH at the end of the \'reduced power mode\'.
This would give the first MAC-e PDU a fair chance to be correctly decoded, in
which case no reactivation delay would occur at all.
2\. Reactivation signal on E-DPCCH:\ Another option is that the UEs are not
allowed to transmit E-DPDCH and E-DPCCH in \'reduced power mode\' at all,
except for a reactivation signal on the E-DPCCH. For instance, the UE just
sets the \'Happy Bit\', or it transmits a predefined 10-bit sequence on the
entire E-DPCCH. The Node B restores the SIR target and initiates the
reactivation via HS-SCCH signalling. Such a trigger via E-DPCCH would be very
easy and reliable to detect (if required, a power offset as aforementioned
could also be applied). As soon as the UE receives the HS-SCCH confirmation
from the Node B (will take less than 10ms) the UE returns back to normal
operation.
**Restoring normal power control for data transmission:**
When the serving Node B recognizes a new transmission on E-DPCCH and/or
E-DPDCH from the UE in \'reduced power mode\', it starts the reactivation by
resetting the target SIR for the UL power control to the last RNC-configured
value. The inner loop PC will automatically re-adjust the Tx power on the UL
DPCCH to the new target within a few time slots.
Depending on the considered reactivation improvements (see Triggering
reactivation above), the Node B will also send a reactivation message to the
UE (via HS-SCCH), and the UE will restart regular transmissions.
Retransmission(s) of the first packet, and possible transmissions of
subsequent (non-scheduled) MAC-e PDUs will be automatically executed by the
normal HARQ and E-DCH protocols in the UE and serving Node B. Depending on the
TTI length, it may take one (for 10ms TTI) or a few TTIs (for 2ms TTI) before
the power control has settled on the normal level (if no power offset is
applied). In such a case the Node B may delay large rate grants to the UE,
until the received signal power has reached the target SIR, in order to avoid
early erroneous transmission of large scheduled PDUs.
##### 4.3.1.1.1 Interworking aspects
**Cell changes and Soft Handover:**
Measurement reports from the UE and RNC-triggered signalling of changes in the
active set and changes of the serving Node B will be transmitted on SRB over
E-DCH and HS-DSCH, and thereby trigger reactivation. Therefore the highest
gain of this concept is achieved when the reporting interval of such mobility
measurements is well above the timeout parameter that triggers the
deactivation.
SHO may be applied on UL DPCCH. Nevertheless, either the serving cell will
dominate the UL power control due to the SIR target reduction or a change of
the serving cell will be initiated by the RNC in the normal way (i.e. as in
the current specifications) and trigger a reactivation of the UE.
In case of SHO, the radio links of non-serving NodeBs would not reduce their
SIR target (as done in the serving NodeB) and these radio links might cause a
RL FAILURE. As a RL_FAILURE report will not occur before T_RLFAILURE timer has
elapsed (ranged from around 10ms to 28 sec), this problem occurs only for
longer inactivity periods than T_RLFAILURE setting, which is configured by
RNC. For such cases the following options are considered to address the
problem:
(A) The SIR target during the reduced power mode is periodically boosted in
the serving Node B to a pre-determined value (less than or equal to a 'normal'
SIR target) in order to achieve sufficient in-sync indications of radio links
from non-serving NodeBs and to avoid RL FAILURE indications. The length of
these temporary boosting periods (e.g. a few radio frames) and the periodicity
(e.g. similar value to "T_RLFAILURE" setting) of the temporary boosting
periods is indicated by RNC. The ranges of those parameters as well as the
definition of the boosted SIR target are FFS.
(B) RNC is allowed to set a limit of the lowered SIR target (minimum SIR
target) and NodeB can decide about the value of the lowered SIR target in the
range between the minimum SIR _target and the \'normal\' SIR target. With the
setting of a minimum SIR target, the RL_FAILURE probability from non-serving
NodeB can be reduced.\ As a special setting for SHO, the minimum SIR target
could be set to the normal target SIR, which means that RNC could restrict the
applicability of the SIR target reduction for SHO. The definition of a limit
set by RNC is FFS.
(C) RNC could ignore RL_FAILURE from non-serving NodeB(s) when the RL_FAILURE
is assumed to be triggered due to the SIR target reduction by serving NodeB.
The RNC could decide this based on the information available at the RNC such
as Node B and UE ability to apply CPC mode, whether the considered UE is in
SHO or not, whether the link(s) of the serving Node B have no RL FAILURE and
UL/DL traffic activity of the UE. Note that although the radio link(s) for
non-serving NodeB can be maintained by ignoring RL_FAILURE, the radio link may
be kept in out-of-sync state at non-serving NodeB.
**Reporting power gains to RNC:**
As it is the goal of the proposed concept to allow more users to get and
remain connected (without the need for intermediate RRC state switchin _g_),
it is necessary that the RNC is made aware of the savings in the received
noise rise, so that these can be taken into account in decisions e.g. for call
admission and RRC state switching. These gains will, however, automatically be
reflected in the measurements of "total received wideband power", which are
periodically reported from Node B to CRNC, anyway. Thus, no changes to the
standard measurement reporting are required for this purpose.
##### 4.3.1.1.2 Handling of VoIP traffic
VoIP traffic in UL is assumed to follow a predictable pattern of voice packets
and silence descriptors (SID) and also the timing of HARQ retransmissions is
under control of the Node B.
By setting a standard rule that the UL DPCCH SIR_target reduction is applied
in the Node B between voice packets, between SIDs, as well as between voice
packets and SIDs, the same SIR_target reduction scheme as in section 4.3.1.1
can be applied for VoIP services but with a reduced L1 signalling.\ Note: For
HARQ retransmissions the SIR_target would also be set back to normal as for
voice packets and SIDs.
Only for restarting VoIP transmissions at the UE after longer speech pauses L1
signalling in form of an E-DPCCH sequence would be used which would be
confirmed by HS-SCCH signalling from the Node B.
For the case that DL is active and UL is temporarily inactive a power offset
on HS-DPCCH and/or DPCCH might be applied to compensate for SIR_target
reduction. The details of this power offset application are ffs.\"
Parallel smaller unscheduled transmissions like SRBs should be started
directly before or after a voice packet or a SID where SIR_target is almost
unchanged.\ For other packet traffic in addition to VoIP the SIR_target
reduction as described above would only be applied by the Node B if this other
packet traffic is inactive, i.e. if no packets for the other packet traffic
are transmitted.
Figure 4.3.1.1.2-1 Illustration of an ideal SIR_target reduction profile for
VoIP packets every 20ms (HARQ retransmission and inactive phases with SIDs are
not shown in this example)
#### 4.3.1.2 L2 signalling approach
**Traffic inactivity detection:**
The UE detects autonomously the conditions for a transition into the idle
traffic mode, i.e. inactivity in the UL. The conditions for a transition into
the idle traffic mode could involve no activity for a certain minimum period
of time in UL (and DL).
When the UE has detected a transition from active mode into "idle traffic
mode" or vice versa, it can instantaneously apply the corresponding power
control parameters with respect to DPC_MODE and power control stepsize (see
below). The NodeBs in the active RLS need to be notified by the UE of the idle
traffic mode so that the NodeBs can operate with the changed parameter
settings in this mode, i.e. changed inner loop power control parameters with
respect to SIR target and DPC_MODE and power control stepsize.
The UE will inform the NodeBs about a change from active mode into idle
traffic mode and vice versa by means of a short MAC-e PDU consisting of
scheduling information (SI). For the change from active mode into idle traffic
mode, a specific SI reserved for that purpose is transmitted and repeated
through HARQ retransmissions until all NodeBs in serving and non-serving RLS
have acknowledged receipt of the transition or the maximum number of
transmissions is reached.
**SIR_target reduction:**
Upon transition of the UE into the idle traffic mode, the target SIR in the
Node Bs of the active RLS for the UL power control is reduced from the last
RNC-configured value to a pre-determined target value (for reliable TPC
detection). The inner loop power control for the uplink will automatically
reduce the Tx power of the UE on the UL DPCCH (by a sequence of \'power down\'
steps) to adjust to the new target SIR.
The robustness of the connection with a particular UE in idle traffic mode can
be improved as follows:
a) The UE modifies its UL power control by applying a higher step size when
receiving a \'power up\' TPC command on the DL DPCCH. This will keep the power
control more stable when the error rate on the UL DPCCH increases.
b) The UE uses DPC_MODE=1, i.e. the TPC commands on the UL DPCCH (for the
downlink) are repeated in 3 successive timeslots. This achieves higher
detection reliability in the Node B at the expense of a slower power
adjustment to match changing channel conditions, which is assumed to be
acceptable during idle traffic periods. The resulting reduction in the rate
for forward link power control of the F-DPCH (from 1500 Hz down to 500 Hz) is
not considered to be crucial.
When the NodeB has detected a transition from active mode into "idle traffic
mode" or vice versa, it can instantaneously apply the corresponding power
control parameters with respect to SIR target and DPC_MODE and continue.
**Triggering reactivation:**
When the UE is in idle traffic mode, it is required that the NodeB watches for
a reactivation of the UE, i.e. a transition from idle traffic mode into the
active mode.
The UE can trigger autonomously the reactivation when data is to be
transmitted in the uplink. For the change from idle traffic mode into active
mode, the actual SI is transmitted and repeated through HARQ retransmissions
until all NodeBs in serving and non-serving RLS have acknowledged receipt of
the transition.
For a reliable transmission of the SI while the UE is still in the idle
traffic mode, the UE could temporarily increase the DPCCH power (and, hence,
also the E-DCH power) in an open loop power adjustment for the time of the SI
transmission.
**Specific L2 signalling aspects:**
The reserved MAC-e SI for indicating a transition can have its own HARQ
profile with an additional power offset to ensure reliable detection by all
NodeBs in the active set with reasonable latency. The SI word specific for the
transition from active mode into idle traffic mode conveys UE buffer occupancy
of 0 (9 bits), maximum possible power ratio versus DPCCH (5 bits) and a pre-
defined logical channel ID (4 bits). While a pre-defined logical channel ID is
given in the SI word specific for the transition from active mode into idle
traffic mode, it may be noted that the transition is valid for all logical
channel IDs.

#### 4.3.1.3 Approach with predefined/configured rules
Instead of relying on signalling, predefined (and standardized) rules can be
used to control the UE and Node B behaviour, i.e., the UE and Node B could by
applying these rules have a consistent view of whether 'normal' or 'reduced'
activity transmission should be used.
In uplink, the (serving) Node B will notice whether the UE is transmitting any
data in the uplink or not. When the UE has not transmitted any data within a
predefined time interval ∆T, the (serving) Node B can estimate that the UE has
no data in the buffer and lower the SIR target by z dB in the power control
loop to reduce the interference from that UE. In order to reach the lower,
more efficient SIR level faster, the UE could simultaneously apply a negative
power offset w1 (possibly but not necessarily equal to -z dB) to its
transmission.
Note: In the special case that the transmission follows an entirely
predictable pattern, which might be the case for VoIP traffic (this is FFS),
∆T could be set to zero, resulting in an immediate SIR target reduction after
each VoIP packet.
If data enters the UE buffer when the SIR target is lowered, the UE will
according to the current specification transmit scheduling information in the
uplink. A power offset w2 can be used for the transmission of uplink
scheduling information to compensate for the lowered SIR target. This is
possible already in Rel6 using the HARQ profiles.
Note: The need for Node B receiver resources could be reduced. Methods are
FFS; see e.g. Tdoc R1-051448, 'Opportunities for resource saving in the Node B
receiver'.
The Node B will detect the presence of scheduling information after one or a
few HARQ retransmissions (if the power offset w2 is appropriately set, the
first attempt is likely to succeed). Once the Node B detects the presence of
the scheduling information, the SIR target is restored to its normal level and
the inner power control loop will ensure that the UE after a couple of slots
has adjusted its transmission power to meet the target.
Note: In the special case that the transmission follows an entirely
predictable pattern, which might be the case for VoIP traffic (this is FFS),
the Node B knows when to restore the SIR target without detecting the presence
of scheduling information.
The SIR_target reduction is considered applicable even when a transmission on
HSDPA is still active (and therefore the transmission of the HS-DPCCH takes
place). To assure the reliable operation of HSDPA after the SIR_target
reduction, a mechanism to compensate the UL DPCCH TX power lowering should be
introduced. The introduction of a new power offset for DPCCH and/or HS-DPCCH
is FFS.
For example, the SIR level could be temporarily restored during the
transmission of a CQI report (possibly also during a few slots before the CQI
report for e.g. improved channel estimation). Thus, when the CQI reporting
pattern dictates that the UE should transmit a CQI and that Node B should
receive a CQI, the UE could apply a positive power offset to its transmission
and Node B could apply the same offset to its SIR target.
The ways of handling cell changes and soft handover described for the L1
signalling approach in sub-clause 4.3.1.1.1 are equally applicable for the
approach with predefined/configured rules.
To implement the above mechanisms, higher layer signalling between the RNC and
the UE is required to configure the time interval ∆T and the power offsets w1
and w2. This signalling typically only takes place once at call setup and thus
does not lead to a significant increase in interference. Signalling is also
required between the RNC and Node B to configure the SIR target reduction z.
### 4.3.2 Analysis of the concept
#### 4.3.2.1 Simulation of the concept
The aim of this analysis is to show to which value the SIR target of the UL
DPCCH can be reduced during the inactivity phase without loosing the stability
of the inner loop power control (IL PC).
Reducing the SIR target for the UL in the Node B could make the reception of
the power control commands (TPC) on the UL DPCCH more erroneous, which in turn
could make the DL power control less reliable. Therefore the reception of the
TPC on the F-DPCH may be more erroneous, requiring extra downlink power. Thus,
the criterion to identify the maximum UL SIR target reduction is given by the
increase of DL power per F-DPCH, required to maintain a desired F-DPCH TPC
error rate (4% is usually considered).
Furthermore the simulation results show the expected time required to ramp up
the UL DPCCH power to the initial SIR target when detecting the user activity.
##### 4.3.2.1.1 Simulation assumptions
The assumed channels are: AWGN, Vehicular A at 3km/h, 30km/h and 120km/h and a
Rayleigh channel with one path at 3km/h. All the considered channels are at
the carrier frequency of 2GHz and channel estimation is applied in the
receiver.
The power control timing follows the 25.214 v6.7.0 Annex B, operation with
F-DPCH. It is assumed that the UE is able to react to a TPC command with a
power adjustment in the immediate next slot and the Node B reacts with an
extra slot delay (it is assumed here that the F-DPCH is used in the DL). It is
also assumed that the UE and Node B are capable of generating a TPC command in
the immediate next slot (in UL/DL) according to the SIR measurements of the
previous slot in the DL or UL, respectively.
The simulation assumption for UL and DL are listed in Table 4.3.2.1.1.-1 and
4.3.2.1.1.-2 respectively.

##### 4.3.2.1.2 Simulation results
From Figure 4.3.2.1.2-1 which shows F-DPCH_E~c~/I~or~ vs. the UL DPCCH SIR
target it can be seen that when lowering the UL DPCCH SIR target down to -5dB,
the transmitted F-DPCH energy per PN chip required to maintain the DL TPC
error rate at 4% increases by a very small amount (\0dB) SIR_target reductions of even more than 6dB are
possible.

The simulation result depicted in Figure 4.3.2.1.2-3 shows that the UL DPCCH
ramp up time, when restoring the UL SIR target lowered to -3dB, is on average
well below 12ms (depending on the initial UL SIR target). For realistic UL SIR
target reductions (e.g. about 6dB) it can be assumed that this ramp up is
finalized well before the first HARQ retransmission. This means that the
considered requirement for the reactivation delay (lower than 50ms) can be
fulfilled.

#### 4.3.2.2 Noise rise caused by UL DPCCH
The goal of this section is to assess the portion of the UL noise rise due to
the UL DPCCH in typical E-DCH configurations.
The analysis is based on the recent E-DPDCH demodulation performance tests,
introduced in RAN4 (see e.g. R4-050547). The results include the total
receiver Ec/N0 (including DPCCH, E-DPDCH and E-DPCCH), required to achieve 70%
of the maximum bit rate for a number of fixed reference channels (FRCs). This
corresponds to BLER of 30%.
Table 4.3.2.2-1 shows SIR target for UL DPCCH for each FRC and the value _p_
which is the percentage of own cell noise rise which is caused by one user's
UL DPCCH. _p_ is calculated for two usually considered RoT budgets: 3dB and
6dB, what corresponds to the 50% and 75% of the pole capacity.
The following can be observed:
\- The tendency is for _p_ to increase as throughput increases.
\- The DPCCH uses between about 0.8% and 4.6% of the UL resources, depending
on FRC and RoT budget.

#### 4.3.2.3 Potential gain in terms of number of additional users & UL noise
rise
The potential gain that can be achieved by a power reduction of the uplink
control channels for inactive users can best be measured by the number of
inactive user connections that can be maintained within a fixed fraction of
the allowed noise rise. This fraction must be small, as it limits the
resources available for user data transmission, but it also must be large
enough to accommodate a sufficient number of temporarily inactive users that
can be quickly scheduled when resources become free.
Example scenario: 5 active users and a control channel configuration with 1%
of the max. allowed noise rise per UL DPCCH, plus 0.67% per HS-DPCCH at full
CQI rate. These 5 active users will occupy 8.35% (= 5 x 1.67%) of the noise
rise budget with their uplink control channels and thus, would have a maximum
of 91.65% available for data traffic -- if no inactive users were allowed.

In the reference scenario (see Figure 4.3.2.3-1) it is assumed, that 20% of
these traffic resources (i.e. 20% x 91,65% = 18.33% of the max. allowed noise
rise) are reserved for uplink control channels of additional inactive users.
This would allow for a maximum of 11 (18.33% / 1.67%) inactive users with CQI
reporting per 2ms TTI.
By reducing the control channel power for these inactive users, a
substantially larger number of inactive users can be supported with the same
amount of resources, i.e. without degrading the maximum total throughput of
the 5 active users.
In case of an SIR target reduction by 6dB, the number of inactive users that
can be supported within the given noise rise budget increases from 11 to 44,
i.e. by a factor of 4. In a more conservative scenario -- SIR target reduction
by 4.5dB and a CQI reporting cycle of 4 TTIs -- the number of inactive users
can still be increased from 16 to 44, i.e. a gain factor of 2.75.
#### 4.3.2.4 Reactivation delay
Although the first transmission after reactivation is much faster with this
concept than it would be considering an RRC state change, it includes a small
reactivation delay compared to an always active user (note: Due to the UL
noise rise limitation the number of the active users is limited.)
A simple analysis shows that this additional delay (before normal scheduling
and transmission behavior of E-DCH or HS-DSCH applies) is well below 50 ms
even in the worst case, when the extra retransmission is needed.
The time for uplink reactivation comprises the transmission of the initial
MAC-e PDU or E-DPCCH trigger signal, the transmission of the reactivation
message on HS-SCCH, the power ramping to the original target SIR at the Node
B, and the time for the first transmission (or retransmission) at the full
power level.
In the worst case (10 ms EDCH TTI), the total delay is dominated by the HARQ
cycle, which allows a retransmission only after 40 ms. The HS-SCCH signalling
message and the subsequent power ramping takes only a few power control slots
and will therefore be finished well before the retransmission time.
With the 2 ms EDCH TTI, the HARQ retransmission cycle is only 16 ms, thus the
reactivation can be achieved much faster.
#### 4.3.2.5 Signalling load
Considering the L1 signalling approach:
\- the HS-SCCH capacity of 500 messages per sec (1 every 2ms),
\- the fact that a UE has to be able to read 4 HS-SCCHs in parallel,
\- the case that one HS-SCCH message would be used for deactivation and a
second HS-SCCH message would used for reactivation,
\- an average inactivity period of 5sec,
even a high number of inactive users (e.g. 80) would have only a smaller
impact on the HS-SCCH signalling load (80 x (2 msg/5sec)/(2000msg/sec) =
1,6%).
#### 4.3.2.6 CQI Performance for boosting HS-DPCCH power offset to DPCCH
This section presents some CQI over the HS-DPCCH link level results in non-
SHO, and further discusses the feasibility of beta boosting and the
possibility to keep the HSDPA downlink active during SIR target reduction.
##### 4.3.2.6.1 Simulations assumptions
Table 4.3.2.6.1-1 lists the most important simulations conditions of the
evaluation. In the simulation the SIR target is swept and, the CQI error rate
is examined for various HS-DPCCH power offsets to the DPCCH. The SIR target is
the operation point of uplink inner loop power control [6], inner loop power
control uses SIR measurements as per [7].

* * *
Based on the above results and taking as an example an operating point of 4%
for the CQI error rate it is observed that:
\- If the HS-DPCCH power offset to the DPCCH is configured relatively high
(e.g. 6 dB) then reliable detection of CQI with a reduced SIR target is
possible in non-SHO even without increasing the HS-DPCCH power offset to the
DPCCH.
\- If the HS-DPCCH power offset to the DPCCH is configured relatively low
(e.g. 0 dB), then high SIR target reduction (e.g. to 0 dB) may deteriorate CQI
performance. The presented simulation results prove that beta boosting, i.e.
increasing the HS-DPCCH power offset to the DPCCH, would then improve the CQI
error rate.
The UE can be DL active (receive HSDPA channels) and reliably transmit CQI on
the HS-DPCCH when it is in CPC mode, and the SIR target is reduced. Depending
on the configuration of the HS-DPCCH power offset to the DPCCH, beta boosting
may be useful to keep the desired CQI error rate.
### 4.3.3 Benefits of the concept
\- Less air interface capacity consumption per UE due to reduced UL DPCCH
noise contribution and therefore also increased UE battery life time compared
to REL-6.
\- Compared to REL-6: Increased number of temporarily inactive users that can
stay in CELL_DCH and that can therefore get active in a very short time
avoiding frequent transitions to CELL_FACH.
\- Power control loop is maintained for UL and DL.
\- For L1 signalling approach: no extra UL E-DPDCH transmission needed, fast
signalling and low processing effort.
\- For L2 signalling approach: reliable due to CRC for the MAC-e PDU and HARQ
retransmission mechanism, applicable in SHO.
\- For predefined/configured rules: further signalling reduction (especially
for CPC initiation).

\- Need for modification of HS-SCCH signalling (spare values exist).
\- Details of power offset on HS-DPCCH and/or UL DPCCH to compensate
SIR_target reduction in case of DL active and UL inactive.
\- Automatic DPCCH power offset or reduction by the UE might be considered for
reactivation or deactivation respectively to reduce convergence time of the
power control.

## 4.4 CQI reporting reduction
### 4.4.1 Description of the concept
The proposed concept has the goal to reduce the Tx power of the UE by reducing
the CQI reporting (thus eliminating the interference from HS-DPCCH in UL) when
no data is transmitted on HS-PDSCH in downlink. This could be achieved by
switching the CQI reporting off (\"CQI off\") or by just a reduction of CQI
reporting (\"Reduced CQI\") which does not switch off the CQI reporting
completely.
It is an important characteristic of the concept that these changes do not
involve the RNC, so that the long delays of RRC or NBAP procedures (>> 100ms)
are avoided and the user is staying in CELL_DCH state.
The \"CQI off\" and \"CQI reporting reduction\" could be carried out by e.g.:
\- L1 signalling: Serving Node B controls when a UE is going into an inactive
phase with CQI off and corresponding L1 signalling is used to trigger
deactivation & reactivation.
\- L2 signalling: The UE controls CQI off by L2 MAC-e signalling to the NodeBs
of the active RLS, i.e. deactivation & reactivation.
\- Predefined/configured rules: Both UE and NodeB detect inactivity and
activity based on either pre-defined or configured rules and reduce the CQI
reporting interval to a pre-defined or configured CQI reporting interval
during periods of inactivity.
#### 4.4.1.1 L1 signalling approach for CQI off
**Traffic inactivity detection:**
The absence of data to be transmitted on HS-DSCH in the DL can be detected by
observing the current occupation of the MAC-hs buffer located in the serving
Node B. A deactivation start timer/timeout (starting when a buffer runs empty)
can be used to avoid unnecessary switching between active and inactive mode
during very short traffic intermissions.
**Switching CQI off:**
Depending on the traffic inactivity on DL, a switching off of periodic CQI
reporting (as configured by RNC) is triggered by the serving Node B.
The serving Node B informs the UE about the change by physical layer
signalling. This can be implemented as a new signalling message on the HS-
SCCH, using one of the 8 unused bit combinations within the 7 bits assigned to
the channelization code set.
On receiving this message, the UE will immediately stop the transmission of
CQI reports on HS-DPCCH, but save the RNC-configured reporting cycle to be
restored at reactivation time. The reduction in UL interference achieved will
depend upon the CQI reporting interval configured by the UTRAN for each UE.
**Triggering reactivation:**
When the serving Node B detects the reactivation condition (new data for DL in
the MAC-hs buffer can be immediately detected in the serving Node B), it sends
a signalling message to the UE (via HS-SCCH) to trigger the restart of CQI
reporting. On receiving this message, the UE reacts by immediately restarting
CQI reports with the last RNC-configured reporting cycle.
The Node B avoids scheduling of large PDUs to the UE, until the first CQI
report has been received. Delay-critical data (e.g. SRB messages) can
immediately be scheduled when restricted to a small PDU (corresponding to low
CQI values).
##### 4.4.1.1.1 Interworking aspects
**Cell changes and Soft Handover:**
Measurement reports from the UE and RNC-triggered signalling of changes in the
active set and changes of the serving Node B will be transmitted on SRB over
E-DCH and HS-DSCH, and thereby trigger reactivation. Therefore the highest
gain of this concept is achieved when the reporting interval of such mobility
measurements is well above the timeout parameter that triggers the
deactivation.
The on- and off-switching of the CQI reports is not affected by soft handover
(SHO), as SHO is not applied on HS-DPCCH.
**Reporting power gains to RNC:**
As it is the goal of the proposed concept to allow more users to get and
remain connected (without the need for intermediate RRC state switchin _g_),
it is necessary that the RNC is made aware of the savings in the received
noise rise, so that these can be taken into account in decisions e.g. for call
admission and RRC state switching. These gains will, however, automatically be
reflected in the measurements of "total received wideband power", which are
periodically reported from Node B to CRNC, anyway. Thus, no changes to the
standard measurement reporting are required for this purpose.
#### 4.4.1.2 L2 signalling approach for CQI off
**Traffic inactivity detection:**
The UE detects autonomously the conditions for a transition into the idle
traffic mode, i.e. inactivity in the DL. The conditions for a transition into
the idle traffic mode could involve no activity for a certain minimum period
of time in DL (and UL).
When the UE has detected a transition from active mode into "idle traffic
mode" or vice versa, it can instantaneously stop or resume CQI reporting. When
the NodeB has detected a transition from active mode into "idle traffic mode"
or vice versa, it can instantaneously continue or stop decoding the CQI
information.
The UE will inform the NodeBs about a change from active mode into idle
traffic mode and vice versa by means of a short MAC-e PDU consisting of
scheduling information (SI). For the change from active mode into idle traffic
mode, a specific SI reserved for that purpose is transmitted and repeated
through HARQ retransmissions until all NodeBs in serving and non-serving RLS
have acknowledged receipt of the transition or the maximum number of
transmissions is reached.
**Switching CQI off:**
Periodic CQI reporting (as configured by RNC) can be switched off when data
inactivity on the downlink has been detected by the UE. In particular, the UE
immediately stops the transmission of CQI reports on HS-DPCCH upon transition
into the idle traffic mode. Since no HS-PDSCH data is transmitted in an idle
traffic period, ACK/NACK signalling is not required and HS-DPCCH is completely
switched off, thus also reducing the UL interference. The RNC-configured CQI
reporting cycle is saved and can be restored instantaneously at reactivation
time.
**Triggering reactivation:**
A NodeB can trigger reactivation by sending a short MAC-hs PDU in the
downlink, which is then followed by the reactivation through transmitting SI
by the UE in the uplink.
For the change from idle traffic mode into active mode, the actual SI is
transmitted and repeated through HARQ retransmissions until receipt of the
transition is acknowledged.
**Specific L2 signalling aspects:**
The reserved MAC-e SI for indicating a transition can have its own HARQ
profile with an additional power offset to ensure reliable detection by all
NodeBs in the active set with reasonable latency. The SI word specific for the
transition from active mode into idle traffic mode conveys UE buffer occupancy
of 0 (9 bits), maximum possible power ratio versus DPCCH (5 bits) and a pre-
defined logical channel ID (4 bits). While a pre-defined logical channel ID is
given in the SI word specific for the transition from active mode into idle
traffic mode, it may be noted that the transition is valid for all logical
channel IDs.

#### 4.4.1.3 Predefined/configured rules for CQI reporting reduction
Instead of relying on signalling, predefined (and standardized) rules can be
used to control the UE and Node B behaviour, i.e., the UE and Node B could by
applying these rules have a consistent view of whether 'normal' or 'reduced'
activity transmission should be used.
In the downlink direction, the Node B is clearly aware of whether there is
data awaiting transmission. The UE will notice whether it has been recently
scheduled or not, which provides an indication about the downlink activity and
correspondingly whether the UE shall use 'normal' or 'reduced' activity
transmission for the uplink CQI reporting.
Currently, a single CQI reporting pattern is defined for HSDPA, where a
regular reporting interval can be configured. By defining an additional CQI
reporting pattern (which can have a configurable reporting interval different
from the first pattern) to be used in 'reduced' activity transmission, a
solution not requiring signalling can be achieved. Normally, the UE reports
CQI using the frequent reporting pattern, i.e., transmits a CQI report once
every x~1~ ms. If the UE has not been scheduled for a certain (configurable)
time period, the UE switches to a second, 'reduced activity' CQI reporting
pattern, i.e., reports CQI every x~2~ ms, where x~2~>x~1~.
Note that the CQI reporting patterns as a special case may include switching
off the reporting completely (basically setting x~i~ to infinity). One
possibility to implement this is to (re)start a timer in the UE every time it
is scheduled. Once the timer reaches zero, the UE switches from pattern 1 to
pattern 2. The Node B can use a corresponding timer mechanism (one per UE) to
determine whether to expect pattern 1 or pattern 2.
Furthermore, it may be beneficial, although not absolutely necessary, to
select the patterns such that x~1~ is a factor in x~2~. If, e.g., due to the
UE missing the HS-SCCH and the Node B not detecting the absence of an ACK/NAK
on the HS-DPCCH, the UE and Node B happens to use different patterns there are
at least some reporting events that coincide with this choice of patterns.
Alternatively, Node B could detect the presence of CQI every x~1~ ms
regardless of whether CQI reporting is reduced or not.
To implement the above mechanisms, higher layer signalling between the RNC and
the UE is required to configure the CQI reporting intervals x~i~. This
signalling typically only takes place once at call setup and thus does not
lead to a significant increase in interference. Signalling is also required
between the RNC and Node B to configure the CQI reporting patterns x~i~.
### 4.4.2 Analysis of the concept
#### 4.4.2.1 Gain in terms of number of additional users & UL noise rise
The gain that can be achieved by switching CQI reporting off, in terms of
reducing the noise rise consumed by HS-DPCCH, depends on several factors:
\- Interval of CQI reporting (this can be configured between once per 2ms
HSDPA TTI and once per 160ms). The more often the CQI is reported the higher
is the gain of switching CQI reporting off.
\- The power of the HS-DPCCH. The higher the HS-DPCCH power the higher the
gain of switching CQI reporting off.\ During DL inactivity the ACK/NACK field
(first of the 3 slots) of HS-DPCCH is automatically DTXed.\ The HS-DPCCH power
is defined relative to the UL DPCCH power via the signalled value Δ~CQI~ which
translates into an amplitude ratio β~hs~/ β~c~ = 1/3 ..2 (i.e. -9.5dB .. 6dB),
see 25.213 [5] and 25.214 [6].\ Due to same SF, similar channel coding if TFCI
carried by UL DPCCH and similar required reliability it could be assumed that
HS-DPCCH and UL DPCCH are transmitted with similar power (i.e. power ratio of
0dB).
Assuming one CQI reporting per 2ms HSDPA TTI (which is the highest reporting
cycle), a power ratio of HS-DPCCH/DPCCH of 0dB and that the UL DPCCH SIR
target is configured so that it consumes 1% of the maximum allowed noise rise
then switching CQI reporting off will reduce the noise rise produced by one
user from 1.67% to 1%. This gain translates into the increase of the number of
inactive users by the gain factor of 1.67.
#### 4.4.2.2 Signalling load
Considering the L1 signalling approach:
\- the HS-SCCH capacity of 500 messages per sec (1 every 2ms),
\- the fact that a UE has to be able to read 4 HS-SCCHs in parallel,
\- the case that one HS-SCCH message would be used for deactivation and a
second HS-SCCH message would used for reactivation,
\- an average inactivity period of 5sec,
even a high number of inactive users (e.g. 80) would have only a smaller
impact on the HS-SCCH signalling load (80 x (2 msg/5sec)/(2000msg/sec) =
1,6%).
### 4.4.3 Benefits of the concept
\- Less air interface capacity consumption per UE due to reduced UL DPCCH
noise contribution and therefore also increased UE battery life time compared
to REL-6.
\- Compared to REL-6: Increased number of temporarily inactive users that can
stay in CELL_DCH and that can therefore get active in a very short time
avoiding frequent transitions to CELL_FACH.
\- Possibility to address UL noise rise reduction in case of DL inactivity.
\- for L1 signalling approach for CQI off: no extra UL E-DPDCH transmission
needed, fast signalling and low processing effort.
\- for L2 signalling approach for CQI off: reliable due to CRC for the MAC-e
PDU and HARQ retransmission mechanism.
\- for predefined/configured rules: further signalling reduction (especially
for CPC initiation)
### 4.4.4 Open issues of the concept
\- Need for modification of HS-SCCH signalling (spare values exist).
\- Applicability for VoIP?
\- Need for sending CQIs from time to time? Or is CQI off sufficient?
## 4.5 DRX at the UE
### 4.5.1 Description of the concept
\- In case of discontinuous transmissions or sustained DL and UL inactivity,
the UE and UTRAN may limit the number of subframes where the UE needs to
monitor the HS-SCCH so that:
\- DL scheduling is still possible
\- UE is able to shut-off the receiver circuitry over some periods of time to
yield a non 100% receiver duty cycle.
\- Minimum monitoring of CPICH for the UE to keep up with changes in its
Active Set due to mobility.
\- The UE monitors a limited subset of HS-SCCHs in the time domain e.g., one
subframe every two, or every four subframes -- this DRX operation is
controlled by the "HS-SCCH transmission cycle".
Note: This concept alone does not solve the problems of limitations in number
of users per cell or limitations in UL noise rise or reduction in latency for
temporarily inactive users addressed by the WI. Therefore it will only be
considered if it can be applied as add-on to the concepts addressing the
objectives of the WI.
### 4.5.2 Analysis of the concept
The DRX concept is complementary to the DPCCH gating (DTX) concept introduced
in section 4.2. Indeed, the DPCCH gating concept will effectively open
transmission gaps during which no PHY channels are transmitted from the UE. It
would be, therefore, desirable to open reception gaps aligned as much as
possible with those transmission gaps so that the UE could effectively go to
sleep and hence extend its battery life (talk-time).
In order to analyze the concept we look into the following aspects:
\- How the DTX and DRX cycles can be maximally aligned.
\- What is the performance impact at the DL scheduler.
#### 4.5.2.1 Timing, with 2 ms E-DCH TTI
##### 4.5.2.1.1 Background
Figure 4.5.2.1.1-1 details the relative HARQ timings for HSDPA and HSUPA.
Figure 4.5.2.1.1-1: HSDPA/HSUPA relative HARQ timing
It is worth to note that for HSDPA:
\- The data acknowledgment is sent 7.5 slots after the end of the transmission
of a HS-PDSCH subframe over the HS-DPCCH.
\- A data retransmission can occur between 5 and 7 TTIs later
While for HSUPA:
\- The data acknowledgment is sent 9.7\~12.6 slots after the end of the
transmission of the corresponding E-DPDCH subframe over the E-HICH.
\- A data retransmission can only be sent 7 TTIs later
In the following discussion, we synchronize these events so that they coincide
as much as possible. Since it is not desirable to change the above timing, we
can only choose which subframes the UE is monitoring or is allowed to use for
transmission. These restrictions have to be well shared and synchronized with
the Node B as the latter has to take them into account when scheduling the
HDSPA packets.
The parameter "n" of $\tau_{\text{DPCH},n}$, which defines the offset for the
UE (see Figure 4.5.2.1.1-1), creates a variability in the relative position of
the HSDPA and HSUPA channels. With different values of n, the success of
channel synchronization will vary.
##### 4.5.2.1.2 DRX mode 2/8
In this mode, the UE can be scheduled and is allowed to transmit every 4^th^
subframe as depicted in Figure 4.5.2.1.2-1 and Figure 4.5.2.1.2-2. A DTX cycle
of 4 TTIs, defines the E-DPDCH and E-HICH timelines. If we want to keep that
DTX cycle almost unchanged, the UE transmission on the UL HS-DPCCH has to
coincide with the DTX awake periods. This falls nicely as the UE reception
would also fall in the same periods. By preserving the DTX cycle, we create an
overlapping DRX cycle. This allows the UE to go to sleep when it is neither
receiving or transmitting.
Sleeping is optional for the UE. The time to switch between the awake and
sleep states is implementation dependent. The subsequent figures show skirts
around the combined channel activity time to illustrate this concept. However,
this is for illustration purposes only.
With arbitrarily chosen wakeup and sleep delays and averaging over n, which
defines the offset for the UE (see Figure 4.5.2.1.1-1), a UEs can achieve 31%
of DTX/DRX time.

##### 4.5.2.1.3 DRX mode 1/8
In this mode, the UE is scheduled and is allowed to transmit every 8^th^
subframe. The transmission and reception cycles are offset by 4 frames to
separate transmission and reception operations. This allows DTX and DRX
periods of 75%, however, the combined DTX/DRX average period is 42% at the UE.

##### 4.5.2.1.4 DRX mode 1/16 and beyond
In this mode, the UE is scheduled and is allowed to transmit every 16^th^
subframe. The transmission and reception cycles are offset by 4 frames to
combine the transmission operations. In this mode, the UE can achieve DTX/DRX
periods of 60%. Note that if the UE chooses to transmit and that transmission
is NACK-ed, the UE will have to wake up at the appropriate time (7 subframes
later) to re-transmit. This case is not depicted below.
{width="6.4944444444444445in" height="3.1069444444444443in"}

If longer DTX cycles are allowed, DRX cycles can be tailored that are similar
to this 1/16 mode.
##### 4.5.2.1.5 DRX mode 2/8, in a 2 way soft handover
In the following, we assume the UE is in a 2 way soft handover between two
Node B's and that the UE is assigned **n1** and **n2** as offsets from the
Node B's.
Per 25.214, "UTRAN starts the transmission of the downlink DPCCH/DPDCH or F-
PCH for each new radio link at a frame timing such that the frame timing
received at the UE will be within T~0~ ± 148 chips prior to the frame timing
of the uplink DPCCH/DPDCH at the UE". We can assume that all Node Bs have
adjusted their transmission times so that hypothetical DPCH channels would
arrive at the same time. Since that arrival time dictates the E-DPCH offset,
we can pick as a reference an enabled TTI subframe. The E-HICH subframes will
be [9.7 to 12.6] slots after this enabled E-DPCH depending on the Node B. By
design, they will fall within a subframe of each other.
The choice of the HS-PDSCH subframe (and consequently the associated HS-DPCCH)
is based on the closest E-DPCH subframe that optimizes the DTX/DRX cycle.
However, the E-RGCH from the non-serving cell is 10 ms long, preventing any
DRX during this mode of operation.
If we ignore the E-RGCH from the non-serving cell, averaging over n1 and n2,
the UE can sleep 26% of the time.
##### 4.5.2.1.6 DRX mode 1/8, in a 2 way soft handover
The 10ms E-RGCH impacts the possible DRX cycle, however, we can still achieve
on average **24%** of sleep time. In the worse case scenario, the sleep time
drops to **15%**. In the best cases, the UE can sleep up to **27%** of the
time.
If we ignore the E-RGCH from the non-serving cell, averaging over n1 and n2,
the UE can sleep 36% of the time. At a worse case scenario, the sleep time
drops to 22%. In the best cases, the UE can sleep up to 46% of the time.
Figure 4.5.2.1.6-1 shows an example of handover between two Node Bs with sleep
times of 27%.

##### 4.5.2.1.7 DRX mode 1/16, in a 2 way soft handover
In this mode, we can achieve on average **39%** of sleep time.The sleep time
varies between **33%** and **44%**. Figure 4.5.2.1.7-1 shows an example of
handover between two Node Bs with sleep times of 39%.

#### 4.5.2.2 Downlink scheduler performance
When a UE is in a DRX mode, the scheduler is restricted with regard to the
times it can choose to schedule this UE on the DL. This could result in a
degradation of the performance of the scheduler measured with the Average
Outage Probability. Figures 4.5.2.2-1 and 4.5.2.2-2 show that the Average
Outage Probability degradation is acceptable (less than 5%) for all channel
models considered when we are well below the system capacity.
While the DRX mode allows the UE to extend its battery life, it is under
UTRAN's control, and thus can be deactivated if the DL scheduler is running
short. At high system loads, the UTRAN can disable this function to optimize
its resource allocation.

The same basic time relationships remain between the HSDPA/HSUPA channels,

##### 4.5.2.2A.2 DRX mode 1/2
As can be noted from Figure 4.5.2.2A.1-1, the need to receive E-HICH, E-RGCH
and E-AGCH result in no sleep time.
##### 4.5.2.2A.3 DRX mode 1/3
It is possible to operate in this mode, however, the UE DRX sleep mode is
upper bounded by about 6 slots which is around 13%.
##### 4.5.2.2A.4 DRX mode 1/4
We can achieve on average **24.6%** of sleep time. In the worse case scenario,
the sleep time drops to **20.5%**. In the best cases, the UE can sleep up to
**29.3%** of the time.
Figure 4.5.2.2A.4-1 shows an example of handover between two Node Bs with
sleep times of 25%.

##### 4.5.2.2A.5 DRX mode ¼, in a 2 way soft handover
The 10ms E-RGCH still impacts the possible DRX cycle, we can achieve on
average **18.2%** of sleep time. In the worse case scenario, the sleep time
drops to **3.3%**. In the best cases, the UE can sleep up to **27.6%** of the
time.
If we ignore the E-RGCH from the non-serving cell, averaging over n1 and n2,
the UE can sleep 24.6% of the time. At a worse case scenario, the sleep time
drops to 20.5% . In the best cases, the UE can sleep up to 29.3% of the time.
These results are as similar to the case where we are not in soft handover.
Figure 4.5.2.2A.5-1 shows an example of handover between two Node Bs with
sleep times of 23%.

handover, 23% sleep time
The HS-PDSCH transmissions have to occur when the UE wakes up so that the ACKs
can be sent before it goes to sleep. More transmissions can occur than shown
while the UE is awake, even if that means that the UE would have to stay
longer awake to send the ACKs.

### 4.5.4 Open issues of the concept
## 4.6 Restricted HS-SCCH
### 4.6.1 Description of the concept
The objective of the restricted HS-SCCH is to reduce HS-SCCH power
requirements compared to the existing Rel-6 HS-SCCH (henceforth called legacy
HS-SCCH) by
\- eliminating HS-SCCH transmissions during HARQ retransmissions,
\- reducing the payload carried over the HS-SCCH during new transmissions, and
\- jointly encoding the entire HS-SCCH payload and transmitting the codeword
over all three slots of HS-SCCH transmission, in contrast to the existing
scheme where part 1 and part 2 HS-SCCH information are encoded and transmitted
independently. We discuss in Section 4.6.1.5 how this affects the ability of
the UE to detect the HS-SCCH in time to start buffering HS-PDSCH signals.
Under the proposed scheme, higher layers configure each HSDPA flow to use
either the legacy HS-SCCH or the restricted HS-SCCH that is proposed in this
contribution, depending on the type of traffic carried on the flow (e.g., VoIP
or best effort) and on whether or not the UE is capable of receiving the
restricted HS-SCCH. Once a flow is thus configured, the Node-B transmits the
specified type of HS-SCCH to the UE whenever that flow is scheduled.
The physical channel slot structure of the restricted HS-SCCH is the same as
that of the legacy HS-SCCH. As in the current specification, the network
configures each cell with a set of HS-SCCH channelization codes at SF128, and
configures each HSDPA UE to monitor at most four of these codes. Any of the
HS-SCCH channelization codes in the cell may be used in any TTI to carry
either a legacy HS-SCCH or an restricted HS-SCCH. In other words, both the
legacy HS-SCCH and the restricted HS-SCCH share the same set of channelization
codes, and there is no need to reserve certain HS-SCCH codes for the enhanced
mode of operation.
It is possible for a user to use both the legacy HS-SCCH and the restricted
HS-SCCH if the user is configured with both a VoIP flow and a non-VoIP flow
simultaneously. In this case, any one of the HS-SCCH codes monitored by the UE
may be used in a given TTI to carry a legacy HS-SCCH or the restricted HS-SCCH
in a TTI, depending on which of the user's flows is scheduled.
#### 4.6.1.1 HARQ Operation and Signalling
The following changes to HARQ operation are made for an HSDPA flow that is
configured to use the restricted HS-SCCH.
\- Synchronous HARQ retransmissions are used for the flow. In other words, the
nth HARQ transmission for a packet is implicitly scheduled at a fixed time
following the (n-1)th failed transmission, provided that HARQ is not
terminated. This allows the UE to determine the time of a retransmission
without relying on HS-SCCH signalling. The scheduler may still terminate HARQ
for any packet arbitrarily at any time. New transmissions can be scheduled at
any time, just like in the current operation.
\- The restricted HS-SCCH is transmitted along with a new HARQ transmission
for this flow. No HS-SCCH is transmitted for a retransmission. The possible
issue of buffer corruption due to this is addressed in Section 4.6.4.1.2.
\- A maximum limit is imposed on the number of HARQ transmissions for this
flow. The maximum number of HARQ transmissions for the flow is configured by
higher layers. Since there is no HS-SCCH transmission during retransmissions,
there is a need to bound the number of retransmissions that the UE will
consider after the initial transmission. In the absence of such a restriction,
one can think of scenarios when the UE will be unable to determine exactly
when the Node-B has terminated HARQ for a packet, thereby leading to
unnecessary NACK transmissions on the HS-DPCCH.
\- The restricted HS-SCCH does not carry any HARQ information. The HARQ
process number is not required because of synchronous retransmissions: there
is no ambiguity at the UE in associating a retransmission with the
corresponding first transmission. When the restricted HS-SCCH is used, the
redundancy version (RV) parameter is implicitly determined by the HARQ
transmission number. The design of the sequence of RV parameters as a function
of the HARQ transmission number is FFS. The new data indicator is not required
since the restricted HS-SCCH is transmitted only for new transmissions.
#### 4.6.1.2 Signalling of transport format
The following modifications apply to HSDPA flows that are associated with the
restricted HS-SCCH.
\- Only QPSK modulation is allowed.
\- Only one OVSF code is allowed per HS-DSCH transmission, whereby the code
for any transmission is chosen from a set of up to four codes that is
configured by higher layers for that flow. Higher layers also signal a fixed
mapping between the set of HS-SCCH codes that are monitored by the UE and a
corresponding set of HS-PDSCH channelization codes, such that the HS-PDSCH
channelization code used in a new HS-DSCH transmission is uniquely determined
by the HS-SCCH code on which this transmission is signalled, without
explicitly transmitting any channelization code information on the HS-SCCH. It
is important to note that this scheme does not impose any additional
restriction on the ability of the MAC-hs scheduler to schedule a particular
set of code multiplexed VoIP users, compared to a scheme where one code from a
pre-defined set of four channelization codes is explicitly signalled on the
HS-SCCH using 2 bits. An example of how the network can allocate codes using
this scheme is the following. If there are _M_ HS-SCCH channels configured in
a cell, no more than _M_ HS-PDSCH codes may be used in one TTI for
transmission of VoIP flows, due to the restriction that each VoIP flow may use
no more than one code. Therefore, the network may impose a one-to-one mapping
between the set of _M_ HS-SCCH channels and a set of _M_ HS-PDSCH codes, and
use any remaining HS-PDSCH codes only for non-VoIP flows. An example of this
scheme is shown in Figure 4.6.1.2-1, where _M_ =6 HS-SCCH channels are
available, and 10 OVSF codes, numbered 7 through 16, are available for HS-
PDSCH. The network may establish a mapping between HS-SCCH and HS-PDSCH codes
as shown in the figure. The network would then signal portions of this mapping
to each UE based on the set of HS-SCCH channels that are monitored by that UE.
The channelization code mapping is used only for transmissions that use the
restricted HS-SCCH. Legacy HS-SCCH will continue to operate as specified in
the Release-6 specification, whereby any HS-SCCH channel that is monitored by
the UE may be used in conjunction with any set of HS-PDSCH channelization
codes.
Figure 4.6.1.2-1: Mapping between HS-SCCH channels and HS-PDSCH codes that
enables the UE to determine the transmitted HS-PDSCH code without explicit
signnaling on HS-SCCH.
\- The channelization code used for a retransmission must be the same as the
one used in the original transmission of that MAC-hs PDU.
\- Choice of transport block size is limited to one of at most four different
pre-configured transport block sizes. The set of up to four allowed block
sizes is configured by higher layers. The restricted HS-SCCH signals an index
into this set of block sizes.
The selection of the above restrictions is based on the characteristics of
VoIP transmissions. Simulation studies have shown that there is no significant
degradation in VoIP performance or capacity by eliminating the use of 16-QAM
modulation and by limiting the number of HS-PDSCH codes per transmission to
one. Simulations have also shown that no more than three block sizes are used
most of the time for VoIP transmissions. Multiple block sizes are required to
support silence (SID) frames and voice frame aggregation in the MAC-hs layer,
whereby the MAC-hs scheduler concatenates one or more MAC-d PDUs in one MAC-hs
PDU.
The size of the pre-configured set of channelization codes for a flow is
selected to balance a trade-off between HS-SCCH signalling requirements and
the flexibility that is provided to the scheduler in code multiplexing
different VoIP users in one TTI. If the size of the set is larger than four,
we will require at least one bit of additional HS-SCCH signalling for
channelization code information, and thereby increase its transmit power
requirements. If the size of the pre-configured set of codes is smaller than
four, the scheduler may find it difficult to multiplex certain sets of users
together in a TTI. If the scheduler selects a set of K users to be code
multiplexed in a TTI, then for successful allocation of unique codes to each
of them, the restricted channelization sets for the K users must satisfy the
following criterion: there exists a code c(k) in the kth user's restricted
code set such that c(k1) ≠ c(k2) whenever k1 ≠ k2. This becomes less likely as
the size of the restricted code set is reduced.
#### 4.6.1.3 Coding for HS-SCCH
A block diagram of the restricted HS-SCCH coding chain is shown in Figure
4.6.1.3-1. The coding chain is described below.
Figure 4.6.1.3-1: Coding for restricted HS-SCCH
**\- CRC addition**. A 16-bit UE-specific CRC is added to the 2-bit TBS
information. To do this, a 16-bit CRC is first computed corresponding to the 2
TBS bits, according to the specification in Section 4.2.1 in [4]. The CRC
remainder is then masked with the 16-bit UE ID as specified in Section 4.6.4
in [4]. The block obtained after CRC addition is 18 bits long.
**\- Channel coding**. The 18-bit bock is encoded using the rate 1/3,
constraint length 9 convolutional code that is used in the current HS-SCCH
specification. The output of the encoder has 78 coded bits, including tail
bits.
**\- Rate matching**. Repetition is performed according to the specification
in Section 4.2.7 in [4] to match the 78 coded bits to 120 physical channel
bits.
**\- Interleaving**. A channel interleaver is used on the coded bits after
rate matching according to the specification of the "2^nd^ interleaver" in
Section 4.2.11 in [4].
**\- Physical channel mapping**. The 120 bits from the output of the channel
interleaver are mapped in sequence to the 120 physical channel bits available
in the HS-SCCH subframe.
#### 4.6.1.4 HS-SCCH physical channel structure
The physical channel structure of the restricted HS-SCCH is identical to that
of the legacy HS-SCCH: it has a fixed rate of 60kbps, operates at SF=128 and
is transmitted over an HS-SCCH subframe that is 3 slots long. Timing of the
HS-SCCH relative to HS-PDSCH also remains unchanged.
#### 4.6.1.5 UE reception of the restricted HS-SCCH
One of the consequences of encoding HS-SCCH information jointly across the
whole 2ms TTI is that the UE will need to wait till the end of the HS-SCCH TTI
in order to decode it. However, it may be desirable for the UE to detect the
information it requires to start buffering and processing HS-PDSCH signals
_before_ the beginning of the corresponding HS-PDSCH transmission. A simple
method is suggested in this section that can be used by the UE to detect the
HS-SCCH after receiving only the first slot of HS-SCCH transmission.
The method exploits the fact that there are only four possible HS-SCCH
codewords---corresponding to the four choices for transport block size---that
could possibly be intended for a particular UE. The total number of codewords
that may be transmitted on the restricted HS-SCCH is
$2^{\text{18}},$corresponding to the different values taken by the 16-bit UE
ID and the 2-bit TBS. Since the UE ID is fixed for any particular UE, it is
only required to detect the presence of any of the four codewords that
correspond to the UE. The UE may pre-compute the list of four HS-SCCH
codewords that are consistent with its UE ID, and store only the portions of
these codewords that are transmitted in the first slot. Upon receiving the
first slot of HS-SCCH signal, the UE would compute a confidence metric by
comparing the partial received signal with the stored set of four partial
codewords, and use the maximum of the four metrics as a measure of confidence
that the corresponding HS-SCCH transmission was intended for it. The
confidence metric may be computed based on the distance metric between the
received signal and the stored partial codewords, or, equivalently, as the
correlation of the received signal with the partial codewords. A decision to
start buffering the corresponding HS-PDSCH code can be made by performing a
threshold test on this confidence measure. Choice of the threshold can be made
to ensure a desired low probability of mis-detection.
Once the UE detects that a particular restricted HS-SCCH transmission is
intended for it, no other information is required from the HS-SCCH for the UE
to start buffering the HS-PDSCH signal, since the channelization code is known
from the HS-SCCH channel number, and modulation is always QPSK.
### 4.6.2 Analysis of the concept
The HS-SCCH fields carried on the restricted HS-SCCH for new HARQ
transmissions are described below. Table 4.6.2-1 provides a comparative
summary of the HS-SCCH payload for the legacy design and the proposed
restricted HS-SCCH.
Table 4.6.2-1: Comparison of payload between the restricted HS-SCCH and legacy
HS-SCCH.

* * *
**\- Channelization-code-set (CCS) information (0 bits)**. As described in
Section 4.6.1.2, the restricted HS-SCCH does not require explicit signalling
of channelization code information.
**\- Modulation scheme information (0 bits)**. Signalling of modulation is not
required since 16-QAM is not allowed.
**\- Transport block size (TBS) information (2 bits).** As described in
Section 4.6.1.2, the HS-SCCH needs to identify one of four pre-defined block
sizes for a VoIP flow, which requires 2 bits. The HS-SCCH transmits a 2-bit
index into the pre-configured set of at most four transport block sizes that
is configured by higher layers.
**\- HARQ process information (0 bits).** Signalling of HARQ process
information is not required because of synchronous HARQ.
**\- Redundancy and constellation version (0 bits).** The RV parameters are
derived from the HARQ transmission number, and are therefore not required to
be signalled.
**\- New data indicator (0 bits).** Since the restricted HS-SCCH is
transmitted only for new transmissions, the new data indicator is not
required.
**\- UE identity (16 bits).** In order to signal the identity of the intended
recipient UE, the restricted HS-SCCH will continue to use the 16-bit H-RNTI as
the UE identity.
Based on the reduction in payload alone, and assuming that coding gain remains
unchanged, the relative gain in HS-SCCH performance can be calculated as
$\text{10}\text{log}_{\text{10}}(\frac{\text{37}}{\text{18}}) =
3\text{.}\text{13}$dB. The restricted HS-SCCH also benefits from an additional
coding gain, since it operates at a lower code rate than the existing HS-SCCH,
which uses puncturing. Furthermore, in addition to the gains due to payload
reduction and more coding, the restricted HS-SCCH yields a gain in fade
margins because of joint encoding of the entire payload and transmission over
three slots using an interleaver.
### 4.6.3 Benefits of the concept
\- The new HS-SCCH specification requires only few changes with respect to the
current standards specification.
\- The required power for transmitting HS-SCCH is significantly reduced.
\- Blind detection techniques for the UE are avoided.
\- Soft buffer corruption in the UE is avoided as the presence of HS-SCCH is
identical with the new data indication.
### 4.6.4 Open issues of the concept
#### 4.6.4.1 Unexpected and Erroneous Events
In this section, we discuss some unexpected error events that may occur when
the restricted HS-SCCH is used. It is shown that some of the error events can
be mitigated by following some simple rules at the transmitter, that the error
events that cannot be eliminated in this manner have a very small probability
of occurrence, and that each error event leads to a possible loss of no more
than one MAC-hs PDU.
##### 4.6.4.1.1 ACK/NACK not received in response to a new transmission
Suppose that in a TTI in which a UE is not expecting a HARQ retransmission,
the Node-B transmits a new HARQ transmission to the UE along with the
corresponding restricted HS-SCCH, but the UE misses detection of the HS-SCCH.
Without further corrective action the packet will be lost in this case, since
HS-SCCH is not transmitted with the retransmissions, and therefore the UE will
never be able to receive any of the HARQ transmissions for this packet.
This error event can be resolved by requiring that whenever the Node-B does
not detect an ACK/NACK corresponding to a new transmission, it will transmit
the new transmission again, along with the HS-SCCH.
##### 4.6.4.1.2 Buffer corruption
Consider the case when the UE is expecting a retransmission of a packet in a
specific TTI, but the Node-B decides to transmit a fresh transmission of a new
packet to the UE in that TTI. This may happen if the Node-B decides to pre-
empt the retransmission with a fresh transmission, or if the Node-B had
incorrectly detected an ACK when a NACK was transmitted. Suppose further that
the UE misses HS-SCCH detection for this new transmission. In this case the UE
will assume that it has received a retransmission of the old packet, and will
HARQ-combine the received signal with the contents of the IR buffer for the
old packet. This will lead to buffer corruption for the new packet, with the
likely result that the new packet is lost. The effect of the error event is
restricted to just one packet, however, since the UE will be able to receive
the next new transmission by decoding the corresponding HS-SCCH.
Probability of the above error event is reduced by the use of a limit on the
maximum number of HARQ transmissions, since it reduces the probability of the
Node-B terminating HARQ of a packet without the UE's knowledge. In fact, if
the MAC-hs scheduler ensures that a retransmission is never pre-empted before
exhausting the maximum number of transmissions, then the only way in which
buffer corruption could occur is due to a NACK -> ACK detection error followed
by mis-detection of the HS-SCCH for the new transmission. Assuming independent
errors on the HS-DPCCH and HS-SCCH, the probability of this event is
P[NACK->ACK]*P[HS-SCCH misdetection], which is smaller than 0.01%. Since this
probability is much smaller than the target error rate for VoIP kind of
applications, we can conclude that buffer corruption due to the restricted HS-
SCCH is not a significant problem.
##### 4.6.4.1.3 HS-SCCH misdetection followed by ACK false alarm
This is a scenario in which the restricted HS-SCCH would perform better than
the legacy HS-SCCH. Consider the case when HS-SCCH detection fails for a
transmission, and the UE therefore does not send ACK/NACK in response, but the
Node-B incorrectly detects an ACK (ACK false alarm). This causes the loss of
one packet. The probability of this error event in the case of new
transmissions is exactly the same for both legacy and restricted HS-SCCHs. The
restricted HS-SCCH has the added advantage over the legacy channel in that,
since the restricted HS-SCCH is not transmitted during retransmissions, this
error event can never occur during retransmissions. The probability of this
error event during a retransmission is the same as in the case of a new
transmission when the legacy HS-SCCH is used. The probability that a packet is
lost due to this error event can be computed as P[HS-SCCH
misdetection]*P[DTX->ACK], which is in the order of 0.01%. The effect of such
an error is localized to only one packet, since the next fresh transmission
will be received once the corresponding HS-SCCH is correctly decoded.
##### 4.6.4.1.4 HS-SCCH misdetection followed by NACK false alarm
This is the same scenario as in Section 4.6.4.1.3 except that DTX is
interpreted as NACK on the HS-DPCCH. This will likely not lead to a packet
loss in the case of the legacy HS-SCCH since it would just lead to another
retransmission which will be received by the UE. However, with the restricted
HS-SCCH, this packet will be lost since the UE will not receive any
retransmissions of this packet. This is also a rare event, with a probability
P[HS-SCCH misdetection]*P[DTX ->NACK] ≈ 0.01% that a packet is lost in this
manner. The effect of this error event is also localized to just one packet.
## 4.7 HS-SCCH-less operation
### 4.7.1 Description of the Concept
HS-SCCH adds a significant overhead to each HS-DSCH transmission. Although
this overhead is relatively small for transmission of large packets of data,
such as in the presence of full-buffer type of traffic, it is considerable for
IMS real-time services such as VoIP.
This concept alleviates this overhead by allowing for each UE 2 HS-DSCH
subframe formats to be transmitted without HS-SCCH. The new subframe format is
the same as the current HS-DSCH subframe format, except that:
\- The HS-SCCH is not transmitted.
\- Only pre-defined 2 TB sizes are allowed. (semi-static, configurable per UE)
\- Only QPSK is allowed.
\- Only one pre-defined HS-PDSCH code can be used per UE. (semi-static,
configured per UE)
\- Each UE is told via signalling to only listen to one particular OVSF code
for transmissions using the new subframe formats. The UE must therefore
monitor that code for a transmission in addition to monitoring the HS-SCCH as
in Release 5/6.
\- HARQ is limited to:
\- 2 retransmissions.
\- Synchronous IR.
\- The redundancy version is pre-defined. (static, non configurable)
\- The HS-PDSCH CRC is 24-bits long and is UE specific.
\- Its generation follows the same procedure as the CRC currently on the HS-
SCCH and therefore is covered by the 16-bit UE MAC ID.
\- The UE does not transmit negative acknowledgements (NAK)
\- The UE attempts reception of the regular HS-SCCH in parallel to the blind
detection over the HS-PDSCH to detect scheduling with the old and with the new
slot format.
### 4.7.2 Analysis of the concept
#### 4.7.2.1 Transmission waveform and timing
Figure 4.7.2.1-1 depicts transmissions only using the existing subframe
format. In contrast, Figure 4.7.2.1-2 depicts a transmission with a new
subframe format. The new format disables transmission of the HS-SCCH, as well
as negative acknowledgements.
Figure 4.7.2.1-1: Transmission waveform and timing using the existing HS-DSCH
subframe format
Figure 4.7.2.1-2: Transmission waveform and timing using the proposed HS-DSCH
subframe format
Note how new and old subframe formats can be intermixed. Note also that in
this depiction of the timing the ACK processing time is unchanged for the new
formats.
To implicitly convey the control information in the HS-SCCH, the following
list goes over the HS-SCCH fields and their mapping to the HS-SCCH less
operation:
\- Modulation used (1 bit):
\- Always QPSK.
\- OVSF codes used (7 bits):
\- One pre-defined (semi-static) code. (P=1)
\- Transport Format Resource Indicator (6 bits):
\- Only 2 possible values. Blindly determined by the UE.
\- HARQ process number (3 bits):
\- Not needed because synchronous IR is used.
\- Redundancy version (3 bits):
\- Pre-defined (static) redundancy versions for each transmission.
\- New data indicator (1 bit):
\- Not needed because synchronous IR with pre-defined redundancy versions is
used.
\- CRC / User identity (16 bits):
\- Not needed because carried over HS-PDSCH transmission.
#### 4.7.2.2 UE complexity discussion
When an HS-SCCH-less transmission occurs the UE does not know the payload
size, or the HARQ information for combining. The UE must therefore blindly
decode for both of the possible payload sizes. Furthermore, since synchronous
IR with 3 transmissions is used, the UE must decode for all 3 possibilities:
current TTI is a 1^st^ transmission, current TTI is a 2^nd^ transmission and
current TTI is a 3^rd^ transmission. The UE must therefore perform a total of
2*3 = 6 blind decodes.
The first 3 blind decodes are based on the assumption that a somewhat small
payload was transmitted, of at most N1 bits. This would correspond, for
example, to an AMR-NB full-rate frame. The next 3 blind decodes are based on
the assumption that a very small payload was transmitted, of at most N2 bits.
Both N1 and N2 are semi-static values.
In order to minimize complexity we set
\- N1 = 353 bits; this is sufficient to carry a 12.2 kbit/s AMR-NB or 12.6
kbit/s AMR-WB speech frame.
\- N2 = 161 bits; this is sufficient to carry an AMR-NB or AMR-WB SID frame.
To control complexity of the de-interleaving and rate-matching process we
restrict the redundancy versions of successive transmissions to be X~rv~ = (0,
0, 0). In other words energy combining ("Chase" combining) is used. There is
virtually no performance loss in fixing the redundancy versions in such a
manner, since the code-rate of these small payloads is already close or at the
lowest code-rate achievable by our code (R=1/3).
With these assumptions in hand, the main complexity resides in the ability to
performing the 6 decodes. The first 3 decodes are for a payload of at most N1
= 353 bits. The 3 next decodes are for a payload of at most N2= 161. The total
number of bits that need to be decoded is therefore at most 3*353 + 3*161 =
1.542 bits.
Consider that the lowest capability UE (Categories 11 and 12) must be able to
Turbo decode 3.630 bits in that same amount of time (and process up to 14.000
soft channel bits). Furthermore the UEs typically deployed nowadays can decode
7.298 bits.
Noting that there is no other Turbo decoding on the HS-DSCH required when HS-
SCCH-less operation occurs, we conclude that the proposed HS-SCCH-less
operation can be accommodated within the existing Release 5 UE complexity.
Note that parallel decoding of the HS-SCCH within a subframe happens in the
same way as in regular Rel-5 operation.
#### 4.7.2.3 CRC discussion
If a 16-bit CRC was to be used for HS-PDSCH transmissions for the HS-SCCH-less
formats, instead of the traditional 24-bit CRC, the false alarm rate would be
2^-16^.
At each TTI the UE decodes 6 possible ways; if any of these decodes
incorrectly triggers the CRC to check, a packet will be incorrectly forwarded
to the upper-layers.
With 6 decodes per TTI and a false alarm rate of 2^-16^, we get that the mean
time between false alarms will be:
With a 24-bit CRC we get a false alarm rate of
From the above false alarm computations for both CRC lengths, retaining the
24-bit CRC for HS-PDSCH is, therefore, recommended. Since the UE MAC ID is 16
bits, just part of the HS-PDSCH CRC will be covered by the UE MAC ID.

##### 4.7.2.4.2 Simulation results
The system integrates modeling of simultaneously using new formats with
synchronous IR and 3 transmissions as well as old formats with asynchronous IR
and 4 transmissions. The simulations also explicitly track OVSF code usage for
the HS-PDSCH, model code collision and OVSF space segmentation.
The results highlight the relationship between real-time services load and
best-effort (BE) throughput by characterizing the increase in BE throughput
due to the introduction of the new subframe format for the real-time services.
The real-time service modeled in these simulations is VoIP IMS using the AMR
12.2 kbit/s vocoder. The simulations consider 5 BE users per cell with the
following assigned geometries {0, 1.5, 2.5, 3, 5dB}. Detailed simulation
assumptions are explained in section 4.7.2.4.1.
Figure 4.7.2.4.2-1, Figure 4.7.2.4.2-2 and Figure 4.7.2.4.2-3 plot the
variation of total best-effort throughput with increasing number of VoIP users
for systems without and with the introduction of the new subframe format.
Results exhibit a significant increase in BE throughput for the range of
50-100 VoIP users. As observed, the relative performance gains in terms of BE
throughput increases as the number of VoIP users (allowed to use to the new
subframe format) in the system increase. As the system approaches the VoIP
user capacity, the BE throughput goes to 0. This is because the BE users
utilize only the residual throughput and are scheduled after the VoIP users.

As an example, assume the system of Figure 4.7.2.4.2-2 with a load of 50 VoIP
users (or an equivalent of some other multimedia users such as gaming or
video-telephony). The introduction of the HS-SCCH-less operation offers the
following possible benefits:
\- Increase the number of VoIP users from 50 to 70 users, without impacting
the best-effort throughput.
\- Maintain 50 VoIP users, and the best-effort throughput will be increased
2.7 times.
\- Flexibly to operate between the previous two points of operation.
### 4.7.3 Benefits of the concept
The new subframe format propose is backward compatible, does not introduce any
significant waveform changes, and provides the following capacity benefits:
\- Significant increase in DL capacity for real-time services.
\- Significant increase in available best-effort throughput on the DL for a
given load of real-time services.
Although simulations presented were limited to IMS VoIP with AMR 12.2 kbit/s,
it is expected that the benefit extends to other types of real-time services
such as gaming and video-over-IP.
### 4.7.4 Open issues of the concept
## 4.8 Reduced complexity HS-SCCH-less operation
### 4.8.1 Description of the concept
The relative overhead consumed by HS-SCCH becomes significant when it is used
to transport small packets, such as those generated in the transport of low-
latency low data-rate traffic like VoIP and gaming over HSDPA.
The full HS-SCCH-less operation, as described in TR 25.903 Section 4.7,
reduces this overhead by removing the HS-SCCH completely for two of the HS-
DSCH subframe formats (i.e. TB size and MCS). It relies on synchronous IR and
blind combining & decoding to eliminate the need for the HS-SCCH.
This concept, the reduced complexity HS-SCCH-less operation, lessens the HS-
SCCH overhead by allowing 4 of the HS-DSCH subframe formats to be transmitted
without HS-SCCH with the first HARQ transmission. On the other hand, HARQ
retransmissions are accompanied by the HS-SCCH.
More specifically, when the UE is set up in reduced complexity HS-SCCH-less
operation, the traffic is delivered to the UE as follows.
\- The HS-SCCH is not transmitted with first HARQ transmissions.
\- The modulation used is restricted to QPSK.
\- Only 4 pre-defined TB formats for MAC-hs PDUs are allowed.
\- These 4 formats are chosen semi-statically, and maybe independently
configured per UE.
\- The HS-PDSCH CRC is 24-bits long and is UE specific.
\- Its generation follows the same procedure as the CRC currently on the HS-
SCCH, and therefore is covered by the 16-bit UE MAC ID.
\- At most two contiguous pre-defined HS-PDSCH OVSF codes are assigned per UE.
(semi-static, configured per UE, multiple UEs can share the codes)
\- Each UE is told via RRC signalling to listen to one particular HS-PDSCH
OVSF code for transmissions of the chosen 4 TB formats. The UE therefore
monitors that code and the neighboring code for a transmission by blind
decoding of the 4 chosen formats.
\- The UE does not transmit negative acknowledgements (NACK) in the first
transmission when decoding the chosen formats. It transmits ACK or NACKs for
the retransmissions.
\- HARQ is limited to:
\- 2 retransmissions.
\- The redundancy version is pre-defined. (static, non configurable)
\- The HARQ retransmissions are accompanied by an HS-SCCH, which is sent with
the same channel coding and decoding as the Release 5/6 HS-SCCH. Some of the
bits of the HS-SCCH are reinterpreted in order to signal the UE the following
information.
\- That the HS-SCCH is for the Reduced Complexity HS-SCCH operation
\- Whether the retransmission is the first retransmission or the second
retransmission
\- The channelization code and the transport block size used by the HARQ
process
\- The HARQ combining information -- in the form of an offset from the current
TTI indicating where the previous transmission was sent
\- The detailed fields in the interpretation of the HS-SCCH are described in
Section 4.X.2
\- In addition, just as in Release 5/6 operation, the UE continues to attempt
reception of the regular HS-SCCH and corresponding HS-PDSCH codes if any and
carries out HARQ the regular way.
#### 4.8.1.1 HS-SCCH for retransmissions with the reduced complexity HS-SCCH-
less operation
As described in Section 4.8.1, the HS-SCCH is not included with the first HARQ
transmission, but is included with the HARQ retransmissions. The coding of the
HS-SCCH is unchanged -- only the meaning of the bits is modified under this
operation.
Figure 4.8.1.1-1: Structure of the HS-SCCH for legacy transmissions
Figure 4.8.1.1-1 depicts the existing HS-SCCH format. Part 2 contains the
information necessary for HARQ combining.
Figure 4.8.1.1-2: Structure of the HS-SCCH for retransmissions using the
reduced complexity HS-SCCH-less operation
Figure 4.8.1.1-2 depicts the structure of the HS-SCCH used for retransmissions
in the reduced complexity HS-SCCH-less operation. The Format ID '111111'
corresponds to a TB size that was never used in practice for legacy
transmissions because it has a code-rate of R=0.99. The combination of Format
ID = '111111' and CCS with P=1 or P=2 is used to indicate to the UE that this
is a reduced complexity HS-SCCH-less retransmission.
Referring again to Figure 4.8.1.1-2, the interpretation of CCS and Modulation
index of Part 1 is the same as for the legacy HS-SCCH, except that the P value
signalled through the CCS must be consistent with the HS-SCCH-less TB format
that was pre-configured through RRC signalling (see Section 4.X.1).
Furthermore, since only QPSK is allowed for HS-SCCH-less operation the
Modulation bit will always be set to '0'.
The content of Part 2 is re-defined as follows:
\- Format ID: 6 bits indicate in combination with CCS (P=1 or 2) that this is
an HS-SCCH-less retransmission.
\- TB Format: 2 bits indicate which pre-configured TB size is being
transmitted.
\- reTx ID: 1 bit indicates whether this a 2^nd^ transmission ('0') or a 3^rd^
transmission ('1').
\- Previous Transmission Pointer: 3 bits indicates the offset from the current
TTI, in number of TTIs the time of the previous transmission: {6 TTIs, 7 TTIs,
8 TTIs, ...}
\- UE-Specific CRC: unchanged.
The redundancy version is pre-defined to follow the following sequence for the
3 HARQ transmissions: {s=1 r=0, s=0 r=1, s=1 r=2}. The reTx ID field therefore
indicates which redundancy version is being transmitted.
The NDI bit is not needed since HARQ transmissions are limited to 3 and the
reTx ID avoids the ambiguity that existed in legacy transmissions.
### 4.8.2 Analysis of the concept
#### **4.8.2.1** Timing and operation
The timing of the reduced complexity HS-SCCH-less operation is similar to the
timing in Release 5/6 HSDPA operation. It is depicted in Figure 4.8.2.1-1.
Figure 4.8.2.1-1: Illustration of the reduced complexity HS-SCCH-less
operation
The first and second retransmissions can be asynchronous with respect to the
first transmission, and with respect to each other. The accompanying HS-SCCH
follows the same timing relationship with the HS-PDSCH transmission as legacy
transmissions do; namely the HS-SCCH starts and ends one slot before the HS-
PDSCH transmission boundaries.
If the UE is able to decode the first transmission successfully, it sends an
ACK to the Node B over the HS-DPCCH. If it is not able to decode the first
transmission, it buffers the data sent on the TTI. The retransmissions do not
require any blind combining or decoding operation as the HS-SCCH accompanying
the retransmissions carry the information needed. The inclusion of systematic
bits in the HS-SCCH of third retransmission provides robustness against HS-
SCCH losses.
#### **4.8.2.2** UE Complexity discussion
The operation requires the UE to perform blind decoding every TTI of the
transport format from 4 possibilities. but requires no blind combining. These
4 transport formats will typically carry small payloads (less than 1,000
bits).
#### 4.8.2.3 Simulation Results
Figure 4.8.2.3-1 and Figure 4.8.2.3-2 depict the VoIP capacity for channel
models PB3 and VA30. The performance of the legacy operation (Release 6) is
compared to that of
\- The original HS-SCCH-less proposal from TR 25.903, Section 4.7-- "Original
HS-SCCH-less: 2 TB sizes"
\- The original HS-SCCH-less proposal augmented with 4 TB size -- "Original
HS-SCCH-less: 4 TB sizes"
\- The proposed reduced complexity HS-SCCH-less proposal -- "Reduced
complexity HS-SCCH-less: 4 TB sizes"
Figure 4.8.2.3-3 and Figure 4.8.2.3-4 depict the Best Effort throughput of 5
fixed Best Effort users when the number of VoIP users is kept at medium load.
It shows that a significant advantage in Best Effort throughput can be
obtained because of the overhead reduction and freeing up of HS-SCCH codes for
Best Effort traffic.
These results demonstrate that the reduced complexity HS-SCCH-less proposal
captures the gains of the original HS-SCCH-less proposal, while maintaining a
significantly lower complexity both at the UE as well as the Node B through
increased flexibility.
The reduced complexity HS-SCCH-less operation achieves a significant reduction
in the HS-SCCH overhead because the HS-SCCH overhead is only incurred during
retransmissions. In these two scenarios the fraction of transmissions that
were retransmissions was 15%.

### 4.8.3 Benefits of the concept
The performance benefits of the reduced complexity HS-SCCH-less operation are
evident from the simulations results.
\- Significant increase in the VoIP capacity compared to the Release 5/6 HSDPA
operation obtained due to reduced overhead.
\- HS-SCCH channels are freed up to be used for other services.
\- At medium VoIP user loads, the first two benefits translate into a large
gain in the throughput available to co-existing Best Effort user's traffic.
\- Delay sensitive traffic is better supported as more users can be code
multiplexed in a single TTI without the costly overhead of the HS-SCCH. Figure
4.8.2.3-5 shows that typically more users are multiplexed per TTI in the new
operation.
**Backward Compatibility and flexibility benefit** s:
\- Is backward compatible and integrated with the existing HS-DSCH operation.
\- The scheduler may dynamically choose at each TTI whether to schedule a HS-
SCCH-less or a legacy transmission.
\- Does not impose synchronous operation on retransmissions.
\- Does not change the coding and transmission of the HS-SCCH.
\- Does not require blind combining by the UE.

# 5 Technical solution
This section describes which technical concepts of section 4 are selected to
solve the problems in the 3GPP standard described by the work item "Continuous
Connectivity for Packet Data Users" defined in [1].
## 5.1 Overview of the selected solution
\"Continuous connectivity for packet data users\" as building block under the
REL-7 feature \"RAN improvements\" was decided by RAN1 #46 to consist of the
following UL & DL improvements:
\- A **new UL DPCCH slot format** configurable by L3 in a semi-static way
(based on section 4.1).
**\- UL DPCCH gating/discontinuous transmission** (DTX) in 2 cycles (based on
section 4.2) connected with a **F-DPCH gating in DL** and an implicit **CQI
reporting reduction** in UL (see section 4.4)
\- In DL: **Discontinuous reception** (DRX) at the UE (based on section 4.5).
\- In DL: A so called **HS-SCCH-less operation** which includes an HS-SCCH
less initial transmission and modified HS-SCCH for retransmission(s) (based on
section 4.8).
Note 1: The referenced subsections of section 4 indicate the ideas that were
taken into account but they do not necessarily describe the concepts exactly
as they were introduced in the final solution as described in section 5.
Note 2: The building block \"Continuous connectivity for packet data users\"
under the REL-7 feature \"RAN improvements\" is in the following abbreviated
as \"CPC solution\" (CPC: continuously packet connected or continuous packet
connectivity).
The following summary provides an overview about the CPC solution as
introduced in the REL-7 specifications (for more detailed description please
refer to the corresponding CRs).
The CPC solution:
\- is mandatory to be implemented in all FDD UEs of REL-7 and above supporting
HSDPA/E-DCH (even though the actual shutting off of the UE receiver remains an
UE implementation issue);
\- is configurable on a per UE basis by the SRNC i.e. the SRNC can enable the
CPC solution or parts of it for each UE individually provided the
corresponding Node B supports it;
\- can only be applied to FDD UEs in CELL_DCH state provided that F-DPCH but
no DCH in UL and DL is configured for this UE (i.e. SRBs have to be mapped to
HS-DSCH)
\- is divided into three parts:
1) new UL DPCCH slot format
2) DTX/DRX at UE (linked with DTX of F-DPCH at Node B)
3) HS-SCCH less-operation
\- These 3 parts could in theory be configured by the RNC independently from
each other as well as in combination. In the specifications one limitation was
introduced: 1. can only be applied in connection with 2.
\- allows to reduce UL (esp. UL DPCCH, CQI) and DL (esp. HS-SCCH, F-DPCH)
control signalling for temporarily inactive packet data users that can get
active again in a short time period (\Inactivity_Threshold_for_UE_DTX_cycle_2 TTIs) it is also possible to use a
long preamble (configurable by the parameter UE_DTX_long_preamble_length to 2
or 4 or 15 slots).
As UL DTX reduces UL DPCCH transmissions which are also used for determining
power control commands on F-DPCH in DL, the Node B is not required to transmit
F-DPCH in those gaps of UL DPCCH transmission (\"DL F-DPCH gating\"). So the
UE only receives the TPC commands on F-DPCH corresponding to actually
transmitted UL DPCCH slots.
The UL compressed mode (used for measurements since R99) and the UL DPCCH
transmission patterns are applied as follows:
\- As long as UL DTX is not applied or if UL DTX is used but E-DCH data
transmission is ongoing compressed mode is applied as in REL-6 and takes
priority over UL DPCCH pattern settings.
\- In case UL DTX is applied and no ED-DCH data needs to be send 2 cases can
be distinguished:
\- If a (preamble + UL DPCCH burst + postamble) of the UL DPCCH transmission
pattern overlaps partly or fully with a compressed mode gap then the UL DPCCH
in this radio frame will be transmitted as in a REL-6 compressed mode frame,
i.e. in the whole frame except the compressed mode gap.
\- If a (preamble + UL DPCCH burst + postamble) of the UL DPCCH transmission
pattern does not overlap with the compressed mode gap in a compressed radio
frame then the UL DPCCH transmission related to compressed mode will not be
carried out in this radio frame. So in this radio frame the UL DPCCH will
follow the UL DPCCH transmission pattern.
When the discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission is enabled a count down timer
(going from a configurable value CQI_DTX_TIMER down to 0 in subframes)
controls when **CQI reports** on HS-DPCCH are sent:
\- either CQI reports shall be sent on HS-DPCCH according to REL-6 CQI
feedback cycle\ (this case is called \"CQI_DTX_Priority=1\" and applies before
timer expires at 0),
\- or CQI reports on HS-DPCCH have to fall into UL DPCCH bursts of the
currently active discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission pattern in order to
get transmitted (this case is called \"CQI_DTX_Priority=0\" and applies after
the timer has expired at 0).
The timer is reset to CQI_DTX_TIMER every time an HS-SCCH indicating a HS-DSCH
transmission (no HS-SCCH order) was received with consistent control
information or HS-PDSCH was received correctly.
Note: When UL DTX is enabled by higher layers for a specific UE then also its
CQI feedback pattern is offset by UE_DTX_DRX Offset (in subframes) in the same
way as the UL DPCCH transmission patterns. The CQI feedback cycle remains
unchanged compared to the case where no UL DTX is applied.
In addition to UL DTX there is an option **UL DRX** /DRX at the Node B which
allows the Node B to safe resources (e.g. for processing) by restricting on
MAC level the starting points of new UL data transmissions (after inactivity)
of a UE:
If no E-DCH transmission has been performed for the time
MAC_Inactivity_Threshold (in TTIs) the E-TFC selection in the UE will be
restricted to cycles given by MAC_DTX_Cycle. This restriction of starting
points of UL EDCH transmissions is time offset by the same UE_DTX_DRX_Offset
(in subframes) as already known from UL DTX in order to allow that the UL EDCH
transmissions fall together with UL DPCCH bursts.
**DL DRX** allows the UE to predict when it has to listen to DL transmissions
from the Node B in order to save UE power and increase its battery life time.
This mechanism is also based on standardized rules and uses parameters
configured by the RNC. Note: Even when configured the UE is not forced to
receive discontinuously.
For Inactivity_Threshold_for_UE_DRX_cycle subframes after an HS-SCCH reception
or after the first slot of an HS-PDSCH reception the UE has to monitor HS-SCCH
of its HS-SCCH set and HS-PDSCH (if HS-SCCH less mode is applied in parallel)
continuously.
In addition the parameter **UE_DRX_cycle** (in subframes) determines an \"HS-
SCCH reception pattern\": The UE must listen to one HS-SCCH sub-frame (and the
corresponding HS-PDSCH if HS-SCCH received successfully or if HS-SCCH less
mode is applied in parallel) every UE_DRX_cycle sub-frames. The HS-SCCH
reception pattern can be offset for different UEs by a UE dependent
UE_DTX_DRX_Offset (same parameter as for UL DTX).\ Note: The Node B scheduler
has to take into account the times at which a UE can receive HS-SCCH/HS-PDSCH.
In addition the UE has to listen to
\- F-DPCH in slots corresponding to transmitted UL DPCCH slots;
\- DL E-HICH corresponding to an UL E-DCH;
\- if **UE_DRX_Grant_Monitoring** = TRUE:\ E-AGCH from serving cell and E-RGCH
transmissions from cells in the serving E-DCH radio link set when they overlap
with the start of an HS-SCCH reception pattern;
\- DL E-AGCH from serving cell and DL E-RGCH(s) from all the cells in the
E-DCH active set
\- if overlapping with E-HICH (corresponding to a scheduled E-DCH
transmission);
\- if sent within Inactivity_Threshold_for_UE_Grant_Monitoring subframes after
an E-DCH scheduled transmission;
\- if at least one MAC-d flow is configured with a scheduled transmission and
TEBS > 0 (TEBS: Total E-DCH Buffer Status).
The Node B has a fast L1 mechanism to force the UE back to continuous UL DPCCH
transmissions and continuous DL receptions as in REL-6: **HS-SCCH orders**.
\- Node B can deactivate (or reactivate) UL DTX or DL DRX operation for a
specific UE by a L1 command sent on an HS-SCCH of type 2 without an associated
HS-PDSCH.
\- HS-SCCH orders (\'111101\') can be distinguished from HS-SCCH less
operation (\'111110\') by its special information type bit combination in HS-
SCCH part 2. Note: HS-SCCH orders use already a specific (in REL-5/REL-6 not
used) channelization code set bit sequence \"1110000\" on HS-SCCH part 1.
\- These HS-SCCH orders are used in exceptional cases (e.g. danger of losing a
connection to a UE).\ Normally the UE will stay in the configured UL DTX/DL
DRX mode until it is reconfigured and this allows the benefits of continuous
operation as in REL-6 as well as discontinuous operation by autonomously
applied standardized rules, i.e. without further signalling.\ E.g.
transmission gaps between packets of a VoIP call as well as speech pauses in
between can all be handled as well as a continuous file transfer without a
reconfiguration.
\- HS-SCCH orders are carried out by the UE a specific time intervall after
receiving an HS-SCCH order:
\- for UL DTX: at earliest E-DCH TTI boundary coinciding with or following the
beginning of the HS-DPCCH subframe containing the HARQ-ACK corresponding to
the order,
\- for DL DRX: 12 slots after the ending of the HS-SCCH subframe delivering
the order.
\- If received correctly by the UE an ACK is sent in the corresponding HS-
DPCCH ACK field.
### 5.1.3 HS-SCCH less operation
This part of the CPC solution is introducing a new HS-SCCH type 2 format
(compared to the HS-SCCH type 1 as in REL-6) as well as a new CRC attachment
method 2 for HS-DSCH and it is reducing the DL HS-SCCH overhead for lower data
rate services that can be operated with just 4 predefined transport block
formats for MAC-hs PDUs (special focus: VoIP users).
If HS-SCCH less operation is combined with
\- either UL_DTX
\- or UL_DTX & DL_DRX
further restrictions regarding the timing of DL HS-SCCH & HS-PDSCH & F-DPCH as
well as UL DPCCH, HS-DPCCH have to be taken into account by the scheduler in
the Node B as well as by the UE.
The main characteristics of HS-SCCH less operation are:
\- \'HS-SCCH less mode\' is configured per UE (not per HS-SCCH) by the SRNC by
prescribing 1 or 2 HS-PDSCH channelization codes and corresponding up to 4
MAC-hs transport block sizes that have to be used if HS-SCCH type 2 is used.\
These settings are semi-static, i.e. they can be reconfigured.\ Note: \'HS-
SCCH less mode\' configured for a UE allows the usage of HS-SCCH less
operation, i.e. HS-SCCH type 2/CRC attachment method 2 for this UE. It does
not mandate it. This means the UE also continues to attempt reception of the
legacy HS-SCCH type 1.
\- As in REL-6 the UE has to monitor up to 4 HS-SCCHs but whether HS-SCCHs of
type 1 (as in REL-6) or type 2 (as for HS-SCCH less operation) are used is up
to the Node B and is autonomously detected by the UE. The only limitation is
that if the first transmission of a transport block is using a HS-SCCH type x
(x: either 1 or 2) also all retransmissions of this transport block have to
use the same HS-SCCH type x.
\- Operating with HS-SCCH type 2 is characterized by
\- An initial HS-PDSCH transmission has no associated HS-SCCH. The UE:
\- knows the channelization code of the HS-PDSCH via RRC from the SRNC
(modulation of HS-PDSCH is fixed to QPSK),
\- has to blindly decode on the up to 2 HS-PDSCH codes with 4 possible
transport formats (configured by the SRNC),
\- detects whether HS-PDSCH is dedicated to this UE (UE-Id) from an introduced
new 24bit CRC of HS-PDSCH (CRC attachment method 2).
\- successful detection is answered by an ACK from the UE (in unsuccessful
case no NACK is sent).
\- The retransmission (max. 2 are possible) has an associated HS-SCCH of type
2 which informs the UE about:
\- HS-PDSCH channelization code (up to max. 2) and modulation (QPSK)
\- whether associated HS-PDSCH is dedicated to this UE (UE identity)
\- transport block size (1 out of the configured 4) so no blind decoding
\- whether this is the first or second retransmission
\- a pointer to the previous HS-PDSCH transmission of the same transport block
(pointing 6..13 subframes before the start of this HS-PDSCH transmission);\
the UE uses a so called 13 TTI long \"cyclic soft buffer\" to store and
combine up to 3 HS-PDSCH transmissions
\- The UE answers on HS-DPCCH with ACK or NACK in the same way as for HS-SCCH
type 1.
\- Apart from the information above same timing of HS-SCCH, HS-PDSCH, HS-DPCCH
as in REL-6.

## 5.5 Impact on RAN4 specifications
\
TS 25.101 REL-7:
\- out of synchronisation handling has to take into account discontinuous UL
DPCCH transmission in that sense that not just F-DPCH of 160ms period is
considered but 240 slots in which F-DPCH is known to be present during UL DTX
operation
\- areas to be further checked: impact of discontinuous UL DPCCH transmission
on UL power control, need for additional DL power control requirement,
transmit off power, transmit on/off time mask, blind demodulation requirement
for HS-DSCH in case of HS-SCCH less operation, additional demodulation of new
HS-SCCH format type 2, need for receiver performance requirements in case of
DL DRX, need for testing of DTX/DRX cycles and timers.
TS 25.133 REL-7:
\- normalised remaining power margin available for E-TFC selection (section
6.4) has to take into account discontinuous UL DPCCH transmission
\- UE transmit power measurement (section 9.1.6) has to take into account
discontinuous UL DPCCH transmission.
\- UE transmission power headroom measurement (section 9.1.13) has to take
into account discontinuous UL DPCCH transmission.
\- ffs: extension of 200ms CPICH measurement period and intra-frequency CPICH
measurement requirement at the UE in case of DL DRX.
