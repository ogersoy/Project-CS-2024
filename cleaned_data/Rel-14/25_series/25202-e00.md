# 4 Background and introduction
The 7.68Mcps TDD option is an evolution of the 3.84Mcps TDD option to a higher
chip rate. There exists a great degree of commonality between the 3.84Mcps TDD
option and the 7.68Mcps TDD option. Nevertheless, there are many aspects of
the 7.68Mcps TDD option that require separate specification to the 3.84Mcps
TDD option. The following aspects are specified at a high level in this
document:
\- Physical layer structure;
\- Physical layer procedures;
\- UE capabilities;
\- Layer 2/3 protocol aspects;
\- Iub / Iur aspects;
\- Radio aspects;
# 5 Requirements
\- The 7.68Mcps TDD option shall provide significant enhancements in terms of
user experience (throughput and delay) and/or capacity (at least to the extent
shown in [1]).
\- Full mobility shall be supported, i.e., mobility should be supported for
high-speed UE cases also, but optimisation should be for low-speed to medium-
speed scenarios.
\- It is highly desirable for the 7.68Mcps TDD option to maintain commonality
with the 3.84Mcps TDD option. New features shall therefore provide significant
incremental gain for an acceptable complexity.
\- The UE and network complexity shall be minimised for a given level of
system performance.
\- The impact on current releases in terms of both protocol and hardware
perspectives shall be taken into account.
# 6 Physical layer structure
## 6.0 Services offered to higher layers
The 7.68Mcps TDD option supports an identical set of transport channels and
indicators to the 3.84Mcps TDD option.
## 6.1 Frame structure
The 7.68Mcps TDD option frame is of length 10ms and consists of 15 timeslots
of duration 5120 *  _T~c~_ , where _T~c~_ is the chip duration (_T~c~_ = 1 /
7.68 * 10^6^ = 130.2ns). Any timeslot in the frame can be either uplink or
downlink. At least one timeslot in the frame is assigned to the uplink and at
least one timeslot in the frame is assigned to the downlink. The frame
structure is shown in Figure 6.1.1.
Figure 6.1.1: The 7.68Mcps TDD option frame structure
## 6.2 Burst structure
The 7.68Mcps burst consists of two data field portions, a midamble portion
containing a training sequence and a guard period as shown in Figure 6.2.1.
Several bursts can be transmitted at the same time where each burst uses a
different OVSF channelisation code, but the same scrambling code.
Figure 6.2.1: 7.68Mcps TDD option burst structure
Three burst types are specified: burst types 1, 2 and 3. The maximum number of
training sequences supported in burst types 1 and 3 is either 4, 8 or 16
depending on cell configuration and either 4 or 8 for burst type 2 depending
on cell configuration. The lengths of the fields within each burst are defined
in Table 6.2.1.

Midamble 1024 512 1024 Data field 2 1952 2208 1760 Guard Period 192 192 384
* * *
On the downlink, a spreading factor of 32 is supported. Additionally for DPCH,
PDSCH and HS-PDSCH, a spreading factor of 1 is supported on the downlink.
On the uplink, spreading factors of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 are supported for
DPCH, PUSCH and E-PUCH. PRACH and E-RUCCH only support spreading factors 16
and 32 and HS-SICH only supports spreading factor 32.
The spreading factors and burst types supported for different physical
channels are defined in Table 6.2.2.

2 E-HICH 32 1, 2 E-RUCCH 16, 32 3
* * *
Transmission of TPC and TFCI are performed in accordance with the general
procedures used for the existing 3.84 Mcps TDD option. Due to the maximum
spreading factor being increased from 16 (3.84Mcps) to 32 (7.68Mcps), usage of
SF16 for TPC/TFCI is replaced with SF32 where appropriate.
## 6.3 Midambles
Midambles for burst types 1, 2 and 3 are created using the method applied for
3.84Mcps TDD. The basic midamble code for burst types 1 and 3 is of length
912; for burst type 2 the basic midamble code is of length 456.
Default, common and UE specific midamble modes are supported in the 7.68Mcps
TDD option. The characteristics of these midamble allocations at 7.68Mcps are
identical to their characteristics at 3.84Mcps. The number of active
channelisation codes is signaled via midamble through an extension of the
scheme applied at 3.84Mcps TDD (the extension accounts for the higher
spreading factor supported at 7.68Mcps).
Midamble transmit powers are allocated as for 3.84Mcps TDD.
The association between midambles and channelisation codes for burst types 1,
2 and 3 are as shown in figure 6.3.1 for K~cell~ = 16, figure 6.3.2 for
K~cell~ = 8 and figure 6.3.3 for K~cell~ = 4. Secondary channelisation codes
are marked with a *. These associations apply both for UL and DL.
Figure 6.3.1: Association of Midambles to Spreading Codes for K~Cell~ = 16
Figure 6.3.2: Association of Midambles to Spreading Codes for K~Cell~ = 8
Figure 6.3.3: Association of Midambles to Spreading Codes for K~Cell~ = 4
For PRACH and E-RUCCH, up to 16 midambles and channelisation codes may be
supported. The training sequences, i.e. midambles, of different users active
in the same time slot are time shifted versions of a basic midamble code,
m~1~, or a second basic midamble code, m~2~, which is a time inverted version
of the basic midamble code m~1~. A fixed association exists between
PRACH/E-RUCCH midambles and channelisation codes.
## 6.4 Coding and Modulation
Multiplexing and channel coding is aligned with 3.84Mcps TDD with the
exception that physical channel sequence numbering and the coding of the
channelisation code set information on HS-SCCH and E-AGCH shall account for
the support of SF32 at 7.68Mcps.
## 6.5 Scrambling Codes
The binary scrambling code, $c_{7\text{.}\text{68}}^{n}$, for cell parameter
_n_ in the 7.68Mcps TDD option is formed from the concatenation of the binary
scrambling codes $c_{3\text{.}\text{84}}^{n}$and
$c_{3\text{.}\text{84}}^{\left( n + 2 \right)\text{mod}\text{128}}$shown in
Annex A of [4].
## 6.6 Synchronisation Codes
The synchronisation codes for the 7.68Mcps TDD option are formed by repetition
coding of the 3.84Mcps TDD synchronisation code words. Unique modulation
sequences are applied to these code words that enable the UE to determine the
code group, frame alignment and chip rate of the cell.
The synchronization channel (SCH) is constructed in an identical manner to the
construction at 3.84Mcps. The relationship between code group, _n_ , and
_t~offset,n~_ at 7.68Mcps is:
$t_{\text{offset},n} =$
## 6.7 Transmit diversity
Support for beamforming and transmit diversity are aligned with the 3.84Mcps
TDD option.
6.8 Measurements
## 6.9 Indicator Channels
### 6.9.1 Paging Indicator Channel (PICH)
The paging indicator channel is spread at SF32, but in other respects is
identical to the 3.84Mcps TDD PICH [2].
The PICH block may comprise up to N~PICH~ = 8 frames. The PCH block may
comprise up to 2 Ã— N~PCH~ = 2 Ã— 16 frames.
### 6.9.2 MBMS Indicator Channel (MICH)
The MBMS indicator channel is spread at SF32, but in other respects is
identical to the 3.84Mcps TDD MICH [2].
## 6.10 Mapping of transport channels to physical channels
In the 7.68Mcps TDD option, transport channels are mapped onto physical
channels according to figure 6.10.1.

* * *
Figure 6.10.1: Transport channel to physical channel mapping
The mapping between DCH, BCH, FACH, USCH and DSCH transport channels to
physical channels is identical to the mapping at 3.84Mcps TDD.
The mapping between the RACH transport channel and the PRACH physical channel
is identical to the mapping at 3.84Mcps TDD.
The mapping between the HS-DSCH transport channel and HS-PDSCH physical
channels is identical to the mapping at 3.84Mcps TDD. The association and
timing between HS-SCCH, HS-DSCH and HS-SICH is identical to the association
and timing at 3.84Mcps TDD with the exception that the UE must monitor up to a
maximum of eight HS-SCCH (M=8).
The mapping between the E-DCH transport channel and E-PUCH physical channels
is identical to the mapping at 3.84Mcps TDD. The association and timing
between E-AGCH, E-PUCH and E-HICH is identical to the association and timing
at 3.84Mcps TDD with the exception that up to two channelisation codes for
E-HICH are supported for the 7.68Mcps option.
The mapping of E-DCH control information to E-RUCCH when E-PUCH resources are
unavailable is identical to that for 3.84Mcps TDD.
# 7 Physical layer procedures
## 7.1 Power Control
Transmitter power control, both on the uplink and downlink, is aligned with
that of 3.84Mcps TDD.
## 7.2 Timing Advance
The timing advance architecture is the same as for 3.84Mcps TDD. The required
timing advance, \'UL Timing Advance\' TA~ul~ will be represented as a 7 bit
number (0-127) and shall be the multiplier of 4 chips which is nearest to the
required timing advance.
PUSCH, UL DPCH and HS-SICH are timing advanced. PRACH and E-RUCCH are not
timing advanced.
## 7.3 HSDPA procedures
The HS-DSCH procedure is aligned with 3.84Mcps TDD. When SCTD antenna
diversity is applied to HS-PDSCH on the beacon channel, the presence of
channelisation code $c_{\text{32}}^{(k = 1)}$shall implicitly indicate
presence of channelisation code $c_{\text{32}}^{(k = 2)}$.
## 7.4 Synchronisation procedures
The synchronization procedures are aligned with 3.84Mcps TDD.
## 7.5 RACH procedures
The RACH procedure is aligned with 3.84Mcps TDD. However, the use of higher
layer signaling to indicate that in some frames a timeslot shall be blocked
for RACH uplink transmission is not supported.
## 7.6 Discontinuous transmission (DTX) procedure
The DTX procedure is aligned with that of 3.84Mcps TDD.
## 7.7 Downlink transmit diversity procedure
The downlink transmit diversity procedure is aligned with that of 3.84Mcps
TDD. In Space Code Transmit Diversity mode the data sequence is spread with
the channelisation codes $c_{\text{32}}^{(k = 1)}$and $c_{\text{32}}^{(k =
2)}$, the spread sequence on code $c_{\text{32}}^{(k = 2)}$ is then
transmitted on the diversity antenna.
## 7.8 DSCH procedure
Higher layer signaling is used to indicate to the UE the need for PDSCH
detection. Physical layer signaling is not used to indicate to the UE the need
for PDSCH detection.
## 7.9 Macrodiversity procedure
The macrodiversity procedure is aligned with that of 3.84Mcps TDD.
## 7.10 IPDL procedure
The IPDL procedure is aligned with that of 3.84Mcps TDD.
## 7.11 E-DCH procedures
The E-DCH procedures are aligned with those of 3.84Mcps TDD with modifications
to accommodate SF32 for the E-PUCH code hopping procedure and the E-PUCH power
control procedure.
# 8 UE capabilities
UE capabilities for the 7.68 Mcps TDD mode are based on those for 3.84 Mcps
TDD. The capabilities for 7.68Mcps TDD account for the higher number of
physical channels supported and additionally support higher peak bit rates.
The minimum MBMS capability at 7.68Mcps is twice the minimum capability at
3.84Mcps. The detailed UE capabilities for 7.68Mcps TDD are described in [8].
# 9 Layer 2/3 protocol aspects
## 9.1 Protocol architecture
The protocol architecture for 7.68 Mcps TDD is the same as the protocol
architecture for 3.84 Mcps TDD. Section 5.1 of [7] provides an overview of the
radio interface protocol architecture.
## 9.2 Signalling
### 9.2.1 General
There are signalling differences between 7.68 Mcps TDD and 3.84 Mcps TDD.
These differences concern L2/MAC and L3/RRC (see Section 5.1 of [7]) only.
L2/RLC, L2/BMC, L2/PDCP and L3 U-plane information are not impacted.
### 9.2.2 L2/MAC differences
The L2/MAC differences between 7.68Mcps TDD and 3.84Mcps TDD are due to the
support of a higher capability HSDPA UE at 7.68Mcps (20.4Mbps) and a higher
capability E-DCH UE at 7.68Mcps (17.7Mbps). The L2/MAC differences concern:
\- the maximum number of PDUs transmitted in a single TTI (636 at 7.68Mcps
compared to 318 for3.84 Mcps TDD).
\- HSPDA transport block size signalling. The maximum transport block size
that can be signalled at 7.68Mcps is twice that at 3.84Mcps. A new table and
formula for transport block size signalling for 7.68 Mcps TDD HS-DSCH is
included in [9].
\- E-DCH transport block size signalling. The maximum transport block size
that can be signalled at 7.68Mcps is approximately twice that at 3.84Mcps. A
new table and formula for transport block size signalling for 7.68 Mcps TDD
E-DCH is included in [9].
### 9.2.3 L2/RRC differences
The L2/RRC differences concern:
**Use of SF 32:** The signalling is extended to include support for SF32. The
7.68 Mcps cell will be configured to use SF 16 or 32 for PRACH and E-RUCCH
rather than SF 8 and 16 as 3.84 Mcps
**Open Loop Power Control:** Configuration of a cell for use of SF 16 or 32
with respect to the PRACH impacts calculation of the uplink transmit power for
PRACH and requires the UE to add 3dB to the RACH Constant Value in the
equation:
> P~PRACH~ = L~PCCPCH~ + I~BTS~ + PRACH Constant value
for the case where RACH Spreading Factor = 16.
The same applies for open loop power control of E-RUCCH.
**Capability Update Requirement:** A new IE \"UE radio access 7.68 Mcps TDD
capability update requirement\" is used.
**Uplink Timing Advance** : A different Uplink Timing Advance IE is required
at 7.68Mcps to account for the number of bits used to signal timing advance at
7.68Mcps. A number of RRC messages are impacted due to the use of a different
Uplink Timing Advance IE for 7.68 Mcps TDD to 3.84 Mcps TDD.
**DL Physical Channel Capability:** The physical channel capability at
7.68Mcps is extended in order to account for the greater number of physical
channels supported at 7.68Mcps.
**Burst Types and Midambles:** Signalling related to burst types is modified
since burst type 2 at 7.68Mcps supports K~cell~ of 4 or 8.
## 9.3 HSDPA related issues
The highest UE capability at 7.68Mcps is double that at 3.84Mcps, hence the
maximum transport block size and the maximum number of PDUs that can be
transmitted in a single TTI are double that of 3.84 Mcps. The range of UE
capabilities is extended and the maximum UE capablitity for 7.68 Mcps is 20.4
Mbits/s.
## 9.4 Mobility
Inter RAT and intra RAT handover for 7.68 Mcps TDD is as for 3.84 Mcps TDD
with handover between 3.84 Mcps TDD and 7.68 Mcps TDD cells also supported.
Bands a), b), c), a + b), a + c), b + c) and a + b + c) can be configured for
7.68 Mcps TDD or 3.84 Mcps TDD or 1.28 Mcps TDD.
## 9.5 Idle Mode Procedures
Idle mode procedures are as for 3.84 Mcps TDD.
## 9.6 E-DCH related issues
The highest UE capability at 7.68Mcps is approximately double that at
3.84Mcps, hence the maximum transport block size and the maximum number of
PDUs that can be transmitted in a single TTI are increasedwith respect to that
of 3.84 Mcps. The range of UE capabilities is extended and the maximum UE
capablitity for 7.68 Mcps is 17.7 Mbits/s.
# 10 Iub/Iur aspects
## 10.1 Impacts on Iub/Iur interfaces -- general aspects
### 10.1.1 Timing advance and Rx Timing Deviation
The timing advance algorithm (in RRM, at the RNC) uses Rx Timing Deviation
measurements made by the Node B and passed to the RNC in frame protocols. At
3.84 Mcps the resolution is 4 chips. The timing advance determined by RRM is
signalled to the UE (RRC).
In addition, the Node B can be configured to take more accurate Rx Timing
Deviation measurements of a UE, which are sent to the RNC as dedicated
measurements. At 3.84 Mcps the resolution of these is 0.0625 chips. These
accurate measurements can be used in location (they are passed to the location
system using the PCAP protocol).
Strategy for 7.68 Mcps :
Timing advance & Rx Timing Deviation over FP
> 4 chip resolution
> same dynamic range as 3.84 Mcps (in secs)
Rx Timing Deviation, dedicated measurement
> 0.0625 chip resolution giving greater measurement accuracy
> same dynamic range as 3.84 Mcps (in secs)
### 10.1.2 Paging
For the 7.68Mcps option, the maximum number of paging indicators per paging
block should be doubled to accommodate the greater number of users that may be
supported by the 10 MHz carrier. To achieve this:
â€¢ the number of PICH blocks per paging block (NPICH) is extended from {2,4} to
{2,4,8}
â€¢ the number of PCH blocks per paging block (NPCH) is extended from {1..8} to
{1..16}.
Consequently, a unique value range for the PI-bitmap needs to be defined for
7.68 Mcps.
### 10.1.3 DSCH Power Control from the RNC
In 3.84 Mcps TDD, the PDSCH may be power controlled from the RNC by sending a
transmit power level value in the DSCH DATA FRAME that carries DSCH transport
blocks to the Node B. For 7.68 Mcps, the same method can be used and this has
been agreed by RAN1. Since the transmit power level is expressed relative to
the maximum transmit power, no changes are needed to accommodate 7.68Mcps.
## 10.2 Impacts on Iub/Iur control plane protocols
There are a number of changes to RNSAP, PCAP & NBAP protocols to incorporate:
**\- Use of SF 32:** The signalling is extended to include support for SF32.
The 7.68 Mcps cell will be configured to use SF 16 or 32 for PRACH and E-RUCCH
rather than SF 8 and 16 as 3.84 Mcps
**\- Burst Types and Midambles:** Signalling related to burst types is
modified since burst type 2 at 7.68Mcps supports K~cell~ of 4 or 8.
**\- Number of physical channels:** the SF32 change implies an increase in the
number of physical channels that may be supported.
**\- Measurements:** changes are introduced for Rx Timing Deviation and SFN-
SFN measurements.
**\- Cell Synchronisation:** this procedure is not supported.
## 10.3 Impacts on Iub/Iur user plane protocols
Specifications 25.425, 25.427 and 25.435 are modified to include 7.68Mcps
operation in a similar fashion to 3.84 Mcps. Changes are also needed to
accommodate the different rx timing deviation and timing advance signalling
for 7.68Mcps compared to 3.84Mcps (see Section 10.1 above). The paging
indicator bit-map is also revised (see Section 10.1 above).

##### 11.1.1.2.1 Occupied bandwidth
Occupied bandwidth is a measure of the bandwidth containing 99% of the total
integrated power of the transmitted spectrum, centred on the assigned channel
frequency. The occupied channel bandwidth shall be less than 10 MHz based on a
chip rate of 7.68 Mcps.
##### 11.1.1.2.2 Out of band emission
Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the nominal
channel resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the
transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This out of band emission limit
is specified in terms of a spectrum emission mask and adjacent channel leakage
power ratio (ACLR).
###### 11.1.1.2.2.1 Spectrum emission mask
The spectrum emission mask of the UE applies to frequencies, which are between
5 MHz and 25MHz from the UE centre carrier frequency. The out of channel
emission is specified relative to the RRC filtered mean power of the UE
carrier. The power of any UE emission shall not exceed the levels specified in

the measuring equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. To
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth can be different from the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution
bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be
integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent
noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
