## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**Ancillary RF amplifier:** piece of equipment, which when connected by RF
coaxial cables to the BS, has the primary function to provide amplification
between the transmit and/or receive antenna connector of a BS and an antenna
without requiring any control signal to fulfil its amplifying function.
**Bit Error Ratio:** ratio of the bits wrongly received to all data bits sent.
NOTE: The bits are the data bits above the convolutional/turbo decoder. The
BER is the overall BER independent of frame erasures or when erased frames are
not defined.

c) The use of other transmit to receive frequency separations in existing or
other frequency bands shall not be precluded.
d) When configured to operate in DC-HSDPA with a single UL frequency, the TX-
RX frequency separation in Table 3.0A shall be applied for the serving HS-DSCH
cell. For bands XII, XIII and XIV, the TX-RX frequency separation in Table

carriers.
e) When configured to operate on dual cells in both the DL and UL, the TX-RX
frequency separation in Table 3.0A shall be applied to the primary UL
frequency and DL frequency of the serving HS-DSCH cell, and to the secondary
UL frequency and the frequency of the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell
respectively.
f) When configured to operate on single/dual band 4C-HSDPA or single band
8C-HSDPA or single band NC-4C-HSDPA with a single UL frequency, the TX-RX
frequency separation in Table 3.0A shall be applied for the DL frequency of
the serving HS-DSCH cell. When configured to operate on single/dual band

DSCH cell respectively.
g) For bands XII, XIII and XIV, the requirements in TS 25.104 are applicable
only for a single uplink carrier frequency, however dual cell uplink operation
may be considered in future releases.
h) When configured to operate on dual band dual cell HSDPA or dual band
4C-HSDPA with dual band UL frequencies, the TX-RX frequency separation in
Table 3.0A shall be applied to the primary UL frequency and DL frequency of
the serving HS-DSCH cell, and to the secondary UL frequency and the frequency

## 3.5 Channel arrangement
### 3.5.1 Channel spacing
The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario.
### 3.5.2 Channel raster
The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the centre
frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition a number of
additional centre frequencies are specified according to table 3.2, which
means that the centre frequencies for these channels are shifted 100 kHz
relative to the general raster.
### 3.5.3 Channel number
The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (UARFCN). For each operating Band, the UARFCN values are
defined as follows.
Uplink: N~U~ = 5 * (F~UL~ - F~UL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~UL_low~ ≤ F~UL~ ≤ F~UL_high~
Downlink: N~D~ = 5 * (F~DL~ - F~DL_Offset~), for the carrier frequency range
F~DL_low~ ≤ F~DL~ ≤ F~DL_high~
For each operating Band, F~UL_Offset~, F~UL_low~, F~UL_high~, F~DL_Offset~,,
F~DL_low~ and F~DL_high~ are defined in Table 3.1 for the general UARFCN. For
the additional UARFCN, F~UL_Offset~, F~DL_Offset~ and the specific F~UL~ and

# 4 General test conditions and declarations
Many of the tests in this specification measure a parameter relative to a
value that is not fully specified in the UTRA specifications. For these tests,
the Minimum Requirement is determined relative to a nominal value specified by
the manufacturer.
Certain functions of a BS are optional in the UTRA specifications. Some
requirements for the BS may be regional as listed in clause 4.7.
When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal value of
a parameter, or whether an option is supported. The manufacturer declarations
are listed in clauses 4.8 and 4.11.
## 4.1 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the stimulus
signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified tolerance and
the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the
specified values. All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and
are valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1 apply to
the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not include system
effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.
### 4.1.1 Measurement of test environments
The measurement accuracy of the BS test environments defined in Clause 4.4,
Test environments shall be.
> Pressure: ±5 kPa.
>
> Temperature: ±2 degrees.
>
> Relative Humidity: ±5 %.
>
> DC Voltage: ±1,0 %.
>
> AC Voltage: ±1,5 %.
>
> Vibration: 10 %.
>
> Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz.
The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

### 4.2.4 RRM measurements
The following tolerances refer to the requirements of 25.133.
tbd
## 4.3 Interpretation of measurement results
The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk
principle.
The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 [17].
The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the measurement of
each parameter shall be included in the test report.
The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in clause 4.1 of
this specification.
If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause 4.1, it is still permitted to use this
apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.
Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified in
clause 4.1 shall be used to tighten the Test Requirement-making the test
harder to pass. (For some tests e.g. receiver tests, this may require
modification of stimulus signals). This procedure (defined in Annex F) will
ensure that a Test System not compliant with clause 4.1does not increase the
chance of passing a device under test where that device would otherwise have
failed the test if a Test System compliant with clause 4.1 had been used.
## 4.3A Base station classes
The requirements in the present document apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations, Local Area Base Stations and Home Base Stations
unless otherwise stated.
Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB. The Wide
Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the base station for
General Purpose application in Release 99, 4 and 5.
Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 53 dB.
Local Area Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell** scenarios with **a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB**.
Home Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from Femto
Cell** scenarios.
The manufacturer shall declare the intended class of the BS under test.
## 4.4 Test environments
For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions under
which the BS is to be tested are defined.
### 4.4.1 Normal test environment
When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should be

**Maximum temperature:**
The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming
to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 [9].
NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational prior to
the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.
### 4.4.3 Vibration
When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as defined
by the manufacturer's declaration for the equipment under test. This shall use
the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing the required
environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to the test procedure
of IEC 60 068-2-6 [10]. Other environmental conditions shall be within the
ranges specified in clause 4.4.1.
NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in to
equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should only
vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.
### 4.4.4 Power supply

be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating voltage
defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
**Upper voltage limit:**
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and

flatness across this minimum bandwidth shall be less than ±0.5 dB and the peak
to average ratio at a probability of 0.001% shall exceed 10 dB.
## 4.5 Selection of configurations for testing
Most tests in the present document are only performed for a subset of the
possible combinations of test conditions. For instance:
‑ not all transceivers in the configuration may be specified to be tested;
‑ only one RF channel may be specified to be tested;
‑ only one timeslot may be specified to be tested.
When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the choice of which
combinations are to be tested shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.
When a test is performed by a manufacturer, the choice of which combinations
are to be tested may be specified by an operator.
## 4.6 BS Configurations
### 4.6.1 Receiver diversity
For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement applies at
each receiver antenna connector for receivers with antenna diversity.
Receiver requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the remaining
receiver(s) disabled or their antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the
manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be equivalent, it is
sufficient to apply the specified test signal at any one of the receiver
antenna connectors.
For a multi-band BS, multi-band tests for ACS, blocking and intermodulation
are performed with the interferer(s) applied to each antenna connector mapped
to the receiver for the wanted signal(s), however only to one antenna at a
time. Antenna connectors to which no signals are applied are terminated.
### 4.6.2 Duplexers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer fitted,
if a duplexer is supplied as part of the BS. If the duplexer is supplied as an
option by the manufacturer, sufficient tests should be repeated with and
without the duplexer fitted to verify that the BS meets the requirements of
the present document in both cases.
The following tests should be performed with the duplexer fitted, and without
it fitted if this is an option:
1) clause 6.2.1, base station maximum output power, for the highest static
power step only, if this is measured at the antenna connector;
2) clause 6.5, output RF spectrum emissions; outside the BS transmit band;
3) clause 6.5.3.4.3, protection of the BS receiver;
4) clause 6.6, transmit intermodulation; for the testing of conformance, the
carrier frequencies should be selected to minimize intermodulation products
from the transmitters falling in receive channels.
The remaining tests may be performed with or without the duplexer fitted.
NOTE 1: When performing receiver tests with a duplexer fitted, it is important
to ensure that the output from the transmitters does not affect the test
apparatus. This can be achieved using a combination of attenuators, isolators
and filters.
NOTE 2: When duplexers are used, intermodulation products will be generated,
not only in the duplexer but also in the antenna system. The intermodulation
products generated in the antenna system are not controlled by 3GPP
specifications, and may degrade during operation (e.g. due to moisture
ingress). Therefore, to ensure continued satisfactory operation of a BS, an
operator will normally select ARFCNs to minimize intermodulation products
falling on receive channels. For testing of complete conformance, an operator
may specify the ARFCNs to be used.
### 4.6.3 Power supply options
If the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply configurations,
it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each of the power supply
options, provided that it can be demonstrated that the range of conditions
over which the equipment is tested is at least as great as the range of
conditions due to any of the power supply configurations.
This applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be supplied
either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In this case, the
conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power supply options can be
tested by testing only the external DC supply option. The range of DC input
voltages for the test should be sufficient to verify the performance with any
of the power supplies, over its range of operating conditions within the BS,
including variation of mains input voltage, temperature and output current.
### 4.6.4 Ancillary RF amplifiers
The requirements of the present document shall be met with the ancillary RF
amplifier fitted. At tests according to clauses 6 and 7 for TX and RX
respectively, the ancillary amplifier is connected to the BS by a connecting
network ( including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with applicable loss to
make sure the appropriate operating conditions of the ancillary amplifier and
the BS. The applicable connecting network loss range is declared by the
manufacturer. Other characteristics and the temperature dependence of the
attenuation of the connecting network are neglected. The actual attenuation
value of the connecting network is chosen for each test as one of the
applicable extreme values. The lowest value is used unless otherwise stated.
Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted and,
if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify that the BS
meets the requirements of the present document in both cases.
When testing, the following tests should be repeated with the optional
ancillary amplifier fitted according to the table below, where x denotes that
the test is applicable:
Table 4.3
* * *
Receiver Tests Clause TX amplifier only RX amplifier only TX/RX amplifiers
combined (Note) 7.2 X X 7.5 X X 7.6 X X 7.7 X  
Transmitter Tests 6.2 X X 6.5.1 X X 6.5.2.2 X X 6.5.3 X X 6.6 X X
* * *
NOTE: Combining can be by duplex filters or any other network. The amplifiers
can either be in RX or TX branch or in both. Either one of these amplifiers
could be a passive network.
In test according to clauses 6.2 and 7.2 highest applicable attenuation value
is applied.
### 4.6.5 BS using antenna arrays
A BS may be configured with a multiple antenna port connection for some or all
of its transceivers or with an antenna array related to one cell (not one
array per transceiver). This clause applies to a BS which meets at least one
of the following conditions:
\- the transmitter output signals from one or more transceiver appear at more
than one antenna port; or
\- there is more than one receiver antenna port for a transceiver or per cell
and an input signal is required at more than one port for the correct
operation of the receiver thus the outputs from the transmitters as well as
the inputs to the receivers are directly connected to several antennas (known
as \"aircombining\"); or
\- transmitters and receivers are connected via duplexers to more than one
antenna.
In case of diversity or MIMO, multiple antennas are not considered as an
antenna array. If a BS is used, in normal operation, in conjunction with an
antenna system which contains filters or active elements which are necessary
to meet the UTRA requirements, the conformance tests may be performed on a
system comprising the BS together with these elements, supplied separately for
the purposes of testing. In this case, it must be demonstrated that the
performance of the configuration under test is representative of the system in
normal operation, and the conformance assessment is only applicable when the
BS is used with the antenna system.
For conformance testing of such a BS, the following procedure may be used.
#### 4.6.5.1 Receiver tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the receiver antenna connectors
shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied equals the
power of the test signal(s) specified in the test.
An example of a suitable test set-up is shown in figure 4.1.
Figure 4.1: Receiver test set-up
For spurious emissions from the receiver antenna connector, the test may be
performed separately for each receiver antenna connector.
#### 4.6.5.2 Transmitter tests
For each test, the test signals applied to the transmitter antenna connectors
**(P~i~)** shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals applied
equals the power of the test signal(s) **(P~s~)** specified in the test. This
may be assessed by separately measuring the signals emitted by each antenna
connector and summing the results, or by combining the signals and performing
a single measurement. The characteristics (e.g. amplitude and phase) of the
combining network should be such that the power of the combined signal is
maximised.
An example of a suitable test set-up is shown in figure 4.2.
Figure 4.2: Transmitter test set-up
For Intermodulation attenuation, the test may be performed separately for each
transmitter antenna connector.
### 4.6.6 Transmit diversity and MIMO transmission
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present document,
the requirement applies for each transmitter antenna connector in case of
transmit diversity, DB-DC-HSDPA or MIMO transmission.
Transmitter requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the
remaining antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the transmitter paths to be equivalent, it is sufficient to measure
the signal at any one of the transmitter antenna connectors.
### 4.6.7 BS with integrated Iuant BS modem
Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the integrated
Iuant BS modem shall be switched off. Spurious emissions according to clauses
6.5.3 and 7.7 shall be measured only for frequencies above 20MHz with the
integrated Iuant BS modem switched on.
### 4.6.8 BS with Virtual Antenna Mapping
A BS may be configured with virtual antenna mapping (VAM) as shown as example
in Figure 4.3 for MIMO mode with two transmit antennas. The purpose of VAM is
to achieve the goal of power balancing of physical channels across the
multiple physical antennas when MIMO mode with two or four transmit antennas
is is deployed in the downlink. Since the non-MIMO channels are transmitted
only via virtual antenna 1, the transmission powers are not balanced at point
a. The VAM function transforms the input signals at point a to output signals
at point b such that the transmission powers are balanced.
In the following some characteristics of VAM are described in the context of
MIMO mode with two transmit antennas. Similar characteristics apply also when
VAM is implemented in the context of MIMO mode with four transmit antennas.
Some characteristics of VAM are as follows:
\- The VAM can be represented by a unitary matrix $\begin{bmatrix} s_{1} &
s_{3} \ s_{2} & s_{4} \ \end{bmatrix}$
\- The same pair of weights (s~1~,s~2~) are applied to each physical channel
that appears at virtual antenna port 1
\- The same pair of weights (s~3~,s~4~) are applied to each physical channel
that appears at virtual antenna port 2
\- The VAM weights (s~1~,s~2~,s~3~,s~4~) should satisfy the following
condition for MIMO and non-MIMO channels : $\left| s_{1} \right|^{2} + \left|
s_{3} \right|^{2} = \left| s_{2} \right|^{2} + \left| s_{4} \right|^{2} = 1$
\- Power balancing at the output of VAM is achieved by setting $\left| s_{1}
\right|^{2} = \left| s_{2} \right|^{2}\text{\ and\ }\left| s_{3} \right|^{2} =
\left| s_{4} \right|^{2}$
\- The VAM function is implemented in the digital domain prior to digital to
analog conversion.
Figure 4.3: Example of VAM for MIMO mode with two transmit antennas.
If NodeB manufacturer declares the implementation of a Virtual Antenna Mapping
(VAM), then the S-CPICH power accuracy test in section 6.2.3 will not be
performed.

### 4.8.1 Base Station RF Bandwidth position for non-single carrier testing
Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth
located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency range in each
operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~(bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and
T~RFBW~ (top).
Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and
T~RFBW~ defined as following:

configurations as listed in subclause 4.11.6. The test configurations to use
for conformance testing are defined for each supported RF configuration in
subclause 4.12.4
The applicable Test Models for generation of the carrier transmit test signal
are defined in subclause 6.1.1.
### 4.12.1 UTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation test configuration
The purpose of the UTC1 is to test both BS transmitter and receiver
requirements. UTC1 should be constructed using the following method:
\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth shall be the declared maximum Base Station RF
Bandwidth for contiguous operation.
\- Place one UTRA FDD carrier adjacent to the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge and one UTRA FDD carrier adjacent to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge. The specified F~Offset~ shall apply.
\- For transmitter tests, alternately place a UTRA FDD carrier adjacent to the
already placed carriers at the low and high Base Station RF Bandwidth edges
until there is no more space to fit a carrier or the BS does not support more
carriers. The nominal carrier spacing defined in subclause 3.5.1 shall apply.
\- The carrier(s) may be shifted maximum 100 kHz towards lower frequencies for
B~RFBW~ and M~RFBW~ and towards higher frequencies for T~RFBW~ to align with
the channel raster.
#### 4.12.1.1 UTC1 power allocation
Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the rated total output power (Prated,t) according to the
manufacturer's declaration in sub clause 4.11.6.
### 4.12.2 UTC2: Non-contiguous spectrum operation test configuration
The purpose of the UTC2 is to test both the BS transmitter and receiver
requirements. UTC2 should be constructed using the following method:
\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth shall be the maximum Base Station RF
Bandwidth for non-contiguous operation. The Base Station RF Bandwidth consists
of one sub-block gap and two sub-blocks located at the edges of the declared
maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth.
\- For transmitter tests, place one UTRA FDD carrier adjacent to the upper
Base Station RF Bandwidth edge and one UTRA FDD carrier adjacent to the lower
Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. The specified F~Offset~ shall apply.
\- For receiver tests, place one UTRA carrier adjacent to the upper Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge and one UTRA carrier adjacent to the lower Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge. If the supported maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth
is at least 35 MHz and the BS supports at least 4 UTRA FDD carriers, place a
UTRA FDD carrier adjacent to each already placed carrier for each sub-block.
The nominal carrier spacing defined in subclause 3.5.1 shall apply.
\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined using
the specified F~Offset~ for the carrier adjacent to the sub-block gap.
\- The UTRA FDD carrier in the lower sub-block may be shifted maximum100 kHz
towards lower frequencies and the UTRA FDD carrier in the upper sub-block may
be shifted maximum100 kHz towards higher frequencies to align with the channel
raster.
#### 4.12.2.1 UTC2 power allocation
Set the power of each carrier to the same power so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the rated total output power (Prated,t) according to the
manufacturer's declaration in subclause 4.11.6.
### 4.12.3 Multi-band operation test configurations
#### 4.12.3.1 UTC3: Multi-band test configuration for full carrier allocation
The purpose of UTC3 is to test multi-band operation aspects considering
maximum supported number of carriers.
UTC3 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable per band
involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed using the following
method:
\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported operating band in
multi-band operation.
\- The number of carriers of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum number of supported carriers in multi-band operation.
Carriers shall first be placed at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum
Radio Bandwidth. Additional carriers shall next be placed at the edges of the
Base Station RF Bandwidth edges, if possible.
\- The allocated Base Station RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall be
located at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth.
\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and the
carrier placement in each band shall be according to UTC1, where the declared
parameters for multi-band operation shall apply.
\- If a multi-band BS supports three carriers only, two carriers shall be
placed in one band according to UTC1 while the remaining carrier shall be
placed at the edge of the Maximum Radio Bandwidth in the other band.
\- If the sum of the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported
operating bands is larger than the declared Total RF Bandwidth BW~tot~ of
transmitter and receiver for the declared band combinations of the BS, repeat
the steps above for test configurations where the Base Station RF Bandwidth of
one of the operating band shall be reduced so that the Total RF Bandwidth
BW~tot~ of transmitter and receiver is not exceeded and vice versa.
\- If the sum of the maximum number of supported carrier of each supported
operating bands in multi-band operation is larger than the declared total
number of supported carriers for the declared band combinations of the BS,
repeat the steps above for test configurations where in each test
configuration the number of carriers of one of the operating band shall be
reduced so that the total number of supported carriers is not exceeded and
vice versa.
##### 4.12.3.1.1 UTC3 power allocation
Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
operating bands to the same power so that the sum of the carrier powers equals
the total output power, according to the manufacturer's declaration.
If the allocated power of a supported operating band(s) exceeds the declared
Prated,t of the operating band(s) in multi-band operation, the exceeded part
shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other band(s). If the power
allocated for a carrier exceeds the declared Prated,c for that carrier, the
exceeded power shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other carriers.
#### 4.12.3.2 UTC4: Multi-band test configuration with high PSD per carrier
The purpose of UTC4 is to test multi-band operation aspects considering higher
PSD cases with reduced number of carriers and non-contiguous operation (if
supported) in multi-band mode.
ETC4 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable per band
involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed using the following
method:
\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth in multi-band operation.
\- The allocated Base Station RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall be
located at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth.
\- The maximum number of carriers is limited to two per band. Carriers shall
first be placed at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio
Bandwidth. Additional carriers shall next be placed at the Base Station RF
Bandwidth edges, if possible.
\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and the
carrier placement in each band shall be according to UTC2, where the declared
parameters for multi-band operation shall apply.
\- If a multi-band BS supports three carriers only, two carriers shall be
placed in one band according to UTC2 while the remaining carrier shall be
placed at the edge of the Maximum Radio Bandwidth in the other band.
\- If the sum of the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported
operating bands is larger than the declared Total RF Bandwidth BW~tot~ of
transmitter and receiver for the declared band combinations of the BS, repeat
the steps above for test configurations where the Base Station RF Bandwidth of
one of the operating band shall be reduced so that the Total RF Bandwidth
BW~tot~ of transmitter and receiver is not exceeded and vice versa.
##### 4.12.3.2.1 UTC4 power allocation
Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
operating bands to the same power so that the sum of the carrier powers equals
the total output power, according to manufacturer's declaration.
If the allocated power of a supported operating band(s) exceeds the declared
Prated,t of the operating band(s) in multi-band operation, the exceeded part
shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other band(s). If the power
allocated for a carrier exceeds the declared Prated,c for that carrier, the
exceeded power shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other carriers.
### 4.12.4 Applicability of test configurations
The present subclause defines for each RF test requirement the set of
mandatory test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating
conformance. The applicable test configurations are specified in the tables
below for each the supported RF configuration, which shall be declared

## 4.13 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in clause 6 and 7
apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated. For some
requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or exclusions to
the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band operation.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations (multi-band
or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more antenna port(s) in
different ways are possible. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the following applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, spectrum emission mask, ACLR,
transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions requirements apply
to each antenna connector.
\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band requirements
shall apply to the antenna connector configured for single-band operation and
no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are applicable. Single-
band requirements are tested separately at the antenna connector configured
for single-band operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.
# 5 Format and interpretation of tests

**X Title**
All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the present
document, unless otherwise stated.
**X.1 Definition and applicability**
This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under consideration
and specifies whether the test is applicable to all equipment or only to a
certain subset.
**X.2 Minimum Requirement**
This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference (or
core) specification which defines the Minimum Requirement.
**X.3 Test purpose**
This clause defines the purpose of the test.
**X.4 Method of test**
> **X.4.1 Initial conditions**
This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the test
environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement set-up.
**X.4.2 Procedure**
This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and provides
further details of the test definition like point of access (e.g. antenna
port), domain (e.g. frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g. bandwidth), and
algorithms (e.g. averaging).
**X.5 Test Requirement**
This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test. See
clause 4.3 Interpretation of measurement results.
# 6 Transmitter
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for a
single transmitter antenna connector. In case of transmit diversity, DB-DC-
HSDPA or MIMO transmission, the requirements apply for each transmitter
antenna connector.
A BS supporting DC-HSDPA and DB-DC-HSDPA transmits two cells simultaneously. A
BS supporting DC-HSDPA transmits two cells simultaneously on adjacent carrier
frequencies.
Unless otherwise stated, all tests in this clause shall be performed at the BS
antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus such
as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used, the
tests according to clauses 4.6.2 and/or 4.6.4, depending on the device added,
shall be performed to ensure that the requirements are met at test port B.
Figure 6.1: Transmitter test ports
Power levels are expressed in dBm.
### 6.1.1 Test Models
The set-up of physical channels for transmitter tests shall be according to
one of the Test Models below. A reference to the applicable table is made with
each test.
For Tx diversity transmission, the same Test Model shall be used for both
antennas. No diversity coding of the Test Models is required.
A code \"level setting\" of -X dB is the setting that according to the base
station manufacturer will result in a code domain power of nominally X dB
below the maximum output power. The relative accuracy of the code domain power
to the maximum output power shall have tolerance of ±1 dB.
#### 6.1.1.1 Test Model 1 -- TM1
This model shall be used for tests on:
\- occupied bandwidth;
\- spectrum emission mask;
\- ACLR;
\- spurious emissions;
\- transmit intermodulation;
\- base station maximum output power.
\- Total power dynamic range (at Pmax,c)
\- Home base station output power for adjacent channel protection
\- Frequency error (at Pmax,c)
\- IPDL time mask
Due to the amplitude statistics of TM1 [2], it is sufficient to test all
requirements above with TM1 regardless of the modulation schemes supported by
the Node-B.
In addition, the test model is used for Error Vector Magnitude using QPSK
modulation (at Pmax,c).
64 DPCHs at 30 ksps (SF=128) are distributed randomly across the code space,
at random power levels and random timing offsets are defined so as to simulate
a realistic traffic scenario which may have high PAR (Peak to Average Ratio).
Considering that not every base station implementation will support 64 DPCH,
variants of this test model containing 32 and 16 DPCH are also specified. For
Home base station, additional options of this test model containing 8 and 4
DPCH are also specified. The conformance test shall be performed using the
largest of these options that can be supported by the equipment under test.
\"Fraction of power\" is relative to the maximum output power on the TX
antenna interface under test.

#### 6.1.1.5 DPCH Structure of the Downlink Test Models
For the above test models the following structure is adopted for the DPCH. The
DPDCH and DPCCH have the same power level. The timeslot structure should be as
described by TS 25.211-slot format 10 and 6 that are reproduced in table 6.7.

The test DPCH has frame structure so that the pilot bits are defined over 15
timeslots according to the relevant columns of TS 25.211, which are reproduced
in table 6.8.

The TPC bits alternate 00 / 11 starting with 00 in timeslot 0.
The aggregate 15 x 30 = 450 DPDCH bits per frame are filled with a PN9
sequence generated using the primitive trinomial . In case there are less data
bits/frame needed then the first bits of the aggregate shall be selected. To
ensure non-correlation of the PN9 sequences, each DPDCH shall use its
channelization code as the seed for the PN sequence at the start of each
frame, according to its timing offset.
The sequence shall be generated in a nine-stage shift register whose 5^th^ and
9^th^ stage outputs are added in a modulo‑two addition stage, and the result
is fed back to the input of the first stage. The generator shall be seeded so
that the sequence begins with the channelization code starting from the LSB,
and followed by 2 consecutive ONEs for SF=128 and 1 consecutive ONE for
SF=256.

##### 6.1.1.6.1 P-CCPCH
The aggregate 15 x 18 = 270 P-CCPCH bits per frame are filled with a PN9
sequence generated using the primitive trinomial . Channelization code of the
P-CCPCH is used as the seed for the PN sequence at the start of each frame.
The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the 8 bit
channelization code starting from the LSB, and followed by a ONE.
##### 6.1.1.6.2 PICH
PICH carries 18 Paging Indicators (Pq) sent in the following sequence from
left to right [1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0]. This defines the 288
first bits of the PICH. No power is transmitted for the 12 remaining unused
bits.
##### 6.1.1.6.3 Primary scrambling code and SCH
The scrambling code should be 0.
Where multiple repetitions of the Test Model signals are being used to
simulate a multi-carrier signal the scrambling code for the lower frequency is
0. Carriers added at successively higher frequencies use codes 1, 2,... and
their frame structures are time offset by 1/5, 2/5... of a time slot duration.
The scrambling code defines the SSC sequence of the secondary SCH. In their
active part, primary and secondary SCH share equally the power level defined
for \"PCCPCH+SCH\".
##### 6.1.1.6.4 S-CCPCH containing PCH
The aggregate 15 x 20 = 300 S-CCPCH bits per frame are used. Data bits are
filled with a PN9 sequence generated using the primitive trinomial . In case
there are less data bits/frame needed then the first bits of the aggregate
shall be selected.. Channelization code of the S-CCPCH is used as the seed for
the PN sequence at the start of each frame. For test purposes, any one of the
four possible slot formats 0,1, 2 and 3 can be supported. The support for all
four slot formats is not needed..
The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the 8 bit
channelization code starting from the LSB, and followed by a ONE. The test on
S-CCPCH has a frame structure so that the pilot bits are defined over 15
timeslots to the relevant columns of TS 25.211. The TFCI bits are filled with
ONEs whenever needed.

There are 640 bits per slot in a 16QAM-modulated HS-PDSCH. The aggregate 15 x
640 = 9600 bits per frame are filled with repetitions of a PN9 sequence
generated using the primitive trinomial . To ensure non-correlation of the PN9
sequences, each HS-PDSCH shall use its channelization code multiplied by 23 as
the seed for the PN sequence at the start of each frame.
The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the
channelization code multiplied by 23 starting from the LSB.

#### 6.1.1.8 HS-SCCH Structure of the Downlink Test Models 5 and 6
There are 40 bits per time slot in a HS-SCCH. The aggregate 15 x 40 = 600 bits
per frame are filled with repetitions of a PN9 sequence generated using the
primitive trinomial . Channelization code of the HS-SCCH is used as the seed
for the PN sequence at the start of each frame. The generator shall be seeded
so that the sequence begins with the channelization code starting from the
LSB, and followed by 2 consecutive ONEs.
#### 6.1.1.9 HS-PDSCH Structure of the Downlink TM6
There are 960 bits per slot in a 64QAM-modulated HS-PDSCH. The aggregate 15 x
960 = 14400 bits per frame are filled with repetitions of a PN9 sequence
generated using the primitive trinomial . To ensure non-correlation of the PN9
sequences, each HS-PDSCH shall use its channelization code multiplied by 23 as
the seed for the PN sequence at the start of each frame.
The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the
channelization code multiplied by 23 starting from the LSB.

this test is defined in clause 4.2 and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex F.
## 6.5 Output RF spectrum emissions
The physical channels for the following test(s) shall be set-up according to
clause 6.1.1.1.
### 6.5.1 Occupied bandwidth
#### 6.5.1.1 Definition and applicability
The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below the
lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted are each
equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean transmitted power.
The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0,5%.
#### 6.5.1.2 Minimum Requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 [1] clause 6.6.1.1.
#### 6.5.1.3 Test purpose
The occupied bandwidth, defined in the Radio Regulations of the International
Telecommunication Union ITU, is a useful concept for specifying the spectral
properties of a given emission in the simplest possible manner; see also ITU-R
Recommendation SM.328 [11]. The test purpose is to verify that the emission of
the BS does not occupy an excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided
and is, therefore, not likely to create interference to other users of the
spectrum beyond undue limits.
#### 6.5.1.4 Method of test
##### 6.5.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see clause 4.4.1.
RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see clause 4.8
1) Connect the Measurement device to the BS antenna connector.
2) Set the BS to transmit a signal in accordance to TM1, clause 6.1.1.1, at
manufacturer's declared rated output power, Prated,c.
##### 6.5.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Measure the spectrum of the transmitted signal across a span of 10 MHz,
based on an occupied bandwidth requirement of 5 MHz. The selected resolution
bandwidth (RBW) filter of the analyser shall be 30 kHz or less. The spectrum
shall be measured at 400 or more points across the measurement span.
NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any effect on
the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW power are the same
as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected to have the Rayleigh
distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In any case where the
statistics are not the same, though, the detection mode must be power
responding. There are at least two ways to be power responding. The spectrum
analyser can be set to \"sample\" detection, with its video bandwidth setting
at least three times its RBW setting. Or the analyser may be set to respond to
the average of the power (root-mean-square of the voltage) across the
measurement cell.
2) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel units) of
all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1, the power
outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the total power
outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied percentage)) of P0.
For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005 times P0.
3) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds P1.
4) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from the end of the span to f2 exceeds P1.
5) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
6) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single carrier test models shall apply with no carrier
activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS with separate antenna
connector, the antenna connector not being under test shall be terminated.
#### 6.5.1.5 Test requirements
The occupied bandwidth shall be less than 5 MHz based on a chip rate of 3,84
Mcps
NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test is defined in clause 4.2 and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex F.
### 6.5.2 Out of band emission
Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the channel
bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the
transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This out of band emission limit
is specified in terms of a spectrum emission mask and adjacent channel leakage
power ratio for the transmitter.
#### 6.5.2.1 Spectrum emission mask
##### 6.5.2.1.1 Definitions and applicability
The mask defined in Tables 6.18 to 6.21 below may be mandatory in certain
regions. In other regions this mask may not be applied.
For regions where this clause applies, the requirement shall be met whatever
the type of transmitter considered (single carrier or multi-carrier). In
addition, for a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirements
apply inside any sub-block gap. In addition, for a BS capable of multi-band
operation, the requirements apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter RF Bandwidth gap are
not applicable.
##### 6.5.2.1.2 Minimum Requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 [1] clause 6.6.2.1.
Table 6.14: (void)
Table 6.15: (void)
Table 6.16: (void)
Table 6.17: (void)
##### 6.5.2.1.3 Test purpose
This test measures the emissions of the BS, close to the assigned channel
bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.
##### 6.5.2.1.4 Method of test
###### 6.5.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see clause 4.4.1.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see clause 4.8
Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier: B~RFBW~,
M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single band operation; B~RFBW~_T'~RFBW~ and
B'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation; see subclause 4.8.1.
1) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex B.\ As a general rule, the
resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to the
measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity,
efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over
the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of
the measurement bandwidth.
2) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 2,515
MHz and 4.0 MHz shall use a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth.
3) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between 4.0
MHz and (f_offset~max~ - 500 kHz).shall use a 1 MHz measurement bandwidth.
4) Detection mode: True RMS.
##### 6.5.2.1.4.2 Procedures
1) For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set the
base station to transmit a signal according to TM1, clause 6.1.1.1, at
manufacturer's declared rated output power, Prated,c.
> For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set the base
> station to transmit according to TM1 on all carriers configured using the
> applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in
> sub-clause 4.12.
2) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and
measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges with the specified
measurement bandwidth. For BS operating in multiple bands or non-contiguous
spectrum, the emission within the Inter RF Bandwidth or sub-block gap shall be
measured using the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest RF
Bandwidth or sub block edge.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
3) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of single-band or multi-band test shall be terminated.
##### 6.5.2.1.5 Test requirements
The measurement results in step 2 of 6.5.2.1.4.2 shall not exceed the test
requirements specified in tables 6.18 to 6.21 for the appropriate BS maximum
output power, where:
\- ∆f is the separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal -3 dB
point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the carrier frequency and the centre of
the measurement filter;
\- f_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band edge as
defined in clause 3.4.1, whichever is the greater.
\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

###### 6.5.2.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Measure Adjacent channel leakage power ratio for 5 MHz and 10 MHz offsets
both side of channel frequency. In multiple carrier case only offset
frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier frequency used
shall be measured.
2) For the ACLR requirement applied inside sub-block gap for non-contiguous
spectrum operation or inside Inter RF Bandwidth gap for multi-band operation:
a) Measure ACLR inside sub-block gap or Inter RF Bandwidth gap as specified in
clause 6. 5.2.2.5, if applicable.
b) Measure Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) inside sub-
block gap or Inter RF Bandwidth gap as specified in clause 6. 5.2.2.6, if
applicable.
> In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
>
> 3) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above
> per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
> shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band
> capable BS with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being
> under test in case of single-band or multi-band test shall be terminated.

2) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed the
specified value.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
3) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test in
case of single-band or multi-band test shall be terminated.

##### 6.5.3.7.4 Co-existence with other systems in the same geographical area
These requirements may be applied for the protection of UE, MS and/or BS
operating in other frequency bands in the same geographical area. The
requirements may apply in geographic areas in which both a UTRA FDD BS and a
system operating in another frequency band than the FDD operating band are
deployed. The system operating in the other frequency band may be GSM, DCS,
PCS, CDMA, E-UTRA and/or UTRA.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table 6.38
for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the
first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and
conditions in the Note column of Table 6.38 apply for each supported operating
band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note
column of Table 6.38 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna
connector.

## 6.6 Transmitter intermodulation
### 6.6.1 Definition and applicability
The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of
the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter via the antenna.
The transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the intermodulation
products when a WCDMA interfering signal is injected into an antenna connector
at a power level of 30 dB lower than the rated total output power in the
operating band.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply regardless of
the interfering signals position relative to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
For multi-carrier operation, the interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the lower/upper edge of the wanted signal or edge of sub-block inside a
gap.
The interfering signal frequency offset shall be as in Table 6.48.
Table 6.48 Interfering signal frequency offset
+---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ | Parameter | Value | +---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ | Interfering signal centre frequency offset from the | -5 MHz | | wanted signal centre frequency | | | | -10 MHz | | | | | | -15 MHz | | | | | | +5 MHz | | | | | | +10 MHz | | | | | | +15 MHz | +---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ | Interfering signal centre frequency offset from the | -2.5 MHz | | lower/upper edge of the wanted signal or edge of | | | sub-block inside a gap | -7.5 MHz | | | | | | -12.5 MHz | | | | | | +2.5 MHz | | | | | | +7.5 MHz | | | | | | +12.5 MHz | +---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+ | NOTE 1: Interfering signal frequencies that are outside | | | of any allocated frequency band for UTRA-FDD downlink | | | specified in clause 3.4.1 are excluded from the | | | requirement, unless the interfering signal positions | | | fall within the frequency range of adjacent downlink | | | operating bands in the same geographical area. | | | | | | NOTE 2: In certain regions, NOTE 1 is not applied in | | | Band I, III, VI, VIII, IX, XI, XIX, XXI, and XXXII | | | operating within 1475.9-1495.9MHz. | | +---------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
### 6.6.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 [1] clause 6.7.
### 6.6.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS transmitter to restrict
the generation of intermodulation products in its non linear elements caused

#### 6.6.4.2 Procedures
1) For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set the
base station to transmit a signal according to TM1, clause 6.1.1.1 at
manufacturer's declared rated output power, Prated,c.
> For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set the base
> station to transmit according to TM1 on all carriers configured using the
> applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in
> sub-clause 4.12.
2) Generate the interfering signal in accordance to TM1, clause 6.1.1.1 with a
frequency offset of according to the conditions of Table 6.48 but exclude
interfering signal frequencies that are outside of the allocated downlink
operating band or interfering signal frequencies that are not completely
within the sub-block gap or within the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.
3) Adjust ATT1 so the level of the WCDMA interfering signal is as defined in
clause 6.6.5.
4) Perform the out of band emission test as specified in clause 6.5.2, for all
third and fifth order intermodulation products which appear in the frequency
ranges defined in clause 6.5.2. The width of the intermodulation products
shall be taken into account.
5) Perform the spurious emission test as specified in clause 6.5.3, for all
third and fifth order intermodulation products which appear in the frequency
ranges defined in clause 6.5.3. The width of the intermodulation products
shall be taken into account.
6) Verify that the emission level does not exceed the required level with the
exception of interfering signal frequencies.
7) Repeat the test for the remaining interfering signal centre frequency
offsets according to the conditions of Table 6.48.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall apply:
8) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps above per
involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under test
shall be terminated.
NOTE: The third order intermodulation products are (F1±2F2) and (2F1±F2), the
fifth order intermodulation products are (2F1±3F2), (3F1±2F2), (4F1±F2), and
(F1±4F2), where F1 represents the wanted signal centre frequenyc or centre
frequency of each sub-block and F2 represents the interfering signal centre
frequency. The widths of intermodulation products are
● (n*BW~F1~ + m*5MHz) for the nF1±mF2 products
● (n*5MHz + m* BW~F1~) for the nF2±mF1 products
where BW~F1~ represents the wanted signal RF bandwidth, or channel bandwidth
in case of single carrier, or sub-block bandwidth.
### 6.6.5 Test Requirements
In the frequency range relevant for this test, the transmit intermodulation
level shall not exceed the out of band emission or the spurious emission
requirements of clauses 6.5.2 and 6.5.3 in the presence of a WCDMA interfering
signal with a power level 30 dB below the rated total output power in the
operating band.
For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement is also
applicable inside a sub-block gap for interfering signal offsets where the
interfering signal falls completely within the sub-block gap. The interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement is also applicable
inside an Inter RF Bandwidth gap for interfering signal offsets where the
interfering signal falls completely within the Inter RF Bandwidth gap. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges.
The measurements for out of band emission or spurious emission requirement due
to intermodulation can be limited to the frequency ranges of all third and
fifth order intermodulation products, considering the width of these products
and excluding the bandwidths of the wanted and interfering signals.
NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance for
this test is defined in clause 4.2 and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex F.

modified by selecting the frequency, absolute phase, absolute amplitude and
chip clock timing so as to minimise the error vector. The EVM result is
defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the
mean reference power expressed as a %. The measurement interval is one
timeslot as defined by the C-PICH (when present) otherwise the measurement
interval is one timeslot starting with the beginning of the SCH. [

# 7 Receiver characteristics
## 7.1 General
The requirements in clause 7 are expressed for a single receiver antenna
connector. For receivers with antenna diversity, the requirements apply for
each receiver antenna connector.
Unless otherwise stated, all tests in this clause shall be performed at the BS
antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus such
as a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used, the
tests according to clauses 4.6.2 and/or 4.6.4, depending on the device added,
shall be performed to ensure that the requirements are met at test port B.
Figure 7.1: Receiver test ports
For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative offsets of
the interfering signal apply relative to the assigned channel frequency of the
lowest carrier frequency used and positive offsets of the interfering signal
apply relative to the assigned channel frequency of the highest carrier
frequency used.
The BER requirements defined for the receiver characteristics in this clause
do not assume HARQ transmissions.
When the BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the BER
requirements are applicable for each received carrier.
A BS supporting DC-HSUPA receives two cells simultaneously on adjacent carrier
frequencies.
A BS supporting DB-DC-HSUPA receives two cells simultaneously in different
operating bands.
In all the relevant clauses in this clause all Bit Error Ratio (BER), Residual
BER (RBER) and Block Error Ratio (BLER) measurements shall be carried out
according to the general rules for statistical testing defined in ITU-T
Recommendation O.153 [5] and Annex C.
If external BER measurement is not used then the internal BER calculation
shall be used instead. When internal BER calculation is used, the requirements
of the verification test according to 7.8 shall be met in advance.
In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may be
provided, from the base station to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

signal power applied to the BS antenna connector . For duplex operation , the
measurement configuration principle is indicated for one duplex branch in
Figure B.7. For internal BER calculation an example of the test connection is
as shown in figure B.7. The reference point for signal power is at the input
of the receiver (antenna connector).

supporting multi-carrier operation the BER shall be measured for all relevant
carriers specified by the test configuration.
### 7.5.5 Test Requirements
For each measured carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the parameters
specified in table 7.4K to 7.4V if applicable for the BS under test.
The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or Maximum
Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
lower/upper Base Station RF Bandwith edges or Maximum Radio Bandwidth edges.
For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band, the
blocking requirement applies in addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the
sub-block gap size is at least 15MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the lower/upper sub-block edge inside the sub-block gap and is
equal to -7.5MHz/+7.5MHz, respectively.
For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band, the
narrowband blocking requirements in Tables 7.4R-7.4T apply in addition inside
any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least 400kHz or
600kHz, depending on the operating band. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the lower/upper sub-block edge inside the sub-block gap
and is equal to -200kHz/+200kHz or -300kHz/+300kHz, respectively.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the in-band
blocking frequency range applies for each supported operating band. The
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the
Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least 15MHz. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to lower/upper Base Station RF bandwidth edges inside the
Inter RF Bandwidth gap and is equal to -7.5MHz/+7.5MHz, respectively.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the out-of-band
blocking frequency ranges apply for each operating band, with the exception
that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported operating bands
according to Tables 7.4K - 7.4M shall be excluded from the out-of-band
blocking requirement.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the narrowband blocking requirement
applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap size is at least 400kHz or 600kHz, depending on the operating
band. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to lower/upper Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap and is equal to
-200kHz/+200kHz or -300kHz/+300kHz, respectively.

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two or more
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal.

frequency offsets as specified in Tables 7.5A(a) and 7.5A(b). Note that the
GMSK modulated interfering signal shall have an ACLR of at least 72 dB in
order to eliminate the impact of interference signal adjacent channel leakage
power on the intermodulation characteristics measurement.
3) Adjust the ATT2 and ATT3 to obtain the specified level of interference
signal at the BS input.
4) Measure the BER of the wanted signal. For a BS supporting multi-carrier
operation the BER shall be measured for all relevant carriers specified by the
test configuration.
In addition, for a multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connectors, the
following steps shall apply:
5) For single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band where
single band test configurations shall apply with no carrier activated in the
other band.
The interfering signal shall first be applied on the same port as the wanted
signal. The test shall be repeated with the interfering signal applied on the
other port (if any) mapped to the same receiver as the wanted signal. Any

block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least 6.8MHz. The CW
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower/upper sub-block
edge inside the sub-block gap and is equal to -1MHz/+1MHz, respectively. The
GMSK modulated interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
lower/upper sub-block edge inside the sub-block gap and is equal to
-3.4MHz/+3.4MHz, respectively. The requirement applies separately for both
sub-blocks.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the narrowband intermodulation
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the
Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least 6.8MHz. The CW interfering signal
offset is defined relative to lower/upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edges

## 8.1 General
All Bit Error Ratio (BER) and Block Error ratio (BLER) measurements shall be
carried out according to the general rules for statistical testing defined in
ITU-T Recommendation O.153 [5] and Annex C.
If external BLER measurement is not used then the internal BLER calculation

requirements of the verification test according to 8.6 shall be met in
advance.
Performance requirements are specified for a number of test environments and
multi-path channel classes.
The requirements only apply to those measurement channels that are supported
by the base station. The performance requirements for the high speed train
conditions which scenarios defined in Annex D.4A are optional. For FRC8 in
Annex 9 and Annex 17 the Non E-DPCCH boosting and E-DPCCH boosting requirement
only apply for the option supported by the base station.
Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single cell
only. Performance requirements for a BS supporting DC-HSUPA or DB-DC-HSUPA are
defined in terms of single carrier requirements.
For BS with dual receiver antenna diversity, only the BS performance
requirements with Rx diversity are to be tested, the required E~b~/N~0~ shall
be applied separately at each antenna port.
For BS without receiver antenna diversity, only the BS performance
requirements without Rx diversity are to be tested, the required E~b~/N~0~
shall be applied at the BS Rx antenna port.
In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may be
provided, from the base station to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.
For tests in clause 8 the transmitter may be off.
## 8.2 Demodulation in static propagation conditions
### 8.2.1 Demodulation of DCH
#### 8.2.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of DCH in static propagation conditions is
determined by the maximum Block Error Ratio (BLER ) allowed when the receiver
input signal is at a specified E~b~/N~0~ limit. The BLER is calculated for
each of the measurement channels supported by the base station.

## 8.13 Performance of signalling detection for E-DPCCH in multipath fading
conditions
The performance requirement of E-DPCCH signalling detection is determined by
the two parameters: the probability of false detection of codeword; P(DTX ->
codeword) and the probability of missed detection of codeword; P(codeword ->
DTX).

### 8.13.1 E-DPCCH false alarm in multipath fading conditions
#### 8.13.1.1 Definition and applicability
E-DPCCH false alarm is defined as a conditional probability of detection of
codeword when input is only DPCCH (+interference). The E-DPDCH and E-DPCCH is
turned off. The performance requirement of E-DPCCH false alarm in multipath
fading conditions is determined by the maximum detection probability allowed
when the receiver input signal is at a specified E~c~/N~0~ limit. E-DPCCH
false alarm: P(DTX -> codeword) shall be 10^-2^ or less.
Only tests in Pedestrian A shall be applied to Home BS.
#### 8.13.1.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 [1] clause 8.12.

## C.1.6 Good balance between test time and statistical significance
Three independent test parameters are introduced into the test and shown in
Table C.1. These are the obvious basis of test time and statistical
significance. From the first two of them four dependent test parameters are
derived. The third independent test parameter is justified separately.

The minimum test time is derived from the following justification:
1) For no propagation conditions and static propagation condition
No early fail calculated from fractional number of errors \345.
A typical BER BLER test, calculated form the number of samples and errors
(C.1.2.(b)) using experimental method (1) or (2) (see C.1.4.2 calculation
assumptions) runs along the yellow trajectory. With an errorless sample the
trajectory goes down vertically. With an erroneous sample it jumps up right.
The tester checks if the BER BLER test intersects the early fail or early pass
limits. The real time processing can be reduced by the following actions:
BLER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test (Note
1)). is calculated only in case of an error event.
BER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test (Note 1)).
is calculated only in case of an error event within a TTI.
So the early fail limit cannot be missed by errorless samples.
The check against the early pass limit may be done by transforming formula (2)
in C.1.5 such that the tester checks against a
[L]{.underline}imit-[N]{.underline}umber-of-samples ( NL(ne)) depending on the
current number of errors (including the artificial error at the beginning of
the test (Note 1)).
Early pass if
$\text{NL}(\text{ne}) \geq \frac{\text{qchisq}(1 - D,2 \ast \text{ne})}{2 \ast
\text{TR} \ast M}$
TR: test requirement (0.001)
Figure C.1.9
NOTE 1: At the beginning of the test, an artificial error is introduced. This
ensures that an ideal DUT meets the valid range of the early pass limit. In
addition this ensures that the complementary experiment (C.1.4.2 bullet point
(2)) is applicable as well.\ For the check against the early fail limit the
artificial erroneous sample, introduced at the beginning of the test , is
disregarded.\ Due to the nature of the test, namely discrete error events, the
early fail condition shall not be valid, when fractional errors \1/2
exhibits limited selectivity. The Bad DUT factor ≠ 1 is a measure of limited
selectivity.
Data throughput in a communication system is of statistical nature and must be
measured and decided pass or fail. The specified limit of throughput related
to the ideal throughput in different throughput tests is in the range of a few
% to near 100%. To make it comparable with BER, we define the complement of
the relative throughput: BLER as defined above. Complementary this is in the
range of near 100% down to a few % For e.g. BLER = 1%, the currently in BER
BLER used Bad DUT factor M=1.5 is highly meaningful. For e.g. BLER = 99%, the
currently used M=1.5 is obviously meaningless.
An appropriate definition of the bad DUT factor is illustrated in figure
C.2.3: constant and variable Bad DUT factor.
It illustrates how to find the Bad BLER when the nominal BLER is given.
1) In the range 0%\10% the Bad DUT factor is constant 1.5
2) In the range 90%\100% it decreases to 1. (symmetrical to (1))
3) The range in between is interpolated by an arc section.
The example shows: nominal BLER=35,6%  bad BLER=47.67.5%  M=1.34

The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance are 2
non fading propagation channels (scenario 1 and 3) and 1 fading propagation
channel (scenario 2) with one tap. For BS with Rx diversity defined in
scenario 1, the Doppler shift variation is the same between antennas.
For scenario 1 and 3, Doppler shift is given by
$f_{s}\left( t \right) = f_{d}\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right)$ (D.2)
where $f_{s}\left( t \right)$ is the Doppler shift and $f_{d}$ is the maximum
Doppler frequency. The cosine of angle $\theta\left( t \right)$is given by
$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{D_{s}/2 -
\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( D_{s}/2 - \text{vt}
\right)^{2}}}$, $0 \leq t \leq D_{s}/v$ (D.3)
$\text{cos}\theta\left( t \right) = \frac{- 1\text{.}5D_{s} +
\text{vt}}{\sqrt{D_{\text{min}^{2}} + \left( - 1\text{.}5D_{s} + \text{vt}
\right)^{2}}}$, $D_{s}/v  2D_{s}/v$ (D.5)
where $D_{s}/2$ is the initial distance of the train from BS, and
$D_{\text{min}}$ is BS-Railway track distance, both in meters; $v$ is the
velocity of the train in m/s, $t$ is time in seconds.
For scenario 2, Rician fading is considered where Rician factor, _K_ is
defined as the ratio between the dominant signal power and the variant of the
other weaker signals.
Doppler shift and cosine angle is given by equation D.2 and D.3-D.5
respectively, where the required input parameters listed in table D.2A and the
resulting Doppler shift shown in Figure D.3 and D.4 are applied for all
frequency bands.

###### ## Annex E (normative): Global In-Channel TX-Test
# E.1 General
The global in-channel Tx test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of the Tx
under test in a single measurement process. The parameters describing the in-
channel quality of a transmitter, however, are not necessarily independent.
The algorithm chosen for description inside this annex places particular
emphasis on the exclusion of all interdependencies among the parameters. Any
other algorithm (e.g. having better computational efficiency) may be applied,
as long as the results are the same within the acceptable uncertainty of the
test system as defined in clause 4.1
# E.2 Definition of the process
## E.2.1 Basic principle
The process is based on the comparison of the actual **output signal of the TX
under test** , received by an ideal receiver, with a **reference signal** ,
that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal error
free received signal. The reference signal shall be composed of the same
number of codes at the correct spreading factors as contained In the test
signal. Note, for simplification, the notation below assumes only codes of one
spreading factor although the algorithm is valid for signals containing
multiple spreading factors. All signals are represented as equivalent
(generally complex) baseband signals.
## E.2.2 Output signal of the TX under test
The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring equipment,
filtered by a matched filter (RRC 0.22, correct in shape and in position on
the frequency axis) and stored for further processing
The following form represents the physical signa l in the entire measurement
interval:
one vector **Z** , containing N = ns x sf complex samples;
with
ns: [n]{.underline}umber of [s]{.underline}ymbols in the measurement interval;
sf: number of chips per symbol. (sf: [s]{.underline}preading
[f]{.underline}actor) (see Note: Symbol length)
## E.2.3 Reference signal
The reference signal is constructed by the measuring equipment according to
the relevant TX specifications.
It is filtered by the same matched filter, mentioned in E.2.2., and stored at
the Inter-Symbol-Interference free instants. The following form represents the
reference signal in the entire measurement interval:
one vector **R** , containing N = ns x sf complex samples
where
ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval;
sf: number of chips per symbol. (see Note: Symbol length)
## E.2.4 Classification of measurement results
The measurement results achieved by the global in-channel TX test can be
classified into two types:
\- Results of type \"deviation\", where the error-free parameter has a non-
zero magnitude. (These are the parameters that quantify the integral physical
characteristic of the signal).These parameters are:
RF Frequency
Power (in case of single code)
Code Domain Power (in case of multi code)
Timing (only for UE) (see Note: Deviation)
(Additional parameters: see Note: Deviation)
\- Results of type \"residual\", where the error-free parameter has value
zero. (These are the parameters that quantify the error values of the measured
signal, whose ideal magnitude is zero). These parameters are:
Error Vector Magnitude (EVM);
Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE).
(Additional parameters: see Note: Residual)
## E.2.5 Process definition to achieve results of type \"deviation\"
The reference signal (**R** ; see clause E.2.3) and the signal under Test (Z;
see clause E.2.2) are varied with respect to the parameters mentioned in
clause E.2.4 under \"results of type deviation\" in order to achieve best fit.
Best fit is achieved when the RMS difference value between the varied signal
under test and the varied reference signal is an absolute minimum.
Overview:
$\text{FCT}\lbrack
Z(\overset{\sim}{f},\overset{\sim}{t},\overset{\sim}{\phi},g_{1},g_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},g_{\text{synch}})
-
R(f,t,\phi,{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{1},{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{synch}})\rbrack
= \text{Minimum}!$
Z : Signal under test.
R: Reference signal,
with frequency f, the timing t, the phase ϕ, gain of code1 (g~1~), gain of
code2 (g~2~) etc, and the gain of the synch channel g~synch~ See Note: Power
Step
The parameters marked with a tilde in Z and R are varied in order to achieve a
best fit.
For most measurement results the best fit process is to be carried out over
the whole measurement interval corresponding to the duration of one slot, i.e.
ns * sf = 2560 chips in E.2.2 and E.2.3. Some measurements are, however,
defined for a measurement interval corresponding to the duration of one frame,
i.e. ns * sf = 38400 chips. In this latter case, the best fit with respect to
**Z** and **R** is to be carried out successively over multiple best fit
intervals (segments) corresponding to the duration of one slot each, i.e. 15
times for a measurement interval corresponding to the duration of one frame.
Detailed formula: see Note: Formula for the minimum process
The varied reference signal, after the best fit process, will be called
**R'.**
The varied signal under test, after the best fit process, will be called
**Z'.**
**R'** and **Z'** are each of length ns * sf and depending on the length of
the measurement interval result of possibly multiple successive applications
of the minimum process.
The varying parameters, leading to **R' and Z** represent directly the wanted
results of type \"deviation\". These measurement parameters are expressed as
deviation from the reference value with the same units as the reference value.
In the case of multi code, the type-\"deviation\"-parameters (frequency,
timing and (RF-phase)) are varied commonly for all codes such that the process
returns one frequency-deviation, one timing deviation, (one RF-phase
-deviation).
(These parameters are [not]{.underline} varied on the individual code signals
such that the process would return kr frequency errors... . (kr: number of
codes)).
The only type-\"deviation\"-parameters varied individually are the code domain
gain factors (g1, g2, ...)
See Note: Power Step.
### E.2.5.1 Decision Point Power
The mean-square value of the signal-under-test, sampled at the best estimate
of the of Intersymbol-Interference-free points using the process defined in
clause 2.5, is referred to the _Decision Point Power_ (DPP):
### E.2.5.2 Code-Domain Power
The samples, Z', are separated into symbol intervals to create ns time-
sequential vectors **z** with sf complex samples comprising one symbol
interval. The _Code Domain Power_ is calculated according to the following
steps:
1) Take the vectors **z** defined above.
2) To achieve meaningful results it is necessary to descramble **z,** leading
to **z'** (see Note: Scrambling code)
3) Take the orthogonal vectors of the channelization code set **C** (all codes
belonging to one spreading factor) as defined in TS 25.213 and TS 25.223
(range +1, -1), and normalize by the norm of the vectors to produce **C**
norm=**C** /sqrt(sf). (see Note: Symbol length)
4) Calculate the inner product of **z'** with **C** norm**.**. Do this for all
symbols of the measurement interval and for all codes in the code space.\ This
gives an array of format k x ns, each value representing a specific symbol and
a specific code, which can be exploited in a variety of ways.
k: total number of codes in the code space
ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval
5) Calculate k mean-square values, each mean-square value unifying ns symbols
within one code.\ (These values can be called \"_Absolute CodeDomainPower_
(CDP)\" [Volt^2^].) The sum of the k values of CDP is equal to DPP.
6) Normalize by the decision point power to obtain
## E.2.6 Process definition to achieve results of type \"residual\"
The difference between the varied reference signal (**R'** ; see clauseE.2.5.)
and the varied TX signal under test (**Z'** ; see clauseE.2.5) is the error
vector **E** versus time:
**E** = **Z'** \- **R'**
Depending on the parameter to be evaluated, it is appropriate to represent
**E** in one of the following two different forms:
[Form EVM]{.underline} (representing the physical error signal in the entire
measurement interval)
One vector **E** , containing N = ns x sf complex samples;
with
ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval
sf: number of chips per symbol (see Note: Symbol length)
[Form PCDE]{.underline} (derived from Form EVM by separating the samples into
symbol intervals)
ns time-sequential vectors **e** with sf complex samples comprising one symbol
interval.
**E** and **e** give results of type \"residual\" applying the two algorithms
defined in clauses E.2.6.1 and E.2.6.2.
### E.2.6.1 Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)
The Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is calculated according to the following
steps:
1) Take the error vector **E** defined in clause E.2.6 (Form EVM) and
calculate the RMS value of **E** ; the result will be called RMS(**E**).
2) Take the varied reference vector **R'** defined in clause E.2.5 and
calculate the RMS value of **R'** ; the result will be called RMS(**R'**).
3) Calculate EVM according to:
$\text{EVM} = \frac{\text{RMS}(E)}{\text{RMS}(R')}\text{\ x\ 100\%}\frac{}{}$
(here, EVM is relative and expressed in %)
(see Note: Formula for EVM)
### E.2.6.2 Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE)
The Peak Code Domain Error is calculated according to the following steps:
1) Take the error vectors **e** defined in clause E.2.6 (Form PCDE)
2) To achieve meaningful results it is necessary to descramble **e,** leading
to **e'** (see Note: Scrambling code)
3) Take the orthogonal vectors of the channelization code set **C** (all codes
belonging to one spreading factor) as defined in TS 25.213 and TS 25.223
(range +1, -1). (see Note: Symbol length) and normalize by the norm of the
vectors to produce **C** norm= **C** /sqrt(sf). (see Note: Symbol length)
4) Calculate the inner product of **e'** with **Cnorm**. Do this for all
symbols of the measurement interval and for all codes in the code space.\ This
gives an array of format k x ns, each value representing an error-vector
representing a specific symbol and a specific code, which can be exploited in
a variety of ways.
k: total number of codes in the code space
ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval
5) Calculate k RMS values, each RMS value unifying ns symbols within one
code.\ (These values can be called \"_Absolute CodeEVMs_ \" [Volt].)
6) Find the peak value among the k \"_Absolute CodeEVMs_ \".\ (This value can
be called \"_Absolute PeakCodeEVM_ \" [Volt].)
7) Calculate PCDE according to:
$\text{10} \ast \text{lg}\frac{(\text{\ ital\ }\text{Absolute}\text{\ ital\
}\text{PeakCodeEVM})^{2}}{(\text{RMS}(R'))^{2}}\text{dB}$ (a relative value in
dB).
(see Note IQ)
(see Note Synch channel)
### E.2.6.3 Relative Code Domain Error (RCDE)
The Relative Code Domain Error is calculated for a wanted code according to
the following steps:
1) Calculate the value \"_Absolute CodeEVM_ \" [Volt] for the wanted code
according to E.2.6.2, as an RMS value unifying ns = 2400 symbols corresponding
to the measurement interval of 1 frame.
2) Calculate the value \"_Absolute CodeDomainPower_ (CDP)\" [Volt^2^] for the
wanted code according to E.2.5.2, with ns = 2400 symbols corresponding to the
measurement interval of 1 frame.
3) Calculate RCDE according to:
4) The average RCDE across a set of wanted codes is defined as the mean of the
linear RCDE values and subsequently expressed in dB.
# E.3 Notes
## E.3.1 Symbol length
A general code multiplexed signal is multicode and multirate. In order to
avoid unnecessary complexity, the measurement applications use a unique
symbol-length, corresponding to a spreading factor, regardless of the really
intended spreading factor. Nevertheless the complexity with a multicode /
multirate signal can be mastered by introducing appropriate definitions.
## E.3.2 Deviation
It is conceivable to regard more parameters as type \"deviation\" e.g. Chip
frequency and RF-phase.
As chip-frequency and RF-frequency are linked together by a statement in the
core specifications [1] it is sufficient to process RF frequency only.
A parameter RF-phase must be varied within the best fit process (E.2.5.).
Although necessary, this parameter-variation doesn't describe any error, as
the modulation schemes used in the system don't depend on an absolute RF-
phase.
The parameter Timing must be varied within the best fit process (E.2.5.) This
parameter variation does not describe any error, when applied to the Node B
test. However when applied to the UE test, it describes the error of the UE's
Timing Advance.
## E.3.3 Residual
It is conceivable to regard more parameters as type „residual\" e.g. IQ origin
offset. As it is not the intention of the test to separate for different error
sources, but to quantify the quality of the signal, all such parameters are
not extracted by the best fit process, instead remain part of EVM and PCDE.
## E.3.4 Scrambling Code
In general a signal under test can use more than one scrambling code. Note
that PCDE is primarily processed to investigate the unused channelization
codes. In order to know which scrambling code shall be applied on unused
channelization codes, it is necessary to restrict the test conditions: The
signal under test shall use exactly one scrambling code.
## E.3.5 IQ
As in FDD/uplink each channelization code can be used twice, on the I and on
the Q channel, the measurement result may indicate separate values of CDP or
PCDE for I and Q on which channel (I or Q) they occur.
## E.3.6 Synch Channel
A Node B signal contains a physical synch channel, which is non orthogonal,
related to the other channels. In this context note: The code channel bearing
the result of PCDE is exactly one of the other physical channels (never the
synch channel). The origin of PCDE (erroneous code power) can be any channel
(including synch channel) This means that the error due to the synch channel
is projected onto the other (orthogonal) codes that make up the code domain.
## E.3.7 Formula for the minimum process
$L(\Delta\overset{\sim}{f},\Delta\overset{\sim}{t},\Delta\overset{\sim}{\phi},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{c},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}},\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}})
= \sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{|Z(\nu) - R(\nu)}|^{2}$
where:
L : the function to be minimised
The parameters to be varied in order to minimize are:
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{f}$ the RF frequency offset
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{t}$ the timing offset
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{\phi}$ the phase offset
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{c}\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}$ code power offsets
(one offset for each code)
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}}$ the code power offset of the primary
SCH
$\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}}$ the code power offset of the
secondary SCH
Z(ν) Samples of the signal under Test
R(ν) Samples of the reference signal
$\sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{}$ counting index $\nu$starting at the beginning of
the best fit interval and ending at its end.
N No of chips during the best fit interval.
Z(ν): Samples of the signal under Test. It is modelled as a sequence of
complex baseband samples Z(γ) with a time-shift ∆t, a frequency offset ∆f, a
phase offset ∆ϕ, the latter three with respect to the reference signal.
$Z(\nu) = Z(\nu - \Delta\overset{\sim}{t}) \ast e^{-
j2\text{πΔ}\overset{\sim}{f}\nu} \ast e^{- \text{jΔ}\overset{\sim}{\phi}}$
R(ν) Samples of the reference signal:
$\text{codes} + (g_{\text{prim}} + \Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{prim}})
\ast \text{Chip}_{\text{prim}}(\nu) + (g_{\text{sec}} +
\Delta{\overset{\sim}{g}}_{\text{sec}}) \ast \text{Chip}_{\text{sec}}(\nu)$
where
g nominal gain of the code channel
$\Delta\overset{\sim}{g}$ The gain offset to be varied in the minimum process
Chip(ν) is the chipsequence of the code channel
Indices at g, Δg and Chip: The index indicates the code channel: c = 1,2,...
No of code channels
prim= primary SCH
sec= secondary SCH
Range for Chip~c~ : +1,-1
## E.3.8 Power Step
If the measurement period for any code contains a power step due to power
control, it is necessary to model the reference signal for that code using two
gain factors.
## E.3.9 Formula for EVM
$\text{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{|Z^{'}(\gamma) -
R^{'}(\gamma)}|^{2}}{\sum_{\nu = 0}^{N - 1}{|R^{'}(\gamma)}|^{2}}} \ast
\text{100}\text{\%}$
Z'(γ), R'(γ) are the varied measured and reference signals.
###### ## Annex F (informative): Derivation of Test Requirements
The Test Requirements in this specification have been calculated by relaxing
the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the Test Tolerances
defined in clause 4.2. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the Test Requirement
will be the same as the Minimum Requirement. When the Test Tolerance is non-
zero, the Test Requirements will differ from the Minimum Requirements, and the
formula used for this relaxation is given in tables F.1, F.2 and F.3
Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case that
the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4.1. In
this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined test
tolerance in order to generate the correct tightened Test Requirements as
defined in clause 4.3.
For example, a Test System having 0.9 dB accuracy for test 6.2.1 Base Station
maximum output power (which is 0.2 dB above the limit specified in clause 4.)
would subtract 0.2 dB from the Test Tolerance of 0.7 dB defined in clause 4.2.
This new test tolerance of 0.5 dB would then be applied to the Minimum
Requirement using the formula defined in Table F.1 to give a new range of ±2.5
dB of the manufacturer\'s rated output power.
Using this same approach for the case where a test had a test tolerance of 0
dB, an excess error of 0.2 dB would result in a modified test tolerance of
-0.2 dB.

###### ## Annex G (informative): Acceptable uncertainty of Test Equipment
This informative annex specifies the critical parameters of the components of
an overall Test System (e.g. Signal generators, Signal Analysers etc.) which
are necessary when assembling a Test System which complies with clause 4.1
Acceptable Uncertainty of Test System. These Test Equipment parameters are
fundamental to the accuracy of the overall Test System and are unlikely to be
improved upon through System Calibration.

###### ## Annex H (Informative): UTRAN Measurement Test Cases
# H.1 Purpose of Annex
This Annex specifies test specific parameters for some of the UTRAN
requirements in chapter 9.2 TS 25.133. The tests provide additional
information to how the requirements should be tested. Some requirements may
lack a test.
Unless explicitly stated:
\- Measurement channel is 12.2 kbps as defined in TS 25.104 annex A, sub-
clause A.2 for UL measurements
\- Test models defined in TS 25.141 sub-clause 6.1 are used for DL
measurements
# H.2 Received Total Wideband Power
## H.2.1 Absolute RTWP measurement
1\. Terminate the BS RX inputs, measure the RTWP and record it.
2\. Attach a signal generator to the RX input connector and increase the power
until the BS reported RTWP value (Irep) has increased 3 dB.
3\. Measure the signal power level delivered from the signal generator. This
signal level is now called the \"Internally generated noise\" (Ni).
4\. Sweep the signal generator power such that the sum of internally generated
noise (Ni) and signal generator power (I) is swept through the defined
conditions range.
5\. Check that: \|(Ni+I)-Irep\| meets the accuracy requirements specified in
chapter 9.2.1.1
Note that Iob= (Ni+I)
## H.2.2 Relative RTWP measurement
1\. Terminate the BS RX inputs, measure the RTWP and record it.
2\. Attach a signal generator to the RX input connector and increase the power
until the BS reported RTWP value (Irep) has increased 3 dB.
3\. Measure the signal power level delivered from the signal generator. This
signal level is now called the \"Internally generated noise\" (Ni).
4\. Sweep the signal generator power such that the sum of internally generated
noise (Ni) and signal generator power (I) is swept through the defined
conditions range.
5\. The difference between the reported RTWP values shall meet the accuracy
requirements specified in chapter 9.2.1.2.
Note that Iob= (Ni+I)
# H.3 Transmitted code power
1\. Generate the wanted signal in accordance to test model 2, clause 6.1.1.2.
Set power of the DPCH under test to the Pmax,c-3 dB level. Power levels for
other code channels shall be adjusted as necessary.
2\. Measure the output power on code channel under test, Pout,code, at the
antenna connector. Record the transmitted code power reported in the BS,
Pcode.
3\. Check that Pout,code meets the absolute accuracy requirement in TS 25.133
chapter 9.2.5.1. If STTD or closed loop transmit diversity is supported by the
BS, the transmitted code power for each branch are measured, summed together
and reported to higher layers. In case of TX diversity or MIMO transmission
both branches need to be measured and summed together in order to find out the
wanted value. The absolute accuracy of Pcode can be accepted if Pout,code will
fullfill the following conditions:
Pcode-3.9 dB ≤ Pout,code ≤ Pcode + 3.9 dB, f ≤ 3.0 GHz;
Pcode-4.2 dB ≤ Pout,code ≤ Pcode + 4.2 dB, 3.0 GHz \< f ≤ 4.2 GHz
4\. Check that the relative accuracy requirement for Pcode in TS 25.133
chapter 9.2.5.2 is met. Set Pcode1 and Pcode2 to transmit with the same power
level. The relative accuracy between Pcode1 and Pcode2 can be accepted if the
difference between the measured power of one code channel, Pout,code1 and
another code channel Pout,code 2 will fullfill the following conditions:
 Pout,code1 - Pout,code2  ≤ 2.2 dB.
5\. Set the power of the DPCH under test to the minimum power of the power
control dynamic range and repeat steps 2, 3 and 4.
# H.4 Transmitted carrier power
1) Set the BS to transmit with the maximum transmission power and measure the
output power at the antenna connector, PMTP. Maximum transmission power is the
mean power on one carrier measured at the antenna connector with the code
level settings that according to the base station manufacturer will result in
an output power of nominally the maximum output power in a specified reference
condition. Test model 2, clause 6.1.1.2, when the code powers are set
according to table 6.3. shall be used.
2) Operate the BS in closed loop power control until the output power has
reached a stable state. Measure the output power, Pout, at the antenna
connector and record the transmitted carrier power measured and reported in
the BS, Prep. Note that Prep is normalised to the output power measured in
Test Model 2 with all codes at their default levels. If STTD or closed loop
transmit diversity is supported by the BS, only the highest of the transmit
powers is reported to higher layers. In case of TX diversity or MIMO
transmission both branches need to be measured in order to find out which one
is the highest.
3) Check that the Pout meets the requirement in TS 25.133 chapter 9.2.4.1,
with the same test equipment accuracy as in chapter 6.4.4. in TS 25.141. Prep
can be accepted if Pout will fullfill the following conditions:
$\text{PMTP} + \text{10}\text{log}\left( \frac{\text{Pr}\text{ep} -
5}{\text{100}} \right) - 0\text{.}3 \leq \text{Pout}\text{PMTP} +
\text{10}\text{log}\left( \frac{\text{Pr}\text{ep} + 5}{\text{100}} \right) +
0\text{.}3$ [ dBm]
4) Repeat step 2 and 3 over the 5%-95% range of the Prep. Use first the
standard code powers of test model 2 to verify the Prep range from 50% to 95%.
After that put the other dedicated channels off and reduce the powers of the
control codes in order to be able to verify the Prep range from 5% to 50%.
NOTE: Pout shall be tested immediately after PMTP in order to avoid the
influence of long term stability variation to measurement results.
###### ## Annex I (normative): Characteristics of the W-CDMA interference
signal
The W-CDMA interference signal shall be a DPCH containing the DPCCH and one
DPDCH. The data content for each channelization code shall be uncorrelated
with each other and to the wanted signal and spread and modulated according to
clause 4 of TS25.213 [14]. Further characteristics of DPDCH and DPCCH are
specified in table I.1.
