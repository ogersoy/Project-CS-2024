IOPS Isolated E-UTRAN Operation for Public Safety
SDS Short Data Service
# 4 Overview
MCData defines a service for Mission Critical Data services. As well as voice
services, current mission critical users have been increasing their use of
data services, including low throughput services on legacy networks and data
services on commercial networks. This need will continue to grow with the
creation of the new multimedia services. The MCData service needs to provide a
means to manage all data connections of mission critical users in the field
and provide relevant resources to the ones who need it. For example mission
critical users already use event manager software along with the voice system.
The migration to LTE networks will allow mission critical users to operate
current and new data services whilst relying on the fundamental capabilities
of mission critical communication such as defined for MCPTT in [4] and
included into MCCoRe [3].
The MCData Service provides a set of communication services that will be
directly used by the user or functions that will be called by external
applications in control rooms.
The MCData Service will reuse functions including end-to-end encryption, key
management, authentication of the sender, etc. defined in [3] in order to
provide group communications for data services. As for all mission critical
services, users affiliate to groups in order to receive communications
directed to the group.
In addition, the MCData Service will provide a set of generic capabilities
such as: messaging, file distribution, data streaming, IP proxy, etc. Also,
the MCData Service will provide specific services such as conversation
management, data base enquiries, internet access, robots control.
The MCData Service is expected to have open interfaces in the network. It
needs also to provide an opportunity for a variety of multimedia applications
using the MCData Service.
# 5 MCData generic capability requirements common for on-network and off-
network
## 5.1 Introduction
MCData makes frequent use of a set of capabilities and enablers that allows
for many end user services to be built on a common foundation. Several generic
capabilities are defined for use in the MCData Service. These capabilities can
be used on their own to transfer files, messages and other content to
individuals and affiliated members of groups or combined with other services,
through an application, to provide complete end users services as determined
by the authorities implementing the service. The MCData generic capabilities
are common for on-network and off-network.
It is not intended to invent new protocols for the MCData Service. Where
existing protocols are efficient and sufficient, the service should make use
of these protocols.
## 5.2 SDS feature
### 5.2.1 General
The SDS feature of the MCData Service could be considered as a basic protocol
carrying a limited size, but variable content, payload message. This message
could be text or could be marked for extensible purposes including short
binary messages for application communication. Messaging could be one-to-one
messaging or could be group messaging using groups as specified in MCCoRe.

## 5.5 IP connectivity
### 5.5.1 Service description
IP connectivity can be used for MCData applications that are based on the IP
client-server paradigm. The UE can contain a client using a service in the
network (e.g. a police officer accessing a server on the police Intranet from
his mobile phone). The UE can also contain a server that is accessed by other
UEs (e.g. a mobile information display that is controlled by a police officer
from his mobile phone). As an UE for MCData application can be an unmanned
device, or device without user interface, authorization of IP data transport
can be provided remotely by an authorized user for the UE.

#### 6.1.1.1 Service description
A group of people can be involved in different activities in an operational
situation. As a consequence, there is a need to manage different activities
and to easily retrieve data exchanged around one activity. Conversation
management can be seen as an aggregation of related MCData transmissions for a
given activity.
The system will not be able to manage an infinite number of conversations.
Rather than simply limiting the number of conversations and asking users to
send a notification when the conversation ends, it is proposed here to limit
the time of a conversation.

feature for each MCData User.
[R-6.1.1.2-002] The MCData conversation management service shall be available
for group communication as well as for one-to-one communications.
[R-6.1.1.2-003] The MCData Service conversation management feature shall use
the SDS and file distribution generic capabilities.
NOTE: For instance, if SDS and file distribution capability are combined for a
conversation, the two thread indications are assumed to appear in the
conversation as unique.
[R-6.1.1.2-004] A conversation shall be identified through a unique
conversation ID.
[R-6.1.1.2-005] The MCData Service conversation management feature shall
provide an MCData Conversation Hang Time after which the last message/file
shall no longer be correlated to the previous.

##### 6.1.2.1.1 Service description
Robots as defined in 3GPP TS 22.281 [6] will be used more and more to provide
unique services to mission critical organizations. Critical communications
users need, as a consequence, a common communication framework for robots
which can take advantage of different transport technologies such as LTE. The
MCData Service, working in conjunction with existing robot control
capabilities, will provide mechanisms to do that.
The following sub-clause aims at defining requirements to ensure robot control
communication can be provided through LTE.
We expect different manufacturers for robots. As a consequence a well-known
transport framework is needed in order to ensure easy integration of new
robots.

depending on the robots type under
\- 50 ms for an aerial unmanned vehicle;
\- 200 ms for an aquatic or submarine unmanned vehicle; and
\- 400 ms for a terrestrial unmanned vehicle .
NOTE: At this stage of the work, the latency is an end to end latency. The
split between network latency and robot latency is left for stage 2. The
latency is measured between the action of the pilot and the movement of the
robot (not only MCData Service).
[R-6.1.2.1.2-004] The MCData Service shall be able to simultaneously manage
multiple robots and robot types.

[R-6.3.1.2-001] The MCData service shall support Private Communications Off-
Network.
[R-6.3.1.2-002] The MCData service shall provide a mechanism for an MCData
User to cancel an MCData Private Communication prior to the Communication
setup.
[R-6.3.1.2-003] The MCData service shall provide a means by which an
authorized MCData User initiates an MCData Private Communication.
[R-6.3.1.2-004] The MCData service shall provide a means by which an MCData UE
initiates an MCData Private Communication to any MCData User for which the
MCData UE\'s current MCData User is authorized.
NOTE: For off-network use, only an MCData UE within communication range
(possibly via a ProSe UE-to-UE Relay) receives the transmission.
[R-6.3.1.2-005] The MCData service shall provide a mechanism for an MCData
User to reject an MCData Private Communication.

User ends a Private Communication in which the MCData User is a Participant.
[R-6.3.1.2-007] The MCData service shall provide a mechanism for an MCData
Administrator to configure for a particular authorized MCData User, a set of
MCData Users under the same authority to which an MCData Private Communication
can be made.

### 6.3.2 MCData Transmission Control Off-Network
#### 6.3.2.1 Overview
MCData Transmission Control Off-Network provides a necessary capability for an
authorized user of the MCData service to request to transmit, receive an
indication of being allowed to transmit or not being allowed to transmit and
terminate a request to transmit when the MCData user no longer wants to
transmit. A transmit time limit is provided which allows an MCData
Administrator to configure the limits for any transmission related to a single
request to transmit. MCData Transmission Control Off-Network also provides an
override capability based on a priority hierarchy to override an active MCData
transmission of a transmitting Participant based on configuration. The MCData
Transsmission Control Off-Network capability does not apply to all of the
MCData subservices (SDS, file distribution capability, data streaming
capability, IP connectivity).
#### 6.3.2.2 General Aspects
[R-6.3.2.2-001] The MCData service when operating off-network shall determine
at a point in time which off-network Participant(s) are allowed to transmit to
other off-network Participants.
[R-6.3.2.2-002] An MCData Group shall have the flexibility to be configured to
allow simultaneous transmitting MCData Group Members.
[R-6.3.2.2-003] The MCData service shall provide a mechanism for the MCData
Service Administrator to configure the maximum number of simultaneous
communications received by an off-network MCData User in a single MCData
Group.
#### 6.3.2.3 Requesting Permission to Transmit
[R-6.3.2.3-001] An authorized Participant shall be able to request to transmit
to an MCData Group or an individual MCData User.
[R-6.3.2.3-002] The MCData service shall determine which Participant(s) are
permitted to transmit when there are simultaneous requests for permission to
transmit within the same group.
[R-6.3.2.3-003] Following an MCData request for permission to transmit on the
Selected MCData Group, any Affiliated MCData User that made and was granted
the request shall be given an indication of being allowed to transmit.
[R-6.3.2.3-004] Following an MCData request for permission to transmit on the
Selected MCData Group, any Affiliated MCData User that made and was not
granted the request shall be given an indication that permission to transmit
was not given at that time.
[R-6.3.2.3-005] Following an MCData Private Communication request for
permission to transmit, an MCData User that is allowed to transmit shall be
given an indication that the user is allowed to transmit to the targeted
MCData User(s).
[R-6.3.2.3-006] Following an MCData Private Communication request for
permission to transmit, an MCData User that is not allowed to transmit shall
be given an indication that the permission to transmit was queued or rejected.
[R-6.3.2.3-007] The MCData service when operating off-network shall provide a
mechanism for an MCData Participant to cancel its MCData request to transmit
at any stage, including before the request has been granted.
[R-6.3.2.3-008] The MCData service shall provide a mechanism for the MCData
Administrator to configure parameter(s) relating to the automatic termination
of an off-network MCData service request to transmit.
#### 6.3.2.4 Override
[R-6.3.2.4-001] An MCData UE shall be pre-provisioned by an MCData
Administrator and/or authorized user with the necessary information in order
that override may operate during off-network MCData communication.
[R-6.3.2.4-002] The MCData service shall provide a mechanism for MCData
Administrators to create a priority hierarchy for determining what
Participants, Participant types, and urgent transmission types, when operating
off the network, be granted a request to override an active off-network MCData
transmission.
[R-6.3.2.4-003] The priority hierarchy used for granting a request to override
an active MCData transmission shall contain at least four (4) levels.
[R-6.3.2.4-004] The MCData service shall provide a mechanism for Participants,
to override an active MCData transmission of a transmitting Participant based
on configuration.
[R-6.3.2.4-005] If an MCData transmission is overridden, the MCData Service
shall provide a means of notifying the overridden Participant(s) that the
transmission has been overridden.
[R-6.3.2.4-006] The MCData service shall provide a mechanism to enable an
MCData Administrator to configure which MCData Group transmission(s) a
Participant(s) receives, for cases where an MCData transmission can be
overridden.
[R-6.3.2.4-007] If the MCData Group has been configured to only allow the
overriding transmitting Participant to transmit, the MCData service shall
revoke the transmit permission of the overridden transmitting Participant.
#### 6.3.2.5 Terminating Permission to Transmit
[R-6.3.2.5-001] A transmitting Participant shall be able to indicate to the
off-network MCData service that the Participant no longer wants to transmit.
[R-6.3.2.5-002] The off-network MCData service shall provide an indication to
receiving Participants that the transmitting Participant has finished
transmitting.
#### 6.3.2.6 Transmit Time Limit
[R-6.3.2.6-001] The Off-Network MCData Service shall provide a mechanism for
an MCData UE to be pre-provisioned by an MCData Administrator and/or
authorized user with the necessary information in order that a transmit time
limit function may operate during off-network MCData communication.
[R-6.3.2.6-002] The Off-Network MCData Service shall enable an MCData
Administrator to configure the limits (e.g. elapsed time, quantity of data)
for any transmission related to a single request to transmit.
[R-6.3.2.6-003] The Off-Network MCData Service shall have configurable limits
(e.g. elapsed time, quantity of data), including indefinite, for any
transmission related to a single request to transmit (e.g. elapsed time,
quantity of data).
[R-6.3.2.6-004] The Off-Network MCData Service shall provide an indication to
the transmitting Participant a configurable amount before the transmit limit
is reached.
[R-6.3.2.6-005] The Off-Network MCData Service shall provide an indication to
the transmitting Participant that the Participant\'s transmit limit has been
reached.
[R-6.3.2.6-006] The Off-Network MCData Service shall remove the permission to
transmit from the transmitting Participant when the Participant\'s transmit
limit has been reached.
