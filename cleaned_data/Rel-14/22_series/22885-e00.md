# Introduction
This document covers use cases and potential requirements for LTE support for
vehicular communications services (represented by the term, Vehicle-to-
Everything (V2X) Services). The TR on LTE support for V2X services contains
three types of V2X (V2V (vehicle to vehicle), V2I (vehicle to
infrastructure/network), and V2P (vehicle to pedestrian)) and both safety and
non-safety aspects.
# 1 Scope
The objective of this TR is to identify use cases and associated potential
requirements for LTE support of V2X services taking into account V2X Services
and parameters defined in other SDOs (e.g. GSMA Connected Living, ETSI ITS
(Intelligent Transportation System), US SAE) or related governmental agency
(e.g. C-ITS project in Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport).
The essential use cases for LTE V2X (V2V, V2I, and V2P) to be studied and
requirements identified are as follows;
\- V2V: covering LTE-based communication between vehicles.
\- V2P: covering LTE-based communication between a vehicle and a device
carried by an individual (e.g. handheld terminal carried by a pedestrian,
cyclist, driver or passenger).
\- V2I: covering LTE-based communication between a vehicle and a roadside
unit.
This TR includes safety and non-safety aspects.

# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Types of V2X
The vehicular communication in this TR, referred to as Vehicle-to-Everything
(V2X), contains the following three different types:
\- Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communications
\- Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communications
\- Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) Communications
{width="3.754861111111111in" height="2.422222222222222in"}
Figure 4.1-1: Types of V2X (V2V, V2P, and V2I).
Note: These three types of V2X can use "co-operative awareness" to provide
more intelligent services for end-users. This means that transport entities,
such as vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and pedestrians, can collect
knowledge of their local environment (e.g., information received from other
vehicles or sensor equipment in proximity) to process and share that knowledge
in order to provide more intelligent services, such as cooperative collision
warning or autonomous driving.
Three basic classes of applications for providing ITS services: road safety,
traffic efficiency, and other applications can be found in e.g., [2],[3].
## 4.2 Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)
E-UTRAN allows such UEs that are in proximity of each other to exchange
V2V-related information using E-UTRA(N) when permission, authorisation and
proximity criteria are fulfilled. The proximity criteria can be configured by
the MNO. However, UEs supporting V2V Service can exchange such information
when served by or not served by E-UTRAN which supports V2X Service.
The UE supporting V2V applications transmits application layer information
(e.g. about its location, dynamics, and attributes as part of the V2V
Service). The V2V payload must be flexible in order to accommodate different
information contents, and the information can be transmitted periodically
according to a configuration provided by the MNO.
V2V is predominantly broadcast-based; V2V includes the exchange of V2V-related
application information between distinct UEs directly and/or, due to the
limited direct communication range of V2V, the exchange of V2V-related
application information between distinct UEs via infrastructure supporting V2X
Service, e.g., RSU, application server, etc.
## 4.3 Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
The UE supporting V2I applications sends application layer information to RSU.
RSU sends application layer information to a group of UEs or a UE supporting
V2I applications.
V2N is also introduced where one party is a UE and the other party is a
serving entity, both supporting V2N applications and communicating with each
other via LTE network.
## 4.4 Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P)
E-UTRAN allows such UEs that are in proximity of each other to exchange
V2P-related information using E-UTRAN when permission, authorisation and
proximity criteria are fulfilled. The proximity criteria can be configured by
the MNO. However, UEs supporting V2P Service can exchange such information
even when not served by E-UTRAN which supports V2X Service.
The UE supporting V2P applications transmits application layer information.
Such information can be broadcast by a vehicle with UE supporting V2X Service
(e.g., warning to pedestrian), and/or by a pedestrian with UE supporting V2X
Service (e.g., warning to vehicle).
V2P includes the exchange of V2P-related application information between
distinct UEs (one for vehicle and the other for pedestrian) directly and/or,
due to the limited direct communication range of V2P, the exchange of
V2P-related application information between distinct UEs via infrastructure
supporting V2X Service, e.g., RSU, application server, etc.
# 5 Use Cases
## 5.1 Forward Collision Warning
### 5.1.1 Description
The FCW application is intended to warn the driver of the HV in case of an
impending rear-end collision with a RV ahead in traffic in the same lane and
direction of travel. Using the V2V Service, FCW is intended to help drivers in
avoiding or mitigating rear-end vehicle collisions in the forward path of
travel.
### 5.1.2 Pre-conditions
The RV and HV are supporting V2V Service and can communicate with each other
using the V2V Service.
### 5.1.3 Service Flows
The RV V2X Service layer periodically broadcasts a message, indicating its
current location, speed, acceleration and optional estimated trajectory.
The RV makes an in-lane determination and time-to-collision determination,
which is reflected in the broadcast message.
LTE broadcasts the different messages as requested by the application layer.
The HV receives the RV broadcasted message and determines if actions need to
be taken.
### 5.1.4 Post-conditions
The driver of HV is made alerted that there is an in-path vehicle and can take
corrective actions to avoid or mitigate rear-end vehicle collisions in the
forward path of travel.
### 5.1.5 Potential Requirements

## 5.2 Control Loss Warning
### 5.2.1 Description
The CLW application enables a HV to broadcast a self-generated control loss
event to surrounding RVs. Upon receiving such event information, a RV
determines the relevance of the event and provides a warning to the driver, if
appropriate.
### 5.2.2 Pre-conditions
The RV and HV are supporting V2V Service and can communicate with each other
using the V2V Service.
### 5.2.3 Service Flows
The RV periodically broadcasts a message indicating its current location,
speed, acceleration and optional estimated trajectory.
When the RV self-determines a control loss, possibly coupled with in-lane and
time-to-collision determinations, it transmits this information via broadcast
as an event, making use of the V2V Service.
The HV receives the RV event message and determines if actions need to be
taken.
### 5.2.4 Post-conditions
Driver of HV is alerted that there is an in-path vehicle with a loss of
control, and can therefore take corrective actions to avoid or mitigate a
rear-end vehicle collision in the forward path of travel.

## 5.7 Queue Warning
### 5.7.1 Description
In a lot of situations, a queue of vehicles on the road may pose a potential
danger and cause delay of traffic, e.g. when a turning queue extends to other
lanes. Using the V2I Service, the queue information can be made available to
other drivers beforehand. This minimizes the likelihood of crashes and allows
for mitigation actions.
### 5.7.2 Pre-conditions
Vehicles A, B, C, and D are supporting V2X Service and can communicate with
each other using the V2V Service, and also communicate with an infrastructure
entity, RSU, via the V2I Service.
Vehicles A, B and C are queuing at a junction with Vehicle A at the queue head
and Vehicle C at the queue end. Vehicle D is approaching the junction from
afar.
### 5.7.3 Service Flows
The service flow involves two aspects: queue determination and queue
information dissemination. The former is making use of the V2V Service, and
the latter is using the V2I Service.
The detailed service flow is as follows:
\- Each of the vehicles A, B and C broadcasts a message periodically to other
vehicles in proximity using V2V Service. The message indicates their status,
e.g. location, vehicle dimension, heading, speed, brake status, gear level,
and possible environment information.
\- Vehicle C receives the broadcast messages, and determines that it is the
end of the queue, and thus periodically informs the RSU, using V2I Service,
regarding the queue information, e.g. size of the queue, status of the queue,
the size of the queue, the last position of the queue, which lanes are
affected, etc.
\- The RSU broadcasts a message to vehicles in proximity, using the V2I
Service, about the queue, based on information received from Vehicle C.
\- Vehicle D, when approaching the RSU, receives the message from the RSU
using the V2I Service, and the driver is made aware of the queue and related
information, such that driving strategy can be formed before reaching the
queue.
\- The vehicle D joins the queue behind vehicle C. Vehicle D replaces vehicle
C to update the RSU, using V2V Service, about the queue, after it determines
that it became the end of the queue.
### 5.7.4 Post-conditions
Driver of Vehicle D is made aware of the queue ahead of time, and can take
actions accordingly in a timely fashion.

## 5.8 Road safety services
### 5.8.1 Description
V2X messages are delivered from one UE supporting V2I Service to other UEs
supporting V2I Service via an RSU which may be installed on the road side.
The RSU receives V2X messages transmitted from UEs supporting V2I Service and
transmits the received V2X messages to UEs within a local area.
A UE receives V2X messages transmitted by the RSU. After processing the
received V2X messages, the UE notifies the driver of relevant information.

Each UE is capable of generating, transmitting, receiving and processing V2X
messages.
The RSU is capable of generating, transmitting, receiving and processing V2X
messages.
### 5.8.3 Service Flows
Vehicle A and Vehicle B\'s UEs determine a cell which is controlled by an eNB
operating as an RSU for active road safety services.
Vehicle A\'s UE triggers transmission of a V2X message periodically or based
on a certain event that happens at the vehicle, e.g. collision risk warning.
The RSU receives one or more V2X messages from one or more vehicles including
Vehicle A\'s UE.
The RSU may or may not filter out some V2X messages received from some UEs.

Vehicle B\'s UE monitors transmission of the V2I messages and receives the V2I
message at the cell.
Note: The message broadcast by the RSU may or may not be the same as the
message received from the vehicle. However, how the RSU constructs the message
broadcast at the cell is out of the scope of 3GPP.

## 5.14 V2X Road safety service via infrastructure
### 5.14.1 Description
This use case describes the scenario where infrastructure nodes such as RSUs
and traffic safety servers generate and distribute traffic safety-related
messages for road safety.
Figure 5.14.1-1: V2X Service via the Traffic safety server.
### 5.14.2 Pre-conditions
Vehicle A is equipped with a UE supporting V2X Service.
MNO B provides a navigation services for vehicles and drivers, which
recommends an optimal route to the destination.
Jeremy is the owner of Vehicle A and is subscribed to the navigation service
of MNO B.
Jeremy has to leave for the meeting place where he is scheduled to meet
Anthony.
RSU C is a road side unit that uses various sensors to detect the amount of
traffic, the average speed of the vehicles, existence of pedestrians,
existence of accidents, etc.
Vehicle D is passing through the area managed by the RSU C.
### 5.14.3 Service Flows
Jeremy starts the engine of Vehicle A. After Jeremy starts the engine, the UE
of Vehicle A makes a registration toward MNO B. The vehicle A is ready to use
a navigation service offered by MNO B. At the same time, the UE starts to
transmit and receive traffic safety-related messages.
Jeremy interacts with the Vehicle A to indicate his destination through voice
command function. The navigation application of the Vehicle A connects to the
traffic safety server of the MNO B. The traffic safety server replies with the
information about the optimal route to the destination.
While Jeremy is driving the Vehicle A, the UE of the Vehicle A transmits and
receives safety-related V2X messages as requested by the application layer.
Service layer of the RSU C detects that an accident has occurred in the area
where the RSU C manages. The RSU C indicates this accident to the traffic
safety server and starts transmission of this information in the area. In
addition, the traffic safety server informs other RSUs near RSU C that there
is an accident in the area indicated by RSU C. The other RSUs near RSU C start
transmission of V2X messages that there is an accident in the area indicated
by RSU C.
The traffic safety server re-calculates the optimal route for Vehicle A and
informs the Vehicle A of the new route.
Sometimes later, application layer of the RSU C detects that a pedestrian is
approaching and requests the transmission of a V2X message. Subsequently, the
RSU C transmits to nearby vehicles the V2X message that there is a pedestrian.
Because this is local and transient information, the RSU C does not deliver
this information to the traffic safety server.
Vehicle D receives this V2X message transmitted by RSU C.
### 5.14.4 Post-conditions
Jeremy changes the route to the destination and can save time to travel.
Vehicle D drives cautiously and can reduce the potential risk of pedestrian
fatality.
### 5.14.5 Potential Requirements
[PR.5.14.5-001] An RSU shall be able to be configured for transmission of V2X
messages to a UE supporting V2I Service as requested by the V2X Service layer.

and the RSU with means to dynamically control the area where V2X messages are
distributed and transmitted depending on the type and contents of the V2X
messages.
[PR.5.14.5-006] The system shall be able to support delivery of V2X messages
generated by the traffic safety server to the UE supporting V2N Service within

## 5.15 V2N Traffic Flow Optimisation
### 5.15.1 Description
This use case describes vehicles V2N (Vehicle-to-Network) communication to a
centralised ITS server referred here to as "entity" to optimise traffic flow
when approaching intersections. This use case addresses the situation when
approaching the vehicle has to stop even though there are no other cars around
at an intersection or has to slow down because of explicit traffic lights
signal absence. Depending on the traffic situation which is based on the
vehicles\' periodically transmitted messages this entity will provide, via LTE
network entity, a green light to a car when approaching the intersection and
an indication of speed at which the green light will be met without having to
stop or miss the green light phase.
To enable this information about vehicles approaching traffic lights has to be
made available well in advance i.e. in most cases beyond ProSe range. When
coming in ProSe range communication might be switched from network to direct
communication, if deemed useful.
Compared to V2V communication within ProSe range the delay and latency
requirements are more relaxed due to the longer distances and the non-safety
related nature of this use case.
### 5.15.2 Pre-Conditions
Vehicles A, B, C on road 1 are approaching an intersection with road 2,
Vehicle D is approaching the intersection on road 2. All vehicles are equipped
with UEs supporting V2N. If the intersection is equipped with traffic lights,
the entity will copy the information of traffic light and offer an indication
of speed. If the intersection doesn\'t have traffic lights, the entity will
estimate the traffic situation based on the vehicles periodically message and
then offer traffic light information and speed recommendation.
Depending on the V2X deployment model, Vehicle A, B, C and D can be subscribed
to different PLMNs and can be international roamers. This shall not adversely
impact the function of the V2X Service e.g. by increased delays.
{width="4.051388888888889in" height="2.9458333333333333in"}
Figure 5.15.2-1: Example of virtual traffic lights.
### 5.15.3 Service Flows
Vehicles A, B, C and D supporting V2N are transmitting their location, speed
and direction of travel to an entity controlling the traffic light(s) and
giving back information, such as speed recommendations, to the vehicles. The
function of this entity is out of scope for 3GPP.
The 3GPP network will provide additional information to the entity to enable
the entity to authenticate the vehicle more easily.
The 3GPP network will provide a rough indication of location for the entity to
verify the location information received from the vehicle directly.
The entity offers traffic lights information and recommends a proposed speed
to the vehicles and influences the phases of the traffic lights. The drivers
could be notified of this recommended speed by an announcement or other means
such as a head up display.
### 5.15.4 Post-Conditions
Let\'s assume without traffic optimisation Vehicle D would arrive at the
intersection shortly before vehicles A, B and C, causing the traffic light to
stop vehicles A, B, and C. With traffic flow optimisation i.e. taking into
account the speed and direction of the cars and the maximum allowed speed
there are several other options such as:
  * all vehicles will receive indications of a proposed speeds at which all of them will arrive at the traffic lights and meet a green light there or
  * the traffic light will stop vehicle D and give way to vehicles A, B and C to minimize energy consumption by causing a lesser number of vehicles to stop and accelerate again.
If the drivers adhere to the recommendations, the traffic flow will be
impacted least.

Vehicle A and VRU B\'s smartphone are supporting V2P Service;
Vehicle A and VRU B are in proximity (within each other\'s V2P communication
range);
### 5.18.3 Service Flows
Vehicle A broadcasts a message containing its current status, e.g., location,
speed, acceleration and trajectory;
VRU B\'s smartphone determines whether it is in a vulnerable situation with
potential traffic hazard, e.g., by checking user outdoor/indoor status,
proximity to Vehicle A, user activity state, e.g., texting, looking at the
screen, listening to music;
VRU B\'s smartphone broadcasts a pedestrian message containing its status,
e.g. location, speed, acceleration and optionally user behaviour state;
Based on user choice, VRU B\'s smartphone may also receive and process
messages from Vehicle A, in order to alert the pedestrian.
Vehicle A receives messages from VRU B\'s smartphone and determines that it
needs to notify its driver of potential pedestrian conflicts at least [4]
seconds of TTC.
### 5.18.4 Post-conditions
The Driver of Vehicle A is informed of the potential hazard, and can take
necessary actions.
### 5.18.5 Potential Requirements
Note 1: Some example informative V2X parameter sets are offered in Annex A of
this document.
The potential requirements derived from this use case are:

Note 2: The content (which is out of scope of 3GPP) allows the application
layer to make collision avoidance calculations based on, e.g. its current
location, velocity, acceleration and optional estimated trajectory

100ms.
[PR.5.18.5-007] The E-UTRA(N) shall be able to support a maximum frequency of
1 V2X message per second.
[PR.5.18.5-008] The E-UTRA(N) shall be able to support high reliability
without requiring application-layer message retransmissions.
## 5.19 V2X by UE-type RSU
### 5.19.1 Description
This use case describes the scenario where UE supporting V2X discovers and
communicates with UE-type RSU.
### 5.19.2 Pre-conditions
Vehicle A is normal passenger car equipped with a UE A supporting V2X Service.
UE A, subscribed to MNO X, is located in Cell 1 managed by eNB X.1.
Vehicle B is also normal passenger car equipped with a UE B supporting V2X
Service.
UE B, subscribed to MNO X, is located in Cell 1 managed by eNB X.1.
Cell 1 and Cell 2 are managed by eNB X.1 owned by MNO X.
UE C is configured to function as RSU C and located within Cell 1. RSU C
broadcasts traffic signal information such as when green light is turned on
and off.
UE D is configured to function as RSU D and belongs to MNO Y.
Both RSU C and RSU D are located near UE A.
Cell 2 is a neighbouring cell of Cell 1. In Cell 2, there are no UE-type RSUs.
Figure 5.19.2-1: Example deployment scenario.
### 5.19.3 Service Flows
UE A and UE B get authorization to use V2X Service and starts transmission of
V2X application information such as its speed, heading and location.
RSU C, which is same as UE C, requests for eNB X.1 to allocate with radio
resources. eNB X.1 allocates radio resources to RSU C, and RSU C uses the
allocated radio resources to broadcast traffic light signal information.
UE A moves to near RSU C and receives information transmitted by RSU C.
Meanwhile, owner of UE A starts streaming service application. UE A
establishes RRC connection in Cell 1 through eNB X.1 to serve the streaming
service application.
### 5.19.4 Post-conditions
Owner of UE A adjusts speeds so that the vehicle passes the intersection just
before the traffic light turns red.
Owner of UE A keeps track of movement of Vehicle B and avoids car collision.
### 5.19.5 Potential Requirements
[PR.5.19.5-001] The 3GPP Network shall be able to provide means for MNO to
authorise UE-type RSU.
[PR.5.19.5-002] The 3GPP Network shall be able to control radio resources used
by UE-type RSU.
## 5.20 V2X Minimum QoS
### 5.20.1 Description
This use case describes the scenario where E-UTRA(N) resource is not enough
for every UEs 10 Hz V2X message transmission. In addition, this use case
includes the scenario where emergency vehicle is supported.
### 5.20.2 Pre-conditions
Vehicle A is normal passenger car equipped with a UE supporting V2X Service.
Vehicle A is moving from Cell C toward Cell D.
Vehicle E is ambulance equipped with a UE supporting V2X Service.
Vehicle E is also moving from Cell C toward Cell D, then will move to Cell F
which is the final destination.
Cell C has enough resource so that it can accommodate more UEs for V2X
Service.
In Cell D, there are too many vehicles. Because resources in Cell D is fully
utilized, it cannot allocate dedicate resources for any additional UE
supporting V2X Service.
### 5.20.3 Service Flows
Vehicle A transmits V2X message while staying in Cell C.
Vehicle A moves into Cell D.
Vehicle A recognizes that Cell D does not have enough resource for its V2X
message transmission.
Vehicle A indicates to V2X application to reduce the generation of periodic
V2X message to a 1 message per second.
Vehicle A performs transmission of 1 V2X message per second.
Vehicle E transmits V2X message while staying in Cell C.
Vehicle E moves into Cell D.
Vehicle E performs transmission of V2X message as similar as in Cell C.
On the route taken by Vehicle E, other vehicles move to the shoulder of the
road and wait until the ambulance passes by.
### 5.20.4 Post-conditions
Nearby UEs have knowledge regarding Vehicle A and Vehicle E.
Nearby UEs have more accurate knowledge of Vehicle E than Vehicle A.
Minimum QoS requirement of V2X Service is met for Vehicle A.
The vehicle E can get an increased chance to arrive at destination in time.
### 5.20.5 Potential Requirements
[PR.5.20.5-001] The 3GPP network shall be able to provide means to prioritize
V2X message transmission for a UE supporting V2X serving specific purpose
(e.g. ambulance or patrol car on duty).
[PR.5.20.5-002] The 3GPP network shall be able to provide means to prioritize
transmission of V2X message according to its type (e.g. whether road safety
related message or not).
## 5.21 Use case for V2X access when roaming
### 5.21.1 Description
Mary is taking a road trip across the country. She has a car equipped with V2X
capability, with service from her home network operator. On her journey, Mary
encounters a traffic jam in town not served by her home network provider. The
town has deployed V2X capabilities to redirect traffic jams caused by a major
infrastructure construction project. The V2X capabilities must be able to
communicate with devices associated with multiple service providers.
### 5.21.2 Pre-conditions
Mary\'s car is equipped to support V2X capability, with service from her home
network operator.
The town Mary is heading toward has deployed V2X capabilities with service
from the local network operator.
Mary encounters a traffic jam in the town and expects to be directed to an
alternate route by her V2X system.
### 5.21.3 Service Flows
The town\'s V2X system broadcasts a message warning vehicles approaching the
congested area of the traffic jam.
This message may be relayed by other vehicles on the road to extend the range
of the message and give vehicles approaching the town ample time to change
course.
Depending on the route towards the congestion, the message provides
information about alternate routes than can be taken to avoid the congested
area.
Before Mary reaches the town limits, her car\'s V2X system receives the
broadcast message, which may have been relayed by other vehicles in front of
her, alerts Mary to the impending traffic jam, and informs her of the
alternate route information based on her current location and direction of
travel.
### 5.21.4 Post-conditions
Mary is able to take an alternate route and continue on her journey without
delay.
### 5.21.5 Potential Requirements
[PR.5.21.5-001] The 3GPP System shall support communication between devices
for V2V Service which can be: Served by the same PLMN, including when roaming;
or Served by different PLMNs, including when roaming.
[PR.5.21.5-002] The 3GPP System shall support communication between RSUs and
UEs for V2I Service which can be: Served by the same PLMN, including when
roaming; or Served by different PLMNs, including when roaming.
[PR.5.21.5-003] The 3GPP System shall support communication between devices
for V2P Service which can be: Served by the same PLMN, including when roaming;
or Served by different PLMNs, including when roaming.
[PR.5.21.5-004] The 3GPP System shall support the same requirements for
latency, reliability, security, etc. for V2X communication between devices
served by different PLMNs as for communications within a single PLMN.
## 5.22 Pedestrian Road Safety via V2P awareness messages
### 5.22.1 Description
A pedestrian carries a UE, which is able to transmit awareness and safety
related V2P broadcast messages. There are two possible approaches.
\- Approach 1: The pedestrian UE performs risk assessment. (see use case 5.18
Vulnerable Road User (VRU) Safety). The pedestrian UE sends a notification
message with position and speed to the vehicle in case of danger.
\- Approach 2: The pedestrian UE broadcasts itself awareness messages
regarding location and speed. Risk assessment is performed by the Vehicle UE.
This approach is described in this Use Case.
The pedestrian UE broadcasts periodically awareness messages with position,
speed and heading information. The messages are received by Vehicle UEs, which
perform collision risk assessment and warn the vehicle driver and the
pedestrian in case of potential collisions. Example traffic scenarios are
e.g.:
  * a pedestrian with a UE:
    * Vehicle and pedestrian are on a collision course with each other, e.g. the pedestrian is approaching from behind the corner of a building, or entering the road from behind a parked vehicle.
    * Pedestrian is walking on the side of a badly illuminated road.
  * a bicycle or a moped has a UE, composed of an on-board unit which takes care of the communication and a smartphone UI for displaying the warnings.
    * Cyclist is on collision course with the vehicle, e.g. approaching from a cycle lane crossing the road.
    * Cyclist is overtaking a slow moving or standstill vehicle and is in the left blind spot of the vehicle. This includes also the case that the driver opens the door of the vehicle with the bicycle approaching.
    * Vehicle is turning into the path of the cyclist or moped (cyclist is in the right blind spot of the Car)
  * motorcycle
    * Vehicle and motorcycle are on collision course at an intersection. The driver does not notice the motorcycle.
    * Motorcycle is overtaking a vehicle. The vehicle performs a lane change without noticing the approaching motorcycle.
### 5.22.2 Pre-conditions
\- Pedestrian UE and vehicle UE support V2P Services
\- Both pedestrian UE and vehicle UE broadcast periodically awareness
messages.
\- Vehicle UE and pedestrian UE are in proximity i.e. within each other\'s V2P
communication range
\- Pedestrian UE comes within a critical range of the vehicle UE trajectory.
\- Vehicle UE performs collision risk assessment with use of received
awareness messages
\- Vehicle can send collision risk warnings messages to other vehicles.
### 5.22.3 Service Flows
  1. The pedestrian UE periodically broadcasts awareness messages, indicating its current position, speed and heading.
  2. The vehicle UE builds a dynamic map with the location of the other road users
  3. The risk assessment at the vehicle UE detects a potential collision risk
  4. At a potential collision risk, the vehicle UE warns the driver.
### 5.22.4 Post-conditions
Vehicle driver is alerted of a potential collision, and take appropriate
action to avoid or mitigate a collision.
### 5.22.5 Potential Requirements
[PR.5.22.5-001] A UE that supports V2P Services (i.e. used by pedestrian)
shall be able to transmit periodic broadcast messages (i.e. awareness
messages).
[PR.5.22.5-002] The E-UTRA(N) shall be able to support a communication range
between UEs that support V2P Services sufficient to give the vehicle driver(s)
ample response time (e.g. 4 seconds).
[PR.5.22.5-003] The E-UTRAN shall be capable of transferring V2X messages
between UEs supporting V2P Services with a maximum relative velocity according
to the context of the UEs (e.g. for motorcycle-vehicle communications up to
280 km/h, for pedestrian-vehicle communication up to 160 km/h).
[PR.5.22.5-004] The power consumption of a UE supporting V2P Services (i.e.
used by pedestrian) only shall be minimized.
## 5.23 Mixed Use Traffic Management
### 5.23.1 Description
There are a number of variables to be taken into account in a scenario
involving different types of vehicular traffic. The optimal coverage range and
frequency of message transmission depends on several factors, including the
relative velocity of the UEs, potential reaction time of the various
transportation modes (e.g., automobile, train, bicycle, and pedestrian),
traffic density, and any environmental conditions. A V2X system would need the
flexibility to adapt to changing attributes such as vehicular traffic density,
rates of speed, angles of approach, and weather conditions which all may
impact the optimal range and transmission rate in a specific situation.
### 5.23.2 Pre-conditions
A number of V2X Service users are approaching a train crossing. The train is
one user. Others include vehicles on the road, bicycles, and pedestrians. The
users are approaching from varying directions as the train intersects a road
near a cross road.
All users have UEs supporting V2X Service.
There can be one an RSU near the intersection supporting the V2X Service,
which is able to provide direction to nearby UEs regarding V2X message
transmission rates.
### 5.23.3 Service Flows
As the train nears the crossing, the V2X system alerts other users approaching
the crossing to slow and prepare to stop at the train crossing.
The messages can be tailored to meet the needs of users travelling at
different velocities, e.g., alerting cars, bicycles, pedestrians, at different
distances and intervals to allow each adequate time to slow and come to a
stop.
Depending on traffic density (e.g., urban, rural) and weather conditions
(e.g., icy pavement) the RSU may instruct the UEs to transmit V2X messages at
a rate and within a coverage area best suited to prevent accidents under the
specific circumstance (e.g., density, weather, rates and direction of travel).
### 5.23.4 Post-conditions
All users stop in a timely manner at the railroad crossing and remain stopped
until the train has passed.
### 5.23.5 Potential Requirements
[PR.5.23.5-001] The 3GPP system shall be able to vary the transmission rate
and coverage area based on service conditions (e.g., rate of UE speed,
weather, UE density).
## 5.24 Enhancing Positional Precision for traffic participants
### 5.24.1 Description
To obtain their position vehicles usually use a GNSS such as GPS, Galileo,
Beidou, and Glonass. However, the publicly available precision for a position
fix for the most common system GPS is just around 15 m, better values can be
obtained and dependent on the radio conditions and are thus not guaranteed.
To compensate (or better: hide) this shortcoming navigation systems use the
geographical map they need anyhow for routing and match the position fix with
the nearest road and also average and extrapolate position fixes over time.
For assisted driving and even more autonomous driving this situation is not
acceptable, for both it would be good for the car to know whether it is in the
middle of a lane with only an uncertainty of a few centimeters.
### 5.24.2 (void)
### 5.24.3 (void)
### 5.24.4 (void)
### 5.24.5 Potential Requirements
[PR.5.24.5-001] A UE supporting V2X Services should be provided with
additional 3GPP (e.g. OTDOA) and/or non 3GPP (e.g. DGPS) mechanisms by which
it can derive its location with higher accuracy.
[PR.5.24.5-002] The 3GPP Network should make available any supported
positional accuracy improvement techniques in a resource efficient way to a
subscribed UE supporting V2X Services.
## 5.25 Privacy in the V2V communication environment
### 5.25.1 Description
The privacy or anonymity in the V2V communication environment is a requirement
deemed very important for user adoption of the V2V system. Privacy refers to
two aspects:
> \- prevention of association of certain vehicle (or driver) as seen by an
> observer and the safety messages it actually broadcasts.
>
> \- prevention of tracking of the journey of a certain vehicle between two
> geographical points.
The first requirement is achieved via security measures in the safety messages
themselves, whereby the sender/message identifier does not leak any
information about the identity of the driver or vehicle, or characteristics of
the vehicle.
Regarding the second requirement, there is a competing application requirement
for the safety algorithm to track the position of other vehicles in proximity,
on a short time scale, in order to provide basic service to the driver, e.g.
warnings, etc. However, tracking is not needed for longer time scales. Thus
the privacy requirement only applies within the context of a (longer) journey.
### 5.25.2 Pre-conditions
Vehicle A and Vehicle B are supporting V2X Service and can communicate with
each other using V2V service.
### 5.25.3 Service Flows
Vehicle B is driving behind Vehicle A on an urban road, along with other
vehicles, maintaining proximity to each other.
Vehicles A and B both broadcast messages containing location, speed and other
safety information.
Vehicle B receives the messages from Vehicle A and is able to distinguish this
vehicle from others around it who are also broadcasting such messages; Vehicle
B is also able to track its path via path-prediction algorithms, in order to
provide a warning to the driver in case the distance between these two
vehicles becomes unsafe. Yet, Vehicle B cannot actually tell which of the cars
around it is actually the sender of these messages.
After a few minutes, Vehicle A turns to a perpendicular road while Vehicle B
continues, and thus they no longer hear each other\'s safety messages.
Half an hour later, Vehicle A and Vehicle B find themselves on a side road
driving in the same direction, with no other cars around them.
### 5.25.4 Post-conditions
Vehicle B receives the safety messages from Vehicle A, but is not able to tell
that this is the same vehicle that it drove behind on the urban road earlier,
nor is Vehicle A able to tell, by processing Vehicle B\'s safety messages,
that this is the same vehicle that drove behind it.
### 5.25.5 Potential Requirements
[PR.5.25.5-001] The 3GPP system should be able to support driver and vehicle
privacy, by ensuring that a vehicle cannot be tracked or identified by any
other vehicle beyond a certain short time-period required to run path-
prediction algorithms while in proximity.
## 5.26 V2N Use Case to provide overview to road traffic participants and
interested parties
### 5.26.1 Description
This use case describes a general use case for V2N communication that
exercises the strength of 3GPP networks of providing excellent coverage. In
this use case, the existing eNb infrastructure is being used to give road
traffic participants (RTP) a field of view beyond what V2V, even in
combination with RSUs, could provide.
This use case will supplement V2V direct communication, which will be used in
parallel and will be the only means of communication e.g. in case there is no
network coverage. In the use case described here each road traffic participant
(RTP), sends the CAM/DENM messages also to an entity in the network - the road
traffic server (RTS). The RTS could be centralised, covering an entire country
or decentralised, overlooking only a small geographical area or a combination
of both. If decentralised, RTS need to communicate between each other but this
is out of scope for 3GPP.
The RTS collects data received from the road traffic participants in the area
it is covering and provides data for broadcast by the network. The broadcast
in a certain area would contain data of all road traffic participants in that
area. The area may be constituted of a single cell or several cells. Doing so,
information broadcasted by the network gives RTPs an overview perimeter of the
size of the coverage area beyond the perimeter provided by direct
communication. The broadcast could also contain data of RTP in areas served by
adjacent RTS enlarging the field of view even beyond the current RTS coverage
area.
### 5.26.2 Pre-Conditions
Road traffic participants are equipped with UE able to support both V2V and
V2N communication in parallel. V2N and V2V can be separately subscribed to.
Depending on the deployment model, frequency bands used for V2N may be
different to the bands used for V2V. V2N and V2V may be operated by the same
or different operators.
### 5.26.3 Service Flows
Road traffic participants are broadcasting the ITS defined messages at the
defined repetition rates on the direct link (V2V).
In parallel the ITS messages are transmitted to the road traffic server (RTS),
located in the network. This communication is acknowledged back to the road
traffic participant by the network and thus the repetition rate for the ITS
messages can be lowered. As V2N is a new service and there are no legacy UE or
networks, if necessary, the format of the ITS defined messages could also be
changed for V2N to simplify and to better suit the 3GPP based approach.
The RTS receives ITS messages from road traffic participants in its coverage
area that may be constituted of a single cell, a group of cells or even the
entire network. If several RTS cover one network, they might update each other
about RTPs in their boundary areas. The RTS then selects the relevant messages
from the ITS messages for its coverage area (cell, group of cells) to be
broadcasted to. The function of the RTS and potential communication between
RTS is out of scope for 3GPP.
### 5.26.4 Post-Conditions
Compared to V2V communication a RTP receiving this broadcast gets a much wider
view of other RTPs. It further gives precise and valuable information to the
RTS about traffic flow and conditions level that might be of high value for
traffic steering and control. For both anonymity and privacy, protection
mechanisms need to be provided that can be enabled if required.
### 5.26.5 Potential Requirements
[PR.5.26.5-001] The E-UTRAN shall be capable of transferring V2N Service layer
messages via 3GPP network entities between a UE and a road traffic server with
variable message payload of 50-1200 Bytes.
[PR.5.26.5-002] The E-UTRAN shall be capable of transferring V2N Service layer
messages via 3GPP network entities between a UE and a road traffic server with
a maximum frequency of 10 messages per second and a minimum frequency of 1
message per 100 seconds.
[PR.5.26.5-003] The E-UTRAN shall be capable **of transferring V2N Service
layer messages via 3GPP network entities between** a **UE and receiving UEs
both** supporting V2N applications **with an end-to-end delay no larger than
500 ms**.
[PR.5.26.5-004] The E-UTRAN shall support anonymity, privacy and integrity
protection of communication, if requested by the V2N MNO.
[PR.5.26.5-005] The 3GPP network shall provide means to support the entity to
authorise the UEs supporting V2N Service.
[PR.5.26.5-006] The E-UTRAN shall provide a means to distribute information
received on the V2N service layer messages by the road traffic server in a
resource efficient way to large numbers of UEs on a per cell, group of cells
or network basis.
## 5.27 Remote diagnosis and just in time repair notification
### 5.27.1 Description
A road side unit (RSU) having the capability to access an internet will enable
any passing by vehicle to report about its current functional state to a
local/remote diagnosis center and to receive "Just in time repair
notification" if having subscribed to such service. A Vehicle Service Centre
located at the Car Repair Center needs to obtain and analyze data from the
vehicle periodically. Based on the analysis result, it will notify to the
vehicle owner showing what\'s going on with the vehicle ---in simple language
and images together with some maintenance suggestions. Also the Vehicle owner
also has the ability to initiate the data information collected to be wiped
from the Repair Centre. This will reduce the risk of vehicle failure while
optimizing the vehicle checks only when necessary, it also allows the Vehicle
owner to still have control over their data.
### 5.27.2 Pre-conditions
  * Vehicle Owner: Reads the Vehicle Diagnostic & Maintenance Report sent from the Vehicle Service Centre, the vehicle owner would decide whether to maintain his/her vehicle.
  * UE supports V2N Service: It is embedded in a vehicle, which is used to send information to Vehicle Service Centre and implement diagnostics function from Vehicle Service Centre.
  * Radio Side Unit: As the transmission medium, it supports the collection and transmission of data from the Vehicle to the Repair Center.
  * Vehicle Service Centre: It operates a service platform for diagnostics and maintenance of vehicles, obtains and analyzes the diagnostics data from the vehicle. It will also send vehicle Diagnostic & Maintenance Report in e-mail together with maintenance suggestions to the vehicle owner.
The vehicle supports the diagnostics pre-configured to report the diagnostics
data collected from sensors within the vehicle periodically.
The vehicle engine is turned on and car in operating mode and the service is
subscribed to and has been activated
### 5.27.3 Service Flows
{width="5.863888888888889in" height="2.5805555555555557in"}
Figure 5.27.2-1: Vehicle diagnostics normal flow.
  1. The UE that supports V2N Service collects the diagnostics data from sensors within the vehicle. The diagnostics data (Car Maintenance Records) includes information from Engine and Transmission System, Stability Control System, Air Bag System, Emission System, Antilock Brake System, tyre pressure, life of engine oil, engine and gear-box status, antilock braking system status etc.
  2. When the vehicle passes an RSU, it will transmit the data collected (provided it\'s subscribed to the service) and the application has been initiated.
  3. The RSU will transmit the data to the Vehicle repair center where the data is analyzed and diagnosed.
  4. If for example the Vehicle repair center detects that the Brake pads need to be replaced. It will send maintenance information with possible location for repairs etc, how urgent the repairs needs to be done to the car owner, either via email or directly to the UE that supports V2N.
  5. The vehicle owner can then choose to act on the information or not.
  6. Finally the vehicle owner can issue an application request to also wipe out the data collected and stored in the Diagnostic center.
### 5.27.4 Post-conditions
For normal flow, the vehicle owner maintains his/her vehicle according to the
Diagnostic & Maintenance report on just in time basis.
### 5.27.6 Potential Requirements
[PR.5.27.5-001] UE supporting V2N Service shall be able to transmit periodic
unicast message (e.g., diagnostic data) to an application server.
# 6 Considerations
## 6.1 Consideration on coverage
V2X Service for safety applications shall be supported when vehicles are
served by E-UTRAN which supports V2X Service and when not served by E-UTRAN
which supports V2X Service.
Note 1: When network\'s coordination is not available out of coverage, in high
density situations V2V Service quality may be degraded.
Note 2: When an RSU is implemented in an eNB, V2I Service is not supported
when not served by E-UTRAN which supports V2X Service.
Note 3: V2N service is not supported when vehicles are not served by any of
E-UTRAN, GSM and UTRAN.
## 6.2 Consideration on spectrum
In order not to preclude any scenario, considerations can be given if V2X
Service shall use spectrum dedicated to V2X or if it can co-exist in spectrum
shared with non-V2X applications. Regarding spectrum usage, five aspects can
be considered whether V2X service is using shared spectrum, designated
spectrum, single versus multiple MNOs, overlapping/non-overlapping MNO areas
and operators ownership of V2X spectrum. Detailed spectrum usage options can
be found in Annex B.
One of the desirable operating models for V2V service using direct
communication is in unified and dedicated spectrum at least regionally
harmonised.
If V2X safety services co-exist in spectrum shared with other 3GPP-defined
services, 3GPP network should consider prioritization between V2X safety
services and other services in radio resource allocation.
## 6.3 Consideration on security
### 6.3.1 Anonymity and integrity protection
It should be noted that there are requirements requiring the support of
integrity protection and user, subscriber, & UE anonymity.
Any mechanism chosen to address the anonymity requirement should allow for
temporary traceability. This is necessary in order to enable path-prediction
algorithms to be run (for short distances) by UEs supporting V2V Services.
Any solution chosen to satisfy the requirements for Integrity Protection
should not negatively impact the ability of the system to offer anonymity of
the user, subscriber, and vehicle, with temporary traceability.
### 6.3.2 Confidentiality
It should be noted that there are requirements requiring confidentiality
protection of unicast V2X messages. For V2X messages that are broadcast,
integrity protection is sufficient---no confidentiality is required since they
are meant to be widely received (i.e., by any UE supporting V2X Services in
range).
### 6.3.3 Non-repudiation
It should be noted that there are no requirements requiring non-repudiation,
however non-repudiation may be desired for broadcast messages, i.e., a UE
supporting V2X Services which sent a malicious/incorrect safety message cannot
deny that it sent that message.
### 6.3.4 MNO licensed spectrum
Editor\'s Note: The following requirements apply for licensed spectrum. Other
spectrum needs further study.
It should be considered that the MNO network performs the authentication and
authorization of UEs for V2V Service.
It should be considered that the MNO network be responsible for the security
parameter management for the V2V security mechanism on the radio interface.
## 6.4 Consideration on mobility
Consideration can be given to the impact on mobility management signalling by
the introduction of a large number of UEs supporting V2X Service.
## 6.5 Consideration on future-proofness
Effectiveness of V2X service is maximized when each vehicle can communicate
with all nearby vehicles. The existence of a single vehicle which is not
communicable will make V2X service less useful to nearby V2X-capable vehicles.
Thus, the scenario where two vehicles supporting V2X service cannot
communicate with each other should be avoided. Consideration should be given
to support of LTE-based V2X Services, given long-term changes in operating
spectrum. In addition, consideration should be given to interoperability
between LTE-based V2X Services and those provided by later generation of 3GPP
access.
## 6.6 Consideration for V2X deployment
Various options exist for deployment of V2X scenarios. Annex D includes
deployment examples.

# 8 Conclusion and Recommendations
The Feasibility Study for LTE support for V2X service (V2XLTE) Technical
Report analyses a number of use cases of V2X for both safety use and non-
safety use. The use cases address three key categories of V2X:
  * Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V),
  * Vehicle-to-Infrastructure/Network (V2I/V2N), and
  * Vehicle-to-Pedestrian.
Taking into account the Use Cases and Scenarios in Clause 5, potential
requirements for the operations of UE supporting V2X Service and roadside unit
(RSU), which can be implemented in the form of either stationary UE or eNB,
have been identified. These potential requirements have been summarised as a
set of consolidated potential requirements as captured in the previous clause.
It is recommended that the potential requirements identified in this TR are
considered for the development of normative requirements.
###### ### Annex A: Example parameters
Table A.1 shows some example link-layer parameters for V2X communication which
cover a variety of scenarios. It should be noted that there are various
variables involved in these scenarios both physical (e.g. relative speed,
effective range), incidental (e.g. line-of-sight occlusion), and service
related (e.g. maximum tolerable latency, minimum application layer message
reception reliability). These parameters need to be managed as designing the
system in such a way as to meet all of the most stringent criteria places an
unnecessary burden on the system.
These parameters can be derived from the principle that there should be more
than 95% probability that the vehicle has received at least one V2X message
from two consecutive V2X messages notifying it of the impending incident.
In the cases where this is not possible (e.g. a new incident is presented with
an event horizon closer than TTC=4s), it is presumed that due to the
relatively closer proximity of this incident, the reliability of the radio
layer will provide an increased probability to deliver the V2X message to the
vehicle in a timely manner.

Note*: Effective range is greater than range required to support TTC=4s at
maximum relative speed. This is such that multiple V2X transmissions are
required to increase the cumulative (overall, effective, or final)
transmission reliability.
Note**: This scenario represents the scenario where a new incident presents
itself at a short range, requiring a high level of reliability for short range
radio transmissions to ensure timely message delivery, thus a cumulative
transmission reliability may not be appropriate.
Note***: Example shown for 2 transmissions, for the statistical assumptions
leading to a probability of 1 -- (1-p)^2^, where p is the probability of
reception at the radio layer. V2X application layer requires a consecutive
packet loss no more than 5%. If probability that a single V2X application
layer message is lost is less than 20%, the requirement of less than 5%
consecutive packet loss is met. Due to PHY retransmissions and the rapid
cadence of application layer transmissions, the reliability as viewed from the
application layer will be increased from the numbers as stated in this column.
Note****: The 20ms requirement might be treated with lower priority compared
to the other requirements.
Note: # 1 (suburban/major road): arterial road where vehicles move fairly fast
but slower than in freeway/motorway.
###### ### Annex B: Spectrum usage options for LTE-based V2X
In the following, aspects affecting spectrum usage options for LTE-based V2X
are listed.
  * Aspect 1: (void)
  * Aspect 2: Designated Spectrum (for V2X)
    * 2A: A spectrum on which V2X Service can be provided is designated for use only by V2X
    * 2B: A spectrum on which V2X Service can be provided is not only designated to V2X but also to other services.
```{=html}
``` \- Aspect 3: Multi-operator / Single operator
    -   3A: In one region, several operators provide V2X Service.
    -   3B: In one region, no more than one operator provides V2X
        Service.
  * Aspect 4: Overlapping / Non Overlapping MNO areas (in case of multi operators environments)
    * 4A: In some part of one region, service area of one operator overlaps with service area of other operators providing V2X Service
    * 4B: In one region, service area of different operators does not overlap.
  * Aspect 5:
    * 5A: Operator designating part of its own spectrum for V2X Service.
    * 5B: Operators do not use own spectrum for V2X Service
###### ### Annex C: Density of UEs
Modern traffic modeling research shows that there is a connection between
traffic density and vehicle speed: Generally speaking, the more vehicles are
on a road, the slower their speeds are. To allow for operation in realistic
environments, V2X Services should be supported under high vehicle density with
low speed.
###### ### Annex D: V2X deployment examples
### D.1 Infrastructure-less V2X operation
In this scenario, UEs can communicate with each other directly using the V2X
spectrum.
In order to support this scenario, UEs are configured with the same parameters
for the V2X communication. Mechanisms defined for the ProSe out of coverage
communication parameter provisioning can be reused. It is expected that UE
will obtain new parameters for V2X communication from the network as soon as
it enters into network coverage.
It is also expected that when operating in this scenario, only some of the V2X
use cases described in clause 5 can be supported because of the absence of
mobile network and subscription verification. For example, V2N services cannot
be supported. A pre-configured service set for this scenario may be supported
based on standards or regulatory requirements.
### D.2 Multi-MNOs shared V2X services scenario
This scenario is similar to the existing mobile network deployment, i.e.
multiple MNOs offer V2X services to their subscribers. Each UE is under the
control of a seperate MNO and the UEs are controlled by their MNOs for the
access to the V2X spectrum and services. As the UEs have subscriptions from
different MNOs, the different MNOs ensure that the UEs can transmit to and
receive from UEs of other MNOs. E.g. broadcast UE configurations via system
information announcements, or via dedicated signaling for the individual UE.
All the services described in clause 5 can be supported with this scenario,
subject to UE subscription authorization.
It should be noted that for this scenario, when the UE goes out of coverage,
it would fall back to the infrastructure-less case as discussed in Annex X.1.
Therefore, the configurations from the MNOs may also contain the necesary
parameters to support out of coverage operation.
### D.3 Single MNO managed V2X scenario
In this scenario, a single mobile operator is granted the ownership/lease of
the V2X spectrum and thus manages the V2X services.
This scenario requires all V2X UE to have a valid subscription to the MNO that
manages the V2X spectrum. Alternatively, the MNO that manages the V2X spectrum
would need to allow other subscription to other MNOs to be used in V2X
authorization.
The scenario can be futher divided into two subcases: a) split control, and b)
co-channel deployment. In the split control subcase, the control channel for
the V2X service access is provided in the MNO\'s WAN spectrum. In this case,
only V2X services transmissions can occur in the V2X spectrum. In the co-
channel deployment subcase, the control of the V2X services is also performed
over the WAN spectrum.
All the services described in clause 5 can be supported with this scenario,
subject to UE subscription authorization.
Similarly, for this deployment scenario, when the UE goes out of coverage, it
would also fall back to the infrastructure-less case.
###### ### Annex E: Intersection safety for pedestrian via vehicle to
infrastructure communication
### E.1 Description
> VRUs are detected and/or tracked by sensors (e.g. camera\'s, loops)
> installed at the roadside infrastructure monitoring the (signalized)
> intersection. The RSU is connected to this monitoring system. The monitoring
> system is able to track VRUs and determine their location and speed. The RSU
> receives awareness messages from vehicle UEs and performs risk assessment to
> identify potential collision risks between VRUs and vehicles and sends
> warnings to the vehicle drivers via the vehicle UE. The pedestrian detection
> can also be part of the traffic light infrastructure at a signalized
> intersection. The information on pedestrian presence or cyclists at the
> crossing is included in the signal status messages transmitted over V2X to
> vehicle UEs, in case of optional conflicts.
### E.2 Pre-conditions
  * The vehicle UE and RSU support V2X Services and can receive V2X messages.
  * The vehicle UE sends periodically awareness messages.
  * The vehicle UE is in proximity of RSU i.e. within each other\'s V2X communication range.
```{=html}
``` \- The VRU is within the detection range of the monitoring system
connected to the RSU.
### E.3 Service Flows
  1. The intersection monitoring system builds a dynamic map with all road users around the intersection, both the road users detected by the monitoring system and the road users transmitting V2X messages.
  2. For collision avoidance, the monitoring system performs risk assessment to detect a potential conflict.
  3. At a potential conflict, the RSU broadcasts a (I2V) warning message to the vehicle UE.
  4. The vehicle UE receives the I2V warning message, and the driver can be informed
### E.4 Post-conditions
The vehicle driver is warned and can take actions to avoid a potential
collision.
